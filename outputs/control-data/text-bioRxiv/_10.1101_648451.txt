Abstract

33

The origins of novel trophic specialization, in which organisms begin to exploit novel resources

34

for the first time, may be explained by shifts in behavior such as foraging preferences or feeding

35

kinematics. One way to investigate the behavioral mechanisms underlying ecological novelty is

36

by comparing prey capture kinematics between groups. In this study, we investigated the

37

contribution of kinematics to the origins of a novel ecological niche for scale-eating within a

38

microendemic adaptive radiation of pupfishes on San Salvador Island, Bahamas. We compared

39

prey capture kinematics across three species of pupfish while consuming shrimp and scales in the

40

lab and found that scale-eating pupfish exhibited peak gape sizes that were twice as large as all

41

other groups, but also attacked prey with a more obtuse angle between their lower jaw and

42

suspensorium. We then investigated how this variation in feeding kinematics could explain

43

scale-biting performance by measuring the surface area removed per strike from standardized

44

gelatin cubes. We found that a combination of larger peak gape and more obtuse lower jaw and

45

suspensorium angles resulted in 67% more surface area removed per strike, indicating that scale-

46

eaters may reside on a performance optimum for scale-biting. We also measured feeding

47

kinematics of F1 hybrids to test whether feeding performance could contribute to reproductive

48

isolation between species and found that F1 hybrid kinematics and performance more closely

49

resembled those of generalists, suggesting that they may have low fitness in the scale-eating

50

niche. Ultimately, our results suggest that the evolution of strike kinematics in this radiation is

51

an adaptation to the novel niche of scale-eating.

Introduction

54

Determining how organisms use resources for the first time and occupy novel niches is an

55

outstanding question in evolutionary ecology. Many changes accompany adaptation to a novel

56

niche and previous studies have investigated how shifts in behaviors (Bowman and Billeb 1965;

57

Tebbich et al. 2010; Curry and Anderson 2012), morphologies (Ferry-Graham et al. 2001; Ferry-

58

Graham 2002; Hata et al. 2011; Davis et al. 2018), physiologies (Arias-Rodriguez et al. 2011;

59

Tobler et al. 2015, 2018), and kinematics (Janovetz 2005; Patek et al. 2006; Cullen et al. 2013;

60

McGee et al. 2013) can all facilitate this transition.

61

Shifts in kinematic traits—particularly those which affect prey capture and feeding—are

62

especially promising, because they can provide biomechanical insights into the origins of novel

63

trophic niches. For example, the wimple piranha (Catoprion mento) uses a ram attack coupled

64

with a uniquely large gape angle to knock scales free from its prey (Janovetz 2005);

65

Syngnathiform fishes specialize on evasive prey items using power-amplified jaws (Longo et al.

66

2018); and the Pacific leaping blenny (Alticus arnoldorum) is able to feed and reproduce on land

67

by using unique axial tail twisting to improve propulsion and stability for greater jumping

68

performance (Hsieh 2010).

69

Differences in prey capture kinematics between species may also contribute to

70

postzygotic extrinsic reproductive isolation by reducing hybrid feeding performance (Higham et

71

al. 2016b), which may lead to speciation (Henning et al. 2017; Matthews and Albertson 2017).

72

For example, McGee et al. (2015) measured prey capture kinematics and performance in two

73

sunfish species (Centrarchidae) and their naturally occurring hybrids. Hybrid sunfish displayed

74

intermediate gape size compared to parental types and initiated strikes from an intermediate

75

distance, yet their actual feeding performance was less than predicted from additive traits.

76

Hybrid Lake Victoria cichlids (produced by crossing thick-lipped Haplochromis chilotes and

77

thin-lipped Pundamilia nyererei parents) also exhibited lower foraging performance compared to

78

parental species, most likely due to antagonistic pleiotropy and genetic correlations between

79

head and lip morphology (Henning et al. 2017). Despite these findings, few studies investigate

80

how hybrid kinematics affects the evolution of novelty or explicitly connect kinematics to

81

performance consequences.

82

Scale-eating (lepidophagy) is excellent for connecting a mechanistic understanding of

83

feeding kinematics with adaptation to a novel trophic niche. It is an extremely rare trophic niche

84

which has independently evolved only 19 times in approximately 100 fish species out of over

85

35,000 (Sazima 1983; Martin and Wainwright 2013a; Kolmann et al. 2018). However, not much

86

is known about its evolutionary origins or its kinematics. Current hypotheses for the origins of

87

scale-eating vary, but they all take a strict behavior-first approach (Greenwood 1965; Sazima

88

1983; St. John et al. 2018) suggesting that kinematic variation may also contribute to the origins

89

of scale-eating. However, only a few studies have investigated the feeding kinematics and

90

performance of scale-eating fishes. Janovetz (2005) measured feeding kinematics of C. mento

91

while consuming: 1) free floating scales, 2) whole fish, and 3) scales off the sides of fish, and

92

found that scale-eating kinematics were different from those used during suction-feeding or

93

biting. Interestingly, scale-eating attacks produced gape angles that ranged from 30-100% larger

94

than those produced from consuming free-floating scales or whole fish respectively— suggesting

95

that a larger gape is necessary for scale-eating. Furthermore, this variation in gape angle across

96

food items was documented within individuals, indicating that scale-eating kinematics may be

97

behaviorally mediated (Janovetz 2005). The feeding kinematics of the Lake Tanganyikan scale-

98

eating cichlid, Perissodus microlepis, have also been examined (Takeuchi et al. 2012; Takeuchi

99

and Oda 2017). While many studies of this species focus on how kinematics interacted with P.

100

microlepis’ antisymmetric mouth morphology, and not on scale-eating kinematics per se, they

101

have still documented a significant interaction between kinematic traits, behavior, and

102

morphology. For example, P. microlepis were able to perform more successful scale-eating

103

strikes using their dominant side (Takeuchi et al. 2012; Takeuchi and Oda 2017). A similar oral

104

jaw antisymmetry and behavioral laterality was documented in a scale-eating characiform

105

(Exodon paradoxus; Hata et al. 2011). While these studies provide valuable insights into scale-

106

eating kinematics and performance, the lack of comparative data on the kinematics of closely

107

related non-scale-eating species or hybrids has so far limited further investigations of the origins

108

of scale-eating.

109

The overall goal of our study was to fill the following knowledge gaps and shed light on

110

the relationship between kinematic traits and occupation of a novel niche: First, comparisons of

111

scale-eating kinematics across scale-eating and closely related non-scale-eating outgroup species

112

is necessary for investigating the origins of novelty. Without the comparative method it is

113

impossible to determine which kinematic variables are unique or important for scale-eating.

114

Second, very few kinematic studies investigate hybrid kinematics. Understanding hybrid

115

kinematics, especially in the context of novelty, is informative because 1) impaired performance

116

in hybrids is a form of extrinsic postzygotic isolation between species (McGee et al. 2015;

117

Higham et al. 2016b) and 2) it can allow the decoupling of morphology, behavior, and

118

kinematics making it easier to identify causative traits underlying performance (Holzman and

119

Hulsey 2017). Finally, few studies connect observed variation in kinematics to variation in whole

120

organism feeding performance (but see: Svanbäck et al. 2003; Takeuchi et al. 2012; Whitford et

121

al. 2019). Making this connection is important because it can identify kinematic traits associated

122

with performance tasks relevant to evolutionary fitness rather than simply describing phenotypic

123

variation in kinematic traits, most of which may not be relevant to performance or fitness

124

(Arnold 1983; Hu et al. 2017).

125

The scale-eating pupfish (Cyprinodon desquamator) is an excellent organism to

126

investigate the interaction of kinematics and novelty for several reasons. First, the scale-eating

127

pupfish evolved within a recent sympatric radiation of pupfishes on San Salvador Island,

128

Bahamas. This radiation is endemic to a few hypersaline lakes on the island (Martin and

129

Wainwright 2013a), which were most likely dry during the last glacial maximum 10-15 kya

130

(Hagey and Mylroie 1995). Second, the radiation provides closely related sister taxa for

131

kinematic comparison including: 1) the scale-eating pupfish, 2) a generalist pupfish (C.

132

variegatus), and 3) a snail-eating pupfish (C. brontotheroides). Phylogenetic evidence suggests

133

that scale-eating pupfish form a clade across all lakes where they are found on San Salvador and

134

that this clade is sister to a clade containing generalists and snail-eaters (Martin and Feinstein

135

2014; Lencer et al. 2017), although gene flow is still ongoing among all three species (Richards

136

and Martin 2017). All three pupfish species can be crossed in the lab to measure the kinematics

137

and performance of hybrid phenotypes.

138

The morphological similarities and differences between San Salvador pupfishes have also

139

previously been described. Specifically, 1) all pupfish species exhibit vestigial ascending

140

processes of the premaxilla allowing for independent movement of the upper and lower jaws

141

during jaw protrusion (Hernandez et al. 2009, 2018), and 2) scale-eating pupfish have two-fold

142

larger, supra-terminal oral jaws compared to the smaller, terminal jaws of the generalist or snail-

143

eating pupfish (Martin and Wainwright 2011, 2013a; Martin 2016). Their divergent morphology,

144

along with the findings of Janovetz (2005), leads us to predict that scale-eating pupfish should

145

have larger gapes during scale-eating attacks compared to other species of pupfish, and that this

146

peak gape should be the result of a larger angle between the anterior tip of the premaxilla, the

147

quadrate-articular joint, and the anterior tip of the dentary.

148

We investigated the interaction between kinematics and novelty in pupfishes by

149

recording the high-speed feeding strikes of San Salvador generalist, snail-eating, and scale-eating

150

pupfishes, along with F1 hybrids. We asked: 1) if scale-eating pupfish differed in their feeding

151

kinematics compared to other groups during scale-eating and suction-feeding strikes, 2) whether

152

variation in kinematics was associated with bite performance, and 3) if F1 hybrid feeding

153

kinematics differed from parental species. Ultimately, we found that the feeding kinematics of

154

scale-eating pupfish diverged from all other species and were not solely due to their increased

155

oral jaw size. Instead, scale-eaters may be behaviorally mediating their feeding kinematics to

156

optimize the surface area removed per strike, suggesting that scale-eater kinematics are a recent

157

adaptation to scale-eating.

Methods

160

Collection and Husbandry

161

We used seine nets to collect generalist, snail-eating, and scale-eating pupfishes from Crescent

162

Pond, Little Lake, and Osprey Lake on San Salvador Island, Bahamas in July, 2017 and March,

163

2018. Wild-caught fish were maintained in 37-75L mixed-sex stock tanks at a salinity of 5-10

164

ppt and temperature of 23-27

165

mysis shrimp, and commercial pellet foods daily. In the lab, we crossed generalist and scale-

166

eating pupfishes from both Little Lake and Crescent Pond to produce F1 hybrid offspring. Prior

167

to filming, pupfishes were isolated in 2L tanks to maintain individual IDs throughout the study.

Feeding kinematics

170

We recorded pupfishes feeding on three different food items: frozen mysis shrimp (Mysida,

171

Hikari Inc.), scales, and standardized gelatin cubes (dimensions: 1.5 cm x5cm X 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm

172

cube; Repashy Superfoods, Community Plus Omnivore Gel Premix; prepared following

173

manufacturer’s instructions). We measured feeding kinematics while fish consumed both shrimp

174

and scales because it allowed us to ask if 1) scale-eating pupfish differed in their feeding

175

kinematics compared to other groups, 2) if the kinematics of scale-eating strikes differ from

176

those used during suction feeding (e.g. shrimp), and 3) if F1 hybrid feeding kinematics differed

177

from parental species. We explicitly examined F1 hybrid kinematics in this study because

178

lowered hybrid feeding performance may contribute to reproductive isolation between species

179

and may shed light on the underlying genetics of feeding kinematics. We additionally measured

180

feeding kinematics across all groups while fish consumed gelatin cubes to ask whether variation

181

in kinematic traits affected feeding performance (i.e. bite size).

182

In the lab, fish freely consumed mysis shrimp, but we had to train all species to feed on

183

scales from the sides of euthanized zebrafish (Danio rerio; stored frozen) and to feed from

184

gelatin cubes (stored at 4 ). For training, we isolated each fish in a 2-liter plastic tank and

185

presented a given food item (either euthanized zebrafish or gelatin cube) daily. If a pupfish began

186

feeding on the item, it was left in the tank until the pupfish stopped feeding. If a pupfish did not

187

begin feeding within one minute, the food item was removed from the tank. Any pupfish that did

188

not feed received a supplemental feeding of commercial pellet food (New Life Spectrum Thera-

189

A, medium sinking pellets). If an individual did not feed on a training item for more than two

190

days, we reduced supplemental feedings to once every two days to ensure that the fish was

191

sufficiently motivated. Once pupfish reliably began feeding on either scales or gelatin cubes, we

192

proceeded to film their feeding behaviors according to the filming protocol below. Fish were

193

never trained on more than one item at a time, and we instead ensured that all filming was

194

completed for a single food item before proceeding to train for the next item.

195

For all three food items, we used a Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX10 III (480fps) or Sony

196

Cyber-shot DSC-RX100 IV 20.1 MP (480fps) for high-speed video of foraging strikes.

197

Illumination was provided by a dimmable bi-color 480 LED light (Neewer) positioned ~0.3 m

198

from the filming tank. Pupfish were allowed to acclimate to the lighting before feeding

199

commenced. Fish were considered acclimated when they moved around their tank freely (usually

200

after ~5 minutes). For scale-eating we used forceps to hold a euthanized zebrafish horizontally in

201

the water column and perpendicular to the front of an individual. For mysis shrimp and gelatin

202

cubes, we dropped the food item a few inches in front of an individual. All videos were taken

203

from a lateral perspective. Once filming for one food item was completed, the process was

204

repeated until we filmed each individual consuming all three food items.

205
206

Kinematic analyses

207

Videos were converted to image stacks and analyzed using the image processing software (FIJI;

208

Schindelin et al. 2012). To quantify feeding performance, we measured 10 kinematic trait

209

metrics including 1) Peak jaw protrusion, defined as the distance (mm) from the center of the

210

orbit to the anterior tip of the premaxilla. 2) Time to peak protrusion, defined as the time (s) from

211

the start of an attack (defined as 20% of peak gape) to peak protrusion. 3) Peak gape, defined as

212

the distance (mm) from the anterior tip of the premaxilla to the anterior tip of the dentary. 4)

213

Time to peak gape, defined as the time (s) from the start of an attack at 20% of peak gape to peak

214

gape. 5) Gape angle was the angle (degrees) produced at peak gape between the anterior tip of

215

the premaxilla, the quadrate-articular joint, and the anterior tip of the dentary. 6) Lower jaw

216

angle was the angle produced at peak gape between the lower jaw, the quadrate-articular joint,

217

and the ventral surface of the fish beneath the suspensorium (Figure 1&2). 7) Time to impact

218

was the time (s) from the start of an attack (20% peak gape) to first contact of oral jaws with the

219

prey item. 8) Time from peak gape to impact was the difference between the time to impact (s)

220

and the time to peak gape (s). 9) Starting distance from prey was the distance (mm) from the

221

center of the orbit at the start of an attack to the center of the orbit at impact with prey item.

222

Finally, 10) ram speed was the starting distance from prey at 20% of peak gape (m) divided by

223

the time to impact (s). In addition to our kinematic metrics, we also measured body length and

224

lower jaw length (Table S1) using images from the video. We calibrated each video using a grid,

225

positioned at the back of the filming tank.

226
227

Measuring bite performance

228

In order to connect variation in feeding kinematics to variation in bite size we recorded high-

229

speed strikes on gelatin meal replacement for fish in the shape of a 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm cube. We

230

filmed a feeding strike on a single cube and immediately removed the cube from the tank. The

231

gel cube retains its shape in water and therefore allowed us to precisely photograph and measure

232

the area removed by each bite. We used an Olympus Tough TG-5 camera to take photos of each

233

lateral surface of the cube –ensuring that we had photographed the entire bite—and measured the

234

total surface area removed from the cube (Figure 3D). One caveat is we did not measure the

235

depth of the bite, which may be affected by additional kinematic variables during the strike.

236

However, scale-eating attacks observed in the lab and field do not typically produce deep

237

wounds where bite depth may be relevant, thus we expect that surface area is the best proxy for

238

scale-biting performance in this system. Although bites were removed from both the lateral

239

surface and edge of the gelatin cubes during strikes, there was no significant difference in surface

240

area removed (t-test, P = 0.12).

241
242

Statistical analyses

243

Comparing strike kinematics

244

We collected and analyzed 101 feeding strikes from 31 individuals striking both shrimp and

245

scales (7 generalists; 7 snail-eaters; 9 scale-eaters; 8 F1 hybrids). We used linear mixed models

246

(LMMs) in the lme4 package (Bates et al. 2014) in R (R Core Team 2018) to determine if any of

247

our kinematic metrics varied between species or food item. In each model we included: 1) the

248

kinematic metric as the response variable, 2) species designation, food item, and their interaction

249

as fixed effects, 3) individual fish IDs and population nested within species as random effects,

250

and 3) log body size as a covariate (Table 1). Although we compared kinematic data across

251

multiple species, very few genetic variants are fixed between species (<1,000 SNPs out of 12

252

million) and generalists and molluscivores cluster by lake rather than by species (McGirr and

253

Martin 2017; Richards and Martin 2017). Thus, is it appropriate to analyze species differences at

254

these recent timescales as population-scale data using mixed model analyses of independent

255

populations (e.g. Hatfield and Schluter 1999; McGee et al. 2013), rather than phylogenetic

256

comparative methods.

257

We also performed a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) on the combined shrimp and

258

scales kinematic data to reduce dimensionality and identify which kinematic metrics contributed

259

most to differences between species (Table 2, Figure 1A). We used a MANOVA and Wilks’  to

260

assess the significance of the LDA. We did not have enough degrees of freedom to perform these

261

analyses with all of our kinematic variables, so we excluded time to peak protrusion and time to

262

impact as they were highly correlated with time to peak gape (Table S2, r2 > .85), and also

263

excluded distance from prey as it was highly correlated with ram speed (Table S2, r2 = .90). Our

264

MANOVA ultimately included 1) peak protrusion, peak gape, time to peak gape, gape angle,

265

lower jaw angle, time from peak gape to impact, and ram speed as response variables, 2) species

266

designation as a predictor variable, and 3) individual ID as a random effect.

267
268

Determining how kinematic variables affect bite performance

269

We collected and analyzed 31 strikes on cubes across all three species and F1 hybrids. We used

270

generalized additive models (GAMs) from the mgcv package (Wood 2011) in R to investigate

271

how peak gape, peak protrusion, gape angle and lower jaw angle affected bite size. We used

272

GAMs for this analysis because they do not assume a linear relationship between performance

273

(i.e. bite size) and our given kinematic variables, but instead can fit smoothing splines to the data

274

to test for nonlinear associations. We used AIC scores to select our optimal model (Table 3). We

275

started with the most complete model which included 1) area removed from a cube (mm2) as the

276

response variable 2) a spline modeling the interaction between two of our predictor variables,

277

and 3) a single fixed effect. There were insufficient degrees of freedom to test all four terms at

278

once in this model, therefore we tested all combinations of this model with our four predictor

279

variables (Table 3A). We also tested all nested versions of this complex model by 1) removing

280

the interaction term, but maintaining two splines and a fixed effect (Table 3B), 2) removing one

281

spline and including three fixed effects (Table 3C), and finally 3) by testing the model with all

282

four variables as only fixed effects (Table 3D). Ultimately, our best fitting model included area

283

removed from a cube (mm2) as the response variable, univariate smoothing splines for peak gape

284

and Gape angle, and peak protrusion as a fixed effect (average ΔAIC=24.96).

285

Finally, we predicted the area removed per bite for each fish from their peak gape and

286

gape angle kinematic measurements using a machine-learning algorithm from the caret package

287

(Kuhn 2008) using a spline-based method. We could not measure the realized bite size for all

288

scale-eating strikes (feeding off a euthanized zebrafish) and suction-feeding strikes (mysis

289

shrimp). We therefore used a GAM model, estimating the effect of gape size and gape angle on

290

the area removed from gelatin cubes, to predict bite performance (surface area removed) for all

291

scale-biting and suction-feeding strikes in our dataset. Ideally, we would have used our best-

292

fitting GAM model, which also included peak protrusion as a fixed effect. However, the caret

293

package currently only accepts two fixed effects, and peak protrusion ultimately did not affect

294

bite size (P = 0.078). We trained the model using all strikes observed on gelatin cubes (31

295

strikes across all three species and F1 hybrids) and 10-fold cross-validations with three repeats as

296

the resampling scheme. We tested the accuracy of this model by comparing fitted values from

297

the model to observed values from the data set and found that our model was able to predict 70%

298

of the variance in the gelatin-strike dataset (df=1, F= 66.81 , P=5.17x10-9, R2=0.70). We then

299

used this model to predict the area removed for each scale-biting and suction-feeding strike

300

based on the kinematic measurements alone. We used bootstrap resampling (10,000 iterations) to

301

calculate mean bite size (predicted area removed) and 95% confidence intervals for each species.

and therefore intermediate between generalist and scale-eater values. We used a one sample t-test

307

to test whether the observed values of the three traits (peak gape, lower jaw angle, predicted bite

308

sizes) for F1 hybrids deviated from additive predictions.

Results

311

Scale-eaters exhibited divergent feeding kinematics compared to other pupfishes

312

Scale-eaters exhibited divergent feeding kinematics, while consuming both shrimp and scales,

313

compared to other groups (Figure 1A). A MANOVA supported the significance of this

314

discriminant analysis and found species designation was a significant predictor of kinematics

315

(Wilks’  = 0.13; F = 3.05; df = 3; P= 0.00036). Species significantly varied in their peak gape

316

and lower jaw angles during feeding strikes—regardless of the food item— in a linear mixed

317

model controlling for individual ID and body length (Table 1). This pattern was driven by scale-

318

eaters who had peak gapes that were twice as large as other species, but also had lower jaw

319

angles with their suspensorium that were 14% more obtuse than other species (Figure 1B, C).

320

Thus, the scale-eaters’ unique angle of the jaw complex with respect to their body, along with

321

their greatly enlarged oral jaws, allows them to have increased peak gape while maintaining the

322

same gape angle as other species (Figure 2). This may allow their upper jaws to more effectively

323

‘rake’ scales from the prey surface. Ram speed was the only kinematic variable that marginally

324

varied between food items: strikes on shrimp were approximately 16% faster than those on scales

325

(Table 1, Figure S1; P = 0.053).

326

Variation in strike kinematics affected bite size performance

328

GAM modeling indicated that the univariate splines of peak gape and gape angle were both

329

significantly associated with bite size (peak gape: edf=5.30, F=8.96, P= 6.33x10-5; gape angle:

330

edf = 7.48, F= 2.78, P=0.032). The fixed effect of peak protrusion, however, was only

331

marginally significant (t=-1.88, P=0.078). Ultimately this model explained 84.5% of the

332

observed deviance in bite size, and suggests that a larger gapes paired with gape angles of 80°

333

are associated with larger surface areas removed per bite (Figure 3A-C).

334
335

F1 hybrid kinematics are not strictly additive and more closely resemble generalist kinematics

336

F1 hybrid feeding kinematics differed from scale-eater kinematics (Tukey HSD, peak gape: P =

337

1.2x10-6, lower jaw angle: P = 0.0090), but were not significantly different from generalist

338

kinematics (Tukey’s HSD, peak gape: P = 0.21, lower jaw angle: P = 0.37). Mean hybrid peak

339

gape was 39% smaller than scale-eater peak gape and 32% larger than generalist peak gape

340

(Figure 1B). Similarly, mean hybrid lower jaw angle was 9.5% more acute than scale-eater peak

341

lower jaw angle, and 5.6% more obtuse than the mean generalist lower jaw angle (Figure 1C). F1

342

hybrids failed to match additive predictions of intermediate kinematics for peak gape (t-test, μ=

343

3.035, mean= 2.52 mm, P = 0.013), but did meet these predictions for lower jaw angle (t-test, μ=

344

136.5, mean= 133.92 degrees, P = 0.18). Our machine learning model also predicted that scale-

345

eater kinematics would result in bite sizes that are 60% larger than the predicted bites of the

346

other species (Figure 4). Interestingly, estimates for F1 hybrid bite sizes were slightly smaller

347

than expected based on additive predictions (t-test, μ= 320.5, mean= 255.24, P = 0.13).

Discussion
Scale-eating pupfish have divergent feeding kinematics

351

Scale-eating pupfish exhibited peak gapes that were twice as large as other groups, but

352

simultaneously displayed gap angles that were not different from other groups, and lower jaw

353

angles that were 12% more obtuse. Thus, scale-eaters kept their jaws more closed during strikes

354

compared to other species, resulting in smaller gape sizes than the maximum achievable gape

355

given their morphology. These counterintuitive results only partially support our prediction that

356

scale-eaters should have larger peak gapes, similar to the findings of Janovetz (2005) for the

357

scale-eating piranha. Increased gape size in scale-eating pupfish was not due to an increased

358

gape angle as we predicted. Instead, scale-eaters appear to maintain the same gape angle of their

359

oral jaws as in other species (~80°) and increased their lower jaw angle resulting in more closure

360

of their jaws during strikes, effectively lowering the maximum peak gape possible due to their

361

enlarged oral jaws (Figure 2). For example, if a scale-eater decreased their lower jaw angle from

362

150° to 130°, the mean lower jaw angle of generalists, they could increase their peak gape by

363

about 8%. One possibility is that this more obtuse lower jaw angle is an artifact of filming scale-

364

eating strikes in the lab. To investigate this, we analyzed four scale-eating strikes performed by

365

wild scale-eaters observed in Crescent Pond, San Salvador Island, Bahamas (filmed using a

366

Chronos camera (Kron Technologies, model 1.4, 16 GB memory, Color image sensor) with an

367

f1.4 zoom lens in a custom underwater housing (Salty Surf, Inc. Krontech Chronos 1.4 housing

368

with M80 flat port)) and compared their jaw angles to those seen in the lab. Wild strikes had an

369

even more obtuse mean lower jaw angle of 168° while scale-eating strikes in the lab had a mean

370

lower jaw angle of 153° suggesting that an obtuse lower jaw angle is also used during natural

371

scale-eating strikes in hypersaline lakes on San Salvador Island.

372
373

Strike kinematics did not vary across prey items (Table 1), contrary to Janovetz (2005).
In fact, the only kinematic variable that remotely varied between prey items was ram speed

374

(Table 1, Figure S1), but this may simply be due to the fact that shrimp were a moving target

375

during feeding trials while euthanized zebrafish were held stationary with forceps for scale-

376

eating strikes. Alternatively, phenotypic plasticity due to rearing environment could produce a

377

similar pattern; however, we did not observe any differences in strike kinematics between wild

378

caught and lab-reared fish.

379
380

Is jaw morphology solely responsible for kinematic variation?

381

The kinematic variables that varied the most between scale-eating and non-scale-eating

382

pupfishes were peak gape and lower jaw angle—both related to the size of the oral jaws.

383

Previous work has documented that the oral jaws of scale-eating pupfish are two-fold than their

384

sister species (Holtmeier 2001; Martin and Wainwright 2013a; Martin 2016) and may be

385

controlled by four moderate-effect QTL with all positive effects on jaw size, consistent with

386

directional selection on this trait (Martin et al. 2017). It may be that increased oral jaw size is

387

sufficient to create variation in feeding kinematics without an accompanying shift in behavior.

388

Previous studies have documented how changes in morphology alone can alter feeding

389

kinematics. For example, kinematic studies have found that the scaling of the lower jaw in

390

bluegill (Wainwright and Shaw 1999) and body size in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides;

391

Richard and Wainwright 1995) both significantly affected prey capture kinematics. Furthermore,

392

Ferry-Graham et al. (2010) used the pike killifish (Belonesox belizanus) to show that simply

393

doubling the length of the jaws significantly affected key kinematic variables such as peak gape

394

size—even while keeping lower jaw angle constant. Simply stated, the key adaptation necessary

395

for scale-eating may be enlarged, supra-terminal jaws. If this hypothesis were true, we would

396

expect that peak gape would increase with jaw size and that gape angle would increase with the

17

397

shift from terminal to supra-terminal jaws, but all other kinematics variables would remain

398

constant across species. Our results reject this hypothesis. Instead, scale-eaters maintain the gape

399

angle observed in other species and increase their lower jaw angle with the suspensorium by 12

400

degrees resulting in a reduction in their potential peak gape size (Figure 2). This suggests that

401

scale-eaters have evolved more obtuse lower jaw angles during strikes to increase feeding

402

performance (Figures 3&4).

403
404

Scale-eating performance optimum

405

Scale-eaters may have reduced their lower jaw angles relative to other species in order to remain

406

on a performance optimum for scale-eating. Our models of bite performance supported this: peak

407

gapes larger than approximately 4.5 mm counterintuitively resulted in smaller bite sizes (Figure

408

3A&B). An enlarged angle in scale-eating pupfish results in a lower jaw that points directly

409

towards the prey during strikes – possibly resulting in greater stability for biting scales while

410

retaining a large gape (Figure 2). This large gape and unique jaw alignment may allow scale-

411

eaters to attack prey from a roughly perpendicular angle (as frequently observed during field

412

observations) —appearing to wrap their large lower jaw under prey items and subsequently

413

scraping scales from their sides using their independently protrusible upper jaws (also observed

414

in a scale-eating characin: Hata et al. 2011). Interestingly, perpendicular angles of attack and

415

large gapes are associated with scraping in benthic feeding fish (Van Wassenbergh et al. 2008;

416

O’Neill and Gibb 2013). In fact, one prominent hypothesis for the origins of scale-eating is that it

417

arose from an algae-scraping ancestor (Sazima et al. 1983). One caveat for this hypothesis,

418

however, is that our current performance estimates do not include all possible combinations of

419

peak gape and lower jaw angle and few observations of the largest peak gape sizes. Future work

420

should estimate performance across multiple performance axes (e.g. Stayton 2019, Keren et al.

421

2018, Dickson and Pierce 2019), ideally using F2 hybrids. F2 hybrids are a useful tool for this

422

type of experiment, as they are the first generation of offspring where recombination has the

423

potential to produce new combinations of kinematic, morphological, and behavioral traits not

424

observed in the F0 or F1 generations.

425
426

Non-additive F1 hybrid feeding kinematics may contribute to reproductive isolation of

427

scale-eaters

428

It is well documented that complex performance traits, such as feeding kinematics, are most

429

likely controlled by numerous loci (i.e. polygenic), and can mostly be described as additive

430

(reviewed in Sella and Barton 2019). We therefore expected F1 hybrids to exhibit intermediate

431

kinematics and performance relative to both parental species. Instead, we found that F1 hybrid

432

kinematics more closely resembled generalists (Table 1; Figure 1) and that their estimated bite

433

sizes are slightly below additive estimates (additive prediction= 341.48, predicted = 289.72, P =

434

0.058) suggesting that F1 hybrids may have higher performance in a generalist trophic niche.

435

Current evidence from field fitness experiments supports the idea that hybrid pupfish exhibit

436

better performance in the generalist ecological niche compared to their performance in the scale-

437

eater niche. One field experiment in these lakes measured hybrid fitness in the wild and found

438

high mortality and low growth rates for hybrids most closely resembling the scale-eating

439

phenotype (Martin and Wainwright 2013b). Furthermore, for the few hybrids resembling scale-

440

eaters which did survive, only 36% had recently consumed any scales compared to 92% of wild-

441

caught scale-eaters (Martin and Wainwright 2013a,b). Impaired hybrid performance in the scale-

442

eating niche may contribute to extrinsic postzygotic isolation between species (McGhee et al.

19

443

2007; McGee et al. 2013; Higham et al. 2016). Reproductive isolation may also evolve more

444

quickly in species that occupy a more distant fitness peak with a larger fitness valley such as the

445

scale-eating pupfish due to stronger selection against hybrids and reinforced pre-mating isolation

446

(Martin and Feinstein 2014). Thus, impaired hybrid scale-eating performance could also

447

contribute to increased diversification rates through the mechanism of a wider fitness valley.

448

Low hybrid performance may also be due to the morphological differences between scale-

449

eaters and generalists. As mentioned above, it is possible that a shift in morphology – such as

450

enlarged oral jaws in scale-eaters—may be sufficient to change kinematic profiles alone. F1

451

hybrid kinematics clearly differed from scale-eater kinematics, but their jaw lengths were also

452

significantly smaller than the jaws of scale-eaters (Tukey’s HSD, P = 5.21x10-5). Furthermore,

453

previous work has shown that F1 hybrid pupfish offspring (produced from generalist x scale-

454

eater crosses) tend to develop along a more similar trajectory to their maternal parent (Holtmeier

455

2001). This could indicate that F1 hybrid pupfish with scale-eating mothers are more likely to

456

develop jaws resembling a purebred scale-eater, but may also retain their generalist-like

457

kinematics. The resulting mismatch between morphology, kinematic traits, and ecological niche

458

may be driving low hybrid survival in the scale-eating niche and contributing to reproductive

459

isolation between generalist and scale-eating pupfish species.

460
461

Conclusion

462

In conclusion, this study suggests that shifts in kinematic traits may have preceded or facilitated

463

the origin of scale-eating in Cyprinodon pupfishes. Scale-eating pupfish exhibited peak gapes

464

that were twice as large as other pupfish species, but simultaneously had lower jaw angles that

465

were significantly larger. Surprisingly, we found that this unique combination of scale-eater

466

kinematics may reside on a performance optimum, as large peak gapes and large lower jaw

467

angles resulted in larger surface areas removed per strike. Impaired F1 hybrid kinematics and

468

performance in the scale-eating niche also suggests that kinematic traits contribute to

469

reproductive isolation of the scale-eating pupfish and the evolution of novelty. Future work

470

should investigate if other performance optima exist on the kinematic landscape and whether F2

471

hybrid fitness in the wild is reduced due to a mismatch between morphology and feeding

472

kinematics.
