Abstract

35

The gut microbiome is an integral part of a species’ ecology, but we know little about how host characteristics

36

impact its development in wild populations. Here, we explored the role of such intrinsic factors in shaping the gut

37

microbiome of northern elephant seals during a critical developmental window of six weeks after weaning, when

38

the pups stay ashore without feeding. We show that the early-life gut microbiome is already substantially different

39

in male and female pups, even though males and females cannot yet be distinguished morphologically. Sex and

40

age both explain around 15% of the variation in gut microbial beta diversity, while microbial communities sampled

41

from the same individual show high levels of similarity across time, explaining another 40% of the variation. Only

42

a small proportion of the variation in beta diversity is explained by health status, but healthy individuals have a

43

greater microbial alpha diversity than their non-healthy peers. Across the post-weaning period, the elephant seal

44

gut microbiome is highly dynamic. We found evidence for several colonisation and extinction events as well as a

45

decline in Bacteriodes and an increase in Prevotella, a pattern that has previously been associated with the

46

transition from nursing to solid food. Lastly, we show that genetic relatedness is correlated with gut microbiome

47

similarity in males but not females, again reflecting substantial early sex-differences. Our study represents a

48

naturally diet-controlled and longitudinal investigation of how intrinsic factors shape the early gut microbiome in

49

a species with extreme sex differences in morphology and life history.

Introduction

53

Vertebrates are inhabited by vast numbers of microbes that are increasingly emerging as key players in their host’s

54

biology and evolution (Bik et al., 2016; Ley et al., 2008; McFall-Ngai et al., 2013; Moeller et al., 2014). The

55

richest and arguably most complex microbial communities are those that populate the gastrointestinal tract and

56

which are collectively termed the ‘gut microbiome’. Gut microbes benefit their host in many ways, such as

57

promoting the development of organs, assisting nutrient uptake and priming and modulating the immune system

58

(Cheesman, Neal, Mittge, Seredick, & Guillemin, 2011; Heijtz et al., 2011; Lathrop et al., 2011; Zhu, Wu, Dai,

59

Zhang, & Wei, 2011). Consequently, disturbances to the gut microbiome can have severe consequences for the

60

host, ranging from autoimmune diseases and infections to obesity (Giongo et al., 2011; Round & Mazmanian,

61

2009; Turnbaugh, Bäckhed, Fulton, & Gordon, 2008).

63

The gut microbiome is highly dynamic across space and time and can be influenced by many factors. On a broader

64

scale, the strongest determinants of the gut microbiome appear to be phylogeny and diet, both of which can result

65

in remarkably different bacterial communities across host species (Bik et al., 2016; Ley et al., 2008; Muegge et

66

al., 2011). On a finer scale, differences in the gut microbiome within species can be shaped by a combination of

67

environmental factors such as diet, location and season, behavioural factors such as social networks, and heritable

68

factors such as host genetics (Benson et al., 2010; Kurilshikov, Wijmenga, Fu, & Zhernakova, 2017; Moeller et

69

al., 2014; Ren et al., 2017; Tung et al., 2015). However, most studies to date have focused on animals held in

70

captivity, which can influence microbial communities due to factors such as controlled and less diverse diets (Hird,

71

2017). Consequently, relatively little is known about the composition, development and function of the gut

72

microbiome in the wild, despite its potential to contribute to our fundamental understanding of the ecology and

73

evolutionary biology of mutualistic symbiotic relationships (Hird, 2017; Zilber-Rosenberg & Rosenberg, 2008).

74
75

The mammalian foetal gut is considered to be largely sterile, although there is recent evidence of uterine bacterial

76

translocation to the foetus (Chen & Gur, 2019; Perez-Muñoz, Arrieta, Ramer-Tait, & Walter, 2017). During and

77

after birth, the gut becomes rapidly colonised by various microbes. In these early stages of life, the gut microbiome

78

is of tremendous importance and disturbances can impact host development and impair metabolism, health and

79

immune function (Candon et al., 2015; Cho et al., 2012; Cox et al., 2014; Macpherson & Harris, 2004; Russell et

80

al., 2012). It is therefore of interest to investigate changes in the microorganisms that populate the gut during an

81

individual’s development. Across the life-span of an organism, ontogeny appears to influence the composition of

82

the gut microbiome in a species-specific manner (Clark et al., 2015; Langille et al., 2014; O’Toole & Jeffery,

83

2015). For example, bacterial diversity increases throughout early development in humans, chickens, pigs and

84

ostriches (Ballou et al., 2016; Frese, Parker, Calvert, & Mills, 2015; Kundu, Blacher, Elinav, & Pettersson, 2017;

85

Videvall et al., 2019), but decreases during maturation in zebrafish and African turquoise killifish (Smith et al.,

86

2017; Stephens et al., 2016). A mixed pattern has been observed in mice, where an early drop in diversity after the

87

initial transmission of maternal microbiota is followed by an increase after the introduction of solid food (Pantoja-

88

Feliciano et al., 2013). However, to our knowledge, patterns of microbial colonisation during early development

89

in wild animals are as yet largely unknown (Ren et al., 2017).

91

Every species’ life-history is characterised by a series of challenges to which an organism must adapt, both

92

physiologically and behaviourally. A key element facilitating these adaptations might be the microbiome. A

93

particularly strong factor driving within-species variation in microbial communities could be sex, as males and

94

females often experience contrasting selection pressures due to differences in their behaviour and physiology

95

(Tarka, Guenther, Niemelä, Nakagawa, & Noble, 2018). Several of these differences might be directly or indirectly

96

associated with the gut microbiome, such as sex-specific immune responses (Klein & Flanagan, 2016) or sex-

97

specific foraging behaviour (Boeuf et al., 2000; Boinski, 1988; Lewis et al., 2002). Surprisingly given the

98

important role of sex-specific microbiota in humans (Markle et al., 2013), the impact of sex on the gut microbiome

99

of wild vertebrates seems to be non-existent or very small (Bennett et al., 2016; Bobbie, Mykytczuk, & Schulte-

100

Hostedde, 2017; Maurice et al., 2015; Ren et al., 2017; Tung et al., 2015). However, gut microbiome studies of

101

wild populations are likely to be impacted by environmental factors that can rarely be controlled for and which

102

could potentially mask any effects of intrinsic factors such as sex.

103
104

Another largely open question for natural populations is how host genotype affects the gut microbiome. Most

105

insights to date come from twin studies in humans or from different strains of laboratory mice and suggest that the

106

influence of host genetics is modest compared to environmental effects (Kurilshikov et al., 2017). However, most

107

free-ranging animal populations carry greater levels of genetic variation than inbred laboratory stocks and their

108

microbiota may also be more complex, which could potentially lead to stronger covariation between host genotype

109

and microbial community composition. Nevertheless, quantifying the impact of host genetics on the gut

110

microbiome in the wild is challenging, at least in part because of the need to control for environmental effects (Bik

111

et al., 2016; Perofsky, Lewis, Abondano, Di Fiore, & Meyers, 2017; Tung et al., 2015) that may might blur any

112

genetic signal. Consequently, it remains unclear whether host genetics influences the gut microbiome in natural

113

populations, despite the importance of this question in the light of host-microbe evolution.

114
115

An ideal opportunity to investigate the intrinsic factors that shape the gut microbiome in the wild is provided by

116

the northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris). Northern elephant seals are among the most sexually

117

dimorphic of all mammals, with males being 3-4 times heavier than females (Wilson & Mittermeier, 2014). The

118

mating system of this species is highly polygynous, with only a handful of successful males copulating with dozens

119

of females in a given season (Burney J. Le Boeuf & Laws, 1994). Consequently, males and females face very

120

different challenges: during the breeding season, males must continuously defend their harems against competitors,

121

while females need to invest substantial amounts of energy into nursing their pups. Neither males nor females feed

122

during the breeding season, with some males fasting for up to three months and females fasting for up to one

123

month, despite the high energetic investment required to provide high-fat milk to their young (Burney J. Le Boeuf

124

& Ortiz, 1977). Outside the breeding season, elephant seals spend most of their lives at sea, and even there, sex

125

differences are apparent. Adult males and females have very different foraging strategies, with males feeding on

126

benthic prey along the continental margin of North America, and females feeding largely on pelagic prey in deeper

127

waters (Boeuf et al., 2000). Consequently, elephant seals have developed a series of sex-specific adaptations to

128

these diverging life-histories, but it is not known yet whether or how the gut microbiome might be involved.

129
130

Here, we studied the gut microbiome of elephant seal pups over a 35-day post-weaning period commencing

131

immediately after their mothers stop nursing. This time-window is ideally suited to investigating the influence of

132

intrinsic factors on gut microbiomes because all northern elephant seal pups remain within their natal colonies

133

without feeding until they leave the rookery around seven weeks later (Reiter, Stinson, & Boeuf, 1978).

134

Consequently, variation in gut microbiome beta diversity (microbiome similarity between samples) and alpha

135

diversity (microbiome diversity within samples) should be largely driven by intrinsic factors such as sex,

136

developmental stage and health rather than by extrinsic factors such as habitat or dietary changes. We therefore

137

used repeated, longitudinal sampling of rectal swabs to characterise the early-life gut microbiome of the northern

138

elephant seal and to explore the factors driving variation in beta and alpha diversity, with a particular emphasis on

139

sex-differences, which may reflect early life-history adaptations. Lastly, we used microsatellite genotyping to test

140

the hypothesis that genetically more related individuals also host more similar gut microbiomes. Overall, our study

141

provides a rare glimpse into the early development of the gut microbiome in a natural population within a diet-

142

controlled setting that allowed us to evaluate intrinsic sources of microbial variation in the wild.

Study design and sample collection

146

We marked 40 northern elephant seal pups and their mothers during the breeding season in February/March 2017

147

at Benito del Oeste, the westernmost island of the San Benito Archipelago off the west coast of Baja California,

148

Mexico. We closely observed mother-offspring pairs in order to determine the weaning dates of each pup.

149

Weaning typically occurs close to 28 days after birth (Reiter et al., 1978) and marks the time that the mother

150

abandons her pup and returns to the sea. At this moment, we sampled the newly weaned pup (time point T1). To

151

analyse the gut microbiome composition, we took rectal swabs using FLOQSwabsTM, which were immediately

152

stored in 70% EtOH, frozen at -20˚C within a few hours after collection and subsequently stored at -80˚C shortly

153

after the end of the field season. To determine the genetic relatedness of individuals, we collected a small skin

154

sample (9 mm2) from the flipper of each pup and stored these individually in sterile cryogenic vials containing

155

70% EtOH. The vials were frozen at -20˚C within a few hours after collection and were subsequently stored at -

156

80˚C. During the T1 sampling period, we collected rectal swabs and skin samples from 40 pups, which were

157

marked with plastic flipper tags with a unique ID number. Subsequently, we observed these pups on a daily basis

158

and captured them after 15 days (T2) and 30 days (T3) to collect two additional rectal swabs for microbial profiling.

159

The entire sampling scheme spanned the two-month long fasting period during which the weaned pups stay ashore

160

(Reiter et al., 1978). We sampled blood from each individual to assess its health status at T1 and T3, Briefly, blood

161

was collected from the extradural intervertebral vein, using a vacuum blood collection device with a 18 G needle.

162

Blood samples were preserved with EDTA and were used to determine the total and differential leukocyte counts

163

as has been described previously (Flores-Morán et al., 2017). Throughout the field season, we lost six of the

164

marked pups, as one died between T1 and T2, one between T2 and T3, one was not found after T1 and three pups

165

were lost after T2, despite intensive searching effort. Thus, sample sizes were 40 pups at T1, 38 at T2, and 34 at

166

T3. All sampling was conducted with the approval of the Bioethics Committee and IACUC of the Autonomous

167

University of Queretaro, and all capture and sampling procedures were carried out under permit DGVS 00091 /17

168

issued by the Mexican Secretariat of the Environment and Natural Resources.

169
170

Host DNA extraction and microsatellite genotyping

171

Total genomic DNA was extracted from skin samples using a standard chloroform extraction protocol and

172

genotyped at 21 previously developed microsatellite loci (see Supplementary Information for details). We tested

173

all of the microsatellite loci for deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) using exact tests based on

174

Monte Carlo simulations implemented in pegas (Paradis, 2010) and applied a false discovery rate correction

175

(Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995) to the resulting p-values. All 21 loci were retained in the final dataset as no locus

176

was out of HWE.

Bacterial DNA extraction, library preparation and sequencing

We extracted DNA from 112 rectal swabs using the QIAamp PowerFecal DNA Kit (Qiagen), and amplified a 300

MyTaq DNA polymerase (Bioline) and 2 μl of BioStabII PCR Enhancer (Sigma). For each sample, the forward

185

and reverse primers had the same 10-nt barcode sequence. PCRs were carried out for 30 cycles of 1 min 96°C pre-

186

denaturation; 96°C for 15 s, 50°C for 30 s, 70°C for 90 s. The DNA concentration of the amplicons of interest was

187

determined by gel electrophoresis. About 20 ng of amplicon DNA of each sample was pooled for up to 48 samples

188

carrying different barcodes. The amplicon pools were purified with one volume of AMPure XP beads (Agencourt)

189

to remove primer dimer and other small miss-priming products, followed by an additional purification on

190

MiniElute columns (Qiagen). About 100 ng of each purified amplicon pool DNA was used to construct Illumina

191

selected by preparative gel electrophoresis. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq platform using V3

206

We used DADA2 1.8 (Benjamin J. Callahan et al., 2016) for further filtering and processing the sequences into

207

Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), following the authors’ published workflow (Ben J. Callahan, Sankaran,

208

Fukuyama, McMurdie, & Holmes, 2016). Unlike the traditional grouping into operational taxonomic units

209

(OTUs), ASVs are exact sequence variants and have the compelling advantages of higher taxonomic resolution as

210

well as reproducibility and reusability across studies (Benjamin J. Callahan, McMurdie, & Holmes, 2017). After

211

visually inspecting the quality profiles of all reads, we used DADA2’s filterAndTrim function to trim R1 and R2

212

sequences to 220 and 230 base pairs respectively and to filter all reads with more than two expected errors (Edgar

213

& Flyvbjerg, 2015). As DADA2 relies on a parametric error model, we used the learnErrors function to evaluate

214

error rates from the data and visually confirmed that the resulting error rate estimates provided a good fit to the

215

observed rates using plotErrors (Ben J. Callahan et al., 2016). After dereplication with derepFastq, we used the

216

dada function for correcting substitution and indel errors as well as for sample inference based on the pooled

217

samples. Subsequently, we merged forward and reverse reads with a minimum overlap of 12 bp using mergePairs

218

and constructed a sequence table with makeSequenceTable. After inspecting the distribution of sequence lengths

219

across samples and considering a median full amplicon size of around 460 bp prior to primer clipping (Klindworth

220

et al., 2013), primer-clipped sequences of lengths between 380 and 450 bp were retained. As a last filtering step,

221

we removed chimeras with removeBimeraDenovo using the consensus method. We assigned taxa to the ASVs

222

using the assignTaxonomy and addSpecies functions based on the SILVA database v128 (Quast et al., 2012). The

223

resulting ASV table contained 2809 ASVs in 112 samples.

224
225

Clinical assessment of health

226

For each blood smear, we quantified the differential white blood cell populations by counting the number of

227

lymphocytes, neutrophils, band neutrophils, hypersegmented neutrophils, monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils,

228

in 100 leukocytes. Absolute numbers for each leucocyte type were calculated by multiplying the total white blood

229

cell count, previously determined by the use of a Neubauer chamber, by the proportion of each leucocyte type.

230

Based on the clinical reference values previously reported for clinically healthy northern elephant seal pups

231

(Bossart, Reidarson, Dierauf, & Duffield, 2001; Yochem, Stewart, Mazet, & Boyce, 2008) we classified the

232

clinical health status of each pup as either healthy (i.e. none of the leukocyte types deviated from the normal

233

ranges) or not-healthy (i.e. at least one cell type was out of the normal range).

235

Data processing and analyses

236

Microbial data

237

All subsequent analyses were conducted in R version 3.4.3 (R Core Team). As a first filtering step after taxonomic

238

assignment, we discarded ASVs classified as mitochondria (n = 3) or chloroplasts (n = 8) together with ASVs that

239

could not be identified at the Class level (n = 77), as these are more likely to contain sequencing errors. Based on

240

a visual assessment of ASV abundance and prevalence (Supplementary Figure 5), we then removed ASVs that did

241

not appear in at least three samples (n = 982) or which had a total read count below 30 across all samples (n =

242

683).

243

Overall, 1063 ASVs were retained across all 112 samples in the filtered dataset. Before analysing microbiome

244

similarities across groups, we applied the variance stabilising transformation (VST) in DESeq2 (Love, Huber, &

245

Anders, 2014), which uses a negative binomial mixed model to account for differences in library size across

246

samples and to disentangle the relationship between the variance and the mean inherent to count data. Compared

247

to other normalisation and transformation methods traditionally applied to microbiome data, the VST has the

248

advantage of using all of the available data and is therefore preferable both to rarefying approaches (McMurdie &

249

Holmes, 2014) and to transforming the data into relative abundances, which still has the problem of

250

heteroscedasticity (Love et al., 2014). Based on the VS transformed data, we calculated Bray-Curtis dissimilarities

251

(Bray & Curtis, 1957) among samples to visualise group differences using principle coordinate analysis (PCoA).

252

We then statistically evaluated the microbiome composition in relation to sex, time point, host ID and health status

253

using permutational multivariate analyses of variance (PERMANOVA, Anderson, 2001) with 1000 permutations

254

using the adonis function in vegan (Oksanen et al., 2017). This approach is analogous to a parametric analysis of

255

variance as that it partitions distance matrices into sources of variation and produces a pseudo-F value, the

256

significance of which can be determined using a permutation test. As group differences detected using a

257

PERMANOVA can be caused by variation in dispersion across groups rather than differences in mean values

258

(Anderson, 2001), we tested for homogeneity of group dispersions using betadisper in vegan (Anderson, 2001;

259

Oksanen et al., 2017) with post-hoc comparisons between specific contrasts evaluated with Tukey’s ‘honest

260

significant differences’ method.

261
262

A main interest in microbial research is to determine the specific bacterial taxa that differ among groups. We

263

therefore used the filtered but untransformed ASV data in combination with the DESeq2 method to determine

264

differential abundances (Love et al., 2014). DESeq2 models abundance data such as microbial counts using a

265

negative binomial distribution, estimates log fold changes between groups based on the specified model, and

266

corrects the resulting p-values with a Benjamini and Hochberg false-discovery rate correction (Benjamini &

267

Hochberg, 1995). As our ASV count matrix contained at least one zero in every row, we calculated the underlying

268

size factors using the ‘poscounts’ estimator, which excludes zeros when calculating the geometric mean. To extract

269

the appropriate group-specific contrasts, we fitted three different models and used a threshold of p < 0.01 to detect

270

significant ASVs. Specifically, for analysing differential abundances between time points but within a given sex,

271

the first two models contained ASV data for just females and just males respectively, while fitting both individual

272

and time point in the model. To analyse and extract between-sex contrasts within each sampling time point, we

273

constructed a third model by creating a new grouping factor as a combination of time point and sex, which was

274

then fitted as predictor variable in the model.

275
276

To quantify which factors influence alpha diversity, we calculated Shannon indices based on the unfiltered and

277

untransformed ASVs (2809 ASVs across 112 samples) to not bias the estimates by trimming rare ASVs, as

278

suggested in the phyloseq tutorial (McMurdie & Holmes, 2013). Then we fitted a first Gaussian mixed model in

279

lme4 (Bates, Mächler, Bolker, & Walker, 2014) with Shannon diversity as response, sex and time point as fixed

280

effects and host ID as random effect. As we could only assess the health of the individuals at time point T1 and

281

T3, during which we sampled blood, we fitted a second Gaussian mixed model including data from only these two

282

time points with Shannon diversity as response, health status (healthy vs. not healthy), sex and time point as fixed

283

effects and individual as random effect. We calculated the R2 based on (Nakagawa & Schielzeth, 2013) and 95%

284

confidence intervals around the R2 and the model estimates using parametric bootstrapping with 1000 replications.

285

The individual adjusted repeatability including 95% CI was estimated with rptR (Stoffel, Nakagawa, & Schielzeth,

286

2017) using the same model structure and 1000 bootstraps.

287
288

Genetic relatedness and microbial similarity

289

We estimated pairwise genetic relatedness based on 21 microsatellite loci using the R package Demerelate

290

(Kraemer & Gerlach, 2013). We used the Loiselle estimator (Loiselle, Sork, Nason, & Graham, 1995) which is

291

unbiased for small sample sizes and converged towards stable values for the number of loci used in this study

292

(Supplementary Figure 6). To match the microbial data to the pairwise genetic relatedness matrix containing 40

293

individuals for further analyses, we merged the microbial data across the three time points for every individual by

294

summing up the ASV abundances. The 40 merged microbiome samples were then transformed using the variance-

295

stabilising transformation in DEseq2 before calculating Bray-Curtis dissimilarities. Both the genetic relatedness

296

matrix and the microbial dissimilarity matrix were then split by sex to calculate their correlation using a Mantel

297

test implemented in the ecodist package (Goslee & Urban, 2007) using 10,000 bootstraps with the default

298

resampling level of 0.9 to calculate confidence intervals and 10,000 permutations to test for statistical significance.

299

We furthermore wanted to test for a difference in slopes between males and females, which is not possible using

300

Mantel tests. Consequently, we fitted a simple linear model of microbiome similarity that included an interaction

301

term between relatedness and sex. In this model, we essentially treated pairwise comparisons as data points, which

302

makes the normal p-value meaningless due to pseudo-replication in the data. We therefore estimated the interaction

303

slope and its confidence interval using parametric bootstrapping, and determined the corresponding p-value by

304

randomly permuting the relatedness vector and re-fitting the model. This resulted in a distribution of interaction

305

estimates and yielded the probability of seeing an effect as strong or stronger than the observed effect by chance.

306
307

We investigated the proportion of gut microbiota that are impacted by host genetics using a subsampling exercise.

308

We began by calculating microbial similarities from the two most abundant ASVs and determining the strength of

309

correlation of the resulting microbial similarity matrix with genetic relatedness. We then iteratively repeated this

310

procedure while always adding the next two most abundant ASVs until we reached the complete dataset containing

311

1064 ASVs. Lastly, we wanted to know whether the correlation between genetic relatedness and microbial

312

similarity changed across the three time points and if it differed between sexes. We therefore used the original

313

unmerged dataset and subsetted both the microbial and genetic datasets six times to calculate and visualize the

314

correlation for all three time points and both sexes.

316

Results

317

To investigate the development of the gut microbiome in young northern elephant seals, we collected rectal swab

318

samples from 40 animals during three time points after weaning. We started sampling immediately after their

319

mothers stopped nursing and returned to the sea (time point T1) and then resampled each individual after two (T2)

320

and four weeks (T3). The individuals were on average 28, 43 and 58 days old at time points T1, T2 and T3

321

respectively. As a few animals were lost or found dead during the study period (see Materials and methods for

322

details), our final sample comprised a total of 112 rectal swabs across three time points for which we quantified

323

bacterial communities using 16S rRNA sequencing. After assembling the raw reads into amplicon sequence

324

variants (ASVs), we retained 1063 ASVs with an average of 286 ± 67 ASVs (mean ± sd) per sample.

325
326

Characterization of the gut microbiome

327

Overall, the main bacterial phyla that we identified were typical of a mammalian gut microbiome (Figure 1), with

328

the majority of ASVs belonging to the phyla Bacteroidetes (mean ± sd = 34% ± 2%), Firmicutes (mean ± sd =

329

29% ± 1%), Fusobacteria (mean ± sd = 19% ± 3%), and Proteobacteria (mean ± sd = 13% ± 1%). The relative

330

abundances of these four phyla remained relatively stable over time, except for the Fusobacteria, which decreased

331

steadily during weaning (Figure 1). However, at a finer taxonomic scale, we observed substantial changes across

332

the three time points (see below).

333
334

335

time points. The sampling time points T1, T2 and T3 correspond to individuals at 28, 43 and 58 days of age,

336

respectively. Rare phyla with relative abundances below 1% are not shown. White columns represent individuals

337

that either died or were lost during the course of the study.

338
339

The core microbiome across individuals at different ages

340

We characterised the core microbiome at different developmental stages during the weaning period by extracting

341

ASVs that appeared in at least 95% of samples at each time point (Supplementary Tables 1–3). Directly after

342

weaning (T1), we identified 21 core ASVs, with two ASVs from the genera Fusobacterium and Bacteroides

343

making up more than 25% of the average microbiome across individuals. This pattern changed substantially at T2

344

and T3. Here, we identified 15 and 35 core ASVs respectively, but the dominance of the two ASVs from T1

345

disappeared. Instead, a taxon from the genus Ezakiella, which only emerged after T1, became the most dominant

346

ASV during T2 and T3 (with an average of 4% relative abundance). This is a recently discovered genus, of which

347

only two species have been described; one from fecal samples of a coastal human indigeneous Peruvian population

348

(Patel et al., 2015) and one from the human female genital tract (Diop, Raoult, Bretelle, & Fenollar, 2017). Closer

349

to the time of nutritional independence (T3), a taxon from the genus Prevotella became the most successful new

350

colonizer and the second most abundant genus. Concurrently, an ASV from the genus Bacteroides, which initially

351

was the second most abundant taxon, decreased substantially in relative abundance (Supplementary Table 3,

352

Supplementary Figure 4).

353
354
355

Sex, age, host ID and health effects on gut microbiome beta diversity.

356

To explore the major determinants of gut microbiome similarity across samples (beta diversity), we used a

357

multidimensional scaling plot (MDS) of Bray-Curtis similarities between bacterial samples for visualisation and

358

PERMANOVA (Anderson, 2001) for statistical analysis. Figure 2A shows variation due to sex and sampling time

359

point (i.e. the age of individuals). Along the first axis, which accounts for 28.5% of the multidimensional spread

360

in the data, a visible transition is apparent from the moment of weaning (T1) to the last sampling point (T3), shortly

361

before the seals depart to the sea for feeding on their own, with samples from T2 being intermediate. A strong

362

separation is also visible along axis 2, which accounts for 13.4% of the variation and reveals substantial differences

363

in gut microbiome composition between the two sexes across the three sampling time points. Furthermore,

364

microbiome samples from the same host cluster together, showing intra-individual consistency of gut microbial

365

communities across the weaning-period (Figure 2B). Lastly, Figure 2C shows no or very little visible clustering

366

of gut microbiome samples within healthy and non-healthy individuals, respectively.

367
368

To statistically analyse microbial group differences we fitted two PERMANOVA models which partition the

369

microbial similarity matrix into variance components. The first model included sampling time point, sex and host

370

ID as predictors of microbial similarity and included samples across all three time points. Overall, time point and

371

sex each explain around 15% of the variation in microbial similarities (age: R2 = 0.15, p < 0.001, sex: R2 = 0.15,

372

p < 0.001), while microbiome samples from the same host are also more similar, with host ID explaining 40% of

13

373

the variation (R2 = 0.40, p < 0.001). After fitting the model with all of the samples, we analysed sex-differences

374

within each time point post-hoc to avoid potential effects of repeated measures and to shed light on sex-specific

375

patterns over time. The difference in gut microbiome between composition between males and females is already

376

substantial at the time of weaning (T1: R2 = 0.13, p < 0.001), and further increases in the following weeks (T2: R2

377

= 0.26, p < 0.001, T3: R2 = 0.21, p < 0.001). Lastly, we compared specific time points post-hoc, while still fitting

378

sex and host ID in the model. The transition from T1 to T2 explains 10.3% of the variation (R2 = 0.10, p < 0.001)

379

while 4.1% is explained by microbial differences between T2 and T3 (R2 = 0.04, p < 0.001).

380

The second model included health status, sampling time point, sex and host ID as predictors of microbial similarity

381

but was based only on samples from time points T1 and T3, during which we took blood samples to assess the

382

health status of the individuals. Half of the pups sampled at T1 were clinically healthy, while most of the remaining

383

pups had neutropenia (low levels of neutrophils) and lymphocytosis (high levels of lymphocytes), and 5% showed

384

the opposite pattern, exhibiting neutrophilia and mild monocytosis. At T2, 39% of the pups had neutropenia and

385

lymphocytosis, and only one pup had neutrophilia and mild monocytosis. Overall, health status only explained a

386

negligible part of the overall variation in beta diversity (R2 = 0.025, p = 0.004). Consistent with the results from

387

the first model, sex, time point and host ID each had large effects (age: R2 = 0.21, p < 0.001, sex: R2 = 0.11, p <

388

0.001, host ID: R2 = 0.44, p < 0.001). When comparing healthy and non-healthy individuals within each time point,

389

the differences are slightly stronger at T1 (R2 = 0.06, p = 0.008) compared to T3 (R2 = 0.04, p = 0.116). The

390

PERMANOVA assumption of multivariate homogeneity of group variances was met across all tests, as none of

391

the contrasted groups differed in their dispersions (all p > 0.05). Consequently, all PERMANOVA results reflect

392

differences in mean values across groups rather than differences in group dispersions (Anderson, 2001).

411

dynamics, including multiple colonization and extinction events and often contrasting patterns at different

412

taxonomic level. To quantify differences at the highest possible resolution, we tested for differentially abundant

413

ASVs across time points and sexes using the DESeq2 method (Love et al., 2014). We provide a detailed description

414

of all differential abundances in the Supplementary Material 2. Overall, the majority of significant changes in

415

microbial abundances for both females and males happened between T1 and T2 (F: n = 100, M: n = 106) with less

416

than half as many ASVs changing in abundance from T2 to T3 (F: n = 43, M: n = 26). Most of the ASVs that

417

changed over time belonged to the Clostridia and Bacteroidia in both sexes (see Supplementary Figure 8). The

418

number of differentially abundant ASVs between males and females was similarly large at all time points (T1: n

419

= 96, T2: n = 102, T3: n = 80, see Supplementary Figure 9), and more than a third belonged to the Clostridia

420

Family XI and the family Ruminococcaceae. However, while the overall number of differentially abundant ASVs

421

between the sexes remained fairly similar throughout weaning, their taxonomic diversity appeared to increase

422

(Supplementary Figure 9).

423
424

Sex, age, host ID and health effects on gut microbiome alpha diversity.

425

Microbial alpha diversity is frequently quantified in microbiome studies and is usually found to change during the

426

development of vertebrates (Clark et al., 2015; O’Toole & Jeffery, 2015; Videvall et al., 2019). As a measure of

427

alpha diversity, we used the Shannon index, which takes both species richness and the relative abundances of

428

different species into account. To investigate the factors impacting microbial diversity across all three time points,

429

we constructed a Gaussian mixed model of Shannon diversity with sex and sampling time point fitted as fixed

430

effects and host ID as a random effect. The model only explained a small proportion of the variation in diversity

431

(R2 = 0.06, 95% CI [0.01, 0.18]) but revealed a higher diversity for males than for females (b = 0.20, 95% CI

432

[0.03, 0.39]). Moreover, Shannon diversity was stable across the post-weaning period and did not change between

433

any two time points (T2 vs. T1: (b = 0.12, 95% CI [-0.10, 0.34], T3 vs. T1: b = 0.12, 95% CI [-0.07, 0.34]). These

434

patterns are shown as boxplots alongside the raw data points in Figure 3. Contrary to microbial composition (beta

435

diversity), where samples from the same host were more similar over time than between hosts, the alpha diversity

436

of samples from the same individuals was not repeatable across time points (r = 0.1, 95% CI [0.00, 0.3]).

437

We then modelled the association between microbiome diversity and health status of individuals using a mixed

438

model that only included data from the two time points in which we sampled blood and assessed the health of

439

individuals. We fitted sex, health status and time point as fixed effects and host ID as a random effect. Healthy

440

individuals hosted more diverse microbiomes than non-healthy individuals (b = 0.32, 95% CI [0.08, 0.55]), males

441

had a slightly higher diversity than females (b = 0.15, 95% CI [-0.10, 0.40]) and the diversity was slightly higher

442

at T3 than at T1 (b = 0.18, 95% CI [-0.04, 0.41]). Notably, this analysis suggests that the difference in diversity

443

between males and females can be partially explained by a difference in the average health status of the two sexes,

444

with the proportion of healthy individuals being higher in males (T1: F = 37%, M = 60%, T3: F = 33%, M = 44

445

%). Overall, this model explained slightly more variation in alpha diversity (R2 = 0.14, 95% CI [0.05, 0.36])

Association between genetic relatedness and beta diversity

455

A fundamental topic in microbial ecology is the importance of host genotype for the formation of the gut

456

microbiome. We approached this question by quantifying the correlation between host genetic relatedness and

457

microbial similarity (Figure 4). Mantel tests showed a significant association in males (r = 0.26, CI [0.17, 0.34], p

458

= 0.0013), which was visible across all three time points (Supplementary Figure 1). By contrast, we found no

459

relationship in females, either overall (r = 0.06, CI [0.00, 0.12], p = 0.41) or within each time point (Supplementary

460

Figure 4). As a difference in significance is not always a significant difference, we fitted a linear model to test for

461

differences between the sex-specific slopes by fitting an interaction between relatedness and sex, with microbial

462

dissimilarity as the response. The interaction term estimate was also negative (β = -0.11, CI [-0.23, -0.006], p =

463

0.02), indicating that microbial dissimilarity is more negatively correlated with genetic relatedness in males than

464

in females.

465
466

To further investigate the effect of host relatedness on microbial similarity, we evaluated how many bacterial taxa

467

are influenced by host genetics. We calculated the mantel correlation between genetic relatedness and microbial

468

similarity based on an increasing number of ASVs, starting with the two most abundant (relative abundance) and

469

iteratively increasing the number by the next two most abundant ASVs until we reached the full dataset (Figure

470

5). For females, the pattern across all subsets reflected the results from the full dataset and did not show a

471

significant association between genetic relatedness and bacterial similarity. For males, a small number of ASVs

472

contributed strongly to the overall correlation, but a peak in Mantel’s r was not reached until the 300 most abundant

473

ASVs were included in the analysis. This suggests that a large proportion of taxa are at least slightly impacted by

474

the host genotype as they contribute iteratively to an increasingly strong correlation.

Discussion

Microbiome studies of wild populations are essential for gaining an understanding of the ecological and

494

evolutionary role of animal-microbe relationships (Hird, 2017). However, intrinsic effects on the gut microbiome

495

such as sex differences are difficult to study, partly because they might be small in the first place, but also because

496

environmental factors such as diet (David et al., 2014) may overshadow biological effects. Here, we studied an

497

animal with extreme sexual dimorphism and sex-specific life-history strategies, where we would expect intra-

498

species microbial variation to be large. Moreover, by sampling northern elephant seal weaners, which share the

499

same dietary history and which did not feed during the sampling period, our sampling design minimized microbial

500

variation due to diet, making it possible to provide a baseline assessment of the developing gut microbiome and

501

shed light on individual-specific factors impacting it, in particular sex, age, health status and genotype.

502
503

First of all, we showed that the northern elephant seal gut microbiome at the time of weaning is already relatively

504

complex with an average of nearly 300 ASVs per individual from 14 different phyla. Four of these phyla are highly

505

abundant, the Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, and Proteobacteria, and have previously been shown to

506

be the main phyla in most pinniped guts (Bik et al., 2016; Glad et al., 2010; Nelson, Rogers, & Brown, 2013;

507

Numberger, Herlemann, Jürgens, Dehnhardt, & Schulz-Vogt, 2016). However, their relative contribution varies

508

across studies, partly due to differences across species, but also probably due to differences in sampling methods

509

as well as environmental effects.

510
511

Patterns of early gut microbiome development are in general difficult to compare across mammals due to the small

512

number of studies that have conducted longitudinal sampling during early life. One mammal in which the gut

513

microbiome has been studied before and after weaning is the domestic pig, which shares some similarities to the

514

patterns we report here. First of all, the most abundant bacterial phyla in weaned pigs, as in this study, were

515

Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes (Pajarillo, Chae, Balolong, Kim, & Kang, 2014). Second, the dietary transition from

516

nursing to weaning was found to be reflected in a marked decrease in the genus Bacteroides combined with an

517

increase in Prevotella (Frese et al., 2015; Pajarillo et al., 2014), which we similarly observed in elephant seals.

518

Although the specific functions of these genera are still under debate (Gorvitovskaia, Holmes, & Huse, 2016),

519

Bacteroides have been shown to break down milk oligosaccharides and may therefore be important during nursing

520

(A. Marcobal & Sonnenburg, 2012; Angela Marcobal et al., 2011), while Prevotella are associated with plant

521

polysaccharide consumption and might therefore be important for the digestion of solid food (Ivarsson, Roos, Liu,

522

& Lindberg, 2014). Interestingly, although increases in Prevotella have previously been associated with the

523

transition to a solid diet (Frese et al., 2015), elephant seal weaners show an increase in Prevotella after weaning

524

despite the fact that they are fasting. One possible explanation for this pattern could be a role of Prevotella for

525

modulating immune tolerance instead of a diet-related function, which has previously been found in humans

526

(Larsen, 2017) .

527
528

Despite these changes in the composition of gut microbial communities, which include abundance changes as well

529

as colonisation and extinction events, the average alpha diversity of elephant seal gut microbiomes was relatively

530

stable throughout our study. This is surprising, as alpha diversity is usually quite dynamic across both shorter and

531

longer time scales (Ballou et al., 2016; Frese et al., 2015; Kundu et al., 2017; Videvall et al., 2019). Consequently,

532

the stability of gut microbial diversity observed in this study might be a consequence of the animals fasting during

533

the study period, as dietary changes can be a major source of new microbial diversity (Pantoja-Feliciano et al.,

534

2013).

536

In order to improve our understanding of host-microbe interactions in ecology and evolution, environmental

537

sources of microbial variation need to be disentangled from individual-specific sources of variation. Sex is an

538

important source of intraspecific differences, and hence a likely source of gut microbial variation. However, sex

539

differences in the gut microbiome have mostly been found to be negligible or non-existent in wild populations so

540

far (Bennett et al., 2016; Bobbie et al., 2017; Maurice et al., 2015; Ren et al., 2017; Tung et al., 2015). Although

541

sex-differences may truly be small in some species, it is also possible that the effects of external factors such as

542

diet or environment on gut microbial communities mask the effects of sex. In contrast to most of the literature, we

543

found sex to be a strong and early determinant of gut microbiome composition, but not diversity, in elephant seals.

544

In fact, sexual dimorphism in the gut microbiome composition precedes any morphological dimorphism, making

545

it a precursor to what later becomes an extreme morphological and behavioural sexual dimorphism in adult

546

elephant seals.

547
548

We found that apparent sex-differences in the gut microbiome alpha diversity (but not beta diversity) were largely

549

explained by a higher proportion of healthy pups in males than in females. Animals that were categorized as

550

healthy on the basis of their blood parameters possessed higher gut bacterial diversity than pups categorized as

551

non-healthy. Recent evidence suggests that the gut microbiome impacts systemic immune effectors, including the

552

development and output of circulating leukocytes (Grainger, Daw, & Wemyss, 2018) and other studies have shown

553

that microbiome composition can reflect specific clinical conditions (Kozik, Nakatsu, Chun, & Jones-Hall, 2019;

554

Pascal et al., 2017). Although none of the northern elephant seal pups we examined had evident signs of illness,

555

and the observed deviations from normal blood values were mild, it is likely that the pups categorized as ‘non-

556

healthy’ were suffering from some type of acute transient infection. Further investigation into associations between

557

the gut microbiome, systemic and local immune effectors, and specific diseases could help to improve our

558

understanding of links between clinical health and microbiome diversity. However, it is plausible that rather than

559

signalling a direct relationship between microbiome diversity and health, our results could be a reflection of early

560

sexual dimorphism in enteric immune tolerance, which would impact the establishment and stability of gut

561

microbial communities (Duerr & Hornef, 2012; Fulde & Hornef, 2014).

562
563

A parallel can be drawn between our results and those of a study of southern elephant seals, which also detected

564

sex specific differences in the gut microbiome (Nelson, Rogers, Carlini, & Brown, 2013). However, this particular

21

565

study focused on adults, which show extreme sexual size dimorphism as well as marked sex specific differences

566

in behaviour, diet and foraging behaviour, which would be expected to have strong effects on host associated

567

microbial communities (Hindell et al., 2016). By contrast, male and female northern elephant seal pups are not

568

visually distinguishable, and before our first sampling all pups remained close to their mothers to nurse, such that

569

variation in behaviour, diet and social interactions was negligible. Furthermore, there is evidence for an equal

570

maternal energy investment in female and male pups during nursing with respect to milk intake (Kretzmann, Costa,

571

& Le Boeuf, 1993) and offspring mass change (Deutsch, Crocker, Costa, & Le Boeuf, 1994). It is therefore

572

remarkable that males and females host very different gut microbiomes even directly after weaning, which could

573

be due to early sex-specific intestinal adaptations and is consistent with earlier findings that diet can have sex-

574

dependent effects on gut microbial communities (Bolnick et al., 2014). Whether sex-specific gut microbes are

575

early signs of adaptation related to different adult feeding strategies or other life-history challenges will need to be

576

examined in future studies.

577
578

A largely unanswered question is how strongly host genetics impacts the composition of the gut microbiome in

579

wild populations. In humans and mice, genome-wide association studies have shown that at least a small

580

proportion of the microbiome is genetically determined (Goodrich et al., 2016; Kurilshikov et al., 2017). It has

581

also been shown that genetically more similar humans harbour more similar gut microbial communities

582

(Zoetendal, Akkermans, Akkermans-van Vliet, de Visser, & de Vos, 2001), a pattern that seems difficult to

583

replicate in natural populations (Degnan et al., 2012). In the wild, however, environmental factors such as diet,

584

habitat or social behaviour are difficult to control for and are likely to mask any smaller, more subtle effects of

585

host genotype. In this study, we found that genetically related males hosted more similar gut microbiomes.

586

However, this was not the case in females, which also carry different gut microbiomes than males. This sex-

587

specific relatedness-microbiome association is visible also within each sampling time point and is robust to the

588

exclusion of a large number of microbial taxa. However, whether this difference is due to a temporal asymmetry

589

in microbiome development among females and males or reflects more permanent sex-specific physiological

590

mechanisms is still unclear.

593

Northern elephant seals exhibit some of the most extreme sex differences among any mammal, both

594

morphologically and in their life-histories. Here, we studied the gut microbiome and its development in northern

595

elephant seal pups, from the time when their mothers abandoned them to shortly before they themselves head out

596

to the open sea. Although morphologically speaking, male and female pups still cannot be distinguished apart

597

during this period, we could show that the sexual dimorphism in their gut microbiome composition is already

598

striking, a pattern that to our knowledge has not yet been found in any natural population and which is unlikely to

599

be attributed to differences in diet. Within a natural, diet-controlled setting, we also showed that gut microbiome

600

composition is associated with host genetic relatedness in males and changes substantially within only a few weeks

601

after the end of lactation, potentially anticipating the growing elephant seals’ change in diet and life-style.

602

Furthermore, we showed that health status has little impact on the beta diversity or composition of the microbiome

603

although the alpha diversity is lower in clinically non-healthy individuals. We conclude that future gut microbiome

604

studies of wild populations can benefit from species with large inter-individual variation such as northern elephant

605

seals, and that minimising environmental variation and accounting for potential covariates will be crucial in order

606

to gain a more in-depth understanding of microbial variation. Overall, our results provide a baseline assessment

607

of the early colonization and development of elephant seal gut microbes, and contribute towards an improved

608

understanding of host-microbe interactions in the wild, particularly in the light of sexual dimorphism.
