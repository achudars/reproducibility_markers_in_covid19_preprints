Abstract
Rooting cells and pollen tubes – key adaptative innovations that evolved during the
colonization and subsequent radiation of plants on land – expand by tip-growth. Tip-growth
relies on a tight coordination between the protoplast growth and the synthesis/remodeling of
the external cell wall. In root hairs and pollen tubes of the seed plant Arabidopsis thaliana, cell
wall integrity (CWI) mechanisms monitor this coordination through the Malectin-like receptor
kinases (MLRs) such as AtANXUR1 and AtFERONIA that act upstream of the AtMARIS PTI1like kinase. Here, we show that rhizoid growth in the early diverging plant, Marchantia
polymorpha, is also controlled by an MLR and PTI1-like signaling module. Rhizoids, root hairs
and pollen tubes respond similarly to disruption of MLR and PTI1-like encoding genes. Thus,
the MLR/PTI1-like signaling module that controls CWI during tip-growth is conserved between
M. polymorpha and A. thaliana suggesting it was active in the common ancestor of land plants.

Introduction
When plants first colonized terrestrial habitats more than 470 million years ago, they had to
cope with a relatively different, water-deprived environment, that represented a major driving
force for a series of key adaptations1–3. Among these, the emergence of rooting cells, such as
rhizoids and root hairs4, that facilitate substrate anchorage and water/nutrient uptake, and the
subsequent evolution of pollen tubes allowing for an efficient water-independent sperm
transport for fertilization in seed plants5 use tip-growth for rapid expansion. Tip-growth is an
extreme form of polar growth and as such, it relies on a tight coordination in both, time and
space, between the turgor pressure-driven deformation/loosening of the preexisting cell wall
and the secretion of new plasma membrane and cell wall material to allow for expansion6. It
has become apparent that plant cells have developed cell wall integrity (CWI) maintenance
mechanisms to control this coordination and avoid growth cessation or rupture. Research on
tip-growing cells of the seed plant model Arabidopsis thaliana has revealed CWI signaling
pathways that control pollen tube and root hair growth (reviewed in

7–11

). CWI maintenance

during pollen tube growth is controlled by two pairs of functionally redundant Malectin-like
receptor kinases (MLRs) named AtANXUR1/2 (AtANX1/2)12,13 and AtBUDDHA’S PAPER
SEAL1/2 (AtBUPS1/2)14. These pollen-expressed MLRs can interact with each other and are
thought to form a receptor complex for the peptide ligands AtRAPID ALKALINIZATION
FACTOR 4 (AtRALF4) and AtRALF19 14,15. Downstream of these MLRs, CWI is regulated by
reactive oxygen species (ROS)-producing NADPH-oxidases AtREACTIVE-BURST OXIDASE
HOMOLOG H/J (AtRBOHH/J)16, the type-one protein phosphatases AtATUNIS1/2
(AtAUN1/2)17, as well as the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK) AtMARIS (AtMRI)18.
Apart from the negative regulators AtAUN1/2, all the above-mentioned proteins positively
regulate CWI maintenance. Consistently, their corresponding loss-of-function and knockdown
mutants display precocious pollen tube bursting leading to low or no transmission of the

mutant alleles by the haploid pollen to the next generation and thus to male sterility. CWI
signaling also occurs in Arabidopsis root hairs, where it is governed by the closest homolog of
AtANX1/2, the MLR AtFERONIA (AtFER); Atfer mutants develop root hairs that spontaneously
burst during growth19. Intriguingly, AtMRI has been shown to also function during root hair CWI
maintenance downstream of AtFER18. Concordantly, AtMRI is strongly expressed in both
pollen and root tissues and AtMRI protein is located though the plasma membrane of both
pollen tubes and root hairs where it is required to maintain CWI18,20. AtMRI belongs to the
Arabidopsis RLCK-VIII subfamily that shares homology with the tomato Pto-interacting protein
1 (PTI1) involved in the Pto-mediated hypersensitive response21. Apart from the bursting root
hair and pollen tube phenotypes of Atmri, and abscisic acid (ABA)-insensitivity of Atcark1
mutants22, no phenotype and therefore no function have been reported for any of the other 9
Arabidopsis PTI1-like RLCK proteins.
Recently, a T-DNA insertional mutant screen for defective rhizoid growth phenotypes in the
early-diverging land plant Marchantia polymorpha identified mutant alleles of the two unique
Marchantia MLR and PTI1-like kinases, MpFERONIA (MpFER) and MpMARIS (MpMRI),
respectively23,24. Here, by focusing on AtMRI and MpMRI and using trans-species
complementation assays, we demonstrate that the rhizoid-derived MpMRI and the root hairand pollen tube-derived AtMRI can function in the CWI pathways of all three tip-growing cell
types. Despite their different function, origin and growth environment, we show that all three
cell types respond similarly to disruption and overexpression of the PTI1-like encoding genes.
Finally, we show that MpMRI functions downstream of MpFER in the rhizoid CWI pathway,
revealing that the CWI control of tip-growth in bryophytes and seed plants relies on a common
MLR/PTI1-like receptor-like kinases module that has been conserved during land plant
evolution.

Results
MpMRI is required for CWI during rhizoid growth.
We previously showed that the Arabidopsis PTI1-like AtMRI controls CWI during tip-growth of
root hairs and pollen tubes18. A large-scale mutant screen in Marchantia for defects in rhizoid
growth revealed that a T-DNA insertion in the genetic locus Mapoly0051s0094.1, renamed
MpMRI (see below), coding for a PTI1-like homolog, may cause a morphologically related loss
of CWI phenotype in tip-growing rhizoids23. We first reanalyzed the Mpmri-1 (formerly named
Mppti-1 or ST13.323) mutant phenotype in young gemmalings and confirmed that the mutant
develops significantly shorter rhizoids than the wild-type accessions (Fig. 1a,b). Mpmri-1 also
developed fewer intact rhizoids per thallus than Tak-2 (Fig. 2c), because rhizoids frequently
burst at their tip, as revealed by brownish spots on the ventral side of thalli grown on solid
medium (Fig. 1a, 2d) or cytoplasmic content released by collapsed rhizoids grown in liquid
condition (Fig. 1c). To test whether the T-DNA insertion in the MpMRI locus (Supplementary
Fig. 1) causes the rhizoid bursting phenotype, we transformed the Mpmri-1 mutant with the
native MpMRI coding sequence fused to the red fluorescent protein (RFP) under control of the
ubiquitously active promoter of Elongation Factor 1 α (proMpEF1α). Rhizoids were longer in
transformed lines than in mutants (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2). Bursting of rhizoids and
the resulting brown staining observed in Mpmri-1 rhizoids was not observed in any of the
transformed lines (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 2). Thus, disruption of the MpMRI locus
indeed causes defective rhizoid growth in Mpmri-1 mutants. The functional MpMRI-RFP
protein fusion mainly localizes to the plasma membrane of Mpmri-1 rescued rhizoids, with a
weaker fluorescence signal detected in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Video 1).
This localization pattern resembles the localization of AtMRI in Arabidopsis tip-growing
cells18,20. Therefore, a plasma membrane-localized MpMRI protein is required for CWI in M.
polymorpha rhizoids.

AtMRI can maintain CWI during rhizoid growth in Marchantia.
Since both AtMRI and the Marchantia PTI1-like homolog MpMRI control CWI in different tipgrowing cells, we tested if their function in CWI was conserved. The sequences of the AtMRI
and MpMRI proteins are 64 % identical (Supplementary Table 1). We first introduced AtMRIRFP into the Mpmri-1 mutant. Expression of AtMRI-RFP led to a partial, but significant
increase in rhizoid length (Fig. 2b) and apparent cell wall integrity (Fig. 2d). The number of
intact rhizoids per thallus was significantly higher in all rescue lines as compared to Mpmri-1
(Fig. 2c). Furthermore, AtMRI-RFP localized to the plasma membrane of rhizoids just like
MpMRI-RFP (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Video 2). Taken together, these results demonstrate
that AtMRI can partially substitute for MpMRI to maintain CWI in M. polymorpha rhizoids,
despite the independent evolution of both genes for approximately 450-470 million years.

MpMRI can maintain CWI during pollen tube and root hair growth in Arabidopsis.
Next, we tested the hypothesis that the function of PTI1-like proteins has been universally
conserved throughout evolution of rooting cells and/or upon acquisition of new functions (i.e.
between rooting cells and pollen tubes). We first introduced MpMRI fused to the yellow
fluorescent protein (YFP) into the heterozygous Atmri-1/AtMRI (herein after referred to as mri1/MRI) background under control of the native AtMRI promoter (proAtMRI), which drives
expression in both, root hairs and pollen tubes17,18. Normally, mri-1 homozygous individuals
are never isolated in the self-progeny of heterozygous mri-1/MRI plants because mri-1dependent pollen tube bursting prevents transmission of the male mri-1 allele and thus,
production of homozygous mri-1/mri-1 individuals (Supplementary Table 2)18. By contrast, 7
homozygous mri-1/mri-1 T2 individuals were isolated out of 200 progenies originating from
three independent mri-1/MRI T1 lines hemizygous for MpMRI-YFP suggesting that MpMRI
expression partially rescues the mri-1 male gametophytic defect.

To confirm that the partial rescue of mri-1 male transmission efficiency resulted from the
rescue of CWI during pollen tube growth by MpMRI-YFP expression, we performed in vitro
pollen germination assays on homozygous T3 plants (mri-1/mri-1; MpMRI-YFP) originating
from three independent T1 lines. Pollen bursting rate was lower in all lines expressing MpMRIYFP and not significantly different from the bursting rates of either wild type, or mri-1/mri-1
complemented with an AtMRI-YFP construct (Fig. 3a)18. However, the expression of MpMRIYFP frequently led to abnormal pollen tube morphology in vitro, as indicated by swollen apices
and branching (n=56 out of 60; Fig. 3b). These abnormalities were not observed in mri-1 pollen
tubes expressing AtMRI-YFP (Fig. 3b) and may explain the incomplete rescue of male mri-1transmission efficiency by MpMRI-YFP expression. MpMRI-YFP normally localized to the
plasma membrane of the pollen tube (Fig. 3b). To exclude that the observed rescue of CWI is
not an effect of the artificial in vitro conditions, we also determined the seed set of T3 lines.
For all T3 lines, there was a significant increase of seed set (Fig. 3c,d). Taken together, these
results demonstrate that MpMRI can partially substitute for AtMRI in mri-1 pollen tubes despite
the different functions and growth environment of rhizoids and pollen tubes.
To test if expression of MpMRI-YFP can rescue the loss of CWI in mri-1 mutant root hairs, we
analyzed root hair growth in two of the A. thaliana mri-1 T3 lines homozygous for MpMRI-YFP.
Not only was root hair length partially restored to wild-type length in all individuals (n > 10; Fig.
4a,c), but the rate of root hair bursting was much lower than in mri-1 mutants (Fig. 4b,c). mri1 root hairs expressing MpMRI-YFP (Fig. 3b) developed cylindrical root hairs indistinguishable
from wild type (Fig. 4c). MpMRI-YFP localized to the plasma membrane of root hairs similarly
as it and AtMRI did in other tip-growing cells (Fig. 4c). These results demonstrate that MpMRI
can fully replace AtMRI in the CWI maintenance pathway during root hair growth.

Overexpression of PTI1-like proteins inhibits rhizoid, root hair and pollen tube growth.
Overexpression of positive or knockdown of negative CWI regulators can lead to growth
cessation in Arabidopsis pollen tubes and root hairs16–18. To further confirm that MpMRI

function is conserved between A. thaliana and M. polymorpha we tested whether rhizoid
growth would be inhibited by overexpression of PTI1-like genes. Constitutively overexpressing
MpMRI and AtMRI fused to a ternary Citrine tag (3xCitrine) in wild-type sporelings led to
significant rhizoid growth inhibition (Fig. 5a,b and Supplementary Fig. 5a). The shorter rhizoids
on lines overexpressing MpMRI- or AtMRI-3xCitrine displayed the expected plasma
membrane localization for both MpMRI and AtMRI (Supplementary Fig. 3). Taken together,
these results indicate that the repression of growth by PTI1-like kinases has been conserved
since A. thaliana and M. polymorpha last shared a common ancestor.

The conserved R240 of PTI1-like proteins exerts an auto-inhibitory effect.
A suppressor screen for rescue of male fertility in the double-knockout mutant Atanx1 anx2
helped identify a hyperactive variant of AtMRI, with a R240C substitution in the activation loop
of the kinase domain18. Structural similarity analyses of land plant PTI1-like revealed that
MpMRI is part of a monophyletic group that includes AtMRI (termed the ‘MRI-like group’ from
here on; Supplementary Fig. 4a). Both the invariant lysine residue of the ATP-binding pocket
required for kinase activity (K100 in AtMRI) and the STR-motif, which includes arginine R240,
are conserved among members of the MRI-like group (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Furthermore,
the conserved threonine (T239 in AtMRI) of the conserved STR motif of some PTI1-like
kinases can be phosphorylated by other kinases such as the Arabidopsis OXIDATIVE
SIGNAL-INDUCIBLE1 (OXI1) and tomato Pto kinases25,26.
To better understand the mechanistic role of conserved K100, T239 and R240 residues, we
designed several structural variants of AtMRI (Supplementary Table 3). First, we designed two
kinase-dead variants with a K100N and K100E amino acid substitution, respectively 21,27,28 and
introduced them in mri-1/MRI under the pollen-specific promoter Lat5229. Expression of both
structural AtMRIK100E and AtMRIK100N variants led to the emergence of homozygous mri-1/mri1 lines in the self-progeny of transformed mri-1/MRI (Supplementary Table 3, orange rows)
similarly as for expression of wild-type AtMRI (Supplementary Table 3, green row) or

AtMRIR240C (Supplementary Table 3, blue row). Hence, kinase activity does not appear to be
required for AtMRI function during pollen tube growth. Second, we tested for the necessity of
phosphorylation at residue T239 by engineering a non-phosphorylatable T239A and a
phosphomimetic T239E variant, respectively, and introducing them in mri-1/MRI. Again,
expression of both AtMRIT239A and AtMRIT239E variants led to the emergence of homozygous
mri-1/mri-1 individuals (Supplementary Table 3, yellow rows) indicating that phosphorylation
at T239 is not required for AtMRI function during pollen tube growth. These results are in good
agreement with a previous study on rice OsPTI1a, where equivalent mutant variants
OsPTI1aK96N and OsPTI1aT233A were able to rescue Ospti1a spontaneous lesions and rice
blast-enhanced resistance phenotypes30. Moreover, they also suggest that overactivity of
AtMRIR240C arises from a substitution of R240 itself rather than from mimicking phosphorylation
at T23931. We then produced some variants for R240 itself, namely R240M, R240A and
R240S. To assess a potential protein overactivity that may arise from the substitutions, we
expressed all our variants in the pollen tube bursting male-sterile AtrbohH rbohJ mutant,
whose sterility is rescued by expression of the overactive AtMRIR240C variant, but not the native
AtMRI protein18. Similarly, as for wild-type AtMRI, expression of the phosphomimetic
AtMRIT239E variant did not restore AtrbohH rbohJ sterility, with all independent T1 lines
producing only a few seeds (Supplementary Fig. 4b). However, expression of any R240
variant led to a clear rescue of AtrbohH rbohJ fertility with seed set increase (Supplementary
Fig. 4b). These results confirm that R240C overactivity is not due to phospho-mimicking at
residue T239 and indicate that any substitution of residue R240 leads to an overactive version
of AtMRI. Thus, residue R240 of AtMRI appear to exert an enigmatic auto-inhibitory effect.

MpMRIR240C inhibits growth in Marchantia and Arabidopsis tip-growing cells
If MpMRI and AtMRI are functionally conserved, we would expect that the hyperactive R240C
mutation in each would have similar phenotypic consequences. To test this, we constitutively
expressed variant MpMRIR240C-RFP in Marchantia. Rhizoid length was significantly reduced in

all independent transformed lines compared to controls (Fig. 5a, b). Also, the growth inhibitory
effect derived from MpMRIR240C expression was stronger than for MpMRI expression as
observed when AtMRIR240C and AtMRI are overexpressed in A. thaliana18, suggesting that the
R240C substitution in MpMRIR240C induces a similar effect as for AtMRIR240C.
Next, to test whether MpMRIR240C growth inhibition effect is restricted to rhizoid, we introduced
MpMRIR240C-YFP in Arabidopsis wild-type pollen tubes and root hairs under the control of
proAtMRI. To directly assess the effect of MpMRIR240C on pollen tube germination and growth,
we used several independent lines hemizygously expressing the transgene, i.e. in plants from
which half of the pollen is wild type and the other half expresses MpMRIR240C-YFP
(Supplementary Table 4), thus allowing direct comparison of transgenic and wild-type pollen
tubes within the same line and assays. Pollen tubes were shorter for pollen expressing
MpMRIR240C than for wild-type pollen (Fig. 5c and d; Supplementary Fig. 5). We then asked
whether these growth inhibitory effects were strong enough to affect pollen germination itself.
While MpMRI-YFP did not significantly affect the percentage of transgenic to non-transgenic
pollen tubes (expected to be 50% if the transgene does not influence germination), expression
of MpMRIR240C-YFP decreased the ratio of pollen tubes carrying the transgene to 37 - 43 %
(Supplementary Table 4). Interestingly, plasma membrane invaginations in fluorescent nongerminating pollen grains were observed, a phenotype described upon AtMRIR240C expression,
as well (Fig. 5d)18. A more severe effect was observed upon expression of AtMRI-CFP (16 %),
while AtMRIR240C-CFP induced a complete inhibition of pollen germination (complete absence
of fluorescent pollen tubes), just as reported before (Supplementary Table 4)18. These findings
suggest that expression of MpMRIR240C disrupts pollen tube growth more than MpMRI as
observed upon expression of AtMRIR240C and AtMRI.
We assessed whether expression of MpMRIR240C has a similar growth inhibitory effect on root
hairs. Root hairs were shorter on all lines homozygous for proAtMRI:MpMRIR240C-YFP
(originating from the same three independent T1 lines tested for pollen tube growth) than on
wild type (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Fig. 6). Again, the growth inhibitory effect observed in
root hairs was less pronounced than upon expression of Arabidopsis AtMRIR240C-YFP (two

independent lines, Fig. 5e and Supplementary Fig. 6). Altogether, the similar growth inhibitory
effects observed on tip-growing Marchantia and Arabidopsis cells upon expression of either
MpMRIR240C or AtMRIR240C suggest functional conservation of the auto-inhibitory residue R240
and overactivation of the CWI pathways upon expression of the R240C variants.

MpMRI and MpFER act in a common, evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway.
We previously reported that expression of AtMRIR240C was sufficient to partially rescue loss of
CWI of Atanx1 anx2 pollen tubes as well as Atfer root hairs, thereby positioning MRI
downstream of the MLRs AtANX1 and AtFER18. Interestingly, disruption of the unique
Marchantia MLR homologue MpFER24 was also reported to trigger loss of CWI in rhizoids23
suggesting that the MLR/PTI1-like signaling module is conserved during rhizoid growth. To
further demonstrate the conservation, we expressed a MpMRIR240C-RFP protein fusion in the
Mpfer-1 mutant23 (Supplementary Fig. 1). In contrast to Mpfer-1 in which almost every rhizoid
bursts at an early stage of growth, rhizoids on 4 independent Mpfer-1 lines transformed with
MpMRIR240C-RFP were longer and more frequently intact (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 7).
These data indicate that MpMRI functions downstream of MpFER in the CWI pathway that
controls rhizoid growth. They also confirm that the MLR/PTI1-like signaling module controlling
CWI in tip-growing cells has been conserved during land plant evolution from the rhizoids of
liverworts to the root hairs and pollen tubes of seed plants.

Discussion
During land plant evolution, tip-growth was recruited to participate in several key adaptations
to terrestrial habitats that facilitated colonization and radiation of land plants. Among these
adaptations are substrate anchorage, water/nutrient uptake and microorganism interactions
via rooting cells (rhizoids and root hairs), and water-independent sperm delivery to the egg
cell via pollen tubes. While tip-growth in plants performs extremely well for increasing surfaces,
exploring environment and transport, it relies on a delicate balance of turgor-driven,
anisotropic cell expansion and appropriate secretion of surface membrane and cell wall
material that defines cell shape and function. We show that this balance is mediated, at least
in part, by the FER/MRI signaling module in tip-growing cells. Failure of this mechanism in
plants with defective FERONIA or MARIS function results in loss of cellular integrity because
of mechanical failure in the cell wall.
While rhizoids and root hairs represent morphologically similar cell types serving similar
biological functions, they develop during different life-phases. Rhizoids are found on the
gametophyte of early diverging land plant taxa, while root hairs develop on the roots of
vascular plants4,32. The development of rhizoids or root hairs in all major lineages of land plants
suggests that tip-growing cells formed the rooting structures of the first land plants4. Unlike
pollen tubes that emerge from pollen grains, rhizoids and root hairs originate from the swelling
of some epidermal cells. The development of such is controlled by an ancient conserved
genetic mechanism composed of the class I ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE SIX-LIKE (RSL) basic
helix-loop-helix transcription factors33,34. The control of root hair and rhizoid development by
the same transcription factors has been interpreted as an example of deep homology35 since,
at the level of land plants, rhizoids and root hairs are analogous structures with similar
functions whose development is controlled by a homologous genetic mechanism.
Later during evolution, some vascular plants developed an elaborate system to guarantee an
efficient water-independent sperm cell delivery to the female egg cell via pollen tubes, a

complex process referred to as siphonogamy5,36. Siphonogamy may have evolved twice
independently within the gymnosperm and angiosperm lineages5,37. Pollen tubes of seed
plants are thought to have evolved from a slow and long-lived haustorial pollen tube involved
in nutritional uptake to a fast-growing, short-lived pollen tube whose unique function is the
delivery of non-motile sperm in angiosperms5,38. It is currently unknown whether CWI
maintenance mechanisms were already active in the slow haustorial pollen tubes or if they
were recruited along the transition to fast growth to avoid growth accidents and infertility. So
far, however, there have been no reports of homologous mechanisms conserved between
pollen tubes and rhizoids.
In this study, we demonstrate the evolutionarily conservation of the genetic pathway
comprised of MLRs and PTI1-like receptor-like kinases that regulates CWI maintenance
during tip-growth. We showed that not only disruption but also overexpression of the PTI1-like
encoding genes MpMRI and AtMRI led to similar CWI maintenance defects in rhizoids of the
early diverging land plant Marchantia as in the root hairs and pollen tubes of the seed plant
Arabidopsis. Moreover, trans-species complementation assays showed that AtMRI
expression partially rescues the bursting rhizoid phenotype of Mpmri-1 while MpMRI
expression rescues partially pollen tube bursting of Atmri-1 and fully its bursting root hair
phenotype. These results demonstrate that MpMRI and AtMRI can largely functionally replace
each other regardless of the tip-growing cell type or the phylogenetic position of the plant on
which they develop. This indicates that the fundamental function of PTI1-like proteins has been
conserved since liverworts and seed plants diverged from a common ancestor. Nonetheless,
in the Arabidopsis mri-1 mutant, MpMRI-expressing root hairs grew better than MpMRIexpressing pollen tubes. Consequently, the CWI control in sporophytic root hairs is likely to be
more similar to that in gametophytic rhizoids than in pollen tubes, the male gametophytes of
flowering plants. Thus, our study suggests that a genetic program maintaining CWI in rhizoids
was established early during land plant evolution and then adopted by the sporophyte for root
hair growth control and much later by the male gametophyte of flowering plants.

One can also wonder whether CWI maintenance during tip-growth represents the original
ancestral function of PTI1-like proteins. The fact that several Arabidopsis PTI1-like proteins,
close homologues of AtMRI, cannot even partially substitute for AtMRI in pollen tube CWI
maintenance39 but MpMRI can, suggests subfunctionalisation of the PTI1-like gene family in
the lineage that led to Arabidopsis. Studies in tomato, cucumber, and rice all demonstrate a
role for PTI1-like in plant responses to pathogens as either positive (in dicots such as
Tomato21,40 and Cucumber41) or negative (in monocot, Rice28,42) regulators. Moreover, the
Arabidopsis PTI1-like AtCARK1 positively regulates abscisic acid (ABA) signaling by
phosphorylating ABA receptors22. Since some ABA responses and signaling components are
conserved in Marchantia24,43–45, and pathosystems are being established in Marchantia46 it
would be informative to test if MpMRI regulates ABA signaling and/or immunity in this species.
Our previous study showed that the AtMRIR240C structural variant functions as an overactive
protein version, whose expression is not only sufficient for tip-growth inhibition in the wild-type
background but also rescues loss of CWI in mutants of its upstream MLR regulators AtANX1/2
for pollen tubes and AtFER for root hairs18. Here, we showed that expression of the Marchantia
variant MpMRIR240C triggered similar growth inhibitory effects in both, Marchantia and
Arabidopsis tip-growing cells suggesting a conserved structural mechanism. Furthermore,
expressing the MpMRIR240C variant in the Mpfer mutant partially rescued Mpfer bursting
rhizoids, similarly as did AtMRIR240C expression for Atfer bursting root hairs and Atanx1 anx2
bursting pollen tubes. Therefore, the distantly related land plant taxa Arabidopsis and
Marchantia share a common MLR/PTI1-like receptor-like kinase signaling module to control
CWI in tip-growing cells. Since these two species last shared a common ancestor
approximately 450-470 million years ago and given the most likely topologies of land plant
phylogeny, we conclude that such a signaling module is an ancient common feature shared
by most lineages of extant land plants. Whether such signaling module includes further
common regulatory features known from the Arabidopsis CWI maintenance pathways (Fig.
6d), such as extracellular receptor binding of RALF peptides, regulation of ROS-producing
NADPH oxidase etc. remains to be investigated.

Materials and Methods
Plant materials and growth conditions
All mutant lines, transgenic lines, oligonucleotide sequences and plasmids used in this study
are listed in Supplementary Tables 5-8, respectively. The presence and position of the T-DNA
in the respective genetic locus of the insertional mutants Mpmri-1 (ST13.3) and Mpfer-1
(ST14.3)23 was verified via PCR-genotyping and sequencing (Supplementary Fig. 1). Binary
vectors were first transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 via
electroporation. A pure culture was then used to transform Arabidopsis47 or Marchantia
sporelings48 and thalli49.
Arabidopsis seeds (Col-0) were sown on solid half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal
medium (Duchefa Biochemie), stratified (2 d, 4 °C, darkness) and allowed to germinate in a
growth chamber set to long day conditions (7-10 d, 21 °C, 60 % humidity, 16 h white light at
80 µmol m-1 s-1/8 h darkness cycle). Seedlings were then transferred and grown on soil in a
greenhouse under long day conditions. Vegetative Marchantia stages were grown on solid
Johnson’s growth medium50 (0.8 % agar to facilitate growth of rhizoid defective mutants) under
long day conditions. To cross male and female Marchantia lineages, 4 weeks old thalli were
transferred onto soil and grown for 3 weeks under long day conditions (white light: 40 µmol m1

s-1; far-red light between 700-880 nm: 15 µmol m-1 s-1) to trigger gametangia formation.

Crossings were then carried out manually via spermatozoid transfer from mature male to
female gametangia. Emerging sporangia were harvested after 2-3 weeks and sterilized with 1
% sodium dichlorisocyanurate to allow for axenic, vegetative cultivation.

Molecular cloning
To amplify the MpMRI and MpFER coding sequences (CDS), RNA was isolated from Tak-1
and Tak-2 whole-plant material using the Direct-Zol RNA Mini-Preparation Kit (Zymo

Research). cDNA synthesis was carried out using the RevertAid H Minus First Strand cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and used as template for the amplification of the
respective CDS without stop codon using gateway-compatible primers. The different CDS
were then cloned into pDONR207 and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α cells to
generate Gateway-entry clones. The CDS were then remobilized in the respective Gateway
destination vectors of choice to generate fluorescent protein fusions (Supplementary Table 7).
Amplified sequences and preservation of the reading frames were verified via sequencing of
the full-length CDS (entry clones) and the promoter-CDS / CDS-fluorescent protein junctions
(final binary constructs).
The new variants MpMRIR240C and AtMRIK100N, AtMRIT239A, AtMRIT239E, AtMRIR240M, AtMRIR240A
and AtMRIR240S, were generated via site-directed mutagenesis (SDM). SDM primers were
designed using Primer X (http://www.bioinformatics.org/primerx/) to introduce via PCR the
different adequate nucleotide substitutions with MpMRI and AtMRI in pDONR207 as template.
The PCR-mix were digested with the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme DpnI to degrade
non-mutagenized vector copies. The mutagenized vectors were transformed into E. coli DH5α
cells and the respective nucleotide substitution were verified via sequencing before
remobilization of the Gateway cassette in the final binary plasmids.

Selection of transformant lines
Putatively transformed Arabidopsis T1 seeds were preselected on solid half-strength MS with
Basta (glufosinate ammonium, 10 µg/ mL). Resistant T1 seedlings were transferred and grown
on soil. Upon flower emergence, pollen was checked for expression of the respective
fluorescent fusion protein. Transgenic T1 lines with clear, homogenous fluorescence in about
50 % of the pollen were propagated. Their seeds were harvested and selected again in the T2
generation. Upon flower emergence, plants were screened for 100 % fluorescent pollen
grains, indicating homozygous lines. Plants expressing fluorescent protein fusions under
control of proAtMRI were additionally screened for root hair-specific fluorescence at the
seedling stage.

Putatively transformed Marchantia sporelings/thalli were preselected on solid Johnson’s
growth medium with Chlorsulfuron (100 µg/ mL) or Gentamicin (0.5 µM) and supplemented
with Cefotaxime (100 µg/ mL) to avoid contamination with residual Agrobacteria. Resistant
plants were then genotyped for presence of the fluorescent protein fusion and additionally
checked for Citrine/RFP fluorescence in thalli, gemmae and/or rhizoids. Propagation of the
different transgenic lines was done by transplantation and cultivation of gemmae.

Rhizoid growth assays
Gemmae were grown vertically for 7 d under axenic standard conditions (as described above).
To determine the mean rhizoid length, the 10 longest rhizoids per gemmaling were measured
for n ≥ 10 individuals. To approximately estimate the percentage of bursting rhizoids, the mean
number of visibly intact rhizoids per thallus was determined per individual. For time course
experiments, data was collected after 7, 14, 21 and 28 d. Images were taken with a Leica MZ
16 F fluorescence binocular (whole-plant), a Leica DM5000 fluorescence microscope (closeup images). Alternatively, fresh gemmaes were grown for 24hr in liquid Johnson’s growth
medium sandwiched between a slide and a cover slip separated with a thin layer of parafilm.
Young growing rhizoids were then imaged with either a Leica DM5000 fluorescence
microscope or a Leica SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope.

In vitro Pollen germination assays and length measurements
Young, freshly opened Arabidopsis flowers were harvested in the morning and pollen grains
were allowed to hydrate for 30 min under long day conditions in a humid environment. Stamina
were then brushed on a microscopic slide coated with 500 µL of solid pollen germination
medium 51. Pollen germination assays and imaging were conducted as described previously17.
Bright field microscopy was carried out with a Leica DM5000 microscope and n = 150 – 300
pollen grains per genotype and experiment were imaged and later classified as nongerminated, germinated and intact or germinated and burst.

In order to determine the mean pollen tube length, pollen germination was induced as
described above. The length of n = 200 pollen tubes was measured following the grown pollen
tube from the origin of germination to the pollen tube tip in three independent experiments.

Seed set assays
Plants were allowed to self-fertilize and n > 10 mature siliques were harvested per individual
plant. Siliques were fixed and bleached in 1.5 mL of an acetic acid / ethanol solution (v/v 1:3)
for 1 d. Siliques were then opened and their seeds were quantified to determine the mean
number of seeds per silique. Images were obtained with a Leica MZ 16 F fluorescence
binocular.

Root hair assays
Seeds were allowed to germinate vertically on solid half-strength MS medium supplemented
with 2 % sucrose. 4 – 5 d old seedlings were embedded in a microscope slide with liquid 1/10
MS medium. The borders of the glass slide were wrapped with a thin parafilm layer to act as
spacer to prevent squashing the young fragile Arabidopsis roots with the coverslip. The most
distal part of the root was imaged (Leica DM5000 fluorescence microscope) and digitally
divided into sections of 150 µm length starting from the first root hair from the tip. The length
of 5 – 10 root hairs per section was determined. The mean of each section was then compared
amongst specimens of each genotype. The root hair bursting rate was determined as the
percentage of bursting root hairs out of the total root hair number.

Phylogenetic analyses
The AtMRI (AT2G41970) amino acid sequence was used as query to perform a pBLAST
homology search (BLOSUM62 matrix) against the protein database on representative species
of major land plant taxa. pBLAST was performed on https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/ using
standard settings for all species. The following species and genome versions were used: AmTr
- Amborella trichopoda (v1.0), AT - Arabidopsis thaliana (TAIR10), Mapoly - Marchantia

polymorpha (v3.1), Pp - Physcomitrella patens (v3.3), SeMo - Selaginella moellendorffii (v1.2).
Only sequences either showing a percent identity >60% and/or annotation as PTO-interacting
protein 1-like proteins (KEGG ORTHOLOGY code K13436) were considered. Multiple
sequence alignments of all PTI1-like amino acid sequences were built using ClustalX2 52 and
illustrated using GeneDoc 2.7.0 and phylogenetic trees were calculated with MEGA753 using
the Maximum Likelihood method based on the JTT matrix-based model54 and 1000 repetitions.
The tree with the highest log likelihood (-4460.1659) is shown in Supplementary Fig. 4. The
percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the
branches. The frequency of amino acid usage per residue was illustrated using WebLogo 3
(http://weblogo.threeplusone.com/create.cgi).

Data processing
Image analysis was performed using FIJI/ImageJ 1.50e55. Bar graphs were designed using
Excel/Microsoft Office 365. Boxplots were designed using R studio 0.99.892 (RStudio Team,
2015).
