ABSTRACT
Quorum sensing is a bacterial
communication process whereby bacteria
produce, release and detect the accumulation of
extracellular
signaling molecules
called
autoinducers to coordinate collective behaviors.
In Vibrio cholerae, the quorum-sensing
autoinducer, DPO (3,5-dimethyl-pyrazin-2-ol),
binds the receptor-transcription factor, VqmA. In
response, the DPO-VqmA complex activates
transcription of the vqmR gene encoding the
VqmR small RNA. VqmR represses genes
required for biofilm formation and virulence
factor production. Here, we show that VqmA has
DPO-dependent
and
DPO-independent
activity. We solved the DPO-VqmA crystal
structure and compared it to existing structures to
understand the conformational changes the
protein undergoes upon DNA binding. Analysis
of DPO analogs reveals that a hydroxyl or
carbonyl group at the 2’ position is critical for
binding. The proposed DPO precursor, a linear
molecule, Ala-AA (N-alanyl-aminoacetone), also
binds and activates VqmA. DPO and Ala-AA
occupy the same binding site as judged by sitedirected mutagenesis and competitive ligand
binding analyses.
_______________________________________
Bacteria communicate and orchestrate

collective behaviors using a process called
quorum sensing (QS). QS relies on the production,
release, detection, and group-wide response to
extracellular
signaling molecules
called
autoinducers (AIs) that accumulate with
increasing cell density (reviewed in 1). In the
global pathogen Vibrio cholerae, multiple QS
pathways converge to repress biofilm formation
and virulence factor production at high cell
density (HCD) (1-6). One of the V. cholerae QS
pathways is composed of an AI, 3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2-ol (DPO), and its partner cytoplasmic
receptor, VqmA. VqmA is a transcription factor
that, upon binding DPO, activates expression of a
gene encoding a small RNA called VqmR (7,8).
VqmR post-transcriptionally controls many
target genes (7,9). Of note, VqmR represses
translation of ctx and rtxA, two toxin-encoding
genes, vpsT, encoding a component required for
biofilm formation, and aphA, encoding the low
cell density (LCD) QS master regulator AphA
(7,9). Thus, analogous to the previously
discovered V. cholerae QS systems, the
consequence of DPO binding to VqmA at HCD is
repression of virulence and biofilm formation.
Homologs of the VqmA receptor are
restricted to the Vibrio genus, and the vibriophage
VP882
(10).
By
contrast,
threonine
dehydrogenase (Tdh), an enzyme required for
DPO biosynthesis, is highly conserved among

Autoinducer recognition by the VqmA quorum-sensing receptor
bacteria, archaea, and eukarya (11). Consistent
with this distribution, with respect to bacteria,
DPO is produced by multiple species in different
orders (8). Tdh oxidizes L-threonine to 2-amino3-ketobutyric acid (AKB), which spontaneously
decarboxylates to aminoacetone (12). In the
proposed mechanism for DPO biosynthesis,
aminoacetone is predicted to undergo a
condensation reaction with L-alanine to yield Nalanyl-aminoacetone (Ala-AA) (8). This putative
linear precursor is subsequently converted to
DPO by an unknown mechanism.
In this report, we characterize ligandcontrolled activation of VqmA in V. cholerae. In
contrast to canonical LuxR-type QS receptortranscription factors, which typically require
binding to their cognate ligands to fold and
activate transcription (13-16), here, we find that
VqmA does not require DPO for folding or basal
transcriptional activity, but does require binding
DPO to drive maximal activity. These same
properties are relevant for the phage VP882encoded
VqmA
homolog
(VqmAPhage),
suggesting that ligand-independent activity is a
conserved feature among VqmA proteins. We
show that VqmA binds to and is activated by both
DPO and the putative DPO intermediate, Ala-AA.
We solved the crystal structure of VqmA bound
to DPO. Comparison to existing structures (17,18)
allowed us to provide insight into the
conformational changes VqmA undergoes upon
DNA binding. We were unable to obtain the
crystal structure of VqmA bound to Ala-AA
because Ala-AA spontaneously cyclizes into
DPO under our crystallization conditions.
Mutagenesis of the VqmA ligand-binding pocket
shows that DPO and Ala-AA likely occupy the
same site in VqmA, as substitutions in residues
that alter DPO binding and activity have similar
effects on Ala-AA binding and activity.
Characterization of binding by isothermal
titration calorimetry (ITC)-based competition
experiments and kinetic studies reveals that
VqmA prefers DPO over Ala-AA. Assessment of
the activities of a panel of DPO analogs revealed
that a 2’ hydroxyl or carbonyl group is required
for binding to VqmA. Taken together, our results
show that VqmA is promiscuous with respect to
DPO and Ala-AA. Nonetheless, maximal VqmA
activity depends on ligand binding. The ability of
VqmA to activate gene expression to different

levels in the unbound state and when bound to
two different ligands could enable greater
flexibility in regulating gene expression than
exists in canonical LuxR-type QS receptors,
which typically have no activity in the Apo-state
and show strict specificity for a single partner
ligand.
RESULTS
VqmA possesses both ligand-independent and
ligand-dependent activity
VqmA is a cytoplasmic transcription
factor and QS receptor that binds the AI DPO, a
hydroxypyrazine that requires the Tdh enzyme
for its production (8). The VqmA receptor is
restricted to vibrios and one vibriophage. By
contrast, canonical LuxR-type cytoplasmic QS
receptor-transcription factors exist in thousands
of Gram-negative bacterial species and they bind
AIs that are acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs)
(reviewed in 1). AHL AIs are produced by LuxItype AI synthases. LuxR-type receptors typically
require binding to their cognate AIs to properly
fold, become soluble, and activate transcription
(13-16). Thus, LuxI-type AI synthases and LuxRtype receptors function as obligate pairs, and
mutation of the luxI gene confers the identical
defect as does mutation of the luxR gene (19). We
wondered whether the Tdh-VqmA pair functions
in an analogous manner. To probe this question,
we constructed a reporter system to monitor
activation of transcription by VqmA. We fused
the lux (luciferase) operon to the vqmR promoter
(PvqmR-lux) and integrated it onto the V. cholerae
chromosome at an ectopic locus (lacZ). We
measured transcriptional activity in different V.
cholerae strains and across different conditions.
WT V. cholerae harboring the PvqmR-lux reporter
exhibited maximal activity at HCD, which is
consistent with our previous report (Fig. 1A and
(8)). The ∆tdh mutant, which is defective for
DPO production, elicited ~10-fold lower activity
(Fig. 1A). Restoration of light production to
approximately the WT level occurred in the ∆tdh
mutant following exogenous addition of 1 µM
DPO (Fig. 1A). In the ∆vqmA strain, PvqmR-lux
levels were ~330-fold lower than in the WT and
~23-fold lower than in the ∆tdh strain to which no
DPO was added (Fig. 1A). Exogenous addition of
DPO did not induce light production in the
∆vqmA strain (Fig. 1A). Thus, unlike what is

Autoinducer recognition by the VqmA quorum-sensing receptor
observed for canonical LuxI-LuxR-type systems,
the ∆tdh synthase mutant and the ∆vqmA receptor
mutant have different phenotypes with respect to
QS output.
Two possibilities could underpin the
differences in the lux phenotypes of the ∆vqmA
and ∆tdh mutants: either DPO is produced via a
Tdh-independent mechanism, or VqmA displays
basal activity in the absence of its ligand. To
investigate the first possibility, we quantified
DPO production by WT, ∆tdh, and ∆vqmA V.
cholerae. Cell-free culture fluids prepared from
each strain were supplied to the V. cholerae tdh
PvqmR-lux reporter strain and light production
was measured (Fig. S1A). Activity present in the
preparations was compared to that following
addition of known amounts of synthetic DPO.
The EC50 for synthetic DPO is ~1 µM (8). Using
this value, we could estimate that the WT and
∆vqmA culture fluids contained ~1-2 µM DPO
while the amount of DPO in culture fluid from the
∆tdh strain was below the 60 nM detection limit
of the reporter (Fig. S1A). Thus, if any DPO is
produced by a Tdh-independent mechanism(s), it
is insufficient to elicit the order-of-magnitude
difference in PvqmR activity between the ∆vqmA
and ∆tdh V. cholerae strains in Fig. 1A. To test the
second possibility, that VqmA is stable and
possesses measurable activity in the absence of
DPO, we produced VqmA in WT (i.e., tdh+) and
tdh::kan E. coli and assessed its solubility. E. coli,
like V. cholerae, produces DPO in a Tdhdependent manner (8). Fig. 1B shows that
comparable amounts of soluble VqmA were
obtained from the WT and tdh::kan strains,
irrespective of the addition of DPO. To eliminate
the possibility that a trace amount of DPO is
produced by the tdh::kan strain, or that some
other ligand stabilizes VqmA in tdh::kan E. coli,
we produced hexahistidine-tagged VqmA (HisVqmA) via in vitro translation using a cell-free
system. In vitro translated His-VqmA protein was
readily produced and soluble (Fig. S1B). Thus,
we conclude that VqmA does not depend on a
ligand to properly fold.
In V. cholerae, VqmA is produced
constitutively whereas vqmR is expressed
predominantly at HCD (8). Given our finding that
the solubility of VqmA is unaffected by DPO (Fig.
1B), we hypothesized that the VqmA DNAbinding capability could be enhanced by DPO. To

examine VqmA DNA-binding as a function of
ligand occupancy, we purified VqmA from
tdh::kan E. coli that had been grown in the
presence or absence of exogenously supplied
DPO (100 µM). We assessed Apo- and HoloVqmA binding to PvqmR DNA using
electromobility shift assays (EMSAs). Our results
show that, at sufficient protein concentrations,
Apo-VqmA shifted PvqmR DNA (Fig. 1C),
consistent with our finding that VqmA possesses
basal activation of PvqmR in the Apo-state. We
found that 2-8-fold more protein was required to
achieve a ~50% shift of the PvqmR DNA with
Apo-VqmA compared to Holo-VqmA (Fig. 1C).
Thus, Holo-VqmA has a higher affinity for
PvqmR than Apo-VqmA. Furthermore, addition
of DPO to Apo-VqmA increased DNA binding to
PvqmR in a DPO concentration-dependent
manner (Fig. 1D). We conclude that the basal
DNA-binding activity of Apo-VqmA is enhanced
when VqmA is bound to DPO. These results
explain why the V. cholerae ∆tdh mutant exhibits
PvqmR-lux expression while the ∆vqmA mutant
does not (Fig. 1A).
Considering the differences in the
biochemical properties of the VqmA receptor
relative to LuxR-type QS receptors, we wanted to
examine whether their control of QS outputs also
differed. To do this, we measured the effect of
DPO binding to VqmA on PvqmR activation,
representing the V. cholerae VqmA pathway, and
compared the results to the well characterized
LasI-LasR QS system from Pseudomonas
aeruginosa. Briefly, in P. aeruginosa, upon
binding 3OC12-homoserine lactone (3OC12-HSL),
LasR activates transcription of many genes
including, germane to our studies, lasB (20). Here,
we introduced the relevant P. aeruginosa and V.
cholerae QS components into E. coli (Fig. 2).
Specifically, we used ∆tdh E. coli as the host for
both reporter systems to eliminate native AI
production (E. coli does not produce 3OC12-HSL).
Into this strain, we introduced a pair of plasmids
encoding either arabinose-inducible vqmA and
PvqmR-lux, or arabinose-inducible lasR and
PlasB-lux. Consistent with our finding in ∆tdh V.
cholerae (Fig. 1A), E. coli producing VqmA in
the absence of DPO generated 15-fold more
PvqmR reporter activity than a strain lacking the
vector harboring arabinose-inducible vqmA (Fig.
2). In response to exogenous DPO, PvqmR-driven

Autoinducer recognition by the VqmA quorum-sensing receptor
light production increased an additional 3-fold.
LasR, by contrast, expressed minimal PlasB-lux
production in the absence of 3OC12-HSL relative
to the no-vector control. In response to 3OC12HSL, a 143-fold increase in PlasB-lux expression
occurred (Fig. 2). Taken together, these results
show that both VqmA and LasR are maximally
activated by their respective AIs. However,
VqmA activity, in contrast to LasR activity, is not
strictly dependent on an AI. In the opposite vein,
the relative activation achieved by 3OC12-HSLLasR is almost two-orders of magnitude greater
than that for the DPO-VqmA complex.
We wondered if the ligand-independent
response we observed for V. cholerae VqmA
extended to other VqmA proteins, such as that
from the phage VP882-encoded VqmA homolog,
VqmAPhage. VqmAPhage binds host-produced DPO
and, in response, activates expression of the gene,
qtip. Qtip promotes host cell lysis (10). Similar to
V. cholerae VqmA, VqmAPhage activated Pqtip
transcription in the absence of DPO, and
activation was enhanced approximately 3-fold
when DPO was added (Fig. S1C). Thus, the
VqmA AI-independent function extends to the
phage-encoded system and is likely an inherent
property of VqmA proteins more generally.

relative to when water was added (Fig. 3A). By
contrast, inclusion of DPO increased the
percentage of PvqmR DNA bound to VqmA ~2-5
fold (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, the consequence of
adding Ala-AA was indistinguishable from that of
DPO (Fig. 3A). That is, Ala-AA also drives
VqmA to bind PvqmR. In vitro translated HisVqmA behaved identically with respect to the
ligands (Fig. S2B). Importantly, we excluded the
possibility that Ala-AA is converted to DPO
under our EMSA conditions using MS (DPO: 125
m/z and Ala-AA: 145 m/z). In each case, the
ligand added, DPO or Ala-AA, was the only
ligand detected by MS (Fig. S2C). Taken together,
we conclude that both DPO and Ala-AA bind and
enhance VqmA DNA binding and transcriptional
activity.
To explore whether binding of DPO and
Ala-AA to VqmA drives the same or different
protein conformational changes, we performed
limited proteolysis. Apo-, DPO-bound, and AlaAA-bound VqmA were all digested by trypsin.
However, the DPO-bound and Ala-AA-bound
VqmA proteins were more susceptible to trypsin
digestion than Apo-VqmA (Fig. 3B). These
results indicate that a conformational change
occurs upon ligand binding, and, moreover, that
the change is similar for both ligands. Indeed, in
companion experiments, we assessed the binding
of DPO and Ala-AA to Apo-VqmA using thermal
shift analysis. Both ligands caused similar
increases (about 6°C) in thermal stability of
VqmA (Fig. S2D). Our data support a model in
which both DPO and the linear Ala-AA molecule
bind VqmA and effectively activate its
transcriptional activity.
The above results show that Ala-AA and
DPO have identical activities in both our in vivo
cell-based and in vitro protein-based assays. One
caution, however, is that Ala-AA is the presumed
DPO-precursor, but its in vivo role has not been
verified. After DPO was discovered and
threonine and alanine were shown to be
incorporated into DPO, the prediction of Ala-AA
as the DPO-precursor was put forward based on
common chemical reactions in which amino acids
and amino-containing compounds participate (8).
Here, we aimed to prove or disprove whether AlaAA is indeed the biological precursor to DPO. To
do this, we conducted isotopic labeling
experiments to determine whether Ala-AA

The proposed linear DPO precursor Ala-AA
binds to and activates VqmA
As noted, Tdh is required to convert Lthreonine to AKB, which spontaneously
decarboxylates to aminoacetone. Aminoacetone
is presumed to condense with L-alanine to form
the putative DPO precursor Ala-AA (8) (Fig.
S2A). Consistent with the placement of threonine
upstream and Ala-AA downstream of Tdh in this
pathway, we previously showed that exogenous
addition of Ala-AA, but not threonine, restores
PvqmR-lux expression in ∆tdh V. cholerae to WT
levels (8). This finding suggested one of two
possibilities: first, in our cell-based assay, the
cells convert Ala-AA to DPO, and newlyproduced DPO drives PvqmR-lux expression.
Alternatively, Ala-AA could bind to VqmA and
induce PvqmR-lux expression without conversion
to DPO. To distinguish between these
possibilities, we performed EMSAs using ApoVqmA to which we added either threonine, DPO,
or Ala-AA (Fig. 3A). As anticipated, provision of
L-threonine did not increase VqmA binding

cholerae and analyzed incorporation of the
deuterium label into DPO by LC-MS. As controls,
we also administered d3-Ala-AA to: (1) medium
alone to eliminate the possibility of spontaneous
conversion in the absence of cells; (2) tdh
vqmA V. cholerae to confirm that binding to
VqmA is not required for conversion; and (3) to
WT V. cholerae to show that the amount of
labeled DPO (d3-DPO) extracted is identical
between the Tdh+ and Tdh- strains to verify that
Tdh is not functioning in any additional
downstream step in the pathway. We detected d3DPO in extracts at approximately 5% of the total
concentration of added d3-Ala-AA (Fig. S3B).
However, analysis of our synthetic preparations
of Ala-AA and d3-Ala-AA showed that
approximately 5% DPO and d3-DPO,
respectively, are present (Fig. S3C) as
irremovable impurities. The presence of small
amounts of DPO demonstrated the facile nature
of Ala-AA to undergo cyclization at neutral pH or
basic conditions. Thus, in the labeling
experiments, the low level of d3-DPO present in
the extracts can be attributed to the starting
material and it is not a consequence of enzymatic
conversion of d3-Ala-AA to d3-DPO (Fig. S3C).
There was no case in which administration of d3Ala-AA to cells resulted in accumulation of
recovered DPO with a 3 Da mass shift above the
background level. This result suggests that, at
least under our conditions, exogenously supplied
Ala-AA is not converted into DPO in vivo (Fig.
S3B). We suspect that some other compound
could be the precursor to DPO and we are
working to discover its identity. Nonetheless, our
findings with Ala-AA are curious as they show
that the VqmA receptor binds to and is activated
by an apparently non-pathway substrate. We
return to ideas concerning the ramifications of
these findings in the Discussion.

multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (Table
S1). The structure of the DPO-VqmA complex
bound to DNA was reported recently (17).
Additionally, during preparation of this
manuscript, the structure of DPO-VqmA without
DNA was reported with a similar conformation as
in our structure (18). Together, the three
structures enabled comparisons to discover the
conformation changes VqmA undergoes upon
DNA binding, and in the context of our work, to
gain insight into how VqmA could bind both
DPO and Ala-AA.
The DPO-VqmA complex is a head-tohead dimer with 1:1 protein:ligand stoichiometry.
The structure revealed two distinct domains: an
N-terminal PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) ligand-binding
domain (LBD) and a C-terminal HTH (helixturn-helix) DNA-binding domain (DBD) (Fig.
4A). The N-terminal PAS LBD consists of a
characteristic five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet
core, which forms the DPO binding pocket along
with several α-helices and loops, and this domain
contains the bulk of the buried surface area of the
dimerization interface (Fig. 4B, C, respectively).
The PAS domain is connected to the C-terminal
HTH DBD by a long flexible loop region. The
DBD has a stereotypical HTH tetra-helical fold,
which is common in transcription factors,
including LuxR-type QS receptors (Fig. 4D).
Both the LBD PAS and DBD HTH domains are
common across biology. However, according to
the DALI server (21), which uses structures from
the Protein Data Bank to assess structural
homologies based on fold rather than amino acid
sequence, protein structures containing a domain
composition similar to VqmA have not otherwise
been reported. The closest VqmA homologs
based on fold either contain the PAS domain as
part of a signal transduction protein (i.e. TodS and
VraR) or the HTH domain as part of a
transcription factor (i.e. CviR and VpsT), but not
both (Table S2).
The VqmA HTH region is enriched in
positively charged residues. Within this region,
we predicted that the residues K185, K193, and
R195 are important for DNA binding due to their
solvent accessibility and their conservation
among VqmA orthologs (Fig. 4D). Indeed, as
judged by EMSA analysis, changing any of these
residues to alanine eliminated VqmA DNA
binding (Fig. S4). This analysis is consistent with

Structural and biochemical characterization of
VqmA
To explore the molecular basis
underlying VqmA binding to ligands, we solved
the crystal structure of VqmA bound to DPO in
the absence of DNA to 2.0 Å using

Autoinducer recognition by the VqmA quorum-sensing receptor
the structure of VqmA bound to DNA, which
shows that residue K185 makes direct contact
with the DNA backbone (17). We compared our
structure of DPO-VqmA with a recently reported
structure of DPO-VqmA-DNA (17). Alignment
based on the LBD PAS domains reveals a
conformational change of approximately 30 Å
and a rotation of nearly 120° for the DBD (Fig.
4E). Thus, the DBD of the DNA-free VqmA
protein adopts an open conformation, apparently
conducive to DNA binding, while DNA-bound
VqmA exhibits a closed conformation.
To probe the VqmA ligand binding
requirements, we tested a panel of 15 synthesized
or commercially available pyrazine, pyrimidine,
and pyridine DPO analogs (Fig. 5A). We used the
V. cholerae ∆tdh PvqmR-lux reporter strain and
companion ITC analysis to, respectively, assess
activation of and binding to VqmA (Fig. 5B and
Table S3, respectively). Surprisingly, given the
promiscuity VqmA displays with respect to DPO
and Ala-AA binding, VqmA is highly selective in
terms of cyclic compounds: VqmA responded
most avidly to DPO, and the most potent analogs,
capable of inducing maximal lux expression, had
EC50 values 6-8-fold higher than that of DPO (Fig.
5C). Our results indicate that a 2’ hydroxyl or 2’
carbonyl group is necessary for binding to VqmA
(Table S3) and promoting its transcriptional
activity (Fig. 5C). Indeed, compound 10, which
differs only from DPO by the lack of the 2’
hydroxyl group, was inactive and showed no
binding to VqmA (Fig. 5B and Table S3).
Our crystal structure shows that DPO
binding is primarily mediated by π-π stacking
forces contributed by residues F67 and F99
coupled with hydrogen bonding between the
DPO 2’ carbonyl group and residue K101 (Fig.
4B). We note that DPO exists as the enol form in
solution (8). Here, we built the keto tautomer of
DPO in our crystal structure because it best fits
the local density. Likely, the difference between
the restricted condition in the crystal and the
unrestricted environment in solution drives the
preference for a particular tautomer. To verify our
structure and to explore how VqmA could bind to
both DPO and to Ala-AA, we conducted sitedirected mutagenesis and tested binding and
activity of DPO and Ala-AA, using an in vitro
ITC assay and our in vivo cell-based reporter
assay, respectively. We determined that, for WT

Apo-VqmA, the Kd for DPO is ~2.3 µM, whereas
the Kd for Ala-AA is ~14 µM (Fig. 6A). As a
negative control, we performed ITC on a linear
Ala-AA derivative called (2S)-2-amino-N-[(2R)2-hydroxypropyl]propanamide (AHP) (Fig. S5A)
that did not activate VqmA in our PvqmR reporter
assay (Fig. S5B), and no binding was detected by
ITC (Fig. S5C). Next, we focused on mutations
in the DPO binding site: K23R, Y36F, F67A,
D71N, D85N, H87A, H97A, F99A, K101R,
F116A, F67A/F99A, and H87A/H97A (Fig. 4B).
ITC results reveal that most of these VqmA
variants exhibited approximately WT binding
affinity for both DPO and Ala-AA (Table 1).
Exceptions were VqmA F67A, VqmA K101R,
and VqmA F67A/F99A, which showed no
binding to either molecule indicating that these
residues are crucial for binding to both DPO and
Ala-AA (Table 1). Notably, VqmA F99A did not
bind Ala-AA but retained residual binding to
DPO (~10-fold higher Kd relative to WT),
suggesting that the contribution of F99 in the π-π
interaction with DPO is less crucial than that of
F67. The finding that VqmA K101R was unable
to bind DPO coupled with the structure-activity
relationship analysis in Fig. 5, suggests that
proper hydrogen bonding between K101 and the
DPO 2’ hydroxyl/carbonyl group is critical for
ligand binding and activity. We suspect that
introduction of the bulkier Arg at position 101
prohibits formation of the required hydrogen
bond at the 2’ position of DPO. A
hydroxypyrimidine (compound 7, Fig. 5A)
reduces the basicity of the oxygen on the 2’
moiety of the ligand, which would weaken its
interaction with K101 relative to DPO. Indeed,
compound 7 had an >800-fold increase in EC50
and exhibited no detectable binding to VqmA (see
Fig. 5C and Table S3). Finally, the VqmA Y36F
and H97A alterations made the Kd values for

stability. Our structure-guided mutagenesis and

Autoinducer recognition by the VqmA quorum-sensing receptor
biochemical analyses suggest that DPO and AlaAA occupy the same binding site on VqmA. To
date, we have been unable to obtain crystal
structures of Apo-VqmA or VqmA bound to AlaAA. Apo-VqmA crystals diffract poorly and AlaAA, while stable in solution as the HCl salt, tends
to cyclize under our crystallization conditions
independent of VqmA.

fold different. To better understand VqmA ligand
binding preferences, we investigated the kinetics
of DPO and Ala-AA binding using stopped-flow
fluorimetry. When excited by 321 nm light, DPO
emission occurs at 392 nm and the fluorescence
is quenched upon binding to VqmA (Fig. S7A).
Ala-AA is not fluorescent, but quenching of
natural VqmA fluorescence (λex=280 nm/λem=340
nm) can be monitored to track Ala-AA binding
(Fig. S7B). We found that the kon for DPO and
Ala-AA are 7.7×104 M-1·S-1 and 1.3×104 M-1·S-1,
respectively, while the calculated koff values are
0.27 S-1 and 0.39 S-1, respectively (Fig. 6C). Thus,
the association rate of DPO is ~6-fold faster than
that of Ala-AA while the dissociation rate of DPO
is modestly slower, ~0.7-fold of that of Ala-AA.
The calculated Kd (koff/kon) values from the
stopped-flow experiments are 3.5 µM (DPO) and
30.5 µM (Ala-AA). This result is consistent with
our ITC data because the differences are within
an order of magnitude, which is well-accepted for
these two methods. Moreover, the relative
differences between the affinities of the two
ligands for VqmA is consistent between the two
methods. Taken together, we conclude that, once
DPO is bound to VqmA, the complex does not
easily dissociate, which prohibits subsequent
binding of Ala-AA to the same binding site. In the
reverse case, DPO can readily replace Ala-AA.

Ala-AA and DPO share the same binding site on
VqmA with DPO being the preferred ligand
Based on the surprising result that both
Ala-AA and DPO bind to and activate VqmA, we
sought to further characterize their interactions
with VqmA to substantiate the same-binding-site
hypothesis raised from our site-directed
mutagenesis experiments. To garner additional
evidence that DPO and Ala-AA bind the same site
on VqmA, we performed an ITC-based
competition assay. We titrated either DPO or AlaAA into VqmA that had been pre-bound to the
other molecule and assessed binding. We found
that binding of the exogenously added molecule
occurred no matter which ligand was pre-bound
(Fig. 6B, left two panels), suggesting that the ~6fold difference in Kd between the two ligands
allows each molecule to displace the other. In a
conceptually similar experiment, we performed
the same titration in the presence of excess of the
pre-bound ligand. Our rationale is that, if Ala-AA
and DPO do share the same binding site in VqmA,
the presence of an excess of the ligand that had
been pre-bound should inhibit binding of the
subsequently-added ligand. In this setup, VqmA
showed a clear preference for binding to DPO.
Specifically, when either an equal concentration
or a 10-fold excess of DPO was provided to DPObound VqmA, Ala-AA was prevented from
replacing pre-bound DPO (Fig. 6B, middle two
panels). In the opposite case, only when there was
at least 10-fold excess Ala-AA could Ala-AA
prevent DPO from replacing pre-bound Ala-AA
on VqmA (Fig. 6B, right two panels). These data
support the hypothesis that DPO and Ala-AA
share the same binding site on VqmA and further
corroborate that, between the two ligands, DPO is
preferred.
The preference VqmA shows for DPO
over Ala-AA in the competitive binding
experiments is curious given that the Kd values of
the two ligands for the Apo-protein are only ~6-

DISCUSSION
In this study, we characterize ligandcontrolled activation of VqmA, a cytoplasmic QS
receptor and transcription factor. We show that
VqmA is soluble, properly folded, and activates
basal-level transcription of its target, vqmR, in the
absence of its cognate AI, DPO. We show that the
transcriptional activity of VqmA is increased in
response to increasing concentrations of DPO,
allowing VqmA to drive the V. cholerae QS
transition to HCD upon DPO accumulation. A
previous study reported that exogenous addition
of DPO to purified Apo-VqmA does not increase
the binding affinity of VqmA for PvqmR (17). We
find that this is not the case as the DPO-bound
VqmA protein has ~2-8-fold higher affinity for
DNA than does Apo-VqmA (Fig. 1C, D). One
possible explanation for this discrepancy is that
the authors of the previous study purified VqmA
from WT E. coli, which is tdh+. As mentioned,
WT E. coli makes DPO and VqmA produced in E.

Autoinducer recognition by the VqmA quorum-sensing receptor
coli binds to it (8). Thus, the authors’ putative
Apo-VqmA could in fact have been Holo-VqmA.
Consequently, their VqmA was likely saturated
with DPO, and addition of more DPO would not
enhance the VqmA DNA binding properties.
We contrast the behavior of the VqmA
receptor to that of a canonical LuxR-type QS AI
receptor-transcription factor that is activated only
when the ligand is present (Fig. 2). While we
cannot exclude issues arising from using different
reporter systems, the dramatic difference in foldchange we observed between the VqmA and
LasR receptors in the presence versus absence of
their cognate AIs (3-fold for DPO/VqmA and
143-fold for 3OC12-HSL /LasR) leads us to
speculate on the biological consequences of the
differences between these systems. In particular,
the ability of VqmA to function in both a ligandindependent and ligand-dependent manner
enables the VqmA pathway to be active across all
cell densities. In contrast, because LasR requires
its AI for folding and activity, induction of the
LasR pathway likely occurs exclusively under
conditions when AI is present. We suggest that
VqmA proteins are poised to rapidly respond to
DPO when it appears. By contrast, LuxR-type
receptors require accumulation of cognate AIs for
proper folding and activation, therefore delaying
QS activation to later in growth. Lastly, we note
that while V. cholerae vqmA is expressed
constitutively, vqmAPhage is not (10). While we do
not yet know the natural inducer of vqmAPhage, we
suspect that its production is regulated. We
propose that the DPO-independent activity of
VqmAPhage could allow the phage to overcome the
requirement for the host to produce the AI and
enable lysis provided that sufficient VqmAPhage is
present.
The VqmA crystal structures reveal that
the DPO binding pocket is located in the Nterminal PAS domain. Previous reports compared
the VqmA fold to that of LasR, TraR, CviR, and
other LuxR-type proteins (17,18), the latter of
which, as mentioned, function via simultaneous
binding and folding around AHL AIs (13,15,16).
While this comparison is certainly informative, it
is also worth noting that LuxR-type proteins do
not contain PAS domains. PAS domains contain
characteristic five stranded antiparallel β-sheet
cores, while the LBDs of LuxR-type proteins
contain four stranded antiparallel β-sheet cores.

The divergence in folds is exemplified by the
relatively low Z-scores of LuxR-type proteins
compared to the VqmA structure (Table S2). We
imagine that the LBDs of LuxR-type proteins
constrain their selectivity to AHL molecules. By
contrast, PAS domains are one of the most highly
represented domains among signaling proteins
and are capable of recognizing a wide range of
ligands and sensory inputs, such as redox, light,
gases, and metabolites (22-24). Within
prokaryote taxa, however, it is unusual for a
single PAS domain to bind multiple structurally
diverse ligands (23). We are curious to discover
what properties conferred by the VqmA PAS
domain might enable the receptor to bind both the
cyclic DPO and the linear Ala-AA molecules.
Finally, despite the prevalence of PAS domains,
VqmA represents a unique structure for QS
receptors.
Our site-directed mutagenesis and ITC
results indicate that DPO and Ala-AA use the
same site in VqmA because the identical residues
are required for binding and activation by both
ligands. Confirmation comes from the
competition and kinetic assays. We do note that
the enthalpy changes measured in the ITC
competition assay (Fig. 6B) are not the same as
those that we measured for binding of DPO and
Ala-AA to Apo-VqmA when there is no
competition (Fig. 6A). While not investigated
here, one possibility is that some Apo-VqmA
remains present when we pre-bind VqmA to a
ligand due to ligand association and
disassociation. During the competition ITC, a
portion of the ∆H value could stem from ligand
binding to the small fraction of Apo-VqmA that
is present. A second possibility is that ligand
replacement in the binding pocket during the
competition involves more than simply ligand
exchange, for example protein breathing.
As noted, Ala-AA was a proposed
intermediate in DPO production based on the
knowledge that threonine and alanine are both
substrates in DPO biosynthesis, and the proven
structure of DPO (8). However, our present work
indicates that Ala-AA is likely not the biological
DPO precursor. Nonetheless, it is clear that AlaAA is able to activate VqmA similar to DPO. It is
not simply a matter of the VqmA receptor
displaying ligand promiscuity, as we find VqmA
is selective for DPO relative to other pyrazine

Autoinducer recognition by the VqmA quorum-sensing receptor
analogs (Fig. 5). This result suggests that the
activity conferred by Ala-AA is not coincidental,
but likely the actual precursor to DPO is a
molecule similar to Ala-AA. Identifying the
biological precursor and exploring its role in
VqmA activation are ongoing.
In addition to VqmA, other examples of
proteins capable of binding multiple ligands exist,
particularly those involved in metabolism. For
example, IclR of E. coli binds pyruvate or
glyoxylate, leading to activation or repression,
respectively, of the operon regulating glyoxylate
metabolism (25,26). This mechanism could
enable a single receptor to measure glycolytic
flux and efficiently adjust gene expression
accordingly. Second, BenM of Acinetobacter
binds benzoate and muconate, where muconate is
a product of benzoate metabolism (27-29).
Simultaneous binding of both molecules leads to
transcriptional activation of the benABCDE
operon, which further accelerates catabolism of
benzoate to muconate (27-29). This arrangement
enables Acinetobacter to tightly control the
expression of genes required for the degradation
of benzoate, only activating them when their
functions are required. Distinct from both of these
cases, VqmA binds to either DPO or Ala-AA, but
not both, to induce maximal transcriptional
activity. This result is curious to us given that QS
receptors typically maintain signaling fidelity by
distinguishing between different ligands (30-33).
This situation appears analogous to that of the V.
cholerae
AI
called
CAI-1
((S)-3hydroxytridecan-4-one) and its biosynthetic
precursor, Ea-CAI-1 (3-aminotridec-2-en-4-one).
The study of Wei et al. showed that Ea-CAI-1 is
a potent activator of CqsS, but this precursor is
likely more sensitive to hydrolysis than CAI-1,
and therefore is too unstable to be a satisfactory
QS signal (34). Given that pyrazine molecules are
known to be stable compounds (35) and Ala-AA
tends to cyclize, we hypothesize that while DPO
is not an absolute requirement for VqmAmediated QS, DPO could be the more optimal AI
relative to Ala-AA because of its stability and
potency.
Finally, we do note that all three V.
cholerae QS systems converge to control an
overlapping group of targets, including the aphA
gene encoding the QS master regulator AphA (6,9)
that is expressed at LCD when AI concentrations

are below their detection thresholds. The HCD
responses to CAI-1, AI-2 (4,5-dihydroxy-2,3pentanedione) (36,37), and the DPO (8) AIs drive
repression of aphA. VqmA, because it does not
strictly require an AI for activity, activates some
vqmR expression at LCD, leading to some
repression of aphA. Thus, VqmA-controlled QS
could provide a mechanism to attenuate AphA
production, and thus alter expression of its
downstream targets, prior to when sufficient
levels of CAI-1, AI-2, and DPO have
accumulated for the transition to the HCD QS
state. Subsequently, DPO-VqmA-mediated QS
could reinforce repression of aphA once V.
cholerae has committed to the HCD QS program.
Thus, the VqmA QS circuit could be important, at
all cell densities, for fine-tuning the expression of
QS target genes, and in turn, collective behaviors.

chloroformate (3.06 g, 22.40 mmol, 2.94 mL, 1.0
eq). The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at
0 °C for 1 hr. Then (2R)-1-aminopropan-2-ol
(2.52 g, 33.60 mmol, 2.65 mL, 1.5 eq) was added
to the reaction mixture, and the resulting mixture
was allowed to warm to RT at stirred 11 hr. The
reaction was concentrated under reduced pressure
to remove THF. The reaction mixture was diluted
with H2O (50 mL), then extracted with EtOAc (2
x 30 mL). The combined organic layers were
dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated
under reduced pressure to give a residue. The
residue was purified by silica column
chromatography (PE:EtOAc = 1:1 to 0:100) to
afford

To a solution of benzyl ((S)-1-(((R)-2hydroxypropyl)amino)-1-oxopropan-2yl)carbamate (1 g, 3.57 mmol, 1.0 eq) in MeOH
(10 mL) was added Pd(OH)2/C (1 g, 20% by
weight) under N2. The suspension was degassed
under vacuum and purged with H2 several times.
The mixture was stirred under H2 (15 psi) at RT
for 2 hr. The reaction mixture was flushed 3x with
N2 to degas then filtered through a pad of Celite
to remove the Pd, and the filter cake was washed
with MeOH (3 x 10 mL). The filtrate was
concentrated under reduced pressure to give a
residue. The residue was purified by alumina

reaction mixture was allowed to stir for 1 hr at
0 °C and then warmed to RT and stirred for 12 hr.
The reaction mixture was diluted with NaHCO3
(20 mL) and extracted with EtOAc (3 x 20 mL).
The combined organic layers were dried over
Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced

residue was diluted with NaOH (10%, 20 mL),
then extracted with DCM (3 x 30 mL). The
combined organic layers were dried over Na2SO4,
filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure
to give a residue. The residue was purified by
silica gel column chromatography (PE:EtOAc =

Methyl
2(trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy)propanoate
A
solution
of
methyl
2hydroxypropanoate (5.0 g, 48.03 mmol, 4.59 mL,
1.0 eq) and 2,6-dimethylpyridine (5.15 g, 48.03
mmol, 5.59 mL, 1.0 eq) in DCM (50 mL) was
cooled to -10 °C, degassed and purged with N2 for
3
times,
then
trifluoromethylsulfonyl
trifluoromethanesulfonate (16.26 g, 57.63 mmol,
9.51 mL, 1.2 eq) was added dropwise at -10 °C
under N2. The resulting reaction mixture was
stirred at -10 °C for 30 min under N2 atmosphere.
The reaction mixture was quenched by addition
of aqueous hydrochloric acid (0.5 M, 50 mL) and
stirred at - 10°C for another 30 min, then the
reaction mixture was transferred to a separatory
funnel and the layers were separated. The organic
layer was washed with brine (30 mL), dried over
Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced
pressure to give a residue. The residue was
purified by silica gel column chromatography
(PE:EtOAc = 100:0 to 10:1) to afford methyl 2(trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy)propanoate (6.03 g,
53% yield) as a brown oil. 1H NMR (400 MHz,
CDCl3) δ = 5.25 (q, J = 7.0, 1H), 3.87 (s, 3H),

Step 2: Methyl (2-methyl-1-(tritylamino)propan2-yl)-alaninate
2-methyl-N1-trityl-propane-1,2-diamine
(5.0 g, 15.13 mmol, 1.0 eq) and Et3N (1.53 g,
15.13 mmol, 2.11 mL, 1.0 eq) were dissolved in
DCM (50 mL) and cooled to 0 °C. Next, methyl
2-(trifluoromethyl-sulfonyloxy)propanoate (3.57
g, 15.13 mmol, 1.0 eq) was added, and the
resulting reaction mixture was allowed to stir for
1 hr at 0 °C and then warmed to RT and stirred
for 6 hr. The reaction mixture was diluted with
NaHCO3 (50 mL) and extracted with EtOAc (3 x
30 mL). The combined organic layers were dried
over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated under
reduced pressure to give a residue. The residue
was
purified
by silica

column

Bioluminescence assays
Assays were performed as described (8)
with the following modifications: V. cholerae
reporter strains were grown overnight and backdiluted to OD600 = 0.005 in M9 medium
supplemented with threonine and leucine. 150 μL
of culture was transferred to the wells of a 96-well
plate, followed by addition of 50 μL of cell-free
culture fluids. Synthetic molecule standards were
prepared in M9 medium, and 50 μL of these
preparations were added to the V. cholerae
reporter strains in place of cell-free fluids. AI
dose response assays were performed as
described (10) with the following modifications:
198 μL aliquots of cell cultures were dispensed
into a 96-well plate with 2 μL aliquots of seriallydiluted synthetic compounds. Control wells
received 2 μL of solvent (water or 10% NaOH).

Autoinducer recognition by the VqmA quorum-sensing receptor
Electromobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)
EMSAs were performed as described
(10). If not specified otherwise, the highest
concentration of VqmA assessed was 130 nM.
Two-fold serial-dilutions of protein were used to
generate lower concentrations. Biotinylated
PvqmR DNA (540 pM) was used in all EMSAs.
The percent of PvqmR DNA bound was
calculated using the gel analyzer tool in ImageJ.

DPO extraction from cell-free culture fluids
V. cholerae strains were grown overnight
and back-diluted to OD600 = 0.005 in M9 medium
supplemented with leucine. The cultures were
grown to OD600 = ~ 1.0, followed by incubation
with 100 μM synthetic DPO or 100 μM synthetic
d3-Ala-AA for 15 min. DPO, d3-DPO and d3-AlaAA were extracted from cell-free culture fluids
by SPE (HyperSep Hypercarb SPE cartridges,
Thermo). Chromatographic separation was
achieved with increasing concentrations of
acetonitrile (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 50%, and
100%). The relative quantities of DPO, d3-DPO,
and d3-Ala-AA were determined by LC-MS
(described below). Samples were back-diluted
1:10 in water prior to column injection. Standards
containing synthetic DPO, Ala-AA, or d3-Ala-AA
were prepared in 2% acetonitrile.

Production of cell-free translated protein
Cell-free translated His-VqmA was
produced using the S30 T7 High-Yield Protein
Expression System (Promega) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol with the following
amendments: 1.5 μg purified plasmid DNA,
encoding His-VqmA under the T7 promoter, was
used as the template; 40 U of Murine RNase
inhibitor (NEB) was added; 5 reactions were
pooled together; and the reactions were incubated
(translated) for up to 1.5 h at 37C. After
translation, the His-VqmA was purified using
MagneHis Ni-Particles (Promega).

Ala-AA conversion to DPO
10 μM synthetic Ala-AA or 10 μM
synthetic DPO was incubated with 50 μM ApoVqmA in EMSA buffer. Each single component
was also diluted into EMSA buffer as a control.
Following incubation for 15 min, excess and nonprotein-bound small molecules were removed by
size-exclusion chromatography (Zeba), and the
resulting protein was heated to 70°C for 10 min.
Denatured protein was removed by centrifugation
(13,000 x g, 10 min) and supernatants were
assessed for Ala-AA or DPO by LC-MS
(described below).

(VqmA, LasR, or VqmAPhage) and a second
plasmid containing the cognate target promoter
(PvqmR, PlasB, or Pqtip, respectively) fused to
lux (10,38) was used. In parallel, a control strain
for each system was used that carried the reporter
plasmid alone (PvqmR-lux, PlasB-lux, or Pqtiplux). Each strain was grown overnight and back
diluted 1:500 into fresh LB containing 0.075%
arabinose and either synthetic AI (20 μM DPO or
1 μM 3OC12-HSL) or an equivalent volume of
solvent (water for DPO and DMSO for 3OC12HSL). 200 μL aliquots of each culture were
dispensed into 96-well plates and the plates were
incubated at 30°C with shaking. OD600 and
bioluminescence were measured at regular
intervals for 20 h. The bars presented in Figs. 2
and S1C represent the timepoints with the largest
differences in relative light units (RLU) between
the AI-receiving and non-receiving samples for
each system. The same timepoints were used for
the reporter-only strains, which received both
arabinose and AI.

d3-Ala-AA
LC-MS
was
performed
with
modifications (10). Samples and standards were
loaded onto a C18 column (1 mm by 100 mm;
ACE 3 C18 AQ, Mac-Mod) using a Shimadzu
HPLC system and PAL auto-sampler (20 μL per
injection) at a flow rate of 70 μL min−1. Full scan
MS data were acquired with an LTQ-Orbitrap XL
mass spectrometer (Thermo) at a resolution of
60,000 in profile mode from the m/z range of 110
to 200. DPO, Ala-AA, d3-DPO, and d3-AlaAA were detected by performing XIC at
m/z values of 125.0714 (C6H9N2O), 145.0977
(C6H13N2O2), 128.0903 (C6H6d3N2O), and

AMX. Data were processed using HKL-3000 and
experimental phases were determined using
single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (41).
Experimental phases were calculated using
SHELX (42). The data sets were subjected to
density modification using PHENIX (43-45) and
the VqmA structure was built manually using
Coot (46) over multiple iterations with further
refinement in PHENIX. Images were generated
using PyMOL.

Protein expression and purification
V. cholerae vqmA was cloned into
pET15b and overexpressed in ∆tdh BL21 (DE3)
E. coli cells using 1 mM IPTG at 37°C for 4 h.
Cells were pelleted at 16,100 x g for 15 min and
resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH
8, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT). Cells were lysed
using sonication and subjected to centrifugation
at 32,000 x g for 30 min. The supernatant was
loaded onto a heparin column (GE Healthcare)
and eluted by a linear gradient from buffer A (20
mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1 mM DTT) to buffer B (20
mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM DTT). Peak
fractions were pooled, concentrated, and loaded
onto a Superdex-200 size exclusion column (GE
Healthcare) in gel filtration buffer (20 mM TrisHCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT).
Proteins were concentrated to 30 mg/mL, flash
frozen, and stored at -80°C.

Proteolytic cleavage time course
Apo-VqmA at 5 µM was incubated in the
presence of 10 µM synthetic DPO, 10 µM
synthetic Ala-AA, or H2O, in a final volume of 90
µL for 15 min at RT. A 10 µL aliquot was mixed
with stop-solution (2X SDS loading buffer with 5
mM PMSF and 5 mM EDTA) to represent the
zero timepoint. Trypsin was added to the
preparations at a final concentration of 171 nM
and incubated at RT for 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, and 20
min. At each time point, 10 µL of the reactions
were added to 10 µL of stop-solution. Samples
were heated to 95°C and subjected to SDS-PAGE.
Thermal shift assay
Thermal-shift analyses of VqmA were
performed as described (30). In brief, VqmA was
diluted to 5 μM in reaction buffer (20 mM TrisHCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl) containing either 10
μM synthetic DPO, 10 μM synthetic Ala-AA, or
an equivalent volume of water in an 18 μL
reaction (final vol). The mixtures were incubated
at RT for 15 min. 2 μL of 200X SYPRO Orange
in reaction buffer were added to the samples
immediately before analysis. Samples were
subjected to a linear heat gradient of 0.05°C s-1,
from 25°C to 99°C in a Quant Studio 6 Flex
System (Applied Biosystems) using the meltingcurve setting. Fluorescence was measured using
the ROX reporter setting.

Crystallization and structure determination
The DPO-VqmA complex was formed
by mixing 1 mM purified Apo-VqmA with 10fold excess synthetic DPO prior to crystallization.
Crystals were obtained by the hanging drop vapor
diffusion method from drops containing a 1:1
mixture of protein:precipitant (0.1 M Tris-HCl
pH 7.3, 16% PEG3350 and 0.2 M Sodium
Malonate) at 22°C. The trays were seeded using
cat whiskers (Spark Bassler). Crystals were
cryoprotected in a solution containing the
precipitant plus 10% (v/v) glycerol. Crystals
belonged to the P 212121 space group with unit
cell dimensions a = 50.4 Å, b = 84.6 Å, c = 111.6
Å. A dataset with heavy atom derivatives was
obtained by soaking the crystals in cryoprotectant
supplemented with 10 mM KAu(CN)2 (Hampton
Research) for 10 min at room temperature (RT)
as reported (40). Crystals were subsequently flash
frozen and stored in liquid N2. Diffraction data
were collected at the NSLS II (National

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)
A MicroCal PEAQ-ITC (Malvern)
instrument was used to measure the binding
affinities between VqmA proteins and ligands at
25°C. All synthetic ligands for ITC were prepared
in gel filtration buffer (described above). For
measurement of Kd, 500 μM ligand was titrated
into 50 μM Apo-VqmA or mutant VqmA proteins

Autoinducer recognition by the VqmA quorum-sensing receptor
using continuous stirring at 750 rpm. For the ITCbased competition assay, 500 μM synthetic AlaAA was titrated into 50 μM DPO-VqmA in the
presence of 0, 50, 500 μM synthetic DPO, and in
the opposite case, 500 μM DPO was titrated into
50 μM Ala-AA-VqmA in the presence of 0, 50,
500 μM Ala-AA. The initial and subsequent 18
injections were 0.4 μL and 2 μL, respectively.
Heat changes during the titration were measured
by the PEAQ-ITC Control software (MicroCal).
Data were fitted and evaluated by the PEAQ-ITC
Analysis software (MicroCal).

Accession code
Atomic coordinates of DPO-VqmA have
been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under
accession code 6UGL.

Stopped-Flow fluorimetry
A SX20 Stopped Flow Spectrometer
(Applied Photophysics) was used for the kinetic
study of ligand interactions with VqmA at 25°C.
DPO and VqmA have fluorescence spectra of
λex=321 nm/λem=392 nm and λex=280
nm/λem=340 nm, respectively. For DPO binding
to VqmA, the kobs was measured by recording the
decrease in DPO fluorescence using a 390 nm
emission interference filter. The concentration of
VqmA was fixed at 2.5 μM, while DPO was
supplied at concentrations from 1-20 μM. For
Ala-AA binding to VqmA, the kobs was measured
by recording the decrease in VqmA fluorescence
using a 302 nm emission interference filter. The
concentration of Ala-AA was fixed at 7.5 μM and
VqmA, from 3 to 37.5 μM, was supplied.
Typically, 5 to 10 traces were recorded and
averaged for each data point. Data were fitted
with an exponential decay equation using
GraphPad Prism6. Formation of complexes
follows this equation: kobs = kon x [Analyte] + koff.
By plotting kobs versus [Analyte], kon and koff are
obtained from the slope and Y-axis intercept,
respectively.
Western blot analysis
Western blot analyses probing for FLAG
fusions were performed as previously reported
(8). V. cholerae cells were collected and diluted
two-fold in Laemmli sample buffer giving a final
concentration of 0.01 OD/μL. Following
denaturation for 15 min at 95°C, 0.1 OD600
equivalents were subjected to SDS gel
electrophoresis. RNAPα was used as loading
control. Signals were visualized using an
ImageQuant LAS 4000 imager (GE Healthcare).
