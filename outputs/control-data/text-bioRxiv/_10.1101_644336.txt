Abstract
Human ether-à-go-go-related gene (Kv11.1, or hERG) is a potassium channel that

15

conducts the delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr) during the repolarization phase of cardiac

16

action potentials. hERG channels have a larger pore than other K+channels and can trap many

17

unintended drugs, often resulting in acquired LQTS (aLQTS). R-roscovitine, a cyclin-dependent

18

kinase (CDK) inhibitor that also inhibits L-type calcium channels, inhibits open hERG channels

19

but does not become trapped in the pore. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings from Xenopus

20

oocytes expressing wild-type (WT) or mutant (T623A, S624A, Y652A, F656A) hERG channels

21

demonstrated that, compared to WT hERG, T623A, Y652A, and F656A inhibition by 200 µM R-

22

roscovitine was ~ 48 %, 29 %, and 73 % weaker, respectively. In contrast, S624A hERG was

23

inhibited more potently than WT hERG, with an ~ 34 % stronger inhibition. These findings were

24

further supported by the IC50 values, which were increased for T623A, Y652A and F656A (by

25

~5.5, 2.75, and 42 fold respectively) and reduced 1.3 fold for the S624A mutant. Our data

26

suggest that while T623, Y652, and F656 are critical for R-roscovitine-mediated inhibition, S624

27

may not be. This relatively unique feature, coupled with R-roscovitine’s tolerance in clinical

28

trials, could guide future drug screens. We discuss our findings and how they lend support for the

29

recent Comprehensive In Vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) guidelines on the re-evaluation of

30

potentially useful drugs that had failed testing due to unintended interactions with hERG.

Introduction
Human ether-à-go-go-related gene, or hERG [Kv11.1], is a voltage-gated potassium
channel critical for nerve and cardiac function [1,2]. In the heart, hERG channels initially open

35

during the depolarization phase of the cardiac action potential (cAP) but immediately inactivate.

36

Upon cAP repolarization, hERG channels de-inactivate and reopen, which allows the ensuing

37

large K+ efflux to speed cAP repolarization [1], limit cardiac excitability, and maintain normal

38

QT intervals [3]. Consequently, mutations in hERG are one of the leading causes of congenital

39

long QT syndrome (cLQTS), with a neonatal incidence rate of up to 1 in 2,500 [4]; abnormal

40

cardiac phenotypes are usually triggered during exercise, arousal, or rest [5].

41

hERG channels are tetrameric proteins, with each monomer consisting of six

42

transmembrane alpha helices (S1-S6) and cytoplasmic amino and carboxy termini [6]. Similar to

43

other voltage-gated channels, S1-S4 is considered the primary voltage-sensing region, with S4

44

containing positively-charged residues that move slowly outward to induce the characteristically

45

slow activation kinetics of hERG [7,8]. The four S5 and S6 helices and their intervening

46

sections, including the P-loops and P-helices, form the pore and selectivity filter of the channel

47

[9,10]. The pore is thought to have a region between the pore helix and the S6 segments that may

48

provide pockets for drug binding [11]. Together with a strong negative electrostatic potential, the

49

hERG pore becomes highly susceptible to unwanted drug interactions , which can result in

50

current inhibition and acquired long QT syndrome (aLQTS) [12]. aLQTS greatly predisposes

51

individuals to lethal cardiac arrhythmias [13], and is by far more common than cLQTS. It is

52

estimated that 1 out of every 5 intensive care unit (ICU) patients experiences a form of cardiac

53

arrhythmia that is highly influenced by QT-prolonging medications [14–16]. Because of the

54

dangerous side effects, pharmaceuticals have been routinely screened for hERG interaction

55

[17,18], which has unfortunately led to the loss of promising drugs that may not have posed a

56

clinical proarrhythmic risk [19]. Interestingly, many clinically-safe drugs turned out to inhibit

57

hERG, which prompted CiPA guidelines recommending the re-evaluation of previously

58

discarded, yet promising drugs; the features of such drugs are under investigation [19].

59

R-roscovitine is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor that has been used in clinical

60

trials for cancer and for Cushing’s disease [20,21]. We previously found that R-roscovitine also

61

blocks voltage-gated K+channels by binding to the open state [22]. This interaction may partially

62

contribute to R-roscovitine’s anticancerogenic effects since voltage-gated K+channels, including

63

hERG channels, are overexpressed in many cancer cell lines and are linked to tumorigenesis

64

[23,24]. R-roscovitine inhibits hERG channels in a unique fashion [25]: 1) it blocks open hERG

65

channels and does not become trapped in the pore during channel inactivation or closing, 2) it

66

has low or no preference to closed and inactivated states, and 3) it does not exhibit use-

67

dependence, suggesting very rapid block and unblock kinetics [25]. These distinct characteristics

68

of R-roscovitine, as well as the absence of arrhythmic side effects during clinical trials [20],

69

alluded to a potentially unique binding mechanism for R-roscovitine compared to other hERG

70

inhibitors. Thus, we set out to investigate the hERG binding determinants for R-roscovitine.

71

Using electrophysiological recordings on mutant hERG channels, we found that two

72

hERG residues (S624 and Y652) that, otherwise concordantly contribute to drug interactions

73

[26], have opposing effects on R-roscovitine mediated inhibition. Specifically, hERG Y652A

74

resisted R-roscovitine inhibition while hERG S624A currents were strongly inhibited,

75

significantly more so than WT currents. We also characterized two other residues frequently

76

involved in binding to hERG blockers: a residue adjacent to the selectivity filter (T623) and

77

another S6 helix residue (F656). The mutation of either residue significantly weakened R-

78

roscovitine block, suggesting the importance of both residues. These molecular determinants

79

highlight a complexity that may guide future work on open state block specificity. In addition,

Methods

83

RNA Preparation and Oocyte Injection

84

WT and mutant (T623A, S624A, Y652A, and F656A) hERG clones, which were

85

subcloned into a pSP64 vector, were ordered from Addgene (catalog #53051 for WT, #53055 for

86

T623A, #53056 for S624A, #53053 for Y652A, and #53054 for F656A). The vectors were

87

linearized with EcoRI and in vitro transcribed using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6

88

Transcription Kit (Ambion). 1.0 µg of the resulting cRNA was injected (using Nanoject II from

89

Drummond Scientific, with Drummond Scientific glass capillaries) into defolliculated Xenopus

90

laevis oocytes that were generously provided by Dr. Jian Yang and Yong Yu (Columbia

91

University), as well as purchased from Xenopus 1. Oocytes (stages V-VI) were prepared as

92

previously described [27]. Briefly, 2-3 mm size strips from Xenopus laevis ovaries were treated

93

with a solution containing 0.3-0.5 mg/ml collagenase A (Boehringer Mannheim), 82.5 mM

94

NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.6) for ~ 1.5 hours on a shaking

95

incubator set to 175 rpm. A 15-minute rinse on a shaking incubator set to 75 rpm was repeated

96

twice with ND96 solution that contained 96 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM

97

HEPES, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin (pH 7.6), and 5 mM

98

sodium pyruvate (used only with eggs ordered from Xenopus 1). Following the selection of

99

defoliculated oocytes, hERG cRNAs were injected into the oocytes and recordings were

100

performed 2-7 days later. All procedures were in accordance with regulations set by the

101

institutional animal care and use committee.

Solutions and drug administration
Electrodes (Clark capillary glass, number 30-0038, Harvard Apparatus) were pulled on a

104

Narishige PC-10 puller, and used with a resistance of 1-5 MΩ. The intracellular electrode

105

solution contained 3M KCl, while the low potassium extracellular (recording) solution contained

106

[in mM]: 5 KCl, 100 NaCl, 1.5 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES. To elicit large inward tail currents

107

for hERG mutants with reduced permeation, a high potassium extracellular solution was used,

108

which contained [in mM]: 96 KCl, 2 NaCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES. The pH of the

109

external solutions were adjusted to 7.4 using either 1M NaOH (for low K+) or 1M KOH (for high

110

K+), and the osmolarities were 200 mOsm. R-roscovitine was dissolved in DMSO to make a 100

111

mM stock solution that was frozen at -80ºC. Drug-free external solutions (control and wash) had

112

the same DMSO concentrations as the R-roscovitine-containing solutions. Working solutions

113

were prepared on the day of the recordings.

114

Two-Electrode Voltage Clamp (TEVC) Recordings

115

Currents were amplified using the OCT clamp TEVC instrument and data was acquired

116

and analyzed using Clampex and Clampfit, respectively (Axon Instruments). Currents were

117

digitized using a digidata 1440A board at 10 kHz. Leak subtraction was not applied during the

118

recordings. Before recordings began, a pulse protocol was applied to allow hERG runup or

119

rundown to subside. The pulse protocol consisted of a -80 mV holding potential, a 1-second

120

depolarization to +40 mV, and a 1-second repolarization to either -50 mV (for low K+ external

121

solutions) or -120 mV (for high K+ external solutions). The protocol was applied for ~ 3.5

122

minutes. Following this period, other voltage protocols [described below] were applied. All

123

traces were baseline-adjusted to remove the minuscule current that deviated from 0 µA at the -80

124

mV holding potential.

Time-Course Protocol and IC50 Calculations

126

Cells were held at -80 mV. For outward-current hERG constructs, a 1-second

127

depolarizing step from -80 mV to +40 mV was followed by a 1-second repolarization to -50 mV.

128

This pulse was applied repetitively over a span of ~ 33 minutes. A similar protocol was applied

129

to inward-current hERG constructs, but the 1-second repolarization voltage was instead set to -

130

120 mV. Tail currents were measured to generate a time-course of inhibition for each cell before

131

and during application of various R-roscovitine concentrations: 10, 30, 100, 300, and 1000 µM.

132

Fractional block of tail current was calculated for each R-roscovitine concentration as: (Icontrol-

133

IRosc)/Icontrol, with Icontrol being an average of the tail current before a particular R-roscovitine

134

concentration and the maximum drug-free current elicited from the cell [i.e. (Ibefore+ Imaxbefore)/2].

135

The fractional block was then plotted against R-roscovitine concentrations and fitted with the

136

following Hill equation to obtain IC50 values: Y = Bottom+(Top-Bottom)/(1+10^((LogIC50-

137

X)*HillSlope)), where X is the log of the concentration, Top and Bottom (constrained to 1 and 0,

138

respectively) are the curve plateaus, LogIC50 is the center of curve, and HillSlope is the slope

139

factor.

140

Step Depolarization and Step Repolarization Protocols

141

Cells were held at -80 mV and 2-second voltage steps were applied in 10 mV increments

142

from -50 mV to +60 mV. The resulting step currents were measured as current means from the

143

final 50 ms of the depolarization, which were then normalized and plotted against step voltages

144

to generate step I-V curves. Following the depolarizing steps, cells were repolarized to -50 mV

145

for 1.5 seconds, eliciting tail currents. Peak tail currents were normalized and plotted against step

146

voltages for tail I-V curves, which were fitted with the following Boltzmann sigmoidal equation

147

to obtain activation curves: Y = Bottom+(Top-Bottom)/(1+exp((V50-X)/Slope)), where Top and

148

Bottom are the curve plateaus (constrained to 1 and 0, respectively), V50 is the step voltage that

149

elicits 50% channel activation, and Slope is the steepness of the curve. Percent inhibition of step

150

and tail currents with 200 µM R-roscovitine was calculated as: (Icontrol-IRosc,200µM)/Icontrol, with

151

Icontrol being the current size before 200 µM R-roscovitine application.

152

A step repolarization protocol was used for inward-current hERG constructs. Following

153

1-second depolarization steps to +60 mV, 2-second repolarization voltages were applied in 20

154

mV decrements from +20 mV to -120 mV. The resulting peak tail currents were then normalized

155

and plotted against tail voltages to acquire tail I-V curves, which were fitted with a second-order

156

polynomial equation (quadratic): Y = B0+B1*X+B2*X2. To obtain reversal potentials (Erev), the

157

equation was solved for Y = 0. Similar to step and tail current inhibitions [during step

158

depolarization protocols] with 200 µM R-roscovitine, percent inhibition of tail currents with 500

159

µM R-roscovitine was calculated as: (Icontrol-IRosc,500µM)/Icontrol, with Icontrol being the current size

160

before 500 µM R-roscovitine application.

161

Data Analysis and Statistics

162

Calmpex was used for data acquisition and Clampfit and Microsoft Excel were used for

163

initial data analyses. GraphPad Prism version 8.0.2 for Macintosh (GraphPad Software, La Jolla

164

California USA) was used to make I-V, time-course, and percent inhibition graphs; it also

165

calculated the nonlinear fits of the tail I-V and fractional block graphs (i.e. Boltzmann, four

166

parameter logistic, and quadratic). Data are represented as mean ± standard error. All statistical

167

analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism. Ordinary one-way ANOVA tests and Kruskal-

168

Wallis tests were followed by post-hoc analyses: Dunnett’s multiple comparison test [for one-

169

way ANOVAs] and Dunn’s test [for Kruskal-Wallis tests], with multiple comparisons reported

R-roscovitine-mediated inhibition of WT hERG in Xenopus oocytes

175

To determine the appropriate concentration of R-roscovitine for comparing different

176

hERG constructs, we wanted to establish the effectiveness of R-roscovitine inhibition on wild-

177

type (WT) hERG channels in Xenopus oocytes. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)

178

of tail currents for R-roscovitine with WT hERG was determined previously in HEK-293 cells

179

(27 µM), but Xenopus oocytes are known to require higher drug doses [25]. Therefore, we

180

injected cRNA for WT hERG into Xenopus oocytes and recorded potassium currents 2-7 days

181

later (see methods). The currents were elicited using a 2-second pulse protocol consisting of a 1-

182

second depolarization to +40 mV followed by a 1-second repolarization to -50 mV, during which

183

tail currents were measured (Fig 1B). This pulse protocol was repeated either every 5 seconds for

184

R-roscovitine concentrations applied in a randomized order (100, 300, 30, and 10 µM) or every

185

12 seconds for ascending R-roscovitine concentrations (10, 30, 100, 300, and 1000 µM), with the

186

various drug concentrations being repeatedly applied and washed off (Fig 1C). Fitting the

187

fractional block of hERG tail currents with a Hill equation resulted in an IC50 for WT of 196 ± 12

188

µM (Fig 1D). Thus, we used 200 µM R-roscovitine for studying inhibition levels of WT and

189

mutant hERG channels.

protocol (top) along with representative traces from a WT cell (bottom) exposed to the indicated

194

R-roscovitine concentrations (10, 30, 100, 300, and 1000 µM). Channels were activated with a 1-

195

second step to +40 mV from -80 mV, and tail currents ( ) were elicited by a 1-second

196

repolarization to -50 mV. The single 2-second episodic pulse was repeated for 3.44 minutes as

200

were fitted with a Hill equation (see methods) to obtain the IC50 for WT hERG (196 ± 12 µM, n

201

202
203

We next compared currents in the presence and absence of the drug during a step

204

depolarization protocol. Specifically, step currents were elicited using a series of 2-second

205

depolarizations ranging from -50 mV to +60 mV (in 10 mV increments), and the subsequent tail

206

currents were recorded during a 1.5-second repolarization step to -50 mV (Fig 2A, n = 14).

207

Typical n-shaped current-voltage (I-V) curves for WT hERG were obtained when step currents

208

were measured at the end of the depolarizing voltages (Fig 2B); the current decline with

209

depolarizing potentials was due to the fast inactivation at these voltages [1,28]. As expected

210

based on a previous study, where R-roscovitine inhibition occurred only with open hERG

211

channels [25], 200 µM R-roscovitine inhibition was weak at both lower and higher voltages (e.g.

212

23.4 ± 4.5 % at -50 mV and 8.2 ± 5.4 % at +50 mV); the diminished inhibition was due to low

213

open probability at low voltages and a strong inactivation at high voltages. Inhibition was

214

strongest at intermediate voltages [where inactivation was weak and open probability high],

reaching a maximum of 43.3 ± 3.0 % at 0 mV (p = 0.0052 for 0 vs. -50 mV, p < 0.0001 for 0 vs.

216

+50 mV, n = 14, one-way ANOVA; Fig 2C).

217

Since hERG channels inactivate very rapidly during step depolarizations, hERG channel

218

block is normally measured from tail currents [29,30]. Following the depolarization step,

219

repolarization to -50 mV allowed hERG channels to deinactivate rapidly and transition to the

220

open state, causing a large efflux of K+ ions (Fig 2A); these tail currents reflect the proportion of

221

channels activated at the preceding depolarized potentials [28,31]. Plotting normalized peak tail

222

currents against step voltages resulted in typical sigmoidal activation curves (Fig 2D, n = 14),

223

with a threshold for current activation of approximately -40 mV and a near-maximum channel

224

activation at +40 mV. Activation curves were fitted with a Boltzmann equation, yielding a V0.5 of

225

activation of -16.5 ± 1.1 mV. Application of 200 µM R-roscovitine shifted the V0.5 of activation

226

by ~ -3 mV (V0.5,Rosc= -19.4 ± 1.1 mV, p = 0.0105 for Ctrl vs. Rosc, n = 14, paired t-test). In

227

addition, R-roscovitine inhibition of tail current significantly increased with depolarization from

228

30.9 ± 4.9 % at -40 mV to 45.6 ± 3.1 % at 0 mV, and reached its maximum of 52.3 ± 2.7 % at

229

+60 mV (p = 0.0134 for -40 vs. 0 mV, p = 0.0004 for -40 vs. +60 mV, n = 14, one-way

230

ANOVA; Fig 2E). Thus, R-roscovitine inhibition of tail current increased with channel

231

activation.

roscovitine

255

Next, we examined currents from hERG mutants to establish their baseline properties

256

before applying R-roscovitine. hERG block is commonly associated with residues located near

257

the selectivity filter (e.g. S624) and on the S6 helices (e.g. Y652) [32,33]. Therefore, single-

258

mutant channels S624A and Y652A were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and subjected to a step

259

depolarization protocol (Fig 3A, top). Step I-V curves for WT, S624A, and Y652A showed

260

maximum step currents at 0 mV, -10 mV, and +10 mV, respectively (Fig 3A, bottom). At +60

which indicated possible incomplete inactivation; this mutant channel was previously

characterized to have impaired inactivation [34]. Boltzmann fits to the activation curves

indicated no significant difference in half-maximal activation between S624A (-17.7 ± 3.2 mV),

284

weaken or abolish drug inhibition [35]. Applying the step depolarization protocol to S624A

285

hERG channels resulted in currents with typical n-shaped step I-V curves and inhibition occurred

286

at intermediate voltages (i.e. between -30 mV and +30 mV; Fig 4B). Surprisingly, mutating the

287

S624 residue did not attenuate 200 µM R-roscovitine current inhibition: S624A and WT step

288

current inhibition were almost identical over a range of step voltages (p > 0.05 for WT vs.

289

S624A between +10 mV and +60 mV, n ≥ 9, one-way ANOVA; Fig 4C). In fact, at a few

290

intermediate voltages, the inhibition of S624A was almost 25% larger than WT inhibition (p <

291

0.05 for WT vs. S624A between -20 mV and 0 mV, n ≥ 9, one-way ANOVA).

292

S624A tail I-V curves had typical sigmoidal curves and a V0.5 of activation of -17.7 ± 3.2

293

mV before R-roscovitine application (Fig 4D). Although there seemed to be a shift during R-

294

roscovitine block (S624A V0.5,Rosc= -3.3 ± 6.1 mV), this shift was not statistically significant (p =

295

0.09, n = 9, paired t-test). Similar to the enhanced step inhibition at intermediate step voltages,

296

S624A tail current inhibition was significantly stronger than WT channel inhibition over a range

297

of depolarized voltages (p < 0.05 for WT vs. S624A between -20 mV and +50 mV, n ≥ 9, one-

298

way ANOVA; Fig 4E). At +50 mV, S624A tail inhibition by 200 µM R-roscovitine reached 66.8

299

± 3.6%, which was larger than WT inhibition (49.9 ± 2.8%) at the same step voltage (p = 0.0012,

300

n ≥ 9 , one-way ANOVA). When we measured dose-response curves, S624A IC50 (152 ± 22 µM)

301

was smaller than WT IC50 (196 ± 12 µM), but this difference did not reach statistical signifiance

302

(p > 0.05 for WT vs. S624A, n ≥ 9, one-way ANOVA; Fig 4F). The persistence of inhibition

303

suggested that S624 may not be required for R-roscovitine inhibition. It remained unclear,

304

however, as to why inhibition levels increased at some voltages in S624A hERG.

311

between -30 mV and +30 mV. C) Percent step inhibition of WT and S624A at varying step

312

voltages. S624A was inhibited more potently than WT at intermediate voltages, where open

313

probability is high (p < 0.05 for WT vs. S624A between -20 mV and 0 mV, nWT= 14, nS624A= 9,

one-way ANOVA). D) S624A tail I-V curves measured at . Smooth lines are Boltzmann fits

315

that generated V0.5 (Ctrl: -17.7 ± 3.2 mV, Rosc: -3.3 ± 6.1 mV) and slopes (Ctrl: 16.3 ± 1.6,

316

Rosc: 44.5 ± 3.3) of activation. No significant shifts in V0.5 of activation occurred with drug

317

application (p = 0.09, n = 9, paired t-test). E) Percent tail inhibition of WT and S624A. When

318

compared to WT over a range of voltages, levels of S624A tail current inhibition were much

319

larger (p < 0.05 for WT vs. S624A between -20 mV and +50 mV, nWT= 14, nS624A= 9, one-way

ANOVA). F) Concentration-response relationship for S624A. Although the S624A IC50 (152 ±

321

22 µM) was lower than the WT IC50 (196 ± 12 µM), there was no statistical difference (p =

We next tested the importance of the Y652 residue, which is a key binding target for

327

several hERG inhibitors [36]. Using the same step depolarization as before (Figs. 2, 3, 4), step

328

and tail currents were elicited in the presence or absence of 200 µM R-roscovitine (Fig 5A).

329

Unlike S624A, Y652A hERG exhibited a reduced inhibition of step current compared to WT

330

hERG (Fig 5B, C; p < 0.05 for WT vs. Y652A between -20 mV and +10 mV, n ≥ 9, one-way

331

ANOVA).

332

Analogous to WT tail I-V curves, Y652A tail I-V curves were shifted to more

333

hyperpolarized voltages by R-roscovitine (V0.5 = -16.5 ± 1.0 mV vs. V0.5,Rosc = -19.6 ± 0.5, p =

334

0.0094, n = 11, paired t-test; Fig 5D). Percent tail inhibition in Y652A was moderately reduced

335

compared to WT between -20 mV and +60 mV, and showed the highest levels of inhibition at

336

large depolarized potentials (p < 0.05 for WT vs. Y652A, n ≥ 9, one-way ANOVA; Fig 5E).

337

Furthermore, the Y652A IC50 (567 ± 122 µM) was ~ 2.75-fold larger than WT (196 ± 12 µM; p

338

= 0.0005 for WT vs. Y652A, n ≥ 8, one-way ANOVA; Fig 5F). The attenuated step and tail

339

current inhibition of Y652A with 200 µM R-roscovitine, as well as the difference in IC50 values

340

between Y652A and WT hERG, seemed to indicate that Y652 is involved in R-roscovitine

341

binding. This was disimiliar to the results for S624A hERG (Fig 4), and made us question

342

whether additional residues in the pore region were involved in R-roscovitine inhibition, and

343

whether they would be more critical.

352

step depolarization protocol (currents measured at ). Boltzmann fits generated V0.5 (Ctrl: -16.5

353

± 1.0 mV, Rosc: -19.6 ± 0.5 mV) and slopes (Ctrl: 12.5 ± 0.8, Rosc: 9.3 ± 0.3) of activation, with

354

a small shift in V0.5 of activation having occurred (p = 0.0094, n = 11, paired t-test). E) Percent

355

tail inhibition of WT and Y652A at their respective step voltages. Levels of Y652A tail current

356

inhibition were significantly reduced compared to WT between -20 mV and +60 mV (p < 0.05

357

for WT vs. Y652A, nWT= 14, nY652A= 9, one-way ANOVA). F) Concentration-response

358

relationship for Y652A. When compared to WT (196 ± 12 µM), Y652A had an ~ 2.9-fold

359

increase in IC50 (567 ± 122 µM) (p = 0.0005 for WT vs. Y652A, nWT= 11, nY652A= 8, one-way

360

ANOVA).

361
362

The high K+ solution alters R-roscovitine inhibition of WT hERG

363

In addition to the residues S624 and Y652, we wanted to test whether other pore residues

364

are more critical for inhibition: T623, a residue adjacent to the selectivity filter, and F656, an S6

365

residue, both of which are commonly associated with hERG block [32]. Mutating these two

366

residues, however, alters permeation such that inward rectification is significant, with very little

367

outward currents present. Thus, a high K+ solution (see methods), coupled with tail current

368

measurements at -120 mV, were required to investigate the T623A and F656A hERG mutants

369

[37,38].

370

With R-roscovitine binding to the hERG pore, it was likely that the large influx of K+ ions

371

and the change in external solution would alter the WT hERG IC50. To determine the dose-

372

response curves for R-roscovitine from WT tail currents, a pulsing protocol was applied,

373

comprised of a 1 second depolarization to +40 mV and a 1 second repolarization to -120 mV;

374

peak tail currents were measured in various R-roscovitine concentrations (Figs 6A, B). Fitting

375

the fractional block of WT hERG tail current with a Hill equation resulted in an IC50 of 513 ± 43

376

µM (Fig 6C, n = 9), an ~ 2.6 fold larger value than that for the low K+ external solution (196 ±

377

12 µM). 500 µM R-roscovitine was, therefore, used with a step repolarization protocol to

378

compare tail currents prior to and during drug application (Fig 6D). Measuring peak tail currents

379

during repolarization shows WT hERG inhibition measured from the tail currents of the step

380

repolarization protocol (see methods). Fitting tail I-V curves with quadratic equations shows that

381

500 µM R-roscovitine shifted the reversal potential from -11.1 ± 3.3 mV to -14.6 ± 2.4 mV (p =

382

0.0237 for Ctrl vs. Rosc, n = 10, paired t-test; Fig 6E; see methods), indicating a slight change in

383

hERG permeation properties with R-roscovitine block. Furthermore, R-roscovitine inhibition

384

levels increased as current direction changed from outward to inward: for example, WT hERG

385

inhibition at both -120 mV (45.2 ± 2.3 %) and -80 mV (45.9 ± 2.5 %) was significantly larger

386

than at +20 mV (27.0 ± 4.3 %; p < 0.0005 for either comparison; Fig 6F). The shift in Erev, along

387

with the increased inhibition at hyperpolarized voltages, supported the idea that R-roscovitine

388

binds to the hERG pore.

402

to -14.6 ± 2.4 mV (p = 0.0237, n = 10, paired t-test). F) Percent tail inhibition of WT hERG at

403

various repolarization voltages. Levels of inhibition were significantly stronger at low voltages

404

than at high voltages (p = 0.0004 for +20 mV vs. -120 mV, p = 0.0002 for +20 mV vs. -80 mV, n

406
407
408

T623A and F656A hERG channels are insensitive to R-roscovitine
R-roscovitine exhibited a very weak inhibition of T623A hERG tail currents during a step

409

repolarization protocol (Fig 7): between -60 mV and -120 mV, T623A inhibition was

410

approximately half that of WT inhibition (p < 0.05 for WT vs. T623A, n = 10, one-way

411

ANOVA). Consistent with reduced inhibition, plotting T623A tail currents against tail voltages

412

resulted in quadratic nonlinear fits that showed no shifts in Erev in the presence of R-roscovitine

413

(Ctrl = -39.7 ± 2.0 mV, Rosc = -40.1 ± 2.1 mV; p = 0.5995 for Ctrl vs. Rosc, n = 10, paired t-

414

test; Fig 7B). Furthermore, the attenuated potency of R-roscovitine with T623A hERG was

415

supported by IC50 value comparisons: T623A IC50 was ~ 5.5-fold higher that that for WT (2786

416

± 488 µM versus 513 ± 43 µM for WT, p = 0.0092, n ≥ 7, Kruskal-Wallis test; Fig 7D). The lack

417

of an Erev shift, along with the weakened inhibition and larger IC50 value compared to WT

418

hERG, demonstrated the importance of T623 for R-roscovitine binding within the hERG pore.

did not show a significant shift occurring with 500 µM R-roscovitine (p = 0.5995 for Ctrl vs.

426

over a range of voltages than WT inhibition (p < 0.05 for WT vs. T623A between +20 mV and -

431

The F656A S6 mutant exhibited the largest levels of resistance to R-roscovitine. Tail

432

currents of F656A hERG, in the presence of 500 µM R-roscovitine during a step repolarization

433

protocol, were minimally impacted (Fig 8A). This initial observation extended to most tail

434

voltages during repolarization (p > 0.05 for Ctrl vs. Rosc between +20 mV and -80 mV, n = 9,

435

paired t-test; Fig 8B). At -120 mV, R-roscovitine inhibition of F656A hERG was only 12.3 ± 2.5

436

%, compared to the 45.2 ± 2.3 % inhibition of WT hERG (p < 0.0001 for WT vs. F656A, n ≥ 9,

437

one-way ANOVA; Fig 8C). Surprisingly, there was a small but statistically significant shift in

438

F656A Erev (-45.1 ± 1.1 mV) by 500 µM R-roscovitine (-42.1 ± 1.7 mV; p = 0.02 for Ctrl vs.

439

Rosc, n = 9, paired t-test). The IC50 for F656A was a ~ 42-fold increased from WT (21526 ±

440

10632 µM versus 513 ± 43 µM for WT, p = 0.0004, n ≥ 5, Kruskal-Wallis test; Fig 8D). These

441

results, as well as the results for T623A hERG (Fig 7), indicated drastic modifications to the R-

442

roscovitine binding site with mutations to either one of these hERG pore residues.

Discussion
In this study we investigated the molecular determinants of R-roscovitine inhibition in the

458

hERG pore, which has not been previously explored. R-roscovitine was expected to have a

459

unique mechanism of inhibition when compared to other hERG inhibitors because of its

460

preferential binding to open hERG channels and the properties outlined previously [25]. Our data

461

suggests this indeed is the case since F656 and T623 are critical components of R-roscovitine

462

inhibition, while S624 seems dispensable and Y652 contributes a relatively weak interaction.

463

This is unlike the vast majority of other drugs for which the importance of these residues had

464

been investigated. For example, MK-499 mediated hERG inhibition is weakened by a mutation

465

to either S624A or Y652A [39], and ranolazine is heavily relient on both Y652 and F656 for

466

inhibition [37]. A similar weakening of block with either S624, Y652, or F656 mutations were

467

observed for many drugs, such as nifekalant [40], terfenadine, cisapride, [41], clofilium, ibutilide

468

[42], bupivacaine [43], and propafenone [44], to name a few.

469

The role of specific pore residues in hERG-R-roscovitine binding

470

Y652A and F656A

471

The first S6 mutant to be characterized with R-roscovitine was Y652A hERG. 200 µM R-

472

roscovitine inhibited both step and tail currents (Figs. 5A, 5B), as well as caused a negative shift

473

in activation curves (Fig 5D). This shift in the presence of R-roscovitine, which is similar for

474

both WT and Y652A, implicates R-roscovitine in open state stabilization/binding [45]. However,

475

Y652A current inhibition levels were distinctly smaller than the inhibition of WT hERG (Figs.

476

5C, 5E), which corroborated other studies that identified Y652 as a critical residue for binding

477

hERG inhibitors [26,36,39]. Nevertheless, the ~2.75-fold increase in IC50 value (Y652A IC50 =

478

567 ± 122 µM, WT IC50 = 196 ± 12 µM) meant that there is a weak but statistically significant

479

leftover inhibition of Y652A tail current (Fig 5E), suggesting that R-roscovitine may still bind to

480

the pore, but perhaps, in a different orientation, and warranted further investigation.

481

The other S6 mutant, F656A hERG, displayed a near complete insensitivity to R-

482

roscovitine; F656A tail currents were almost indistinguishable before and during 500 µM R-

483

roscovitine application (Figs 8A, 8B). The significant loss of inhibition, when compared to WT

484

(Fig 8C), identified F656 as a critical residue for R-roscovitine binding. The larger value for

485

F656A IC50 versus WT further confirmed the critical role of F656. However, in spite of the

486

weakened affinity, there was a positvie shift in F656A Erev during R-roscovitine application,

487

suggesting that permeation is altered in the presence of R-roscovitine. This is in contrast to the

488

lack of a Erev shift with T623A hERG, a mutant that exhibited a very weak, but nonetheless

489

apparent, current inhibition. The reasons for this remain unclear.

490

When comparing the two S6 mutant hERG channels (Y652A and F656A), we observed

491

that the F656A mutation had a much more dramatic effect to abolish inhibition, as compared to

492

the milder effect of the Y652A mutation. This was surprising because these residues have been

493

previously shown to work in conjunction with one another to bind hERG inhibitors [37]. The

494

divergence in the levels of Y652A and F656A inhibition could be due to the difference in

495

binding interactions with R-roscovitine, with F656 primarily supplying a strong π-π/cation-π

496

interaction [28,39]. Future in silico studies will investigate this. A previous study on mexiletine,

497

a type Ib antiarrhythmic agent, had also found a stronger effect of the F656A compared to the

498

Y652A hERG mutation to reduce inhibition (~28-fold versus ~12 fold reduction in IC50 in

499

relation to WT, respectively), but it was proposed that both residues provide π-π/cation-π

500

interactions [46]. In spite of the common molecular determinants, the two drugs appear to have

501

different mechanisms of inhibition, with hERG activation and deactivation rates being affected

502

by mexiletine inhibition but not by R-roscovitine inhibition [25]. It would be intriguing to further

503

characterize interactions between mexiletine and residues in/adjacent to the selectivity filter (i.e.

504

T623 and S624) for an even more extensive pharmacophoric analysis, which may shed light on

505

the underlying preference of R-roscovitine for open state binding.

506

T623A and S624A

507

Residues T623 and S624 are positioned deep within the hERG pore, specifically at the

508

base of the pore helix [28]. With both side chains containing hydroxyl groups, hydrogen-bonding

509

is frequently implicated in their interactions with drugs [39,42,47]. Depending on the orientation

510

and structure of drugs that bind to the pore, mutating these pore residues can impact

511

intermolecular interactions. This was evident with the T623A hERG mutant, which exhibited an

512

overall weak tail current inhibition by R-roscovitine (Fig 7A). Upon analysis the shift in Erev in

513

the presence of R-roscovitine, it was apparent that the drug was not altering permeation (Fig 7B).

514

Furthermore, the larger IC50 value for T623A hERG versus WT hERG suggested that the drug

515

efficacy was reduced by the mutation (Fig 7D). Collectively, our data suggest the drug was no

516

longer able to bind in its original pore location. This level of inhibition loss could represent R-

517

roscovitine’s requirement of hydrogen-bonding to the hydroxyl group of T623 for maintaining

518

normal potency.

519

Surprisingly, step and tail current inhibition were not impacted by mutation to the S624

520

residue (Figs 4B, 4D). In fact, inhibition levels increased in the S624A hERG mutant when

521

compared to WT inhibition at the same voltages (Figs 4C, 4E), and no general increase in IC50

522

was apparent for S624A (Fig 4F). Collectively, these results suggest that S624 in WT hERG is

523

an unlikely binding determinant. S624 has been previously implicated in the dissociation of

524

hERG blockers: recovery from propafenone-mediated inhibition of hERG was significantly

525

reduced in the S624A mutant [44] and, in contrast, S624A sped recovery from clofilium-

526

mediated inhibition [42]. S624A hERG has also exhibited enhancement of inhibition with certain

527

drug analogues [48]. Either way, this residue may be associated with R-roscovitine unbinding,

528

which likely explains the increased inhibition in the S624A mutant.

529

In summary, our experimental results suggest that R-roscovitine has a unique binding

530

orientation within the open WT hERG channel, relying on S6 residues (Y652, F656) and T623

531

but not S624 (a selectivity filter residue). This is, indeed, unlike many other hERG inhibitors

532

mentioned above and likely contributes to its unique pharmacological mechanism of action.

534

Known hERG inhibitors linked to drug-induced LQTS, such as terfenadine, cisapride,

535

astemizole, and sertindole, have been withdrawn from the market due to their inhibition of hERG

536

channels [49]. The initial intrigue of R-roscovitine for this study was that a clinical trial using a

537

range of R-roscovitine concentrations did not find QT prolongation or other cardiac side effects

538

[20], such as those commonly seen with other hERG inhibitors. Thus, studies on R-roscovitine-

539

hERG interactions may shed light on desirable drug features that could be used to identify

540

potentially life-saving drugs that were never tested clinically due to hERG block.

541

One factor that likely contributes to the lack of arrhythmogenic side effects with R-

542

roscovitine is its potency and, more importantly, it pleiotropic effects. R-roscovitine has a low

543

affinity for hERG that may limit its adverse effects, even though the values used in this study and

544

in other research are close to clinically relevant doses (10-30 µM) [50]. (Xenopus oocytes require

545

higher doses than other cells because of their larger size and richer lipid component [51]). The

546

relatively low affinity of R-roscovitine for hERG likely stems from its selective binding to the

547

open state [25], as high affinity hERG inhibitors tend to bind to the inactivated hERG state [52].

548

Furthermore, this drug is unique when compared to class III antiarrhythmic drugs and other

549

hERG inhibitors that, unlike R-roscovitine, exhibit: 1) binding to selectivity filter residues

550

[18,39,53], 2) have relatively slow kinetics of recovery from inhibition, 3) are trapped in the

551

hERG pore, and 4) exhibit use-dependence [25,54–56]. Our results provide a molecular basis for

552

the observed unique R-roscovitine pharmacological properties, where the drug binds to the S6

553

residues (Y652 and F656) and a residue in close proximity to the selectivity filter (T623) but not

554

S624, a selectivity filter residue.

555
556

Another key factor that may explain the lack of arrhythmogenic side effects could be the
‘multiple ion channel block effect’ [57], since R-roscovitine also inhibits L-type calcium

557

channels [22]. Indeed, certain drugs bind to more than one voltage-gated ion channel, causing

558

mutually-opposing actions on cardiac action potentials [58]. As a result, the re-classification of

559

R-roscovitine as a Class VI antiarrhythmic agent was recently proposed due to its selective non-

560

peak block of the late ICa,Lcurrent, which likely averts cardiac arrhythmias [59,60]. Such

561

compensatory mechanisms are now sought after, with the CiPA guidelines recommending that

562

all drugs be screened not only against hERG but also for L-type calcium channel and sodium

563

channel block [19]. Thus, revisiting drugs that were deemed clinically unsafe due to hERG

564

block, but exhibit compensatory drug actions, may yield new pharmaceutical therapeutics and

565

will support the CiPA initiative on proarrhythmia risk assessments.
