Introduction.
The Threshold Electric Skin Sensitivity (TESS) was intensively investigated by many
researchers during the past 100 years and a good survey of the previous literature is discussed
in the work of Notermans, 1966 [8]. He used square wave constant current stimulus and
tried to determine how many variables could have an i nflu ence on th e s kin s ens i ti vi ty to
elect ric st imulati on . He found nearly constant pain th reshold when measured in the same
individual over a course of time. Schumacher et al, 1940 [12] measuring threshold sensitivity
to heat stimulation in an earlier study came to the same conclusion. On the contrary, Lanier, 1943
[6] found that the threshold sensitivity to electric skin stimulation could vary considerably.
Most authors measured the skin sensitivity in m a n y d i f f e r e n t s k i n a r e a s , b u t n o t
r e p e a t e d l y i n s h o r t intervals over the same area of the same subject.
Uher et al, 1963 [13] found decreased electric skin sensitivity above the pubic symph ys is in early
labor and after the adminis tration of oxytocin. He found i n c re as ed s e ns i t i vi t y aft e r
a d min is t rat i on of strychnine. In our previous study Cernoch et al, 1969 [2], was used the
same stimulator with constant voltage square waves on pregnant and puerperal women and
we found long term changes of skin sensitivity. Later, we also found interesting short-term
changes of sensitivity when w e u s e d a s t i m u l a t o r w i t h c o n s t a n t c u r r e n t s q u a r e w a v e s
o n puerperal women after administration of oxytocin and neostigmine. Cernoch et al, 1970 [1]. In
pregnant women we found significant skin sensitivity changes after intravenous administration of
oxytocin already b e f o r e t h e b e g i n n i n g o f t h e u t e r i n e contraction. We tried to find,
under the same conditions, changes in other biophysical parameters of the skin; however,
measurement of the skin temperature and electric conductivity did not reveal any similar
changes. Cupr et al. 1972 [3] was using the same constant current square wave stimulator
constructed by Valosek et al, 1969 [14]. They found different skin sensitivity during and between
the u t e r i n e c o n t r a c t i o n s i n l a b o r i n g w o m e n w i t h a h i s t o r y o f dysmenorrhea and no
change in women with no dysmenorrhea.

As we found in the previous investigation Cernoch et al, 1969, 1970 [2,1], there are long term
and short-term changes of the Threshold Electric Skin Sensitivit y TESS in specific areas
of the abd omen durin g p regnancy, labor, and puerperium. During the labor, the average
TESS above the p u b i c s y mp h ys i s a n d i n t h e l at e ra l a r ea s o f t h e l o w e r abdomen is increased
but around the navel is d ecreased. A fte r admin is t rat ion of ox yt oc i n to p u e r p e r a l w o m e n ,
t h e u s u a l l y s t e a d y T E S S i n t h e lateral abdomen suddenly starts fluctuating up and
down. After a d m i n i s t ra t i on o f n e o s t i g mi n e, t h e re is n o ch a ng e o f s t e a d y T E SS in
lateral areas; but there is a prominent increase of TESS fluctuations around the navel and
above the pubis. These TESS fluctuations may be related to the functional state of the internal organs
like uterus and bowel. The projection referred pain skin area for the uterus is on both sides of the
l owe r abd omen, fus in g t oget h er ab ove t h e p ub ic s ymp h ys is as a referred pain skin area
for the uterine cervix Rubin, 1947 [11]. The referred pain skin area for the bowel is in the midline
of the abdomen. Jones, 1938 [5].

increase (p < 0.01) of TESS fluctuations from th e 2 9t h week of p re gnan cy to th e

decrease in lateral areas; however, few of them had very big TESS fluctuations and that
caused a large variability in the measured data. The control skin area on the right forearm did

and the conclusion reached that the fluctuations of the Threshold Electric Skin Sensitivity (TESS)
changes in certain skin areas of the abdomen during pregnancy, labor and post partum. The
Strength-of-association measure (eta-square) for the statistically signi ficant changes with p <
0.05 was between 11 % and 22%. The eta-square for statistically very significant chan ges
with p < 0.01 was found between 26% and 62 %. It indicates that in these s i t u a t i o n s

Discussion.
Our present work supports the research hypothesis that t here are chan ges of s hort -t erm
Th res h old elect ri c Skin Sensit ivi ty flu ctu ati ons during consecutive stages of pregnancy,
labor, and post partum. Maximal TESS fluctuations were found in all measured skin areas
during late pregnancy and during irregular contractions at the beginning of lab or. Durin g
regu lar uterine cont ractions however, the TESS fluctuations decreased, and we could not
confirm our research hypothesis that there would be some temporal relationship between the
sensitivity curve and the tocographic record of the uterine contraction. Minimal TESS fluctuations
were generally found in most of the skin areas of non-pregnant women and this served us
as a control independent variable. Increased TE SS fl u c t u ati on s du ri n g l at e p re g n an cy

investigation we found, that Threshold Electric Skin Sensitivity (TESS) fluctuates in different
areas of the abdomen and these fluctuations also change during pregnancy, labor and
puerperium. Clinicians are using the manifestations of referred pain in dermatome to help
diagnose pathological and physiological processes of the internal organs in the corresponding
viscerotome inside the human body. Similarly, the exact measurement and recording of
Threshold Electric Skin Sensitivity in dermatome could have diagnostic value. As a non-invasive
method, it could help better understand t h e fu n c t i o n o f i n v o l v e d i n t e r n a l o r g a n s i n t h e
