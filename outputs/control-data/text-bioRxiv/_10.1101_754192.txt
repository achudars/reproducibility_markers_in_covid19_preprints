Summary (150 words)
Thanks to the astonishing advances in genetic manipulation, mouse models have become very
powerful in their ability to interrogate biological processes. Among functional experiments,
misexpression approaches are often modular, such that distinct combinations of driver and effector
lines can be used to achieve different effects. However, existing combinations have pitfalls that
hinder sophisticated applications like tissue-specific reversible gain-of-function. Here, we put
forward an approach that can leverage existing driver modules to achieve inducible and reversible
transgene misexpression with high spatiotemporal resolution, by using an effector allele that
requires the intersection of two drivers, Cre and (r)tTA. We present the mouse lines generated for
such an approach, as well as proof-of-principle experiments using different organs. We also show
that the approach can be extended to other animal models, using chicken embryos. These new tools
will facilitate unraveling biological questions that were previously impeded by technical limitations,
in multiple fields and organisms.

INTRODUCTION
The wealth of genetic tools that have been developed for mouse to study biological questions in
vivo have enabled extremely sophisticated experiments to be conducted. Especially useful is the
modular nature of some tools, in which a mouse line expressing a protein that can induce gene
expression if the right genetic elements are present (driver module) is crossed with a line carrying
the genetic elements that respond to the driver molecule (effector module). In this way only the
offspring combining both modules will show a specific change in gene expression (Kaczmarczyk
and Jackson, 2015; Rosen et al., 2015). In particular, the Cre/loxP system is a very powerful method
for temporal and spatial control of gene expression, by utilizing gene promoters or loci with specific
expression patterns (Smedley et al., 2011). The system has recently reached an unprecedented
degree of sophistication, for example by using knock-ins at a docking site 5' of Hprt for rapid
development of numerous Cre-driver strains, and the use of different types of promoters to either
capture endogenous expression or restrict it to very specific cell types (Korecki et al., 2019).
Nevertheless, the Cre/loxP system is not devoid of pitfalls. First, although there are inducible
versions of Cre (Feil et al., 2009), allowing for temporal control of its activation, the genomic
modification induced by Cre is permanent. Hence, if the desired effect is dependent only on Cre
activity, it cannot be reversed, hampering the possibility of studying the recovery process after the
genetic manipulation. Moreover, despite the supposed specificity of the regulatory regions or loci
used to drive Cre expression, it has been shown that most if not all of the so-called tissue-specific
Cre lines are not exclusively expressed in the tissue of interest (Heffner et al., 2012), giving rise to
off-target effects that can lead to misleading conclusions about the biological process being
interrogated.
The possibility of reversibility has been addressed by using a different driver-effector combination,
known as the Tet system, based on the tetracycline (Tet) resistance operon of E. coli (Hillen and
Berens, 1994). In the first version of this system, a transactivator fusion protein composed of the
tetracycline repressor (tetR) and the activating domain of the herpes simplex viral protein 16
(VP16) can regulate the expression of a gene of interest using a Tet-responsive element (TRE)
containing tet-operator (tetO) sequences. This system is known as Tet-Off, because in the presence
of tetracycline or its analog doxycycline (Dox), the affinity of tetR to tetO sequences diminishes by
9 orders of magnitude, so that expression of the gene of interest is greatly reduced (Gossen and
Bujard, 1992; St-Onge et al., 1996). Conversely, the Tet-On system is based on a reverse
tetracycline-controlled transactivator (rtTA) derived from tTA through four amino acid changes in
the tetR DNA binding moiety. This alters the binding properties of rtTA such that it can only
recognize the tetO sequences in the presence of Dox (Gossen et al., 1995). While the first

generation tool was quite leaky, showing expression in the absence of Dox, subsequent mutations
improved the sensitivity and specificity of rtTA, rendering it a useful tool (Urlinger et al., 2000).
Another problem that initially encumbered Tet systems was that the TRE DNA sequences can be
inactivated through epigenetic mechanisms, rendering them unreliable unless de-repressed by
additional genetic modules (Godecke et al., 2017). Fortunately, this drawback was overcome when
a systematic screen identified a locus in the mouse genome that does not show this inactivation
(Zeng et al., 2008). Indeed, Tigre (also known as Igs7) is an intergenic region on mouse
chromosome 9 that provides a safe harbor from which TRE-dependent expression can be tightly
regulated (hence the name).
Despite these advances, however, both the Cre/loxP and the Tet-On/Off systems are still prone to
off-target effects due to non-specificity of the promoter sequences or gene loci driving the
expression of Cre/(r)tTA. One way to address this caveat is to employ separate fragments of the Cre
recombinase (known as “split cre”) that are expressed from distinct drivers, resulting in Cre activity
(loxP excision) only in the intersectional cell population where both halves of Cre are expressed
(Hirrlinger et al., 2009). A similar intersectional approach is to have a responder module that
depends on two types of recombinases (e.g. Cre and Flp), such as the systems developed by the
Dymecki lab (Dymecki and Kim, 2007). However, both approaches are still encumbered by the
irreversibility problem.
The only strategy so far that addresses both the off-target and irreversibility problems has been
developed by our labs (Madisen et al., 2015; Rosello-Diez et al., 2018). It involves combining the
Cre/loxP and Tet systems such that the Tigre locus is targeted with a double conditional allele in
which expression of the gene of interest (GOI) depends both on previous exposure to Cre (to prime
the system through elimination of a STOP sequence upstream of the GOI) and on (r)tTA activity
(through a TRE upstream of the floxed-STOP-GOI cassette). The first version of this system that
includes a tdTomato (tdT) coding sequence within the floxed cassette was called DRAGON (Fig.
1A), standing for Doxycycline-dependent and Recombinase-Activated Gene OverexpressioN
(Rosello-Diez et al., 2018). A Dragon-p21 line was generated and used to study the cellular
compensation mechanisms in the developing bones of the limbs when the cell cycle was blocked by
transient p21 expression (Rosello-Diez et al., 2018). Since the DRAGON approach is intersectional,
it is possible to achieve remarkable tissue-specificity (Fig. 1A), enabling the study of tissue-type
dependent effects of gene misexpression. In addition, due to its dependence on (r)tTA, the system is
inducible and reversible, allowing the effect of different times and durations of misexpression to be
tested. Finally, by using different modules with particular GOIs to achieve similar outcomes (e.g. to
reduce cell numbers by either blocking proliferation or inducing cell death), the system enables
studies of how the type of insult influences biological responses.

Here we describe a series of new Dragon lines we have created (Fig. 1B) and provide a proof-ofprinciple for the kind of uses that they enable. We also provide an in-depth characterization of
potential uses, including non-intersectional applications. We have focused most of our
manipulations on two organs in developing mice: the limbs (and the bones within them) and the
cerebellum. Growth of the long bones is driven by a cartilage template that is progressively
replaced by bone (Kronenberg, 2003; Rosello-Diez and Joyner, 2015). In order to target the cartilage
template, we used Col2a1-driven (r)tTA lines (Posey et al., 2009; Rosello-Diez et al., 2018). In order to
restrict expression to the limb cartilage, we used a Pitx2-Cre allele (Shiratori et al., 2006) that drives
Cre expression in the left lateral plate mesoderm (precursor of the left limb mesenchyme) at
embryonic day (E) 8.5, with the right limb cartilage serving as an internal control (expressing only
tdTomato). In the developing cerebellum, we targeted the cell lineage that generates the excitatory
neurons using Atoh1-Cre (Matei et al., 2005) and Atoh1-tTA (Willett et al., in revision) lines. We also
demonstrate that the approach can be applied in other in vivo systems using chicken embryos and
co-electroporating the components. Given the wealth of Cre and (r)tTA tools already available, the
constructs and mouse lines described here constitute a valuable resource for the scientific
community, which will enable a wide variety of biological processes to be probed with
unprecedented depth.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A Dragon-DTA model can be used to generate acute tissue-specific cell ablation.
A common theme in developmental and regenerative biology is that different responses are elicited
by cell ablation compared to defective cell proliferation. Therefore, to complement our Dragon-p21
line, we generated an intersectional Dragon-DTA model (see Methods) to enable cell ablation with
remarkable tissue specificity and temporal control, via expression of attenuated diphtheria toxin
fragment A. We then combined it with mice bearing Atoh1-tTA (Willett et al. 2019, in revision) and
Atoh1-Cre (Matei et al., 2005) to target the excitatory cerebellar nuclei (eCN), which house the
main output neurons of the cerebellum (eCN-DTA model). Since the precursors of the cerebellar
granule cells also express Atoh1, but starting only after E13.5 (Machold and Fishell, 2005) , we
provided Dox at E13.5 to shut down tTA activity in them, restricting DTA expression to the eCN.
As shown in Fig. 2A-D, this led to ectopic cell death (marked by TUNEL staining) specifically in
the Nuclear Transitory Zone (NTZ), where the precursors of the eCN migrate from the rhombic lip.
At P1, the number of eCN, revealed by MEIS2 immunostaining, was greatly reduced in eCN-DTA
cerebella as compared to the controls (Fig. 2E-G). By choosing between the available Cre and
(r)tTA lines, the Dragon-DTA strain will be a valuable resource to ablate cells with high
spatiotemporal precision.

Unilateral misexpression of Connective Tissue Growth Factor in the growing skeletal

We next searched for a versatile tool that could be used to transiently manipulate a variety of
biological processes, such as development, homeostasis and repair. We reasoned that a molecule
capable of interacting with several of the most commonly used signaling pathways would be an
ideal candidate. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) has been described to exert such a
pleiotropic effect (Takigawa, 2013). We thus generated a Dragon-Ctgf mouse model (see Methods)
and combined it with mice bearing Pitx2-Cre and Col2a1-tTA (Tet-Off) drivers to achieve unilateral

expression of CTGF in the cartilage of the left limbs (Pit-tTA-Ctgf model, Fig. 3A). By postnatal
day (P) 0-1, whereas the expression of Ctgf in the distal cartilage of the right Pit-tTA-Ctgf radius
was very similar to the expression in WT animals (Fig. 3B-C), the expression in the left Pit-tTACtgf element was more widespread (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, the ectopic expression of CTGF led to
reduced growth of the left bones as early as embryonic day (E) 17.5, including deformation of the
radius and ulna at postnatal stages (Fig. 3D). Given the strong effects we see, we expect the
Dragon-Ctgf mouse line to become a valuable tool to study diverse processes such as growth,
regeneration, fibrosis, etc.

A model for reversible Connective Tissue Growth Factor misexpression in the growing
skeletal elements reveals different outcomes of transient vs. permanent expression.
Besides its intersectional quality, a key aspect of the Dragon system is its reversibility. As a proofof-principle for testing this application, we repeated the Pit-tTA-Ctgf experiment and supplied Dox
to shut down tTA expression at E17.5 (Fig. 4A), when the phenotype is already obvious (Fig. 3D).
As expected, Ctgf ceased to be overexpressed in the cartilage by P0-P1 (Fig. 4B). Moreover, when

the extent of asymmetry was compared with either continuous expression or transient
overexpression, we found that the latter led to a much milder asymmetry than the former (Fig. 4C).
The transient expression experiment thus suggests that there is a catch-up mechanism that allows
limb growth to recover, and that would not have been discovered by irreversible misexpression,
highlighting the utility of the new mouse lines.

(coding region) in the proximal cartilage of left and right tibia of Pit-tTA-Ctgf P0 pups, 2 days after

the Pit-tTA-Ctgf model (Dox at E17.5, analysis at P0-P1), the asymmetry was not as extreme as in
the case of continuous Ctgf misexpression (no Dox condition, see schematics). In the graphs,
quantification of left/right ratio of bone length is shown for control (tTA–) and experimental
animals (tTA+), treated or no with Dox. Analysis by 2-way ANOVA for Genotype and Treatment,
p-values for Sidak’s multiple comparisons post-hoc test are shown. Since we used an internal ratio
(left/right length), data from femora and humeri were pooled together. They were treated as
independent samples because Pitx2-Cre has been shown to recombine with different efficiencies in
forelimb and hindlimb (Rosello-Diez et al., 2018).
The Dragon lines are effectively activated by (r)tTA and Cre, and not leaky.
We then performed in-depth characterization of the described lines, to make sure they were tightly
and efficiently regulated in a variety of scenarios. In previous studies we showed that TRE-driven
transgenes are highly expressed from the Tigre locus when insulator elements and a Woodchuck
virus RNA stabilizing sequence are included (Madisen et al., 2015; Rosello-Diez et al., 2018).
However, it has not been tested whether the Tigre-TRE driven GOIs are highly expressed in the

presence of other TREs that could compete for the transcriptional machinery and rtTA. This is
important because one possible non-intersectional application of our system is to combine it with an
(r)tTA and a TRE-driven Cre to achieve expression of both Cre and the GOI in a tissue during the
time (r)tTA is activated. To address this potential competition, we generated mice bearing a TRECre (Perl et al., 2002) and our Col2a1-tTA allele–which initiates expression in the cartilage at
around E12.5 (Rosello-Diez et al., 2018) and the Dragon-p21 allele (Col-TCre-p21 model, Fig.
5A,B). We analyzed the mice at postnatal day (P) 0 in the absence of Dox, such that the tTA was
active for at least a week before analysis. In Dragon-p21 mice that did not contain tTA nor TRECre, no tdTomato or p21 expression was detected in the target tissue (or other tissues), confirming
that there is no spontaneous firing of the Dragon allele (Fig. 5C left). In the presence of only tTA,
we mostly detected tdT+ cells in the cartilage (Fig. 5C middle), of which very few were p21+,
revealing there is negligible read-through activity past the STOP cassette (black dots in Fig. 5D).
Finally, when both TRE-Cre and tTA were present along with the Dragon-p21 allele, we observed a
full switch from Dragon TRE-driven tdT to p21 expression (Fig. 5C, D). Since no cells expressed
only tdT, this result indicates that the two TRE-driven alleles are both effectively induced.

To avoid the extra breeding steps required to introduce a third allele such as TRE-Cre in nonintersectional applications such as the one described above, we have also generated a germlinerecombined version of the Dragon-p21 allele (p21rec, Fig. 6A) that only requires (r)tTA activity to
express p21. To test this allele, we generated mice containing Col2a1-rtTA, p21rec and Pitx2-Cre
(the latter for control purposes). As expected, when we provided Dox at E12.5, since p21
expression does not require intersection with Cre activity, we observed p21 expression in the same
number of chondrocytes in the left and right limbs (Fig. 6B,C). Moreover, a higher percentage of
chondrocytes expressed p21 in the limbs (~80%, Fig. 6B,C) than in the left limb of the
intersectional approach (50-60% in Pitx2-Cre/+; Dragon-p21; Col2a1-rtTA mice, (Rosello-Diez et
al., 2018)). This new p21rec strain and similar derivatives of our DTA and Ctgf Dragon alleles will
be useful to interfere with cell functions in a variety of contexts, either by using existing tissuespecific (r)tTA mouse lines or Cre-dependent (r)tTAs driven by tissue-specific Cre.

(r)tTA only. A) Depiction of the recombined allele (p21rec) and how it works in the presence of

expression in left and right proximal tibial cartilage at E16.5, 4 days after Dox administration. C)

The use of CAG-rtTA3 in combination with Cre and Dragon lines allows for inducible and
reversible transgene expression using a tissue-specific Cre driver, but the level of expression is
tissue-dependent.

Given that there are more Cre than (r)tTA mouse lines available (>700 Cre vs. 44 (r)tTA lines in
JAX), a versatile way to use the Dragon mice to achieve conditional reversible induction is to
combine our Dragon lines with a Cre line that is as tissue-specific as possible and either a Credependent or a constitutively active rtTA allele. We tested this approach by combining the Pitx2Cre and Dragon-p21 alleles with an R26CAG-rtTA3 line that expresses rtTA constitutively (Dow et al.,
2014), and providing Dox at E12.5. The expectation was that p21 would be expressed in most of the
left limb mesenchyme, and tdTomato everywhere else (Fig. 7A). Surprisingly, however, at P0 the
expression levels of both transgenes were very low in the cartilage regions, yet quite high outside
the cartilage (Fig. 7B). Given that with another rtTA driver and the same Cre transgene we
previously obtained much higher expression in the cartilage (Rosello-Diez et al., 2018), we
conclude that the CAG-rtTA3 line is not highly expressed in the cartilage. Therefore, we looked at
other limb regions, like the interface between cartilage and bone, which is also derived from the
Pitx2-Cre lineage, and found that the expression levels were higher there, and the number of p21+
cells was more abundant in the left limb, as expected (Fig. 7C-D). Hence, while using Cre-activated
or constitutive CAG-rtTA3 in combination with a tissue-specific Cre and our Dragon alleles might
be an easy way of harnessing the wealth of Cre lines available into achieving transgene expression
with high spatio-temporal control, our results show that the efficiency of this approach depends
heavily on the expression levels of the transgene driving rtTA in the tissue(s) of interest. It remains
to be determined if other constitutive (r)tTA mouse lines have the same problem, but our own
experience and that of our colleagues suggest that the Rosa26 locus is particularly prone to
variegation (Jody Haigh, personal communication).

The Dragon targeting vectors can be used for in ovo electroporation.
Lastly, we tested the possibility of using the Dragon tools in animal models other than the mouse.
The chicken embryo has been a classical model for cell and developmental biology, immunology,
virology and cancer that is experiencing a revival since the introduction of modern genetic and
imaging tools (Kain et al., 2014; Rashidi and Sottile, 2009; Stern, 2005). In ovo electroporation
enables the introduction of exogenous genetic constructs in multiple locations of the embryo, in
order to perform gain- and loss-of-function studies, lineage tracing, live imaging, etc. (Morin et al.,
2017; Scaal et al., 2004). Therefore, we electroporated the right half of the neural tube of chicken
embryos at Hamilton-Hamburger (HH) stage 14-17 (Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992) with a mix of
pCAGGS-H2B-TagBFP (to visualize electroporated cells), pCAGGS-rtTA-IRES-Cre (to
constitutively express rtTA and Cre) and a targeting vector (Ai62) bearing a TRE-loxSTOPloxtdTomato cassette (Madisen et al., 2015). 24 h after electroporation, we observed robust and
consistent electroporation (blue signal, Fig. 8A) in the right neural tube of most surviving embryos,

as well as strong red signal in the electroporated area of Dox-treated embryos (Fig. 8A). Embryos
not treated with Dox did not show any red signal (Fig. 8B). Detailed examination on sections
revealed some cases in which all electroporated cells showed tdTomato signal (n=3 embryos out of
11), although it was frequent to observe some cells (~25% per section) with BFP signal but not
tdTomato (Fig. 8C, n=8 out of 11 embryos). Assuming all electroporated cells incorporated all
vectors, this suggests either that the CAGGS promoters in the two plasmids compete for the
transcriptional machinery (Christophe Marcelle, personal communication), and/or that the Cre is
expressed at suboptimal levels as a consequence of being placed downstream of the IRES sequence
(Mizuguchi et al., 2000). Regardless, our results indicate that the plasmids we have generated for
mouse ES cell targeting can be directly used for efficient in ovo electroporation, opening the door
for precise gene manipulation in other animal models. The use of tissue-specific rather than
ubiquitous promoters would make the system more versatile in the future. Another advantage of the
chicken model is the possibility of combining genetic manipulation with direct physical
manipulation. For example, one could co-electroporate vector(s) containing rtTA and the Dragon
construct, induce recombination of the construct in a restricted region of the embryo by placement
of beads soaked with cell-permeable Cre (Gitton et al., 2009) and administration of Dox to activate
the gene of interest only in the primed region. The possibilities are only limited by the skill and
imagination of the operator.

mouse lines available, we anticipate that this system will be useful to many researchers across
different fields. One potential limitation of these tools is that whereas the constructs also work very
well for transfection in vitro using HEK cells (not shown), they are probably not suitable for viral
transduction, as they tend to be quite big (>10 kb) due to the inclusions of insulators and RNAstabilizing sequences. All the mouse lines and constructs described here will be submitted to
repositories to make them available for the scientific community.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Generation and maintenance of mouse lines
The generation of the Igs7TRE-LtSL-p21 (Dragon-p21) mouse line was as described (Rosello-Diez et
al., 2018). To generate the Igs7TRE -p21 mouse line (p21rec), Dragon-p21 males were crossed with
germline Cre-expressing females to delete the floxed cassette. The Cre allele was subsequently
eliminated during the breeding to generate p21rec homozygous animals.
To generate the Igs7TRE-LtSL-Ctgf mouse line, the NruI-STOP-loxP-tdTomato-SnaBI fragment in the
Ai62(TITL-tdT) Flp-in replacement vector (Madisen et al., 2015) was replaced by a custom NruItdTomato-STOP-loxP-MluI-HpaI-SnaBI cassette, to generate an empty DRAGON vector. A PCRamplified Kozak-Ctgf cassette was subsequently cloned into the MluI and SnaBI sites to generate
the DRAGON-Ctgf vector. This vector was then used for recombinase-mediated cassette exchange
into Igs7-targeted G4 ES cells (Madisen et al., 2015). Two successfully targeted clones (#1 and #2)
were injected into C2J blastocysts to generate chimeras, obtaining 11 chimeric males that survived

(out of 30 animals born) with 25-85% chimaerism. One male from clone #1 and three males from
clone #2 were crossed to Swiss Webster mice (Charles River) to assess germline transmission. Only
clone #2 was successfully transmitted and used to establish the new mouse line.
A similar process was used to generate the Igs7TRE-LtSL-DTA mouse line, with the only difference
being that an attenuated version of DTA (tox176) was used to PCR-amplify the Kozak-DTA
cassette. Two successfully targeted clones (#8 and #13) were injected into C2J blastocysts to
generate chimeras, obtaining 34 chimeric males that survived (out of 52 animals born) with 35100% chimaerism. Four males from clone #8 and two from clone #13 were used to assess germline
transmission and establish the new mouse line.
All mouse lines were maintained on an outbred Swiss Webster background. The DNA primers and
programs used for genotyping each allele and transgene are shown in Table 1:

Animal experiments
All mouse work was carried out according to institutional guidelines after obtaining their approval
(Sloan Kettering Institute IACUC and Monash University Animal Ethics Committee). For timemated crosses, vaginal plugs were checked in the mornings, and noon of the day the plug was
detected was considered E0.5. When Dox was needed, it was added to the drinking water. To
activate Col2a1-rtTA, the final concentration was 1 mg/ml, including 1% sucrose to increase
palatability. To inactivate Col2a1-tTA and Atoh1-tTA, the final concentration of Dox was 0.02
mg/ml.
Upon reception, chicken eggs were kept at 18ºC for up to 2 weeks. Two and half days prior to the
experiment, they were transferred to a watered incubator at 37ºC with forced ventilation.
In ovo electroporation
In ovo electroporation was performed as described (Blank et al., 2007). Briefly, on the day of the
experiment, eggs were laid out horizontally; 3 ml of albumin were removed from the blunt end of
each egg, and a window was opened on top with blunt forceps. A few drops of Ringer’s solution
containing Penicillin-Streptomycin (Gibco 15140122, diluted 1/50) were pipetted on top, and the
membranes removed with a hooked needle. Indian ink (drawing ink A, Pelikan #201665, diluted
1/100 in Ringer’s solution) was injected under the vitelline membranes to provide contrast. A pulled
glass capillary (Harvard apparatus GC120T-10) and a mouth pipette were used to inject into the
caudal neural tube the electroporation mix (1 µg/µl each plasmid in injection solution: high

viscosity carboxymethylcellulose 0.33% (Sigma); Fast Green 1% (Sigma); MgCl2 1 mM in PBS).
Custom-made electrodes (using 0.5-mm wide platinum wire for the positive electrode and a
tungsten wire for the negative one) were placed flanking the embryo, and a pulse generator (Intracel
TSS20 with current amplifier) used to deliver 3 square pulses (27 V, 30 ms ON, 100 ms OFF).
After electroporation, 200 µl of Doxycycline solution (5 ng/µl in Ringer’s) were micropipetted
underneath the embryo. Eggs were then sealed with tape and incubated for 24h.
METHOD DETAILS
Cloning of pCAGGS-rtTA-IRES-Cre
The vector for constitutive expression of rtTA and Cre was built via Gibson cloning using Addgene
#20910 (digested SmaI-PacI) as backbone, and the following fragments: an IRES sequence
amplified from Addgene #102423 using primers
CTTGACATGCTCCCCGGGTAACCCCTCTCCCTCCCCCCC and
GCTCCATTCATTTATCATCGTGTTTTTCAAAGGAAAACCACG, and a Cre sequence
amplified from genomic DNA of a Cre+ mouse with primers
AAACACGATGATAAATGTCCAATTTACTGACCG and
ATGCTCTCGTTAATCTAATCGCCATCTTCCAG. The molecular assembly was done with the
NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly cloning kit following manufacturer instructions.
Sample collection and processing
Mouse limbs: Upon embryo or pup collection, the limbs were dissected out in cold PBS, skinned
and fixed in 4% PFA for 2 days. No decalcification was done for samples P1 or younger. After PBS
washes, the limbs were cryoprotected in PBS with 15% sucrose and then equilibrated at 37ºC in
PBS with 15% sucrose and 7.5% porcine skin gelatin (Sigma) until they sank. The limbs were
oriented inside the wells of multi-welled plates and cooled down until solid, to then flash-freeze
them using a dry-ice cold bath of isopentane (Merck). The cryoblocks were sectioned at 7 µm on a
cryostat (Leica, CM3050S) onto Superfrost slides.
Mouse brains: The brains of all embryonic stages were dissected in cold PBS and immersion fixed
in 4% PFA for 24 hours at 4°C. All postnatal stages were transcardially perfused with PBS followed
by 4% PFA, and brains were post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight. Specimens for cryosectioning were
placed in 30% sucrose/PBS until they sank, embedded in OCT using cryomoulds (Tissue-Tek),
frozen in dry ice cooled isopentane, and sectioned at 14 µm on a cryostat (Leica, CM3050S) onto
Superfrost slides.
Chicken embryos: the embryos were scooped out of the egg and dissected in cold PBS. The

electroporated section of the trunk was isolated under the fluorescence scope and then fixed in 4%
PFA overnight. After PBS washes, specimens were cryoprotected in 15% sucrose and then 30%
sucrose in PBS, until they sank. They were then embedded in OCT using cryomoulds (Tissue-Tek),
frozen in dry ice cooled isopentane, and sectioned at 7 µm on a cryostat (Leica, CM3050S) onto
Superfrost slides.
Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL staining
Mouse brains: Sections were incubator in PBS for 10 min and then blocked with blocking buffer
(5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA, Sigma) in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100). Primary antibodies
(MEIS2, 1:3000) in blocking buffer were placed on slides overnight at 4°C, washed in PBS with
0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST) and applied with secondary antibodies (1:500 Alexa Fluor-conjugated
secondary antibodies in blocking buffer) for 1 hour at room temperature. Counterstaining was
performed using Hoechst 33258 (Invitrogen). The slides were then washed in PBST, then mounted
with a coverslip and Fluorogel mounting medium (Electron Microscopy Sciences). TUNEL staining
was performed prior to secondary antibody incubation using the Biotin-based in situ cell death
detection kit (Roche) and following the manufacturer instructions, including an Avidin-Biotin
blocking step (Vector Laboratories).
In situ hybridization
The DIG-labeled RNA probe for Ctgf was prepared by in vitro transcription of a PCR-amplified
template from embryonic day 12.5 cDNA, using the following primers: Fwd: 5’CAGCTGGGAGAACTGTGTAC-3’, Rev(T7): 5’CGATGTTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGCTCGCATCATAGTTGGGTC-3’.
Hybridization procedure: the slides were warmed in RNAse-free PBS for 20 min at 37°C, then
washed again for 5 min at RT and fixed in 4% PFA solution for 20 min followed by two PBS
washes. To increase permeabilization, the slides were placed in PBS with 10 µg/ml protein kinase
for 10 min at 37ºC and then washed in normal PBS. Sections were fixed in 4% PFA solution for 5
min, rinsed in PBS and set down in the TEA buffer for 10 min at RT. Hybridization: After rinsing
in PBS and water, slides received 600 µl of pre-warmed hybridization buffer and were placed at
65ºC in a humified slide box with formamide 50%, for 90 min. The RNA-probes were then diluted
in the hybridization buffer (1µg/ml), denatured at 80º C for 15 min, stabilized on ice for 5 min and
placed at 65ºC during prehybridization. Sections received 250 µl diluted probe and were kept at 65º
C overnight. Post-hybridization treatment: Once the probes were removed, the slides were placed in
post-hybridization buffer I at 65º C for 20 min and this step was repeated with Post-hybridization
buffer II. At the end of hybridization, the slides were kept at RT for 5 min, washed with MABT

(0.1 M Maleic acid, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween20, pH 7.5) and blocked for 90 min at RT in a
humidified slide box with MABT containing 1% blocking reagent (Roche # 11096176001) and
10% goat serum. An AP-conjugated anti-DIG antibody (Sigma, 1:4000 in MABT with 1% blocking
reagent and 2% goat serum) was added for 2h at RT. After multiple washes with MABT the
sections were washed with AP buffer (0.1M Tris-HCl pH 9.5, 0.1M NaCl, 0.05 M MgCl2, 0.1%
Tween20, Levamisole 2mM [Sigma]) 2x5 min each. Staining was developed with BM purple
(Roche #11442074001) at 37ºC. After several PBS washes, fixation in 4% PFA and then water
wash, sections were counterstained in 0.01% Nuclear Fast Red for 10 min at RT followed by
dehydration, clearing in xylene and mounting.

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Image Analysis and Quantification
The regions of interest were isolated from imaged sections of the multiple models. All the
parameters including the brightness, contrast, filters, layers were kept the same for all the images in
the same study. Cells positive for the signal of interest were counted manually using ImageJ, after
acquisition on an Imager Z1 microscope (Zeiss).
Statistical Analysis
The comparisons were done by an unpaired Mann-Whitney test (1 variable and 2 conditions), or by
2-way ANOVA (2 variables and 2 or more conditions) following a matched (paired) design when
possible (indicated when not). When left and right measurements were compared within
experimental animals only, ratio-paired t-test was used. All the statistical analyses were done using
Prism7 software (Graphpad).
