Abstract

20

Bacterial type IV secretion systems (T4SS) are a highly diversified but evolutionarily

21

related family of macromolecule transporters that can secrete proteins and DNA into the

22

extracellular medium or into target cells. They have been long known to play a fundamental role

23

in bacterial conjugation and virulence of several species. It was recently shown that a subtype of

24

T4SS harboured by the plant pathogenic bacterium Xanthomonas citri transfers toxins into other

25

bacteria cells resulting in cell death. In this study, we show that a similar T4SS from the multi-

26

drug-resistant global opportunistic pathogen Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is proficient in killing

27

competitor bacterial species. T4SS-dependent duelling between S. maltophilia and X. citri was

28

observed by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. A bioinformatic search of the S. maltophilia

29

K279a genome for proteins containing a C-terminal domain (XVIPCD) conserved in X. citri T4SS

30

effectors identified eleven putative effectors secreted by the S. maltophilia T4SS. Six of these

31

effectors have no recognizable domain except for the XVIPCD. We selected one of these new

32

effectors (Smlt3024) and its cognate inhibitor (Smlt3025) for further characterization and

33

confirmed that Smlt3024 is indeed secreted in a T4SS-dependent manner by S. maltophilia when

34

in contact with a target bacterial species. Expression of Smlt3024 in the periplasm of E. coli

35

resulted in greatly reduced growth rate and cell size, which could be counteracted by co-expression

36

with its cognate periplasmic inhibitor, Smlt3025. This work expands our current knowledge about

37

the diverse function of T4SSs subtypes and increases the panel of effectors known to be involved

38

in T4SS-mediated interbacterial competition. Further elucidation of the mechanism of these

39

antibacterial proteins could lead to the discovery of new antibacterial targets. The study also adds

40

information about the molecular mechanisms possibly contributing to the establishment of S.

41

maltophilia in different biotic and abiotic surfaces in both clinical and environmental settings.

Author Summary

44

Competition between microorganisms for nutrients and space determines which species

45

will emerge and dominate or be eradicated from a specific habitat. Bacteria use a series of

46

mechanisms to kill or prevent multiplication of competitor species. Recently, it was reported that

47

a subtype of type IV secretion system (T4SS) works as a weapon to kill competitor bacterial

48

species. In this study, we show that an important human opportunistic pathogen,

49

Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, harbours a T4SS that promotes killing of competitor species. We

50

also identified a series of new toxic proteins secreted by S. maltophilia via its T4SS to poison

51

competitor species. We showed that two different bacterial species that harbour a bacteria-killing

52

T4SS can kill each other; most likely due to differences in effector-immunity protein pairs. This

53

work expands our current knowledge about the bacterial arsenal used in competitions with other

54

species and expands the repertoire of antibacterial ammunition fired by T4SSs. In addition, the

55

work contributes with knowledge on the possible mechanisms used by S. maltophilia to establish

56

communities in different biotic and abiotic surfaces in both clinical and environmental settings.

Introduction

59

The ecological interactions between bacterial species range from cooperative to

60

competitive and can be mediated by diffusible soluble factors secreted into the extracellular

61

medium or by factors transferred directly into target cells in a contact-dependent manner [1].

62

Several types of contact-dependent antagonistic interactions between bacteria have been described.

63

Contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) is mediated by the CdiA/CdiB family of two-partner

64

secretion proteins composed of the CdiB outer membrane protein that is required for secretion of

65

CdiA, which contains a C-terminal toxin domain [2, 3]. The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a

66

dynamic contractile organelle evolutionarily related to bacteriophage tails that is attached to the

67

cell envelope, enabling the injection of proteinaceous effectors into target prokaryotic or

68

eukaryotic cells [4, 5]. More recently, contact-dependent antagonism was reported to be mediated

69

via a specialized type IV secretion system (T4SS) that transports toxic effectors into target

70

prokaryotic cell [6].

71

T4SSs are a highly diverse superfamily of secretion systems found in many species of

72

Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. These systems mediate a wide range of events from

73

transfer of DNA during bacterial conjugation to transfer of effector proteins into infected

74

eukaryotic host cells [7] and into competitor bacteria [6]. T4SSs have been classified based on

75

their physiological functions as (i) conjugation systems, (ii) effector translocators, or (iii) contact-

76

independent DNA/protein exchange systems [8]. Another common classification scheme divides

77

T4SSs into two phylogenetic families called types A and B [9, 10]; while more finely

78

discriminating phylogenetic analyses based on two highly conserved T4SS ATPases (VirB4 and

79

VirD4) identified eight distinct clades [11, 12].

80

The model type A VirB/D4 T4SS from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which is used to

81

transfer tumour-inducing effectors into some plants species [13], is composed of a core set of 12

82

proteins designated VirB1-VirB11 and VirD4. Electron microscopy studies on homologous

83

systems from the conjugative plasmids R388 and pKM101 have revealed an architecture that can

84

be divided into two large subcomplexes: i) a periplasmatic core complex made up of 14 repeats of

85

VirB7, VirB9 and VirB10 subunits that forms a pore in the outer membrane and which is also

86

linked, via VirB10, to the inner membrane and ii) an inner membrane complex composed of VirB3,

87

VirB6 and VirB8 and three ATPases (VirB4, VirB11 and VirD4) that energize the system during

88

pilus formation and substrate transfer. Finally, VirB2 and VirB5 form the extracellular pilus and

89

VirB1 is a periplasmic transglycosidase [14-16]. The X. citri T4SS involved in bacterial killing

90

shares many features with the type A T4SSs from A. tumefaciens and the conjugative T4SSs

91

pKM101 and R388, with one distinctive feature being an uncharacteristically large VirB7

92

lipoprotein subunit [17] whose C-terminal N0 domain decorates the periphery of the outer

93

membrane layer of the core complex [18].

94

VirD4 and its orthologs play a key role by recognizing substrates on the cytoplasmic face

95

of the inner membrane and directing them for secretion through the T4SS channel [9, 19-21]. A

96

yeast two-hybrid screen using X. citri VirD4 as bait identified several prey proteins (initially

97

termed XVIPs for Xanthomonas VirD4 interacting proteins) containing a conserved C-terminal

98

domain named XVIPCD (XVIP conserved domain) [22]. These proteins were later shown to be

99

toxic antibacterial effectors secreted via the X. citri T4SS into target cells, often carrying N-

100

terminal domains with enzymatic activities predicted to target structures in the cell envelope,

101

including peptidoglycan-targeting glycohydrolases and proteases, phospholipases, as well as

102

nucleases [6]. Furthermore, each T4SS effector is co-expressed with a cognate immunity protein,

103

which functions to prevent self-intoxication [6], a feature also observed for toxin-antitoxin pairs

104

associated with T6SSs [23]. Bioinformatic analysis identified potential XVIPCD-containing

105

proteins in many other bacterial species of the Xanthomonadaceae family, including

106

Stenotrophomonas spp., Lysobacter spp., Luteimonas spp., and species of the closely related

107

Rodanobacteraceae family, including Luteibacter spp. and Dyella spp. Therefore, these effectors

108

and their cognate immunity proteins were generally designated X-Tfes and X-Tfis

109

(Xanthomonadaceae T4SS effectors and immunity proteins, respectively) [6].

110

Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an emerging multi-drug-resistant global opportunistic

111

pathogen. S. maltophilia strains are frequently isolated from water, soil and in association with

112

plants [24], but in the last decades an increased number of hospital-acquired infections, particularly

113

of immunocompromised patients, has called attention to this opportunistic pathogen [25, 26].

114

Infections associated with virulent strains of S. maltophilia are very diverse, ranging from

115

respiratory and urinary tract infections to bacteremia and infections associated with intravenous

116

cannulas and prosthetic devices [25]. The ability of Stenotrophomonas spp. to form biofilms on

117

different biotic and abiotic surfaces [27, 28] and its capacity to secrete several hydrolytic enzymes

118

(proteases, lipases, esterases) that promote cytotoxicity contribute to pathogenesis [29, 30]. In

119

addition, S. maltophilia is naturally competent to acquire foreign DNA, which probably contributes

120

to the multi-drug-resistant phenotype of several strains [24, 31].

121

S. maltophilia strain K279a contains a cluster of genes on its chromosome encoding for a

122

T4SS homologous to the T4SS of the plant pathogen Xanthomonas citri involved in interbacterial

123

antagonism [6], and their cytoplasmic ATPases VirD4 share 79% amino acid identity (Figure 1A).

124

In this study, we show that S. maltophilia K279a is proficient in inducing Escherichia coli death

125

in a T4SS-dependent manner. Interestingly, S. maltophilia and X. citri can duel using their T4SSs

and kill each other. We identified eleven putative new effectors (X-Tfes) encoded by the S.

127

maltophilia T4SS genome. Further characterization of one of the effectors (Smlt3024)

128

demonstrated that it is secreted by Stenotrophomonas K279a in a T4SS-dependent manner upon

129

contact with E. coli. Additionally, the heterologous expression of Smlt3024 in the periplasm of E.

130

coli had a deleterious effect on its growth and altered cell size, which could be neutralized by co-

131

expression of the respective cognate immunity protein, Smlt3025. This work expands our current

132

knowledge about the subtypes of T4SSs that are involved in interbacterial competition and about

133

the molecular mechanisms contributing to S. maltophilia establishment in hospital and

134

environmental settings that may contribute to its behavior as an opportunistic pathogen.

Stenotrophomonas maltophilia VirB/T4SS induces target bacteria cell death

138

The genome of S. maltophilia K279a [32] harbours two clusters of genes encoding distinct

139

T4SSs: smlt1283-smlt1293 (annotated as trb) and smlt2997-smlt3008 (annotated as virB) [33].

140

Comparative sequence analysis showed that the S. maltophilia virB1-11 and virD4 genes are most

141

closely related with their counterparts in X. citri involved in bacterial killing (37% - 82% identity

142

at the amino acid level), with the three ATPases that energize the system presenting the greatest

143

levels of identity: VirB4 (81%), VirB11 (82%) and VirD4 (79%) (Fig. 1A). Phylogenetic analysis

144

based on the amino acid sequences of S. maltophilia VirD4/Smlt3008 grouped the S. maltophilia

145

VirB/T4SS together with the X. citri VirB/T4SS involved in bacterial killing, while

146

Stenotrophomonas Trb/T4SS belongs to another group of T4SSs (S1 Fig). The second T4SS from

147

X. citri (encoded by plasmid pXAC64), which was proposed to be involved in conjugation due to

148

neighbouring relaxosome genes and oriT site, is located in another branch in the phylogenetic tree,

149

distinctly from the above two systems (S1 Fig) [22].

150

To investigate the involvement of the S. maltophilia VirB/T4SS in bacterial antagonism,

151

we created a mutant strain lacking the ATPase coupling protein VirD4 (ΔvirD4) and analysed its

152

ability to restrict growth of other species such as E. coli. Different dilutions of an E. coli culture

153

were mixed with a fixed number of S. maltophilia cells and the co-cultures were spotted onto LB-

154

agar plates containing the chromogenic substrate X-gal and incubated for 24 h at 30˚C (Fig 1B).

155

As only E. coli cells naturally express β-galactosidase, they turn blue while S. maltophilia cells are

156

yellow. Growth of E. coli was inhibited by S. maltophilia wild-type, but not by the ΔvirD4 strain

157

(Fig 1B). The phenotype of S. maltophilia ΔvirD4 could be restored by complementing the strain

158

with a plasmid encoding VirD4 (smlt3008) under the control of the PBAD promoter (ΔvirD4

159

virD4Csmlt) (Fig 1B). This plasmid promotes low expression levels under non-inducing conditions

160

(no L-arabinose) in Stenotrophomonas and is usually sufficient for complementation.

161

Interestingly, transformation of S. maltophilia ΔvirD4 strain with a plasmid encoding VirD4 from

162

X. citri (xac2623) (ΔvirD4 virD4Cxac) also restored the phenotype, indicating that these proteins

163

are functionally redundant (Fig 1B).

164

To analyse bacterial antagonism at shorter time-points, we measured E. coli cell lysis after

165

mixing with different S. maltophilia strains (wild-type, ΔvirD4, ΔvirD4 virD4Csmlt and ΔvirD4

166

virD4Cxac). The cultures were mixed and immediately spotted onto 96 well plates containing LB-

167

agar with CPRG, which is a cell-impermeable chromogenic substrate hydrolysed by β-

168

galactosidase released from lysed E. coli, thus producing chlorophenol red with an absorbance

169

maximum at 572 nm. Fig 1C shows that S. maltophilia wild-type and complemented strains

170

(ΔvirD4 virD4Csmlt and ΔvirD4 virD4Cxac) induce lysis of E. coli shortly after co-incubation

171

(around 10 min). Based on the slope of the curves, the data suggests that all three S. maltophilia

172

strains induce E. coli cell lysis with very similar efficiencies (Fig 1C).

173

Live-cell imaging of S. maltophilia wild-type co-incubated with E. coli-RFP expressing

174

red fluorescent protein (RFP) shows that Stenotrophomonas induces E. coli cell lysis in a contact-

175

dependent manner (Fig 1D and Movie S1). No cell lysis was detected when E. coli was co-

176

incubated with S. maltophilia ΔvirD4 (Fig 1D and Movie S2). Quantification of E. coli cell lysis

177

over a time-frame of 100 min shows that around 50% of E. coli cells in contact with

178

Stenotrophomonas wild-type were observed to lyse during this period, while no cell lysis was

179

detected when E. coli was mixed with S. maltophilia ΔvirD4 (Fig 1E). It is important to note that

180

this quantification does not measure (most likely sub-estimates) the efficiency of killing as some

181

E. coli cells may be intoxicated without cellular lysis and the time of target-cell lysis may vary

182

after the initial physical contact.

183

As X. citri is the only other bacterial species described to date experimentally shown to use

184

a T4SS for interbacterial killing, we decided to analyse whether S. maltophilia and X. citri could

185

use their T4SS to compete with and kill each other. First, we co-incubated S. maltophilia (either

186

wild-type or ΔvirD4) with a X. citri T4SS mutant strain lacking all the chromosomal virB genes

187

and expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of virB7 endogenous promoter

188

(ΔvirB-GFP) (Cenens et al., manuscript in preparation) and confirmed that S. maltophilia can

189

induce lysis of X. citri ΔvirB-GFP in a T4SS-dependent manner (Figs 2A and 2C; Movie S3 and

190

S4). Next, we co-incubated X. citri-GFP (functional T4SS) with S. maltophilia wild-type or

191

ΔvirD4 strains. Besides showing that X. citri can induce lysis of S. maltophilia ΔvirD4 (Movie

192

S5), we observed that when both wild-type species are mixed, they duel and kill each other in a

193

T4SS-dependent manner (Figs 2B and 2D; Movie S6). S. maltophilia seems to be slightly more

194

effective in killing X. citri via its T4SS, which could be due to the efficiency of the T4SS and/or

195

the shorter doubling-time of S. maltophilia compared to X. citri.

196
197

Identification of eleven putative effectors secreted via the S. maltophilia VirB/T4SS

198

After confirming that the S. maltophilia VirB/T4SS is functional and induces target cell

199

death, we decided to search for effector proteins translocated by this system. As the VirD4

200

coupling protein of X. citri complements the ΔvirD4 strain of S. maltophilia (Figs 1B and 1C), we

201

hypothesized that potential substrates secreted via the T4SS of S. maltophilia could be identified

202

by applying a bioinformatic approach using the C-terminal domains of X. citri X-Tfes (XVIPCDs)

203

to search the genome of S. maltophilia K279a. Using this approach, we identified eleven S.

204

maltophilia proteins as potential T4SS substrates (Fig 3A, S1 Table). All these putative X-Tfes

205

were identified using searches with the XVIPCDs from at least seven different X. citri X-Tfes (S1

206

Table). Amino acid sequence alignment of C-terminal XVIPCDs from Stenotrophomonas X-Tfes

207

revealed a series of conserved amino acid motifs that are also present in X. citri X-Tfes [22] (Fig

208

3B).

209

All identified S. maltophilia effectors are organized in small operons together with an

210

upstream gene encoding a conserved hypothetical protein, reminiscent of the organization of

211

effectors with their immunity proteins [6, 34]. Five of the identified S. maltophilia T4SS substrates

212

harbour domains already described in other bacterial toxins such as lipases, nucleases, lysozyme-

213

like hydrolases and proteins with peptidoglycan binding domains (Fig 3A). Three of these effectors

214

(smlt2990, smlt2992 and smlt3024) are encoded by genes very close to the S. maltophilia virB

215

locus (genes smlt2997 to smlt3008), further illustrating the link of these effectors with the T4SS.

216

It is interesting to note that six of the identified putative Stenotrophomonas T4SS effectors do not

217

display any known protein domain that could indicate the mechanism mediating the antibacterial

218

toxicity (smlt0113, smlt0332, smlt0500, smlt0502, smlt0505, smlt3024) (Fig 3). To validate our

219

findings and obtain further insight regarding the function of the effectors with domains of unknown

220

function, we selected the products of the smlt3024 gene and its upstream, putatively co-transcribed,

221

partner (smlt3025) for further characterization.

222
223
224

Smlt3024 is a periplasmic-acting toxin that impairs cell growth and is inhibited by
periplasmic Smlt3025

225

BLASTp searches for Smlt3024 homologues (excluding the C-terminal XVIPCD)

226

retrieved sequences from Stenotrophomonas spp., Xanthomonas spp., and Lysobacter spp.

227

annotated either as hemolysin/hemolysin-related or as hypothetical proteins (S1B Table).

228

However, none of these proteins contain a domain similar to any annotated domain in the Pfam

229

database [35]. In its genomic context, smlt3024 seems to be organized in an operon downstream

230

to two genes encoding for its putative cognate immunity protein (smlt3025) and another small

231

protein containing a helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain annotated as a putative transcriptional

232

regulator (smlt3026) (Fig 4A).

233

To determine whether Smlt3024 is indeed an effector secreted via the S. maltophilia T4SS,

234

we cloned an N-terminal FLAG-tagged version of smlt3024 (FLAG-Smlt3024) into the pBRA

235

plasmid under the control of the PBAD promoter and used it to transform both S. maltophilia wild-

236

type and ΔvirD4 strains. These strains were co-incubated with E. coli and spotted onto

237

nitrocellulose membranes placed over LB-agar plates containing 0.1% L-arabinose and incubated

238

for 6 h at 30˚C. The membranes were later processed for immunodetection with an anti-FLAG

239

antibody. Results show an increase in signal intensity for FLAG-Smlt3024 when S. maltophilia

240

was co-incubated with E. coli (Figs 4B and 4C), while no increase was detected when S.

241

maltophilia ΔvirD4 was co-incubated with E. coli (Figs 4B and 4C). In addition, no increase in

242

signal intensity could be detected when S. maltophilia FLAG-Smlt3024 was incubated without

243

target E. coli cells (Fig 4B). SDS-PAGE of total protein extracts followed by western blot with

244

anti-FLAG antibody showed that both S. maltophilia wild-type and ΔvirD4 strains were expressing

245

similar levels of FLAG-Smlt3024 (S2 Fig). These results show that secretion of Smlt3024 is

246

dependent on contact with a target cell and on a functional T4SS.

247

To assess whether Smlt3025 is the cognate immunity protein of Smlt3024, we analysed

248

whether these proteins could interact by expressing and purifying full-length Smlt3024 and a

249

soluble version of Smlt3025 (amino acid residues 86-333), lacking its N-terminal signal peptide.

250

Complex formation was analysed using size exclusion chromatography coupled to multiple-angle

251

light scattering (SEC-MALS) (Fig 4E). The MALS analysis calculated average masses for

252

Smlt3024 and Smlt302586-333 of 52.3 kDa and 27.5 kDa, respectively, which are very close to the

253

theoretical values of their monomer molecular masses of 49 kDa and 28 kDa, respectively (Fig.

254

4E). When a mixture of these proteins was analysed by SEC-MALS followed by SDS-PAGE, a

255

new peak appeared containing both Smlt3024 and Smlt302586-333 with an average molecular mass

256

calculated by MALS of 74.2 kDa, suggesting that a stable 1:1 complex (theoretical mass of 77

257

kDa) was formed between Smlt3024 and Smlt302586-333 (Fig 4E).

258

If Smlt3024 is indeed a toxic effector secreted by the S. maltophilia T4SS, then we would

259

expect that its expression in the appropriate compartment within E. coli would create an

260

impairment of bacterial growth. To evaluate the toxicity of Smlt3024 upon expression in E. coli

261

and to establish in which cellular compartment Smlt3024 exerts its effect, we cloned the full-length

262

protein into pBRA placing it under control of the PBAD promoter (inducible by L-arabinose and

263

repressed by D-glucose) both with and without an N-terminal pelB periplasmic localization signal

264

sequence. We also cloned the sequence of the Smlt3025 immunity protein into the pEXT22 vector

265

placing it under the control of PTAC promoter, which can be induced by IPTG. We noted that the

266

annotated sequence for Smlt3025 has a non-canonical GTG start codon with 4 possible in frame

267

ATG start codons at positions 13, 45, 47 and 50 and that initiation at positions 45, 47 or 50 would

268

produce proteins with an N-terminal signal sequence for periplasmic localization (Fig. 4D) [36].

269

Therefore, three versions of Smlt3025, beginning at positions 1, 13 and 45 were cloned into

270

pEXT22, leading to the production of Smlt30251-333, Smlt302513-333 and Smlt302545-333. E. coli

271

strains carrying the different combinations of pBRA-Smlt3024 and each one of the pEXT22-

272

Smlt3025 plasmids were serial diluted and incubated on LB-agar plates containing either D-

273

glucose, L-arabinose or L-arabinose plus IPTG (D-glucose inhibits and L-arabinose induces

274

expression of Smlt3024; IPTG induces expression of Smlt3025). Results showed that Smlt3024 is

275

toxic only when directed to the periplasm of E. coli cells (pBRA-pelB-smlt3024) but not in the

276

cytoplasm (pBRA-smlt3024), and that only Smlt302545-333 which is directed to the periplasm,

277

could neutralize Smlt3024 toxicity (Fig. 4F).

278

To gather further insight on the mechanism by which Smlt3024 could induce toxicity, we

279

decided to perform time-lapse microscopy to evaluate growth and morphology of individual E.

280

coli cells carrying the empty pBRA or pBRA-pelB-smlt3024 plasmids. E. coli carrying the empty

281

plasmid incubated on LB-agar with 0.2% L-arabinose (Fig 4G and Movie S7) as well as the

282

repressed pBRA-pelB-smlt3024 (0.2% D-glucose) grew normally (Fig 4G and Movie S8). Upon

283

induction with L-arabinose, cells carrying pBRA-pelB-smlt3024 quickly experienced a strong

284

reduction in growth rate and single cells were smaller (average length of 2.1 ± 0.7 µm after 300

285

min) compared to the controls incubated in glucose (average length of 3.6 ± 1.2 µm after 300 min)

Smlt3024 seem to remain viable and continue growing and dividing for up to 8 h (Movie S9).

Discussion

290

Competition between microorganisms for nutrients and space often determines which

291

species will thrive and dominate or be eradicated from a specific habitat. The recently identified

292

T4SS involved in bacterial killing has revealed another weapon in the bacterial warfare arsenal

293

[6]. In this manuscript, we show that the T4SS of S. maltophilia is involved in interbacterial

294

competition, allowing it to induce lysis of E. coli and X. citri and possibly many other Gram-

295

negative species. The S. maltophilia VirB/T4SS is the second example described to date of a T4SS

296

subtype involved in bacterial killing and it is the first example of a human opportunistic pathogen

297

shown to mediate bacterial killing via a T4SS.

298

S. maltophilia is often found as a member of microbial communities in water, soil and in

299

association with plants. Some Stenotrophomonas species like S. maltophilia and S. rhizophila can

300

participate in beneficial interactions with plants, but no species were reported to be

301

phytopathogenic, which distinguishes Stenotrophomonas from the phylogenetically related genera

302

Xanthomonas and Xylella [24]. More importantly, an increasing number of hospital-acquired S.

303

maltophilia infections over the last decades has led to the classification of this bacterium as an

304

emerging opportunistic pathogen [25, 26]. Key to the opportunistic behaviour of S. maltophilia

305

strains are their ability to form biofilms and their resistance to multiple antibiotics. In this context,

306

the antibacterial property of its T4SS probably provides a competitive advantage to S. maltophilia

307

in polymicrobial communities, contributing to increased fitness.

308

The most worrying aspect of pathogenic S. maltophilia strains is their multi-drug resistance

309

phenotype [37]. As S. maltophilia is naturally competent to acquire foreign DNA (Berg et al.,

310

1999, Ryan et al., 2009), it would be interesting to analyse the contribution of the T4SS described

311

here in promoting Stenotrophomonas transformation and the acquisition of antibiotic resistance

312

genes. Such a mechanism has already been reported in Vibrio cholerae, which uses a T6SS as a

313

predatory killing device to induce target cell lysis concomitantly with target-cell DNA uptake to

314

promote bacterial transformation [38].

315

The T6SS has been shown to play important roles during colonization and infection by

316

enteric pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella and Shigella [39, 40]. The contribution of S.

317

maltophilia T4SS to colonization and maintenance within mammalian hosts is still unknown. As

318

S. maltophilia is frequently associated with cystic fibrosis patients [41, 42], it would be interesting

319

to analyse the ability of mutant strains lacking a functional T4SS to compete with oral and nasal

320

microbiota during infection of susceptible model organisms [43, 44].

321

The new effector/immunity protein (X-Tfe/X-Tfi) pairs identified in this study expand our

322

knowledge on the different effector proteins promoting target-cell toxicity mediated by T4SSs.

323

Most of the characterized T4SS and T6SS antibacterial toxins are enzymes that degrade structural

324

cellular components such as peptidoglycan and phospholipids, thus promoting target cell lysis

325

[45]. Recent studies have identified effectors that change cell metabolism promoting altered cell

326

growth rather than lysis [46, 47]. Promoting target cell stasis is in most cases sufficient to provide

327

the attacker with a competitive advantage, allowing it to outnumber the target species and establish

328

itself in the environment. In natural settings, many species are likely to have acquired resistance

329

mechanisms by means of immunity proteins against specific secreted effectors and may be

330

sensitive to only one or a few effectors within the secreted cocktail. Additionally, bacterial

331

effectors work synergistically and display conditional efficiency depending on the environment

332

[48]. An example of the diversity of effector-immunity pairs carried by different organisms is

333

clearly illustrated here by the duelling observed between S. maltophilia and X. citri, which can kill

334

one another in a T4SS-dependent manner, indicating that each species lacks at least one immunity

335

protein against the rival´s set of T4SS effectors.

336

Among the eleven new S. maltophilia T4SS effectors identified by bioinformatic searches,

337

six of them have N-terminal domains that are not significantly similar in sequence to any other

338

annotated protein domain family. These X-Tfes are particularly interesting since they could

339

possibly promote toxic effects by different mechanisms from those described for the majority of

340

antibacterial type 6- and type 4 effectors that target the cell wall, membranes or nucleic acids [6,

341

46, 49-51]. Smlt3024 induced a severe reduction in growth speed and a decrease in cell size in rich

342

media. However, despite the delay, cells continue to grow for over 8 h (Movie S9), indicating that

343

Smlt3024 expression does not lead to cell death in laboratory conditions. As slower growth speed

344

and decreased cell-sizes are reminiscent of cells growing in nutrient deprived media [52], we

345

speculate that Smlt3024 could somehow induce a starvation response either by mimicking a

346

systemic response, blocking an important metabolic pathway or blocking a key nutrient importer.

347

This work contributes with knowledge on the virulence mechanisms used by S. maltophilia

348

allowing it to survive in polymicrobial communities and maintain environmental reservoirs. The

349

work also expands our current knowledge about the subtypes of T4SSs involved in interbacterial

350

killing for which the diversity and mechanism of toxicity from secreted substrates, and distribution

351

among bacterial species we are only beginning to understand.

Bacterial strains and culture conditions

355

S. maltophilia K279a [32] and X. citri pv. citri 306 [53] were grown in 2x YT media (16

356

g/L tryptone, 10 g/L yeast extract, 5 g/L NaCl). E. coli strain K-12 subsp. MG1655 [54] was used

357

in competition assays because of its endogenous expression of β-galactosidase. E. coli DH5α and

358

E. coli HST08 were used for cloning purposes and E. coli S17 was used for conjugation with S.

359

maltophilia. The X. citri T4SS mutant strain lacks all chromosomal virB genes and has the msfGFP

360

gene under the control of virB7 endogenous promoter (ΔvirB-GFP) while the X. citri-GFP strain

361

has a functional T4SS and expresses GFP as transcriptional fusion under the control of virB7

362

promoter (Cenens et al., in preparation). For time-lapse imaging of S. maltophilia and X. citri

363

strains, AB defined media was used (0.2% (NH4)2SO4, 0.6% Na2HPO4, 0.3% KH2PO4, 0.3% NaCl,

364

0.1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 3 µM FeCl3) supplemented with 0.2% sucrose, 0.2% casamino acids,

365

10 µg/mL thiamine and 25 µg/mL uracil. Cultures of E. coli and S. maltophilia were grown at

366

37°C with agitation (200 rpm) and X. citri cultures were grown at 28°C with agitation (200 rpm).

367

Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations to select S. maltophilia strains: tetracycline

368

40 µg/mL and streptomycin 150 µg/mL. For selection of E. coli strains, kanamycin 50 µg/ml and

369

spectinomycin 100 µg/ml were used when appropriate. For induction from PBAD promoter, 0.2%

370

L-arabinose was added. For PTAC induction, 200 µM IPTG was used. Expression from both

371

promoters was repressed using 0.2% D-glucose.

372

Cloning and mutagenesis

373

All primers and plasmids used for cloning are listed in S2 Table. To produce in-frame

374

deletions of virD4 (smlt3008), we used a two-step integration/excision exchange process and the

375

pEX18Tc vector [55]. Fragments of ~1000-bp homologous to the upstream and downstream

376

regions of smlt3008 were amplified by PCR and cloned into pEX18Tc using standard restriction

377

digestion and ligation. The pEX18Tc-ΔvirD4 was transformed in E. coli S17 donor cells by

378

electroporation and transferred to S. maltophilia recipients via conjugation following the protocol

379

described by Welker et al. [56]. Tetracycline-resistant colonies were first selected. Colonies were

380

then grown in 2x YT without antibiotic and plated on 2x YT agar containing 10% sucrose without

381

antibiotic. Mutant clones were confirmed by PCR. To complement the ΔvirD4 strain, the gene

382

encoding full-length smlt3008 was PCR amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into the pBRA

383

vector, which is a pBAD24-derived vector that promotes low constitutive expression in

384

Stenotrophomonas/Xanthomonas under non-inducing conditions (M. Marroquin, unpublished).

385

The pBRA construct encoding full-length X. citri virD4/XAC2623 was reported previously [6].

386

For secretion assays, the full-length sequence of smlt3024 was cloned into pBRA vector, including

387

a FLAG tag on its N-terminus and transformed into S. maltophilia wild-type and ΔvirD4. Plasmids

388

were transformed into S. maltophilia by electroporation (2.5 kV, 200 Ω, 25 µF, 0.2 cm cuvettes),

389

followed by streptomycin selection. For cloning smlt3024 and smlt3025 into pSUMO – a modified

390

version of pET28a (Novagen), adding a SUMO tag between the hexahistidine and the cloning site

391

– we used the soluble portion of Smlt3025 (residues between 86-333) that lacks the N-terminal

392

signal peptide and the full-length Smlt3024. To produce smlt3024 with the pelB periplasmic

393

localization sequence, PCR products were first cloned in pET22b (Novagen; containing the N-

394

terminal pelB sequence) after the pelB-smlt3024 construct was transferred to pBRA using Gibson

395

assembly. For the immunity protein smtl3025, three different constructs were cloned in pEXT22

396

[57]: one starting at the annotated start-codon and two starting at two downstream putative start-

397

codons (positions 17 and 45). The sequences of all constructs containing effectors in pBRA and

398

immunity proteins in pEXT22 were confirmed by DNA sequencing to assure absence of point

400

sequencing service (https://dna.macrogen.com/).

401

Bacterial competition assays

402

Bacterial competition was assessed either by analysing target cell growth or target cell

403

lysis. To analyse E. coli growth during co-incubation with S. maltophilia we used a protocol

404

adapted from Hachani et al. [58]. Briefly, strains were subcultured 1:100 and grown to exponential

405

phase for 2 h at 37˚C (200 rpm). Cells were washed with 2x YT and the optical density measured

406

at 600 nm (OD600nm) adjusted to 1. Serial dilutions (1:4) of E. coli culture was performed in 96

407

well plates. Equal volumes of E. coli and S. maltophilia cultures at OD600nm 1.0 were mixed into

408

each well. After mixing, 5 µl were spotted onto LB-agar plates containing 100 µM IPTG (isopropyl

409

β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside)

410

galactopyranoside) using multichannel pipettes. Plates were incubated for 24 h at 30˚C. Analysis

411

of target cell death was performed using CPRG (chlorophenol red-β-D-galactopyranoside) as

412

described previously with minor modifications [18, 59]. Briefly, S. maltophilia and E. coli

413

overnight cultures were subcultured 1:100 – the latter containing 200 µM IPTG – and grown at

414

37˚C (200 rpm) to reach OD600nm of approximately 1. Cells were washed with LB media, OD600nm

415

adjusted to 1.0 for S. maltophilia strains and OD600nm adjusted to 8.0 for E. coli. The adjusted

416

cultures were mixed 1:1 and 10 µL spotted in triplicate onto 96 well plates containing 100 µL of

417

solid 1.5% 2x YT agar and 40 µg/mL CPRG. Plates were let dry completely, covered with adhesive

418

seals and analysed on a SpectraMax Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices) at 572 nm every 10

419

min for 3.5 h. E. coli cultures were also spotted onto the same plate as a control for spontaneous

420

cell death. The obtained A572 data was processed using RStudio (www.rstudio.com) and plotted

421

using the ggplot2 package [60]. Background intensities obtained from the mean A572 values

422

containing only E. coli cells were subtracted from all data series. The initial A572 value at time-

423

point 0 min was subtracted from all subsequent time-points to correct for small differences in

424

initial measurements. Finally, the curves of S. maltophilia ΔvirD4 and complementation strains

425

were normalized to those obtained for the S. maltophilia wild-type strain.

426

Time-lapse microscopy

427

For time-lapse imaging of bacterial killing at the single-cell level, agar slabs containing

428

either 2x YT or supplemented AB media were created by cutting a rectangular frame out of a

429

double-sided adhesive tape (3MTM VHBTM transparent, 24 mm wide, 1 mm thick), which was

430

taped onto a first microscopy slide. Into the resulting tray, agar was poured and covered by a

431

second microscopy glass slide to create a smooth surface. After solidification, the second

432

microscopy slide was removed, exposing the agar’s surface onto which 2 µl of cell suspensions

433

were spotted. After cell suspensions were left to dry completely, a #1.5 cover glass (Corning) was

434

laid on top of the agar slab and closed at the sides by the second adhesive layer of the tape, leaving

435

the cell mixtures closely and stably pressed between cover glass and the agar slab. Soon after,

436

phase contrast images together with GFP or RFP excitation images were obtained with a Leica

437

DMI-8+ epi-fluorescent microscope equipped with the Leica DFC365 FX camera, a HC PL APO

438

100x/1.4 Oil ph3 objective (Leica), a GFP excitation-emission band-pass filter cube (Ex: 470/40,

439

DC: 495, EM: 525/50; Leica) and a Cy3/Rhodamine excitation-emission band-pass filter cube (Ex:

440

541/51, DC: 560, EM: 565/605; Leica). An incubation cage around the microscope kept

441

temperatures constant at 37°C for E. coli and S. maltophilia experiments and at 28°C for

442

experiments with X. citri. Several separate positions of each cell mixture were imaged every 10-

443

15 min after auto-focusing using the LASX software package (Leica). Images were further

444

processed with the FIJI software using the Bio-Formats plugin [61]. Time-lapse images were

visually scored for cell lysis events. Small groups of cells (approximately 2 to 8 cells per colony)

446

containing a mixture of bacterial species in close contact with each other were tagged at time-point

447

zero and followed during 100 min (E. coli and S. maltophilia competitions) or 300 min (X. citri

448

and S. maltophilia competitions) and cell lysis events were manually registered. Approximately

449

100 cells were scored for each assay.

BLASTp searches

451

To identify putative effectors secreted by the S. maltophilia T4SS, we used the XVIPCDs

452

of known and putative X. citri T4SS substrates (residues in parenthesis): XAC4264(140-279),

multi-angle light scattering), using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) coupled to a Wyatt

474

MALS detector. Graphs and the average molecular masses were generated using the ASTRA

475

software (Wyatt), assuming a refractive index increment dn/dc = 0.185 mL/g.

Secretion assay and immunoblot

477

Secretion assays were performed essentially as previously described [6]. Briefly, S.

478

maltophilia wild-type and ΔvirD4 strains carrying pBRA-FLAG-smlt3024 were grown overnight

479

with antibiotics (150 µg/mL streptomycin), subcultured on the next day (1:25 dilution) and grown

480

for an additional 2 h at 37˚C (200 rpm). E. coli cells were subcultured (1:100 dilution) in a similar

481

manner. S. maltophilia and E. coli cells were washed with 2x YT, OD600nm adjusted to 1.0, mixed

482

1:1 volume and 5-10 µL were spotted onto dry nitrocellulose membranes, which were quickly

483

placed onto LB-agar plates containing 0.1% L-arabinose to induce the expression of FLAG-

484

Smlt3024. Plates were incubated at 30˚C for 6 h, sufficient to allow detection of secreted proteins

485

and before spontaneous cell death, which would produce background in the dot blot. After 6 h,

486

membranes were washed with 5% low-fat milk diluted in PBS containing 0.02% sodium azide and

487

processed for quantitative dot blot analysis with anti-FLAG rabbit polyclonal antibody, followed

488

by IRDye 800CW anti-rabbit IgG (LI-COR Biosciences) and scanned using an Odyssey CLx

489

infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). To obtain good signal to noise ratios, the
