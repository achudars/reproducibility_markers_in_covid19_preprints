Abstract

18

The evolution of antiviral genes has been fundamentally shaped by antagonistic

19

interactions with ancestral viruses. The AID/APOBEC family genes (AID and

20

APOBEC1-4) encode cellular cytosine deaminases that target nucleic acids and

21

catalyze C-to-U mutations. In the case of retroviral replication, APOBEC3 proteins

22

induce C-to-U mutations in minus-stranded viral DNA, which results in G-to-A

23

mutations in the viral genome. Previous studies have indicated that the expansion

24

and rapid evolution of mammalian APOBEC3 genes has been driven by an arms

25

race with retroviral parasites, but this has not been thoroughly investigated.

26

Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are retrotransposons originated from ancient

27

retroviral infections. These sequences sometimes bear the hallmarks of APOBEC3-

28

mediated mutations, and therefore serve as a record of the ancient conflict between

29

retroviruses and APOBEC3 genes. Here we systematically investigated the

30

sequences of ERVs and APOBEC3 genes in mammals to reconstruct details of the

31

evolutionary conflict between them. We identified 1,420 AID/APOBEC family genes

32

in a comprehensive screen of mammalian genome. Of the AID/APOBEC family

33

genes, APOBEC3 genes have been selectively amplified in mammalian genomes

34

and disclose evidence of strong positive selection - whereas the catalytic domain

35

was highly conserved across species, the structure loop 7, which recognizes viral

36

DNA/RNA substrates, was shown to be evolving under strong positive selection.

37

Although APOBEC3 genes have been amplified by tandem gene duplication in most

38

mammalian lineages, the retrotransposition-mediated gene amplification was found

39

in several mammals including New World monkeys and prosimian primates.

40

Comparative analysis revealed that G-to-A mutations are accumulated in ERVs, and

41

that the G-to-A mutation signatures on ERVs is concordant with the target

42

preferences of APOBEC3 proteins. Importantly, the number of APOBEC3 genes was

43

significantly correlated with the frequency of G-to-A mutations in ERVs, suggesting

44

that the amplification of APOBEC3 genes led to stronger attacks on ERVs and/or

45

their ancestral retroviruses by APOBEC3 proteins. Furthermore, the numbers of

46

APOBEC3 genes and ERVs in mammalian genomes were positively correlated, and

47

in primates, the timings of APOBEC3 gene amplification was concordant with that of

Introduction

51

Gene evolution is driven by a variety of factors including interactions with

52

pathogens1,2. For instance, the genes encoding major histocompatibility complex

53

have diversified and evolved to combat various pathogens as a central player of

54

acquired immunity in mammals3. These insights indicate that the evolutionary

55

conflicts between hosts and their invaders have shaped the evolution of genes that

56

are important for protecting the hosts from pathogens.

57

Activation-induced cytidine deaminase/apolipoprotein B mRNA editing

58

enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like (AID/APOBEC) superfamily proteins are cellular

59

cytosine deaminases that catalyze C-to-U mutations in nucleotides. AID/APOBEC

60

family proteins contain conserved zinc-dependent catalytic domain (Z domain) with

61

the HxE/SPCxxC motif and are closely associated with important phenomena found

62

in vertebrates such as immunity, malignancy, metabolism, and infectious diseases

63

(reviewed in refs.

64

and promotes antibody diversification5, and APOBEC1 (A1) regulates lipid

65

metabolism by enzymatically editing the mRNA of apolipoprotein B gene6 . Although

66

the physiological roles of APOBEC2 (A2) and APOBEC4 (A4) remain unknown, it is

67

known that APOBEC3 (A3) proteins play a pivotal role in restricting retroviral

68

replication (reviewed in ref. 7).

4,5

). For instance, AID induces somatic hypermutation in B cells

69

Mammalian A3 proteins are antiviral factors that restrict the replication of

70

retroviruses7 and non-retroviruses8-10. The evolutionary conflict between human

71

A3G protein and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been studied

72

particularly intensively. Human A3G proteins are incorporated into HIV-1 particle and

73

enzymatically induce C-to-U mutations in viral complementary DNA, which results in

74

G-to-A mutations in viral genome11,12. Although A3G-mediated mutations lead to the

75

accumulation of lethal and missense mutations in viral genome and ultimately

76

abolish viral replication, an HIV-1-encoding protein, viral infectivity factor (Vif),

77

counteracts this antiviral action by degrading A3G via a ubiquitin-proteasome-

78

dependent manner (reviewed in ref. 7). Such conflicts between A3 proteins and

79

modern viruses (particularly retroviruses) have been reported in a broad range of

80

mammalian species and viruses infecting with them (reviewed in ref. 13).

81

Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are retrotransposon lineages that are

82

thought to have originated from ancient exogenous retroviruses via infection of

83

germline cells14,15. ERVs currently occupy a substantial fraction of mammalian

84

genomes, suggesting that a massive amount of ERVs have invaded the host

85

genomes. To combat such genomic invasions by retroviral parasites, the hosts have

86

developed defense systems such as KRAB zinc-finger proteins16 and PIWI-

87

interacting RNAs17. Interestingly, previous studies reported the suppressive effects

88

of A3 proteins on ERVs and/or their ancestral exogenous retroviruses. A3 proteins

89

can suppress the replications of ERVs in cell cultures14,18 and in a transgenic mouse

90

model19. Furthermore, previous studies addressed the G-to-A hypermutation

91

signature on ERVs in various mammals and proposed that this signature is a sign of

92

the ancient attack by A3 proteins on ERVs and/or their ancestral retroviruses14,15,18,20.

93

Together, these insights suggest a long-standing evolutionary conflict between A3

94

proteins and retroviruses including ERVs.

95

Although the AID/APOBEC family genes except for A3 are conserved in

96

various vertebrates, A3 genes are specifically encoded in placental mammals4.

97

Moreover, although AID, A1, A2 and A4 genes are singly encoded in each vertebrate

98

including mammals, A3 genes are under positive selection21-23 and are highly

99

amplified in multiple mammalian lineages such as primates24. These insights

100

suggest that A3 genes had been acquired and have rapidly evolved and diversified

101

during mammalian evolution. Based on the sequences of their Z domains, A3 genes

102

are classified into three classes, A3Z1, A3Z2 and, A3Z3 (reviewed in refs.

103

For example, human A3 genes are composed of 7 paralogs (A3A, A3B, A3C, A3D,

104

A3F, A3G, and A3H). Of these genes, A3A, A3C and A3H (also known as A3Z1,

105

A3Z2 and A3Z3 in the other mammals) respectively contain single Z domain, while

106

the other four genes harbor double Z domains: A3Z2-A3Z1 for A3B and A3G, A3Z2-

107

A3Z2 for A3D and A3F13,24. The driving forces behind the amplification and

108

diversification of A3 genes remain unclear. However, an attractive hypothesis is that

109

it has been driven by conflict between host species and retroviruses. In this study,

110

we examine the evolutionary history of ERVs and A3 genes in the genomes of 160

111

mammalian species. We newly identify more than 1,000 sequences of A3 Z domains

112

in mammalian genome and uncover a hidden diversity of mammalian A3 genes.

113

Furthermore, we show the evidences suggesting that the rapid evolution of A3 genes,

114

including gene amplification and diversification, was triggered by retroviral invasions

115

and that the amplification of A3 genes led to stronger attacks on retroviruses by A3

116

proteins. To our knowledge, this is the first study comprehensively addressing the

117

evolutionary conflict of ERVs and mammalian A3 genes.

Results

119

Identification and classification of mammalian AID/APOBEC family genes

120

We screened the genome sequences of 160 mammalian species (Supplementary

121

Table 1) and extracted sequences homologous to Z domains of AID/APOBEC family

122

genes using a tBLASTn-based method (http://giffordlabcvr.github.io/DIGS-tool/).

123

Amino acid sequences of AID/APOBEC family genes of five mammals (human,

124

mouse, cow, megabat, and cat) were used as queries of the search (Supplementary

125

Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). Of the extracted sequences, we particularly

126

focused on the sequence region corresponding to the conserved sequence of Z

127

domains of AID/APOBEC family genes (Supplementary Fig. 1a and 1c)24. We

128

identified a total of 1,420 distinct loci disclosing homology to Z domains of

129

AID/APOBEC family genes (Supplementary Table 3). Phylogenetic reconstructions

130

revealed that these loci group into nine clades, of which seven are canonical Z

131

domains of AID/APOBEC family genes (AID, A1, A2, A3Z1, A3Z2, A3Z3, and A4)

132

(Fig. 1a and 1b). We also identified additional, previously uncharacterized groups,

133

designated unclassified AID/APOBEC genes 1 (UA1) and 2 (UA2) (Fig. 1a and 1b).

134

UA1 genes were specifically detected in the basal mammalian lineages Afrotheria

135

(elephants, tenrecs, and sea cows) and Xenarthra (armadillos), while UA2 genes

136

were encoded in marsupials (infraclass Marsupialia) (Fig. 1c). These phylogenetic

137

relationships were supported by multiple methods (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig.

138

2), and HxE and SPCxxC motifs corresponding to the canonical catalytic domain of

139

AID/APOBEC

140

(Supplementary Fig. 3a). Furthermore, UA1 and UA2 genes were under the

141

purifying selection (Supplementary Fig. 3b). These suggest that UA1 and UA2

142

genes are protein-coding sequences and part of the AID/APOBEC family. In fact, the

143

UA2 gene in opossum (Monodelphis domestica) was annotated as ‘APOBEC5’ in a

144

previous study25.

As summarized in Fig. 1b we detected 157 AID, 166 A1, 157 A2, 266 A3Z1,

147

genomes. Interestingly, A3Z1 and A3Z2 genes were highly amplified, while the other

148

family genes were not (Fig. 1b and 1c). We also found that some sequences,

149

particularly those of A3 genes, were pseudogenized (Fig. 1b).

150

Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 4 illustrate the numbers of the Z domains

151

of AID/APOBEC family genes identified in each mammalian species. The numbers

152

of A3 Z domains were different among species, and particularly, A3Z1 and A3Z2

153

genes in Perissodactyla, Chiroptera, Primates, and Afrotheria were highly amplified.

154

Consistent with previous reports21,26,27, canonical A3 genes were not detected in

155

marsupials and Monotremata. Also, A3Z1 was commonly absent in Rodentia, and

156

A3Z3 was absent in Strepsirrhini and Microchiroptera. Higher amplifications of A3Z3

157

gene were not detected in any mammals. Although the duplication of A3Z3 gene

158

was specifically observed in Carnivora, the duplicated ones were pseudogenized

159

(Supplementary Fig. 5).

160
161

Evolutionary history of mammalian A3 genes

162

To investigate the evolutionary history of mammalian A3 genes, we examined

163

sequence characteristics of AID/APOBEC genes. As shown in Fig. 2a, the positional

164

conservation scores (Shannon entropy scores) in A3Z1, A3Z2, and A3Z3 genes

165

tended to be much higher than those of the other AID/APOBEC family genes,

166

indicating strong positive selection favoring diversification. We then detected the

167

codon sites under the positive selection through dN/dS ratio test (branch-site

168

model28). Although the catalytic domains, which are composed of HxE and SPCxxC

169

motifs4,5,7, were highly conserved in the seven AID/APOBEC family proteins, we

170

detected substantial numbers of positively selected sites in A3 proteins (Fig. 2b).

171

Notably, comparisons to the amino acid positions to those of human A3A (A3Z1

172

ortholog in primates)29, A3C (A3Z2 ortholog in primates)30, and A3H (A3Z3 ortholog

173

in primates)31 revealed that the positively selected sites are preferentially detected

174

in a structural region, called loop 7, which recognizes substrate nucleic acids (Fig.

175

2b). Moreover, most of the positively selected sites are located on the protein surface

176

(Fig. 2b).

177

Investigation of amplified A3 loci revealed that the majority of A3 genes are

178

encoded in the canonical A3 genomic locus, which is sandwiched by CBX6 and

179

CBX7 genes (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 4), as previously described13,24.

180

These results suggest that the amplifications of A3 genes were mainly occurred as

181

the tandem gene duplication. However, exceptions to this rule were identified in

182

primates: the genomes of three species, Saimiri boliviensis, Aotus nancymaae, and

183

Otolemur garnettii, were found to encode more A3 loci outside the canonical locus

184

than within it (Fig. 3b). When we assessed the genomic loci of the A3 genes in these

185

three primates, most of the A3 genes were encoded at entirely distinct loci each

186

other (Fig. 3c). Furthermore, these A3 genes in New World monkeys (Saimiri

187

boliviensis and Aotus nancymaae) exhibit intron-less structures (Supplementary

188

Fig. 6a), which would have been originated via mRNA splicing followed by reverse

189

transcription32. These findings suggest that the A3 genes encoded at the outside of

190

the canonical A3 locus likely originated via retrotransposition. These retrotransposed

191

A3 genes in New World monkeys were more closely related to human A3G gene

192

compared to the other double-domain A3 genes in human (Supplementary Fig. 6b).

193

Although most of these retrotransposed A3 genes are pseudogenized (Fig. 3d),

194

some of them retain relatively longer open reading frames (ORFs) (Supplementary

195

Fig. 6c). In particular, one of these retrotransposed A3 genes in Aotus nancymaae

196

(referred to as "outside #3") retains a full-length ORF (Supplementary Fig. 6c).

197

Moreover, we analyzed public RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) data and revealed that

198

mRNA of this outside #3 was expressed in a broad range of tissues of Aotus

199

nancymaae (Supplementary Fig. 7). Further, we found that this outside #3 is

200

annotated as A3G gene of Aotus nancymaae (ENSANAG00000031271) in the

201

Ensembl gene database (http://www.ensembl.org; Release 97). Taken together,

202

A3G-like genes were amplified via retrotransposition in New World monkeys, and

203

some of these amplified genes seem to be functional.

207

To explore the impact of A3 activity on ERVs and their ancestor of ancient

208

exogenous retroviruses, we performed comparative analysis of transposable

209

elements (TEs) including ERVs in 160 species of mammals. As shown in Fig. 4a

210

and Supplementary Fig. 8, the TE composition of mammalian species varies with

211

respect to the proportions of DNA transposons, SINEs, LINEs, and ERVs. To

212

investigate the accumulation level of G-to-A mutations in ERVs, we measured the

213

strand bias of the G-to-A mutation rate in ERVs and other TEs. Since A3 protein

214

induces G-to-A mutations selectively on the positive strand of retroviruses, the strand

215

bias can be regarded as an indicator of the A3 attack on retroviruses. As shown in

216

Fig. 4b, G-to-A mutations were accumulated preferentially on the positive strand of

217

human ERVs but not of the other human TEs. We next classified mutation patterns

218

based on the dinucleotide context. As shown in Fig. 4c, ERVs in the human genome

219

preferentially exhibited either GG-to-AG or GA-to-AA mutations, consistent with the

220

reported preferences of human A3G (GG-to-AG) and A3D, A3F, and A3H (GA-to-

221

AA mutations)11,33-39. Additionally, some ERVs exhibited G-to-A hypermutations (Fig.

222

4d).

223

To explore the impact of the amplification of A3 genes on ERVs, we assessed

224

the accumulation level of G-to-A mutations in ERVs across mammals

225

(Supplementary Fig. 9). Subsequently, we examined the association of the number

226

of A3 Z domains with the accumulation level of G-to-A mutations in ERVs and found

227

the strong positive correlation (Fig. 4e) (Pearson’s correlation coefficient = 0.69, p <

228

1.0E-15). Collectively, these findings suggest that ERVs in mammals having no or

229

fewer A3 genes (e.g., non-placental mammals or rodents) exhibited lower

230

accumulation levels of G-to-A mutations, whereas ERVs in mammals having a

231

higher number of A3 genes (e.g., Simiiformes and some chiropterans) exhibited

232

higher accumulation levels of G-to-A mutations.

233
234

Association between A3 gene family expansion and ERV invasion

235

Finally, we examined the association between ERV invasions and A3 gene family

236

expansion. As shown in Fig. 5a and 5b, we found that the number of A3 Z domain

237

was positively associated with the percentage of ERVs in mammalian genome (in

238

Poisson regression, coefficient = 0.14, p < 1.0E-15). Thus, species invaded by a

239

larger amount of ERVs tended to have a higher number of A3 genes. Exceptions

240

occur in the rodent family Muridae, and two other species, hedgehog (Erinaceus

241

europaeus), and opossum (Monodelphis domestica); all of these species have

242

undergone a larger number of retroviral genome invasions but possessed few or no

243

A3 genes (Supplementary Fig. 10). As expected, ERVs in these species exhibited

244

lower accumulation levels of G-to-A mutations (Fig. 5b). Furthermore, insertion

245

dates of ERVs in these species were relatively young (Supplementary Fig. 11 and
10

246

12). Thus, ERVs seem to have prominently invaded in the genomes of these species

247

without suffering from the intensive mutation-mediated attacks by A3 proteins.

248

To deeply illuminate the association of A3 gene family expansion with ERV

249

invasion, we focused on the timing of these two events in Primates. Through

250

assessing the age of ERV invasions in each species according to the genomic

251

distance of each ERV integrant form the consensus sequence, we found that ERVs

252

prominently invaded in the ancestors of Simiiformes (including Hominoidea, Old

253

World monkeys, and New World monkeys) around 50 million years ago (MYA) (Fig.

254

5c, left). On the other hand, ancestors of Prosimians (including Lemurs, Lorisoids,

255

and Tarsiers) have not experienced such prominent ERV invasion in that period.

256

Furthermore, Simiiformes encoded higher numbers of A3 genes, whereas

257

Prosimians encoded lower numbers of A3 genes (except for Otolemur garnettii),

258

suggesting that the A3 gene amplification occurred during early divergence of

259

Simiiformes (Fig. 5c, middle). Moreover, we investigated the timing of the formation

260

of the double-domain A3G gene (i.e., A3G gene with A3Z2-A3Z1 structure) using

261

the Ensembl gene database (www.ensembl.org/). We found that Simiiformes

262

encoded the double-domain (A3Z2- A3Z1) A3G gene, whereas Prosimians did not,

263

suggesting that the formation of the double-domain A3G gene also occurred during

264

that period (Fig. 5c, right). Absence of the double-domain A3G gene in Prosimians

265

is supported by the finding that no A3Z2-A3Z1 genetic structures were observed in

266

Prosimian genomes (Fig. 3c). Taken together, the timings of A3 gene amplification

267

and diversification were highly concordant to the timing of the prominent ERV

268

invasions in Primates.

Discussion

270

At present, mammalian A3 proteins are considered to represent antiviral factors

271

against various retroviruses13 and non-retroviruses8-10. Although A3 family proteins

272

are capable of targeting a broad range of viruses, the target range of individual A3

273

proteins may be relatively specific. For instance, human A3G can antagonize

274

lentiviruses12,40,41 and gammaretroviruses11,40,42 including murine ERVs43 but is

275

incapable of efficiently inhibiting betaretroviruses such as simian retrovirus44 and

276

HERV-K14,45. On the other hand, human A3F potently inhibits the replication of

277

betaretroviruses14,44,45. These observations suggest that the A3 family genes have

278

amplified and diversified to target a broad range of ancient viruses or ERVs; however,

279

this has not been fully investigated. In the present study, we systematically

280

characterized A3 genes and ERVs in 160 mammalian species and shed light on

281

such ancient conflicts between A3 family genes and ERVs and/or their ancestral

282

retroviruses.

283

We showed that species invaded by a larger amount of ERVs tended to

284

encode more A3 Z domains in the genomes (Fig. 5a and 5b). We also demonstrated

285

that the amplification of A3 Z domains occurred around the same time to the

286

prominent genomic invasion of ERVs or their ancestral retroviruses in primates (Fig.

287

5c). These findings suggest that such retroviral genomic invasion was one of the

288

major driving forces for the amplification of mammalian A3 genes. Furthermore, we

289

demonstrated that the accumulation level of G-to-A mutations in ERVs was positively

290

associated with the number of A3 Z domains in the genomes (Fig. 4e). This finding

291

strongly supports the concept proposed previously14,15,18,20 that the accumulation of

292

G-to-A mutations in ERVs is due to A3 proteins. Moreover, this finding also suggests

293

that the amplification of A3 genes led to a stronger attack by A3 proteins on ERVs

294

and/or their ancestral retroviruses. Taken together, our findings provide an evidence

295

that diversification of mammalian A3 genes has been shaped by the conflicts with

296

retroviruses that were actively invading the genomes of mammalian ancestors.

297

We demonstrated that a structural region of A3 proteins, called loop 7, was

298

under strong positive selection (Fig. 2b). Since loop 7 structures of A3 proteins

299

determine the sequence specificity of viral nucleotide substrates46, our findings

300

suggest that various ancestral retroviruses and ERVs could be a particular driver

accelerating the rapid evolution of the A3 genes encoding the loop 7 region. In

302

addition, it is known that HIV-1 Vif specifically binds to the loop 7 structure of human

303

A3G, leading to its degradation47,48. This raises a possibility that the Vif-like proteins

304

encoded by ancestral retroviruses and/or ERVs could be another selective pressure

305

on A3s, particularly loop 7 of the folded protein. In fact, all endogenous lentiviruses

306

encode vif gene-like ORFs49-51. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that ancestral

307

lentiviral Vif-like proteins have exerted selective pressure on mammalian A3 genes,

308

particularly on the loop 7 region. Consistent with this, our analysis shows that most

309

of the sites under positive selection were located on the surface of A3 proteins (Fig.

310

2b). Moreover, it has been recently reported that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and

311

related herpesviruses encode proteins that degrade human A3, and that these A3

312

antagonists specifically recognize loop 78. These findings further suggest that other

313

exogenous viruses could be another evolutionary pressure against mammalian A3s,

314

particularly on the loop 7 structure.

315

The majority of A3 genes are encoded in the canonical A3 locus and have

316

been amplified by tandem gene duplication (Fig. 3a and 3b). However, we also

317

detected the amplification of A3 genes outside this region specifically in three

318

primates (Saimiri boliviensis, Aotus nancymaae, and Otolemur garnetti) via

319

retrotransposition (Fig. 3b and 3c, and Supplementary Fig. 6). Particularly, A3G-

320

like genes were amplified via retrotransposition in New World monkeys (Saimiri

321

boliviensis and Aotus nancymaae), and some of these retrotransposed genes seem

322

to be functional (Supplementary Fig. 6 and Fig. 7). The creation of a novel anti-

323

retroviral gene via retrotransposition in New World monkeys has been documented

324

previously: the TRIMCYP fusion gene found in New World monkeys (genus Aotus)

325

was created via distinct retrotransposition events52,53. This remarkable example of

326

convergence suggests the strong selective pressure that retroviruses exert on this

327

primate.

328

It is known that uncontrolled A3 expression can be harmful for the hosts. In

329

fact, exogenous expression of human A3A (A3Z1 ortholog) in cell cultures triggers

330

cytotoxic effects54-56. Similarly, the aberrant expression of some human A3 proteins,

331

particularly A3A57,58, A3B (A3Z2-A3Z1 ortholog)57-60, and A3H (A3Z3 ortholog)61, can

332

contribute to cancer development by inducing somatic G-to-A mutations in human

333

genome. In this study, we observed the gene loss as well as gene amplification of

334

A3 genes in multiple lineages of mammals (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 4). For

335

example, A3Z1 gene was lost in Rodentia, and A3Z3 gene was lost in Strepsirrhini

336

and Microchiroptera. These findings might be attributed to genotoxic potential of

337

these A3 genes. More interestingly, although A3Z3 gene is highly conserved in most

338

mammals except for some lineages (e.g., marsupials, microbats, and prosimians),

339

A3Z3 gene is not amplified in most mammalian lineages unlike A3Z1 and A3Z2

340

genes. As exceptions for A3Z3 duplication, we detected the duplicated A3Z3 genes

341

specifically in carnivores and some species; however, almost all duplicated A3Z3

342

genes were pseudogenized (Supplementary Fig. 5). Moreover, the duplication

343

events

344

observations strongly support the idea that A3Z3 gene is indispensable for the hosts,

345

but its duplication might be genotoxic. Taken together, our findings suggest the

346

presence of the evolutionary constraints in A3 gene amplification due to the

genotoxic effects of A3 proteins.

348

Although A3 proteins can suppress retroviral replication in a G-to-A

349

mutation-independent fashion (e.g., inhibition of reverse transcription)62-65, we here

350

did not address this aspect because of the technical difficulty to assess the mutation-

351

independent effect of A3 proteins on ERV invasions, based only on the genomic

352

information. It should also be noted that the number of A3 genes counted in this

353

study might underestimate from the true value because of relatively low resolution

354

of many whole genome sequences. Moreover, we particularly focused on the

355

numbers and sequences of the Z domain of AID/APOBEC family genes, and we

356

could not fully address whether (1) some two Z domains compose a double domain

357

gene and (2) there are splicing variants. Nevertheless, here we covered most

358

mammalian linages and showed a clear correlation between the number of ERVs

359

and the number of A3 genes. Moreover, the greater the number of A3 genes

360

encoded by a given host, the more G-to-A mutations are detected in their ERVs. To

361

our knowledge, this is the first investigation comprehensively describing the

362

evolutionary relationship between ancient retroviruses and A3 family genes in a

363

broad range of mammalian species.

Methods

365

Identification of sequences related to AID/APOBEC family genes in

366

mammalian genomes

367

Information of the genome sequences analyzed in this study is summarized in

368

Supplementary Table 1. To retrieve sequences homologous to AID/APOBEC

369

family genes, we first screened these genomes using The DIGS tool

370

(http://giffordlabcvr.github.io/DIGS-tool/), a tBLASTn-based method. As the queries,

371

amino acid sequences of AID/APOBEC family genes of five mammals (human,

372

mouse, cow, megabat, and cat) were used (Supplementary Fig. 1 and

373

Supplementary Table 2). Threshold of the bit score in the tBLASTn search was set

374

at 50 bit. Of the hit sequences in the DIGS search, we subsequently extracted the

375

regions including the sequence corresponding to the conserved sequence of

376

AID/APOBEC family genes24 (“extracted region” is summarized in Supplementary

377

Fig. 1a). Since this conserved sequence is located on a single exon in AID/APOBEC

378

family genes (Supplementary Fig. 1c), this sequence can be extracted continuously.

379

Of these hit sequences, we removed a sequence in which the sequence alignment

380

does not cover >70% of the conserved sequence in the query (Supplementary Fig.

381

13). We also discarded hit sequences containing undetermined nucleotides (i.e., Ns).

382

To further remove unreliable hit sequences, we performed a phylogenetic tree-based

383

filtering. First, we constructed the phylogenetic tree of the hit sequences using

384

neighbor-joining (NJ) method66 implemented in MEGAX67. Subsequently, the outlier

385

sequence, which has >5 Z score with respect to the external branch length in the

386

tree, was detected and discarded. The final set of the identified sequences of

387

AID/APOBEC family genes is summarized in Supplementary Table 3.

388

Phylogenetic classification of the identified sequences of AID/APOBEC

389

family genes was performed according to the following procedures: multiple

390

sequence alignment (MSA) of the sequences was constructed using MAFFT

391

(version 7.407)68 with the algorism L-INS-I. Phylogenetic tree was reconstructed

392

using NJ method66 implemented in MEGAX67. Alignment sites with the >85% site

393

coverages were used for the tree construction. According to the tree topology, we

394

categorized the identified sequences into nine groups as summarized in

395

Supplementary Table 3.

396

The identified sequences of AID/APOBEC family genes were classified into

397

intact or pseudogenized genes according to the presence or absence of the

398

premature stop codons. If a sequence contains ambiguous nucleotides (e.g., R or

399

Y), the sequence was assigned the category “not determined (in Fig. 1b)”.

400
401

Characterization of evolutionary features of AID/APOBEC family genes

402

For each class of AID/APOBEC family genes, MSA of the nucleotide sequences was

403

constructed using MUSCLE69 with the codon-based alignment algorism. Codon sites

404

with >50% site coverages were only used for the downstream analyses. The MSA

405

was translated to the amino acid MSA. Logo plots of the amino acid sequences were

406

generated using weblogo370. Positional Shannon’s entropy score of the amino acid

407

sequences was calculated using an web application in the Los Alamos HIV-1

408

sequence

(www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/ENTROPY/entropy_one.html).

Characterization of the genomic location of AID/APOBEC family genes

416

To determine the canonical genomic locus of A3 genes (i.e., the region sandwiched

417

by CBX6 and CBX7), the genomic locations of CBX6 and CBX7 were determined

418

using The DIGS tool (http://giffordlabcvr.github.io/DIGS-tool/). The threshold of

419

tBLASTn search in DIGS analysis was set at 50 bit. We only analyzed a genome in

420

which CBX6 and CBX7 were detected on the same scaffold in the downstream

421

analysis. Sequences of AID/APOBEC family genes identified in this study were

422

classified with respect to the presence or absence in the canonical A3 locus

423

(Supplementary Table 4). Genomic synteny of AID/APOBEC family genes was

424

illustrated using ggplot2 (https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) with the library ggquiver

(https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/ggquiver) implemented in R.

429

sequence of the non-canonical (i.e., “outside”) A3 genes, genome sequences of

430

these two species were scanned by BLASTn search using the query sequence of

431

human A3G mRNA (Genbank accession number NM_021822.4). Information of the

432

outside A3 genes identified in this study is summarized in Supplementary Table 5.

433

The gene structures were illustrated using the low-level plotting functions pre-

434

implemented in R.

435
436

RNA-Seq analysis of AID/APOBEC family genes

437

To detect expression of AID/APOBEC family genes in New World monkey tissues,

438

RNA-Seq data in public databases was analyzed. RNA-Seq dataset used in the

439

present study is summarized in Supplementary Table 6. RNA-Seq reads were

440

trimmed by Trimmomatic (version 0.36)71 and subsequently mapped to the reference

441

genomes using STAR (version 020201)72. Reads mapped on the identified loci of

442

AID/APOBEC family genes were counted using featureCounts (version 1.6.4)73. In

443

the read count, a read mapped to a unique genomic region was only counted. Read

444

counts were normalized with the total uniquely mapped reads, and expression levels

445

were measured as fragments per kilobase per million mapped fragments (FPKM).

Detection of footprints of A3 activity in ERVs

457

To assess the accumulation level of G-to-A mutations in ERVs and the other TEs,

458

the strand bias of the G-to-A mutation rate was calculated as the following

459

procedures: First, mutations were detected in each TE integrant compared to the

460

consensus sequence of the TE group. For this comparison, the pairwise sequence

461

alignment outputted by RepeatMasker was used. TE integrant with low-confidential

462

alignments (<1000 Smith-Waterman score) was excluded from the analysis. Second,

463

G-to-A mutation rates in the positive and negative strands were calculated. Finally,

464

the strand bias score was defined as a rate ratio of the G-to-A mutation between the

465

positive and negative strands (i.e., the mutation rate in the positive strand was

466

divided by the one in the negative strand). The strand bias score was calculated for

467

each TE integrant or each TE group. Statistical significance of the strand bias was

468

evaluated by Fisher’s exact test with false discovery rate calculation by Benjamini-

469

Hochberg method.

470

Site preference of the G-to-A mutations in human ERVs was evaluated at

471

the dinucleotide context. This preference was assessed for each group of ERVs. G-

472

to-A mutation rates in GA, GT, GC, and GG sites were separately calculated, and

473

the variation of the mutation rates among these four sites was evaluated as

474

coefficient of variation (i.e., standard deviation divided by mean).

475
476

Estimation of insertion dates of ERVs

477

Insertion dates of respective ERV loci were estimated by the two distinct methods:

478

the ortholog distribution-based and genetic distance-based methods. The ortholog

479

distribution-based estimation was performed for ERVs in human and mouse

480

genomes. Liftover chain files were downloaded from UCSC genome browser

481

(https://genome.ucsc.edu/)

482

(http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver) and the chain file, the genomic

483

coordinate of ERV integrant in one genome was tried to be converted to that in

484

another genome with the option “minMatch=0.5”. If this conversion succeeded, we

485

judged that the orthologous copy of the ERV integrant was present in the

486

corresponding genome. In case of mouse ERVs, we first converted genomic

487

coordinates of ERVs in “Mm9” to those in “Mm10”, which is the latest version of the

488

mouse reference genome. Subsequently, the genomic coordinates in “Mm10”

489

converted to those in the genomes of respective species. Insertion dates of ERVs

490

were estimated from the ortholog distributions according to the scheme summarized

491

in Supplementary Fig. 14.

492

The genetic distance-based estimation of insertion dates was performed

493

for ERVs in Primates, Rodents, Insectivora, and Marsupialia. Genetic distance of

494

each ERV integrant from the consensus sequence was calculated using

495

RepeatMasker (http://repeatmasker.org). Subsequently, the amounts of ERV

496

insertions in respective genetic distances were summarized using the function

497

“Repeat Landscape” implemented in RepeatMasker. The genetic distance was

498

converted to the insertion date under the molecular clock assumption. As the

499

mutation

500

mutation/year/site75 was used. Under this mutation rate, the estimated insertion

501

dates were highly concordant between the genetic distance-based and ortholog

502

distribution-based methods for human ERVs (Supplementary Fig. 15). As the

503

mutation rate for Rodents, 7.0 × 10-9 mutation/year/site was used. This is because

504

(1) evolutionary rate in Rodents is known to be much faster than those in the other

505

mammals, particularly after the divergence between mouse and rat76; and (2) under

506

this mutation rate, the estimated insertion dates were highly concordant between the

507

genetic distance-based and ortholog distribution-based methods for mouse ERVs

Fig. 5. Association between A3 gene family expansion and ERV invasion.

809

a, b Association of the number of A3 Z domains with the amount of ERV insertions

810

in the genome. Dots are colored according to the species taxa (a) or the

811

accumulation level of G-to-A mutations in ERVs (b). The association was evaluated

812

under the Poisson regression with log link function.

813

c Association of the timings between ERV invasion and the A3 gene amplification in

814

Primates. (Left) Amount of ERV insertions at each age in respective primate species.

815

ERV insertion date was estimated based on the genetic distance of each ERV

816

integrant from the consensus sequence under the molecular clock assumption (2.2

817

× 10-9 mutation/site/year75). (Middle) Number of intact A3 Z domains. (Right)

818

Schematic of the multiple sequence alignment of A3G (A3Z2-Z3Z1 type) gene.

819

Sequences of A3G genes in Primates recorded in the Ensembl gene database

820

(http://www.ensembl.org) were used. NA, not applicable (no available data).
