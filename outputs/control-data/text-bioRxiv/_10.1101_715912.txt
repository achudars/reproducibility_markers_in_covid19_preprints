Abstract
During development, the nervous system undergoes refinement process by which neurons
initially extend an excess number of neurites, the majority of which will be eliminated by the
mechanism called neurite pruning. Some neurites undergo stereotyped and developmentally
regulated pruning. However, the signaling cues that instruct stereotyped neurite pruning are yet
to be fully elucidated. Here we show that Wnt morphogen instructs stereotyped neurite pruning
for proper neurite projection patterning of the cholinergic motor neuron called PDB in C.
elegans. In the loss of lin-44/wnt and lin-17/frizzled mutant animals, the PDB neurites often
failed to prune and grew towards the lin-44-expressing cells. Surprisingly, membrane-tethered
lin-44 is sufficient to induce proper neurite pruning in PDB, suggesting that neurite pruning does
not require Wnt gradient. LIN-17 and DSH-1/Dishevelled proteins were recruited to the pruning
neurites in lin-44-dependent manners. Our results revealed the novel gradient-independent role
of Wnt signaling in instructing neurite pruning.

Introduction
Development of the nervous system is a highly dynamic process which involves
neurogenesis, cell migration, neuronal polarization and outgrowth of neuronal processes. It is
also well known that neurons initially extend an excess number of neurites most of which will
later be eliminated by the mechanism called neurite pruning (Riccomagno and Kolodkin, 2015;
Schuldiner and Yaron, 2015). Failure in neurite pruning results in excess arborization and
neuronal connectivity, which could underlie various neurological conditions including
macrocephaly (Jan and Jan, 2010). In vivo imaging techniques have allowed for the elucidation
of genetic and molecular mechanisms that underlie neuronal pruning.
During neuronal refinement, neurites often compete with each other for their target cells
in an activity-dependent manner, and neurites that are outcompeted are eliminated by pruning.
For example, each muscle fiber in the mouse trapezius muscle is initially innervated by multiple
motor neurons in early postnatal stage, while axons with weaker synaptic strength are pruned by
the mechanism called axosome shedding (Bishop et al., 2004; Colman et al., 1997). The neurites
also compete for trophic factors. Axons from rodent sympathetic neurons receive nerve growth
factor (NGF) secreted from the target cells for their survival by inducing the brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which in turn induces pruning of the outcompeted axons
(Deppmann et al., 2008; Singh et al., 2008).
In addition to activity-dependent pruning, many neurites undergo stereotyped pruning
during development (Schuldiner and Yaron, 2015). Several signaling molecules have been
shown to play critical roles in this process. In mouse hippocampus, a chemorepellent
Semaphorin 3F (Sema3F) is expressed in the distal infrapyramidal region and locally induces
infrapyramidal tract (IFT) axon pruning via the PlexinA3-Neuropilin2 receptor complex (Bagri

et al., 2003; Sahay et al., 2003). Neuropilin2 binds and activates β2-Chimaerin, a RacGEF, to
inactivate Rac1 GTPase to induce IFT axon pruning (Riccomagno et al., 2012). Interestingly,
loss of β2-Chimaerin specifically affects the pruning of the IFT axons but does not mimic the
other phenotypes of the Sema3F or PlexinA2 such as axon guidance. Therefore, Sema-Plexin
may utilize a specific downstream signaling cascade to control neurite pruning that differs from
its roles in axon guidance and synapse formation.
Neurite pruning also plays a crucial role in sexually dimorphic neurocircuit formation.
Expression of BDNF from the mammary mesenchyme is required for the innervation of the
mammary gland sensory axons. In males but not in females, a truncated TrkB receptor isoform is
expressed in the mammary mesenchyme which deprives BDNF availability for sensory axons
thereby inducing male-specific axon pruning (Liu et al., 2012). Recent work revealed that SemaPlexin signaling acts as a pruning cue for these sensory axons, as Sema6A and Sema3D
expression in the mammary gland act induce sensory axon pruning through PlexinA4 (Sar
Shalom et al., 2019).
Wnt is a secreted morphogen whose gradient distribution plays critical roles in various
steps of animal development (Bartscherer and Boutros, 2008; Yang, 2012). Wnt signaling is also
crucial in the nervous system development including neurogenesis, neuronal polarization, neurite
outgrowth, axon guidance and synapse formation (He et al., 2018; Inestrosa and Varela-Nallar,
2015; Park and Shen, 2012). Nevertheless, its implication in neurite pruning is still limited. In
Caenorhabditis. elegans, it has been shown that the transcription factor MBR-1/Mblk-1 is
required for the pruning of the excess neurites of the AIM interneurons (Kage et al., 2005),
whose function is antagonized by the trophic role of Wnt signaling (Hayashi et al., 2009). It has
also been shown that Wnt signaling functions as a ‘pro-retraction’ cue in the Drosophila

contralaterally-projecting serotonin-immunoreactive deuterocerebral interneurons (CSDns)
(Singh et al., 2010). It is yet to be determined whether Wnt signaling plays instructive or
permissive roles in neurite pruning.
In the present study, we describe a gradient-independent Wnt signaling in instructing
stereotyped developmental neurite pruning of the PDB cholinergic motor neuron in C. elegans.
From genetic analyses, we found that expression of LIN-44/Wnt in the tail hypodermal cells
instructs pruning of the PDB neurites growing towards the tail hypodermal cells. Surprisingly,
membrane-tethered LIN-44/Wnt is sufficient to induce PDB neurite pruning, suggesting that the
gradient distribution of LIN-44 is not essential for neurite pruning. During this process, LIN44/Wnt directs asymmetric localization of its receptor LIN-17/Frizzled and the intracellular
signaling component DSH-1/Dishevelled to the posterior pruning neurites. Taken together, we
discovered the novel gradient-independent Wnt signaling in instructing developmental neurite
pruning.

Results
Asymmetric neurite pruning during PDB development
PDB is a post-embryonic cholinergic motor neuron derived from the P12 neuroectoblast
cell (Sulston and Horvitz, 1977), and its cell body resides in the preanal ganglion. In
hermaphrodites, PDB sends a single neurite posteriorly toward the tail tip region, where it makes
sharp ‘V-shape’ turn to join the dorsal nerve cord to form en passant synapses onto dorsal body
wall muscles (Figure 1A). While the function of PDB has not been characterized, a recent study
combining mathematical modeling and a cell ablation experiment revealed the role of PDB in
motor coordination (Walker et al., 2017). To investigate the PDB neurite development, we first
generated a transgenic strain in which the PDB neurite and presynapses are labeled by a
membrane-tethered GFPnovo2, a brighter GFP variant (Hendi and Mizumoto, 2018), and a
synaptic vesicle gene, rab-3, fused with mCherry expressed under the kal-1 promoter (Bülow et
al., 2002) (see Materials and methods) (Figure 1A).
The PDB neuron extends its single neurite during late L1 and L2 stages. To understand
how PDB neurite achieves V-shape turning, we first examined the structure of the developing
PDB neurites using a population of semi-synchronized animals (Figure 1B). Interestingly, we
observed that the PDB neuron has a unique transient structure at L2 stage: the ventral neurite
sends a tiny commissure to the dorsal side of the worm where it bifurcates to extend one neurite
posteriorly and one anteriorly (Figure 1C: upper panels). The PDB neuron therefore often has
‘H-shape’ structure with two posterior neurites (one dorsal neurite and one ventral neurite) at the
early L2 stage (Figure 1B). In sharp contrast, the PDB neuron of the most L3/L4 animals
contained no posterior neurite (Figures 1A and 1B). This observation suggests that the posterior
neurites observed at the L2 stage are the transient structures most of which are pruned by the L4

stage. To confirm that the posterior neurites that are present at L2 stage are indeed pruned during
development, we selected 24 L2 animals with at least one posterior neurite in PDB and reexamined its structure at L3/L4 stage (24 hours after the first examination) (Figures 1C and
1D). Among fifteen animals which had two neurites at the L2 stage, ten animals had no posterior
neurite, and five animals had one neurite at L3/L4 stage. Among nine animals with one posterior
neurite at the L2 stage, seven animals had no posterior neurite and two animals had one neurite at
L3/L4 stage. In total, 82.1% (32/39) of the neurites we observed at the L2 stage were pruned
within 24 hours.
Neurons could prune their neurites either by retracting or severing them (Schuldiner and
Yaron, 2015). To distinguish which mechanism the PDB neuron utilizes to prune its posterior
neurites, we conducted the time-lapse imaging during posterior neurite pruning and found that
the posterior neurite became shorter over the development while the dorsal anterior neurite kept
growing (Supplemental Figure 1). This indicates that the posterior neurites are pruned by
retraction rather than the severing followed by degradation. To determine if PDB pruning is
dependent on neuronal activity, we examined mutants of unc-13, which is required for synaptic
vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release (Richmond et al., 1999). We did not observe any
structural defects in PDB such as ectopic posterior neurites in unc-13 mutants, suggesting that
the PDB neurite pruning is not dependent on the neuronal activity (Figure 2E). Taken together,
our observation indicates that the V-shape turn of the PDB neurite is achieved by the asymmetric
pruning of the posterior but not the anterior neurites at the turning point during PDB
development (Figure 1E).

LIN-44/Wnt is required for the asymmetric neurite pruning in PDB

We next sought to identify the molecular cue that instructs pruning of the posterior
neurites in PDB. Recent work has shown that the guidance and outgrowth of the PDB neurite are
disrupted in the mutants of Wnt signaling and syndecan proteoglycans (Saied-Santiago et al.,
2017). Wnt is a family of highly conserved secreted glycoproteins that play pivotal roles in
animal development (Nusse, 2005). Wnt acts through receptors including Frizzled, LRP5/6 and
receptor tyrosine kinase (Ryk). Upon Wnt binding, these receptors execute distinct downstream
cascades via the multi-domain protein, Dishevelled (Sawa and Korswagen, 2013; van
Amerongen and Nusse, 2009).
Previous works have shown that lin-44/wnt is expressed in the hypodermal cells at the tail
tip region (Figure 2A), where it inhibits axon outgrowth and synapse formation, as well as
controls neuronal polarity and asymmetric cell division (Herman et al., 1995; Hilliard and
Bargmann, 2006; Klassen and Shen, 2007; Maro et al., 2009). We therefore examined the
relative position of the PDB neurites and the lin-44-expressing cells labeled with the blue
fluorescent protein (BFP) expressed under the lin-44 promoter during development. Strikingly, at
the L2 stage when PDB posterior neurites undergo pruning, we found that the pruning posterior
neurite was located in close proximity to the most posterior hypodermal cell, hyp10 (Figures 2B
and 2C). Interestingly, we noticed that hyp10 often showed the brightest BFP expression among
the lin-44-expressing cells at the L2 stage. The position of the PDB posterior neurites and hyp10
which expressed a high level of lin-44 is well in line with our prediction that lin-44/wnt is a
strong candidate as a pruning cue. We then examined whether the pruning of the posterior
neurites is affected in the lin-44 null mutant background. At L4 stage, approximately 32.3%
(21/65) of the lin-44(n1792) null animals showed cell fate determination defects (no PDB),
neuronal polarity defects (PDB neurite extended anteriorly) and axon guidance defects (Figure

2D, bottom panel and Data not shown). We excluded them from our quantification because
these phenotypes prevented us from examining the neurite pruning defects. Among the lin-44
mutant animals with no obvious cell fate, neuronal polarity or guidance defects, 68.2% (30/44)
of them showed ectopic posterior neurites in PDB at the L4 stage, suggesting the defective
neurite pruning during PDB development (Figures 2D and 2E). To test if the pruning of the
posterior neurites is compromised in the lin-44 mutants, we compared the PDB structure of the
same animal at two developmental time points, second larval (L2) and last larval (L4) stages
(Figures 3A and 3D). As expected, we indeed observed that only 22.9% (8/35) of the posterior
neurites observed at the L2 stage animals are pruned by L3/L4 stage in the lin-44 mutants, which
is significantly lower than those observed in wildtype (82.1%) (Figures 3C and 3D). This result
strongly suggests that lin-44/wnt is required for the pruning of the posterior neurites during PDB
development.

lin-17/fz acts cell-autonomously in PDB to induce neurite pruning
LIN-44/Wnt utilizes LIN-17/Frizzled(Fz) as a primary receptor in many contexts
(Hilliard and Bargmann, 2006; Klassen and Shen, 2007; Sawa et al., 1996). We then tested if lin17/fz also plays a role in neurite pruning in PDB. While lin-17(n671) null mutants showed
significantly more severe cell fate, polarity or guidance defects than lin-44/wnt mutants (Figure
2D), we observed similar posterior neurite pruning defects as lin-44 mutants: only 9.7% of the
posterior neurites (3/31) were pruned 24 hours after L2 stage (Figures 3B-3D). The pruning
defect in the lin-44; lin-17 double mutants was not significantly different from each single
mutant (14.3% of the posterior neurites were pruned), suggesting that lin-44 and lin-17 act in the
same genetic pathway (Figures 3C and 3D). This result is consistent with the idea that lin-17/fz

is the main receptor for lin-44/wnt in PDB neurite pruning. We also conducted tissue-specific
rescue experiments to test if lin-17 functions cell-autonomously in PDB. Expression of lin-17
cDNA either from the pan-neuronal promoter (Prgef-1) or the PDB promoter (Pkal-1)
significantly rescued the pruning defects of lin-17 mutants, suggesting that lin-17 acts cellautonomously in PDB (Supplemental Figure 2). These results indicate that LIN-17/Fz is a
receptor that functions in PDB to receive LIN-44/Wnt signal to induce neurite pruning.

LIN-44/Wnt but not EGL-20/Wnt instructs PDB neurite pruning
Since lin-44/wnt is expressed posteriorly to the PDB neurites, it is possible that LIN-44
acts as an instructive cue for PDB neurite pruning. Alternatively, it might also act as a permissive
cue for PDB neurite pruning. In order to distinguish these two possibilities, we conducted the
rescue experiment by expressing LIN-44 ectopically using the promoter of another wnt gene, egl20. egl-20/wnt is expressed in the cells around preanal ganglions (Whangbo and Kenyon, 1999).
If LIN-44/Wnt functions as an instructive cue, its expression from anterior cells using the egl-20
promoter would not rescue the PDB pruning defect in lin-44 null mutants. If it acts as a
permissive cue, we expect to see the rescue of the PDB neurite pruning defects no matter where
lin-44 is expressed. The lin-44 mutants with an extrachromosomal array Ex[Pegl-20::lin-44] did
not rescue pruning defects of lin-44 null mutants (31.8%, n = 22) (Figures 4A and 4B). On the
other hand, the transgene expressing lin-44 from the lin-44 promoter (Ex[Plin-44::lin-44])
completely rescued the pruning defects (80%, n=20) to the wildtype level (Figures 4A and 4B).
This result suggests that lin-44/wnt is an instructive cue for the posterior neurite pruning in PDB.
egl-20/wnt often acts cooperatively and redundantly with lin-44/wnt in various
developmental events (Mizumoto and Shen, 2013; Yamamoto et al., 2011). We therefore tested

if egl-20/wnt can replace the function of lin-44 in PDB neurite pruning. Interestingly, expression
of egl-20 under the lin-44 promoter did not rescue the PDB neurite pruning defects of the lin-44
null mutant animals, suggesting the functional divergence between lin-44 and egl-20 in neurite
pruning (Figures 4A and 4B). Consistently, PDB structure is largely unaffected in the mutants
of egl-20(n585) and its receptors mig-1/fz and cam-1/Ryk (Figure 2E and data not shown)
(Eisenmann, 2005; Mizumoto and Shen, 2013). Taken together, we conclude that LIN-44 is a
unique instructive cue for PDB neurite pruning.

Membrane-tethered LIN-44 is sufficient to instruct PDB neurite pruning
Genetic experiments such as ectopic expression or overexpression of Wnts, and direct
visualization of the Wnt protein has revealed the critical roles of gradient distribution of LIN-44
and EGL-20 in C. elegans (Coudreuse, 2006; Klassen and Shen, 2007; Maro et al., 2009;
Mizumoto and Shen, 2013; Pani and Goldstein, 2018). While data from the above experiments
are consistent with the idea that lin-44/wnt instructs asymmetric neurite pruning in PDB, several
observations cannot be explained by the instructive role of LIN-44 as a gradient. First, we did not
observe ectopic pruning of the anterior neurite when lin-44/wnt was expressed anteriorly from
the egl-20 promoter (data not shown), suggesting that anterior expression of lin-44 is not
sufficient to induce anterior neurite pruning in PDB. Second, during PDB development, both
growing anterior and pruning posterior neurites are located close to the lin-44-expressing hyp10
cell (Figure 2B). If lin-44/wnt functions as a gradient pruning cue, how can the anterior neurite
escape from the pruning signal? One possible explanation is that PDB neurites require high and
locally concentrated LIN-44/Wnt to induce pruning rather than responding to the gradient
distribution of LIN-44. In this case, the cells expressing Pegl-20::lin-44 are too far away from

the anterior neurite of PDB. Furthermore, a close examination of the spatial relationship between
PDB neurites and the lin-44-expressing cells suggests that the GFP signal from the PDB
posterior neurite tip overlaps with the BFP signal from hyp10 while there is a gap between the
anterior neurite tip and hyp10 (Figure 2B). This raises one possibility that PDB neurites need to
be in very close proximity, if not in contact, with the LIN-44-expressing cells to activate the
pruning mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of the membrane-tethered Wnt
originally developed in Drosophila (Zecca et al., 1996). In Drosophila, the fusion construct of
the type-II transmembrane protein Neurotactin (Nrt) and Wingless/Wnt (Nrt-Wg) is used to
characterize the gradient-independent role of Wingless/Wnt (Alexandre et al., 2014; BaenaLopez et al., 2009). Importantly, the mutant fly in which endogenous Wg was replaced with NrtWg was viable with no major morphological defects (Alexandre et al., 2014). They also showed
that the Nrt-Wg largely abrogated the gradient distribution of Wingless. These observations
suggest that the gradient distribution of Wnt is not essential for normal development. We
generated the mutant animal with membrane-tethered lin-44 by inserting the codon-optimized
Neurotactin (Nrt) and BFP into the endogenous lin-44 locus by CRISPR/Cas9 (miz56[nrt-bfplin-44]) (Figure 5A). The BFP signal was observed on the membrane of the tail hypodermal
cells including hyp10, suggesting that NRT-BFP-LIN-44 fusion proteins are localized on the
surface of the lin-44-expressing cells (Figure 5B). The brighter BFP signal was observed at the
interface between the hypodermal cells, likely because the signal comes from both hypodermal
cells. Interestingly, we observed significant proportions of the nrt-bfp-lin-44 animals have
normal PDB structures at the L4 stage (data not shown). Specifically, unlike lin-44 null
mutants, we observed normal pruning of the posterior neurites in nrt-bfp-lin-44 animals (65.6%,

n=32) comparable to wildtype (Figures 5C-5E). This indicates that the membrane-tethered LIN44 is sufficient to induce normal neurite pruning in PDB.
In addition to the traditional model of Wnt gradient formation by simple secretion and
chemical diffusion, recent works have started to reveal the alternative modes of Wnt transport
via cytonemes and extracellular vesicles (EVs) (Gross et al., 2012; Routledge and Scholpp, 2019;
Saha et al., 2016; Stanganello et al., 2015). It is therefore possible that the membrane-tethered
Wnt is still capable of making a gradient and reach the target cells from distant via these
structures. To test if NRT-BFP-LIN-44 abolished the gradient distribution of LIN-44, we
examined the phenotypes of two motor neurons (DA9 and DD6) that are known to be regulated
by the LIN-44/Wnt gradient signal. The DA9 neuron is a cholinergic motor neuron whose cell
body resides in the preanal ganglion. DA9 axon initially extends posteriorly along the ventral
nerve cord and through commissure join the dorsal nerve cord where it then extends anteriorly to
form en passant synapses onto dorsal body wall muscles. Previous works have shown that LIN44/Wnt gradient from the tail hypodermal cells inhibits synapse formation in the posterior axonal
region of DA9, creating the synapse-free (or asynaptic) axonal domain (Figures 6A and 6D)
(Klassen and Shen, 2007). In the lin-44 null mutants, the ectopic synapse formation occurs in the
dorsal posterior axonal domain of DA9 (Figures 6B and 6D). LIN-17::mCherry is localized
within the asynaptic posterior axonal domain in a lin-44-dependent manner (Figures 6A and 6B,
middle panels). Overexpression of lin-44 from the egl-20 promoter creates larger asynaptic
domain by displacing DA9 synapses more anteriorly, suggesting the LIN-44 gradient determines
the length of the asynaptic domain (Klassen and Shen, 2007). Similarly, the termination of the
axonal outgrowth of the DD6 GABAergic motor neuron in the dorsal nerve cord is dependent on
the LIN-44 gradient (Maro et al., 2009). In wildtype, the DD6 axon terminates before it reaches

the rectum region (Figures 6E and 6F). In lin-44 null mutants, it overextends beyond the rectum
(Figures 6E and 6F). Overexpression of lin-44 from the lin-44 or egl-20 promoters caused
premature termination of the DD6 axon outgrowth (Maro et al., 2009). These two lin-44dependent phenomena were severely disrupted in nrt-bfp-lin-44 animals and were
indistinguishable from those in lin-44 null mutants (Figures 6C-6F). These results strongly
suggest that membrane-tethered LIN-44 severely compromised the gradient-dependent function
of LIN-44. These results are consistent with the idea that the pruning of the PDB posterior
neurites does not depend on the LIN-44 gradient but on the local and high concentration of LIN44 directly exposed by the lin-44-expressing cells.

lin-44/wnt instructs asymmetric localization of LIN-17/Fz and DSH-1/Dsh to the pruning
neurites
Wnt ligands activate intracellular signaling cascade by inducing the clustering of the
receptors. Consistently, Frizzled receptors are localized to the site of action in Wnt-dependent
manners. For example, LIN-17/Fz is localized asymmetrically on the cell cortex during
asymmetric cell division, to the posterior neurite of the PLM mechanosensory neuron during
neuronal polarization, and to the posterior asynaptic axonal domain to inhibit presynaptic
assembly (Goldstein et al., 2006; Hilliard and Bargmann, 2006; Klassen and Shen, 2007). We
therefore examined the subcellular localization of the LIN-17::GFP fusion protein during PDB
posterior neurite pruning. We observed significantly higher accumulation of LIN-17::GFP
puncta at the tip of the posterior neurites compared with those at the anterior neurite at L2 stage
(Figures 7A and 7D). The asymmetric LIN-17::GFP localization at the posterior neurites is
dependent on lin-44/wnt: we did not observe significant LIN-17::GFP puncta in the lin-44 null

mutant animals (Figures 7B and 7D). In contrast, LIN-17::GFP puncta were accumulated at the
posterior neurites of PDB in the nrt-bfp-lin-44 animals (Figures 7C and 7D). This is consistent
with no obvious pruning defects in the nrt-bfp-lin-44 animals. We note that the LIN-17::GFP
puncta observed in the ventral neurite of wildtype animals were completely absent in the nrt-bfplin-44 animals (Figures 7A and 7C). These LIN-17::GFP puncta might be associated with the
gradient-dependent function of lin-44 such as neuronal polarization and guidance.
Dishevelled (Dsh/Dvl) proteins are the intracellular signaling components of both
canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling and are known to co-localize with active Frizzled
receptors (Wallingford and Habas, 2005). There are three Dishevelled genes in C. elegans (dsh-1,
dsh-2 and mig-5). Similar to Frizzled receptors, Dsh proteins are often localized asymmetrically
within the cells in Wnt-dependent manners (Heppert et al., 2018; Klassen and Shen, 2007;
Mizumoto and Sawa, 2007; Walston et al., 2004). We did not observe significant pruning defects
in dsh-1 and mig-5 single mutant animals, likely due to their functional redundancy (data not
shown). Nevertheless, DSH-1/Dsh::GFP puncta were localized in the posterior neurites in the
wildtype and nrt-bfp-lin-44 but not in the lin-44 null animals (Supplemental Figures 3A, 3B,
3D and 3E). Consistent with the idea that Dsh proteins are recruited to the active Frizzled
receptors, DSH-1 localization at the posterior neurites was dependent on the LIN-17/Fz receptor
(Supplemental Figures 3C and 3E). Taken these results together, we concluded that the locally
restricted Wnt instructs asymmetric neurite pruning via recruiting Frizzled receptor and
Dishevelled proteins to the pruning neurites (Figure 8).

Discussion
Developmental neurite pruning plays crucial roles in shaping functional neurocircuit, yet
not much is known about the signaling cues that instruct stereotyped neurite pruning during
neuronal development. Here, we found that Wnt signal from the hypodermal cells instructs
stereotyped neurite pruning in the PDB cholinergic motorneuron in C. elegans. Asymmetric Wnt
signal from the posterior hypodermal cells specifically induces pruning of the posterior neurite to
sculpt the V-shape projection pattern of the PDB neurite. The unique structure of PDB and its
topographic arrangement relative to the signaling cues allowed us to uncover the unique function
of gradient-independent Wnt signaling in neurite pruning.

Wnt signaling and neurite pruning
There have only been a handful of studies elucidating the roles of Wnt signaling in
neurite pruning despite its critical roles in neuronal development and function. In C. elegans, two
Wnts, CWN-1 and CWN-2, act through CAM-1/Ryk (receptor tyrosine kinase) to protect neurite
from the mbr-1-mediated pruning in the AIM interneurons: the pruning defect in AIMs of mbr-1
mutants is suppressed by mutations in cam-1, while overexpression of cam-1 in AIMs inhibits
neurite pruning (Hayashi et al., 2009). These data indicate that, in contrast to LIN-44/Wnt which
instructs neurite pruning in PDB, CWN-1/2 inhibit neurite pruning in AIMs. It is possible that
distinct receptors expressed in AIM and PDB neurons underlie the opposite effect of Wnt
signaling on neurite pruning between them. Indeed, several studies have shown that cam-1/Ror
and lin-17/fz function antagonistically (Goh et al., 2012; Kidd et al., 2015). The interesting
analogy to our study has been observed in Drosophila contralaterally-projecting serotoninimmunoreactive deuterocerebral interneurons (CSDns) (Singh et al., 2010). CSDns undergo

extensive dendritic remodeling during metamorphosis. The loss of Wingless and Wnt5 impairs
the pruning of the transient dendritic branches of CSDn. Interestingly, the pruning of the CSDn
dendrites is an activity-dependent process and requires their upstream neurons. Wnt signaling
functions downstream of the neuronal activity to eliminate dendrites with no synaptic inputs
from the upstream neurons. While it remains to be determined whether Wnt signaling plays an
instructive or a permissive role in CSDn dendrite pruning, these observations along with our
present study show conserved role of Wnt signaling as a pruning cue.
Wnt and Frizzled receptors control distinct downstream signaling cascades (Wnt-βcatenin; Wnt-PCP; Wnt-Ca2+) in context-dependent manners. We have examined potential
downstream signaling components such as bar-1/β-catenin, fmi-1/flamingo, vang-1/Van Gogh
but none of them showed significant neurite pruning defects (Figure 2E). Further candidate and
forward genetic screenings will provide the mechanistic insights into the Wnt-dependent neurite
pruning.

Gradient-independent Wnt signaling
The normal development of Drosophila whose endogenous wingless is replaced with the
membrane-tethered Wingless (nrt-wg) implies that gradient-independent or contact-dependent
Wnt signaling is largely sufficient for the normal tissue patterning during development
(Alexandre et al., 2014). The authors also noted the importance of the gradient signal of
Wingless since the nrt-wg fly showed delayed development and reduced fitness. Consistently,
recent works revealed the critical requirement of secretion and diffusion of Wingless for renal
tube patterning and intestinal compartmentalization in Drosophila (Beaven and Denholm, 2018;
Tian et al., 2019).

In this study, we showed that the membrane-tethered LIN-44 is sufficient for the PDB
neurite pruning but not for DD6 axon termination and DA9 synapse patterning. How can cells
distinguish gradient-dependent and independent Wnt signaling? One possible explanation is that
each Wnt-dependent process requires a distinct threshold of the Wnt concentration to activate the
signaling cascade. The processes that are gradient-dependent might require lower Wnt
concentration to execute the process than the gradient-independent process. Alternatively, it is
also possible that the gradient-independent or contact-dependent processes require
transmembrane co-factors that mediate contact-dependent Wnt signaling. sdn-1/syndecan was
one such candidate as it has been shown that sdn-1 is required for the Wnt-dependent spindle
orientation in early embryonic development (Dejima et al., 2014), and sdn-1 mutants exhibit
PDB structure defects similar to lin-44/wnt (Saied-Santiago et al., 2017). However, we did not
observe significant pruning defects in PDB of sdn-1 mutants (data not shown). Further candidate
and forward genetic screenings will reveal novel factors that are specifically required for the
contact-dependent Wnt signaling.
The membrane-tethered LIN-44/Wnt (Nrt-LIN-44) efficiently induced posterior neurite
pruning, suggesting the contact with Wnt-expressing cells rather than the gradient distribution of
LIN-44 triggers the PDB neurite pruning. The contact-dependent neurite pruning model can
explain why the anterior neurite, which is also located in close proximity to the lin-44-expressing
cells, can ignore the LIN-44/Wnt pruning cue. It also explains how the PDB neurite can initially
grow posteriorly from its cell body toward the source of pruning cue (LIN-44-expressing cells).
On the other hand, we do not exclude the possibility that the anterior neurite responds to the
attractive guidance cues from the anterior cells so that it is protected from the Wnt-dependent
neurite pruning. We have tested several candidates including sax-7/Neurofascin, which guides

and stabilizes the dendritic arbor structure of the PVD sensory neuron (Dong et al., 2013), unc129/TGFβ which is a neurite attractant expressed from the postsynaptic dorsal body wall
muscles (Colavita, 1998), unc-6/Netrin that acts as an axon attractant through unc-40/DCC
receptor (Chan et al., 1996), and cam-1/Ryk which acts downstream of Wnt to protect neurites
from pruning (Hayashi et al., 2009), but none of them showed ectopic pruning of the anterior
neurites. Future studies will be necessary to determine the threshold of Wnt concentration to
induce neurite pruning as well as potential mechanisms that protect anterior neurite from
pruning.

Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). lin-17 cDNA clone was obtained from the
plasmid used in the previous work (Mizumoto and Shen, 2013).
Pkal-1::zf1-GFPnovo2-caax plasmid The 3.7kb fragment of kal-1 promoter was amplified from
N2 genomic DNA using Phusion high fidelity enzyme (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) and
cloned into the SphI and AscI sites of the pSM-GFPnovo2 vector (Hendi and Mizumoto, 2018).
111bp sequence of the ZF1 zinc finger domain from pie-1 and 51bp sequence of the CAAX
sequence from human KRas were inserted into the 5’ and 3’ of GFPnovo2 sequence,
respectively, using Gibson assembly method (Armenti et al., 2014; Gibson et al., 2009). The
intestinal GFP signal was reduced by expressing zif-1 in the intestine under the pha-6 promoter
to degrade ZF1-GFPnovo2::CAAX.
Neurotactin-BFP-lin-44 repair plasmid The plasmid containing a codon-optimized neurotactin
cDNA with 2xHA tag was obtained from GeneArt (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA). C. elegans
codon-optimized BFP with three synthetic introns was inserted into the 3’ end of the
Neurotactin-2xHA sequence to generate Neurotactin-2xHA-BFP construct. 700bp of the 5’
homology arm of the lin-44 promoter region, Neurotactin-2xHA-BFP (5’ portion until middle of
intron 1), BFP (3’ portion from intron 1), 700bp of the 3’ homology arm spanning lin-44 coding
region are cloned into the SacII and NotI sites of a dual-marker selection cassette (loxP + Pmyo2::GFP::unc-54 3′UTR + Prps-27::neoR::unc-54 3′UTR + loxP vector) (Au et al., 2019; Gibson

CRISPR
The repair template plasmid, two lin-44 sgRNA plasmids and a Cas9 plasmid (Addgene#
46168) (Friedland et al., 2013) were co-injected into young adults. The candidate genome-edited
animals were screened based on G418 resistance and uniform expression of Pmyo-2::GFP in the
pharynx as described previously (Au et al., 2019). The selection cassette was excised by
injecting Cre recombinase plasmid (pDD104, Addgene #47551). Excision of the selection
cassette, which was inserted within the first intron of BFP, reconstituted Neurotactin-2xHA-BFPlin-44. The junctions between neurotactin and BFP as well as BFP and lin-44 coding sequence
were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

Semi-synchronization of C. elegans
Eggs at various stages were collected by bleaching the gravid adults with a bleaching
solution (2.5% sodium hypochlorite and 0.5N Sodium Chloride) for 5 min. The eggs were
washed twice with M9 buffer and seeded onto an NGM plate. For observing the pruning event,
the animal was rescued from the slide after the first imaging at the L2 stage (approximately 26
hours after seeding eggs onto the NGM plates) and placed it in an individual NGM plate to
resume the development for 24 hours before re-imaging at early L4 stages.

Confocal microscopy
Images of fluorescently tagged fusion proteins were captured in live C. elegans using a
Zeiss LSM800 Airyscan confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany). Worms were immobilized
on 2% agarose pad using a mixture of 7.5 mM levamisole (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.225M BDM

(2,3-butanedione monoxime) (Sigma-Aldrich). Images were analyzed with Zen software (Carl
Zeiss) or Image J (NIH, USA).
For time-lapse imaging, animals were mounted onto 5% agarose pads and immobilized
using 0.5µl of 0.10 µmpolystyrene latex microsphere (Alfa Aesar # 427124Y). The coverslip
was sealed with Vaseline (Vaseline® Jelly Original), to avoid dehydration of the animals and
agarose pad during imaging.

Statistics
Data were processed using Prism7 (GraphPad Software, USA). We applied the Chisquare test (with Yates’ continuity corrected) for comparison between two binary data groups,
and one-way ANOVA method for comparison among more than three parallel groups with
multiple plotting points. Data were plotted with error bars representing standard errors of the
mean (SEM). *, ** and *** represent P-value <0.05, <0.01 and <0.001 respectively. Sample
numbers were pre-determined before conducting statistical analyses.
