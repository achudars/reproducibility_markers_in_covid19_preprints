Abstract
Cell-free tumour-derived DNA (ctDNA) allows non-invasive monitoring of cancers
but its utility in renal cell cancer (RCC) has not been established. Here, untargeted
and targeted sequencing methods, applied to two independent cohorts of renal tumour
patients (n=90), were used to determine ctDNA content in plasma and urine. Our data
revealed lower plasma ctDNA levels in RCC relative to other cancers, with untargeted
detection of ~33%. A sensitive personalised approach, applied to plasma and urine
from select patients improved detection to ~50%, including in patients with earlystage and even benign lesions.

A machine-learning based model predicted detection, potentially offering a means of
triaging samples for personalised analysis. In addition, with limited data we observed
that plasma, and for the first time, urine ctDNA may better represent tumour
heterogeneity than tissue biopsy. Furthermore, longitudinal sampling of >200 plasma
samples revealed that ctDNA can track disease course. Additional datasets will be
required to validate these findings.

Overall, our data highlight RCC as a ctDNA-low malignancy, but indicate potential
clinical utility provided improvement in detection approaches.

Introduction
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most lethal urological malignancy with 50% of
patients that develop the disease dying from it[1]. Clinical management challenges
include: early diagnosis; differentiation of histological subtypes, i.e. chromophobe
RCC (chRCC) from clear cell RCC (ccRCC) or benign oncocytoma; identification of
patients with minimal residual disease following intended curative nephrectomy
which will allow improved stratification of patients for adjuvant therapy trials; and
predicting and tracking of response to targeted therapies. RCC has well-established
pathological and genetic heterogeneity[2], which confounds development of
personalised medicine[3]. Moreover, ccRCC exhibits a broad range of metastatic
phenotypes[4] highlighting the need for longitudinal sampling. Due to the invasive
nature of the procedure and failure to capture genetic heterogeneity, tissue biopsies
potentially inadequately inform treatment decisions[5]. A ‘liquid biopsy’, providing an
admixture of the entire tumour burden of a patient, may offer a non-invasive
alternative to traditional tumour sampling techniques. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA), which
in patients with cancer contains cell-free tumour derived DNA (ctDNA), represent
one such promising liquid biopsy strategy[6-8].

Despite showing great promise in various cancers[6], there is little and often
contradictory data of ctDNA as a tool in RCC in locally advanced and metastatic
RCC[6, 9-11]. As such, there remains an unmet need for the characterisation of the
levels, and potential clinical utility, of ctDNA in renal cancers of differing stage and
subtype. Furthermore, whilst evidence suggests ctDNA in the urine can be
informative in urological cancers[12, 13], no previous study has assessed the presence of
ctDNA in the urine of RCC patients. Here we aimed to determine the presence, levels,

Results
Untargeted analysis of ctDNA in plasma and urine from patients with renal
tumours
We applied a combination of rapid and cost-effective untargeted approaches, albeit
with limited sensitivity, to establish a first measure of ctDNA presence and levels in
patients with benign through to metastatic disease (n=90 patients from the
DIAMOND and MonReC studies (Fig. 1A-C and table S1-S2). First, we assessed
overall ctDNA levels using the trimmed Median Absolute Deviation (tMAD) score
calculated from shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS)[14] of plasma from 47
DIAMOND patients (Fig. 1B). As this method is dependent on the presence of
somatic copy number alterations (SCNA), we applied sWGS/tMAD to matched
tumour tissue, available from 28 of 47 patients (59.6%). All had SCNA (Fig. S1),
suggesting that SCNA are a valid ctDNA target in patients. However, in plasma we
detected SCNA in only 3 of 47 (6.4%) patient samples (Fig. 2A, one patient with
metastatic ccRCC and 2 with non-metastatic chRCCs).

Next, we employed in-silico selection of sequence reads within particular DNA
fragment size ranges, an approach demonstrated to enrich for mutant signal in
plasma[14, 15]. After selection of reads between 90-150bp, 41/47 plasma samples from
DIAMOND met the criteria for evaluation by tMAD analysis (>2 million reads) (Fig.
S2A). On average, tMAD scores increased 2.2-fold (range 1.25-4.83) and led to
ctDNA detection in 8 additional patients (Fig. 2A) including a patient with an
oncocytoma (Fig. S3A). Thus, in total we detected plasma ctDNA in 11/47 (23.4%)
DIAMOND patients.

The MonReC cohort consisted primarily of metastatic patients (two non-metastatic),
most with their primary tumour removed (35/43 patients) (Fig. 1C). Samples were
initially analysed with untargeted methods, mFAST-SeqS[16] and sWGS (ichorCNA
tumour fraction). A mFAST-SeqS z-score of ≥3 indicates tumour fractions of >3-10%
(depending on the number and amplitude of SCNA)[17]. At baseline, z-scores ranged
from -0.6-3.7 (median=0.7) with only 2/43 patients (4.7%) surpassing the detection
threshold. The ichorCNA algorithm[18] revealed six further patients with detected
ctDNA (8/43=18.6%; Fig. 2B) with tumour fractions up to 0.17 (median 0.07, range
0.04-0.17). As above, in-silico size selection further improved the ichorCNA
detection rate to 14/43 (32%) (Fig. 2B, Fig. S4 and 5). On average, tumour fraction
from ctDNA positive samples increased 2.2-fold (range 0.9-5.7) to a median of 0.08
(range 0.04-0.23).

As sampling of biofluids collected in close proximity to the tumour site may improve
detection[13, 19], we analysed urine supernatant (USN) samples from 21 DIAMOND
cohort patients. Applying tMAD to urine for the first time (Fig. S2B), ctDNA was
detected in 4 patients (19.0%) (Fig. 2C), including three patients with ccRCC and a
patient with oncocytoma (not detected in plasma, Fig. S3B). In addition to USN, we
had access to urine cell pellet (UCP) DNA for these 21 patients. UCP DNA is not
cell-free but allows non-invasive detection of tumour DNA[13, 20]. UCP tMAD analysis
revealed 3/20 (15%) patients with detected ctDNA, including one with localised
ccRCC, the largest tumour of the cohort with a diameter of 23cm. Comparison of
plasma, USN and UCP data did not reveal a clear relationship in detection amongst
these compartments (Fig. 2C), confirming previous observations in bladder cancer[13,
21]

. Considering only those patients for which we had access to plasma and urine, the

detection rate increased to 9/21 (42.9%). Of note, only one patient (5842, table S1)
had detected ctDNA in both plasma and urine.

Overall, untargeted sequencing methods employed here suggested low ctDNA
detection rates in plasma and/or urine of patients with renal tumours (16/47, 34% in
DIAMOND, 14/43, 33% in MonReC). Even in metastatic disease, the detection rate
was only 34% (MonReC 13/41, DIAMOND 3/6). Comparison of plasma ctDNA
levels, as quantified by tMAD, mFAST-SeqS and ichorCNA, against other cancer
types confirmed that ctDNA levels are lower in renal tumours (Fig. 2D&E, Fig.
S5C). Parallel analysis of urine (USN and UCP) also revealed low detection rates.
ctDNA was detected in either fluid in patients with a range of tumour subtypes
including, unexpectedly, patients with benign oncocytoma. Given these low detection
rates, we hypothesised that techniques with greater sensitivity were required to
quantify ctDNA in renal tumours.

Targeted analysis of ctDNA yields improved detection rates
For DIAMOND patients, INtegration of VAriant Reads – TAilored PAnel Sequencing
(INVAR-TAPAS) was used, an approach demonstrated to detect plasma ctDNA to
parts per million[22] (Fig. S6). This method relies on a priori knowledge of tumour
specific mutations and thus, for 29 DIAMOND patients, we carried out whole exome
sequencing (WES) of matched tumour tissue and buffy coat (Fig. S7). We observed
extensive disease heterogeneity as previously described[2, 4] (Fig. S8). Patient-specific
mutations of key RCC genes are listed in table S4. A personalised capture panel was
designed targeting all patient specific SNV from tissue WES as well as the coding
regions of 109 genes commonly mutated in renal tumours (table S5). Based on the

requirements of the INVAR algorithm, seven plasma samples (7/29, 24.1%) had
insufficient reads, resulting in limited ability to detect ctDNA, and were thus excluded
as technical failures (Fig. S7A & 9A).

In the 22 remaining plasma samples, ctDNA was detected in 12 (54.5%) (Fig. 3A).
Ten of these (83.3%) were ccRCC samples, including three detected by tMAD
analysis of sWGS data. It is noteworthy that 9 of these patients had the largest
evaluable ccRCC tumours in the cohort (7.4cm - 23cm). However, ctDNA was also
detected in a patient with a small (2.8cm) ccRCC with global mutant allele fraction,
gmAF=6.4x10-5. Of the remaining patients with detected ctDNA, one had a small
chRCC (2cm) with gmAF 1.8x10-4, and the other had a benign oncocytoma (3.9cm)
with gmAF of 2.7x10-4. Assessment of all tumour subtypes revealed a significant
(p=0.033, Mann Whitney’s U test) correlation between ctDNA detection and tumour
size (Fig. 3E, Fig. S10A). Similarly, ctDNA detection was more likely in patients
with locally advanced RCC denoted by renal vein or inferior vena cava tumour
thrombus (p<0.05 for detection by INVAR-TAPAS +/- tMAD, Fisher’s exact test;
Fig. 3F, Fig. S11A-B). Conversely, Ki-67 assessed cellular proliferation rate did not
correlate with detection (Fig. S11C-E).

For the first time we applied INVAR-TAPAS to USN from 20 patients. As in plasma,
six samples (30%) had insufficient sequence reads and were excluded as technical
fails. We detected ctDNA in USN of 7/14 patient samples (50%) (Fig. 3B; ccRCC
n=5, chRCC n=1, oncocytoma n=1). Two of these patients had detected urine ctDNA
by tMAD analysis, whilst four had detected ctDNA in plasma (by INVAR-TAPAS or
tMAD). Of note, the oncocytoma patient (histology confirmed; Fig. S12) had ctDNA

detected in plasma (gmAF USN 5.7x10-5 vs plasma 2.7x10-4). In contrast to plasma,
there was no correlation between USN ctDNA detection and lesion size across all
patients (Fig. S10B), venous tumour thrombus invasion (Fig. 1B, Fig. 3F, Fig. S11AB) or proliferation rate (Fig. S11C). There was no correlation between the global
ctDNA mAF in plasma and urine (Spearman’s rho = 0.28, p=0.3; Fig. 3C), though in
the majority of patients, levels proved too low for accurate quantification of tumour
fraction.

For metastatic RCC patients recruited to MonReC, no tumour tissue was available and
so a de novo mutation calling approach was applied to plasma DNA. A gene panel
targeting ten significantly mutated genes in renal cancers (BAP1, KDM5C, MET,
MTOR, PBRM1, PIK3CA, PTEN, SETD2, TP53, VHL)[23] was used with a maximal
achievable sensitivity of 5x10-3 mAF. Based on existing data, one would expect a
somatic mutation to be present in >80% of metastatic ccRCC patients in at least one
of these gene[24]. However, ctDNA was detected in only 8/43 (18.6%) baseline
samples (Fig. 3D, table S1, S6). mAF ranged from 3.5x10-2 - 0.18 with an average of
8.3x10-2. Except for patient K42 (Fig. 1C), SCNA were detected in all of these
samples after size selection. In four patients, two or more mutations were identified
and SETD2 was the most frequently mutated gene in the cohort with a mutation being
observed in 4 of the 8 mutation positive patients (50%). KDM5C and VHL were the
next most frequently mutated genes with mutations being observed in 2/8 (25%) in
both instances (Fig. 1C).

ctDNA detection across all patient samples are summarised in Fig. 4 and Fig. S13.
Targeted analysis with a personalised approach (INVAR-TAPAS) improved ctDNA

detection over untargeted analysis. Overall (targeted and untargeted data), 24 of 47
(51.5%) DIAMOND patients had detected ctDNA, whether in plasma or urine,
though not all patient samples had the most sensitive approach applied to them or had
both plasma and urine available. Of those that did, 11/13 (84.6%) patients had ctDNA
detected. Of note, only one patient had ctDNA detected in both plasma and urine by
both untargeted and targeted methods. For the MonReC cohort the overall ctDNA
detection rate of 34.5% was lower than for DIAMOND, most likely due to the use of
less sensitive de novo methods. Taken together, ctDNA detection in plasma and urine
is challenging in patients with renal tumours, with tumour size (Fig. 3E) and renal
vein or inferior vena cava tumour thrombus locally advanced disease (Fig. 3F) being
the single greatest factors contributing to detection (as assessed in DIAMOND, Fig.
S11A-B).

Supervised machine learning to predict patients with sufficient ctDNA for detection
Our data demonstrate that there is great interpatient variability of ctDNA detection in
plasma and urine of patients with RCC. In order to triage patient samples likely to
have sufficiently high ctDNA levels for subsequent analysis by more expensive and
time-consuming targeted methods we applied our recently developed random forest
(RF) disease classification model[14] to plasma sWGS data of DIAMOND patients.
Used as originally intended, the RF model enables classification of plasma DNA
samples into “normal” and “cancer” based on fragmentation features of cfDNA (Fig.
S14A). Here we compared the output of the model with the results of targeted
analysis and found that amongst those samples surpassing a >50% probability of
ctDNA detection threshold, 75% (9/12) had detected ctDNA in plasma by INVARTAPAS (Fig. S14B) and 91.7% (11/12) had detected ctDNA in plasma and/or urine

by INVAR-TAPAS and/or tMAD. Conversely, only 36.4% (4/11) of plasma samples
with <50% probability of ctDNA detection by the RF model, had ctDNA detected in
any fluid by any method (p=9.4x10-3 Fisher’s exact test; Fig. 5). This data suggests
that fragmentation features may predict which RCC patients are likely to have
sufficient ctDNA (in plasma or urine) for targeted sequencing by other, more
sensitive, methods.

Longitudinal analysis of ctDNA in renal tumours
An aim of the MonReC study was to investigate the potential of plasma ctDNA to
monitor treatment response in metastatic RCC, as such we had access to longitudinal
plasma samples for 37/43 (86%) MonReC patients. During a median follow-up period
of 6 months (range 0.4-19.2) serial plasma samples (median 5, range 2-21) were
collected before and during treatment. mFAST-SeqS was used as an initial measure of
tumour content[16, 25]. For all samples the median genome-wide z-score was 1.0 (range
-0.9 - 58.0), and an elevated z-score was observed in 19/252 samples (7.5%) from 9
patients. In those samples SCNA profiling revealed expected RCC aberrations,
including 3p loss. Using a linear mixed model with a random intercept at the patient
level, we found significant differences between baseline and treatment (Wald test,
p<0.001), and progression (Wald test, p=0.0294) (Fig. S15). Longitudinal mutation
analysis was performed in 14 patients. Of those 6 patients (K18, K20, K23, K27, K39,
K42) had mutations called at baseline (Fig 6A-C, Fig. S16). Due to low detection
rates at baseline, we analysed additional samples whose collection coincided with
clinical progression, and identified three further patients (K11, K21, K35) with
detected ctDNA. Moreover, ichorCNA was applied to available follow-up samples of
5 patients (K08, K13, K19, K40, K44) with detected ctDNA at baseline (table S7).

For most patients, ctDNA levels assessed either by the QIASeq panel or ichorCNA
were elevated at treatment initiation but decreased with response (Fig. 6B, Fig. S16AG). At progression, or when a treatment response was not gained, ctDNA increased or
remained elevated (Fig. 6C, Fig. S16A-G). For example, patient (K39) showed high
levels of tumour DNA (>0.1 mAF) at all available time points and died 2.8 months
after the first blood draw, mirroring the rapidly progressing disease (Fig. 6C).

We obtained longitudinal plasma and urine from two DIAMOND patients
(highlighted in Fig. 4, Fig. S17). Data are summarised in Fig. S18-20. ctDNA levels
largely fluctuated in accordance with clinical response as determined by standard
imaging. Of note, the data highlighted that the detection of ctDNA (9.5x10-4 gmAF)
53 days after radical nephrectomy pre-empted CT scan detection of minimal residual
disease 82 days after surgery (Fig. 6D, Fig. S17).

Representation of tumour heterogeneity in plasma and urine
For all but two DIAMOND patients, the low ctDNA levels precluded meaningful
assessment of representation of tumour heterogeneity in fluids samples. For
DIAMOND patient 5842 we carried out WES of 10 spatially distinct tumour biopsies
obtained after nephrectomy (Fig. S21), identifying somatic mutations with varying
apparent clonality. We compared the number of regions a mutation was called in,
against the mAF of that mutation in plasma, urine and tissue (Fig. 6E, fig. S22) and
observed an incrementally rising mAF as more tumour regions were considered
(Wilcoxon T-test p<0.05). We assessed whether private mutations from each tumour
region were represented in plasma and USN and found that both overcame this
apparent heterogeneity with 90% and 100% of regions represented by at least one

mutation in plasma and urine respectively (Fig. 6F and Fig. S23). There was no
evidence of one or more tumour regions having greater representation in fluids than
others (Fig. S24). These data confirm that plasma ctDNA can overcome tumour
heterogeneity[26] and, for the first time, demonstrates that USN ctDNA is capable of
the same (Fig. 6F). The ctDNA mAF varied between plasma and urine (mean mAF of
detected mutations = 2.2x10-2 vs 1.2x10-2 respectively), with differing representation
of likely driver genes including VHL
(ENST00000256474.2:c.333_340+1delCTACCGAGG) (Fig. S25). In patient 5634,
plasma showed a similar ability to overcome heterogeneity with private clusters of
mutations all represented in baseline plasma (Fig. S26).

Discussion
Here we present the most comprehensive assessment of ctDNA in renal tumour
patients to date, using state-of-the-art approaches applied to tissue and liquid biopsy
samples from two independent, prospective clinical cohorts. These cohorts were
complementary, with DIAMOND representing patients with the full range of renal
tumours from benign to locally advanced and metastatic patients. MonReC evaluated
metastatic RCC patients treated with multiple systemic therapies and longitudinal
follow-up/biosampling allowing the predictive ability of ctDNA to be assessed. We
sought to take a bottom-up approach to determine if inexpensive, untargeted liquid
biopsy approaches could be applied to RCC, as they have been successfully employed
in breast[27], colorectal[28] and prostate cancer[29]. These methods enabled ctDNA
detection in only a third of patients with RCC. Even in metastatic patients these
methods achieved only moderate detection rates indicating generally low levels of
tumour-derived DNA. Personalised high-resolution methods, which are more
expensive, were used with incremental success.

RCC is often an aggressive, angiogenesis-driven malignancy, in a vascular organ with
frequent cellular necrosis. As such it is surprising that we observed such low ctDNA
levels. Our data suggest that the probability of detecting ctDNA rises with increasing
size of the primary tumour. Furthermore, amongst patients with locally advanced
tumour growth, such as growth of a tumour thrombus into the renal vein or inferior
vena cava, ctDNA detection in plasma, but not urine, was significantly more frequent.
In contrast, tumour proliferation rate did not predict ctDNA detection as observed in
patient derived xenograft models[30] and lung cancer[31]. Surprisingly ctDNA detection
was also limited to approximately a third of patients with metastatic disease from the

MonReC cohort, albeit with substantially higher tumour fractions than observed in
DIAMOND.

There is little published data characterising ctDNA levels in RCC. Initial studies
suggested low detection rates and/or levels of ctDNA in locally advanced and
metastatic RCC[6, 9, 10]. More recently targeted sequencing detected ctDNA in 30% of
53 RCC patients[11]. Conversely, Pal and colleagues (2017a) detected ctDNA in
78.6% of 200 metastatic patients using the Guardant360 plasma assay (Guardant
Health), though with a median of one genomic alteration per sample[32]. The same
authors detected ctDNA in a further 18/34 (53%) metastatic RCC patients, and, as
echoed by our data, observed a possible correlation between detection and lesion
diameter[33]. Likely reasons for the lower detection rate amongst metastatic patients in
the MonReC cohort include our use of a smaller gene panel which has a detection
limit of 5.0x10-3 as compared to 2.0x10-4 for Guardant360. Moreover, their study
analysed more than 70 RCC associated genes, including EGFR, NF1 and ARID1A,
many of which were not included in our assay. Of note, neither of these two studies
reported the range of detected mAFs, meaning that a direct comparison with our data
was not possible. Nevertheless, the use of larger gene panels, or personalized assays
such as INVAR-TAPAS, are likely to increase ctDNA detection rates. Considered
with our data, it is clear that a consensus concerning ctDNA levels in RCC has yet to
be reached.

For select DIAMOND patients we also assessed tumour DNA content in urine
(supernatant and cell-pellet) and found similar levels and detection rates with minimal
overlap between fluids, with only six patients having detected ctDNA in both plasma

and urine. This data suggests that the mechanisms that determine the release and
levels of ctDNA in plasma and urine of patients with renal tumours vary, a finding
that requires further mechanistic analysis. We further aimed to assess intratumoural
heterogeneity through the comparison of multi-region sampled tumour tissue and
ctDNA. Unfortunately, analysis of further patients was hampered by their low ctDNA
levels. Nevertheless, analysis of two well characterised DIAMOND patients revealed
that mutations from the majority of sampled tumour regions were detected in plasma.
In addition, we show for the first time that genetic heterogeneity is represented in
ctDNA from urine. As such, whilst limited, our data suggest that ctDNA analysis of
both fluids has the potential to overcome intratumoural heterogeneity that is prevalent
in renal cancers[33].

We also found that ctDNA indicated minimal residual disease after nephrectomy, preempting detection by imaging by 29 days. Another noteworthy finding was the
detection of ctDNA in the plasma and urine of patients with benign oncocytomas and
early stage ccRCCs. For the former this is particularly surprising given the benign
nature of oncocytomas. Whilst differentiation of small renal masses into ccRCC,
chRCC or oncocytoma can be challenging using renal tumour biopsy, these data hint
at the possibility of non-invasively differentiating small renal masses to guide
decisions over invasive surgery versus active surveillance.

We recognise the limitations of our study. By including a broad range of renal mass
patients there was a limited number of patients with each disease stage. Furthermore,
our pre-analytical knowledge evolved during recruitment to the DIAMOND cohort
meaning not all sample types and time points were available for all patients.

Moreover, different techniques were applied to different patient cohorts, though this
in turn reinforces the general statement that ctDNA in RCC is challenging and further
developments are needed for clinical utility. Larger studies of ctDNA in ccRCC are
now required to better determine its clinical utility and validate any prognostic or
predictive utility. We would suggest that together with harmonised pre-analytical
conditions for urine and plasma collection, a triaging method, such as the
fragmentation feature based RF model explored here, is needed to move the field
forward. Furthermore, assays that target multiple biomarkers, including proteins29 and
methylated cfDNA[34], will improve sensitivity. Multiple questions remain about this
ctDNA-low malignancy but there is no doubt that further study is warranted and will
inform approaches for other ctDNA-low tumour types.

Methods
DIAMOND study sample collection
Patients with a range of renal malignancies were recruited to the DIAMOND study
according to local ethical guidelines (REC ID 03/018). Patient characteristics and
renal tumour pathological details are presented in Fig. 1 and table S1.

Patients underwent partial or total nephrectomy as part of curative treatment or
cytoreductive surgery. Tumour tissue, from 29 patients, was obtained during these
procedures and samples were stored as either fresh frozen- (FF) or formalin fixed
paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens. An average of 4 spatially separate tumour
regions per patient (range 2 to 10 regions, 128 across all patients) were obtained, in
order to study and overcome tumour heterogeneity prevalent in renal cancer[2].

For FF samples, a small piece of tissue weighing <20mg was removed and DNA was
extracted using a DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (QIAGEN) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. For the FFPE samples, 2mm diameter and 3mm3 deep `cores
were obtained and DNA was extracted using the GeneRead DNA FFPE kit
(QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, apart from the 56°C incubation
step which was carried out overnight instead of for 1 hour. This protocol utilises
Uracil-N-Glycosylases enzymes in order to remove artefacts resulting from the
deamination of cytosine during the fixation process. All extracted DNA was
quantified using the Qubit assay run on the PheraStar FSX platform (BMG LabTech).

From all DIAMOND patients we collected blood plasma prior to surgery (mean 5.0,
range 0-35 days pre-surgery) and samples were processed as follows. For samples

collected prior to April 2016 (21/32 patients), 8ml of blood were collected into EDTA
tubes and, within 1 hour, centrifuged at room temperature at 4,000 rpm for 20
minutes. The plasma layer was subsequently decanted into separate cryotubes. The
buffy coat layer was transferred into a sterile 2ml microfuge tube for parallel use. For
samples collected after April 2016 (11/32 patients), 12ml of blood were collected into
EDTA tubes and centrifuged at room temperature at 1,600g for 10 minutes within an
hour of collection. Avoiding the buffy coat layer, 4ml of plasma was transferred to
RNase-free microfuge tubes and spun on a bench top centrifuge at 13,300 rpm for 10
minutes. The supernatant was transferred to a 2ml sterile microfuge tube and the
pellet was discarded. The buffy coat layer was transferred from the original collection
tube into a sterile 2ml microfuge tube for parallel use. Once processed, all samples
were stored at -80’C.

For 22 patients, urine samples were also collected prior to surgery (mean 8.6, range 035 days pre-surgery). From the same urine sample we isolated both urine supernatant
(USN) and urine cell pellet (UCP), as follows. From each patient, 30-50ml urine was
collected in a 50ml falcon tube, and 0.5M EDTA was added within an hour of
collection (pH 8.0; 600µl for 30ml, final concentration 10mM. For larger volumes of
urine the volume of EDTA was adjusted accordingly). After gentle inversion, the
sample was spun at 2,400g for 10 minutes. Subsequently, ~3.6ml of supernatant was
transferred into a separate cryotube. For UCP collection, an additional 1ml of
supernatant was transferred to a separate microfuge tube, whilst the remaining
supernatant was discarded. The 1ml supernatant was then returned to the original
falcon tube containing the urine cell pellet (UCP). This was agitated and the
remaining liquid was transferred to a sterile 2ml microfuge tube. This was spun at

13,300 rpm for 10 minutes and the supernatant was discarded leaving a dry UCP for
storage at -80’C.

As well as pre-surgery plasma and urine, from a subset of patients we also collected
post-surgery plasma and urine (Fig. S11). Furthermore, in addition to renal cancer
patient samples, we obtained plasma (Sera Labs) and urine DNA (local collection)
from healthy individuals to act as controls for mutation analysis.

DNA was extracted from the fluid samples, as well as matched buffy coat samples,
using the QIAsymphony platform (QIAGEN). DNA was quantified using the Qubit
assay on the PheraStar FSX plate reader and by digital PCR (dPCR) using probes
targeting the RPP30 gene. All patient and sample details are summarised in Fig. 1B
and table S1.

MonReC study sample collection
An independent cohort of patients was recruited to the Graz based MonReC
(monitoring renal cancer) study (approved by Ethics Committee of the Medical
University of Graz, Austria, approval number 27-210 ex 14/15 and by the Ethics
Committee of the Military Institute of Medicine, Warsaw, Poland, approval number
33/WIM/2015. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before blood
draw.

For the MonReC study plasma was obtained at first diagnosis of metastases, during
several lines of treatment, and/or at every further instance of progression/development

of new metastases along with the introduction of a new line of treatment. Patient
details are summarised in Fig. 1C and in table S1.

We obtained 49 blood samples from 18 patients (mean age 62.5 years; range 46-81)
from the Department of Urology and from the Division of Oncology, Department of
Internal Medicine, at the Medical University of Graz, Austria. In addition, 204 plasma
samples were collected from 25 patients with metastatic disease (mean age 58.9 years;
range 41-68), recruited from the Department of Oncology at Military Institute of
Medicine, Poland.

For the Graz cohort 9 ml blood was drawn into EDTA-containing tubes containing
10% NBF (BD Biosciences) or Streck tubes. Blood drawn at the Medical University
of Graz, Austria (18/43 patients) was immediately sent to the Institute of Human
Genetics. Plasma was extracted as described previously[35] and stored at -80°C prior
to analysis. For samples collected at the Military Institute of Medicine, Poland (25/43
patients), plasma was extracted there and stored at -80°C before shipping to Graz.
cfDNA was extracted from 2 ml of plasma using QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid
Kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer’s protocol. DNA was quantified using
Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Library preparation and exome capture of tissue and germline samples from
DIAMOND patients
In order to identify patient specific somatic mutations, we carried out whole exome
sequencing (WES) of all tumour tissue and germline buffy coat DNA samples. Fifty
nanograms of DNA was fragmented by acoustic shearing (Covaris) according to the

manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries were prepared using the Thruplex DNA-Seq
protocol (Rubicon Genomics) using 5x cycles of PCR. Exome capture was performed
using the TruSeq Exome Capture protocol (Illumina) with the addition of i5 and i7
specific blockers (IDT) during the hybridisation steps to prevent adaptor ‘daisy
chaining’. After capture, 8x cycles of PCR were performed. Libraries, before and
after hybrid capture, were quantified using KAPA library quantification kits (KAPA)
and fragment size distributions were determined using a Bioanalyzer or Tapestation
(Agilent). Sequencing was performed on a HiSeq 4000 (Illumina).

DIAMOND Shallow whole genome sequencing and tMAD analysis
Shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS) was performed on all tissue, plasma and
urine (USN and UCP) samples. For each sample type, libraries were pooled in an
equimolar fashion and 150bp paired end sequencing was performed (to give an
average 16.4 million reads per sample) using an Illumina HiSeq 4000.

For sWGS analysis, sequence data was analysed using an ‘in-house’ pipeline that
consists of the following; paired-end sequence reads were aligned to the human
reference genome (GRCh37) using BWA (version 0.7.13)[36] after removing any
contaminant adapter sequences. SAMtools (version 1.3.1)[37] was used to convert files
to BAM format. PCR and optical duplicates were marked using Picard-Tools’
(version 2.2.4) ‘MarkDuplicates’ feature and these were excluded from downstream
analysis along with reads of low mapping quality and supplementary alignments.

CNA calling of tissue was performed in R using the QDNAseq pipeline[38]. Briefly,
sequence reads were allocated into equally sized (here 1 Mb and 50 kb) non-

overlapping bins throughout the length of the genome. Read counts in each bin were
corrected to account for sequence GC content and mappability, and bins
corresponding to previously ‘blacklisted’ (ENCODE) and manually blacklisted
regions were excluded from downstream analysis.

For all sWGS data, we calculated the trimmed Median Absolute Deviation (tMAD)
from the copy number neutral state. This method is described in detail in Mouliere et
al, 2018[14]). Briefly this method compares normalised read counts across genomic
bins in cases against those from a cohort of healthy control samples and the median
absolute deviation from log2R=0 of segmented bins is calculated. To define the
detection threshold, we measured the tMAD score for sWGS data from 46 healthy
individuals and took the maximal value (median=0.01, range 0.004–0.015). The
approach has a sensitivity of 0.3%[14] and details can be found at its github page
(https://github.com/sdchandra/tMAD). We downsampled all plasma bam files to 10
millions reads and carried out analysis using a bin size of 30kbp. We used two forms
of normalisation – 1, normalisation to a plasma sample from a cohort of healthy
controls and 2, normalisation to the samples’ own mean logR. All plasma and USN
samples were analysed by method one. UCP samples were analysed by method 2 as
no matched healthy control samples were available for that sample type. For these
UCP samples, ctDNA was detected if we observed a signal that deviated from the
copy number neutral state.

MonReC Modified Fast Aneuploidy Screening Test-Sequencing System (mFASTSeqS)

In order to estimate the tumour fraction prior to more expensive genome-wide and/or
high-resolution approaches, all samples collected in Graz were analysed using the
mFAST-SeqS method. Briefly, this approach is based on the selective amplification
of LINE-1 (L1) sequences. LINE-1 amplicon libraries were generated from 0.5-1ng of
plasma derived DNA according to our previously published protocol[16]. Libraries
were pooled equimolarily and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq or MiSeq platform
generating a minimum of 100,000 single-end reads for each sample. LINE1 read
counts per chromosome arm and on a genomewide level were counted and compared
to a set of healthy controls and deviations were reflected in z-scores[16].

MonReC Shallow whole genome sequencing and ichorCNA analysis
For a subset of MonReC samples, sWGS was performed. To this end shotgun libraries
were generated from 5-10ng of plasma DNA using the TruSeq DNA Nano Sample
Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) as previously described[35]. Libraries
were quantified by qPCR with the quality checked using a Bioanalyzer DNA 7500 Kit
(Agilent Technologies). Pooled libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq or
MiSeq platform using a 2 x75bp paired-end mode. Additionally, data were analysed
with the previously published ichorCNA algorithm to calculate tumour fraction from
ultra-low-pass whole-genome sequencing (ULP-WGS)[18]. Due to the low tumour
fractions, we applied an updated version of the algorithm
(https://github.com/broadinstitute/ichorCNA/wiki/Parameter-tuning-and-settings).
Moreover, in silico size selection was performed to enrich for tumour-derived
fragments. As the lower limit of detection of ichorCNA was previously determined as
a tumor fraction of 0.03, samples with tumor fractions below that threshold were
considered as ctDNA negative. Due to the lower number of reads after size selection,

the number of total reads was also downsampled to the enable comparable profiles
and to exclude false positive calls (see Supplementary material). For samples with
less than 2 million reads after size selection, samples were only considered as positive
when SCNA frequently found in RCC according to the ProGenetix database were
observed.

DIAMOND mutations calling of tissue WES data
Mutation Calling of WES data was performed as follows;
Sequence data were aligned with BWA MEM v0.7.15[39] to the GRCh37/hg19 human
reference genome assembly that includes unlocalized and unplaced contigs, the rCRS
mitochondrial sequence (AC:NC_012920), Human herpesvirus 4 type 1
(AC:NC_007605) and the hs37d5 decoy sequence. Duplicate read pairs based on
aligned positions of each end were marked using Picard v1.122
(http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard).

We focused our mutation calling efforts on regions of the genome that had depth
>20x in the matched germline buffy coat sequencing data. For this, we used the
CallableLoci tool from GATK[37]. Somatic mutations were called using Mutect2[40]. In
addition to Mutect2’s filters we applied additional filters described in table S8[41].

We excluded SNVs that represented likely SNPs by virtue of their having a
population allele frequency of above 0.02 in the 1000 Genomes project global
database[42]. Furthermore, we excluded variants that had an AF > 0 in any normal
adjacent tissue samples.

Despite these filters, we observed a large excess of C:G>A:T mutations in sequencing
data from FFPE samples. We explored features of the artefact that could be used to
distinguish it from true somatic C:G>A:T calls and found that it had a distinctive
sequence context, specifically it was often preceded by C or T and G or A
respectively (i.e. [C/T] C>A and [G/A] G>T). As such we filtered out all C:G>A:T
calls that had this sequence context. The resulting lists of patient-specific SNVs was
used to guide TAPAS panel design. WES revealed an average 297.36 unique somatic
single nucleotide variants (SNV) per patient that passed our quality thresholds.

DIAMOND Tailored Panel Sequencing (TAPAS) - custom capture panel design
based on WES data
A 2.077Mb (57306 probes) personalised capture panel was designed based upon the
somatic SNVs identified by WES of patient FF and FFPE tissue samples. Significant
filtering of SNVs was required, as outlined above. The panel was designed using
Agilent’s interactive online design tool, Sure Design (Agilent). The probe tiling
parameters used were as follows; Tiling density= 1x, Masking = Most stringent,
Boosting = Maximise performance, Extension into repeats = 20, Strand = sense.

As well as targeting the patient specific mutations identified by WES of patient
tumour samples, the open reading frames of oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes
previously implicated in renal tumourigenesis were tiled. These included the genes
VHL, PBRM1, and SETD2[2]. The promoter region of TERT was also tiled[43]. The
complete list of genes tiled by the panel are shown in table S5.

Libraries were generated from 15-30ng plasma and USN derived DNA using
Thruplex Tag-Seq kits (Rubicon Genomics). Tag-Seq libraries contain unique
molecular indexes (UMIs) that make it possible to trace a sequence read back to the
original DNA fragment that yielded it. After 8-11 PCR cycles (dependent on input),
libraries were quantified using KAPA library quantification kits. UCP DNA was
sheared using acoustic shearing (Covaris) and 15-30ng were used for library
preparation as above.

333.3ng each of three libraries were pooled and the 1000ng mix was used for hybrid
capture using the custom SureSelect XTHS panel described above (Agilent).
Hybridisation was carried out with the addition of i5 and i7 specific blockers (IDT).
Captured libraries were amplified using 13 cycles of PCR. Captured libraries were
quantified using KAPA library quantification kits, and sequenced across multiple
HiSeq4000 (paired end 150bp) lanes such that at least 30 million sequencing reads
were obtained for each sample in order to allow sufficient duplication for the proper
use of UMIs.

DIAMOND INVAR-TAPAS ctDNA detection
Aligned sequence reads were ‘collapsed’ using UMI sequences incorporated during
library preparation. The CONNOR tool (https://github.com/umich-brcfbioinf/Connor/blob/master/doc/METHODS.rst) was used, with the following settings;
minimum family size = 2, requires percent majority = 90%.

We applied our INtegration of VAriant Reads - TAilored PAnel Sequencing (INVARTAPAS) approach to the custom capture sequence data (Fig. S6). Briefly, the INVAR

algorithm (Wan et al, under review) aggregates signal across hundreds to thousands of
mutant loci identified by WES and targeted by the custom capture panel (described
above). Error suppression, through the use of UMIs, and consideration of mutation
sequence context, fragment length and tumour mutant allele fraction is used to
diminish background noise levels and enrich for ctDNA signal. This generates a
significance level for each of the patient specific loci, which are combined into an
aggregate likelihood function. Sequencing data from DNA of patients using nonmatched mutation lists are used as negative controls for receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to select a likelihood threshold for ctDNA
detection. A global ctDNA allele fraction is determined by taking a backgroundsubtracted, depth-weighted mean allele fraction across the patient-specific loci in that
sample.

The sensitivity of ctDNA detection depends on the total number of informative reads
(IR, unique molecules aligning to patient specific mutant loci) covering tumourmutated loci. Here, seven plasma and six urine samples had <20,000 IR (Fig. S9),
resulting in limited ability to detect ctDNA. Indeed, none showed evidence of
detected ctDNA. This was often due to few patient specific mutations detected in
tissue (<100 mutations, Fig. S7A). Detection to levels below 1.0x10-4 mAF would
require re-analysis using greater amounts of input DNA and/or re-design of the
capture panel targeting a greater number of patient specific mutations. As such, these
samples were excluded as technical failures.

For mutation profiling a customized QIAseq Targeted DNA Panel (CDHS-11685Z538; QIAGEN) was used. The panel enriches 10 genes that are frequently mutated in
RCC: BAP1, KDM5C, MET, MTOR, PBRM1, PIK3CA, PTEN, SETD2, TP53, VHL.
Libraries were prepared from 10ng plasma DNA according to the QIAseq targeted
DNA Panel Handbook (R2). Briefly, the DNA template was enzymatically
fragmented, end-repaired and A-tailed. Each DNA molecule was then tagged using an
Illumina-specific adapter containing a UMI. Target regions were enriched by one
target-specific primer and one universal primer. Finally, library amplification and
completion of Illumina adapters was done in a universal PCR with 18 cycles.
Libraries were quantified using the QIAseq Library Quant Assay (QIAGEN) and the
fragment size was checked using the Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent
Technologies). Libraries were pooled equimolarily and sequenced on the Illumina
NextSeq platform. On average 3.47 million reads (range 1.33-5.7M) were obtained
per sample. Raw sequencing data generated by the QIAseq Targeted DNA Panel was
analysed using the QIAseq targeted DNA Panel Analysis pipeline, which processes
the UMI information to distinguish between true variants and sequencing errors based
on smCounter V1[44]. All variants that did not pass the predefined quality criteria from
smCounter were dismissed. Moreover, we filtered synonymous variants and variants
present with minor allele frequencies of >1% in population frequency databases
(ExAC, gnomAS, 1000g, TOPME) were considered as polymorphisms. In order to
increase variant calling stringency we analysed all samples in duplicate (median raw
sequencing depth 9688.3, range 4176.7-17043.9), and only considered variants to be
real if identified in both replicates. All detected variants were visually checked using
Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) (version 2.3.58). Sensitivity assessment of two
independent dilution series using SeraCare reference material revealed detection rates

of 90% and 100% for 0.02 mAF, 70% for 0.01 and 25% for 5.0x10-3 based on the
evaluation of 10 different mutations. Variants with an expected mAF of 2.5x10-3 and
1.3x10-3 could not be detected.

ctDNA detection and comparison against patient tumour size and presence of renal
vein or inferior vena cava tumour thrombus
For DIAMOND patients, we assessed whether there was a difference in the
distribution of tumour sizes amongst patients with detected ctDNA as compared to
those in whom ctDNA was not detected. Tumour size was determined as the
maximum diameter of the primary tumour on abdominal CT scan. We determined
whether there was a relationship through the use of the Mann-Whitney’s U test.

Similarly, we compared ctDNA detection in patients displaying evidence of extension
of a tumour thrombus into the renal vein or inferior vena cava, as assessed on cross
sectional imaging, with those that did not have a tumour thrombus. Fisher’s exact test
was used to determine associations between detection of ctDNA (in individual and
combined fluids, by INVAR-TAPAS +/- tMAD) and tumour thrombus extension,
with a significance threshold of p<0.05 (Fig. S11).

In both cases these were exploratory analyses and to confirm the corresponding
findings and hypotheses, further confirmatory tests are required.

Ki-67 staining of DIAMOND tissue
We compared ctDNA detection with the Ki67 cellular proliferation rate in matched

levels of ctDNA[31]. We carried out immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of FFPE
tissue sections from a subset of DIAMOND patients (See Fig. S1), using an anti-Ki67
monclonal antibody (MIB-1 clone at 1:100 dilution; DAKO Agilent Technologies
LDA). The immunohistochemistry was scored manually at x400 magnification. For
each slide, 20 separate high-powered fields were assessed for positively stained
tumour cell nuclei by a specialist uro-pathologist (AYW). Across the 20 regions, at
least 6000 tumour cells were studied for each patient. An arbitrary proportions score
was used to assess Ki67 levels with regions containing up to 0%, 1%, 10%, 30%, 75%
and 100% of positive cells being assigned a score of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively.
The sum of these scores, across all 20 regions, was used as an indicator of the level of
proliferation.

These values were subsequently compared between patients with detected and nodetected ctDNA with T-test p<0.05 indicating a significant difference (Fig. S11C-E).

RF model for ctDNA detection prediction
The model used here was based upon a classification model described in Mouliere et
al, 2018[14]. Briefly, the model considers the following fragmentation features
(outlined in detail in the referenced manuscript) which were calculated from sWGS
data: t-MAD, amplitude_10bp (the amplitude of 10 bp oscillations), P(20-150) (the
proportion of fragments between 20 and 150 bp), P(160-180), P(20-150)/P(160-180),
P(100-150), P(100-150)/P(163-169), P(180-220), P(250-320), P(20-150)/P(180-220).
The model was trained using sWGS data from a cohort of ‘high ctDNA’ cancer
samples, and was validated on ‘low ctDNA’ cancer samples, including plasma from
the sub-cohort of DIAMOND patients used in this study. Optimal classification of

samples from cancer patients and controls, was observed using a random forest (RF)
machine-learning algorithm.

Here, we used the RF disease classification model to triage patient samples,
predicting which RCC patients were likely to have sufficient ctDNA (in plasma or
urine) for targeted sequencing by other, more sensitive, methods. We used “50%
probability of cancer classification” as a threshold, comparing ctDNA detection
amongst patients that fell above and below this value, as output by the RF model. We
compared the ability of the model to triage patients using the INVAR-TAPAS method
with or without tMAD in plasma alone, or in either fluid.

Assessment of tumour heterogeneity and representation in plasma and urine
We assessed the heterogeneity of tumour samples from patient 5842, and its
representation in plasma and urine samples obtained prior to nephrectomy. Mutations
in tissue were called as described above. The SAMtools (version 1.3.1)[37] function
mpileup was used to assess allelic content at mutant loci, with a mAF calculated for
each site and this data was converted to a matrix. A heatmap was generated from this
data using the R heatmap function. Hierarchical clustering was by mutations
(columns) but not by sample (rows) according to Euclidean distance.

Fig. 1 Study design, patient characteristics and tumour genomic profile. (A)
ctDNA analysis in RCC patients was applied to two patient cohorts, DIAMOND and
MonReC. Initially, untargeted sequencing methods were applied to samples; For
DIAMOND, tMAD analysis of sWGS data was applied. For MonReC, a combination
of z-score analyses of mFastSeq data and ichorCNA analysis of sWGS data.
41

Subsequently, targeted sequencing methods were used; For DIAMOND, INVARTAPAS was applied to patient plasma (n=29) and urine (n=20). For MonReC, a
QIASeq custom capture panel targeting the 10 most commonly mutated genes in RCC
patients was applied. (B) For DIAMOND, plasma (n=47) and urine (n=21) were
collected from patients with a range of tumour subtypes and stages. Specifically, 28
ccRCCs (11/1/16 stage I, II & III respectively), 7 chRCCs (2/2/3 2 stage I, II & III), 8
oncocytomas, 1 patient with papillary RCC (stage III), 1 patient with a MiT family
translocation RCC (stage II) and 2 patients with oncocytic renal neoplasm. Shown, in
descending order, are tumour tissue mutation status of frequently mutated RCC genes
(pale blue cubes indicate that a mutation was detected, white space indicates that no
mutation was detected, grey columns indicate that tissue was not available for that
patient), tumour -subtype, -size, -stage, metastatic at baseline, evidence of venous
tumour thrombus, and number of tumour SNVs (targeted for INVAR-TAPAS) (C)
For MonReC, plasma (n=43) was collected from 41 patients with metastatic RCC and
two with localized RCC. Shown, in descending order, are plasma mutation status
(after QIASeq, blue, medium blue and dark blue cubes indicate that a mutation was
detected at baseline, during follow-up, or at both time points respectively) of
frequently mutated RCC genes, tumour -subtype, -size and metastatic at time of
sampling. More comprehensive versions of (B) and (C) provided in Fig. S13.

Fig. 2. ctDNA detection using untargeted assays. (A) Distribution of tMAD scores
across DIAMOND plasma samples (x-axis). Data points are coloured according to
disease subtype. A tMAD score of >0.015 (grey dashed line) indicates SCNA, and
thus ctDNA. ctDNA was detected in 3/47 (6.4%) plasma samples. Data on the y-axis
show tMAD scores for the same plasma samples after in silico size selection for
sequencing reads 90-150bp in length. On average the tMAD score increased 2.2 fold
(range 1.25-4.83) and led to ctDNA detection in 8 additional patient samples,

43

resulting in ctDNA detection in 11/47 (23.4%) DIAMOND patients. Four patient
samples had insufficient sequencing reads after size selection for tMAD analysis (red
highlight). (B) Tumour fraction of MonReC ctDNA positive plasma samples (n=14),
as calculated by ichorCNA, before and after in silico size selection for sequencing
reads 90-150bp in length. On average tumour fraction increased 2.2-fold (range 0.9 –
5.7) and revealed six patients with detected ctDNA, in addition to the eight patient
samples detected without size-selection. (C) Plot showing distribution of tMAD
scores across DIAMOND plasma, urine supernatant (USN) and urine cell pellet
(UCP) samples. Samples from the same patient are connected by grey lines. The
detection threshold is indicated by a red dashed line. (D) tMAD and (E) z-scores
score distribution of RCC samples were compared to samples from other cancer types
collected at the University of Cambridge[14] and Medical University of Graz
respectively. Renal samples are highlighted. GBM = Glioblastoma, Mel = Melanoma,
ChC = Cholangiocarcinoma, CRC = Colorectal cancer. A similar comparison was
carried out using the ichorCNA metric (Fig. S5C).

Fig. 3. ctDNA detection using targeted assays. (A) Application of INVAR-TAPAS
to DIAMOND plasma samples. ctDNA was detected in plasma of 12/22 (54.5%),
with global ctDNA mAF (gMAF) shown on the y-axis (Fig. 4). Disease subtype is
indicated by bar colour (legend in Fig. 3D). (B) The same analysis was applied to
DIAMOND USN samples. ctDNA was detected in 7/14 (50%) patients. (C)
Comparison of gmAF of plasma and USN samples. In patients for whom we had
access to both fluids, lines connect data points (Spearman’s rho = 0.28, p=0.3). (D)
Summary of targeted sequence analysis using a 10-gene QIASeq panel. Mutations at
baseline were detected in 8/43 (18.6%) MonReC plasma samples. The y-axis denotes
mAF which ranged from 3.5x10-2-0.15 (if two or more mutations detected, the mean
was calculated). (E) Assessment of the correlation between primary tumour size
(diameter, cm), and ctDNA detection. Detection was via tMAD and/or INVARTAPAS, and in either fluid. This observation was driven by plasma (Fig. S6A) with
45

no apparent relationship in urine (Fig. S6B). (F) ctDNA detection in plasma was
significantly more frequent amongst patients with venous tumour thrombus as
compared to those without. This was not the case when considering ctDNA in urine or
ctDNA in either fluid (Fig. S11).

Fig. 4. Summary of ctDNA detection in all patients and all biofluids. (A)
Summary of ctDNA detection in baseline plasma (left of triangle box pair) and urine
(right of pair) of DIAMOND ccRCC (left), chRCC (top right) and oncocytoma
(oncoC, middle right) patients. Four patients with ‘other’ disease sub-types are not
shown. Samples are ranked in descending order according to tumour size (cm). For
each data point, the upper left triangle shows the results of INVAR-TAPAS analysis
and the bottom right the results of tMAD analysis. Green triangles indicate samples in
which ctDNA was detected, white triangles indicate samples in which ctDNA was not
detected, grey triangles indicate no data available (because the assay was not applied

47

to that sample, or no sample was available), and pink triangles indicate failed assay.
Data points with a black outline indicate patients with metastatic disease at the time of
sampling. DIAMOND patients 5842 and 5634 (longitudinal section) are highlighted
with an orange box. (B) summary of ctDNA detection in baseline (left of triangle box
pair) and follow-up (right of pair) plasma of MonReC patients. Each subtype is shown
in a separate box (ccRCC, clear cell; pRCC, papillary; chRCC, chromophobe; NA,
unknown) The upper left triangle shows the results of QIASeq analysis, the bottom
right the results of ichorCNA analysis. Triangle colour, as above. Forty-one patients
had metastatic disease and, where data was available, the number of metastatic sites is
indicated. ctDNA detection are plotted alongside patient characteristics in Fig. S13.

Fig. 5. Application of a fragmentation feature based random forest model to
predict patients with detected ctDNA. An RF model utilised for cancer detection
based on fragmentation features[14] was applied to plasma samples from DIAMOND
patients. Amongst those with >50% probability of ctDNA detection (above dotted
line), 11/12 (91.7%) had detected ctDNA by INVAR in either fluid. Conversely, of
those with <50% probability, 4/11 (36.4%) had detected ctDNA (p=9.4x10-3, Fisher's
exact test). A blue point indicates patients with detected ctDNA while orange points
indicate patients in which ctDNA was not detected. Disease subtype is indicated by
data point shape with circle=ccRCC, triangle=chRCC and square=oncocytoma.
Detection in plasma (not urine) by INVAR is shown in Fig. S14B. Detection in
plasma (not urine) by INVAR and/or tMAD is shown in Fig. S14C. The equivalent
data for urine are shown in Fig. S14D-E.

Fig. 6. Longitudinal ctDNA analysis and assessment of intratumoural
heterogeneity in plasma and urine. (A) Longitudinal cfDNA assessment of
MonReC patients with metastatic RCC. Shown are disease courses of patients who
had detected ctDNA with QIASeq and/or ichorCNA analysis. Time between
nephrectomy and first blood draw is indicated in days (NA, not available; NN, no
nephrectomy). Type and duration of treatment (mTOR=mTOR inhibitor;
PAZ=pazopanib, SUN=sunitinib; EVE=everolimus; CAB=cabozantinib;
AXI=Axitinib; SOR=sorafenib; IMT=immune therapy) are indicated by coloured

lines. Most patients had detected ctDNA at progression (PD), whereas during stable
disease (SD) or response (partial response, PR) ctDNA was undetected. (B) and (C)
Plots demonstrating dynamic changes in ctDNA in longitudinal plasma from
MonReC patients K27 and K39 respectively. Further details, and patient specific plots
are in Fig. S16. (D) tMAD (left y-axis) and INVAR-TAPAS (right) analysis of
plasma taken throughout the clinical course of DIAMOND patient 5842. Following
nephrectomy (scan a; orange arrow=right renal tumour, red arrow=tumour thrombus),
whilst INVAR-TAPAS global ctDNA levels (black line) drop, it remains detected
(gmAF=9.5x10-4) at day 53, indicating residual disease. Conversely, imaging did not
detect residual disease at day 16 (b; normal renal fossa). ctDNA levels rise with
disease spread, before falling again upon the commencement of radio- and chemotherapy. Of note, ctDNA levels continue to fall despite evidence of clinical
progression. Further details are provided in Fig. S18A-B. tMAD values before (blue
line) and after (red line, grey circles=detected ctDNA) size selection are shown. Urine
data are shown in Fig. S18C. (E) Comparison of baseline ctDNA mAF in plasma
(red) and USN (blue) and the number of tumour regions that mutation was observed
in after multi-region sampling of 5842. * indicate significant difference as compared
to mutations detected in just one region. (F) Heatmap of mutations detected across 10
tumour biopsies (T1-T9=fresh frozen, A7=FFPE) and baseline fluid samples from
5842, with vertical coloured lines indicating individual SNVs. Hierarchical clustering
was by mutation according to Euclidean distance. Colour intensity corresponds to
mutation mAF. Whilst mutations show different representation in pre-surgery fluids
(Fig. S23), all mutation clusters, even those private to individual regions, are
represented by at least one mutation in plasma and urine (Fig. S24).
