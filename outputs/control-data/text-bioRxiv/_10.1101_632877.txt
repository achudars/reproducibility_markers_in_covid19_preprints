Abstract: Levels of Bacteroidetes in the gut microbiome are positively associated with insulin resistance
(IR) in humans. Considering that IR is promoted by elevations in hepatic sphingolipids (SL), particularly
ceramides, and that Bacteroidetes are the only microbiome phylum possessing genes encoding serine
palmitoyltransferase (SPT), which mediates SL synthesis, we investigated a potential link between
bacterial SL production, host SL metabolism, and IR. In vitro, bacterial SLs entered colonocytes and were
metabolized into complex SL, including ceramides. In mice, administration of WT Bacteroides
thetaiotaomicron, but not a SPT-deficient mutant, resulted in elevated levels of liver ceramides and
reduced responsiveness to exogenously administered insulin. This work establishes bacterial SLs as a new
class of microbiome-derived molecule capable of impacting host metabolism.

One Sentence Summary: SL production by gut Bacteroidetes regulates liver ceramide levels and insulin
sensitivity.

Main Text: Insulin resistance (IR) is a hallmark of metabolic syndrome, the precursor to type 2 diabetes.
Ceramides, which are an important class of complex sphingolipids (SLs), have been implicated in the
development of IR in animal models (1). Reduction of ceramide (d18:1/16:0) in the liver alleviates IR (24), and pharmacological inhibition of ceramide-related pathways in the intestine leads to improved
glucose homeostasis (5). In human populations, several studies have associated levels of hepatic or
plasma ceramides to IR (6-9), suggesting that an understanding of how ceramide pools are regulated
could be beneficial for treatment. Sources of SL include de novo synthesis, degradation and recycling of
existing SLs, and uptake of dietary SLs from the intestine. We hypothesized that the gut microbiome
constitutes an additional source of SL with impact on host SL homeostasis.
The human gut microbiome comprises a vast diversity of bacterial species that varies between
individuals, however across individuals a small number of bacterial phyla are proportionally dominant.
One of the dominant phyla, the Bacteroidetes, has a functionally unique feature that distinguishes them
from other members of the gut microbiome: they are able to synthesize SLs, which are very similar, or
identical, in structure to mammalian SLs (10-12). Members of the phylum Bacteroidetes include genera
such as Bacteroides, Prevotella and Porphyromonas, all of which are highly prevalent in humans,
wherein they together constitute 30-40% on average of the gut microbiome (12), and therefore possibly
act as an endogenous source of SL to their hosts.
Several metagenomic studies have revealed associations between elevated levels of Bacteroidetes
in the gut and markers of metabolic disease (13, 14). In a study of 292 Danes, Le Chatelier et al. noted a
reduction of Bacteroides in low-richness gut microbiomes associated with hosts with lower insulin
resistance (14). Pederson et al. linked IR and elevated Bacteroidetes in the gut via the production of
branched-chain amino acids in 277 non-diabetic individuals (13). Bacteroidetes have also been shown to
influence IR via the metabolism of bile acids (15, 16), and FXR signaling (5, 17). Considering that host
SLs levels are linked to IR (6-9), and that Bacteroidetes produce SL, these bioactive lipids may provide a
mechanistic link between gut Bacteroidetes and IR. Given their large number in the intestine, here we

investigate whether Bacteroidetes may be an additional source of SLs to the host with consequences for
liver ceramide homeostasis and IR.
To date, evidence that bacterial SLs interact with host tissue comes from the observation that a
glucosylceramide produced by B. fragilis regulates iNKT cell proliferation in neonatal mice (18). To
assess the potential for SLs of bacterial origin to interact with non-hematopoietic host cells, we first tested
whether bacterial SLs were readily taken up by mammalian cells, and whether bacterial lipids could be
processed by mammalian SL synthesis pathways. Bacteroides spp. produces both even-chain length
sphinganine (Sa - d18:0) and odd-chain length Sa (d17:0)(10), while mammalian SPT produces only
even-chain Sa (d18:0) (19, 20) (for an overview of SL synthesis pathways, see Fig S1). This difference in
chain length allows the tracking of the bacterial long-chain base Sa into mammalian cells. We
supplemented Caco-2 cells with Sa (d18:0) to stimulate de novo SL synthesis (Fig. S2A-B, see methods),
then dosed the cells with different amounts of the odd-chain base bacterial Sa (d17:0). We observed the
conversion of Sa (d17:0) to So (d17:1), indicating that Sa (d17:0) was readily taken up by Caco-2 cells
and incorporated into complex SLs through the de novo synthesis pathway (Fig. 1A-B). This observation
establishes that odd-chain base SLs of bacterial origin can be processed by the mammalian SL pathways.
In addition to the processing of bacterial SL by the mammalian pathway, we observed inhibition
of Sa (d18:0) metabolism at higher levels of Sa (d17:0). Levels of Sa (d18:0) were lower than baseline at
5µM concentrations of Sa (d17:0), indicating flux of Sa (d18:0) through the SL-processing pathway.
However, at higher concentrations of Sa (d17:0), Sa (d18:0) levels remained high (Fig. S2C), which
indicates that Sa (d18:0) metabolism stalled even though Sa (d17:0) metabolism was active. Furthermore,
we observed a concentration-dependent decrease in the ceramide precursor dihydroceramide (d18:0/16:0 Fig. 1C) and the downstream products ceramide (d18:1/16:0; Fig. 1D) under increasing Sa (d17:0)
conditions, suggesting an overall inhibition of de novo C18 long chain base ceramide production. This
inhibition of C18 long chain base ceramide production was also observed at lower concentrations of Sa
(d17:0) (i.e., 0.5-2 µM; Fig. S2E). Levels of sphingomyelin (d18:1/16:0; Fig. S2D) were unchanged with
the addition of Sa (d17:0). These results indicate that (i) odd-chain length bacterial Sa (d17:0) can be

taken up by mammalian cells, then (ii) metabolized by SL-processing pathways in vitro, while (iii)
inhibiting the production of mammalian C18-base SLs.
We next assessed if lipids could transfer from bacterial cells to mammalian cells. We used
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron VPI 5482 (hereafter, BTWT) cells grown in medium supplemented with
palmitic acid alkyne (PAA; allowing for fluorescence tracking using click chemistry) in a transwell
system, wherein bacterial cells were located 1 mm above mammalian cells and separated by a bacterialimpermeant 0.4 uM pore. Using this system, we observed that alkyne-labeled lipids from BTWT were
transferred to Caco-2 cells within 4 hours (Fig. S4).
To assess if SL production by BTWT could influence SL metabolism in Caco-2 cells, we exposed
them to BTWT and the same strain unable to synthesize SLs due to an inactivated SPT gene (hereafter,
SLMUT; Fig. S3; Methods) (21, 22). We performed a transcriptome analysis of Caco-2 cells exposed to
BTWT or SLMUT over 8 hours in the transwell (targeted analysis of 107 SL-related genes, Fig 1E, Fig.
S5, Table S1). As expected, genes involved in SL metabolism were differentially regulated in the
presence of BTWT or SLMUT. For instance, the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor gene S1PR4 was
upregulated early in Caco-2 cells co-incubated with BTWT compared to SLMUT. S1PR4 serves as a
receptor for gut microbiome produced N-acyl amides, and has been suggested to respond to microbiome
derived sphingolipids (23). Additional genes encoding enzymes in the SL-processing pathway, and
upregulated by Caco-2 cells in response to BTWT compared to SLMUT, included a sphingosine kinase
(SPHK1), sphingomyelinases (SMPD2, SMPDL3B), and a ceramide synthase (CERS1). SPHK1 is
involved in the phosphorylation of the long chain base sphingosine to sphingosine-1-phosphate, and
SMPD2 and SMPDL3B in the hydrolysis of the phospholipid sphingomyelin into ceramide and
phosphocholine (24). CERS1 produces ceramides with a C18:0 acyl chain length shown to influence
obesity-related IR in skeletal muscle (25). The differential regulation of SL-metabolism genes is
consistent with the different lipid exposure from BTWT and SLMUT.
To assess if lipid transfer from bacterial cells to host cells also occurs in vivo, BTWT-PAA cells
were administered by oral gavage to 5-week old germfree Swiss-Webster (SW) mice. PAA-metabolites,

readily observed in bacterial cells, transferred from the lumen into host gut epithelial tissue (Fig. 2A-D).
We then introduced BTWT cells containing Sa (d17:0) and Sa (d18:0) in equivalent amounts (Fig. S6) via
daily oral gavage to germfree SW mice over a one-week period and measured SLs in host tissue over the
course of the week. On days 1 and 7, we measured higher Sa (d17:0) in hepatic portal vein blood in
BTWT-treated compared to untreated mice (Fig. 2E). Together these results establish that BacteroidesSLs can transit from bacterial cells to the gut epithelium and portal vein, which should allow them to
reach the liver.
Conventionalization of germfree mice results in a normalization of lipid cycling, including SL
metabolism (26). Previous reports have shown that (i) germfree mice have higher hepatic ceramides
compared to conventionally-raised mice, and that (ii) conventionalization of germfree mice by inoculation
with a complex microbiota normalizes hepatic ceramides (27, 28). We confirmed these results by
conventionalizing GF mice and comparing liver ceramides to those of conventionally-raised animals (Fig.
S7). Moreover, to dissect how host hepatic ceramide levels relate specifically to the SL-production
capacity of the gut microbiota, we colonized 4 week old germfree SW mice with either BTWT or
SLMUT for 6 weeks and profiled SLs in tissues. BTWT and SLMUT colonized the mouse cecum at
comparable levels (Fig. S8A). At 6 weeks post colonization, cecal levels of three long chain base SLs
synthesized by BTWT, Sa (d17:0), 15-methylhexadeca Sa (m17:0), and Sa (d18:0), were significantly
higher in BTWT-colonized mice compared to SLMUT-colonized and GF mice, whereas levels of the long
chain base SL So (d18:1), which is not synthesized by BTWT, did not differ between treatments (Fig.
2F). Cecal dihydroceramides and ceramides with longer acyl chains (C22:0, C24:0, C24:1) were elevated
in the SLMUT condition, but cecal sphingomyelins were similar between conditions (Fig. S8B-D). Thus,
the SL-production capacity of the microbes in the gut has a large influence on the SL-milieu of the lumen.
Consistent with uptake and processing of saturated SL bases (d18:0) from the lumen, ileal levels
of the long chain base So (d18:1) were higher in BTWT compared to SLMUT and GF conditions (Fig.
2G). Dihydroceramide (d18:0/18:1), and dihydroceramide (d18:0/24:0) (Fig. S8E) were also significantly
elevated in the BTWT condition compared to SLMUT and GF conditions. Additionally, ileal ceramide

levels (d18:1/18:0, d18:1/20:0, d18:1/22:0, d18:1/24:0, d18:1/24:1) trended higher in the BTWT
compared to SLMUT and GF conditions (Fig. 2H), while ceramide and sphingomyelin (d18:1/16:0) were
higher in the GF and BTWT conditions compared to the SLMUT (Fig. S8F). These observations suggest
that saturated SL long chain bases (Sa (d18:0) and Sa (d17:0)) are taken up from the lumen by intestinal
epithelial cells and metabolized through the host’s de novo synthesis pathway in the intestine, resulting in
increased abundance of the downstream products sphingosine, dihydroceramide, and ceramide.
Importantly, hepatic dihydroceramide and ceramide levels were significantly higher in the BTWT
compared to SLMUT for multiple prominent ceramide species. Specifically, hepatic levels of
dihydroceramide (d18:0/24:1) (Fig. S8G), ceramide (d18:1/16:0), ceramide (d18:1/24:0), ceramide
(d18:1/24:1) (Fig. 2J), sphingomyelin (d18:1/16:0), and sphingomyelin (d18:1/24:1) were individually
higher in BTWT compared to SLMUT and GF conditions (Fig. S8H). These results indicate that bacterial
production of SL in the gut can impact levels of liver ceramides.
We next tested whether oral administration of BTWT to conventionally-raised mice could
supplement a diet deficient in SLs and impact rates of de-novo synthesis. We placed 5-week old female
SW mice on a fatty-acid free (FAF) diet known to increase hepatic lipogenesis (29). After 3 weeks on the
diet, hepatic de novo SL synthesis (as measured by the increase in the ratio of hepatic dihydroceramides
compared to ceramides) was elevated in the livers of FAF-fed mice compared to controls on breeder chow
(Fig.S9A). Mice were gavaged twice with BTWT or SLMUT over two days. BTWT treatment was
associated with the highest hepatic ceramide levels (Fig. 3A). Of the ceramides detected in the liver, the
most abundant was (d18:1/24:1) (Fig S9B). We observed significantly reduced de novo synthesis of this
abundant ceramide in the BTWT compared to the SLMUT and PBS treatments (Fig. 3B). The SLMUTgavage yielded effects on de novo SL synthesis similar to those of the PBS-gavage control (Fig. 3B).
Thus, when mice are fed a SL-poor diet, gut bacteria can act as an endogenous source of SLs that reduces
de-novo synthesis.
Elevated hepatic ceramide levels have the potential to affect insulin sensitivity in the host (2-4,
29, 30). We assessed how dietary supplementation with BTWT affects hepatic ceramides in high-fat diet

fed C57BL/6J mice, a well-established mouse model of IR. Conventionally-raised C57BL/6J mice
originally on a chow diet were gavaged with BTWT or SLMUT (in this instance, an SPT knock-out
strain, Methods) for 7 days, switched to a high-fat diet and re-gavaged with the same bacterial treatment
for 7 days, then maintained on the high-fat diet for 21 days. Mice were then switched to back to a chow
diet and gavaged with the same strains daily for 9 days. Relative to the SLMUT-treated mice, the BTWTtreated mice exhibited higher hepatic levels of ceramide (d18:1/16:0) and ceramide (d18:1/18:0) (Fig.
4A), sphinganine (d18:0), and sphingosine (d18:1) (Fig. 4B). Moreover, in an insulin tolerance test, the
BTWT-treated mice exhibited lower insulin sensitivity compared to SLMUT-treated mice (Fig. 4C),
although a glucose tolerance test indicated a similar glucose handling response (Fig. 4D). Our observed
effects of BTWT dosing on IR are similar to what has been observed when mice are treated with other
members of the Bacteroidetes, such as P. copri (13) and B. fragilis (17). Our results further indicate that
the BTWT treatment resulted in elevated hepatic ceramides, with the expected associated reduced insulin
sensitivity.
This study points to a role for SL production by Bacteroidetes to modulate the levels of bioactive
lipids in the liver and in turn affect IR. We have demonstrated that mammalian cells sense and respond to
the presence of bacterial SLs, and that these SLs can be processed via mammalian SL pathways.
Furthermore, our results show that mice adjust hepatic de-novo production of sphingolipids in response to
the SL-production capacity of gut bacteria. These observations provide an additional mechanistic link that
may underlie the observed positive associations between the levels of Bacteroidetes in the gut and IR.
Given that all members of the Bacteroidetes phylum produce SLs, and that the Bacteroidetes constitute a
widespread and dominant phylum in the human gut, levels of these bacteria may eventually be factor to
consider in the management of IR.

Fig. 1 - SL production by gut microbes inhibits de novo SL synthesis and alters gene expression in
Caco-2 cells. (A-D) SL synthesis was induced in proliferating Caco-2 cells with addition of 5 uM Sa
(d18:0) and then cells were dosed with increasing concentrations (5, 10, 50, 100 uM) of Sa (d17:0) to
monitor the ability of Sa (d17:0) to inhibit flux of C18-base length SLs through the SL synthesis pathway.
Cells were harvested 1 hour after addition of lipids and the two curves (dotted and straight lines) represent
independent replicates of the same time course. Means ± SEM of LC-MS measurements (n=2) are plotted
for (A) Sa (d17:0), (B) So (d17:1), (C) dihydroceramide (d18:0/16:0), (D) ceramide (d18:1/16:0). (E)

Supplemental Materials and Methods
Caco-2 cell culture
Human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2, ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM, ThermoFisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS,
Gibco). Plates were seeded at 5 x 105 cells per 10 cm plate, incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2, and
experiments took place 48 hours after the initial seeding. For lipid competition experiments, sphinganine
(d18:0) (Avanti Polar Lipids) was added to the media at a concentration of 5 µM. Sphinganine (d17:0)
(Avanti Polar Lipids) was also added to plates at concentrations of 0 µM, 5 µM, 10 µM, 50 µM, and 100
µM. The lipid competition experiment was done in duplicate and repeated a third time using a lower
stimulating concentration of sphinganine (d18:0) of 1 µM with the addition of sphinganine (d17:0) at
concentrations of 0.5 µM, 1 µM, and 2 µM. Plates in which there was a media change but no addition of
lipid were also collected. Cell pellets from plates were collected after a 1-hour incubation and stored at 80°C.
Bacterial culturing
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron strain VPI 5482 (wild type, BTWT) and the SLMUT strains are described
in (21). SLMUT consists of BTWT with a transposon insertion in the gene BT0870, which is annotated
to have 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase activity and is homologous to a gene with serine palmitoyl
transferase (SPT) activity in Bacteroides fragilis (22) and the known SPT in yeast. The insertion is in a
position 88% from the start of the gene. Unless otherwise stated, BTWT and SLMUT strains used in
experiments described below were grown under anaerobic conditions at 37°C in either chopped meat
broth (ThermoFisher Scientific/Remel), supplemented brain heart infusion media (BHIS), or a minimal
medium with glucose as the sole carbon source (MMG) (31). The minimal medium consisted of, per L:
13.6 g KH2PO4, 0.875g NaCl, 1.125 g (NH4)2SO4, 5 g glucose, (pH to 7.2 with concentrated NaOH), 1

mL hemin solution (500 mg dissolved in 10 mL of 1M NaOH then diluted to final volume of 500 mL
with water), 1 mL MgCl2 (0.1M in water), 1 mL FeSO4x7H2O (1 mg per 10 mL of water), 1 mL vitamin
K3 (1 mg/mL in absolute ethanol), 1 mL CaCl2 (0.8% w/v), 250 µL vitamin B12 solution (0.02 mg/mL).
Generation of BT0870 knockout strain (Δ0870-SLMUT)
To generate an in-frame deletion of BT0870 in B. thetaiotaomicron, the strain B. thetaiotaomicron VPI5482 tdk was used as previously described (32). Two 800-1000 bp regions, each flanking the gene to be
deleted, were PCR-amplified (NEB Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase) and cloned into EcoRVHF and NotI-HF linearized pExchange_tdk. Strains and primers are listed in Table S3. The assembled
construct was transformed into E. coli S17-1 λpir (Biomedal), plated on LB agar-streptomycin-carbenicillin
plates, and transformants screened for incorporation of the plasmid. Final concentrations of antibiotics and
selection agents were as follows: erythromycin 25 µg/ml, gentamicin 200 µg/ml, streptomycin 100 µg/ml,
carbenicillin 100 µg/ml, FUdR 200 µg/ml. To conjugate, recipient and donor cells were inoculated from
overnight cultures (B. thetaiotaomicron tdk at 1:1000; E. coli transformant at 1:250) and grown to early
exponential phase (OD600 0.2-0.3), upon which the donor and recipient strains were combined in a 1:1
ratio and centrifuged for 20 min at 4000 RPM at room temperature. The bacterial pellet was resuspended
in 100 µl BHIS, plated as a puddle on BHIS-10% defibrinated sheep blood agar plates, and incubated
aerobically at 37°C for 20 hours. The conjugation puddle was then scraped, serially diluted in PBS, and
incubated aerobically at 37°C on BHIS-10% defibrinated sheep blood-gentamicin-erythromycin agar
plates. Colonies were screened for merodiploids via PCR, cultured overnight in liquid BHIS, and serially
diluted onto BHIS-10% defibrinated sheep blood-gentamicin-FUdR agar plates. Colonies were PCR
screened for deletion of the gene and confirmed via Sanger sequencing. This strain is differentiated from
the transposon insertion mutant (SLMUT) as Δ0870-SLMUT and was used in the high-fat diet feeding
experiments (below).
Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)
To resolve sphingolipid species, lipid extracts were spotted on non-fluorescent 20 x 20 cm glass backed
silica plates (Millipore Sigma) and separated using a 65:25:4 Chloroform: Methanol: Ammonium
Hydroxide solvent system for 25 minutes. A standard composed of sphingosine (d18:1), ceramide
(d18:1/12:0), and sphingomyelin (d18:1/12:0) (Avanti Polar Lipids) was used to identify spots. All plates
were developed in an iodine chamber overnight.
Inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis in BTWT
BTWT and SLMUT were grown in BHIS supplemented with 1µM of myriocin (Sigma-Aldrich), an
inhibitor of SPT, to inhibit de novo sphingolipid synthesis. Lack of sphingolipid species in SLMUT was
confirmed by both liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and TLC analysis of lipid extracts
(Fig. S2A-C).
Outer membrane vesicle (OMV) preparation
BTWT and SLMUT cultures were separated into fractions (whole cell, cell membranes, outer membrane
vehicles (OMVs)) and sphingolipid composition was evaluated by LC-MS. To separate the cell fraction
(for whole cells and membranes) from the supernatant fraction (for OMVs), 100 mL of 18-hr bacterial
cultures grown at 37°C in minimal media were spun at 3220 x g for 20 min, the supernatant was moved to
a clean tube, and the spin repeated. To prepare OMVs, the supernatant was filtered twice using a 0.22 µm
pore membrane (Corning Inc.). 60 mL of each culture was spun at 140,000 x g for 2 hours at 4°C. OMV
pellets were washed in PBS and spun at 140,000 x g for 2 hours at 4°C, then resuspended in 100 µL PBS
and stored at -80°C prior to lipid extraction. Purity of the OMV fraction was confirmed by negatively
staining the OMV preparation and imaging by transmission electron microscopy at the Cornell Center for
Materials Research at Cornell University. For membrane extraction, half of each bacterial pellet was
resuspended in 10 mL membrane extraction buffer (MEB; 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM

MgCl2, pH 8.0). The suspension was sonicated in 2 x 30 second intervals, then spun 500 x g for 10
minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was spun at 140,000 x g for 2 hours at 4°C, then the membrane fraction
pellet was washed in PBS and respun at 140,000 x g for 2 hours at 4°C. Pellets were resuspended in 1 mL
PBS and stored at -80°C prior to lipid extraction (33). Lipids were extracted from each fraction using the
method of Bligh and Dyer (34) and acid-base treated as described below (“Measurement of total
sphingolipid levels using acid base hydrolysis”). Lipid films were resuspended in 1:1
dichloromethane:methanol prior to analysis by LC-MS.
Caco-2 transwell incubation with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron strains
To assess the effects of metabolite transfer from BTWT to intestinal epithelial cells, Caco-2 cells were
incubated with BTWT and SLMUT in tissue culture dishes (Corning Inc.), wherein bacterial cells were
placed on a 0.4 µM filter situated 1 mm above the monolayer of Caco-2 cells. 50 mL cultures (OD600 of
0.25) grown in minimal medium supplemented with 25 µM palmitic acid alkyne (PAA, Cayman
Chemical) were washed 3 times in PBS and resuspended in 6 mL of 10% FBS in DMEM. 1 mL of
bacterial suspension was added to upper-well inserts of the 6-well transwell culture dished. Contents of
the upper bacterial insert and the lower Caco-2 cell filled plate were collected 4 hours after the addition of
the bacteria. Alkyne-containing metabolites in bacterial and Caco-2 cells (plated on UV-sterilized #1.5
glass coverslips in 6-well plates) were labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 using the Click iT cell reaction buffer
kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Bacterial cells were mounted onto glass slides and imaged on a LSM 710
confocal microscope (Zeiss).
RNA-seq of Caco-2 cells in transwell with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron strains throughout an 8-hour
time course
RNA was isolated from Caco-2 cells incubated in transwell plates with BTWT or SLMUT cultures using
the Trizol reagent (ThermoFisher) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were collected from
BTWT and SLMUT conditions over an 8-hour time period (0, 1, 2, 4, 8 hours) and the time course was
performed twice. The NEB Next Ultra RNA library kit for Illumina (NEB) was used to prepare
sequencing libraries, which were sequenced using 50 bp single end reads on the Illumina HiSeq 2500
platform. The 18 libraries (duplicates of BTWT and SLMUT 1, 2, 4, and 8-hour timepoints (16 libraries)
in addition to duplicates of the time 0 timepoint (2 libraries)) were multiplexed using Illumina barcodes
and read across two lanes of a flow cell (9 libraries per lane) for a total of 474,824,584 reads and an
average of 26,379,143 reads per sample. Reads were mapped to the human genome using the STAR
aligner (35) with an average of 85% (range 80 – 87%) of total sequenced reads mapping to the
transcriptome. Whole transcriptome analysis of differential expression patterns over the time course was
done using the maSigPro package implemented in R (36). Analysis of the expression of sphingolipid
processing genes was done with a set of 107 manually curated genes from gene ontology categories
involved in sphingolipid, ceramide, sphingosine, or sphingomyelin metabolism and are detailed in Table
S3. For heatmaps, expression values were averaged across replicates and genes with a greater than 2-fold
change in normalized expression values are visualized in Fig. 2D.
Animal experiments
All experiments involving animals were performed according to Protocol #2010-0065 approved by the
Cornell University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All gavages of bacterial cultures were
prepared from overnight cultures washed and resuspended in sterile PBS and administered in a volume of
0.2 mL at a concentration of 108 CFU/mL unless otherwise noted.
Daily gavage of BTWT into mice to visualize transfer of fluorescently labeled bacterial lipids to mouse
epithelial cells
5-6-week old female germfree Swiss Webster (GF SW) (Taconic Biosciences) were purchased and
shipped to Cornell University, where they were allowed to acclimate for 48 hours in their shipper. Upon
removal from the shipper, mice were either immediately sacrificed or gavaged with overnight cultures of

BTWT grown in MMG supplemented with 25 µM PAA. Mice were then housed 3 – 4 mice per cage and
fed an autoclaved breeder diet (5021 LabDiet) ad-libitum. Mice were gavaged daily with the same dose of
PAA-labeled BTWT for 4 additional days until sacrifice. On the day of sacrifice, mice were fasted for 6
hours then gavaged with PAA-labeled BTWT (as above) 1 hour before sacrifice. Intestinal tissue was
harvested for confocal imaging as described below.
Bacterial cells: Alkyne containing metabolites in bacterial cells (plated on UV-sterilized #1.5 glass
coverslips in 6-well plates) were labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 using the Click iT cell reaction buffer kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Bacterial cells were mounted onto glass slides and imaged on an LSM 710
confocal microscope (Zeiss).
Animal tissue: At the time of sacrifice, small intestinal tissue was cut into three equal sections. Then, 4
cm of tissue from the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, in addition to the whole length of the colon were
embedded in O.C.T media and snap-frozen using isopentane and liquid N2. Blocks were cryosectioned
into 8 µm sections, set and fixed on a glass slide using 4% paraformaldehyde. Slides were stained using
the Click iT cell reaction buffer kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) and imaged on an LSM 710 confocal
microscope (Zeiss) at the Cornell University Biotechnology Resource Center.
Daily gavage of BTWT to GF mice to measure hepatic portal vein blood uptake of sphingolipids
To assess intestinal sphingolipid uptake, 5-week GF SW mice (Taconic Biosciences) were allowed to
acclimate for 2 days in their germfree shipping container. After this acclimation period, mice were either
immediately sacrificed or gavaged with BTWT cultures grown overnight in MMG. Mice were housed in
sterile filter top plastic cages under specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions and sacrificed 6 hours postgavage on day 1, and 7 of the experiment. Blood was collected from the hepatic portal vein by
euthanizing the mice using CO2 followed by cervical dislocation. Heparin (100 uL - 30 IU/mL, Sigma)
was added to the cavity before nicking the hepatic portal vein and blood was collected using a Pasteur
pipet. Hepatic portal vein blood was frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80°C.
Monoassociation of GF mice with BTWT or SLMUT
GF SW mice were bred in-house and caged in rigid sterile isolators. Mice (females, 3-4 weeks old) were
transferred to flexible bubble isolators and inoculated with either BTWT or SLMUT by oral gavage. Mice
were housed 3 – 4 per cage, fed an autoclaved breeder diet (5021, LabDiet) ad-libitum and sterility was
checked biweekly. Mice were sacrificed 6 weeks after inoculation. After decapitation, livers, PBS flushed
ileum tissue, and cecal contents were collected, flash frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80°C until
processed for sphingolipid analysis. Colonization efficiency was monitored by determining the colony
forming units per gram (CFU/g) of cecal content of sacrificed mice. 50 mg of cecal content per sample (7
samples per condition) was weighted and added to 1 mL of BHIS. Serial dilutions (1:10) of the slurry
were made to the dilution 1:108. Serial dilutions were plated on BHIS agar plates and incubated at 37°C in
an anaerobic chamber overnight before counting colonies.
Germfree, conventionalized, and conventionally-raised mice used in hepatic sphingolipid profiling
Germfree: GF SW mice (female) were bred in-house and caged in rigid sterile isolators. GF mice were
sacrificed at 5 weeks of age.
Conventionalized mice: 5-week old female GF SW mice were inoculated with 0.2 mL of fecal slurry
made from 3 mouse pellets homogenized in 3 mL of sterile PBS. Pellets were obtained from SPF Swiss
Webster mice housed in the conventional corridor of the Cornell Mouse Facility. Conventionalized mice
were housed in sterile filter top cages and sacrificed a week after colonization.
Conventionally raised: 5-week old conventionally-raised female mice were obtained from litters two
generations after breeding pairs from the germfree colony had been conventionalized.
For all mice: after euthanasia by decapitation, livers were collected, flash frozen in liquid N2 and stored at
-80°C until processed for sphingolipid analysis.

from protein - 23%, carbohydrates - 53%, fat - 24%) or a fatty acid free diet (TD.03314 Teklad: calories
from protein - 24%, carbohydrates - 76%, fat - 0%) ad-libitum for 21 days while housed in SPF
conditions with 2 to 5 mice per cage. Mice were gavaged with BTWT or SLMUT 24 hours before
sacrifice, and then again prior to fasting (6 hours before sacrifice). After decapitation, livers were
collected, flash frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80°C until processed for sphingolipid analysis.
Insulin-resistant mice administered BTWT or SLMUT
7-week old male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory) on a chow diet (Diet 5001, LabDiet) were gavaged
with BTWT or SLMUT for 7 days and then placed on a high-fat diet (HFD; D12492, Research diet, Inc.).
Mice were then gavaged for 7 additional days with BTWT and SLMUT and kept on the HFD for an
additional 21 days. When mice were then switched back to a chow diet and gavaged daily with BTWT or
SLMUT for 9 days before sacrifice. All gavages were 0.2 mL of cultures of BTWT or Δ0870-SLMUT
(108 CFU/mL) grown in BHIS and washed in PBS. Glucose and insulin tolerance were measured weekly
and directly before sacrifice. Briefly, mice were fasted for 5h and fasting glucose level were determined
using a Nova Max plus Glucose meter. Then mice were injected with 2mg of glucose/gm of body weight
or 0.5 U insulin/kg of body weight and blood glucose levels were measured at 30, 60, 90 min after
injection. Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation and livers were frozen in liquid N2 until processed
for sphingolipid analysis.
Lipid extractions
Liver, Ileum and Colon sample preparations - Liver, ileum, and colon tissue were all homogenized in
PBS using tubes with sterile 1 mm zirconium beads (OPS diagnostics) in a bead beater homogenizer
(BioSpec products) for 2 minutes. Intestinal tissue was placed on ice and then subjected to another round
of bead beating to ensure homogeneity of the sample. Protein concentrations of homogenates were
measured using a Lowry protein assay (BioRad) and equal concentrations of samples were loaded on to
96-well plates for lipid extractions. Liver samples were extracted in 1:1 dichoromethane:methanol
according to the details below with 400 – 800 µg of protein per sample while colon and ileum samples
were extracted with 100 – 200 µg of protein per sample.
Hepatic Portal Vein Blood sample preparations - Hepatic portal vein whole blood (150 µL) was loaded
on to 96-well plates for lipid extraction.
Cecal tissue preparations - Cecal tissues were weighed before lipids were extracted according to the
Folch method (37) in 4 mL of 2:1 chloroform:methanol. After 2 hours of constant vortexing on a plate
vortexer, 800 µL of 0.9% sodium chloride in water solution was added to the extraction. Samples were
briefly vortexed again before spinning samples at 2000 x g for 15 minutes to separate the aqueous and
organic phases. The lower organic phase was then transferred to a new tube where 800 µL of 0.9 %
sodium chloride was added in order to ensure an organic phase free of cecal debris. These extractions
were spun again at 2000 x g for 15 minutes and the organic phase was transferred to a glass tube and
dried under nitrogen gas. The remaining lipids were weighed and resuspended at an equal concentration
for subsequent mass spectrometry analysis.
Cell culture sample preparations - Cell pellets were resuspended in 100 µL of PBS and protein
concentrations were assessed using the Lowry method. Equal amounts of cell suspension as measured by
protein concentration (100 – 150 µg) were loaded onto 96 well plates for sphingolipid extractions.
Bacterial culture sample preparations - Bacterial cell pellets were washed and resuspended in PBS and
protein concentrations were assessed using the Lowry method. Equal amounts of cell suspension as
measured by protein concentration were loaded onto 96 well plates for sphingolipid extractions.
Sphingolipid extraction - All samples loaded onto 96-well plates had 50 µL of 1 µM C12 ceramide
(d18:1/12:0) (Avanti Polar Lipids) added as an internal standard and 50 µL of 10% diethylamide diluted

in methanol. For the lipid extraction, 450 µL of 1:1 dichloromethane:methanol was added to each sample
and vortexed overnight on a plate shaker. After the overnight incubation, an additional 900 µL of 1:1
dichloromethane:methanol was added to the samples and incubated on a plate rotator for an additional
hour before spinning samples at 2000 x g for 15 minutes to separate cell debris from the lipid extracts.
The supernatant was transferred to a new 96-well plate for analysis by mass spectrometry as detailed
below.
Measurement of total sphingolipid levels using acid base hydrolysis
Blood samples and microbial cultures were broken down to their sphingolipid long chain base backbones
using harsh acid and base treatment to obtain estimates of total sphingolipid levels using the methods
outlined in (38). In brief, equal volume of hepatic portal vein blood (150 µL per experiment) or protein
normalized microbial cultures were added to 500 µL of methanol supplemented with 4 µM of 1deoxysphinganine-D3 (C18H36D3NO) (Avanti Polar Lipids) and vortexed on a plate vortexer for 1 hour.
Samples were then spun down at 21130 x g in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes to remove cell debris.
Supernatants were transferred to polypropylene tubes and 75 µL of concentrated hydrochloric acid was
added before incubating the samples overnight (16-20 hours) at 65°C. After overnight incubation,
concentrated potassium chloride (10M) was added to samples and a lipid extraction using chloroform was
used to extract hydrolyzed sphingolipids. The organic phase of the lipid extraction was dried under
nitrogen gas and resuspended in 200 µL of 1:1 dichloromethane:methanol before adding C12 ceramide
(d18:1/12:0) (Avanti Polar Lipids) internal standard to samples on a 96 well plate and analyzing
sphingolipid levels by mass spectrometry.
Lipidomic profiling
Sphingolipid abundance was measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).
Specifically, 4 µl of lipid extract from each sample was injected into an Agilent 1200 HPLC (Agilent
Poroshell 120 column) linked to an Agilent 6430 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Mobile phase A
consisted of methanol/water/chloroform/formic acid (55:40:5:0.4 v/v); Mobile phase B consists of
methanol/acetonitrile/chloroform/formic acid (48:48:4:0.4 v/v). After pre-equilibration for 6 sec, the
gradient gradually increases to 60% mobile phase B and 100% mobile phase B that is held for 1.9 min.
Flow rate was 0.6 mL/min. The duration of a run was 9.65 min. Ions were fragmented using electrospray
ionization in positive mode and selective reaction monitoring (SRM) allowed for the detection of
sphingolipid specific transitions. Peak calls and abundance calculations were done using MassHunter
Workstation Software Version B.06.00 SP01/Build 6.0.388.1 (Agilent). Final concentrations of samples
were calculated from a standard curve for each sphingolipid (Table S2). For Sa (d17:0) base metabolites,
no standard curve was available and the response of the mass spectrometer normalized to the standard
(Ceramide (d18:1/12:0)) was used for abundance calculations.
Statistical Analyses
All data are represented as the mean ± SEM unless otherwise noted. Statistical tests are denoted in figure
legends and were implemented using Prism 7.0 (GraphPad) or using the Tukey C, nlme, and multcomp
packages implemented in R.
