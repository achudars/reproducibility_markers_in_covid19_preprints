Abstract
Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a candidate mechanism for information storage in the
brain. However, it has been practically impossible to assess the long-term consequences of STDP as
recordings from postsynaptic neurons last at most one hour. We assessed both the short-term (20
minutes) and long-term (3 days) effects of optically-induced STDP (oSTDP) using two colors of light to
independently activate CA3 and CA1 neurons expressing the opsins ChrimsonR and CheRiff. During
patch-clamp recordings short-term effects followed classic STDP rules, synapses potentiated when
postsynaptic spikes followed presynaptic spikes (tLTP, causal pairing) and depressed when
postsynaptic spikes were first (tLTD, anti-causal pairing). Surprisingly, three days after inducing
oSTDP without patching the neurons, tLTP was evident regardless of pairing sequence. Potentiation
depended on NMDA receptors and spontaneous activity was necessary in the two days following
oSTDP. Our data suggest that tLTD at Schaffer collateral synapses is a transitory phenomenon or a
recording artifact.

Introduction

2

Synaptic strength changes after coincident activity in the pre- and postsynaptic neurons, a process

3

commonly referred to as spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP)1. In classical STDP, timing-

4

dependent long-term potentiation (tLTP) is induced when synaptic responses precede postsynaptic

5

action potentials, i.e. causal or Hebbian pairing. In contrast, timing-dependent long-term depression

6

(tLTD) is induced when synaptic responses follow postsynaptic action potentials, i.e. anti-causal

7

pairing2–4. While STDP is an attractive model for how memories may be formed1,5–7, experiments are

8

usually limited to 20-60 minutes, a time frame that is clearly not relevant for most forms of memory.

9

This time limitation arises from the invasive nature of intracellular recordings, which are necessary to

10

control postsynaptic spiking. We have followed individual CA1 pyramidal neuron spine synapses for a

11

week after inducing LTP or LTD and observed that their stability is enhanced after LTP and decreases

12

following LTD8,9. However, pairs of CA3-CA1 neurons may have multiple synaptic contacts and new

13

connections may form, leaving what happens to the overall connection strength an open question

14

we sought to answer.

15

The channelrhodopsins are ion channels that open in response to light, and since the discovery of

16

channelrhodopsin-210 have been widely used to stimulate neurons with light in vitro and in vivoe.g. 11–

17

18

18

kinetics, spectral sensitivities and ion selectivity19–23. We reasoned that using opsins with rapid

19

kinetics and sensitive to different wavelengths of light, we could circumvent the need for

20

intracellular/patch-clamp recordings and optically induce ‘no-patch’ STDP. Here, we present a two-

21

color method to stimulate precisely timed action potentials in defined subsets of CA3 and CA1

22

pyramidal neurons for optogenetic induction of STDP (oSTDP). Whereas oSTDP induced classical tLTP

23

and tLTD in short-term patch-clamp experiments, the outcome after 3 days was strong tLTP

24

regardless of the activation sequence. Our findings support the conclusion that the short and long-

25

term consequences of STDP are different.

26

Results

27

ChrimsonR and CheRiff are suitable for optogenetic STDP. To achieve our goal of independently

28

spiking pre- and postsynaptic neurons, we reasoned that the red light sensitive ChrimsonR20 and the

29

blue/violet light-sensitive CheRiff19 were the most promising pair of channelrhodopsins. ChrimsonR-

30

tdTomato was expressed in a small subset of CA3 pyramidal neurons by local virus injection and

31

several CA1 neurons were electroporated with DNA encoding CheRiff-eGFP (Fig. 1a). In order to

32

visualize CheRiff-expressing CA1 neurons (hereafter referred to as CheRiff-CA1 neurons) without

. In recent years, many channelrhodopsin variants have been discovered or engineered with varying

33

activating them we also included DNA encoding mKate2 in our electroporation mix. We waited 7-10

34

days for expression of both channelrhodopsins before starting the experiments.

58

Action potentials (APs) evoked by light stimulation of channelrhodopsin2 are prolonged relative to

59

electrically-evoked APs13. As depolarization-induced increases in postsynaptic calcium are critical for

60

plasticity, prolonged light-induced depolarization of the postsynaptic CA1 neurons would be

61

expected to affect STDP24,25. We therefore compared electrically and light-evoked APs in CheRiff-CA1

62

pyramidal neurons (Fig. 1b, c). Importantly, using light to drive spiking in CheRiff-CA1 neurons did not

63

greatly prolong AP depolarization relative to APs driven by current injection. The AP amplitude and

64

half-widths were similar suggesting that driving APs with 405 nm light in CA1 neurons would not alter

65

STDP timing rules.

66

As the threshold for light-induced APs is not only opsin dependent but also depends on expression

67

levels and cell type, we performed a detailed analysis of the spectral sensitivity of ChrimsonR-CA3

68

and CheRiff-CA1 pyramidal neurons (Supplementary Fig. 1). According to this spectral analysis, we

69

selected 405 nm (1.2 mW mm-2) to activate CheRiff-CA1 neurons and 625 nm (8 mW mm-2) to

70

activate ChrimsonR-CA3 neurons which reliably and selectively spiked CA3 or CA1 pyramidal neurons

71

using 2 ms flashes (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 1d). Although 405 nm light partially activates

72

ChrimsonR, it did not spike ChrimsonR-CA3 neurons at 1 mW mm-2 (depolarization 0-3 mV, Fig. 1c,

73

Supplementary Fig. 1b, d). Importantly, red light (625 nm) caused no photocurrents in CheRiff-CA1

74

neurons at intensities up to 100 mW mm-2 nor did the yellow epifluorescence light used to visualize

75

mKate2 (Fig 1c, Supplementary Fig.1a). Thus, we never inadvertently depolarized the postsynaptic

76

CheRiff-CA1 neurons (i.e. cultures were never exposed to light below 565 nm except during pairing).

77

oSTDP follows the short-term timing rules of classical STDP. We recorded baseline EPSCs in CheRiff-

78

or non-transfected CA1 neurons (whole-cell voltage clamp at -70 mV) while optogenetically

79

stimulating the ChrimsonR-CA3 neurons at 20 second intervals, by illuminating their somata with a

80

condenser-coupled26 orange (594 nm) laser (Fig. 1e and f). Condenser-coupled illumination was used

81

as CA3 was outside the field of view of the objective when we patched the CA1 pyramidal neurons.

82

After collecting the baseline for 5 minutes in voltage-clamp we switched to current-clamp mode.

83

Single presynaptic spikes (300 orange/red flashes at 5 Hz, see methods) were paired with spike

84

bursts in the postsynaptic neuron (3 flashes at 50 Hz, 405 nm). Causal pairing, when the EPSP

85

preceded the first postsynaptic spike by about 10 ms, resulted in significant potentiation of EPSCs in

86

7 of 12 experiments (Fig. 1g and i). Anti-causal pairing, when postsynaptic spikes preceded EPSPs by

87

about 10 ms, significantly depressed EPSCs in 3 of 11 experiments (Fig. 1h and i). The outcomes after

88

causal and anti-causal pairing were significantly different (p = 0.003, Kolmogorov-Smirnov). The light

89

stimulation used for causal pairing had no overall effect in non-transfected neurons (median = 1.06,

90

Fig 1i), indicating that oSTDP was specific to CheRiff-CA1 neurons. Evidently, using light to induce

91

timed action potentials in pre- and postsynaptic neurons produces oSTDP with similar timing rules as

92

when action potentials are triggered by electrical stimulation2,3,24,25,27–30.

93

No-patch oSTDP induction in the incubator. Having established conditions for inducing oSTDP, we

94

constructed illumination towers, each containing independently controlled, collimated, red (630 nm)

95

and violet (405 nm) high-power LEDs so that ChrimsonR and CheRiff-expressing neurons could be

96

stimulated in the incubator with defined light intensities (Fig. 2a). At the chosen intensities,

97

ChrimsonR and CheRiff-expressing neurons followed the 5 Hz stimulation pattern (single APs in CA3,

98

50 Hz triplets in CA1) with precise timing and high reliability (Fig. 2b, c). Non-transfected CA1 neurons

99

showed only EPSPs as expected (Fig. 2d).

100

Still, we were concerned about the specificity of postsynaptic activation. If synchronous activation of

101

ChrimsonR-CA3 neurons in the incubator directly drove CA1 neurons to fire APs, Hebbian plasticity

102

may be induced in all CA1 neurons and would no longer be contingent on light-induced spiking of the

103

CheRiff-CA1 neurons31. To test for potential burst firing of non-transfected neurons, we investigated

104

cFos activation patterns in cultures stimulated with the causal pairing protocol32. We found that

105

when the number of ChrimsonR-CA3 neurons in the slice was 53 or less, no cFos staining was seen in

106

CA1 neurons that were not expressing CheRiff (5/5 slices, 36-53 ChrimsonR-CA3 neurons). Given that

107

CheRiff-CA1 neurons were directly driven by the 405 nm light to burst fire, they did show cFos

108

staining (Fig. 2e). In 2 slices with 60-61 ChrimsonR-CA3 neurons, 7-10 untransfected CA1 neurons

109

showed cFos staining, indicating that CA3 stimulation at 5 Hz was directly driving some CA1 neurons

110

to burst fire. When the number of ChrimsonR-CA3 neurons increased to 96 or more, cFos staining

111

was evident throughout the entire CA1 (2/2 slices, not shown). In CA3, no cFos was detected in the

112

ChrimsonR-CA3 neurons driven with light at 5 Hz (Supplementary Fig. 2, 9/9 slices), but burst firing of

113

ChrimsonR-CA3 neurons, which was not part of our oSTDP protocols, did induce cFos in 39 ± 6% of

114

these neurons and in about the same number of non-transfected CA3 neurons (Supplementary Fig. 3,

115

6 slices). Thus, we aimed to transduce 20-30 ChrimsonR-CA3 neurons with a localized AAV injection

116

to avoid driving burst firing of postsynaptic CA1 neurons during oSTDP stimulation.

130

No difference in input strength 3 hours after no-patch oSTDP. In cultures that were not previously

131

stimulated with light, we activated ChrimsonR-CA3 neurons with brief light pulses, sequentially

132

recording EPSCs in several CA1 neurons (Fig. 3a, b). These recordings and all following were

133

performed blind to the treatment group. The relative synaptic input strength onto the CheRiff-CA1

134

neurons was calculated by dividing the average EPSC slope, by the slope of the combined average

135

EPSC recorded from at least 3 non-transfected neurons (Fig. 3c). The median input strength of

136

CheRiff-CA1 neurons from cultures that were not previously stimulated with light was 0.91 (Fig. 3d,

137

no pairing; mean = 1.04, CV = 0.53). Thus, in control conditions (without paired light stimulation)

138

CheRiff-CA1 and neighboring CA1 neurons received equivalent input from the ChrimsonR-CA3

139

neurons. Somewhat surprisingly, when assessed about 3 hours after oSTDP induction, input strength

140

was not significantly changed by either causal or anti-causal pairing, although a trend towards

141

potentiation after causal pairing was apparent (Fig. 3d, -10 ms median = 1.04; +10 ms median = 1.62).

142

Input strength is potentiated three days after no-patch oSTDP. Three days after oSTDP causally-

143

paired CheRiff-CA1 neurons received significantly stronger input (Fig. 3e, +10 ms: median = 2.13,

144

mean = 2.95, CV = 0.69). Interestingly, anti-causal pairing also resulted in stronger inputs (Fig. 3e, -10

145

ms: median = 1.8, mean = 2.51, CV = 0.89). The time interval between EPSPs and postsynaptic spikes

146

was important, as input strength did not change significantly when Δt was +50 ms (Fig. 3e, +50 ms:

147

median = 0.97, mean = 2.44, CV = 1.18; -50 ms: median = 1.78, mean = 2.38, CV = 0.66). Coincident

148

activity of pre- and postsynaptic neurons was an absolute requirement for oSTDP as input strength

149

was unchanged 3 days after burst firing of the postsynaptic neurons alone (Fig. 3e, post only). We

150

found no differences between CheRiff- and non-transfected CA1 neurons in cellular parameters or

151

excitability (Supplementary Fig. 4). This strongly suggests that 3 days after oSTDP, tLTP was not due

152

to increased postsynaptic excitability33–35. Thus, oSTDP triggered lasting changes in relative input

153

strength that could be read-out 3 days later.

neurons of the non-paired slices (hollow grey points, n = 11). ‘Timing’ is the target interval between start of the

after pairing. Post only: only violet light flashes (n’s left to right = 7, 10, 24, 25, 10). f, As in d except the
repetition frequency was reduced to 0.1 Hz (n’s left to right = 7, 14). The NMDA antagonist CPPene was in the
culture medium during pairing (+CPP, 1 µM, n = 14). In all cumulative frequency plots the non-paired group was
added as reference. P values (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) are vs no pairing group. g, The median input strength (% no
pairing median) plotted relative to the light-induced EPSPs (arrows) and action potential timings (vertical ticks
on colored bars) during oSTDP pairing (data from e, brown +50 ms, violet -50 ms, cyan -10 ms, magenta +10
ms). Two cycles (of 300) at 5 Hz are illustrated.

175

As for STDP2,3,24,25,28, tLTP induced in the incubator was abolished when NMDA receptors were

176

blocked during pairing (Fig. 3f, +CPP). Reducing the pairing frequency from 5 Hz to 0.1 Hz also

177

prevented plasticity induction (Fig. 3f, 0.1 Hz), in line with previous studies27.

178

No depression after no-patch oSTDP. It was unexpected that anti-causal pairing of pre- and

179

postsynaptic spikes did not decrease the input strength when assessed 3 hours or 3 days later (Fig.

180

3d, e). As the stimulation was repeated every 200 ms, the tested timings covered all possible phase

181

shifts between pre- and postsynaptic activity (Fig. 3g). The absence of tLTD was particularly surprising

182

because during patch-clamp recordings, causal and anti-causal oSTDP clearly had opposite effects on

183

EPSCs (Fig. 1g-i). As the distribution of input strengths following anti-causal pairing (-10 ms) appeared

184

rather bimodal, we tested pairing protocols of different length in an attempt to uncover the expected

185

depression27. However, while 30 anti-causal pairings at 5 Hz did not induce any plasticity, all stronger

186

protocols (100 to 500 repeats at 5 Hz) increased input strength (Supplementary Fig. 5). Thus, tLTD

187

was observed only at short time points (20 min) during patch-clamp recordings, and was not

188

observed at later time points when the CA1 neurons were not patched during oSTDP induction.

189

Activity level in the slice is important for long term potentiation. We were intrigued that the

190

strength of causally paired CA3-CA1 connections seemed to increase in the days following plasticity

191

induction, since no additional external stimulation was provided during the incubation period. We

192

reasoned that after oSTDP, circuits containing potentiated synapses might develop higher levels of

193

spontaneous spiking in the incubator, increasing re-activation of the synapses between the paired

194

CA3 and CA1 neurons35,36. We either globally disturbed activity by completely changing the slice

195

culture medium 3-4 hours after oSTDP or suppressed activity by including tetrodotoxin in the fresh

196

medium. Both manipulations prevented potentiation of the synapses from ChrimsonR-CA3 to

197

CheRiff-CA1 neurons (Fig 4). These experiments indicate that the synaptic memory of a short episode

198

of coincident activity was actively maintained and amplified in the cultures, pointing to a process that

requires replay of activity patterns in the selected circuits.

Discussion

209

By independently activating pre- and postsynaptic neurons with light, we observed that the

210

relationship between spike-EPSP timing and the direction of synaptic plasticity is different at short

211

(20 min) and long (3 day) timescales. Whereas at short time scales, anti-causal and causal pairing

212

respectively depressed and potentiated synapses, three days later synapses were potentiated

213

regardless of the ~10 ms pairing order. Late oSTDP still has a strong dependence on timing as when

214

the EPSP preceded the APs by 50 ms, no plasticity was induced. The requirement for active NMDA

215

receptors during the pairing suggests that elevated intracellular [Ca2+] in the postsynaptic neurons

216

was an essential part of the induction process as has been demonstrated for ‘classical’ short term

217

STDP24. In addition, late oSTDP exhibited similar frequency-dependence to that reported for the CA3-

218

CA1 synapses used in this study27. At a pairing repetition rate of 5 Hz tLTP was observed, but not

219

when the pairing rate was reduced to 0.1 Hz.

220

We chose the 3 day time point for our long-term readout because it allowed us to exchange the slice

221

culture medium for the last time 24-48 hours before oSTDP induction and avoid disturbing the

222

cultures before the readout. In addition to the time of the readout, there are other methodological

223

differences between our observations 20 min and 3 days after oSTDP that should be considered. The

224

data obtained 20 min after oSTDP were from individual whole-cell recordings and synaptic strength

225

post-pairing was compared to the strength at baseline. Three days later, the reference was not to

226

baseline but to neighboring neurons. Potentiation would be apparent either if the synapses onto the

227

CheRiff-CA1 neurons became stronger or if the synapses onto the non-transfected neurons

228

weakened. Although we cannot rule out the second explanation, we favor the first. Another

229

important difference is that in the short term experiments the postsynaptic neurons were recorded

230

from with whole-cell patch-clamp electrodes. Care was taken to begin the oSTDP induction within 10

231

minutes of obtaining whole-cell access as it is well-known that washout of important cellular

232

components can prevent plasticity37. STDP studies using sharp electrodes or perforated patch

233

recordings, which minimize washout of intracellular contents, have reported both tLTD and tLTP but

234

cannot rule out an effect of the recordings per se38,39. Thus, the act of patching the postsynaptic

235

neurons during induction with the partial washout of cellular contents might artificially uncover tLTD.

236

Because of the time it takes to transfer and settle a slice in the recording chamber and to record

237

EPSCs from the minimum four neurons per slice, we could not obtain data after stimulating in the

238

incubator sooner than 1-3 hours after oSTDP. At this earliest obtainable time point after no-patch

239

oSTDP, there was no statistically significant difference in synaptic input onto the CheRiff-CA1

240

neurons. The variability of synaptic inputs from the ChrimsonR-CA3 neurons might be too large to

241

allow detection of a modest increase in synaptic strength at this early time point. Ongoing

242

reactivation of these synapses during the following days appears necessary to increase sufficiently

243

their strength relative to their neighbors for the potentiation to be detectable. Although there is

244

spontaneous activity in slice cultures, strongly increasing the overall activity shortly after oSTDP

245

prevented the potentiation, as did blocking all activity. We hypothesize that slight differences in

246

synaptic strength, induced by the only structured input that was ever provided in these slice cultures,

247

were enhanced by a process akin to overfitting. In the future, it will be interesting to test this

248

hypothesis by challenging the system with a series of different activation patterns, which will require

249

a more sophisticated illumination system inside the incubator.

250

The majority of STDP studies report both potentiation and depression. ‘LTP-only’ STDP windows have

251

however, been observed at human hippocampal, human and rat neocortical synapses40,41 and in

252

mouse hippocampus27, most commonly in the presence of increased dopamine39,42. If presynaptic

253

activity is paired with prolonged postsynaptic bursts (plateau potentials), the timing window for

254

Schaffer collateral potentiation can be extended to several seconds in the causal and anti-causal

255

direction43. Explanations for these discrepant observations abound, but we speculate that if synaptic

256

strength was assessed after several days, the outcome of repeated coincident activity may always be

257

potentiation regardless of the exact temporal sequence. Conservation of total synaptic weight may

258

be provided by heterosynaptic LTD or via generalized downscaling processes44, e.g. during sleep45,46.

259

An alternative strategy to temporally separate plasticity induction and read-out is the use of

260

‘chemical’ LTP or LTD protocols. However, any attempt to potentiate (or depress) all synapses in the

261

tissue is bound to engage powerful homeostatic mechanisms to re-establish physiological levels of

262

excitation. Here we specifically induce plasticity at a small subset of synapses and can therefore

263

distinguish between plasticity-induced changes and homeostatic changes that might occur at

264

neighboring synapses.

265

In our experiments, we paired pre- and postsynaptic activity in about 30 ChrimsonR-CA3 neurons and

266

1-5 CheRiff-CA1 neurons. The increased input strength three days after oSTDP induction might reflect

267

an increase in postsynaptic excitability, an increase in the size and strength of individual pre-existing

268

synapses, an increase in the number of synaptic contacts, or a combination. There was no evidence

269

that a lasting change in excitability of the postsynaptic neuron accounts for the observed increase in

270

input strength33–35, as there were no differences in the passive and active membrane parameters

271

measured in the CheRiff- and non-transfected CA1 neurons (Supplementary Fig. 4). By extending the

272

observation time window from minutes to days, oSTDP could be combined with additional

273

techniques, such as repeated single spine calcium8, voltage or sodium imaging47, or serial electron

274

microscopy48,49 to determine whether the number or the strength of synapses is changing.

275

Methods

276

Rat organotypic hippocampal slice cultures

277

Wistar rats were housed and bred at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE)

278

animal facility and sacrificed according to German Law (Tierschutzgesetz der Bundesrepublik

279

Deutschland, TierSchG) with approval from the Behörde für Gesundheit und Verbraucherschutz

280

Hamburg and the animal care committee of the UKE. The procedure for organotypic cultures was

281

modified from Stoppini et al.50, using media without antibiotics51. Hippocampi were dissected from

282

P5-P7 pups, cut into 400 μm thick slices using a tissue chopper (McIlwain) and cultured on 30 mm

283

membrane inserts (Millicell Cell Culture Insert, pore size 0.4 μm; PICM0RG50) at 37°C with 5% CO 2.

284

Culture medium contained 79% minimum essential medium (MEM, Sigma; M7278), 20% heat-

285

inactivated horse serum (Gibco; 16050122), D-glucose (13 mM, Fluka; 49152), NaCl (109 mM, Sigma;

286

S5150-1L), MgSO4 (0.8 mM, Fluka; 63126-1L), CaCl2 (1.8 mM, Fluka; 21114-1L), L-glutamine (1 mM,

287

Gibco; 25030-024), insulin (0.01 mg ml-1, Sigma; I6634), ascorbic acid (6 μM, Fluka; 11140), pH 7.28,

288

320 mOsm kg-1. After opsins were expressing, great care was taken to protect the cultures from

289

wavelengths of light below 560 nm to prevent unintentional co-activation of ChrimsonR and CheRiff-

290

expressing neurons. Handling and normal medium changes (2/3, twice per week) were under dim

291

yellow light, which may directly depolarize ChrimsonR but not CheRiff expressing neurons (Osram

292

LUMILUX CHIP control T8).

293

Viral vector-based transduction

294

The plasmid pAAV-syn-ChrimsonR-TdTomato, a kind gift from Edward Boyden (Addgene # 59171),

295

was packaged into AAV viral particles with serotype Rh10 (7.22*1013 vg ml-1) at the Vector Core

296

facility of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. One µl was loaded into a micropipette

297

with the tip broken to ~10 µm diameter. Slice cultures (12-14 DIV) were transferred into sterile pre-

298

warmed (37 °C) HEPES-buffered solution containing: NaCl (145 mM, Sigma; S5886-500G), HEPES (10

299

mM, Sigma; H4034-100G), D-glucose (25 mM, Sigma; G7528-250G), KCl (2.5 mM, Fluka; 60121-1L),

300

MgCl2 (1 mM, Fluka; 63020-1L), CaCl2 (2 mM, Honeywell; 21114-1L), pH 7.4, 318 mOsm kg-1. The

301

virus-containing pipette was inserted into CA3 and a small bolus was pressure-ejected using 3-5

302

pressure pulses (Picospritzer: 2 bar, 80-100 ms). Our aim was to transduce approximately 30 CA3

303

neurons in CA3 with ChrimsonR. A detailed description of the viral transduction has been published52.

304

Single-cell electroporation

305

Plasmids used for electroporation were: 1) pAAV-hsyn-CheRiff-eGFP (Addgene #51697), 0.5 ng ml-1,

306

kindly provided by Adam Cohen; 2) pCI-syn-mKate2, 10 ng ml-1 was created by replacing GCaMP3 in

307

pCI-syn-GCaMP39 using hindIII and NotI with mKate2-N from pmKate2-N (Evrogen cat. # FP182).

308

Plasmids were diluted in intracellular solution containing: K-gluconate (135 mM, Sigma; G4500-

309

100G), EGTA (0.2 mM, Sigma-Aldrich; E0396-10G), HEPES (10 mM, Sigma; H4034-100G), MgCl2 (4

310

mM, Fluka; 63020-1L), Na2-ATP (4 mM, Aldrich; A26209-1G), Na-GTP (0.4 mM, Sigma; G8877-

311

100MG), Na2-phosphocreatine (10 mM, Sigma; P7936-1G), ascorbate (3 mM, Sigma; A5960-100G),

312

pH 7.2, 295 mOsm kg-1. Slice cultures were transferred to a sterile microscope chamber filled with

313

sterile 37°C HEPES-buffered solution (see viral vector-based transduction) either right after AAV

314

injection or 1 day later. Pipettes (10-15 MΩ, World Precision Instruments; TW150F-3) were filled with

315

the plasmid mixture and several pyramidal neurons in CA1 were touched and electroporated using

316

an Axoporator (25 pulses, -12 V, 500 μs, 50 Hz). A detailed description of the electroporation

317

procedure has been published53.

318

CheRiff and ChrimsonR characterization

319

For characterizing responses to multiple wavelengths, we used a pE-4000 CoolLED (CoolLED Ltd., s/n

320

CP0180) with an additional filter for 550 nm (555±20 nm) coupled through the dual camera port of

321

the electrophysiology setup described below. Light intensities in the specimen plane were measured

322

using a 918D-ST-UV sensor and 1936R power meter (Newport). Light flashes (2 ms, low to high

323

intensity) were delivered every 20s with one minute between wavelength sequences. Whole cell

324

currents were recorded (see electrophysiology below) with synaptic transmission and action

325

potentials blocked by CPPene (10 μM, Tocris bioscience; 1265), NBQX (10 μM, Tocris bioscience;

326

1044), picrotoxin (100 μM, Sigma; P1675-1G) and tetrodotoxin (1 μM, HelloBio; HB1035). Seven CA1

327

(CheRiff) and eleven CA3 (ChrimsonR) neurons were recorded from to obtain n = 4 responses at each

328

wavelength/intensity combination. Average peak light-evoked currents were determined and plotted

329

(Supplementary Fig. 1) using a self-written MATLAB code.

330

Electrophysiology and optogenetic stimulation

331

The setup was based on an Olympus BX61WI microscope fitted with Dodt contrast, epifluorescence

332

and CCD-camera (DMK23U274, The Imaging Source) on a dual camera port (see Fig. 1.e). For light

333

stimulation through the objective an LED combiner (Mightex Systems, wavelengths 625, 530, 470,

334

405 nm) was coupled via 1 mm multimode fiber and collimator (Thorlabs) mounted on one of the

335

camera ports. A 40x water immersion objective (Plan-Apochromat 1.0 NA DIC VIS-IR, Zeiss,

336

illuminated field ø 557 µm) or a 10x water immersion objective (UMPlanFL 0.30 NA W, Olympus,

337

illuminated field ø 2.65 mm) were used. Light intensities through the objectives were measured in

338

the specimen plane using a calibrated power meter (LaserCheck, Coherent or 918D-ST-UV sensor /

339

1936R power meter, Newport). To locally activate CA3 neurons, the orange (594) laser beam of an

340

Omicron Light Hub was coupled to an optical fiber fitted with a collimator (Thorlabs) mounted on a

341

lockable swing arm. This construction allowed us to point the laser beam at different angles through

342

the center of the back aperture of the oil immersion condenser (NA 1.4, Olympus) to locally

343

illuminate neurons in CA3 away (~1.5 mm) from the optical axis, with high intensity and little light

344

scattering (Fig 1e). After final laser positioning, the stage was not moved and CA1 neurons within the

345

single field of view were recorded from.

346

Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed using an Axopatch 200B (Axon Instruments, Inc.)

347

amplifier, National Instruments A/D boards and Ephus software54. All recordings, except the

348

experiments in Fig. 1g-i and 2b-d (see next section), were performed blind to slice treatment at 30°C

349

(in-line heater, Warner Instruments) in artificial cerebral spinal fluid containing: NaCl (119 mM,

350

Sigma; S5886-500G), NaHCO3 (26.2 mM, Sigma; S5761-500G), D-glucose (11 mM, Sigma; G7528-

351

250G), KCl (2.5 mM, Fluka; 60121-1L), NaH2PO4 (1 mM, Sigma; S5011-100G), MgCl2 (4 mM, Fluka;

352

63020-1L), CaCl2 (4 mM, Honeywell; 21114-1L), pH 7.4, ~310 mOsm kg-1, saturated with humidified

353

95% O2 / 5% CO2. Patch electrodes (3-4 MΩ, World Precision Instruments; 1B150F-3) were filled with

354

the same intracellular solution used for electroporation (above). Liquid junction potential was

355

measured (-14.1 to -14.4 mV) and corrected. CA1 pyramidal neurons were patched under the 40x

356

water immersion objective and voltage-clamped at -70 mV (LJP corrected). A test pulse (-5 mV, 200

357

ms) was applied at the start of every sweep. Series resistance (Rs) was less than 20 MΩ, did not

358

change more than 30% and was not compensated in voltage clamp. In current clamp we used the

359

bridge balance compensation.

360

Optogenetic induction of spike-timing dependent plasticity during whole-cell recordings

361

Eight to eleven days after virus injection and electroporation of ChrimsonR and CheRiff, slices were

362

transferred to the electrophysiology setup and perfused with slice culture medium (described above)

363

without horse serum (replaced with MEM), supplemented with D-serine (30 μM, Tocris Bioscience;

364

0226) and diluted slightly to give ~308 mOsm kg-1 (33 °C, saturated with humidified 95% O2 / 5% CO2).

365

The liquid junction potential was measured and corrected (-15.3 mV). The medium (50 ml) was

366

recycled during the experiment and changed every 3 hours or every 3 slices, whichever came first.

367

With the 594 nm laser positioned to stimulate ChrimsonR-CA3 neurons, a CA1 neuron was patched

368

and EPSCs were recorded (every 20s) at -65.3 mV (LJP corrected) where inhibitory currents were

369

clearly outward. Laser intensity was set to evoke EPSCs of approximately -100 pA (range -50 pA to -

370

200 pA). Baseline EPSCs were recorded for up to 5 minutes after break-in. The 10x objective was

371

carefully moved into position to maximize the area of the slice illuminated and the amplifier was

372

switched to current clamp to allow spiking of the CA1 neuron during paired optogenetic stimulation.

373

To induce plasticity, stimulation of ChrimsonR-CA3 neurons 300 x 2 ms pulses at 5 Hz (594 nm laser

374

at baseline intensity plus simultaneous red LED stimulation in the CA1 (625 nm, 2 mW mm-2)) was

375

combined with bursts of 3 violet LED stimuli in CA1 (405 nm, 2 ms, 50 Hz, 1 mW mm-2) to activate

376

CheRiff-CA1 neurons. We set the delay between orange/red and the last or first of the violet light

377

flashes of -10 ms or +10 ms for anti-causal and causal pairing, respectively but after 9 experiments

378

observed the actual median delay from the last action potential (AP) to EPSP onset was -14.2 ms

379

during anti-causal pairing and from EPSP onset to the first AP was 6.8 ms during causal pairing. We

380

therefore advanced the red/orange flash by 2 ms relative to the violet flash during the remaining

381

experiments obtaining a more symmetrical median timing of -12.4 ms during anti-causal and 8.8 ms

382

during causal pairing. After pairing CA3 and CA1 stimulation, EPSCs (0.05 Hz orange laser flashes)

383

were recorded for an additional 25 minutes. The EPSC slope was measured using a self-written script

384

in MATLAB. To determine whether tLTP or tLTD occurred in an individual experiment the baseline

385

slopes (black points in Fig. 1g) and the slopes measured in the last 5 minutes (magenta points in Fig.

386

1g) were compared with Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests (significance p < 0.05). A Kolmogorov-Smirnov

387

test was used to test whether the normalized EPSC slopes were different between the anti-causal

388

and causally paired groups. Plots and statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism.

389

In-incubator oSTDP, read-out and analysis

390

For all ‘no patch’ oSTDP experiments, read-out and analysis were performed by an investigator (MA

391

or BvB) blinded to the induction protocol. Unblinding occurred after the target n for a particular

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/863365; this version posted December 3, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

392

group was reached (~ 7 CheRiff neurons from 4 slices). Experimental groups were inter-mixed to

393

ensure blinding and to mitigate the possibility of unexpected batch or time-dependent factors

394

influencing the outcome resulting in uneven n’s between treatment groups.

395

We waited 7-10 days to allow stable expression of ChrimsonR and CheRiff. One to three days before

396

in-incubator light stimulation, the slice cultures (placed singly on the inserts) were transferred to and

397

centered in a 35 mm culture dish. Where indicated CPPene (1 µM, Fig. 3) was added to the slice

398

culture medium the day before. The closed petri dish containing the centered slice culture was

399

placed in an LED illumination tower constructed from 30 mm optical bench parts (Thorlabs) that was

400

inside a dedicated incubator (Fig. 2a). The tower contained an injection-molded reflector (Roithner

401

LaserTechnik, 10034) to collimate the 630 nm LED (Cree XP-E red) and an aspheric condenser lens

402

(Thorlabs ACL2520U-A) to collimate the 405 nm LED (Roschwege Star-UV405-03-00-00). The LEDs

403

were powered and controlled from outside the incubator by a two-channel Grass S8800 stimulator,

404

two constant-current drivers (RECOM RCD-24-1.20) and a timer. LED power was adjusted to give 1.2

405

mW mm-2 for 405 nm and 8 mW mm-2 for 630 nm inside the petri dish in the specimen plane.

406

Considering the spread in actual spike-burst delay (Fig. 1i), Δt was set to +52, +12, -8, or -48 ms to

407

produce EPSP-spike delays of ~+50 ms, +10 ms, -10 ms and -50 ms, respectively (light pulse duration

408

2 ms). Pairing frequency was 5 Hz or 0.1 Hz. Paired activation was repeated 300 times unless

409

otherwise indicated. ‘Non-paired’ cultures were handled identically but no light stimulation was

410

given. After pairing, each petri dish was marked with only a letter code and date/time of pairing.

411

Where indicated (Fig. 4), 3-4 hours after pairing fresh pre-warmed medium with 1 µM tetrodotoxin

412

(TTX) was pipetted on top of the membrane to immediately silence neurons in the slice. The medium

413

under the slice was then aspirated, replaced with the TTX containing medium and the medium on top

414

of the slice was removed before returning the slice to the incubator, so that the slice was again

415

exposed to the humidified incubator atmosphere. Two days later the TTX was washed 3x and the

416

slices returned to the incubator until the following day when they were recorded from. For the

417

medium change condition, cultures were handled identically except the medium never contained

418

TTX.

419

One hour or 3 days after in-incubator stimulation, slices were transferred by the blinded investigator

420

to the electrophysiology setup with on/off axis stimulation and perfused with ACSF at 30 °C as

421

described above. The slice was positioned so that CheRiff-CA1 neurons as well as at least 5 non-

422

transfected CA1 pyramidal neurons were in the field of view of the 40x objective and camera (Fig.

423

3a). The 594 nm laser was positioned to activate the ChrimsonR-CA3 neurons (see above). Whole-cell

424

patch-clamp recordings were sequentially made from 3 to 4 non-transfected CA1 pyramidal neurons

425

and 1 to 5 CheRiff-CA1 pyramidal neurons in a pseudo-random sequence without moving the stage

426

to ensure constant CA3 stimulation (holding potential -70 mV to ensure separation between EPSCs

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/863365; this version posted December 3, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

427

and IPSCs). While still in cell-attached mode, each neuron was illuminated with a single 405 nm light

428

flash (1 ms, 1.2 mW mm-2) to double-check if the neuron was non-transfected (no spike) or CheRiff-

429

expressing (light-induced spike). After break-in, orange laser flashes (594 nm, 20 s interval)

430

stimulated ChrimsonR-CA3 neurons to evoke EPSCs in the CA1 neurons. EPSC onset was typically 6 to

431

8 ms after the stimulation. If the delay to EPSC onset was 13 ms or longer they were assumed

432

polysynaptic and not analyzed. Ten EPSCs were recorded at each of 3 laser intensities from each CA1

433

neuron (when spontaneous events obscured the EPSCs a few more sweeps were collected). The

434

middle intensity was set to evoke an EPSC of about -100 to -300 pA in the first recording from a given

435

slice. The same 3 intensities were used for all neurons in a given slice. At the end of each recording,

436

we injected a series of current steps to assess cellular excitability. Cells without pyramidal-like firing

437

patterns (i.e. high AP frequency, large amplitude after-hyperpolarization) were eliminated from the

438

analysis.

439

For analysis, we selected the EPSCs from one laser intensity per slice. The selected intensity evoked

440

the most similar EPSC slopes that were at least 20 pA in three non-transfected cells (usually the

441

lowest laser intensity). Individual sweeps with spontaneous EPSCs/IPSCs within 10 ms of the

442

stimulation were suppressed. If fewer than 4 sweeps remained at the selected laser intensity, the

443

recording was discarded. A custom MATLAB routine averaged the EPSCs, detected the (first) peak

444

and the 20-60% slope (Fig. 3c). If the time of the peak varied by more than 5 ms between neurons,

445

we suspected a mixture of mono and polysynaptic responses and the slice was excluded. Input

446

strength we define as the slope from each CheRiff-CA1 neuron divided by the slope of the average

447

EPSC from all non-transfected neurons. GraphPad Prism 8 was used for statistics and to create plots.

448

Immunohistochemistry

449

Ninety minutes after stimulation, slices were fixed (30 minutes, ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in

450

PBS). Slices were washed in PBS (3 x 10 min) and blocked (2 hours 5% donor horse serum, 0.3 %

451

TritonTM X-100 in PBS at RT). Slices were incubated overnight with the primary antibody (4° C, rabbit

452

anti-cFos, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., sc-52, 1:500) in carrier solution (1 % Bovine serum albumin,

453

0.3 % TritonTM X-100 in PBS), then washed 3 times in PBS and incubated at RT for 2 hours with a

454

secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit, Life Technologies, A11008; or Alexa Fluor 568

455

goat anti-rabbit, Life Technologies, A11011) at 1:1000 in carrier solution (same as above). Slices were

456

washed (3 x 10 min) in PBS and mounted with Shandon Immu-Mount (Thermo Scientific; 9990402).

457

For STED microscopy CheRiff-GFP was co-electroporated with 10 ng ml-1 pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, #6085-

458

1) instead of the mKate2. Nine days after virus injection/electroporation the slices were fixed and

459

blocked as above. Slices were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies (FluoTag-X4 anti-

Ab580, both at 1:250) in carrier solution. Slices were washed (3 x 10 min in PBS) and mounted in

462

Mowiol 4-88 (Roth 0713.2) prepared according to manufacturer’s protocol with DABCO (Sigma-

463

Aldrich, D27802).

464

Confocal microscopy

465

An Olympus F1000 confocal microscope and 20x objective (UPLSAPO 0.85 NA, Olympus) were used

466

using the laser/filter sets designed for Alexa 488, Alexa 546 and Alexa 568 as appropriate. Z-series

467

images were obtained using a 3 µm z-step at a 1024x1024-pixel resolution scanning at 12.5 µs per

468

pixel. Image parameters were adjusted for the red and green channels and were kept constant

469

throughout. Fiji/ImageJ55 was used to project the z-series and overlay channels.

470

STED microscopy

471

Gated-2D-STED images were acquired using an Abberior expert-line STED microscope (Abberior

472

instruments). The microscope was controlled by Abberior Inspector software. Samples were placed

473

on a Nikon TI microscope body, equipped with a 60x objective (P-Apo 1.4NA, Nikon). At first,

474

fluorophores were excited with 561 nm and 640 nm laser lines. Both channels, red and far-red were

475

acquired in confocal. In addition, the far-red channel was resolved with 2D-STED by use of a 775nm

476

depletion laser. For both, confocal and 2D-STED acquisitions the pinhole was set to 1AU.

477

Fluorescence was collected on avalanche photodetectors through emission filters 615/20 (red

478

channel) and 685/70 (far-red channel). Gating was obtained with a SPC150 TCSPC board (Becker &

479

Hickl). Gates were set to 8 ns width, starting with a delay of 781.3 ps for both confocal and STED.

480

Acquisitions were obtained sequentially with a 20- by 20 nm pixel size. Confocal images were the

481

result of 6 accumulations, STED images of 18 accumulations acquired by line-mode. Files were saved

482

in a 16-bit format. Confocal and STED images were merged in ImageJ. For representation, the lookup

483

table is linearly adjusted for each channel.
