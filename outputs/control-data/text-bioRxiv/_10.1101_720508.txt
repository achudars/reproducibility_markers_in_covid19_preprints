SUMMARY

The habenula controls the addictive properties of nicotine but also densely expresses
opioid and cannabinoid receptors. As such, identification of strategies to manipulate
habenular activity may yield new approaches to treat substance use disorders. Here
we show that GPR151, an orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) highly enriched
in the habenula of humans and rodents plays a critical role in regulating habenular
function and behavioral responses to addictive drugs. We show that GPR151 is
expressed on axonal and presynaptic membranes and synaptic vesicles, and
regulates synaptic fidelity and plasticity. We find that GPR151 associates with
synaptic components controlling vesicle release and ion transport and couples to the

G-alpha inhibitory protein G

to reduce cAMP levels. Stable cell lines expressing

GPR151 confirm that it signals via Gi/o and are amenable to ligand screens. Gpr151
null mice show diminished behavioral responses to nicotine, and self-administer
greater quantities of the drug, phenotypes rescued by viral re-expression of Gpr151 in
the habenula. Gpr151 null mice are also insensitive to the behavioral actions of
morphine and cannabinoids. These data identify GPR151 as a critical modulator of
habenular function that controls addiction vulnerability across different drug classes.

Antolin-Fontes at al. identify a G protein-coupled receptor, GPR151, which is highly enriched
in human habenular neurons. These neurons are primarily enriched with nicotinic, opioid and
cannabinoid receptors. We find that GPR151 modulates habenular synaptic vesicle release

INTRODUCTION
A fundamental role for the habenula in the control of impulsive or compulsive behaviors, and
in the devaluation of reward by delay and effort, has been supported strongly by several
recent studies (Kobayashi et al., 2013; Lammel et al., 2012; Proulx et al., 2014). The
conservation of this ancient structure across vertebrate evolution, and the many behavioral
abnormalities evident in animals carrying habenular lesions (Agetsuma et al., 2010;
Kobayashi et al., 2013), further support the crucial roles of the habenula in processing
reward-related and aversive signals. However, it has become evident that alterations in the
functions of this pathway are also associated with psychiatric disorders including obsessive

compulsive disorder (Proulx et al., 2014) and drug addiction (Antolin-Fontes et al., 2015;
McLaughlin et al., 2017).

The global impact of substance abuse and addiction disorders on health and economy is well
documented. Currently, about 1.3 billion people consume tobacco and 185 million people use
psychoactive drugs (WHO), while the Department of Health and Human services estimates
that 2.1 million people in the US have an opioid use disorder, while another 11.2 million
misuse opioids. Irrespective of the type of drug, addiction is a chronic relapsing disorder
characterized by compulsive drug seeking, escalation of intake, and development of affective
and physical symptoms of withdrawal upon abrupt discontinuation or decrease in intake
(Koob and Volkow, 2016). Animal studies and human imaging analyses have revealed that
many psychoactive drugs act on the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system, a circuit that
appears to be common to the rewarding effects of some drugs of abuse, as well as other
reinforcing natural behaviors such as eating, thirst, gambling and sexual drive (Lammel et al.,
2014; Lammel et al., 2012; Nutt et al., 2015).However recent findings challenge the view that
DA release has an exclusive role in reward processing and that stress, and aversive stimuli
activate and remodel partially overlapping networks within the mesocorticolimbic dopamine
(DA) system (Ostroumov and Dani, 2018). More recently, other structures have been
implicated in reward and aversion, including the habenula (Antolin-Fontes et al., 2015;
Boulos et al., 2019; Mathis and Kenny, 2018). Increasing evidence suggests that the degree
of sensitivity to both the rewarding and aversive aspects of an addictive drug and the severity
of the withdrawal after discontinuing its use contribute to the addiction process (Koob and
Volkow, 2016). Understanding the mechanisms of these processes may reveal novel insights
into the mechanics of the disorder and identify new targets for medications development.

The medial habenula (MHb) and its major projection site, the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN)
are highly enriched in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) (Ables et al., 2017;
Changeux, 2010; Gorlich et al., 2013; Shih et al., 2014) and are key in the control of nicotine
intake, aversion, withdrawal and relapse (Fowler et al., 2011; Frahm et al., 2011; Gorlich et
al., 2013; Salas et al., 2009). The MHb also densely expresses mu-opioid (MOR) and
cannabinoid 1 (CB1R) receptors. It has been implicated in morphine dependence and
withdrawal (Neugebauer et al., 2013), aversion to MOR blockade (Boulos et al., 2019),
aversive memories mediated by CB1R (Soria-Gomez et al., 2015) and depression induced
by decreased habenular CB1R during nicotine abstinence (Simonnet et al., 2017).

retroflexus (FR), the main output tract of the habenula (Velasquez et al., 2014). The finding
that this descending pathway is compromised following drug binges has implications not only
for theories of drug addiction but also for psychosis in general (Ellison, 2002). Thus, the
emerging picture is that the Hb-IPN pathway acts as an inhibitory motivational signal that
limits drug intake (Fowler et al., 2011), and that alterations in the functioning of this pathway
by drug consumption may contribute to many aspects of addiction.

Here we investigated GPR151, an orphan GPCR with remarkably selective expression in
habenular axonal projections. We found that GPR151 is highly conserved in the human HbIPN circuit and specifically localizes to axonal and presynaptic membranes and synaptic
vesicles (SV). GPR151 partially overlaps with α3β4-containing nAChRs, MOR and CB1R
receptors at habenular terminals in the IPN. We observed reduced behavioral responses to
drugs that act at these receptors in Gpr151-knockout (KO) mice. Furthermore, Gpr151-KO
mice intravenously self-administered much higher amounts of nicotine than their wildtype
(WT) counterparts, consistent with a role for GPR151 in regulating the stimulatory effects of

nicotine on habenular aversion circuits. Mass spectrometry identified SV proteins,
presynaptic ATPases and the G-proteins Gαo1 and Gβ1 as GPR151 interacting proteins,
indicating that GPR151 couples to the G-alpha inhibitory pathway to reduce cAMP. In the
absence of a ligand we employed optogenetics to stimulate MHb terminals and found
increased synaptic fidelity rates and smaller evoked EPSCs in Gpr151-KO mice. Taken
together, our data reveal a key role for GPR151, and the MHb-IPN circuit more broadly, in
regulating the sensitivity and aversion to addictive drugs across class, and suggest that small
molecule modulators of GPR151 activity may represent an entirely new class of addiction
therapeutics.

RESULTS
GPR151 is specifically co-expressed in the habenula-IPN pathway with nicotinic,
opioid and cannabinoid receptors.
GPR151 expression is remarkably conserved and restricted to the habenula-IPN tract in the
brains of zebrafish, mice and rats (Broms et al., 2015). Most GPR151-expressing cells are
concentrated in the Hb (mostly in the MHb and few scattered cells in the LHb (Broms et al.,
2015; Kobayashi et al., 2013). Notably, GPR151 is not present in the soma of habenular
neurons, but along their axonal projections that comprise the FR and at terminals in the IPN
(Figure 1A-D). To investigate whether the pattern of GPR151 expression was also conserved
in humans, we obtained post-mortem adult human brain samples containing part of the
diencephalon and midbrain (Figure 1E-O). Immunostaining analyses showed that GPR151
specifically labeled habenular projections arising in the MHb and LHb (Figure 1G-I). We
detected very strong GPR151 signal along the FR in horizontal human brain sections (Figure
1J-L), as well as in the IPN (Figure 1M-O) where MHb projections terminate. The specific
immunoreactivity of human Hb and IPN to GPR151 antibody is identical to the pattern we
observed in rodents and zebrafish (Broms et al., 2015). Western blot analyses in GPR151

transfected cells, WT mice and human IPN samples revealed two bands corresponding to
GPR151: one of the expected size at 46 kDa and an additional higher molecular band (≈53
kDa) suggesting posttranslational modifications (Figure 1P). These results show that
GPR151 is specifically expressed in the Hb-IPN axonal tract in humans, suggesting that its
function is likely to be conserved across vertebrates.

To obtain a quantitative list of highly translated mRNAs corresponding to receptors
expressed in the same neurons as Gpr151, we employed Chat-EGFP-L10a transgenic mice
for Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) analysis (Doyle et al., 2008). Six
biological replicates were collected from the habenulae of Chat-EGFP-L10a mice and the
resulting INPUT and Immunoprecipitated (IP) mRNAs were analyzed by RNA-Seq (Figure 1Q
and Table S1). The high enrichment of Gpr151 in the TRAP IP (Figure S1A, S1B, S2A and
Table S1) is consistent with its expression in habenular cholinergic neurons, and indicates
that other receptors co-enriched in the IP fraction are also enriched in habenular neurons.
These analyses demonstrate high co-enrichment of Gpr151 with Chrna3 and Chrnb4, and
significant overlap with Oprm1 and Cnr1 mRNAs in the Chat MHb population (Figure 1Q and
S2A).

To confirm the TRAP results, we performed immunofluorescence analyses in Chrna3/eGFP
mice, which label α3β4 nAChR positive neurons in the brain (Frahm et al., 2011). Intense
nAChRα3-eGFP expression was evident in MHb neurons and their projections to the IPN
(Figure S3B, S3E) and demonstrated considerable overlap with GPR151 (co-localization
index: 0.91) in the central and rostral part of the IPN (IPC and IPR) (Figure 1S and Figure
S3E-F). Similarly, co-immunostaining of GPR151 with the µ-opioid receptor (MOR) antibody
showed intense colocalization in axonal terminals in the IPR (colocalization index: 0.97)
(Figure 1T and Figure S3G-H) and partial overlap in the lateral part of the MHb (Figure S3C).

Double immunostaining of GPR151 and the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) revealed intense
costaining in habenular axons terminals in the IPR (colocalization index: 0.86) (Figure 1V and
Figure S3I-J) and low expression in habenular cell bodies (Figure S3D). Single stains of
MOR and CB1R (Figure S3) are consistent with their reported patterns in habenula and IPN
(Gardon et al., 2014; Soria-Gomez et al., 2015). Importantly, gene deletion of Gpr151 in mice
(Gpr151-KO mice) does not influence the levels of translated mRNAs of Oprm1 and Cnr1 in
MHb neurons quantified by TRAP (Figure 1Q), nor the expression of MOR and CB1R at
habenular terminals (Figure S4), indicating that GPR151 expression does not modulate
expression of these receptors localized at the same habenular terminals nor induce adaptive
responses in their expression in the mutant mice. Together, the TRAP and IHC results
establish that GPR151 is highly enriched in habenular projections in the IPN that also
express α3β4 nAChRs, MOR and CB1R, and raise the possibility that GPR151 may influence
the actions of of nicotine, morphine and cannabinoids in the habenula and thereby regulate
behavioral responses to these drugs.

Reduced sensitivity to nicotine, morphine and the cannabinoid agonist ACEA in
Gpr151-KO mice.
Given the high-degree of conservation of GPR151 between rodent and human brains and the
co-expression of GPR151 with receptors for multiple drugs of abuse, we examined the
behavioral responses in mice lacking this receptor. This is important because the findings
could be potentially relevant to human disorders with reward-related abnormalities, such as
affective and addictive disorders. We first tested Gpr151-KO mice at baseline conditions and
found no differences in locomotor activity, anxiety-like behaviors measured by the elevated
plus maze, sensorimotor gating analyzed by the prepulse inhibition test, and anhedonic-like
behavior measured by the preference of sucrose consumed in a two-bottle choice experiment

(Figure S5A-D), suggesting that GPR151 does not regulate affective-related behaviors at
baseline.

We next examined the behavioral responses of Gpr151-KO mice to nicotine, morphine and a
synthetic cannabinoid agonist. We assayed locomotor activity after an acute nicotine
challenge, which reflects the sensitivity of an individual to nicotine (Clarke and Kumar, 1983).
Baseline activity of Gpr151-KO mice was similar to WT (min 0 in Figure 2A, day 0 in Figure
2B, saline in Figure 2C and Figure S5A). However, acute nicotine-induced hypolocomotion
was significantly less prominent in Gpr151-KO mice (min 5, 10 in Figure 2A, day 1 in Figure
2B), indicating that Gpr151-KO mice have reduced sensitivity to the motor-depressing
property of nicotine. While both WT and KO mice displayed similar nicotine-induced
hypolocomotion at the 0.35 mg/kg dose, unlike the WT mice, Gpr151-KO hypolocomotion
was not further increased at 0.65 and 1.5 mg/kg nicotine (Figure 2C). In addition, daily
injections of nicotine induced tolerance to the hypolocomotor effect of nicotine in WT mice
after 9 days of treatment, but Gpr151-KO mice did not demonstrate an adaptive response to
repeated injection of nicotine (Figure 2B, day 9-11). These results show that Gpr151-KO mice
are less sensitive to high doses of nicotine and do not show behavioral plasticity in response
to repeated exposures of nicotine.

Next, to rule out a developmental effect caused by the lack of Gpr151 as the reason for the
altered sensitivity to nicotine observed in Gpr151-KO mice, we knocked downed and rescued
Gpr151 in the habenula of WT and Gpr151-KO mice, respectively. We tested several
different shRNAs against Gpr151 in HEK293T cells and determined that shRNA-3
successfully reduced GPR151 expression by Western blot (Figure S6A-B), and we chose it
for in vivo analysis. Further, we determined that AAV2/1 yielded the highest level of
expression in MHb neurons compared to other serotypes, and generated AAVs containing

the shRNA or a scramble-shRNA as a control to knock-down Gpr151 in WT mice and an AAV
containing CAG-Gpr151 for the rescue experiments in Gpr151-KO mice. Viruses were
injected bilaterally into the MHb and presence or absence of GPR151 expression in the
habenula, along the FR and at the IPN was validated in the injected mice by
immunohistochemistry (Figure S6C). The absence of nicotine-induced hypolocomotor effects
observed in Gpr151-KO mice was recapitulated in shRNA-injected mice while re-expression
of Gpr151 in the KO restored sensitivity to nicotine-induced hypolocomotion (Figure 2C),
indicating that GPR151 acts in the MHb to regulate sensitivity to nicotine in adult mice.

Given that Gpr151-KO mice have an altered response to nicotine and that GPR151 is coexpressed with MOR and CB1R, we next evaluated the behavioral response of Gpr151-KO
mice to morphine and the cannabinoid agonist arachidonyl-2′-chloroethylamide (ACEA). As
expected, an acute injection of morphine resulted in progressive increase of locomotor
activity in WT mice (Figure 2D) (Brase et al., 1977). In contrast Gpr151-KO mice were
insensitive to the acute hyperlocomotor effect of morphine (Figure 2D). We monitored the
development of sensitization to morphine over the course of 6 days of daily injections of
morphine. WT mice developed locomotor sensitization while Gpr151-KO mice were resistant
to sensitization (Figure 2E). Injection of the CB1R agonist ACEA induced hypoactivity as
previously described (Almeida et al., 2014), which was indistinguishable between WT and
Gpr151-KO mice (Figure S5E-F) consistent with studies showing that habenular CB1R does
not influence locomotion (Soria-Gomez et al., 2015). However, since CB1R is critical for
central regulation of food intake (Koch et al., 2015), we tested whether activation of CB1R
induced a differential feeding response in Gpr151-KO mice. An injection of ACEA increased
feeding in WT mice as described (Koch et al., 2015) while Gpr151-KO mice were insensitive
to the hyperphagic effect of ACEA at 5mg/kg, and the hyperphagic effect at 10mg/kg was
significantly lower than WT mice (Figure 2F-G and Figure S5G-H). Similar to WT mice,

Gpr151-KO mice injected in the MHb with the rescue virus demonstrated significantly
increased food intake upon a 5mg/kg injection of ACEA (Figure 2H). Consecutive injections
of ACEA over a 7-day period resulted in significant body weight gain in WT mice but not in
Gpr151-KO mice (Figure 2I). Body weight of WT and Gpr151-KO mice on regular water and
food was similar across age (Figure S5I). These data revealed an unsuspected role of
GPR151 in feeding behavior induced by activation of CB1R. Prompted by this finding, and
given the well-known anorectic effects of nicotine, we tested whether activation of nAChRs
resulted in differential weight changes in Gpr151-KO mice. Mice were given drinking water
containing nicotine and saccharin (to mask the bitter taste of nicotine) for 4 weeks. Control
WT mice drinking only saccharin gained significantly more weight than WT mice treated with
nicotine (Figure 2J). However, no differences in body weight were observed between
Gpr151-KO mice treated either with saccharin or nicotine, indicating that Gpr151-KO mice
are insensitive to the anorectic effects of nicotine.

These data suggest that GPR151 affects the sensitivity to the locomotor effects, feeding
patterns and weight gain changes induced by nicotine, opioids and cannabinoids. The
demonstration that Gpr151-KO mice do not differ from WT mice under baseline conditions,
but respond differently to nicotine, morphine and ACEA, supports a critical role for GPR151
signalling in the MHb in controlling behavioral response to drugs of abuse across different
classes. In addition, these results reveal an unsuspected role of the habenula in feeding
regulation and weight control/energy balance in response to drugs of abuse.

Reduced nicotine-induced suppression of feeding and increased self-administration of
high nicotine doses in Gpr151-KO mice.
To investigate whether GPR151 controls the reinforcing properties of addictive drugs, we
examined WT and Gpr151-KO mice in a self-administration task. We focused our attention on

nicotine because the MHb-IPN pathway is well-known to control consumption of this drug.
Mice first underwent training to respond for food rewards in operant chambers where presses
on the active lever resulted in the delivery of food pellets under a fixed-ratio 5 time-out 20 sec
(FR5TO20) schedule of reinforcement. No differences were observed in the acquisition of
lever pressing behavior (Figure S7). Based on the findings described above, suggesting that
the MHb regulates the anorectic actions of nicotine and other drugs of abuse, we determined
if nicotine (1mg/kg, s.c.) can reduce responding for food rewards in this task in WT and
Gpr151-KO mice. In saline treated mice, the number of food pellets earned by WT mice (9.9
+/- 0.8) and Gpr151-KO mice (11.8 +/- 0.5) was comparable (Figure 3A). However, upon
nicotine administration WT mice responded significantly less for food rewards than saline WT
controls, consistent with the anorectic effect of nicotine on food intake. Similar to our findings
with nicotine in the drinking water, this anorectic response was much less pronounced in
Gpr151-KO mice (Figure 3A) reflecting a reduced sensitivity to nicotine-induced suppression
of appetite.

Using the same paradigm but pairing the lever pressing to intravenous infusion of nicotine,
we next investigated the role of GPR151 in nicotine reinforcement. As expected, WT mice
responded for self-administered nicotine infusions according to a known inverted U-shaped
dose–response curve (Fowler et al., 2011) (Figure 3B). Notably, Gpr151-KO mice selfadministered far more nicotine at a high nicotine dose than WT littermate mice (Figure
3B,C,E). This pattern of responding for nicotine, particularly at higher unit doses of the drug,
is similar to that previously reported in α5 nAChR subunit KO mice and rats in which α5
subunits are selectively knocked down in Hb-IPN (Fowler et al., 2011), suggesting reduced
sensitivity to the aversive effects of high doses of nicotine. Re-expression of GPR151 in the
MHb of Gpr151-KO mice reduced self-administration of the 0.4mg/kg nicotine dose to levels
similar to WT mice (Figure 3D,E). Consistent with the locomotor behavioral tests (Figure

2A,B,C), both the reduction in the anorectic effects of nicotine and the fact that Gpr151-KO
mice self-administer more nicotine at a high doses suggests that the KO mice are resistant to
the aversive and malaise-inducing effects of nicotine. Altogether, these results demonstrate
that GPR151 is key in the inhibitory control exerted by the MHb in limiting drug and food
intake.

GPR151 is localized to axonal and presynaptic membranes and synaptic vesicles of
habenular terminals.
To understand the mechanism by which GPR151 modulates the sensitivity to nicotine,
morphine and cannabinoids that act on their cognate habenular receptors, we next
determined its precise subcellular localization. To this end, we employed immuno-electron
microscopy (iEM) to visualize axonal projections and synaptic terminals in the rostral portion
of the IPN (Figure 4A), which is most intensely labeled by GPR151 (Broms et al., 2015) and
contains the highest concentration of cholinergic and glutamatergic axonal terminals arising
from habenular neurons (Frahm et al., 2015). GPR151 immunoreactivity was observed in
axon terminals of WT mice (Figure 4B and Figure S8A-B), but not in Gpr151-KO mice (Figure
4C and Figure S8C-D), confirming the specificity of the antibody. As expected from the
characteristic architecture of the IPN, quantitative analysis of terminals containing an active
zone (AZ) showed that most synaptic contacts labeled by GPR151 were axo-dendritic (50 out
of 53), 2 were axo-axonic and 1 was axo-somatic (Figure S8E). To exclude the possibility
that loss of GPR151 could have altered the morphology of IPN synapses we performed a
comparative analysis of different synaptic markers in WT and Gpr151-KO terminals. No
significant differences were observed in the area of the synaptic terminal, length of the AZ,
diameter and density of SVs, and distance of SVs to the AZ (Figure 4D-H).

The majority of GPR151 nanogold particles (73.63%) were located at the presynaptic plasma
membrane (Figure 4B and 4L), at the active zone (AZ) (5.19%; Figure 4B, 4I and 4L) and in
association with synaptic vesicles (SV) (9.66% Figure 4J and 4L) and dense core vesicles
(DCV) (1.39%, Figure 4K-L). SVs and DCVs labeled with GPR151 were mainly localized
further than 200 nm from the AZ (Figure S8F-G). The distribution of GPR151 was similar in
presynaptic terminals without an AZ in the plane of the picture (Figure S8B and S8H).
GPR151 nanogold particles were also found along the habenular axonal projections, mostly
at the membrane but also along the microtubules inside the axons (Figure 4M and Figure
S9A-B). This is interesting in light of recent findings that nAChRs are also expressed along
Hb axons in the fasciculus retroflexus, where they can be activated by nicotine (Passlick et
al., 2018).

Next, we confirmed that GPR151 is at SVs by double postembedding iEM staining with the
vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) (Figure 4N-Q, Figure S9C-E). Out of 70 synaptic
terminals analyzed, 87% (n=61) were labeled with both VGLUT1 and GPR151, while just
10% (n=7) were labeled with GPR151 only and 3% (n=2) were labeled with VGLUT1 only
(Figure S9F). This indicates that around 90% of GPR151 habenular terminals at the IPR are
glutamatergic. GPR151 and VGLUT1 were found very close to each other in association with
synaptic vesicles (Figure 4P) and along the microtubules within the axons being transported
towards the terminals (Figure 4Q and S9G-H). In summary these experiments identify
GPR151 as a novel and specific component of presynaptic habenular terminals in the IPN.
The fact that Gpr151-KO mice have presynaptic terminals with normal morphology and SVs
distribution argues against a role for GPR151 in synaptic scaffolding or cytoskeleton
organization or in brain development. However, GPR151 localization at the synaptic and
perisynaptic membrane and SVs suggests that GPR151 may modulate synaptic activity.

GPR151 contributes to synaptic fidelity, strength and plasticity.
To explore the possibility that GPR151 modulates the synaptic activity of habenular
terminals, we tested whether optogenetic activation of MHb terminals could reveal
differences between WT and Gpr151-KO mice. Since the majority of GPR151 expressing
neurons (70%) are cholinergic MHb neurons (Figure S10), we crossed Gpr151-KO mice with
transgenic mice expressing the light-gated cation channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in
cholinergic neurons (Chat-ChR2 mice) (Ren et al., 2011) and recorded IPN neurons from
offspring mice (Figure 5A). eEPSCs were evoked by trains of 5 ms blue light pulses (Figure
5B) and the fidelity of transmission was calculated as the percentage of light pulses that
resulted in detectable postsynaptic currents per second during 1 min (Figure 5C). We
observed increased fidelity rates in MHb-IPN synapses of Chat-ChR2xGpr151-KO mice
compared to Chat-ChR2 mice (Figure 5C) and compared to Chat-ChR2xGpr151-KO mice
injected with the rescue virus (AAV2/1-Gpr151) specifically in MHb (Figure 5D). However, the
amplitude of the light evoked EPSCs was smaller in Chat-ChR2xGpr151-KO (Figure 5E).
Next we used the Paired Pulse Ratio (PPR) to measure presynaptic release probability upon
light stimulation. At basal conditions, the PPR was similar between genotypes (Figure 5F).
However, nicotine application in Chat-ChR2 slices increases the probability of the initial
presynaptic release of the readily releasable pool of vesicles and therefore reduces the PPR
(Figure 5G, 5I). In contrast, the PPR of Chat-ChR2xGpr151-KO does not change upon
nicotine application (Figure 5H-I). This is consistent with the fact that GPR151 regulates
behavioral actions to nicotine, The increased synaptic fidelity, smaller EPSC and unchanged
PPR upon nicotine administration in Chat-ChR2xGpr151-KO point to a critical role of
GPR151 in maintaining the readily releasable pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles in habenular
terminals in the IPN.

GPR151 couples to the G-alpha inhibitory protein Gαo1 and associates with
presynaptic components.
To understand the signaling mechanisms through which GPR151 controls habenular neurons
we sought to identify the G-alpha protein subunit groups (Gαs, Gαi, Gαq/11, or Gα12/13,) it
uses for signal transduction. To accomplish this, we collected brain samples from the IPN of
WT and Gpr151-KO mice, immunoprecipitated (IP) the protein extracts with GPR151
antibodies and performed mass spectrometry analyses of IP samples (Figure 6A, Figure
S11A and Table S4). As shown in the volcano plot (Figure 6B), GPR151 is the most enriched
protein in the immunoprecipitated fraction in WT mice, and it is not present in Gpr151-KO
extracts, confirming the efficacy and specificity of the IPs. In addition, we identified 17
proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with GPR151 (Table S4). Among these, we were
especially interested in the interaction with the G-alpha inhibitory subunit Gnao1 (protein
name Gαo1), a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding G-proteins involved in intracellular
signal

transduction

(Figure

6B).

To

confirm

this

interaction,

we

performed

immunoprecipitations and Western blot analysis of IPN extracts from WT and KO mice. As
shown in Figure 6C and 6D, GPR151 associates with Gαo1 but not with the G-alpha
stimulatory subunit (Gαs). Consistently, the TRAP data shows that Gαo1 is the most
abundant of the inhibitory Gi/o proteins in cholinergic MHb neurons (Table S2). These results
indicate that GPR151 couples to the G-alpha inhibitory pathway, which is known to inhibit
adenylyl cyclase activity and therefore decrease intracellular cAMP levels.

Other proteins co-immunoprecipitated with GPR151 include synaptic vesicle proteins
(Synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) and Voltage-Dependent Anion Channels (VDAC2))
(Morciano et al., 2009; Takamori et al., 2006) and proteins potentially involved in regulating
the functional dynamics of the pre-synapse (including the sodium/potassium ATPase
composed of AT1A2 and AT1A3 (catalytic α-subunits), AT1B1 and AT1B2 (structural β-

subunits)) the calcium ATPase (AT2A2 and AT2B3), and the H+ transporting ATPase (AT5B)
(Taruno et al., 2012; Zanni et al., 2012); (Figure 6B and Table S5, Figures S12, S13, S14 of
GO analysis). Association of GPR151 with these proteins in mass spectrometry is consistent
with immunoEM localization at the synaptic vesicle and with our electrophysiological findings
demonstrating regulation of vesicular release.

GPR151 regulates cAMP levels
Given its interaction with Gαo1, we next analyzed the possibility that GPR151 modulates
cAMP levels. We conducted cAMP assays of IPN samples of WT and Gpr151-KO mice, as
well as WT mice injected into the MHb with scramble shRNA or Gpr151-shRNA for
downregulation (Figure 7A). Consistent with GPR151 coupling to Gαo1, we observed that
cAMP levels are higher in Gpr151-KO IPN homogenates (Figure 7B). In addition, we
observed a strong trend of increased cAMP levels in Gpr151-downregulated IPN (Figure 7B).
Given that cAMP is an important regulator of neurotransmission of MHb cholinergic synapses
(Hu et al., 2012), we performed electrophysiological recordings in Chat-ChR2 and ChatChR2xGpr151-KO upon light stimulation as explained for Figure 5. As expected, addition of
forskolin increased the amplitude of light evoked EPSCs in Chat-ChR2 mice (Figure 7C).
However, the amplitude was not altered in Chat-ChR2xGpr151-KO upon forskolin application
and remained smaller than WT levels (Figure 7C). This suggests that the absence of
GPR151 compromises the coupling of cAMP signaling to the neurotransmitter release
machinery in habenula neurons.

To further analyze the role of GPR151 in cAMP modulation and validate its interaction with
Gαo1, we generated two stable cell lines expressing GPR151 with an N-terminus 5HT3
signal peptide to enhance membrane expression (Wellerdieck et al., 1997; Wetzel et al.,

17

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/720508; this version posted July 31, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

1999) plus a SNAP-tag to monitor surface expression (Ward et al., 2011) in HEK293 and
CHO-K1 cells. CHO-K1 cells were used because they express high levels of Gαo1. In
contrast, HEK293 cells do not express Gαo1, but express Gαz, which is a member of the
same Gαi/o family (Baycin-Hizal et al., 2012; Doi et al., 2016; Thakur et al., 2011). GPR151
expression at the membrane was validated by SNAP and GPR151 immunostaining and
western blot (Figure 7D and S15). Next we measured cAMP levels upon forskolin stimulation
using the LANCE cAMP assay. The EC50 of forskolin of GPR151-expressing HEK293
(170.5nM) or CHO-K1 (167.1nM) cells were significantly higher than their parental cells,
HEK293 (25.8nM) and CHO-K1 (24.1nM) (Figure 7E-F), suggesting that GPR151 couples to
Gαi/o proteins and that its constitutive activity buffers the effect of forskolin.

Next we treated the cells with 250 ng/ml pertussis toxin (PT) overnight, which inactivates the
G proteins by catalyzing the ADP-ribosylation of the αsubunits of the heterotrimeric Gαi/o
protein family, with the exception the Gαz isoform (Fong et al., 1988; Matsuoka et al., 1988).
PT had a strong effect on cAMP production stimulated by forskolin in GPR151-expressing
CHO-K1 cells (Figure 7F). The EC50 of forskolin decreased from 167.1nM to 71.82nM
indicating that PT blocks a large portion of the inhibitory response mediated by Gαo. The
impact of PT in GPR15-expressing HEK293 cells is not as strong as in CHO-K1 cells (Figure
7E). The EC50 of forskolin in HEK293-GPR151 expressing cells decreased from 170.5 nM to
146.3 nM upon PT treatment, most likely because HEK293 cells have Gαz, which is
insensitive to PT.
Together these results provide evidence that GPR151 couples to Gαo and decreases cAMP
levels. In agreement with the lower cAMP levels observed in the IPN of WT mice compared
to Gpr151-KO mice, GPR151 was observed to be constitutively active in both cell lines
analyzed. This constitutive activity of GPR151 is actually not unexpected since it lacks the
DRY motif which plays an essential role in class A-GPCR’s function (Wess, 1998). Mutations

or deletion of the DRY motif lead to the formation of active GPCR conformations (Rosenkilde
et al., 2005; Wess, 1998). Moreover, GPCRs without the DRY motif have been shown to be
both constitutively active and ligand-inducible; and that inserting the DRY motif decreases its
constitutive activity (Rosenkilde et al., 2005). Our data suggest that GPR151 could be also
functioning via both a constitutive and a ligand-inducible mechanism.

DISCUSSION
The conservation of the habenula across vertebrates and its emerging role in processing
reward-related and aversive signals, including drug abuse responses, points to the need to
further characterize this brain circuit and identify modulatory mechanisms that may provide
common avenues for the development of new approaches towards the treatment of addiction
and other disorders of the “reward” circuitry. Our previous studies showed the specific
expression of the orphan receptor GPR151 in the habenula of rats, mice and zebrafish. Here,
we establish conservation of the habenular-enrichment of this receptor in human brains,
define its function in regulating habenular neurons, and reveal its critical role in regulating
behavioral response to addictive drugs across different classes. More specifically,

we

demonstrate that GPR151 is present in presynaptic termini of rodent and human habenular
neurons, and that it couples to Gαo to regulate cAMP levels, synaptic fidelity and
neurotransmission. We also show that neurons in the medial habenula co-express GPR151
with nAChRs, MOR and CB1R, and that loss of GPR151 results in alterations in behaviors
associated with nicotine, opioid and cannabinoid use. Thus, our data identify the MHb/IPN
projection as a common pathway controlling addictive-relevant behaviors in response to
major classes of drugs of abuse, and they demonstrate that this important circuit is
modulated by the orphan receptor GPR151.

We found that GPR151 is selectively enriched in habenular presynaptic structures in the IPN.
Several GPCRs, including dopamine D2, muscarinic M2 and M4, adrenergic, cannabinoid
and opioid receptors have been localized at the presynapse where they inhibit evoked
synaptic transmission (Betke et al., 2012). GPCRs directly at the active zone regulate fast
transmission by local action of the dissociated G beta-gamma complex (Gβγ) on exocytosis,
while GPCRs distant from the AZ modulate neurotransmission through second-messenger
cascades (Betke et al., 2012). Following with this distinction, GPR151, which is mainly at the
presynaptic plasma membrane (73% gold particles), most likely regulates synaptic
transmission through cAMP second messenger cascades rather than through Gβγ. However,
our mass spectrometry analysis revealed that GPR151 binds to Gαo1 and Gβ1 subunits,
shown to localize to SVs and DCVs in neurons (Ahnert-Hilger et al., 1994; Takamori et al.,
2006). The fact that GPR151 can be detected at the AZ, in SVs and in DCVs (17% of
immunoparticles) and that it immunoprecipitates with Gαo1 and Gβ1, suggests the presence
of preassembled GPR151/G-protein signaling complexes in vesicles that can be transported
to the plasma membrane upon neuronal stimulation. Interestingly, GPR151 can be activated
by acidic conditions in vitro (Mashiko et al., 2019) suggesting the possibility that GPR151 is
activated by acidic SVs which release protons during neurotransmission (Traynelis and
Chesler, 2001). Acidification also occurs after neuronal injury and acidosis induces pain and
hyperalgesia (Ortega-Ramirez et al., 2017). An increase of Gpr151 mRNA (but no GPR151
protein) has been detected after nerve ligation in dorsal root ganglia (Holmes et al., 2017)
and spinal cord (Jiang et al., 2018). However, diminished allodynia in Gpr151-mutant mice
after neuropathic pain was only found in one of the studies (Jiang et al., 2018), suggesting
that further studies will be required to examine its role in pain.

Consistent with the EM analyses, GPR151 co-immunoprecipitates with proteins localized at
presynaptic terminals and at SVs, again suggesting that GPR151 preassembles not only with

G-alpha and beta proteins but also with SV components during its translocation to the plasma
membrane. Importantly, GPR151 did not co-immunoprecipitate with CB1R and MOR, which
are found presynaptically in habenular terminals, and we did not observe differences in CB1R
and MOR protein expression in Gpr151-KO mice. These data exclude the possibility that the
reduced sensitivity to opioids and cannabinoids in Gpr151-KO mice is caused by
stoichiometric changes in the formation of heteromeric complexes of these receptors or their
chaperoning to the membrane. This is in contrast to findings with antipsychotic drugs, which
have been reported to bind glutamate mGluR2/ serotonin 2AR heterocomplexes to result in
behavioral alterations in response to a variety of pharmacological compounds (Fribourg et al.,
2011).

Our studies suggest that enhanced cAMP levels in habenular terminals of Gpr151-KO mice
are responsible for the behavioral changes observed. cAMP reduces synaptic failure rates
(Huang and Hsu, 2006) and facilitates neurotransmission by increasing release probability at
central excitatory synapses (Sakaba and Neher, 2001). This has also been reported in
habenular

neurons

where

depletion

neurotransmission (Hu et al., 2012). Although enhanced synaptic fidelity improves the
precision of information transfer through brain networks (Owen et al., 2013), in some cases,
increased synaptic fidelity might be deleterious, for instance, when it is a consequence of
chronic drug administration. Upregulation of the cAMP signaling pathway is a typical
molecular adaptation in several brain regions following chronic morphine treatment (Bie et al.,
2005), and activation of CB1R also modifies synaptic efficacy (Katona and Freund, 2008).
MOR and CB1R, like GPR151, interact with the Gαi/o class of adenylate cyclase inhibitory
Gα proteins (Howlett and Fleming, 1984; Uhl et al., 1994). From these observations, it is
reasonable to hypothesize that maintaining increased levels of cAMP at habenular terminals
of Gpr151-KO blunts the response of these neurons to drugs of abuse. Thus, the picture

emerging from our studies is that GPR151 constitutive activity in normal WT synapses
maintains a low level of cAMP at habenular synapses that allows dynamic responses to
fluctuation by drugs of abuse acting on habenular nicotinic, opioid and cannabinoid receptors.
In Gpr151-KO mice, cAMP levels are very high and neither forskolin nor drugs of abuse can
elicit changes of neurotransmitter release due to a ceiling effect. Since insensitivity to these
drugs in Gpr151-KO mice leads to higher self-administration, the findings here suggest that
future studies aimed at the identification of an agonist of GPR151 (that will further decrease
the levels of cAMP at this synapse) could be useful to treat addiction. No studies in central
synapses have evaluated whether nicotine increases cAMP levels, but it has been shown
that nicotine acts presynaptically to augment the frequency of neurotransmitter release
(Frahm et al., 2015). This suggests that in addition to changes in cAMP, other molecular
mechanisms may determine release probability in habenular synapses, for instance through
ATPases. Since GPR151 interacts with the sodium/potassium pump ATP1A3/B1 which
contributes to precise and reliable transmission at glutamatergic synapses (Taruno et al.,
2012), it is possible that GPR151 reduces synaptic strength during high-frequency stimulation
by impairing ATP1A3/B1 trafficking or activity by regulating its phosphorylation (Poulsen et
al., 2010). Further studies on this particular aspect would be key to understand how GPCRs
contribute to ATPase function in synaptic fidelity.

Addictive drugs, although chemically different from one another, share common cellular and
anatomical pathways. Two lines of investigation have led to this conclusion: 1) most of them
activate the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic (DA) reward circuitry, 2) each of them mimics or
enhances the actions of one or more neurotransmitters in the brain that are involved in the
control of the brain reward circuit (Koob and Volkow, 2010). Connections between the lateral
habenula and the DA system have been established (either direct LHb-VTA, or via the
RMTg-VTA-SNc) (Proulx et al., 2014), and between the MHb and VTA DA system via the

IPN (Ables et al., 2017; Zhao-Shea et al., 2015). These observations suggest that drugs of
abuse act at the MHb-IPN and mesocorticolimbic reward circuit to process both rewardrelated and aversive signals. Also we cannot exclude that Gpr151-KO behavioral effects may
also involve the LHb since a subpopulation of LHb muscarinic M2 neurons is GPR151
positive. However consistent with our self-administration experiments, loss of GPR151 in
habenula did not alter the rewarding effects of nicotine but abolished the inhibitory aversive
effects of higher nicotine doses on brain reward. A balance between reward and aversion is
also evident by the fact that not only tolerance, sensitization and self-administration
responses are changed in Gpr151-KO mice, but also food intake by activation of CB1R and
nAChRs. Animal studies and human imaging analyses have revealed that many
psychoactive drugs act on the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system, a circuit that appears to
be common to the rewarding effects of some drugs of abuse, as well as other reinforcing
natural behaviors such as eating, thirst, gambling and sexual drive (Lammel et al., 2014;
Lammel et al., 2012; Ostroumov and Dani, 2018). Feeding responses to drugs of abuse are
also mediated by the mesolimbic DA circuit (Land et al., 2014; Nunes et al., 2013; Wise and
McDevitt, 2018)and by hypothalamic POMC neurons (Koch et al., 2015; Mineur et al., 2011).
Since neuroanatomical reciprocal connections exist between the IPN and hypothalamus
(Groenewegen et al., 1986), it is possible that GPR151-mediated alterations of MHb-IPN
neurotransmission impact feeding behavior by modulating postsynaptic responses of POMC
neurons. It has been proposed that obesity and drug addiction arise from similar
neuroadaptive responses (DiLeone et al., 2012; Kenny, 2011). Interestingly, UK biobank
studies have recently associated GPR151 loss of function alleles to lower body mass index,
warranting further studies on the role of Gpr151 in feeding. However we only detected
differences on feeding behavior when mice are treated with the cannabinoid agonist ACEA
(not with saline control animals) or with nicotine. Our results highlight the habenula as a
common key brain area in the development of addiction to some drugs of abuse and provide

evidence of a role of this ancient epithalamic nucleus in feeding regulation and weight
control. Thus our findings raise the possibility that malfunction of the habenula may
predispose individuals to drug consumption and consequent changes in food intake that may
in turn reinforce the use of drugs.

Finally, our studies suggest GPR151 as a candidate target for therapies preventing drug
abuse because: 1) it is exclusively localized in axonal projections of habenular neurons,
decreasing therefore the likelihood of developing side effects due to alterations in other brain
circuits or in the peripheral nervous system, 2) it modulates neurotransmission and by that
affects sensitivity to nicotine, morphine and cannabinoid-induced behaviors, 3) it belongs to
the highly druggable Class A family of GPCRs and can be screened with cAMP assays , and
4) its pattern of expression is conserved in the human habenula-IPN axis. We hope our work
stimulates interest in this orphan GPCR since the identification of a GPR151 agonist would
be a very valuable therapeutic target to reduce the enormous adverse impact of drug abuse
on public health.

Figure 2. Gpr151-KO mice show blunted behavioral responses to nicotine, morphine
and cannabinoids.
(A) Hypolocomotion induced by acute injection of nicotine (0.65mg/kg, i.p.), measured as
number of beam breaks in 5 min intervals, is significantly diminished in Gpr151-KO mice (n=7
per genotype; RM 2-way ANOVA, Bonferroni multiple comparisons *p<0.05, **p<0.01 for
genotype; Tukey's multiple comparisons test ###p<0.001 for time in both groups). Basal
locomotor activity (min 0) is similar between groups.
(B) Consecutive daily injections of nicotine induce tolerance to the hypolocomotor effects of
nicotine in WT but not in Gpr151-KO mice (n=7 per genotype, RM 2-way ANOVA, Bonferroni
multiple comparisons #p<0.05 for genotype; Tukey's multiple comparisons test **p<0.01,
***p<0.001 for time).
(C) Hypolocomotion induced by nicotine is observed at the higher 2 doses of nicotine (0.65
and 1.5 mg/kg) in WT mice, WT mice injected with AAV2.1-scramble-shRNA (scramble) and
in Gpr151-KO mice injected with AAV2.1-CAG-Gpr151 (rescue) in the MHb, but not in
Gpr151-KO mice and in WT mice injected with AAV2.1-shRNA against Gpr151 (shRNA) in

(A) Outline of the co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and Mass Spectrometry (MS) experiments
(n=5 biological replicates for WT and n=5 for KO. For each replicate, 15 IPN were dissected).
(B) Volcano plot of proteins that co-IP with GPR151 from the IPN of WT mice (right) and
Gpr151-KO (left) IPN samples. Log2 ratios are plotted against the adjusted negative
log10 P values. Significant different proteins (p<0.05) found in WT samples are labeled in
red. The size of the circles indicates an estimate of protein amount. P values were obtained
using Student t-test. As expected GPR151 was the most enriched protein in the IP fraction of
WT mice and was not present in KO mice. Other co-IP proteins include Gαo1, ATPases and
SV2A. Control proteins not enriched in WT (log2<1) include Gβ1, ACTB1 and ACTA2
indicated in grey.
(C-D) Western blot confirmation that GPR151 IPs with GPR151 in WT mice (double arrow)
and that Gαo1 (arrowhead) but not Gαs IPs with GPR151 in WT mice (IP GPR151 WT: 1 ± 0,
KO: 0.03 ± 0.01, n=5, unpaired t-test p < 0.0001; IP Gαo1/2 WT: 1 ± 0, KO: 0.31 ±0.09, n=5,
