Abstract
Transcranial focused ultrasound has the promise to evolve into a transformative noninvasive
way to modulate activity of neuronal circuits deep in the brain. The approach may enable
systematic and causal mapping of how individual brain circuits are involved in specific
behaviors and behavioral disorders. Previous studies demonstrated neuromodulatory potential, but the e↵ect polarity, size, and spatial specificity have been difficult to assess. Here,
we engaged non-human primates (macaca mulatta) in an established task that provides a
well defined framework to characterize the neuromodulatory e↵ects. In this task, subjects
decide whether to look at a right or a left target, guided by one the targets appearing
first. Previous studies showed that excitation/inhibition of oculomotor circuits leads to
contralateral/ipsilateral biases in this choice behavior. We found that brief, low-intensity
ultrasound stimuli (300 ms, 0.6 MPa, 270 kHz) delivered to the animals’ left/right frontal
eye fields bias the animals’ decisions to the right/left visual hemifield.

The e↵ect was

modest, about on the order of that produced when injecting moderate amounts of potent
neuromodulatory drugs into the same regions in this task.

The polarity of the e↵ects

suggested a neuronal excitation within the stimulated regions. No e↵ects were observed
when we applied the same stimuli to control brain regions not involved in oculomotor target
selection. Together, using an established paradigm, we found that transcranial ultrasound
is capable of modulating neurons to the extent of biasing choice behavior of non-human
primates. A demonstration of tangible, brain-region-specific e↵ects on behavior of primates
constitutes a critical step toward applying this noninvasive neuromodulation method in
investigations of how specific neural circuits are involved in specific behaviors or disease
signs.

Introduction
Noninvasive and spatially specific approaches to modulating neuronal activity have the potential to
revolutionize the diagnoses and treatments of a variety of brain disorders. One such approach, ultrasound,
can be applied through the intact skull and skin and focused into tight regions deep in the human brain
(Ghanouni et al., 2015). At the focus, ultrasound has been shown to modulate neural activity (Naor et
al., 2016; Fini and Tyler, 2017; Kubanek, 2018; Tyler et al., 2018; Fomenko et al., 2018). By virtue of
its noninvasiveness and spatial focus, the approach has a unique promise in modulating the activity of
specific circuits in a systematic fashion. This could enable us, for the first time, to characterize the causal
contribution of specific brain circuits to specific behaviors or behavioral disorders in humans. To bring
the approach into clinics, we need to be able to establish three critical aspects of the neuromodulatory
e↵ects. First, it is crucial to characterize the polarity of the neuromodulatory e↵ects—whether neurons
are excited or inhibited by ultrasound. Second, we need to determine how strong the e↵ects are. If the
method is to be useful for mapping brain function in a causal manner, the e↵ects on neurons must be
strong enough to manifest in behavior. For example, if clinicians are to determine which brain nuclei
underlie a patient’s essential tremor, the neuromodulatory e↵ects on a particular nucleus in question
must be strong enough to yield measurable changes in the tremor amplitude. And third, it is critical to
validate that the neuromodulatory e↵ects are confined to the focal region of the ultrasound.
This information has been difficult to infer from the approaches and metrics used in previous studies.
The bulk of work on ultrasonic neuromodulation has been performed in lightly anesthetized mice (Tufail
et al., 2011; King et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2014; Mehić et al., 2014; Ye et al., 2016; Kamimura et al., 2016;
Li et al., 2016; Sato et al., 2018). In these studies, applications of low-intensity stimuli to peri-motor
regions often lead to visible movements of the limbs or other body parts. There have been concerns
that the small size of the rodent brain, relative to the dimensions of the focal spot, results in reflections,
standing waves, and consequently, artifactual e↵ects (Guo et al., 2018; Sato et al., 2018). Within this
debate, it has been argued that the neuromodulatory e↵ects of ultrasound might be local (King et al., 2014;
Mehić et al., 2014; Kamimura et al., 2016), but it has also been argued that these e↵ects might be
merely due to auditory or vestibular artifacts (Guo et al., 2018; Sato et al., 2018). Either way, the
probability of eliciting movements on a given stimulation trial (“success rate”) has been difficult to
reproduce consistently and is strongly dependent on the kind and level of anesthesia (Naor et al., 2016).
On the other hand, studies using larger mammals including sheep, macaques, and humans have shown
e↵ects on aggregate metrics including EEG activity, MRI BOLD, or reaction time (Deffieux et al., 2013;
Hamero↵ et al., 2013; Legon et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2016; Wattiez et al.,
2017; Legon et al., 2018). It has been difficult to judge from these studies how strong the e↵ects are and

in what direction they point because there has been no particular prediction framework within which to
interpret these e↵ects. In addition, it has not been clear how local the e↵ects are (Lee et al., 2016).
Here, we characterize the size and polarity of the neuromodulatory e↵ects of ultrasound using a wellestablished task (Oppenheim, 1885; Rorden et al., 1997; Ro et al., 2001; Schiller and Tehovnik, 2003;
Kubanek et al., 2015) in awake behaving non-human primates (NHPs). In this task, a subject decides
whether to look at a right or a left target, guided by one of the targets appearing slightly earlier than
the other target. Previous studies using pharmacological or electrical interventions showed that specific,
neuroinhibitory or neuroexcitatory perturbations of visuomotor regions produce predictable shifts in
subjects’ decisions regarding which target to choose. Thus, this prior research provides predictions of
what behavior to expect if a neuromodulatory approach such as ultrasound is excitatory or inhibitory.
Moreover, these studies enable us to gauge the size of the neuromodulatory e↵ects from the magnitude
of the behavior shift. Finally, the large brain of NHPs and hemispheric symmetry allows us to assess
whether the neuromodulatory e↵ects are specific to the stimulated regions.

Results
We engaged two macaque monkeys in a task that is often used in neurology to diagnose the impact of
brain lesions such as those induced by stroke (Oppenheim, 1885; Rorden et al., 1997; Ro et al., 2001).
In this paradigm (Fig. 1A), one visual target is shown in the left and one in the right visual hemifield,
with a short, controlled delay between the onsets. Typically, in this task, healthy, normal subjects
tend to look at the target that appeared first. Stroke or lesions of specific nodes of the oculomotor
network, such as the frontal eye fields (FEF) or the lateral intraparietal area (LIP), strongly a↵ect
this behavior (Rorden et al., 1997; Ro et al., 2001; Schiller and Tehovnik, 2003; Wardak et al., 2004;
Kubanek et al., 2015). These oculomotor circuits preferentially represent targets in their contralateral
visual hemifield (Fig. 1B). As a consequence, when neurons in these circuits are a↵ected by a stroke,
the contralateral visual hemifield is underrepresented, and subjects preferentially decide to look at the
ipsilesional target (Rorden et al., 1997; Ro et al., 2001). These e↵ects are also observed for other kinds of
neural perturbations, such as when neuromodulatory agents are injected into these regions. For example,
when muscimol—a potent neuroinhibitory drug—is injected into left FEF of macaques (Schiller and
Tehovnik, 2003), animals performing this task exhibit a strong ipsilateral—leftward bias (Fig. 1C, red).
In contrast, injecting a drug with opposite, disinhibitory e↵ects such as bicuculine into the same region
(Schiller and Tehovnik, 2003) leads to an opposite, contralateral bias (Fig. 1C, blue). Analogous results
are obtained for neuromodulatory interventions into area LIP (Hanks et al., 2006; Schiller and Tehovnik,

2003; Wardak et al., 2004; Kubanek et al., 2015). This task therefore provides a well established framework
that enables us to interpret the neuromodulatory e↵ects of ultrasound—or any other intervention, for
that matter. Excitatory interventions or stimuli bias subjects’ decisions in the contralateral direction,
whereas inhibitory interventions in the opposite direction.
We used this framework to evaluate the polarity and size of the e↵ects of ultrasound on neurons
(Fig. 1A). In a given session, ultrasound was applied to the animals’ left or right FEF. Ultrasound was
applied in blocks of 3-6 trials and was strictly interleaved with blocks of 3-6 trials in which ultrasound
was not applied to exclude potential e↵ects of session time. The stimulus was applied while an animal
was making his decision: 100 ms prior to the onset of the first target, and the stimulation lasted for 300
ms. Given that animals responded on average within 171 and 263 ms (monkey A and B, respectively),
this perturbation influences a substantial portion of the decision-making process.
The ultrasound stimulus (Fig. 1D) had neuromodulatory parameters (0.6 MegaPa, 270 kHz, 300
ms duration, 500 Hz pulse repetition frequency, 50% duty cycle) that fell into commonly used ranges.
We chose a relatively low carrier frequency of 270 kHz so that we could be confident that the stimulus
would e↵ectively penetrate the animals’ skull (Deffieux et al., 2013). As a consequence of this choice,
the stimulus was relatively broad as indicated by our measurements of free field pressure (Fig. 1D). Full
width at half maximum pressure was 10.5 mm in the lateral dimension and 21.8 mm in the axial direction
below the skull.
Animals showed typical choice behavior in this task, being sensitive to the di↵erence in target onset
times (Fig. 2A, black curves). As in previous studies (Rorden et al., 1997; Ro et al., 2001; Schiller
and Tehovnik, 2003; Wardak et al., 2004; Kubanek et al., 2015), the earlier a target appeared before the
subsequent target, the more likely the animal was to choose that target. Critically, transcranial ultrasound
had a strong influence on this choice behavior (Fig. 2A, blue curves). In the trials in which ultrasound
was applied to left FEF (left column), animals were more likely to choose the rightward target. The e↵ect
reversed polarity when ultrasound was applied to right FEF (right column): in this case, animals were
more likely to choose the leftward target. These single-session e↵ects were significant (p < 0.0017, twotailed two-sample proportion tests) with the exception of the monkey A left FEF example (p = 0.074).
These examples suggest that ultrasound biases the animals’ decisions in the contralateral direction.
To quantify these e↵ects across all sessions, we measured the proportion of rightward choices on
ultrasound trials at the time point at which the animals chose both targets at equal proportion when
not stimulated (see Materials and Methods). We did this separately for each session and present the
average over sessions (Fig. 2B). This analysis shows that targeting left FEF increased the proportion of
rightward choices (Fig. 2B, left). The e↵ect was especially strong in monkey A, who chose the rightward

Figure 1. Task and Stimulus.

A) Task. The subject fixates a central target. One target appears in the left or the right

visual hemifield. After a brief random delay, a second target appears in the opposite hemifield. The subject is free to look at either
target after the first target has been presented, and receives a liquid reward if he looks at a target within a 2

acceptance window.

Ultrasound is applied in blocks of 3-6 trials, strictly interleaved with no stimulation blocks of the same duration, 100 ms prior to the
appearance of the first target. B) Functional characterization of the visuomotor system. We delivered the ultrasound non-invasively
(intact skull and skin) into the frontal eye fields (FEF). From anatomical and functional studies, it is known that left/right FEF
preferentially represents targets in the right/left visual hemifield. The outline of the FEF was rendered using the Calabrese et al.
(2015) atlas with Paxinos brain regions. C) E↵ects in previous studies. When a large amount of strong inhibitory/disinhibitory
drugs is injected into left FEF in this task, animals show a strong ipsilateral/contralateral bias in this task (reproduced from
Schiller and Tehovnik, 2003, with permission). These results are as expected given the contralateral nature of the visual hemifield
representation (B), and are analogous when other nodes of the visuomotor network, such as the parietal area LIP, are perturbed.
D) Stimulus. The ultrasound stimulus (0.6 MPa, 270 kHz, 300 ms duration) was pulsed at 500 Hz with 1 ms tone burst duration.
The ultrasound was applied through a coupling cone filled with agar gel. The resulting pressure, measured in free field, is provided
along the lateral (1 mm steps) and axial (2 mm steps) dimensions in color.

was significantly di↵erent from 50% across the 8 sessions in this animal (p = 0.0015, t7 = 5.0). The e↵ect
is substantial—at a nearly 66% bias, the monkey chose the rightward target nearly twice as often as

the leftward target. The e↵ect was statistically significant also in monkey B, and was highly significant
across the two animals (p = 0.0002, t15 = 4.9). As in the single session examples (Fig. 2A, right
column), the e↵ect reversed polarity on the trials in which right FEF was stimulated (Fig. 2B, right).
The monkeys chose the rightward target at the point of equal preference only in 42.2% of cases, and
this di↵ered significantly from the 50% equal preference (p = 0.0009, t15 =

4.12). These e↵ects are

graphically summarized at the bottom of Fig. 2B. Stimulation of left FEF significantly increased the
proportion of rightward choices, whereas stimulation of right FEF significantly increased the proportion
of leftward choices. The contralateral nature of these shifts suggests that ultrasound led to a heightened
target representation by neurons within the stimulated regions (Fig. 2).
It is worth noting that the point of equal preference for monkey A is generally substantially distinct
from 0 (Fig. 2A, top row, black curves). This means that the animal shows an inherent preference for one
of the targets. Such an inherent bias is very common in this free choice task, and can vary substantially
from session to session (Noudoost and Moore, 2011). To ensure that this variability did not influence
our results, monkey B performed the same task with the exception that he was trained to choose the
target that appeared first (see Materials and Methods). This step greatly reduces the mean and variance
of inherent bias (Kubanek et al., 2015). Fig. 2B shows that from retrospect, this additional control was
not necessary—the e↵ects point in the same direction in both animals, and are on average of comparable
size.
We investigated the e↵ects on the animals’ decision-making in more detail. In particular, we asked
whether ultrasound shifted the decision curves along the horizontal axis and/or changed the curves’ slope
(see Materials and Methods). We fitted the decision curves with a two-parameter sigmoid fit (Kubanek
et al., 2015), separately for the stimulated and non-stimulated decision curves within each session. We
indeed found that ultrasound shifted the curves along the horizontal axis (Fig. 3). Left FEF stimulation
shifted the decision curves on average by
across the sessions (p < 0.001, t15 =

7.6 ms (Fig. 3, left), and this e↵ect was highly significant

4.3; two-sided t-test). A leftward shift indicates, for a given

di↵erence in target onset times, that the animals were more likely to choose the rightward target when
stimulated. The e↵ect reversed polarity during right FEF stimulation, shifting the decision curves by
+5.6 ms across the sessions. Also this e↵ect was highly significant (p = 0.0064, t15 = 3.2). A rightward
shift indicates, for a given di↵erence in target onset times, that the animals were more likely to choose
the leftward target when stimulated. These e↵ects were significant within individual sessions (Table 1).
Stimulation of left FEF produced a significant horizontal shift of decision curves in 7/16 sessions, by an
average of

13.4 ms (compared to

7.6 ms across all 16 sessions). Stimulation of right FEF produced

a significant horizontal shift in 3/16 sessions, by an average of +11.1 ms (compared to +5.6 ms across

parameters fitted to each decision curve (rows) changed significantly during ultrasound stimulation. See Materials
and Methods for details of the statistical test. The right column shows the average magnitude of the change over
the significant sessions. Horizontal position is measured in milliseconds; slope in per millisecond.

Compared to the notable horizontal shifts of the decision curves, ultrasound had only a mild e↵ect on
the slope of the curves. Significant shallowing was arguably observed only during left FEF stimulation
(a mean change of
t15 =

0.0095; p = 0.032, t15 =

2.4); not during right FEF stimulation (p = 0.22,

1.3)). The e↵ect was significant in only 1/16 sessions (Table 1). The lack of substantial shallowing

suggests that ultrasound did not notably impair the animals’ ability to distinguish the onsets of the two
targets.
Stimulation of the FEF with moderate electric currents is known to elicit saccades into the contralateral hemifield (Bruce et al., 1985; Tehovnik et al., 2000). The magnitude of the stimulating current
influences the saccadic endpoint—the larger the current, the farther away from the central fixation point
a saccade lands (Bruce et al., 1985; Tehovnik et al., 2000). We therefore tested whether ultrasonic

stimulation of FEF produces a similar phenomenon. We found a small but significant e↵ect on horizontal
saccadic endpoints (Fig. 4). The e↵ects point in the expected direction based on previous electrical
microstimulation studies. For left FEF stimulation, the animals’ saccade endpoints attained an additional
0.20 for contralateral saccades (Fig. 4, left). This e↵ect is small given that the eccentricity of the targets
was 6 , but it was highly significant (p = 0.001, t14 =

4.0; two-sided t-test; one session lacked saccade

trace data). The e↵ect was not significant for ipsilateral choices (p = 0.95). Conversely, stimulation of
right FEF brought the endpoints farther in the opposite, leftward direction (Fig. 4, right). It did so

that subjected the FEF to ultrasound of similar parameters (Deffieux et al., 2013), we did not observe
ultrasound directly eliciting saccades. We did not observe a significant e↵ect of ultrasound stimulation
on the animals’ reaction time, either for contralateral or for ipsilateral choices.

Figure 4. Ultrasound translates saccade endpoints further in the contralateral direction.

The

histograms show the change in horizontal saccade endpoints (visual degrees) following ultrasonic stimulation as a trial average
over each session. The left/right panels specifically show the e↵ects for contralateral (right/left) choices. The stars indicate the
e↵ect significance (two-sided t-test; ⇤: p < 0.05, ⇤⇤: p < 0.01, ⇤ ⇤ ⇤: p < 0.001). No significant e↵ects on vertical saccade endpoints
were observed.

We investigated how rapidly the e↵ect emerges and whether it is cumulative or, in contrast, whether
there is an adaptation. Our task interleaves blocks of stimulated and non-stimulated trials (each 3-6
trials in duration). This block design enables us to assess the dynamics of the ultrasound e↵ects as a
function of the number of successively stimulated trials. To do so, we pooled data across right and left
FEF stimulation sites and present the average proportion of contralateral choices as a function of trial

block. This suggests that FEF circuitry of the animals adapts to the stimulation, either at the level of
FEF neurons or within a broader perceptual system.
The di↵erential e↵ects of right and left FEF stimulation (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4) demonstrate that
the e↵ects are specific to the stimulated regions. To further validate this observation, we applied the
same stimuli to control regions 10 mm more posterior to FEF, i.e., the motor cortex. Motor cortex is
not involved in oculomotor choices and so in this case, there should be no e↵ects on animals’ choices or
saccade endpoints. We collected data in 11 sessions of left motor cortex stimulation and 11 sessions of
right motor cortex stimulation. Besides the change in the stimulation location, data were collected in the
same way as with the FEF stimulation. In contrast to FEF stimulation, motor cortex stimulation did not
elicit significant biases in choice behavior (Fig. 6). There were no significant shifts from equal preference
(left motor cortex: p = 0.43, t10 =

0.82; right motor cortex: p = 0.36, t10 = 0.95) and no significant

horizontal shifts (left motor cortex: p = 0.5, t10 =

0.70; right motor cortex: p = 0.31, t10 =

1.1). In

addition, stimulation of left and right motor cortex did not significantly change the horizontal position
or slope of the decision curves within single sessions. Motor cortex stimulation did not produce an e↵ect
on horizontal or vertical saccade endpoints (p > 0.13 for all four combinations of left and right motor
cortex stimulation and contralateral and ipsilateral choices).

Discussion
We report that transcranial ultrasound can modulate neurons to the extent that it can influence spatial
choices of non-human primates. We used an established task that allowed us to assess the polarity, size,
and spatial specificity of the e↵ects.

Same format as in Fig. 2 and Fig.

3, for ultrasound stimulation of left motor cortex (left panel) and right motor cortex (right panel).

We found that stimulation of left/right FEF biased animals’ choices rightward/leftward (Fig. 2).
Based on previous studies, this finding suggests that our pulsed ultrasound stimulus enhanced the
representation of the contralateral target within the FEF. In comparison, neuronal inhibition—be it
temporary using injected drugs or permanent following lesions—produces shifts of opposite polarity
(Rorden et al., 1997; Ro et al., 2001; Schiller and Tehovnik, 2003; Wardak et al., 2004; Kubanek et
al., 2015). We therefore conclude that our stimulus, at least in part, excited neurons within the FEF.
This finding is supported by a study that recorded neuronal responses within supplementary eye fields
in response to ultrasonic FEF stimulation in an anti-saccade task (Wattiez et al., 2017).
The e↵ect was moderate. It was much smaller than e↵ects attained using large injections of potent
neuromodulatory drugs (Fig. 1C), but of comparable size to injections of smaller drug volumes (Kubanek
et al., 2015) or electrical microstimulation of another node of the oculomotor network, area LIP (Hanks
et al., 2006). It is possible that the magnitude of our e↵ects is diminished by our block design, which
frequently interleaved stimulated and non-stimulated blocks within a session. In such a block design,
carry-over e↵ects from stimulated to non-stimulated trials and/or adaptation to stimulation may reduce

the total e↵ect contrast. Nonetheless, the finding that noninvasive ultrasound can produce e↵ects of
similar magnitudes as those induced by drugs injected through craniotomies has strong implications for
future research of basic brain function. Ultrasound, by virtue of its noninvasiveness and spatial flexibility,
may for the first time enable us to screen the contribution of specific brain regions to a given behavior
or disease sign systematically, one by one, and in a personalized fashion (Kubanek, 2018).
The ultrasonic e↵ect was specific to the stimulated region, based on two lines of evidence. First,
reversing the stimulation hemisphere reversed the e↵ect polarity (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). This constitutes
a double dissociation of the e↵ect through di↵erent brain regions. In addition, there were no e↵ects
when stimulating control regions that are not involved in oculomotor choice, i.e., right and left motor
cortex (Fig. 6). Being able to demonstrate a double dissociation regarding the stimulation site is critical
to control for generic artifacts that can be associated with propagating ultrasound (Guo et al., 2018;
Sato et al., 2018).
We discovered that the biasing e↵ect manifests primarily as a horizontal shift of the decision curves
(Fig. 3,Table 1). This finding suggests that our stimulus enhanced the representation of the contralateral
target within the FEF. Notably, the slope of the decision curves remained largely intact, with a significant
shallowing observed only in 1/16 sessions (Table 1). This indicates that ultrasound did not fundamentally impair the animal’s ability to perceive the stimuli. On the contrary, it apparently enhanced the
representation of the contralateral target such that it was more likely to be chosen on a given stimulation
trial. Future studies should systematically vary the time and duration within which the ultrasound is
applied (we only applied the ultrasound for 300 ms starting 100 ms prior to the appearance of the first
target) to specifically impact the sensory, decision-related, and motor stages of the choice process.
There was a small but significant e↵ect on the amplitude of saccades directed into the hemifield
contralateral to the stimulated FEF (Fig. 4). A↵ecting a saccade metric such as saccade endpoint
may appear as evidence of ultrasound acting, in part, on motor aspects of saccade planning within
FEF. An equally likely possibility, however, is that ultrasound enhanced or shifted the perception of the
contralateral target, thus resulting in a slight increase in saccade amplitude. Recording neural activity
from FEF and from other, non-stimulated nodes of the oculomotor network such as the parietal area LIP,
might help to distinguish between these possibilities.
Our blocked design allowed us to assess the e↵ect progression as a function of the number of consecutive
stimuli (Fig. 5). A neuromodulation e↵ect can be constant in time, cumulative—increasing with each
additional intervention, or diminishing—decreasing with each additional intervention. We found evidence
for the latter kind. The e↵ect emerged immediately, within the first stimulated trial. It then gradually
decreased in size until becoming insignificant at about 4-5th consecutive stimulation trial. This indicates

that the system adapted to the repetitive stimulation. The nature of this adaptation is currently unknown.
One possibility is that the adaptation occurs at the molecular level, whereby the molecular machinery
gradually loses sensitivity to repetitive excitation. This possibility is likely given the emerging view
that the e↵ects of ultrasound on neurons are of a mechanical kind. In particular, the mechanical forces
associated with propagating ultrasound displace membranes and this way open mechanosensitive ion
channels (Tyler, 2011; Kubanek et al., 2018; Prieto et al., 2018). It has been demonstrated that such
mechanosensing molecules adapt to repetitive mechanical stimulation (Ge↵eney and Goodman, 2012).
We used a relatively low stimulation frequency (Deffieux et al., 2013) to diminish the role of the skull
in neuromodulatory outcomes (Lee et al., 2016). As a consequence, the pressure field associated with our
stimulus was relatively broad (Fig. 1D). Although this may appear as a drawback from the perspective of
future applications, this in fact provided two benefits in regard to the basic aims of this study. First, the
stimulus provided a certain level of tolerance in our FEF targeting. Second, the oblong depth geometry
enabled us to stimulate an entire depth of the anterior bank of the arcuate sulcus, a region associated
with the FEF. However, it is worth noting that the relatively broad stimulus in part likely influenced
other neighboring regions, such as the DLPFC. Future studies can use much more circumscribed stimuli
to realize the focusing strength of ultrasound (e.g, about 3 mm half-width when applied through the
human skull using large, helmet-like arrays (Ghanouni et al., 2015) and less than 1 mm half-width when
applied through a mouse skull (Li et al., 2016)).
The choice paradigm (Fig. 1) used in this study o↵ers several benefits to future studies. First, it can
be applied to characterize the e↵ect polarity, size, and spatial specificity of any insonation—and, for that
matter—of any neuromodulation protocol. This includes non-invasive (transcranial magnetic/electrical
stimulation) and invasive (optogenetics, electrical microstimulation, pharmacological injections) neuromodulation approaches. Second, the block paradigm can be modified (e.g., increased in duration), so
that also plastic, long-term e↵ects associated with long-term stimulation (?) can be assessed. Third,
the paradigm provides the means to quantify the e↵ect polarity, size, and local specificity noninvasively,
from a subject’s choice behavior. And finally, the task is easy to learn and master for animals, which is
of tremendous asset in NHP studies.
In summary, we used a task commonly employed in neurology and NHP research to quantify the
polarity, size, and spatial specificity of the e↵ects of transcranial focused ultrasound on neurons in NHPs.
We demonstrate that ultrasound can noninvasively modulate neurons in oculomotor circuits and so
substantially influence animals’ spatial decisions. We show that the e↵ect points in the contralateral
direction, that its size is comparable to moderate injections of neuromodulatory drugs into oculomotor
regions, and that the e↵ect is localized since stimulating the opposite hemisphere reverses the e↵ect’s

polarity. A major contribution of the study is the demonstration that the e↵ects of ultrasound on
neurons in NHPs are of sufficient magnitude to modulate behavior. This is critical because flexible,
systematic neuromodulation of neural circuits can enable rapid and causal screening of the candidate
circuits involved in specific disorders. This way, ultrasonic neuromodulation may realize its potential in
noninvasive and personalized diagnoses of a variety of brain conditions, and provide a tool to enable new,
causal investigations of basic brain function in humans.

Materials and Methods
Subjects
Two adult male rhesus monkeys (macaca mulatta, monkey A: 13 kg, monkey B: 7 kg) participated in
this study. The animals sat head-fixed in a custom designed monkey chair in a completely dark room.
Visual stimuli were displayed on a LCD monitor positioned 25 cm in front of the animals’ eyes. Eye
position was monitored using a camera (EyeLink). All procedures conformed to the Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved Stanford University Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee.
Task
Monkeys were trained in a visual discrimination task that has been used to measure neural deficits
or enhancements in previous studies (Rorden et al., 1997; Schiller and Chou, 1998; Ro et al., 2001;
Wardak et al., 2002; Scherberger et al., 2003; Balan and Gottlieb, 2009). Briefly, in this task, monkeys
first acquired a fixation target. After a short delay, a first target (gray square of 0.5 by 0.5 ) appeared
in the left (right) part of the screen, 6 away from the center of fixation. After a random delay ([0, 130]
ms, adjusted to the performance of each monkey), a second target, of identical parameters, appeared in
the right (left) part of the screen. The order of appearance (left versus right) was randomized from trial
to trial. Once presented, both targets remained present until a choice was made. To receive a liquid
reward, the animals had to make a saccade to one of the targets within 1 s after the appearance of the
first target. The animal had to make the saccade within a 2

acceptance window and remain in the

window for at least 100 ms. In monkey A, choice of either target was rewarded. This free choice task
is commonly associated with a substantial bias preference for one of the targets, and this bias varies
considerably across days (Noudoost and Moore, 2011). To test whether our results are independent
of this bias, monkey B was only rewarded for choosing the target that appeared first. This e↵ectively

mitigates a bias (Kubanek et al., 2015). The e↵ects of ultrasonic stimulation had the same polarity and
were comparable in magnitude in both monkeys.
Ultrasonic stimulation
Ultrasound was applied in blocks of 3-6 trials (the specific number was drawn from uniform distribution
bounded between 3 and 6) and was strictly interleaved with blocks of 3-6 trials in which ultrasound was
not applied. In monkey A (B), ultrasound was applied on average in 379 (481) trials per session; the
stimulated trials constitute 50% of total trials. We stimulated the macaque frontal eye fields (FEF) using
the same approach and transducer as described previously (Deffieux et al., 2013). The main di↵erence
is that our transducer operated at 270 kHz instead of 320 kHz, and we used a longer stimulus, 300 ms
instead of 100 ms. The single element transducer (H-115, diameter 64 mm, Sonic Concepts), geometrically
focused to 63 mm, was used with a coupling cone filled with agar. The height of the cone was chosen
such that the geometric focus was located 5 mm below the skull, to ensure that ultrasound stimulated
neurons within the entire depth of the arcuate sulcus. Pulsed stimulus (300 ms duration, 500 Hz pulse
repetition frequency, 50% duty cycle; Fig. 1D) was generated using a commercial function generator
(33520B, Keysight) and subsequently amplified using a commercial amplifier (A150, E&I). As previously
(Deffieux et al., 2013), the output pressure maximum was set to 0.6 MPa. The pressure field (Fig. 1D)
was characterized in vitro in free field, using Aims III (Onda) water tank filled with distilled and degassed
water. The same coupling cone filled with agar gel as that used in the main experiment was used in these
measurements; no ex-vivo skull was present. The measurements were taken using a calibrated fibre-optic
hydrophone (Precision Acoustics). The distribution of the pressure field was measured using a robotized
moving stage (Aims III) and characterized in 1 (2) mm steps in the lateral (axial) dimensions (Fig. 1D).
The animals were not sacrificed following the experiments and so the exact value of the pressure below
the skull is not known. During the experiment, the animals’ hair was shaved and degassed ultrasound
gel applied on the skin to mediate good acoustic coupling between the agar-filled coupling cone and the
skin. The FEF target was localized using anatomical MRI images.
Characterization of decision curves
We fitted decision curves of each session with a sigmoid function. The fit was performed separately for
stimulated and non-stimulated data (e.g., blue and black curves in Fig. 2A). We used the same fourparameter fit as a previous study (Kubanek et al., 2015). This fit is mathematically equivalent to logistic
fit, with the exception that it features two additional parameters to capture also vertical properties

where P (x) is the probability (frequency) of choosing the rightward target (i.e., the individual points of
each decision curve), slope defines the steepness of the curve, horizpos corresponds to the position of the
curve along the horizontal axis (for vertscale = 1 and vertpos = 0, x = horizpos corresponds to the point
of equal preference), vertscale is a scaling multiplier along the vertical axis, and vertpos is a biasing term
along the vertical axis.
The parameters were fitted to the choice data using non-linear minimization (function fminsearch in
Matlab), minimizing the squared error between the fitted and the actual psychometric curves.
From this equation, the point of equal preference used in the analysis of Fig. 2B, x50 is determined

x50 was computed for each session using the non-stimulated decision curve. Using the stimulated
decision curve, we then evaluated the proportion of rightward choices P (x50 ) at this point of equal
preference. Fig. 2B shows the average P (x50 ) across the individual sessions.
In Fig. 3, “horizontal shift” is the di↵erence in the fitted horizpos values of the stimulated and
non-stimulated curves.
Assessment of e↵ects within individual sessions
To assess how the fitted parameters changed between stimulated and non-stimulated trials in each session,
we performed a randomization test. In this test, the non-stimulated binary choice data for each di↵erence
in target onset times were sampled, with replacement, 10,000 times. Each of these re-sampled decision
curves were fit with a sigmoid function. The fitting procedure was the same as above with the exception
that we only used horizpos and slope as parameters. The main conclusions remain the same regardless
of whether we use two or four parameters, but using two parameters helped to increase the statistical
power of the analysis (we only collected a maximum of 500 stimulated trials per session). The fits
produced a null distribution of 10,000 values for each parameter. We then fitted the two parameters to
the stimulated curve, and evaluated the probability that the parameters were drawn from the respective
null distributions. If the probability was less than 0.01 for a given parameter, Bonferroni-corrected for
the number of sessions, the change was taken as significant.
