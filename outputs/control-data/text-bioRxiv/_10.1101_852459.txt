Abstract: The spongy mesophyll layer in leaves is ubiquitous among vascular plants, yet its
10

structure is relatively unknown and typically described as a disordered assemblage of
isodiametric cells. We characterized spongy mesophyll structure among diverse taxa using X-ray
microCT imaging and found that leaves with small cell sizes, high cell packing densities, and
close vein spacing were congruent with the isodiametric paradigm. When these structural traits
exceeded well-defined thresholds, the spongy mesophyll domain was instead tessellated with an

15

emergent topological motif of an irregular honeycomb that minimizes cellular investment and
obeys Euler’s Law of space filling. Our data suggest spongy mesophyll is governed by allometric
scaling laws, with two distinct topologies optimized for either photosynthetic performance or
minimal resource investment.
One Sentence Summary: Conserved topological motifs in the spongy mesophyll are

20

coordinated with leaf photosynthetic performance.

Main Text:
The laminar leaf with reticulate venation is common among terrestrial vascular plants,
and convergence on this form has occurred independently in at least four distinct lineages since
the Paleozoic (1). Despite large variation in leaf size, shape, and structure (2), the interior of
5

most laminar leaves has a conserved morphological scheme consisting of two photosynthetic
layers arising from a common dorsiventral developmental framework (3): the palisade and the
spongy mesophyll. The palisade mesophyll is generally positioned immediately below the upper
epidermis and is composed of cylindrically shaped cells oriented perpendicular to the leaf
surface. This layer is characterized by a high surface area to volume ratio that facilitates CO2

10

absorption in a region of the leaf where light is abundant and photosynthetic rates are high (4–7).
The spongy mesophyll, positioned below the palisade, is generally treated as a disordered and
loosely packed assemblage of isodiametric, or roughly spherical, cells. It is thought that this
tissue satisfies multiple biophysical roles (8) and promotes both light scattering and CO2
conductance from the stomata to the palisade (9, 10). However, testing such hypotheses requires

15

detailed structural characterization that has been difficult to achieve due to the scale, complexity,
and three-dimensional (3D) organization of the spongy mesophyll (11). Although specific
examples of non-isodiametric cell shapes in the spongy mesophyll have been reported (8, 12–
15), limited data exist on the structural organization of this tissue or how structural variation
influences leaf function. We sought to determine the 3D geometry of the spongy mesophyll

20

using X-ray microCT imaging to investigate the variation in spongy mesophyll architecture, and
to explore relationships between mesophyll structural properties and photosynthetic traits.

Using X-ray micro-computed tomography (microCT) imaging (5, 11, 16) we extracted
3D anatomical traits of the spongy mesophyll for 40 species with laminar leaves and reticulate
venation that represented every major clade of terrestrial vascular plants, with several congeneric
pairs for deeper investigations into the extent of variation between closely related species (Data
5

Set S1). This analysis revealed two dominant spongy mesophyll classes (Fig. 1) with low
topological diversity across the sampled species. Spongy mesophyll class was defined by its
organization in the paradermal plane, i.e. parallel to the leaf surface. In the first class (27% of the
species), spongy mesophyll conformed to the established isodiametric model, and was composed
of a network of interconnected small-diameter cells surrounded by continuous intercellular

10

airspace (IAS; Fig. 1A,B; 16). By observation, this class of spongy mesophyll has a disordered
3D network best described as an open-cell foam (17).
In contrast, spongy mesophyll in the second class was composed of layers of mesh-like
tissue that conformed to the topological principles governing a honeycomb (Fig. 1C,D; 17). The
honeycomb topology was present in 72.5% of the species sampled (21 of 30 genera). Congeneric

15

sampling revealed that spongy mesophyll topology was conserved within the genus for our
dataset (Data Set S1). While we restricted our analysis to the former two groups for species with
reticulate venation, we note that deviation from those two classes occurred, including in spinach
(Spinacia oleracea, Fig. S1A) with highly elongated cells forming large and continuous airspace
volumes, and in the aquatic water lily, Nuphar polysepela, with elongated chambers presumably

20

to increase the air-space volume required for buoyancy (Fig. S1B). A distinctive third class of
spongy mesophyll was observed in leaves with parallel venation (n = 4), in which strands of
elongated mesophyll attached to veins at right angles, forming an approximately rectilinear
lattice (Fig. S2).

Honeycomb mesophyll was composed of vertically stacked and horizontally aligned
lattice layers. IAS columns formed by this alignment were typically positioned above stomata,
forming conduits through the vertical profile of the leaf (Fig. 1C; Movies S1, S2). This supports
the concept, suggested as early as 1914 by Haberlandt (8), that a primary function of the spongy
5

mesophyll is to maximize CO2 diffusion from stomata to the palisade, and provides insight into
the shape and size of the substomatal cavity (18, 19). However, IAS connectivity was not strictly
unidirectional. Rather, the vertical alignment of the individual mesophyll cell layers was often
slightly offset or contained gaps, which would allow for lateral diffusion of CO2 between
adjacent IAS columns (20, 21).

10

To quantitatively examine the structure of the honeycomb spongy mesophyll (n = 29
species), we used the framework established by Gibson and Ashby (1999) for cellular solids
(Data Set S1), for which honeycomb properties are derived from the packing scheme in the
principal plane, i.e. the paradermal plane for plant leaves. Traits (Data Set S1) were measured on
paradermal slices of spongy mesophyll (Fig. 2A,B) obtained via microCT imaging (Fig. 2C) and

15

validated with fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2D). At the cellular scale, the honeycomb structure
was composed of cells with arm-like protrusions with a variety of individual morphologies (Fig.
2D). Yet, the tissue scale organization was largely invariant, highly ordered, and obeyed the
topological constraints of Euler’s Law (17), which governs how geometrical indices give rise to
aggregate properties for continuous 2D honeycombs, and predicts the formation of hexagons

20

from triply-joined vertices of a lattice. The most efficient honeycombs are hexagonal lattices,
which minimize investment in materials needed to tessellate a 2D plane (22). Hexagonal
honeycombs are characterized by their vertices that sit at the junction where edges meet, with a
mean edge connectivity (Ze) of three, a mean number of edges (𝑛𝑛�) surrounding the hexagons of

dataset, the spongy mesophyll tissue lattice had vertices that were joined by Ze = 3.03 ± 0.02, the

structure, we calculated the tessellation entropy (S) for each sample, which would be zero for a
perfectly ordered hexagonal honeycomb. We found a mean tessellation entropy of 1.43 ± 0.03,
which is similar to values reported for irregular hexagonal honeycomb morphologies in
engineered thin films (S = 1.48; 23). We also found evidence for a distribution of IAS polygon
5

sizes and classes (Fig. 2G,H) within the void space of the honeycomb lattice that satisfied
additional topological rules anticipated from a contiguous 2D honeycomb lattice. As given by the
Aboav-Weaire Law (24) for neighboring polygon relationships, the occurrence of an IAS
polygon with a lower than average number of edges (n < 6) introduced a corresponding polygon
with a higher number of edges into the aggregate (Fig. 2I, upper panel). As expected from

10

Lewis’ Rule of polygon size dispersion (Fig. 2I, lower panel), which is derived from the space
filling properties of plant epithelial cells (25), the area of a given IAS polygon varied linearly
with its number of edges. These data indicate that the spongy mesophyll and IAS matrix meet the
assumptions for a hexagonal honeycomb with some irregularity as would be expected in a
biological system (17) where multiple stresses act upon the structure throughout development.

15

Taken together, these indices (Fig. 2F-I) show the applicability of the 2D honeycomb framework
to spongy mesophyll tissue and quantify the dispersion of sizes and shapes of the IAS voids,
which may provide insight for future work into the developmental processes by which the tissue
was formed (17). We conclude that an irregular hexagonal honeycomb topology characterizes a
common spongy mesophyll phenotype that spans a wide range of terrestrial plants, including

20

representatives from the fern, gymnosperm, basal angiosperm (ANITA), magnoliid, and eudicot
clades. The observation that some cells within the honeycomb lattice can be isodiametric while
others have varying numbers of arm-like protrusions (Fig. 2D) implies that this structure may be
formed by an arbitrary number of configurations of cell morphologies that, at the tissue scale,

result in conservation of the global, ordered honeycomb topology governed by simple rules of
cellular organization and optimality of resource allocation. Our data suggest that leaves with the
honeycomb topology have optimized the construction of the spongy mesophyll to minimize
cellular investment in a way that facilitates the vertical diffusion of CO2 from the stomatal pore,
5

through the spongy mesophyll layer, and into the palisade tissue where light is most abundant for
photosynthesis. This finding weakens the paradigm of spongy mesophyll as inherently
disordered, and suggests that the emergent tissue structure is driven by conserved developmental
(26), biomechanical, or physiological requirements, with distinct spongy mesophyll classes
optimized for divergent functional goals.

10

Drivers of phenotypic variation
To understand what factors were associated with variation in spongy mesophyll
phenotype, random forest analysis was used to rank the importance of various anatomical,
environmental, and taxonomic traits (Data Set S1) in classifying mesophyll as honeycomb
(discretized IAS domains in the paradermal plane, n = 29; Fig. 1C,D) or non-honeycomb

15

(continuous IAS in the paradermal plane, n = 11; Fig. 1A,B). Spongy mesophyll phenotype was
best predicted by three anatomical traits (Fig. 3A): cell arm length (AL), cell packing density, and
the characteristic minimum vein spacing (see Supplementary Materials). Mesophyll
classification showed steep transitional thresholds from honeycomb to non-honeycomb
phenotypes at AL values below ~12 µm (Fig. 3B), as cell packing density exceeded ~2000 cells

20

mm-2 (Fig. 3C), and as minimum vein spacing fell below ~0.1 mm (Fig. 3D). Therefore, leaves
with smaller, more densely packed spongy mesophyll cells and closely spaced veins were more
likely to exhibit non-honeycomb topology with continuous IAS domains, while leaves with
fewer, larger cells per unit leaf area and more distantly spaced veins were more likely to exhibit

the honeycomb topology with columnar airspace domains. The transition between phenotypes
also corresponded to notable thresholds (Fig. S5) in vein density (Dv) and stomatal density (Ds).
The non-honeycomb phenotype was associated with Dv above ~9 mm mm-2 and Ds above ~260
stomata mm-2, which are trait values typically associated with angiosperm eudicots (27) and
5

correlated with high photosynthetic rates (28). Cell arm length was significantly correlated
(Spearman correlation, rs) with other leaf traits (Table S1), such that increases in cell arm length
generally reflected increases in the characteristic dimensions of the entire structure, e.g. cell arm
diameter (rs = 0.95, p < 0.001), stomatal guard cell length (rs = 0.78, p < 0.001), and the diameter
of the IAS voids in the honeycomb lattice (rs = 0.83, p < 0.001). These relationships retained

10

significance after accounting for shared evolutionary history (Table S2).
With the indication that cell size, cell packing density, and vein spacing played an
important role in phenotypic variation, we then explored the relationships between these traits.
First, cell packing density followed power law scaling with AL (R2 = 0.93, F(1,38) = 520.2, P <
0.001; Fig. 3E), showing that increasing that cell packing density resulted from shortening cell

15

arm length. We note that cell counts taken from the transverse plane (as is typically done with
light microscopy; 16) could lead to overestimations of cell packing density because cells with
more articulated or more numerous arms could be counted multiple times, confounding the
patterns in space filling and cellular organization apparent in the paradermal plane. Cell packing
density was lower in species with long cell arms, which may reflect either a lower number of cell

20

divisions or larger minimum cell size in the spongy mesophyll during development (29).
Minimum vein spacing and AL scaled allometrically (R2 = 0.66, F(1,38) = 74, P < 0.001,
Fig. 3F), with eudicots having both the shortest distances between veins and the smallest cells.
This relationship between minimum vein spacing and cell size is consistent with previous work

showing that early Cretaceous angiosperms underwent reductions in cell size and increases in
cell packing densities that elevated the conductance to CO2 and water necessary to increase
photosynthetic rates (27, 28, 30–32). In terms of biomechanics, leaves with higher vein density
have an abundance of semi-rigid xylem conduits that provide mechanical support (27). In
5

contrast, the honeycomb structure itself is positioned between the upper and lower epidermises
like in a sandwich beam (33), and could produce a lightweight material that is elastic when
loaded in the paradermal plane and stiff when loaded normal to the leaf surface, much like the
manufactured honeycombs used in packing materials (17).
Structural trait scaling and functional implications

10

Cells of the spongy mesophyll were best characterized by a power law relationship
between the length and diameter of the cell arms (R2 = 0.81, F(1,35) = 148.3, P < 0.001; Fig. 4A)
with the honeycomb phenotype represented in gymnosperm (Fig. 4B), fern (Fig. 4C), ANITA
(Fig. 4D), magnoliid (Fig. 4E), and eudicot (Fig. 4F) species, and the non-honeycomb phenotype
represented only in eudicots (Fig. 4G). There were two notably unoccupied sectors of this two-

15

dimensional trait space. First, no species in our dataset were found with large, isodiametric cells.
Such a cell would have an extremely large volume, as found in succulent and epiphytic plants
(16, 34). Such species may operate with a different biochemical pathway (CAM vs. C3), where
large cell volume favors malic acid accumulation and water storage, as opposed to optimization
of the mesophyll for high rates of liquid and vapor diffusion necessary for C3 photosynthesis

20

(31). Second, there were no species that had cells with highly elongated, narrow arms. This may
be due to biomechanical limitations, or to conserve a minimum distance between the nuclear
envelope and the cell membrane for intracellular translocation.

To explore how spongy mesophyll structural traits predict photosynthetic properties of
the leaf, we first modeled the spongy mesophyll cell surface area per unit tissue volume exposed
to the intercellular airspace (SAmes/Vmes) as a function of cell arm length. SAmes/Vmes is a
5

measure of the evaporative and absorptive surface exposed to the IAS, and represents an
intermediate step in the liquid-vapor pathway between veins and stomata. SAmes/Vmes is,
therefore, a critical link between vein density and stomatal conductance in optimizing the
hydraulic and diffusive pathways to increase leaf photosynthetic capacity (35). We found that as
arm length increased, SAmes/Vmes of the spongy mesophyll sharply decreased according to a

10

power law (R2 = 0.83, F(1,38) = 188.7, P < 0.001; Fig. 4H). Thus, plants with larger cells such as
the fern Platycerium andinum (Fig. 4C), which were also more likely to exhibit the honeycomb
phenotype, had lower SAmes/Vmes in the spongy mesophyll compared to eudicots, such as
Helianthus annuus (sunflower), with smaller cells and the non-honeycomb phenotype (Fig. 4G).
Although cell size strongly influenced SAmes/Vmes, variation in cell geometry may also play a

15

role (14, 15). To demonstrate the implications of cell shape in our dataset, we calculated the
surface area-to-volume ratio (SA/V) for idealized geometrical models of isodiametric and triplyarmed cells using measured cell arm lengths and diameters to parameterize the analysis (Fig. S6).
As anticipated, surface area increased in triply-armed cells compared with isodiametric cells of

the same volume, with a mean difference in SA/V between the two modeled cellular geometries
of 0.069 µm2 µm-3 (s.d. = 0.029). Thus, in addition to cell size and cell packing density, cell
shape can regulate SAmes/Vmes.
Given that spongy mesophyll structure and surface area provide the physical basis for the
5

conductance of CO2 for photosynthesis, we lastly tested how leaf-level maximum photosynthetic
rate (Amax) was related to AL and SAmes/Vmes of the spongy mesophyll (Fig. 4I). Amax decreased
linearly with increasing AL (R2 = 0.50, F(1,27) = 26.65, P < 0.001; Fig. 4I). The highest Amax
values occurred among species with non-honeycomb spongy mesophyll (Data Set S1), indicating
a shift from lower to higher photosynthetic capacities as the leaf undergoes structural changes

10

from honeycomb to non-honeycomb phenotypes. Species with amphistomatous leaves such as H.
annuus and Gossypium hirsutum (cotton) were excluded from the model (shown in in Fig. 4I as
open triangles), as the capacity for gas exchange on both sides of the leaf promotes higher
photosynthetic rates (36). Amax increased linearly with increasing spongy mesophyll SAmes/Vmes
(R2 = 0.63, F(1,27) = 46.06, P < 0.001); thus, although the palisade mesophyll is typically

15

modeled with a higher photosynthetic capacity relative to the spongy mesophyll (7), there is a
strong positive relationship between the quantity of photosynthetically active surface area per
unit volume in the spongy mesophyll and leaf-level photosynthetic capacity.
Discussion
Given the historical dominance of 2D transverse analysis of leaves (Fig. 2A), our data

20

highlight the importance of 3D characterization of mesophyll structure (5, 15), scaling
relationships between morphological variation and tissue mass (37), and how tissue geometry
influences the leaf economics spectrum (38). Investment in increased vein density and stomatal
density enabled elevated rates of photosynthesis among the angiosperms, and these traits are

apparently coordinated with a striking structural shift from the irregular honeycomb topology to
the non-honeycomb topology. Our data suggest that cell size and cell packing are critical for the
development of a spongy mesophyll structure optimized for high SAmes/Vmes and the absorptive
surface for CO2 acquisition (Fig. 4). Because cell size and cell packing density are fundamentally
5

limited by genome size (32, 39), streamlining the genome makes possible the miniaturization of
xylem conduits, stomatal guard cells, and mesophyll cells, which collectively allow for higher
photosynthetic capacity by optimizing the hydraulic and diffusive pathways in the leaf (30–32).
The widespread occurrence of the honeycomb topology suggests selection has favored
minimizing cellular investment deep in the leaf where photosynthetic cells are often light-

10

limited. Honeycombs have been found widely in natural and engineered systems as
multifunctional materials for fluid transport, energy conversion, and structural support (40).
These patterns have been observed within different types of plant tissues, from epithelial cells
(25) to the venation pattern of reticulate leaves (41) where a hexagonal honeycomb topology
optimizes transport efficiency of the vascular system (42). Based on our dataset of dorsiventral

leaves with reticulate venation, it also appears that the honeycomb form may be self-similar,
where the spongy mesophyll repeats the pattern of the vasculature at a smaller scale. Thus, the
honeycombs appear in multiple tissues and across scales within the leaf. It is possible that the 3D
honeycomb structure is driven by the physical processes and stresses that arise during
development rather than functional constraints alone. Temporal and spatial coordination has been

20

observed, for example, between mesophyll airspace and epidermal cell differentiation during
development (43). The hexagonal tessellation of the spongy mesophyll domain may be the most
efficient means of meeting multiple functional demands within a single tissue type; i.e. moving
water over long distances outside the xylem, maintaining high diffusive conductance to CO2,

exporting the products of photosynthesis, and serving as a self-supporting structure when vein
density is low. Hence, for plants with relatively large mesophyll cells, distantly spaced leaf veins,
and moderate to low photosynthetic capacities, the emergent topological properties of the
irregular hexagonal honeycomb structure provide an alternative strategy for resource allocation,

a key trait dimension across the global spectrum of plant form (44). This work provides a new
framework for exploring leaf form-function relationships, developmental processes, and
physiological models (11).
