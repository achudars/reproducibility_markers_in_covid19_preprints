Abstract

41

A majority of adults in Finland are seropositive carriers of herpes simplex viruses (HSV).

42

Infection occurs at epithelial or mucosal surfaces, after which virions enter innervating nerve

43

endings, eventually establishing lifelong infection in neurons of the sensory or autonomic

44

nervous system. Recent data have highlighted the genetic diversity of HSV-1 strains, and

45

demonstrated apparent geographic patterns in strain similarity. Though multiple HSV-1 genomes

46

have been sequenced from Europe to date, there is a lack of sequenced genomes from Nordic

47

countries. Finland’s history includes at least two major waves of human migration, suggesting

48

the potential for diverse viruses to persist in the population. Here we used HSV-1 clinical isolates

49

from Finland to test the relationship between viral phylogeny, genetic variation, and phenotypic

50

characteristics. We found that Finnish HSV-1 isolates separated into two distinct phylogenetic

51

groups, potentially reflecting historical waves of human (and viral) migration into Finland. Each

52

HSV-1 isolate harbored a distinct set of phenotypes in cell culture, including differences in virus

53

production, extracellular virus release, and cell-type-specific fitness. Importantly, the

54

phylogenetic clusters were not predictive of any detectable pattern in phenotypic differences,

55

demonstrating that whole-genome relatedness is not a proxy for overall viral phenotype. Instead,

56

we highlight specific gene-level differences that may contribute to observed phenotypic

57

differences, and we note that strains from different phylogenetic groups contain the same genetic

58

variations.

Importance

60

Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) infect a majority of adults. Recent data have highlighted the

61

genetic diversity of HSV-1 strains, and demonstrated apparent genomic relatedness between

62

strains from the same geographic region. We use HSV-1 clinical isolates from Finland to test the

63

relationship between viral genomic and geographic relationships, differences in specific genes,

64

and characteristics of viral infection. We found that viral isolates from Finland separated into

65

two distinct groups of genomic and geographic relatedness, potentially reflecting historical

66

patterns of human and viral migration into Finland. These Finland HSV-1 isolates had distinct

67

infection characteristics in multiple cell types tested, which were specific to each isolate and did

68

not group according to genomic and geographic relatedness. This demonstrates that HSV-1 strain

69

differences in specific characteristics of infection are set by a combination of host cell type and

70

specific viral gene-level differences.

Introduction

76

Human herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1; Family: Herpesviridae, Genus: Simplexvirus, species:

77

Human herpesvirus 1) has been recognized as a cause of major human disease since the era of

Hippocrates (1), and to this day there is no effective vaccine (2). Approximately 50% of adults in

79

Finland are seropositive for HSV-1 (3–5), and 13% are seropositive for HSV-2 (3, 6). HSV

80

infects via epithelial or mucosal surfaces, after which it is taken up by nerve endings and

81

establishes a lifelong infection in neurons of the sensory or sympathetic nervous system. From

82

these neuronal sites the virus can reactivate, transit via nerve endings back to the skin surface,

83

and re-initiate skin or mucosal shedding at the same site as the original infection. In addition to

84

recurrent epithelial lesions, HSV also causes infectious keratitis, worsens acquisition and

85

shedding rates for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and can progress to cause rare but life-

86

threatening encephalitis (1).

87

Recent comparative genomics studies of HSV-1, from our lab and others, have demonstrated that

88

HSV-1 strains from unrelated individuals can differ in 2-4% of the viral genome (7–13). HSV-1

89

has a large DNA genome of ~152 kilobases, encoding >75 proteins (14, 15). Prior comparisons

90

of HSV-1 strains based on single-gene or whole-genome sequencing have found at least three

91

major clades that cluster geographically, with evidence of recombination between these groups

92

(16–18, 9). However these studies have focused almost exclusively on the quantification of

93

sequence diversity, without connecting these observations to experimental measures of viral

94

fitness and/or virulence. Several recent examples have demonstrated the usefulness of comparing

95

closely related virus strains to explore the effects of minor sequence differences on phenotypic

96

outcomes (19–22, 10). To date, publications examining the genome-wide diversity of HSV-1 in

97

diverse clinical isolates have not connected these observations to any classic measures of viral

98

fitness, such as viral replication in cells, or antiviral drug resistance (23–25). Based on the

99

decades of prior research leading to all current antiviral approaches for HSV-1, we anticipate that

100

a connection between viral genetic data, cell-based measures of viral fitness, and in vivo

101

measures of viral pathogenesis will be crucial to drive the next generation of viral therapeutics.

102

Examining the phenotypic differences displayed by HSV-1 strains in culture provides an

103

opportunity to explore the scope of these differences and test whether or not they are linked to

104

previously observed patterns of geographic diversity.

105

Finland has a unique history that has led to a relatively homogeneous and stable population (26–

106

28), providing a unique view on the evolution of viruses that are persistent in the population.

107

There has been gene flow contributing to human population of Finland: both from the east, and

108

from the south (southwest) (26–28). The Eastern migrations from Siberia began over 3500 years

109

ago, and allele sharing with modern East Asian populations can be observed even in present day

110

Finns (27, 28). Finland also has one of the best genealogical databases in the world, which in

111

combination with computerized medical records and a high rate of patient participation, has led

112

to many recent advances in human medical genetics (29, 30). This may enable future studies to

113

explore the co-evolution of human and viral genetic variation in this population.

114

We have characterized ten HSV-1 strains isolated from a random subset of Finland clinic visits,

115

and compared their growth properties, drug resistance, and other phenotypic features. Full

116

genome sequences of these viruses were compared to each other and to other previously

117

described strains of HSV-1, to reveal patterns of inter-host and intra-host variability. While two

118

phylogenetic sub-groups were detected at a genomic level, these sub-groups were not predictive

119

of any detectable pattern in the observed phenotypic differences, demonstrating that whole-

120

genome relatedness is not a proxy for viral phenotype. We anticipate that these data will aid in

121

efforts to develop improved sequence-based antiviral therapies, by providing additional data on

conserved vs. divergent areas of the HSV-1 genome, and contribute to development of a vaccine

123

against HSV infections based on attenuation of these or related clinical isolates (31). These data

124

present an opportunity to explore the diversity of chronic herpesviruses in the Finland

125

population, and to lay the foundation for future studies that explore the connections between

126

viral genetic differences, host genetic predispositions, and their potential relationship(s) to

127

clinical outcomes of HSV-1 infection.

128
129

Methods

130

Virus isolates and virus stock propagation

131

Clinical isolates were obtained from anonymous coded diagnostic samples from herpes lesions

132

representing currently circulating viral strains in Finland (Table 1). The virus diagnostic unit of

133

the Turku University Hospital receives viral culture samples from the whole country except for

134

the Helsinki-Uusimaa region (capital Helsinki area and the South-Eastern Finland). Recent

135

immigrations to Finland were not represented in the sample material. Approval for the study of

136

anonymous HSV isolates was provided by the Turku University Central Hospital (permit #

137

J10/17).

138

An immunoperoxidase-rapid culture assay (32) was used to type the viruses as HSV-1, which

139

was confirmed by a HSV type-specific gD (US6) gene-based PCR test (33). Viruses were

140

initially propagated on Vero cells (African green monkey kidney cells; ATCC), maintained in

141

Dulbecco's MEM with 2% fetal calf serum and gentamycin. A stock was made by addition of 3

142

ml of 9% autoclaved skimmed milk (Valio, Finland) on to 5 ml of the culture medium and

143

subsequent freezing. The cells and the medium were collected and combined upon thawing, and

144

were frozen and thawed for two further rounds before aliquoting. The viral titer was determined

145

by plaque titration on Vero cells as described before (34). Parallel aliquots were used for further

146

viral culture studies and for preparation of viral nucleocapsid DNA.

147

Statistical methods

148

For viral production data, SPSS Statistics 20 (IBM, Armonk NY, USA) software was use to

149

perform statistical analyses. Non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test was used to calculate

150

statistical significances. The threshold for significance was set to p<0.05.

151

Viral genomic DNA isolation

152

The viral genomic DNA was prepared from isolated viral nucleocapsids as described previously

153

(7, 35). In brief, viral stock collected from the first or second passage in Vero cells was used to

154

infect ~1x108 HaCaT cells (Department of Dentistry, University of Turku (36)) at a multiplicity

155

of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.1-1 plaque-forming units (PFU)/cell, and the infection was allowed to

156

proceed to completion at +35 °C (1-3 days). The cells were collected, washed with PBS and

157

suspended to LCM buffer (0.125 M KCl, 30 mM Tris pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA,

158

0.5% Nonidet P-40; with 0.6 mM beta-mercaptoethanol). After two successive extractions with

159

Freon (1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane, Sigma-Aldrich), the extracts were added on top of

160

layers in LCM buffer with 45% and 5% glycerol and ultracentrifuged at 77 000 x g for 1 h at

161

+4oC (Beckman Coulter SW41Ti rotor). Viral nucleocapsids were recovered from the bottom of

162

the ultracentrifuge tube, and the DNA was prepared by treatment with Proteinase K and SDS,

163

followed by repeated extractions with phenol-chloroform and ethanol precipitation. The DNA

164

content and purity were observed by spectrophotometry and by agarose gel electrophoresis after

165

restriction enzyme digestions.

166

Cell culture

167

Vero cells (ATCC; Manassas, VA) were propagated in M199 medium supplemented with 5%

168

fetal bovine serum and gentamycin. HaCaT cells (Department of Dentistry, University of Turku;

169

(36)) were propagated in DMEM medium with HEPES buffer, supplemented with 7% fetal

170

bovine serum and gentamycin. SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (K. Åkerman, Åbo Akademi

171

University, Turku, Finland) were propagated in DMEM (high glucose) medium supplemented

172

with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and gentamycin. Initial differentiation of SH-

173

SY5Y cells involved culture for 10 days in DMEM/F-12 medium containing 5% fetal bovine

174

serum, 10 µM All-trans retinoic acid (Sigma), 2 mM L-glutamine and gentamycin. Thereafter

175

SH-SY5Y cells were transferred on Matrigel-coated (B-D) 96-well plates and the medium was

176

changed to serum-free DMEM/F-12 medium containing 10 µM all-trans retinoic acid (Sigma),

177

0.5 µg/ml of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Millipore), 2 mM L-glutamine and gentamycin.

178

Acyclovir resistance testing

179

The sensitivity of each HSV strain to acyclovir was tested in a microplate format. Vero cells

180

grown on 96-well cell culture plates were treated with cell culture medium (DMEM with 5%

181

fetal bovine serum) supplemented with acyclovir (ACV; Sigma), in concentrations of 128 µg/ml

182

to 0.03125 µg/ml (1:4 serial dilutions). Duplicate wells containing each ACV dilution, and wells

183

without ACV, were infected with 100 PFU of each virus. As a control, the HSV-1 delta305 virus

184

was included; it is resistant to ACV due to deletion of its thymidine kinase gene (37). Infected

185

cells were incubated at +37oC, at 5% CO2, for 72 hours before fixation with methanol and

186

staining with crystal violet. The reduction of plaque numbers at each ACV dilution was observed

187

in comparison with wells infected without ACV. A logistic fit curve was used for determination

188

of IC50 values. A virus with an IC50 value of over 2 µg/ml (of ACV) was considered resistant

189

(38).

190

Image acquisition

191

Photomicrographic images of viral plaques were obtained using a Zeiss Primovert inverted

192

microscope with Plan-Achromat 4x and 10x objectives, recorded using an AxioCam ERc 5s

193

camera, and analyzed using Zeiss ZEN 2012 software.

194

Next generation sequencing

195

Viral nucleocapsid DNA was sheared on a Covaris M220 (parameters: 60 seconds duration, peak

196

power 50, 10% duty cycle, 4C). We used the Illumina TruSeq DNA Sample Prep kit to prepare

197

barcoded sequencing libraries, according to the manufacturer’s protocol for low-throughput

198

sample handling. Libraries were quantified and assessed by Qubit (Invitrogen, CA), Bioanalyzer

199

(Agilent), and library adapter qPCR (KAPA Biosystems). Illumina MiSeq paired-end sequencing

200

(2 x 300 bp) was completed according to manufacturer’s recommendations, using 17 pM library

201

concentration.

202

A consensus viral genome for each strain was assembled using a de novo viral genome assembly

203

(VirGA) workflow (10). This approach begins with quality control, including removal of

204

contaminating host sequences, adapters from library preparation, and imaging artifacts. Next

205

VirGA iterates through multiple de novo assemblies using SSAKE, which we then combine into

206

longer blocks of sequence (contigs) using Celera and GapFiller. VirGA uses Mugsy alignment to

207

match these contigs to the HSV-1 reference genome (strain 17, GenBank accession JN555585).

208

The best-matched contigs are stitched into a single consensus genome, which is then annotated

209

and subjected to additional quality control measures. These include an examination of coverage

210

(sequence read) depth, detection of minority variants within each consensus genome, and manual

211

inspection of gaps and low coverage areas. See Table 2 for GenBank accessions.

212

Intra-strain minority-variant detection

213

Minority-variant (MV) positions within each de novo assembled genome were determined using

214

VarScan v2.2.11 as previously described (19, 39). Conservative variant calling parameters to

215

eliminate sequencing-induced errors were set at: minimum allele frequency ³0.02; base call

216

quality ³20; read depth at the position ³100; independent reads supporting minor allele ³5. MVs

217

containing ³90% unidirectional strand support were excluded from further analyses (40, 41), as

218

were those occurring within 10 base pairs of one another. MVs passing quality control were

219

mapped to respective genomes and assessed for mutational effect using SnpEff and SnpSift (42,

220

43).

221

Phylogenetic and recombination analyses

222

DNA sequences were aligned using the Kalign algorithm included in eBioTools. To avoid

223

inferences caused by false phylogenetic signals, all gap and repeat regions were excluded prior to

224

this analysis. Repeat regions not leading to gaps were also excluded since these may contain

225

single nucleotide differences that have been shuffled into new positions by random aspects of

226

tandem-repeat alignment. Furthermore, nucleotides that were marked as “N” in GenBank-

Bowen et al., 2019

Manuscript in review

227

derived strains were excluded, along with the corresponding aligned nucleotides in remaining

228

sequences. Complete genomes in GenBank harbouring long stretches of “N” were not included

229

in the analysis (e.g. strain B3x_1_5). The network is based on an alignment of 116,610

230

nucleotides, which is more than 75% of the entire HSV-1 genome.

231

The phylogenetic network was constructed by using SplitsTree4. It is a NeighborNet with

232

OrdinaryLeastSquares Variance depicted as a RootedEqualAngle splitstree. A recombination test

233

on the complete dataset was performed by using the Phi test for recombination implemented in

234

SplitsTree4. Bootstrapping values greater than 80 are shown for clades with three or more

235

strains.

236

Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis

237

A cytoplasmic viral DNA preparation was modified from the protocol described by Igarashi et al

238

(44). Subconfluent Vero cell cultures were infected at an m.o.i. of 0.1, and incubated at +34oC

239

for 2 days until the cytopathic effect was complete. The cells were collected in 150 mM NaCl, 10

240

mM Tris pH 7.6, 1.5 mM MgCl buffer, with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The nuclei were pelleted, and

241

DNA was extracted from the supernatant by two successive extractions with phenol-chloroform.

242

DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. 12.5 µg of each viral DNA was diluted in 15 µl

243

solution containing sterile H2O, FastDigest 10X green buffer and FastDigest BamHI or SalI

244

restriction enzyme (Thermo Scientific). Electrophoresis was run in 0.8 % TBE-agarose gels, with

245

GeneRuler mix DNA ladder, for 24 h at 45 V before imaging. In order to separate large DNA

246

fragments after SalI digestion, electrophoresis was continued for additional 36 h at 30 V.

Comparison of growth properties of Finnish HSV-1 strains in vitro

250

A random set of ten circulating Finnish HSV-1 isolates were selected from residual laboratory

251

diagnostic specimens (Table 1). We first examined in vitro phenotypic characteristics of these

252

HSV-1 isolates, by comparing their overall titer and rate of intracellular virus vs. extracellular

253

(released) virus production at 24 hours post infection (hpi) of a range of cell types (Figure 1).

254

These included non-human primate kidney-derived epithelial (Vero) cells (Figure 1A), human

255

keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells (Figure 1B), and human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells in a mixed,

256

undifferentiated state (Figure 1C), as well as a differentiated, neuronal state (Figure 1D).

257

Compared to epithelial and keratinocyte cells, overall viral production was markedly reduced in

258

neuronal precursor cells and differentiated neuronal cells (compare Figure 1AB vs. CD). The

259

wild-type HSV-1 reference strain 17+ replicated to significantly higher titers than any of the

260

circulating clinical isolates in Vero cells, which are standardly used for HSV propagation, and to

261

a lesser extent strain 17+ replicated at higher titer in keratinocytes as well (Figure 1; p<0.05, 10-

262

100 fold higher viral amounts). Different clinical isolates excelled at producing virions in each

263

cell type, with no clear patterns of most- or least-efficient viral production or release across all

264

cell types. The amount of extracellular released virus was less than 10% of the total virion

265

production, in all cell types except the undifferentiated neuronal precursor cells (Figure 1,

266

insets). Each virus strain was also tested for acyclovir (ACV) resistance. Despite some variation

267

in ACV susceptibility (IC50 values), none of the circulating Finnish viruses was considered

268

resistant to ACV (Table 1). There were also no significant differences among the 10 clinical

271

Genetic and genomic analysis of Finnish HSV-1 strains

272

Based on prior data suggesting the effects of successive waves of migration on the human

273

population in Finland (45, 46), we next assessed the overall genetic diversity of these ten HSV-1

274

isolates. We first performed a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis on viral

275

genomic DNA, which revealed at least two broad patterns of variation (Figure 2). The diversity

276

of bands led us to examine these genetic differences with greater precision using high-

277

throughput, deep genome sequencing (HTS) and comparative genomics analysis (see Methods

278

for details). A previously described bioinformatics pipeline was used to de novo assemble a full-

279

length consensus genome for each strain (Table 2). A viral consensus genome represents the

280

most common nucleotide detected at each nucleotide position in that viral population. All viral

281

genomes had an average coverage depth between 1,000-2,800-fold, with >96% of the genome

282

covered at a depth exceeding 100-fold (Table 2). As observed in prior publications, the few

283

areas with <100X coverage correlated with regions of high G+C-content, and/or highly repetitive

284

sequences (47, 9, 10). The >1,000X average coverage depth enabled us to compare the full

285

genetic complement of the viral genome for each strain, to analyze differences both between and

286

within each viral strain population, and to compare them to previously described viral genomes.

287

Genetic relatedness of Finland HSV-1 samples

288

First, we used the viral consensus genomes to compare how overall variation in these ten Finnish

289

HSV-1 genomes related to the patterns observed by RFLP analysis (Figure 2). Whole genome

alignments were created using the ten Finnish HSV-1 genomes, as well as these ten in

291

conjunction with a diverse set of previously published HSV-1 genomes (see Methods and

292

Supplemental Table S1 for a full list). We then used SplitsTree to create a phylogenetic

293

network that revealed the relatedness of the ten Finnish viral genomes to each other (Figure 3A)

294

and to previously described HSV-1 genomes (Figure 3B). This approach revealed that the

295

Finland HSV-1 genomes separated into two sub-groups, which appear to relate to previously

296

recognized Asian and European / North American clades. These data echo those of the initial

297

RFLP analysis.

298

Protein-coding variation in Finland HSV-1 samples

299

Next, we examined more fine-scale genetic differences in these HSV-1 isolates, which are

300

invisible at the level of RFLP analysis. Here we examined DNA- and amino acid (AA)-

301

alignments for each protein-coding region of the HSV-1 genome (Supplemental Table S2-S3).

302

We found that from zero to 8% of each coding region differed at the AA level between the ten

303

Finnish viral genomes (Figure 4). Only a handful of small coding regions (UL20, VP26 (UL35),

304

UL49A, UL55) showed no AA variation at all between viral isolates. Consistent with previous

305

findings (9), gL (UL1), UL11, UL43, gG (US4), and gJ (US5) were among the most divergent

306

proteins. Together these inter-strain genetic differences in 70 HSV-1 proteins in Figure 4

307

provide ample opportunities to generate the phenotypic diversity observed in Figure 1. Overall,

308

these levels of AA coding diversity reflect those seen in previous analyses (9), and between other

309

known HSV-1 genomes.

Minority allelic variants in Finland HSV-1 viral populations

311

Each viral consensus genome represents the most common nucleotide detected at each position

312

in the viral genome. In contrast, minority variants (MV) within each viral population are rare

313

alleles, presented in <50% of the sequenced reads. These MV may rise to greater prevalence

314

during viral spread to new niches or hosts, or under selective evolutionary pressure. For each

315

viral genome, we examined the number of MVs detected in each genome. Stringent quality-

316

control criteria were used to reduce the number of false-positive MVs (see Methods), and only

317

those MV detected at >2% prevalence were used in this analysis. MVs were found dispersed

318

across each genome (Figure 5A), mostly in intergenic regions, and were mostly of low

319

frequency (Figure 5B). A concentration of MVs was found in the internal-repeat region, which

320

may result from stochasticity in tandem repeat alignment in this area, and/or from the reduced

321

selective pressures on intergenic sequences found in this region. The MVs detected in US7 (gI)

322

occur at the same tandem-repeat site as the consensus-level AA variations in this gene (Figure

323

6). Taken together, these results define the level of inter-host (Figure 4) and intra-host (Figure

324

5) variation seen in the Finnish HSV-1 strains described herein.

325

Patterns of variation in Finnish HSV-1 strains

326

Finally, we considered whether any of the observed patterns of genomic or phenotypic variation

327

could be linked to fine-scale coding variations in these ten Finnish HSV-1 isolates. The genomic

328

sub-groups detected by RFLP (Figure 2) and phylogenetic network analysis (Figure 3) were

329

reflected in several coding variations that correlated with phylogenetic group. For example,

330

coding differences in the secreted and virion surface glycoprotein G (gG; US4) correlated with

331

the two Finnish phylogenetic sub-groups (Figure 6A; see Figure 3 for phylogenetic sub-groups).

332

Other impacts on coding variation may result from changes in copy number at tandem repeats.

333

Variation in tandem repeat length in glycoprotein I (gI; US7) leads to changes in the length of a

334

repeating tract of mucin-type O-linked glycosylation sites (Figure 6B), akin to that previously

335

described in clinical isolates of HSV-1 (16, 48). Finally, there are detectable patterns of AA

336

variation that correlate with phenotypic differences in viral fitness in specific cell types. Coding

337

differences in the nuclear egress complex protein NEC2 (UL34) (Figure 6C) were observed in

338

the two strains (F-12g, M-15) which showed no detectable extracellular virion release in

339

differentiated neuronal cells (Figure 1D). The terminally differentiated and non-dividing state of

340

these neuronal cells may constitute a sensitized background to detect impacts on virion egress.

341

Taken together, these examples illustrate the type and degree of variation present in these strains,

342

and highlight potential genetic insights into viral phenotype.

343
344

Discussion

345

In this study, we described the first-ever HSV-1 genomes from Finland. Two distinct sub-groups

346

or clades were observed in the ten Finnish clinical isolates, with four strains clustering in one

347

clade and six in another. These groups were detectable using both classical RFLP approaches

348

(Figure 2) and deep-sequencing methods for whole-genome analyses (Figure 3). These data

349

appear to corroborate with previous findings on colonization of Finland, with migration from

350

Europe in the south/southwest and from Asia in the northeast (26–28). However, we found that

351

phenotypic differences between these isolates were uncoupled from the overall genomic patterns

352

that grouped them into two geographic clades. While plaque morphology was consistent across

353

isolates (data not shown), the amount of virus production, extracellular virion release, and

354

acyclovir sensitivity differed between isolates and across cell types (Figure 1 and Table 1). We

355

detected gene-specific patterns of genetic variation that may impact protein function. Future

356

studies will need to dissect individual genetic variations in each viral isolate in order to test their

357

precise impact(s) on viral fitness.

358

When analyzing the replication capabilities of these recently isolated clinical samples in multiple

359

cell types, we found that they replicated to lower overall titers and produced fewer extracellular

360

virions than the lab-adapted HSV-1 strain 17+, regardless of cell type (Figure 1). This difference

361

was more pronounced in non-human primate epithelial and human keratinocyte cells, and was

362

more subtle in neuronal precursors and differentiated neuronal cells. There did not appear to be

363

any clear differences in titer or extracellular virus production between geographic clades. There

364

also seemed to be no noticeable differences in plaque morphology among these samples, with

365

plaque size and cellular cytopathic effect being similar across all samples (data not shown).

366

Although we report findings in a number of cell lines in this study, it will be important for future

367

studies to examine each virus and cell-type pairing separately, since these data demonstrate that

368

maximal viral fitness in one cell type is not generally predictive of fitness in another.

369

We observed several potential connections between genetic differences and phenotypic

370

differences. For instance, we detected an AA difference in the UL34 (NEC2) binding domain in

371

F-12g and M-15 (Figure 6C). Previous work has shown that the viral proteins UL31 (NEC1) and

372

UL34 (NEC2) form a nuclear egress complex that localizes to the perinuclear space and plays a

373

critical role in egress of viral capsids from the nucleus (49, 50). In these two clinical isolates (F-

374

12g and M-15), there was no measurable amount of extracellular virus produced in differentiated

375

neuronal cells (Figure 1D). Further studies will be needed to examine if this phenotype is linked

376

to a disruption of NEC1 and NEC2 binding and impaired nuclear egress for isolates F-12g and

377

M-15. Variation in the copy-number of tandem repeats is yet another way that HSV-1 isolates

378

can generate genetic and potential phenotypic variation (9, 16, 51–53). Glycoprotein I (gI; US7)

379

contains a mucin-like domain with repeating units of serine, threonine, and proline (Figure 6B).

380

This domain varies in length across these isolates. This domain has been previously shown to

381

serve as a site of O-linked glycosylation, with longer tracts (e.g. 8 repeating blocks of 7 AA

382

each) being more heavily glycosylated than short tracts (e.g. 2 repeating blocks) (16, 48). A prior

383

study of over 80 Swedish HSV-1 isolates found roughly equal distributions of isolates with two,

384

three, or four repeating blocks in this mucin-like gI domain (16, 48). Half of the Finland HSV-1

385

isolates analyzed here have at least four repeating units, suggesting the potential for gI to be

386

more heavily glycosylated in these isolates. These data generate hypotheses for future

387

investigations of genotype-phenotype links in these and other new clinical isolates.

388

This study provides one of the first combinations of phenotypic analyses that span multiple cell

389

types, alongside full comparative genomic analyses that span both phylogenetic and gene-

390

specific analyses. One comparison not yet explored in this or prior studies is the specific pairing

391

of each virus with cells derived from the human source of each isolate. This approach is now

392

technically feasible, using induced pluripotent stem cell technology to generate specific cell

393

types from a single source such as a buccal swab. The rich genealogical databases in Finland

394

suggest an opportunity to not only pair these analyses at the human-cell and virus level, but also

395

to link observed phenotypes of cellular infection to each patient’s clinical, genetic, and/or

396

familial history of herpesvirus disease. Future studies may also seek to link human interaction

data, for instance contact networks and/or travel history, to infer how human movement and

398

the future, this approach would yield fruitful insights not only into direct clinical outcomes of

400

herpesvirus disease, but also generate hypotheses about herpesvirus co-morbidities.

Figure 6. Variations in individual genes provide a better insight into Finnish HSV-1

741

strain sub-groups and of specific cellular phenotypes.

742

Examples are shown here of variation in individual HSV-1 genes that reflect either the Finnish

743

HSV-1 strain sub-groups, or that correlate with and potentially influence specific cellular

744

phenotypes. Diagrams depict three examples of HSV-1 proteins with known functional domains

745

and post-translational modifications (e.g. phosphorylation, glycosylation; see Legend). A subset

746

of each protein is highlighted via an AA alignment of the ten clinical HSV-1 isolates. (A) Coding

747

differences in the secreted and virion surface glycoprotein G (gG; US4) correlate with the overall

748

genomic sub-groups (clades) shown in Figure 3. (B) Variation in copy number of a seven AA

749

tandem repeat block in glycoprotein I (gI; US7) changes the length of a repeating tract of mucin-

750

type O-linked glycosylation sites, as described previously in clinical isolates of HSV-1 (16, 48).

751

(C) AA differences in the nuclear egress protein NEC2 (UL34) were observed in the two strains

(M-15, F-12g) which showed no detectable extracellular virion release in differentiated neuronal

cells (Figure 1D). See Discussion for additional insights on the potential phenotypic impacts of

754

the variations shown in B-C.
