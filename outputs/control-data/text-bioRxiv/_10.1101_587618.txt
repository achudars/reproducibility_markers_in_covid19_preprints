Abstract
A quantitative understanding of organism-level behavior requires predictive models that can capture the richness of behavioral phenotypes, yet
are simple enough to connect with underlying mechanistic processes. Here
we investigate the motile behavior of nematodes at the level of their translational motion on surfaces driven by undulatory propulsion. We broadly
sample the nematode behavioral repertoire by measuring motile trajectories of the canonical lab strain C. elegans N2 as well as wild strains and
distant species. We focus on trajectory dynamics over timescales spanning the transition from ballistic (straight) to diffusive (random) movement and find that salient features of the motility statistics are captured
by a random walk model with independent dynamics in the speed, bearing and reversal events. We show that the model parameters vary among
species in a correlated, low-dimensional manner suggestive of a common
mode of behavioral control and a trade-off between exploration and exploitation. The distribution of phenotypes along this primary mode of
variation reveals that not only the mean but also the variance varies considerably across strains, suggesting that these nematode lineages employ
contrasting “bet-hedging” strategies for foraging.

Introduction
A ubiquitous feature of biological motility is the combination of stereotyped
movements in seemingly random sequences. Capturing the essential characteristics of motion thus requires a statistical description, in close analogy to the
random-walk formulation of Brownian motion in physics. A canonical example is the “run-and-tumble” behavior of E. coli bacteria, in which relatively
straight paths (runs) are interspersed by rapid and random reorientation events
(tumbles) [1]. The random walk of E. coli can thus be characterized by two
random variables (run length and tumble angle) and two constant parameters
(swimming speed and rotational diffusion coefficient), and detailed studies over
decades have yielded mechanistic models that link these key behavioral parameters to the underlying anatomy and physiology [2–5]. Random-walk theory
has been fruitfully applied also to studies of eukaryotic cell migration in both
two [6–8] and three [9] dimensions.
Can a similar top-down approach be fruitfully applied to more complex
organisms–for example, an animal controlled by a neural network? Animal behavior is both astonishing in its diversity and daunting in its complexity, given
the inherently high-dimensional space of possible anatomical, physiological, and
environmental configurations. It is therefore essential to identify appropriate
models and parameterizations to succinctly represent the complex space of behaviors — a non-trivial task that has traditionally relied on the insights of
expert biologists. In this study, we ask if one can achieve a similar synthesis
by an alternative, physically-motivated approach [10]. We seek a quantitative
model with predictive power over behavioral statistics, and yet a parameterization that is simple enough to permit meaningful interpretations of phenotypes
in a reduced space of variables. As an example, we focus on the motile behavior
of nematodes, which explore space using a combination of random and directed
motility driven by undulatory propulsion.
The nematode C. elegans has long been a model organism for the genetics
of neural systems [11, 12], and recent advances in imaging have made it feasible
to record a large fraction of the worm’s nervous system activity at single-cell
resolution [13–15]. These developments raise the compelling possibility of elucidating the neural basis of behavioral control at the organism scale, but such
endeavors will require unambiguous definitions of neural circuit outputs and
functional performance. The worm’s behavioral repertoire [16, 17] is commonly
characterized in terms of forward motion occasionally interrupted by brief reversals [18–20], during which the undulatory body wave that drives its movement [21] switches direction. In addition, worms reorient with a combination of
gradual curves in the trajectory (“weathervaning”) [22,23] and sharp changes in
body orientation (omega-turns [19] and delta-turns [24]). These elementary behaviors are combined in exploring an environment [22, 25]. Environmental cues

such as chemical, mechanical, or thermal stimuli [26] lead to a biasing of these
behaviors, guiding the worm in favorable directions [22,25,27]. Finally, in practical terms, the worm’s small size (∼1 mm in length), moderate propulsive speed
(∼100 µm s−1 ) and short generation time (∼2 days) allow a considerable fraction
of its behavioral repertoire to be efficiently sampled in the laboratory [18, 28].
An influential example of such an analysis is the “pirouette” model proposed
by Pierce-Shimomura and Lockery [25] which describes the worm’s exploratory
behavior as long runs interrupted occasionally by bursts of reversals and omega
turns that reorient the worm, in close analogy to the run-and-tumble model of
bacterial random walks [1]. Later work by Iino et al. identified that worms also
navigate by smoother modulations of their direction during long runs (“weathervaning”) [22], and Calhoun et al. have suggested that C. elegans may track
the information content of environmental statistics in searching for food [29], a
motile strategy that has been termed ’infotaxis’ [30]. A recent study by Roberts
et al. [20] analyzed high (submicron) resolution kinematics of C. elegans locomotion and developed a stochastic model of forward-reverse switching dynamics
that include the short-lived (∼0.1 s) pause states that were identified between
forward and reverse runs.
Importantly, while these previous studies have illuminated different modes
of behavioral control, they were not designed to obtain a predictive model of the
trajectory statistics and thus a succinct parameterization of C. elegans motility
remains an important open problem. A quantitative parameterization capturing
the repertoire of C. elegans’ behavioral phenotypes would facilitate data-driven
investigations of behavioral strategies: for example, whether worms demonstrate
distinct modes of motility (characterized by correlated changes in parameters)
over time, or in response to changes in environmental conditions [28, 31–33].
Variation in the obtained parameters among individuals can inform on the distribution of behavioral phenotypes within a population, and reveal evolutionary
constraints and trade-offs between strategies represented by distinct parameter
sets [34].
C. elegans is a member of the Nematoda phylum, one of the largest and most
diverse phylogenetic groups of species [35, 36]. Despite the diversity of ecological niches these animals inhabit [35], comparisons of nematode body plans have
revealed a remarkable degree of conservation, even down to the level of individual neurons [37]. This combination of highly conserved anatomy and ecological
diversity makes nematode motility a compelling case for studies of behavioral
phenotypes. Anatomical conservation suggests it might be possible to describe
the behavior of diverse nematodes by a common model, and identifying the
manner in which existing natural variation is distributed across the parameter space of the model could reveal distinct motility strategies resulting from
optimization under different environmental conditions.
In this study, we develop a simple random walk model describing the translational movements of a diverse collection of nematode species, freely-moving
on a two-dimensional agar surface. In addition to providing a quantitative and
predictive measure of trajectory dynamics, the parameters of our model define
a space of possible behaviors. Variation within such a space can occur due to

changes in individual behavior over time (reflecting temporal variation in the
underlying sensorimotor physiology, or “mood”), differences in behavior among
individuals (reflecting stable differences in physiology, or “personality”) and
differences between strains and species (reflecting cumulative effects of natural
selection). By quantitative analyses of such patterns of variation, we seek to
identify simple, organizing principles underlying behavior.

Results
Nematodes Perform Random Walks Off-Food with a Broad
Range of Diffusivities Across Strains
In order to identify conserved and divergent aspects of motility strategies, we
sampled motile behavior over a broad evolutionary range. We selected a phylogenetically diverse collection of nematodes with an increased sampling density
closer to the laboratory strain C. elegans (Figure 1A and Supplementary Information, SI). To sample individual variation, we recorded the motility of up
to 20 well-fed individuals per strain and each individual for 30 minutes on a
food-free agar plate at 11.5 Hz with a resolution of 12.5 µm/px (see SI).
We measured the centroid position (~x(t)) and calculated the centroid velocity (~v (t)), using image analysis techniques (Figure S11 and SI). We chose the
centroid as the measure of the worm’s position because it effectively filters out
most of the dynamics of the propulsive body wave. There was considerable
variation in the spatial extent and degree of turning visible in the trajectories
both within and across strains (Figure 1A, S2).
As previously seen in C. elegans [1], the measured mean-squared displacement,
h[∆x(τ )]2 i ≡ h|~x(t + τ ) − ~x(t)|2 i,
(1)
revealed a transition from ballistic to diffusive motion within a 100 s timescale
(Figure 1B, S3). Over short times, the worm’s path was relatively straight, with
the mean-squared displacement scaling quadratically with the time lag τ and
speed s as hs2 iτ 2 (i.e. a log-log slope of 2). Over longer times, the slope decreased with τ reflecting the randomization of orientation characteristic of diffu2
sion, and an effective diffusivity Deff was extracted by fits to h[∆x(τ )] i = 4Deff τ
(see SI). For times & 100 s, the slope of the mean-squared displacement decreased yet further due to encounters of the worm with walls of the observation
arena. We confirmed that this confinement did not affect detection of the ballistic to diffusive transition (Figure S1). This analysis revealed that the visible
differences in the spatial extent of these 30-minute trajectories stem from variation by nearly an order of magnitude in speed and two orders of magnitude in
diffusivity (Figure 1C, Tables S1 & S2).

The Random Walk of Nematodes Can Be Decomposed into
Speed, Turning and Reversal Dynamics
The broad range of observed speeds and diffusivities suggest that these diverse
nematodes have evolved a variety of strategies for spatial exploration. To gain
further insights into the manner in which such contrasting behaviors are implemented by each strain, we sought to extract a minimal model of the nematodes’
random walk by further decomposing the trajectory statistics of all nine measured strains. In this and the following three sections, we illustrate our analysis and model development with data from three contrasting strains: CB4856
and PS312, which demonstrated two of the most extreme phenotypes, and the
canonical laboratory strain N2 (see SI for equivalent data for all strains).
The translational motion of the worm can be described by the time-varying
centroid velocity ~v (t) which can in turn be decomposed into speed s(t) and
direction of motion (hereafter referred to as its “bearing”) φ(t):
d~x(t)
= s(t) [cos φ(t), sin φ(t)]
(2)
dt
To account for head-tail asymmetry in the worm’s anatomy, we additionally
define the body orientation (ψ(t); hereafter referred to simply as “orientation”)
by the angle of the vector connecting the worm’s centroid to the head (Figure
2A). The centroid bearing is related to this orientation of the worm by
~v (t) =

φ(t) = ψ(t) + ∆ψ(t)

(3)

where the difference ∆ψ(t) is a measure of the alignment of the direction of
movement with the worm’s body orientation (hereafter referred to simply as
“alignment”). We found for all strains that the distribution of ∆ψ(t) was bimodal with peaks at 0◦ and 180◦ (Figure 2C, S7A). These match the forward and
reverse states of motion described in C. elegans [18, 19].
Each of the three components of the worm’s motility (speed, orientation,
and alignment) varied considerably over time and in qualitatively different ways
between strains (Figure 2B). For example, the three strains shown in Figure 2B
differed not only in their average speed, but also in the amplitude and timescale
of fluctuations about the average speed. Similarly, the statistics of orientation
fluctuations about the drifting mean also differed visibly between strains. Finally, transitions between forward and reverse runs were far more frequent in
PS312 as compared to N2 and CB4856. Given the apparently random manner
in which these motility components varied over time, we proceeded to analyze
the dynamics of each of these three components as a stochastic process.

Speed Dynamics
Speed control has not been extensively studied in C. elegans, but it is known that
worms move with a characteristic speed that is influenced by stimuli [26]. When
intervals corresponding to transitions between forward and reverse runs were

excluded from the time series, we found that the autocorrelation in speed fluctuations decayed exponentially over a few seconds (Figure 3A, S5A), a timescale
similar to the period of the propulsive body wave. These dynamics are naturally captured by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process [39], which describes random
fluctuations arising from white
noise (increments of a diffusive Wiener process,
√
dWt [39]) with magnitude 2Ds that relax with timescale τs back to an average
value, µs = hsi:
p
ds(t) = τs−1 [µs − s(t)] dt + 2Ds dWt
(4)
Numerical integration of this equation closely reproduced the observed speed
distributions during runs (Figure S5B).

Diffusive Turning with Drift
The orientation ψ(t) captures turning dynamics that are independent of abrupt
changes in bearing φ(t) due to reversals. To change orientation, C. elegans
executes a combination of large, ventrally-biased [40] sharp turns [18, 24] and
gradual “weathervaning” [22], both of which contribute to randomization of orientation over time. This random walk in orientation was not purely diffusive:
the orientation correlation Cψ (τ ) = hcos [ψ(t + τ ) − ψ(t)]i does not decay exponentially (Figures 3B Inset, S6B), and the mean-squared angular displacement,
MSAD(τ ) = h[ψ(t + τ ) − ψ(t)]2 i, increases nonlinearly with time (Figures 3B,
S6A).
We found that this nonlinear MSAD of ψ(t) could be well fit by a quadratic
function of the time delay τ : MSAD(τ ) = kψ2 rms τ 2 + 2Dψ τ , corresponding to a
diffusion-and-drift model with root-mean-square (rms) drift magnitude kψrms
and angular diffusion coefficient Dψ (see Supporting Information for derivation).
A non-zero drift magnitude kψrms 6= 0 indicates that in addition to purely random (diffusive) changes in orientation, there is an underlying bias (i.e. directional persistence) in the worms’ turning over 100 s windows, consistent with
previous studies in larger arenas [23].
These observations lead to a simple model for the orientation dynamics that
combines drift (approximated as a deterministic linear process over a 100 s window) with stochastic diffusion:
p
dψ(t) = kψ dt + 2Dψ dWt ,
(5)
where we set the drift magnitude kψ = kψrms and dWt represents increments
of a Wiener process [39].
We note that while this model described well the orientation dynamics within
100 s windows, over longer timescales additional dynamics may be relevant. The
magnitude of kψ in our data (∼1 ◦ s−1 ) was similar to that of weathervaning
excursions reported for C. elegans navigating in salt gradients [22].

Forward and Reverse Runs
The observation that motion during runs switched abruptly between forward
and reverse states (with ∆ψ ≈ {0◦ , 180◦ }, respectively; Figures 2B,C,S7A)

suggested that reversals could be described as a discrete stochastic process.
The manner in which reversals contribute to randomization of bearing over a
time lag τ is captured by the autocorrelation function of ∆ψ(t), C∆ψ (τ ) ≡
hcos(∆ψ(t + τ ) − ∆ψ(t))i. We found that C∆ψ (τ ) decayed nearly exponentially
to a non-zero baseline (Figure 3C, Figure S7C). This is the predicted behavior for the autocorrelation function of the simplest of two-state processes (a
“random telegraph process”):
P (Tfwd > t) = exp(−t/τfwd )

(6)

P (Trev > t) = exp(−t/τrev ),

(7)

in which the distribution of forward and reverse run intervals (Tfwd and Trev ) are
completely determined by a single time constant (τfwd and τrev , respectively).
The random telegraph process yields an autocorrelation function that decays exponentially as C∆ψ (τ ) = C∆ψ (∞) + (1 − C∆ψ (∞)) e−τ /τRT to a minimum value

−1
−1 −1
C∆ψ (∞) ≡ ((τfwd − τrev )/(τrev + τfwd ))2 with a timescale τRT ≡ τfwd
+ τrev
[41]. Results obtained from fitting the autocorrelation function are consistent
with those obtained from the distribution of time intervals between detected
switching events (figure S7, SI). In principle, the forward and reverse states
could be characterized by differences in motility parameters of our model other
than these transition times, as forward and reverse motion are driven by distinct
command interneurons in C. elegans [42,43]. However, we found that run speeds
were nearly identical between forward and reverse runs (Figure S8). While we
expect that this symmetry will be broken under some specific conditions, such
as the escape response [44], the strong speed correlation between the two states
motivates the assumption, adopted in our model, that reversals change only the
bearing (by 180◦ ) and the propensity to reverse direction, represented in our
model by the time constants τfwd and τrev .

A Model with Independent Speed, Turning and Reversals
Captures the Ballistic-to-Diffusive Transition in Nematode
Motility
Given that the dynamics of the worm’s speed, turning and reversals could be described as simple stochastic processes, we asked whether combining them as independent components in a model of the worms’ random walk could sufficiently
describe the observed motility statistics (Figure 4A). We simulated trajectories
of worms by numerically integrating equations (4)-(7) for the speed, orientation,
and reversal dynamics, respectively, which yields the worm’s velocity dynamics
through equations (2) and (3), with ∆ψ(t) equal to 0◦ during forward runs and
180◦ during reverse runs. Simulations of this model using parameters fit to individual worms produced trajectories that qualitatively resembled real trajectories
and varied considerably in their spatial extent (Figure 4B).
Next, we quantitatively assessed the performance of the model in reproducing the statistics of the observed trajectories over the time scale of 100 s, within

which all strains completed the transition from ballistic to diffusive motion (Figure 4C). We found that the model based on independent speed, turning and
reversal dynamics closely reproduced not only the diffusivity of each strain but
also the time evolution of the mean-squared displacement (h[∆x(τ )]2 i) across
the ballistic-to-diffusive transition (Figure 4C, top). A closer inspection of the
dynamics across this transition is possible by examining the velocity autocorrelation function (C~v (τ )), the time integral of which determines
R τ the slope of the
mean-squared displacement through (d/dt)h[∆x(τ )]2 i = 2 0 dτ 0 C~v (τ 0 ), a variant of the Green-Kubo relation [45,46]. The transition from ballistic to diffusive
motion is characterized by the manner in which the normalized velocity autocorrelation C~v (τ )/C~v (0) decays over the time lag τ from unity (at τ = 0) to zero
(as τ → ∞). We found that C~v (τ ) varied considerably across strains, not only
in the overall ballistic-to-diffusive transition time, but also in the more detailed
dynamics of the autocorrelation decay over time (Figure 4C, middle). Salient
features, such as the transition time, of the measured velocity autocorrelation
functions C~v,obs were reproduced closely by the simulated velocity autocorrelation functions C~v,model , but there were also subtle deviations in the detailed
dynamics for a number of strains.
Given our model’s simplifying assumption that dynamics for s(t), ψ(t), and
∆ψ(t) are independent stochastic processes, we asked whether the remaining
discrepancies between the simulated and measured velocity autocorrelation dynamics could be explained by violations of this assumption of independence. As
a model-free assessment of the degree of non-independence, we first calculated
the predicted velocity autocorrelation for the case that the dynamics of all three
components are independent, C~v,indep (τ ) = Cs (τ )Cψ (τ )C∆ψ (τ ), where Cs (τ ),
Cψ (τ ), and C∆ψ (τ ) are the autocorrelation functions of the measured data for
each of the components (see Supporting Information for derivation). We then
compared the differences C~v,obs −C~v,indep (blue curve in Figure 4C, bottom) and
C~v,obs − C~v,model (red curve in Figure 4C, bottom). Indeed, there were subtle
differences both on shorter (∼1 s) and longer timescales (∼10 s). However, these
errors for the simulated model were very similar to, or less than, those for the
model-free prediction from the data under the assumption of independence (i.e.,
C~v,obs − C~v,model . C~v,obs − C~v,indep ). These results demonstrate that modeling
s(t), ψ(t), and ∆ψ(t) as independent stochastic processes provides a very good
approximation to trajectory statistics across the ballistic-to-diffusive transition.
The relatively subtle differences between the data and model arise primarily
in instances where this assumption of independence between the three motility components breaks down. Consistent with these conclusions, inspection of
cross-correlation functions computed from the data revealed that correlations
between s(t), ψ(t), and ∆ψ(t) are largely absent, with only weak correlations
between speed (s) and reversals (∆ψ) in a subset of strains (Fig. S9).

Variation of exploratory behavior across Species
The results presented in the previous sections demonstrate that a random-walk
model with seven parameters describing independent speed, turning and reversal

dynamics, provides a good approximation of the worms’ motile behavior over the
∼100 s timescale spanning the ballistic-to-diffusive transition. The model parameters thus define a seven-dimensional space of motility phenotypes in which
behavioral variation across strains and species can be examined. If components
of behavior were physiologically regulated or evolutionarily selected for in a coordinated manner, we would expect to find correlated patterns in the variation
of these traits.
We fit our model to the trajectory statistics of each individual worm and
built a phenotype matrix of 106 worms x 7 behavioral parameters (summarized
in Tables S2-S4). The correlation matrix for these 7 parameters demonstrates
that the strongest correlation were the forward and reverse state lifetimes (τf wd ,
τrev ), followed by those describing speed and forward state life times (µs , τf wd ).
More broadly, there were extensive correlations among the model parameters,
not only within the parameters of each motility component (speed, orientation,
reversals) but also between those of different components.
We looked for dominant patterns in the correlations using principal component analysis [47] (Figure 5B), uncovering a single dominant mode of correlated
variation (Figure 5B, left). This principal mode (mode 1), capturing nearly 40%
of the total variation, described significant correlations among all the parameters except for Ds and Dψ (Figure 5B, right, Table S5). We did not attempt
to interpret higher modes since, individually, they either did not significantly
exceeded the captured variance under a randomization test (mode 3 and higher;
see SI, and Figure 5B, left) or were found upon closer inspection to be dominated
by parameter correlations arising from fitting uncertainties (mode 2).
We used numerical simulations to determine the effects on motile behavior of
varying parameters along the principal mode. The measured trajectory phenotypes projected onto this mode in the range {−4, 2} centered about the average
phenotype located at the origin, and we performed simulations for parameter
sets evenly sampled along this range. These largely reproduced the observed
variation in the measured diffusivities Deff as a function of the projection along
the first mode. The agreement was particularly good at higher values (> −1) of
the mode projection, but at lower values we noted a tendency for the Deff from
simulations to exceed that of the data. The latter discrepancy can be explained
by elements of behavior not captured by our model (see Discussion). Nevertheless, as illustrated by simulated trajectories (Figure 5C, bottom), trajectories
became more expansive as the mode projection increased, as did Deff by nearly
two orders of magnitude over the tested range. This suggested that the principal mode indicates exploratory propensity (Figure 5C), and we confirmed that
it is indeed more strongly associated with changes in Deff than expected for
randomly generated parameter sets (Figure S10). Interestingly, this mode of
variation we found across individual phenotypes is reminiscent of “roaming”
and “dwelling” behavioral variability that has been shown within individuals
across time, in C. elegans [28, 32] as well as other organisms [48, 49].

Specialized and Diversified Behavioral Strategies Across
Strains
The principal behavioral mode discussed in the preceding section was identified
by analyzing variation across all individual worms measured in this study, coming from diverse strains and species that differ in their average behavior (see
Tables S2 - S4). How does the variability among individuals of a given strain
compare to differences between the average phenotypes of strains/species? On
the one hand, each strain might be highly “specialized”, with relatively small
variation within strains as compared to that across strains. On the other hand,
strains might implement “diversified” strategies in which genetically identical
worms vary strongly in their behavior. To address these two possibilities, we
analyzed the distribution of individual phenotypes within each strain, as well
as that of the set of averaged species phenotypes.
For each measured individual, we computed the projection of its motility
parameter set along the principal behavioral mode and estimated strain-specific
distributions of this reduced phenotype (Figure 6, Table S6). In principle, any
detail in the shape of these distributions could be relevant for evolutionary
fitness, but here we focused our analysis on the mean and standard deviation,
given the moderate sampling density (≤ 20 individuals per strain). Further,
we computed the principal-mode projection of the average phenotype of each
species to define an interspecies phenotype distribution (Figure 6).
Strains varied considerably in both the position and breadth of their phenotypic distributions along the principal behavioral mode. Remarkably, variation
across individuals within each strain was comparable in magnitude to that for
the set of average phenotypes across species (Figure 6). Some strains were
specialized towards roaming or dwelling behavior, such as CB4856 and PS312,
respectively, with a strong bias in their behavior and comparatively low individual variability. Others, such as QX1211 and PS1159, appeared more diversified
with an intermediate average phenotype and higher individual variability. These
considerable differences in phenotype distributions across strains reveal the evolutionary flexibility of population-level heterogeneity in nematodes, and suggest
a possible bet-hedging mechanism for achieving optimal fitness in variable environments [50, 51].
In assessing such variability of phenotypes, it is essential to ask how uncertainty in the determined parameters (obtained from model fits) contribute to
the observed variability in phenotypes. We therefore computed the contribution of uncertainties in the individual phenotype determination by bootstrap
resampling of the 100 s windows of each individual’s recorded trajectory (see
SI). The uncertainties thus computed reflect contributions from both parameter
uncertainties in curve fitting of data, as well as temporal variability in an individual’s parameters over timescales longer than the window size (100 s). With
the exception of two strains (sjh2 and CB4856), this measure of uncertainty accounted for less than half of the individual variation within each strain (Figure
6B). These findings support the view that the phenotypic variation estimated in
the current analysis largely represented stable differences in individual behavior.

Discussion
We have presented a comparative quantitative analysis of motile behavior across
a broad range of strains and species of the nematode phylum, ranging from the
lab strain C. elegans N2 to Plectus sjh2 at the base of the chromadorean nematode lineage. Despite the vast evolutionary distances spanned by strains in
this collection [52], we found that a behavioral model described by only seven
parameters could account for much of the diversity of the worms’ translational
movement across the ∼100 s timescale spanning the ballistic-to-diffusive transition. This simple model provides a basis for future studies aiming to capture
more detailed aspects of nematode behavior, or to connect sensory modulation
of behavior to the underlying physiology. More generally, our results demonstrate how quantitative comparisons of behavioral dynamics across species can
provide insights regarding the design of behavioral strategies.

The Minimal Model: What Does It Capture, and What
Does It Miss?
We focused on a high-level output of behavior — translational and orientational
trajectory dynamics — and sought to build the simplest possible quantitative
model that could capture the observed behavioral statistics. We found that a
model with only three independent components — (1) speed fluctuations that
relax to a set point on a timescale of a few seconds, (2) orientation fluctuations
with drift, and (3) stochastic switching between forward and reverse states of
motion — describes well, overall, the trajectory statistics of all tested nematode
species across the ballistic-to-diffusive transition (Figure 4).
Notably, we have not included explicit representations of some reorientation
mechanisms that have been studied in the past, such as the deep turns (omegaand delta-turns) [18,24], or the combination of such turns with reversals (pirouettes) [25]. In our data, we find that the timing of the initiation and termination
of reversals, which would both count as runs in the pirouette description, follow exponential distributions with similar time constants as previously reported
for the pirouette run distribution. While omega and delta turns must indeed
be mechanistically distinct from gradual turns, we have chosen here not to explicitly model their occurrence since orientation changes in our trajectory data
were adequately described by a continuous diffusion-drift process (Figures 3B,
S6A). It is possible, however, that explicit representations of pirouettes and/or
omega turns would be important in other experimental scenarios, e.g. those
that include navigation in the presence of gradient stimuli.
In our model, ”roaming” and ”dwelling” were not assigned discrete behavioral states (as was done e.g. in [28,31,32]), but instead emerged as a continuous
pattern of variation among motility parameters describing the worm’s random
walk. However, robust extraction of motility parameters required pre-filtering
of trajectory data that likely biased them towards more ”roaming” phenotypes
(see SI), which we believe account for the noted tendency of model simulations
to overestimate Deff that was more pronounced for trajectories at the ”dwelling”

end of the spectrum (Figure 5C).
In its current form, our simple model does not account for possible correlations between the dynamics of the three motility components (speed, orientation, and reversals). Indeed, at least weak correlations do exist between the
components (Figure S9). Comparisons of simulated versus measured trajectories demonstrated that the effects of such correlations on the motility statistics
are small but detectable (Figure 4C). The differences were most significant for
the velocity-autocorrelation dynamics on a ∼10 s timescale, and were similar to
those for model-free predictions obtained by combining component-wise correlation functions under the assumption of independence. Discrepancies on this intermediate timescale occurred most often in fast-moving strains that frequently
approached the repellent boundary. Therefore, we suspect that the discrepancy arises from a stereotyped sequence, such as the escape response [44], that
introduces temporal correlations between speed changes, turning, and reversals.
While here we have focused on the transition to diffusive motion, some recent
experiments suggest that C. elegans might engage in superdiffusive behavior on
timescales longer than 100 s [23, 33]. Superdiffusive behavior could arise from
nonstationarities in motile behavior, such as the roaming/dwelling transitions
on timescales of several minutes [32]. Another mechanism for superdiffusion is
directed motility [23] in response to external stimuli such as chemical or thermal
gradients. In such environments, nematodes are known to use at least two
distinct mechanisms for navigation [22,25] and the model here could be extended
by studying the dependence of motility parameters on environmental statistics.
Information about the body shape can be incorporated to build a more
complete behavioural model that also includes dynamics hidden by centroid
behaviour [1, 53]. Indeed, work by Brown et al. showed that a rich repertoire
of dynamics can be identified as temporal “motifs” in the postural time series
of C. elegans and used to classify mutants with high discriminatory power [54].
We have found that all of the species tested here can also be described with a
common set of postural modes (not shown), suggesting future directions on the
evolutionary space of postural dynamics.

The exploratory behavioral mode: Variability and its Physiological Basis
While we found that a single behavioral model could be used to characterize nematode motility across the chromadorean lineage, the parameters of the
model varied extensively from strain to strain. Quantitatively, about 37% of
the variation corresponded to a correlated change in the parameters underlying
the timing of forward and reverse runs and the dynamics controlling speed and
turning (Figure 5B). We find that this principal mode of variation is associated
with strong changes in exploratory propensity, as characterized by Deff (Figure
5C). This pattern of parameter variation drove a change from low speed short
runs to high speed long runs, resembling the canonical descriptions of roaming
and dwelling in C. elegans [32].

Roaming and dwelling are thought to represent fundamental foraging strategies reflecting the trade-off between global exploration and local exploitation of
environmental resources [55]. Recent work has suggested that such archetypal
strategies can be recovered by quantitatively analyzing the geometry of phenotypic distributions in parameter space [31, 34]. The motility phenotypes we
found in the present study were biased along one principal dimension, with
the extremes corresponding to roaming and dwelling behaviors. This observation compels us to suggest that an exploration-exploitation trade-off is the
primary driver of phenotypic diversification in the motility of chromadorean nematodes in the absence of stimuli. Interestingly, a recent study on the motility
of a very different class of organisms (ciliates) yielded a similar conclusion [49]:
across two species and different environments, the diversity of motility phenotypes was found to be distributed principally along an axis corresponding to
roaming and dwelling phenotypes. The emergence of roaming/dwelling as the
principal mode of variation in such disparate species underscores the idea that
the exploration-exploitation trade-off is a fundamental constraint on biological
motility strategies.
A surprising finding in our study was that, for a majority of strains, the extent of behavioral variability across individuals within a strain was comparable
to that for variation of phenotypes across species (Figure 6). In slowly changing
environments, the most evolutionarily successful species are those that consistently perform well in that environment. This can be achieved by evolving a specialized, high fitness phenotype that varies little among individuals (such as with
PS312 and sjh2). However, increased phenotypic variability among individuals
can improve fitness in more variable environments if some individuals perform
much better in each condition—a so-called “bet-hedging” strategy [50, 51]. The
large variability we observed among individual phenotypes within each strain
might reflect such a bet-hedging strategy in nematode exploratory behavior.
The observation that the variation among genetically identical individuals
can be comparable to that between disparate species raises the intriguing possibility that there exist conserved molecular and/or physiological pathways driving diversification of spatial exploration strategies. Analogous variation in exploratory behavior was also detected in an analysis of nonstationarity in the
behavior of wild-type and mutant C. elegans under various nutritional conditions [31]. Physiologically, protein kinase G (PKG) signaling and DAF-7 (TGFβ) signaling from the ASI neuron are thought to be major mechanisms controlling roaming and dwelling in C. elegans [28, 31]. PKG signaling is also involved
in controlling foraging in Drosophila and other insects as well as many aspects
of mammalian behavior [56, 57]. Flavell et al. also elucidated a neuromodulatory pathway involving serotonin and the neuropeptide pigment dispersing
factor (PDF) controlling the initiation and duration of roaming and dwelling
states [32].
Perturbations to the molecular parameters of such pathways underlying
global behavioral changes might provide a mechanism for the observed correlated variations at the individual, intra-, and inter-species levels. The identification of such conserved pathways affecting many phenotypic parameters is of

fundamental interest also from an evolutionary perspective, as they have been
proposed to bias the outcome of random mutations towards favorable evolutionary outcomes [58,59]. Our simple model provides a basis for future investigations
to uncover conserved mechanisms that generate behavioral variability, by defining a succinct parameterization of behavior that can be combined with genetic
and physiological methods.

Selection of Strains
A phylogenetic tree with the strains used in this study is shown in Figure 1A.
The nematode phylum is classically divided into three major
branches–chromadorea, enoplea, and dorylaimia–that are broken into a total
of five major B-clades [S2] and twelve minor H-clades [S3]. The chromadorean
lineage is the largest, spanning B-clades III-V and H-clades 3-12 [S2,S3]. C.
elegans is located in clade V9 (the rhabditids), one of the most diverse clades
[S4]. In addition to the lab strain N2, we selected three of the most genetically
distinct wild isolates of C. elegans (CB4856, JU775, and QX1211) to sample
intraspecies variation [S5]. From H-clade 9 in order of increasing evolutionary distance, we selected Caenorhabditis briggsae JU757, Rhabditis myriophila
DF5020, and Pristionchus pacificus PS312. The next closest major group, Bclade IV, contains H-clades 10-12. H-clade 12 contains the plant parasitic tylenchs and was thus not included in this study. H-clades 10 and 11 contain many
bacterial feeders, of which we selected Panagrolaimus sp. PS1159. Finally, from
the basal chromadorea, we obtained Plectus sp. sjh2, a member of H-clade 6.
C. elegans N2, CB4856 and JU775 were provided by the Caenorhabditis
Genetics Center, which is funded by NIH Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (P40 OD010440). C. elegans QX1211 was kindly provided by Erik Andersen (Northwestern Univ.). Plectus sp. sjh2 was isolated from a soil sample
using morphological criteria by Casper Quist and Hans Helder (Wageningen
Univ.). SJH then isolated a single species by starting cultures with a single
worm. The remaining strains were used in previous studies by Avery [S6].

Cultivation of Worms
Worms were grown on NGM-SR plates (3 g NaCl, 24 g agar, 2.5 g peptone,
1 mL 5 mg mL−1 cholesterol in EtOH in 975 mL water, with 1 mL 1 m CaCl2 ,
1 mL 1 m MgSO4 , 25 mL 1 m K2 PO4 pH 6, 1 mL 200 mg mL−1 streptomycin in
water, and 0.23 g 5 mL 40 mg mL−1 nystatin in DMSO, added after autoclaving)
seeded with E. coli HB101, as previously described [S7]. E. coli HB101 was first
cultured in M9 minimal media (3 g KH2 PO4 , 6 g Na2 HPO4 , 5 g NaCl, 1 mL
1 m MgSO4 in 1 L water) supplemented with 10% Luria broth and 10 mg mL−1
streptomycin [S8]. Plates were incubated with a light circle of HB101 culture
for a day at 37 ◦C and then stored at 4 ◦C. For Plectus sp. sjh2, low salt plates
(2% agar supplemented with 5 mg L−1 of cholesterol from a 5 mg mL−1 EtOH
solution) were used as previously described [S9]. On NGM-SR plates, these
worms became shriveled and died. As the plates did not have nutrients for the
bacteria to grow, HB101 was grown to high density in Luria broth overnight at
37 ◦C, washed 3X in water, resuspended at 10X concentration, and applied to
the plates.

Nematodes were cultured by either transferring a few worms by worm pick or
a chunk of agar to a new plate after the worms reached adulthood. The plates
were then incubated at 20 ◦C. The growth rate varied considerably among
strains, with Plectus sp. sjh2 taking nearly two weeks to reach adulthood. We
avoided starving the worms at any point during their cultivation, especially
in the period before behavioral experiments were performed, as this can induce
transgenerational phenotypic changes [S10,S11], and we have observed transient
effects on motility lasting at least a couple of generations (data not shown).

Imaging
The imaging experiments were done on 3.5 cm plates containing the same media used for cultivation. A 2×2 10 mm repellant grid was made by etching the
plate with a tool dipped in 1% sodium dodecyl sufate, a detergent that C. elegans and most other nematodes avoided. (Whereas many C. elegans studies
have used copper rings as a repellant boundary [S12], we found that it did not
sufficiently repel other nematodes; data not shown). Four young adult, wellfed nematodes were transferred individually by worm pick to a 10 µL drop of
M9 (water for Plectus sp. sjh2) to remove bacteria stuck to the worms. The
worms were then transferred by pipette in a minimal amount of buffer to the
imaging plate, and excess buffer was removed as much as possible. The plate
was imaged 10-20 minutes after picking the worms, minimizing most transient
behaviors. The plate was placed on a custom imaging rig in an inverted, uncovered configuration with illumination by a Schott MEBL-CR50 red LED plate.
The behavior was recorded for 30 minutes using a Point Grey Grasshopper Express GX-FW-60S6M-C camera equipped with an Edmund Optics NT54-691
lens (set to a magnification of 0.5X) at a resolution of 2736x2192 (12.5 µm/px)
at 11.5 frames/s using a custom National Instruments LabView acquisition program. The video was subsequently compressed using the open-source XVid
MPEG-4 compression algorithm using maximal quality settings.

Tracking and Image Analysis
The behavioral videos were analyzed using a custom automated analysis program in MathWorks Matlab. The average background was calculated from 50
frames evenly sampled across the entire video. The background was then subtracted from each frame and a global threshold was applied. The thresholded
image was cleaned by applying a series of morphological operations: Incomplete
thresholding of the worm was smoothed by applying morphological closing with
a disk with a similar radius as the worm. Any remaining holes were filled in using
a hole-filling algorithm. Small holes or ones with a low perimeter to area ratio
were excluded as they sometimes fill in worms undergoing an omega turn, as
described in [S13]. Finally, regions in which the worm was just barely touching
itself were split by sequentially applying open, diagonal fill, and majority morphological operations. The worm was then identified as the largest connected
component with an area within 2-fold of the expected value. The centroid was

tracked across frames to obtain ~x(t). In addition, the image skeleton was calculated. Sample images from each of the processing steps are shown in Figure
S11.
The head of the worm was automatically identified using two statistical
properties of the worm’s behavior, namely (i) on average, the head of the worm
moves more than the tail, and (ii) on average, worms spend more time moving
forward (in the direction of their head) than they do moving in reverse. The
procedure is based on skeletonization and centroid detection of the worm image,
which can fail in situations where image contrast is low (e.g. due to non-uniform
background), so trajectories were first divided into segments that contain no
more than 3 frames missing the skeleton and centroid information, and the
head orientation was assigned within each segment based on local behavioral
statistics. Finding statistical criteria that allow unambiguous assignment of
head orientation across all strains studied here was challenging because of the
diversity in their behavior, but the following procedure was found to work well
empirically. The identity of the two ends of the skeleton across image frames
were accounted for by a simple tracking algorithm based on minimizing the total
distance between skeleton points. For segments longer than 150 frames (with
no more than ten consecutive missing skeletons), we found that we could apply
property (i) by computing the variance in body angles within 10% of the body
length from the ends, and assigning the head to the end with the greater summed
variance. However, manual inspection revealed that this sporadicly resulted in
misassignment of the head, identifiable as long reversals interrupted by short
forward runs. Therefore, in addition, for segments longer than 200 frames (with
no more than five consecutive missing centroids), we used property (ii), defining
the head as the end of the skeleton that spent the majority of the trajectory at
the leading edge of movement. Segments shorter than 150 frames were discarded
from further analysis.
The velocity ~v (t) was calculated from the centroid position ~x(t) using the
derivative of a cubic polynomial fit to a sliding 1 s window. The direct estimation of the velocity using a symmetrized derivative had a large δ-correlated
component that interfered with later analysis. The use of the cubic polynomial did not noticeably distort the correlation functions (Figure S12). When
the worm’s speed s(t) = |~v (t)| is very low, its projections on the lab-frame xand y-axes vx = ~v (t) · x̂ and vy = ~v (t) · ŷ become dominated by discretization
(pixelation) noise, and the bearing φ(t) = tan−1 (vy /vx ) is poorly defined. This
in turn leads to large fluctuations in ∆ψ(t) = φ(t) − ψ(t), which can introduce
a large number of false reversal events, noticeable as a steep decrease in the autocorrelation C∆ψ (τ ) = hcos(∆ψ(t + τ ) − ∆ψ(t))i at small values of the delay τ .
We therefore exclude segments of the trajectories corresponding to run intervals
shorter than six frames (less than half a second). When these artifacts are filtered out in this manner, the ∆ψ autocorrelation functions were well described
by single exponentials (Figure S7C). We note that the exclusion of short runs
effectively excludes segments of data in which the worm remains stopped (or at
a very low speed) — a feature that is more pronounced in some strains than
others — and this leads to a systematic bias for simulated model trajectories

to have a higher effective diffusivity Deff than the data for the corresponding
strain (as can be seen in Figure 5C).

Calculation of Behavioral Statistics
The worm’s behavior fluctuated or sometimes drifted over long times (Figure
S4), but the average statistics over 100 s windows were approximately stationary.
In order to focus on dynamics within the 100 s timescale, the mean-squared displacement and all auto- and cross-correlation functions were calculated for 100 s
windows and then averaged. This reduced the influence of longer timescale
fluctuations in the speed and reversal rate. For all calculations, observations
near the boundaries and pairs of points between which the worm approached
the boundary were excluded. The uncertainty of each individual’s phenotype
projection on the principal behavioral mode was computed by projecting the
motility parameters after bootstrapping over the 100s windows of each individual’s trajectory. The standard deviation of the bootstrapped projections is used
as uncertainty.

Calculation of Effective Diffusivity, Deff
To estimate the effective diffusivity Deff , we fit the mean-squared displacement
h[∆x(τ )]2 i over the diffusive regime. For this purpose, we defined the diffusive regime as the time-lag interval after which the normalized velocity autocorrelation C~v (τ )/C~v (0) decayed to below 0.1. We note that in some cases
(especially for fast-moving strains such as CB4856, JU775 and sjh2) the fit to
h[∆x(τ )]2 i = 4Deff τ in this regime was poor due to boundary effects arising
from the finite size of the behavioral arena. For these strains, Deff should be
regarded as a lower bound for the true diffusivity.

Reversal Analysis
The reversal state was assigned as described in the main text by analysis of
∆ψ(t). Assuming a random telegraph process that generates states ∆ψ = 0
(forward) and ∆ψ = π (reverse) with probabilities 1−frev and frev , respectively,
the autocorrelation at long time lags is C∆ψ (τ → ∞) = (1 − 2frev )2 . For the
proposed telegraph process, each state has an exponentially distributed lifetime

To validate our approach, we compared the parameters obtained with our
fitting procedure with those obtained from the distribution of time intervals
between detected switching events (Figure S7). For both forward and reverse
states, the distribution of time intervals between detected switching events (Figure S7B) were well-fit by a biexponential distribution P (Trun > t) = C∆Ψ∞
exp(−t/τshort ) + (1 − C∆Ψ∞ ) exp(−t/τlong ) with the time constants τshort and
τlong typically separated by > 10-fold, and the fraction of short intervals C∆Ψ∞
varying broadly over its full range, 0 ≤ C∆Ψ∞ ≤ 1.0 (Figure S7D,E). Values for
τshort were typically below 1 s (Figure S7D). While some fraction of these short
intervals might represent true runs, they could also arise from spurious detection of switches in velocity bearing due to noise in estimating the centroid (see
legend of Figure S7D) and in any event, contribute little to the overall dynamics
of bearing decorrelation.
Values for τfwd and τrev obtained by fitting equation S1 to the measured autocorrelation functions correlated well with τlong (Figure S7E), thus confirming
that τlong contributes to bearing randomization. We conclude that the forward/reverse switching dynamics are well described by equations (6) and (7),
with parameters τfwd , and τrev .
constants are then τrev =

Speed Analysis
Transitions between forward and reverse runs tended to be excluded from the
analysis because the speed crosses zero, rendering φ a noisy variable generating
many short runs below our exclusion threshold of 6 frames (see above). The
speed set point µs was fit by taking the mean. The remaining parameters
of the speed dynamics (3) were fit by its analytical autocorrelation function:
Cs (τ ) = Ds τs exp (−τ /τs ).

Orientation Analysis
Changes in orientation during runs (i.e. intervals between reversal events) were
analyzed with respect to their mean-squared angular displacements (MSAD)
over time, corresponding to a model for angular diffusion with drift.For an object
lying on a two-dimensional plane, rotational diffusion about an axis normal to
the plane leads to fluctuations in the orientation (an angle measured in the lab
frame) ψ(t) over time according to:
p
(S9)
dψ(t) = 2Dψ dWt ,
where Dψ is the rotational diffusion coefficient, and dWt represents increments
of a Wiener process. Bias in these fluctuations over time can be captured, to
first order, by adding a linear drift term so that

with kψ the drift coefficient.
If kψ and Dψ are constant in time, the mean-squared angular displacement
MSAD(τ ) = h[ψ(t + τ ) − ψ(t)]2 i, is a quadratic function of the time delay τ :
p
h[ψ(t + τ ) − ψ(t)]2 i = h[kψ τ + 2Dψ (Wt+τ − Wt )]2 i = kψ2 τ 2 + 2Dψ τ, (S11)
where h·i denotes averaging over all time pairs separated by τ and the last
equality follows from the Wiener process properties hWt+τ − Wt i = 0 and
h[Wt+τ − Wt ]2 i = τ .
More generally, if kψ (t) and Dψ (t) are time-varying quantities, we can still
approximate within a finite time window (centered about time tw ) the “local”
values kψ,w ≈ kψ (tw ) and Dψ,w ≈ Dψ (tw ). In this study, we extract estimates
of these (possibly time varying) parameters from fits to the averaged MSAD
computed over time windows:
W −1

w=W
X

h[ψ(t + τ ) − ψ(t)]2 i = hkψ2 iw τ 2 + 2hDψ iw τ,

(S12)

w=1

Pw=W
where W is the number of windows and hxiw = W −1 w=1 xw represents
averages over windows. By fitting this averaged MSAD by a√quadratic function
1/2
aτ + bτ 2 , we thus obtain the estimates a/2 = hDψ iw and b = hkψ2 iw . Note
that a/2 √
obtained by this procedure yields an estimate of the mean value for
Dψ , but b corresponds to an estimate not of the mean value, but the rootmean-square (rms) value for kψ . Throughout the text, we therefore explicitly
refer to the latter estimate as kψrms (and refer to the former simply as Dψ ).

Simulations
Reversals, orientation, and speed dynamics were all simulated independently
using the model described. Forward and reverse run durations were chosen
according to equations (5) and (6) by drawing exponential random numbers with
mean value τfwd or τrev . During reverse runs, ∆ψ was set to π. The orientation
(4) and speed (3) dynamics were simulated using the Euler-Maruyama method
[S14] with a time step that matched the frame rate. To prevent negative speeds,
a reflective boundary condition was imposed by taking the absolute value of
the speed at each simulation step. The velocity was then calculated from the
decomposition in (1) and trapezoidally integrated to give the centroid position
~x(t).

Behavioral Mode Analysis
The model parameters were fit to each trajectory to give a phenotypic matrix T.
The phenotypic matrix was centered by subtracting the mean phenotype, T̂ =
T − hTiindiv. . The correlation matrix was then calculated, CT = corr T̂, and
decomposed into eigenvalues λ and eigenvectors (behavioral modes) b, CT b =
λb. To reduce any bias coming from a single trajectory, this calculation was

bootstrapped 1000 times. The significance of the k-th top mode is assessed
by a comparison with the expected variance explained of the k-th top mode
of randomly chosen directions in the behavioral space. We use the explained
variance of the k-th mode of a newly created set of modes where the first k − 1
modes are equal to the top behavioral modes and the remaining modes are
pointing in randomly chosen orthogonal directions. This process is repeated
1000 times.
The projections of each trajectory on these behavioral modes were calculated
by P = T̂b. The uncertainty in the locus of each individual phenotype along
the behavioral mode was computed by projecting the motility parameters after
bootstrapping over the 100 second windows and taking the standard deviation.

Statistics
Unless otherwise indicated, errorbars and confidence intervals represent the 2.5%
and 97.5% percentiles (spanning the 95% confidence interval) estimated from
1000 bootstrap samples. All probability distributions were empirically estimated
using kernel density methods in Python’s Seaborn package with a bandwidth
automatically selected using Scott’s rule of thumb [S15]. Tabulated mean values
of the effective diffusivity model and the motility model (Table S1-S4) represent
geometric rather than arithmetic means was used as the parameters varied lognormally.

Derivation of the Velocity Autocorrelation Function Under
the Assumption of Independence
The velocity autocorrelation function can be written in terms of the motility
components,
C~v (τ ) = h~v (0) · ~v (τ )i
= hs(0) [cos [ψ(0) + ∆ψ(0)] , sin [ψ(0) + ∆ψ(0)]] ×
×s(τ ) [cos [ψ(τ ) + ∆ψ(τ )] , sin [ψ(τ ) + ∆ψ(τ )]]i

(S13)

The expected value of the product of independent random variables is the
product of the expected value of each variable, i.e. hxyi = hxihyi. Therefore we
can factor out Cs = hs(0)s(τ )i, leaving the vector product with ψ and ∆ψ. The
expanded vector product is:
C~v (τ ) = Cs (τ ) × hcos [ψ(0) + ∆ψ(0)] cos [ψ(τ ) + ∆ψ(τ )]
+ sin [ψ(0) + ∆ψ(0)] sin [ψ(τ ) + ∆ψ(τ )]i

(S14)

The trigonometric functions on ψ(t) + ∆ψ(t) can be rewritten as products of
trigonometric functions of the terms:
cos [ψ(t) + ∆ψ(t)] = cos ψ(t) cos ∆ψ(t) − sin ψ(t) sin ∆ψ(t)
sin [ψ(t) + ∆ψ(t)] = sin ψ(t) cos ∆ψ(t) + cos ψ(t) sin ∆ψ(t)

However, since ∆ψ(t) = {0, π}, sin ∆ψ(t) = 0:
cos [ψ(t) + ∆ψ(t)] = cos ψ(t) cos ∆ψ(t)
sin [ψ(t) + ∆ψ(t)] = sin ψ(t) cos ∆ψ(t)
Substituting into (S14),
C~v (τ ) = Cs (τ ) × hcos ψ(0) cos ψ(τ ) cos ∆ψ(0) cos ∆ψ(τ )+
sin ψ(0) sin ψ(τ ) cos ∆ψ(0) cos ∆ψ(τ )i

(S15)

We can now factor out Cψ (τ ) = hcos [ψ(τ ) − ψ(0)]i = hcos ψ(0) cos ψ(τ ) +
sin ψ(0) sin ψ(τ )i to get:
C~v (τ ) = Cs (τ )Cψ (τ )hcos ∆ψ(0) cos ∆ψ(τ )i
Finally, we substitute (again dropping sin ∆ψ(t) terms):
C∆ψ (τ ) = hcos [∆ψ(0) − ∆ψ(τ )]i = hcos ∆ψ(0) cos ∆ψ(τ )i
to get:

Figure S1: Confinement by the boundary affects the mean-squared displacement (MSD) at long times, but does not impair resolution of the ballistic to
diffusive transition. We compare the statistical behavior of C. elegans N2 in
the experiments presented here within small (1-cm) arenas (black) and a previously reported dataset that used larger (5-cm) arenas [S1] (red). The MSD
(A), defined as h[∆x(τ )]2 i ≡ h|~x(t + τ ) − ~x(t)|2 i, of our small-arena dataset is
similar to that of the large-arena dataset at short times, but does show mild effects of confinement at long times (& 100 s). The ballistic to diffusive transition
can be more closely studied by examining decay of the velocity autocorrelation
function (VACF), defined as Cv (τ ) ≡ h~v (t) · ~v (tR+ τ )i (B), which is related to
τ
MSD (i.e. [∆x(τ )]2 ) by (d/dτ )h[∆x(τ )]2 i = 2 0 dτ 0 C~v (τ 0 ) [S16]. The decay
of the VACF to zero, which indicates orientation randomization and hence the
transition from the ballistic to diffusive regime, is not significantly affected by
the presence of the confining boundary.

Cumulative distributions of the forward and reverse run durations (Tfwd , Trev )
for an individual worm from each strain (black), fit to a biexponential function
(red). (C) The autocorrelation function of ∆ψ for each strain (black) along
with exponential fit (red). (D, left) The fraction of short runs measured by the
biexponential fits of the transition time distributions (as in B) was inversely
correlated with the average speed of the worm. At low speed, the bearing (and
therefore also ∆ψ, which is used to identify runs) is expected to be dominated
by noise (e.g. pixelation artifacts). (D, right) The fitted time constants for short
forward and reverse intervals were uncorrelated (unlike those for long runs, see
E and also Figure 5A), and typically below the timescale of smoothing filter for
velocity data (1 s), further motivating the exclusion of short intervals in modeling reversal dynamics. (E) τlong , extracted from fits to the transition time
distributions, were correlated with τfwd and τrev , estimated from C∆ψ (panel
C).

Figure S8: Worm run speeds are similar during forward and reverse runs for
individual trajectories (dots, colored by strain). We define run speed as the
top speed during runs (rather than the mean speed, to avoid biases due to runlength differences). The top speed is computed as the 95th percentile of the
speed distribution (rather than the maximum, to avoid outlier effects).

Figure S10: The top behavioral mode effectively captures changes in diffusivity
compared to random projections. (A) The effect of variation on the top behavioral mode (black, as in Figure 5C) compared with a sampling of 100 random
modes (red) on the diffusivity of simulated trajectories. For random modes,
the sign of the mode was chosen such that the diffusivity increased with the
projection along the mode. (B) For each random mode we compute the relative
change in diffusivity between mode values ∆Deff = Deff (2)/Deff (−2) and compare to the same relative diffusivity computed from the top behavioral mode.
The kernel density distribution of the observed change is shown for the 100
samples (ticks). The black line indicates a ratio of 1 (no difference) and most
random projections exhibit less range in ∆Deff .

processed by (1) subtracting the average of 50 frames evenly sampled from the

operations, and (4) the centroid and image skeleton were measured.

and without averaging over 100 s windows. The unfiltered velocity (black), estimated using a symmetrized derivative, contained a δ-correlated short-timescale

such as PS312. The velocity calculated using a 1 s cubic polynomial filter (red)
