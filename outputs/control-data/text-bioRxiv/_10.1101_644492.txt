Abstract
Eukaryotic mRNAs are modified at their 5’ end early during transcription by the addition of
N7-methylguanosine (m7G), which forms the “cap” on the first 5’ nucleotide. Identification
of the 5’ nucleotide on mRNA is necessary for determination of the Transcription Start Site
(TSS). We explored the effect of various reaction conditions on the activity of the yeast
scavenger mRNA decapping enzyme DcpS (yDcpS) and examined decapping of 30
chemically distinct cap structures varying the state of methylation, sugar, phosphate
linkage, and base composition on 25mer RNA oligonucleotides. Contrary to the generally
accepted belief that DcpS enzymes only decap short oligonucleotides, we found that yDcpS
efficiently decaps RNA transcripts as long as 1400 nucleotides. Further, we validated the
application of yDcpS for enriching capped RNA using a strategy of specifically tagging the 5'
end of capped RNA by first decapping and then recapping it with an affinity-tagged
guanosine nucleotide.

Introduction
The 5' ends of eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA) carry a 5' to 5' triphosphate linked 7methyl-guanosine (m7G) cap. The capping occurs at an early stage of transcription and is
involved in splicing, stabilizing and directing the transcript to the cytoplasm where it is
translated. In higher eukaryotes, the canonical m7G cap can be further modified by 2'-Omethylation at nucleotide positions +1 (Cap 1) and +2 (Cap 2) of the RNA. Both capping
and decapping of mRNA are critical components of gene expression. The enzymes
responsible for the decapping have been described from two distinct protein families, the
Nudix pyrophosphohydrolases1 and the HIT family of pyrophosphatases2,3. The
distinguishing characteristic of catalysis by the two families of decapping enzyme is the
resulting products of the reactions (Figure 1). Nudix decapping enzymes perform metal
dependent hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond between the beta and alpha phosphates
to leave a 5’-monophosphate RNA (pRNA) and a 7-methyl-guanosine diphosphate (m7GDP).
A few exceptions have been reported where a Nudix decapping activity results in mixed

diphosphate and monophosphate 5' RNA ends1. On the other hand, HIT decapping
enzymes, including the so-called scavenger decapping enzyme DcpS , hydrolyze the
phosphodiester bond between the gamma and beta phosphates to leave a 5’-diphosphateRNA (ppRNA) and a 7-methyl-guanosine monophosphate4,5 (m7GMP) and are independent
of divalent metal ions6.
DcpS proteins of the HIT family have been identified in fungi and animals. DcpS contains a
conserved set of histidines, the histidine triad sequence, which is necessary for catalysis.
These enzymes are reported to "scavenge" the m7GMP from the 5' terminus of short mRNA
fragments that are produced after extensive 3' to 5' exonuclease digestion by the exosome
complex. Capped RNAs of a length of ten nucleotides and longer have been reported to be
resistant to decapping with the human DcpS4,7. Both human and yeast DcpS have been
shown to play a biological role in the 3’ to 5’ mRNA decay pathway4,8.
Here we characterize the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, DcpS (yDcpS) with respect to cap
structure specificity and RNA substrate length. The focus of our study is not to investigate
the biological role of DcpS, but rather to study the enzyme in vitro in order to establish
conditions in which it might be useful for manipulating RNA. We demonstrate that yDcpS
under specified conditions can decap RNA of a length up to at least 1.4 kb, thus rendering
the 5' end of the RNA enzymatically “recappable”. In addition, we have determined the in
vitro specificity of yDcpS with respect to 30 different cap analog structures at the 5' end of a
25mer RNA substrate. These analogs include Cap 0 and Cap 1 structures varying the
nucleotide at position +1 of the RNA (A, m6A, C, G, or U), as well as the identity (G, dG,
araG, I, A, C, U, or nicotinamide) and methylation status (m7G, m2,2,7G and unmethylated G)
of the cap nucleotide, and the length of the internucleotidic phosphate bridge (di-, tri- or
tetraphosphate). Our results indicate that DcpS can decap most guanosine caps; in contrast,
it shows no activity towards adenosine, cytidine or uridine capped RNAs.

In a previous work, we developed a method termed Cappable-seq9 to enrich primary
prokaryotic RNA transcripts by capping their 5' triphosphate with 3’-desthiobiotin-GTP
(DTB-GTP). In an effort to extend this method to eukaryotic mRNA, we demonstrate here
that yDcpS can decap the 5' end of m7G-capped RNA transcripts of a length from 90 to 1400
nucleotides without appreciable length bias. Further, the yDcpS-treated transcripts can be
recapped with DTB-GTP and recovered after binding to, and eluting from, streptavidin
beads.

Results
Liu et al.4 and Wypijewska et al.10 presented data indicating that human DcpS (hDcpS) does
not decap RNAs longer than approximately ten nucleotides. Cohen et al. showed that the
nematode DcpS was even more limited in its ability to decap oligonucleotides longer than 3
nucleotides11. This precept of acting solely on capped short oligonucleotides has been
attributed to all homologous HIT enzymes12, despite Salehi et al.13 identifying a HIT protein
in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Nhm1, which was determined to decap long mRNA. Nhm1
has about 70% amino acid sequence similarity to the yeast and human DcpS enzymes. As
these two views of Milac and Salehi are conflicting, we decided to characterize yDcpS with
respect to its ability to decap RNA of different lengths. We used recombinant yDcpS
expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity as described in Methods.

Pyrophosphorolysis of the m7GpppA dinucleotide
We first looked at catalysis of the dinucleotide cap analog m7GpppA, as the characterization
of DcpS typically involves pyrophosphorolysis of cap analogs which are dinucleotides of
NpppN structure4,6,14–16. Cap analogs can be considered as a capped RNA of one nucleotide
in length. Both Malys et al.17 and Liu et al.18 demonstrated the pyrophosphorolysis of
m7GpppG dinucleotide with a rate constant of 0.012/sec for yDcpS and 0.09/sec for hDcpS,
respectively. We compared the relative activity of hDcpS and yDcpS towards the m7GpppA
dinucleotide. We determined the decapping rate at 50 µM m7GpppA dinucleotide by

LC/MS analysis (Figure 2A). The results indicate the two enzymes catalyze the
pyrophosphorolysis of dinucleotide with similar rates: yDcpS at 0.08/sec and hDcpS at
0.14/sec. Although the rate constant seen here for yDcpS is about 7 times faster than that
reported by Malys et al., their incubation temperature was lower (30 ˚C), the ionic strength
was greater (100 mM KOAc) and the pH was higher (pH 7.0). Thus, the catalysis of the
dinucleotide observed with our preparation of yDcpS is consistent with published
literature.

Yeast DcpS decaps a 25mer RNA
To determine whether yDcpS can decap an RNA longer than 15 nucleotides, a 25mer Cap 1
RNA synthesized and capped in vitro, was combined with total E. coli RNA and used as a
substrate. The E. coli RNA was included to more closely resemble an in vitro reaction where
only a subset of total eukaryotic RNA would be substrate for the DcpS. This mixture was
incubated with yDcpS, and aliquots were sampled over time and analyzed by gel
electrophoresis. As shown in Figure 2b, with increasing incubation time of up to three
hours, a larger fraction of the 25mer RNA is shifted to the position of the decapped species,
demonstrating that yDcpS is capable of decapping a longer RNA than what was reported
previously.

The effect of ionic strength and pH on decapping activity
In vitro decapping of DcpS was assessed at various ionic strength and pH conditions by
using a synthetic 25mer Cap 0 RNA modified with a 3’-FAM label. Substrate and product of
the decapping reaction were resolved and quantified by capillary electrophoresis (CE)
(Figure 2c). As shown in Table 1A, the decapping reaction is significantly inhibited by
increasing salt concentration, with KCl being a more potent inhibitor than NaCl. The
optimal buffering pH was in the 6 - 6.5 range. yDcpS exhibited very little decapping activity
in the VCE Capping Buffer at pH 8.0 and in phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 (Table 1B).
Furthermore, a control reaction with a 5' triphosphate 3'-FAM labeled 25mer showed no

measurable conversion of the triphosphate to di- or mono-phosphate after incubation with
50 µM yDcpS in decapping buffer at 37˚C for one hour as determined by CE analysis.

The effect of RNA 5' secondary structure on decapping accessibility
To determine whether the substrate secondary structure has an impact on the yDcpS
activity, complementary synthetic RNA oligos were annealed to the 3’-FAM-labeled 25mer
Cap 0 RNA to create a blunt end, a 10-nucleotide 5' recessed cap, or a 5-nucleotide 5’
extended cap end. The extent of decapping was compared to the single-stranded capped
25mer. All 3 double-stranded substrates were decapped, with the 5’ extended cap
substrate being decapped as efficiently as the single-stranded control, while the 5' recessed
and blunt ended caps were more resistant to decapping. These results indicate that while
yDcpS prefers unstructured 5’ ends, structured ends can also be decapped at higher
enzyme concentration (Figure 3) .

Cap specificity of yDcpS
Liu et al.4 suggested that the cap analog GpppG was not likely a substrate for DcpS because
the GpppG dinucleotide at 10 μM was not an effective inhibitor of m7GpppG decapping.
Wypijewska et al.10 and Cohen et al.11 demonstrated that DcpS from H. sapiens, C. elegans,
and A. suum differ from one another as they decap various cap dinucleotide analogs at
dissimilar rates. Yeast mRNA caps are only methylated at the N-7 position and not at the 2'O position19,20. In contrast, the majority of the capped structures from HeLa cells are Cap 1
(m7GpppNm) and Cap 2 (m7GpppNmNm), whereas Cap 0 (GpppN) has not been
identified21,22. Additionally, a number of still uncharacterized cap structures have been
reported to occur on short RNAs 23. Hence, we sought to determine the susceptibility of 30
distinct 25mer RNAs featuring different cap structure permutations to decapping with
yDcpS (Figure 4a).
Various capped 25mer RNA substrates (100 nM) were incubated for 60 minutes at 37 °C
with increasing concentrations of yDcpS varying by a factor of three. The reactions were

then analyzed by PAGE and the relative extent of decapping determined after staining and
imaging the gels. A typical set of gel images was compiled in Figure 4b. It can be estimated
from the gel electrophoresis results that, m7GpppA, m7Gpppm6A, m7Gpppm6Am, m7GpppG,
and m7GpppGm caps were removed at a similar yDcpS concentration of 0.9 µM, while
GpppG required about a 3-fold higher concentration. Interestingly, while yDcpS can decap
deoxyriboguanosine and arabinoguanosine caps, no activity was detected towards 2,2,7trimethylguanosine, adenosine, cytidine, or uridine capped RNAs (Figure 4c). As for the
length of the internucleotidic phosphate bridge, yDcpS was able to decap tri- or
tetraphosphate, but no diphosphate caps. Not surprisingly, yDcpS had no activity on a
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) capped RNA.

yDcpS decapping followed by VCE recapping
A characteristic of yDcpS catalysis is the removal of the m7G from the cap in the form of
m7GMP leaving a 5'-diphosphate on the 5' terminus of the RNA4. 5'-diphosphate RNA is a
known substrate for in vitro capping using the Vaccinia virus Capping Enzyme (VCE)9,24,25.
We took advantage of these two reactions to tag a m7G-capped 25mer RNA with an affinity
group, by first decapping the RNA with yDcpS, and then recapping it by treatment with VCE
and DTB-GTP9. These reactions were performed in the presence of excess total E. coli RNA
in order to simulate a complex mixture of RNA as would be found in total eukaryotic RNA.
As shown by gel electrophoresis for a Cap 1 RNA (Figure 5) and by mass spectroscopy for
Cap 0 (Supplementary Fig. S1-S3), the decapping/recapping process approached
completion, suggesting that this strategy could be extended to capture and enrich native
capped RNA transcripts.

yDcpS decaps long capped RNA transcripts
After demonstrating the efficient decapping and recapping of m7G-capped 25mer RNAs, we
tested whether yDcpS could decap long RNA substrates. We generated a mixture of RNA
transcripts with lengths of 90 to 1400 nucleotides by in vitro transcription from a plasmid
harboring a T7 promoter upstream of the FLuc gene, which had been cleaved with various

restriction endonucleases to generate transcription templates of different lengths (see
Methods). The produced RNA transcripts were capped with GTP by VCE to yield m7Gcapped RNAs. The mixture of capped transcripts was then decapped by incubation with
yDcpS. As a control, an aliquot of the m7G-capped transcripts was incubated in the absence
of yDcpS. Both sets of transcripts were subjected to capping with DTB-GTP by VCE. The
recapped products were exposed to streptavidin beads, and after washing steps to remove
any unbound material, recovered by elution with biotin. As shown in Figure 6, no RNA was
recovered from the fraction that was not treated with yDcpS (Lane 4), while the full-size
range of capped transcripts treated with yDcpS were recovered in the biotin-eluted
fraction. This result demonstrates that yDcpS decapping followed by VCE recapping and
streptavidin-based recovery of transcripts is an efficient process (approximately 50%
yield) and shows minimal length discrimination. This workflow can thus be applied to
eukaryotic mRNA Transcription Start Site (TSS) analysis by appending it to the workflow of
Cappable-seq9.

Discussion
In characterizing yDcpS, we have shown that the methylation status of various canonical
guanosine caps (GpppN, m7GpppN, m7GpppNm, m7Gpppm6A, or m7Gpppm6Am) does not
significantly affect their susceptibility to decapping by this enzyme. We also examined noncanonical m7G caps where the ribose moiety was substituted with arabinose or
deoxyribose. Although these caps have not been shown to exist in nature, they are also
decapped by yDcpS.
Under the conditions described, yDcpS decaps the majority of the guanosine-based caps,
regardless of the nucleotide at position +1. The enzyme prefers m7G over nonmethylated G
caps, and does not decap adenosine, cytosine, uridine, or inosine caps. yDcpS decaps 5'-5'
triphosphate and tetraphosphate linkages, but not diphosphate linkages. Interestingly,
Cohen et al.11 reported that nematode DcpS decapped a 2,2,7-trimethylated G cap

(commonly found in certain small nuclear and nucleolar RNAs), while the human DcpS did
not. We found that yDcpS, resembling hDcpS, did not decap 2,2,7-trimethylated guanosine.
The in vitro characterization of yDcpS presented here provides evidence that yDcpS should
be a useful reagent for generating recappable 5' ends from capped RNAs. We demonstrate
that yDcpS decaps m7G-capped RNAs from as short as 25 to at least 1400 nucleotides,
leaving a 5’-diphosphate end. The process of decapping and recapping with an affinitytagged nucleotide would be advantageous for identifying and enriching 5' capped termini
of mRNAs in eukaryotes. This would expand the utility of the prokaryotic Cappable-seq
method9 to include eukaryotic mRNAs. Cappable-seq has been used to determine the
transcription start sites of primary transcripts of prokaryotes at single base resolution via
the attachment of a biotinylated GTP analogue to the 5’-triphosphate end of primary RNA
transcripts by action of the Vaccinia capping enzyme (VCE). The extension of this method
to canonical eukaryotic mRNAs requires the removal of the m7G moiety to generate a
recappable end (such as a tri- or diphosphate 5’ end), which we now show is attainable
with the use of yDcpS. Therefore, we anticipate being able to enrich eukaryotic mRNA by
combining yDcpS-mediated decapping followed by recapping with affinity tagged GTP and
generating libraries for high-throughput sequencing. Progress towards this goal is
underway in our laboratory.

extension (UUGAGCGUACUCGACGAAGU), and 5' cap recession
(UUGAGCGUACUCGACGAAGUUCUACAAUGACCAUC) were purchased from Integrated DNA
Technologies (IDT). The 5’-triphosphate 25mer RNAs (5’-pppNUAGAACUUCGUCGAGUACGCUCAA-3’, wherein N is G, C, A, or U) utilized for the
generation of m7GpppN, m7GpppNm, m7dGpppN, GpppN, and m7AraGpppN were
individually synthesized as previously described26. The 5’-monophosphate 25mer RNAs
(5’-p-NUAGAACUUCGUCGAGUACGCUCAA-3’, wherein N is G, A, or U) utilized for the
generation of m7Gpppm6A, m7Gpppm6Am, GppppA, GppA, and NpppG (wherein N is U, C, A,

synthesizer. For the synthesis of 5’-p-m6AUAGAACUUCGUCGAGUACGCUCAA-3’, a N6Methyl-A-CE phosphoramidite from Glen Research was utilized. Detailed protocols for the
enzymatic or chemical generation of the 5'-capped 25mer RNAs utilized in this study are
described in the Supplementary Information section.

Preparation of yDcpS
The gene for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae yDcpS (YLR270W) was codon optimized for E.
coli expression and designed with an amino terminal His tag to be expressed from a T7
promoter in plasmid pET28a (Supplementary Fig. S4). The predicted molecular weight of
the fusion is 42,945 daltons. The construct was synthesized by Genscript. The protein was
expressed in E. coli ER3600 and purified to near homogeneity (greater than 95%) by
chromatography over HisTrap, SP, and Q resins. The protein's size as determined by SDSPAGE is consistent with its predicted molecular weight. The final preparation of yDcpS was
12 µg of protein/µL, in a storage buffer of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM
EDTA, and 50% glycerol. The protein was stored at -20 ˚C. The DcpS preparation was
determined to be free of detectable RNAse contamination by assay with a 300mer RNA
transcript (~100 ng) incubated with 12 µg of yDcpS in a 20 µL reaction in the decapping
buffer 10 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.5, 1 mM EDTA , and in 20 mM Tris-Acetate pH 7.9 buffer
containing 50 mM potassium acetate, 10 mM magnesium acetate, and 1 mM DTT for 4
hours. No degradation of the 300mer band by PAGE analysis was observed.

Human DcpS
Human DcpS (hDcpS) was purchased from Enzymax LLC, Lexington, KY. The protein
concentration of DcpS was determined by OD280 using the molar extinction coefficient of
30495 M-1 cm-1.

Decapping reactions
Unless otherwise noted, the decapping was carried out at 37 ˚C in the decapping buffer 10
mM Bis-Tris pH 6.5, 1 mM EDTA. With the exception of the reactions containing FAMlabeled RNAs (see below), all reactions using capped 25mer RNA substrates were
terminated by the addition of 1 volume of 2X RNA loading dye (NEB). The reactions using
the m7GpppA dinucleotide cap analog were terminated with the addition of
phenol/chloroform.

In vitro decapping of 5’-capped synthetic 3'-FAM-labeled RNA
In vitro decapping reactions were carried out in a 20 µL reaction containing 10 mM Bis-Tris
pH 6.5, 1 mM EDTA, 500 nM substrate RNA (5’[m7Gppp]GUAGAACUUCGUCGAGUACGCUCAA[FAM]-3, Bio-Synthesis, Inc.), and 60 nM
yDcpS at 37 ˚C for 60 minutes, unless otherwise indicated (Table 1). Reactions were
stopped by heat inactivation at 70 ˚C for 15 minutes. Reactions were diluted in nucleasefree water to reach a final substrate concentration of 5 nM before capillary electrophoresis

software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and an in-house software suite. The electrophoretic
mobility of the Cap 0 substrate and the 5’-diphosphate product was calibrated against RNA
standards generated enzymatically from a synthetic 5’-triphosphate 25mer. The 5’diphosphate standard was generated by treating the chemically synthesized 5’-

triphosphate/3’-FAM-labeled 25mer with the S. cerevisiae Cet127. The 5’-monophosphate
standard was generated by treating the 5’-triphosphate/3’-FAM-labeled 25mer with
Apyrase (NEB). The 5’-hydroxyl standard was generated by treating the 5’-triphosphate/3’FAM-labeled 25mer with calf intestinal phosphatase (NEB). The cap 0 standard was
generated by treating the 5’-triphosphate/3’-FAM-labeled 25mer with Vaccinia virus
capping enzyme (VCE, NEB) in the presence of GTP and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). The
RNA standards were purified using RNA Clean and Concentrator kit (Zymo Research). The
identity of the standards was verified by intact mass spectrometry. The 25mer Cap 1 RNA
was generated by treating the chemically synthesized 3’-FAM-labeled Cap 0 25mer RNA
with mRNA Cap 2’-O-Methyltransferase (NEB) in the presence of SAM. The Cap 1 25mer
RNA was purified using Monarch RNA Cleanup kit (50 µg capacity, NEB). Complete
methylation was verified by digestion of RNA with the Nucleoside Digestion Mix (NEB,
M0649) and LC-MS analysis.

In vitro cap specificity assay of yDcpS with 30 different cap structures
The reaction conditions for decapping consisted of 100 nM 5’-capped 25mer RNA and 0,
0.3, 0.9, 2.7, 8 or 25 µM DcpS in a 10 µL reaction volume in 10 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.5 and 1
mM EDTA. The reactions were incubated for 60 minutes at 37 ˚C and terminated by the
addition 2 µL of Proteinase K (NEB) which had been supplemented with 0.1 reaction
volume of 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0, and further incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature.
To each 12 µL reaction was added 12 µL of RNA loading dye (2X) (NEB). This mixture was
heat denatured at 80 ˚C for 3 minutes, and an aliquot of 5 µL was loaded onto a 15%
polyacrylamide TBE-Urea gel (Invitrogen). The gel was run at 180 volts for 75 minutes. The
RNA was visualized with SYBR Gold stain.

reaction was terminated by addition of 4 µL of 1M Tris HCl pH 8.0 and 2 µL of Proteinase K.
The reaction was further incubated for 30 minutes at 37 ˚C and then heated to 94 ˚C for 3
minutes. The RNA was purified by binding to Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) by
addition of 2 volumes of beads, and to that final volume additional 1.5 volumes of ethanol.
After washing the beads with 80% ethanol, the RNA was eluted in 30 µL of 1 mM Tris pH
7.5 and 0.1 mM EDTA. A 20 µL reaction containing 1X VCE buffer (NEB), 10 µL of the eluted
RNA, 0.1 mM SAM, 0.5 mM DTB-GTP (NEB) was split into two 9.5 µL reactions: in one tube
was added 1 µL of VCE and in the other tube was added 1 µL of water. Samples were
electrophoresed on a 15% TBE-Urea gel (Invitrogen) and stained with SYBR Gold. A similar
experiment for decapping and recapping was carried out with a Cap 0 25mer RNA. The
results of this experiment were confirmed by mass spectrometry (Supplementary Fig. S1S3).

Preparation of long (0.09 - 1.4 kb) m7G-capped transcripts
m7G-capped RNA substrates 90 to 1400 nucleotides long were generated by T7 RNA
polymerase (NEB) transcription of different DNA templates generated from an FLuc
plasmid, each digested with one of the following restriction endonucleases: NlaIV,
HpyCH4V, Hpy166II, PsiI, AflIII, EcorI, BspQI, BcoDI, or EcoRV in separate reactions. The
resulting RNA transcripts comprised 90, 171, 240, 419, 587, 681, 896, 1117, and 1432
nucleotides, respectively. The individual transcripts were combined in approximate equal
amounts. The transcript mixture was subsequently capped by standard VCE capping
reaction with GTP and SAM.
Data acquisition and settings
RNA was loaded onto 6% or 15% PAGE Urea gels and electrophoresed for 75-85 minutes at
180 V. The gels were stained with SYBR Gold and imaged with an AlphaImager HP. The
images were imported into Photoshop, inverted and levels were auto-adjusted.

Biochemical Assays for DcpS. (a) Conversion of m7GpppA dinucleotide to m7GMP. A 100
µL reaction in decapping buffer containing 50 µM m7GpppA and either 50 nMy DcpS (blue
□) or 85 nM hDcpS (red ○) was incubated at 37 ˚C. 10 µL samples were withdrawn at the
indicated times. The reactions were terminated by the addition of equal volume of
phenol/chloroform. The relative quantity of the remaining dinucleotide m7GpppA, m7GMP,
and ADP were determined by LC-MS. (b) Decapping of a 25mer Cap 1 RNA by yDcpS. A 30
µL reaction containing 300 ng of total E. coli RNA and 60 ng of 25mer Cap 1 RNA was
incubated for 3 hours at 37 ˚C with 130 ng of yDcpS in 10 mM MES pH 6.5 and 1 mM EDTA.
At 0 minutes a 5 µL aliquot was mixed with 2X RNA loading dye stop solution (Lane 1).
Likewise 5 µL aliquots were taken at 5, 60, 120, and 180 min (Lanes 2 to 5, respectively).
The RNA aliquots were analyzed by 15% TBE-Urea PAGE stained with SYBR Gold. (c)
Capillary electrophoresis of 3'-FAM-labeled 5'-capped 25mer RNA. Top panel shows a
representative example of the decapping reaction progress. The 25mer Cap 0 RNA was
incubated with yDcpS for various times indicated on the left. Bottom panel shows the
mobility shift for standards of 25mer RNAs containing different 5’ ends. All data were
plotted relative to GeneScanTM120 LIZTM Applied Biosystems standards.

The effect of the secondary structure at the 5' end of RNA on the decapping activity of
yDcpS. Complementary synthetic RNA oligos were annealed to the 3’-FAM-labeled 25mer
Cap 0 RNA to create a blunt (○), a 5’ extension (△), or a 5’ recession (⬦) as depicted on the
right. The extent of decapping of each after 60 minutes at 37 ˚C with various
concentrations of yDcpS was determined by capillary electrophoresis. The following
complementary sequences were used for blunt, UUGAGCGUACUCGACGAAGUUCUAC; 5'
extension UUGAGCGUACUCGACGAAGU; and 5' recession,
UUGAGCGUACUCGACGAAGUUCUACAAUGACCAUC.

reactions of 25mer RNA substrates (m7Gppp6mA, m7GpppG, m7GpppGm, GpppG,
m7Gppp6mAm, m7GpppA) incubated with increasing concentrations of yDcpS for 60
minutes at 37 ̊C. The reactions were electrophoresed on a 15% TBE-Urea gel and stained
with SYBR Gold. The full-length gel images are shown in the Supplemental Information. (c)
Substrates decapped (greater than 95% at 2.7 µM yDcpS) are shaded in green and
substrates resistant to decapping (less than 10% at 25 µM yDcpS) are shaded in pink.
Bolded characters indicate canonical cap structures (known or anticipated). Asterisks
indicate 5-10 fold reduced decapping relative to m7GpppG-25mer at 0.9 μM yDcpS.
Figure 5.
yDcpS decapping of a 25mer Cap1 RNA followed by VCE recapping. A m7G-capped 25mer
RNA (0.22 μg) was mixed with 1 µg of total E. coli RNA and incubated with 0.1 nmol of
yDcpS for 2 h at 37 ˚C. An aliquot was removed prior to the addition of yDcpS to provide a
reference band for m7G-capped 25mer (Lane 1). The yDcpS reaction was terminated by
addition of Proteinase K and purified using Ampure XP beads. After elution, the RNA was
incubated in 1X VCE buffer containing 0.1 mM SAM and 0.5 mM DTB-GTP in the presence
(Lane 2) or absence (Lane 3) of VCE for 1 h at 37 ˚C. All samples were electrophoresed on a
15% TBE-Urea gel and stained with SYBR Gold.

Efficient recovery of long capped RNA transcripts by a decapping/recapping procedure. A
mixture of m7G-capped RNAs (0.090 -1.4 kb) was divided into two samples. One sample
was incubated with yDcpS and one without yDcpS, and both were subsequently treated
with VCE and DTB-GTP. An equal fraction of each was exposed to streptavidin beads, which
were washed and eluted. Lanes 1 (+ yDcpS) and 2 (- yDcpS) show the samples after the VCE
reaction. Lanes 3 (+ yDcpS) and 4 (- yDcpS) show the eluates from streptavidin beads. All
