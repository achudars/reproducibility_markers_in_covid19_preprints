Abstract
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are known to potentiate tumor initiation and maintenance in Oral

emerged as crucial players in tumor development. However, their role in maintenance of
OSCC stem cells remains unclear. Here we report that CD44highCD24low population within
OSCC cells and primary HNSCC tumors have an elevated expression of miR-146a.
Moreover, over-expression of miR-146a results in enhanced stemness phenotype by
augmenting CD44highCD24low population. We demonstrate that miR-146a induces stemness
by stabilizing β-catenin with concomitant loss of E-cadherin and CD24. Interestingly, CD24
is identified as a novel functional target of miR-146a and ectopic expression of CD24
abrogates miR-146a driven potential CSC phenotype. Mechanistic analysis reveals that
higher CD24 levels inhibit AKT phosphorylation leading to β-catenin degradation. Using
stably expressing miR-146a/CD24 OSCC cell lines, we also validate that the miR-146a/
CD24/AKT loop significantly alters tumorigenic ability in vivo. Furthermore, we confirmed
that β-catenin trans-activates miR-146a, thereby forming a positive feedback loop
contributing to stem cell maintenance. Collectively, our study demonstrates that miR-146a
regulate CSCs in OSCC through CD24-AKT-β-catenin axis.

Highlights:
•

MiR-146a induces cancer stem cell characteristics in OSCC by targeting CD24

•

CD24 abrogates miR-146a mediated stemness via β-catenin degradation in non-CSCs

•

Akt/Wnt pathway is critical for sustenance of miR-146a driven potential CSCs

1. Introduction
OSCC is the most prevalent form of head and neck cancers worldwide with more than 60%
individuals diagnosed with advanced tumors[1]. The oral CSCs are held responsible for
tumor aggressiveness leading to treatment failures, relapse and development of metastases [2,
3]. Over the past decade, epigenetic re-programming has emerged as a crucial mechanism of
regulating cancer stem cell dynamics [4]. MiRNAs, a small ncRNAs of 20-22 nucleotides is a
known epigenetic modulator, de-regulation of which may have critical roles in disease
development [5],[6].They can act either as oncogenes or as tumor-suppressors depending
upon the specific genes targeted. In-fact miRNA associated signatures are now considered for
cancer specific diagnostic and prognostic purposes [7].
MiRNAs not only regulate primary cellular functions like proliferation,
differentiation, migration and invasion, but also directly or indirectly influence CSC
functions [8-11]. These are mostly attributed to altered signaling pathways including cell
surface markers, pluripotency factors, chemo-resistance and epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) markers[12].Role of miR-34a, miR-145a and miR-200bc family in
regulating CD44, Oct4, Sox2, KLF4, Bmi1, Zeb1/2 and Notch1 has been well
established[13-16]. MiR-146a is predominantly an onco-miR, which directly targets IRAK1,
traf6, and numb genes in OSCC and imparts tumorigenicity [17].Emerging evidence on
miR-146a suggests that it directs the self-renewal process in colorectal cancer stem cells by
regulating Snail-β-catenin axis which also contributes to EMT[18]. High nuclear
accumulation of β-catenin, along with lowering of E-cadherin is frequently associated with
higher tumor grade and poor prognosis in various cancers[19]. Given the role of Wnt/β-

catenin signaling in CSC maintenance and the miRNAs in regulating wnt pathway,
understanding the step-wise regulation of its mediators is crucial [20-22].
Our recent study has characterized CD44highCD24low cells as the potential CSC
population in OSCC[2]. CD24, a small cell surface protein, was identified as a critical
determinant of differentiation in hematopoietic cells and mammary epithelial cells[23].
Besides role in adhesion, cadherin switching or migration, CD24 is involved in diverse
signaling networks, thus promoting oncogenesis or regression[24]. Although role of CD44 is
well established[3], the involvement of CD24 in determining stemness is less explored,
particularly in oral CSCs. In this study, we show that miR-146a imparts
CD44highCD24lowstatus to OSCC cells merely by targeting CD24. Changes in β-catenin pools
seemed to be an important event in altering the afore-mentioned phenotypes downstream of
miR-146a through AKT pathway. We propose that miR-146a/CD24/AKT/β-catenin axis
influences the stemness characteristics of CD44highCD24low population in oral cancer cells.

2. Materials and methods
2.1 Cell culture and transfection
Human OSCC cell lines SCC131, SCC084 and SCC036 were obtained from Dr. Sussane
Gollin, University of Pittsburgh. These cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37°C in DMEM
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics (Life
Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., MA, USA). The ATCC (American Type Culture
Collection) oral cancer cell line, SCC25 was cultured in complete DMEM-F12 medium and
400ng/ml Hydrocortisone (Sigma Aldrich) under similar conditions. For transfection,
LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen) was used in serum free medium. Transfected cells were
harvested after 48 hrs or 72 hrs for over-expression or knockdown studies respectively.

2.2 Plasmid constructs, miRNA inhibitors and siRNAs
We obtained mir-146a and mir-146a SDM expressing pU61 construct from Dr. Nitai. P.
Bhattacharjee (SINP, Kolkata). The TOP-flash/FOP-flash reporters, dnTCF4, Numb, and
pcDNA3.1 empty vector along with miR-146a promoter LucA, LucB and mLucA Luciferase
constructs were kind gifts from Muh-Hwa Yang (Taiwan). Human CTNNB1 expression
plasmid deposited by Eric Fearon was purchased from Addgene (#16828). CD24 cDNA
cloned into the pCDNA3.1 vector and the full-length 3’-UTR of CD24 cloned into pMIR
(Ambion) were obtained from Heike Allgayer (University of Heidelberg, Germany). AntimiR-146a (AM-34a) (ID: AM11030) were obtained from Ambion, CD24 siRNA (a pool of 3
target specific siRNAs) and scramble siRNA from Santa Cruz. CTNNB1 shRNA constructs
(Addgene # 18803) were provided by Dr. Mrinal Kanti Ghosh, IICB, Kolkata. MiR-146a
over-expression cassette was sub-cloned from pU61 into the pLKO.1 TRC vector (Addgene
plasmid #10878). Packaging plasmids psPAX2 (Addgene plasmid # 12260) and pMD2.G
(Didier Trono, Addgene plasmid# 12259) was used to generate the miR-146a over-expression
lentiviral particles and target cells were infected following the manufacturer's protocol. Stable
transduced cells were selected by puromycin (Gibco) and over-expression efficiencies were
verified by qRT-PCR and western blotting. CD24 was co-transfected and clones were
selected by G418.

2.3 Quantitative Real Time PCR
TRIzol (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., MA USA) method was used for isolation
of total RNA as per manufacturer’s instructions. 250 ng of RNA were converted to cDNAs
using stem-loop primers specific for reverse transcription of individual miRNAs[25]. MiRNA

cDNAs were amplified with forward primers specific for individual miRNAs and a URP,
with U6 snRNA as an endogenous reference control. For mRNA expression changes,
protocol was similar to that described previously [2]. SYBR Green master mix (Roche, USA)
was used to perform qRT-PCR in the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR instrument (Applied
Biosystems, USA). Fold change values (2–ΔΔCT) were calculated from average of three
independent experiments. Primer sequences of genes, miRNA forward and loop primers are
listed in Supplementary File 1.

2.4 Analysis of TCGA and NCI-60 datasets
RNA and miRNA-seq data were acquired for a total of 292 HNSCC tumor specimens from
TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) data portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/). We first
grouped top 25% of CD44 high and low expressing tumors and then further sub-grouped
25% of these tumors based on CD24 expression. These were designated as CD44highCD24low
and CD44lowCD24high, wherein we checked the differential expression of miR-146a and
calculated statistical significance using R Limma Package. Node status of these patients was
also correlated with miR-146a expression using GraphPad Prism5 software. NCI-60 miRNA
expression dataset (GEO accession number GSE26375) was analyzed to compare the
miR-146a expression between the epithelial and mesenchymal groups as classified earlier
[26] using Mann Whitney’s u test.

2.5 Flow cytometry
CD44-PE and CD24-FITC (BD Pharmingen) conjugated antibodies were used for double
staining of miR-146a transfected cells. Cells were then washed and subjected to flow

cytometry on the BD LSRFortessa and analysed using BD FACSDiva 6.2 software. Isotype
controls were included for the non-specific staining.

2.6 Sphere forming assay
MiR-146a transfected cells were trypsinised and a single cell suspension was ensured. Low
attachment 6-well plate were used for re-seeding the cells at a density of 5000 cells/ml in
DMEM-F-12 serum free media containing 1% B27 supplement, 20 ng/ml of EGF and 20 ng/
ml of bFGF (Invitrogen). 500 µl of media was added every 2-3 days. Photographs of the
spheres were taken under inverted microscope (Leica TCS SP8; Germany) with 20X
magnification at 7-14 days. All experiments were done in biological triplicates.

2.7 Immuno-fluorescence
Sorted populations of SCC131 were grown on cover-slips overnight and then fixed with
chilled aceto-methanol (1:1). 0.03% Saponin (Calbiochem, Germany) was used for
permeabilization followed by blocking with 3% BSA. Rabbit monoclonal antibody against βcatenin and mouse monoclonal antibody against CD24, CD44 (Cell signaling technology)
were added at a dilution of 1:200 and incubated overnight. It was then probed with antirabbit-FITC and anti-mouse Alexa-Flour 633nm conjugated secondary antibody (molecular
probes) and counter stained with DAPI (Invitrogen) for nuclear staining. Images were taken
under a confocal microscope (Andor Spinning Disc Confocal Microscope, Andor
Technology, Belfast, Ireland) at 60X magnification.

Cell lysates were prepared after 48 hrs of transfection in NP-40 lysis buffer (Invitrogen) and
protease inhibitor cocktail (1X). Equivalent amounts of denatured protein samples were
subjected to SDS-PAGE (8%-10%), separated by size and transferred on to PVDF membrane
(Millipore, Billerica, USA). Antibodies used for immuno-blotting were polyclonal β-catenin,
E-cadherin, CD44 and CD24, Involucrin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA), polyclonal
Oct4 and Sox2 (Abcam), polyclonal C-myc, Akt and phospho-Akt (Cell Signaling
Technology, USA). Bands were obtained using ECL substrate (Thermo Scientific, USA) from
HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma). Proteasome Inhibitor MG132 (Calbiochem)
and Akt inhibitor LY294002 (Cell signaling Technology, USA) were both used at a
concentration of 50 µM. Transfected cells were treated for 4 hours before harvesting. Band
intensities of each protein were analyzed by ImageJ to obtain densitometric values for their
quantification. These were normalized to β-actin for individual experimental sets and fold
change calculated. All the histograms were expressed as means ± S.D. of three different
experiments and p values computed in GraphPad Prism 5 (Student’s two tailed t test).

2.9 In vivo tumor xenograft experiments
Animal experiments were performed following guidelines of the institutional animal ethics
committee of National Centre for Cell Science, Pune. All the animals were issued under the
project IAEC/2012/B183. To investigate the effect of miR-146a overexpression on OSCC
growth in vivo, 3×106 empty vector- and microRNA overexpression construct-containing
SCC084 cells were injected subcutaneously into the dorsal flanks of eight NOD/SCID male
mice (18 weeks old) on left and right side respectively. When palpable tumors could be seen
the mice were segregated into groups of four each. Mice in one of the groups were injected
with 25 mg/kg of body weight of Quercetin (Sigma) on every alternate day for a period of 15

days. The experiment was terminated when the average miR-146a over-expressing SCC084
tumor volumes in the group which received no quercetin reached about 1200 mm3. At the
termination of the experiment, the animals were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation and the
tumors were collected for further analysis. Tumor diameters were measured each time the
quercetin was injected and at the termination of the experiment using digital Vernier Caliper.
Excised tumor tissues were weighed and then stored in RNAlater solution (ThermoFisher
Scientific) in -20°C freezer. Tumor volumes were determined using the following formula: π/
6[(d1×d2)3/2]; where d1 and d2 are two different diameters of a tumor. In another experiment,
to investigate effect of simultaneous overexpression of miR-146a and CD24 on OSCC
growth in vivo, 3×106 empty vector- and miR-146a and CD24 overexpression constructscontaining SCC084 cells were injected subcutaneously into the dorsal flanks of four NOD/
SCID male mice (15 weeks old) on left and right side respectively. Tumors volumes were
measured when palpable growth could be observed. The experiment was terminated when
tumor volumes reached 1300 mm3. The animals were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation and
the tumors were collected. Tumor tissues were processed as described previously for the
other experiment.

2.10 Reporter assays
Cells seeded in 24 well plates were co-transfected with miR-146a OE plasmid and either
CD24 3’UTR or miR-146a promoter luciferase construct using LipofectamineTM 2000
(Invitrogen). The TOP-Flash and FOP-Flash reporters were also used under similar
conditions. Promega dual luciferase assay system was performed according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. After 48 hr of transfection, medium was washed off with 1x PBS
and cells were lysed with Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) and luminescence was measured in

Promega Glomax 20/20 luminometer. The luminescence values were transfection normalized
with the internal control pRL-TK (50 ng, Renilla Luciferase; Promega). Experiments were
performed with three biological replicates.

2.11 Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Cells seeded in 10cm dishes were transfected. After 48hrs, 1X formaldehyde solution was
added for DNA-protein crosslinking. Cells were lysed in SDS lysis buffer followed by
sonication in Bioruptor (Diagenode) to obtain 200-1000 bp chromatin fragments. ChIP
dilution buffer was used to dilute the sheared chromatin followed by preclearing with Protein
G Agarose beads (Sigma) for 30min. After preclearing, 20% of the lysate was kept aside as
the input and the remaining was divided equally for IP and IgG. Immunoprecipitation was
carried out using 5µg of β-catenin (Santa Cruz) and normal IgG control (Sigma) and
incubated overnight. The following day, Protein G Agarose beads were added to collect the
Antibody/Antigen/Chromatin complex. The complex was washed briefly with cold low salt
immune complex wash followed by high salt immune complex buffer, lithium chloride
immune complex buffer and Tris-EDTA buffer. It was then reverse-crosslinked and the DNA
purified using Phenol/Chloroform extraction method. PCR amplification of the
immunoprecipitated DNA was carried out using primers listed in Supplementary File 1.
Composition of the ChIP buffers are provided in Supplementary methods.

3. Results
3.1 MiR-146a is over-expressed in CD44highCD24low population of OSCC cell lines and
primary tumors
To identify the cellular miRNAs regulating CSC phenotype of OSCC cells, we initially
screened nine miRNAs that are aberrantly expressed in human cancers with their reported
role in cancer stemness and EMT [27-29]. QRT-PCR data showed significant difference in
the expression of miR-200b, miR-138, miR-34a, miR-21 and miR-146a
betweenCD44highCD24low and CD44lowCD24high population of SCC25 cells (Fig. 1a).
Amongst them, we focused on miR-146a in view of its context dependent role in various
cancers[30-32].MiR-146a is consistently over-expressed in oral CSCs, therefore it was
intriguing to explore its possible connection with stemness and the underlying mechanisms.
Up-regulation of miR-146a in the CD44highCD24low population of SCC131 and SCC084 cell
lines was also confirmed (Fig.1b). Further, miR-146a expression was also increased upon
enrichment of isolated CSCs in the sphere forming culture conditions, suggesting its
importance in determining oral CSC property (Fig. 1c). Increased miR-146a expression has
been reported to predict poor survival of OSCC patients[17]. Our analyses in TCGA Head
and Neck Squamous cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) patient’s cohort[33], showed increased
miR-146a expression in patients with CD44highCD24lowsignature compared to those with
CD44lowCD24highprofile (Fig. 1d). While there was not much difference in the histological
stage of the tumors across the two categories, most of the CD44lowCD24high tumors were free
of lymph node metastasis (Figure S1a, Supplementary file 1). Moreover, miR-146a

expression of the node positive patients was relatively higher than that of the node negative
ones, although not statistically significant (Figure S1b). Together, our data suggests high
miR-146a expression as a critical determinant of CSC phenotype in oral tumors.

3.2 Ectopic expression of miR-146a induces CSC characteristics
We next investigated whether ectopic miR-146a affect CSC markers and found a significant
increase in the relative proportion of CD44highCD24low population in SCC131 cells (Fig.2a).
Similar results were also obtained with SCC036, SCC084 and SCC25 cells, respectively
(Figure S2a). Characteristic sphere forming ability of miR-146a expressing SCC131 and
SCC036 cells were also markedly enhanced (Fig. 2b). Concomitantly, ectopic expression of
miR-146a led to the increased expression of intracellular stem cell markers such as Oct4,
Sox2 and C-myc and loss of Involucrin (Fig.2c). Also, we observed a pronounced decrease in
CD24 protein levels upon ectopic miR-146a expression in SCC036, SCC131 and SCC084
cells (Fig. 2c). However, in SCC131 cells the levels of Oct4 and Involucrin did not show a
dose dependent change upon miR-146a over-expression, probably due to high endogenous
miR-146a in this cell line (Fig. 2c and Figure S2b). Loss of these markers upon knockdown
of miR-146a was also evident in SCC131 cells (Figure S2c). Expression of miR-146a
transcripts was validated by qRT-PCR (Figure S2d). Transfection of miR-146a containing
mutated seed sequence, however, did not alter the levels of stem-related proteins in a
statistically significant manner (Fig. 2d).These results demonstrate that miR-146a contributes
to enrichment of CSCs in OSCC through increased expression of stem cell markers.

3.3 MiR-146a activates Wnt/β-catenin pathway and promotes EMT in oral CSCs

Wnt, Notch and Hedgehog pathways are often involved in maintaining stem cell self-renewal
potential [34]. Accordingly, we observed increased expression of β-catenin and Cleaved
Notch1 in CD44highCD24low population of SCC25 and SCC131 cells (Figure S3a, b).While
significantly depleted in CD24highcells, β-catenin levels were also higher in CD24low
population of SCC084 cells which correlated well with the expression of stemness markers in
these cells(Fig.3a). To specifically envisage the role of CD24, we now compared the
CD44highCD24low population with the CD44highCD24high cells only. Interestingly we detected
nuclear localization of β-catenin in the CD44highCD24low population of SCC131 cells,
whereas it remained membrane bound in CD44highCD24highcells(Fig.3b). Transcriptional
activity of β-catenin was indicated by the relative wnt reporter activity in the respective cell
populations (Figure S3c). Interestingly, upon stable knockdown of β-catenin, not only the
stem cell markers were reduced but also a modest increase in CD24 expression was observed
(Figure S3d). These results suggest a possible cross talk between CD24 and β-catenin in
conferring stemness and EMT to these cells.
The clue that β-catenin level might influence stemness in OSCC cells led us to investigate
whether miR-146a regulates β-catenin. Indeed, over-expression of miR-146a lead to the dose
dependent increment in β-catenin levels with concordant decrease in E-cadherin (Fig.3c). It is
known that miR-146a targets the 3’UTR of Numb, a protein that promotes lysosomal
degradation of β-catenin and Cleaved Notch1 [35].We indeed, confirmed reduced levels of
Numb upon miR-146a over-expression along with stabilization of Cleaved Notch1(Figure
S3e). Conversely, inhibition of miR-146a activity lead to β-catenin degradation along with
the loss of Oct4 as expected (Fig.3d). Notably, we did not observe these changes upon mutant
miR-146a over-expression (Figure S3f). To emphasize the contribution of β-catenin in
miR-146a induced stemness, we transfected miR-146a in β-catenin shRNA expressing cells

and found no change in expression of CSC markers (Figure S3g) as compared to that of nonsilencing controls. Strikingly, the ability of anchorage independent growth induced by
miR-146a was also dependent on the expression of β-catenin (Figure S3h) suggesting its
tumorigenic role in OSCC.
To obtain clinical relationships among miR-146a, CD24 and β-catenin, we first checked the
correlation between miR-146a and CD24 expression across the NCI-60 cell lines and found it
to be significantly negatively correlated (Fig.3e). Moreover, examination of CD44high HNSCC
tumors from TCGA dataset revealed a positive correlation between miR-146a expression and
β-catenin/CD24 ratio (Fig. 3f). Further, the observed down-regulation of E-cadherin upon
miR-146a expression prompted us to address the miR-146a driven EMT phenomenon in
OSCC. Indeed, miR-146a was found to be significantly over-expressed in the mesenchymal
(MS) cell lines showing higher CD44 and lower CD24 expression[2], compared to the
epithelial (EP) cell lines of the NCI-60 panel[26](Fig.3g). In addition, the miR-146a
expression in TCGA tumor samples was negatively correlated with the E-cadherin to
Vimentin ratio (Fig.3h). Based on these observations, we propose that miR-146a induced
stemness and EMT in OSCC is mediated through lowering of CD24 followed by activation
of β-catenin.

3.4 MiR-146a targets CD24 in oral CSCs
We considered CD24 as a putative target of miR-146a through which it might impart
stemness in OSCC. Although, in silico identification of miRNA targets using the prediction
software did not reveal CD24 as the probable target, we did find matching of miR-146a seed
sequence in the CD24 3’UTR in miRANDA (Supplementary file 2). Despite one mismatch,
the maximum free energy of miRNA-mRNA binding was favorable enough for hybridization

and targeting (Fig. 4a). In Fig. 2c, we had already examined that CD24 expression was
significantly depleted upon miR-146a transfection in a dose dependent manner in SCC036,
SCC131 and SCC084 cells. Alongside, it was up-regulated upon inhibition of miR-146a in
SCC131 cells (Fig.4b). We also observed remarkable changes in CD24 transcripts in both
SCC131 and SCC084 upon modulation of miR-146a (Fig. 4c,d).To further confirm that
CD24 is a direct target of miR-146a, we co-transfected luciferase reporter vector containing
the 3’UTR fragment of CD24 gene with either miR-146a expressing vector or anti-miR-146a
in SCC131 cells. As shown in Fig.4e, f and g, miR-146a over-expression reduced the
luciferase activity of CD24 3’UTR, while miR-146a inhibitor elevated the same. On the
contrary, transfection with mutated mir-146a did not alter the CD24 3’UTR luciferase activity
significantly (Fig.4e, h). Thus, this data experimentally validates the ability of miR-146a to
directly target CD24 gene by binding to its 3’UTR. This justifies the involvement of
miR-146a in negative regulation of CD24 expression in oral cancer stem cells.

3.5 Mir-146a stabilizes β-catenin by down-regulating CD24
To get a mechanistic insight into the miR-146a mediated β-catenin stabilization, CD24 was
over-expressed in miR-146a over-expressing cells. Interestingly, CD24 not only abolished the
stemness markers but also the expression of β-catenin and CD44 (Fig.5a and Figure
S4a).This indicated that down-regulation of CD24 by miR-146a was instrumental in
maintaining high β-catenin levels and consequently the downstream stemness phenotype.
This was further exemplified as CD24 over-expression alone could lead to degradation of βcatenin protein and the associated stem cell markers, while the siRNA mediated knockdown
of CD24 showed an opposite effect (Fig.5b,c). Wnt target genes such as C-myc, CD44,
CCND1 were detected at conspicuous levels upon CD24 knockdown, whereas significantly

depleted upon CD24 over-expression in cells expressing miR-146a (Figure S4b, c). These
observations suggest an inverse correlation between CD24 and β-catenin signalling in OSCC
cells. It was further confirmed by the inhibition of miR-146a-induced β-catenin nuclear
mobilization upon ectopic expression of CD24 (Figure S4d). In addition, miR-146a driven
increased wnt reporter activity was found to be reduced upon CD24 over-expression (Fig.
S4e). To further investigate its downstream effect on stemness phenotype, we performed an in
vitro sphere-formation assay. We observed a considerably defective spheroid forming ability
of miR-146a transfected cells in the presence of CD24 (Fig.S4f). Together, these observations
suggest the possible contribution of CD24 in regulating Wnt pathway through β-catenin,
thereby affecting CSC-like traits.

3.6 Involvement of pAKT in CD24 mediated degradation of β-catenin
Next, to elucidate the cause of β-catenin reduction in the presence of CD24, we treated
SCC084 and SCC036 cells with MG132, and found β-catenin levels returned to that of untransfected controls (Fig.5d). This confirms that unlike Numb, CD24 degrades β-catenin in a
proteasomally dependent manner. The restored β-catenin also re-established the expression of
stem cell marker Oct4 irrespective of CD24 over-expression in both SCC036 and SCC084
cells (Fig.5d). E-cadherin levels, however, remained high in the presence of CD24,
irrespective of β-catenin stability (Fig.5d). Notably, CD24 did not affect Numb expression,
corroborating the independent participation of CD24 in regulating β-catenin (Figure S5a). To
gain mechanistic insights into the CD24 mediated β-catenin degradation, we speculated that
CD24 may lead to β-catenin destabilization via AKT-GSK-3β pathway[36, 37]. Towards this,
we did find that CD24 over-expression rescued the miR-146a mediated increase in pAKT
(Ser 473) activity (Fig.5e), although it remained stable during MG132 treatment (Figure
16 | P a g e

S5b). On the contrary, knockdown of CD24 in SCC036 increased pAKT and β-catenin levels
(Fig.5f). Moreover, pAKT was found to be accumulated in the CD44highCD24low fraction of
SCC25 cells thereby indicating its prior involvement in stemness (Figure S5c). In addition,
we observed significant depletion of β-catenin upon treatment with pAKT inhibitor
(LY294002) which again confirmed its regulation by miR-146a-CD24-pAKT loop (Fig.5g).
This was further supported by the soft agar tumorigenesis assays, which clearly showed that
CD24 over-expression or AKT inhibition, both rescued the miR-146a induced colony
formation in OSCC cells (Figure S5d). These cell line related observations was further
validated using mouse xenograft model. To check the effect of miR-146a on in-vivo tumor
formation, SCC084 cells harboring either an empty vector (SCC084/EV) or stably expressing
miR-146a (SCC084/miR-146a), were generated and the over-expression of miR-146a with
subsequent downregulation of CD24 was confirmed by both qRT-PCR and western blotting
(Figure S6a, b and c). SCC084/EV and SCC084/miR-146a cells were then introduced in the
right and left flanks of NOD/SCID mice respectively and allowed to form subcutaneous
tumor (Figure S6d and e). A significant increase in tumor volume and tumor weight was
observed in SCC084 xenografts stably over-expressing miR-146a suggesting enhanced
stemness potential of these cells. (Fig 6a and b). Further, to explore the effect of AKT
signaling on miR-146a induced tumor, mice with palpable tumors generated from SCC084/
EV and SCC084/miR-146a cells were treated with quercetin, a known PI3K/AKT signalling
pathway blocker [38] (Fig S6d and e). As expected, the tumor formation ability of miR-146a
cells was significantly attenuated in vivo upon administration of quercetin at regular intervals
(Fig 6a and b). While there was no effect of quercetin on miR-146a and CD24 levels, βcatenin over-expression in miR-146a tumors was compromised in presence of quercetin
(Figure S6f, g). In order to investigate the effect of CD24 upon the acquired stemness of

miR-146a expressing cancer cells in vivo, we examined xenograft tumors generated from
SCC084/miR-146a cells harboring CD24 expression construct (Figure S6a, b, c, h and i).
Notably, compared to the control tumors, volume and weight of CD24 expressing SCC084/
miR-146a tumors were not significantly (p-value = 0.7360) altered (Fig 6c and d) suggesting
loss of miR-146a driven stemness. Xenograft tumor subjected to qRT-PCR analysis confirms
the overexpression of miR-146a and CD24 in these cells while β-catenin is down-regulated
(Figure S6j and k). Collectively, these results indicate that CD24/AKT/β-catenin axis plays
an important role in miR-146a regulated CSC-mediated tumor growth in-vivo.

3.7 β-catenin transactivates miR-146a expression contributing to positive feedback loop
The upstream regulators of miRNAs have always been involved in feedback regulatory
mechanisms and are not much investigated. Analysis of miR-146a promoter has revealed the
binding sites for NF-κB, TCF4/β-catenin and STAT3, suggesting possible transcriptional
modulation[18, 39, 40].β-catenin enhances stemness features by driving the intracellular
levels of c-myc and other yamanaka factors (Fig.7a). This apparently contributes to the
enhanced tumorigenic properties in response to high miR-146a levels. Interestingly, we found
that β-catenin also promotes the expression of miR-146a, which might augment the stemness
acquiring ability of the cancer cells (Fig.7a). However, expression of miR-146a was
significantly reduced in the presence of both dnTCF4 and Numb which inhibits β-catenin
binding to the promoter and degrades it respectively (Fig.7b). Change in miR-146a promoter
activity under similar conditions suggests that β-catenin is involved in trans-activation of
miR-146a promoter (Figure S7a). We hypothesize that β-catenin mediated induction of
miR-146a contributes to β-catenin mediated CD24 reduction (Fig.7a). ChIP-qPCR assay
confirmed that β-catenin binds to miR-146a promoter in vivo (Fig.7c). Further, the

recruitment of β-catenin was found to be significantly enhanced in absence of CD24 (Fig.7c).
Moreover, miR-146a promoter activity was significantly increased in presence of miR-146a,
while reduced upon ectopic expression of CD24 (Fig. 7d). However, the constructs with
either mutated or deleted TCF4 binding sites showed no significant difference in promoter
activity (Figure S7b). This may be due to the alternating levels of β-catenin which shoots up
in miR-146a over-expression condition and gets depleted in presence of CD24. Transient
ChIP assays with the same luciferase constructs also confirmed that β-catenin indeed binds to
miR-146a promoter, which is impeded upon CD24 over-expression (Fig. 7e). These data
positively confirm the feedback activation loop by β-catenin that further trans-activates
miR-146a expression to shift the equilibrium towards CSC maintenance.

4 Discussion
Oral cancer progression has been largely attributed to both genetic and epigenetic
heterogeneity. Tumorigenic cells can arise from the non-tumorigenic cancer cells owing to
spontaneous conversion to a stem-like state[41]. The origin and plasticity of such cells, called
cancer stem cells (CSCs), have always been a matter of debate. Nevertheless, CSCs are
known to be responsible for chemo-resistance, tumor recurrence and metastasis. Detail
molecular characterization of CSCs is therefore of paramount importance for eliminating
them from its roots. CD24 has been routinely used with CD44 for the prospective isolation of
CSCs in colorectal, prostate and breast cancers [42]. Given the critical role of cellular
miRNAs in regulating CSC characteristics, current anticancer therapies have provided an
important avenue towards exploiting them for effective cellular targeting[43]. Targeting of
CD44 by miRNAs in NSCLC, prostate and ovarian cancer has been previously demonstrated

to attenuate stemness[14, 44, 45]. However, miRNA mediated regulation of CD24 remains to
be determined.
Consistent with its oncogenic functions, miR-146a promotes symmetric division of
colorectal CSCs, thereby promoting stemness [18]. The miRNA is also involved in
development of melanoma by activating Notch1 signaling leading to drug resistance [46].
However, little is known about its role in regulating expression of CSC-related CD markers
in oral cancer. In the present study, we detected significantly higher expression of miR-146a
in CD44highCD24low population of OSCC cell lines as well as in tumor specimens. We
therefore investigated whether miR-146a expression maintains CSC traits or miR-146a
accumulation is a consequence of induced stemness. Notably, ectopic expression of
miR-146a induce CSC-phenotype i.e. CD44highCD24low population together with increased βcatenin activity in OSCC cell lines. CD44 is a well-known transcriptional target of β-catenin
along with C-myc and CCND1[18], which clearly indicates a molecular link with miR-146a
induced CD44 expression. However, the effect of miR-146a upon CD24 expression under
these conditions was particularly intriguing. Hence, we examined whether CD24 is a direct
target of miR-146a and experimentally confirmed that miR-146a binds to the 3’UTR of
CD24 thereby repressing it post-transcriptionally. Loss of E-cadherin upon miR-146a overexpression and positive correlation with the mesenchymal marker vimentin was also evident.
Hence, in addition to its novel role in acquiring stemness, our results re-confirmed miR-146a
as a key regulator of EMT[47].
Wnt/β-catenin has shown great potential for CSC-targeting in cancer[34]. Our study
shows that CSC characteristics in OSCC is attributed to the elevated β-catenin along with
depleted CD24. The anticipation that CD24 leads to proteasomal degradation of β-catenin
was found to be true and apparently it also abolished the β-catenin mediated stemness. This is

a novel functional interaction through which miR-146a regulates β-catenin in oral cancer
cells. Our study, thus points towards the tumor-suppressor functions of CD24, supporting our
previous observation of reduced CD24 expression in oral tumors compared to the normal
tissue (our own data) [2]. Although growth inhibition was achieved by knocking down CD24
in colorectal and pancreatic cancer[48], no such effects were observed in oral cancer. Perhaps
the variable cell-type specific distribution pattern underlies the paradoxical role of CD24 in
oral cancer[49]. Activated PI3K-AKT pathway is one of the primary events in
carcinogenesis[50]. Its contribution to stem cell self-renewal and proliferation has also been
extensively studied[51]. Further, signaling pathways like WNT are often linked with AKT
activation that eventually contribute to expression of stem cells-related factors, chemoresistance genes, and CSC markers[50, 52]. Here we show that CD24, the cell surface CSC
marker lie upstream of AKT protein, similar to that of TWIST and FOXO transcription
factors which is also known to inhibit CD24[36, 53-55]. However, the precise mechanism by
which expression/stability of AKT protein is regulated by CD24 is unknown.CD24 has been
shown to possibly modulate phospho-AKT levels [56], which might affect its downstream
targets such as GSK-3β[37]. Activated GSK-3β mediates phosphorylation and ubiquitination
of β-catenin, thereby leading to its degradation[37]. Therefore, it was incumbent on us to ask
whether CD24 induce AKT and subsequently affect β-catenin stability in miR-146a induced
oral CSCs. Indeed, MG132 treatment was found to re-stabilize β-catenin by relieving pAKT
inhibition in cells over-expressing CD24. Moreover, direct AKT inhibition in the miR-146a
transfected cells depleted β-catenin, irrespective of CD24 level suggesting AKT is
downstream of CD24. Thus, we logically elucidated the molecular mechanism underlying
CD24 mediated β-catenin degradation in oral cancer cells. We have specifically shown that
CD24 over-expression decrease levels of phospho-AKT leading to β-catenin instability. The

role of miR-146a/CD24/AKT/β-catenin axis in maintaining the oral cancer stem cell
populations is thus mechanistically evident. Studies from in-vivo tumor model system also
confirms that these molecular mechanisms directly affect tumorigenesis.
Further, the recruitment of β-catenin onto miR-146a promoter was found to be
negatively regulated by CD24 which might contribute to the fine tuning of stemness. These
results clearly establish a cross-regulatory network between miR-146a and β-catenin,
governed by a stem-related marker, CD24 in OSCC cells. Our study thus provides strong
evidences which suggest that miR-146a promotes CSC characteristics of oral cancer cells by
down-regulating CD24. Repression of CD24 leads to AKT stabilization followed by
activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Based on our observation, we propose a model
wherein, AKT activity is an important determinant of miR-146a dependent β-catenin
signaling (Fig.8). It should be noted, however, that β-catenin mediated CSC induction might
be due to the induction of miR-146a expression or vice-versa. Taken together, the present
study highlights a novel mechanism of miR-146a mediated self-renewal capacity of Oral
CSCs that may have a prognostic or therapeutic value in oral cancer.

Fig.8. Model –schematic representation of transient inter-conversions between stem and nonstem oral cancer cells. Cancer stem cell induction may be triggered with over-expression of
miR-146a that targets CD24 and leads to β-catenin protein stabilization via AKT activation.
Wnt signalling intermediates promote stem-like de-differentiated state in the tumor cells.
Accumulation of β-catenin might further drive miR-146a expression and amplify the
stemness characteristics. Stochastic intra-cellular signals may induce differentiation, probably
by aberrant activation of CD24. This leads to decline in pAKT levels and hence proteasomal
degradation of β-catenin with subsequent loss of miR-146a.
