Abstract
The origin of eukaryotes is one of evolution's most important transitions, yet it is still poorly
understood. Evidence for how it occurred should be preserved in eukaryotic genomes. Based on
phylogenetic trees from ribosomal RNA and ribosomal proteins, eukaryotes are typically depicted
as branching together with or within archaea. This ribosomal affiliation is widely interpreted as
evidence for an archaeal origin of eukaryotes. However, the extent to which the archaeal ancestry
of genes for the cytosolic ribosomes of eukaryotic cells is representative for the rest of the
eukaryotic genome is unknown. Here we have clustered 19,050,992 protein sequences from 5,443
bacteria and 212 archaea with 3,420,731 protein sequences from 150 eukaryotes spanning six
eukaryotic supergroups to identify genes that link eukaryotes exclusively to bacteria and archaea
respectively. By downsampling the bacterial sample we obtain estimates for the bacterial and
archaeal proportions of genes among 150 eukaryotic genomes. Eukaryotic genomes possess a
bacterial majority of genes. On average, eukaryotic genes are 56% bacterial in origin. The majority
drops to 53% in eukaryotes that never possessed plastids, and increases to 61% in photosynthetic
eukaryotic lineages, where the cyanobacterial ancestor of plastids contributed additional genes to
the eukaryotic genome, reaching 67% in higher plants. Intracellular parasites, which undergo
reductive evolution in adaptation to the nutrient rich environment of the cells that they infect,
relinquish bacterial genes for metabolic processes. In the current sample, this process of adaptive
gene loss is most pronounced in the human parasite Encephalitozoon intestinalis with 86%
archaeal and 14% bacterial derived genes. The most bacterial eukaryote genome sampled is rice,
with 67% bacterial and 33% archaeal genes. The functional dichotomy, initially described for yeast,
of archaeal genes being involved in genetic information processing and bacterial genes being
involved in metabolic processes is conserved across all eukaryotic supergroups.

Introduction
Biologists recognize three kinds of cells in nature: bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. The bacteria
and archaea are prokaryotic in organization, having generally small cells on the order of 0.5–5
microns in size and ribosomes that translate nascent mRNA molecules as they are synthesized on
DNA (cotranscriptional translation) [1]. Eukaryotic cells are generally much larger in size, more
complex in organization and have larger genomes possessing introns that are removed (spliced)
from the mRNA on spliceosomes [2]. Eukaryotic cells always harbor a system of internal
membranes [3,4] that form the endoplasmic reticulum and the cell nucleus, where splicing takes

place [5]. Furthermore, eukaryotes typically possess double membrane bounded bioenergetic
organelles, mitochondria, which were present in the eukaryote common ancestor (LECA) [6,7], but
have undergone severe reduction in some lineages [8,9]. In terms of timing during Earth history, it
is generally agreed that the first forms of life on Earth were prokaryotes, with isotopic evidence for
the existence of bacterial and archaeal metabolic processes tracing back to rocks 3.5 billion years
of age [10,11] or older [12]. The microfossil record indicates that eukaryotes arose later, about 1.4
to 1.6 billion years ago [13], hence that eukaryotes arose from prokaryotes. Though eukaryotes are
younger than prokaryotes, the nature of their phylogenetic relationship(s) to bacteria and archaea
remains debated because of differing views about the evolutionary origin of eukaryotic cells.
In the traditional three domain tree of life, eukaryotes are seen as a sister group to archaea [14–
16] (Fig. 1a). In newer two-domain trees, eukaryotes are viewed as branching from within the
archaea [17,18] (Fig 1b). In both the two domain and the three domain hypotheses, this is often
seen as evidence for "an archaeal origin" of eukaryotes [17,18] (Fig. 1a,b). Germane to an archaeal
origin is the view that eukaryotes are archaea that became more complex by gradualist evolutionary
processes such as point mutation and gene duplication [19,20]. Countering that view are two sets
of observations relating to symbiogenesis (origin through symbiosis) for eukaryotes (Fig. 1c,d).
First, the archaea that branch closest to eukaryotes in the most recent phylogenies are very small
in size (0.5 µm), they lack any semblance of eukaryote-like cellular complexity, and they live in
obligate association with bacteria [21], clearly implicating symbiosis [21] rather than point mutation
as the driving force at the origin of the eukaryotic clade (Fig. 1c). Second, and with a longer history
in the literature, are the findings that mitochondria trace to the eukaryote common ancestor [22,23]
and that many genes in eukaryote genomes trace to gene transfers from endosymbiotic organelles
[24,25]. A symbiogenic origin of eukaryotes would run counter to one of the key goals of
phylogenetics, namely to place eukaryotes in a natural system of phylogenetic classification where
all groups are named according to their position in a bifurcating tree. If eukaryotes arose via
symbiosis of an archaeon (the host) and a bacterium (the mitochondrion), then eukaryotes would
reside simultaneously on both the archaeal and the bacterial branches in phylogenetic schemes
[26,27], whereby plants and algae that stem from secondary symbioses [28] would reside on
recurrently anastomosing branches as in Fig. 1d.
Even though it is uncontested that symbiotic mergers lie at the root of modern eukaryotic groups
via the single origin of mitochondria, plants via the single origin of plastids, and at least three groups
of algae with complex plastids via secondary symbiosis [29], anastomosing structures such as
those depicted in Fig. 1c and Fig. 1d do not mesh well with established principles of phylogenetic
classification, because the classification of groups that arise by symbiosis is not unique. One could

rightly argue that plants are descended from cyanobacteria, which is in part true because many
genes in plants were acquired from the cyanobacterial antecedent of plastids [30]. Or one could
save phylogenetic classification of eukaryotes from symbiogenic corruption by a democratic
argument that eukaryotes are, by majority, archaeal based on the assumption that their genomes
contain a majority of archaeal genes, making them archaea in the classificatory sense.
But what if eukaryotes are actually bacteria in terms of their genomic majority? The trees that
molecular phylogeneticists use to classify eukaryotes are based on rRNA or proteins associated
with ribosomes — cytosolic ribosomes in the case of eukaryotes. Ribosomes make up about 40%
of a prokaryotic cell's substance by dry weight, so they certainly are important for the object of
classification. No one would doubt that eukaryotes have archaeal ribosomes in their cytosol.
Archaeal ribosomes in the cytosol could however equally be the result of a gradualist origin of
eukaryotes from archaea [31,32] or symbiogenesis involving an archaeal host for the origin of
mitochondria [33,34]. Ribosomes only comprise about 50 proteins and three RNAs, while the
proteins used for phylogenetic classification are only about 30 in number, or roughly 1% of an
average prokaryotic genome [35]. The other 99% of the genome are more difficult to analyze,
bringing us back to the question: At the level of whole genomes, are eukaryotes fundamentally
archaeal?
Since the availability of complete genome sequences there have been investigations to determine
the proportion of archaeal and bacterial genes in eukaryotic genomes. Such an undertaking is
straightforward for an individual eukaryotic genome, and previous investigations have focused on
yeast [36,37]. These indicated that yeast harbors an excess of bacterial genes relative to archaeal
genes. Subsequent genome-wide phylogenetic analyses including plants, animals, and fungi
[38,39], two eukaryotic groups [40] or six eukaryotic supergroups [41] fell short of reporting
estimates for the proportion of genes in eukaryotic genomes that stem from bacteria and archaea
respectively, whereby all previous estimates have been limited by the small archaeal sample of
sequenced genomes for comparison. Here we have clustered genes from sequenced genomes of
150 eukaryotes, 5,443 bacteria and 212 archaea. By normalizing for the large bacterial sample
through downsampling, we obtain estimates for the proportion of genes in each eukaryote genome
that identify prokaryotic homologues, but that only occur in archaea or bacteria respectively.

Results and Discussion
Using the MCL algorithm, we generated clusters for 19,050,992 protein sequences from 5,443
bacteria and 212 archaea with 3,420,731 protein sequences from 150 eukaryotes (see Methods)
(Suppl. Table 1a-c) spanning six eukaryotic supergroups (Fig. 2a). This yielded 2,587 eukaryoteprokaryote clusters (EPC), 1,853 of which contained only eukaryotes and bacteria, 515 of which
contained only eukaryotes and archaea. Among the 2,587 EPC clusters, 8% (219) contained
sequences from at least two eukaryotes and at least five prokaryotes spanning bacteria and
archaea (see Suppl. Table 2), which were not considered further for our estimates because here
we sought estimates where the decision regarding bacterial or archaeal origin was independent of
phylogenetic inference, which is possible for 92% of eukaryotic clusters that contain prokaryotic
sequences. All sequences had unique cluster assignments, no sequences occurred in more than
one cluster. That 1,853 clusters contained only eukaryotes and bacteria while 515 contained only
eukaryotes and archaea appears to suggest a 3.6-fold excess of bacterial genes in eukaryotes, but
bacterial genes are 25-fold more abundant in the data. For those genes that each eukaryote shares
with prokaryotes, we estimated the proportion and number of genes having homologues only in
archaea and only in bacteria respectively by downsampling the 25-fold excess of bacterial genomes
in the sample in 1,000 subsamples of 212 bacteria and 212 archaea.
The proportion of bacterial and archaeal genes for each eukaryote is shown in Fig. 2b. Overall,
44% of eukaryotic sequences are archaeal in origin and 56% are bacterial. Across 150 genomes,
eukaryotes possess 12% more bacterial genes than archaeal genes. There are evident group
specific differences (Fig. 2b). If we look only at organisms that never harbored a plastid, the excess
of bacteria genes drops from 56% to 53%. If we look only at groups that possess plastids the
proportions of bacterial homologues increases to 61% vs. 39% archaeal (Table 1, Suppl. Table 3).
Note that our estimates are based on the number of clusters, meaning that gene duplications do
not figure into the estimates. A bacterial derived gene that was amplified by duplication to 100
copies in each land plant genome is counted as one bacterial derived gene. This is seen in Fig. 2
for Trichomonas, where a large number on gene families have expanded in the Trichomonas
lineage [42], reflected in a conspicuously large proteome size (Fig. 2d), but a similar number of
clusters (Fig. 2e) as neighboring taxa.
The proportions for different eukaryotic groups is shown in Table 1. Land plants have the highest
proportion of bacterial derived genes at 67%, or a 2:1 ratio of bacterial genes relative to archaeal.
The eukaryote with the highest proportion of bacterial genes in our sample is rice, with 67.1%
bacterial and 32.9% archaeal genes. The higher proportion of bacterial genes in plastid containing

eukaryotes relative to other groups corresponds with the origin of the plastid and gene transfers to
the nucleus [41]. The eukaryote with the highest proportion of archaeal genes in our sample are
the human parasite Encephalitozoon intestinalis and the rabbit parasite Encephalitozoon cuniculi,
with 86% archaeal and 14% bacterial derived genes. Parasitic eukaryotes have the largest
proportions of archaeal genes, but not by novel acquisitions, rather by having lost large numbers
of bacterial genes as a result of reductive evolution in adaptation to nutrient rich environments. This
is evident in Fig. 2c, where the numbers of archaeal and bacterial genes per genome are shown.
Parasites, with their reduced genomes, such as Giardia lamblia, Trichomonas vaginalis, or
Encephalitozoon species appear more archaeal. The number of archaeal, or bacterial genes in an
organism does not correlate with genome size (Suppl. Fig. 1, Pearson correlation coefficient:
archaeal r2 = 0.38, bacterial r2 = 0.33).
Opisthokonts generally have a more even distribution of bacterial and archaeal homologs in their
genomes but are still slightly more bacterial (54%, Table 1 and Suppl. Table 3). The black and grey
dots in Fig. 2a indicate organisms that possess reduced forms of mitochondria, hydrogenosomes
(black) or mitosomes (grey). The ten most archaeal or bacterial organisms are indicated by a red
or blue rectangle, respectively. The most archaeal eukaryotes are all parasites (highlighted in red)
and have undergone reductive evolution, also with respect to their mitochondria, which are often
reduced to mitosomes (Fig. 2a). Nine of the ten most bacterial organisms in the sample are plants
(highlighted in green) with the fifth most bacterial organism being one of the only two Hacrobia in
the dataset.
The functional distinction that eukaryotic genes involved in the eukaryotic genetic apparatus and
information processing tend to reflect an archaeal origin while genes involved in eukaryotic
biochemical and metabolic processes tend to reflect bacterial origins [43,44] has been borne out
for yeast [36,37] and small genome samples [39,40]. The distributions of eukaryotic genes per
genome that have archaeal or bacterial homologs across the respective KEGG function category
at the first level (metabolism, genetic information processing, environmental information
processing, cellular processes, and organismal systems) are shown in Fig. 3. The category human
diseases is not shown, as only very few proteins in the eukaryote-prokaryote clusters were so
annotated. The categories genetic information processing (information) and metabolism account
for 90% of all annotated eukaryotic sequences in the EPCs (Suppl. Table 4). In the category
metabolism, 67.6% of eukaryotic genes are bacterial while 76.9% of EPCs involved in information

are archaeal. The distinction between informational and metabolic genes first described for yeast
appears to be valid across all eukaryotic genomes.
The distribution of the genes in the 2,587 EPCs across genomes for six supergroups is depicted in
Fig. 4. The order of eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms (rows) can be found in Suppl. Table 5.
Block A represents only Archaeplastida, block B depicts genes found in Archaeplastida and SAR,
block C encompasses all genes that are distributed across the three taxa that contain plastids;
Archaeplastida, SAR, and Hacrobia. The lower part of the figure shows the prokaryotic homologous
genes. Cyanobacterial genes are especially densely distributed across blocks A–C. Genes that are
predominantly mitochondrion- or host-related are indicated in block D and E. Eukaryotic genes that
are universally distributed across the six supergroups are mainly archaeal in origin (block D).
Especially organisms with reduced genomes such as parasites (marked with asterisks on the right),
have lost genes associated with metabolism, leaving them mainly archaeal (Fig. 4). In the wake of
symbiogenic mergers, which are very rare in evolution, gene loss sets in, whereby gene loss is
very common in eukaryote genome evolution, one of its main underlying themes [41,45].
The estimates we obtain are based on a sample of genes that meet the clustering thresholds
employed here. Many eukaryotic genes are inventions of the eukaryotic lineage in terms of domain
structure and sequence identity. Those genes either arose in eukaryotes de novo from noncoding
DNA, or they arose through sequence divergence, recombination, and duplication involving
preexisting coding sequences, the bacterial and archaeal components of which should reflect that
demonstrable in the conserved fraction of genes analyzed here. It is possible that archaeal genes
and domains are more prone to recombination and rapid sequence divergence than bacterial
domains are, but the converse could also be true and there is no a priori evidence to indicate that
either assumption applies across eukaryotic supergroups. Hence with some caution, our estimates,
which are based on the conserved fraction of sequences only, should in principle apply for the
archaeal and bacterial components of the genome as a whole.

Conclusion
Using a sample of 5,655 prokaryotic and 150 eukaryotic genomes and downsampling procedures
to correct for the overabundance of bacterial genomes versus archaeal genomes for comparisons,
we have obtained estimates for the proportion of archaeal and bacterial genes per genome in
eukaryotes based on gene distributions. We found that the members of six eukaryotic supergroups
possess a majority of bacterial genes over archaeal genes. If eukaryotes were to be classified by
genome based democratic principle, they would be have to be grouped with bacteria, not archaea.
The excess of bacterial genes disappears in the genomes of intracellular parasites with highly
reduced genomes, because the bacterial genes in eukaryotes underpin metabolic functions that
can be replaced by metabolites present in the nutrient rich cytosol of the eukaryotic cells that
parasites infect. The functions of the ribosome and genetic information processing cannot be
replaced by nutrients, hence reductive genome evolution in parasites leads to preferential loss of
bacterial genes and leaves archaeal genes remaining. In photosynthetic eukaryote lineages, the
genetic contribution of plastids to the collection of nuclear genomes is evident in our analyses, both
in lineages with primary plastids descended directly from cyanobacteria and in lineages with
plastids of secondary symbiotic origin. The available sample of archaeal genomes is still limiting
for comparisons of the kind presented here.
As improved culturing and sequencing of complete archaeal genomes progresses, new lineages
are being characterized at the level of scanning electron microscopy that branch, in ribosomal trees,
as sisters to the host lineage at eukaryote origin [21]. These archaea are however not complex like
eukaryotes, rather they are prokaryotic in size and shape and unmistakably prokaryotic in
organization [21]. That is, the closer microbiologists hone in on the host lineage for the origin of
mitochondria, the steeper the evolutionary grade between prokaryotes and eukaryotes becomes,
in agreement with the predictions of symbiotic theory [21] (Fig. 5) and in contrast to the expectations
of gradualist theories for eukaryote origin [33]. At the same time, the analyses presented here
uncover a bacterial majority of genes in eukaryotic genomes, a majority that traces to the eukaryote
common ancestor [41], which is also in line with the predictions of symbiotic theory. The most likely
biological source of the bacterial majority of genes in the eukaryote common ancestor is the
mitochondrial endosymbiont [41]. Genomes record their own history. Eukaryotic genomes testify to
the role of endosymbiosis in evolution.

Methods
Sequence clustering. A total of 19,050,992 protein sequences from 5,655 complete prokaryotic
genomes were downloaded from the NCBI RefSeq genomes database Release 78, September
2016 [46], encompassing 5,443 bacteria and 212 archaea (Suppl. Table 1a, 1b). For eukaryotes
3,420,731 protein sequences from 150 sequenced genomes covering a phylogenetically diverse
sample were downloaded from NCBI RefSeq [46], Ensembl Protists [47], JGI [48], and GenBank
[49] (Suppl. Table 1a, 1c) as appropriate. Protein sequences from the three domains were each
clustered separately and homologous clusters were combined as described previously [41,50]. The
reciprocal best BLAST hits (rBBH) [51] of an all-vs-all BLAST (v. 2.5.0) [52] were calculated for
each domain (cut-off: expectation (E) value ≤ 1e-10). Pairwise global sequence identities were then
generated for each sequence pair with the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm using the program
‘needle’ of the EMBOSS package v. 6.6.0.0 [53] with a global identity cut-off ≥ 25% for bacterial
and archaeal sequence pairs and ≥ 40% global identity for eukaryotic sequence pairs. Protein
families were reconstructed applying the domain-specific rBBH to the Markov Chain clustering
algorithm (MCL) v. 12-068 [54] on the basis of the global pairwise sequence identities, respectively.
Due to the large bacterial dataset, pruning parameters of MCL were adjusted until no relevant
split/join distance between consecutive clusterings was calculated by the ‘clm dist’ application of
the MCL program family (-P 180,000 -S 19,800 -R 25,200). MCL default settings were applied for
the archaeal and eukaryotic protein clustering. This yielded 16,875 archaeal protein families
(422,054 sequences) and 214,519 bacterial protein families (17,384,437 sequences) with at least
five sequences each and 239,813 eukaryotic protein families (1,545,316 sequences) with
sequences present in at least two species (Suppl. Table 6). To combine eukaryotic clusters with
bacterial or archaeal clusters, the reciprocal best cluster approach [41] was applied with 50% besthit correspondence and 30% BLAST local pairwise sequence identity of the inter-domain hits
between eukaryote and prokaryote sequences. Eukaryotic clusters having homologues in both
bacterial and archaeal clusters were merged with their prokaryotic homologues as described [41].
The cluster merging procedure left 752 eukaryotic clusters that had ambiguous (multiple)
prokaryote cluster assignment, these were excluded from further analysis and 236,474 eukaryote
clusters connected to no homologous prokaryotic cluster (eukaryote-specific, ESC, Suppl. Table 2)
at the cut-offs employed here.
Assignment of bacterial or archaeal origin. Because the number of prokaryotic sequences
clustered was large, the 2,368 EPCs that were assigned one bacterial or one archaeal cluster
exclusively were rechecked for homologs from the remaining prokaryotic domain at the E value
≤ 1e-10, global identity ≥ 25% threshold. The 266 cases so detected were excluded from bacterial-

archaeal origin assignment, yielding 2,102 EPCs (Suppl. Table 2, indicated by asterisks). The
clusters generated from rBBH (E value ≤ 1e-10, global identity ≥ 25%) of all-vs-all BLAST of the
19,050,992 prokaryotic protein sequences are provided as supplementary material (Suppl. Table
6). Downsampling to adjust for the overrepresentation of bacterial strains in the prokaryotic dataset
compared to the number of archaeal organisms was performed by generating 1,000 datasets with
212 bacterial taxa selected randomly according to the distribution of genera in the whole dataset
(Suppl. Table 7). The sequences of the examined 212 archaeal and bacterial taxa were located in
the 2,102 EPCs and each eukaryotic organism in the identified clusters was assigned to ‘bacterial’,
or ‘archaeal’ depending on the domain of the prokaryotic cluster in the EPC. Each eukaryotic
genome was only counted once per EPC and assigned the respective prokaryotic label to prevent
overrepresentation of duplication rich organisms. This procedure was performed for all 1,000
downsized bacterial datasets for each EPC, the mean of 1,000 samples was scored (Suppl.
Table 3).
Cluster annotation. Protein annotation information according to the BRITE (Biomolecular
Reaction pathways for Information Transfer and Expression) hierarchy was downloaded from the
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG v. September 2017) website [55], including
protein sequences and their assigned function according to the KO numbers (Suppl. Table 8). The
sequences of each protein family from the 2,587 EPCs were locally aligned with ‘blastp’ to the
KEGG database to identify the annotation for each protein. In order to assign each protein to a
KEGG function, only the best blast hit of the given protein with an E value ≤ 1e-10 and alignment
coverage of 80% was selected. After assigning a function based on the KO numbers of KEGG for
each protein in the EPCs, the majority rule was applied to identify the function for each cluster. The
occurrence of the function of each protein was added and the most prevalent function was assigned
for each cluster (Suppl. Table 4). Poorly characterized sequences or sequences with no assigned
function were ignored, resulting in 1,836 clusters with annotations.
Presence and absence of EPCs across genomes. Presence of absence of genes in a cluster for
each genome were plotted as a 2,587 x 5,805 binary matrix, rows were sorted taxonomically,
columns were sorted in ascending order left to right according to density of distribution within
eukaryotic groups. Hacrobia and SAR were treated as a eukaryotic group for clusters they shared
with Archaeplastida only; these clusters reflect secondary symbioses [41].

Figure 2. Bacterial and archaeal genes in eukaryotic genomes. Protein sequences from 150
eukaryotic genomes and 5,655 prokaryotic genomes (5,433 bacteria and 212 archaea) were
clustered into eukaryote-prokaryote clusters (EPC) using the MCL algorithm [54] as described [41].
To account for overrepresentation of bacterial sequences in the clusters, bacterial genomes were
downsampled in 1,000 datasets of 212 randomly selected bacterial organisms, the means were
plotted. The eukaryotic sequences in the EPCs that cluster exclusively with bacterial or archaeal
homologues were labelled bacterial (blue) or archaeal (red) accordingly. a.) Eukaryotic lineages
and genomes were grouped by taxonomy. Numbers next to the species name on the left side
indicate the ten most bacterial (blue) and archaeal (red) genomes, respectively. b.) The avg.
relative proportion of bacterial and archaeal genes per genome. c.) The number of eukaryotic
clusters with bacterial or archaeal homologs is shown. d.) The proteome size for the genome. e.)
The sum of all eukaryotic sequences in the eukaryote-prokaryote clusters. Taxonomic groups are
labelled on the far right panel. (Arc. – Archaeplastida, Exc. – Excavata, Hac. – Hacrobia, Myc. –
Mycetozoa, Opi. – Opisthokonts). Highlighted in green is the branch with the taxons of plants and
green algae, parasites are highlighted in red. The black dots indicate organisms with
hydrogenosomes, the grey dot indicates organisms with mitosomes.

Figure 3: Functional categories. Protein sequences from 150 eukaryotic genomes and 5,655
prokaryotic genomes were clustered into 2,587 eukaryote-prokaryote clusters (EPC) [41]. Sorted
according to a reference tree for eukaryotic lineages generated from the literature and taxonomic
groups are labelled. The red bars indicate eukaryotic gene families that are archaeal in origin, blue
indicates a bacterial origin of the gene family. Functional annotations according to the KEGG BRITE
hierarchy on the level A was assigned for each EPC, identifying the function for each sequence in
the protein cluster by performing a protein blast against the KEGG database and then applying the
most prevalent function per protein family. Only the categories ‘Genetic Information Processing’
(Gen.), ‘Metabolism’ (Met.), ‘Environmental Information Processing’ (Env.), ‘Cellular Processes’
(Cell.), and ‘Organismal Systems’ (Sys.) are depicted, as the label ‘Human Diseases’ was hardly
represented. Highlighted in green is the branch uniting land plants and green algae; the black and
gray dots indicate organisms with hydrogenosomes or mitosomes, respectively.

Figure 4: Gene sharing matrix. Each black tick represents the presence of a gene in the
respective taxon. First, the 2,587 EPCs (x axis) were sorted according to their distribution across
the six eukaryotic supergroups with the photosynthetic lineages on the left (block A–C). Host- or
mitochondrion-related genes distributed across the six supergroups are depicted in block E.
Clusters with mostly archaeal homologs are indicated in block D. (Chl. – Chloroplastida, Rho. –

Figure 5: Bacterial and archaeal contributions to eukaryotes. Schematic representation of
eukaryote origin involving an archaeal host and a mitochondrial symbiont that transforms the host
via gene transfer from the endosymbiont [21,43]. The model combines elements of different
proposals: bacterial outer membrane vesicles at the origin of the eukaryotic endomembrane system
[4]; archaeal outer membrane vesicles at the origin of host membrane protrusions enabling
endosymbiosis without phagocytosis [21]; a syncytial eukaryote common ancestor [56]; eukaryote
origin starting an archaeal host and a bacterial symbiont brought into physical symbiotic interaction
by anaerobic syntrophic interactions [21,43]; a combination of information (host) plus metabolism
and energy (symbiont) [26,34] at eukaryote origin.
