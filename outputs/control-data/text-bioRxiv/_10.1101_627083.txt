Abstract
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) etiology is a complex mixture of genetic and

15

environmental factors, the relative contributions of which varies across patients. Despite

16

complex etiology, researchers observe consistent neurodevelopmental features in ASD

17

patients, notably atypical forebrain cortical development. Growth factors, cytokines, and

18

chemokines are important mediators of forebrain cortical development, but have not been

19

thoroughly examined in brain tissues from individuals with autism. Here, we performed an

20

integrative analysis of RNA and protein expression using frontopolar cortex tissues dissected

21

from individuals with ASD and controls, hypothesizing that ASD patients will exhibit aberrant

22

expression of growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines critical for neurodevelopment. We

23

performed group-wise comparisons of RNA expression via RNA-Seq and growth factor,

24

cytokine, and chemokine expression via multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

25

(ELISA). We also analyzed single cell sequencing data from the frontopolar cortex of typically

26

developed individuals to identify cell types that express the growth factors we found differentially

27

expressed in ASD. Our RNA-Seq analysis revealed 11 differentially expressed genes in ASD

28

versus control brains, the most significant of which encodes for vascular endothelial growth

29

factor (VEGF-A). Both RNA and protein levels of VEGF-A were upregulated in ASD brains. Our

30

single cell analysis revealed that VEGF is expressed primarily by non-neuronal cells. We also

31

found that the differentially expressed genes from our RNA-Seq analysis are enriched in

32

microglia. The increased VEGF-A expression we observed in ASD, coupled with the enrichment

33

of differentially expressed genes in microglia, begs the question of the role VEGF-A is playing in

34

ASD. Microglia activation, as indicated by our RNA-Seq results, and the VEGF-A isoform

35

expression we see in the ASD cortex, leads us to conclude that VEGF-A is playing a pro-

36

inflammatory role, perhaps with unwanted long-term consequences for neurodevelopment.

Introduction

38

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) constitute a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders

39

defined clinically by difficulties in socialization, restricted or repetitive behaviors, and language

40

delays, with childhood onset. ASD can be accompanied by concomitant symptoms including

41

intellectual disability, catatonia, seizures, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and

42

gastrointestinal dysfunction [1]. The cause of ASD is complex and involves both genetic and

43

environmental risk factors.

44

The diagnostic clinical signs of ASD are preceded by many other phenotypic changes,

45

including abnormal brain overgrowth in multiple brain regions. The frontal cortex, which is

46

involved in higher-order social, emotional, communicative, and cognitive functions is implicated

47

amongst these overgrowth regions [2,3] and exhibits abnormal laminar structure [4].

48

Functionally, the anterior frontal cortex (frontopolar cortex; Brodmann Area 10 – BA10) in

49

individuals with ASD exhibits altered interhemispheric connectivity, which correlates with social

50

deficits [5]. Others have found changes in temporal dynamics of resting state activity between

51

the frontopolar cortex and other brain regions that correlate with attention deficits in ASD [6].

52

The abundance of evidence implicating the frontal cortex in ASD forms the basis of a unifying

53

theory of ASD etiology [7], making this brain region an important focus for molecular and genetic

54

analysis.

55

Genetic studies have started to unravel the molecular basis of autism. Genome wide

56

associations [8] and whole-exome sequencing [9-11] reveal hundreds of rare and common

57

inherited and de novo variants that contribute to autism risk. These variants often implicate

58

processes related to neurodevelopment and neuronal function [8,12-14]. Neuroglial are critical

59

for typical neural and synaptic development and modulating neuroinflammation, placing them

60

central to the notable dysfunctions in ASD [15]. Genomic studies show that glial cell-mediated

61

neuroinflammation is upregulated in the brains of individuals with ASD [16-18]. With respect to

62

the frontal cortex, epigenetic changes in ASD occur adjacent to genes responsible for immune

63

functions and synaptic maturation [19,20]. Increased pro-inflammatory factors are also found in

64

peripheral blood [21,22] and brains from ASD patients [23]. Given these known relationships

65

between neuroinflammation, neurodevelopment, and ASD, further understanding how these

66

factors interact to underlie ASD etiology could lead to novel interventions that prevent or abate

67

atypical neurodevelopment.

68

Several growth factors, secreted from both neurons and glial cells, play indispensable

69

roles in shaping the brain [24]. VEGF-A promotes neuronal survival, axonal outgrowth, long-

70

term potentiation, and learning [25,26]. However, VEGF-A signaling from reactive astrocytes

71

can also drive vascular permeability and central nervous system (CNS) damage in acute

72

inflammatory lesions [27]. Factors such as oxidative stress can result in enhanced glial

73

expression of VEGF-A [28]. Serum, plasma, and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) level of VEGF-A,

74

VEGF receptors, and numerous other cytokines and chemokines are altered in patients with

75

severe autism [29-32]. However, the significance of these finding when they occur in the

76

periphery, as it relates to neurodevelopment, is unclear.

77

Given the apparent associations between cytokine and chemokine signaling,

78

neurodevelopment, and ASD, our overall aim is to clarify the interactions between these factors

79

using a comprehensive genomic approach in frontopolar cortex brain tissues from individuals

80

with ASD and matched controls. Analysis of multiple chemokines and cytokines, whole

81

transcriptome RNA-Seq profiling, and single nuclear RNA-Seq reveals convergent evidence that

82

VEGF-A is upregulated in the cortex of ASD subjects, likely contributing to neuroinflammation.

Samples & RNA Isolation

85

Brain tissues were obtained through the Autism Tissue Program. They were dissected

86

postmortem from the frontopolar cortex (BA10) of individuals with ASD (n=17) and controls

87

(n=14). Subjects were predominately male (26M: 5F), white (28 white, 3 African-American), and

88

ranged in age from 2-57 years old. We isolated RNA from these tissues using TRIzol

91

measured prior to RNA-Seq analysis and all samples had and RNA Integrity Number (RIN) > 6,

92

indicating adequate quality for RNA expression measures. However, sample quality did decline,

93

as determined by RNA integrity, following RNA-Seq analysis but prior to measuring cytokine

and chemokine protein levels, which was accounted for in our statistical analyses. Table 1 lists

RNA-Seq Analysis
Whole transcriptome RNA-Seq libraries were constructed with the Ion Total RNA-Seq Kit

104

v2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) using RNA isolated from frontopolar cortex of ASD

105

samples and controls and sequenced on the Ion Proton System (Thermo Fisher Scientific,

106

Waltham, MA) at the Cedars Sinai Genomics Core (Los Angeles, CA), as an Ion Torrent

107

Certified Service Provider. We used the resultant FASTQ files to perform pseudo-alignments to

108

human genome build GRCh38 and transcript isoforms from Ensembl Genes release 95 with

109

kallisto v0.44.0 [33], generating transcript abundances across the transcriptome. We

110

subsequently tested for differential expression with sleuth v0.29.0 [34] in R v3.5.1. For additional

111

alternative splicing analyses, we performed full transcriptome alignments with GSNAP v2019-

112

01-24 [35] to human genome build GRCh38. We detected all known and novel splicing events

113

by specifying both the -N tag, to enable detection of novel splicing events, and the -s tag,

114

providing the software with a list of known splice acceptor and donor sites from Ensembl Genes

115

release 95 (Human genes GRCh38.p12). We sorted aligned sequence alignment map (SAM)

116

files and analyzed differentially expressed exons using DEXSeq [36] adjusting for RIN as a

117

covariate. We used the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to account for transcriptome-wide

118

multiple hypothesis testing, reporting significant genes and exons where the false discovery rate

119

adjusted p-value (q-value) is <0.05, unless otherwise noted.

120

Quantitative PCR

121

We synthesized cDNA from 500ng of total RNA with SuperScript IV (Invitrogen,

122

Carlsbad, CA), using random hexamers and oligo-dT. We performed quantitative PCR (qPCR)

123

using the QuantStudio 3 System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), with both custom

124

primers and Power SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) or TaqManTM probes

125

(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) (Supplemental Table S1) and NEB Luna Universal Probe

126

qPCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). We measured expression in triplicate in

127

three independent experiments. We used the geometric mean of cycle threshold values (CT) for

128

the housekeeping gene ACTB as an internal control to normalize the variability, and expression

129

values are reported as CT differences from ACTB (ΔACTB). We excluded any sample with RIN

130

< 5 at the time we conducted this experiment from further analysis.

131

Protein Expression in Brain

132

We homogenized brain tissues in a 1x phosphate buffered saline solution with 0.1%

133

Triton X-100 and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Pierce Protease Inhibitor, Thermo Fisher

134

Scientific, Carlsbad, CA) and filtered the supernatant using a 0.22μm spin-based column

135

(Ultrafree-MC, UFC30GV0S, Millipore Corp, St. Charles, MO). We subsequently measured

136

protein levels from filtered supernatants using two approaches. First, we measured 41 different

137

cytokines and chemokines using the Milliplex MAP Human Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead

138

Panel (Millipore kit no. HCVD3-67CKHCYTOMAG-60K, Millipore Corp, St. Charles, MO).

139

According to the manufacturer’s instructions, we thawed homogenates at room temperature,

140

diluted 1μg of total protein 1:5 with PBS, and incubated in the plate for 12 h at 4 °C. We

141

normalized tissue analyte concentrations to total protein concentrations of homogenate

142

supernatant for each sample, as measured by the Qubit Protein assay (Thermo Fisher

143

Scientific, Carlsbad, CA), and present the data as pg/ml protein homogenate. We excluded

144

analytes where all samples had values below the level of detection, according to their respective

145

standard curves. For the remaining 21 analytes, samples where values were below the level of

146

detection for a given analyte were imputed to the minimal detectable level of that analyte for

147

statistical analyses. The 21 analyzed analytes included FGF-2, FLT3L, Fractalkine, G-CSF,

148

GRO, IFNα2, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-8, IL-13, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α, PDGF-AA, PDGF-

149

AB/BB, RANTES, TGF-α, TNFα, and VEGF-A. For two additional proteins, PSD-95 and TSPO,

150

we performed standard Western blot analyses, normalizing our proteins of interest to β-actin.

151

We purchased the anti-PSD-95 (catalog #: D27E11) and anti-Actin (catalog #: 13E5) antibodies

from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA) and the anti-TSPO antibody (catalog #:

153

EPR5384) from Abcam (Cambridge, MA).

154

qPCR and Protein Statistical Analysis & Visualizations

155

All statistical analyses and visualizations were performed in R v3.5.1. For qPCR and

156

protein measures, we performed Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) comparing cases and controls

157

using the lm and anova functions in the base stats package in R. We used Akaike Information

158

Criterion (AIC) from the MASS package to select significant covariates for each analysis from

159

age, sex, race, PMI, and RIN. We created boxplot visualizations using the ggplot2 package in R.

160

We transformed outliers, defined as values greater than quartile 3 + 1.5 × interquartile range

161

(IQR) or less than quartile 1 - 1.5 × IQR across the whole range of values in both the control

162

and ASD groups, by capping upper values at the 95th percentile and lower values at the 5th

163

percentile.

164

Network and Pathway Analyses

165

We performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) using the

166

WGCNA package in R [37] with the top 5000 differentially expressed genes from the RNA-Seq

167

experiment, with a minimum module size of 30. We correlated module eigengenes with

168

demographic factors and protein expression levels, to identify co-expression modules

169

associated with these factors. We subsequently performed ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) on

170

groups of genes constituting the co-expression networks identified by WGCNA, focusing on

171

networks that significantly correlated with protein expression. For IPA analysis, we included the

172

case versus control gene expression fold changes from our RNA-Seq analysis, to detect

173

direction-of-effects for significantly enriched pathways and functions.

174

Single Nuclei RNA-Sequencing (snRNA-Seq)

175

Using publicly available data (Gene Expression Omnibus accession GSE97930; [38]) we

176

performed analyses of gene expression enrichment in different cell types of the human

177

frontopolar cortex. We extracted expression data for the 6,154 cells originating from BA10 and

178

performed cell type clustering with Seurat [39]. We examined the expression of VEGF-A across

179

different cell types. Using AUCell [40] we also tested for the enrichment of differentially

180

expressed genes from our RNA-Seq analysis and for the enrichment of genes associated with

181

VEGF-A from our WGCNA analysis across the different cell types.

Gene Expression & Protein Analysis Finds Upregulated VEGF-A in ASD

184

Comparing ASD cases to typically developed controls for our RNA-Seq data, we

185

observed 11 genes that were significantly upregulated in ASD cases (Figure 1). Amongst them

186

was VEGFA, encoding the VEGF-A protein, exhibiting approximately a 2-fold increase in ASD

187

frontopolar cortex. We performed qPCR analysis on a subset of genes in the samples with

188

acceptable RNA quality to confirm our RNA-Seq findings. Five of 6 genes we tested with qPCR

189

exhibited higher expression in ASD than controls, consistent with our RNA-Seq findings (Figure

190

2). Two of the genes trended toward significant differences between cases and controls

191

(VEGFA, p = 0.058 and ADGRG1, p = 0.072). When comparing expression measured by RNA-

192

Seq and qPCR for VEGFA, we observed significant negative correlation between normalized

193

kallisto gene abundance estimates and ACTB-normalized CT values (r=-0.62, p=0.024), as

194

would be expected, since lower CT values in this analysis represent higher gene expression.

195

The VEGFA qPCR primers targeted the exon 2-3 junction, which we found to be more abundant

196

in ASD samples than controls in our RNA-Seq experiment (Supplemental Table S2). Thus, our

197

qPCR findings are consistent with our RNA-Seq results, particularly regarding VEGFA RNA

198

expression.

204

ADGRG1 and VEGFA gene expression in the frontopolar cortex, as measured by qPCR, is

205

consistent with RNA-Seq. ASD samples (n=7) express approximately 2-fold more VEGFA

206

and 1.5-fold more ADGRG1 than control samples (n=10) and the comparisons for both

207

genes across diagnosis show a trend towards significance. The remaining genes, while

208

consistent with the changes in expression observed via RNA-Seq, were not significant when

209

compared across diagnosis. Notes: Gene expression is normalized to β-actin (ACTB), with

210

lower numbers indicative of higher expression. The boxplots represent the first quartile,

211

median, and third quartile, while the whisker bars represent the range of values within ± 1.5

212

× IQR. Abbreviations: ASD = Autism Spectrum Disorder, BA10 = Brodmann Area 10, CT =

213

cycle threshold.

214

VEGF-A plays a complex role in development due to the many different isoforms

215

encoded by the VEGFA gene. Based on observations in rodents [41], the developing human

216

brain likely expresses three major VEGF-A isoforms, VEGF-A121, VEGF-A165, and VEGF-A189,

217

with the nomenclature reflecting the size (in amino acids) of the protein. Alternative splicing at

218

exons 6 and 7 create these three isoforms, while alternative splicing of exon 8 confers affinity

219

for the neuropilin-1 receptor (NRP-1) [42,43]. Exon-exon junctions from our RNA-Seq

220

alignments are consistent with the expression of these three VEGF-A isoforms (Supplemental

221

Figure S1, Supplemental Table S2), which include exon 8a – the higher affinity form for NRP-1

222

binding. We did not find any evidence for usage of alternative exon 8b, associated with reduced

223

neuropilin-1 receptor (NRP-1) affinity [42]. We tested whether any specific isoform was

224

responsible for the increased VEGFA expression in ASD by examining differential exon

225

expression transcriptome-wide using DEXSeq. With respect to VEGFA, this analysis revealed

226

nominally significant increases in exons 1 and 6a and a nominally significant decrease in exon 8

227

(Table 2, Supplemental Figure S2). We also found differentially expressed exons from eight

228

other genes that reached transcriptome-wide significance (Table 2). VEGFA exons 1 and 8 are

229

constitutive exons for VEGF-A121, VEGF-A165, and VEGF-A189, but exon 6a is only included in

230

VEGF-A189. Therefore, we find it plausible that the isoform encoding VEGF-A189 is responsible

231

for increased VEGFA RNA expression in ASD.

Of the 41 cytokines & chemokines we measured using the Milliplex panel, 21 met

239

acceptable cutoffs for detection and were included in our analyses (Supplemental Table S3). Of

240

the 21 analyzed proteins, IL-1β, RANTES (CCL5), and VEGF-A was significantly increased in

241

the brains of ASD cases versus controls (Figure 3), while GRO (CXCL1), IL-6, and MIP-1α

242

(CCL3) trended towards significant increases (Supplemental Table S3). Here, we note that

243

capping the outliers in our protein analyses resulted in tighter distribution of values, especially

244

across the ASD samples, affecting the significance of the results (Supplemental Table S3).

245

However, the outlier capping did not affect the direction of effects or our interpretation of the

246

data, as the outliers were exclusively ASD samples with greatly increased cytokine and

chemokine levels. On average, the ASD cohort expressed approximately 1.4-fold more VEGF-A

248

protein than controls, consistent with the increased RNA expression we observed in the ASD

249

cohort. Western blot analysis to determine the relative expression of each protein isoform was

250

inconclusive, as we could not discern VEGF-A dimers from monomers that use the

251

noncanonical upstream CUG translation initiation site [44]. For example, the VEGF-A165 dimer

252

using the AUG initiation site and VEGF-A189 monomer using the CUG initiation site are both

253

approximately 44 kDa. Consistent with the protein measures, CCL5 mRNA expression,

254

encoding RANTES, was higher in ASD samples relative to controls, but this difference was not

255

significant (p=0.11, q=0.68). IL1B mRNA expression, encoding IL-1β, was not detected in our

256

RNA-seq analyses.

Network and Pathway Analyses Reveal Dysregulated VEGF-A Signaling and

Neuroinflammation

266

Our WGCNA analysis identified 15 unique co-expression networks. Of particular note,

267

the network eigengene most highly correlated with VEGF-A protein expression (r=0.65, p=1x10-

268

4,

269

gene clusters) is also significantly correlated with 11 additional cytokines and chemokines,

270

including IL-1β (Supplemental Figure S3). Consequently, we focused on the “green” network for

271

pathway analysis using IPA. We performed a Core Analysis using the 435 “green” network

272

genes, revealing multiple lines of evidence that suggests this co-expression network is related

to pro-inflammatory signaling. Specifically, the top “Upstream Regulators” are

274

lipopolysaccharide and TNF, the top “Disease and Disorder” annotation is “inflammatory

275

response”, and the top “Physiological System Development and Function” annotation is

276

“immune cell trafficking” (Supplemental Table S5). The Activation Z-scores generated by the

277

gene expression fold-changes consistently finds that the ASD cohort gene expression is

278

associated with greater immune and inflammatory pathways and functions. Additionally, “vegf”,

279

“VEGFA”, “IL1B”, and “CCL5” are all predicted to be significant upstream activators of the

280

“green” gene network (Supplemental Table S5), bolstering the association we observed

281

between this gene network and cytokine and chemokine protein expression. Ingenuity’s VEGFA

282

network, including activation of downstream targets predicted by IPA, are included in

283

Supplemental Figure S4.

284

To help us discern the role of VEGF-A in the frontopolar cortex, we extracted the

285

frontopolar cortex cells from publicly available snRNA-Seq data [38] and examined gene

286

expression across different cell types. Our clustering analysis found cell populations and cell

287

type-specific markers that were consistent with cortical cell populations in the original

288

publication [38] (Figure 4 and Supplemental Table S6). Following clustering, we examined the

289

enrichment of VEGFA and groups of genes, including differentially expressed RNA-Seq genes

290

and those genes included in the “green” WGCNA network, across the different cell types.

291

VEGFA was most strongly expressed in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and astrocytes

292

(Figure 5a, 5b). The group of 11 differentially expressed RNA-Seq genes are enriched in non-

293

neuronal cell populations, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and OPCs (Figure

294

6a), while genes from the “green” network are enriched specifically in microglia (Figure 6b).

316

Although our WGCNA and single-cell analyses find that VEGF-A expression is

317

significantly correlated with groups of genes that are strongly associated with neuroinflammation

318

and enriched in microglia, we cannot discern a cause-and-effect relationship from our analyses.

319

Activated microglia in ASD could stimulate the release of VEGF-A, resulting in a breakdown of

320

the local microvasculature and subsequent inflammation and angiogenesis. Alternatively,

321

increased VEGF-A could be a protective anti-inflammatory response to tonic neuroinflammation

322

observed in ASD. Arguing against a neuroprotective role, the isoform of VEGF-A typically

323

associated with anti-inflammatory response encodes exon 8b [45,46], which we do not see in

324

our splicing analysis.

325

Conclusions: Cytokines & VEGF-A in the Context of ASD & Neurodevelopment

326

Our analyses of RNA and protein expression revealed converging evidence that VEGF-

327

A is increased in the frontal cortex of individuals with ASD, with concurrent increases in the pro-

328

inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and RANTES. Interpreting this finding and understanding its

329

significance requires us to consider the regulation of VEGF-A expression and the many roles

330

VEGF-A plays in normal and aberrant neurodevelopment and ongoing brain-related processes.

331

This includes the diametric roles VEGF-A can play in angiogenesis, neuroinflammation, and

332

neurodevelopment, which depend on VEGF-A isoform expression and the complement of VEGF

333

receptors through which the ligand is signaling. We also must consider peripheral levels of

334

VEGF-A versus those observed in the central nervous system, as changes in VEGF-A and its

335

receptors have been detected in the periphery of ASD patients.

336

Increased IL-1β and RANTES is observed in peripheral blood from ASD patients [47].

337

Cells from the peripheral immune system of ASD patients show greater IL-1β release in

338

response to their activation [48], perhaps indicative of a subset of patients with a pro-

339

inflammatory phenotype [49]. Related to the gene expression changes we observed, IL-1β was

340

highly correlated with the “green” gene co-expression network, enriched in microglia cells. IL-1β,

341

secreted from glial cells in the CNS [50,51], is a potent stimulator of VEGF-A expression in the

342

context of neuroinflammation and hypoxia [51-53], providing a potential mechanism to explain

343

the increases in VEGF-A we observe in ASD brain tissue. RANTES can also stimulate the

344

release of VEGF from endothelial cells and has pro-angiogenic properties [54]. These findings

345

are consistent with the upregulated levels of VEGF-A we observed in ASD.

346

Decreased VEGF-A and increased soluble VEGF receptor 1 was observed in the serum

347

of severely affected patients [29], while decreased plasma VEGF-A levels were associated with

348

increased severity of ASD presentation in females [31]. These findings in the periphery differ

349

from our results, as we found that increased VEGF-A was associated with ASD. Peripheral

350

measures of VEGF-A expression do not reflect central measures [55,56], even in patients with

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/627083; this version posted May 3, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

351

brain tumors that express exponentially more VEGF-A [57-59]. This lack of correlation strongly

352

suggests that we cannot infer VEGF-A concentration in the CNS based on peripheral measures.

353

However, elevated VEGF-A in the brain can be detected in the CSF [57]. In support of our

354

findings, Vargas et al. [32] found an 81.8-fold increase in VEGF-A in the CSF of ASD patients

355

versus controls. In this study, however, the ASD cohort was significantly younger than the

356

control population (ASD age range 3-10 years old; Control age range 12-45 years old), which is

357

a major confound given VEGF-A’s role in neurodevelopment. Our cohorts did not significantly

358

differ by age (p=0.6), nor did VEGF-A levels correlate with age, excluding age as a confounding

359

factor. Since our results are specific to the frontal cortex and not the periphery, it is critical for us

360

to consider the isoform(s) of VEGF-A expressed here, their most likely cell type of origin, and

361

receptor expression throughout neurodevelopment.

362

Our RNA-Seq analysis did not reveal differential expression for any of the genes

363

encoding canonical VEGF receptors (FLT1, KDR, and FLT4), neuropilin receptors (NRP1 and

364

NRP2) or VEGF-B (VEGFB), allowing us to focus on the VEGF-A ligand. Furthermore, we did

365

not see significant increases in RNA expression for IL1B or CCL5. The developmental effects of

366

increased VEGF-A expression in the brain varies, depending on which VEGF-A isoform is

367

upregulated. For example, overexpression of mouse Vegf-A120 (analogous to human VEGF-

368

A121) in neurons increases cell density and angiogenesis in the forebrain and appears to have

369

anxiolytic and antidepressant effects on behavior [60]. However, the neurogenic effects

370

dissipates by adulthood [60], suggesting that earlier developmental periods are more responsive

371

to changes in VEGF-A levels. Overexpressing human VEGF-A165 in mouse neurons significantly

372

increases capillary density in the frontal cortex and increases blood flow in white matter under

373

severe hypercapnia [61]. Overexpressing VEGF-A165 also increases blood-brain barrier (BBB)

374

permeability [62]. Consistent with the consequences of VEGF-A overexpression observed in

375

rodents, ASD patients have increased neurogenesis in the frontal cortex [63,64], persistent

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/627083; this version posted May 3, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

376

angiogenesis [65], increased white matter metabolic rates in the frontal lobes [66], and apparent

377

altered BBB permeability [67,68].

378

Few studies currently link VEGF-A dysregulation to ASD, perhaps owing the lack of

379

published studies that have examined this growth factor in ASD brain tissues or etiologic

380

heterogeneity across ASD patient populations. Given this caveat, we cautiously interpret our

381

findings and encourage replication studies and those that examine VEGF-A levels in the brains

382

of ASD patients in vivo. For example, the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab has been

383

radiolabeled with zirconium-89 (89Zr-bevacizumab) and used in clinical applications, showing

384

some uptake into the brain [69,70]. However, the utility of 89Zr-bevacizumab as an imaging

385

marker capable of detecting modest changes in VEGF-A levels in the central nervous system is

386

yet to be demonstrated.

387

Even with cautious interpretation, there are three observations worth emphasizing. 1.)

388

Increased VEGF-A can create anatomic and physiological features that are commonly observed

389

in ASD. 2.) Increased VEGF-A can indicate ongoing pathophysiology related to

390

neuroinflammation. 3.) Glial-cell mediated neuroinflammation influences synaptic development

391

and neurogenesis. The question remains whether these observations converge in ASD and

392

account for a significant portion of ASD pathology.
