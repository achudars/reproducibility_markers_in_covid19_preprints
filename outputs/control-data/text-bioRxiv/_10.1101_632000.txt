SUMMARY

2

N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant internal mRNA modification,

3

and N6,2’-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am), found at the first-transcribed

4

nucleotide, are two examples of dynamic and reversible epitranscriptomic

5

marks. However, the profiles and distribution patterns of m6A and m6Am

6

across different human and mouse tissues are poorly characterized. Here we

7

report the m6A and m6Am methylome through an extensive profiling of 42

8

human tissues and 16 mouse tissue samples. Globally, the m6A and m6Am

9

peaks in non-brain tissues demonstrates mild tissue-specificity but are

10

correlated in general, whereas the m6A and m6Am methylomes of brain tissues

11

are clearly resolved from the non-brain tissues. Nevertheless, we identified a

12

small subset of tissue-specific m6A peaks that can readily classify the tissue

13

types. The number of m6A and m6Am peaks are partially correlated with the

14

expression levels of their writers and erasers. In addition, the m6A- and

15

m6Am-containing regions are enriched for single nucleotide polymorphisms.

16

Furthermore, cross-species analysis of m6A and m6Am methylomes revealed

17

that species, rather than tissue types, is the primary determinant of methylation.

18

Collectively, our study provides an in-depth resource for dissecting the

19

landscape and regulation of the m6A and m6Am epitranscriptomic marks

20

across mammalian tissues.

INTRODUCTION

2

More than 100 RNA modifications have been characterized so far (Machnicka

4

post-transcriptional modification of messenger RNA (mRNA) and long

5

noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in mammalian cells (Li et al., 2016; Liu and Pan,

6

2016; Zhao et al., 2017). m6A modification is catalyzed by a multi-component

7

methyltransferase complex that consists at least of METTL3, METTL14,

8

WTAP, KIAA1429 and RBM15 (Bokar et al., 1994; Bokar et al., 1997; Liu et al.,

9

2014; Ping et al., 2014; Schwartz et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014b). As the first

10

reversible mRNA modification, m6A can be “erased” via FTO and ALKBH5 (Jia

11

et al., 2011; Zheng et al., 2013). In addition, m6A can be recognized by

12

different types of reader proteins: the YTH-family proteins that specifically

13

recognize the m6A modification in RNA, proteins with a common RNA binding

14

domain and its flanking regions together to bind m6A, and proteins that use a

15

so-called m6A-switch mechanism for recognition (Hsu et al., 2017; Roundtree

16

et al., 2017b; Shi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2014a; Wang et al., 2015; Zhou and

17

Pan, 2018). These reader proteins further lead to different biological outcomes

18

for the m6A-marked RNA transcripts.

(Roundtree et al., 2017a; Yang et al., 2018). Moreover, m6A-dependent mRNA

2

regulation has now been demonstrated to regulate the process of circadian

3

rhythm, adipogenesis, spermatogenesis, embryonic stem cell self-renewal and

4

differentiation (Fu et al., 2014). The aberrant regulation of m6A is related to a

5

variety of cancers including acute myeloid leukemia, breast cancer,

6

glioblastoma, lung cancer and liver cancer (Hong, 2018; Luo et al., 2018),

7

which highlight the important regulatory roles of m6A.

8

Different from the internal m6A, there exists a terminal modification, termed

9

as N6,2’-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am). m6Am was originally discovered at the

10

5' end of mRNA in animal cells and viruses in 1975 (Wei et al., 1975). The

11

2’-hydroxyl position of the ribose sugar of the first and often second nucleotide

12

following the N7- methylguanosine (m7G) mRNA cap can be methylated by

13

2′-O-methyltransferases (2′-O-MTases), termed CMTr1 and CMTr2 (Belanger

14

et al., 2010; Werner et al., 2011). If the first nucleotide adjacent to the m7G cap

15

is 2′-O-methyladenosine (Am), it could be further methylated at the N6-position

16

to form m6Am (Figure 1A). It was only recently discovered that m6Am is also

17

reversible by FTO (Mauer et al., 2017; Wei et al., 2018). Moreover, we and

18

others discovered that phosphorylated CTD-interacting factor 1 (PCIF1) is the

19

cap-specific, terminal N6-methylation enzyme for m6Am (Akichika et al., 2018;

20

Sun et al., 2018). While FTO works both on terminal m6Am and internal m6A,

21

the m6Am writer PCIF1 is specific for the terminal m6Am modification and

1

hence will further promote the study of the biological functions of m6Am in near

2

future.

3

Several epigenetic and epitranscriptomic marks have been systematically

4

profiled at the tissue and cell level. For instance, the methylome of

5

5-methylcytosine in DNA (5mdC) across diverse cell lines and tissues revealed

6

that the majority (nearly 80%) of CpG sites are similarly methylated; yet, using

7

the ~20% differentially methylated regions (DMRs), tissue types and putative

8

regulatory CpGs can be effectively classified and captured (Schultz et al., 2015;

9

Ziller et al., 2013). More recently, the dynamic spatial and temporal patterns of

10

inosine have been demonstrated across many tissues of human and other

11

mammals (Tan et al., 2017). It is reported that the overall editing levels are

12

relatively similar across tissues whereas editing levels in non-repetitive coding

13

regions vary. However, m6A and m6Am methylome at the human tissue level

14

remains unexplored so far. Previous m6A methylome was primarily obtained

15

from limited numbers of mammalian cell lines and a few mouse tissues, while

16

newly discovered reversible m6Am methylome was even less well

17

characterized.

18

In this study, we performed comprehensive analyses of m6A and m6Am

19

methylome in 42 human and 16 mouse tissue samples. We first recapitulated

20

the similar distribution pattern and consensus motif for m6A and m6Am in

21

human tissues, as those found in cell lines. We then identified “conserved” and

1

“non-conserved” m6A peaks and revealed that m6A & m6Am peaks are

2

correlated across various non-brain tissues at the overall level, whereas

3

methylome of brain tissues show higher tissue-specificity. Interestingly, the

4

tissue-specific m6A peaks could readily distinguish different types of human

5

and mouse tissue. By analyzing the association between the peak numbers of

6

m6A & m6Am and the expression of the known methyltransferases &

7

demethylases, we uncover that m6A and m6Am are associated with its writers

8

and erasers. Moreover, the m6A- and m6Am-containing regions are enriched

9

for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in all tissues. To gain further

10

insight into m6A and m6Am variance, we performed cross-species analysis and

11

revealed that species are more determinant than tissue types. Collectively, our

12

study provides in-depth resource toward elucidating the dynamic patterns and

13

regulation of the epitranscriptomic marks m6A and m6Am across various

14

human and mouse tissues.

RESULTS

17

m6A and m6Am abundance across human and mouse tissues

18

To determine the abundance of m6A and m6Am in different human and mouse

19

tissues, post-mortem samples which include 42 tissues from 6 individuals (5

20

males and 1 female) and 16 tissues from 2 male mice were subjected to

21

quantitative MS analysis (Figures 1A-1C and S1A –S1E). The quantification of

1

m6A follows the standard procedure (Jia et al., 2011), a decapping step was

2

adapted for m6Am owning to its association with the mRNA cap (Mauer et al.,

3

2017; Wei et al., 2018). Application of the quantitative MS studies to various

4

human tissues revealed that the m6A/A ratio of total RNA is approximately

5

0.11%~0.23% (Figure S1D), while the m6Am/A ratio ranges from 0.0036% to

6

0.0169% (Figure S1E). Hence, the variation of m6Am content across different

7

tissues seems to be greater than that of m6A. Comparatively speaking, the

8

level of m6Am is ~2.2%-11.4% of that of m6A in the same tissue. Overall, the

9

results show that both the m6A and m6Am are widespread in various human

10

and mouse tissues.

11
12

Transcriptome-wide m6A and m6Am profiling in human and mouse

13

tissues

14

To investigate the distribution and dynamics of the m6A and m6Am among

15

different tissues, transcriptome-wide m6A and m6Am mapping was performed.

16

Due to the limited amount and partial degraded nature of human tissue RNA

17

samples, we adopted a recently published refined RIP-seq protocol for

18

low-input materials with several modifications (Zeng et al., 2018). It is worth

19

mentioning that instead of random priming, a template-switching reaction at 5’

20

end of RNA template was used during library construction so that the 5’ end

21

sequence information of RNA was preserved. Combining with the existing

1

knowledge of the cap-adjacent position of m6Am modification, m6Am sites of

2

mRNA can hence be more accurately determined. Moreover, we removed the

3

cDNA originated from rRNA after the reverse transcription instead of

4

performing a poly(A)+ selection, thereby allowing the preservation and profiling

5

of the non-coding RNAs, including long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and small

6

nuclear RNA (snRNA) in our study. For instance, U2 and U6 snRNAs are

7

enriched across all tissue samples in our study (Figures S1F and S1G), which

8

is consistent with the previous findings that U6 contains a m6A43 and U2

9

contain a m6Am at position 30 (Bohnsack and Sloan, 2018). Furthermore, the

10

high correlation between HEK293T samples from different batches of

11

experiments suggests good reproducibility of our epitranscriptomic sequencing

12

(Figure S1H).

13

We identified 11,060 -24,259 m6A peaks for the different human and mouse

14

tissues involved in our study, and calculated the distribution pattern of m6A in

15

their mRNAs (Table S1 and S2). Consistent with previous observations, we

16

found that m6A peaks were markedly enriched near the stop codon and the

17

distribution pattern of m6A is similar among all human tissues (Figure 1D).

18

Moreover, the peak numbers are positively correlated with the m6A abundance

19

detected by MS in human and mouse (Figures 1E and 1F). To assess the

20

sequence features of m6A, we performed motif search of m6A-enriched regions.

1

The previously reported consensus “GRACH” motif (where R represents G or

2

A; H represents A, C, or U) were identified in all tissues (Figure 1G).

3

We also analyzed m6Am peaks by distinguishing it from m6A peaks,

4

based on detecting methylated transcriptional start sites as previously

5

suggested (Schwartz et al., 2014). We observed a positive correlation of m6Am

6

signal with the m6Am abundance detected by MS in human and mouse tissues

7

(Figures 1H and 1I). Moreover, we found that the number of m6Am peaks in

8

mRNA varies greatly in different samples, ranging from 526 to 1,028 peaks

9

(Table S1). We next analyzed the m6Am consensus and found that they are

10

enriched in the canonical BCA motif (A=m6Am, B=C, G or U) (Figure 1J). As

11

expected, the nucleotides adjacent to the BCA motif are pyrimidine-rich

12

sequences known to be around TSS (Carninci et al., 2006; Frith et al., 2008; Ni

13

et al., 2010; Plessy et al., 2010).

14
15

Conservation and tissue-specificity of m6A across human and mouse

16

tissues

17

To investigate potential tissue-specificity of the m6A methylome, we first

18

classified all the genes into five categories based on their expression across

19

42 human tissues as previously published (Uhlen et al., 2015) (see Method

20

Details). We next assessed the proportion of m6A modified genes and peak

21

intensity among human tissues. Notably, both the percent of modified genes

9

1

and peak intensity in ubiquitously expressed genes are significantly higher

2

than that of tissue enriched group for human (P < 2.2*e-16) (Figures S2A and

3

2B). We also ruled out difference in expression levels as the explanation, since

4

no significant difference was observed for the two categories (Figure S2C).

5

Take the brain related tissues (cerebellum, cerebrum, hypothalamus and

6

brainstem) as examples, the intensity of brain enriched genes is significantly

7

lower than that of brain non-enriched genes (Figure S2D). Collectively, the

8

results imply that ubiquitously expressed genes are more likely to be m6A

9

regulated, while tissue enriched genes are more prone to be regulated at

10

transcript levels.

11

To further explore the tissue-specificity of m6A without the interference of

12

gene expression, we compared the m6A methylome using the ubiquitously

13

expressed genes across diverse human and mouse tissues. Overall, four

14

clusters were readily found in human: group 1 are methylome signals from

15

brain tissues (cerebellum, cerebrum, hypothalamus and brainstem), group 2

16

are methylome of rectum and jejunum, group 3 are methylome of other

17

non-brain tissues used in our study, and group 4 are methylome signals of

18

HEK293T cells. This observation suggests that the m6A methylome of brain

19

related tissues are highly specific, while the m6A methylome of non-brain

20

tissues show certain tissue-specificity (for instance, rectum and jejunum) but

21

are grouped together in general (Figure 2A). This finding is further

1

corroborated with the m6A methylome of mouse tissues (Figure 2B). Thus, our

2

observation implies that m6A is involved in the regulation of brain-specific

3

functions that are different from the rest of tissues both in human and mouse.

4

Note that there is less variation among mouse tissues; hence a relatively

5

higher tissue-specificity among non-brain tissues is also observed in mouse

6

(Figure 2B).

7

We then assessed the intensity of the “conserved m6A peaks” (peaks

8

identified in all tissues) and “non-conserved m6A peaks”. We found that the

9

intensity of the conserved m6A peaks is significantly higher than that of the

10

non-conserved m6A both in human and mouse (P<2.2*e-16) (Figures 2C and

11

2D), suggesting important regulatory roles of the conserved m6A signal. Take

12

PTEN as an example for the conserved m6A peaks: it is stably expressed in all

13

examined tissues and similarly m6A modified. Three m6A peak clusters which

14

are located at 5'-UTR, CDS and around stop codon respectively can be

15

identified in all tissues, indicating that m6A may play a generic regulatory role

16

for PTEN (Figure 2E). Another gene, SOX2, was taken as an example for the

17

non-conserved m6A peaks (Figure 2E).

18

Although we did not observe strong tissue-specificity of m6A methylome

19

across different non-brain tissues in human and mouse, we nevertheless

20

analyzed the tissue-specific m6A peaks among the tissues. Within the 9,431

21

ubiquitously expressed genes, we identified 21,480 m6A peaks, out of which

11

1

1,898 peaks are conserved across tissues while 594 m6A peaks are

2

tissue-specific. Interestingly, all the tissue samples can be readily separated

3

based on the small group of tissue-specific m6A signals for both human and

4

mouse (Figures 2F and 2G). Moreover, we found that genes encoding

5

transcripts with brain-specific m6A signals are enriched in head development

6

functions (Figure S2E).

7

Besides mRNA, m6A is also found in lncRNA (Bohnsack and Sloan, 2018;

8

Fu et al., 2014). Specifically, among the 42,873 lncRNAs expressed in the

9

tissue samples, we totally identified 78,789 m6A peaks. In addition, we found

10

1,816 ubiquitously expressed lncRNAs but the number of conserved m6A

11

peaks is limited (~383). Similar to that of mRNA (Figure 2A), the methylome of

12

tissue-specificity (Figure S2F). Moreover, we found that the intensity of the

14

conserved m6A is significantly higher than that of the non-conserved m6A in

We next investigated m6Am profiles using hierarchical clustering based on the

correlation among human tissues (the genes should be ubiquitously expressed

20

in all tissue types). Similar to m6A, m6Am signals of the brain tissues were

21

clearly resolved from that of the non-brain tissues (Figure 3A), suggesting that

m6Am may be involved in the regulation of brain-related physiological

2

processes. One example of conserved (ZNHIT6) and non-conserved

3

(AHCYL1) m6Am peak is shown, respectively (Figure 3B). Moreover, we

4

analyzed the m6Am methylome across 16 mouse tissues. Again, the different

5

brain regions clustered together and are separated from non-brain tissues

6

(Figure 3C). In fact, the m6Am signals of the mouse brain tissues appear to be

7

further separated away from the rest of the tissues when comparing to the m6A

8

clustering in Figure 2B.

10

m6Am negatively correlates with protein level

11

We next tried to examine potential functions of m6Am in mRNA. We found that

12

the m6Am mark is in general negatively correlated with protein level across the

13

human tissues. For instance, the normalized protein level of m6Am marked

14

genes is significantly lower than that of non-m6Am marked genes in multiple

15

tissues including adrenal gland, cerebrum,heart, prostate, liver, rectum and

16

testis (Figure 3D). A similar pattern can also be seen in lung, colon and

17

esophagus, although the difference is not statistically significant owing to the

18

limited number m6Am-marked genes under our strict cutoff for m6Am

19

identification (Figure S3A). Moreover, we divided the m6Am marked genes into

20

three sets on the basis of their modification level. Consistent with our previous

1

finding, the normalized protein level gradually decreases with the enhancement

2

of the m6Am signal (Figure 3E).

3

As the biological function of m6A modification relies on its reader proteins, it

4

would be of great importance to identify potential m6Am readers that can

5

directly regulate RNA metabolism. We adopted a computational pipeline to

6

screen potential m6Am binding proteins using the m6Am modification signal

7

identified in our study and the published crosslinking and immunoprecipitation

8

followed by high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq) of 171 RNA binding

9

proteins (RBPs) (Huang et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2019). The top 15 and bottom

10

15 of the 171 RBPs are shown (Figure S3B). Interestingly, the top candidate,

11

GNL3, is a known RBP that binds 5’UTR of mRNA; in addition, it does not bind

12

m6A in various systems (Edupuganti et al., 2017). However, because the

13

current sequencing resolution does not allow us to definitely distinguish m6Am

14

from a nearby m6A in the 5’-UTR, future experiments are needed to test the

15

specificity of the candidates in recognizing m6Am.

to the expression of each methyltransferase component and demethylase

remains unknown. By analyzing the peak numbers of m6A and m6Am in

that the expression of methyltransferase components including METTL3 and

3

WTAP are positively correlated to the m6A variation and explains about 36.2%

4

and 42.6%, of the m6A variation in human, respectively (Figures 4A and 4B).

5

METTL14 shows a weak correlation with m6A variation (Figure 4C). With

6

regards to m6A erasers, the expression of ALKBH5 is negatively correlated

7

with m6A signal and explained approximately 38.2% of the variation in human

8

(Figure 4D). In mouse, the expression of methyltransferase components

9

including METTL3 and METTL14 are positively correlated to the m6A variation

10

and explains about 50% and 68.1% of the variance while WTAP shows no

11

correlation (Figures 4H-4J). ALKBH5 is again negatively correlated with m6A

12

signal and explained 88.6% of the m6A variance (Figure 4K). Therefore,

13

despite slight difference, m6A methyltransferase components and demethylase

14

generally contribute to the m6A abundance in human and mouse.

15

We also analyzed the extent to which variation of m6Am modification could

16

be attributed to the expression of its writer and eraser. Very recently, the writer

17

of m6Am has been identified by us and other labs independently: both in vivo

18

and in vitro evidence has demonstrated that PCIF1 is specific for the

19

cap-related, terminal m6Am modification (Akichika et al., 2018; Sun et al.,

20

2018). The expression of PCIF1 accounts for approximately 32.8% and 66.2%

21

of the variation in human and mouse, respectively (Figures 4F and 4M). FTO

1

demethylates both m6A, m6Am and m1A, but its relative activity is recently

2

shown to be dependent on its sub-cellular localization (Wei et al., 2018). While

3

the localization of FTO in the human tissues was not examined, unexpectedly,

4

we observed a non-negative correlation between FTO expression and m6A &

5

m6Am variation, respectively (Figures 4E, 4G, 4L and 4N). To look into this

6

non-negative correlation, we used GTEx datasets to perform co-expression

7

analysis and found that FTO is highly co-expressed with both the m6A and

8

m6Am methyltransferase components (Figure 4O). Considering that m6A and

9

m6Am are reversible modifications involved in many different biological

10

processes, such co-expression of methyltransferase components and

11

demethylases could be beneficial to the dynamic regulation.

12

Notably, the transcripts of m6A and m6Am writers and erasers also contain

13

these methylation marks (Figure 4P). For instance, we found conserved m6A

14

peaks in METTL3, METTL14, WTAP, METTL16, FTO and ALKBH5 across all

15

human tissues and conserved m6Am peaks in WTAP and ALKBH5. We also

16

identified alternative m6Am signals in METTL3 and alternative m6A signals in

17

PCIF1. Thus, the transcripts of the modification machineries for m6A and

18

m6Am are also susceptible to epitranscriptomic regulation so that the crosstalk

19

between m6A and m6Am is worth further explored.

m6A and m6Am peaks are enriched for SNPs that are associated with

2

diseases in human tissues

3

About millions of SNPs have been identified across multiple human genomes

4

and the SNPs within m6A or m6Am peak regions are defined as m6A-related or

5

m6Am-related SNPs. Here, we sought to investigate the relationship between

6

m6A and SNPs across human tissues. Firstly, we sought to identify the relative

7

distribution of m6A and SNPs. We found that m6A-containing regions are

8

enriched for SNPs and the number of SNPs decreases as the distance from

9

the m6A sites increases (Figure 5A). Within the m6A peaks (approximately

10

200-300nt), we observed ~8,193-31,363 SNPs for each tissue, with jejunum

11

containing the most abundant SNPs. In fact, non-brain tissues are more

12

enriched for SNPs than brain tissues in the m6A peak regions (P < 2.2*e-16)

13

(Figure 5B). To exclude the possibility that the observed enrichment is due to

14

the position background, we also used the regions surrounding stop codon of

15

the overall transcripts (position background control) or genome background for

16

comparison. We found that the number of SNPs in m6A regions are still

17

significantly higher than that of position background control and genome

18

background (P < 2.2 *e-16) (Figure 5B).

19

We next analyzed the m6A-related SNPs and found that the number of

20

synonymous and nonsynonymous SNPs are comparable, which accounts for

21

48.9% and 49.7% across all tissues, respectively (Figure S4A). In addition,

17

1

m6A-related SNPs are mainly located at exon (>90%), among which 48.4%

2

and 49.2% fall within the 3’-UTR and CDS, respectively (Figure S4B and S4C).

3

Interestingly, m6A-related SNPs also include mutations that lead to gain of m6A

4

modification (or “m6A-gain variants”). Take PRUNE1 as an example: a

5

synonymous mutation, C-to-A mutation (rs3738476) in the CDS region

6

generates a GGACU sequence de novo, which enables this site to be m6A

7

modified (Figure 5C). In total, we identified ~0.76% m6A-related SNPs to be

8

within a 16nt window of a putative RRACH consensus motif. We further used

9

“Disease ontology (DO)” to reveal the relevance of m6A-related SNPs in

10

diseases, and found that the m6A-related SNPs are highly correlated with

11

diseases including colorectal cancer, colorectal carcinoma and coronary artery

12

diseases (Figure S4D).

13

We next assessed the correlation between m6Am and SNPs. After ruling

14

out potential positional and genomic background (P < 2.2 *e-16), we found that

15

the m6Am regions are also enriched for SNPs in human tissues (Figure 5D).

16

Different from m6A, the SNP frequency has no significant difference between

17

brain tissues and non-brain tissues (P=0.063) (Figure 5E). We next analyzed

18

m6Am-related SNPs and found that the number of synonymous and

19

nonsynonymous SNPs accounts for 45.5% and 53.1% across all tissues,

20

respectively (Figure S4E). In addition, m6Am-related SNPs are mainly located

21

at exon (>90%), among which 51.6% and 42.5% fall within the 5’-UTR and

18

1

CDS, respectively (Figures S4F and S4G). We further revealed that

2

m6Am-related SNPs appear to be associated with asthma (Figure S4H).

3

Interestingly, when we analyzed m6Am related SNPs in brain tissues, we found

4

that they are specifically enriched for brain-related diseases including

5

marijuana abuse, mood abuse and glioblastoma (Figure 5F). Together, our

6

results suggest a connection between epitranscriptomic marks and risk for

7

diseases.

m6A peaks are enriched at the microRNA target sites

10

Because m6A peaks are enriched near the stop codon and in the 3’-UTR and

11

microRNA (miRNA) target sites are frequently observed within 3’-UTR, we

12

next sought to investigate whether m6A are associated with miRNA binding

13

sites. We found that more than 77%-80% m6A-containing transcripts have at

14

least one miRNA binding site. Further analysis revealed that nearly all the m6A

15

peaks (>96%) could pair with miRNAs with relatively strict alignment criteria

16

across all tissues. Regions surrounding the m6A peaks contain ~9,786-14,104

17

miRNA binding sites, with cerebellum m6A regions contain the most miRNA

18

target sites. In all the tissues, microRNA targeting sites show an enriched

19

distribution around the m6A peaks (Figure S5A). To rule out that the

20

enrichment of the miRNA targets is due to potential positional effects, we

21

analyzed the miRNA targets near stop codon and found that the distribution

1

pattern of miRNA near m6A is significantly different from the pattern near stop

2

codon (Figure S5B).

3

Among the m6A consensus motif “RRACH”, “GGACH” is the most frequent

4

in all tissues (Figure S5C). We used relatively strict criteria in which at most 1nt

5

mismatch was allowed, and found that m6A peaks could be targeted by ~ 423

6

miRNAs. For instance, the strongest, GGACH consensus motif was inversely

7

complementary to the seed region of many miRNAs. To further explore the

8

relationship between microRNA and m6A-containing genes, we next searched

9

miRNAs that are indeed expressed in the corresponding tissues. We found

10

that 78 miRNAs were stably expressed in all tissues, of which, 11 could pair

11

with m6A motif (Figure S5D). We also identified tissue-specific miRNAs across

12

urinary bladder, brain, liver, lung and testis, and revealed that they are

13

inversely complementary to the m6A motifs as well (Figure S5E). Finally, the

14

miRNAs specifically expressed in brain tissues are most likely to target m6A

15

peaks: about 27% of brain-specific miRNAs could pair with m6A.

16
17

m6A and m6Am methylome conservation across species

18

To demonstrate the conservation of m6A between human and mouse, we first

19

compared the m6A methylome in human cerebellum with that of mouse

20

cerebellum. We observed that the m6A-containing orthologous genes in the

21

cerebellum of the two species exhibit a high overlap (Figure 6A), consistent

20

1

with the comparative analysis of m6A methylome using HepG2 cell lines and

2

mouse liver (Dominissini et al., 2012). However, the degree of conservation of

3

m6A between tissues and species was still unknown. Intriguingly, although the

4

overlap between matched tissues from different species is already high (Figure

5

6A), all tissues of same species demonstrate higher similarity of overall m6A

6

signals and tend to group together than the same tissues of different species

7

(Figure 6B and S6A). Moreover, we divided the orthologous genes into 5’-UTR,

8

CDS and 3’-UTR segments and again observed the similar clustering of m6A

9

methylome by species (Figures S6B-6D). In addition, we also picked out the

10

housekeeping genes as reported before (Eisenberg and Levanon, 2013) and

11

found that the overlap of the m6A-containing housekeeping genes in different

12

tissue of the same species, for instance human cerebellum and heart, is

13

significantly higher than that of the matched tissue from different species, for

14

instance human and mouse cerebellum (P < 2.2 *e-16) (Figures 6C and 6D),

15

implying that the m6A methylome of housekeeping genes contributed to the

16

overall clustering pattern.

17

To obtain a comparative view of m6Am methylome across human and

18

mouse tissues，we performed m6Am analysis and again, observed that different

19

tissue samples were largely grouped by species rather than tissue types

20

(Figures 6E and S6E). Take the human cerebellum,human heart and mouse

21

cerebellum as examples,the m6Am-containing orthologous genes in the

human cerebellum and heart shows significantly higher overlap than that

between the human cerebellum and mouse cerebellum (P<2.2*e-16) (Figures

DISCUSSION

6

Despite their importance in RNA biology, m6A and m6Am modifications were

7

not interrogated across diverse human and mouse tissues. In this study, we

8

measured the level of m6A and m6Am and provide the first transcriptome-wide

9

characterization of m6A and m6Am methylome in human and mouse tissues.

10

We show that the overall m6A and m6Am methylome are similar across various

11

non-brain tissues, whereas brain tissues are highly specific. Interestingly, a

12

small subset of tissue-specific m6A signals nevertheless distinguish different

13

human and mouse tissue types. We also find that m6A and m6Am are partially

14

associated with their writers and erasers. We uncover associations between

15

m6A & m6Am and SNPs, and found a negative correlation between m6Am and

16

protein expression. Finally, we show that species is a stronger factor than

17

tissue type in determining the m6A and m6Am methylome. Collectively, our

18

study reveals that m6A and m6Am are widespread and dynamically regulated

19

epitranscriptomic marks across human and mouse tissues.

20

Our transcriptome-wide mapping relies on an antibody that binds to both

21

m6A and m6Am. The signals of m6A and m6Am are not directly separated by

1

the sequencing method, but are rather differentiated bioinformatically by using

2

a variety of criteria as previously reported (Schwartz et al., 2014). Even though

3

the two modifications reside in different biological context (internal vs terminal;

4

and different consensus motifs), the bioinformatics pipeline can not definitely

5

distinguish them. Nevertheless, our quantitative MS analysis relies on the

6

different molecular weight of m6A and m6Am, and hence the modification

7

levels across different human tissues are accurate. Notably, the number of

8

m6A and m6Am peaks and the overall methylome we identified agrees well

9

with the quantitative modification level by MS. While potential knock-out

10

experiments of modification enzymes could be performed in cell lines to

11

cleanly separate the two marks, it is currently not possible to remove

12

methyltransferases in human tissues. Thus, it will be of great interest to have

13

epitranscriptomic tools in future to directly and definitely distinguish m6A from

14

m6Am.

15

Our analyses reveal that m6A and m6Am are highly correlative across

16

non-brain tissues at the overall level, while that of brain tissues show high

17

tissue- specificity. Such finding is reminiscent of previous studies of inosine

18

and 5mdC

19

inosine profiles across different tissues are also highly correlated, with the

20

exception that brain regions can be resolved from non-brain tissues by

21

principal component analysis; while for 5mdC, nearly 80% CpG sites are

(Schultz et al., 2015; Tan et al., 2017; Ziller et al., 2013). The

1

similarly methylated and the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) only

2

accounts for 20% CpG sites in diverse cell lines (Schultz et al., 2015; Ziller et

3

al., 2013). Nevertheless, we still uncovered many transcripts that exhibit

4

tissue-specific m6A methylation patterns, demonstrating that m6A signal can

5

be used to classify different types of human and mouse tissues, consistent

6

with the use of DMRs to classify unknown samples and identify representative

7

signature regions that recapitulate major DNA methylation dynamics. As for

8

the observed tissue-specificity of m6A and m6Am in brain tissues, many

9

studies have reported the importance of m6A modification in human brain

10

development and neurological disorders (Du et al., 2018). We also highlight

11

the specificity of both m6A and m6Am in brain tissues and show the

12

brain-specific m6A are enriched in brain-related function, further supporting

13

that m6A could play unique roles for brain tissues. It’s worth mentioning that

14

during the preparation of this manuscript, m6A methylome in human fetus

15

tissues was reported (Xiao et al., 2019). Although different human tissue

16

samples were used, it appears that m6A methylome in brain tissues of fetus is

17

also highly specific.

18

m6Am is recently shown to be a reversible epitranscriptomic mark (Mauer

19

et al., 2017; Wei et al., 2018). However, the ability of FTO to demethylate both

20

m6A and m6Am renders it difficult to functionally separate the two modifications.

21

More recent identification and characterization of the m6Am writer protein

PCIF1 by us and others have shown that PCIF1 is specific for the cap-related

2

m6Am but not internal m6A, providing an orthogonal system to specifically

3

dissect the biological roles of m6Am (Akichika et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2018). In

4

this study, we show that the expression of PCIF1 is correlated with m6Am. In

5

addition, we found that m6Am is negatively correlated with protein level,

6

providing insights into the functional roles of m6Am. It would also be interesting

7

to integrate such m6Am methylome data to identify potential m6Am reader

8

proteins in the future.

9

Our profiling reveals greater m6A and m6Am difference between species

10

than tissue types, which is highly suggestive of stronger cis-directed regulation

11

of m6A and m6Am methylome. This is also observed for inosine, for which

12

tissue samples are also largely grouped by species rather than by tissue type.

13

Additionally, it is found that inosine sites edited similarly between species have

14

more conserved flanking sequences than sites edited differentially. Once more

15

m6A and m6Am datasets (ideally high resolution methylome) in other species

16

become available in future, the influence of flanking sequences on m6A and

17

m6Am signal can also be investigated. Besides, the regulation of m6A and

18

m6Am by species-specific trans-acting factors is also worth exploration. For

19

instance, a novel trans-regulatory factor AIMP2, which enhances the

20

degradation of the ADAR proteins, has been identified for inosine (Tan et al.,

21

2017). Future studies aiming at uncovering additional cis- and trans-regulators

1

of m6A and m6Am are necessary to determine how precise control of

2

methylation is achieved in a myriad of biological contexts.

3

In summary, our work reveals the dynamic landscape of m6A and m6Am

4

across human tissues and provides a resource for functional studies of m6A

5

and m6Am in the future.

2

2010). We next calculated the SNP frequency of transcripts that contain

3

m6A-related SNPs and of the position background which are defined as

4

regions flanking stop codon (~400bp) to eliminate the influence of position

5

background. Besides, we also selected 1,000,000 genome random regions

6

from hg19 (random seed 6135). The SNP frequency of genome random

7

regions are defined as genome background. The location of m6A-related SNP

8

sites were annotated by the transcript segments, including the CDS, 3′ UTR, 5′

9

UTR, start codon, stop codon and etc., and the type of SNPs were annotated

10

into synonymous and nonsynonymous by ANNOVAR (Wang et al., 2010). We

used samtools(v1.7)(Li, 2011) to identify SNPs and m6A-related SNPs (Jiang

SNPs and diseases. Correlation analysis of SNP and m6Am was similar to that
