Abstract

11

Nuclear inserts derived from mitochondrial DNA (Numts) encode valuable information.

12

Being mostly non-functional, and accumulating mutations more slowly than mitochondrial

13

sequence, they act like molecular fossils – they preserve information on the ancestral

14

sequences of the mitochondrial DNA. In addition, changes to the Numt sequence since their

15

insertion into the nuclear genome carry information about the nuclear phylogeny. These

16

attributes cannot be reliably exploited if Numt sequence is confused with the mitochondrial

17

genome (mtDNA). The analysis of mtDNA would be similarly compromised by any confusion,

18

for example producing misleading results in DNA barcoding that used mtDNA sequence.

19

We propose a method to distinguish Numts from mtDNA, without the need for

20

comprehensive assembly of the nuclear genome or the physical separation of organelles and

21

nuclei. It exploits the different biases of long and short-read sequencing. We find that short-

22

read data yield mainly mtDNA sequences, whereas long-read sequencing strongly enriches

23

for Numt sequences. We demonstrate the method using genome-skimming (coverage < 1x)

24

data obtained on Illumina short-read and PacBio long-read technology from DNA extracted

25

from six grasshopper individuals. The mitochondrial genome sequences were assembled

26

from the short-read data despite the presence of Numts. The PacBio data contained a much

27

higher proportion of Numt reads (over 16-fold), making us caution against the use of long-

28

read methods for studies using mitochondrial loci. We obtained two estimates of the

29

genomic proportion of Numts. Finally, we introduce “tangle plots”, a way of visualising Numt

30

structural rearrangements and comparing them between samples.

Introduction

35

Sequences of mitochondrial DNA have proved indispensable markers for population genetics

36

and phylogenetics for decades (Avise et al., 1987; Ballard & Rand, 2005). More recently,

37

numerous ecological experiments have exploited the universal animal barcoding marker,

38

COX1, which is a mitochondrial gene (Hebert, Ratnasingham, & deWaard, 2003). One

39

valuable property of mitochondrial sequences is that, being more abundant, they tend to be

more effectively amplified by PCR than nuclear sequences, in particular in difficult or

41

degraded samples. Mitochondrial markers are therefore widely used in research on museum

42

specimens (Anmarkrud & Lifjeld, 2017), ancient DNA studies (Baca et al., 2018; Mohandesan

43

et al., 2017) and analyses of faecal samples (van der Valk, Lona Durazo, Dalén, & Guschanski,

44

2017). A second advantage is that, thanks to their comparatively small size (approximately

45

16 kbp) and conserved structure (Boore, 1999) animal mitochondrial genomes are easy to

46

assemble. Similar considerations make plastid genomes particularly valuable in genetic

47

analysis of plants (Twyford & Ness, 2016).

48

The advantages of mtDNA analysis can be negated by the presence of Numts: nuclear inserts

49

derived from mitochondrial DNA (and in plants, the plastid equivalent, Nupts). Evidence of

50

such insertions was first found shortly after mitochondria were discovered to contain their

51

own genetic material (Du Buy & Riley, 1967) and it has since become clear that Numts are

52

present in many species (Bensasson, Zhang, Hartl, & Hewitt, 2001), often in multiple copies.

53

The abundance of Numts strongly depends on whether a species has one or more

54

mitochondria per cell, an observation which led Barbrook, Howe, & Purton (2006) to

55

postulate a limited transfer window.

56

The confusion of Numts and mitochondrial sequence could lead to incorrect interpretations

57

of molecular genetics studies (Blacket, Semeraro, & Malipatil, 2012; Hawlitschek et al., 2017;

58

Jordal & Kambestad, 2014; Kim, Lee, & Ju, 2013; Thalmann, Hebler, Poinar, Pääbo, &

59

Vigilant, 2004; Zhang & Hewitt, 1997). Any study targeting mitochondrial sequences will

60

therefore benefit from knowledge of the genomic content of Numts.

61

While Numts are commonly seen as a nuisance, they are fascinating study objects in their

62

own right. Accruing substitutions more slowly than the mitochondrial DNA lineage, they act

63

as “molecular fossils” providing information about the ancestral mitochondrial sequence

64

(Lopez, Yuhki, Masuda, Modi, & O’Brien, 1994; Thalmann, Serre, et al., 2004). Some can be

65

distinguished, because substitutions which have accumulated since integration into the

66

nucleus have a high incidence of non-synonymous changes relative to mtDNA (Bensasson,

67

Zhang, & Hewitt, 2000). Such Numts can be used as genetic markers, for example providing

68

evidence of past episodes of hybridisation between taxa (Brelsford, Mila, & Irwin, 2011;

69

Miraldo, Hewitt, Dear, Paulo, & Emerson, 2012).

70

Before high-throughput sequencing data became readily available, Numts could be detected,

71

albeit with some difficulty, by PCR-based methods (Bensasson et al., 2000) or cytologically,

72

by in situ hybridisation of mitochondrial sequences to chromosomal preparations (Gellissen,

73

Bradfield, White, & Wyatt, 1983). To physically separate mitochondrial and nuclear DNA,

74

(ultra) centrifugation can be used (Garber & Yoder, 1983; Lansman, Shade, Shapira, & Avise,

75

1981), but these methods require considerable technical effort. Since the advent of high-

76

throughput sequencing data, two further approaches have been applied to identifying

77

Numts. (1) In well-assembled genomes sequenced at high coverage, Numts can be detected

78

simply by screening the assembly for regions with similarity to mitochondrial DNA (Hazkani-

79

Covo, Zeller, & Martin, 2010). Where genomic data has been assembled for multiple

80

individuals, as in humans, insertion/deletion polymorphism for Numts can be readily studied

81

(Dayama, Emery, Kidd, & Mills, 2014). (2) In absence of a well-assembled genome, for

82

instance in genome skimming studies (Dodsworth, 2015; Straub et al., 2012), Numts may be

83

identified if reads (or read pairs) match the mitochondrial sequence for only part of their

84

length. Otherwise, if the whole of the read maps to the mitochondrial genome, it may be

85

possible to classify its Numt origin if the sequence has diverged from the mitochondria.

86

Those that have not diverged sufficiently to be distinguished are termed "cryptic Numts"

87

(Bertheau, Schuler, Krumböck, Arthofer, & Stauffer, 2011).

88

In this paper, we develop a further approach that investigates Numts by making use of the

89

“by-catch” from High-throughput sequencing. We use this term to emphasise that much

90

sequencing data is superfluous to the aims of a specific experiment, often the huge majority.

91

The low price of sequencing data means these data could be discarded; yet this genomic by-

92

catch can be mined for valuable incidental information. In particular it can be used to

93

assemble genomes of organelles such as mitochondria. The choice of sequencing platform

94

may influence the type of by-catch produced, particularly because of differences in

95

fragmentation and size-selection protocols. We show that this difference can be exploited to

96

investigate the Numt content of the genome.

97

In order to outline our approach, it is helpful to divide the data generated from a sequencing

98

library into fractions (see Figure 1). The first major division is between A – reads without

99

similarity to mitochondrial sequences and ML – mitochondrial-like sequences (i.e. those

100

which align to the mitochondrial genome). This ML fraction may conceptually be subdivided

101

further into D – those which can be identified as Numt sequences (i.e. sequences aligning for

102

their full length but having a different sequence, or aligning for part of their length), C –

103

cryptic Numts indistinguishable from actual mitochondrial sequences, and M – sequences

104

derived from actual mitochondrial genomes. Fractions A, C, and D are derived from nuclear

105

DNA (fraction N, comprising A + C + D). In our analysis we assume that their ratios are

106

effectively constant among individuals from the same species. For instance, the proportion

107

of obvious Numts in the nuclear genome D/N should be constant. The size of fraction M,

108

which is contributed by mitochondria, may differ between samples because of differences in

109

the number of mitochondria per cell with tissue, sex, or developmental stage (Fernández-

110

Vizarra, Enríquez, Pérez-Martos, Montoya, & Fernández-Silva, 2011). This will cause

111

difference in M among samples, which will be observed in differences in the ratios of A and

112

ML in different individual samples.

113

Here we demonstrate two complementary approaches for estimating the proportion the

114

nuclear genome made up of Numts. One exploits the variation in M from sample to sample

115

in short-read data, which arises because of differences in the mitochondrial composition

116

with tissue, sex, or developmental stage. Secondly in some types of long-read data M is

117

minimal, so the ratio can be calculated directly. We demonstrate these approaches using

118

genome skimming data (coverage < 1/3x) generated by short-read (Illumina’s NextSeq) and

119

long-read (PacBio’s RSII) platforms from the grasshopper, Podisma pedestris. We assemble

120

the species’s mitochondrial genome sequence and calculate these two estimates of the

121

proportion of Numts in the nuclear genome. We also introduce a method, which we call

122

“tangle plots”, for the visualisation of Numts with structural re-arrangements

Samples and sequencing

127

Information about the samples can be found in Table 1.

128
129
130

Illumina NextSeq

131

Freshly removed hindlegs of Podisma pedestris were snap-frozen and stored at -79 °C.

132

Before DNA extraction, the legs were dipped into boiling water to inactivate DNases.

133

Subsequently, the denatured femur muscle was dissected out. DNA was then extracted using

134

a Qiagen Blood and Tissue kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. Using a Covaris ultra

135

sonicator the DNA was sheared aiming to achieve a median size of 550 bp. Libraries for

136

sequencing were prepared using an Illumina TruSeq DNA PCR-Free kit. Sequencing was

137

carried out at QMUL’s Genome Centre on Illumina’s NextSeq Platform using v2 chemistry.

138

PacBio RSII

139

Freshly removed hindlegs were stored in pure ethanol. DNA was extracted from four

140

samples using a Qiagen Gentra HMW kit resulting in molecules with a length of

141

mainly > 48 kbp (TapeStation, Agilent Genomics). Further work was carried out by The

142

University of Liverpool’s Centre for Genomic Research. The aimed size for DNA

143

fragmentation was 10 kbp. The libraries’ median (non-redundant) insert sizes were 3125,

144

3167, and 2097 bp. Sequencing was carried out on a PacBio RSII machine using C6 chemistry.

145

All PacBio data were obtained as circular consensus sequences (CSSs) in FASTQ format.

146

These are of a higher per-base quality than the raw reads, because they are generated from

147

multiple reads generated from the same circular template.

148

Data cleaning

149

Two sets of clean NextSeq data were prepared. For the RepeatExplorer analysis (see below),

150

the data were filtered using a custom python script keeping only read pairs where 90 % of

151

the bases had a phred quality score > 20. Pairs matching the TruSeq adapters (detected by

152

BLASTn num_aligments 1) were discarded to remove adapter dimers.

153

A second cleaned set of NextSeq data was generated for mapping and variant calling. Here,

154

we aimed to remove as many low-quality base calls as possible. The first 5 bp of each read

155

were removed and, using Skewer (Jiang, Lei, Ding, & Zhu, 2014), each 3’ end was trimmed

156

until the last base had a phred quality 30 or higher.

157

For the RepeatExplorer analysis of PacBio data, pseudo paired reads of 151 bp with an insert

158

size of 550 bp were cut out of long PacBio reads using custom-made python scripts which

159

depend on the biopython module, http://biopython.org/ (Cock et al., 2009).

160

RepeatExplorer analyses

161

RepeatExplorer (https://galaxy-elixir.cerit-sc.cz/, Novák, Neumann, Pech, Steinhaisl, &

162

Macas, 2013) is a pipeline for analysing the repetitive genome content from short-read

163

genome skimming data. It performs an all-to-all comparison and generates clusters of similar

164

reads, which often correspond to particular genomic repeats such as transposable elements

165

or satellites. Mitochondrial genomes and ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA), which are present in

166

high copy numbers, are usually picked up as well.

167

RepeatExplorer was run twice. The first run was used to assemble a reference sequence for

168

the Podisma pedestris mitochondrial genome, from the NextSeq reads. In the second run,

169

100,000 NextSeq read pairs from each of six individuals (N1-N6) and 150,000 PacBio pseudo

170

read pairs from each of three individuals (P1-P3) were analysed jointly to compare the

171

sequencing methods. The pipeline was supplied with a custom annotation database

172

containing the mitochondrial genome sequence of Schistocerca gregaria [Genebank

173

NC_013240.1 (Erler, Ferenz, Moritz, & Kaatz, 2010)⁠] in the first round and with the Podisma

174

pedestris rDNA and mitochondrial genome in the second run.

175

Mitochondrial sequence assembly

176

Eight RepeatExplorer clusters connected by paired reads (244 - 57 - 230 - 205 - 69 - 85 - 102 -

177

161) showed sequence similarity to S. gregaria mitochondrial DNA. Those clusters

178

overlapping consensus sequences were assembled in Geneious R9, forming a reference to

179

which reads of sample N1 were mapped. High coverage and truncated reads at the control

180

region indicated a duplication, which was then added to the reference. Subsequently, each

181

of the six NextSeq samples’ sequencing data were mapped individually using BWA (Li &

182

Durbin, 2009) with the following command line: bwa mem -t <no of threads>

183

<reference> <(zcat read files). For each of the six alignments, 50 % majority rule

184

consensus sequences were created in Geneious. They were annotated automatically using

185

the MITOS WebServer (Version 2 beta, Bernt et al., 2013). Our mitochondrial genome

186

assemblies were checked by re-assembling the short-read data with NOVOPlasty

187

(Dierckxsens, Mardulyn, & Smits, 2016), which produced essentially the same sequences.

188

Mapping and variant detection

189

In order to detect individual-specific variants, a second round of mapping was carried out

190

with NextSeq data. Polymorphisms were called using Geneious’s function “Find

191

Variations/SNPs” with default settings and a minimum allele frequency set to 0.01. The

192

resulting tables were exported to CSV format and were processed interactively in R 3.3.1 (R

193

Core Team, 2016).

194

All PacBio reads were aligned to the mitochondrial assembly using the LAST suite (Kielbasa,

195

Wan, Sato, Horton, & Frith, 2011). In brief, the reference genome was masked in regions

196

with GC-content below 10 % and was subsequently converted to a LAST database using the

197

scoring scheme NEAR, preserving all masked regions and additionally masking simple

198

repeats (optimised for high AT-content). Lastal was then run with parameter D set to one

199

thousand times the length of the assembly (corresponding to an e-value of 1e-3 in BLAST).

200

Of the resulting hits, only those with alignment lengths above 100 bp were kept. Shorter

201

ones tended to map to in regions of low complexity, not permitting meaningful conclusions

202

about homology.

203

Assessment of sequencing bias and genomic proportion of Numts

204

The output of the comparative (i.e. second) RepeatExplorer run was used to assess

205

sequencing technology-specific bias (see Fig. 2).

206

Illumina data

207

Sequencing reads of the mitochondrial-like fraction (ML, see Fig. 1) could either have

208

originated from mitochondrial genomes (M) or from Numts (fractions C and D). Assuming

209

each of the individuals contained the same genomic proportion of Numts, the variation

210

between samples in the relative proportion of ML in the NextSeq data (see Tab. 1) would be

211

attributed to different mitochondrial densities in the extracts (varying proportion of M). One

212

estimate of the proportion of Numt sequences reads can be obtained from the assumption

213

that most mtDNA in any one individual is monomorphic, whereas some of the Numt

214

sequences will be fixed for a different allele (because mtDNA tends to evolve faster than

215

Numts). In this case, the frequency of this Numt allele will be proportional to the relative

216

contribution of Numts. The maximum of the distribution of allele frequencies (shown as

217

horizontal bands of dots in Fig. 4) provides an estimate for the relative contribution of

218

Numts to the data mapping to each mitochondrial assembly.

219

This assumption is supported by the very close correlation (R2=0.93, p=0.001) between the

220

maximum allele frequency and the proportion of reads (A) which are not mitochondrial-like.

221
222

PacBio data

223

The estimate of M from the PacBio data was estimated as follows. CCSs aligning only

224

partially (< 95%) were considered Numt-derived. Reads matching along > 95 % of their

225

length were considered full-length matches. For these, alignment error profiles were

226

compared to the reads’ phred quality scores. If an alignment contained significantly more

mismatches than expected (5 % confidence interval, one-sided, Bonferroni-corrected for 59

228

alignments), it was considered a Numt sequence. The remainder of the full-length matches

229

were provisionally classified as mitochondrial, belonging to fraction M.

Results

236

Six mitochondrial genome assemblies

237

We assembled the mitochondrial genome sequences of six individuals of Podisma pedestris

238

(each of our short-read genome-skimming datasets) using contigs produced by the

239

RepeatExplorer pipeline (Novák et al., 2013). RepeatExplorer generates “clusters” of

240

decreasing size corresponding to repetitive DNA sequences in the samples analysed.

241

RepeatExplorer contigs with similarity to the mitochondrial genome of the desert locust,

242

Schistocerca gregaria, were merged in Geneious R9 and a 383-pb direct repeat, which had

243

been collapsed, was adjusted manually after mapping each sample’s reads back to the

244

respective assembly. To check the reliability of this approach, we re-assembled the

245

mitochondrial genome from each data set with NOVOPlasty, yielding essentially the same

246

sequences, the differences being around the control region; for example NOVOPlasty did not

247

assemble the repeat in 3 cases.

248

Each of our assemblies is 16,008 bp in length. The average mapping depth varies between

249

samples from several hundred to few thousand-fold, which could be due to differences in

250

cellular content of mitochondria between individuals (Tab. 1). All genes typically found in

251

animals were identified using the MITOS WebServer v2beta (Fig. 3A). The gene order is

252

collinear with other grasshopper mitochondrial genomes, and the sequences align readily

253

(see alignment in supplementary file S1).

254

The alignment of all six consensus sequences contains 18 variable sites, five of which show

255

population-specific polymorphisms (Fig. 3B). A neighbour-joining tree shows that each

256

population’s individuals have sequences most similar to one other (see tree in

257

supplementary data S2). The PacBio data did not yield enough mitochondria-like sequence

258

to attempt an assembly, see below.

259
260

The amount of ML data differs between sequencing methods

261

The proportion of each dataset with similarity to mitochondrial sequences (mitochondrial-

262

like, ML in Fig. 1) was identified by mapping reads back to the assembly (of sample N1). It

263

can be seen from Tab. 1 that the ML fraction in short read data (proportion of reads) is at

264

least one order of magnitude larger than the ML fraction in long-read data (sum of read

265

lengths) in all samples.

266

High-abundance sequences differ between Illumina and PacBio data

267

Because of the comparatively low coverage of the genome skimming data generated, it is

268

only possible to compare sequences that are very abundant in the libraries sequenced, such

269

as genomic repeats and organelle DNA. In order to compare the data generated by PacBio

270

and Illumina sequencing, we used RepeatExplorer; an pipeline that generates clusters

271

corresponding to high-abundance sequences. If both Illumina and PacBio sequencing were

272

unbiased in their representation of the DNA found in our samples, then each cluster should

273

contain similar proportions of PacBio and Illumina data, corresponding to the amount of

274

data put into RE. The proportion of short-read data in each of the 300 largest clusters is

275

shown in Fig. 3 (on a logarithmic scale). As is commonly seen, the short-read data contain

276

fewer sequences with higher GC content (Ekblom, Smeds, & Ellegren, 2014). While this bias

277

is between ¼ and 4-fold for most clusters, the mitochondrial-like clusters (circles in Fig. 3)

278

show the most extreme values (at least 16-fold enrichment in our short-read data).

Short reads: Polymorphism in individual-specific alignments

281

SNPs were called within each alignment of individual-specific short ML reads. The minimum

282

minor allele frequency set to 1 % to avoid erroneous calls due to sequencing errors. All

283

assemblies contain numerous polymorphic sites with low to medium minor allele

284

frequencies, which can be interpreted as variants present in Numts (dots in Fig. 4). The fact

285

that we find appreciable allele frequencies even though we sequenced only a fraction of

286

each genome, strongly suggests that there a multiple Numt insertions present in each

287

sample. The distributions of these allele frequencies are skewed towards 0 with maxima

288

varying between samples (the extremes are 7 % and 20 % in samples N5 and N6,

289

corresponding to the narrowest and widest band in Fig. 4). Over all samples, there is a

290

correlation between fraction D (distinguishable Numts) and fraction A (without sequence

291

similarity to mitochondrial genomes). The slope of the linear regression represents the

292

genomic proportion of distinguishable Numts in P. pedestris. It is 9×10-04 (p=1.04×10-3) with a

293

standard error of 1×10-4. As expected, the intercept is not significantly different from zero

294

(p=0.805), see Supplemental figure S6.

295

In total, there are four SNPs with frequencies that are clear outliers from the frequency

296

distribution (shown by arrows in Fig. 4). Interestingly, individuals N1 and N3 from Le Blayeul

297

share one such polymorphism at base pair 7567. These high-frequency variants are

298

presumably the signatures of heteroplasmy (as seen by Mao et al., 2014 in bats).

Tangle plots: Atypical distances between read-pairs as a signature of Numts

301

Paired reads mapped to the mitochondrial assembly could have originated from

302

mitochondrial genomes (M fraction) or from Numts. Those from the M fraction should show

303

intra-pair distances consistent with the libraries’ insert sizes, since the mitochondrial

304

genome is highly conserved. Conversely, Numt sequences may have been subject to

305

insertions, deletions, or rearrangements resulting in longer distances between map locations

306

on the mitochondrial genome or discordant read orientations. The majority of intra-pair

307

differences fell into a distribution with a maximum around 400 bp representing the

308

sequencing insert size (supplemental data S3). There is a second (much shallower) peak

309

above 15,000 bp resulting from mapping reads generated from circular molecule to a

310

linearised reference.

311

There is a small subset of read pairs with intermediate mapping distances that might be

312

attributed to Numt sequences containing deletions or rearrangements. Fig. 5 shows each of

313

these intermediate read pairs (those with an intra-pair distance between 1500 bp 14,508 bp)

314

as a line connecting the paired reads’ positions resulting in “tangle plots”. Interestingly,

315

some of the lines shown cluster together. Given the low sequencing coverage, this strongly

316

suggests the presence of multiple copies of some Numts. Some patterns are shared across

317

multiple samples, but the overall patterns are not population-specific (a linear discriminant

318

analysis failed to assign all individuals to the correct populations, not shown here).

319
320
321

Mapping PacBio reads

322

PacBio circular consensus sequences (CCS) generated from DNA of three individuals

323

(samples P1-P3) were mapped to the mitochondrial assembly. Out of 297,899 non-

324

redundant reads generated in total, 443 showed similarity to the mitochondrial assembly

325

with a cumulative mapping length of 396,770 bp. Of these, most reads matched the

326

mitochondrial reference only along a part of their length, a pattern expected for short

327

Numts and also chimeric PacBio read (which we expect to be rare). The alignments cover

328

263,635 bp, which corresponds to 0.027 % of the total CCS data generated. There were only

329

59 PacBio CCSs matching full-length, of which 41 were sufficiently diverged from the

330

mitochondrial sequence to meet or criterion for classification as Numts. These align along

331

96,210 bp corresponding to 0.01 % of the (non-redundant) PacBio data generated. The

332

remaining 18 full-length matches could be derived from mitochondrial genomes, but they

333

may well be derived from Numts inserted recently. Covering 36,925 bp, these ambiguous

334

CCSs represent only 9.3 % of the ML fraction in the PacBio data.

335

Interestingly, the mapping depth of full-length matches has a bimodal distribution. While the

336

18 ambiguous matches contribute mostly to the first peak, Numt-derived CCSs map to the

337

areas under both peaks (see Fig. 6).

338

Discussion

339

Both mitochondrial (M) and Numt (C+D) sequence are generated as side-products of

340

sequencing experiments, analgous to by-catch on fishing trawlers. We investigated these

341

sequences using genome-skimming data (less than ⅓x genomic coverage) from the

342

grasshopper, Podisma pedestris, using Illumina’s NextSeq and PacBio’s RSII platforms with

343

six and three biological replicates, respectively

344

By-catch differs between sequencing methods

345
346

One of the most striking results is that the Illumina data had over 16-fold higher frequency of

347

reads mapping to the mitochondrial clusters than the PacBio data, suggesting that the

348

Illumina protocol produced a correspondingly higher proportion of sequences from the

349

mitochondria (the M fraction), at some point between extraction and data interpretation.

350

This bias cannot be explained by the known general over-representation of sequences with

351

low-GC sequences in Illumina reads (Ekblom et al., 2014), as shown by the deviation of the
17

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/739805; this version posted August 20, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

352

mitochondrial clusters from the general trend in Fig. 3. The result is reinforced by the

353

comparable bias shown in the estimates of the proportion of mitochondrial sequences

354

classified as Numts (fraction D/ML). This value is also much higher in the PacBio data than

355

the Illumina. In the PacBio case, the two D categories sum to 91% of ML (the D estimate is

356

obtained from the length of the mitochondrial portion of partially matching PacBio sequence

357

plus the length of diverged full-length matches). In the Illumina data, the D estimates

358

obtained from the frequencies in Figure 4 are much smaller, lying between 7% and 20% of

359

ML.

360

This enrichment could be due to the greater retention of mitochondrial sequence (fraction

361

M) in the preparation of the short-read libraries. Short-read libraries are usually fragmented

362

and size selected to produce a distribution of fragments around 350-550 bp long, which will

363

include fragments of the mitochondrial genome. On the other hand library preparation for

364

long-read sequencing involves more careful shearing and a subsequent size selection for

365

longer fragments (around 3-4 kbp in this case). This may cause mitochondrial genomes,

366

starting at 16kbp before shearing, to be differentially lost from PacBio libraries while Numts,

367

being part of the nuclear DNA, would be represented in their natural proportion.

368

Estimating the genomic proportion of Numts

369

Building on the results presented above, there are two ways of estimating the genomic

370

proportion of Numts in genome skimming data, which are possible even in the absence of a

371

genome assembly. It is shown in Supplemental Information S6 that for our short-read data,

372

there is a good correlation (R²=0.93) between the proportions of Numt-derived data reads

373

(fraction D) and non-ML data (fraction A). The slope of this regression corresponds to the
18

374

estimated genomic proportion. It is 0.09 %. This is a lower-bound estimate, because it is

375

based on sequence divergence between Numts and the mitochondrial genomes sequence.

376

The estimate based on PacBio CCSs is somewhat lower; ML CCSs with divergent sequences

377

amount for 0.01% of the PacBio data. Another class of CCSs, which match only along part of

378

their sequence, are likely to represent Numts, too, however there is a small chance that

379

some of them are derived from chimeric SMRT bells. These sequences amount for 0.027% of

380

the PacBio data, giving a total of 0.037%.

381

Genome size and Numt content

382

P. pedestris has the largest genome of any insect listed in the Animal Genome Size Database

383

(Gregory, 2016, accessed 24 June 2019). Its C-value of 16.93 corresponds to 16.5 Gbp

384

(Doležel, Bartoš, Voglmayr, & Greilhuber, 2003). Consequently, a genomic proportion of just

385

under 0.1 % is equivalent to about a thousand full length mitochondrial genomes inserted

386

into the nuclear DNA (this length of sequence is equivalent to an entire Drosophila

387

melanogaster or Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome). Although this is a surprisingly large

388

number, as a proportion of the total genome it is consistent with estimates from other

389

species. Hazkani-Covo et al. (2010) present estimates of Numt contents for a diverse list of

390

85 species ranging from 0 to 0.25% in multicellular organisms. By contrast RepeatExplorer

391

analyses suggest repeats account for approximately 70 % of the P. pedestris genome,

392

including transposable elements able to excise and re-insert themselves, providing a

393

mechanism for copy-number increase.

394

Tangle plots

395

In Fig. 5, we show tangle plots, which allow visual comparisons between Numts in multiple

396

samples. The repeated occurrence of the same links within a sample suggest that rearranged

397

mitochondrial sequence has been replicated within a single genome (the low coverage of <

398

⅓x makes repeated sequencing of the same region unlikely). The similar patterns in different

399

individuals and populations suggest that many of these replicated insertions are fixed or

400

occur at a high frequency. Given that they are unlikely to be functional, it is most plausible

401

that they have spread by genetic drift.

402

Tangle plots can be used to visualise any short-read data sets mapped to a circular (or

403

tandem-repetitive) reference, see Supplemental Information S7.

Figure 1. Fractionation of sequencing data. Of all the sequencing data generated from one
sample, some fraction N will originate from the nuclear DNA and some fraction M from the
mitochondrial DNA, and other sequences. The nuclear fraction N may contain Numts. Some
of these will have sequences divergent from M and hence are easily identifiable (fraction D).
Other Numts may be cryptic, e.g. recent insertions, (fraction C). Together, Numts and
mitochondrial sequences for the fraction ML “mitochondrial-like”.

Figure 3. Enrichment for short or long reads plotted against GC-content for 300
RepeatExplorer clusters. Symbols right of the centre indicate high-abundance DNAs enriched
in the short-read data. There is a general trend for enrichment in PacBio data for clusters
with higher GC-content (regression line). Mitochondrial-like clusters, which show the
strongest bias, are indicated as circles, rDNA as crosses. Data points with a leverage greater
than three times the mean leverage are shown in red. These were excluded from the final
regression (dashed line).

Figure 4. Polymorphisms within alignments. For each individual, the minor allele frequencies
and positions of SNPs are shown as dots. Note, the dots generally form bands with widths
differing between samples. There are few outliers, marked with arrows, likely indicating
heteroplasmy. Individuals N1 and N3 share such a polymorphism at base pair 7567. The lines
indicate per-base pair mapping depths.

Figure 5. Tangle plots. The position of read pairs mapped with unusual read distances is
indicated by a line connecting the read locations. For ease of comparison, 16 positions are
labelled on each graph. Note common patterns between individuals. For instance, all
individuals in the Col de Mariaud population show several read pairs connecting positions
3/4 and 11. All samples of both populations show read pairs connecting segments 3/4 and 7.
