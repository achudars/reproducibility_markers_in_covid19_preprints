ABSTRACT

CRISPR technology has opened up many diverse genome editing possibilities in human
somatic cells, but has been limited in the therapeutic realm by both potential off-target
effects and low genome modification efficiencies. Recent advancements to combat
these limitations include delivering Cas9 nucleases directly to cells as highly purified
ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) instead of the conventional plasmid DNA and RNA-based
approaches. Here, we extend RNP-based delivery in cell culture to a less characterized
CRISPR format which implements paired Cas9 nickases. The use of paired nickase
Cas9 RNP system, combined with a GMP-compliant non-viral delivery technology,
enables editing in human cells with high specificity and high efficiency, a development
that opens up the technology for further exploration into a more therapeutic role.

Introduction

Genome modification efficiency has increasingly become the focus for new
technology development as genome editing has gained more widespread adoption.
CRISPR systems, naturally present in various bacterial and archeal species as
adaptable immune systems, are currently being adapted for genome editing in a wide
variety of cellular and multi-cellular organisms1,2. The system works using CRISPRassociated (Cas) nucleases that are guided to a specific DNA sequence by a
complementary guide RNA, where a genome cleavage event occurs1,2. The primary
advantage of CRISPR systems over zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription
activator-like effector nucleases (TALENS) relates to its RNA-guided nature that
enables easy programming to nearly any genomic target sequence. Designing a
CRISPR guide RNA is much more affordable and practical than engineering a new ZFN
or TALEN protein, leading to CRISPR’s increasing adoption as a technology1,2. Since its
initial discovery in bacteria, CRISPR has been adapted to work in a multitude of
different cell types, including yeast, plants, and mammals2–5.
The development of CRISPR systems has not stopped at just expanding
applications to new varieties of cell types and model organisms. As therapeutic
applications have developed, concerns have been raised about the specificity of
CRISPR-based genome modifications. With enough complementarity between the
intended site and a genomic site at another location, off-target cleavage has been
shown to occur with the most popular variety of Cas nuclease from Streptococcus

pyogenes (SpCas9)6–8. This off-target activity has prompted the development of multiple
modifications to make high efficiency versions of SpCas9, which possess a relaxed
binding efficiency shown to result in higher on-target fidelity without loss in overall
cleavage efficiency9,10. Another solution that addresses the off-target problem of
SpCas9 is the development of paired SpCas9 nickases. In the paired nickase approach,
SpCas9 has been modified to render one of its nuclease domains non-functional,
causing the protein to make a single-stranded nick rather than a double stranded break
(DSB). Paired with a second Cas9 nickase targeting a proximal location, these two
single-stranded nicks cause a DSB to occur11,12. Off-target sites modified using both
paired gRNA are exceedingly rare, and any off-target sites modified by a single Cas9
nickase are accurately repaired by the cell to render off-target mutagenesis
undectable.6,11–14
The delivery of guide RNA and Cas9 protein to cells is another aspect that has to
be considered when considering the efficiency of CRISPR systems. Conventionally,
plasmids that encode the Cas9 protein and guide sequences have been transfected into
cells via either lipofection or electroporation. These methodologies have the drawbacks
of random integration of the plasmids into the host genome and prolonged expression of
the nucleases and guide sequences, which can cause immune responses and greatly
increase off-target effects, respectively, limiting the effectiveness of the technology for
therapeutic purposes15. In order to improve upon plasmid-based limitations, complexes
comprised of purified recombinant Cas9 protein and guide RNA (RNP) have been
developed for direct delivery to a multitude of different human cell types. These RNPs
have been shown to cut genomic DNA rapidly after delivery and degrade rapidly,

thereby decreasing off-target concerns associated with the stronger Cas9-gRNA
expression characteristic of plasmid-based systems15–19.
In this study, we demonstrate the effective combination of paired nickase and
RNP formats in genome editing of human cells, including primary T cells, with high
efficiency and specificity.

Materials and Methods

Cas9 Proteins, tracrRNA, crRNA and sgRNA

Recombinant SpCas9-D10A nickase proteins were expressed and purified from
E. coli, and now are available in MilliporeSigma. Wild-type SpCas9 protein, tracrRNA,
crRNA, and single-gRNA (sgRNA) were all sourced from MilliporeSigma.

RNP Formation

To form the RNPs, first all three parts (Cas9 Protein, tracrRNA and crRNA) or
two parts (Cas9 protein and sgRNA) were resuspended to a concentration of 30μM in
either the supplied resuspension solution or 10 mM Tris buffer with a pH of 7.5. They
were then assembled in an 11 μL mixture at a molar ratio of 5:5:1
(crRNA:tracrRNA:Cas9 protein) or a 4 µL mixture at 3:1 (sgRNA:Cas9 protein) and left
at room temperature for 5-15 minutes immediately before use.

In vitro DNA cleavage

In vitro activity of Cas9 nickase protein was evaluated by measuring the
relaxation of supercoiled pUC19 plasmid DNA (MilliporeSigma). The reaction (30 µL)
contained 3nM DNA and Cas9-nickase RNP in 20 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM
MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 6.5, for 30 min at 37°C. Samples were electrophoresed by
running them on a 1% agarose gel (MilliporeSigma) in TAE buffer (MilliporeSigma).
Percent digestion was calculated by measuring the intensity of supercoiled and relaxed
bands with ImageQuant LAS 400 (GE), referred to their percentage in the same assay
without gRNA, the negative control.

Cell Culture

The human K562 cells were acquired from ATCC and were maintained in a
modified DME (MilliporeSigma) with 10% FBS (MilliporeSigma), 2% Glutamine
(MilliporeSigma), and an antibiotic mix of penicillin and streptomycin (MilliporeSigma).
The K562 cells were split 1 day prior to transfecting and transfections were performed at
~1 million cells per ml.
Human primary CD8+ T cells were purchased from STEMCELL Technologies
Inc. Cells were maintained in Stemline® T Cell Expansion Medium (MilliporeSigma)
supplemented with 10% human AB serum (MilliporeSigma), 1x GlutaMAX™ (Gibco),
8ng/mL IL-2 (Gibco), and 50 µM β-mercaptoethanol (MilliporeSigma). Cells were
stimulated with Dynabeads™ Human T-Expander CD3/CD28 (Gibco) 7 days prior to

nucleofection. Cells were cultured in the presence of Dynabeads™ post nucleofection
according to manufacturer’s protocol.
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from
leukapheresis blood product (Hemacare), then suspended in X Vivo 15 medium (Lonza)
with 100U/ml of IL-2 (R&D Systems). T Cells were stimulated with Dynabeads™ Human
T-Expander CD3/CD28 (Gibco). The cells were cultured in GRex (Wilson Wolfe) 6 well
dishes at 4-5 million per ml for 2 to 3 days before transfection with the MaxCyte® Flow
Electroporation™ system.

Transfection

For K562 cells, enough cells were obtained for approximately 350K cells per
transfection, while for the CD8+ human primary T cells 500K cells per transfection were
used. Transfection was done using the 4D-Nucleofector™ System (Lonza) with the
entire RNP mix added to 100μl of cells before using the manufacturer recommended
protocol for the cell line. For the paired nickase tests, two nickase RNPs (each contains
one of the paired crRNAs) were formed separately and both added to the cells
simultaneously immediately before transfection. The cells were plated on 12-well plates
with 1.5ml complete growth media per well and incubated at 37°C before DNA analysis.
Transfection of PBMCs was completed using the MaxCyte electroporation system.

CEL-I Analysis of CRISPR/Cas9 Cleavage Activity

Genomic DNA was extracted from the cells using QuickExtract DNA Extraction
Solution (Epicentre) following the protocol of the manufacturer and the target sites were
PCR amplified using the primers listed in the supplement ordered from MilliporeSigma.
The CEL-I Assay, a mismatch-nuclease based assay that detects single-base
mismatches or small insertions or deletions, was performed using the Surveyor
Mutation Detection Kit (IDT) according to its instructions. First, the PCR amplicons go
through a denaturing and annealing step in the thermocycler after amplification to form
a heteroduplex, followed by a digestion with the Nuclease and Enhancer proteins at
42°C before being electrophoresed on a 10% TBE Gel (Thermofisher). The gel was
then stained in 100 ml 1x TBE buffer with 2 µl of 10 mg/ml ethidium bromide for 5 min,
then washed with 1x TBE buffer and visualized with a UV illuminator. The resulting
bands were analyzed using Image J software.

TOPO Cloning

The PCR amplicon obtained for the CEL-I assay was also ligated with the
pCR™2.1-TOPO® vector (Thermofisher) using the manufacturer’s recommended
protocol. The ligation products were then used for transformation into One Shot™

TOP10F´ Chemically Competent E. coli (Thermofisher) and 20 colonies were
sequenced via Sanger sequencing using universal primer M13R.

Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)

JumpStart™ REDTaq® ReadyMix™ Reaction Mix (MilliporeSigma) along with
primers flanking the genomic cut site of EMX1 and PD1 were used for PCR
amplification. Primers were tagged with a partial Illumina adapter sequences using the
primers found in the supplement. The thermal cycling conditions included a heat
denaturing step at 95°C for 5 minutes followed by 34 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, anneal at
67.7°C for 30 s, and extension at 70°C for 30 s. Amplification was followed by a final
extension at 70C for 10 min and a cool down to 4°C.
A limited-cycle PCR was carried out to index the amplified PCR product. A total
reaction volume of 50 µL included 25 µL JumpStart™ REDTaq® ReadyMix™ Reaction
Mix (MilliporeSigma), 5 µL of amplified PCR product, 10 µL H2O, and 5 µL each of 5 µM
Nextera XT Index 1 (i7) and Index 2 (i5) oligos. The thermal cycling conditions
consisted of an initial heat denature at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 8 cycles of 95°C for
30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s. A final extension was carried out at 72°C for 5
min and the reaction was cooled down to 4°C. PCR purification was carried out using
AxyPrep™ Mag PCR beads (Corning) and 25 µL of indexed sample at an 8:1 bead-to
PCR ratio. DNA was eluted in 25 µL of 10mM Tris.

PicoGreen fluorescent dye (Invitrogen) was used for quantification of indexed
samples. Purified indexed PCR was diluted to 1:100 with 1xTE. PicoGreen was diluted
according to manufacturer’s protocol (50 µL PicoGreen + 10mL 1xTE). Equal volume of
diluted PicoGreen was added to the diluted indexed PCR sample yielding a final 1:1
dilution ratio in a fluorescence plate reader. Samples were excited at 475 nm and read
at 530 nm. All samples were normalized to 4nM with 1xTE, and 6 µL of each
normalized sample was collected and pooled.
Stock 10M NaOH was serial diluted with H2O to yield a final 1:100 dilution (.1M
NaOH) the day of library preparation. To denature the DNA, 5 µL of .1M NaOH and 5µL
of the pooled 4nM library were mixed together in an Eppendorf tube and incubated at
RT for 5 minutes. 990 µL of cold Illumina HT1 buffer was added to the denatured DNA,
yielding a 20pM pooled, denatured library. PhiX (20pM) was thawed and 30 µL was
transferred to a fresh tube. 570 µL of the 20pM library was added to the PhiX resulting
in 5% PhiX for library diversification, quality control for cluster generation, sequencing,
and alignment. This was mixed and heat shocked at 96C for 2 minutes and then
immediately placed on ice. A 300 cycle v2 Miseq reagent cartridge was thawed in an
ice water bath and inverted to mix. A Miseq v2 flow cell was rinsed thoroughly with
water and ethanol and dried with a Kimwipe making sure that all liquid was removed
and no salt was detected on the surface of the cell. A p1200 tip was used to pierce the
foil of well 17 of the thawed reagent cartridge. Using a new tip, 600 µL of the PhiX
containing library was added to well 17. Following the run, .bam files were used for
analysis with IGV software.

Sanger Trace Analysis to Quantify Insertions / Deletions (indels)

Genomic DNA was extracted from the cells using QuickExtract DNA Extraction
Solution (Epicentre) or PureLink Solution (Invitrogen) following the protocol of the
manufacturer. Target-specific PCR products were sequenced by GENEWIZ and Sanger
traces analyzed for increased sequence heterogeneity to characterize indel levels and
location.

Flow Cytometry

About 1 million cells were washed once with flow cytometry staining buffer (BD
Biosciences) by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min, resuspended in 100 µL of the same
buffer, and then incubated for 30 minutes with 20 µL of anti-PD1 antibody (BD
Biosciences). The cells were washed once again. After incubation with 7-AAD viability
dye (eBioscience) for 5 min, samples were run on Beckman Coulter CytoFLEX flow
cytometer. Analysis of the flow cytometry data was done by using FlowJo software,

Results

Genome editing with paired SpCas9-nickase RNPs in human K562 cells

Our first step in evaluating the paired nickase RNP format was to determine if it
was able to cleave DNA in vitro. We found that when the SpCas9 nickase was formed
into an RNP it was able to relax on average 90% of supercoiled pUC19 plasmid DNA
that it targeted, compared to the immeasurable activity of the individual components
alone (Supplementary Figure S1).
Next we tested paired nickase RNPs in human K562 cells, known in our hands to
be an excellent first pass option for evaluating new ZFN and CRISPR molecular
systems. We first tested multiple crRNA targets for the EMX1 locus using SpCas9
RNPs to determine if targeting these sites with a wild-type SpCas9 protein was able to
generate any genomic insertion / deletions (indels), and found multiple viable target
sites to move forward with (data not shown). We then delivered the paired SpCas9nickase RNP complexes via nucleofection into K562 cells and harvested the genomic
DNAs for detection of genomic modification.
TOPO cloning assays detected sequence modification at the expected target
sites associated with the paired nickase RNP treatments (data not shown). Next a CEL-I
assay was performed, and detected efficient genome editing with paired nickase RNPs,

at levels similar to those from wide-type SpCas9 RNP; as expected, no indels were
detected from nickase RNPs with targeted using a single crRNA (Figure 1A).
We evaluated multiple loci using paired nickase RNPs, and for some samples the
CEL-I assay was not able to yield clear results due to the smeared bands in the gel (one
example is shown in Figure 1B (lane 5). We hypothesized that indels caused by the
paired nickase RNPs happen across a much wider region, compared to those caused
by a single SpCas9 nuclease. In order to measure accurate indels resulting from paired
nicks, we applied Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) which clearly detected expected
genome modifications (Figure1C). NGS analysis confirmed that the paired nickase
RNPs induced genome modifications in between the paired nicking sites. Moreover,
Cas9-nickase RNPs guided by a single crRNA sequence yielded NGS results
indistinguishable from the control DNA, confirming the necessity of two proximal nicks to
generate detectable indels (Figure 1D) and suggesting low chances of genome
modification at off-target sites modified by Cas9-nickases guided by a single crRNA.

Genome editing with paired SpCas9-nickase RNPs in primary human T cells and
PBMCs.

Next we investigated the ability of our paired SpCas9-nickase RNP system to
modify a more clinically relevant human genomic target encoding the protein
programmed death-1 (PD-1). Targeting this gene has been shown to be an effective
approach for checkpoint inhibition, which can have applications in developing T-cell

based therapies20. Before testing in T cells, we again tested in human K562 cells to
determine the efficiency of particular gRNA designs in the absence of potential cellular
delivery limitations that might be associated with unique aspects of T-cells sourced from
various patients and vendors. We designed three pairs of PD-1 crRNAs, which all
yielded detectable genome modification at the target loci when complexed and
delivered with SpCas9 nickases and tracrRNAs (data not shown). When applying these
three paired nickase RNPs into human primary CD8+ T cells, we observed either
undetectable or very weak genome editing at targeted loci. We then optimized our
nickase RNP system with chemically modified single gRNA (mod-sgRNA), instead of
two part gRNA (tracrRNA + crRNA). Mod-sgRNA worked significantly better than two
parts tracrRNA + crRNA for paired nickase RNP in human primary CD8+ T cells,
measured by Sanger trace analysis (Supplementary Figure S2). Mod-sgRNAs were
then used for all following experiments in T cells.
To demonstrate feasibility of using nickase RNPs for therapeutic applications, we
transfected the reagents into human primary hematopoietic cells using a clinically
validated, GMP-compliant electroporation technology: Paired nickase RNPs were
delivered into human primary PBMCs using the MaxCyte GTx Flow Electroporation
system. About 50% indels were generated by nickase RNP pair 2 mod-sgRNAs (PD-1
mod-sgRNA-C+D), even higher than those from the best SpCas9-RNP (with PD-1 modsgRNA-C) (Figure 2A). Similar to previous results, no indels were detected from either
nickase RNP targeted by a single mod-sgRNA, while high indels were found in the
paired delivery (Figure 2B).

Next, we determined if genome modifications to the PD-1 locus by paired nickase
RNPs are associated with reductions in PD-1 protein expression levels in cells. Paired
nickase RNP (with PD-1 mod-sgRNA pair 2) was again delivered to human primary
PBMCs through MaxCyte electroporation. At variant time points, cells were stained with
anti-PD-1 antibody for flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Figure 2C (and
Supplementary Figure S3), at 48 hours after paired nickase RNP treatment, a reduction
of PD-1 protein expression levels was easily detected; and further reduction occurred
with longer time treatment. Less than 20% PD-1 FACS signal was left 120 hours
following electroporation of paired nickase RNPs. Unexpectedly, paired nickase RNPs
were more effective than SpCas9-RNP at reducing PD-1 protein FACS signal,
especially after 120 hours treatment. Our previous data indicated indels caused by
paired nickase RNPs happens in a wide region spanning both guide targets. Compared
with typical SpCas9 nucleases using one gRNA, this wider region of indels caused by
paired nickase RNPs could lead to more efficient knockout of gene functionality by
deletion of additional amino acid residues or changes in mRNA structure which enhance
mRNA destruction mechanisms such as non-sense mediated decay.
In addition to PD-1, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte protein 4 (CTLA4), T-cell
immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM-3; also called hepatitis A virus
cellular receptor 2, HAVCR2) and T-cell receptor alpha constant (TRAC) are all
emerging targets in the cancer immunotherapy landscape21-24. Sets of paired gRNAs
were designed for these targets and pre-screened in K562 cells (data not shown). The
best of these gRNA pairs generated efficient genome editing on all three gene targets in
human primary CD8+ T cells (Figure 2D).

Discussion

The CRISPR-Cas9 system is still in the early stages of development for clinical
applications. The full potential of the technology is still being developed with different
versions and methods coming into relevance as researchers across the world explore
variations. The paired nickase version of Cas9 is one such variation that uses a
modified Cas9 to make two single-stranded complementary cuts in DNA to form a DSB.
Because this method uses two independent guides, the production of permanent
genome modifications is highly site specific11,12. Here we report the successful
combination of paired Cas9 nickases and RNP-based CRISPR delivery15,17. We have
shown above that our paired nickase RNP system has high activity at a variety of
targets in multiple cell types. In addition, our paired nickase RNP system also only
produces genomic indels when Cas9 nickase RNPs are paired and co-delivered into the
cell with two proximal gRNA, eliminating the chance of off-target indel activity. The
combination of a highly specific and highly efficient Cas9 system can allow the
technology to be better suited for therapeutic or clinical use. A previous publication
(Gopalappa et. al., 2018) also suggested that paired Cas9-D10A nickases sometimes
could be more efficient than individual nuclease for gene disruption, although their
results were based on a plasmid Cas9-nickase system rather than our RNP system14.
One potential application for paired nickase RNPs is to modify gene targets to
improve ex vivo cell-based immunotherapy, a powerful treatment option that harnesses
the immune system to fight cancer, infection, and other diseases. Conventional

immunotherapy comprises the use of substances such as vaccines, monoclonal
antibodies, cytokines, etc. to stimulate or suppress the immune system and other
compounds. In recent years, genome editing is being used to modify the DNA of cells to
engineer better functioning cells for use in immunotherapy22-25. The PD-1 receptor, one
of the key checkpoint inhibitors for cancer immunotherapies, is bound on activated Tcells by the ligand PD-L1 on some tumor cells as a negative regulator20. The antitumor
effect of tumor reactive T-cells can be improved by blocking the PD-1 receptor,
increasing the immune response instead of inducing cell death directly25. This
checkpoint inhibition has been accomplished with a variety of methods so far, ranging
from blocking antibodies to knockout using zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) or transcription
activator-like effector nucleases (TALENS)20. Now with the development of Cas9
systems, both plasmid and RNP versions of Cas9 systems have also been
demonstrated to be effective in targeting the site before18,20.
We have demonstrated here that a paired nickase RNP delivery system is able to
produce targeted genomic modifications in multiple immune-related genes, including
PD-1, CTLA4, TIM-3 and TRAC in human primary T-cells with high specificity and
efficiency. Further supporting clinical feasibility, efficient gene knockout was exhibit
following delivery via a GMP compliant, scalable electroporation platform. As stated
above, the increased specificity and efficiency with our paired nickase RNP system,
combined with optimized cellular delivery methods, create a promising alternative for

Figure 1. Genome editing with paired SpCas9 Nickase RNP in K562 cells. Paired
SpCas9 nickase RNPs, along with SpCas9 RNPs, were transfected into K562 cells. (A)
CEL-I analysis for RNP mediated indels at the EMX1 Locus. The cleaved fragments
from SpCas9 RNP treated samples were indicated by red triangles, and the cleaved
fragments from paired SpCas9-nicakse RNP treated samples were indicated by red
trapezoid. Data are representative of three biological replicates. ND, not detected. (B)
CEL-I analysis for RNP mediated indels at the other EMX1 Locus. (C) NGS analysis for
RNP mediated indels at the same Locus as B. Averages from three biological replicates
are plotted with error bars representing one standard deviation. (D) The percent editing
of each single nucleotide around paired crRNAs targeted region measured by NGS
analysis. Data are representative of three biological replicates.
