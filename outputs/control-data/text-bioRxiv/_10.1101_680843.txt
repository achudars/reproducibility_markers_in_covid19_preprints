Abstract
Elucidating the systematic position of two Chinese species described originally as Lactuca hirsuta and
L. scandens, of which only historical specimens from the late 19th and early 20th century were known,
field work confirmed the occurrence of three different species. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of
these species based on sequences of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (nrITS) region
uncovered a hitherto unknown lineage in a phylogenetic backbone of the subtribe Crepidinae of the
sunflower family tribe Cichorieae. Substantiated by comparative morphological studies, this lineage is
described as genus new to science, named Sinoseris, endemic to the Chinese provinces Sichuan and
Yunnan. Two of its three species are new to science, while the third is conspecific with both L.
hirsuta and L. scandens.
Key words: Asteraceae, Crepidinae, new genus, new species, Sinoseris, SW China

Introduction
Investigations into the flora of China have considerably increased our knowledge of the various plant
groups in this country during the last decades and they have also pointed out knowledge gaps
including still insufficiently known taxa. This also applies to the members of tribe Cichorieae of the

largest flowering plant family Asteraceae (sunflower family). One of the least known species in this
tribe was described as Lactuca hirsuta Franch. (Franchet, 1895) from Yunnan and has been known so
far from only a few collections of the late 19th and early 20th century. Shih (1997) assigned it to
Chaetoseris, which was later found to be a congener of Melanoseris (Shih & Kilian, 2011; Wang et
al., 2013; Kilian et al., 2017). Doubts on this systematic position of L. hirsuta were already expressed
by Shih & Kilian (2011). In the context of the general poverty of morphological features coupled with
extensive parallel evolution in this tribe, which renders the recognition of lineages difficult (Kilian et
al., 2009a), the scarcity of fruiting material available for this taxon and the absence of any recent
collection of it so far have hindered re-addressing its systematic position.
The situation changed when the first author discovered new specimens that matched the
description and historical specimens of L. hirsuta from Dayao County collected in the frame of the
fourth national survey of traditional Chinese medicine resources. More in-dept studies, including
special field trips guided by the re-evaluated historical collections disclosed the involvement of
another taxon, described as Lactuca scandens C. C. Chang (1934) and not so far identified with any of
the known species (Shih & Kilian, 2011), and brought to light that actually a separate lineage of three
species, two of them hitherto unknown to science, is involved.
The aims of the study presented in this paper were to test the previous hypotheses of the
systematic position of this taxon and its allies by comparatively studying their morphology and
including them in a molecular phylogenetic analysis, and finally to draw the taxonomic conclusions
from the phylogenetic evidence.

Material and methods
Plant material: The study is based on life plants observed and documented in the field during two
field trips made to Sichuan and Yunnan in 2017 and 2018 as well as on newly collected and historical
specimens of Lactuca hirsuta and its allies. Historical specimens were studied from the herbaria of
GH, LBG, P, PE and W. Newly collected specimens were deposited in KUN, with duplicates in B and
PE. For comparative morphological studies of L. hirsuta and allies on one hand and related genera on
the other hand the herbarium collections in B, KUN and PE were consulted.

Morphological studies: For scanning electron microscopy, achenes and pollens were directly mounted
onto SEM stubs on double-sided sticky tape, coated with 20 nm Pt-Pd using a Cressington 108Auto
sputter-coater and examined using a ZEISS SIGMA 300.

Sampling, DNA extraction, amplification, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis: Multiple samples of
all three species were sequenced and included in the molecular phylogenetic analysis (see Table 1)
based on the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (nrITS) using otherwise already published
sequences. The sampling was designed to represent all genera of the Crepidinae (except for the
extremely rare monotypic Spiroseris of Pakistan of which no sequence data are available) and its sister
subtribe Chondrillinae (see Kilian et al., 2009b+; for the up-do-date systematics). Launaea sarmentosa
(Hyoseridinae) as used as outgroup and root of the phylogenetic trees. INSDC (International
Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration) accession numbers of published sequences follow the
taxon name in the tree (Fig. 1). Extraction of DNA and amplification and sequencing of the nrITS
region was done as described by Wang et al. (2013). Sequences were aligned with MAFFT version 7
using default parameters (Katoh et al., 2013) and the alignment adjusted manually using PhyDE
version 0.9971 (Müller et al., 2010). Indels were coded as binary characters using simple indel coding
(Simmons & Ochoterena, 2000) implemented in SeqState v.1.40 (Müller, 2005a). The matrix was
subdivided into four partitions: ITS1, 5.8s, ITS2, indels. Phylogenetic relationships were reconstructed
using maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI). MP was
performed with the parsimony ratchet using PRAP v.2.0 (Müller, 2004) with default parameters in
combination with PAUP v.4.0b10 (Swofford, 2003); Jackknife (JK) support values were calculated in
PAUP with 10,000 jackknife replicates using the TBR branch swapping algorithm with 36.788% of
characters deleted and one tree held during each replicate. ML analyses were done with RaxML
(Stamatakis, 2014) in the version of RAxMLHPC v.8 on XSEDE on the CIPRES Science Gateway
(Miller et al., 2010), using rapid bootstrapping integrated with the ML search for the optimal tree
applying the general time-reversible (GTR) + Γ model. The BI analyses were performed with the MPI
version of MrBayes (Ronquist et al., 2012) on the Soroban high-performance computing system of the

Freie Universität Berlin. Instead of apriori testing, the optimal substitution model was sampled across
the entire general time reversible (GTR) model space in the Bayesian MCMC analysis (Huelsenbeck
et al., 2004). Two simultaneous runs of four parallel chains each were performed for 3 × 107
generations with a sample frequency of 1 tree per 2000 generations. Convergence of the runs was
checked by making sure that the average standard deviation of split frequencies of the post-burn-in
runs was below 0.01 and the effective sampling size (ESS) well above 200 in either run for all
parameters. TreeGraph v.2 (Stöver & Müller, 2010) was used to visualise the trees with statistical
node support.

Results
The nrITS phylogeny (Fig. 1) places the species originally described as Lactuca hirsuta and its two
allies separate from all other genera into a well-supported clade (JS = 98.1, PP = 1, BS = 70) of the
large, chiefly E Asian Dubyaea-Nabalus-Soroseris-Syncalathium polytomy. Finding the three species
nested in one clade agrees with the conspicuous overall morphological similarity of them. The sister
group relationship (with full statistical support) of two of them (Fig. 1 as Sinoseris scandens and S.
triflora), also corresponds with the stronger morphological similarity between these two species
compared to the third (Fig. 1, as S. changii), which is apparent in particular with respect to achene
morphology and the larger capitula.
The three species of this clade are also morphologically clearly distinct from the other members
of the Dubyaea-Nabalus-Soroseris-Syncalathium polytomy. Diagnostic for this clade is a
synflorescence of secund, subspiciform to paniculiform paracladia, the involucre with very few,
inconspicuous outer phyllaries, beaked achenes with more than two secondary ribs per main rib and a
dirty white to pale brownish pappus of moderately coarse, scabrid bristles (Table 2).
Consequently, this lineage is best classified as an own genus, for which we have chosen the name
Sinoseris (see Taxonomy, below). The genus is endemic to China, where its species are restricted to
Yunnan and Sichuan (Fig. 2). Only the most widespread of the three species has been known to
science so far. Its original name Lactuca hirsuta is illegitimate as a younger homonym of a name
coined much earlier for a species of North America. The Chinese species was described a second time

40 years later by Chao Chien Chang (1900–1972) as L. scandens, a name that has to be taken now as
basionym for this species. The conspecifity of both taxa was blurred, however, by infraspecific
variation and incorrectly described features in the protologue of the first name (see Taxonomy, below).
The second species (see Taxonomy below, under S. triflora), hitherto undescribed, was discovered by
us first among the historical specimens from the early 20th century determined as L. hirsuta before we
succeeded to recollect it from the wild. The third species (S. changii) was not known to us from
historical herbarium material, but ITS sequences published under the name L. scandens (INSDC acc.
no. KF732051 to KF732056, see Fig. 1) and included in our phylogenetic reconstruction were found
nested in the same clade as our sequences of this undescribed species.

Discussion
The Asian-North American Dubyaea-Nabalus-Soroseris-Syncalathium polytomy, in which the clade
with the species under study is nested, is one of six major terminal clades resolved in our phylogenetic
backbone of the subtribe Crepidinae spanning all genera (Fig. 1). This seems surprising in view of
their previous classification as members of Lactuca or the Lactucinae. It must be considered, however,
that the generic concept of Lactuca in the late 19th and early 20th century was extremely wide and
spanned members of several of the modern subtribes (Kilian et al., 2017). Disentangling the subtribes
Lactucinae and Crepidinae has, moreover, proven particularly difficult due to the scarcity of nonhomoplastic morphological synapomorphies (Bremer, 1994).
The Dubyaea-Nabalus-Soroseris-Syncalathium clade has been resolved in several studies with
varying partial representation of its members (Kilian et al., 2009a; Zhang et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2013;
Kilian et al., 2017). Estimations divergence times for the Crepidinae by Zhang et al. (2011) revealed
that the Dubyaea-Nabalus-Soroseris-Syncalathium clade is likely of Pliocene origin, with a crown age
of around 5 myr only; for genera such as Soroseris or Syncalathium a crown age of less than 2 and 3
myr, respectively, have been estimated. The comparatively young age of this clade may be responsible
for the shallow genetic differentiation among many of its members (Zhang et al., 2011), in particular
within lineages such as Soroseris or the Nabalus trifoliatus lineage, as indicated by branch lengths in

Fig. 1. The comparatively deep genetic differentiation between the first sister clades of Sinoseris is all
the more conspicuous.
All three known species of the clade classified here as the new genus Sinoseris are annuals (to,
perhaps, monocarpic biennials) and grow in the subtropical (warm-temperate) highlands of Sichuan
and Yunnan, where they all seem to grow preferably in open rocky habitats. All other members of the
Dubyaea-Nabalus-Soroseris-Syncalathium clade are, in contrast, perennials and confined to the higher
montane or alpine zone (Dubyaea, Soroseris, Syncalathium, “Youngia” racemifera) or more
continental and either colder (Nabalus, Hololeion) or more arid (Sonchella) climates. The Sinoseris
lineage is therefore somewhat outstanding in this clade, which deserves further attention.
The species have been rarely collected so far, which appears surprising as they are not
inconspicuous. Reasons may be their late flowering from late September onwards and their scattered
occurrence, perhaps due to their preference of rocky habitats.

Description: Annual (to monocarpic biennial) herbs, 15–80 cm tall, strongly hirsute of eglandular
reddish-purplish hairs, with a taproot. Stem solitary, or if branched right from the base, plants
seemingly with several stems, erect or arched erect, branching, leafy. Basal and lower cauline leaves
abruptly contracted into a petiole-like portion up to 15 cm long, its base semi-amplexicaul to, more
often, winged and distinctly clasping the stem; lamina broadly triangular, ovate to broadly lanceolate,
or oblanceolate, 3–14 cm long, 2.5–13.5 cm wide, entire to lyrately pinnatisect, with a broadly ovate to
broadly triangular terminal lobe, cordate or obtuse to cuneate at base and acute at apex, and with 1–2
pairs of much smaller triangular to rhombic, acute to obtuse, or up to 5 pairs of very small ovate to
elliptic lateral lobes; lamina margin variably shallowly or deeply sinuate-dentate, often irregularly so,
and denticulate. Middle and upper cauline leaves oblanceolate or ovate to lanceolate, smaller, with
winged or ± without petiole-like basal portion, otherwise similar to lower cauline leaves, base
distinctly clasping. Synflorescence of a flowering stem in well-developed plants with several
paracladia from the axils of the cauline leaves, all subspiciform to narrowly paniculiform and ±
secund, each with a few to more than a dozen capitula pendent in bud, subpendent at anthesis and
pendent again at fruiting. Capitula with (4–)5(–6) florets; peduncle in most cases less than 1 cm long.

plant; outer phyllaries up to 3, very inconspicuous, narrowly linear, 0.9 mm × 0.2 mm; inner phyllaries
usually 5, linear-lanceolate and similar in length, green, sometimes (partly) with a purplish tinge.
Receptacle epaleate, glabrous and smooth. Florets with bright yellow corolla; ligule broadly elliptical
to obovate, ± horizontally spread, 14–16 mm long and up to 3 mm wide, tube c. 6 mm long; anther
tube blackish, fertile part 4.6–4.8 mm long, apical appendages rounded, c. 0.2 mm long, basal
appendages c. 0.6 mm long; style and style arms blackish. Pollen of the Cichorium type (sensu
Blackmore 1986) with triangular, moderately extensive polar areas each with c. 12 spines and with
moderately narrow interlacunar gaps (Fig. 4e–f). Achenes 8–9 mm long, corpus narrowly ellipsoidal to
subconical, subcompressed, dark brown mottled white, covered with linear flattened acute antrorse
papillae, shorter and appressed in the lower two thirds of the corpus, longer and spreading-erect in the
upper third, with 5 main ribs (best discernible near base) alternating with (2–)3(–4) secondary ribs
(fully developed in middle third and then similar in shape to main ribs), apex attenuate into a slender
whitish beak of 3–4 mm (Fig. 4a–d). Pappus c. 6–7 mm long, dirty white to pale brownish, caducous,
bristles of similar length and diameter, near base of 8–14 rows of cells in cross section.

Distribution: NW Yunnan and SW Sichuan.

Habitat and ecology: The species occurs at altitudes between 1750 m and c. 3000 m on rocky slopes
with open grassland vegetation. Fl. and fr. Sep–Nov.

Notes on typification and synonymy: The description in the protologue is detailed and well
corresponds to the type material. The eglandular hirsute reddish indumentum in combination with
capitula of (mostly) 4 or 5 yellow florets, blackish anther tubes and styles, and an involucre of (4 or) 5
inner and very inconspicuous outer phyllaries diagnose the taxon perfectly. The author compares the
species with L. hirsuta Franch. as its “nearest ally”, stating that L. scandens differs from that by a red
(versus “white”, actually “dirty white” [“setis sordidis”]) hispid eglandular (versus mixed eglandularglandular) indumentum, a “white” (versus “dirty white”) pappus, and undivided (versus lyrately
pinnate) leaves. The description of the pappus of L. scandens is contradicting in the protologue: the

Latin description states “setae ... sordide albae”, thus “dirty white” instead of “white”, which agrees
with our observation and also with the description of L. hirsuta. The leaves in L. hirsuta are lyrately
pinnatisect but they are variable within populations, ranging from entire to pinnatisect. The
indumentum in the type specimens of L. hirsuta looks in fact dirty white but this is likely only an
effect of drying; the statement about presence of glandular hairs in the protologue of L. hirsuta seems
erroneous. Also the number of 8 florets per capitulum given in the protologue of L. hirsuta is
apparently erroneous. With the help of the curators in P their number has been confirmed as 5–6. The
number of inner phyllaries is correctly and in agreement with L. scandens given as 5. It can safely be
concluded that both taxa are conspecific.
The gathering of Pére Jean Marie Delavay was made in the mountains above the village
“Tapintze” [= Dapingzi], where Père Delavay lived from August 1882 onwards for some years as
missionary. The village is situated at c. 26.10°N, 100.04°E, some 65 km NE of Dali in the valley
Loulou river, a tributary of the Yangtze, which passes c. 15 km NE (Kilpatrick, 2014: 69, 102;
reproducing a map of the area drawn by P. Delavay). Technically the two sheets of the same gathering
by Père Delavay of Lactuca hirsuta Franch. at P are syntypes so that a lectotype has to be designated.
We have designated the one marked as “holotype”, with the original label of the collector and the
determination in Franchet’s hand.

Threat status: Sinoseris scandens has been collected so far from five separate localities in Sichuan and
Yunnan. Three of them are only known from historical collections made between 1882 and 1932. At
the two current localities, at Gesala <500 individuals have been counted in 2017, and at Ninglang
<100 individuals have been counted in 2018. Population sizes seem to vary, however, considerably
between the years as observed in Gesala comparing 2017 and 2018. A formal threat status assessment
according to the IUCN criteria and categories (IUCN 2001) for this species requires more data on its
actual and historical distribution and population sizes in relation to land use changes. Although the
scarcity of collections of this species may be partly due to its late flowering in the year, S. scandens
seems to have a scattered distribution and be a rare species endemic to some small part of the two
provinces. Its status should be thus of concern and addressed by further investigations.

Habitat and ecology:

The species grown on rocky stream banks and slopes with open bushy

vegetation at altitudes between c. 2200 and 3250 m. Fl. and fr. Sep–Nov.

2018, Chen Yaping, Jiang Lei & Zheng Hailei EM672 (KUN!).

Threat status: The species is known from two historical and three current localities. At these three
populations in the Muli County only 10, 80 and 250 individuals were counted respectively, so that the
population sizes seem in general smaller than the other two species. The species occurs in an only
scattered way in its distribution area, similar to S. scandens, which may be due to its requirement of
open rocky habitats. Nearly a third of the few-flowered capitula of many individuals was found
infected in 2018 by some insects species and did therefore not produce fruits. The species is certainly
rare and of localised distribution. Its status should be thus of concern and addressed by further
investigations.

Zehuan & Chen Yaping WZH20171001 (KUN!, isotypes: B!, KUN!, PE!).

Diagnosis: The species can be easily distinguished from the other two species by involucre with
usually 8 inner phyllaries; capitula with 8–12 florets and 8–12 achenes; anther tube golden yellow to
brownish; achenes abruptly contracted into a slender beak as long as the obconical and below the beak
broad-shouldered corpus.

Description: Annual (to monocarpic biennial) herbs with taproot, 20–100 cm tall, strongly hirsute of
eglandular pale to dark reddish-purplish hairs. Stem solitary, or if branched right from the base, plants
seemingly with several stems, erect, branching, leafy. Basal, lower and middle cauline leaves abruptly
contracted into a petiole-like portion up to 17 cm long with 0–3 pair(s) of lobes, otherwise unwinged,
and with semi-amplexicaul to at most weakly clasping base; lamina rhombic, ovate, triangular or
lanceolate in outline, 3–11 cm long, 3–8 cm wide, entire to lyrately pinnate with 1–2(–3) pair(s) of
smaller acute or obtuse lateral lobes and a large terminal lobe, fresh green on upper and paler, greyish
green on the lower face; margin irregularly sinuate-dentate and denticulate; apex ± acute, base
distinctly cordate. Upper cauline leaves similar to middle ones but smaller, or ± oblanceolate and the
entire or lyrately pinnatifid lamina attenuate into a petiole-like portion much shorter than the lamina,
or ± lanceolate and sessile with semi-amplexicaul to weakly clasping base. Synflorescence of a
flowering stem paniculiform to corymbiform of some to many capitula erect in bud, spreading-erect to
subpendent at anthesis and pendent at fruiting; in well-developed plants with several paracladia from
the axils of the cauline leaves. Capitula with 8–12 florets; peduncles mostly longer than the involucre.
Involucre narrowly cylindrical, 9–14 mm long; strongly differentiated into inner and ± inconspicuous
outer phyllary series; phyllaries abaxially pale to reddish hirsute as remainder of the plant; outer
phyllaries narrowly linear, 2–5, 0.7–1.9 × 0.3 mm; inner phyllaries usually 8, linear-lanceolate and

c. 0.5 mm long; style and style arms pale greyish to blackish. Pollen of the Cichorium type (sensu
Blackmore 1986) with very extensive, approximately hexagonal polar areas, each with >20 spines, and
with moderately narrow interlacunar gaps (Fig. 8e–f). Achenes 6–7 mm long, corpus subconical, with
5 main ribs (best discernible near base) alternating with 3(–4) secondary ribs (fully developed in
middle third and then similar in shape to main ribs), dark brown, with linear flattened antrose papillae,
spreading-erect at the apex and appressed and shorter in the rest, at its widest diameter abruptly
contracted into a slender pale brown, basally appressed papillate beak of about the same length as the
corpus, corpus below the beak broad-shouldered (Fig. 8a–d). Pappus 5–6 mm long, dirty white to pale
brownish, caducous, bristles of similar length and diameter, near base of 7–12 rows of cells in cross
section.

Distribution: Central Yunnan

Habitat and ecology: The species is confined to open rocky habitats. Fl. and fr. Sep–Oct.

Etymology: We dedicate this species to the memory of Chao Chien Chang (1900–1972), one of the
early modern Chinese botanists. He worked at the Kunming Institute of Botany of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, studied on Chinese Asteraceae, in particular these taxa distributed in Yunnan.

Threat status: The occurrence of this species is less scattered and rare compared to the other two
species. Between Tanhua and Wanbi, for example, the species is present in sunny rocky slopes with
high frequency, although the individual populations usually do not exceed a few hundred mature
individuals. Considering its localised distribution in Central Yunnan, its status should be of concern
and addressed by further investigations.
