Abstract: SUMOylation in plants is associated with biotic and abiotic stress responses, flowering and other

16

aspects of development, and ICE1 protein SUMOylation by SUMO E3 ligase SIZ1 plays important roles in

17

plant cold tolerance. Here, we reported the subcellular localization of EcaICE1 and its interaction with

18

EcaSIZ1 in Eucalyptus camaldulensis. The genes EcaICE1 and EcaSIZ1 were isolated by homologous

19

cloning. The subcellular localization analysis showed that EcaICE1 was located in nucleus

20

fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis revealed that EcaICE1 could interact with EcaSIZ1 in the

21

nucleus of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Moreover, yeast two-hybrid assay confirmed that the amino acid

22

region from position 84 to 126 in EcaICE1 was critical for the strong transactivation activity of EcaICE1

23

and that the C terminal region from position 361 to 557 in EcaICE1 was the key region for its interaction

24

with EcaSIZ1 by using different truncated lengths of non-transactivation activity of EcaICE1 as the bait

25

protein. Collectively, our results showed that EcaICE1 may have a SUMOylation pathway similar to

26

Arabidopsis thaliana.

Low temperature is one of the important environmental factors that could restrict the growth and

30

development, geographical distribution and production of plants, and low temperature stress could reduce

31

production in agriculture and forest (Janmohammadi et al. 2015). In order to overcome low temperature stress, a

32

series of complex response mechanisms can be activated at physiological and molecular levels for plants (Shi et

33

al. 2018). Researches reveal that a large number of cold-regulated genes (CORs) are induced after plant cold

34

acclimation. These CORs genes usually contain DRE/CRT cis-acting elements and can be combined by

35

transcription factors CBFs or DREB1s family (Stockinger et al. 1997). CBFs or DREB1s are key transcription

36

factors of low temperature signaling pathway and play important roles in enhancing plant cold tolerance

37

(Chinnusamy et al. 2007). However, CBFs or DREB1s are also induced by low temperature. ICE1 gene has been

38

firstly verified from Arabidopsis thaliana, which can specifically bind to the cis-acting element of MYC

39

promoter of CBF3 and then induce the expression of CBF3 downstream gene (Chinnusamy et al. 2003). After

40

that, a lot of studies reveal that ICE-CBF-COR is the important signal network for plants to adapt to the cold

41

stress (Shi et al. 2018). In Arabidopsis thaliana, ICE-CBF-COR pathway is positively or negatively controlled

42

by some regulators at transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational levels. SIZ1 (Miura et al. 2007)

43

and OST1 (Ding et al. 2015) are positive regulators, while HOS1 (Dong et al. 2006) and MPK3/6 (Li et al. 2017)

44

are negative regulators. The Ub E3 ligase HOS1, can ubiquitinate and degrade ICE1 protein, thereby increase the

45

cold sensitivity of the transgenic plants (Dong et al. 2006). On the contrary, SUMO E3 ligase SIZ1, can enhance

46

the stability of ICE1 protein by SUMOylation and promote the expression of CBF3, and then causes enhanced

47

cold tolerance (Miura et al. 2007). OST1 can interact with ICE1, competed with HOS1, enhancing the stability

48

and transcriptional activity of ICE1, further resulting in increased cold tolerance (Ding et al. 2015). Recently, the

49

protein kinase MPK3/6 can interact with and phosphorylate ICE1, enhancing the degree of ubiquitination of

50

ICE1, but the interaction between HOS1 and ICE1 is not affected, suggesting that the degradation of ICE1

51

protein may be performed by the unknown E3 ligase (Li et al. 2017). Although ICE1 gene had been isolated

52

from A. thaliana (Chinnusamy et al. 2003), Brassica juncea (Wang et al. 2005), Populus suaveolens (Lin et al.

53

2007), wheat (Badawi et al. 2008), banana (ZHAO et al. 2013), E. camaldulensis (Lin et al. 2014), Pyrus

54

ussuriensis (Huang et al. 2015) and Hevea brasiliensis (Deng et al. 2017), the understanding of its positive and

55

negative regulations is still limited in woody plants.

56

Eucalyptus species are the important commercial tree species worldwide. The molecular regulation

57

mechanism of low temperature stress of Eucalyptus could have the potential to increase Eucalyptus plantation

58

range. Eucalyptus CBF genes has been studied (Kayal et al. 2006; Gamboa et al. 2007; Navarro et al. 2009,

59

2011), but the knowledge about ICE1 or ICE1-like modules is still rather limited. Our precious studies have

60

shown that the overexpression of EcaICE1 from E. camaldulensis can enhance the cold tolerance and the

61

expression level of downstream genes in transgenic tobaccos (Lin et al. 2014). However, the studies of

62

subcellular localization, transcription activity and upstream regulators of EcaICE1 remain uncertain. In this study,

63

we analyzed the subcellular localization and the transcription activation region of EcaICE1. Furthermore, the

64

protein interactions between EcaICE1 and EcaSIZ1 were verified by Bimolecular fluorescence complementation

65

(BiFC) and Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays.

Methods and Materials

68

Plant materials

69

The 30-day-old rooting tissue culture plantlets of E. camaldulensis cv. 103 were used in this study. Tissue culture

70

condition was performed as described previously (Lin et al. 2014). Tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) plants

71

were maintained in a growth chamber of 25 ◦C under long day conditions (16/8 h light/dark photoperiod), and

72

5-week-old plants were selected for further subcellular localization and BiFC analysis.

73
74

RNA isolation and Gene cloning

75

Total RNA was extracted as described previously (Lin et al. 2014). 1 μg DNase I-treated RNA was used for

76

synthesizing the first strand cDNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( PrimeScript II 1st Strand

77

cDNA Synthesis Kit; Takara, Dalian, China). The primers of EcaICE1 and EcaSIZ1 (listed as table 1) were

78

designed by homology cloning techniques, and then used for amplifying the aim genes with the first strand

79

cDNA as the template. The PCR process as follows: 95 ◦C for 4 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95 ◦C for 10 s, 58

80

◦

C for 10 s and 72 ◦C for 20 s.

81
82

Bioinformatics analysis of gene sequence

83

The coding sequence (CDS) of EcaICE1 and EcaSIZ1 were predicted using FGENESH 2.6 software

84

( http://linux1.softberry.com/berry.phtml?topic=fgenesh&group=programs&subgroup=gfind ), and further

85

confirmed by BLASTP program on the NCBI website (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). The nuclear

86

localization signals were predicted using ProtComp 9.0 (http://linux1.softberry.com/berry.phtml?topic=

87

protcomppl&group=programs&subgroup=proloc), and the protein secondary domains were searched by Motif

scan (https://myhits.isb-sib.ch/cgi-bin/motif_scan). Finally, sequence alignments with other plants were

89

performed with ClUSTALX software.

91

Subcellular localization of EcaICE1

92

The complete Open Reading Frame (ORF) of EcaICE1 was recombinated to the 5′-terminus of the yellow

93

fluorescent protein (YFP) of the pEarleyGate101 vector with CaMV 35S promoter using primers (listed as table

94

S1). The recombinant vector 35S::EcaICE1-YFP was transferred into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101,

95

further injected into the abaxial surfaces of 5-week-old tobacco with an incubator for 2-3 d. The YFP signal in

96

the leaves of tobacco was examined using confocal microscopy (Olympus BX61, Tokyo, Japan).

97
98

Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay

99

To generate the constructs for BiFC assays, the full-length CDS of EcaICE1 and EcaHOS1 (without their stop

100

codons) were subcloned into pUC-pSPYNE or pUCpSPYCE vectors as described previously (Walter et al.

101

2004). Expressions of target genes alone were used as negative controls. The resulting recombinant vectors were

102

used for transient assays of tobacco leaves as described earlier. The transformed tobacco leaves were then

103

incubated at 22 ◦C for 24–48 h. The YFP signal was observed using a florescence microscope (Zeiss Axioskop 2

104

plus). The primers for BiFC assay were listed in Supporting Information Table S2.

105
106

Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay

107

Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed using the Matchmaker™ gold Yeast two-Hybrid Systems (Clontech).

108

Different truncated CDS of EcaICE1 without transcriptional activation activity and EcaSIZ1 were subcloned into

109

pGBKT7 and pGADT7 vectors to fuse with the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and activation domain (AD),

110

respectively, to create different baits and preys (primers are listed in Supplemental table S3). Then, different

111

pairs of bait and prey recombinants were co-transformed into yeast strain gold Y2H by the lithium acetate

112

method, and yeast cells were grown on SD/-LW medium (minimal media double dropouts, SD medium with

113

-Leu/-Trp) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Clontech) for 3 days. Transformed colonies were plated

114

onto SD/-LWHA medium (minimal media quadruple dropouts, SD medium with-Leu/-Trp/-Ade/-His) containing

115

125-μM Aureobasidin A (AbA), to test for possible interactions among EcaICE1 and EcaSIZ1, according to the

116

yeast cell growth status.

117
118

Transcriptional activation assay

119

The full-length ORF of EcaICE1 and EcaSIZ1 were recombinated into pGBKT7 vector, respectively, and

120

co-transformed into yeast strain gold Y2H. Then we found that both EcaICE1 and EcaHOS1 had strong

121

transcriptional activation activity (results are listed in Supplemental Figure S4). So we further performed

122

transcriptional activation assay for EcaICE1. Different truncated coding regions of EcaICE1 (EcaICE1T1~T6)

123

were recombinated into pGBKT7 vector, then followed Y2H assay, adding 0, 125, 250, and 500 μM AbA, to

124

further discover the critical region of transactivation activity for EcaICE1. The primers were listed in Supporting

125

Information Table S3.

RESULT

128

The gene amplification and sequencing analysis of EcaICE1 and EcaSIZ1

129

The multiple alignments of plant ICE1 protein sequences (Figure 1) shows that the EcaICE1 protein has a highly

130

conserved MYC-like bHLH domain (basic helix-loop-helix) and a zipper structure at the C-terminus, and an

131

S-rich (Serine-rich) acidic domain at the N-terminus. In addition, the SUMO binding site is also present in

132

EcaICE1 and the other two Eucalyptus ICE1, and it is identical to ICE1 from A. thaliana and Capsella

133

buras-pastoris, but slightly different from the other woody plants. Furthermore the 363-381 position of EcaICE1

134

protein is a nuclear localization signal, as shown in the NLS Nuclear localization sequence box, which means

135

that it may be located in the nucleus. However, it is interesting that only Eucalyptus ICE1 proteins have a Q-rich

136

(Glutamine-rich) domain, suggesting that Eucalyptus ICE1 proteins might have different characteristics with the

137

other plants.

138

The amplified EcaSIZE1 cDNA is 2847bp with a full ORF (2616 bp) encoding 872 amino acids. BLAST

analysis illustrates that EcaSIZ1 shares a high sequence identity with other plant SIZ1-like proteins, such as E.

142

(68%, OAO90655), respectively. The multiple alignments of plant SIZ1 protein sequences (Figure 2)

143

demonstrate that EcaSIZ1 protein has a conserved MIZ1/SP zinc finger domain, SAP, PINIT, SXS and

144

PHD, similar to other plant HOS1 proteins. These results show that EcaSIZ1 is the SIZ1 protein from E.

Subcellular localization of EcaICE1

Based on the multiple alignment analysis (Figure 1), there was one potential NLS sequence in the bHLH domain

149

of EcaICE1. To investigate the subcellular localization of EcaICE1 in plant cells, the full-length coding region of

150

EcaICE1 was fused to the N–terminus of the YFP reporter gene under the control of the 35S promoter

151

(35S::EcaICE1-YFP). By transient analysis using tobacco leaf epidermis, the yellow fluorescence of EcaICE1

152

fused-proteins was localized exclusively in the nucleus (Figure 3), indicating that EcaICE1 was a nuclear

153

localized protein, similar to other plant ICE1(Huang et al. 2015; Deng et al. 2017), consistent with the classical

154

role of bHLH as transcriptional regulators in plants (Gabriela et al. 2003).

155
156

EcaICE1 could interact with EcaSIZ1

157

Previous report showed that SIZ1 could interact with ICE1 to regulate its transcriptional activity in A. thaliana,

158

which plays an important role in response to cold stress (Miura et al. 2007). In order to investigate whether

159

EcaSIZ1 could also interact with EcaICE1 in E. camaldulensis, the protein-protein interactions between

160

EcaICE1 with EcaHOS1 were first analysed using BiFC assay in tobacco leaves. The YFP fluorescent signal was

161

observed at the nucleus when EcaICE1-pSPYCE was co-transfected with EcaHOS1-pSPYNE (Figure 4). In

162

contrast, no YFP fluorescent signal was observed in the negative controls including EcaICE1-pSPYCE

163

co-expressed with unfused pSPYNE or EcaHOS1-pSPYNE co-expressed with unfused pSPYCE. These results

164

showed that EcaICE1 could interact with EcaSIZ1 to form heterodimers at the nucleus (Figure 4).

165
166

Transcriptional activation domain of EcaICE1

167

To further discover the protein-protein interaction region between EcaICE1 with EcaHOS1, we performed the

168

Y2H assay. It was surprised that not only EcaICE1 but also EcaHOS1 had strong transactivation activity when

169

their full-length sequences were fused into the pGBKT7 vector and co-transfected with pGADT7 empty vector,

170

respectively (Figure S4). In order to remove the effects of strong transactivation activity on protein-protein

171

interaction, we further characterized which region of EcaICE1 acts as transcriptional transactivation, Y2H assays

172

were carried out using intact or truncated EcaICE1 as an effector (Figure 5A). The transfected yeast cells

173

harboring either the full-length EcaICE1 (pGBKT7-EcaICE1) or the truncated version (EcaICE1T1(1-41a);

174

EcaICE1T2(1-83a)) grew well on the selection medium SD/-LWHA, suggesting that the N-terminal 1-83 residues

175

are not necessary for transactivation activity of the EcaICE1. In contrast, when the N-terminal amino acids of the

176

other truncated version (EcaICE1T3(1-125aa); EcaICE1 T4 (1-184aa); EcaICE1T5(1-316aa); EcaICE1T6(1-360aa))

177

were deleted, no interactions were detected (Figure 5B). Taken together, these results demonstrate that amino

178

acids from positions 84 to 125 in EcaICE1 are critical for the transactivation activity of EcaICE1, which contains

Q-rich domain (Figure 1), in agreement with transactivation domain mode in Sp1 (Courey et al. 1989).

180
181

Protein-protein interaction region between EcaICE1 with EcaSIZ1

182

Now the truncated EcaICE1 proteins without transcriptional activation activity (EcaICE1T3~T6) were fused

183

to the GAL4 activation domain of vector pGBKT7 and co-transformed with pGADT7-EcaHOS1 into yeast strain

184

separately to exam the protein-protein interaction region between EcaICE1 with EcaHOS1. The results showed

185

(Figure 6) that all the truncated EcaICE1T3 could interact with EcaHOS1, indicating that the C-terminus protein

186

of EcaICE1(361-557aa) is indispensable for its interaction with EcaHOS1 protein, similar to A. thaliana (Miura

187

et al. 2007).

DISCUSSION

190

It is reported that China is the world's second largest wood consumer and the first largest wood

191

importer (Lin 2019 ). At present, Chinese annual wood consumption has exceeded 600 million cubic meters,

192

and its wood demand has become more than 50% dependent on imports. Eucalyptus, the main trees of

193

man-made forest in South China even whole China, plays an important role in Chinese wooden market ( Li

194

et al. 2017 ). However, low temperature is a primary disadvantage factor, which causes the biomass to fall,

195

and limits the development of its health (Janmohammadi et al. 2015). As the result, it is important to reveal

196

the molecular mechanism of cold stress in Eucalyptus for improving the cold tolerance on the inheritance

197

level as well as expanding the growing in northern region. In Arabidopsis, the cold signaling pathways,

198

ICE-CBF-COR pathway (Ding et al. 2015; Shi et al. 2018) and ICE-CBF pathway is positively correlated

199

with response to low temperature stress (Lin et al. 2014), had been studied clearly while the research of

200

subcellular localization, transcriptional activation and interactions with upstream regulators in E.

201

camaldulensis has still uncertain. Therefore, we further analyze the subcellular localization, transcriptional

202

activation of EcaICE1, and EcaSIZ1 (the homologous gene of SIZ1) was cloned to determine the protein

203

interactions between EcaICE1 and EcaSIZ1 as well as the key region by BiFC and yeast two-hybrid system

204

technology for exploring the SUMOylation pathway of EcaICE1.

205

According to the multiple comparison of EcaICE1 protein sequence, these is a nuclear localization

206

sequence signal in its bHLH-ZIP domain, indicated that EcaICE1 may be located in nucleus. Further, the

207

analysis of subcellular localization demonstrates that EcaICE1 is really located in nucleus, which is similar

208

to P. ussuriensis (Huang et al. 2015) and H. brasiliensis (Deng et al. 2017) as well as according with the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/859819; this version posted December 1, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

209

characteristics of transcription factor family of plant bHLH (Gabriela et al. 2003). Above all, EcaICE1,

210

located in nucleus, may play a regulatory role in the molecular mechanism of cold stress. What is more, we

211

further found that the EcaICE1 84th to 95th amino acid of N-terminal, which is the Glutamine-rich domain,

212

was identical with its homologous gene of ICE1 in E. grandis and E. globulus, and this domain only was

213

found in the ICE1 homologous protein in Eucalyptus. Interestingly, it was found that EcaICE1 protein had

214

strong transcriptional activation activity. Similar results were also reported on the ICE1 in P. ussuriensis

215

(Huang et al. 2015) and H. brasiliensis (Deng et al. 2017) while ICE1 protein did not have transcriptional

216

activation activity in Arabidopsis. The 46th to 95th and the 1th to 402th amino acid of N-terminal of

217

protein were verified that those are the key region of transcriptional activation activity in PuICE1 of P.

218

ussuriensis (Huang et al. 2015) and HbICE1 of H. brasiliensis (Deng et al. 2017), respectively.

219

Unfortunately, neither of them further explored the structural characteristics of the transcriptional activation

220

region. This study indicated that 84th to 125th amino acid of N-terminal of protein was the critical region

221

of transcriptional activation in EcaICE1 of E. camaldulensis, including the Q-rich domain as well as

222

according with the transcriptional activation structure of classical transcription factor Sp1 (Courey et al.

223

1989). It means that Q-rich domain may be the key transcriptional activation region of EcaICE1 protein.

224

SUMOylation is a posttranslational regulatory process in eukaryotes, including cold tolerance (Miura

225

et al. 2007), ABA response (Miura et al. 2009), flowering time (Bo et al. 2010) and drought tolerance

226

(Miura et al. 2013) and most of them are mainly devoting to A. thaliana. Studies in A. thaliana have shown

227

that the SUMOylation pathway is mainly mediated by the SUMO E3 ligase SIZ1. Currently, SIZ1 genes

228

have been isolated from plants such as rice (PARK et al. 2010), Dendrobium nobile (Liu et al. 2015), apple

229

(Zhang et al. 2016), soybean (Cai et al. 2017) and tomato (Zhang et al. 2017), but no study on cloning the

230

gene SIZ1 and its interaction with ICE1 in forest trees. The coding sequence of EcaSIZ1, which was

231

isolated in this study, is similar to the cloned SIZ1 protein in the above plants, and also has similar protein

232

secondary domains such as MIZ1/SP zinc finger domain, SAP domain, PINIT domain, SXS domain and

233

PHD domain. Among them, MIZ1/SP zinc finger domain is associated with SUMO E3 ligase activity, and

234

The SXS domain is associated with binding of SUMO (Miura et al. 2007). The SAP domain promotes

235

binding to DNA, PINIT domain is related to intracellular retention. The above plant SIZ1 proteins are

236

located in the nucleus and EcaSIZ1 protein should also have this conserved domain, so it indicated that

237

EcaSIZ1 may be located in the nucleus too. PHD domain is a plant homologous domain, which only exists

238

in SIZ1 proteins in plant (Park et al. 2010). Meanwhile, EcaSIZ1 protein shared more than 70% identity

with other woody plants at the SIZ1 homologous protein level, indicating that EcaSIZ1 is the SIZ1 gene

240

from E. camaldulensis, and its encoded protein may have SUMO E3 ligase activity and mediate

241

SUMOylation in the nucleus.

242

BiFC assay showed that EcaICE1 and EcaSIZ1 had the protein interaction in plant nucleus, but which

243

region of EcaICE1 was the key region of protein interaction is still unknown. Therefore, using EcaICE1

244

with different truncated lengths without transcriptional activation activity as decoy protein, the 361th to

245

557th amino acid region at the C-terminal of EcaICE1 protein where was the key region of its interaction

246

with EcaSIZ1 was further identified by yeast hybrid technology. The protein sequence of EcaICE1 in this

247

region contained a SUMO domain, which was completely consistent with the result of A. thaliana,

248

suggesting that the process of ICE1 SUMOylation, mediated by SIZ1, might be similar to A. thaliana

249

(Miura et al. 2007). As for whether EcaSIZ1 has SUMO E3 ligase activity and whether it could couple with

250

EcaICE1 forming the SUMO coupling for playing a role in cold toleration in plant, need further

251

experiments to confirm.

252
253

CONCLUSIONS

254

In this study, we cloned the gene EcaICE1 and EcaSIZ1 from E. camaldulensis, and the amplification

255

of EcaICE1 was the same as the previous result, and EcaSIZ1 was highly conserved with other plant SIZ1

256

genes. EcaICE1 was similar to other ICE1 in plant, located in nucleus, and it had a strong transcriptional

257

activation activity. Moreover, the 84-126 amino acid regions of N-terminal domain of EcaICE1 protein,

258

were the key region of transcriptional activation activity of EcaICE1. In addition, the C-terminal region

259

from position 361 to 557 in EcaICE1 was the key region for its interaction with EcaSIZ1. According to this

260

study, we made a foundation on SUMOylation pathway and the molecular regulation mechanism of

261

EcaICE1.
