Abstract

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) facilitate cell-cell communication in animals and are integral

to many physiological and pathological processes. Evidence for the presence and

28

function of EVs in plants is limited. Here, we report that EVs derived from watermelon

29

fruit mesocarp are of similar size and morphology to the animal EV subtype known as

30

exosomes. Analysis of EV constituents revealed that watermelon EVs are negative for

31

endoplasmic reticulum markers, and that the miRNA and protein profiles differ from that

32

of watermelon mesocarp cells, suggesting that these EVs are actively synthesised and

33

are not merely cellular debris. Furthermore, we report a panel of proteins found in in

34

watermelon EVs as well as the published proteomes of grape, grapefruit, lemon and

35

Arabidopsis thaliana EVs that are novel potential plant EV markers. Bioinformatic

36

analyses suggest that plastids and multivesicular bodies are likely sites of biogenesis

37

for EVs from watermelon and other plants. Predicted functional roles of watermelon

38

EVs include development and metabolism, with several of their cargo molecules likely

39

to be key in regulation of fruit development and ripening. Further understanding of how

40

EVs may contribute to these processes would improve understanding of plant cell-cell

41

communication and could aid in the harnessing of plant EVs for greater temporal

42

control of crop development/ripening for the agricultural and retail industries.

43

Main

44

An ever-growing literature emphasises the critical role played by extracellular vesicles

45

(EVs) in mediating cell-cell communication, both in health and disease, in the bacterial,

46

fungal and animal kingdoms1,2. These EVs travel in the extracellular environment

47

before internalisation by recipient cells, delivering their cargo and altering cell function3-

48

5

49

(i.e., vesicles that are actively secreted, rather than mere cellular fragments) is yet to be

50

confirmed. The term ‘EVs’ encapsulates several classes of cellular-derived vesicles

51

with varying size, composition and function. One of most studied classes of mammalian

52

EVs are exosomes, which are derived from membrane invagination in the late

. Whilst EV-like particles have been observed in plants 6-16, their identity as true EVs

53

endosomes known as multivesicular bodies (MVBs)17,18. Exosomes are generally

54

considered to be 50-150nm EVs that contain a range of cargo molecules, including

55

proteins, messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), which are actively

56

sorted into exosomes during exosome formation, resulting in a differing cargo profile to

57

that of the cell of origin5,19-24. Differing cell and EV cargo demonstrates that EVs are

58

purposeful and energy demanding cell-cell signals, not just passive cellular products.

59

Microvesicles are larger (100nm-1µm) EVs which bud directly from the plasma

60

membrane25, meaning that their contents more closely resemble that of the donor cell.

61

The third major EV subtype is the 1-2µm apoptotic bodies, which bleb off the plasma

62

membrane in apoptotic cells26,27 and can contain whole organelles or nuclear

63

fragments28.

64

In plants, MVB fusion with the plasma membrane at sites of infection has been

65

observed using electron microscopy (EM), and is thought to be involved in the

66

response to pathogens29. Plant EVs have been shown to contain small RNAs30, such

67

as miRNAs, which are suggested to suppress virulence genes in fungal pathogens31,32.

68

Despite these more recent studies, majority of the studies reporting EV-like particles in

69

plants6-16 have focused on dietary ingestion of plant EVs by animals, meaning that the

70

particles described in such studies have been characterised largely in the context of

71

their impact on mammalian cells, rather than the plant they originated from8,11,13. Initial

72

reports on the presence of membrane phospholipids in plant extracellular fluid33,34 were

73

followed by a study aiming to determine whether these lipids were within EVs 15. Using

74

the classical differential ultracentrifugation method of EV isolation followed by EM, EV-

75

like particles were visualised in pellets from apoplastic fluid at both 40,000xg and

76

100,000xg15,35. In keeping with their potential identity as EVs, these particles were

77

found to contain at least a limited protein cargo. Further characterisation of the

78

components, biogenesis and function of plant EVs has yet to be performed.

79

Determining the origin and function of plant EVs is essential to understanding plant cell-

80

to-cell communication, not only to increase fundamental knowledge of plant physiology,

81

but in understanding how these processes may be beneficially manipulated.

82

Watermelon fruits (Citrullus lanatus) contain an abundance of extracellular fluid and

83

have, at ripeness, a delicate mesocarp, allowing for the isolation of large quantities of

84

extracellular fluid without risk of disrupting cells and creating cellular fragments which

85

could erroneously be identified as EVs. As such, watermelon fruit is an ideal model for

86

plant EV characterisation. Here, we show that watermelon fruit contains EVs – likely

87

originating from plastids and MVB – which differ in miRNA and protein profiles to

88

mesocarp cells. Furthermore, we identify a panel of potential plant-specific EV markers

89

and predict that watermelon EVs have likely roles in sugar metabolism and fruit

90

development/ripening.

91

Results

92

Characterisation of extracellular vesicles from watermelon fruit mesocarp

93

Sequential ultracentrifugation was used to isolate EVs from watermelon mesocarp.

94

Parallel isolation from culture medium conditioned by human epithelial cells was

95

performed to validate the isolation procedure. The presence of authenticated human

96

EV markers36-39 (ALIX+ve/CD63+ve/CANX-ve; Figure 1a) in the EVs from human epithelial

97

cell conditioned media confirmed the suitability of our approach. Nanoparticle tracking

98

analysis and transmission electron microscopy revealed that watermelon and human

99

EVs have a similar morphology (Figure 1b) and size (117nm ± 14.61 Vs 129nm ± 28

100

respectively, p=0.68; Figure 1b). However, it should be noted that the watermelon EVs

130

isolated here appear to consist of 2 subsets, one with a peak around 40-60nm in

131

diameter and one around 150nm, potentially reflecting two distinct subtypes of EVs.

132

The average yield of watermelon EVs was 1.85x1010 ± 1.63x1010 EVs/ml of watermelon

133

juice. On average, the DNA yield was 2.12x1012 ± 9.57x1011, the RNA yield was

134

7.64x108 ± 9.31x108 particles/ng RNA and the protein yield was 1.94x109 ± 7.14x108

135

particles/μg protein. Relative to the starting volume of juice, the EV DNA yield was 0.38

136

± 0.11 μg/ml, the EV RNA yield was 3.45 ± 1.70 μg/ml and the EV protein yield was

137

96.79 ± 32.6 ng/ml.

138

Protein and miRNA profiling of watermelon EVs

139

Next, to rule out the possibility that the isolated watermelon EVs were merely products

140

of cellular disruption or breakdown, we compared their protein and miRNA content to

141

that of their parent mesocarp cells. The full list of proteins identified (1838) in

142

watermelon EVs and cells is available in Supplementary table S1. 28.13% of proteins

143

were enriched and 34.98% were depleted by >1.5-fold in EVs compared to parent cells.

144

Of note, a number of cell compartment markers for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),

145

mitochondria, nucleus and chloroplast, including established negative markers of

146

mammalian EVs such as ER-localised calnexin and nuclear-localised histone 2B, are

147

depleted in EVs compared to cells (Table 1). Principal component analysis and

148

hierarchical clustering analysis indicated that the profile of proteins in watermelon

149

mesocarp EVs differed from that of cells, though the profile varied between different

150

watermelons (Figure 2a-b). Further analysis of watermelon EV content was performed

151

by profiling the miRNAs. This demonstrated that 25.00% and 35.71% were >1.5-fold

152

enriched and depleted respectively in EVs compared to mesocarp cells (Figure 2c-e;

153

full results in Supplementary table 2). Principal component analysis confirmed that EVs

154

have a distinct profile of miRNAs compared to their parent cells (Figure 2c).

179

Together these data suggest that the EVs isolated in this study are not merely

180

fragments of organelles produced during cellular breakdown or EV isolation.

181

The enrichment of specific miRNAs in watermelon EVs compared to cells suggests

182

active sorting of miRNAs in watermelon. In mammals, miRNAs are actively sorted into

183

EVs, in a sequence-dependent manner, by hnRNPA2B123. To determine whether the

184

same may be true of plant EVs, a BLAST search for hnRNPA2B1 was conducted. No

185

sufficiently orthologous protein was found in the Viridiplantae kingdom. Furthermore,

186

analysis of the relationship between miRNA sequence, sequence motif or secondary

187

structure and enrichment/depletion in watermelon EVs (data not shown) revealed no

188

obvious association. However, when the miRNA seed sequence was considered in

189

isolation, it did appear that some related seed sequences were similarly regulated

190

(Figure 2d). As the seed sequence of miRNAs is the most important region for miRNA-

191

mRNA binding, and mRNA abundance is inversely linked to miRNA sorting EVs in

192

animals40, we hypothesised the relationship between seed sequence and EV

193

enrichment may relate to the abundance of target mRNAs within watermelon cells.

194

Whilst the levels of mRNAs in watermelon cells are unknown, our analysis of the

195

proteins present in watermelon cells and EVs can be used as a proxy measure of the

196

abundance of their mRNAs; our data show that the levels of the cellular proteins that

197

are the targets of miRNAs enriched in EVs were lower than those that are the targets of

198

miRNAs depleted in EVs (Figure 2e; p<0.01). A full list of watermelon EV miRNA

199

targets is given in Supplementary Table 3.

200

Identification of potential plant EV markers

201

There is a growing consensus on the use of several lipid-associated/membrane-

202

spanning and cytosolic proteins as suitable markers of mammalian EVs39. Likewise,

203

there is a proposed range of ‘negative markers to distinguish human EVs, particularly

204

the MVB derived exosomes, from cellular debris39. We also demonstrated the depletion

205

of some of these ‘negative’ markers, such as calnexin, in watermelon EVs compared to

206

watermelon cells (Table 1).

207

Currently, there are no widely recognised positive markers of plant EVs and there are

208

no sufficient homologs of human markers present in the watermelon proteome,

209

suggesting mechanisms of biosynthesis may differ. To discover potential novel

210

marker(s) of plant EVs, the proteomes of EVs from watermelon and EV-like particles

211

previously isolated from grape11, grapefruit13, lemon14 and Arabidopsis thaliana6 were

212

compared (Table 2). One protein, enolase, is present in the EVs of all 5 species and,

213

interestingly, is the second most commonly reported protein in human EVs41. Of the 15

214

remaining potential markers with a human ortholog, all have been identified in human

215

EVs and 11 are within the top 250 most commonly identified human EV proteins42.

216

Plastids and multivesicular bodies are likely sites of watermelon extracellular vesicle

217

biogenesis

218

We next interrogated the EV protein profile using gene ontology (GO) enrichment

219

analysis, reasoning that such information might help to identify the site of EV

220

biogenesis. This indicated that the majority of the EV proteins are from either the

221

cytoplasm or the plastid and its derivatives (Figure 3a). The plastid is a known site of

222

vesicles43-49 approximating the size of the smaller peak identified in nanoparticle

223

tracking analysis of watermelon EVs (Figure 1c), making the plastid a credible

224

candidate site for plant EV biogenesis. Further prediction based on cellular localisation

225

signals and comparison of the watermelon EV proteome with previously published

226

data50 supports this hypothesis, with 73.58% of watermelon EV proteins

227

predicted/observed to be within plastids (Figure 3b). The same high percentage of

228

plastid proteins was seen in other plant species for which data was available.

261

Furthermore, the yellow-orange colouration of watermelon EV pellets suggests the

262

presence of lycopene, which is produced and stored within watermelon chromoplasts.

263

Interestingly, our analysis of the published proteomes of EV-like particles isolated from

264

grape11, grapefruit13, lemon14 and Arabidopsis thaliana6 suggests that plastids might be

265

a common site of EV synthesis in plants (Figure 3b).

266

Animal exosomes originate from MVB. As neither GO enrichment nor predictive

267

localisation based upon sequence are equipped for the assessment of MVB proteins,

268

BLAST was used to align the proteome of EVs from watermelon, grape, grapefruit,

269

lemon and Arabidopsis thaliana to that of Arabidopsis thaliana MVB51. This revealed

270

that the majority of the non-plastid EV proteins are present in plant MVB, with some

271

proteins being present in both organelles (Figure 3b). When protein abundance is

272

considered, rather than the number of individual proteins, 52.28% of all protein mass in

273

watermelon EVs is from proteins which reside solely in plastids, whilst proteins residing

274

solely in MVB account for just 33.61% of the total protein mass in watermelon EVs

275

(Figure 3c), suggesting that EVs of potential plastid origin may be more abundant than

276

those of MVB origin.

277

Proteins are not the only plastid component present in EVs. Whilst DNA of nuclear

278

(actin-7) and mitochondrial (ORF204) origin are depleted in EVs compared to cells

279

(Figure 3d; p<0.05), the level of plastid DNA (rbcL) in cells and EVs was similar. The

280

level of plastid DNA present in EVs varied between watermelons. Nonetheless, these

281

data further support a plastid origin for at least a subset of watermelon EVs.

282

Predicted roles for watermelon extracellular vesicles in fruit development/ripening

283

Next, we turned to predicting the potential roles of watermelon EVs by examining GO

284

cellular process and pathway enrichment for EV proteins and miRNA targets. The

285

targets of miRNAs that are enriched in cells appear to be concerned mainly with the
13

286

various processes of cellular metabolism (Figure 4; blue), whereas the targets of

287

miRNAs enriched in watermelon EVs are primarily involved in processes of

288

development and reproduction (Figure 4; red). Analysis of the proteins enriched in

289

watermelon cells and EVs suggests that they have broadly similar roles in both

290

compartments (Figure 5a). However, whilst the processes and pathways of proteins

291

enriched in cells cover a wide range of cellular metabolic processes, those for proteins

292

enriched in EVs focus on nucleic acid metabolism, suggesting a role in gene

293

expression. When considered in isolation, those watermelon EV proteins that are

294

predicted to usually localise to the MVB or the plastid are also mostly involved in

295

metabolism (Figure 5b). The second highest enriched biological process theme in MVB

296

is gene expression (11.1%), with nucleic acid metabolism also featuring in the

297

metabolism processes. However, in plastids, the second highest enriched biological

298

process theme is response to reactive oxygen species (4.61%), followed closely by cell

299

signalling (4.15%), and gene expression does not feature. These data suggest distinct

300

roles for the proposed MVB-derived and plastid-derived EV subtypes.

301

As development/reproduction, metabolism and control of reactive oxygen species are

302

all important for fruit production and ripening, we hypothesised that watermelon EVs

303

could have a role in these processes. We therefore analysed an open access dataset52

304

of the transcripts expressed in the fruit flesh of the LSW177 variety of watermelon on

305

days 10-34 after pollination, predicting that the mRNA targets of miRNA found in

306

watermelon EVs would be downregulated over time if EVs truly influence fruit

307

development/ripening. The data presented in Figure 6 support this hypothesis as the

308

levels of watermelon EV miRNA targets decrease across the timescale of fruit

309

development and ripening, reaching significantly lower expression than the average of

310

all watermelon transcripts at day 34 (p<0.0001) when the fruit is considered ripe.

371

Discussion

372

Here we present the first data on the isolation and characterisation of EVs from

373

watermelon fruit. These EVs are of a size and morphology reminiscent of animal

374

exosomes53. We have also reported the average yield of watermelon EVs per millilitre

375

of starting juice and the ratio of particles to DNA, RNA and protein. These

376

characterisations are a first in the plant EV field and are crucial for ensuring that plant

377

EV studies are executed to the same standard as is expected in the mammalian EV

378

field. The particle/protein ratio of 1.85x1010 particles/μg protein is considered to be

379

highly pure54, suggesting that the methodology presented here is sufficient to isolate

380

EVs from watermelon which are free of protein contamination. However, analysis of

381

other potential contaminant molecules which may be present in watermelon juice, such

382

as glucose and sucrose, is not currently known.

383

Human exosomes exhibit miRNA5 and protein38 profiles that differ from their cells of

384

origin due to active loading of cargo, a phenomenon we also observed in watermelon

385

EVs. In watermelon EVs, miRNA sorting appears to be associated with abundance of

386

cellular target proteins; high levels of cytoplasmic mRNA may sequester miRNA away

387

from the site of EV biogenesis, as has been previously identified in humans40.

388

However, we acknowledge that protein levels are skewed by post-transcriptional

389

regulation and are therefore an imperfect proxy of mRNA levels. Whilst we did not

390

observe any discriminating sequence or structural motifs between enriched and non-

391

enriched miRNAs in watermelon EVs, characterisation of the full complement of cellular

392

and EV miRNAs is required before this can be confirmed.

393

Several studies have described EVs or EV-like particles isolated from plants using

394

broadly similar methods to those we employed in this current study6-15. Some report

395

vesicles larger than human exosomes and watermelon EVs8,9,11, potentially due to

396

vigorous isolation techniques (i.e. prolonged blending) resulting in cellular debris.

397

However, it is also possible that some plant EVs may be constitutively larger, perhaps

398

due to differences in biogenesis. One of the main determinants of the size of vesicles

399

isolated by ultracentrifugation is the final pelleting force55. Whilst most studies have

400

pelleted plant EV-like particles at standard forces of 100,000-150,000xg, two studies

401

reported the isolation of EVs at just 40,000xg6,15. However, the lack of reporting on the

402

rotors or the pelleting k-factor used to isolate EVs precludes direct comparisons,

403

reinforcing the importance of standardisation in reporting EV isolation and

404

characterisation.

405

Plastids and MVB are both vesicle-containing organelles43 and it is therefore

406

conceivable that both produce plant EVs, perhaps of distinct functionality. More than

407

half of proposed plant EV markers (i.e., those most conserved in EVs between species)

408

are present in chromoplasts, around one third in MVB and one tenth in both, supporting

409

dual origin. Whilst our hypothesis that some watermelon EVs may be generated in

410

plastids is novel, the cell-to-cell movement of plastid components through an

411

unidentified mechanism has been reported previously56. Movement of the whole plastid

412

genome between cells was proposed to occur through the movement of intact

413

plastids56, but this hypothesis has been criticised due to the large size of plastids

414

relative to the diameter of the plasmodesmata channels between cells57. Our data

415

suggest that EVs could be responsible for the transfer of genetic material, as plastid

416

DNA is present at a relatively high abundance in watermelon EVs. DNA sequencing of

417

plant EVs would further confirm this hypothesis.

418

We have identified a number of potential plant EV marker proteins. We propose that a

419

panel of the potential plant EV markers identified herein – perhaps those with highest

420

fold-enrichment in EVs as compared with cells – be used in future plant EV studies to

421

enable better understanding of the nature of plant EVs as well as ensuring

422

standardisation amongst the field. For example, vesicle-associated protein 4-2 which

423

was identified solely in EVs and is predicted to reside solely in plastids,

424

adenosylhomocysteinase which resides solely in MVB and enolase which is predicted

425

to reside in both plastids and MVB and is also highly abundant in mammalian EVs.

426

Similarly, we recommend that ‘negative’ EV markers from human and animal studies be

427

extended for use in the plant field, as we have shown a number of these to be valid for

428

the characterisation of plant EVs. This includes calnexin and histone 2B.

429

Previous studies investigating EV-like vesicles in plants have focused on their role in

430

the plant response to infectious agents 29,58. Our bioinformatic analyses suggest that

431

plant EVs may also play a role in metabolism and fruit development/ripening. We found

432

that watermelon EVs contain the machinery needed for the metabolism of sucrose and

433

glucose, such as glucose-6-phosphate isomerase and sucrose synthase, suggesting

434

that plant EVs may play a role in the accumulation and metabolism of sugar in fruits,

435

allowing for rapid tissue expansion and making fruit palatable for seed propagation by

436

animals. Growth-regulating factors (GRF) 1, 4, 5 and 9 are predicted targets of several

437

of the most abundant, if not the most enriched, watermelon EV miRNAs, including the

438

miR-396 family and miR-390-3p. GRFs are downregulated during ripening of

439

watermelon and other fruits 52,59. A miR-396-GRF network has been implicated in the

440

size, maturation and ripening of several fruits, perhaps through influence on the

441

meristem 60-62. Furthermore, miR-159c, which is depleted in watermelon EVs, is also

442

implicated in fruit development and ripening via its targeting of MYB33 63,64; this

443

transcription factor is downregulated during watermelon ripening. Overexpression of

444

miR-159 results in fruit formation in the absence of fertilisation64,65 and downregulation

445

of miR-159 results in the production of more spherical fruit in Arabidopsis thaliana66.

446

Furthermore, three miRNAs enriched (cla-miR319a, miR399g and cla-miR408) and

447

three depleted (cla-miR393, miR167a and cla-miR399a) in watermelon EVs target

448

ethylene-responsive transcription factors and ethylene producing enzymes, suggesting

449

that they may be involved in ethylene-dependent fruit ripening. Together, these data

450

suggest that watermelon EV miRNAs could be involved in the initiation and control of

451

fruit development and ripening.

452

The potential role of plant EVs in fruit ripening represents a novel finding and could,

453

with further research, aid developing technologies to manipulate this process with the

454

aim of reducing the economic burden of fruit wastage due to premature ripening and

455

subsequent spoiling of fruits before they reach the end consumer. Furthermore,

456

understanding cell-cell communication through EVs in plants could be of use in

457

agricultural grafting, aiding in the production of crops able to develop fruits/vegetables

458

in substandard environments, thereby increasing global food production. Grafted plants

459

share genetic material, with the genetic material from one individual transferring the

460

other 67-71. Some have hypothesised that this results from whole nuclei or organelles

461

passing between the individuals following cell disruption during the grafting process

462

(reviewed in 72). However, as mentioned above, the small size of the plasmodesmata73

463

communication channels between cells relative to nuclei or organelles questions the

464

feasibility of this occurring 57. Therefore, the current prediction of a potential plastid

465

origin for watermelon EVs, especially the plastid DNA they contain, raises the

466

possibility that EVs are a vector for this genetic exchange between grafted species.

467

Further understanding of the role for EVs in grafting could, therefore, aid in increasing

468

crop yield and resilience.

469

This study contains the first detailed characterisation of plant EVs alongside exploration

470

of the potential functions of watermelon EV cargo. It is hoped that the observations and

471

suggestions made herein, including the panel of plant-specific EV markers, will enable

472

clarity and rigor in the plant EV field moving forward.

Materials

475

Unless otherwise stated, all reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

476

Extracellular vesicle isolation

477

We have submitted all relevant data of our experiments to the EV-TRACK

478

knowledgebase (EV-TRACK ID: EV190074)74.Watermelons (n=9) were purchased from

479

a range of local greengrocers and supermarkets. As the variety of watermelons is

480

usually not given in greengrocers or supermarkets, an effort was made to select

481

visually similar fruits. All were of a medium size (i.e. not described as ‘giant’ or ‘baby’)

482

and exhibited dark and light green stripes on their rind. Watermelon were from a range

483

of countries of origin and were purchased throughout the year so as to best reflect the

484

fruits available to consumers. The watermelon mesocarp was removed from the rind

485

with a knife and the weight of dissected mesocarp recorded. Dissected mesocarp was

486

pulsed for 1 second in a standard kitchen blender. This brief blending was sufficient to

487

disrupt the structure of the mesocarp, but did not break open the seeds or produce a

488

homogenate. Large tissue fragments were removed using a coarse sieve to leave an

489

opaque juice. EV isolation was then performed using differential ultracentrifugation at

490

4oC with a Sorvall Discovery 100SE centrifuge set to ‘RCFavg’. Firstly, the juice was

491

centrifuged at 1,000xg for 10 minutes using the A-621 fixed-angle rotor. The

492

supernatant was then centrifuged twice at 10,000xg for 10 minutes using A-621 fixed

493

angle rotor to remove the remaining large fragments of tissue, apoptotic bodies and

494

whole organelles such as plastids. The resulting supernatant was passed through a

495

0.22µm filter (Merck Millipore) then centrifuged at 100,000xg for 90 minutes (k-factor

496

207.11) in sterile tubes using the T-1250 fixed-angle rotor. The supernatant was

497

discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 200µl of sterile phosphate buffered saline

498

minus magnesium and calcium. EV size was determined using nanoparticle tracking

499

analysis (NTA) on a NanoSight LM10 (Malvern). Per sample, 3x60 second videos taken

500

and were analysed using the NTA 2.3 software. EV morphology was determined using

501

transmission electron microscopy following negative staining with 1% uranyl acetate.

502

Images were captured on a JEM1400 transmission electron microscope (Jeol) at 120kV

503

using a 1k CCD camera (Advanced Microscopy Techniques, Corp.). Watermelon EVs

504

were compared with those isolated using the same protocol as for watermelon EVs

505

from culture medium conditioned by Caco-2 cells (ECACC #86010202; approximately

506

1.75 x 107 cells in 50ml culture medium) for 72 hours. Culture medium comprised of

507

Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), 2mM non-essential amino acids, 4mM

508

glutamine, 100U/L penicillin, 100μg/L streptomycin and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum

509

(Life Technologies Ltd).

510

miRNA analysis

511

RNA was isolated from watermelon (n=3) EVs or matched mesocarp cells (1,000xg

512

centrifugation pellet, k-factor 50430.28) using the miRVana miRNA Isolation Kit

513

(Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the addition of the Plant RNA Isolation Aid (Thermo

514

Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Following lysis and prior

515

to RNA isolation, samples were spiked with cel-miR-39 (Qiagen) to allow for

516

normalisation of extraction efficiency. Reverse transcription was performed on 125ng of

517

RNA – quantified using the NanoDrop 2000c – using the miScript Plant RT kit (Qiagen).

518

Currently, no products are commercially available for the profiling of watermelon

519

miRNAs. However, the high level of miRNA homology between plant species

520

(discussed in 75) allowed profiling of watermelon miRNAs using a rice (Oryza sativa)

521

qPCR array, which quantifies 84 miRNAs. cDNA samples from EVs and cells were

522

analysed using the Rice miFinder qPCR array (Qiagen). snoR10, snoR31, snoR5-1a,

523

U15 and U65-2 qPCR array housekeeping genes were constant in cells and EVs and

524

were used alongside the internal reverse transcription control and cel-miR-39 for

525

normalisation. Of the miRNAs on the array, 83 were detected. The melting temperature

526

of each miRNA was compared between qPCR array plates; a difference of 2oC or more

527

suggests that a different sequence had been amplified, such miRNAs were removed

528

from analysis (17 miRNAs). As an additional stringency measure, any rice miRNA with

529

a sequence containing >2 deviations from the published watermelon sequence (Frizzi

530

et al., 2014, Liu et al., 2013) were excluded (38 miRNAs). 28 miRNAs were taken

531

forward for further analysis.

532

Western blot

533

Caco-2 cells and EVs were lysed in 10x radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer

534

(Millipore), with the concentrated buffer being diluted in distilled water for the cells and

535

in the extracellular vesicle solution for the extracellular vesicles. A total of 30ng of

536

protein was loaded into a 7.5% or 10% polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) in reducing

537

conditions. Following gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto a

538

nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare). Membranes were blocked in 5% bovine

539

serum albumin in tris-buffered saline for 1 hour before being incubated with primary

540

antibodies for ALIX (final concentration 1μg/ml; ab24335; Abcam), CD63 (0.5μg/ml;

overnight at 4oC. Secondary antibody was IRDye 800CW conjugated anti-rabbit IgG

543

(0.2μg/ml; 926-32213; Li-Cor Biosciences). Blots were incubated for 1 hour with

544

secondary antibody and then imaged on the Li-Cor Odyssey Sa (Li-Cor Biosciences).

545

Proteomics

546

Watermelon (n=3) cells and matched extracellular vesicles were lysed in10x

547

radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Millipore), as described above for Caco-2 cells

548

and EVs. A total of 600µg of protein – quantified using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-

549

Rad) – was run 5mm into a 10% polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) prior to fixation and

550

staining using Imperial Protein Stain. The excised protein band was dehydrated using

551

acetonitrile then dried via vacuum centrifugation. The proteins in the dried gel piece

552

were reduced with 10mM dithiothreitol then alkylated with 55mM iodoacetamide. The

553

gel piece was washed twice with 25mM ammonium bicarbonate followed by acetonitrile

554

and vacuum centrifugation. Finally, the proteins in the gel were digested in trypsin

555

overnight at 37oC, producing peptides for mass spectrometry analysis. Digested

556

samples were analysed by liquid chromatography coupled-mass spectrometry/mass

557

spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using an UltiMate® 3000 Rapid Separation LC (Dionex

558

Corporation) coupled to an Orbitrap Elite (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) mass

559

spectrometer. Peptide mixtures were separated for 44 min at 300nl/min-1 using a

560

1.7µM Ethylene Bridged Hybrid C18 analytical column (75 mm x 250μm internal

561

diameter; Waters) and 0.1% formic acid in a gradient of 8-33% acetonitrile. Detected

562

peptides were then selected for fragmentation automatically by data dependant

563

analysis. The identified peptides were mapped using Mascot 2.5.1 (Matrix Science UK),

564

to the Citrullus lanatus proteome. Mascot 2.5.1 was used with a fragment tolerance of

565

0.60 Da (Monoisotopic), a parent tolerance of 5.0 parts per million (Monoisotopic), fixed

566

modifications of +57 on C (Carbamidomethyl), variable modifications of +16 on M

(Oxidation). A maximum of 1 missed cleavage was permitted. Data were validated

568

using Scaffold (Proteome Software, USA), employing the following thresholds: 95%

569

protein identification certainty, 1 for the minimum number of unique peptides mapping

570

to each protein, and 80% peptide identification certainty.

571

DNA Analysis

572

DNA was extracted from watermelon (n=3) cells and matched EVs using the ISOLATE

573

II Plant DNA Kit (Bioline) according the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, watermelon

574

cells were ground into a powder using a pestle and mortar with the aid of liquid

575

nitrogen. Both cells and EVs were lysed using Lysis Buffer PA2. Following DNA

576

extraction, primers towards actin-7 (Forward: 5’-ATGTTCACAACCACTGCCGAACG-3’

577

, Reverse: 5’-AATGAGGGATGGCTGGAAAAGAACTT-3’), rbcL (Forward: 5’-

578

ATGAGTTGTAGGGAGGGACTTATGTCACC’3’, Reverse: 5’-

GATTTTCTTCTCCAGGAACAGGCTCG-3’) and ccmFn (Forward: 5’-

580

CCGGCCATAGGTTCGAATCCTG-3’, Reverse: 5’-CCGGCCATAGGTTCGAATCCTG-

581

3’) were used to amplify nuclear, plastid and mitochondrial specific DNA respectively

582

from equal amounts of starting DNA using the Fast Cycling PCR Kit (Qiagen). PCR

583

products were run on a 2% agarose gel containing GelRed (Biotium) for band

584

visualisation. Densitometry was conducted using the ImageStudio lite (Li-Cor). The

585

value of any non-specific amplification in negative controls was removed from all

586

densitometry values for the respective primer’s product.

587

Bioinformatics analysis

588

Oryza sativa miRNAs were aligned with published watermelon miRNAs using the blastn

589

mode of BLAST, with those miRNAs with <2 mismatches along the length of the

590

miRNA (i.e. <10% deviation from the watermelon sequence) being considered

591

homologous. T-Coffee Multiple Sequence Alignment was used to create a phylogenetic

tree of watermelon miRNA sequences. Prediction of miRNA targets was carried out

593

using psRNAtarget 76 using the Citrullus lanatus (watermelon), transcript, Cucurbit

594

Genomics Database, version 177. FASTA sequences for watermelon proteins were

595

procured from the Cucurbit Genome Database 77 and were aligned with those from

596

other plant species and humans using the blastp mode of BLAST. An alignment was

597

considered to predict a homolog if the query cover was at least 70%, with 50% identity

598

within this region. In order to predict the subcellular location of EV biogenesis, the

599

known/annotated subcellular localisation of watermelon EV proteins was obtained from

600

the Cucurbit Genome Database77. The presence of motifs required for sorting into

601

different subcellular locations was also used to predict subcellular localisation using the

602

CELLO software78. Alignment was also performed to the proteome of watermelon

603

chromoplasts50, the late endosome/MVB proteome of Arabidopsis thaliana 51 and

604

transcriptomics data from ripening watermelon fruit 52. Arabidopsis thaliana MVB data

605

was used as no watermelon MVB proteome currently exists in the literature.

606

Hierarchical clustering analysis and principal components analysis was performed

607

using the ClustVis R package 79. Proteins and predicted miRNA targets were analysed

608

for pathway overrepresentation against the whole watermelon proteome using the

609

Bonferroni test; adjusted p-values of <0.05 were considered significant. This procedure

610

was carried out using the Cucurbit Genome Database.

611

Statistical analysis

612

All statistical analysis was performed on GraphPad Prism 8, unless otherwise stated.

613

All measurements reported are on distinct samples. No samples were measured more

614

than once for the same parameter, except where technical replicates were taken. In the

615

case of technical replicates, the mean of these replicates is reported. The individual

616

statistical tests are given in the relevant methods and figures. In brief, all statistical tests
