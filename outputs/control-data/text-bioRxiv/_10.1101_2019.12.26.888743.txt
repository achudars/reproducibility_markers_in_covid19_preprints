Abstract
Site-specific arrest of RNA polymerase is fundamental to several technologies that measure RNA
structure and function. Current in vitro transcription “roadblocking” approaches inhibit transcription elongation
using a protein blockade bound to the DNA template. One limitation of protein-mediated transcription
roadblocking is that it requires the inclusion of a protein factor that is extrinsic to the minimal in vitro
transcription reaction. In this work, we show that interrupting the transcribed DNA strand with an internal
desthiobiotin-triethylene glycol modification efficiently and stably halts Escherichia coli RNA polymerase
transcription. To facilitate diverse applications of chemical transcription roadblocking, we establish a simple
and sequence-independent method for the preparation of internally modified double-stranded DNA templates
by sequential PCR and translesion synthesis. By encoding an intrinsic stall site within the template DNA, our
chemical transcription roadblocking approach enables nascent RNA molecules to be displayed from RNA
polymerase in a minimal in vitro transcription reaction.

Introduction
The in vitro display of nascent RNA molecules from halted transcription elongation complexes is a
powerful tool with proven applications in nascent RNA folding1-4 and systematic RNA aptamer
characterization5,6. Historically, transcription arrest at a defined DNA coordinate has been achieved by
attaching a protein roadblock to a DNA template to halt the progression of RNA polymerases (RNAPs).
Sequence specific protein roadblocks, such the catalytically inactive EcoRIE111Q mutant7 and the Escherichia
coli (E. coli) DNA replication terminator protein Tus5, can be directed to a precise DNA location by encoding a
binding sequence in the template DNA. Alternatively, the biotin-streptavidin complex is capable of halting some
RNAPs if positioned either at the downstream DNA template terminus8 or internally within the transcribed DNA
strand3. Recently, a reversible dCas9 roadblock was developed to enable time-dependent control of
transcription arrest sequentially at multiple DNA positions9. While these approaches have proven effective in
diverse applications, their utility is limited to experimental contexts that tolerate the inclusion of extrinsic protein
factors in the in vitro transcription reaction.
In contrast to protein roadblocks, chemical DNA lesions have not typically been used for nascent RNA
display experiments despite the well-established inhibitory effect of DNA lesions on transcription elongation10.
The lack of chemical transcription roadblocking approaches can be attributed to two challenges: First, chemical
lesions that efficiently stall RNAPs are also likely to stall DNA polymerases so that preparation of DNA
templates for in vitro transcription yields a truncated double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) product during PCR
amplification. Preparation of internally modified dsDNA has been achieved for short DNA molecules by
annealing and ligating modified oligonucleotides11 and for long DNA molecules by enzymatically generating
single-strand DNA gaps that can be filled with modified oligonucleotides12-14. However, these approaches are
sequence-dependent and therefore not suitable for internally modifying the complex DNA sequence libraries
that are frequently used in nascent RNA display experiments4-6. Second, some RNAPs have been shown to
bypass non-bulky DNA lesions such as abasic sites15-18; consequently, RNAP stalling at some chemical lesions
is time-dependent. In this work, we address both of the above challenges to develop a simple and versatile
chemical approach for halting E. coli RNAP transcription elongation in vitro.
We have determined that an internal desthiobiotin-triethylene glycol (desthiobiotin-TEG) modification
positioned in the transcribed strand of in vitro transcription DNA templates efficiently and stably halts E. coli
RNAP. We first show that internally modified dsDNA can be prepared by sequential PCR amplification and
translesion synthesis. We then demonstrate that desthiobiotin-TEG alone efficiently halts RNAP one nucleotide
upstream of the modification site and that lesion bypass by RNAP is sufficiently slow to enable manipulation of
stalled elongation complexes. Lastly, we show that transcription elongation complexes that stall at the
modification site sequester desthiobiotin from streptavidin binding and are stable for at least two hours at
ambient temperature. Our findings establish a method for chemically encoding a transcription stall site within a
DNA molecule to enable efficient RNAP roadblocking in a minimal in vitro transcription reaction.

Results
Translesion synthesis enables preparation of internally modified dsDNA
To assess the transcription roadblocking properties of the desthiobiotin-TEG and internal amino-linker
modifications, we prepared in vitro transcription DNA templates using a synthetic oligonucleotide primer that
positions the modification site 29 bp upstream of the template end (Figure 1C, Supplementary Table 1).
Preparation of internally modified DNA templates by PCR amplification yielded a dsDNA product with one
truncated strand, suggesting that Vent Exo- DNA polymerase cannot efficiently bypass the modification site
(Figure 1D, E). To complete the truncated DNA strand, we purified the initial truncated PCR product and
performed primer extension using the thermostable Y-family lesion bypass polymerase Sulfolobus islandicus
DNA polymerase IV (Dpo4) (Figure 1D). The related Sulfolobus solfarticus Dpo4 was shown to discriminate
between correct and incorrect nucleotides with reported misincorporation frequencies between 8 x 10-3 and 3 x
10-4 (ref. 19) and Dpo4 from several Sulfolobus species has been used in combination with Taq DNA
polymerase to PCR amplify damaged and ancient DNA20. In our application, we separate PCR amplification
and translesion synthesis into independent steps so that the DNA template promoter and transcribed region
are synthesized first using a DNA polymerase with fidelity suitable for downstream applications. Translesion
synthesis is then used to bypass the modification site and complete the truncated DNA strand. Following
translesion synthesis, dsDNA templates with an internal desthiobiotin-TEG modification were indistinguishable

from unmodified templates by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), whereas dsDNA
templates with an internal amino-linker modification migrated as a doublet (Figure 1E). DNA templates
containing an internal desthiobiotin-TEG modification were also analyzed by non-denaturing PAGE and
showed a slight mobility shift relative to unmodified DNA (Supplementary Figure 1A). DNA templates in which
translesion synthesis was performed using the thermostability-enhancing dNTPs 2-amino-dATP and 5propynyl-dCTP showed an identical mobility shift, suggesting that the shift is a consequence of the
desthiobiotin-TEG modification and not instability in the DNA downstream of the modification site
(Supplementary Figure 1B).
Desthiobiotin-TEG efficiently blocks E. coli RNAP transcription
We evaluated the transcription roadblocking properties of the internal desthiobiotin-TEG and aminolinker modifications by single-round in vitro transcription with E. coli RNAP. Transcription was initiated in the
absence of CTP to walk RNAP to U15, one nucleotide upstream of the first C in the transcript, before addition
of NTPs to 500 µM. Both internal modifications produced a transcription stall-site one nucleotide upstream of
the modification position at C42 (Figure 1F,G). Importantly, an unmodified DNA template control showed no
evidence of modification-independent transcription stalling at C42, indicating that the C42 stall site is entirely
modification-dependent (Figure 2A). We next compared the desthiobiotin-TEG and amino-linker roadblocks to
the ‘gold standard’ terminal biotin-streptavidin roadblock in a 32 minute time course. After 32 minutes there

(Figure 3). In our first replicate, which included time points

64 minute time point. In our second replicate, which
included time points to 64 minutes, modification bypass
slowed after the 48 minute time point (Figure 3). While the

origin of this effect is unclear, it suggests that stalled
elongation complexes may be heterogeneous. We conclude
that virtually all elongation complexes initially stall upon
encountering the desthiobiotin-TEG modification and that
the vast majority of elongation complexes persist at the stall
site well beyond the reaction time of typical nascent RNA
display experiments.

The E. coli RNAP footprint blocks streptavidin binding
The primary caveat to using the desthiobiotin-TEG modification as a transcription stall site is that it is
not functionally inert. Many applications of chemical transcription roadblocking will also depend on
immobilization of the DNA template, which is typically achieved by attachment of streptavidin-coated magnetic
particles to an end of the template. It is therefore desirable that the DNA template contain only one attachment
point. One solution to this limitation is to sequester the desthiobiotin-TEG modification within the RNAP
footprint before DNA immobilization. To test this approach, we first positioned elongation complexes at the U15
walk site such that the desthiobiotin-TEG modification is exposed (Figure 4A). After incubation with
streptavidin-coated magnetic particles, ~89% of U15 complexes partitioned into the bead pellet (Figure 4B). In

be sequestered and incapable of binding streptavidin magnetic beads. (B) Fractionation of internal desthiobiotin-TEG modified DNA

Overview of the experiment shown in (D) and (E). Using a DNA template with an internal desthiobiotin-TEG stall site and a 5’ terminal
biotin, RNAP is positioned at the stall site to sequester desthiobiotin, but 5’-biotin remains exposed. These complexes are immobilized
on streptavidin magnetic beads, washed to remove free NTPs and incubated at room temperature before fractionation into bead pellet
and supernatant. (D) Quantification of the fraction of desthiobiotin-TEG-stalled elongation complexes retained in the bead pellet over

contrast, when RNAP was positioned at the desthiobiotin-TEG stall site, only ~4% of stall site complexes were
recovered in the bead fraction (Figure 4A, B). Thus, positioning E. coli RNAP at the desthiobiotin-TEG stall site
renders the desthiobiotin moiety inert, presumably by sequestration within the RNAP active center.
Desthiobiotin-halted elongation complexes are stably bound to DNA
The observation that the RNAP footprint sequesters desthiobiotin function enabled us to assess the
stability of desthiobiotin-TEG-stalled elongation complexes over long incubation times. We prepared a DNA
template containing both an internal desthiobiotin-TEG modification to stall RNAP and a terminal biotin-TEG
modification upstream of the promoter for DNA immobilization by attachment to streptavidin magnetic beads
(Figure 4C). After elongation complexes were positioned at the desthiobiotin-TEG stall site, the transcription
reaction was incubated with streptavidin magnetic beads for 10 minutes, washed twice with transcription buffer
supplemented with 1 mM MgCl2 to remove free NTPs, and resuspended in this same buffer (Figure 4C). ~98%
of stalled elongation complexes remained attached to the magnetic particles after two hours of incubation
(Figure 4D, E). Thus, elongation complexes that are stalled at a desthiobiotin-TEG modification site retain the
exceptional stability that is expected for ternary transcription elongation complexes.

Discussion
Nascent RNA display is a powerful tool that has proven applications in mapping RNA structure and
folding

1-4

and systematic characterization of RNA function5,6. Established approaches for halting RNAP have

typically relied on protein roadblocks that are not easily navigable by transcribing polymerases. While these
approaches have proven effective for placing RNAP at a defined DNA template position7-9 and for
systematically distributing RNAP across every DNA template position3, each depends on including an extrinsic
protein component in the transcription reaction. Although this requirement is compatible with many
applications, the chemical transcription roadblocking approach described here provides a simple alternative
that expands the repertoire of nascent RNA display tools.
The primary advantage of chemical transcription roadblocking is that no extrinsic factors are needed to
efficiently halt RNAP. The cost of this advantage is that, in contrast to terminal biotin-streptavidin roadblocking,
transcription arrest is time-dependent: in the presence of NTPs some elongation complexes can eventually
bypass the modification site (Figures 2 and 3). Nonetheless, the slow rate at which RNAP bypasses the
desthiobiotin-TEG modification allows ample time for either making biochemical measurements or depleting
NTPs, after which the halted ternary elongation complex persists for hours (Figure 4). Furthermore, the
persistence of stalled elongation complexes for tens of minutes in the presence of 500 µM NTPs suggests that
our approach is generalizable to many experimental contexts.
Our chemical approach for transcription roadblocking is enabled by the facile preparation of internally
modified DNA templates of arbitrary length using translesion synthesis (Figure 1). Because this approach is
sequence-independent, it is suitable both for the preparation of dsDNA templates with a defined sequence and
for the preparation of complex sequence libraries. Importantly, the lesion bypass reaction is simple and
efficient: in our reaction conditions translesion synthesis by Sulfolobus Dpo4 resulted in DNA template
preparations that were indistinguishable from an unmodified template by denaturing gel electrophoresis and
remained fully intact after several freeze-thaw cycles throughout data collection (Supplementary Figure 1C). By
performing PCR amplification and translesion synthesis sequentially, our DNA template preparation protocol
enables the transcribed region of the DNA template to be amplified with fidelity that is appropriate for
downstream applications. A useful feature of this two-step preparation is that removing excess dNTPs after
PCR amplification enables translesion synthesis to be performed with a separate dNTP mixture
(Supplementary Figure 1B). Consequently, additional functionalization can be easily introduced in the nontranscribed DNA strand downstream of the chemical roadblock by inclusion of modified dNTPs during
translesion synthesis.
While our study clearly establishes the desthiobiotin-TEG modification as a potent transcription
blockade, it remains unclear why this modification stalls RNAP more efficiently than abasic lesions or an
amino-linker modification. One possible mechanism is that the branched triethylene glycol linker that connects
the desthiobiotin moiety to the template DNA interrupts the phosphodiester backbone with a two carbon
insertion as opposed to the natural three carbon spacing of the deoxyribose sugar. A second possibility is that

the desthiobiotin-TEG structure itself interferes with catalysis of nucleotide addition by RNAP. It is likely that
other readily available oligonucleotide modifications are suitable for chemical transcription roadblocking. For
example, etheno-dA was recently shown to halt E. coli RNAP efficiently in the presence of 100 µM NTPs18. We
suggest that a DNA modification is suitable for chemical transcription roadblocking if it satisfies four criteria: 1)
the modification should efficiently halt the target RNAP; 2) the modification should be efficiently bypassed by a
translesion DNA polymerase to facilitate DNA template preparation; 3) the modification should be chemically
stable; and 4) the modification should not interfere with downstream applications. We envision that the
chemical transcription roadblocking approach presented in this work will facilitate increasingly demanding
nascent RNA display applications by enabling RNA synthesis in a minimal transcription reaction.
Experimental procedures
Oligonucleotides
All oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and are described in
Supplementary Table 1. All modified oligonucleotides were HPLC-purified to ensure efficient modification. The
oligonucleotide used as a template for PCR amplification was PAGE-purified to enrich for complete product.
Unmodified DNA template preparation
Linear DNA templates without internal modifications were prepared by PCR amplification essentially as
described previously3. Briefly, five 100 µl reactions containing 81.5 µl of water, 10 µl Thermo Pol Buffer (New
England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), 2 µl of 10 mM dNTPs (New England Biolabs), 2.5 µl of 10 µM oligonucleotide A
(unmodified forward primer; Supplementary Table 1), 2.5 µl of 10 µM oligonucleotide C (unmodified reverse
primer; Supplementary Table 1) or oligonucleotide F (5’ biotinylated reverse primer, Supplementary Table 1), 1
µl of Vent Exo- DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), and 0.5 µl of 0.1 nM oligonucleotide G (template
oligonucleotide, Supplementary Table 1) were amplified for 30 PCR cycles. Following amplification, 100 µl
reactions were combined into two 250 µl pools and precipitated by adding 25 µl of 3M sodium acetate (NaOAc)
pH 5.5 and 750 µl of cold 100% ethanol (EtOH), chilling at -80C for 15 minutes, and centrifugation at 20,000 x
g for 15 minutes. DNA pellets were washed with 70% EtOH (v/v), dried using a SpeedVac, dissolved in 30 µl of
nuclease-free water, run on a 1% (wt/v) agarose gel, and extracted using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA concentration was determined by a
Qubit 1.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA).
Internally modified DNA template preparation
Internally modified linear DNA templates were PCR amplified as above except that oligonucleotides A or B
(unmodified and 5’ biotinylated forward primer, respectively, Supplementary Table 1) were used as a forward
primer, oligonucleotides D or E (internal desthiobiotin-TEG and internal amino-linker reverse primers,
respectively, Supplementary Table 1) were used as a reverse primer, and eleven 100 µl reactions were

prepared. Following PCR amplification, each 100 µl reaction was purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification
Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and eluted in 30 µl of nuclease-free water. Of the eleven
30 µl aliquots, one was saved as a control for DNA template quality analysis and ten were pooled for
translesion synthesis, quantified using a Qubit 1.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies), and total volume was
determined; typical yield at this stage was approximately 4.5 µg of DNA. Translesion synthesis reactions were
prepared by combining the eluted DNA with 100 µl of Thermo Pol Buffer (New England Biolabs), 20 µl of 10
mM dNTPs (New England Biolabs), 10 µl of Sulfolobus DNA polymerase IV (New England Biolabs) and
nuclease-free water to 1 ml. The 1 ml master mix was split into 100 µl aliquots and incubated at 55C for 1 hour.
Translesion synthesis with thermostability enhancing dNTPs was performed as above, but with a dNTP mixture
in which ATP and CTP were completely substituted with 2-amino-dATP and 5-propynyl-dCTP (TriLink
Biotechnologies, San Diego, CA). Template DNA was then precipitated, gel extracted, and quantified as
described for unmodified DNA templates.
DNA template quality control
To verify success of the translesion synthesis reaction, all internally modified DNA templates were subjected to
quality control by denaturing Urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) using the UreaGel System
(National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) (Figure 1E, Supplementary Figure 1C, D). Each quality control gel included
a reaction aliquot that had not undergone translesion synthesis as a negative control and an unmodified
positive control. A 10% polyacrylamide urea-PAGE gel was pre-run at 250 V for 30 minutes on a MiniPROTEAN Tetra Cell that was assembled so that 1x Tris/Borate/EDTA (TBE) buffer in the outer chamber
covered only the bottom ~1 centimeter of the gel plates. Immediately prior to loading, 1 µl of 50 nM DNA
template (50 fmol) was mixed with 15 µl of formamide loading dye (1x transcription buffer (described below
under Single-round in vitro transcription), 80% (v/v) formamide, 0.025% (wt/v) bromophenol blue and xylene
cyanol) and boiled for 5 minutes before placing on ice for 2 minutes. All non-denaturing PAGE quality control
gels were 8% polyacrylamide. Gels were stained with SYBR Gold (Life Technologies) and imaged using an
Amersham Biosciences Typhoon 9400 Variable Mode Imager. Following collection of all data, a second
denaturing PAGE quality control gel was performed to confirm that the internal desthiobiotin modified DNA
template remained fully intact (Supplementary Figure 1C).
Single-round in vitro transcription
Single-round in vitro transcription reactions were performed essentially as previously described4,21. All singleround transcription reactions contained 5 nM DNA template and 0.016 U/µl E. coli RNA polymerase
holoenzyme (New England Biolabs) in transcription buffer (20 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane
hydrochloride (Tris-HCl) pH 8.0, 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)
and 50 mM potassium chloride (KCl)), and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA). All NTP mixtures were
prepared using High Purity ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP (GE Life Sciences, Chicago, IL). Two protocol variations

were performed: For experiments in which transcription was initiated by walking elongation complexes to +15
relative to the transcription start site, elongation complexes were stalled at U15 by incubating reactions
containing 2.5 µM ATP and GTP, 1.5 µM UTP, 0.2 µCi/µl [a-32P]UTP (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA), and 10
mM MgCl2 at 37C for 10 minutes before adding NTPs to 500 µM and rifampicin (Gold Biotechnology, St. Louis,
MO) to 10 µg/ml. RNA sequencing ladders were generated by walking elongation complexes to +15 before
adding NTPs supplemented with a chain terminating 3’-deoxyNTP (TriLink Biotechnologies) to 100 µM;
reactions proceeded at 37C for 5 minutes before addition of 125 µL of stop solution. For Figure 2, the biotinstreptavidin roadblock was prepared by adding streptavidin monomer (Promega, Madison, WI) to 100 nM. For
Figure 3, open promoter complexes were formed by incubating reactions containing 200 µM ATP, GTP, CTP,
50 µM UTP and 0.2 µCi/µl [a-32P]UTP (Perkin-Elmer) at 37C for 10 minutes and initiated by adding
magnesium chloride (MgCl2) to 10 mM and rifampicin to 10 µg/ml. A mineral oil overlay was applied to the
reaction master mix after taking the 4 minute time point to prevent evaporation over the 256 minute and 64
minute time courses. Time courses were performed at 37C; at each time point, one 25 µl reaction volume was
added to 125 µL of stop solution (0.6 M Tris, pH 8.0, 12 mM EDTA). All reactions were extracted by adding
150 µL of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), vortexing, centrifugation, and collection of the aqueous
phase and then ethanol precipitated by adding 450 µL of 100% ethanol, 1.2 µl of GlycoBlue Coprecipitant
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and storing at -20C overnight. After centrifugation and removal of
bulk and residual ethanol, precipitated RNA was resuspended in formamide loading dye and fractionated by
Urea-PAGE using a 12% polyacrylamide sequencing gel prepared with the UreaGel System (National
Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA).
Equilibration of streptavidin magnetic beads
All transcription reactions with magnetic separation were performed using 10 µl of Dynabeads MyOne
Streptavidin C1 beads (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) per 25 µl transcription volume. For each experiment,
magnetic beads were prepared in bulk by removing storage buffer, incubating with 500 µl hydrolysis buffer
(100 mM sodium hydroxide, 50 mM sodium chloride (NaCl)) for 10 minutes at room temperature with rotation,
washing once with 1 ml of high salt wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 2 M NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100), once
with 1 ml of binding buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100), twice with 1 ml of 1X
transcription buffer supplemented with Triton X-100 to 0.1%, and resuspended in 1x transcription buffer with
0.1% Triton X-100 to a volume equivalent to that of the total transcription master mix for storage until use.
Desthiobiotin protection assay
Transcription was initiated by walking elongation complexes to U15 as described above. To assess
desthiobiotin-streptavidin binding when RNAP is at U15, one half of the reaction was mixed with rifampicin to
10 µg/mL and immediately mixed with streptavidin magnetic beads. To assess desthiobiotin-streptavidin
binding when RNAP is at the desthiobiotin-TEG stall site, the second half of the reaction was mixed with NTPs

to 500 µM and rifampicin to 10 µg/ml and incubated at 37C for 5 minutes before mixing with streptavidin
magnetic beads. After 10 minutes of incubation, 25 µl of the reaction was added to 125 µl stop solution as a
‘total’ sample control and an additional 25 µl was added to a new tube and placed on a magnetic stand for 1
minute to separate the bead pellet and supernatant. The supernatant was added to 125 µl of stop solution and
the pellet was resuspended in 25 µl of 1x transcription buffer supplemented with 10 mM MgCl2 before being
added to 125 µl of stop solution. Samples were phenol/chloroform extracted, precipitated, and fractionated by
Urea-PAGE as described above.
Elongation complex stability assay
Elongation complex stability assays were performed using a DNA template containing both an internal
desthiobiotin-TEG modification and a terminal biotin-TEG modification. Stalled elongation complexes were
prepared by first walking elongation complexes to U15 as described above and then chasing RNAP to the
desthiobiotin-TEG stall site by adding NTPs to 500 µM and rifampicin to 10 µg/mL and incubating at 37C for 5
minutes. The transcription reaction was then mixed with pre-equilibrated streptavidin magnetic beads and
incubated at 25C for 10 minutes. Following DNA template immobilization, beads were washed twice with 1 ml
of 1x transcription buffer supplemented with 1 mM MgCl2 to remove free NTPs. After removing a ‘zero’ time
point for fractionation, the transcription reaction was incubated at room temperature for 2 hours with rotation
and time points were taken as indicated. At each time point, 25 µl of the reaction was added to 125 µl stop
solution as a ‘total’ sample control and a second 25 µl was added to a new tube and placed on a magnetic
stand for 1 minute to separate the bead pellet and supernatant. The supernatant was added to 125 µl of stop
solution and the pellet was resuspended in 25 µl of 1x transcription buffer supplemented with 1 mM MgCl2
before being added to 125 µl of stop solution. Samples were phenol/chloroform extracted, precipitated, and
fractionated by Urea-PAGE as described above.
Quantification of radiolabeled in vitro transcription reactions
Reactive nucleotides were detected by an Amersham Biosciences Typhoon 9400 Variable Mode Imager and
quantified using ImageQuant (GE Life Sciences). For experiments in which elongation complexes were walked
to U15, transcripts were considered end-labeled due to the high probability of radiolabel incorporation during
the initial walk (~4.25% per U nucleotide) and the low probability of radiolabel incorporation during the chase
(~0.013% per U nucleotide) and no normalization was applied. For the experiments in Figure 3, band intensity
was divided by transcript U content to normalize for the incorporation of [a-32P]UTP. In Figure 2, the fraction of
run-off, stall site, and U15 transcriptions was determined by dividing the band intensity of each transcript class
by the total band intensity of all three classes. In Figure 3, fraction stalled was determined by dividing the
normalized band intensity of desthiobiotin-TEG-stalled transcripts by sum of the normalized band-intensity of
stalled and run-off transcripts; t1/2 was determined by applying a one phase exponential decay fit to time points
from 2 minutes (after new arrival of elongation complexes at the stall site is negligible) to 48 minutes (before

transcripts in the bead pellet was determined by dividing the band intensity of the indicated complex in the
pellet fraction by the sum of the band intensities for the indicated complex in both the pellet and supernatant
fractions.
