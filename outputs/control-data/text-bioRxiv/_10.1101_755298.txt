Abstract
While the Ponseti method has quickly become the mainstay of clubfoot treatment in most

10

parts of the world, its dissemination and successful implementation in Latin America has been

11

more limited. The additional shortage of orthopedic surgeons in this region makes task sharing a

12

practical approach to address gaps in service provision. We designed an online survey to assess

13

needs, perceptions, and willingness to task share the delivery of the Ponseti method by Ponseti-

14

method-trained physicians across Latin America. Multiple-response questions were summarized

15

and an applied thematic analysis approach was used to analyze free-response questions. We

16

achieved a 66% response rate (31 of 47 experts responded). Our findings illustrate that most

17

physicians feel the need for disseminating and improving Ponseti training, as well as having

18

additional support for clubfoot treatment. While physicians who treat clubfoot have mixed

19

opinions on the role of nonphysicians treating clubfoot, most report logistical concerns and

20

insufficient training as barriers to their inclusion. Given this and the need for improved, more

21

accessible clubfoot care across Latin America, future clubfoot treatment efforts may benefit from

22

incorporating task sharing between orthopedic surgeons and non-physician personnel.

Introduction
Clubfoot, defined as the downward- and inward-turning of the foot, is one of the most

26

common musculoskeletal birth deformities in the world (1). When left untreated, clubfoot may

27

cause lifelong physical impairment, social isolation, and economic deprivation. The global

28

paradigm for management of clubfoot has shifted from the provision of extensive surgical

correction to implementation of a minimally-invasive, conservative correction that is both low-

30

cost and highly-effective; this technique is called the Ponseti method (2).

31

The Ponseti method, created by Dr. Ignacio Ponseti, involves a correction and a

32

maintenance phase (3). The correction phase comprises serial manipulations with simultaneous

33

correction of the four components of the deformity: cavus, adductus, varus, and equinus. A series

34

of long-leg plaster of Paris casts hold the corrected foot position, usually followed by an

35

outpatient Achilles tenotomy. Immediately after the removal of the final cast, the corrected foot

36

is placed in a foot abduction brace (FAB) with the aim of preventing recurrence. The FAB

37

should be worn 23 hours a day for the first three months and then only at night until the age of

38

four years; the FAB itself is changed as the child’s foot grows. Both the maintenance and

39

correction phases are equally important for success of clubfoot management. Although success

40

rates of the Ponseti method vary based on when treatment is initiated, patient adherence, and

41

provider experience, complete correction can be achieved in the majority of patients with success

42

rates as high as 95% (4).

43

While the Ponseti method has quickly become the mainstay of clubfoot treatment in most

44

parts of the world – US, UK, Australia, India, and parts of Africa – its dissemination and

45

successful implementation in Latin America has been slower (4). Despite clubfoot being reported

46

as one of the most commonly encountered pediatric orthopedic conditions in parts of Latin

47

America, when compared with patients in higher income nations, patients have a later age of

48

presentation, more time spent in the manipulation and casting phase, lower rates of tenotomy,

49

and higher rates of relapse (5, 6). Inefficient healthcare systems may be partly responsible for

50

this inequity and shortage of trained orthopedic surgeons additionally contributes to barriers to

care (4, 7-9). Similar to other specialty services, most orthopedic professionals work in urban

52

population centers, further disadvantaging patients in rural areas.

53

Although training more orthopedic surgeons appears to be the most straightforward

54

solution, this task requires intensive resources, time, and effort, making it an unrealistic short-

55

term plan (10). Instead, more radical reform of specialist services is needed, particularly where

56

decentralization or integration of services into primary care is necessary to improve access to

57

care and achieve universal health coverage. Task sharing is one practical approach to addressing

58

such gaps in human resources; it involves teaching competencies previously held by specialists

59

to other personnel (11, 12). Originally created by the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery

60

(LCoGS), task sharing –a practice whereby nonsurgeon professionals and clinicians are trained

61

to do simple procedures, whilst having access to surgical professionals who normally do said

62

procedures – is commonly used both in high- and low-resource settings, having been found to be

63

safe and cost-effective (10). In clubfoot treatment, findings from Malawi illustrate that non-

64

physician staff who received training in the Ponseti method were at least as effective as

65

physicians (13). Similar findings were found in Nepal, Vietnam, United States, United Kingdom,

66

and Canada (13-18). Moreover, treatment by physiotherapists in the United Kingdom provided

67

lower rates of additional treatment (14% vs. 26%, p=0.075) as well as a lower rate of additional

68

procedures (6% vs. 18%, p=0.025) when compared to physician-directed groups (17).

69

Despite the promising data available on the use of nonphysician personnel to implement

70

the Ponseti technique and the shortage of orthopedic surgeons in Latin America, no literature

71

exists on task sharing the Ponseti method for the Latin America region. Given the cost-

72

effectiveness of the Ponseti method, the barriers identified by physicians and caregivers, and the

73

shortage of orthopedic surgeons in Latin America (4, 7, 8), this study aims to answer two

questions: (1) Do non-physician personnel (e.g. physical therapists, nurses, etc.) have a role in

75

treating clubfoot, such as assisting with manipulation and casting, providing education, or other

76

tasks? and (2) what are the perceptions and attitudes from Ponseti-trained physicians regarding

77

nonphysician providers implementing (i.e. task sharing) the Ponseti method?

Study and questionnaire
The survey in this study was designed to assess needs, perceptions, and willingness to

86

task share the Ponseti method by Ponseti-trained physicians across Latin America. It consisted of

87

17 questions, including multiple response and free-response questions (see Appendix 1). All

88

questions were reviewed by the contributing authors. Questions were translated to Spanish by a

89

native speaker and read by other native Spanish speakers for clarity. Questions were uploaded to

90

Qualtrics, an online survey platform.

91

Basic demographics such as occupation, country of employment, age, and gender were

92

recorded. Questions to gauge experience with treating clubfoot were asked, such as how

93

participants were trained, length of time treating clubfoot, and their monthly estimate of new

94

clubfoot patients in their clinic. Adherence to and success rates of the Ponseti method were

95

evaluated for each provider through questions about percentage of clubfoot patients completing

casting and/or bracing and rate of patients receiving a tenotomy. Participants were asked in a

97

multiple response question to identify barriers to implementing the Ponseti method, and these

98

barriers were divided into ten categories (Table 2). Participants were asked to rank, on a five-

99

point Likert scale, the extent to which they agreed with several statements regarding time,

100

resources, and attitude towards teaching patients about clubfoot. Participants were additionally

101

asked to identify collaborators for implementing the Ponseti method (Table 3), and were given

102

the opportunity to elaborate in a free-response question on nonphysician staff collaboration with

103

physicians. They were asked to share their opinion of nonphysician staff having a role in treating

104

clubfoot, and then asked to elaborate in a free-response question. A final, open-ended question

105

asking for further suggestions for improving clubfoot treatment was included.

respondent was 40 years, with 71% of respondents being male. All participants had been trained

126

in the Ponseti method. Most had been formally trained in residency (n=19, 38%) and/or a formal

127

workshop (n=18, 36%). Some had one-on-one training from orthopedic surgeons (n=5, 10%) and

128

two (6%) were exclusively trained in this manner, one by Dr. Ponseti himself. Four physicians

129

(8%) supplemented their training with online resources, while only one participant (3.2%)

130

exclusively used online resources for training.

Experience with treating clubfoot and clubfoot practices
The majority of physicians reported treating clubfoot for greater than five years (n=16,

135

51.6%), with several physicians (n=10, 32.3%) with 2-5 years of experience and some (n=5,

136

16.1%) with < 2 years of experience. Over half of the physicians (n=17, 54.8%) reported treating

137

between 0 and 3 new clubfoot patients a month, while several (n=12, 38.7%) reported between 4

138

and 10 new clubfoot patients a month and only two (6.5%) reported more than 10 a month. The

139

majority of physicians (n=21, 67.7%) reported that, within the past year, more than two-thirds of

140

their patients completed the casting phase; eight (25.8%) reported a fraction between one-third

141

and two-thirds and only two (6.5%) reported a fraction of less than one-third. Most respondents

142

(n=17, 54.8%) reported a rate of over two-thirds for completing both casting and bracing; eight

143

(25.8%) reported a rate between one-third and two-thirds and the remaining (n=6, 19.4%)

144

reported a completion rate of less than one-third. The majority (n=22, 70.1%) reported that over

145

two-thirds of patients obtained a tenotomy; seven respondents (22.6%) reported a rate between

146

one- and two-thirds and the remainder (n=2, 6.5%) reported a rate of less than one-third.

Barriers to implementing the Ponseti method
The majority of physicians (n=25, 80.6%) agreed or somewhat agreed with the statement,

150

“I have all the material resources that I need to implement the Ponseti method” (Fig 1). The

151

remaining disagreed or somewhat disagreed (n=6, 19.4%). Similarly, the majority of physicians

152

(n=26, 83.9%) agreed or somewhat agreed that physicians have enough time to successfully

153

implement the Ponseti method; four (12.9%) disagreed or somewhat disagreed and one (3.2%)

Role of nonphysician staff in clubfoot treatment

168

Most physicians reported collaborating with others to treat clubfoot, most commonly other

169

orthopedic surgeons, nurses, physical therapists/physiotherapist, general practitioners, and

170

medical assistants (Table 3).

Free text responses to how assistants collaborate with surveyed physicians had several

176

recurring, major themes. The most prevalent theme (n=17, 54.8%) was that staff members assist

177

with cast application and/or cast removal. One physician added, “I work with a cast technician

178

and nurse. They help me with the treatment…I show them the [Ponseti] method” [Participant

179

24], illustrating an apprenticeship-like model between the physician and their assistants. The

180

other prominent theme (n=13, 41.9%) that arose is that educating caregivers is fundamental. One

181

participant stressed, “The education of parents about the regimen of the plaster and the bracing

182

stage is extremely important” [Participant 26]. Only two (6.5%) participants commented on the

183

importance of non-physician staff assisting by obtaining casting and bracing supplies.

184

Fourteen surveyed physicians (45%) believe there is a role for nonphysician staff in

185

clubfoot treatment, while 13 (42%) did not believe there was an appropriate role, and four

186

(12.9%) were unsure (Fig 3). Of physicians who do believe nonphysician staff have a role, the

10
187

most prominent theme (n=10, 32.3%) that emerged from free-text explanations was that there is

188

a need for collaboration when implementing the Ponseti method:

189
190

“For the casting, two are required…” – [Participant 23]

191
192

“It is a teamwork. The success of a good plastering will also depend on the collaboration

193

between plasterers.” – [Participant 19]

194
195

Other physicians expanded on this idea, stressing the need for professionals outside of orthopedic

196

surgery:

197
198

“The treatment involves a lot of factors beyond simple corrections of the deformity…It

199

requires solutions/alternatives of various areas beyond medicine.” – [Participant 20]

200
201

“…This treatment requires an integral approach, therefore several professionals in

202

health are involved, as well as administrative...” – [Participant 11]

203
204

In addition, some physicians (n=3, 9.7%) elaborated on the assistance non-physicians can

205

provide in educating patients about clubfoot. One participant (3.2%) stated that “it’s important

206

that each of the people who are interested in the method…those that form any part of medical

207

careers…receive the appropriate training” [Participant 24], advocating for the dissemination of

208

the Ponseti method for all healthcare practitioners who wish to learn. Two respondents (6.5%)

209

commented on how nonphysician staff can assist with building rapport with patients, such as

“providing assistance in doubts about the treatment or difficulties presented” [Participant 32] or

211

“extend[ing] contact with parents and follow-up” [Participant 23].

212
213
214

Fig 3. Percentage of responses to "Is there a role for paramedical staff in treating
clubfoot?"

215
216

Physicians who felt there was no role for nonphysician staff in treating clubfoot had

217

responses that mostly focused on the theme of logistical matters (n=9, 29%). Three respondents

218

(9.7%) explicitly stated that they were understaffed and did not have assistants, while others

219

(n=4, 12.9%) focused more on systematic barriers:

220

“The system doesn't allow for it.” – [Participant 7]

221
222

“[there is] lack of coordination within the health network” – [Participant 6]

223
224

“…in the hospital where I work, nursing is not allowed to help in these types of

225

procedures, even if they are needed.” – [Participant 12]

226
227

“I schedule the appointment of my patients.”’ – [Participant 30]

228
229

Two participants (6.5%) focused on the challenges that arise from inconsistent placement of

230

auxiliary personnel, stating that “there is no specific role for personnel since they take turns

231

rotating through different services every month” [Participant 26]. Only one participant (3.2%)

232

explicitly stated that implementing the Ponseti method should be strictly limited to doctors.

12
233

Of the physicians that were unsure of the role of nonphysician staff in treating clubfoot

234

(n=4, 12.9%), some (n=2, 6.5%) reported uncertainty because there were no assistants available

235

in their hospital and/or they were unfamiliar with the nonspecific essential function of

236

nonphysician practitioners. Others (n=2, 6.5%) commented on the commitment and

237

responsibility needed from nonphysician staff.

238

The most prominent theme that emerged from participants’ responses for how clubfoot

239

treatment could be improved in their country was improving the diffusion of Ponseti training

240

(n=18, 58.1%). In specific, some physicians called for “continuous training” [Participant 24] in

241

addition to training being “taught in an organized manner” [Participant 30]. Some physicians

242

(n=5, 16.1%) additionally called for changes at the healthcare system level that would assist in

243

the diffusion of the Ponseti method by, for example:

244

“…train[ing] at the primary care level to recognize clubfoot that requires the Ponseti

245

method…creat[ing] new Ponseti Clinics and includ[ing] them in the Ministry of Health

246

programs.” – [Participant 23]

247
248

“…implementing [Ponseti] in the national pediatric care program…[as] it should be

249

part of the evaluation and comprehensive management of child’s health”- [Participant

250

19]

251
252

“…establish[ing] an efficient flow (order) of taking people or things to the treatment

253

center…”- [Participant 20]

254

13
255

“…demonstrating the results, making them public…mak[ing] it possible to have the

256

Ministry of Health commit to the treatment” [Participant 21]

257
258

Similar to providing better, more systemically available training on the Ponseti method, another

259

major theme (n=7, 22.6%) was that a greater quantity of personnel for treating clubfoot is

260

needed. For example, one physician commented that they “have to make time to practice the

261

Ponseti method” [Participant 27] since they are responsible for all urgent cases presenting to

262

their hospital, illustrating that no other personnel are available to do both. Another participant

263

stressed how “it would be ideal to be able to count on a nursing staff for consultations”

264

[Participant 13]. These comments reiterate the need for additional staff for clubfoot care.

265
266
267

Discussion
This study is the first survey to assess the role of, and orthopaedic surgeon’s attitudes

268

towards, task sharing the Ponseti method in Latin America. Our results illustrate that physicians

are equally divided on whether there is a role for nonphysician staff in clubfoot treatment, with

270

most who are unsure or doubtful indicating primarily logistical concerns (e.g. the quantity of

271

nonphysician assistants and the quality of their training) as barriers. However, there is consensus

272

amongst the providers for disseminating and improving the Ponseti training in order to expand

273

access to clubfoot treatment.

274

With new methods of information dissemination such as low-bandwidth training sessions

275

on cellphones, mHealth applications, and nationwide training programs (e.g. Brazil’s

276

standardized, national “Ponseti Brazil” workshops), clubfoot patient volume and services are

277

likely to increase (19, 20). However, the current volume of orthopedic surgeons in Latin America

trained in the Ponseti method will unlikely be able to deliver and maintain high-quality clubfoot

279

treatment with this increasing demand for services. Our results illustrate that many physicians

280

see at least one child with clubfoot weekly; while this is a small number, the chronicity and

281

natural progression of clubfoot multiplies the effect that one clubfoot patient has when compared

282

to acute, non-progressive conditions.

283

An additional finding from this survey is that there is low caregiver compliance with

284

bracing and high rate of failure to return to clinic. Both findings act as major barriers to treatment

285

and have been mirrored in previous studies (4, 7, 8). Studies from New Mexico and New

286

Zealand, for example, have found that lack of adherence with bracing is the largest risk factor for

287

clubfoot recurrence (21, 22). Nonphysician providers trained in the Ponseti method could

288

potentially improve bracing adherence through, for example, home visits, for patients who need

289

bracing care. Nonphysician providers thus could provide a supplemental and novel role in task

290

sharing clubfoot care, and their involvement could facilitate both treatment and prevention of

291

recurrence. Moreover, as patient education was routinely listed as one of the main barriers to

292

successful treatment, Ponseti-trained nonphysician personnel could facilitate the spread of the

293

Ponseti method and expand access to treatment by educating and empowering patients and their

294

caregivers to receive optimal care (5, 7, 8). In short, sharing the task of providing caregiver

295

education may alleviate the burden disproportionally placed on a scarce supply of orthopedic

296

surgeons.

297

The results from this survey demonstrate that some physicians are amenable to having

298

nonphysician staff assist in clubfoot treatment. We conclude that nonphysician personnel may

299

provide human resources to fill the growing clubfoot treatment gap. While ensuring resources are

300

not diverted away from surgical specialists, adequate support and training are needed in task

301

sharing to ensure that (1) quality of care is maintained and that (2) the task sharing initiative can

302

be scaled up adequately (10). Still, training alone is not enough; continued supervision is needed

303

to ensure that non-specialist staff are confident in their tasks, carrying them out to a high quality

304

and being able to ask questions as necessary. Adequate recognition and remuneration are

305

additionally important to maintain motivation for non-specialist staff in carrying out their new

306

tasks. Ultimately, task sharing – for the Ponseti method or any other clinical treatment – requires

307

clear communication and mechanisms to support monitoring, supervision and evaluation.

308

Strengths and limitations
Strengths of this study include the geographic diversity of the physicians that provided

311

data, which may allow for broad implications of the results. Survey anonymity additionally adds

312

to the quality and subjectivity of the data collected. Study limitations include having a small

313

study sample size, in addition to potential selection bias given the mode of survey distribution

314

(e.g. online, via email).

315
316
317

Conclusion
In Latin America, many clubfoot treatment providers report collaborating with non-

318

physicians to implement the Ponseti method. While physicians who treat clubfoot have mixed

319

opinions on the role of nonphysicians treating clubfoot, most report logistical concerns and

320

insufficient training as barriers. Given this and the need for better, more accessible clubfoot care

321

across Latin America, future clubfoot treatment efforts may benefit from incorporating task

322

sharing between orthopedic surgeons and non-physician personnel.
