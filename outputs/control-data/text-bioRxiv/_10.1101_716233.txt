ABSTRACT: Here we present GFP-orthogonal optically controlled reagents for reliable and repetitive in
cellulo modulation of microtubule dynamics and its dependent processes. Optically controlled reagents (“photopharmaceuticals”) have developed into powerful tools for high-spatiotemporal-precision control of endogenous
biology, with numerous applications in neuroscience, embryology, and cytoskeleton research. However, the restricted chemical domain of photopharmaceutical scaffolds has constrained their properties and range of applications. Styrylbenzothiazoles are an as-yet unexplored scaffold for photopharmaceuticals, which we now rationally
design to feature potent photocontrol, switching microtubule cytoskeleton function off and on according to illumination conditions. We show more broadly that this scaffold is exceptionally chemically and biochemically robust
as well as substituent-tolerant, and offers particular advantages for intracellular biology through a range of desirable photopharmaceutical and drug-like properties not accessible to the current classes of photoswitches. We expect
that these reagents will find powerful applications enabling robust, high precision, optically controlled cell biological experimentation in cytoskeleton research and beyond.

Introduction:
Molecular photoswitches have been used to install optical control over a broad range of phenomena, with
applications from material sciences1,2 through to reversible photocontrol of ligand binding affinities3 and manipulation of diverse cellular processes in chemical biology4,5. For studies of temporally-regulated and spatially anisotropic biological systems, particularly those that simultaneously support several cellular functions, photoswitchable inhibitors conceptually enable a range of powerful studies not accessible with other tool systems.6-8
A prime example of such spatiotemporally regulated, multifunctional systems is the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton. This complex cellular network plays central roles in nearly all directed mechanical processes, such as
intracellular transport and cell motility; its crucial function in cell proliferation has also made it a central anticancer drug target.9-11 Yet, whereas cytoskeleton research typically aims to study a subset of MT-dependent processes that are spatially and/or temporally localised, nearly all MT inhibitors reported as tool compounds for biological research are drugs that are active wherever they are distributed, including at sites and at times where drug
activity is not desired.12 This restricts the scope of applications and utility of these inhibitors for selective research
into the various, highly dynamic, anisotropic processes dependent on MTs.13
The structure of the colchicine site MT inhibitor combretastatin A-4 (CA4; Fig 1a)14 has recently inspired
photoswitchable solutions to the problem of achieving spatiotemporal control over MT inhibition. CA4 is a stilbene whose Z-isomer (cis) binds tubulin, acts as a low nanomolar cytotoxin in cellulo, and reached Phase III trials
as an anticancer drug.15,16 Crucially, its E-isomer (trans) is several orders of magnitude less bioactive.17 An approach to microtubule photocontrol via photoisomerisation of its bridging C=C bond has been proposed, whereby
bioactive Z-combretastatins should be generated in situ from inactive E-precursors, allowing spatially and temporally precise application of antimitotic bioactivity.18 However, to the best of our knowledge this concept has not
been realised in biology, hindered by the bio-incompatible short-wavelength illumination required (λmax ~ 300 nm)
and the irreversible photochemical degradations that stilbenes undergo in aerobic conditions (e.g. oxidative
6π-electrocyclisation).19
Instead, designing CA4 analogues incorporating the synthetic azobenzene photoswitch scaffold inside their
pharmacophore - a design strategy known as “azologisation”20 - delivered the biocompatibly-switchable, azobenzene-based Photostatins (PSTs; Fig 1a)6,21-23, which undergo optically reversible, bidirectional photoswitching
between inactive E and MT-inhibiting Z isomers using low-intensity visible light. The PSTs have enabled specific
optical control over MT structure and dynamics in live cells and animals6 and have resolved key biological questions in mammalian development and neuroscience. These applications illustrate the power of photopharmacology
to enable previously inaccessible studies of spatiotemporally anisotropic processes without genetic engineering,
which is particularly important for studies of cytoskeletal scaffold proteins, since no optogenetic methods have yet
been developed that can control their structure-dependent functions.7,8,24,25
However, azobenzene-based approaches to photocontrol of intracellular biology incur serious general disadvantages, which are well illustrated by the example of the PSTs. Firstly, in cellulo, PSTs were shown to be ~2
orders of magnitude less potent than CA4. In general, we are also unaware of any azobenzene-based photopharmaceuticals that feature strongly photoswitchable bioactivity against cytoplasmic intracellular targets in cellulo
(i.e. the diazene is intact, to provide photoswitchability), yet do not exhibit substantial loss of potency compared
to their parent structures. Potency loss has been presumed22 to result from sequestration/degradation initiated by
glutathione (GSH) addition to the N=N double bond once the azobenzene enters the cytoplasm ([GSH] ~
5-10 mM); this GSH susceptibility is known to affect the majority of azobenzenes26,27 and can cause rapid destruction particularly of electron-rich systems.28 This loss of potency, and the potential for uncharacterised degradative metabolites, obstruct robust applications of “azologues” especially in vivo (high doses required, degradation byproducts have to be evaluated) and this is expected to be a general phenomenon for azobenzenes applied to
intracellular protein targets.22,29 Secondly, the Z-to-E spontaneous relaxation halflives of the water-soluble PST
derivatives appropriate for in vivo work were restricted to the range of 1 - 60 min, requiring re-illumination of
samples during most studies. This especially disfavored long-term applications: we have observed re-illuminations to cause photobleaching of fluorescent labels on tubulin6 as well as nonspecific photodamage in cell biology.
Also, long-term spatially precise re-illuminations are problematic to deliver in (motile) embryos and animals.
Thirdly, azobenzenes such as PSTs are strongly photoisomerised by excitation wavelengths of typical imaging
labels used in biological studies, being rapidly switched to ~3:1 E:Z under 488 nm (GFP/fluorescein imaging) and
to ~4:1 E:Z under 514 nm (YFP/Cy3). Since the spatiotemporally-resolved application of the photoswitch is therefore prevented by imaging under these conditions, its practical potential to fulfil research uses both in cell biology
and particularly in transgenic animals (where the most common imaging tag is GFP) is limited.30
We perceive that these three problems intrinsically associated to the azobenzene’s N=N double bond (nonorthogonality to standard imaging conditions, cellular/metabolic liabilities in intracellular settings, and substituent-dependent limits on thermal halflife scope) have largely prevented the translation of azobenzene photopharmaceuticals for intracellular targets from cell-free / cell culture settings, into more rewarding yet more complex in

vivo research applications for controlling biological model systems up to higher animals. We were therefore motivated to develop new photoswitchable scaffolds avoiding these three problems – both for the specific case of photoswitchable MT inhibitors, as well as for general applications to chemical biology – and to examine their performance features that could suit them to more robust, orthogonal, biological photocontrol in complex systems.
To this purpose, we here explored styrylbenzothiazoles (SBTs) as alternative photoswitchable scaffolds,
and evaluated them for chemical biology use by creating SBT-based MT-inhibiting photopharmaceuticals whose
applications we demonstrate especially in live cell studies with in situ photoswitching. We expected that, as compared to azobenzenes, the central C=C double bond of styrylbenzothiazoles31,32 would endow them with increased
robustness towards GSH reduction and higher thermal stability of the Z state, while avoiding photoresponse to
wavelengths above 460 nm (due to the absence of an n-π* band)33; yet that, compared to stilbenes, the benzothiazole would redshift the π-π* band enough to be photoswitched with visible light34 while also blocking photochemical degradation.35 Accordingly, we synthesise a rationally designed series of SBTubs (SBT-based tubulin-inhibitors) and evaluate them as biochemically robust, GFP-orthogonal, photoswitchable analogues of CA4. We obtain
ligand-protein crystal structures confirming their two modes of tubulin binding, then demonstrate their optical
control over MT network integrity, cell division and cell death, which is to our knowledge the first use of
styrylbenzothiazoles as photopharmaceuticals in chemical biology. Finally, using their unique photoresponse characteristics, we demonstrate that they enable temporally reversible, optical modulation of MT dynamics independently of ongoing imaging, in live GFP-tagged cells.

Results
Design and Synthesis. We designed two orientations of SBTubs as closely isosteric replacements of the
MT inhibitor CA4 in the expectation that these SBTubs would display Z-isomer-specific MT-disrupting effects.
These became SBTub2 (where the benzothiazole ring replaces the “north,” isovanillinyl ring of CA4), and
SBTub3 (where the benzothiazole replaces the “south,” trimethoxyphenyl ring; Fig 1a). Since we expected that
the benzothiazole would give similar space occupancy, geometry and polarity intermediate as the replaced rings,
and since the colchicine site is known to be somewhat accommodating16,36 particularly of north ring bicyclic aromatics, we expected that both these Z-SBTubs would bind satisfactorily despite having sacrificed some potencyenhancing point interactions. E-SBTub2 has in fact been reported as a cytotoxic resveratrol analogue targeting
tubulin, where its E-geometry was established explicitly and extensive docking simulations were performed to
rationalise observed activity37,38. However, the E-activity stated in those reports disagrees with our experience6,39,40 and literature understanding16 of the requirements of the colchicine binding site. We decided therefore
to pursue our paper’s design logic paying particular attention to experimentally verify the isomer status and binding mode of the compound (discussion in Supporting Information).

In order to test the target-specificity of the SBTubs' bioactivities, we also designed permutation controls
(designed-inactive compounds) by swapping the positions of key bioactivity-controlling substituents. We have
previously reported permutation controls as a convenient and stringent method39 to distinguish between biological
disruption resulting from molecularly-specific binding to the target protein (which should be a feature of the designed-active compounds only), versus bioactivity from nonspecific interactions expected for typically hydrophobic photoswitch compounds (e.g., promiscuous binding to proteins, aggregation on proteins, compound precipitation, membrane disruption, phototoxicity, or photoswitch scaffold toxicity, which should also be observed for
closely regioisomeric permutations). To this end, we permuted methoxy and hydro groups of SBTub2 to create
designed-inactive SBTub1, and permuted hydroxy and methoxy groups of SBTub3 to create control SBTub4. ESBTub4 has also previously been synthesised in the context of ligands for platinum complexes41, although its
isomerisation to Z was not considered; here we require it specifically as a Z-isomeric control and accordingly we
pursued its synthesis and characterisation (discussion in Supporting Information).
E-SBTub1–4 were synthesised in good yields by aldol condensations of 2-methylbenzothiazole with the
corresponding aldehydes in the presence of a strong base (Fig 1a and Supporting Information).
Photoswitch performance. The spectral characteristics of the SBTubs were similar (Fig S1). The shift of
π®π* absorption maxima between the E- (~360 nm) and the Z-isomers (~305 nm) enabled directional photoisomerisations. Pleasingly, both isomers’ absorptions decreased sharply towards zero above 410 nm. This is important
for avoiding photoisomerisation under GFP imaging (488 nm), since we and others have found that small absorption “tails” far beyond absorbance maxima can cause substantial photoswitching in microscopy experiments (e.g.
in the azobenzene-based PSTs, the 561 nm laser line can photoisomerise a Z-isomer with absorbance maximum
445 nm). Our expectation was therefore, that the SBTubs’ absorption cutoff occurs at the optimum position to
avoid E↔Z photoisomerisations under 488 nm (“GFP-orthogonality”), while still permitting their photoswitching
in standard cell biology experiments by using the most common short-wavelength microscopy laser line, 405 nm.
Under physiological conditions, the SBTubs could be optimally E®Z photoisomerised with 360 nm light,
giving a photostationary state equilibrium (PSS) with Z:E ratio of ~85:15 (Fig S6); applying shorter or longer
wavelengths back-isomerised the SBTubs towards more E-enriched PSSs (Fig 1b-1c). We selected “dark” (all-E)
and “lit” (360 nm, mostly-Z; or 420 nm, mixed E and Z) illumination conditions for further use in long-term cell
culture.42 Pleasingly for our design aims, reversible photoisomerisations with high-power illuminations repeatedly
traversing the biologically applicable range 360 – 420 nm showed no signs of causing photodegradation, under
aerobic aqueous conditions (Fig 1d).
The SBTub spectra and photoswitching properties were entirely robust to variations of pH and solvent
(Fig S2). The metastable Z-isomers of all SBTubs could be quantitatively relaxed to E by warming to 50-60°C in
DMSO overnight, although at 25°C they showed no significant thermal relaxation within hours at pH~7 in aqueous media (Fig 1d). However, para-hydroxy SBTub4 thermally relaxed at pH~9 (Fig S3). We interpret its pHdependent relaxation resulting from resonance between the deprotonated phenolate (where the bridging bond is a
C=C double bond) and a quinoidal form (bridging C-C single bond, whose free rotation to the thermodynamically
more stable E conformation might occur quickly). This offers two opportunities for future applications of
styrylbenzothiazole photopharmaceuticals. Firstly, the Z-stability of para-hydroxy SBTub4’s Z isomer at pH~7
contrasts to both azobenzene and hemithioindigo photoswitches with para- (or ortho-) hydroxy or aniline substituents, that typically feature millisecond (azobenzene) to second (hemithioindigo) aqueous relaxation halflives
even at pH~7. This underlines the broader chemocompatibility of styrylbenzothiazoles as a photoswitch scaffold
for these functional groups, that are highly prevalent in bioactive molecules for many biological targets due to e.g.
their importance in creating high-affinity ligand-protein interactions. Secondly, the pH-sensitivity of para-hydroxy SBTub4’s relaxation rate suggests that pKa-modulation could deliver styrylbenzothiazoles relaxing on a
second or minute timescale at pH~7, such that local E®Z photoswitching could be combined with sample-wide
thermal relaxation to improve spatiotemporal localisation of the Z-isomer.
Finally, we investigated the possibility of two-photon absorption/excitation (2PA/2PE) to photoisomerise
SBTubs, which would promise increased spatial resolution of isomerisation compared to single-photon processes.43 This may be especially beneficial in cell-free studies requiring high spatial resolution, such as time-resolved spectroscopic studies of tubulin structural rearrangements following ligand isomerisation inside a lattice.
We used a mode-locked Ti-Sapphire laser at 780 nm to bulk photoisomerise SBTub3 in concentrated (5 mM)
DMSO solution, delivering 2PA/2PE inside a single voxel and relying on diffusion to reach Z/E-isomer equilibrium in the whole 8 µL sample. After 12 min of 2PA/2PE the isomer equilibrium did not evolve with additional
2PA/2PE illumination or with single-photon 360 nm illumination (Fig 1e, Fig S7), indicating that ~85% Z was
reached by 2PA/2PE alone. The SBTub scaffold can therefore be E to Z photoswitched via efficient, spatially precise 2PA/2PE isomerisation.
(Bio)chemical and photochemical stability. We next wished to assess key aspects of the SBTub scaffold’s
photochemical and biochemical robustness. We assayed the stability of both the E and Z-SBTubs to high-photon-

flux irradiation (Fig S4-5), observing them to be entirely photostable to >1 h continuous high-intensity UV irradiation (Rayonet photoreactor), underlining their outstanding photochemical stability. We also assayed their sensitivity to GSH addition (10 mM) (Fig 2a, Fig S8), monitoring changes due to thiol adduct formation, thiol additionelimination (that should return E-SBTub due to the sp3 intermediate), reductive degradation (involving a second
equivalent of GSH) or other compound loss mechanisms, yet no such changes were observed. This contrasts
markedly to the instability in our hands of similar Z-azobenzenes when challenged by GSH, including PST-1
(note however that our GSH challenge assay, which avoided the biologically irrelevant exogenous phosphine nucleophile TCEP, resulted in substantially less adduct formation/photoswitch destruction than literature methods22;
Fig S8-9). We also performed an early in vitro metabolic assessment of SBTub2 and SBTub3 for their suitability
as in vivo drugs, examining stability to processing by liver microsomes (Fig 2b), inhibition of representative cytochromes (Fig S11), and hERG channel inhibition (Fig S12). Especially for SBTub3 these assays did not indicate
typical drug development problems. We are unaware of such a demonstration for other photoswitch scaffolds.
Taken together, we consider these features of styrylbenzothiazoles’ performance as a photoswitch scaffold,
as well as their differentiating features compared to azobenzenes, very promising for further biological applications towards in vivo use. We thus began exploring the applicability of SBTubs as photoswitches for MT control,
and more generally as a new scaffold for photopharmaceutical use in cell biology research.

SBTubs photoswitchably inhibit microtubules in cellulo. Since prolonged inhibition of cellular MT
functions results in block of cell proliferation and ultimately in cell death, we first assayed the light-dependent
antiproliferative activity of the SBTubs by the MTT cell viability assay (Fig 2c) on HeLa cervical cancer cell line
(incubation either in the dark, or under pulsed illuminations with 360 nm or 420 nm light). Both SBTub2 and
SBTub3 were photoswitchably cytotoxic with ≫20-fold cytotoxicity enhancement under 360 nm illumination
conditions (IC50 ~1-2 µM with ~85% Z isomer) as compared to the dark experiments (IC50 ≫ 20 µM with ~100%
E isomer), highlighting the suitability of this photoswitch scaffold for long-term intracellular photopharmacology.
Neither of the permutation controls SBTub1/SBTub4 displayed significant or photoswitchable bioactivity. We
attributed the weak antiproliferative activity of all SBTubs at high concentrations in the dark, and of permutation
controls SBTub1 and SBTub4 also under illuminated conditions, as aggregation-dependent effects resulting from
poor solubility of the compounds at high concentrations as is known for similar motifs (this is examined in more
detail below).6,39 At this stage, the light-dependent in cellulo activity matching the design principles of the active

SBTubs, as well as the lack of obvious toxicity for their regioisomeric permutation controls, supported the assumption that SBTub2 and SBTub3’s cellular antiproliferative potency is based primarily on MT inhibition by the
in situ-photogenerated Z-isomers only.
To examine the molecular mechanism of light-dependent cellular bioactivity, we solved the structure of ZSBTub2 and Z-SBTub3 in complex with the tubulin-DARPin D1 complex44 to 2.05 and 1.86 Å-resolution by Xray crystallography, respectively (Table S1). Both active Z-SBTubs bind to the colchicine site (located at the interface of α- and β-tubulin; Fig 3a, Fig S17-S22), and as designed, they bind in opposite poses despite contacting
identical residues in the binding pocket. Z-SBTub2 adopts the “top-down” pose characteristic of trimethoxyphenyl-bearing CA4 analogues16, whereas Z-SBTub3 binds in the opposite “bottom-up” pose (Fig S20). The benzothiazole can therefore occupy the same space as either the trimethoxyphenyl or the isovanillyl unit of typical
colchicine-site inhibitors,40 giving an intriguing top-vs-bottom desymmetrisation of the photoswitch. This should
also allow rational design and tuning of SBTub-based photopharmaceuticals that project substituents such as
functionally diverse side-chains and reporters outwards from the colchicine binding site.39
We next assayed the potency of the SBTubs as light-dependent tubulin polymerisation inhibitors in cellfree assays using purified tubulin protein. SBTubs showed no inhibition of tubulin polymerisation under lightexcluded conditions (~100% E) but strong dose-dependent inhibition after illumination (Fig S10) clarifying their
mechanism of action as tubulin polymerisation inhibitors (also known as microtubule depolymerisers), as is expected for colchicine site ligands.

PST-1 (2.5 µM) shows significant G2/M arrest for SBTub2, SBTub3 and PST-1 under 360 nm pulsing (see also Fig S13).

We then began examining the cellular mechanism of SBTub bioactivity, by performing immunofluorescence imaging of the endogenous MT network structure in cells incubated with E/Z-SBTubs. SBTub2 and
SBTub3 caused no effects on MT network structure as the E-isomers, but dose-dependently caused mitotic arrest
and MT depolymerisation under 360 nm pulsed illumination with similar dose-dependency as in the viability assays (Fig 3b; Fig S14). Z-stack images revealed cells not clearly visible to single focal plane IF imaging, which
were substantially accumulated into rounded, mitotically arrested states (Fig 3c). These are hallmarks of treatment
with MT-inhibiting antimitotics, supporting the conjecture that SBTub2 and SBTub3’s strongly photoswitchable
cytotoxicity in cellulo arises from the Z-isomer inhibiting MT function. By contrast, the permutation controls
SBTub1 and SBTub4 showed no disruption of MT network structure under either illumination condition even at
high concentrations (Fig S14c), further supporting the MT-specific binding activity of Z-SBTub2-3.
If their major mechanism of bioactivity in cellulo is direct inhibition of MT function, Z-SBTs should induce
light-dependent G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest,16 and we tested this using flow cytometric analysis of SBTubtreated cells. We observed G2/M-arrest for both Z-SBTub2 and Z-SBTub3 (Fig 3d): but not for their E-isomers,
nor for either isomer of the permutation controls SBTub1 and SBTub4, even at the highest concentrations tested
(Fig S13a). This supports the notion that the E-SBTubs have negligible specific MT-inhibiting effects while the

appropriately substituted Z isomers potently and structure-specifically inhibit MT function, suiting both SBTub2
and SBTub3 to photoswitching-based optical control of MT-dependent processes.
With their photoswitchable cellular bioactivity now characterised, we then set out to demonstrate some of
the conceptual advantages that the photophysical and biochemical properties of the SBT scaffold endow upon the
SBTubs, when compared to azobenzenes and other major photoswitch types and when considering their most
likely domains of biological application.
Bulk isomerisation of SBTubs enables straightforward long-term MT photocontrol. Firstly, noting the
stability of their Z-isomers to biochemical challenge as well as to spontaneous relaxation under in vitro conditions
(Fig 2a-b), we were also interested to study whether a single E®Z isomerisation event could be used to apply
long-lasting bioactivity in cells without requiring re-illuminations throughout the assay (as is necessary with azobenzene-based PSTs that have relatively short relaxation halflives).6 We accordingly applied E-SBTub3 to cell
culture, isomerised it in situ to a majority Z population in the whole well using 18 seconds of low-power LED illumination at 360 nm, then shielded the cells from all outside light sources and observed cell viability 40 hours later.
The Z-SBTubs’ antiproliferative potency in this single-shot experiment (Fig 4a) nearly matched that observed
with pulsed re-illuminations, indicating the stability of the Z-SBTubs in cellulo in the long term (despite the presence of e.g. cellular thiols). This result should be compared with azobenzene-based PSTs which were essentially
inactive in the single-shot experiment, since reversible thiol addition-elimination and/or degradative metabolism
(see Fig 2a) as well as thermal relaxation deplete Z-PST levels rapidly (literature suggests within an hour22).

Figure 4 a Comparison of cellular antiproliferative activity assays of SBTub3 and PST-1 under “single-shot photoactivation” (lit18s: 75 ms pulses of ~1 mW/cm2 LED illumination per 15 s during a 1 h period) and ongoing illumination
(lit48h: same pulsed illuminations, continued over 48 h) protocols, shows the SBTub’s sustained pharmacological activity
after a single photoactivation period, differentiating it from the cognate azobenzene (HeLa cells, 48 h). b Disappearance
of EB3-GFP “comets” (due to nonspecific photobleaching and/or specific inhibition of tubulin polymerisation) during
live cell imaging under 488 nm. 488 nm-only imaging in the presence of SBTub3 (10 µM) reproduces the comet depletion
observed with cosolvent-only controls (native bleaching dynamics with 488 nm or alternating 488/405 nm pulses) indicating no E→Z photoconversion under 488 nm laser (i.e. E-SBTub is GFP-orthogonal). With alternating 488/405 nm
illuminations, SBTub3 induces a rapid shutdown of tubulin polymerisation dynamics similarly to PST-1 under 488 nm
illumination only (i.e. the azobenzene PST-1 cannot be used GFP-orthogonally).

SBTubs are photocontrollable orthogonally to GFP/YFP imaging. We next performed a conceptually
similar experiment with single cell imaging of microtubule dynamics and showed that bulk application of activated Z-SBTub maintains a blockade of MT dynamics without significant evolution over the experimental
timecourse even under 488 nm laser imaging (Fig S15). This encouraged us to more rigorously evaluate SBTubs
for their ability to effect in situ photocontrol over MT dynamics while avoiding interference from imaging of the
most common fluorescent labels GFP and YFP, which would allow fully orthogonal imaging and photocontrol in
live systems. This is a particularly important unsolved challenge for intracellular photopharmacology, which typically relies on imaging-based readouts, since conventional azobenzene4,6 and hemithioindigo39 photopharmaceutical scaffolds almost always feature uni- or bidirectional photoresponse to these imaging wavelengths such that
they would require complex and impractical light-compensation protocols to counteract isomerisation caused by
monitoring the experimental readout. SBTub E to Z photoisomerisation by 405 nm rapidly halted normal MT
polymerisation dynamics, but as expected from their sharp absorption cutoff above 410 nm, neither high-intensity
GFP (488 nm excitation) nor YFP (514 nm) imaging lasers significantly impacted either the formed Z-SBTub or,
in a separate experiment, the starting E-SBTub isomer (readout by EB3-GFP and EB3-YFP MT “comet” assays6,
Fig 4b and Fig S16; discussion in the Supporting Information). As photocontrol over the SBT scaffold is fully orthogonal to GFP/YFP imaging, we consider SBTs may be particularly well-suited for photopharmaceutical applications in biological systems where GFP and YFP reporters are used.
SBTubs can deliver temporally reversible, MT modulation in cellulo during GFP imaging. While the
present SBTubs could be locally E®Z photoisomerised with high spatiotemporal precision, they were explicitly
not designed for spontaneous Z®E reversion on biological timescales. However, we observed that addition of ZSBTub3 to cell bath solutions stopped cellular MT dynamics extremely quickly (Fig S16b), implying fast membrane penetration kinetics. This is an encouraging result, since achieving temporally reversible, spatially localised

cellular applications of lit-active photopharmaceuticals39 – which brings the major advantages of photopharmacology to cytoskeleton research – conceptually only requires spatiotemporal localisation of the activating photoisomerisation, as long as diffusion across membranes can reduce the intracellular concentration of the active isomer
below its inhibitory threshold. If inhibitor-target association is kinetically highly reversible and diffusion across
the cell membrane is fast, this concentration change may occur on a biologically relevant timescale; as long as
inhibitor dissociation immediately restores the protein’s function (as for colchicine domain inhibitors) – and particularly in systems with a highly nonlinear dose-response (such as the MT cytoskeleton) – such concentration
changes may result in full biological recovery on this timescale. When photoactivation is restricted to a single cell,
rather than the whole solution (as was done in Fig 4), then diffusion-based depletion of the the photogenerated
bioactive isomer can allow cellular functional recovery on the compound’s transmembrane partitioning timescale.
We therefore designed experiments to test the temporal reversibility of SBTub’s cell-localised modulation
of MT dynamics using another EB3-GFP “comet” assay, this time with cell-specific photoactivations. These allowed us to repeatedly pause and recover functional MT polymerisation during GFP imaging with statistics
closely aligning over many cells (averaged data in Fig 5a; single cells in Movie M1 and Fig 5b), demonstrating
that SBTubs can achieve highly reproducible, GFP-orthogonal, temporally reversible MT modulation in live cells.

Discussion and Outlook
Photopharmacological approaches to generate high-spatiotemporal-precision reagents for non-invasive
studies of endogenous protein function have made significant progress over recent years. Their original applications to neuroscience45,46 have now been extended to studies of membrane47,48 and intracellular6 biology, and recent advances such as long-wavelength-responsive photoswitches26,49,50 offer beguiling prospects for in vivo photopharmacology. However, the conceptual scope of photopharmacology has been somewhat chemically restricted,
in that the overwhelming majority of photopharmaceutical designs employ azobenzenes as the photoswitch moiety, and that independent of the desired biological target, the azobenzene motif incurs functional limitations on
biological applications: (1) the diazene’s nucleophilic and metabolic susceptibility is problematic for addressing
intracellular targets or when aiming at long-term, systemic in vivo applications; (2) its isomerisation-inducing nπ* transition in the blue-green spectral region overlaps with imaging of common biological tags (e.g. GFP/YFP)
such that orthogonal photocontrol is not possible; (3) azobenzenes face restricted substituent scope for cytosolic
applications as photopharmaceuticals, since if strong ortho/para-electron-donating groups (OH, NH2 etc) or pushpull substituent configurations are present, this causes µs relaxation rates meaning that the products are not bulk
photoisomerisable under biocompatible conditions in aqueous media (especially problematic since these substituents are powerful point interaction groups for establishing ligand-target interactions and specificity). Only recently
has the range of photoswitchable scaffolds incorporated into bioactive pharmacophores been expanded to include
dithienylethenes51 and hemithioindigos,39 and the development of novel scaffolds with promising photoswitchability is recognised as a valuable milestone even before achieving cellular applications.52
Here we aim to usefully expand the toolbox of photoswitches for chemical biology, by demonstrating that
styrylbenzothiazoles (SBTs) – a chemical scaffold with simplicity comparable to that of azobenzenes – can deliver
spatiotemporally-precise, photoswitching-based control over critical cell biology processes, but with (1) added
biochemical/metabolic robustness important for intracellular targets and in vivo application, (2) full orthogonality
to common imaging conditions enabling easy adoptation of the photoswitch in existing biological systems, (3)

alternative ranges of isomerisation-tolerant substituents (eg. para-OH) and relaxation rates. To this end, we have
demonstrated the biological applicability of SBTs by rationally designing two alternative geometries of SBTub,
each targeting tubulin with high specificity, highlighting the flexibility of this scaffold. We have shown in longterm cellular studies as well as in short-term live cell imaging that SBTubs can be used as a potent, rapidly-responsive, photochemically and biologically robust, GFP-orthogonal and cell-compatible tools for non-invasive
photocontrol of endogenous MT dynamics and MT-dependent processes.
While these first incarnations of cell-targeted SBT-based photopharmaceuticals do not allow majority Z®E
photoisomerisation in the near-UV or visible spectrum, we find that the photoswitching performance of the as-yet
unexplored SBT scaffold merits further attention for biological applications. For example, we succeeded in
demonstrating that SBTubs still enable temporally reversible live cell photocontrol studies, using standard microscopy illuminations. Diffusion-reliant reversibility can also be delivered by intracellular photouncaging, however,
even in this protocol SBTs offer several biologically important performance advantages. Typical photocage groups
(e.g. ortho-nitrobenzyl derivatives) feature a slow intermediate hydrolysis step that is rate-limiting for cargo release (up to the minute-scale), which drastically diminishes their precision of temporal reversibility in both photouncaging (off-to-on) and diffusion (on-to-off) processes; whereas the SBTs feature near-instantaneous photoresponse and reproducibly high-temporal-precision biological control. Furthermore, photouncaging byproducts are
often panspecifically toxic and may also be phototoxic53, in stark contrast to SBTub’s clean and photochemically
robust E→Z photoconversion which allows cell-tolerated long-term experimentation. In a practical sense for experimenters, accidentally light-exposed SBT stocks can be thermally relaxed quantitatively back to the E isomer
by warming, in contrast to photouncaging probes that must be protected from irreversible ambient light-induced
photodegradation during synthesis, storage and use. Lastly, we show that SBTs can also be straightforwardly integrated inside a bioactive scaffold avoiding penalties of compound complexity, in contrast to photouncaging strategies that increase synthetic cost and molecular weight, often penalising biodistribution.53,54 We consider these as
promising features for SBT applications to high-precision, reproducible, “clean” phototriggered biological control.
By unifying photochemical and biochemical robustness, the SBT scaffold’s performance is particularly desirable for tissue slice or in vivo contexts. The excellent GSH resistance of SBTs as compared to azobenzenes (stability to intracellular environments) recommends them for addressing intracellular targets, and their microsomal
stability may enable systemic applications in animals. Furthermore, SBTub bioactivity can be photolocalised in
the long term via an experimentally straightforward single illumination. This avoids the requirement for repeated
precisely-relocalised illuminations which can be experimentally problematic to apply in motile tissues of freemoving animals – and which more rapidly-relaxing photopharmaceutical systems such as azobenzenes (when the
latter can survive long-term exposure to intracellular conditions) require. It also reduces the overall photon flux
SBTs require for operation. The SBTubs’ violet-light operation and their extreme photochemical robustness under
biological conditions also differentiates them from previously proposed but not yet in situ-demonstrated55 deepUV-operated stilbene-based probes, which are likely to suffer electrocyclisation-oxidation degradation56.
Particularly in the context of in vivo microtubule research it should be pointed out that CA4-like MT inhibitors (which SBTubs mimic) are most often applied as vascular disrupting agents and studied using surface-illumination imaging by one- and two-photon microscopy57 – which we here demonstrate are feasible approaches to
photoswitch the SBT scaffold. In these superficial tissue settings, the penetration of violet light required for
SBTub isomerisation is not problematic; our ongoing results as well as published reports58 have shown successful
subcutaneous isomerisation of photoswitches even with simple transdermal 360 nm LED illumination. Rather
than light accessibility for tissues, we consider that two compound-specific factors are likely to determine the success of reaching in vivo applications with in situ-actuated photoswitches for intracellular targets. One is systemic
pharmacokinetics (PK); while no reports of photopharmaceuticals’ PK have yet been published, metabolic stability and druglikeness – as the SBTs feature – are positive signs. The second is the ability to robustly photomodulate
intracellular biology, which relies on the intracellular biochemical stability of the bioactive isomer, and in this respect SBTs show superior performance compared to the cognate azobenzenes. We therefore consider the SBTubs
to offer exciting potential for in vivo translation within the context of MT photopharmacology.
Lastly, the design logic of scaffold hopping from azobenzene to SBT is in our opinion an exciting advance
for photopharmaceutical design. Progress within photopharmacology has recently been stimulated by general
strategies to reshape aspects of azobenzene performance without requiring pharmacological redesign; and in this
vein, diazocines59,60, tetra-ortho-substitutions50 and azoniums27 are all garnering rapid and widespread applications. The rational design and biological success of the present work similarly suggests that much of the existing
azobenzene-based photopharmacology can be straightforwardly grafted onto the new and potentially more robust
SBT scaffold when it is desirable to improve performance on intracellular targets or in vivo, or to achieve more
straightforward optically orthogonal applications to live-imaging-based biological studies.
In closing, we predict that the SBTubs themselves will contribute greatly to high-precision tubulin cytoskeleton studies and manipulation in neuroscience, motility, and embryology, in the cellular and potentially also
the animal contexts. Beyond the power of SBTubs as photopharmaceutical MT inhibitors, we believe that their

imaging-orthogonal biocompatible isomerisation, high photochemical and biological robustness, druglikeness,
and tolerance for drug-important polar functional groups, are promising for broader SBT-based photopharmaceutical tool development addressing biology research applications that are inaccessible to current photopharmaceuticals: especially in the context of intracellular photocontrol of embryos and primary cell isolates of GFP/YFP animal models, as are extensively used in the fields of development and neurodegeneration.

Methods:
Full and detailed experimental protocols can be found in the Supporting Information.
Compound synthesis and characterisation. All reactions and characterisations were performed with unpurified, undried, non-degassed solvents and reagents from commercial suppliers (Sigma-Aldrich, TCI Europe
N.V., Fisher Scientific etc.), used as obtained, under closed air atmosphere without special precautions. Manual
flash column chromatography was performed on Merck silica gel Si-60 (40–63 µm). MPLC flash column chromatography performed on a Biotage Isolera Spektra system, using Biotage prepacked silica cartridges. Thin-layer
chromatography (TLC) was run on 0.25 mm Merck silica gel plates (60, F-254), with UV light (254 nm and
365 nm) as visualizing agents. NMR characterisation was performed on a Bruker Ascend 400 (400 MHz &
100 MHz for 1H and 13C respectively). HRMS was carried out by the Zentrale Analytik of the LMU Munich. Analytical HPLC-MS was performed on an Agilent 1100 SL coupled HPLC-MS system with H2O:MeCN eluent gradients through a Thermo Scientific Hypersil GOLD™ C18 column (1.9 µm; 3 × 50 mm) maintained at 25°C, detected on an Agilent 1100 series diode array detector and a Bruker Daltonics HCT-Ultra spectrometer (ESI mode,
unit m/z). IR spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Spectrum BX II FT-IR system. Full experimental details are
given in the Supporting Information.
Photocharacterisation. UV-Vis absorption spectra measurements in cuvette were acquired on a Varian
CaryScan 60 (1 cm pathlength) at room temperature with default compound concentrations of 25 µM and default
solvents of PBS at pH ~7.4 with 10–20% of DMSO as cosolvent. “Star” LEDs (H2A1-models spanning 360–
435 nm Roithner Lasertechnik; FWHM ~25 nm and 260 nm HP-LED Sahlmann Photochemical Solutions) were
used for photoisomerisations in cuvette that were also predictive of what would be obtained in LED-illuminated
cell culture. Spectra of pure E and Z isomers were acquired from the HPLC’s inline Agilent 1100 series diode array detector (DAD) over the range 200–550 nm, manually baselining across each elution peak of interest to correct for eluent composition. Two-photon excitation was performed using a mode-locked Ti-Sapphire Laser operating at 780 nm (Spectra Physics, Tsunami) with a pulse repetition frequency of 80 MHz (pulse with <100 fs) and
an output power of 0.65 W, coupled into an upright Zeiss Axiotech 100 microscope and focused with a 40× reflective objective (Thorlabs, LMM-40X-UVV, measuring sample transmittance using a HAL 100 illuminator (Carl
Zeiss) and a SP300i spectrograph equipped with a MicroMAX CCD camera for signal recording (both Princeton
Instruments), between 360 nm and 380 nm.
Tubulin Polymerisation in vitro. 99% purity tubulin from porcine brain was obtained from Cytoskeleton
Inc. (cat. #T240) and polymerisation assays run according to manufacturer’s instructions. Tubulin was pre-incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with “lit”- or “dark”-SBTub (20 µM) in buffer (with 3% DMSO, 10% glycerol); at time
zero, GTP (1 mM) was added and the change in absorbance at 340 nm was monitored over 15 mins at 37°C61.
Cell Culture. HeLa cells were maintained under standard cell culture conditions in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 U/mL streptomycin, at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were typically transferred to phenol red free medium prior to assays.
Compounds and cosolvent (DMSO; 1% final concentration) were added via a D300e digital dispenser (Tecan).
Cells were either incubated under “dark” (light-excluded) or “lit” conditions (where pulsed illuminations were
applied by multi-LED arrays to create and maintain the wavelength-dependent photostationary state isomer ratios
throughout the experiment, as previously described6).
MTT Antiproliferation Assay. Cells seeded in 96-well plates at 5,000 cells/well and left to adhere for 24 h
were treated with E-SBTubs under the indicated lighting conditions for 48 h (1% DMSO; six technical replicates).
Cells were then treated with 0.5 mg/mL (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT)
for 3 h; the medium was aspirated and formazan crystals were re-dissolved in DMSO (100 µL) before measuring
absorbance at 550 nm using a FLUOstar Omega microplate reader (BMG Labtech). Absorbance was averaged
over the technical replicates, and normalised as viability by reference to the cosolvent-only control (set as 100%)
and to zero absorbance (set as 0%).
Cell Cycle analysis. E-SBTubs were added to HeLa cells in 24-well plates (seeding density: 50,000
cells/well) and incubated under “dark” or “lit” conditions for 24 h. Cells were collected and stained with 2 µg/mL
propidium iodide (PI) at 4°C for 30 min. Following PI staining, cells were analysed by flow cytometry using a
FACS Canto II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) run by BD FACSDiva software. 30,000 cells were measured

per condition and the data were transferred to Flowing software for cell cycle analysis. Cells were sorted into subG1, G1, S and G2/M phase according to DNA content (PI signal).
Immunofluorescence Staining. HeLa cells seeded on glass coverslips in 24-well plates (50,000 cells/well)
were left to adhere for 18 h then treated for 24 h with SBTubs under “dark” or “lit” conditions as described above.
Cover slips were washed then fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde, quenched with 0.1% NaBH4, blocked with
PBS + 10% FCS, and treated with rabbit alpha-tubulin primary antibody (abcam ab18251; 1:400 in PBS + 10%
FCS) for 1 h; after washing with PBS, cells were incubated with goat-anti-rabbit Alexa fluor 488 secondary antibody (Abcam, ab150077; 1:400 in PBS + 10% FCS) for 1 h. After washing with PBS, coverslips were mounted
onto glass slides using Roti-Mount FluorCare DAPI (Roth) and imaged with a Zeiss LSM Meta confocal microscope. Images were processed using Fiji software. Postprocessing was performed only to improve visibility. For
maximum intensity projections, images were recorded at different focal planes by incrementally stepping through
the sample (step size 1-2 µm) and maximum intensity projections were obtained using Fiji software.
EB3 Comet Assay with whole-sample photoisomerisation.30 HeLa cells (12,000 cells/well) were seeded
on 8-well ibiTreat µ slides (ibidi) 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were transiently transfected with EB3-GFP or
EB3-YFP plasmids using jetPRIME reagent (Polyplus) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were
imaged 24 h later, under 37°C and 5% CO2 atmosphere using an UltraVIEW Vox spinning disc confocal microscope (PerkinElmer) equipped with an EMCCD camera (Hammamatsu, Japan) and operated with Volocity software. For photobleaching/wavelength orthogonality experiments, SBTub was added cautiously after focussing on
cells on the microscope stage, and the compound was incubated for 10 min before imaging; this avoids exposure
of the SBTub to focusing light, preventing unwanted isomerisation prior to imaging that could falsify results
when testing for GFP/YFP orthogonality. Cells were imaged either at 488 nm (GFP; 23% laser power, 400 ms exposure time, 45 frames/min) or 514 nm (YFP; similar parameters); optionally, cells were additionally exposed to
interleaved lower-intensity frames (250 ms) of SBTub-isomerizing 405 nm light for compound activation (45
frames/min). For EB3 comet statistics, 6 cells per condition from three independent trials were taken. First-order
exponential decay curves were fitted to each cell’s comet count timecourses and their values were normalised to
100% at time zero, enabling intercomparison of cells with different starting comet counts (depending on their size,
the position of the focal plane, etc). EB3 comets were counted with a Fiji software plugin based on the “Find
maxima” function from the NIH.
EB3 Comet Assay with temporally reversible cell-specific photoisomerisation. HeLa cells were transfected with EB3-GFP using FuGENE 6 (Promega) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were imaged
on a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope equipped with a perfect focus system (Nikon), a spinning disk-based confocal
scanner unit (CSU-X1-A1, Yokogawa) and an Evolve 512 EMCCD camera (Photometrics) with a stage top incubator INUBG2E-ZILCS (Tokai Hit) and lens heating calibrated for incubation at 37°C with 5% CO2. Microscope
image acquisition was controlled using MetaMorph 7.7, with GFP imaging at 491 nm (0.17 mW, 300 ms every
2 s) and compound activation at 405 nm (77 µW, 100 ms every 90 s), and images were acquired using a Plan Apo
VC 60× NA 1.4 oil objective. Comet count analysis performed in ImageJ using the ComDet plugin (E. Katrukha,
University of Utrecht, https://github.com/ekatrukha/ComDet).
Protein production, crystallisation and soaking. The DARPin D1 was prepared as previously described44. Tubulin from bovine brain was purchased from the Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas (Microtubule
Stabilizing Agents Group), CSIC, Madrid, Spain. The tubulin-DARPin D1 (TD1) complex was formed by mixing
the respective components in a 1:1.1 molar ratio. The TD1 complex was crystallised overnight by the hanging
drop vapor diffusion method (drop size 2 µL, drop ratio 1:1) at a concentration of 15.9 mg/mL and at 20°C with a
precipitant solution containing 18% PEG 3350, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate and 0.1 M bis-tris methane, pH 5.5. All
drops were subsequently hair-seeded with crystalline material obtained in previous PEG-screening, which resulted
in single and large (0.5 µm) TD1 complex crystals. The crystals were fished and transferred into new precipitant
solution drops containing 10% DMSO and compounds (E-SBTub2/E-SBTub3) at final concentrations 2 mM,
then 360 nm LED illumination was applied for 5 min to generate Z-SBTubs in situ. After 4 h of soaking in the
dark, the crystals were mounted for X-ray diffraction data collection.
X-ray diffraction data collection, processing and refinement. Data were collected at beamline X06SA at
the Swiss Light Source (Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Switzerland). The beam was focused to 30 × 30 µm, the
flux was 3 × 1010 photons/s and the data collection speed was 2°/s at an oscillation range of 0.2° per frame (see
Table S1). For TD1-SBTub2 and TD1-SBTub3, 210° and 220° of data were collected, respectively. Data processing was done with XDS62. Due to anisotropy, the data were corrected using the Staraniso server
(http://staraniso.globalphasing.org/). The structures were solved by molecular replacement using PDB ID 5NQT
as a search model63. The ligands and restraints were generated with the grade server (http://grade.globalphasing.org/) using their SMILES annotation. The structures were then refined iteratively in PHENIX64 with manual
editing cycles in COOT65.
