Abstract

20

Mutations in Parkin (PARK2), which encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase implicated in

21

mitophagy, are the most common cause of early onset Parkinson’s Disease (PD).

22

Hundreds of naturally occurring Parkin variants have been reported, both in PD

23

patient and population databases. However, the effects of the majority of these

24

variants on the function of Parkin and in PD pathogenesis remains unknown. Here we

25

develop a framework for classification of the pathogenicity of Parkin variants based

26

on the integration of clinical and functional evidence – including measures of

27

mitophagy and protein stability, and predictive structural modeling – and assess 51

28

naturally occurring Parkin variants accordingly. Surprisingly, only a minority of

29

Parkin variants, even among those previously associated with PD, disrupted Parkin

30

function. Moreover, a few of these naturally occurring Parkin variants actually

31

enhanced mitophagy. Interestingly, impaired mitophagy in several of the most

32

common pathogenic Parkin variants could be rescued both by naturally-occurring

33

(p.V224A) and structure-guided designer (p.W403A; p.F146A) hyperactive Parkin

34

variants. Together, the findings provide a coherent framework to classify Parkin

35

variants based on pathogenicity and suggest that several pathogenic Parkin variants

36

represent promising targets to stratify patients for genotype-specific drug design.

Introduction

39

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease.

40

Although most PD cases are sporadic, a fraction are familial and caused by mutations

41

in different genes (1). Mutations in the Parkin (PARK2) gene are the most common

42

cause of autosomal recessive early-onset parkinsonism (EOPD) and are believed to

43

result in a loss of Parkin protein function (2). Parkin variants include rearrangements

44

and copy number variations, such as deletions and duplications of exons, as well as

45

single nucleotide variants (SNVs) that cause missense, nonsense, or splice site

46

mutations (3-5). Of these, missense variants are the most frequently reported in PD

47

patients and, because they likely impede Parkin protein function rather than disrupting

48

protein expression, may represent viable targets for therapies that enhance Parkin

49

activity.

50

To envisage such genotype-specific therapies, the pathogenicity of the many

51

Parkin variants in the population first needs to be determined. The American College

52

of Medical Genetics and Genomics for Molecular Pathology (ACMG-AMP) has

53

outlined five standard terminologies to describe variants identified in genes that cause

54

Mendelian disorders (6). “Pathogenic” and “likely pathogenic” indicate a clear or

55

very likely disease-causing effect of a variant, respectively. Conversely,“likely benign,”

56

and “benign” indicate variants that are not disease-causing. Variants that cannot be

57

assigned to one of these four groups are designated as “uncertain significance”. Over

58

200 Parkin missense variants have been deposited in public repositories (4, 5, 7, 8).

59

However, to date, only a minority have been clearly annotated based on formal

60

criteria.

61

A clear assignment of a Parkin variant requires integrating different lines of

62

evidence that fall into two broad categories (9). Clinical evidence consists of the

63

association or segregation of the variant with disease (or the absence of) in human

64

cohorts or within families with multiple affected individuals. Functional evidence

65

refers to the consequence(s) of the variant, using experimental assays that measure

66

biochemical and cellular properties, as well as computational algorithms that model

67

the effect(s) of the variant based on protein structure and function. Clinical evidence

68

has a hierarchical relationship relative to functional evidence and prevails when a

69

discrepancy or conflict arises between clinical and functional observations (9, 10).

70

Parkin is a basally autoinhibited E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase, which contains an

71

N-terminal

72

zinc-coordinating domains, RING0, RING1, In-Between-RING (IBR), and RING2,

73

which form a core designated as the R0RBR (11). Parkin is activated by PINK1, a

74

mitochondrial kinase that is also implicated in EOPD (1). PINK1 accumulates on

75

damaged mitochondria upon depolarization, where it phosphorylates nearby Ub

76

(12-15). Parkin binds to phospho-Ub (pUb), which recruits Parkin to mitochondria

77

and facilitates PINK1 phosphorylation of the Parkin Ubl, which in turn fully activates

78

Parkin (16-18). Parkin then ubiquitinates multiple outer mitochondrial membrane

79

targets, triggering a feed-forward amplification loop, that leads to the clearance of

80

damaged mitochondria via autophagy (mitophagy) (reviewed in (19)). Some Parkin

81

missense variants found in patients have been shown to affect protein folding, Parkin

82

autoubiquitination, protein-protein interactions or recruitment to mitochondria (20-25).

83

However, as the pathogenic nature of most of these variants was not clear, the disease

84

relevance of the functional alteration remained to be determined.

85

Here, we characterized all Parkin missense variants found in public databases,

86

according to ACMG-AMP criteria. We then used a cell-based assay to quantify

87

Parkin-mediated mitophagy and Parkin protein levels. We also applied structural

88

simulations to explore the mechanisms underlying the observed functional alterations.

89

Integrating these data, we find that only a minority of Parkin variants can be

90

considered pathogenic. Interestingly, we identified several naturally-occurring Parkin

91

variants in the population that increase mitophagy in cells. Remarkably, such

92

hyperactive Parkin variants were able to rescue the impaired function of several

93

common pathogenic Parkin variants. Our study suggests that several pathogenic

103

disease (9). Briefly, data from population databases, including minor allele frequency

104

(MAF) and homozygote counts, and clinical records in PD-specific databases that

105

report PD patients or unaffected family members carrying missense variants in Parkin,

106

were examined to assign weighted points as pathogenic or benign to each variant

107

(Supplementary Fig. 1). The pathogenic points and benign points were summed-up

108

separately and compared to preset thresholds to assign the variants to one of the five

109

ACMG-AMP categories (Supplementary Fig. 2).

110

From the PD-specific databases, PDmutDB (3, 4) and MDSgene (5, 26), we

111

identified a total of 75 Parkin missense variants in PD patients (Fig. 1A). Most were

112

absent or very rare in the control cohorts from the original reports, possibly due to the

113

small sizes of the control cohorts. Therefore, we searched for the 75 variants in public

114

population databases and found that 51 of them were reported in dbSNPs (7) and in

115

the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), including high-quality variant calls

116

across 60,706 human exomes (8) (Fig. 1A). In ExAC, we also found an additional 164

117

Parkin missense variants (Fig. 1A). The classification of the missense variants using

118

clinical evidence allowed us to clearly designate thirteen variants in PD as pathogenic

119

or likely pathogenic and ten variants as likely benign or benign (Fig. 1A and Table 1).

120

The details of the points assigned to each variant are summarized in Supplementary

121

Table 1. Remarkably, large numbers of remaining variants lacked sufficient data to be

122

assigned to either the benign or pathogenic categories and were therefore designated

123

as of uncertain significance (Fig. 1A, Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1).

124

Parkin variants can be classified functionally in cells

125

Next, to determine the effects of the variants on Parkin function, we employed a

126

cell-based assay to monitor and quantify mitophagy using fluorescence-activated cell

127

sorting (FACS) in U2OS cells stably expressing inducible mt-Keima, a pH-sensitive

128

fluorescent protein that is targeted to mitochondria and exhibits a large shift in its

129

emission wavelength upon engulfment in the acidic compartment of lysosomes (27).

130

U2OS cells express very low level of endogenous Parkin, which is insufficient to

131

mediate mitophagy in response to the mitochondrial potential uncoupler CCCP (28).

132

In cells transiently expressing either wildtype (WT) Parkin or one of the Parkin

133

variants fused to GFP, the shift in mt-Keima emission was measured upon four hours

134

of mitochondrial depolarization with CCCP (Supplementary Fig. 3A). The GFP

135

intensity in untreated cells was also quantified as a measure of steady-state Parkin

136

protein levels (Supplementary Fig. 3B). The level of CCCP-induced Parkin-mediated

137

mitophagy and GFP intensity of the Parkin variants were normalized to that of WT

138

Parkin.

139

We analyzed all the variants that were designated clinically as pathogenic or likely

140

pathogenic, benign or likely benign (Fig. 1B). We also analyzed an additional

141

twenty-eight variants of uncertain significance, including variants that were reported

142

as homozygous or compound heterozygous in either the disease-specific databases or

143

in population databases (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Table 1). These variants

144

represented the most common missense variants reported in the human population

145

from public databases. Moreover, they were reported in 283 out of 309 families or

146

isolated patients carrying Parkin missense variants in PD-specific databases.

147

The thirteen Parkin variants classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic based on

148

clinical evidence all showed significantly decreased mitophagy (Fig. 1B). Seven

149

variants (p.R42P, p.V56E, p.C212Y, p.C253Y, p.C238W, p.R275W, and p.C441R)

150

also showed decreased GFP intensity (Fig. 1B), suggesting reduced protein stability.

151

Of these, all the variants in the R0RBR of Parkin formed inclusions to different

152

degrees, detected by fluorescence microscopy (Supplementary Fig. 4). In contrast, the

153

p.R42P and p.V56E variants in the Ubl domain showed lower overall GFP intensity

154

without visible inclusions. Thus, for a subset of pathogenic and likely pathogenic

155

Parkin variants, the observed defects in mitophagy are likely to stem from abnormal

156

protein folding and reduced protein stability. In contrast, all ten Parkin variants

157

classified as benign and likely benign based on clinical evidence exhibited similar

158

GFP intensity as WT and most, with three exceptions, also exhibited WT levels of

159

Parkin-mediated mitophagy (Fig. 1B). p.Q34R and p.A46T displayed decreased

160

mitophagy, whereas p.R334C showed an almost three-fold increase (Fig. 1B). Of the

161

twenty-eight variants of uncertain significance based on clinical evidence, fourteen

162

displayed similar GFP intensity and mitophagy as WT Parkin (Fig. 1C). Nine

163

displayed impaired mitophagy, three of which also showed decreased GFP intensity.

164

Surprisingly, five variants showed increased mitophagy (Fig. 1C).

165

The wide range of changes in Parkin levels and mitophagy prompted us to ask

166

whether we could classify the different variants into discrete groups. Variants that

167

significantly decreased Parkin protein levels and mitophagy were assigned to Group 1

168

(Fig. 2A and Table 1). Variants that severely (0-30% of WT) or moderately (30-60%

169

of WT) reduced Parkin-mediated mitophagy but displayed normal protein levels were

170

assigned to Groups 2 and 3, respectively. Group 4 consisted of variants that were

171

similar to WT, whereas Group 5 consisted of variants with increased (>140% of WT)

172

Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Interestingly, all the pathogenic or likely pathogenic

173

variants, classified based on clinical evidence, were assigned to group 1 or 2, whereas

174

all the benign or likely benign variants fell into group 3, 4, or 5 (Fig. 2A-B). This

175

suggested that the two functional measurements in our cell model could faithfully

176

discriminate the pathogenic variants from the “non-pathogenic” variants.

177

Integration of clinical and functional evidence refines the classification of

178

Parkin variants

179

We next examined which clinical features were most strongly correlated with

180

functional alterations. Among the variants that segregated with PD in families

181

(Supplementary Table 1), all but one (p.R33Q) severely altered Parkin function and

182

were assigned to groups 1 or 2 (Fig. 2C). However, it is important to note that

183

segregation analysis was only possible in ~30 families, as most reports only involved

184

single case reports without related family information (Supplementary Table 1).

185

Conversely, variants that were reported as homozygotes in ExAC were frequent in

186

Groups 3, 4 and 5 and not assigned to Groups 1 or 2 (Fig. 2D). Notably, several

187

variants that were reported in PD patients as homozygous or compound heterozygous,

188

nonetheless displayed WT Parkin levels and function (Fig. 2E). Most had relatively

189

high MAFs in ExAC (Supplementary Table 1), suggesting their presence in patients

190

was due to their high prevalence rather than pathogenicity. Taken together, our data

191

shows that variants segregating with disease in families impair Parkin function

192

(Groups 1 and 2), whereas variants that occur as homozygotes in ExAC did not

193

severely reduce Parkin function (Groups 3, 4 and 5).

194

Next, we devised a scoring scheme, based on Sherloc, to assign benign or

195

pathogenic points (Supplementary Fig. 5), according to the functional group to which

196

the Parkin variants were assigned in the cellular assays (Fig. 2A). The pathogenic

197

points and benign points were then added to the corresponding points from the

198

clinical evidence in order to obtain combined pathogenic and benign scores from all

199

evidence for the final annotation of each variant (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1).

200

Using these combined clinical and functional scores, all the likely pathogenic variants

201

from clinical evidence were reclassified as pathogenic (Table 1). Additionally, three

202

likely benign variants were reclassified as benign (Table 1). Most of the variants of

203

uncertain significance were reclassified as likely benign, while six were reclassified as

204

pathogenic and nine remained of uncertain significance (Table 1). In summary, all

205

variants that caused functional alterations assigned to groups 1 and 2, as measured in

206

our experimental assay, were reclassified as pathogenic, whereas most variants

207

assigned to functional groups 3, 4 and 5 were reclassified as either benign or likely

208

benign (Fig. 2F).

209

Structural analysis of Parkin variants reveals pathogenic mechanisms

210

As the structure of Parkin is known, we modeled the effects of variants on the

211

reported crystal structures of Parkin to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying

212

the functional changes. The structures of autoinhibited Parkin, pUb-bound Parkin,

213

p-Ub-bound phospho-Parkin, pUb-E2 enzyme-bound phospho-Parkin were used as

214

they depict Parkin in its different states of activation (17, 18, 29, 30).

215

Most variants in functional groups 1 and 2 were predicted to introduce steric

216

clashes with nearby residues in at least one of the Parkin structures. In contrast, most

217

variants in Group 4, which displayed similar function as WT Parkin, introduced no

218

major clashes and did not affect interactions (Fig. 3A-B). However, mild clashes were

219

observed in a few cases, suggesting that some degree of steric clashing could be

220

tolerated and possibly be compensated for by local conformation changes to maintain

221

overall protein function. For example, three variants at Arg42 were analyzed.

222

Mutation of Arg42 to proline introduced major clashes, whereas substitution to

223

histidine introduced mild clashes and there was no clash introduced by substitution to

224

cysteine (Fig. 3C-E). Congruently, only p.R42P was classified as pathogenic based on

225

clinical criteria and functional impairment in cell-based assays (Fig. 1B-C), consistent

226

with the simulations that showed this mutation unfolded the Ubl domain (22, 31).

227

These simulated steric clashes nicely illustrate how different amino acid substitutions

228

at a given residue could lead to distinct functional impairment.

229

The effects of variants in Groups 1 and 2 likely disrupt several different aspects

230

of Parkin function (Fig. 4A). Seven variants involve cysteine residues that coordinate

231

zinc, and their mutation would result in overall misfolding of the Parkin protein (29).

232

Five variants alter key motifs mediating ubiquitination of substrates, including steric

233

clashes with the E2 binding site on RING1 (p.T240R and p.T240M), and residues

234

implicated in thioester transfer of Ub in the catalytic RING2 domain (p.T415N,

235

p.G430D, p.C431F) (32). These types of alterations are likely to cause a complete loss

236

of Parkin function in either PINK1-Parkin mediated mitophagy or other potential

237

Parkin pathways. Four variants specifically localize to motifs implicated in the

238

conformational change that occurs during activation by PINK1. p.K161N and

239

p.K211N introduce no or mild steric clashes, but substitution of the basic lysine

240

residue to the neutral asparagine eliminates the interaction with the acidic phosphate

241

in pUbl (Fig. 4B and (17, 18)). p.G284R introduces major clashes with pUb, thus

242

impairing binding and recruitment to mitochondria (Fig. 4C). p.R275W disrupts

243

interaction with the helix that mediates pUb binding (Fig. 4D). This is predicted to

244

destabilize Parkin, consistent with the observed decreased steady-state protein level

245

and the presence of cellular inclusions (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. 4). This helix

246

becomes more exposed following pUb binding and may also be involved in the

247

allosteric release of the Ubl during activation (Fig. 4D and (17, 18)). The clashes

248

caused by p.R42P and p.V56E are predicted to misfold the Ubl domain and thus

249

destabilize the protein, as demonstrated earlier for p.R42P (22). Concurrently, p.R42P

250

and p.V56E may also hinder conformational change during activation by preventing

251

Ubl phosphorylation (33) and the binding of pUbl to RING0 (17). One variant,

252

p.P437L, introduced very mild steric clashes in RING2 in the Parkin structure, and the

253

exact molecular mechanism of p.P437L in causing decreased mitophagy remains

254

unclear.

256

Parkin-mediated mitophagy might also act by hindering Parkin activation by PINK1.

257

p.A46T could disrupt the interaction of pUbl with RING0 (Supplementary Fig. 6A).

258

p.R104W induced clashes to the newly identified activation element (ACT), which

259

binds RING0 and helps stabilize the interaction with pUbl and RING0

260

(Supplementary Fig. 6B and (18)). p.G359D disrupted the glycine-rich loop in the

261

IBR domain that interacts with pUb (Supplementary Fig. 6C). These clashes may be

262

compensated by minor local conformation changes, and thus lead to milder

263

disruptions in mitophagy and protein stability.

264

Structure-guided designer hyperactive Parkin mutants can rescue

265

mitophagy in pathogenic variants

266

We next hypothesized that some of the pathogenic variants may represent targets

267

for genotype-specific therapy. As a proof of concept, we introduced two artificially

268

designed mutations, W403A and F146A, which destabilized the REP (repressor

269

element of Parkin):RING1 and the RING0:RING2 interfaces, respectively. Both

270

mutations have been shown to accelerate mitophagy by promoting the conformational

271

changes that occur at these interfaces during Parkin activation by PINK1 (28, 29). We

272

tested whether these hyperactive mutations could rescue the mitophagy defects seen

273

in the pathogenic Parkin variants. As reported previously, mutating F146A or W403A

274

alone enhanced mitophagy compared to WT Parkin (Fig. 5A) (28). Remarkably,

275

278

(Fig. 1B). However, introduction of F146A or W403A did not restore Parkin levels to

279

WT (Supplementary Fig. 7), suggesting the rescue of mitophagy was mediated by

280

Parkin activation per se rather than by enhancing Parkin protein stability. The

281

pathogenic variants p.K161N and p.K211N are involved in binding the pUbl during

282

activation (17, 18). The fact that both these variants can be rescued by F146A or

283

W403A suggests that destabilization of the REP:RING1 or the RING0:RING2

284

interface can bypass the tethering of the Ubl to RING0, which occurs during Parkin

285

activation.

286

Introducing F146A or W403A in cis with the variants could not rescue any of the

287

seven pathogenic cysteines variants involved in zinc coordination (Fig. 5A). Thus, the

288

severe disruption of Parkin folding and stability induced by mutating these cysteines

289

are likely to preclude them from being good candidates for therapeutic rescue by

290

hyperactivation (Fig. 1B-C). Similarly, most variants that disrupted key catalytic sites

291

could not be rescued (Fig. 5A). Also, p.G284R could not be rescued as it disrupts

292

binding to pUb, which is an essential receptor for recruiting Parkin to damaged

293

mitochondria (34). Interestingly, whereas both p.T240M and p.T240R are predicted to

294

interfere with E2 Ub-conjugating enzyme binding to RING1 and showed similar

295

severe defects in mitophagy, only the former could be rescued by F146A or W403A

296

(Fig. 5A). Both variants created clashes in the E2 binding site (Supplementary Fig.

297

8A-B). However, Arg240 created a positive charge at the interface, increasing the

298

electrostatic repulsion of E2. Methionine is less bulky and neutral, and its flexibility

299

could allow some weak interactions with E2 to remain, perhaps explaining its rescue

300

by F146A or W403A (Supplementary Fig. 8C-E).

301

Overall, the defects in mitophagy of seven of the 19 pathogenic variants could be

302

rescued by the designed activating mutations. These seven variants are responsible for

303

over 75% of reported PD patients carrying pathogenic missense variants (Fig. 5B) and

304

were the most frequent pathogenic missense variants in the general population (Fig.

305

5C). Mimicking the effects of F146A or W403A could therefore be a useful starting

306

point for designing treatments for patients with PD caused by these Parkin variants.

307

Characterization of naturally-occurring hyperactive Parkin variants

308

We identified six naturally-occurring variants that, considering all the evidence,

309

were classified as likely benign or benign and showed enhanced Parkin-mediated

310

mitophagy (Fig. 1B, 1C and 2G). The Parkin structure shows that Arg234 and Arg256

311

are located at the interface between the REP and RING0. The p.R234Q and p.R256C

312

variants are predicted to destabilize the interface, thus mimicking the W403A

313

designer mutant used above (Fig. 6A). Additionally, p.M458L may destabilize the

314

RING0:RING2 interface, mimicking the effects of our other designer mutation,

315

F146A (Fig. 6B). Thus, based on structural predictions, three of the six

316

naturally-occurring variants are likely to activate Parkin via mechanisms akin to those

317

involved in the hyperactive mutants designed previously (28). Because these variants

318

occur naturally in the population, our findings demonstrating rescue of mitophagy

319

suggest that targeting these sites and mechanisms are likely to be tolerated and

320

potentially therapeutic in PD. p.P37L also moderately increased Parkin-mediated

321

mitophagy, but the structural basis of the increased activity was unclear, as this

322

variant does not create any steric clash and thus should not affect interactions of the

323

Ubl with RING1 or interactions of the pUbl with RING0 (Supplementary Fig. 9A-B).

324

Mutation of Arg334 to a cysteine could affect the coordination of a nearby zinc in the

325

IBR, which may stabilize the interaction with pUb and thereby enhance Parkin

326

activity (Supplementary Fig. 9C).

327

Unlike the five other naturally-occurring hyperactive variants, p.V224A has not

328

been reported in PD patients (Supplementary Table 1) and showed the highest (almost

329

3-fold above WT) Parkin-mediated mitophagy activity (Fig. 1C). The Val224 residue

330

is localized in the pUb binding pocket, with its side-chain facing towards the

331

phosphorylated Ser65 residue of pUb, and the mutation to alanine could modulate the

332

affinity of Parkin for phospho-ubiquitin (Fig. 6C). We therefore examined the ability

333

of hyperactive p.V224A to rescue the function of the pathogenic variants. Introducing

334

the p.V224A variant in cis did not affect the protein level of most pathogenic variants,

335

except for p.G284R (Fig. 7A). This may stem from an additive destabilizing effect of

336

the double mutant on Parkin folding as both p.V224A and p.G284R are located within

337

the same pUb binding motif. Introducing the p.V224A variant partially rescued the

338

mitophagy defects of p.R42P, p.V56E and p.K161N (Fig. 7B). How the predicted

339

effects of V224A on pUb-binding could partially compensate for defects in Ubl- and

340

pUbl-mediated activation by p.R42P, p.V56E and p.K161N remains to be elucidated.

341

p.V224A could not rescue the mitophagy deficit in p.R275W and p.G284R variants,

342

nor could it rescue any of the remaining pathogenic variants that directly damaged

p.V224A was less effective at rescuing the pathogenic variants, suggesting that the

347

Discussion

348

Parkin mutations are the most common cause of recessive early-onset PD

349

(EOPD) (2). Although Parkin loss-of-function is well established in EOPD (5, 35),

350

causality for any given missense variant has been more difficult to ascertain. In this

351

study, we have integrated clinical, experimental and structural modeling approaches

352

to map out the landscape of Parkin variants in the general population and in PD

353

patients. Our hope is that this work will help provide a more cohesive framework to

354

guide basic science studies exploring the molecular and cellular functions of the

355

PINK1/Parkin pathway and to guide clinicians caring for patients carrying specific

356

Parkin variants. We also hope that the work will inform structure-based drug design

357

to develop Parkin activators and help guide Parkin allele- and genotype-specific

358

clinical studies.

359

For the over 200 Parkin variants reported in public databases (3, 5, 8), we found

360

that only a minority of variants could be clearly designated as likely pathogenic,

361

pathogenic, likely benign or benign based on clinical evidence alone. While this may

362

not seem surprising for variants found only in population databases such as ExAC,

363

where accompanying clinical information is scant, we found a similar situation for

364

variants reported in patients. Indeed, 52 out 75 variants reported in PDmutDB and

365

MDSgene remained of uncertain significance after having been subjected to the

366

Sherloc algorithm, the variant classification framework derived from ACMG

367

standards that we used in this study. The overarching message from these

368

observations is that the mere presence of Parkin variants in PD patients, PD kindreds

18

369

or PD-specific databases should be interpreted with caution and not automatically

370

taken to imply pathogenicity. Rather, we propose that clinical evidence available for

371

new variants should be subjected to the same rigorous classification scheme presented

372

here to determine pathogenicity.

373

In addition to analyzing clinical evidence, we extensively characterized the

374

cellular effects of the 51 Parkin variants most commonly found in patient and

375

population sequencing databases. To our knowledge, a systematic analysis integrating

376

clinical evidence with cellular function, on this scale, has not been reported previously

377

for Parkin (20-25, 36, 37). Notably, all the variants designated as pathogenic or likely

378

pathogenic based on clinical evidence also displayed severe mitophagy defects in

379

cells (functional groups 1 and 2). Conversely, all variants designated clinically as

380

benign or likely benign displayed mitophagy function in the WT range or showed only

381

a slight reduction (functional groups 3, 4 and 5). While this may seem a priori as

382

self-evident, several alternative functions of Parkin in cells have been proposed and

383

the role of mitophagy in PD has yet to be definitively established (38-41). Thus, while

384

this work does not refute the biological importance of such alternative functions, the

385

tight correlation between the clinical impact of the variants and their effects on

386

mitophagy provides further evidence that mitophagy can be used as a robust and

387

disease-relevant readout of Parkin function that likely reflects a key pathogenic

388

process in PD.

389

Assignment of the Parkin variants to functional groups in cells allowed us to

390

determine which clinical features best correlate with and could be used to predict

19

391

pathogenicity. Segregation of variants with PD in families and observation of

392

homozygotes in ExAC turned out to be very strong predictors for pathogenicity or the

393

absence of pathogenicity, respectively. In contrast, the mere report of PD patients with

394

one or two Parkin variants or the absence of these variants in control cohorts or

395

population databases should not be automatically taken to imply pathogenicity.

396

Perhaps more importantly, integrating clinical with functional evidence from cells

397

allowed us to re-assign 19 of the 28 variants, designated as of uncertain significance

398

based on clinical evidence alone, to one of the benign and pathogenic categories. It

399

also allowed us to reclassify 6 of the “likely” variants to their respective more

400

definitive benign and pathogenic categories. Together, these findings attest to the

401

power of using this sort of iterative combined clinical and experimental approach to

402

stratify variants.

403

Given what is already known about the structure and function of the Parkin

404

protein, the work enables in-depth mechanistic exploration of how pathogenic

405

variants can lead to dysfunction. This is something that has been sorely lacking and

406

may have important implications for how best to target Parkin and design activators

407

for future therapy. For most of the pathogenic variants, the mechanisms by which they

408

interfere with function can be rationalized based on the Parkin structure. As an

409

important proof of concept, we showed that the function of several pathogenic Parkin

410

variants, defective in mitophagy in cells, could be rescued when expressed in cis with

411

mutations that have been previously designed to enhance Parkin activity (28, 29). This

412

provides further stratification according to therapeutic potential. For instance,

413

alterations in residues involved in zinc coordination, in catalytic activation or in

414

pUb-binding could not be rescued. In contrast, alterations in residues involved in Ubl

415

folding or in the pUbl-RING0 interface in the active Parkin structure could be fully

416

rescued, suggesting that therapeutics that disrupt the REP-RING1 or the

417

RING0-RING2 interfaces could potentially bypass these defects (17, 18). Importantly,

418

many of the most commonly occurring variants were the ones that could be rescued,

419

something that bodes well for patients carrying these variants, should a therapeutic

420

mimicking W403A or F146A become available.

421

One of the most surprising findings of our study was that several

422

naturally-occurring variants exhibited a 1.5- to almost 3-fold enhancement in

423

Parkin-mediated mitophagy in our assay. This could not simply be explained by

424

increased Parkin protein levels or by the fact that our assay involved overexpression.

425

Indeed, except for certain pathogenic variants that destabilized Parkin, most variants,

426

including the hyperactive ones, displayed steady-state levels that were very close to

427

WT levels. These hyperactive variants provide an important proof of principle that

428

there are, presumably healthy, individuals in the population living with enhanced

429

Parkin activity. The strongest activating variant was V224A, which increases

430

mitophagy by nearly 3-fold and occurs very near the site for pUb-binding. This was

431

surprising as pUb-binding serves as a critical receptor to recruit Parkin to

432

mitochondria and, to date, every reported mutation in this motif, abolished or

433

dramatically reduced mitophagy. Moreover, when expressed in cis, V224A partially

434

rescued certain, but not all, of the mutants that were rescued by W403A and F146A.

435

In the future, it will be important to test whether this involves an enhancement in

436

pUb-binding or some other downstream allosteric effect. Similarly, it will be

437

important to determine the mechanisms by which the two remaining hyperactive

438

variants, P37L and R334C, enhance Parkin function. Moreover, as we only sampled

439

51 of the over 200 Parkin variants in the population in this study, it is conceivable that

440

other yet-to-be-discovered hyperactive variants will provide further mechanistic

441

insights into Parkin activation and help identify additional therapeutic sites within the

442

protein.

Classification of Parkin missense variants

445

We utilized Sherloc (semiquantitative, hierarchical evidence-based rules for locus

446

interpretation), a variant classification framework derived from ACMG standards to

447

assign Parkin missense variants into five categories: pathogenic, likely pathogenic,

448

benign, likely benign and of uncertain significance (9). We considered two broad

449

categories of evidence for the classification, clinical and functional. The procedures

450

for evaluating and scoring these lines of evidence are summarized as root-decision

451

trees in Supplementary Fig. 1, 2, and 5.

452

For clinical evidence, information regarding missense variants in Parkin reported

in

Cell culture, cloning and mutagenesis

477

Human osteosarcoma U2OS cells were a gift from Dr. Robert Screaton (Sunnybrook

478

Research Institute). U2OS cells stably expressing mtKeima (a gift from A. Miyawaki,

479

Laboratory for Cell Function and Dynamics, Brain Science Institute, RIKEN, Japan)

480

were created by transfecting plasmid DNA using jetPRIME (Polyplus), followed by

481

selection with G418 for 2 weeks and sorting using flow cytometry (28). Cells were

482

maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 4 mM

483

L-glutamine and 0.1% Penicillin/Streptomycin, in a 37℃ incubator with 5% CO2. All

484

GFP-Parkin variants were generated using PCR mutagenesis on the GFP-Parkin WT

485

plasmid (addgene#45875) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Agilent

486

Technologies). Constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing.

h and treated with DMSO or 20 μM CCCP for 4 h and followed immediately by flow

cytometry. To minimize transfection efficiency variation, the same amount of

492

GFP-Parkin WT or variant plasmid was utilized and only the population of

493

GFP-positive cells were analyzed in the subsequent FACS data processing. For flow

dual-excitation ratiometric pH calculation where pH 7 was detected through the

excitation at 405 nm and pH 4 at 561 nm (28). For each untreated sample, 75,000

events were collected and single GFP-Parkin-positive cells were subsequently gated

501

for quantification of the geometric mean of the GFP signal as a measure of

502

steady-state Parkin protein levels. The value for each Parkin missense variant was

503

normalized to that for the WT in each experiment. For each untreated and treated

504

sample,

505

subsequently gated. The percentage of cells with an increase in the 405nm:561nm

506

ratio in mtKeima was quantified. The percentage in treated cells minus the percentage

507

in untreated cells was calculated as the induced Parkin-mediated mitophagy. The

508

induced mitophagy for each Parkin missense variant was normalized to that for WT in

each repeat. Data was analyzed using FlowJo v10.1 (Tree Star).

For statistical analysis of mitophagy and protein levels, one-way analysis of variance

hyperactive mutants to rescue Parkin variants, two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)

and Bonferroni post-hoc test comparing row factors among the single or double

major clashes (red disks), which would destabilize the β-sheet in the Ubl. (D)

705

Substitution of the arginine side chain (black) to histidine (white) introduced mild

706

clashes (red and green disks). (E) Substitution of the arginine side chain (black) to

707

cysteine (white) did not introduce any clashes.

Figure 4. Structural analysis of Parkin variants revealed various pathogenic

709

mechanisms. (A) Pathogenic variants were mapped onto the 3D structure of human

710

Parkin bound to phospho-ubiquitin (PDB 5N2W). The side-chains of the amino acids

711

substituted by the variants were highlighted in black. The blue spheres represent the

712

phosphate of pUb. The grey spheres represent zinc. The color of the text indicates the

713

type of disruption to Parkin caused by the variant. (B) Close-up view of pUbl-RING0

714

interface in the structure of fly pParkin bound to phospho-Ub (PDB 6DJX). Lys161

715

and Lys211 form ionic interactions with the phosphate on Ser65 of the pUbl.

716

Mutations of these lysine residues would weaken the pUbl-RING0 interaction,

717

preventing activation of Parkin. (C) Close-up view of the pUb:RING1 interface in

718

human Parkin bound to pUb (PDB 5N2W). The G284R variant in Parkin RING1

719

would introduce major clashes with pUb, disrupting the interaction. (D) Close-up

720

view of Arg275 in human Parkin bound to pUb (PDB 5N2W). Arg275 interacts with

721

Glu321 in the helix that interacts with pUb. Mutation to a tryptophan (white) would

722

introduce clashes with this helix as well as Ser10 in the Ubl domain.

727

mediated by each Parkin missense variant was normalized to that of WT Parkin in

728

each replicate. * P<0.05, ** P<0.01, in two-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post-hoc

729

test comparing the function of each variant with the variant in cis with W403A or

F146A. N=3-7. (B) The number of families or individuals with PD carrying the

731

pathogenic missense variants for which mitophagy was or was not rescued by the

732

designer mutations are shown. (C) The sum of the MAF in ExAC of the pathogenic

733

missense variants for which mitophagy was or was not rescued by the designer

734

736

Parkin variants. (A) Close-up view of R234Q and R256C variant sites in the

737

structure of human Parkin bound to pUb (PDB 5N2W). Arg256 forms a hydrogen

738

bond with Glu402, and its mutation to a cysteine would destabilize the REP:RING1

739

interaction, similar to W403A. The side-chain of Arg234 also stacks with the indole

740

ring of Trp403. (B) Close-up view of M458L variant site in the RING0:RING2

741

interface (PDB 5N2W). M458L introduced major clashes that would destabilize the

742

RING0:RING2 interaction, similarly to F146A. (C) Close-up view of V224A variant

743

site (PDB 5N2W). Val224 interacts with pUb and forms van der Waals force

744

interactions with Asn60. Mutation to alanine could modulate the affinity for pUb.
