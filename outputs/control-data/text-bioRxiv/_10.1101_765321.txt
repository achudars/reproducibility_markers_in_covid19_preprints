Abstract

2

The Critically Endangered Smalltooth Sawfish, Pristis pectinata, was once widespread in the tropical and

3

subtropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean, but following substantial declines over the past century, the core

4

population is currently confined to southwest Florida in the U.S. and the Bahamas. Recent research and verified

5

public encounter reports suggests that this core population may be stabilizing and, potentially, expanding into

6

formerly occupied areas of their historic range in the Western Atlantic; however, the status of this species in non-

7

core waters is not well understood. Environmental DNA (eDNA) methods provide a relatively cost effective and

8

rapid assessment tool for monitoring species occurrence in aquatic habitats. Here, we have developed an eDNA tool:

9

a species-specific Droplet Digital™ PCR (ddPCR™) assay targeting a 100-base pair portion of the mitochondrial

10

NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 gene in P. pectinata, with the ability to reliably detect as little as 0.25 pg of target

11

DNA. The assay was validated by collecting and analyzing a water sample from known P. pectinata nursery habitat

12

in Florida, which was found to contain an average of 11.54 copies of target DNA/µL (SE = 0.72) in the reaction.

13

The assay was then further tested by placing a juvenile sawfish in an ex situ tank and analyzing water samples

14

collected at time intervals. The implementation of this eDNA tool into field surveys will provide additional, reliable

15

data to assess species recovery and aid in prioritizing localities beyond the core range in which to focus research and

16

education initiatives.

Introduction

19

Sawfishes are among the most threatened families of marine fishes worldwide (Dulvy et al. 2014), with all five

20

species listed as Critically Endangered or Endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)

21

Red List of Threatened Species (Dulvy et al. 2016). All sawfishes have undergone global declines in range and

22

abundance due to direct exploitation, bycatch in fisheries, and habitat loss (Dulvy et al. 2016). These threats are

23

exacerbated by their life history traits (e.g., late maturity, low fecundity, and long life spans), which leave sawfishes

24

susceptible to overexploitation, and makes population recovery a slow process (Stevens et al. 2000; Carlson and

25

Simpfendorfer 2015).

26

The Critically Endangered Smalltooth Sawfish, Pristis pectinata, is thought to have experienced the largest

27

global range contraction of all sawfishes and is currently found in less than 20% of its former range (Dulvy et al.

28

2016). Once widespread in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean, remaining core population(s)

29

are thought to be limited to the U.S. and the Bahamas (Carlson et al. 2013), making these populations of global

30

conservation significance (Dulvy et al. 2016). Within U.S. waters, P. pectinata were historically found from Texas

31

to the Carolinas (Brame et al. 2019) but saw substantial losses in both range and abundance over the past century,

32

with the current population restricted to southwest Florida (SWFL) by the 1980’s (Norton et al. 2012).

33

Due to the dramatic declines in range and abundance, P. pectinata was listed as Endangered in 2003 under

34

the U.S. Endangered Species Act of 1973 by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) (NMFS 2003), and a

35

Species Recovery Plan (SRP) was developed to promote recovery and long-term viability of the species in U.S.

36

waters (NMFS 2009; 2018). One characteristic of full species recovery is re-establishment in some or all of the

37

former range (Akçakaya et al. 2018); therefore, the SRP for P. pectinata designated 15 recovery regions throughout

38

their historic range in U.S. waters, wherein recovery efforts should occur if species presence is confirmed (NMFS

39

2009; 2018). As a result of over 15 years of U.S. federal and state protections, scientific advances in the

40

understanding of the biology and ecology of the species, and public education initiatives, the core population of P.

41

pectinata in SWFL is believed to be stabilizing (NMFS 2018). One line of evidence for this potential stabilization is

42

the emergence of relatively recent sawfish encounter reports within formerly occupied parts of their historic range in

43

U.S. waters, including in designated recovery regions (NMFS 2018); however, the status of P. pectinata in these

44

non-core areas is unknown.

45

Traditional survey methods for monitoring the status of rare species can be expensive and time-consuming

46

(Lewison et al. 2004). Environmental DNA (eDNA) methods provide a relatively cost effective and rapid

47

assessment tool for monitoring species occurrence in aquatic habitats (Rees et al. 2014; Evans et al. 2017). Water

48

provides a medium for traces of DNA recently shed by organisms (e.g., cellular debris, skin cells, blood, feces,

49

urine), which can be collected and analyzed via genetic assays (Jerde et al. 2011). EDNA has been shown to be as

50

sensitive, and sometimes more sensitive in rare species detections compared to survey methods such as

51

electrofishing (Evans et al. 2017), Baited Remote Underwater Video systems (BRUVs) and underwater visual

52

censuses (UVCs) (Boussarie et al. 2018), and traditional net surveys (Thomsen et al. 2012). EDNA methods also

53

negate the need to capture and handle the target species, making it an ideal tool to assess the presence or absence of

54

a threatened species (Rees et al. 2014). EDNA has been used in targeted, single species detections for a growing

55

number of threatened elasmobranchs, including the Endangered Maugean Skate, Zearaja maugeana (Weltz et al.

56

2017), the Vulnerable Great White Shark, Carcharodon carcharias (Lafferty et al. 2018), the Vulnerable Chilean

59

Here, we develop and validate an eDNA assay to detect the presence of P. pectinata DNA in water

60

samples, for use as a tool for monitoring their recovery in the Western Atlantic. This tool will allow scientists and

61

managers to better understand the status of P. pectinata in non-core areas and provide quantitative baseline data

62

from which to measure progress towards recovery. Such data can also aid in prioritizing recovery regions in which

to focus research and education initiatives, playing an important role in adaptive management strategies as P.

Pristis pectinata eDNA assay development

67

Field and laboratory controls

68

To reduce the risk of contamination by exogenous DNA or cross-contamination between samples, rigorous controls

69

were used throughout all stages of this research (see Ficetola et al. 2016; Goldberg et al. 2016; Port et al. 2016;

70

Schweiss et al. In press). All water collection bottles and filtering equipment were cleaned prior to each use using a

71

combination of two methods of sterilization; cleaning with 10% bleach followed by either autoclaving at 120°C for

72

20 min or exposure to UV light for 20 min, depending on the materials. To prevent contamination between the

73

stages of sample processing, water filtration, DNA extractions, and PCR amplifications were conducted in

74

physically isolated laboratories. Furthermore, water samples were filtered in laboratories where contemporary P.

75

pectinata tissue had never been present (see Deiner et al. 2015). During water filtration and DNA extraction,

76

designated sterile forceps for each sample were used to handle used filters and gloves were changed between

77

samples to prevent cross-contamination between samples (see Pilliod et al. 2013; Goldberg et al. 2016). During

78

DNA extractions and PCR, aerosol barrier pipette tips were used to prevent cross-contamination between samples

79

(Schweiss et al. In Press). Additionally, no positive samples were included in any PCRs due to the risk of

80

contamination from the positive itself, as per ancient DNA (aDNA) PCR protocols (see Mulligan 2005).

81

To test for the possibility of contamination, negative control samples were incorporated into water sample

82

collection and each stage of laboratory processing and analyzed through to PCRs, which were conducted in

83

replicates of five (Jerde et al. 2011; Bakker et al. 2017). To test for contamination in the field, 3 L of autoclaved DI

84

water were brought onto the boat and stored in three sterile 1 L Nalgene® bottles on ice until filtration. To test for

85

contamination during filtration, 3 L of autoclaved DI water were filtered and processed through to PCR. Negative

86

controls for DNA extractions contained no particulate matter or filters, and PCR negatives contained no DNA

87

template. Analysis of all negative control samples, using the optimized protocols described below, found no

88

evidence of target DNA across all PCR replicates.

89

90

Water collection, filtration, and DNA extraction

91

Three liter (L) water samples were collected for all aspects of this study using three sterile, 1 L high-density

92

polyethylene Nalgene® bottles, which were kept on ice in pre-cleaned marine coolers until filtration, which occurred

93

within 24 hours of collection. All water samples were vacuum-filtered using 47 millimeter (mm) 0.8 micron (µm)

94

nylon filters, and used filters were rolled and preserved in 95% ethanol at room temperature. Total eDNA was

95

extracted from filters using the QIAGEN® DNeasy® Blood & Tissue Kit following the Goldberg et al. (2011)

96

protocol incorporating QIAshredder™ spin columns. The qualities of DNA extracts were visualized using 2%

97

agarose gels and the quantities of DNA were assessed using Thermo Fisher Scientific™ NanoDrop™ technology.

98

99

Droplet Digital PCR assay

100

Primers were designed to amplify a 100-base pair (bp) fragment of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit

101

2 (mtDNA ND2) gene in P. pectinata, but not in other elasmobranchs that could co-occur with this species in U.S.

102

waters, or in other Pristis sawfishes. To design these primers, mtDNA ND2 sequences for P. pectinata (GenBank

103

accession no. KP400584.1) and 17 genetically similar exclusion species were downloaded from GenBank (Online

104

Resource 1) and aligned in CodonCode v. 6.0.2 (CodonCode Corporation, Dedham, MA, USA). Forward

105

(PpecND21F: 5’-CTGGTTCACATTGACTCTTAATTTG-3’) and reverse (PpecND21R: 5’-

106

GCTACAGCTTCAGCTCTCCTTC-3’) primers and an internal PrimeTime® double-quenched ZEN™/IOWA

107

Black™ FQ probe labeled with 6-FAM (PpecND2Probe1IBQF: 5’-TACCATAGCCATCATCCCATTATTATTC-

108

3’) were designed to amplify DNA in only P. pectinata by including bp differences in the primers and the probe in

109

all exclusion species (see Online Resource 1). To confirm that the combination of the primers and probe amplified

110

the desired locus, PCRs were conducted using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and total genomic DNA

111

(gDNA) from four P. pectinata individuals. Reaction mixtures contained 1.1 µL of extracted DNA (~25 ng/µL), 1X

113

22 µL using PCR-grade water. Cycling conditions consisted of enzyme activation at 95°C for 10 min, followed by

114

40 cycles of: 94°C for 30 s and 64°C for 2 min, followed by enzyme deactivation at 98°C for 10 min, using a ramp

115

rate of 1°C/s. The resulting amplicon from one P. pectinata individual was cleaned using a QIAGEN® QIAquick

116

PCR Purification Kit using the manufacturer’s protocol, with the exception that all centrifugation steps were

117

conducted at 12,000 rpm for 2 min. Forward and reverse sequences were generated using a BigDye™ Terminator

118

v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems™, Foster City, CA, USA) on an Applied Biosystems™ 3730XL

119

DNA Analyzer. A consensus sequence was assembled in CodonCode v. 6.0.2 (CodonCode Corporation, Dedham,

120

MA, USA) and its identity was verified as P. pectinata using the NCBI BLAST search function; the generated

121

sequence was 99.3% similar to P. pectinata GenBank accession no. KP400584.1 (Chen et al. 2016).

122

The PCR reaction and cycling conditions were optimized for the Bio-Rad® QX200™ AutoDG™ Droplet

123

Digital™ PCR System (Instrument no. 773BR1456) by systematically adjusting seven variables (i.e., primer and

124

probe concentrations, cycle number, ramp rate, annealing temperature, denaturation time, and elongation time) to

125

produce positive results with high relative florescence units (RFUs) and little to no “droplet rain” (i.e., droplets, or

126

clusters of droplets, that lie between the positive and negative droplet bands on the ddPCR™ scatter plot) (see

127

Online Resource 2). Optimized ddPCR™ reaction mixtures contained 1.1 µL of extracted DNA, 1X Bio-Rad®

128

ddPCR™ supermix for probes (no deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP)), 900 nanomolar (nM) of each primer, and 170

129

nM of probe, adjusted to 22 µL using PCR-grade water. Optimal ddPCR™ cycling conditions were enzyme

130

activation at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of: 94°C for 30 s and 64°C for 2 min, with a final enzyme

131

deactivation step at 98°C for 10 min, using a ramp rate of 1°C/s. To ensure the assay was species-specific for P.

132

pectinata in U.S. waters, the optimized ddPCR™ reaction and cycling conditions were tested using 0.20 ng/µL

133

gDNA derived from fin clips from four P. pectinata individuals and one individual for each of 12 representative

134

exclusion species (Table 1). The target DNA fragment was amplified in all five ddPCR™ replicates for each P.

135

pectinata individual but was not amplified in any of the ddPCR™ replicates for any representative species from five

136

genetically similar ray genera and two shark genera that could co-occur with P. pectinata, or in other Pristis

137

sawfishes.

141

Data analysis

142

Data were analyzed using three criteria for positive P. pectinata detections: 1) droplets fell above a manual threshold

143

(MT) defined for this assay, 2) droplets above the MT fell within the prescribed range of the positive droplet

144

population for this assay (5000–7000 RFUs; Fig. 1), and 3) the concentration of target DNA, determined using Bio-

145

Rad® QuantaSoft™ software using the Rare Event Detection (RED) setting, was at or above the Limit of Detection

146

(LoD) of the assay. Defining an assay-specific MT minimizes the likelihood of incorrectly calling artifact droplets

147

(i.e., droplets that fall above the negative band population in the absence of target DNA; see Online Resource 3) as

148

positive detections (e.g., Hunter et al. 2017). To define an appropriate MT for the P. pectinata eDNA assay, a No

149

Template Control (NTC) plate with no target DNA was analyzed on the ddPCR™ platform, using the described

150

reaction and cycling conditions. The highest amplitude of the artifact droplets was 2,700 RFUs; therefore, 3000

151

RFUs was chosen to adopt a more conservative approach to minimize the risk of a calling a false positive.

152

To determine the LoD of the assay, ddPCR™ reactions were performed using gDNA from three P.

153

pectinata individuals with a 6-fold series of 10X dilutions from starting concentrations of 20 ng/μL (i.e., 1:10 to

154

1:1,000,000). Target DNA was reliably detected in all replicates for all individuals up to the 1:10,000 dilutions, but

155

not in the 1:100,000 dilutions. The standard error of the 1:1,000,000 also overlapped with zero (Fig. 2a), making

156

detection at this concentration unreliable. To further refine the LoD, ddPCR™ reactions were performed on

157

subsequent 3-fold series of 2X dilutions from the 1:10,000 dilutions (Fig. 2b). The LoD of this assay was found to

158

be the 1:80,000 dilutions, corresponding to 0.25 pg of target DNA in the reaction (Fig. 2c). The standard errors of

159

the 1:80,000 dilutions did not include zero, or overlap with the 1:100,000 dilutions; so using the average number of

160

copies of target DNA/μL in the 1:80,000 dilutions and applying the lower standard error as the relaxed detection

161

threshold (see Baker et al. 2018), the LoD of the assay was determined to be 0.08 copies/μL.

162

163

Validation of the Pristis pectinata eDNA assay

164

To validate the ddPCR™ assay, positive P. pectinata eDNA samples were acquired via analysis of a water sample

165

from known habitat and through a tank experiment. To collect these positive water samples, a pre-cleaned ~160 L

166

tank was filled with ambient surface water from known P. pectinata nursery habitat in the Caloosahatchee River,

167

Florida, approximately 330 m outside of the Harbour Isles Marina. A 3 L water sample was immediately collected

168

from the tank to assess whether P. pectinata eDNA was present in the Caloosahatchee River water. One juvenile

169

female P. pectinata, measuring 786 mm stretched total length, was captured in a gill net inside the Harbour Isles

170

Marina and placed into the tank. An aerator was added to the tank and dissolved oxygen and water temperature were

171

monitored for the duration of the experiment. A 3 L water sample was collected from the tank immediately after the

172

juvenile was added (time zero) and again after 30 min. All water samples were filtered, DNA extracted, run on

173

ddPCR™, and analyzed using the methods developed in this study.

174

Applying all three criteria for a positive detection of target DNA, the ddPCR reactions containing DNA

175

extracted from ambient water from the nursery contained an average of 11.54 copies/µL (SE = 0.72) of P. pectinata

176

eDNA (Fig. 3). The amount of target eDNA increased to 739.4 copies/µL (SE = 38.31) immediately after the

177

juvenile was added to the tank (time zero) and then increased to 3,175.8 copies/µL (SE = 589.3) after 30 min (Fig.

178

3). At 30 min, the large quantity of target DNA isolated from the water sample oversaturated the PCR product,

179

resulting in a high standard error.

180

181

Discussion

182

The developed eDNA assay provides a rapid-assessment tool to conduct targeted surveys to investigate the

183

occurrence and infer the status of P. pectinata beyond their contemporary core range. This assay has been validated

184

in the Caloosahatchee River, Florida, where P. pectinata is the sole species of sawfish; however, because the assay

185

did not amplify DNA in other Pristis sawfishes, it can also be used in locations where other sawfishes have been

186

known to co-occur, at least historically, such as Texas (Brame et al. 2019). It is promising to note that there are no

187

bp differences in the primer or probe sequences designed in this study compared to a mtDNA ND2 sequence for a P.

188

pectinata collected in Mexico (GenBank accession no. MF682494.1; Diaz-Jaimes et al. 2018), indicating the

189

developed assay should amplify the target gene in this species from other, nearby waters in the Western Atlantic.

190

Use of the assay outside these waters requires careful consideration and, potentially, further testing. MtDNA genes

191

are often variable among populations within a species (Rubinoff et al. 2006); therefore, before using this assay to

192

conduct eDNA surveys in other geographic regions (e.g., Eastern Atlantic), the primers and probe should be tested

193

with P. pectinata tissue samples obtained from the local population. Where fresh P. pectinata tissue samples are not

194

available for such testing due to the possibility of local extinctions, historic rostra can be used as an alternative

195

source of DNA (Phillips et al. 2009). Finally, the primers and probe developed here were cross-tested with

196

representative species from closely related genera found in U.S. waters; testing with additional exclusion species is

197

required to ensure that the assay remains species-specific in other geographic regions, highlighting the need for local

198

fisheries knowledge (Poulakis and Grubbs 2019).

199

The use of ddPCR™ for single species detections is gaining popularity in eDNA research due to its unparalleled

200

ability to detect minute quantities of target DNA amongst high concentrations of non-target DNA and in the

201

presence of natural inhibitors found in water samples (Evans et al. 2017; Hunter et al. 2018). DdPCR™ assays

202

developed for species such as the Bull Shark, Carcharhinus leucas (Schweiss et al. In Press) and Killer Whale,

203

Orcinus orca (Baker et al. 2018), have found this platform to be capable of detecting less than 0.5 pg of target DNA

204

in a reaction. Such highly sensitive assays are especially critical in eDNA surveys targeting Critically Endangered or

205

Endangered species, where there can be substantial conservation outcomes based on the results of such surveys

206

(Hunter et al. 2018; Poulakis and Grubbs 2019). For instance, the use of ddPCR™ could reduce the risk of false

207

negatives (i.e., where target DNA is present but not detected) stemming from the use of a less sensitive PCR

208

platform such as conventional or qRT-PCR, which are unlikely to detect such minute quantities of target DNA (Doi

209

et al. 2015). Conservation and management strategies developed on the basis of such false negatives could lead to

210

slower implementation and inadequate protections along with incomplete habitat designations for threatened species,

211

ultimately hindering species recovery.

212

Using the three-criteria approach described here to define positive detections on the ddPCR™ platform

213

provides a rigorous approach to interpret the results of eDNA surveys, reducing the risk of incorrectly calling PCR

214

artifacts as positive species detections (e.g., false positives). For example, using only a MT, an artifact droplet just

215

above the threshold could be incorrectly interpreted as a positive detection. Ensuring the quantity of target DNA is

216

also within the detection capabilities of an assay allows for more robust and confident positive detections. False

217

positives can also result from contamination between eDNA samples or from exogenous DNA. Given the detection

218

capabilities of ddPCR™ assays, strict protocols to prevent contamination (see Goldberg et al. 2016; Schweiss et al.

219

In press) coupled with testing for contamination at every stage in sample processing are critical in producing reliable

220

data from eDNA surveys that may be used as a part of conservation planning. This is especially important when the

221

results of eDNA surveys could be used to prioritize research and management initiatives as well as in the allocation

222

of resources (Poulakis and Grubbs 2019).

223

224

With a well-designed water sampling regime, strict field and laboratory controls, and a highly sensitive

occurrence of P. pectinata. The eDNA tool developed here can be used to provide quantitative baseline data in non-

226

core areas from which to measure future progress towards species recovery. Recovery in P. pectinata populations is

227

predicted to be a slow process due to their life history characteristics and will be dependent on the mitigation of

228

anthropogenic activities (e.g., accidental fisheries mortalities; Carlson and Simpfendorfer 2015). Range re-expansion

229

during recovery is predicted to begin in locations closest to the core population(s) as a result of spillover from

230

adjacent areas, in a stepping-stone fashion (see Saura et al. 2014). There is, however, the possibility that because

231

female P. pectinata have been shown to exhibit philopatry (Feldheim et al. 2017), occurrence and encounter reports

232

of juvenile P. pectinata in non-core areas further away from SWFL (e.g. Texas, Mississippi) represent remnant P.

233

pectinata populations scattered over portions of their former range; under such a scenario, patterns of recovery could

234

be more complex and would ultimately depend on the availability of suitable habitat and the mitigation of threats

235

from anthropogenic activities (Seitz and Poulakis 2006; Poulakis et al. 2011; Norton et al. 2012; Scharer et al.

236

2017). Conducting targeted eDNA surveys for P. pectinata across all historically-occupied regions in U.S. waters

237

could not only aid in conservation planning and prioritizing areas for research, but could also increase our

238

understanding of patterns of recovery in a highly threatened marine species.
