Abstract
The proton-gated acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) is implicated in the injury response
to cerebral ischemia but little is known about its role in cardiac ischemia. We provide genetic
evidence that ASIC1a is involved in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and show
that pharmacological inhibition of ASIC1a yields robust cardioprotection in rodent and
human models of cardiac ischemia, resulting in improved post-IRI cardiac viability and
function. Consistent with a key role for ASIC1a in cardiac ischemia, we show that
polymorphisms in the ASIC1 genetic locus are strongly associated with myocardial
infarction. Collectively, our data provide compelling evidence that ASIC1a is a key target for
cardioprotective drugs to reduce the burden of disease associated with myocardial ischemia.

Introduction
Conditions caused by obstruction of blood flow to the heart, such as myocardial infarction
(MI), are the most common emergency manifestation of cardiovascular disease1. Although
acute reperfusion therapies have improved patient outcomes, mortality remains high2 and
MI is one of the largest attributable risks for heart failure (HF)3. Globally, 1 in 5 people
develop HF, with annual healthcare costs of $108B4,5. Heart transplantation remains the
most effective treatment option for HF6,7, but 75% of potential donor hearts are discarded,
many due to sensitivity of the donor heart to ischemic injury8. Myocardial sensitivity to
ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) therefore remains a primary point of vulnerability underlying
cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide9.
Despite decades of preclinical therapeutic development, there are currently no drugs that
block the acute injury response to cardiac ischemia10.
Myocardial IRI is a complex pathophysiological process that underlies the cardiac injury
sustained during cardiac surgery, heart transplant, MI, and cardiac arrest. During myocardial
ischemia, reduced oxygen availability causes a shift from fatty acid metabolism to anaerobic
glycolysis11,12. The resulting lactic acidosis causes the extracellular pH to fall to as low as
6.0– 6.513,14. In patients suffering from acute MI, the severity of acidosis strongly correlates
with patient mortality, with pH < 7.35 associated with > 60% mortality15. Ongoing acidosis
results in the activation of several transmembrane ion channels and receptors, including the
sodium-hydrogen exchanger (NHE), glutamate-gated NMDA receptors, and TRP family of
ion channels, each of which are thought to contribute to calcium overload, metabolic
dysfunction, and eventually cell death16-18. In line with this, the Expedition Trial showed
significant protection against peri-operative MI with the NHE inhibitor, cariporide, in patients
undergoing high-risk coronary artery bypass surgery19. While this trial failed due to
cerebrovascular complications, it demonstrated that pharmacological conditioning has the
capacity to reduce the injury response to myocardial IRI.
Acid sensing ion channels (ASICs) are voltage-independent proton-gated cation channels
of the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel superfamily20. There are six ASIC isoforms
derived from four genes (ACCN1–4), which assemble into homotrimeric or heterotrimeric
channels. The pH sensitivity and kinetics of ASICs are determined by their subunit
composition21,22. ASICs are involved in extracellular acidification-induced calcium overload
in neurons and cardiomyocytes23-25. ASIC1a, a splice variant of the ACCN1 gene, is the
most pH-sensitive ASIC channel. Activation begins at pH ≤ 7, with half-maximal activation
at pH 6.626,27, and ASIC1a currents are potentiated by numerous metabolic events that

occur during ischemia including membrane stretch and increased levels of extracellular
lactate, pyruvate, and arachidonic acid28,29. ASIC1a plays a critical role in mediating
neuronal death after cerebral ischemia, and inhibition of ASIC1a through genetic ablation
or pharmacological blockade is neuroprotective in rodent models of ischemic stroke30-32.
In this study, we used genetic and pharmacological approaches to demonstrate, for the first
time, that ASIC1a is a critical mediator of the injury response to myocardial IRI. We show
that venom-derived inhibitors of ASIC1a provide robust cardioprotection across multiple
species and model systems from the cellular to whole-organ level, including models of IRI
and donor heart preservation. Taken together, our data provide compelling evidence that
ASIC1a is an important target for cardioprotective drugs, with potential application in the
treatment of MI, cardiac arrest, and the preservation of donor hearts.
Results
Genetic ablation of ASIC1a improves functional recovery following cardiac IRI. We
assessed ASIC isoform expression in the adult mouse heart from transcriptomic data of
sorted cardiac cell populations after sham and myocardial infarction (MI)33. In sham hearts,
ASIC1 expression was highest in cardiomyocytes, while endothelial cells and fibroblasts
expressed both ASIC1 and ASIC3. In all three cell types, ASIC4 and ASIC2 had low and
undetectable expression, respectively (Fig. 1a). ASIC1 was not differentially expressed
between

sham

and post-MI conditions

in cardiomyocytes or

endothelial cells

(Supplementary Fig. 1a). ASIC1 encodes two isoforms from the same genetic locus,
ASIC1a and ASIC1b, that are genetically conserved among bilateria. As opposed to
ASIC1b, which is primarily involved in nociception34, we focused on ASIC1a due to its known
role in mediating injury responses resulting from ischemia in the brain22. We subsequently
tested whether ASIC1a governs the response to cardiac ischemic injury.
To determine whether ASIC1a plays a functional role during cardiac ischemia, we assessed
IRI tolerance of Langendorff-perfused isolated hearts from ASIC1a-specific knockout (KO)
mice. To generate the ASIC1a KO mouse strain, we used CRISPR editing to target the
ACCN1 locus. Specificity of the knockout was confirmed using qRT-PCR that showed only
ASIC1a but not ASIC1b mRNA was reduced in brain tissue from knockout mice
(Supplementary Fig. 2). Baseline function and heart rate in ASIC1a KO (ASIC1a-/-) isolated
hearts were comparable to those measured in wildtype (WT) control hearts (ASIC1a+/+)
(Table 1). To assess tolerance to IRI, hearts were subjected to 25 min of global
normothermic zero-flow ischemia, followed by 45 min of aerobic reperfusion. WT and

ASIC1a KO hearts showed similar initial responses to ischemia with comparable levels of
ventricular contracture (Supplementary Fig. 1b). During reperfusion, both groups
demonstrated gradual recovery of contractile function over time, with markedly improved
functional recovery in ASIC1a KO hearts (Fig. 1b). By the end of the reperfusion period,
ASIC1a KO hearts had significantly improved systolic and diastolic function with higher left
ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) (44 ± 5% of baseline) and lower end diastolic
pressure (EDP) (38 ± 3 mmHg) compared to WT hearts (LVDP: 23 ± 7% of baseline; EDP:
50 ± 3 mmHg); Fig. 1c,d). ASIC1a KO hearts also had improved recovery of coronary flow
(CF) rates by the end of reperfusion (KO: 97 ± 6%; WT: 78 ± 3%, percent baseline) (Fig. 1e
and Supplementary Fig. 1c,d). To assess cell death, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) efflux
was measured in perfusate samples collected during reperfusion. LDH efflux from ASIC1a
KO hearts was significantly lower compared to WT hearts after 2 min of reperfusion (Fig. 1f),
with a similar trend at the end of reperfusion (Supplementary Fig. 1d). Our data indicate
that ASIC1a does not play a role in maintaining functional homeostasis, but it is a critical
mediator of the organ response to myocardial IRI.

ASIC1a inhibitors protect mouse hearts against IRI. We sought to determine whether
pharmacological inhibition of ASIC1a is cardioprotective during an acute cardiac ischemic
insult. Despite significant investment and preclinical testing, drug development pipelines
have failed to identify effective small molecule inhibitors of ASIC1a due to lack of specificity,
potency, or functional efficacy35-37. We therefore took advantage of two venom-derived
inhibitors of ASIC1a, including Hi1a, a 76-residue double-knot peptide that we discovered
from the venom of an Australian funnel-web spider (Fig. 2a). Hi1a is the most potent and
selective inhibitor of ASIC1a identified to date, with an IC50 of 500 pM32. PcTx1, a single5

knot peptide from the venom of a tarantula, is also a potent and selective inhibitor of ASIC1a
(IC50 ~1 nM)30. Although the two peptides are closely related (Hi1a is comprised of two
PcTx1-like domains joined by a short linker; Fig. 2b,c), they have distinct inhibitory modes
of action. Hi1a inhibits ASIC1a activation whereas PcTx1 promotes and stabilizes a
desensitized state of the channel32. We also utilized an analogue of PcTx1 that contains
mutations of two pharmacophore residues (R27A/V32A), which dramatically reduces its
inhibitory effect on ASIC1a30.
To examine if these ASIC1a inhibitors are cardioprotective, we assessed tolerance to IRI in
Langendorff-perfused isolated mouse hearts with and without peptide treatment. Consistent
with genetic ablation of ASIC1a, Hi1a, PcTx1, and PcTx1-R27A/V32A had no effect on
baseline contractile function during the first 10 min of peptide infusion prior to ischemia
(Fig. 2d). Functional tolerance to IRI was greater in hearts exposed to Hi1a or PcTx1
(10 nM) compared to control hearts (Fig. 2e). At the end of reperfusion, Hi1a- and PcTx1treated hearts, but not hearts treated with the PcTx1-R27A/V32A analogue, had markedly
improved recovery of LVDP (Hi1a: 60 ± 4%, PcTx1: 49 ± 12%, PcTx1-R27A/V32A: 36 ± 6%)
compared to vehicle controls (20 ± 4%) (Fig. 2f). Similarly, treatment with Hi1a and PcTx1,
but not PcTx1-R27A/V32A, led to reduced EDP after 45 min reperfusion (Hi1a: 35 ± 4
mmHg; PcTx1: 33 ± 8 mmHg; PcTx1-R27A/V32A: 48 ± 3 mmHg) compared to vehicle
controls (57 ± 2 mmHg) (Fig. 2g). No differences in final CF were observed between groups
(Fig 2h), although hearts treated with PcTx1, but not Hi1a, displayed significant reactive
hyperaemia during early reperfusion, as evidenced by increased CF during the first 5 min of
reperfusion (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b). Taken together, our data show that ASIC1a
inhibitors protect the heart from myocardial IRI and recapitulate the functional benefits of
genetic ablation of the channel.
Preconditioning with Hi1a improves functional recovery of isolated rodent hearts
after prolonged hypothermic ischemia. In order to evaluate the cardioprotective effect of
ASIC1a inhibition in a model of donor heart preservation, we supplemented standard clinical
heart preservation solution (Celsior38) with Hi1a during 8 h cold storage of isolated rat hearts.
The hearts were stabilised for 10 min by retrograde (Langendorff) perfusion and then
switched to working-mode in order to assess cardiac function in the presence of
physiological afterload. Following assessment of baseline hemodynamic parameters, hearts
were arrested by infusion of cold (2–3°C) Celsior solution with and without 10 nM Hi1a into
the coronary circulation. After cardioplegic arrest, hearts were stored under hypothermic
conditions for 8 h, followed by reperfusion and functional analysis (Fig. 3a). Hearts

preserved with Hi1a supplementation had markedly improved recovery of aortic flow (AF)
(50 ± 11%) and cardiac output (CO) (57 ± 8%) compared to Celsior-only controls (AF: 8 ±
5%; CO: 24 ± 5%) (Fig. 3b,c). These data demonstrate that Hi1a is highly cardioprotective
against IRI in a model of donor heart preservation with prolonged cold storage.
Hi1a supplementation improves recovery in a postconditioning model of donation
after circulatory death. To determine whether pharmacological inhibition of ASIC1a could
recover hearts when delivered subsequent to a profound ischemic injury, we assessed the
effect of Hi1a in a rodent model of donation after circulatory death (DCD). Historically, DCD
hearts were considered unusable for transplantation due to the severe ischemic injury
sustained during organ procurement39, but recent studies have shown that successful
transplantation of DCD hearts is possible with effective post-conditioning strategies, namely
normothermic ex vivo perfusion and pharmacological post-conditioning40-42. To mimic a
clinical DCD withdrawal in rodents, asphyxiation was induced via tracheal ligation, then the
hearts were retrieved after a 10-min warm ischemic time (WIT) followed by 2-min stand-off
period (after cessation of circulation). The hearts were then flushed with Celsior with or
without supplementation, followed by ex vivo reperfusion in Langendorff mode for 30 min
and then working mode for an additional 30 min (Fig. 4a).
Hi1a (10 nM) was tested as a single supplement and in combination with two clinically used
supplements, glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) and erythropoietin (EPO)42. As a positive control, we
also evaluated zoniporide (Zon) combined with GTN and EPO, which we have previously
shown activates ischemic postconditioning pathways41. To assess the viability of hearts
post-DCD withdrawal, functional parameters and cell death (LDH release) were measured
throughout working-mode reperfusion. In Celsior-only controls, coronary effluent levels of
LDH increased throughout the 30 min assessment period. Allografts supplemented with
Hi1a, Hi1a + GTN/EPO, or GTN/EPO/Zon, however, had significantly reduced levels of LDH
after 30 min, with LDH release in both triple-supplemented groups comparable to a heart at
baseline, prior to ischemic insult (Fig. 4b). Functional parameters of recovery including AF,
CO, and pulse pressure (PP) were all significantly improved in supplemented groups
compared to Celsior alone (Fig. 4c-e). AF, in particular, was significantly increased in hearts
supplemented with Hi1a combined with GTN and EPO (32 ± 2 mL/min) compared to Hi1a
as a single supplement (18 ± 3 mL/min), suggesting an additive effect of Hi1a with current
clinically used cardioprotective agents (Fig. 4c).
To investigate the therapeutic benefit of Hi1a in the context of preventing cell death in DCD
hearts, we performed western blots to examine the levels of phosphorylated RIP3 (pRIP3)

in tissue lysates collected at the end of working-mode reperfusion. RIP3 is one of the key
regulators of the necroptosis pathway that has been implicated in the response to IRI43,44,
and specifically to ASIC1a-mediated cell death during cerebral ischemia45. Treatment with
Hi1a as a single or triple supplement led to reduced levels of pRIP3 following DCD
withdrawal and reperfusion (Fig. 4f), suggesting that Hi1a blockade of ASIC1a might inhibit
necroptosis. Together with our finding that Hi1a improved donor organ viability after
prolonged cold storage, the therapeutic efficacy of Hi1a in the DCD model demonstrates
significant translational potential for ASIC1a-targeted therapies during clinical donor heart
preservation.
ASIC1a is expressed in the human heart and polymorphisms in its genetic locus are
associated with ischemic disease. Analysis of ASIC expression patterns from mRNA-seq
and ribo-seq data collected from human left ventricular cardiac tissue46 revealed the highest
expression of ASIC1 and ASIC3 in the human left ventricle and similar levels of ASIC1
expression in samples from HF and non-HF patients (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b).
We next assessed whether natural variation in the genetic locus encoding ASIC1a (ACCN1)
is associated with ischemic diseases using human population statistical genetics. While
fewer than 10% of new molecular entities pass through clinical trials and are approved for
therapeutic use, evidence of human genetic association between the gene target and traits
sufficiently similar to the indication being treated increase the likelihood of approval to as
high as 50%47. We utilized summary data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS)48
and calculated the statistical significance (using fastBAT49) of genetic variants
encompassing the ACCN1 locus with human cardiac and cerebral ischemic phenotypes.
These data revealed a significant association between genetic variation in ACCN1 and
major coronary heart disease and MI (P < 0.05) (Table 2). We also found that genetic
variation in ACCN1 associates with small-vessel ischemic stroke (p = 3.94 x 10-3), but not
other stroke subtypes (Table 2). Taken together, these data provide evidence that ACCN1
polymorphisms within the human population are associated with ischemic diseases of the
heart and brain.

ASIC1a inhibition prevents cell death in in vitro human models of IRI. To examine
whether pharmacological blockade of ASIC1a might provide therapeutic benefit in the
context of human tissue, we used human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived
cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). Contractile cardiomyocytes were generated from stem cells
using a standard monolayer-based differentiation protocol involving bi-phasic Wnt regulation
(Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 5a). Analysis of mRNA transcripts from single-cell RNA
sequencing data over a time course of cardiac differentiation from pluripotency51 revealed
that ASIC1, ASIC3, and ASIC4 expression increased starting in day-5 cardiac progenitor
populations and peaked in day-15 definitive cardiomyocytes. ASIC1 was the most highly
expressed ASIC subtype, with expression levels comparable to other cardiac ion channels
such as TRPV1 and NaV1.5 (Fig. 5b,c).
Since ASIC1a mediates influx of calcium in addition to sodium34, we performed calcium
imaging after acute addition of the ASIC1a inhibitors Hi1a and PcTx1 to assess whether
ASIC1a inhibition alters physiological electromechanical coupling in cardiomyocytes.
Replated hiPSC-CMs were loaded with a fluorescent calcium dye and calcium transients
were recorded before and after peptide addition. Neither Hi1a nor PcTx1 altered calcium
amplitudes or spontaneous beating rate at any evaluated concentration (Fig. 5d).
To assess whether ASIC1a inhibition is cardioprotective in hiPSC-CMs, we evaluated cell
death in response to in vitro acidosis, induced by culturing hiPSC-CMs in Hank’s buffered
sodium salt (HBSS) with pH adjusted to pH 7.4, 6.0, or 5.0. ASIC1 mRNA expression was
not significantly altered by low pH treatment, but significant cell death (> 40%), as assessed
by LDH secretion, was observed in populations treated overnight at pH 5.0, with minimal

cell death occurring at pH 7.4 or pH 6.0 (Supplementary Fig. 5b,c). Treatment with either
Hi1a or PcTx1 resulted in nearly complete cardioprotection, even at concentrations as low
as 1 nM (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Fig. 5d,e). To further confirm that ASIC1a plays a
direct role in mediating cell death, we treated hiPSC-CMs overnight with 20 nM MitTx, a
potent agonist of ASIC1a isolated from snake venom52. Consistent with ASIC1a mediating
the injury response to cardiac ischemia, treatment of hiPSC-CMs with MitTx resulted in
increased cell death at both pH 7.4 and pH 6.0 (Fig. 5f). We next evaluated the
cardioprotective effect of Hi1a and PcTx1 in an in vitro model of ischemia/acidosis with
reperfusion. To mimic ischemia/acidosis in vitro, hiPSC-CMs were incubated overnight in
combined hypoxic (0.5% O2) and acidic (pH 5.0) conditions with or without peptide. After
18 h of incubation, the low-pH medium was replaced with medium at physiological pH 7.4
with or without peptide, and the cells were incubated for an additional hour under normoxic
conditions. Significant cell death was observed in control hiPSC-CMs, but this was blocked
by either 10 nM Hi1a or PcTx1 (Fig. 5g,h). These data suggest that ASIC1a mediates cell
death responses in human cardiomyocytes and that pharmacological inhibition of ASIC1a
confers significant protection against ischemia-induced cell stress.
Discussion
Despite decades of research and promising preclinical data, no pharmacological strategies
have led to robust improvement in clinical outcomes for ischemic injuries of the heart10. In
this study, we showed for the first time that ASIC1a exacerbates cardiomyocyte injury
response to ischemia. Our findings are consistent with prior research demonstrating the
importance of ASIC1a during ischemic stroke30-32, and they extend the potential therapeutic
applications of ASIC1a-targeted therapies to myocardial IRI.
Although ASICs, and in particular ASIC1a, are generally associated with the central and
peripheral nervous systems53, our expression analyses revealed that ASIC1 is present in
both rodent and human cardiomyocytes, and is not differentially regulated at the
transcriptional level as a result of cellular ischemia in vitro or in vivo33. Our evidence of
ASIC1a expression in the heart is supported by recent studies that identified ASIC-like
currents in hiPSC-CMs54 and rat cardiomyocytes23. In neurons, there are several possible
mechanisms by which ASIC1a activation leads to cell death including calcium overload55,
regulation of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pores56, and the initiation of
necroptosis through direct interaction with, and activation of, RIPK145. ASIC1a-induced cell
death has not previously been described in cardiomyocytes, but there is evidence that
ASIC1a, along with TRPV1, mediates calcium influx in response to extracellular acidosis23.

Importantly, given the potential for ASIC1a to transport calcium, we showed that genetic
ablation or pharmacological inhibition of ASIC1a does not alter normal electromechanical
coupling in the heart in vitro or in vivo.
Given that drug targets with genetic evidence of disease association are twice as likely to
succeed in clinical trials and lead to approved drug candidates47, our GWAS analysis of the
association between genetic variation in the ACCN1 locus and ischemic disease points
towards the translational potential of ASIC1a-targeted therapies. Such therapies have the
potential to impact a broad scope of clinical applications since myocardial IRI is evident in
many cardiovascular complications such as acute MI, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA),
cardiopulmonary bypass, and heart preservation for transplantation7. Despite intensive
research into therapies aimed at mitigating myocardial IRI in the context of acute MI, none
have translated into clinical practice. Drugs that prevent calcium overload by targeting NHE
showed translational promise in preclinical studies57, but they ultimately failed in Phase III
clinical trials (The EXPEDITION Trial) due to cerebrovascular complications19. Nonetheless,
this trial provided strong clinical evidence that myocardial IRI is a threat during coronary
artery bypass graft surgery and that NHE inhibitors can reduce post- operative MI19.
In general, there is a strong association and co-morbidity between stroke and cardiac arrest,
with 88% of patients suffering some form of cardiovascular complication within 4 weeks of
an ischemic stroke58. Likewise, cardiac interventions such as transcatheter aortic valve
implantation (TAVI) can cause cerebrovascular complications59. We previously used a rat
model of ischemic stroke to show that a single dose of Hi1a (2 ng/kg i.c.v) massively reduced
infarct size and improved neurological and motor performance even when administered up
to 8 h after stroke onset32. No other drugs have been shown to provide significant protection
beyond 4 h after stroke onset60. Thus, ASIC1a inhibitors might provide a potential major
advantage for clinical use due to their ability to protect both the heart and the brain from IRI,
which is particularly relevant for OHCA, for which there is both cardiac and cerebral
manifestations.
ASIC1a-targeted therapies appear to have significant potential in heart transplantation
applications. The predominant source of donor hearts is brain dead (BD) donors, but the
recent introduction of DCD hearts has increased the donor pool42. The viability of usable BD
and DCD hearts, however, continues to be adversely affected by unavoidable injury to the
heart that occurs during organ procurement and storage, as well as reperfusion injury in the
recipient. Indeed, the relative risk of one-year morbidity is strongly correlated with organ
ischemic time7,61. In general, primary graft dysfunction is a major risk for patients in the first

30 days after transplantation and accounts for 66% of patient deaths, of which 48% are due
to IRI62. Thus, there is an unmet need for effective, early interventions that reduce injury to
the graft and reduce the risk of primary graft dysfunction in the recipient. Our direct
comparison between Hi1a and supplements in current clinical use provide strong evidence
for the clinical utility of Hi1a for increasing the pool of viable donor hearts for transplantation.
Venom-derived molecules have proven to be a source of novel therapeutics, particularly in
the cardiovascular field. Examples include the antihypertensive drug captopril63 derived from
the venom of a Brazilian viper, and eptifibatide and tirofiban, antiplatelet drugs that are used
to treat acute coronary syndromes64. Disulfide-rich knottin peptides such as Hi1a are
typically highly stable in biological fluids, and ziconitide, a knottin peptide derived from cone
snail venom, is an FDA-approved analgesic64. For this reason, Hi1a is ideally suited for
clinical use as an adjuvant to standard-of-care heart preservation solutions for heart
transplant or in combination with mechanical procedures such as percutaneous coronary
intervention for myocardial infarction.
In summary, we have shown that ASIC1a is a critical mediator of cell death during cardiac
ischemia and that pharmacological inhibition of ASIC1a affords potent cardioprotection
across rodent and human models of cardiac IRI. These findings suggest that ASIC1a
inhibitors have the potential to significantly impact the public health burden of cardiovascular
disease, and result in improved outcomes for patients with cardiac ischemic injuries.

Online Methods
Animals. All animals used in this study received humane care in compliance with National
Health and Medical Research Council (Australia) guidelines and the Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD). All experiments
were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of
The University of Queensland (IMB/171/18) and Garvan Institute of Medical Research
(16/38). To test the therapeutic efficacy of ASIC1a inhibitors, male C57BL/6 mice
(Langendorff IRI experiments) or male Wistar rats (donor organ preservation experiments)
were purchased from the Animal Resource Centre (Canning Vale, Western Australia).
For genetic ablation studies, ASIC1a-/- mice were generated at the Australian Phenomics
Facility. CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to specifically target the mouse ASIC1a
sequence. Use of guide RNAs (gRNA) with following sequences CCGAGGAGGAGGAGG

protocols. Relative ASIC1a and ASIC1b gene expression values were obtained from
ASIC1a-/- mice and WT (ASIC1a+/+) mice (calibrator) by normalization to the reference gene
RPL32 using the 2-ΔΔCt method, where 2-ΔΔCt = ΔCt sample – ΔCt calibrator.
IRI in Langendorff-perfused mouse hearts. Isolated hearts were assessed for tolerance
to IRI as previously described67,68. Mice (12–14 weeks) were anesthetized via an
intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg/mL ketamine and 1.6 mg/mL xylazil. The heart was excised
via thoracotomy and the aorta cannulated. The hearts were retrogradely perfused under
constant hydrostatic pressure (80 mmHg) with oxygenated (95% O2; 5% CO2) modified
Krebs-Henseleit buffer (composition in mM: 119 NaCl, 22 NaHCO3, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 1.2
KH2PO4, 0.5 EDTA, 1.85 CaCl2, 11 D-(+)-glucose, 2 Na+ pyruvate, all from Sigma-Aldrich).
Temperature was continuously measured with thermocouple needle microprobes (SDR
Scientific) and maintained at 37°C with circulating water baths. Contractile function was
measured via a fluid-filled balloon inserted in the left ventricle and connected to a pressure
transducer (ADInstruments Pty Ltd.). Coronary flow was measured with an in-line Doppler
flow probe positioned above the aortic cannulae (Transonic Systems Inc.). All functional
data were recorded on a four-channel MacLab system (ADInstruments Pty Ltd.). Following
15–30 min of equilibration, hearts were switched to ventricular pacing at 420 beats/min
(BPM) using a SD9 stimulator (Grass Instruments, Inc.). Baseline measurements were
made for 10–20 min followed by 25 min of global normothermic ischemia and 45 min of
reperfusion. Pacing was stopped during ischemia and resumed after 15 min of reperfusion.
For peptide-treated experimental groups, 1 µM peptide solution was infused with a syringe
pump (World Precision Instruments, LLC.) into the buffer, directly upstream of the cannula,
at a rate of 1% of CF, for a final working concentration of 10 nM. Peptide was infused for
10 min prior to the onset of ischemia and during the first 15 min of reperfusion. To assess
cell death, effluent was collected at 2 and 45 min after the start of reperfusion. Effluent levels
of LDH were measured using a cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche). Normalized absorbance
values (absorbance at 492 nm minus absorbance at 690 nm) were measured using a
PHERAStar FS microplate reader (BMG Labtech). Standard curves were generated with
bovine LDH (Sigma-Aldrich) and used to convert sample absorbance values to units of LDH.
Data were normalized to CF and heart weight and then expressed as U/min/g. For all
analyses, hearts were excluded if they met the following criteria: abnormally high coronary
flow (> 8 mL/min), delayed onset of ischemic contracture (time to onset of ischemic
contracture (TOIC) > 20 min), poor contractile function after equilibration (significant

. Male Wister rats (325–395 g) were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal

injection of ketamine (80 mg/kg; Cenvet, Australia) and xylazine (10 mg/kg; Provet,
Australia), with supplemental doses given as necessary until adequate anaesthesia was
achieved. An incision was made in the abdomen of the animal and a bolus injection of 300 IU
of heparin administered into the renal vein. A sternotomy was performed and the heart was
excised and arrested by immersion in ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer (composition in mM:
118 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 MgSO4, 1.2 KH2PO4, 25 NaHCO3, 1.4 CaCl2, 11 glucose, all from
Sigma-Aldrich). Following aortic cannulation, hearts were stabilised for 10 min by retrograde
(Langendorff) perfusion with Krebs-Henseleit buffer (37°C), at a hydrostatic pressure of
100 cm H2O. During this period, the left atrial appendage was cannulated. This nonworking
Langendorff system was converted to a working preparation by switching the supply of
perfusate from the aorta to the left atrial cannula at a hydrostatic pressure of 15 cm H2O
(preload). The working heart ejected perfusate into the aortic cannula against the maintained
fixed hydrostatic pressure of 100 cm H2O (afterload). Aortic pressure was monitored via a
side arm of the aortic cannula with a pressure transducer (Ohmeda, Pty Ltd., Singapore).
Aortic flow (AF) was measured by an in-line flowmeter (Transonics Instruments Inc., Ithaca,
NY). Aortic pressure and flow were recorded using PowerLab/4e (ADInstruments Pty Ltd,
Sydney, Australia) with heart rate (HR) calculated from the flow trace. Coronary flow (CF)
was measured by timed collection of effluent draining from the heart via a small incision in
the pulmonary artery (PA). Cardiac output (CO) was calculated from the sum of AF and CF.
Figure 3a illustrates the experimental timeline. The heart was maintained in working mode
for 15 min, at which time functional parameters (AF, CF, CO and HR) were recorded and
defined as the baseline value. Any hearts having a baseline AF < 35 mL/min, HR < 200 bpm,
or CF < 10 mL/min were excluded at this stage. The heart was arrested by infusion of a
preservation flush containing Celsior solution (2–3°C) ± 10 nM Hi1a via the aortic cannula
(60 cm H2O infusion pressure over 3 min), immersed in 100 mL Celsior ± 10 nM Hi1a, and
kept on ice for 8 h. The heart was remounted on the perfusion apparatus and perfused with
fresh Krebs-Henseleit buffer for 15 min in Langendorff mode, followed by 30 min in working
mode. Celsior solution was obtained from the Institut Georges Lopez (Lissieu, France).

Cardiac functional indices after 30 min of working-mode reperfusion were expressed as
percent recovery of baseline values.
Donor heart preservation following circulatory death in rodents. The experimental
model of donation after circulatory death (DCD) in rodents (Fig. 4a) was developed by our
laboratory to closely mimic the events during withdrawal of life support (WLS) in the clinical
scenario. Male Wister rats (325–395 g) were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection
of ketamine (80 mg/kg; Cenvet, Australia) and xylazine (10 mg/kg; Provet, Australia), with
supplemental doses given as necessary until adequate anaesthesia was achieved. Noninvasive monitoring was established, consisting of measurement of pulse oximetry (Rad-5v,
Masimo Inc., Irvine, CA) and continuous electrocardiogram (P55 AC pre-amplifier, Grass
Instrument Co., RI). A midline incision was made in the neck of the animal to expose the
right carotid artery, which was cannulated for invasive monitoring of arterial pressure via a
pressure transducer (Ohmeda, Pty Ltd., Singapore). Once baseline monitoring parameters
were recorded, a dose of 500 IU for antemortem heparin was delivered via a side port in the
arterial pressure monitoring line. The animal was subjected to WLS via asphyxiation. A fixed
warm ischemic time of 10 min followed by a 2-min stand-off period (to mimic Australian
federal regulations regarding DCD heart retrieval42) was chosen. Upon completion of the
stand-off period, the heart and lungs were swiftly excised en bloc and immersed in ice-cold
Krebs-Henseleit buffer. The aorta and left atrium were fashioned for instrumentation on an
ex-vivo Langendorff perfusion apparatus. Once the aorta was cannulated onto the ex-vivo
circuit, the pulmonary veins were rapidly ligated, and the preservation flush (containing
Celsior solution (2–3°C) ± supplements) was commenced via the aortic cannula at a flow
rate of 15–20 mL/min up to a total volume of 100 mL. The following concentrations of
supplements were used: Hi1a: 10 nM; GTN: 100 mg/L; EPO: 5 U/mL; zoniporide: 1 µM. Left
atriotomy was performed to prevent left ventricle distension and to facilitate cannulation on
the ex-vivo apparatus for functional assessment during the working phase of the experiment.
Following the preservation flush, Langendorff reperfusion was commenced for a period of
30 min, using oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer (37°C) to allow stabilization and recovery
of the heart. As previously described, the apparatus was converted to a working mode via
switching the supply of perfusate from the aortic to the left atrial cannula at a hydrostatic
pressure of 15 cm H2O (preload). Functional parameters (AF, CO, PP and HR) were
measured continuously, and CF measured at 5-min intervals, during working mode.
Coronary effluent and left ventricular free-wall samples were collected as per the protocol
for the isolated working heart model.

To assess cell death throughout working mode, effluent LDH levels were measured as an
index of structural cardiomyocyte injury using the TOX 7 assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Duplicate
75 µl aliquots were assayed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting
absorbance of the tetrazolium product was measured at 492 nm using a 96-well plate reader
and expressed as arbitrary units, normalised to coronary flow per minute.
Peptide production. Recombinant Hi1a was produced by expression as a His6-maltosebinding protein (MBP) fusion protein in the periplasm of Escherichia coli as previously
described32, but with optimisation of the expression and purification conditions to improve
the yield of Hi1a. Briefly, E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were grown at 30oC in Terrific Broth until
the optical density at 600 nm reached 2.0−2.5, at which point the temperature was reduced
to 17oC and after a 15 min delay expression of the Hi1a fusion protein was induced with
1 mM IPTG. Cells were harvested after a further 21 h growth. PcTx1 and the PcTx1R27A/V32A analogue were produced in the same manner with minor modifications to the
expression protocol. E. coli were grown at 37oC for the entire expression period and
harvested approximately 4−5 h after induction.
Cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 15 mM imidazole
(pH 8.3 for Hi1a or pH 8.0 for PcTx1), and the cells were lysed by high-pressure cell
disruption (Constant Systems Limited, United Kingdom). The His6-MBP-peptide fusion
proteins were purified from the clarified soluble lysate over a nickel affinity resin. The resin
was washed with the same buffer to elute weakly bound proteins before eluting the Hi1a
fusion protein with the same buffer containing 300 mM imidazole. Fusion proteins were
exchanged into low (< 30 mM) imidazole buffer using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal
concentrators (Merck Millipore, Germany) with a 30 kDa molecular weight cut-off in
preparation for liberation of Hi1a from the fusion tag using tobacco etch virus (TEV)
protease. The fusion proteins were cleaved in redox buffer containing 3 mM reduced
glutathione and 0.3 mM oxidised glutathione at pH 8.3 for Hi1a or pH 8.0 for PcTx1, using
~1 mg of TEV protease per 50 mg of fusion protein. For Hi1a the cleavage reaction was
allowed to proceed at 4oC over 3−6 days. For the PcTx1 peptides, cleavage was performed
at room temperature for a minimum of 16 h. The recombinant peptides each contain a nonnative N-terminal serine residue, which is a vestige of the TEV protease recognition site.
The released peptides were purified from the cleavage reaction solutions using reverse
phase high-performance liquid chromatography.
The mass of the purified peptides were confirmed by electrospray-ionisation mass
spectrometry and pure peptides were lyophilised prior to confirmation of ASIC1a inhibitory

activity using two electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology, as described previously for
both Hi1a32 and PcTx130,65,72. Unless otherwise noted, lyophilized stocks of peptide were
reconstituted in sterile deionised water prior to use.
Western blot. Left ventricular tissue samples (~60 mg) from hearts (N = 6/group) collected
at the end of the DCD protocol were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl,
50 mM Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM glycerophosphate,
5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 15% Roche cocktail protease inhibitors; pH 7.4). Samples were
centrifuged at 10,000 rpm (9,400 g) for 5 min at 4°C. The protein concentration of each
lysate was measured using a Bradford assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL), with
bovine serum albumin used as standard. If required, immunoprecipitation (IP) was
performed (see below). Protein samples (40 µg) were heated at 95°C in Laemmli sample
loading buffer for 10 min and electrophoretically separated on 4–20% graduated precast
gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking with
5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween-20, membranes
were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibody (pRIP3 Ser227, Cell Signalling
Technology, USA). Membranes were incubated with secondary anti-rabbit (1:2000 in 5%
non-fat dry milk + TBS-T) or anti-mouse (1:5000 in 1% BSA + TBS-T) IgG conjugated to
horseradish peroxidase (GE healthcare, Ryadalmere, Australia) for 1 h at 25°C. Protein
bands were visualized using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Life
Technologies, Scoresby, VIC, Australia), digitized, and quantified using Image J software
(Version 1.52a, National Institute of Health, USA). Within each blot, the signal intensity from
each lane was normalized to the Celsior-only group average from the same membrane.
Blots were repeated to confirm results. All antibodies, unless otherwise stated, were sourced
from Cell Signalling Technology (Beverly, MA).
Immunoprecipitation. Lysate samples from individual hearts prepared as detailed above
were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 g (4°C). Lysates were diluted with lysis buffer without
DTT to make a final volume of 0.5 mL containing 1 mg of total proteins (1 µg/µl). Pre-clearing
of the samples was performed by adding 60 µl of 50% Protein A agarose beads to 1 mL of
diluted lysate from above. Samples were tumbled for 30 min at 4°C in a tube rotator, prior
to being centrifuged for 5 min at 1,000 g (4°C), and supernatants were collected for
immunoprecipitation. The cleared lysates were divided into two 400-µl aliquots and 1:100
specific primary antibody added to form the Ag/Ab complex (pRIP3 Ser227, Cell Signalling
Technology, USA). 50 µl of 50% Protein A beads were added followed by gentle rocking for

2 h at 4°C. Following centrifugation for 30 s at 10,000 g, 4°C, the supernatant (containing
unbound proteins) was aspirated, and either discarded or snap frozen at –80°C for
sequential immunoprecipitation of other antigens. The remaining pellet was washed five
times with 500 µl of ice-cold lysis buffer. For each wash, the beads were re-suspended by
inversion and centrifuged for 30 s at 1000 g at 4°C, prior to the supernatant being aspirated
and discarded. The final pellet was resuspended with 50 µl of 2 x SDS sample buffer without
β-mercaptoethanol. The samples were mixed vigorously and heat denatured for 5 min at
95°C. Following a 30 s centrifugation at 10,000 g, the supernatants were transferred to new
vials and β-mercaptoethanol was added. The prepared samples were loaded on 4–20%
graduated precast gels (Bio-Rad) and analysed by Western blotting as detailed above.
Generation of cardiomyocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells. All hiPSC
studies were performed with consent from The University of Queensland’s Institutional
Human Research Ethics approval (HREC#: 2015001434). Cardiomyocytes generated in this
study were derived from the WTC-11 hiPSC line (Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular
Disease, UCSF)73,74. Undifferentiated hiPSCs were maintained on Vitronectin XF (5 µg/mL,
Stem Cell Technologies) coated tissue culture dishes as per manufacturer recommendation
with either mTeSR medium with supplementation or mTeSR PLUS medium with
supplementation (Stem Cell Technologies). Contractile cardiomyocytes were differentiated
using a high-density monolayer format as previously described51. On day 1 of differentiation,
hiPSCs were dissociated with 0.5 mM EDTA solution supplemented with 1.1 mM D-glucose.
Single-cell suspensions were plated at a density of 1.2 x 105 cells/cm2 and cultured overnight
in mTeSR medium supplemented with 10 µM Y-27632 dihydrochloride (Stem Cell
Technologies). Once the monolayer reached approximately 80% confluence (usually the
following day), differentiation was induced (day 0). The cells were quickly washed with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by a change in medium to RPMI (ThermoFisher)
containing 3 µM CHIR99021 (Stem Cell Technologies), 500 µg/mL BSA (Sigma Aldrich),
and 213 µg/mL ascorbic acid (Sigma Aldrich). After 3 days of culture, the medium was
exchanged to RPMI containing 500 µg/mL BSA, 213 µg/mL ascorbic acid, and 5 µM Xav939 (Stem Cell Technologies). On day 5, the medium was replaced with RPMI containing
BSA and ascorbic acid as on day 3. Starting on day 7, the cells were fed every other day
with RPMI containing 1x B27 supplement with insulin (Life Technologies). Spontaneous
beating was typically observed between days 9 and 11 of differentiation.

In vitro ischemia-acidosis injury model with hiPSC-CMs. Differentiated cardiomyocytes
were replated on either day 15 or day 17 of differentiation for in vitro ischemia/acidosis
assays. At the time of replating, a subset of cells (~500,000) was set aside for flow cytometry
analysis of cardiomyocyte purity (see below). For all experiments, only cell preparations with
greater than 80% sarcomeric α-actinin-positive cardiomyocytes were used. After re-plating,
the cells were maintained for an additional 7 days in RPMI + B27. To prepare media for
ischemia/acidosis injury, 10x HBSS without sodium bicarbonate (Sigma) was diluted to 1x
concentration in sterile tissue culture-grade water. Solutions were buffered with either
12 mM HEPES (for pH 7.4 media, Sigma Aldrich) or 12 mM MES (for pH < 6.5, Sigma
Aldrich) and the pH adjusted accordingly with 1 M NaOH. The medium was sterile filtered
with 0.22 µm syringe filters (Millipore). Unless otherwise noted, the replated cells were
treated overnight (18 h) in HBSS with or without peptide under either normoxic (~18.5% O2;
5% CO2) or hypoxic (0.5% O2; 5% CO2) culture conditions. For reperfusion experiments, the
medium was replaced with HBSS pH 7.4 (with or without peptide) after overnight incubation
and cultured for 1 h under in normoxic conditions.
To assess cell death, the supernatant was collected and LDH levels were measured using
a cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche). For all cell culture experiments, percent cell death was
calculated using low and high controls. For low control (LC), cardiomyocytes were cultured
overnight in standard culture media (RPMI + B27). For high control (HC), cells were cultured
in RPMI + B27 containing 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich).
Flow cytometry. To assess the cardiomyocyte purity of differentiated cell populations, cells
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma Aldrich), permeabilized in 0.75% saponin
(Sigma Aldrich), and labelled with Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated sarcomeric α-actinin (SA)
antibody (Miltenyi Biotec Australia Pty) or PE-conjugated mouse isotype (IgG) control
(Miltenyi Biotec Australia Pty). Stained samples were analysed on a FACS CANTO II
(Becton Dickinson) machine with FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences). Data were analysed
was using FlowJo software and cardiac populations were determined with population gating
from isotype controls.
Immunohistochemisty/TUNEL stain. After overnight treatment at low pH, replated hiPSCCMs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed in PBS, and incubated for 1 h
at room temperature in blocking solution (PBS containing 2% heat-inactivated sheep serum
(HISS) and 0.05% Triton X-100). Cells were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary
antibody followed by incubation with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei
were counterstained with 1 µg/mL DAPI. The samples were washed with PBS and TUNEL

stain (Abcam) was performed as per manufacturer protocol. Stained samples were imaged
within one week. All antibody dilutions were prepared in blocking solution. The following
antibodies were used: mouse anti-α-actinin (Clone EA-53, Sigma Aldrich, 1:100) and donkey
anti-mouse AlexaFluor 647 (ThermoFisher, 1:100). High-resolution images were obtained
using a Zeiss LSM710 AiryScan confocal microscope with 20x 0.8 NA or 40x 1.3 NA Plan
Apochromat objectives running Zeiss Zen Black. All image processing and quantitation was
performed in FIJI 75.
qRT-PCR. To assess mRNA transcript levels in hiPSC-CM populations, total RNA was
extracted using a RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Superscript III First Strand Synthesis
(ThermoFisher) was used to generate cDNA and qRT-PCR was performed on ViiA 7 RealTime PCR Machine (Applied Biosystems) with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix
(ThermoFisher). Transcript copy numbers were calculated using the 2-ΔΔCt method relative
to the housekeeping gene HPRT1. Primers used for qRT-PCR analysis were as follows:

hiPSC-CM calcium analysis. Cardiomyocytes were replated (2 x 104 per well) in a 384 well
plate (CellBIND black with clear bottom, Corning) and cultured for 7 days in RPMI + B27.
On the day of the experiment, the cells were loaded for 1.5 h at 37°C with FLIPR calcium 4
dye (Molecular Devices) diluted in HBSS pH 7.4. After loading, the plate was transferred to
a FLIPR Tetra fluorescent plate reader (Molecular Devices). Calcium transients were

measured with excitation wavelengths at 470–495 nm and emission at 515–575 nm. For
each plate, the camera gain and intensity were adjusted to optimize signal intensity. Data
for each well were expressed as normalized arbitrary fluorescence units. All data were
acquired at 0.5 s per read, with baseline measurements for 45 s followed by at least 100 s
of data collection after each peptide addition. To assess peptide effects on calcium handling
in normal physiological conditions, concentrated peptide dilutions (in HBSS pH 7.4) were
added to each well to give a final concentration of 1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, or 1 µM. Calcium
amplitude, maximum calcium, minimum calcium, and spontaneous beating rate were
analysed using ScreenWorks software (Molecular Devices) and normalized to baseline
measurements.
Analysis of ASIC1 from GWAS studies of relevant conditions. To assess whether
genetic variation of ASIC1 associates with cardiovascular disease and stroke, we performed
a gene-based level test on GWAS summary data using fastBAT49 implemented in the
Complex-Traits Genetics Virtual Lab (CTG-VL)76. GWAS summary data contains the
statistical information of the association of all the genetic variants included in a GWAS
against a particular trait. fastBat tests the aggregated effects of a set of genetic variants
within or close to (± 50 kb) each tested gene (ACCN1 in this case) using a set-based
association approach which accounts for the correlation between genetic variants (i.e.
linkage disequilibrium). This provides a more powerful approach over single-variant tests
done in GWAS. Specifically, we performed analyses using GWAS summary data for acute
MI (Ncases =5,948, Ncontrols = 354,176), major coronary heart disease (Ncases = 10,157, Ncontrols
= 351,037) and MI (Ncases = 7,018, Ncontrols = 354,176) from Neale’s UK Biobank GWAS
database48 and stroke (including any type of stroke, ischemic stroke, large artery stroke,
cardioembolic stroke and small vessel stroke50 (Ncases =40,585, Ncontrols = 406,111).
Computational analysis of human translatome data. Transcriptional (mRNA-seq) and
translational (Ribo-seq) raw data of human heart were obtained from the Hubner Lab
website (http://shiny.mdc-berlin.de/cardiac-translatome/)46. Quality control checks for both
RNA-seq and Ribo-seq data sets were performed to ensure reasonable quality for
downstream analysis. Genes that were expressed in > 99% of samples were retained. After
quality control, 47,094 and 43,183 genes were retained in the RNA-seq and Ribo-seq
datasets, respectively. DESeq2 normalization was applied to normalize sequencing depth
and RNA composition. The detailed normalization workflow performed by DESeq277
involved four steps. First, calculated row-wise geometric mean (pseudo-reference sample)
by square root of the product of all expression values across samples for each gene.

Second, the ratio of each sample to the row-wise geometric mean was calculating by
dividing the expression value of every gene by their row-wise geometric mean within a
sample. Third, the normalization factor was calculated for each sample, which is the median
value of all ratios for a sample. Lastly, the normalized count was calculated using the
normalization factor, in which each raw count in a sample was divided by the normalization
factor of that sample, and this was performed for every gene in every sample. The
normalized counts were log-transformed to eliminate the effect of extreme values.
A total of 80 samples were analysed, including a dilated cardiomyopathy group (65 samples)
and control group (15 samples). We utilized R package ggplot2 (v3.2.1)78 with box and violin
plot to generate the two conditions in one graph for the genes encoding ASIC1, ASIC2,
ASIC3, and ASIC4, in order to visualize the distribution of gene expression within one group
and compare expression differences between groups.
