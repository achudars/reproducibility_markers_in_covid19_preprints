Abstract

2

Neural adaptation enables sensory information to be represented optimally in the brain

3

despite large fluctuations over time in the statistics of the environment. Auditory contrast gain

4

control represents an important example, which is thought to arise primarily from cortical

5

processing. We find, however, that neurons in both the auditory thalamus and midbrain of

6

mice show robust contrast gain control, and that this is implemented independently of cortical

7

activity. Although neurons at each level exhibit contrast gain control to similar degrees,

8

adaptation time constants become longer at later stages of the processing hierarchy, resulting

9

in progressively more stable representations. We also show that auditory discrimination

10

thresholds in human listeners compensate for changes in contrast, and that the strength of

11

this perceptual adaptation can be predicted from physiological measurements. Contrast

12

adaptation is therefore a robust property of both the subcortical and cortical auditory system

13

and accounts for the short-term adaptability of perceptual judgments.

Introduction

16

Adaptation to stimulus statistics is a fundamental principle of sensory processing1–3, which

17

enables the brain to represent sensory information in ways that are computationally

18

efficient3,4 and robust to noise5,6. Certain forms of adaptation to stimulus statistics have been

19

well studied and are known to be present at early sensory processing levels. In the visual

20

system, for example, retinal responses adapt to mean light intensity7, while in the auditory

21

system, adaptation to mean sound level has been demonstrated at the level of the auditory

22

nerve8–10. Nevertheless, it remains poorly understood how adaptation to higher stimulus

23

statistics changes as a result of hierarchical processing within the sensory systems or how this

24

links to perception.

25

In both the visual and auditory systems, neurons adapt to stimulus contrast – that is,

26

the variability of light or sound level11–13. The dominant effect of contrast adaptation is to alter

27

neuronal gain so as to compensate for the distribution of stimulus levels in a given sensory

28

environment11–13. This is therefore known as contrast gain control (or contrast normalization).

29

Visual contrast gain control is implemented at several stages of the visual system12–20, and is

30

partially guided by corticofugal projections from primary visual cortex

31

consequences of contrast adaptation are controversial, although one report suggests that this

32

enhance the ability of observers to detect subsequent contrast changes22. In the auditory

33

system, however, the relative contributions of subcortical and cortical structures and their role

34

in contrast gain control have not yet been fully elucidated, and it is not known how contrast

35

gain control affects perception.

36

Contrast gain control is a prominent feature of neuronal responses in the auditory

37

cortex of mice23 and ferrets11, but in ferrets is less robust in the midbrain6. Although this

38

implies a primary role for auditory cortex in contrast gain control, recent studies have shown

39

that thalamic neurons can change their responses according to sensory, motor and cognitive

40

demands24–27 (reviewed in ref. 28), suggesting that they may also contribute to adaptation to

41

stimulus statistics. Furthermore, descending influences from the cortex need to be considered:

42

manipulation of auditory corticofugal projections can alter the excitability and tuning

43

properties of neurons in both the thalamus29–32 and midbrain30,31,33,34, but their involvement in

44

adaptation to stimulus statistics remains largely unexplored8.

45

In this study, we demonstrate the effects of contrast adaptation on human

46

perception, by showing that acuity in a level discrimination task is rapidly adjusted to partially

47

match changes in sound contrast. We also show physiologically that auditory contrast gain

48

control is present to comparable degrees in the lemniscal auditory midbrain, thalamus, and

49

primary auditory cortex of mice, with progressive increases in temporal stability at each

50

ascending processing level. Surprisingly, cortical silencing has no effect on subcortical contrast

51

gain control, despite significant effects on neuronal excitability, suggesting that the midbrain

52

and thalamus implement adaptation independently of cortex. Finally, we show that the

53

strength of perceptual contrast adaptation can be predicted from the physiological contrast

54

adaptation observed in auditory neurons.

Results

57

Sound level discrimination in human listeners is modulated by auditory contrast

58

To examine the perceptual consequences of changing the contrast of auditory stimuli, we

59

measured the ability of human participants to discriminate the levels of two broadband noise

60

stimuli presented in different contrast environments. The stimuli were 100 ms snippets of

61

band-limited noise, separated by 250 ms, and flanked by dynamic random chords (DRCs) with

62

either 10 dB or 30 dB contrast (Fig. 1a). We found that level discrimination performance

63

improved when the contrast of the flanking DRCs was low (Fig. 1b), and that this effect was

64

not the result of small contrast-dependent differences in overall sound level that are inherent

65

to the DRC stimuli (Supplementary Fig. 1; see Methods). All participants (n = 8) showed this

66

increase in sensitivity (t(7) = 5.2, p = 0.003, n = 8), as measured using the just noticeable

67

difference (JND, the dB difference between the 25% and 75% points on a fitted psychometric

68

curve; Fig. 1c). The JND increased by a mean of 38.8% between low and high contrast

69

conditions (a threefold change in stimulus contrast), corresponding to 28.8% compensation for

70

contrast change.

82

Robust contrast gain control in the auditory midbrain, thalamus and cortex

83

In order to understand the role of different sensory processing levels in auditory contrast

84

adaptation, we recorded extracellular activity from neurons in the lemniscal areas of the

85

auditory midbrain (central nucleus of the inferior colliculus, CNIC), thalamus (ventral division

86

of the medial geniculate body, MGBv), and primary auditory cortex (A1) of anesthetized mice

87

while playing complex spectro-temporal stimuli (DRCs, see Methods) with either high (40 dB)

88

or low (20 dB) contrast (Fig. 2a-c, 3a). We fitted separate spectro-temporal receptive fields

89

(STRFs) to the responses of each neuron in high and low contrast conditions and measured

90

various STRF properties in both conditions (Supplementary Fig. 2). We concluded that the

91

differences in tuning were small enough that it was appropriate to fit a single STRF to all the

92

data from each neuron (Fig. 2d, 2e, 3b). We then fitted an output nonlinearity for each

93

contrast condition (Fig. 2f, 3c). Contrast adaptation in auditory neurons was assessed by

94

comparing the output nonlinearities in high and low contrast conditions (see Methods).

95

As predicted from previous studies11,23, we found that neurons in A1 exhibited strong

96

contrast gain control – i.e., the slope of the output nonlinearity was adjusted following a

97

change in contrast – and that this gain control largely compensated for the difference in

98

stimulus contrast (Fig. 2f, 3c, 3d). In auditory cortex, the median degree of compensation was

99

70.2% (p = 9.6 x10-14, n = 106 units, 10 mice, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Surprisingly, we also

100

found strong compensatory contrast gain control in MGBv (median = 55%, p = 3.6 x10-16, n =

101

136 units, 8 mice) and CNIC (median = 70.8%, p = 1.7 x10-64, n = 499 units, 13 mice; Fig. 3d). A

102

Kruskal-Wallis test between contrast gain control in CNIC, MGBv, and A1 revealed no

103

significant differences (p = 0.31). These results show that neurons in CNIC, MGBv and A1

104

substantially compensate for changes in stimulus contrast by adjusting the gain of their input-

105

output relationships. These findings were not sensitive to the specific inclusion criteria used in

106

this study (Supplementary Fig. 3).

121

Rabinowitz et al.11 found no difference in contrast gain control in cortical neurons

122

between awake and anesthetized ferrets. We extended this observation by examining

123

whether anesthesia affected contrast gain control in the CNIC. We repeated our recordings in

124

the CNIC of awake, passively listening, head-fixed mice. We found that contrast gain control

125

was robustly present in the CNIC of awake mice (median = 63.9% compensation, p = 1.2 x10-50,

126

n = 380, 6 mice, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), and indistinguishable in magnitude from that

127

exhibited by CNIC units under anesthesia (p = 0.1, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Fig. 3c, d). A

128

control experiment confirmed that these effects could not be attributed to small changes in

129

overall sound level between high and low contrast stimuli (Supplementary Fig. 4).

130

We also determined whether the baseline firing rate during DRC stimulation – i.e. the

131

y-offset of the output nonlinearity – was altered by contrast. We found that baseline firing

132

rates in CNIC were unaffected by contrast in both anesthetized (p = 0.46, Wilcoxon signed-

133

rank test) and awake mice (p = 0.74). However, significant decreases in baseline firing rates

134

were measured in both MGBv (–18.5% median change, p = 9.4x10-7, Wilcoxon signed-rank

135

test) and A1 (–8.8% median change, p = 3.1x10-9) during high contrast stimulation, potentially

136

providing an additional mechanism to make overall firing rates invariant to contrast at these

137

higher levels of the auditory pathway (Fig. 3e).

149

A role for cortex in controlling subcortical response excitability and reliability

150

Although the auditory cortex has been found to heavily influence the subcortical processing of

151

simple tones29,31,35, little is known about its contribution to the representation of complex

152

sounds in the thalamus or midbrain. In order to understand the role of descending corticofugal

153

projections in the implementation of contrast gain control, we first examined the effect of

154

cortical inactivation on the activity of subcortical neurons during continuous DRC stimulation.

155

Transiently silencing auditory cortex by optogenetic activation of inhibitory neurons

156

(Supplementary Fig. 5) reduced the mean firing rate of MGBv units (nMGBv = 102, 5 mice) during

157

both high contrast (–23.6% median change, p = 4.2x10-18, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and low

158

contrast (–31.3% median change, p = 3.4x10-18) stimulation, as well as the standard deviation

159

of the firing rate across time (high contrast: –15.8% median change, p = 7.8 x10-17; low

160

contrast: –23.1% median change, p = 2.1 x10-17) (Fig. 4a, b). Similar but weaker effects of

161

cortical silencing were found in the CNIC of awake mice (Supplementary Fig. 6).

162

Given these strong effects on MGBv activity, and to a lesser degree on CNIC activity,

163

we examined whether corticofugal input influenced the structure of the STRFs in these

164

subcortical regions. We measured the effects of cortical silencing on BF, spectral bandwidth,

165

temporal bandwidth, and on the value of the largest weight in the spectral kernel (i.e. the BF

166

weight). We found that silencing auditory cortical activity had no effect on either the shape of

167

the STRFs of MGBv units (Fig. 4d-g) or CNIC units (Supplementary Fig. 6) (p > 0.05, Wilcoxon

168

signed-rank tests).

169

Surprisingly, the reliability (NP/SP) of responses to DRC stimuli was increased (i.e.,

170

lower NP/SP) in both MGBv (–23.8% median change, p = 1.0x10-6 Wilcoxon signed-rank test),

171

and CNIC of awake mice (–11.4% median change, p = 6.0x10-6) when cortex was silenced (Fig.

172

4h, Supplementary Fig. 6). We also found that after silencing auditory cortex, neurons were

173

better described by a linear model in the MGBv (14.9% median change, p = 8.0x10-6; Fig. 4i)

174

and in the CNIC of awake mice (4.0% median change, p = 8.0x10-6; Supplementary Fig. 6).

175

These results demonstrate that despite providing a strong excitatory input to MGBv,

176

and to a lesser extent the CNIC, the auditory cortex does not contribute to the receptive field

177

structure of their neurons, but instead influences the reliability and linearity of thalamic

178

responses to complex sounds.

202

Subcortical contrast gain control is independent of cortical activity

203

Given the effects of cortical silencing on subcortical responses, it is possible that contrast gain

204

control in MGBv and CNIC neurons might reflect a context-dependent influence of the

205

extensive corticofugal pathways on each of these subcortical structures36. Alternatively,

206

subcortical contrast adaptation could be the result of independent computations in the CNIC

207

and/or MGBv. We addressed this directly by optogenetic silencing of auditory cortex while

208

recording from the CNIC and MGBv and presenting DRCs with either high (40 dB) or low (20

209

dB) contrast (Fig. 5). We fitted separate output nonlinearities to each condition (4 conditions)

210

from a linear spectro-temporal prediction across all conditions (cortex silenced or intact, with

211

high or low contrast stimuli) (Fig. 5a, b).

212

We found that subcortical contrast gain control in anesthetized mice was not affected

213

by transient optogenetic cortical silencing. This was the case for units in both MGBv (p = 0.1, n

214

= 99, 5 mice, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and CNIC (p = 0.5, n = 169, 5 mice) (Fig. 5b, c). To

215

control for anesthetic state, we carried out optogenetic cortical silencing in awake head-fixed

216

mice while recording from CNIC. Again, we found no effect on contrast gain control in the

217

CNIC (pCNIC_Awake = 0.3, nCNIC_Awake = 129, 3 mice) (Fig. 5b, c).

218

We also examined whether auditory cortex contributes to the effects of contrast on the

219

y-offset in the MGBv. Cortical silencing did not affect this value in MGBv units (pMGBv = 0.054,

220

nMGBv = 99, 5 mice), suggesting that the contrast-dependent change in y-offset adaptation is

221

also independent of cortical activity (Fig. 5d). These results therefore suggest that auditory

222

cortex does not provide the basis for the auditory contrast adaptation (gain control and y-

223

offset adaptation) exhibited by subcortical neurons.

collected an additional dataset with recordings (under anesthesia) from CNIC (n = 155 units, 4

241

mice), MGBv (n = 56 units, 4 mice) and A1 (n = 73 units, 4 mice). We presented DRCs whose

242

contrast switched between high (40 dB) and low (20 dB) values every 2 seconds. We modeled

243

responses (Fig. 6a) to this switching DRC using an expanded contrast-dependent LN model,

244

where the parameters of the output nonlinearity were allowed to decay exponentially

245

between high- and low-contrast states with a time constant τ.

246

In the CNIC, time constants were very fast (median τCNIC = 28 ms), indicating that

247

substantial adaptation occurred during the first chord (duration 25 ms) after each spectro-

248

temporal contrast transition (Fig. 6b). For many CNIC units, the inclusion of an adaptation time

249

constant did not improve predictions over the standard contrast-dependent LN model. This

250

further suggests that adaptation was rapid compared to the chord duration. Adaptation time

increased with each ascending sensory processing step (median τMGBv = 79 ms; median τA1 =

252

175 ms) (Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0.001), with post-hoc comparisons (Dunn-Sidak corrected)

253

demonstrating significantly longer median adaptation times from CNIC to MGBv (p < 0.05) and

254

from MGBv to A1 (p < 0.05) (Fig. b).

255

In accordance with this increase in adaptation time from the midbrain to the cortex,

256

the inclusion of an adaptation time constant in the contrast-dependent LN model also became

257

increasingly important. While including adaptation time as a parameter in the contrast-

258

dependent LN model improved the prediction of neural activity in only 14.9% of CNIC units,

259

this increased to 25.0% in MGBv, and to more than half the units recorded in A1 (54.8%; black

260

bars in Fig. 6b). A subset of units was estimated to have the maximum time constant allowed

261

by the model (700 ms, because longer time constants could not be reliably estimated using

262

stimuli whose contrast switched every 2 seconds). This is likely to be a ceiling effect, and

263

suggests that a subset of units have time constants that may be longer than this. Units

264

estimated to have these long time constants were most frequently found in A1.

265

The progressive increase in time constants might result from differences in the

266

temporal resolution of spectro-temporal representations at different processing levels.

267

Indeed, the temporal bandwidth (estimated as the full width half maximum of the temporal

268

kernel in a separable STRF) differed between units recorded at each level (Kruskal-Wallis test,

269

p = 1.1x10-12; Fig. 6c). Post-hoc comparisons revealed significantly (Dunn-Sidak corrected)

270

shorter temporal bandwidths in CNIC relative to both A1 (p < 0.05) and MGBv (p < 0.05). Units

271

in MGBv had intermediate values between CNIC and A1, but these were not significantly

272

different from A1 (p > 0.05). However, within each auditory structure, we did not find a

273

correlation between temporal bandwidths and contrast adaptation time constants (Spearman

274

correlation, p > 0.10). Thus, although both parameters increase in value along the auditory

differences were found between these values (one-way ANOVA, p = 0.22), suggesting that the

gain control measured at each level of the auditory pathway is sufficient to account for the

313

Discussion

314

Our results demonstrate that auditory contrast adaptation, which has been associated mainly

315

with the auditory cortex11,23, is exhibited to a similar degree by neurons in lemniscal

316

subcortical structures – the CNIC and MGBv. Moreover, we have shown that this subcortical

317

adaptation is independent of cortical activity. We also found that perceptual thresholds in a

318

sound level discrimination task compensate for contrast in a similar way, and that the strength

319

of perceptual contrast adaptation can be predicted from the gain control exhibited by auditory

320

neurons.

321
322

A hierarchy of auditory contrast adaptation

323

Previous work in the ferret has shown that contrast adaptation is weaker and less consistent in

324

the CNIC than in A16, and does not consistently compensate for stimulus contrast. In contrast,

325

the results of this study show that compensatory contrast gain control in mice is not purely a

326

cortical computation, but is present to a comparable degree in both the lemniscal auditory

327

midbrain and the thalamus. Although the contrasts used by Rabinowitz et al.6 were different

328

from those used in the present study, it is possible that this reflects a difference in subcortical

329

computations between mouse and ferret. In both species, however, the data suggest a

330

hierarchy of contrast adaptation, wherein subcortical structures exhibit contrast gain control

331

but in cortex this becomes more consistent across neurons (in ferrets) or more temporally

332

stable (in mice). In the visual system, a similar hierarchy of contrast normalization is present at

333

multiple processing levels from the retina upwards37.

334

It is possible that contrast gain control is also exhibited by neurons in more peripheral

335

structures, particularly as adaptation to mean sound level takes place in the auditory nerve9.

336

However, modelling studies suggest that contrast gain control is present to a very limited

337

degree in the auditory nerve6. In any case, our results show that auditory subcortical neurons

15

338

can execute contrast gain control without the involvement of cortical activity. A full

339

understanding of contrast gain control will therefore require new hypotheses to be developed

340

about the subcortical neural circuitry and mechanisms that underlie this fundamental property

341

of auditory neurons.

342
343

Stabilization of contrast adaptation along the auditory pathway

344

Although we found that the overall strength of contrast gain control is similar in CNIC, MGBv

345

and A1, adaptation is not the same at each level of the processing hierarchy. A reduction in

346

baseline firing rate during high contrast stimulation, which may provide an additional

347

mechanism for making overall firing rates invariant to contrast, is found only in the MGBv and

348

A1. Furthermore, the temporal dynamics of contrast gain control change as we ascend the

349

auditory pathway, suggesting that additional contrast-dependent processing happens at each

350

level. In keeping with Rabinowitz et al.6, we found that the time constants for auditory

351

contrast gain control become longer at higher levels of the processing hierarchy. This mirrors

352

previous results showing that the temporal integration window for auditory inputs becomes

353

longer from the CNIC, through MGBv, to A138,39.

354

The changes we observe in adaptation time constant cannot be accounted for by

355

temporal bandwidth changes in neuronal STRFs. This suggests that neurons at each processing

356

level may actively adapt to the recent history of stimulus contrast over a range of timescales,

357

rather than merely acting as relays for the transmission of auditory contrast. The progressive

358

increase in the time constant of adaptation along the auditory hierarchy is likely to result in an

359

increasingly stable representation of the auditory environment in the cortex relative to

360

subcortical nuclei. Furthermore, the presence of multiple time scales of adaptation at different

361

levels of the auditory pathway may provide an effective means for representing sounds

362

presented in different acoustical environments or tasks. Such diversity of dynamics among

363

different cells also exists for visual contrast adaptation in the retina16 and adaptation to mean

364

level in the CNIC40, suggesting that this may be a widespread property of sensory systems.

365
366

Contrast gain control as neuronal normalization

367

Contrast gain control in the auditory cortex appears to be a specific case of neuronal

368

normalization wherein the sensitivity of neurons adjusts to compensate for stimulus

369

contrast37,41. It has been suggested that normalization is a canonical computation in sensory

370

systems and is present at multiple processing levels37. The results presented in this study

371

expand on this idea by demonstrating that contrast gain control is not only a property of

372

neurons in auditory cortex, where it has been studied most extensively6,11,23,42, but, at least in

373

mice, is equally robust in the CNIC and MGBv. Contrast gain control is therefore established at

374

a relatively early processing level in the auditory pathway and presumably inherited by

375

neurons at later stages.

376

Our results demonstrate for the first time an important role for the thalamus in

377

contrast adaptation, by both increasing the duration of the adaptation time constants and

378

introducing a subtractive component (y-offset adaptation) that is subsequently inherited by

379

cortex. Neither the contrast gain control nor the subtractive component in contrast adaptation

380

found in the thalamus is dependent on auditory cortical activity. Thus, the thalamus is an

381

active contributor to contrast adaptation in the ascending auditory pathway, and not merely a

382

relay from the midbrain to the cortex.

383

The longer adaptation time constants we observe in the cortex suggest that further

384

contrast-related processing happens there. As the representation of sound features changes

385

along the ascending auditory pathway43, corresponding changes in contrast adaptation may be

386

required at each successive stage. If that is the case, an important question for future research

387

will be whether contrast gain control is implemented via different neural architectures, as has

388

been shown for other neuromodulatory computations44,45. Thus, although auditory contrast

389

normalization can be viewed as a canonical computation in the brain, it is unlikely to be

390

implemented by a canonical neural circuit.

391
392

Corticofugal influences on auditory processing of complex sounds

393

Corticofugal projections have previously been shown to have modulatory effects on the

394

excitability and tuning properties of neurons in subcortical nuclei in the auditory29,31,33,34,46–48,

395

visual49,50 and somatosensory51,52 systems. Several studies have reported a net excitatory

396

effect of corticothalamic feedback, which can contribute to changes in receptive field

397

shape29,31,32,49–51,53,54. In the auditory system, corticofugal modulation has mostly been assessed

398

by measuring spontaneous activity and responses to tones and noise29,31,53,54, and evidence for

399

how complex sound processing in the thalamus is affected is sparse. However, recent work

17

400

suggests that corticothalamic feedback from layer VI of A1 to MGBv contributes to auditory

401

scene analysis55. Furthermore, in the somatosensory system, in vitro recordings have

402

demonstrated that the effects of corticothalamic feedback are dynamic, changing from

403

suppressive to facilitatory depending on stimulation frequency56, suggesting that

404

corticothalamic input may contribute to context-dependent processing of sensory

405

information.

406

Our cortical silencing results indicate that while corticofugal inputs have a strong

407

effect on overall excitability of thalamic neurons (and a weaker effect on the CNIC), the

408

receptive field properties of neurons in these subcortical structures remain unchanged. The

409

reduction in excitability induced by transient optogenetic silencing of the auditory cortex, and

410

the difference in corticofugal effects on CNIC and MGBv, are in accordance with what would

411

be expected from previous studies of the effects of widespread inactivation of A1 on

412

subcortical responses to simple stimuli57. However, focal silencing or activation of auditory

413

cortical areas can shift the BF of neurons in both the MGBv and CNIC30–32. Manipulating the

414

activity of frequency-specific regions of auditory cortex may therefore have similar effects on

415

the structure of the STRFs acquired from complex sounds, which would be consistent with a

416

potential role for corticofugal feedback in the task-dependent STRF plasticity of auditory

417

midbrain neurons58.

418

It has been proposed on the basis of in vitro investigations that corticothalamic

419

feedback provides synaptic noise, which helps thalamic neurons to integrate synaptic inputs

420

more linearly59,60. However, by isolating the corticofugal contribution to the representation of

421

ongoing stimuli in vivo, our results suggest that corticofugal activity decreases the linear input-

422

output relationship and the reliability of neuronal responses in the CNIC and MGBv. In the

423

CNIC, this effect of cortical silencing on the transfer function of the neurons appears to

424

depend on wakefulness, but in the MGBv was present even under anesthesia, implying that it

425

is not simply a result of trial-to-trial variability in corticofugal synaptic transmission due to

426

changes in cognitive state.

427

Although cortical silencing alters the excitability, reliability and linearity of MGBv and

428

CNIC responses, we found no effect on the strength of contrast gain control. This is consistent

429

with the lack of effect of widespread cortical cooling on adaptation to mean level by IC

430

neurons8. However, cortical deactivation does prevent the change in the rate of adaptation by

431

IC neurons following repeated exposure to stimuli with different sound level distributions8. It

432

is therefore possible that descending corticofugal inputs might play a role in contrast

433

adaptation in rapidly changing acoustic environments.

434
435

A role for auditory contrast adaptation in perception

436

The behavioral consequences of adaptation to stimulus statistics in the auditory system have

437

received very little attention. Presenting sounds with interaural level differences61 or

438

interaural time differences62 that follow specific statistical distributions results in comparable

439

adaptive changes in the sensitivity of binaural neurons in the brain and in the perceptual

440

sensitivity of human listeners. Furthermore, adaptation to mean level and contrast can

441

improve the decoding of complex sounds from population neuronal activity, potentially

442

providing a mechanism for establishing noise invariance6.

443

Our results directly show for the first time that contrast adaptation affects human

444

auditory perception, and that the strength of adaptation is predictable from contrast

445

adaptation in midbrain, thalamic, and cortical auditory neurons. This highlights the importance

446

of adaptation in regulating both neuronal and perceptual sensitivity according to the ongoing

447

statistics of the sensory environment. Furthermore, there is evidence that contrast gain

448

control may mediate the effects of attention on neural processing63,64. It would therefore be

449

interesting to determine whether contrast gain control at different levels of the auditory

450

system can be differentially modulated depending on the sensory and behavioral contexts in

451

which sounds occur.

452

The demonstration in this paper of the widespread and robust nature of auditory

453

contrast adaptation at both physiological and perceptual levels highlights the importance of

454

this adaptive mechanism, and shows that a complex computation with strong implications for

455

behavior can be implemented in subcortical circuitry without the need of cortex.

Stimuli

Stimuli were presented with a Tucker-Davis Technologies (TDT) RX6 Multifunction processor at

482

∼200 kHz. Sounds were amplified by a TDT SA1 stereo amplifier and delivered via a modified

483

Avisoft ultrasonic electrostatic loudspeaker (Vifa) positioned approximately 1 mm from the ear

484

canal. The sound presentation system was calibrated to a flat (±1 dB) frequency-level response

485

between 500 and 64,000 Hz.

486

Stimuli consisted of dynamic random chords (DRCs) with individual chords having a

487

duration of 25 ms (including 5 ms on and off ramps) and comprising 25 superposed

488

frequencies logarithmically spaced between 1,000 and 64,000 Hz (1/4th octave intervals). The

489

tones of the DRC were played at sound levels that were randomly drawn from one of two

490

uniform distributions: 30 – 50 dB SPL (low contrast) or 20 – 60 dB SPL (high contrast). The

491

mean of the distribution was therefore constant, at 40 dB SPL. The logarithmic statistics of the

492

decibel scale have been found to better match the statistics of natural sounds39,66. The overall

493

sound level of the DRCs was calibrated to be 79-83 dB SPL. A DRC for any given trial was

494

played for either 40 seconds or 5 seconds (5-second trial duration in optogenetic

495

experiments), with inter-trial intervals of 2-10 seconds. DRCs have previously been used to

496

assess contrast adaptation in the auditory system of ferrets and mice6,11,23,42.

497

The overall sound level of high contrast stimuli was slightly (∼3 dB) higher than that of

498

the low contrast stimuli, due to the nonlinearity inherent in the logarithmic scale. An

499

additional experiment was therefore carried out in which the overall sound levels of DRCs was

500

matched in low and high contrast stimuli, at the expense of equality of sound levels of

501

individual tones in the DRCs, to control for possible effects of this small difference in overall

502

sound amplitude (see Supplementary Fig. 4).

503
504

In vivo extracellular recording

505

We carried out extracellular recordings using 32- or 64-channel silicon probes (NeuroNexus

506

Technologies Inc.), in a 4 x 8, 8 x 8, or 2 x 32 electrode configuration. Electrophysiological data

507

were acquired on a Tucker-Davis technologies (TDT) RZ2 BioAmp processor and collected and

508

saved using custom-written Matlab code (https://github.com/beniamino38/benware).

509

For experiments carried out under anesthesia, mice were anesthetized with an

510

intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg kg-1) and medetomidine (0.14 mg kg-1). We also

511

administered intraperitoneal injections of atropine (Atrocare, 1 mg kg-1) to prevent

512

bradycardia and reduce bronchial secretions, and dexamethasone (Dexadreson, 4 mg kg-1) to

513

prevent swelling of the brain. Prior to initial surgery, bupivacain was administered as an

514

analgesic under the scalp. The depth of anesthesia was monitored via the pedal reflex and

515

small additional doses of the ketamine/medetomidine mix were given subcutaneously

516

approximately every 15 minutes once the recordings started (∼1-1.5 hour post induction of

517

anesthesia). The dosage of individual top-ups depended on the depth of anesthesia at the

518

time, but corresponded to ∼50 mg/kg/h of ketamine and ∼0.07 mg/kg/h of medetomidine. All

519

recordings were performed in the right hemisphere. A silver reference wire was positioned in

520

visual cortex of the contralateral hemisphere, and a grounding wire was attached under the

521

skin on the neck. The head was fixed in position with a metal bar acutely attached with bone

522

cement to the skull over the left hemisphere. We then made 2-mm diameter circular

523

craniotomies above the IC (centered ∼5 mm posterior from bregma and ∼1 mm lateral from

524

midline), over the visual cortex for auditory thalamic recordings (centered ∼3 mm posterior

525

from bregma and ∼2.1 mm lateral from midline), and/or over the auditory cortex (centered

526

∼2.5 mm posterior from bregma and ∼4.5 mm lateral from midline). Following exposure of the

527

brain, the exposed dura mater was kept moist with saline. The silicon probe was then inserted

528

carefully into the recording site of interest.

529

The probe was considered to be located in the CNIC if frequency response areas

530

(FRAs) followed the dorso-ventral tonotopic gradient from low- to high frequencies that is

531

indicative of this nucleus67,68.

532

Prior to insertion into auditory thalamus, the probe was coated in DiI (Sigma-Aldrich)

533

for subsequent histological verification of the recording site. Recording sites were confirmed

534

as being located in auditory thalamus if multiunit activity responded to broadband noise and

535

was frequency tuned when the tip of the probe was ∼2.5-3.5 mm below the brain surface.

536

Auditory thalamic recordings were subsequently attributed to MGBv by histological

537

investigation of recording sites and by analysis of physiological responses. Based on an

538

immunohistochemical study by Lu et al.69 on the shape and size of subdivisions of the mouse

539

auditory thalamus, we allocated recording sites to the MGBv if they responded reliably to DRC

540

stimulation on electrode channels <500 μm from the lateral border of the MGB (see data

541

inclusion criteria).

542

Finally, A1 was identified by robust neuronal responses to broadband noise bursts,

543

and a caudo-rostral tonotopic axis. Cortical tonotopy was assessed in 4/10 mice by estimating

544

frequency response areas from responses to pure tones on 4 recording shanks spaced 200 µm

545

For awake recordings in the IC, we chronically implanted a recording chamber under

547

isoflurane (1.5-2% in O2) general anesthesia. The recording chamber consisted a metal cylinder

positioned over a craniotomy, with a lightly attached circular window in order to close the

549

recording chamber. We placed the recording chamber above the IC, together with a head bar

550

and a reference (silver wire) in the contralateral hemisphere. We then fixed the implant to the

551

skull using a dental adhesive resin cement (Super Bond C&B). Following full recovery, on a

552

subsequent day the mouse was head-fixed, the recording chamber was opened, and a sterile

553

recording probe was acutely inserted into the brain via the recording chamber.

Optogenetics

556

Injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) into auditory cortex and transgenic expression of ChR2

557

for selective control of inhibitory cortical neurons.

558

To transiently silence the activity of auditory cortical excitatory neurons, we employed either a

559

transgenic or a viral approach to express ChR2 in auditory cortical inhibitory neurons. VGAT-

560

ChR2-YFP mice express ChR2-YFP in GABAergic neurons throughout the adult brain and have

561

been used extensively to silence cortical areas in mice21,70–72. Viral injection surgeries were

562

performed under isoflurane (∼1.5 %) anesthesia, with the animal positioned in a stereotaxic

563

frame (Kopf instruments, USA). For viral transfection, we injected a floxed AAV5-DIO-ChR2-

564

eYFP (UNC gene therapy vector core) into auditory cortex of GAD2-IRES-cre mice. We injected

565

∼400 nl of virus, spread over 3 locations (spaced caudal-rostrally ∼400 μm apart) at 3 depths

566

(700, 500 and 300 μm from cortical surface), to ensure widespread expression in auditory

567

cortex (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Mice were used for electrophysiological recordings >4 weeks

568

post injection of virus. This ensured strong expression of ChR2-eYFP in the auditory cortex.

569
570

Optogenetic silencing of auditory cortex

571

For optogenetic silencing, we exposed the auditory cortex to blue (470 nm) LED light. This was

572

achieved by placement of a 200 μm (VGAT-ChR2-YFP experiments) or 1 mm optical fiber

573

(GAD2-cre + viral ChR2 experiments) immediately above the dura mater over the auditory

574

cortex to allow for blue light exposure to ChR2-expressing cells. For silencing of auditory

575

cortical activity during recordings in MGBv or CNIC, we stimulated with blue light at 40 Hz

576

frequency using sinusoidal waves or 15 ms pulses (10 ms gaps). When recording from auditory

577

cortex, we stimulated with blue light at 40 Hz using either sinusoidal waves or 15 ms pulses

578

(10 ms gaps) or constant light stimulation. Light power was ∼5-7 mW/mm2 at the tip of the

fiber. We found that light stimulation (40 Hz (sinusoid or pulsed) or constant light) effectively

580

silenced activity in auditory cortical neurons by driving inhibitory neurons for the duration of

581

the DRC stimulation (5 seconds) (Supplementary Fig. 5).

583

Human psychoacoustic experiments

584

Stimulus presentation and response collection were performed using PsychoPy 1.85.673,74.

585

Sounds were presented using a MOTU 828 mkII soundcard and delivered via Sennheiser

586

650HD headphones in a sound-attenuated chamber. The headphones were calibrated to a flat

587

(±1 dB) frequency-level response between 125 and 19,500 Hz.

588

Stimuli consisted of broadband noise bursts (100 ms) and dynamic random chords

589

(DRCs) comprising 25-ms duration chords with 29 frequencies logarithmically spaced between

590

150 and 19,200 Hz. DRCs were constructed with each tone of the DRC being played at levels

591

randomly assigned from a uniform distribution, ranging from 35 – 45 dB SPL (low contrast) or

592

25 – 55 dB SPL (high contrast) around a fixed mean amplitude of 40 dB SPL. The total sound

593

amplitude of the DRCs was measured to be 64-69 dB SPL. The stimulus for each trial was 1,950

594

ms long, consisting of 1,000 ms of DRC, followed by 100 ms broadband noise (reference: 60 dB

595

SPL), 250 ms of DRC, 100 ms of broadband noise (Target: 52 – 68 dB SPL), and ending with 500

596

ms of DRC. The overall sound level of high contrast stimuli was slightly higher relative to low

597

contrast stimuli (∼4 dB).

598

A control experiment was also carried out, where the overall sound levels of DRCs were

599

matched in low and high contrast stimuli, at the expense of the equality of levels of individual

600

tone levels in the DRCs, to determine whether the small difference in overall sound amplitude

601

between the high and low contrast stimuli could account for the JND change with contrast

Signal power and noise power

615

In order to identify units that were continuously responsive to DRC stimulation, we measured

616

the signal power (SP) and noise power (NP) of the neural responses76. For all results, unless

617

otherwise specified, we excluded units for which the ratio NP/SP > 60, indicating that these

618

units did not respond reliably to the DRCs on repeated trials.

619

Where relevant, we also tested how well a linear model described the data, using

620

cross-validation. We fitted spectro-temporal linear filters to 80-90 % of the data (training

621

dataset) and tested how well the model predicted the responses on the remaining data (test

622

dataset). Units were excluded if the correlation coefficient (Pearson’s r) between predicted

623

and real responses in the test dataset was < 0.1. These cross-validated prediction values are

624

referred to as ‘ccpred’, indicating cross-validated correlation between the predicted response

625

and the actual response.

626
627

Linear spectro-temporal receptive fields

628

Neuronal response rates were binned to produce peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) at the

629

same temporal resolution (25 ms) as the chords in the DRCs. To exclude transient onset

630

responses, we excluded the first 500 ms of each stimulus and response. Linear spectro-

631

temporal receptive fields (STRFs,

632

between the PSTHs and the sound levels (in dB SPL) of the tones in the DRCs. The STRFs were

633

constrained to be space-time separable, i.e.

634

likelihood77. The separability constraint was used because it reduces the number of

635

parameters that need to be estimated, and can give good STRFs when experimental data are

636

limited11. We found that this approach produced acceptable STRFs in all three areas that we

637

recorded from.

, and were fitted using maximum

638

For each unit, STRFs were first fitted to data from individual contrast conditions

639

separately, in order to assess contrast-dependent changes in spectro-temporal structure.

Subsequently, a single overall STRF was fitted to data from both contrasts, for estimation of

contrast-dependent output nonlinearities.

In order to estimate adaptation dynamics during changing contrast, we used a contrast-

671

In addition to the inclusion criteria used in the LN models for contrast adaptation

672

estimation (see below), we further restricted analysis of time constants to units whose activity

673

was better described by a contrast-dependent LN model than a single contrast-independent

674

model. Consequently, we estimated contrast adaptation time constants only from units that

675

underwent contrast adaptation.

676
677

Psychophysics

678

We fitted psychometric functions80 (https://github.com/wichmann-lab/psignifit) to the

679

probability of participants indicating that the target sound was louder than the reference

680

sound. The just noticeable difference (JND) was estimated as the dB difference between the

681

25% and 75% points on the psychometric curve. Because each listener’s sensitivity is inversely

682

proportional to their JND, we assume that the effective gain of the level discrimination process

683

is also inversely proportional to JND, and therefore % compensation can be calculated

684

similarly to the % compensation of contrast gain control above.

689

(Reference: 70 dB SPL, Target: 62-78dB SPL) embedded in low or high contrast DRCs (similar to

690

the stimuli used in the psychophysics experiment). This was achieved using response

691

predictions to these novel stimuli from the contrast-dependent LN model estimated from

692

recorded units in the CNIC, MGBv and A1. This was done for every unit included in the

693

analyses of physiological contrast adaptation (separately for each processing level/anesthetic

694

state). For each simulated trial, the simulated response to the broadband noise for each unit

695

was discretized according to a Poisson process, and the simulated onset responses across units

696

were added together. We then asked which noise stimulus elicited most spikes in the

697

simulated trial. If the reference noise elicited fewer spikes than the target noise stimulus, we

698

predicted a “louder” response (Fig. 7a). This process was repeated 500 times for each sound

699

level, in each contrast condition, for estimation of a predicted contrast-dependent

700

psychometric curve from simulated neuronal responses from units in the CNIC (awake or

701

anesthetized), MGBv or A1 (Fig. 7b). We estimated predicted psychometric curves 25 times for

702

each processing level/anesthetic state.
