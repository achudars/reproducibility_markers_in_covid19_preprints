Abstract

11

In many countries the public's main source of information about science and technology is the

12

mass media. Unfortunately, in recent years traditional journalism has experienced a collapse, and

13

science journalism has been a major casualty. One potential remedy is to encourage scientists to

14

write for news media about science. On these general news platforms, scientists' stories would

15

have to compete for attention with other news stories on hard (e.g. politics) and entertaining

16

(e.g. celebrity news) topics written by professional writers. Do they stand a chance?

17

This study aimed to quantitatively characterize audience interactions as an indicator of interest

18

in science news stories authored by early career scientists (henceforth ‘scientists’) trained to

19

function as science reporters, as compared to news items written by reporters and published in

20

the same news outlets.

21

To measure users' behavior, we collected data on the number of clicks, likes, comments and

22

average time spent on page. The sample was composed of 150 science items written by 50

23

scientists trained to contribute popular science stories in the Davidson Institute of Science

24

Education reporters’ program and published on two major Israeli news websites - Mako and Ynet

25

between July 2015 to January 2018. Each science item was paired with another item written by

26

the website’s organic reporter, and published on the same channel as the science story (e.g.,

27

tourism, health) and the same close time. Overall significant differences were not found in the

28

public's engagement with the different items. Although, on one website there was a significant

29

difference on two out of four engagement types, the second website did not have any difference,

30

e.g., people did not click, like or comment more on items written by organic reporters than on

31

the stories written by scientists. This creates an optimistic starting point for filling the science

32

news void by scientists as science reporters.

33

34

Rationale

35

The public draws primarily on the news media in general and internet news sites in particular

36

for information about science and technology (1–4). Globally, digital media have supplanted

37

traditional print and broadcast media, which has also affected science journalism (5,6). Today

38

many science-related news items are written by part-time reporters or reporters specialized in

39

other fields, who have less background and interest in covering science and technology (7–11).

40

This shortage of specialized personnel has created an opening for the publication of public

41

relations (PR)-generated content as journalistic content, which sometimes is even printed

42

verbatim (12–17), thus relinquishing the traditional democratic role of the press as a watchdog

43

that can signal misconduct, raise ethical questions and make critical observations.

44

A potential remedy for the declining numbers of professional science reporters was suggested

45

in which scientists address the public directly (18–21). The argument is that by taking part in the

46

public debate, scientists can contribute to influencing public discourse and policy (22). Visual

47

scientists could counter fake news and constitute a role model for younger publics (23–25).

48

Correlational studies have shown that scientists who engage with the public also perform

49

better academically (26,27). Web 2.0 provides scientists with platforms to directly disseminate

50

their scientific messages, and allows broad audiences to comment, react, and potentially

51

engage in dialogue with scientists (2,6,28,29). However, a closer examination of the audiences

52

who interact with science on social media and dedicated blogs shows that they remain largely

53

within the circles of academics and science enthusiasts (30,31). Hence, although social media

54

platforms can increase the public's exposure to science, the news media still wields

55

distributional power that could be harnessed by scientists as a platform to present their ideas

56

to wider audiences.

57

As noted in an editorial in ‘Nature’ in 2009: “An average citizen is unlikely to search the web for

58

the Higgs boson or the proteasome if he or she doesn't hear about it first on, say, a cable news

59

channel. And as mass media sheds its scientific expertise, science's mass-market presence will

60

become harder to maintain”(19). Currently, scientists seldom have direct access to general

61

news outlets. In addition, whereas scientists may be conversant in recent innovations and

62

scientific breakthroughs, they are not skilled in writing in an engaging fashion for the public,

63

particularly compared to media reporters.

64
65

Online news media adhere to different norms, agendas and styles than those found in the

66

academic writing that scientists are accustomed to producing. The online news media compete

67

for the public’s attention on a very tight schedule, that only allows a very short time for research,

68

fact checking and the writing needed for science reporting, thus forcing journalists to operate

69

under a heavy workload (15,32). While scientists write mostly for their peers to share, promote

70

and advance scientific research, reporters aim to inform, alert and encourage public debate on

71

topics that are thought to be on the public agenda or even purely entertaining (33–35). Whereas

72

scientists are trained to write to other experts using a traditional, well accepted format of the

73

IMRAD structure (Introduction, Methods, Results and Discussion) (20,36–38) and use scientific

74

jargon abundantly, journalists use different genres and vocabulary to address non-expert

75

audiences (20,36–40).

76

News sites are a competitive environment where scientists' stories compete for attention with

77

other news stories on hard (e.g. politics) and soft (e.g. celebrity news) topics (41) written by

78

professional writers. Do they stand a chance? This study was designed to quantitatively

79

characterize audience interactions with science news stories as an indicator of interest and

80

attention. These stories, authored by early career scientists (henceforth ‘scientists’) trained to

81

function as science reporters were compared to audience reactions to news items written by

82

reporters and published in the same news outlets.

84

Methodology

85
86

Research context
The Davidson Institute, – the Educational Arm of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel has

87

trained and employed graduate students, postdocs and research fellows in the sciences as writers

88

for its website since 2006. In early 2014, an academic conference panel about science and risk

89

communication in the online Israeli media1 (The 6th Israeli Science Communication Conference, (2015)

90

Davidson Institute of Science Education, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot (June 24-25)) hosted the editor

91

in chief of the Mako2 (www.mako.co.il) news website. As a result of that meeting the Davidson

92

Institute began collaborating with Mako by publishing science items written by scientists involved

93

on its website (42). Mako is the third most visited Israeli News site (23.2M entries in the last

94

quarter of 2016, (43)), which is owned and operated by ‘Keshet’, Israel's largest TV commercial

95

broadcasting company. It offers news content alongside streaming of TV shows. This type of

96

collaboration was then also extended to Ynet3(www.ynet.co.il), Israel’s most widely read news

97

website (52.5M entries in the last quarter of 2016, (43)). Ynet is operated by the ‘Yediot

98

Aharonot’ media group that publishes a daily tabloid newspaper in addition to the website and

99

caters mostly to young audiences (aged 18-34) surfing on mobile devices (43). Both news sites

100

provide freely available news content. The two websites do not employ a dedicated science

101

journalist, or require the reporters covering these topics to have background in science.

102

Currently, the Davidson reporters program employs about 50 graduate science students and

103

faculty who attend an annual brief training program led by the editorial team that focuses on

104

practical methods to improve popular writing (e.g., avoiding jargon and passive voice). The

105

writing process is mostly based on individual contacts between the scientists and the in-house

106

editor. The Davidson editorial team is composed of science editors, two content editors and an

107

editor in chief who is a former journalist. All the editors, except one content editor, have

108

academic science degrees. In cases where the content editors have reservations about the

109

content, they consult the scientist who authored the item before sending it for a final revision by

110

the editor in chief. The scientists have backgrounds in different fields and are at various stages of

111

their graduate degrees, although a few are already faculty members. There is no quota

112

demanded of each writer, but most scientists write between one to four 500-word items a

113

month. The topics span the science, technology, mathematics and engineering (STEM) fields, and

114

are chosen by the editorial team as a function of their newsworthiness and potential for public

115

interest (or based on topics suggested by the scientists). The scientists are not allowed to write

116

about their own research or research done in their labs, but are encouraged to write about local

117

Israeli research as part of the Davidson agenda. The scientists are employed on an hourly basis

118

to promote thorough inquiry (rather than being paid on the basis of number of words).

119

The Davidson Institute initially proposed this collaboration with the Mako and Ynet news site

120

editors to increase the quantity and quality of science content in the news. According to

121

Davidson staff, this collaboration enables scientists to share accurate, innovative scientific

122

information and make it part of public's everyday news consumption while the news sites

123

benefit from free high-quality science content. To date, this arrangement involves most of the

124

mainstream news sites operating in Hebrew in Israel. The news site editors are provided with

125

edited text, which they are not allowed to alter without Davidson’s permission, but they are

126

free to change the headlines.(For a critical analysis see also (42)). The name of the scientist

127

appears in the credit line, and is visible to the readers even before clicking the item to read, and

128

includes the person's title and affiliation to the Davidson Institute. The name of the writer, his

129

or her affiliation and status is also stated at the end of the item (e.g. “Yael Groper, Davidson

130

Institute of Science Education website reporter and a doctoral student in the Weizmann

131

Institute of Science”) alongside a link to the research article, if the item is based on one.

132

Researcher positioning: The first and third authors are university-based science communication

133

researchers not affiliated with either Davidson, Mako or Ynet. The second author is the head of

134

the science communication unit in the Davidson Institute and the initiator of the scientist

135

writing program and collaboration with the news sites.

138

Data source and sampling
Digital media and Web 2.0 allow access to accurate and updated data on consumers'

139

engagement with content (44,45), and sometimes even influence editorial decisions on topics

140

and item placement (46–48). Previous studies have pointed to the disparity between what

141

journalists think interests the public and readers' choices, mainly as regards the emphasis on

142

public affairs issues (49). Studies of public engagement with science content online have mainly

143

focused on views (clicks) and comments. They have analyzed engagement in terms of different

144

forms of interactivity offered by the online platforms (e.g. clicking, commenting, emailing, etc.)

145

that varies between topics and is time and context sensitive (44,50–54).

146

Although engagement data are used routinely in online newsroom decision making, little is

147

known about the characteristics of public interactions with online science items (55). This is due

148

primarily to the difficulty of obtaining data (e.g., number of clicks and average time on page)

149

which are kept confidential for commercial reasons.

150

As part of this research-practice collaboration, the researchers were given access to

151

confidential Google Analytics data, including clicks, time spent on the page, likes and comments

152

on Mako’s and Ynet’s websites. Due to the commercial sensitivity of the information, data

153

mining took place on several consecutive days at the news company offices at Mako. The

154

researcher was not allowed access to the information directly from Ynet but was sent the

155

requested data electronically. Data were kept on an encrypted drive with access restricted to

156

the first author alone. Due to the commercial nature of the data, the researchers were

157

committed not to disclose the raw data. Hence, here, only descriptive data such as averages

158

and standard deviation are presented.

159

The initial dataset was composed of all 296 news items written by scientists and published on the

160

two websites from July 2015 to January 2018 (Table 1). These were published mainly on the

161

Digital, Health, Animals, Culture and Traveling channels (ranked by the number of items in each

section).

Data were collected in March 2016 and January 2018. Dark grey shading indicates months when

166

scientists’ items were published on the Mako website (n = 114) and in light grey for Ynet (n =

167

182). The matching process yielded a total of 150 pairs of news items. Items that did not have a

168

corresponding item written by reporters (n=57) and items without access to the full

169

engagement data (n=89) were omitted.

Database of matching items
Each science item written by a scientist was paired with a corresponding news item written by a

173

professional reporter that was published on the same channel and within an average of 0.8 days

174

apart (about half of the items were published on the same day, and the rest no more than three

175

days before or after); see Figure 1 for an example of paired items. After this initial filtering by

176

channel and date of publication, we made efforts to pair similar formats (e.g. quizzes, video

177

articles, short/long items, etc.) when there was a choice of several organic items. In cases where

178

no corresponding item was found on the same channel and within the designated timeframe, the

179

reference item was excluded from the database (n = 57). Due to restricted access of the

180

researcher to the Ynet news site’s data and to broken links in both news sites, another 89 pairs

181

were omitted from the sample. Overall, the process yielded a total of 150 pairs of news items,

182

51% of the initial dataset. The final database is a representative sample of the full database

183

consisting of all channels and within the same time range as the full database.

184

On Mako website, 69% of items written by scientists were published on the Health channel,

185

alongside site reporters’ items on new treatments and diet suggestions (e.g. “Five delicious

186

recipes for a healthy meal”, 21/8/2017). Another 12% of the scientists’ generated items were

187

published on the Holiday/Travel channel and paired with items on new popular vacation resorts,

188

celebrities’ vacations and other travel information (e.g. “Where do the residents of the “Big

189

Brother” reality show love to go on vacation?”, 1/1/2016). An additional 7% were published on

190

the HIX magazine devoted to “Scientific discoveries, interesting phenomena, funny inventions,

191

exciting news and other events from the world”, and on the Culture channel.

192

On Ynet website, the vast majority of items (97%) were published on the Digital channel,

193

alongside items such as “After a mouse and a gorilla: was a shark photographed on Mars?”

194

(27/3/2016). The remaining 3% were published on the Animals, Health and World channels.

195

While the scientists’ items were always about a scientific study, or science related issues, the

196

paired organic items were more diverse in terms of topics. Although the paired items had a

197

similar topic, since they were published on the same channel, an organic item on the Digital

198

channel on Ynet for example, could be a set of pictures showing readers what the Earth looks like

199

at night, without any scientific or research related content. In four rare occasions both paired

200

items covered the same exact topic side by side (one on Mako and 3 on Ynet, see Table 2 for item

201

headlines). About half of the pairs in the database were both scientist and organic reporter items,

202

on a scientific or research related topic. Since we could not pool the paired items from the two

203

websites, there are too few items from each site to calculate statistical significance.

204

[Insert Figure 1 about here]

206

The item on the left, written by a scientist is titled “How can we have Wi-Fi on an airplane? And

how does it work?“(written by Carmel Shor), whereas the item on the right was written by the

208

website’s reporter and was titled “In the near future: airplane toilets that clean themselves“

209

(written by the vacation channel editorial). Both items were published on the same day and on

210

the same website channel (“Vacation”).

Four rare occasions in which an item on the same topic was published written by the website’s

214

organic reporter and also by a scientist from the reporters’ program. Items addressed the same

215

topics and were published more or less at the same time. These items differed in terms of the

216

frames and angles the writers chose to take. Public engagement was higher with the items

217

written by reporters on the first and last items, whereas the opposite was found for the two

218

others.

219

221

Data analysis and engagement types
Four quantitative parameters were chosen as indicators of audience engagement based on

222

previous studies (43–45,51–55) and the available data. The data used in this study relied solely

223

on absolute numbers for each parameter. Other relevant variables, such as an item’s location

224

on the website, length of time visible on the channel, length of the item etc., were not

225

available. Clicks (views) were used as an indicator of interest in reading the item based on the

226

headline. When presented on the entry page, a secondary sub-headline was visible to readers

227

as well. The number of clicks ranged widely from a low of 651 to a high of 269,802 clicks on the

228

most popular item “How does Bitcoin work?” (Ynet, Dec. 2017) (for average clicks per site see

229

Table 3).

230

Average Time on page (reported in seconds) represents the time devoted by readers to each

231

item. This indicator can provide some indications as to whether the item was read in full. The

232

average time spent on page ranged from 13 seconds to 1,702 seconds for the item “The God

233

Pan and nude festivals in the Golan heights 1900 years ago” written by the website’s reporter

234

(Mako, June 2016) (for averages per site see Table 3).

235

Likes can represent readers' favorable opinion of the item or the event it describes. It demands

236

a higher engagement level on the part of the reader since by clicking ‘Like’ (in the Mako

237

website, the ‘Like’ option is marked as ‘Recommend’), the item is published on the reader's wall

238

on Facebook, thus exposing it publicly. At the time of data collection Facebook was the only

239

social media platform with an available interface with the two news sites. Likes ranged from

240

zero to 3,600 for the most popular item “An Earth-like planet was discovered 4 light years

241

away” (Ynet, August 2016) (for averages per site see Table 3).

242

Comments require more time and effort relative to 'Likes'. Comments could be one word long

243

to several paragraphs long, and may be off topic. Any internet user can post a comment

244

anonymously on these two websites. The number of comments ranged from no comments at

245

all to 621 comments on the most popular item “The physics of building pyramids” (Ynet, April

246

2017) (for averages per site see Table 3).

Statistical analysis

266

Each engagement type was assessed for normal distribution. A paired sample t-test was used

267

for normally distributing parameters, such as average time on page on both websites and

268

comments on Mako and Likes on Ynet. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for parameters

269

that were not normally distributed, such as Clicks on both websites and Likes on Mako and

270

comments on Ynet (α=0.05). In order to verify that the time difference between the two

271

sampling cycles did not affect the data, a one-way ANOVA was run on the first and last two

272

months and the median date of the data collection cycles for each parameter. No significant

273

difference was found. Therefore, the results of the statistical analyses are presented for the

Results

276

In this study we are in the unique position where non-significant differences between groups

277

are highly informative for the goals of the study. Figure 2 presents the comparison of all

278

engagement types on both websites.

279

In the case of the Mako website no significant differences were found between items written

280

by scientists and Mako's organic reporters for average time on page and 'Likes', based on 92

281

and 85 pairs of items, respectively (Table 3). On the other hand, a Wilcoxon signed-ranks test

282

showed a statistically significant difference in the number of Clicks (views) between items

283

written by scientists and organic reporters (n=89, Z = -2.862, p = 0.004) and a paired sample t-

284

test showed a statistically significant difference in the number of Comments (n= 89, p<0.05)

285

with more public engagement in response to Mako’s’ organic reporters on both parameters. To

286

conclude Mako’s results, there was no difference in the time devoted to reading the items or

287

liking them (hitting the ‘Like’ button) but there was a clear preference to click items that were

288

not written by scientists and were not necessarily about science.

289

While Mako's results were mixed, on the Ynet news site an analysis of the data retrieved on the

290

paired items showed no significant differences between items written by scientists and organic

291

reporters on any of the parameters (Table 3). For example, the average length of time on page

292

for items written by organic reporters was 17:26 minutes, whereas the time on page for an

293

item written by scientists had a viewing duration of 17:32 minutes, on average, as shown in

294

Figure 1. Thus, based on our data, the public’s interactions with science news written by

295

scientists were not significantly different from other news items written by reporters on Ynet’s

296

news site.

Discussion

307

Americans’ and Israelis’ primary information source about science and technology is the online

308

news medium (4,56), which is impacting public attitudes, perceptions and even behavior (1,57–

309

61). News media has the potential to promote scientific understanding, especially if sufficient

310

explanations of the science are provided and a narrative is used for its presentation (57).

311

Hence, accurate, accessible and relevant science stories in the news media are important

312

factors in a healthy science communication environment. Unfortunately, given the current

313

collapse of traditional journalism worldwide, science journalism has become a major casualty,

314

thus hindering its ability to provide quality science coverage. For example, between 2013 and

315

2015, the number of science reporters in the Israeli news media decreased from 9 to only

316

three, a drop that continues to this day (62). The results of this study suggest that filling the

317

void created by the firing of titular science reporters by scientists who write for the media may

318

be a viable solution resulting in a higher frequency of scientific content in the news media

319

which is also attractive to readers.

320

This study examined whether readers reacted differently to science news items written by

321

scientists as compared to news items written by organic reporters published on the same

322

online news media sites. Generally speaking, based on our findings, the answer is no: audiences

323

interacted similarly with both. This finding justifies the time and effort invested by the scientists

324

and the Davidson science communication team to write attractive science stories, and justifies

325

the resources provided by the news sites. Apparently if websites publish it, audiences will

326

consume it. The website gains highly credible , reliable, science items free of charge and the

327

scientists get a spot in a high exposure platform (63).

328

These optimistic results raise a normative question about the impact of these collaborations on

329

science journalism and science communication. In a democratic society the media do not only

330

serve as an information conduit for the public (64), but also as platform to critique the

331

authorities as regards misconduct, corruption or misuse of public resources (17,64). Scientists

332

communicating science while working as scientists can fill the informing and popularizing void,

333

but cannot take on the watchdog role since they cannot be expected to provide a critical

334

independent outsider approach of journalists. Providing ready-made scientific content to news

335

outlets without charge may perpetuate the media’s reliance on free, external content, and

336

hence contribute to the weakening position of science journalists. It could be argued that

337

accustoming the media to getting ready-made content without journalistic scrutiny may in fact

338

be advancing ‘churnalism’- a practice in which pre-packaged stories provided by news agencies

339

and press releases are adapted for publication instead of reported news, and therefore

340

potentially posing a danger to the legitimacy of science journalism and undermining its

341

credibility (12,13,65).

342

While these are important caveats, it is crucial to note that although the Israeli online news

343

media form one of the most accessible sources of information about science and technology

344

related topics, they are also ranked as mostly unreliable (an average of 5.6 on a 10-point scale).

345

University scientists, on the other hand, are seen as the most reliable source of information (an

346

average of 7.6 on a 10-point scale), but inaccessible (only 19% of the survey respondents
18

347

mentioned them as their sources of information about science and technology) (66). The model

348

described here integrates the strengths of each source; i.e., exposure and accessibility on online

349

media and the reliability and expertise of university scientists.

350
351

The results from the two sites were mixed. No significant differences were found between

352

scientists’ and reporters’ items on Ynet, but mixed findings were found on Mako, where

353

reporters’ items had more views and comments, but likes and time on page did not differ. The

354

differences between the results from the two news sites may be attributed to their

355

characteristics: Mako is owned by ‘Keshet’, Israel's largest commercial TV broadcasting

356

company and shares the same website (www.mako.co.il) with television content on demand.

357

Ynet is operated by the ‘Yediot Aharonot’ media group that also publishes a daily newspaper.

358

This may suggest differences in the expectations and motivations of audiences reading the two

359

websites. Although both websites offer news coverage on an array of topics, most visitors to

360

the Mako website expect more entertaining options than when accessing Ynet for more hard

361

news content. Given these differences in press orientation, our assumption is that more Mako

362

readers accessed the website with light entertainment in mind, rather than an interest in

363

finding out about recent scientific or technological developments. Another explanation is

364

related to the structure of the websites. While Ynet has a designated channel for science in

365

which the majority of the items in the database were published (97% of the items on Ynet, 39%

366

of the total database), Mako does not publish this type of channel, and all the items from the

367

database were published in the different channels the website offers its audience.

368

This study was enabled by a Research-Practice-Partnership (RPP). This unique position allowed

369

the researchers access to data that are usually unavailable for commercial reasons, while

370

providing practitioners with an evidence-based evaluation of their science communication efforts

371

and the public’s interaction with their products. Such RPPs have immense potential for improving

372

practice and tapping experience-based questions and real-life data. More of these collaborations

373

will increase reliance on behavioral data that can complement self-report research instruments.

374

Research Limitations. One of the key limitations of this study was its reliance on the Google

375

Analytics data mining system. The algorithm used to collect data by Google is unknown, and so

376

are the basic assumptions underlying its data mining algorithm. Hence this study relied solely on

377

absolute data for the number of clicks (views), Likes, etc. We did not use other information

378

provided by Google Analytics such as age and gender since these constitute inferable data that

379

rely on Google's search and deduction algorithm.

380

Our data show a significant difference in average time spent on page between the two

381

websites. This could also be a result of the settings, preferences and specifications each news

382

company used to configure the data collection. These were not disclosed either. This problem

383

was mitigated by not comparing public engagement between the two websites, only between

384

writers on the same website.

385
386

Finally, it is important to emphasize that this study focused on the quantity and type of audience

387

interactions with two types of coverage. The quality of the coverage and user generated content

388

was not addressed. For example, comments might only contain a title with no additional text, or

20

389

be several paragraphs long. Comments could be positive or critical (e.g., ‘interesting but it was

390

hard to understand’) or off topic. The quality of these aspects might defer between the types of

391

coverage and their associated reader comments.

392

Conclusion

393

This study examined the public's interactions with scientists’ popular writing, thus shedding

394

light on online public engagement with science outside of an experimental setting. The results

395

paint a positive picture where in most cases no differences were found between the ways

396

audiences responded to scientific reports written by scientists-as-science-reporters, and stories

397

written by news site reporters. This model may thus provide a practical solution for filling the

398

science journalism void on struggling news media.
