Abstract

21

Adaptive traits that enable organisms to conquer novel niches and experience subsequent

22

diversification are ecologically and evolutionarily important. The larvae of Pieris butterflies

23

express nitrile-specifier proteins (NSPs), a key innovation for overcoming the glucosinolate (GLS)-

24

myrosinase-based defense system of their Brassicales host-plants. NSPs are a member of the NSP-

25

like gene family, which includes the major allergen (MA) protein, a paralog of NSP with a GLS-

26

disarming function, and a single domain major allergen (SDMA) protein, whose function is

27

unknown. The arms-race between a highly variable host-plant defense system and members of the

28

NSP-like gene family is suggested to mediate diversification in both Pierid butterflies and

29

Brassicales plants. Here, we combined feeding experiments using 25 Brassicaceae plants and five

30

Pieris species with larval transcriptome data to investigate the evolutionary forces acting on NSP-

31

like gene family members associated with patterns of host-plant usage. Although we observed

32

significantly elevated nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution ratios in NSPs, no such pattern

33

was observed in MAs or SDMAs. Furthermore, we found a signature of positive selection of NSP

34

at a phylogenetic branch which reflects different host-plant preferences. Our data indicate that

35

NSPs have evolved in response to shifting preferences for host plants among five Pieris butterflies,

36

whereas MAs and SDMAs appear to have more conserved functions. Our results show that the

37

evolution and functional differentiation of key genes used in host-plant adaptation play a crucial

38

role in the chemical arms-race between Pieris butterflies and their Brassicales host-plants.

Introduction

41

Key innovations that enable organisms to acquire novel niches and experience

42

subsequent radiation are ecologically and evolutionarily important (Bond & Opell, 1988; Hunter,

43

1998). In plant-herbivore interactions, a number of key innovations were identified that enabled

44

herbivores to overcome specific plant defense mechanisms and colonize novel host-plants

45

(Berenbaum, Favret, & Schuler, 1996; Janz, 2011; Wheat et al., 2007). Pieris butterfly larvae use

46

plants containing glucosinolate (GLSs) as hosts, redirecting toxic breakdown products to less toxic

47

metabolites using gut-expressed nitrile-specifier proteins (NSPs) (Wittstock et al., 2004). NSPs are

48

known to be a key innovation of Pieris butterflies: the acquisition of NSPs enabled Pieris to

49

colonize GLS-containing Brassicales followed by higher speciation rates compared to those of

50

sister butterfly clades (Edger et al., 2015; Fischer, Wheat, Heckel, & Vogel, 2008; Heidel-Fischer,

51

Vogel, Heckel, & Wheat, 2010; Wheat et al., 2007).

52

NSPs are members of the small NSP-like gene family, which includes major allergen

53

(MA) proteins and single domain major allergen (SDMA) proteins (Fischer et al., 2008). The

54

functions of MAs and SDMAs are mostly unclear, however, the structures of MAs and NSPs are

55

known to be similar: three replicated domains originated from SDMAs (Fischer et al., 2008). In

56

addition, although SDMAs are generally expressed in the guts of Lepidopteran larvae (Randall,

57

Perera, London, & Mueller, 2013), NSP and MA are only found in Pierid butterflies feeding on

58

Brassicales (Fischer et al., 2008). These findings suggest that in Pieris, MAs, as in NSPs, have a

59

function related to disarming GLSs. The ability of MAs to redirect GLS hydrolysis was recently

60

documented in one Brassicales-feeding Pierid, Anthocharis cardamines, which seems to have MA

61

genes only, that is, it lacks NSPs (Edger et al., 2015). Thus, although the function of MAs in

62

Pieridae is largely unknown, especially in those species which have NSPs and MAs, MAs also

63

appear to be ecologically important for overcoming the host plant’s GLS-based defense system.

64

Previous studies indicated that the co-evolutionary diversification of Brassicales plants

65

and Pierid butterflies was mediated by the chemical arms-race between the glucosinolate-

66

myrosinase defense system and members of the NSP-like gene family (Edger et al., 2015). Past

67

increases of GLS complexity in Brassicales were followed by the evolution in Pierid butterflies of

68

NSP-like gene family members, suggesting that members of the NSP-like gene family would

69

potentially be under strong selection pressure, were Pieridae butterflies to expand or shift their host

70

plants. Such a scenario is supported by recent findings of signatures of positive selection in partial

71

NSP sequences of a pair of Pieris butterflies in comparison with the signatures of 70 randomly

72

selected genes (Heidel-Fischer et al., 2010). However, the evolutionary forces acting on all NSP-

73

like gene family members, especially when considering the associated host plant spectrum, remains

74

unknown.

75

Here, we focus on five Japanese butterfly species (Pieris napi, P. melete, P. rapae, P.

76

brassicae and P. canidia) in the genus Pieris, which has both NSP and MA genes, and feed on

77

Brassicaceae plants with the highest GLS diversity among the Brassicales. The five Pieris species

78

have different host spectra according to field observations (Fig. 1), with P. napi and P. melete

79

frequently using wild Brassicaceae plants (such as Arabis or Arabidopsis), whereas P. rapae and P.

80

brassicae tend to feed on Brassicaceae crops and are known as major pests (Benson, Pasquale, Van

81

Driesche, & Elkinton, 2003; Kitahara, 2016; Ohsaki & Sato, 1994; Ueno, 1997). In contrast, in

82

Japan, P. canidia can be found only in the southern islands (Yonaguni Island, Okinawa), relying on

83

the limited number of host plants, such as Cardamine or Lepidium, in their habitat range.

84

With larval transcriptome (RNA-seq) data from the five Pieris species, we analyzed the

85

divergence in amino acid sequences based on nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous substitution

86

(dS) rates to investigate signatures of selection on members of the NSP-like gene family compared

87

with signatures on other larval-expressed orthologs. We also conducted comprehensive feeding

88

experiments with 25 Brassicaceae plants to acquire patterns of host utilization in Pieris species to

89

test if shifts in these patterns can be correlated with the evolution of NSP-like gene family members

90

in Pieris butterflies. Additionally, we searched for functional gene groups with signatures of

91

selection among the five Pieris species based on gene ontology (GO) and dN/dS analyses to

92

identify potential genes related to host-plant detoxification which might be under positive or

93

negative selection. By combining these approaches, we were able to investigate signatures of

94

selection on ecologically important NSP-like gene family members and detoxification-related

95

genes associated with host-plant utilization patterns in Pieris larvae (Fig. 2). Results provide

96

important insights into the evolution of adaptive key innovations in Pieris butterflies.

Materials and Methods

100

Feeding experiments

101

We used four Pieris butterfly species for the feeding assay, leaving out P. canidia. We collected 7–

102

10 female butterflies of three Pieris butterfly species (P. napi, P. melete, P. rapae) from wild

103

populations in Chiba and Hokkaido, Japan. Most wild-caught female butterflies were already

104

fertilized. We released the female butterflies into cages containing cabbage (Brassica oleracea var.

105

capitata) or Cardamine leucantha under high-intensity light conditions, and waited for eggs to be

106

laid. For P. brassicae, final-instar larvae were caught in the wild (Hokkaido, Japan), fed on cabbage

107

and reared to the adult stage. After eclosion, 10 female butterflies were hand paired with males and

108

eggs were collected as they were from the other species. Eggs of the four Pieris butterfly species

109

were incubated at 25°C until they hatched.

110

For experimental plants, we collected seeds of 25 Brassicaceae plant species, covering a

111

phylogenetically broad range (Table S1) (Beilstein, Al-Shehbaz, Mathews, & Kellogg, 2008;

112

Couvreur et al., 2010; Franzke, Lysak, Al-Shehbaz, Koch, & Mummenhoff, 2011). We grew the

113

plants in the greenhouse at 25°C, with 60% relative humidity and L16:D8. Plants were watered and

114

fertilized every week with a 2000× diluted solution of Hyponex (N:P:K = 6:10:5; Hyponex, Osaka,

115

Japan). After two months of cultivation, plants were used for the feeding experiments.

116

Neonate larvae were collected within 12 hours after they hatched for the feeding

117

experiment. We transferred three neonate larvae for each plant using a soft-haired brush and

118

replicated this twice for each plant species (n = 6). To minimize changes in the condition of the

119

experimental plants, experimental trials were carried out within 5 days for all four Pieris species.

120

We conducted feeding experiments under the same temperature and light conditions used for plant

growth. We measured the weight of each larva individually (within 0.1 mg) after 120 hours of

122

feeding and used the average weight of larval individuals from each plant species as an index of

123

the performance of each Pieris butterfly species. We set the weight of dead larvae at 0.

124

Larval weights were standardized as z-scores to enable comparison between species. We

125

calculated the mean scores of each plant treatment and used these for the comparative analysis. We

126

conducted Pearson’s correlation test and hierarchical clustering analysis to assess differences in

127

larval performances among the four Pieris species. The possible clustering was evaluated with the

128

gap statistics (Tibshirani, Walther, & Hastie, 2001). All of these analyses were performed on R

129

studio ver. 1.1.453 (RStudioTeam, 2016).

131

RNA sequencing

132

From four Pieris butterfly species (P. napi, P. melete, P. rapae, P. brassicae), excluding P. canidia,

133

we collected larvae that we used for the feeding experiments for transcriptome analysis (Figs. 1,

134

2). We used larvae that fed on Arabidopsis kamchatica and Cardamine occulta as representatives.

135

The larvae were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until RNA extraction. We

136

selected a single representative larva for each of the four Pieris and plant species combinations,

137

and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). RNA sample quantity and quality

138

were checked by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Illumina libraries of individual larva were prepared by

139

Sure Select Strand-Specific RNA Library Preparation Kit for Illumina Multiplexed Sequencing,

140

and RNA sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 1500 Genome Analyzer platform using

141

a 2 x 100bp paired-end approach. For P. canidia, we collected larvae directly from wild Lepidium

142

virginicum on Yonaguni Island, Okinawa, Japan. The collected larvae were dissected, and gut

143

tissues were stored at -80 °C in solution until RNA extraction. Five larvae were randomly selected,

144

and RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). P. canidia RNA concentrations were

145

quantified on a Qubit 2 Fluorometer (Invitrogen), and a fraction of the RNA from each of the five

146

larvae was pooled as a single sample for RNA-seq. Paired-end (2×150 bp) sequencing was

147

performed by the Max Planck Genome Center Cologne on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 Genome

SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20 MINLEN:40) (Bolger, Lohse, & Usadel, 2014). The quality of reads was

154

checked by FastQC. Pooled reads were de novo assembled by Trinity ver. 2.0.6 (Grabherr et al.,

155

2011). We used TransDecoder (http://transdecoder.github.io/) to predict open reading frames

156

(ORFs) from the assembled contigs and subsequently looked for reciprocal best hits (RBHs) using

157

BLAST alignment methods to analyze amino acid sequences (longer than 100 amino acids)

158

predicted by TransDecoder (Camacho et al., 2009; Cock, Chilton, Grüning, Johnson, & Soranzo,

159

2015). We used RBH BLAST software with default settings on all possible species pairs (10 pairs)

160

and subsequently extracted P. rapae orthologs from this RBH result and ran blastp on the amino

161

acid sequences against a P. rapae protein database to confirm the ORF prediction from

162

TransDecoder. Orthologs in the RBH result without any BLAST hits to the P. rapae protein

163

database were removed since these amino acid sequences may have resulted from wrong ORF

164

predictions by TransDecoder. We used PRANK to conduct codon-based alignment of each ortholog

set acquired from the RBH result (Loytynoja & Goldman, 2005).

Phylogenetic tree construction

168

We reconstructed a phylogeny of the five Pieris species using the transcriptome data by

169

concatenating all aligned ortholog nucleotide sequences into one sequence for each species,

170

generating an Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree by IQ-tree (Nguyen, Schmidt, Von

171

Haeseler, & Minh, 2015) after removing gaps with TrimAl (2063074 bp remaining) (Capella-

172

Gutiérrez, Silla-Martínez, & Gabaldón, 2009). We used the GTR + gamma substitution model and

173

set ultrafast bootstrap approximation iterations as 1000, using -bnni options to construct a

174

phylogeny of the five Pieris species (Hoang, Chernomor, Von Haeseler, Minh, & Vinh, 2018).

175
176

Analysis of NSP-like gene family members

177

We used each aligned orthologous gene for calculating species pairwise dN/dS ratios using PAML

178

4.8 (Yang, 2007). We used runmode = -2 and NSsites = 0 option in codeml from PAML and

179

calculated pairwise dN/dS ratios based on the Nei & Gojobori method (Nei & Gojobori, 1986). We

180

averaged acquired species pairwise dN/dS ratios for each ortholog to infer putative positive

181

selection among the genus. The dN/dS values of NSP-like gene family members were compared

182

with the entire dN/dS distributions of all ortholog sets in species pairwise associations and also in

183

an averaged dN/dS scale among Pieris.

184

We used the branch-site model to identify cases of positive selection on NSP-like gene

185

family members in a specific branch. We prepared molecular phylogeny of NSP gene family

186

members by RAxML (Stamatakis, 2014) and tested all branches using codeml model 2 with

187

NSsites = 2 option and ran an alternative model; varied dN/dS ratios across sites as well as lineages

188

were allowed (fixed_omega = 0), and null model; fixed dN/dS (fixed_omega = 1). We conducted

189

a likelihood ratio test (LRT) with the chi-square distribution to evaluate significant differences

190

between the alternative and null models. We also used adaptive Branch-Site Random Effects

191

Likelihood (aBSREL) analysis for the NSP-like gene members among the five Pieris species and

192

tested all branches to identify the signatures of positive selection (Smith et al., 2015). Acquired P

193

values were corrected with false discovery rates (FDRs) in each analysis. Signs of positive selection

194

on each site were identified by the Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis (0.90 cut offs). The

195

aBSREL analyses were performed in HyPhy implemented in the datamonkey web server

196

(Kosakovsky Pond, Frost, & Muse, 2005; Weaver et al., 2018).

197
198

GO annotation and evolutionary tests

199

We used P. rapae contigs from the RBH result for GO annotation and ran these genes against the

200

NCBI non-redundant protein sequence database in Galaxy (Blastx, e-value = 10e-4). We

201

subsequently used the Blast2GO platform to load the resulting Blast-xml file and to conduct

202

mapping and annotation steps based on the BLAST result for acquiring GO annotations for each

203

contig (Götz et al., 2008). To test significantly elevated or decreased dN/dS ratios among genes

204

associated with specific GO terms, we selected those that contained at least 20 orthologs and tested

205

their dN/dS distributions with those of all the observed orthologs (background) using a Wilcoxon

206

test. All statistical analyses were performed in R studio ver. 1.1.453 and P values acquired were

207

adjusted by FDR (RStudioTeam, 2016).

Performance of four Pieris butterflies on 25 Brassicaceae plants.

211

We obtained larval weights for four Pieris butterfly species (Pieris napi, P. melete, P. rapae and P.

212

brassicae) feeding on 25 different Brassicaceae plant species. Analysis showed that the larval

213

performances of the four Pieris species could be clustered into two groups: the P. napi-P. melete

214

group and the P. rapae-P. brassicae group. The gap statistics for the given number of clusters were

215

as follows: Gap1 =0.080, Gap2 = 0.135, Gap3 = 0.119, Gap4 = 0.123 (Fig. 3). For instance, we

216

observed that P. napi and P. melete performed better on Arabis hirsuta or Turritis glabra, whereas

217

P. rapae and P. brassicae did better on Thlaspi arvense than the other two species (Fig. 3). In

218

addition to this trend, the larvae of four Pieris butterfly species also performed similarly. We

219

observed that all four Pieris species performed better on Cardamine occulta than on the other plant

220

species tested and did not perform well on Erysimum cheiranthoides or Berteroa incana (Fig. 3).

221
222

RNA-seq, reciprocal best hit (RBH) BLAST analysis of Pieris butterflies

223

We obtained 32-40 million Illumina 100 bp pair-end reads for the four species (P. napi, P. melete,

224

P. rapae and P. brassicae) and 64 million Illumina 150 bp pair-end reads for P. canidia. De novo

225

transcriptome assemblies using Trinity resulted in 64,279; 62,054; 59,327; 53,004; and 149,481

226

contigs, and in N50 values of 2,048 bp; 2,132 bp; 2,060 bp; 2,594; and 2,075 bp for P. napi, P.

227

melete, P. rapae P. brassicae, and P. canidia respectively. Using RBH BLAST on the five Pieris

228

species, we obtained transcriptome data resulted in 2723 ortholog sets.

231

We calculated dN/dS ratios for all ortholog sets in the 10 Pieris species pairs used with PAML 4.8

232

(Yang, 2007) and averaged these values. The complete distribution of averaged dN/dS values is

233

shown in Figure 4 (mean dN/dS = 0.10486). The averaged dN/dS values of NSP-like gene family

234

members are as follows: dN/dSNSP = 0.324, dN/dSMA = 0.188 and dN/dSSDMA = 0.125. The dN/dS

235

value of NSP is located in the top 2.72% of the entire dN/dS distribution, whereas MA and SDMA

236

values are lower (MA 11.4%, SDMA 23.4%). We also found a similar pattern between species,

237

where NSPs were in the top 5% in 5 pairs out of 10 (napi – rapae, napi – canidia, melete – rapae,

238

melete – canidia, rapae – canidia) and in the top 5.5% in two pairs (napi – brassicae, melete –

239

brassicae); MAs and SDMAs were not ranked in the top 5 % (Fig. 5). In most cases, NSPs had the

240

highest value, MAs had higher dN/dS value compared to SDMAs, and the order of dN/dS values

241

of NSP-like gene family members was NSP > MA > SDMA in 8 out of 10 species pairs (Fig. 5).

242
243

Signature of clade-specific positive selections on NSP associated with larval performance

244

We reconstructed Japanese Pieris phylogeny using the transcriptome data by concatenating all

245

RBH ortholog sets. The obtained results showed a highly supported P. napi–P. melete clade, and P.

246

rapae–P. canidia clade (Fig. 5). We performed the branch-site model approach by codeml and

247

found a signal of positive selection on NSPs at the P. napi–P. melete branch (FDR adjusted P =

248

0.0178, LRT), however, we found no sign of positive selection at other branches or in MA or SDMA

249

genes (Fig. 5, Table 1). The BEB analysis suggested that two codon sites had signs of positive

250

selection in NSPs in this branch (Table 1, posterior probability > 0.9). These sites were located in

251

second and third domains of NSPs (position 421 and 503 in the amino acid sequence) and close to

252

the positively selected sites identified in previous work (positions 379 and 523) (Heidel-Fischer et

253

GO terms with elevated dN/dS ratios among five Pieris butterflies

258

After GO annotations of all P. rapae RBH contigs, we obtained 1457 GO terms in our datasets.

259

These included 680 related to biological process, 540 to molecular function, and 237 to cellular

260

component GO terms. We conducted the Wilcoxon test for the GO terms, which have more than

261

20 assigned orthologs, and the result revealed that one biological process -- “proteolysis” -- and

262

two processes associated with molecular function -- “hydrolase activity” and “serine-type

263

endopeptidase activity” -- had significantly elevated dN/dS values when compared to the entire

264

dN/dS distribution of all contigs (Fig. 6, Table 3). This test also showed that 13 GO terms had

265

significantly lower dN/dS values in the three categories (Table 3). These lower dN/dS GO terms

266

included “regulation of transcription, DNA-templated,” “ribosome biogenesis,” and “translation”

267

in biological process; “ATP binding,” “structural constituent of ribosome,” “GTP binding,”

268

“calcium ion binding,” “DNA-binding transcription factor activity” and “sequence-specific DNA

269

binding” in molecular functions; and “nucleus,” “cytoplasm,” “ribosome” and “transcription factor

270

complex” in the category of GO cellular components.

Discussions

274

Focusing on five Japanese Pieris butterflies, we tested host-plant performance and investigated

275

signatures of selection on NSP-like genes, which are a key innovation of these butterflies to

276

overcome the GLS defense system of their Brassicales host plants (Edger et al., 2015; Wheat et al.,

277

2007). We acquired RBH ortholog sets expressed in larvae of the five Pieris species based on

278

transcriptome data and compared the calculated dN/dS ratios of each ortholog in order to

279

investigate the effect of evolutionary forces on NSP-like gene family members. We also combined

280

ecological approaches for acquiring performance data on larvae of Pieris species by conducting

281

comprehensive feeding experiment using 25 Brassicaceae plant species. These approaches yielded

282

four major findings. First, we observed that Pieris species showed clade-specific differences in

283

larval host performance. Second, we observed that NSP genes had significantly elevated dN/dS

284

ratios compared to other genes in the five Pieris species, including members of the same gene

285

family, MAs and SDMAs. Third, evidence of positive selection on NSPs was observed at a

286

phylogenetic branch which showed differences in larval performance according to our feeding

287

assays. Last, we observed significantly elevated dN/dS ratios in GO terms which are associated

288

with potential detoxification-related genes in Pieris larvae.

289
290

According to our feeding experiments with four Japanese Pieris species (P. napi, melete,

291

rapae and brassicae) and 25 Brassicaceae plant species, P. napi and P. melete larvae performed

292

similarly, as did P. rapae and P. brassicae larvae (Fig. 3). Observations in the field suggest that

293

these four Pieris species have slightly different host preferences: P. napi and P. melete feed on wild

294

and montane Brassicaceae plants, such as Arabis or Turritis, and P. rapae and brassicae use

295

Brassicaceae crops more often than the other two species (Fig. 1) (Harvey, Poelman, & Gols, 2010;

296

Ohsaki & Sato, 1994). Thus, our results confirm the field observations (Fig. 3). Phylogenetic

297

analysis showed that the P. napi and P. melete clade was strongly supported, and the species

298

phylogeny seemed to correspond with larval performance (Fig. 5), suggesting that the larval host

299

preferences of the four Pieris butterflies are phylogenetically conserved. In this study, we did not

300

perform any physical or chemical defense analyses on the different Brassicaceae plants species we

301

used; however, a number of previous studies revealed that the GLS profiles of Brassicaceae plants

302

can differ dramatically among Brassicaceae species (Agerbirk & Olsen, 2012; Fahey, Zalcmann,

303

& Talalay, 2001; Olsen et al., 2016). Our results suggest that Pieris species might not always be

304

capable of fully adapting to the defenses in the ranges of their potential host plants and so likely

305

evolved to feed on a subset of Brassicaceae plants.

306
307

Comparing averaged dN/dS ratios among all species pairs for each ortholog, we found

308

that only NSPs had higher dN/dS values among NSP-like gene family members (Fig. 4). Although

309

we filtered out a number of genes by RBH processes and therefore compared only a subset of the

310

entire orthologs, our finding strongly suggests that NSPs are under positive selection – or, more

311

relaxed purifying selection -- among the five Pieris butterfly species. In our interspecies dN/dS

312

comparison, we also observed that NSPs had higher dN/dS values than the other ortholog sets in

313

most of the species pairs (they were located in the top 5.5% in 7 out of 10 species pairs), supporting

314

the hypothesis of positive selection on NSPs in this genus (Fig. 5). In previous research, which

315

calculated dN/dS values from partial NSP sequences of P. rapae and P. brassicae with 70 other

316

genes, higher dN/dS values of NSPs were observed (dN/dS = 0.25 ranked in the top 5%) (Heidel-

317

Fischer et al., 2010). We found that dN/dS values in our dataset from entire NSP mRNA sequences

318

of this species pair were 0.257, which ranked in the top 6.06 %, thus supporting previous findings.

319

Interestingly, we also found that in most cases MAs had lower dN/dS values compared to NSPs (in

320

both averaged dN/dS ratios and interspecies comparisons) (Figs. 4, 5), and their dN/dS values did

321

not reach the top 5%, suggesting that in this genus, MAs are under stronger purifying selection

322

than are NSPs. NSPs and MAs are known as paralogs, and only NSP was confirmed to have GLS-

323

disarming activity in Pieris. However, MAs also disarm GLSs in another Brassicaceae-feeding

324

Pierid genus, Anthocharis, which has only MAs (Edger et al., 2015); this overlap strongly suggests

325

that in Pieris MAs act like NSPs. Our results show that selection on these two paralogous genes,

326

both of which have similar structure and can potentially disarm GLSs, can differ strikingly. This

327

could imply that these paralogs have differentially functionalized in Pieris, where NSPs have more

328

derived functions, whereas MAs have more conservative functions. DN/dS values of SDMAs were

329

lowest among all NSP-like gene family members and also had similar values compared to the

330

average of all the orthologous sets. This similarity suggests that SDMAs are under strong purifying

331

selection and have a conserved function in Pieris. Expressed in the gut, SDMAs are known to be

332

found in all Lepidoptera, supporting the hypothesis that their function is related to digestion

333

(Fischer et al., 2008; Randall et al., 2013).

334
335

Using the branch-site model analysis by codeml, we detected evidence of positive

336

selection only in NSPs at the P. napi-melete branch (Table 1). Testing all possible branches of all

337

NSP-like gene family members with aBSREL, we detected signatures of positive selection in NSPs

338

only at this branch (Table 2). Based on our comprehensive feeding experiment and phylogenetic

339

analyses, we found that the P. napi-melete branch had different host preferences from P. rapae and

340

P. brassicae (Figs. 2, 4). These results suggest that host-plant preferences in Pieris were associated

341

with the evolution of NSPs but not MAs or SDMAs. In this study, we did not test the functional

342

differences of NSPs among the five Pieris species. Furthermore, we could not determine whether

343

the differences in larval performances that we observed among the four Pieris species were caused

344

by the dissimilarity among the GLS profiles of the host plants. However, our findings imply a

345

strong relationship between the evolution of NSPs and host-utilization patterns among Pieris

346

butterflies. Moreover, it is also interesting that only NSPs showed this signature of selection,

347

suggesting that NSPs have been functionalized to detoxify GLSs specific to certain plant species;

348

in contrast, MAs may have evolved to disarm the widespread types of GLSs such as are found

349

universally across Pieridae host plants. In addition, we found positively selected sites in the second

350

and third domains of NSPs, and in earlier population genetic work using P. rapae (Heidel-Fischer

351

et al., 2010). Although the molecular mechanisms of the GLS-disarming function of NSPs and

352

MAs are still unclear, our results suggest that the second and third domains of NSPs are important

353

for substrate specificity.

354
355

Besides individual NSP gene family members, elevated dN/dS values were also more

356

broadly observed among the five Pieris butterflies in several GO categories, including “proteolysis”

357

(biological process), and “serine-type endopeptidase activity” and “hydrolase activity” (molecular

358

function). In Lepidopteran larvae, most of the digestive enzymes are involved in proteolysis (Simon

359

et al., 2015) and several classes of digestive enzymes are necessary for insect herbivores to acquire

360

essential nutrients in appropriate amounts (Broadway, 1989). In Pieris, these proteolytic activities

361

were dominated by serine endopeptidases (Broadway, 1996). Since plants also have varied species-

362

specific protease inhibitors to inhibit protease activity in herbivores, herbivores need to have

363

evolved inhibitor-resistant proteinases as a counter adaptation (Bolter & Jongsma, 1997). Our

364

findings showed signs of positive selection in protease-related genes among five Pieris species,

365

suggesting that these genes have accumulated more functional changes as a consequence of

366

interactions with plants in their specific host-plant ranges. A number of genes with hydrolase

367

activity are included in genes related to detoxification in herbivores (Simon et al., 2015). Previous

368

research has uncovered differential gene regulation of this GO term member in several herbivore

369

species responding to different host-plants (Schweizer, Heidel-Fischer, Vogel, & Reymond, 2017).

370

Therefore, a sign of positive selection or relaxed purifying selection on this GO member may also

371

be associated with the host-plant spectra in Pieris butterflies.

372
373

To uncover the co-evolutionary diversification of plants and herbivores, it is important

374

to understand the molecular interactions between all involved partners. We found the signature of

375

positive selection on NSPs in a Pieridae genus, Pieris, associated with respective host-plant usage.

376

It seems that the evolution of host-plant adaptive genes is correlated with patterns of host-plant

377

usage in this Pieris butterfly genus. Moreover, we also observed that MAs, which are paralogs of

378

NSPs, are under more strict purifying selection than NSPs. Our findings combine results from

379

genetic and ecological assays to focus on how the evolution of these two paralogous genes may

380

affect the arms-race between Brassicales and Pieris butterflies and their consequent diversification.

381

Functional assays focusing on selected sites will increase our understanding of the evolution and

382

functional differentiation of NSPs and MAs and how Pieris adapted evolutionarily to diverse

383

glucosinolates in their host plants.

Field observations of primary habitat and larval host-plant spectra of five Pieris butterflies in
Japan. P. napi and P. melete tend to be found in montane habitat and rely mostly on Brassicaceae
plants in forests; these include Arabis, Arabidopsis or Turritis. P. rapae and P. brassicae are
known as Brassica crop pests. In Japan, P. canidia can only be found in a restricted area and uses
Cardamine or Lepidium as host plants.

Brassicaceae plants

Fig. 3
Feeding assays of four Pieris butterfly larvae on 25 different Brassicaceae plants (n = 6). The four
Pieris butterfly species generally grew better on Cardamine occulta but could not use B. incana or
E. cheiranthoides as optimal hosts. Overall larval performance patterns of the four Pieris species
could be clustered in two groups: P. napi – melete and P. rapae – brassicae. P. napi and P. melete
larvae grew better on Arabis hirsuta or Turritis glabra, and P. rapae and P. brassicae larvae grew
better on Thlaspi arvense.

dN/dS

Fig. 5
The species pairwise dN/dS values compared with the results of feeding behavior of Pieris
butterflies. The histograms showed distributions of species pairwise dN/dS values of entire
ortholog sets (showing only from 0 ≤ dN/dS ≤ 0.8 for displaying in scale and the top 5% are
colored orange). The positions of each NSP-like gene family member are highlighted with
colored vertical lines (NSP: pink, MA: blue, SDMA: green). Symbols on the lines show ranking
(‘*’: in the top 5%, ‘†’: in the top 5.5%). The scatterplots show the larval growth of each pair of
Pieris species except for P. canidia. A phylogenetic tree was reconstructed by all the aligned
contigs of the five Pieris species with bootstrapping support in each node. We found a signature
of positive selection in NSPs at the P. melete and P. napi branch (left phylogeny: P = 0.018,
LRT), which is also supported by significantly elevated dN/dS values of NSP in the species pairs
at the phylogenetic branch (P. napi -. P. rapae, P. napi - P. brassicae, P. melete - P. rapae, P.
melete - P. brassicae). Furthermore, dissimilarities in larval performance correlated with elevated
dN/dS values of NSPs.
