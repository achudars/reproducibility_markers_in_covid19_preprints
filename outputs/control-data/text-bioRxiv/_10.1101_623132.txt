Abstract

25

Accumulating evidence has shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in

26

several biological processes, including immune responses. However, the role of lncRNAs in

27

antiviral innate immune responses remains largely unexplored. Here, we identify an

28

uncharacterized human lncRNA from influenza A virus (IAV) patients, antivirus and activate

29

neutrophil (AVAN), that is significantly up-regulated upon virus infection. Mechanistically,

30

nuclear lncRNA-AVAN positively regulates the transcription of forkhead box O3A (FOXO3a)

31

by associating with its promoter and inducing chromatin remodeling to promote neutrophil

32

chemotaxis. Furthermore, we also found that cytoplasmic lncRNA-AVAN directly binds

33

tripartite motif containing 25 (TRIM25) and enhances the association of TRIM25 and

34

Retinoic acid inducible gene-1 proteins (RIG-I) and the ubiquitylation of RIG-I, thereby

35

promoting TRIM25- and RIG-I-mediated antiviral innate immune signaling. More

36

importantly we enforced the expression of AVAN in transgenic mice and found that it

37

significantly alleviated IAV virulence and virus production. Collectively, these findings

38

highlight the potential clinical implications of lncRNA-AVAN as a key positive regulator of

39

the antiviral innate immune response and a promising target for developing broad antiviral

40

therapeutics.

Introduction

45

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), a large class of noncoding RNAs with no or limited

46

coding potential, are defined as functional RNAs that participate in a wide range of biological

47

processes, including cell and organ development, X-chromosome inactivation, tumor

48

proliferation, genomic imprinting, and stem cell self-renewal (1-10). lncRNAs are also

49

reportedly involved in innate and adaptive immune responses, such as immune cell

50

proliferation and cytokine production (11-14). Previous studies have shown that lncRNAs

51

exert their roles in regulating chromatin accessibility, mRNA stability and protein activity by

52

interacting with chromatin DNA, mRNAs or proteins (15-18). With the discovery and

53

characterization of an increasing number of lncRNAs, several mechanisms of these lncRNAs

54

in virus-host interactions have been elucidated (19,20), however, many others remain

55

uncharacterized.

56

Influenza A virus (IAV) is a leading cause of respiratory-related morbidity and mortality,

57

posing a substantial threat to global health (21). However, some mechanisms underlying

58

IAV-host interactions remain unclear. Neutrophils provide one of the early lines of innate

59

immunity and defense against invading microorganisms, which contribute to the fine

60

regulation of the inflammatory and antiviral immune responses (22-24). Increasing evidence

61

suggests that neutrophils are also prominent components of the inflammatory and immune

62

responses during virus infection. Neutrophils are rapidly recruited to sites of infection during

63

the innate immune response to IAV (25-27). In addition, neutrophils can produce and release a

64

large variety of cytokines and chemokines (23), which enables them to significantly influence

65

antiviral defense (28). During virus infection, chemokines play a crucial role in neutrophil

66

activation and chemotaxis (29). However, how lncRNA functions in this process is largely

67

unknown.

68

Intracellular RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), namely, RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2, are

69

well-defined single-stranded viral RNA sensors that play a pivotal role in host antiviral

70

activity by initializing the rapid production of type I interferons (IFN) and cytokines (30).

71

RIG-I is a key sensor of paramyxoviruses, influenza virus, hepatitis C virus, and Japanese

72

encephalitis virus (31). The binding of viral RNA to the RIG-I C-terminal regulatory domain

73

results in a conformational change that, in turn, enables RIG-I binding to the signal adaptor

74

MAVS (also called VISA, IPS-1, or CARDIF) through N-terminal caspase recruitment

75

domains (CARDs). Such binding enhances the phosphorylation of IRF3 and eventually leads

76

to the production of type I IFN and inflammatory cytokines (32). However, little is known

77

about the roles of lncRNAs in IAV-infected patients or the mechanisms of lncRNA activity

78

and host antiviral immune responses.

79

In this study, we profile the lncRNAs of IAV-infected patient neutrophils and identify a

80

human lncRNA, designated AVAN, which plays a critical role in anti-IAV infection.

81

Functional experiments demonstrate that AVAN up-regulates FOXO3a expression to promote

82

neutrophil chemotaxis and recruitment. In addition, AVAN enhances the activation of the

83

RIG-I-mediated antiviral response by directly binding to TRIM25. These results show that an

84

unannotated lncRNA, AVAN, functions to maintain innate immune homeostasis of antiviral

85

immunity during IAV infection.

Results

87

LncRNA expression is regulated by the influenza A (H7N9) virus in human neutrophils.

88

Neutrophils, the prototypic cells of the innate immune system, are reported to play a

89

pivotal role in the innate immune response to IAV (22-24). To explore the roles of host

90

lncRNAs during IAV infection, we profiled whole transcriptional alterations using RNA-Seq

91

in neutrophil samples from patients infected with IAV in the acute stage and their matched

92

recovery-stage samples (GSE108807). We identified a total of 404 differentially expressed

93

protein-coding genes (FC>2, p<0.05), including 234 up-regulated and 170 down-regulated

94

genes, in each patient sample (Fig S1). The differentially expressed genes were strongly

95

associated with the immune response, inflammatory response and innate immune response

96

according to Gene ontology (GO) analysis (Fig 1A). We then mapped the detected lncRNAs

97

to the human genome (UCSC version hg19) and the NONCODE V3.0 database and found an

98

average of 240 up-regulated (range from 164 to 357) and 193 down-regulated (range from

99

158 to 257) novel lncRNAs in acute-stage influenza patients compared with their

100

recovery-stage counterparts (FC>2, p<0.05) and subjected them to a cluster analysis (Fig 1B).

101

To investigate the association between lncRNAs and IAV infection, in silico analysis

102

identified 26 novel lncRNAs candidates with notably aberrant expression (Fig 1C). To

103

confirm the expression of these lncRNAs, we separated the neutrophils and monocytes from

104

healthy volunteers and infected the cells with influenza virus A/Beijing/501/2009 (abbreviated

105

as IAV-BJ501 or BJ501) for 12 h and found that XLOC_040025 (AVAN) was most

106

significantly up-regulated after IAV-BJ501 challenge (Fig 1D, E). We also infected human

107

alveolar epithelial cells (A549) with IAV-BJ501 and measured the expression of the 26

108

lncRNAs and found that AVAN was most strongly up-regulated after IAV-BJ501 infection (Fig

109

1F).

110
111

AVAN is preferentially up-regulated following virus infection

112

We then performed qRT-PCR to quantify AVAN expression in the RNA-Seq samples and

113

found that the results were consistent with the RNA-Seq data (Fig S2A). Thus, AVAN was

114

chosen for subsequent investigation. To further confirm the expression of AVAN in

115

IAV-infected patients, we collected blood samples from 63 additional IAV-positive patients

116

and measured the expression of AVAN, which was significantly up-regulated in the neutrophils

117

of these patients (Fig 2A; Table S1). Similarly, AVAN was up-regulated in A549 cells after

118

infection with multiple sub-strains of IAV (Fig 2B) and several other RNA viruses, including

119

Sendai virus (SeV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)

120

(ADV) (Fig S2B). In addition, Poly (I:C), IFN-Î² also could significantly stimulate the

121

expression of AVAN (Fig S2B). Moreover, AVAN expression was significantly up-regulated

122

upon IAV-BJ501 challenge in a time- and dose-dependent manner in A549 cells (Fig 2C, D).

123

Absolute copy number measurement showed that AVAN was expressed at relatively low

124

levels without infection, with 11 or 14 transcript copies in per neutrophil or A549 cell

125

respectively (Figure S2). Additionally, AVAN expression was also significantly up-regulated in

126

a time- and dose-dependent manner in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL60),

127

which is often a substitute for neutrophils, upon IAV-BJ501 challenge (Fig S2B, C).

128

Subcellular fractionation followed by qRT-PCR in IAV-BJ501-infected A549 cells revealed

129

that the amount of AVAN localized in the cytoplasm was nearly as same as the one in nucleus

130

(Fig 2E, Fig S2D). Besides, we performed RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization

131

(RNA-FISH) with two specific probes in IAV-BJ501-uninfected and â€“infected A549 cells and

132

found that AVAN localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus were almost the same abundance (Fig

133

2F). In addition, we constructed competitive association FISH to display the specific

134

distribution of AVAN. When adding free labeling-probes, the fluorescent dye from biotin

135

labeling-probes was weaken (Fig S2E). AVAN exhibits no protein-coding potential according

136

to ORF finder (33) and the coding potential calculator (34) (Fig S2F). Only one transcript

137

variant (approximately 500 nt) of AVAN was found in A549 cells, and it was found to be

138

up-regulated upon IAV-BJ501 infection using northern blot analysis (Fig 2G). The exact

139

transcript length (517 nt) of AVAN was confirmed by 5â€™ and 3â€™ RACE (Table S2), which

140

revealed that AVAN is polyadenylated (Fig S2G). Taken together, lncRNA expression profiling

141

of patient neutrophils during IAV infection identified a novel AVAN that was preferentially

142

up-regulated in IAV-BJ501-infected cell lines and patient neutrophils upon virus infection.

143
144

AVAN is essential for antiviral immune responses and neutrophil chemotaxis during

145

IAV-BJ501 infection

146

To evaluate the potential function of AVAN, we next analyzed the related gene

147

coexpression networks from the sequencing data and performed gene set enrichment analysis

148

(GSEA). Influenza viral RNA transcription and replication were negatively related to AVAN

149

(Fig S3, Table S3-S8), suggesting that AVAN participates in innate antiviral immunity. To

150

identify the functions of AVAN, we generated AVAN-overexpressing A549 cells (Fig 3A) and

151

found that viral replication was strongly inhibited (Fig 3B). In contrast, virus titer was

152

up-regulated following AVAN knockdown with two specific siRNAs (Fig 3H, I), indicating

153

that AVAN enhances the regulation of antiviral immune responses.

154

Innate immunity provides the first line of defense against invading pathogens. The

155

recognition of invading virus by pathogen-recognition receptors activates the innate immune

156

system, resulting in the production of type I IFNs (IFN-Î± and IFN-Î²) and eliciting antiviral

157

responses (35-37). Thus, we assessed whether AVAN regulates virus-induced type I IFN

158

production. The results of qRT-PCR indicate that AVAN overexpression increased IFN-Î± and

159

IFN-Î² transcript levels upon IAV-BJ501 infection compared with those of the control vector

160

(Fig 3C). To confirm this result, we performed ELISA to measure IFN-Î± and IFN-Î² protein

161

expression

phenomena were abolished by knocking down AVAN (Fig 3J, K).

and

IFN-Î²

were

164

The above GSEA data and GO analysis showed that the genes related to AVAN were also

165

significantly enriched in chemotaxis and immune cell activation (Fig S4A, Table S9, S10), the

166

main components of innate immune responses. To explore the role of AVAN in chemotaxis, we

167

collected culture supernatants of AVAN-overexpressing A549cells and performed neutrophil

168

transwell assays, which revealed that AVAN overexpression significantly up-regulated

169

neutrophil chemotaxis during IAV-BJ501 infection (Fig 3E). These phenomena were disrupted

170

by knocking down AVAN (Fig 3L). The chemokines interleukin-8 (CXCL8, IL-8) is potent

171

neutrophil chemoattractant (38) and is released by a variety of lung cells, including

172

macrophages and epithelial cells as well as neutrophils themselves (39). IL-8 primarily

173

attracts neutrophils and induces them to release lysosomal enzymes, triggering the respiratory

174

burst and increasing the expression of adhesion molecules on the cell surface (40). IL-8 is the

175

primary cytokine involved in the recruitment of neutrophils to the site of damage or infection

176

and plays a crucial role in acute inflammation by recruiting and mediating neutrophils and

177

other cells (41). Thus, we determine whether AVAN altered IL-8 expression in A549 cells.

178

AVAN overexpression increased IL-8 transcript and protein levels upon IAV-BJ501 infection

179

compared with those of the control vector (Fig 3F, G); this was abolished upon AVAN

180

knockdown (Fig 3M, N, Fig S4G, H). To verify our hypothesis, we next overexpressed or

181

knocked down AVAN in HL60 cells (Fig S4C, E) and infected them with IAV-BJ501. The cell

182

samples were harvested at the indicated times, and transcript and protein levels of IL-8 were

183

measured. The results from HL60 cells were consistent with those obtained in A549 cells (Fig

184

S4D, F). Meanwhile, we isolated neutrophils from human primary cell and found that AVAN

185

could stimulate the IL-8 transcript upon IAV-BJ501 infection (Fig S4I, J), and this was

186

abolished upon AVAN knockdown (Fig S4K, L). Collectively, these data indicate that

187

lncRNA-AVAN plays a vital role in antiviral responses by positively regulating type I IFN

188

induction and neutrophil chemotaxis.

189
190

AVAN up-regulates ISG and chemokine expression

191

To verify the global influence of AVAN during virus infection and to gain further insight

192

into AVAN activity, we performed cellular transcriptome profiling on A549 cells using cDNA

193

microarrays and found that AVAN overexpression altered the expression of 81 genes after 14 h

194

of BJ501 infection compared with control cells (Fig 4A, Table S11). Most of these divergent

195

genes were associated with antiviral innate immune responses and inflammatory diseases

196

according to Reactome pathway analysis (Fig 4B) and FunDO diseases analysis (Fig S5).

197

Notably, genes associated with immune system IFN signaling and cytokine signaling were

198

markedly up-regulated in cells with ectopic AVAN expression compared with control cells,

199

including chemokines and ISGs (IFN stimulated genes) (Fig 4C). These significantly

200

up-regulated genes, including MX1, ISG15, IFIT2, OASL, IFIM3, TNFAIP3, CXCL2 and

201

CCL5, were confirmed by qRT-PCR (Fig 4D), and these were abolished after AVAN

202

knockdown upon IAV-BJ501 infection (Fig 4E). These data again reveal that AVAN strongly

203

participates in antiviral innate immune processes and neutrophil chemotaxis.

204
205

AVAN triggers FOXO3a expression in the nucleus to enhance neutrophil chemotaxis

206

Recent studies have shown that divergent lncRNAs can positively regulate the

207

transcription of nearby genes through chromatin remodeling (4,42-46). The genomic location

208

of AVAN suggested that it was divergently transcribed from a position 500-bp upstream of the

209

FOXO3a gene (Fig S2G). Interestingly, mRNA array data revealed that FOXO3a is

210

significantly up-regulated following AVAN overexpression during IAV-BJ501 infection (Fig

211

4C). To investigate the role of AVAN in FOXO3a expression, we measured the abundances of

212

FOXO3a after overexpressing or knocking down AVAN in A549 and HL60 cell lines. The

213

overexpression of AVAN up-regulated FOXO3a transcription in A549 cells, consistent with its

214

role in enhancing FOXO3a protein expression (Fig 5A; Fig S6A left). Conversely, knocking

215

down AVAN down-regulated FOXO3a transcription and protein expression (Fig 5B; Fig S6A

216

right). In addition, the results in HL60 were consistent with these observed in A549 cells (Fig

217

S6B).

218

The association of AVAN with FOXO3a expression and the subcellular localization of

219

AVAN in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig 2E, F) prompted us to test whether AVAN

220

interacts with the FOXO3a promoter. To this end, we conducted chromatin isolation by RNA

221

purification (ChIRP) using antisense oligoes against AVAN followed by qPCR in BJ501

222

-uninfected and -infected A549 cells and found that AVAN bound to sequences upstream of

223

FOXO3a (Fig 5C, D, E; Fig S6C). We further verified the potential role of AVAN in

224

modulating chromatin modifications at the FOXO3a promoter region. Chromatin

225

immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR revealed that ectopic AVAN expression increased Pol II

226

binding, as well as H3K4me3 and H3K27ac levels, at the AVAN-coated FOXO3a promoter in

227

virus infected A549 cell (Fig 5F, G, H) and uninfected A549 cell (Fig S6D, E, F). In contrast,

228

knocking down AVAN decreased Pol II binding and H3K4me3 and H3K27ac accumulation

229

(Fig 5I, J, K; Fig S6G, H, I).

230

Chemokines were markedly up-regulated in cells with ectopic AVAN expression (Fig 4C).

231

A previous study reported that FOXO3a can regulate chemokine expression (47). To further

232

investigate whether AVAN-promoted chemokines expression is associated with FOXO3a, we

233

measured IL-8 expression in FOXO3a overexpressing A549 cells. Ectopic FOXO3a

234

expression significantly promoted IL-8 expression and neutrophil chemotaxis during

235

IAV-BJ501 infection (Fig 5L, N; Fig S6J). In contrast, knocking down FOXO3a decreased

236

IL-8 expression and neutrophil chemotaxis during IAV-BJ501 infection (Fig 5M, O; Fig S6K).

237

In addition, we knocked down FOXO3a in AVAN-overexpressing A549 cells and found that

238

knockdown abrogated AVAN-induced effects on IL-8 expression during IAV-BJ501 infection

239

(Fig 5P). These data provide evidence that AVAN plays a critical role in regulating FOXO3a

240

expression in nucleus by associating with the FOXO3a promoter and performing chromatin

241

remodeling, which additionally increased IL-8 and neutrophil chemotaxis.

242
243

AVAN direct binds to TRIM25 and enhances the TRIM25-mediated activation of RIG-I

244

signaling

245

Previous experiments demonstrated that AVAN is located in the cytoplasm (Fig 2E, 2F).

246

To investigate the molecular mechanism of AVAN in the cytoplasm, RNA pull-down assays

247

using biotin-labeled AVAN or AVAN antisense control followed by mass spectrometry (MS)

248

analysis were performed. The result of MS revealed that E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25, an

249

RNA-binding protein (48,49), was pulled down by AVAN in IAV-BJ501-infected A549 cells

250

but not by the AVAN antisense control (Fig 6A, Fig S7A). This result was confirmed by AVAN

251

RNA pull-down western blot experiments (Fig 6B). Besides, ChIRP followed by western blot

252

revealed that AVAN-specific probes could pull down TRIM25 while LacZ couldnâ€™t (Fig 6C).

253

To validate the interaction between AVAN and TRIM25, we immunoprecipitated TRIM25

254

from IAV-BJ501-infected A549 cells and quantified the protein-bound AVAN. Significantly

255

higher levels of AVAN were detected with exogenous (Fig 6D) and endogenous (Fig 6E)

256

TRIM25 immunoprecipitation than with the isotype immunoglobulin G (IgG) control.

257

Furthermore, we constructed Flag-tagged TRIM25 truncated proteins containing the SPRY

258

domain, B box/central coiled-coil domain (CCD), or RING domain and performed AVAN

259

RNA pull-down western blot experiments. The results showed that only the B box/central

260

CCD domain was involved in the AVAN-TRIM25 association (Fig 6F). Furthermore, to

261

explore the TRIM25 binding site on AVAN RNA, three truncated probes from AVAN were

262

used for RNA pull-down assay. The result indicated that the TRIM25-binding activity mapped

263

between nucleotides 1 and 200 (Fig 6G). Together, these findings indicate that AVAN

264

physically interacts with TRIM25 and that the B box/central CCD of TRIM25 and 1-200nt of

265

AVAN contribute to this association.

266

To test whether AVAN enhances the IFN-mediated antiviral innate immune response

267

through TRIM25 and RIG-I signaling, we knocked down endogenous TRIM25 in HEK-293T

268

cells and observed a markedly reduced effect of ectopic AVAN expression on the activation of

269

IFNB1-responsive reporters in the context of IAV-BJ501 infection (Fig S7B). RIG-I is

270

polyubiquitinated by TRIM25, which attaches K63-linked polyubiquitin to the sensor (50),

271

Previous study showed that a stabilization of TRIM25-RIG-I interaction is important for a

272

sustained antiviral IFN response (51). We next examined the effect of AVAN on the interaction

273

between TRIM25 and RIG-I. We found that ectopically expressing AVAN markedly enhanced

274

the association between TRIM25 and RIG-I upon IAV-BJ501 infection, and knockdown of

275

AVAN weakened this association (Fig 6H, I). Additionally, different fragments of AVAN were

276

overexpressed in A549. We observed that P1 (1-200nt) could enhance the association between

277

TRIM25 and RIG-I, and significantly upregulate the expression of IFN-Î± and IFN-Î², as

278

full-length AVAN, while fragment P2+P3 (201-517nt) couldnâ€™t (Fig S7C, D). Moreover,

endogenous

280

AVAN-overexpressing cells in the context of IAV-BJ501 infection compared with the control

281

vector while RIG-I ubiquitylation was decreased in AVAN-knockdown cells (Fig 6J, K, L).

282

Furthermore, we explored the impact of altered AVAN levels on RIG-I signaling. Total RIG-I

284

addition, AVAN overexpression increased TBK1 and IRF3 phosphorylation upon IAV-BJ501

285

infection (Fig S7E, left). In contrast, AVAN knockdown abolished these changes (Fig S7E,

286

right). To test whether AVAN enhances the IFN-mediated antiviral innate immune response

287

through TRIM25 and RIG-I signaling, we performed qPCR analysis measuring

288

IFN-alpha/beta upon AVAN transfection, and then individually knock down RIG-I or TRIM25.

289

The results showed that knock down RIG-I or TRIM25 abrogated AVAN-induced effects on

290

IFN-alpha/beta expression during IAV-BJ501 infection (Fig 6M, N, Fig S7F, G). Together,

291

these data show that AVAN can enhance the interaction between TRIM25 and RIG-I and the

292

ubiquitylation of RIG-I in the cytoplasm. Thus, we conclude that AVAN promotes TRIM25-

293

and RIG-I-mediated antiviral innate immune signaling.

295

AVAN expression significantly alleviates IAV-BJ501 virulence in transgenic mice

296

Although we fail to detect mouse lncRNA, mouse genome contains the AVAN homolog

297

sequences. To further investigate the in vivo effect of AVAN on IAV-BJ501 infection,

298

transgenic mice (TG) mice expressing human AVAN were generated as previously

299

described(52). TG mice lung with high AVAN expression were identified and selected for this

300

experiment (Fig 7A). TG mice and WT littermates were i.n. inoculated with BJ501 virus. As

301

expected, IAV-BJ501 displayed a considerably lower virulence in TG mice than that in WT

302

mice. The survival rates were 60% and 20% in TG mice and WT mice after 14 days

303

post-infection, respectively (Fig 7B). The TG mice exhibited significantly reduced body

304

weight loss at 7 days post-infection compared with the WT mice (Fig 7C). Meanwhile, we

305

compared the lung edema and viral loads of infected TG mice with WT littermates and found

306

that lung wet-to-dry ratio and viral titer in TG mice was significantly lower than that in WT

307

mice (Fig 7D, E). Pathologic examination by HE attaining revealed that histopathlogic

308

alterations improved in TG mice (Fig 7F). Subsequently, we detected FOXO3a expression

309

levels and found that FOXO3a expression were undetectable in TG mice (data not shown),

310

likely due to low AVAN homology in humans and mice. Striking, we found that AVAN also

311

bind to rodent TRIM25 through RNA pull-down using TG mice tissue (Fig 7G) and promote

312

type I IFN expression in vivo (Fig 7H). Similarly, we constructed an AVAN-containing

313

AAV2/9 vector and a control vector, which were then delivered into 4-week-old C57L/B6

314

mice via intranasal (i.n.) administration. We found that AVAN was ectopically expressed in the

315

lung of AAV2/9-AVAN treated mice (Fig S8A). Strikingly, after IAV-BJ501 infection, the

316

groups pretreated with AAV2/9-AVAN exhibited significantly increased survival rates and

317

reduced body weight loss at 10 days post-infection compared with the control group (Fig S8B,

318

C). Furthermore, lung edema, measured as the wet-to-dry ratio of whole lung, was

319

ameliorated (Fig S8D), and improved lung histopathology was observed in infected mice

320

pretreated with AAV2/9-AVAN (Fig S8E, F). Moreover, the virus titer from the lungs of

321

infected mice was also significantly reduced in AAV2/9-AVAN-treated mice compared with

322

that in control mice (Fig S8G, H). In addition, AAV2/9-AVAN promote type I IFN expression

323

in vivo (Fig S8I). Taken together, these observations indicate that expression of lncRNA AVAN

324

can ameliorate IAV-BJ501-induced acute lung injury in vivo and protect mice from

325

IAV-BJ501 infection.

Discussion

328

Recently, increasing evidence supports the importance of lncRNAs in host-virus

329

interactions, and lncRNAs are an emerging paradigm in the regulation of innate immune

330

responses. Previous studies have described several lncRNAs that are differentially expressed

331

during viral infection, including in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus

332

(SARS-CoV)-infected

333

(EV71)-infected rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells (53-55). However, little is known about the

334

lncRNA profile of influenza patients. In this study, we profiled the transcriptome of

335

neutrophils isolated from IAV-infected patients via RNA-Seq technology for the first time.

336

Through a comprehensive analysis of these data, we identified 404 differentially expressed

337

mRNAs and 433 differentially expressed noncoding RNAs in neutrophils of influenza patients.

338

Among these highly expressed genes, we found an lncRNA named AVAN that plays a pivotal

339

role in antiviral responses.

mice,

IAV-infected

human

lung

cells

and

enterovirus

71

340

Several studies have shown that differentially expressed lncRNAs function as negative or

341

positive regulators in various critical steps of the antiviral response (56). For example, BISPR

342

lncRNA can regulate the antiviral IFN response through the induction of the expression of the

343

genomically neighboring gene BST2 in cis. Another IAV-associated intronic antisense

344

lncRNA, negative regulator of antiviral response (NRAV), modulates antiviral responses by

345

suppressing ISG transcription via altered histone modifications (52). A recent study show that

346

lnc-Lsm3b can compete with viral RNAs in the binding of RIG-I monomers and involve in

347

RIG-I-mediated antiviral response (57). In contrast, Herein, our data displayed that AVAN acts

348

as a positive regulator in the antivirus response through two different mechanisms. In one

349

hand, cytoplasmic lncRNA-AVAN directly binds TRIM25 and enhances the association of

350

TRIM25 and RIG-I and the ubiquitylation of RIG-I, thereby promoting TRIM25- and

351

RIG-I-mediated antiviral innate immune signaling. In the other hand, nuclear lncRNA-AVAN

352

positively regulates the transcription of forkhead box O3A (FOXO3a) in nucleus by

353

associating with its promoter and inducing chromatin remodeling to enhance neutrophil

354

chemotaxis.

355

FOXO3a is a member of the Forkhead box O (FoxO) family of transcription factors,

356

which is a PTEN/PI3K/AKT effector functioning in diverse cellular activities such as the

357

induction of cell-cycle arrest, stress resistance, apoptosis, differentiation, and metabolism

358

(58-60). FOXO3a reportedly functions as a major transcriptional regulator in the maintenance

359

of neutrophil activation during inflammation (61). However, little is known about the function

360

of FOXO3a during the immune response in epithelial cells. Previous research demonstrated

361

that FOXO3a repressed cytokine expression induced by LPS or bacteria (47). In this study,

362

FOXO3a plays a different function during IAV infection. FOXO3a promotes IL-8 expression

363

in IAV-BJ501-infected A549 cells, which additionally enhances neutrophil chemotaxis. AVAN

364

is located 1449-bp upstream of FOXO3a. We found that lncRNA-AVAN can markedly

365

increase FOXO3a expression through chromatin remodeling in A549 cells. Additionally,

366

AVAN can enhance neutrophil chemotaxis by upregulating the expression of IL-8. However,

367

knockdown FOXO3a blocked the upregulation of IL-8 by AVAN. In the other hand, to confirm

368

how much of the rise in the level of FOXO3a after AVAN overexpression is the result of

369

enhanced IFN response, as opposed to a direct impact by AVAN on FOXO3a locus, we also

370

used HL60 cells to evade IFN effects (data not shown here). Meanwhile, as seen in Figure 5,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/623132; this version posted October 22, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

371

our data showed that there is a direct effect of AVAN on FOXO3a promoter and thereby

372

enhanced Pol II binding and H3K4me3 and H3K27ac accumulation. Of course, we would

373

generate a mutant AVAN that can induce IFN response similar to WT AVAN but can't bind the

374

FOXO3a promoter or change its expression level in subsequently studies. In addition, our

375

results exhibited that neutrophils were isolated from fresh peripheral blood and were infected

376

in vitro with influenza virus does not mimic their actual status in vivo. How and where AVAN

377

is induced in neutrophils need to be further investigated. Thus, we propose that AVAN may

378

enhance neutrophil chemotaxis through the regulation of FOXO3a expression. However, the

379

detailed mechanism by which FOXO3a regulates the expression of chemokines requires

380

further exploration.

381

Retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) play a well-known role in

382

RNA virus recognition (62). Previous reports have shown that RIG-I is the main host sensor

383

involved in recognizing cytoplasmic viral RNA and subsequently initiating immune responses

384

to eliminate infection. TRIM25, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is critically important in the RIG-I

385

signaling pathway. TRIM25 interacts with the CARD1 region of RIG-I and enhances RIG-I

386

polyubiquitylation to initiate RIG-I-mediated antivirus responses (50). A previous study found

387

that viruses have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to evade the host immune response

388

through regulating the role of TRIM25. IAV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) specifically

389

inhibits TRIM25-mediated RIG-I CARD ubiquitination, thereby suppressing the RIG-I

390

signaling pathway (63). Our results demonstrated that the host can also regulate TRIM25 to

391

increase the immune response. AVAN can directly bind with the B box/central CCD of

392

TRIM25 in A549 cells. Furthermore, the interaction of AVAN with TRIM25 promotes the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/623132; this version posted October 22, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

393

association between TRIM25 and RIG-I and enhances RIG-I ubiquitylation, thereby

394

promoting IFN expression. It is worth noting that AVAN binds TRIM25 and facilitates IFN

395

expression in mice. In addition, we explored the impact of AVAN overexpression or

396

knockdown in IFN induction, chemo attraction of neutrophils or expression of cytokines and

397

chemokines (Fig 3), speculated that lncRNA AVAN is critical in the IFN induction pathway.

398

Although Cadena et al. reported that TRIM25 is not E3 ligase relevant to RIG-I (64), likely

399

reason is related to various RNA virus subtypes. Of course, additional experiments were need

400

to solidify the TRIM25-RNA interaction. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents

401

the first identification of lncRNA-AVAN as a novel partner of TRIM25 and demonstrates that

402

AVAN suppresses IAV-BJ501 replication via TRIM25-RIG-I-dependent antiviral pathways.

403

In conclusion, we provide the first lncRNA landscape of IAV-infected patient neutrophils

404

and identify the function of AVAN, a novel lncRNA, in the innate antiviral immune response.

405

AVAN can enhance the chemotaxis of neutrophils by promoting FOXO3a expression in

406

nucleus. On the one hand, AVAN can serve as a positive regulator of RIG-I signaling by

407

directly binding TRIM25 and enhancing the association between TRIM25 and RIG-I in

408

cytoplasm. (Fig 8). Of course, the mechanism of action of AVAN in vivo (transgenic mice)

409

during IAV-BJ501 and its role in infection by other viruses warrant future investigations.

410

Understanding the powerful roles of ubiquitous and versatile lncRNAs and identifying these

411

IAV-related lncRNAs, especially the novel lncRNA-AVAN, may provide insights into the

412

pathogenesis of viral infection, with lncRNA-AVAN potentially representing an essential

413

target for intervention.

RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays

549

RIP assays were performed as described (51) with minor modification. Briefly, after

550

incubation, the magnetic beads were washed with high salt lysis buffer (containing 500mM

551

NaCl) 5 times. RIP products were analyzed by qRT-PCR using the primer pairs listed in Table

552

S12. ChIP was performed as described (67). The ChIP-enriched FOXO3a promoter was

553

quantified by qPCR using the primer pairs listed in Table S12.

554
555

ChIRP

556

ChIRP was performed according to Chu et al (68). Briefly, seven non-overlapping antisense

557

DNA probes targeting AVAN were designed (http://www.singlemoleculefish.com), and eight

558

probes targeting LacZ were also designed as non-specific controls. All probes were

559

biotinylated at the 3â€™ end with an 18-carbon spacer arm (Invitrogen). 20 million cells were

560

cross-linked by 1% formaldehyde. Cross-linked cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris

561

pH 7.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, add DTT, PMSF, protease inhibitor, and RNase inhibitor

562

before use) at 100mg/ml on ice for 10 min, and sonicated using Ultrasonic Cell Crusher on ice

563

until the bulk of DNA smear is 100-500bp. The cell lysate was separated into two equal

564

aliquots, one for hybridizing with probes targeting AVAN, and the other for probes targeting

565

LacZ as control. Next, C-1 magnetic beads were added to the probe-chromatin mixture. After

566

five total washes with washing buffer (2 SSC, 0.5% SDS, add DTT and PMSF before use),

567

the beads were separated into two parts, 1/10 for RNA elution and 9/10 for DNA elution or

568

protein elution. For elution of the RNA, the beads were treated with Protease K Buffer and

569

RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent. For elution of the DNA, beads were treated with

570

DNA Elution Buffer (50mM NaHCO3, 1% SDS, add 100ug/ml RNase A and 100U/ml RNase

571

H before use), and then DNA was isolated via phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol extraction

572

and subjected to qPCR. For elution of the protein, beads were treated with Î²-mercaptoethanol

573

at a final concentration of 2.5% in 1Ã— NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer (Life Technologies,

574

NP0007) at 96 Â°C for 30 min.

575
576

Statistical analyses

577

All data are presented as the means Â± SEM. Data were analyzed using Studentâ€™s t test.

578

Survival data were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and single time-points were

579

analyzed using ANOVA. All analyses are performed using Instat software (Version 5.0,

580

GraphPad prism). p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
