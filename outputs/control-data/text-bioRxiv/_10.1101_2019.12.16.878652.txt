Abstract: Despite advances in diagnosis and management, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain
the leading cause of death in the US. Atherosclerosis is the most common form of CVD and the
vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques to rupture is a primary determinant for risk of catastrophic
ischemic events. Current imaging of atherosclerotic disease focuses on assessing plaque size and
the degree of luminal stenosis, which are not good predictors of plaque stability. Functional
methods to identify biomarkers of inflammation in plaques could facilitate assessment of plaque
instability to allow early intervention. In this study, we validate the use of a purpose-built,
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-compatible positron emission tomography (PET) insert for
multimodal, molecular imaging of vulnerable plaques in mice. We illustrate the application of PET
to screen for inflamed regions to guide the application of MRI. Molecular MRI visualizes regions
of vascular inflammation and is coupled with anatomical MRI to generate detailed maps of the
inflammatory marker within the context of an individual vessel. As a testbed for this imaging
methodology, we developed a multimodal, iron oxide nanoparticle (NP) targeting vascular cell
adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) for simultaneous PET/MRI of vascular inflammation performed
on a mouse carotid ligation model. In vitro cell studies confirmed that the NPs are not cytotoxic to
liver cells. In vivo simultaneous PET/MRI imaging identified regions of inflammation.
Three-dimensional rendering of the MRI data facilitated high-resolution visualization of patterns
of inflammation along the injured vessel. Histology validated the co-localization of the NPs with
VCAM-1 expression at sites of induced inflammation. The results of this work validate the utility
of the simultaneous PET/MR insert as a research tool for small animals and lays groundwork to
further advance the potential clinical utility of integrated imaging systems.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for both males and females in the United
States.[1] In particular, atherosclerosis is responsible for catastrophic manifestations of heart disease
such as myocardial infarction and stroke.[2] Recent understanding of the pathophysiology of
plaque formation has identified chronic inflammation as a hallmark of plaque development;
localized inflammatory response can lead to the development of “vulnerable” plaques that are
prone to rupture and cause downstream vascular occlusion.[3] Imaging can play a role in
identifying patients with vascular lesions susceptible to acute cardiovascular events, who may be
amenable to treatment with anti-inflammatories or interventional procedures. Recent literature has
shown that plaque lesion composition, particularly the presence of inflammatory markers and
immune cells, as opposed to the degree of vessel stenosis, is a better predictor of patient mortality
and morbidity; and assessment of plaque inflammation is an excellent target for noninvasive
imaging.[4] However, current clinical imaging techniques seldom provide specific information
about inflammation.
Current clinical imaging techniques such as coronary angiography, vascular ultrasound and
computed tomography focus on identifying stenotic disease and can miss vulnerable plaques that
do not cause significant structural stenosis.[5] Anatomical features identified by coronary computed
tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that could be used to classify plaques,
have not been fully validated for prediction of vulnerability.[6] Targeted molecular imaging has
potential for greater predictive value. For example, imaging of plaque inflammation has been
actively pursued using 18F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)
and has shown promise for identifying inflammation, generally in large vessels such as the carotid
and aorta.[7-10] However, it is challenging to accurately assess inflammatory burden in small
vessels with the limited resolution of PET.[11] Moreover, FDG is a non-specific marker of
inflammation that measures only glucose uptake, which presents challenges for coronary artery
imaging against the high metabolic background of the myocardium.[12] Enthusiasm for the clinical
use of 18FDG to identify plaques has diminished over recent years with new tracers such as 18NaF
receiving greater attention; but specific imaging of plaque inflammation is still not available.[13]
New, targeted imaging strategies that can identify inflamed plaques in smaller vessels, such as the
coronary arteries, with higher specificity are needed.
We have previously shown that multimodal agents combining positron emission tomography
(PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect macrophage density in plaques, using the
quantitative ability of PET for high sensitivity mapping of the cells, and MRI for high spatial
resolution molecular imaging and soft tissue mapping.[14] Our previous work utilized separate
scanners to visualize the synergistic PET and MRI information. This required laborious spatial
co-registration (prone to misalignment since they are acquired sequentially), more involved
handling of subjects with longer sedation, and time delay due to the need for transport between
PET and MR scanners. The latter factor also prevents temporal co-registration of the PET and MRI
signals. Not only does this hinder throughput of preclinical research pursuits, but also may limit
the translatability of such agents to the clinic. The use of hybrid modality instruments for
simultaneous signal acquisition is, thus, of increasing interest in the imaging field and clinical
hybrid instruments are now available; but the ideal cardiovascular applications for these hybrid
systems are still under investigation.[15]
In this proof of concept study, we demonstrate the utility of simultaneous PET and MRI to
facilitate PET-guided MRI mapping of localized inflammation in small vessels using an integrated
small animal simultaneous PET/MRI imaging system developed at UC Davis and a dual-mode
contrast agent targeted to Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 (VCAM-1).[16, 17] Vascular Cell
Adhesion Molecule VCAM -1 has received attention for imaging of atherosclerotic plaques due to
its overexpression in the pathogenesis of vulnerable plaques. It has been studied for single modality
imaging by MRI[18], SPECT[19, 20], and ultrasound[21]. Each of these modalities holds inherent
limitations for targeted vascular imaging. MRI and ultrasound can provide excellent local, spatial
information at the lesion site, but are ill-suited to whole-body screening. PET is superior for
screening, but lacks the spatial resolution to identify individual vessels. While computed

tomography (CT), can provide structural information, but does not provide physiological
information at the lesion site. MRI/PET has the potential to overcome these difficulties by
combining the screening power of PET with the resolution power of MRI, enabling concurrent
assessment of cardiovascular structural and physiological abnormalities.[22] We evaluated the
ability of the integrated PET/MRI instrument to visualize sites of localized inflammation induced by
carotid injury in a mouse model; the mouse carotid is of similar size to human coronary arteries.
PET provided an overview of inflamed regions, which was used to focus MRI interrogation and
obtain higher resolution, 3-dimensional details of VCAM-1 expression in single vessels.

DIO (dextran-coated iron oxide) was synthesized as a matched control to the prepared
VDIO-DOTA
(DOTA=
1,4,7,10-Tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic
acid;
VDIO=
VCAM-conjugated DIO;). The physical properties of VDIO-DOTA and its precursor DIO are
summarized in Figure 2a. Following the syntheses described, the DIO and VDIO-DOTA iron oxide
core sizes were measured to be 7.3 ± 2.9 nm by averaging 500 particle measurements from TEM
images as shown in representative images in Figure 2b and 2c. Inset plots show that the
hydrodynamic diameters of DIO and VDIO-DOTA were found to be 39.7 ± 15.0 nm and 48.1 ±
19.5nm, respectively, using dynamic light scattering (DLS). The increased hydrodynamic diameter
could be explained by the addition of peptide polymers on the VDIO surface holding the dextran
polymers apart via steric hindrance. However, the core sizes remained the same.

The iron concentration (mg per unit mass) in DIO and VDIO-DOTA was measured by atomic
absorption (AA) to be 0.161 and 0.037 mg Fe/mg of nanoparticles, respectively. The longitudinal (r1)
relaxivity of VDIO-DOTA at 60 MHz (1.4 T, 37 °C, pH = 7) was 7.4 mM-1s-1 and transverse relaxivity
(r2) was measured as 67.9 mM-1s-1. DIO had r1 and r2 values of 10.1 mM-1s-1 and 68.8 mM-1s-1,
respectively. The r2 to r1 ratio for both reflects their suitability as T2-weighted MRI contrast
agents.[17] VDIO-DOTA relaxivity and size remained stable after 1 year of dry storage at room
temperature.

Given that NPs are expected to clear through the liver, liver cells may be exposed to the
highest off-target concentration of injected contrast agent. Thus, C12 – Resazurin viability assays
were performed on HepG2 liver cells to evaluate any toxicity exhibited by VDIO-DOTA.[23] In this
assay resazurin is reduced to resorufin in proliferating cells.[23] Cell survival was evaluated after
incubation for 4, 24, and 48 hours with different concentrations of VDIO-DOTA, ranging from 0.04
mM iron (red), 0.2 mM iron (blue), 1 mM iron (teal), 4 mM iron (pink) to 10 mM iron (khaki). With
90% confidence interval by t-test there were no differences between the untreated control (0.0 mM
iron, black) and cells treated at all concentrations of VDIO-DOTA tested from 0.04 mM iron up to 10
mM iron. These results support that the nanoparticles are nontoxic to liver cells at relatively high
concentrations.

MRI only studies were performed to determine appropriate dosing prior to PET/MRI studies.
Representative MRI scans showing VDIO-DOTA uptake at the three injection concentrations are
shown in Figure 4a (n = 4 mice per concentration). The leftmost column shows cross sections
through the entire animal for, from top to bottom 6mg/ml, 30mg/ml and 60 mg/ml injection of
nanoparticles. These are labeled with colored circles to indicate the injured vessel (yellow circle),
uninjured contralateral vessel (red circle) and spinal cord (green circle). The co-registration
standards are also visible to left and right of the animal. The regions outlined by the yellow boxes
are presented in zoomed views on the matrix of images on the right, which show, from left to right,
images from this region taken pre-injection, and images 4 and 24 hours after injection of contrast.
For all concentrations, the inflamed vessel (yellow arrows) showed expected increased dephasing
(seen as signal dropout) as the concentration of VDIO-DOTA injected is increased resulting in
greater accumulation at the ligated site compared to the nonligated contralateral vessel (red
arrows). This darkening in the inflamed arteries persists through the 24h timepoint for all
concentrations, showing sustained retention of the particles at the site of inflammation. Robust
signal for 6ml/ml suggested that even lower injection concentrations could be employed. The CR
was calculated as a function of time after injection and dosage and shown in the accompanying
graph in Figure 4b. Although the 60 mg Fe/kg dose showed the greatest signal decrease on the
images, maximal CR was achieved with the 30 mg Fe/kg dosage at both 4h and 24h after injection of
contrast. This highlights the need to achieve a balance between local accumulation of the NP,
retention over time, and its systemic circulation for optimal visualization of the region of interest.
Using these results as a guide, 30mg Fe/kg was used for the remainder of the studies.

non-inflamed control vessel. There was signal decrease at the site of injury at all dosages; but the
decrease was most prominent at the 30 and 60 mg Fe/kg. The regions of interest for Contrast Ratio
(CR) calculation are shown by the circles. (Scale bar = 5 mm). (b) Contrast ratio as function of time
and dose for MRI-only studies. Compared to baseline, the 6 mg Fe/kg dose level did not
demonstrate significant local accumulation of NP at the site of inflammation. Both the 30 mg Fe/kg
and 60 mg Fe/kg showed increased accumulation of NP at the site of inflammation; the 30 mg Fe/kg
dose demonstrated the highest CR, likely due to the reduction of signal differentiation between the
localized accumulation and systemic distribution of NP at the 60 mg Fe/kg dosage. Thus the 30 mg
Fe/kg dose was used for subsequent studies. (Error bars denote the SEM).

Following these MRI only studies, we evaluated VDIO-64Cu-DOTA nanoparticle accumulation
in vivo by hybrid PET/MRI. Figure 5 shows image slices by MRI (top row), by PET (middle row) and
the overlay (bottom row) from the same cross section in a representative mouse (n = 4 mice total).
Prior to injection of VDIO-64Cu-DOTA, no MR or PET signal beyond background levels was seen
within the animal. At 4 h post injection, both carotids demonstrated PET signal, which was higher
in the injured vessel, suggestive of radiolabeled NP accumulation at the site of injury along with
continued systemic circulation of unbound NP. Another focus of PET uptake within the field of
view appear to correspond with a vein, supporting that systemic circulation of the NP remains at
this time point, but which could represent another site of inflammation in the animal. In the slice
shown, at 4 h there is a signal increase in the ligated vessel (yellow arrow) at a ratio of 1.19
compared to the uninjured contralateral vessel; at the 24 h time point the ratio of the ligated site
compared to the contralateral artery was 1.07; partial volume effects limits the accuracy of these
measurement. We also calculated the MRI contrast ratio (CR; see equation in methods 4.6.3) from
the concurrent MRI dataset. Note that CR also is a comparison against the contralateral control,
thus taking into account contributions from signal in the blood. For this particular animal, the MRI
CR was 1.41 at the 4 h time point and 0.62 by 24 h, indicating elevated NP accumulation at the
ligated site at the 4 h timepoint with decreased MRI signal by 24 h, commensurate with the PET
results. This slice was selected to illustrate the point that these trends are for this slice, in this
particular animal and based on this slice only one may conclude there was no inflammation in this
vessel. For a more accurate view of inflammation the entire affected volume should be considered,
as well as the full set of experimental subjects. As shown later, mapping inflammation throughout
the vessel provides a clearer picture of inflammatory burden. The MRI CRs for the entire PET/MRI
cohort were 1.65 ± 0.26 at 4 h and 1.66 ± 0.39 at 24 hours respectively. In general, this is in agreement
with the data for the MRI only cohort, which also demonstrated an increased MRI CR over the 24 h
period (Figure 5b). Note that these results support that ligation does not prevent contrast agent

The lower resolution of PET provides decreased accuracy in determining inflamed regions due
to partial volume effects, and subtle inflammatory lesions may be missed. This is suggested by the
fact that although analysis of the MRI data suggested there was accumulation of the NP at the
ligated site, this was not reflected by the simultaneously acquired PET data. The ratios of the PET
signal at the ligated artery compared to the control artery were 1.05 ± 0.04 at 4 hours and 0.82 ± 0.33
at 24 hours. This highlights the need for high-resolution 3D renderings of the affected volume to
better identify regions of high inflammatory activity and assess degree of instability. For improved
volume visualization, we performed three-dimensional rendering of the MRI data as shown in

Figure 6. MRI rendering is able to define regional accumulations and concentration differences for
VDIO-DOTA in the vessel wall, allowing us to better localize VCAM-1 expression to specific
regions in the inflamed vessel. Figure 6a and b show rendering of the MRI only data from the 30 mg
Fe/kg dose injection for a representative animal, with a slice from the anatomical MRI included for
anatomical context; this is the same animal and slice view used for the cross section image shown in
Figure 4. The color map (transfer function) for the image was set to define three major color zones
representing low (red), medium (blue), and high (pink) NP uptake. Greater susceptibility from
T2-weighting indicates regions of greater particle accumulation (more red). The volume renderings
suggest that VCAM-1 expression, which is targeted by the NPS and indicative of activated
endothelial cells and inflammation, is diffuse along the vasculature and that expression patterns
vary across the vessel. In this particular animal there is a greater accumulation of contrast agent on
one side of the vessel as seen in the 4 h still images in panel a. At 24h (panel b) the trend persists
and one can observe accumulation on one side that is consistent with the 4-hour data.

Figures 6c and d display rendering of the MRI data for the animal shown in the PET/MRI
images of Figure 5. Inflammation is even more heterogeneous in this animal and NP accumulates in
patches throughout the vessel. A local “hot spot”, appears in the 4 h data (panel c) and persists but
is decreased through the 24 h time point (panel d) commensurate with the PET and MRI CR results.
At 24 h most of the hot spot lies below the plane of interrogation that was show in the slice in
Figure 4; this may explain the lack of PET observed in the slice shown and also underscores the
value of evaluating 3D data sets as volume renderings. The rendering provides insight into the
heterogeneity of the NP accumulation, which is not readily apparent from slice by slice
visualization of the MRI image set. This data correlates with the histological data, described in the
next section, which showed inhomogeneous regional accumulations of the nanoparticles that
overlap with regions showing high VCAM-1 expression. The morphology of the local plaque load
can have prognostic implications.[24] Thus, this additional information from the high resolution
MRI may provide vital information for clinical management.

The addition of a 3D visualization is very useful for interpreting these types of data sets where
the disease is diffuse and lesions can span across multiple slices. One of the challenges for 3D
rendering is the ability to create images and videos without the need for extensive manual
segmentation, i.e. user delineation of pathology. The renderings shown here were created using
software created at UC Davis that performs intensity-based segmentation by applying a
user-defined color map to all voxels in the data set. This removes some degree of subjectivity from
the assignment of pathological features.

Mice were sacrificed after in vivo MRI only or PET/MRI study and organs of interest were
collected for further analysis. For the MRI only studies, the tissues from mouse carotids were
embedded into paraffin sections for histological study to examine iron accumulation (Figures 7a, c,
e) and VCAM-1 expression (Figures 7 b, d, f) in the tissues. Prussian Blue staining was used to
detect ferric ion (Fe3+) in the tissue. As shown in Figure 7a blue staining demonstrated that iron
could be found in the intima in the inflamed carotid artery (arrow). Anti-VCAM-1 antibody
staining was performed on an adjacent section (Figure 7b), which confirms the presence of VCAM-1
in the same region, as indicated by dark brown stain of the intima on the left side of the vessel
lumen (arrow). The dark blue iron staining co-localized in the regions of darkest brown VCAM-1
staining, supporting that the nanoparticles were co-localized with VCAM-1 expression. There
appears to be a thin layer of VCAM-1 staining on the rest of the lumen that does correlate with
some iron staining. The faint brown stain over the entire intima represents nonspecific staining that
is also found in the control vessel. Non-inflamed contralateral vessel showed no iron (Figure 7c) or
dark brown VCAM staining (Figure 7d).

VCAM-1, triggered by inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, is expressed by endothelial cells
as a prelude to the recruitment of macrophages into plaques. In our previous work to label
macrophages in the injury model, animals were placed on fat diet for 2 weeks after ligation; the
current studies were performed 8 days after ligation. At this earlier time point, plaque size and
macrophage involvement are minimal as can be seen in the higher magnification histological
images. Figure 7e shows iron staining at increasing magnifications from left to right and iron

staining localized to cells of the intima, which is still generally a monolayer of endothelial cells.
Figure 7f shows VCAM-1 staining at increasing magnifications from left to right, which shows
VCAM-1 localized to the same monolayer. There was no intimal thickening, or obvious
macrophage accumulation observed in the histological slices. The iron stain also appeared confined
to a monolayer of "cobblestone-like” endothelial cells and there was no evidence of macrophages,
which display surface ruffles and blebs. These results support that the NPs were binding to
VCAM-1 expressed on endothelial cells.

In this study, we evaluated the use of a simultaneous hybrid PET/MRI system and multimodal
nanoparticle contrast agent to visualize distribution of an early marker of inflammation. We found
robust spatial-temporal co-localization of the PET and MRI signal, and identified regions of
inflammation, which were confirmed by histological staining. PET, limited by its lower spatial
resolution, could not specifically map inflammation in the vessels. PET also missed elevated
contrast that was detected by MRI, likely due to signal averaging effects of diffuse inflammation in
the tissues. But the sensitivity of PET allowed detection of inflammation in a larger volume map
and served to guide MR imaging. Careful analysis of the MRI data, aided by 3D volume rendering,
demonstrated a heterogeneous pattern of VCAM-1 expression extending beyond the site of vessel
injury. The morphology of the local inflammation patterns can have prognostic implications.[24]
This high-resolution mapping of early stage inflammation would not have been possible with MRI
alone as lesions are difficult to detect in small vessels against anatomical background. Whole body
MRI screening in humans would be even more challenging. Thus, the combination of PET and MRI
provided complementary functions in this imaging application.
Simultaneous PET/MRI imaging of the multimodal NP afforded a number of advantages over
serial imaging including: 1) avoiding movement of the subject between scanner-, which allowed for
facile spatial co-registration to do the lack of soft tissue movement experienced with scanning with
separate instruments; 2) eliminating time delay between PET and MRI scans, which avoided
complications with subject transport under anesthesia; 3) reduced exposure to personnel associated
with handling and transporting the subject between instruments in different facilities. Given that
many high-resolution MRI techniques are often time consuming and have a limited field of view,
the availability of hybrid instrumentation can allow us to localize the ROI using PET without loss of
spatial fidelity that would come with moving the subject to a separate scanner. This would be
especially important in the clinical scenario whereby the site of injury may not be known a priori.
The approach of using hybrid PET/MRI instrumentation along with multimodal imaging
probes provides a powerful platform for both research and clinical pursuits. From a research
perspective, hybrid imaging can provide direct information about the efficacy and distribution of
multimodal molecular imaging agents, providing vital information to refine and improve the signal
characteristics of these agents. From a clinical perspective, PET/MRI hybrid instruments are
available now in a limited number of locations and their optimal applications are under
investigation. Oncological applications have been some of the earliest imaging studies to
demonstrate beneficial results from hybrid PET/MRI.[39, 40] For example, a study of PET/MRI for
clinical prostate cancer imaging found that PET/MRI may demonstrate improved sensitivity to
metastatic lesions compared to PET/CT.[41] Hope for improved diagnoses through hybrid PET/MRI
is high for neurological applications, where the temporal alignment of hybrid instruments could be
an advantage for examining brain processes in real-time.[16]
Cardiovascular applications that could benefit from PET/MRI are still under investigation [22,
42]; however, the simultaneous acquisition capability could offer advantages for imaging fast
moving hearts and arteries. Most reports with PET/MRI have focused primarily on unimodal
contrast agents such as 18FDG using MRI as an anatomic reference.[15, 43, 44] We demonstrate that
PET-guided MRI using multimodal agents can facilitate high-resolution visualization of molecular
targets, and establish utility for mapping a marker associated with inflammation. This can serve as
a powerful research tool for drug validation by allowing monitoring of biomarker targets. Early

diagnosis and patient stratification by PET/MRI could provide clinical benefit as drugs to
ameliorate plaque vulnerability come available.
In summary, we have demonstrated an approach to identify early inflammatory changes in
vessel injury using a targeted multimodal probe coupled with hybrid PET/MRI imaging in vivo.
Such approaches may be able to provide important insights into the pathophysiology and clinical
management of vulnerable plaques. Furthermore, simultaneous PET/MRI allowed direct
comparison of the PET and MRI signal, providing insights into the signal derived from the
multimodal agent that can guide continued development of the instrument as well as the imaging
agent.

Materials were obtained from commercial suppliers and used directly, unless otherwise noted.
Dextran (from leuconostoc, average mol. wt. 9,000–11,000) and ferric chloride hexahydrate
(FeCl3·6H2O, Fw 270.29 g/mol) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Ferrous chloride tetrahydrate
(FeCl2·4H2O, Fw 198.81 g/mol) was from Fluka. Ammonium hydroxide (28–30%), sodium
bicarbonate, and sodium hydroxide were from Fisher Scientific. p-SCN-Bn-DOTA was from
Macrocyclics, Inc (Dallas, TX). N-succinimidyliodoacetate (SIA), purchased from Pierce (Rockford,
IL). Spectra/por® dialysis membrane (mol. wt. cut-off 50,000) was acquired from Spectrum
Laboratories, Inc. The VHPKQHR(MiniPEG1)C peptide was from Genscript (≥ 95% purity). Water
was purified using a Millipore Milli-Q Synthesis purifier (18.0 MΩ cm, Barnstead).

Dextran was reduced by published methods as summarized here and outlined in Figure 1.[25]
Nanopure water (18.0 MW cm, Barnstead) was degassed with argon and used throughout the
synthesis process. A mixture of dextran (molecular weight 10,000) and sodium borohydride (26
equivalents) was stirred at room temperature for 12 hours. The solution was adjusted to pH=7,
dialyzed against degassed nanopure water and lyophilized to form reduced dextran as a white
solid. A mixture of reduced dextran and FeCl3·6H2O in a molar ratio of 1:27 (total polysaccharide:
FeCl3·6H2O) was dissolved in deionized nanopure water. The solution was bubbled with argon and
cooled to 4 °C in an ice-water bath. Fe2+ solution was freshly prepared by dissolving FeCl2·4H2O in
degassed water (with a Fe3+:Fe2+ ratio in a range from 1.47 to 1.5) and stored on ice. The Fe2+ solution
was added to Fe3+ mixture using a syringe followed by adding chilled (4 °C) NH4OH (NH4OH: Fe3+ =
16:1) dropwise with vigorous stirring. The ice-water bath was removed and the mixture was heated
to 85 °C and kept at 85 ± 5 °C for 2 hours (argon flow may stop 2–3 min after the temperature
reaches 85 oC). After cooling to room temperature, the solution was dialyzed against deionized
water in a dialysis bag with a molecular weight cut-off of 50,000 Da for 72 hours with 8-10 changes
of water to remove reactants. The resulting product, DIO, was lyophilized and stored at 4 °C.[26]

The DIO nanoparticles were cross-linked and aminated for the attachment of two ligands:
DOTA (chelator of radioactive 64Cu) and the VCAM-1 targeting peptide (Figure 1). The
cross-linking and amination were performed as previously reported with slight modifications.[27]
DIO (2.0g), NaOH (4.02g) pellets and deionized water (40mL) were added to a 100mL
round-bottomed flask and stirred for 30 min. Then epichlorohydrin was added to the mixture and
the solution was stirred for 24h. The solution was dialyzed against deionized water with 8-10
changes of deionized water and lyophilized to yield brown solid. The solid (2.0 g), together with
ammonium hydroxide (250mL), was then transferred to a 500mL round-bottomed flask and stirred

398

for 36h. Excess ammonium hydroxide was removed by dialyzing the solution against deionized
water for 72h with 8-10 changes of deionized water.

DOTA was conjugated to the aminated DIO surface based on a literature method. Briefly,
p-SCN-Bn-DOTA (6.71mg), aminated nanoparticle (135mg) and 0.1 M sodium borate buffer
solution (2mL) were added to a 10 ml round-bottomed flask (Figure 1b)[28]. Approximately five
drops of sodium hydroxide aqueous solution (1N) was used to bring the solution pH to 8.5. The pH
of the mixture was monitored during the reaction. The mixture was stirred for 24h, then dialyzed
against deionized water for 72h with 8-10 changes of water in a dialysis bag with a molecular
weight cut-off of 50,000 Da and then lyophilized to give a brown solid of DOTA conjugated
aminated DIO (DIO-DOTA). The conjugation of DOTA to the aminated DIO was confirmed by
Fourier Transform Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy. DIO-DOTA was then used for anti-VCAM-1 peptide
attachment based on previous report[29], described here briefly.
DIO-DOTA (22mg Fe in 1.5mL DMSO) was added to 0.5mL of 0.1M Na2HPO4 in water and
0.5mL of 15mM SIA in DMSO in a 10mL round-bottomed flask. The mixture was stirred for 1h at
room temperature followed

(N-succinimidyliodoacetate) in DMSO. Iodoacetyl-DIO was separated from iodoacetic acid using a
Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 0.025M citrate buffer pH 6.5 at 4 °C. Then 6-7 mg of
polymer-modified peptide (VHPKQHR(MiniPEG1)C) in 0.6mL of citrate buffer was added to 5mL
of iodoacetyl-DIO solution and the mixture was incubated overnight at room temperature. The
purchased peptide, C49H84N18O14S1, had a molecular weight of 1181.37 Da and an isoelectric point of
pH 9.84. MiniPEG1 (8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid) spacer was inserted to distance the peptide
from the surface of the nanoparticle to allow for proper tertiary folded structure and allow better
VCAM binding. Unreacted peptide was removed by using a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated
with 0.025M citrate buffer pH 6.5 at 4°C. The purified solution was lyophilized to give the final
product that is the DIO nanoparticle with two ligands (DOTA and VCAM-1 targeting peptide) on
the surface (VDIO-DOTA).

Copper-64 was employed due to its relatively long half-life (12.7 h)[30] and comparatively
stable coordination with multidentate macrocyclic compounds such as DOTA (log KML = 22.3).[31]
VDIO-DOTA (25 mg) was dissolved in 150 µL of 0.2 M pH 5.5 sodium acetate-acetic acid buffer.
Copper-64 (~ 2.5 mCi) was added to the vial and the mixture was vortexed for 5 seconds to obtain a
uniform solution. The solution was incubated at 55-60 °C for 45 minutes. EDTA aqueous solution
(16 µL, 100 mM) was added to the vial and vortexed for 5 seconds to get the solution uniform; then
solution was incubated at 55-60 °C for 15 minutes. The crude product was purified by centrifuge
filtration with 10K Da nanosep filtration tube (Millipore Inc., Billerica, MA, 30 min @14,000 rpm)
and washed 3 times with pH 5.5 sodium acetate-acetic acid buffer. Each time the washing was
removed by centrifuge filtration with a 10-kDa Nanosep filtration tube (10 min at 14,000 rpm). After
three washings the filtration tube was turned over and inserted into a new vial, and the
nanoparticles, VDIO-64Cu-DOTA, were collected by centrifuge (2 min @ 1,000 rpm). The radioactive
nanoparticles were diluted to 650 µL with saline (0.9%) and radioactivity of the solution was
measured with a Fluke Biomedical Dose calibrator (34- 162 CAL/RAD MARK IV, Cleveland, OH).
The radiolabeling yield (%) for the NP, percent incorporation of radioisotope, was determined by
dividing the radioactivity of the collected NP by the total activity applied to the column and
multiplying by 100. For injection to animals VDIO-64Cu-DOTA (~ 15 µL) was passed through a
sterile 0.22-micron filter before use.

The iron concentration (mg) per unit mass of nanoparticles in DIO or VDIO-DOTA was
measured with a Varian AA 220FS atomic absorption (AA) spectrophotometer using an
air/acetylene flame. The iron-oxide core size of the VDIO-DOTA was measured by Transmission
Electron Microscopy (TEM) on a Philips CM-12, operating at 80 kV and equipped with a
GatanMegascan 795 digital camera. The core size was found by averaging the measurements of 500
particles after drying a dilute drop of VDIO-DOTA particles over a lamp on a copper grid. The
average hydrodynamic particle size (mean volume diameter) and distribution was measured using
Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) with a Nanotrac 150 particle size analyzer (Microtrac, Inc.,
Montgomeryville, PA) and geometric eight-root regression, with no residuals, was used to fit the
data. The nano-range option was selected and a scan time of 90 seconds was used.
Transverse relaxation times (T2) of the VDIO-DOTA particles were measured at 60 MHz (1.4 T)
and 37 °C on a BrukerMinispec mq60. The relaxivity was given as the slope of the straight line
plotted as the function of 1/T2 vs iron concentration. DIO and VDIO-DOTA were diluted in pH 7.0
deionized water to give five aqueous solutions (300 µL each): 10.5, 5.25, 2.625, 1.313, and 0.656 mg
Fe/L, respectively. Iron concentrations in each dilution were determined using Atomic Absorption
Spectroscopy. T2 values were measured using a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) sequence with
τ = 1 ms, and 200 data points. Each solution was incubated at 37°C for 5 minutes before
measurement.

Cytotoxicity of VDIO-DOTA was evaluated on HepG2 liver cells using C12 – Resazurin
viability assays. HepG2 liver cells were cultured and maintained in Minimum Essential Medium
containing 10% FBS, 200 U/mL penicillin, 200 µg/mL streptomycin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 1
mM nonessential amino acids at 37oC in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were plated in
96-well dishes at a concentration of 1 x 104 cells per well and incubated overnight (5% CO2, 37oC).
After overnight incubation, media was replaced with fresh media containing VDIO-DOTA
nanoparticles of varying concentration (0, 0.04, 0.2, 1, 4 and 10mM iron). Each concentration was
performed in triplicate for statistical relevance. Cells were also treated with DIO nanoparticles
under the same conditions as control. Cells were plated in three 96-well plates for measurements at
time points of 4h, 24h and 48h. At each time point, nanoparticle solutions were removed and cells
were washed with 1X PBS for three times. Then fresh media containing C12 – Resazurin (5µM) was
added to each well of cells. After 15min of incubation, fluorescence was measured using a Safire
monochromator microplate reader (Tecan Austria G.M.B.H., Austria) with excitation of 563nm and
emission of 587nm.

Slides from the inflamed carotid were stained to evaluated for iron within the plaques using
Prussian Blue Solution[32], a 1:1 mixture of 3% hydrochloride acid solution and 3% potassium
ferrocyanide solution, to detect ferric ion (Fe3+) in the tissue. Any ferric ion present in the tissue
reacted with the ferrocyanide and results in the formation of the bright blue pigment, Prussian blue,
or ferric ferrocyanide. First, slides were deparaffinized by toluene and rehydrated through changes
of ethanol with decreasing concentrations (100%, 95% and 75%). After rinsing, slides were placed in
Prussian blue solution for 30 min followed by a rinsing step to remove excess staining. Then
Nuclear Fast Red Staining was used to counterstain other tissue (pink) for 10 min. After
dehydration with alcohol and clearing with toluene, tissue sections were placed under coverslips on
slides with mounting media.

performed using a Decloaking Chamber. 500 ml of deionized water was added into the chamber. A
plastic staining jar with tissue slides immersed in Antigen Retrieval Solution (Sigma 10X Tris-HCl
buffer, pH10, product #T6455) was placed in the Decloaker chamber. The Decloaker was programed
for 30 seconds at 125 °C followed by 10 seconds at 85 °C at 22.5 psi. After the heating process was
done, the staining jar was removed from the Decloaker and cooled for 15 minutes followed by TBST
rinse (Fisher 20X Tris buffered saline with Tween-20 used as 1X diluted solution). Then endogenous
peroxidase block was performed by using 3% H2O2 in water to cancel the interference of peroxidase
in the final step.[33] Protein block buffer (Dako Protein Block) was used to treat the tissue slides to
mask the non-specific binding sites. Samples were labeled using an indirect method. Anti-VCAM-1
antibody (Rabbit monoclonal [EPR5047] to VCAM-1, Abcam Inc., MA) was used as primary
antibody to detect the VCAM-1 expression. Ready-to-use polymers carrying horseradish peroxidase
(Dako North America, Inc., Carpinteria, CA) were then used as the secondary antibody. In the final
staining step, peroxidase on the polymers reacted with hydrogen peroxide to reduce the DAB
(3,3‘-Diaminobenzidine) substrate and generate a brown product in regions of VCAM-1 expression.
Slides were examined under microscope.

All animal studies were performed under protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committee of the University of California, Davis and the California Institute of Technology. Female
C57BL/6 ApoE-/- (10 weeks old, Jax West Laboratories, West Sacramento, CA) mice were used for
the experiments as described in previous studies.[14] Eight days prior to imaging, the left carotid
artery of each mouse was ligated. Eight days was chosen because prior studies showed that
VCAM-1 expression peaks between 7 and 10 days post-ligation in ApoE-/- mice.[34] At this stage
pronounced plaques have not yet formed, but inflammation is evident. To perform the ligation a
medial incision was made between the mandible and clavicle, exposing the glands and vessels of
the neck. The carotid artery was singled out from the surrounding tissue, while protecting and
excluding the parallel-running vagus nerve. A 6/0 silk suture was threaded under the dorsal side of
the carotid artery and was tied off to cause injury to the site. The procedure was concluded with
five to six interrupted 4/0 Ethicon (Ethicon Inc) suture to re-approximate the skin of the original
ventral incision. The mice were monitored twice a day for approximately four days to check for
irritation and to administer analgesics when appropriate. Subsequent to ligation, mice were placed
on a high fat diet for seven days. (TD 88137, Harlan Laboratories Inc, Madison, WI).

MRI experiments were performed to determine the optimal injection dosages for the NPs prior
to radiolabeling. Prior to NP injection, a pre-scan was taken as baseline. Then VDIO at dosages of 6
mg Fe/kg body mass, 30 mg Fe/kg and 60 mg Fe/kg, were injected intravenously via the tail vein
catheter (N = 4 per concentration). Images were acquired at 4 and 24 hours post-injection.
All images were acquired on a 7T (Bruker Biospec) small animal scanner using a home built
quadrature RF volume coil (Cleveland, OH). For all time points, the animal was anesthetized with a
1.5% isoflurane: air mixture and kept at 35–37 °C with warm air flowing through the bore while the
respiration was monitored (MP150, Biopac, Goleta, CA). After localizing the region of interest (ROI)
around the neck using a RARE spin echo sequence (TR/TE = 4000/22 ms, matrix size = 128 × 128,
FOV = 35.35 × 35.35 mm2, slice thickness = 0.754 mm), the common carotid arteries were located
with a time-of-flight angiography sequence with venous saturation (FL2D_ANGIO method,
Paravision 4.0: TR/TE = 13.7/3.5 ms, matrix size = 150 × 100; zero-filled to 256 × 100, FOV = 30 × 20
mm2, slice thickness = 0.754 mm). A T2* weighted multiple-gradient echo sequence was then utilized
to visualize the uptake of nanoparticles (TR/TE = 718/3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23 ms, F.A. = 25°, matrix size =
175 × 100; zero-filled to 234 × 133, FOV = 35 × 20 mm2, slice thickness = 0.754 mm) at the region of
the common carotid arteries.

Studies were performed using an integrated small animal PET/MRI system, consisting of a
first-generation MR-compatible PET insert (constructed by Simon Cherry et. al at UC Davis) that is
fitted within a 7T small animal MRI scanner. [16, 17] This enabled simultaneous PET/MRI images to
be acquired.
Mice (N = 4) were surgically prepared as described above. Pre-scans were obtained with MRI
as baseline. Next, mice were injected intravenously via the tail vein with 30 mg Fe/kg
VDIO-64Cu-DOTA (~700uCi per mouse, 92% radiation yield) followed by a 150 µL of saline flush.
The activity of the injected dose was confirmed by measuring the difference in radioactivity
contained in the syringe before and after injection on a dose calibrator. Imaging was subsequently
performed at 4 and 24 hours post-injection. MRI images were acquired identically to the MRI-only
studies. PET images were acquired with scan duration of 600 seconds at the 4 hour time point and
300 seconds at the 24 hour time point. Images were reconstructed and co-registered to the MRI
dataset as previously described.[17, 35]
To compare the focal NP uptake between time points, dosage and subjects, we calculated a
contrast ratio (CR) metric as previously described.[36] This normalizes particle uptake at the
ligation site between subjects and factors out the signal contribution due to blood borne particles by
comparison with the contralateral control.
Briefly, CR is defined as:

Where Iligated is the mean intensity of the ROI drawn around the ligated carotid artery, Icontrol is the
mean intensity of the ROI drawn around the contra-lateral carotid. Ibackground is the mean intensity of
the ROI drawn in the spinal cord at the same image slice as the other ROIs and i is either 4 or 24
hours post-injection time points. ROIs were drawn manually at slice levels approximately located at
the common carotid arteries. These were matched between time points. Angiography images were
used to guide ROI delineation around the carotid arteries. Because previous reports noted that the
carotid vessels along with the wall are ~1 mm in diameter,[36] all arterial ROIs had diameters of 1.5
mm.
Representative region of interests used for CR calculation are indicated in Figure 3. Values
greater than 1 indicate localization at the ligation site. The T2* weighted image sets at TE = 11 ms
were used. All images were analyzed using ImageJ.

We developed a hardware accelerated volume rendering system with enhanced rendering
quality to provide better visualization of the PET and MRI signal at the site of the inflamed arteries.
To provide anatomical context, we superimpose a cross section of the data. Illustrative
rendering[37] is applied to this cross section for relative spatial position of the target vessel. The
vessel ROIs were manually segmented from the MRI images to identify the vessel walls. A
pre-integrated transfer function[38] was used to visualize the thin layer of vessel wall as a smooth
and continuous surface. To highlight the NP uptake on the surface of the arteries, we used a color
map to sort the surface MR signal ranging from red (low MR signal), through blue (medium) to
light pink (high MR).

5.7 Histology

584
585

After the in vivo animal study, organs known to be involved in disease or clearance, i.e. hearts,
carotid arteries, kidneys, spleens and livers, were collected and used for histology. The tissue was

586

fixed in 4% formaldehyde, and then dehydrated by passing tissue through increasing
concentrations of ethanol (75%, 95% and 100%). Then the tissue was placed in warm paraffin wax,
and the melted wax filled the spaces that used to contain water. After cooling, the tissue hardened
into a paraffin block from which 5-micron tissue slices were sectioned and mounted on glass slides.
The tissue sections were stained for iron and VCAM-1 as detailed in Supplemental Information.
