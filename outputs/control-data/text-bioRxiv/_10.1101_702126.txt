Abstract
Amyloid aggregation of the microtubule binding protein tau is a hallmark of Alzheimer‚Äôs
disease and many other neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, tau has been found to
undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) near physiological conditions. Although
LLPS and aggregation have been shown to simultaneously occur under certain common
conditions, it remains to be seen whether tau LLPS promotes aggregation, or if they are
two independent processes. In this study, we address this question by combining multiple
biochemical and biophysical assays in vitro. We investigated the impacts of LLPS on tau
aggregation at three stages: conformation of tau, kinetics of aggregation and fibril quantity.
We showed that none of these properties are influenced directly by LLPS, while amyloid
aggregation propensity of tau can be altered without affecting its LLPS behavior. LLPS
and amyloid aggregation of tau occur under overlapping conditions of enhanced
intermolecular interactions and localization, but are two independent processes.
Introduction
Tau is a protein abundant in neurons of the central nervous system that binds and stabilizes
microtubules [1]‚Äì[3]. In healthy conditions, tau is highly hydrophilic and soluble in
aqueous environment under wide ranges of pH, temperature and ionic strength. However,
under pathological conditions, tau forms irreversible and insoluble amyloid aggregates.
Amyloid aggregation of tau into specific fibril strain is a hallmark of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease
(AD) [4], [5], and has been observed under several other neurodegenerative diseases
including progressive supranuclear palsy, frontotemporal dementia, Pick‚Äôs disease and
chronic traumatic encephalopathy [6], [7]. Despite the pathological significance of tau
amyloid aggregation, the pathways from soluble tau to insoluble amyloid aggregates have
still not been identified nor replicated in any non-human system, neither in vitro nor in
vivo. Finding the pathologically relevant amyloid aggregation pathway, as manifested in
the generation of disease phenotypic fibril structures [8]‚Äì[10] is critical for understanding
the underlying disease pathogenesis and for developing therapies.
Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a process that results from multi-valent weak
interactions, preferably between flexible polymers [11]‚Äì[14]. LLPS yields a polymerdilute and polymer-rich phase, where the latter is often observed in the form of droplets

and retains liquid-like mobility [15]‚Äì[20]. Such process has been found to be essential for
multiple cellular functions for the last 10 years [13], [21], [22]. However, its association
with amyloid aggregation has only recently become a focus [23]‚Äì[27], with the LLPS of
tau discovered and discussed only recently [28]‚Äì[34].
A recent study from our group and collaborators found that tau binds RNA in vivo and
undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro under a range of polymer
concentration, temperature, ionic strength and stoichiometry between RNA and tau [30].
We further mapped out its phase diagram by experiment and field-theoretic simulation.
The phase diagram revealed a narrow equilibrium window near cellular conditions,
demonstrating that cells can readily access conditions to assemble and dissolve tau-RNA
LLPS in vivo [31]. Meanwhile, Ambadipudi et al in 2017 [28] and Wegmann et al in 2018
[29] reported that tau can also undergo LLPS without RNA or other reactants under
physiological conditions. In these studies, the conditions for LLPS coincide with those for
amyloid aggregation, and therefore LLPS was postulated to mediate and facilitate
aggregation. Despite the observation that tau LLPS and amyloid formation occur in
sequential order, it is unclear whether LLPS facilitates aggregation of tau or if both
processes occur independently, but merely have overlapping conditions. This study sets
out to unravel whether LLPS influences the aggregation of tau and vice versa.
Results
Tau amyloid aggregation colocalizes with LLPS
We used truncated variants of the longest human tau isoform, 2N4R, that contains four
repeat domains (R1 to R4) and the entire C-terminal region (residues 255-441, named
tau187 here [35]) to study tau-polyanion liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and
amyloid aggregation. Four variants of tau187 were used in this work, as listed in (Table 1)
and summarized here: 1) tauS: tau187 with C291S mutation; 2) tauSS: tau187 with C291S
and C322S mutations; 3) tauSP301L: tauS with additional P301L mutation; 4)
tauSSP301L: tauSS with additional P301L mutation. At neutral pH, all four variants are
positively charged with an estimated +11 net charge per tau molecule, while full length
2N4R tau is estimated to have a +3 net positive charge per tau molecule (Table 1).
Tau has been reported to undergo LLPS with RNA under certain conditions. However,
whether this process is driven by tau-RNA specific association or is general to taupolyanion has not been explicitly tested. To answer this question, tauS was mixed with
various polyanions: poly(A) RNA, poly(dA) DNA, heparin and hyaluronic acid (Table 2).
The concentrations were chosen so that polyanion and tau reach approximately charge
neutrality, i.e., a charge ratio, R, of polyanion:tau of ~1. Immediately after mixing, the clear
solution became turbid within seconds, and when imaged under bright field microscope,
liquid condensates were visible (Figure 1A). They are characterized by clear round
boundaries and merging with each other in seconds. Hence, we refer to these as droplets.
Despite having completely different backbone and charged group chemistry, these
polyanions can all form droplets upon mixing with tau, suggesting LLPS can be relatively
independent of chemical identity, but rather rely on charge matching.

We incubated tauSS with heparin at a mixture that achieves net charge neutrality. Confocal
microscopy showed that droplets emerged and are retained after 16 hours immediately after
mixing (Figure 1B), as well as the localization of amyloid aggregates within the droplet
phase. All droplets showed strong fluorescence of ThT, with the fluorescence intensity
increase after overnight incubation. Replicas performed at room temperature consistently
showed colocalization of ThT fluorescence within droplets (Figure S1). These results
demonstrated that tau can undergo amyloid aggregation under conditions identical to that
for LLPS, and that the resulting amyloid aggregates colocalize within the dense droplets.
The extent of amyloid aggregation is independent of LLPS
Despite the observation that amyloid aggregates colocalized within tau droplets, it is not
clear whether this is simply because tau is present inside the droplets, or LLPS facilitates
aggregation, for instance, through favorable local physical/chemical properties. In the
following three sections, we explore whether or not the LLPS state changes tau
conformation before aggregation, changes kinetics during aggregation and alters the extent
of amyloid fibril formation. We present these questions in reverse order, by first asking
whether LLPS influences the quantity of amyloid fibrils formed.
We first investigated the phase behavior of tau-heparin LLPS, by titrating heparin against
tauS, and monitoring turbidity reading. The results showed that the turbidity peaks at a
charge ratio ùëÖ = 1 for heparin:tau (Figure S2A). At such a condition we prepared another
sample and varied the NaCl concentration and monitored turbidity reading. Results showed
that the turbidity steadily decreased with increasing [NaCl] to a baseline at [NaCl] > 40
mM (Figure S2B). The systematic effect of ionic strength in modulating intermolecular
association is a signature of polyelectrolyte complex coacervation‚Äîthe mechanism
identified for the LLPS of tau and RNA [31].
We next compared LLPS and amyloid aggregation of tau-heparin at varying stoichiometry
and ionic strength. We incubated 20 ŒºM of tauSS with heparin at room temperature at
neutral pH overnight on a microplate. We varied [NaCl] from 0 to 320 mM on each column
and varied [heparin] from ùëÖ = 0 to ùëÖ = 16 on each row. Turbidity and ThT fluorescence
of each sample were monitored (Figure S3). The average turbidity reading during the first
1 hour incubation was used to represent the relative amount of droplet, while the maximum
ThT fluorescence, extracted from fitting a sigmoidal curve to data (see Materials and
Methods), was used to represent the relative amount of amyloid aggregates. Both turbidity
and maximum ThT fluorescence were scaled 0 to 1 and presented in a scatter plot side by
side (Figure 2). A bivariate normal distribution was fitted and shown as red contour (see
Materials and Methods), indicating the condition preferring amyloid aggregation and
LLPS. The results showed that amyloid aggregation occurs at a much broader range of
[NaCl] and [heparin], while LLPS occurs at a small subset of these conditions (Figure 2
and Figure S3). The fitting results showed that the maximum position for amyloid
aggregation is distinct from that for LLPS, showing optimal LLPS is neither necessary nor
sufficient for optimal amyloid aggregation. To answer whether this observation is limited
to cysteine-free tau, we repeated it using tauS-heparin under non-reducing condition to

encourage disulfide bonding. The results showed again that amyloid aggregation occurs
under a broader range of [NaCl] and [heparin] at different optimal stoichiometry (Figure
S4). We can conclude that the extent of amyloid aggregation is independent of LLPS.
Half time and monomer dependence of amyloid aggregation are independent of
LLPS
LLPS results in the formation of concentrated and viscous droplets of tau and polyanions.
As high protein concentration tends to accelerate aggregation, while high viscosity tends
to decelerate assembly, it is not immediately obvious whether aggregation of tau in LLPS
droplets will slow down or speed up. TauSS-heparin droplets were prepared and mixed
with varying [NaCl] and ThT fluorescence and turbidity reading were analyzed. Turbidity
of samples were normalized to 1. For qualitative estimation, we regarded conditions where
turbidity falls above 0.3 as droplet conditions, and below 0.3 as non-droplet conditions. To
quantify the kinetics of tau aggregation, we used the time when ThT fluorescence reading
reaches half maximum, referred to as half time or t1/2 (see Materials and Methods).
We first investigated t1/2 while keeping [heparin] at R = 1 and R = 3 (Figure 3A). Results
showed that overall t1/2 increases with increasing [NaCl], regardless of [heparin].
Importantly, near the phase separation boundary, the t1/2 value under droplet condition was
not significantly different compared to the non-droplet condition (Figure 3A). Independent
repeats of the same conditions in (Figure 3A) showed similar results (Figure S5B).
Meanwhile, the dependence of t1/2 on [heparin] from R = 0.5 to R = 4 was also investigated,
and shown to be independent of LLPS formation (Figure 3B).
We point out small but reproducible non-linear dependence of t1/2 on [NaCl] under droplet
conditions (Figure S5B). Data at non-droplet conditions can be fitted to a linear regression
trend line (Figure S5B), which indicates the direct dependence of t1/2 on [NaCl]. Comparing
with the trend line, aggregation under droplet conditions appears slightly slower than
without phase separation.
The aggregation kinetics of many amyloid-forming proteins, including insulin [64], AÔÅ¢
[65], as well as tau [48], [66], [67], have been modeled by a nucleation-elongation process,
in which fibrils form through sequential addition of monomers to the nucleus [68]. The
slope of the log-log plot of half time vs initial monomer concentration, denoted scaling
exponent ùõæ, has been used to identify the dominant microscopic process in the overall
reaction [36], [69], [70]. A value for this slope ùõæ = 0 implies a completely saturated
dominant process [36], [48], meaning the rate of fibril formation is limited by the
interaction between the monomer and the interface of the nucleus, and the monomer
concentration is so high that the interface is fully occupied, resulting in an apparent
independence of t1/2 on monomer concentration. Meanwhile, ‚àí0.5 < ùõæ < 0 implies
reduced saturation and a recovery of the monomer dependence [36]. Here, we adopted the
nucleation-elongation model for tau aggregation and utilized Œ≥ to quantify the effects of
LLPS on the monomer dependence of aggregation. We varied the initial monomer
concentration of tau, [tau]0, keeping heparin at the same ratio R = 1, and recorded t1/2. Then,

we calculated Œ≥ from the slope of the log-log plot of t1/2 vs [tau]0. We used several [NaCl]
values so that aggregation kinetics is monitored under droplet to non-droplet conditions.
We prepared tauSS and heparin samples with [NaCl] = 0. Turbidity readings scaled linearly
with [tau]0, confirming that droplets formed (Figure S6A). ThT fluorescence of each
sample was monitored for 16 hours. The readings were normalized and fitted to extract t1/2
(Figure 3C) (see Materials and Methods). The log-log plot of t1/2 vs [tau]0 extracted from
(Figure 3C) resulted in data points that can be fit by linear regression with R2 = 0.64 to
extract Œ≥ (Figure 3D). We obtained Œ≥ = (‚àí0.11 ¬± 0.02) at [NaCl] = 0 under LLPS
conditions (Figure 3D). This implies that tau aggregation in LLPS conditions has minimal
monomer dependence. We further varied [NaCl] from 50 to 200 mM. At [NaCl] ‚â• 50 mM,
turbidity readings are independent of [tau]0, implying that droplet is absent (Figure S6A).
The log-log plot of t1/2 vs [tau]0 at all [NaCl] conditions from 50 to 200 mM can be fit
linearly with R2 above 0.64 to obtain Œ≥ (Figure S6C). We observed that Œ≥ changes from
(‚àí0.11 ¬± 0.03) at [NaCl] = 50 mM to (‚àí0.26 ¬± 0.04) at 200 mM, and can be linearly fit
with R2 = 0.84 (Figure 3E). This means the monomer dependence of aggregation at nondroplet conditions increases as the ionic strength increases. Importantly, Œ≥ under droplet
condition (‚àí0.11 ¬± 0.02) falls well within the confidence interval of linear regression
(Figure 3E), implying Œ≥ is altered by the change in ionic strength, but not by the state of
LLPS itself. In other words, the monomer dependence of the microscopic process depends
on the inter-molecular electrostatic interaction strength modulated by ionic strength, but
the increased protein concentration under LLPS is insufficient in and of itself to modulate
the microscopic processes governing tau aggregation.
Aggregation-signature conformation is independent of LLPS.
We have previously identified a structural signature of aggregation-prone tau conformers,
which consists of an opening of the flanking regions of the hydrophobic PHF6 and PHF6*
hexapeptide segments of tau [37]. We here assessed whether a similar conformational
change is triggered under LLPS conditions. Double electron-electron resonance (DEER)
spectroscopy is a powerful tool that measures intramolecular distances to report on a local
conformational ensemble [38], [39]. Here we used DEER to measure the distribution of
intra-molecular distances of the tau ensemble between residues 300 and 313, flanking both
sides of the PHF6 segment (i.e. 306VQIVYK311). We referred to the construct containing
spin labels at site 300 and 313 as tauSL2. The concept of this experiment was to measure
conformation around tau‚Äôs PHF6 segment immediately after adding a cofactor that either
triggers aggregation, LLPS, or both. The conformation of the PHF6 segment is used as a
proxy to evaluate aggregation-prone conformations of tau, as described in previous studies
[37]. For reference, two control samples were introduced: tauSL2 in the absence of
polyanion was used to represent PHF6 conformation of tau monomer in solution (referred
to as monomer); tauSL2 in fully aggregated tau-heparin fibrils (24h incubation) was used
to represent tau conformation in fibrils. The goal of this set of experiment was to reveal
whether the soluble aggregation-prone conformation can be correlated with LLPS.
The first DEER sample (sample I) was prepared by mixing the tauSL2 with heparin at a
ratio R = 1. A clear solution immediately became turbid, and light microscope confirmed

the abundance of droplets (Figure 4A, column 1). Replica were prepared and incubated
with ThT. Fluorescence showed that amyloid aggregates became gradually abundant after
overnight incubation. Within 5-10 minutes of preparation, the sample was flash frozen for
DEER measurements, while the ThT signal was minimal revealing the absence of
significant quantities of amyloid aggregates (Figure 4B, column 1). Both the DEER time
trace (Figure 4C, column 1) and the extracted distance distribution, P(r) (Figure 4D,
column 1) showed extended conformations, similar to conformation observed in fully
aggregated sample.
This observation is consistent with the previous report that tau adopts aggregation-prone
conformation at early stages of amyloid aggregation. The question is whether droplet
formation is related to, or presumably facilitating such conformation change. We next
prepared the second DEER sample by introducing 4 times more heparin (sample II) to
reach a ratio R = 4. Under this condition, LLPS did not occur (Figure 4A, column 2), while
ThT assay shows that aggregation is still triggered (Figure 4B, column 2). Despite the
absence of droplet, DEER signal and P(r) of the sample II resembled those of fibril sample
(Figure 4C, D, column 2). Clearly, droplet formation is not required for tau to adopt the
aggregation-prone signature conformation.
Sample III was prepared by incubating tau with hyaluronic acid at charge ratio R = 1.
Hyaluronic acid shares the same backbone and similar molecular weight as heparin (used
in sample I and II), but is free of sulphate groups (Table 2). By doing so, we created LLPS
(Figure 4A, column 3) without triggering amyloid aggregation (Figure 4B, column 3).
Despite the presence of droplet, the DEER signal and P(r) were found to be similar to those
of the monomer sample (Figure 4C, D, column 3). Clearly, droplet formation itself is not
sufficient to drive tau aggregation-prone conformation change. Together, these results
show that LLPS does not directly result in tau conformational changes associated with
enhanced aggregation propensity.
Amyloid aggregation can be modulated independently of droplet formation.
Knowing that LLPS has no direct impact on the conformational state of tau, aggregation
reaction rate of tau or final extent of amyloid aggregation, we hypothesized that LLPS and
amyloid aggregation are driven by distinct interactions. To test this hypothesis, we
modulated tau amyloid aggregation without disturbing the charge-charge interactions
between tau and polyanion. We then measured and compared their LLPS and amyloid
aggregation under the same experimental conditions.
We first compared 6-O-desulfated, 2-O-desulfated and N-desulfated-reN-acetylated
heparins, named 6OD, 2OD and ND, respectively (Table 2). They all have
glycosaminoglycan backbone with 2 sulfate and 1 carboxyl charged groups, resulting in an
identical charge density (3 e‚àí per disaccharide), but with different charge location on the
backbone (Table 2). According to the supplier, these desulfated heparins are products of
the same heparin after reaction with different enzymes. Consequently, they share similar
molecular weights. We identify the charge ratio of heparin to tau, R, to represent its
stoichiometry. When mixed with tauS under charge neutrality conditions, i.e., R = 1, all

three heparin variants make droplets with tau (Figure 5A). Furthermore, the titration of
different ratio R showed that desulfated heparins have indistinguishable turbidity on its
own for all R in the interval of 0 to 2 (Figure 5B). In other words, these three desulfated
heparins have similar LLPS propensity. However, incubation of tauS overnight with the
desulfated heparins at R = 1 resulted in dramatically different ThT fluorescence (Figure
5C). Notice 6-O-desulfated heparin has been reported to have lowest affinity with full
length tau 2N4R, compared with 2-O-desulfated and N-desulfated-reN-acetylated heparin
[40], while in our experimental conditions 6-O-desulfated heparin showed highest
aggregation propensity (Figure 5C). Regardless of the ordering, the observation is clear
that the different desulfated heparins yield similar turbidity upon LLPS with tau but
different ThT fluorescence, demonstrating that tau fibrillization can be modulated by
arranging the charged sufate group position on the glycosaminoglycan backbone, without
interfering with and without being affected by, LLPS.
We then asked whether the disease-associated P301L tau mutation influences the
propensity for tau to form LLPS. We compared RNA LLPS with tauS vs. with tauSP301L.
TauSP301L differs from tauS by a single P301L mutation‚Äîa well-known disease mutation
found in fronto temporal dementia [41], but has unaltered net positive charge (Table 1).
When mixed with RNA at ratio R = 1, both tauS and tauSP301L form droplets (Figure 5D).
Further titrating tau with varying R showed that both tau variants have similar LLPS
propensity (Figure 5E). However, incubation of two tau-RNA sample at R = 1 showed that
tauSP301L-RNA has ThT readings by 2 orders of magnitude higher than tauS-RNA
(Figure 5F). The much higher aggregation propensity of P301L variants of tau is well
known. These results together proved that amyloid aggregation can be modulated by
changing either the polyanion chemistry or the tau protein mutation without affecting LLPS
properties.
LLPS does not directly promote seeding.
Tau amyloid aggregation can be seeded, by adding premade fibrils in the aggregation
reaction, both in vivo [42]‚Äì[45] and in vitro [46]‚Äì[48]. In vitro seeding has a low efficiency
that was shown to be increased in the presence of a mild cofactor such as RNA [46], [49].
We asked the question whether LLPS is involved and facilitatory for such enhancements.
To solve this question, we compared seeding enhancement with RNA between droplet and
non-droplet conditions. TauSSP301L was incubated with heparin overnight to prepare
fully aggregated tau fibrils as the seed. 5% seed was incubated with tauSSP301L to trigger
seeding reaction with and without RNA. This reaction was carried out at several [NaCl],
two of which conditions produced droplets (0 and 50 mM, Figure S7) while two other
concentrations did not (100 and 150 mM). As expected, ThT fluorescence of seeded
aggregation with RNA as an added cofactor was significantly enhanced compared to
seeding without RNA (Figure 6). This enhancement, although decreasing with increasing
salt, was still visible in non-droplet conditions and therefore did not appear to be correlated
with the formation of LLPS. These results demonstrated that LLPS is not necessary for
cofactor-enhanced in vitro seeding.

Discussion
Tau droplets and amyloid aggregates have been found to occur simultaneously [28], [29],
but it was unclear whether droplets are on pathway towards aggregates. Our work
demonstrated that LLPS and amyloid aggregation can be two independent processes that
influence each other indirectly. We proposed possible underlying mechanisms.
First, we propose that LLPS and tau amyloid aggregation are driven by distinct interactions.
This is supported by the observation that tau-heparin amyloid aggregation occurs at ionic
strength up to 160 mM, while [NaCl] = 50 mM is enough to completely eliminate LLPS
(Figure 2). The common preference for low ionic strength is consistent with previous
studies [50], [51], and explains why these two processes are often observed under
overlapping experimental conditions. However, the Debye lengths (the characteristic
distance between two point charges in solution beyond which electrostatic interaction
becomes negligible [52]) of 160 mM and 50 mM NaCl are approximately 0.76 nm and 1.36
nm [52], corresponding to the estimated contour length of 2 and 3.6 amino acids,
respectively [53]. Therefore, it is likely that amyloid aggregation is mediated by a shorter
range of electrostatic interactions than LLPS conditions can invoke or modulate.
Furthermore, the stability of amyloid aggregate is known to originate from the interbackbone hydrogen bond network [54], [55] assisted by specific side-chain interactions
[56], [57]. In contrast, complex coacervation of tau and polyanion is dominantly controlled
by long-range, weaker and multivalent electrostatic interactions [30], [31]. This explains
the result that tau amyloid aggregation is sensitive to change in the site-specific charge
location or distribution on polyanion cofactors, and is sensitive to specific mutation on tau
(Figure 5), while LLPS is more tolerant to those variations.
Second, tau-polyanion LLPS and amyloid aggregation may have separated pathways.
Aggregation-prone conformation is associated with amyloid aggregation regardless of
LLPS (Figure 4), suggesting LLPS does not directly change tau conformation. This is
consistent with the recent reports that the conformations of polyelectrolyte chains under
complex coacervate is highly similar to that in solution [58], [59]. Meanwhile we observed
that the optimal stoichiometry of heparin that facilitates amyloid aggregation is very
different from that for LLPS (Figure 2). This is consistent with the previous observations
that tau-polyanion LLPS favors stoichiometry that meets net charge balancing [30], while
tau-heparin amyloid aggregation proceeds via a defined molar ratio of tau and heparin,
likely mediated by directed conformational templating [49], [50]. The distinct
conformation change and optimal stoichiometry suggest these two processes are governed
by distinct mechanisms.
Notice that the independence of LLPS on amyloid aggregation might be specific to the taucofactor system that proceed via complex coacervation. LLPS can be achieved using solely
tau with specific truncation [28], crowding reagent [60] or post-translational modifications
(PTMs) [29]. Such simple coacervation relies on tau-tau interactions that are unlikely
dominant in complex coacervation. This explains the conformation changes [28], [34] and
subsequent amyloid aggregates [28], [29] observed in the simple coacervation of tau.

While our work shows that LLPS and aggregation have distinct driving forces, the two
processes most likely interfere when occurring simultaneously. We observed a small but
significant change in the aggregation half time within droplets (Figure S5). We proposed
such change may result from two counter-acting properties of droplets: 1) LLPS creates a
high concentration environment, which increase collision probabilities and may speed up
amyloid aggregation; 2) Such compartment may also have high viscosity, which reduces
the diffusion of tau, and therefore slows down aggregation. The potential opposite effects
of these two properties explain the small change in the reaction rate for aggregation in
LLPS.
Complex coacervation permits the concentration and colocalization of two or more
compounds that have matching charge patterns into so-called membrane less organelles
[13]. This concentration effect is likely to have a much more prominent effect in a cellular
context than under in vitro experiment where only two purified compounds are present (tau
and RNA) at 10s of ŒºM. Firstly, the concentration of unbound tau in neurons can be
heterogeneous and orders of magnitude lower than values in our experiments, giving little
probability for tau-tau collisions and interactions (necessary step of aggregation) to occur,
unless there is a mechanism of colocalization of tau, possibly in the form of LLPS.
Secondly, it has been recently pointed out that tau fiber might naturally incorporate
cofactors that may change the dependence between the aggregation and LLPS processes
[10], [49]. In addition, the colocalization and concentration of enzymes could promote
PTMs, such as phosphorylation [61], that can be connected to tau aggregation. LLPS might
be an essential step to mix tau and pathologically relevant cofactors that become part of or
facilitate tau aggregation, or regulate other essential processes. What our study is showing
is that the physical properties of LLPS of tau is not in and of itself providing a mechanistic
basis and driving factors for enhanced aggregation kinetics or propensity. If there is a role
that LLPS plays in the aggregation process of tau, it would be on the basis of the interplay
of biological factors.
Conclusion
In this work we showed that tau is able to undergo LLPS with a wide range of polyanions
tested. Among these polyanions, only a subset can facilitate tau amyloid aggregation.
Under LLPS conditions, amyloid aggregates do colocalize with the tau droplets. By
establishing a 2-dimensional map (ionic strength and stoichiometry) of LLPS and amyloid
aggregation, we found that the state of LLPS does not change the extent of amyloid
aggregation. We found that the half time for aggregation kinetics is insignificantly altered,
nor is the monomer dependency of the dominant microscopic processes during aggregation
affected in the LLPS state. By double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy, we
showed that LLPS does not induce the characteristic tau conformational rearrangements
consisting in an opening of the PHF6(*) segments, which have been previously
demonstrated to be aggregation-prone signatures for tau. We also modulated amyloid
aggregation propensity by either changing the polyanion type or by introducing disease
mutations to tau without affecting its length or charge density. By doing so we found that
the state of LLPS does not affect the kinetics nor propensity for amyloid aggregation. We

furthermore studied the seeding activity of tau under aggregation-prone conditions, and
found that LLPS also does not directly enhance seeding activity.

Materials and Methods
Protein expression and purification.
In this work, we used an N-terminal truncated form of tau, tau187, containing the
microtubule binding domain (residues 255-441 from the longest human tau isoform 2N4R
with a 6√ó His-tag at the N-terminus). Site-directed mutagenesis was applied to prepare the
following mutated variants of tau187: tauS contains C291S mutation; tauSP301L contains
C291S and P301L mutations; tauSS contains C291S and C322S mutations; tauSSP301L
contains C291S, C322S and P301L mutations; tau187V300CV313C contains C291S,
C322S, V300C and V313C mutations. The names and estimated charge properties are
listed in (Table 1).
We followed the previously reported methods for expression and purification of tau187
[35], [49], [62], [63]. DNA variants were constructed and used to transfect E. coli BL21
(DE3) cells. Cells were stored as frozen glycerol stock at ‚àí80 ¬∞C. Cells from glycerol stock
were grown in 10 mL luria broth (LB, Sigma Aldrich, L3022) overnight and then used to
inoculate 1 L of fresh LB. Cells were grown at 37 ¬∞C, 200 rpm with addition of 10 Œºg/mL
kanamycin (Fisher Scientific, BP906) until optical density OD600 reached 0.6‚Äì0.8. Next 1
mM isopropyl-√ü-D-thiogalactoside (Fisher Bioreagents, BP175510) was added to induce
expression. After incubation for 2‚Äì3 h, cells were palleted with centrifugation at 5000 g at
4 ¬∞C for 20 min. Harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (Tris-HCl, pH = 7.4,
100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA) added with 1 Pierce protease inhibitor tablet
(Thermo Scientific, A32965), 1 mM PMSF, 2 mg/mL lysozyme, 20 Œºg/mL DNase (Sigma,
DN25) and 10 mM MgCl2 (10 mM). Samples were incubated on ice for 30 min, then frozen
in liquid nitrogen and thawed in room temperature for 3 cycles. Cell debris was removed
by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm at 4 ¬∞C for 10 min. 1 mM PMSF was added again and
samples were heated at 65 ¬∞C for 12 min and cooled on ice for 20 min. Cooled samples
were then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min to remove the precipitant. The resulting
supernatant was incubated overnight with Ni-NTA resins pre-equilibrated in buffer A
(20 mM sodium phosphate, pH = 7.0, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 100 ŒºM EDTA).
The resins were loaded to a column and washed with 20 mL of buffer A, 25 mL buffer B
(20 mM sodium phosphate, pH = 7.0, 1 M NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM DTT, 100 ŒºM
EDTA). Purified protein was eluted with 15 mL of buffer C (20 mM sodium phosphate,
pH = 7.0, 0.5 mM DTT, 100 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole). Eluents were analyzed by
SDS-PAGE to collect the pure fractions. Proteins were then buffer exchanged into DTT-

Preparation of tau-polyanion droplets and microscope imaging.
We used the following polyanions in this work for studying LLPS and amyloid
aggregation: PolyA RNA (MW 66 ~ 660 kDa, Sigma, P9403); PolyU RNA (MW
800~1000 kDa, Sigma, P9528); PolydA single strand DNA (MW 83~165 kDa, Sigma,
10223581001); Hyaluronic acid (MW 8~15 kDa, Sigma, 40583). Besides, heparin, 6-Odesulfated heparin, 2-O-desulfated heparin and N-desulfated reN-acetylated heparin are all
polydisperse, with average MW ~15 kDa and from Galen laboratory supplies under the
reference number, HEP001, DSH002/6, DSH001/2 and DSH004/NAc, respectively. The
primary chemical structure and charge properties were listed in (Table 2).
We followed the previously reported method for preparing tau-polyanion droplets for
microscope imaging [30], [31]. The charge per mass at neutral pH of all tau variants was
estimated using Innovagen‚Äôs Peptide Property Calculator (http://pepcalc.com/). The charge
per mass for polyanions were estimated assuming all charged groups are fully ionized and
negatively charged. For microscope imaging, polyanions were mixed with tau in certain
mass ratio, as stated. Images were taken within 10 minutes after mixing. Bright-field
images were acquired using an inverted compound microscope (Olympus IX70). Confocal
images were acquired using a spectral confocal microscope (Olympus Fluoview 1000).
Images of ThT fluorescence were taken using Œªemission=485 nm.
Turbidity measurement and ThT assays
Tau, polyanions and NaCl were mixed and pipetted onto a micro plate (Corning, 3844).
Absorbance at 500 nm and fluorescence intensity (excitation 440 nm, emission 485 nm)
were both monitored using a Bio-Tek Synergy 2 microplate reader, with temperature
maintained at 26.0 ¬∞C. Absorbance was used as turbidity reading, while fluorescence used
as ThT fluorescence.
Along with each run of microplate reader, an equal volume of buffer with same
concentration of ThT was added to the plate and used as control. Turbidity reading of the
control were subtracted from the turbidity reading of each sample. ThT fluorescence
reading from each sample were corrected by the control reading, in order to reduce the
artifact from lamp drift/fluctuation, following the two equations below.

We applied the following steps to extract the half time and maximum ThT fluorescence.
First, for each well of the microplate, the first 10 minutes of the above lamp-corrected
readings were averaged and used as a baseline, assuming no amyloid aggregates formed
during this time. Next the baselines of each well were subtracted from the ThT readings.

Third, the maximal ThT readings of the entire microplate during the entire incubation was
used to divide all the readings, scaling to 0-1. Fourth, the following sigmoid function was
used to fit all the readings, using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, provided by nls.lm
function in minpack.lm package, with initial guess (ùê¥ = 1, ùë°1/2 = 5, ùëò = 1)

where the fitted A and t1/2 were used as maximum ThT fluorescence and half time,
respectively. The fitted results were visually examined to ensure a good fit.
Double Electron Electron Resonance (DEER).
Tau187V300CV313C was expressed as other tau187 mutants and spin labeled as follow.
Tau was freshly purified and treated with 5 mM TCEP. TCEP was removed using a PD-10
desalting column. Immediately after PD-10, 10√ó to 15√ó molar excess of MTSL ((1Acetoxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-Œ¥-3-pyrroline-3-methyl) Methanethiosulfonate, Toronto
Research Chemicals, O875000) to free cysteine was incubated with the protein at 4C
overnight. After incubation, excess MTSL was removed using a PD-10 desalting column.
Labelling efficiency, defined as the molar ratio of tethered spin labels over the cysteines,
was measured to be 50-60%Tau187C291SC322S (cysteine-less tau construct, referred to
as cysless). Both two protein stocks were concentrated, and buffer exchanged against D2Obased buffer (20 mM HEPES in D2O) using Amicon centrifugal concentrators (10 kDa
cutoff). A 1:22 molar ratio of tau-SL2:tau-cysless sample of 10 ŒºM tau-SL2 and 2100 ŒºM
tau-cysless was mixed with polyanions at designated concentrations and incubated for
designated time. 28 ŒºL samples were mixed with 12 ÔÅ≠L D8-glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich)
before transferring to a quartz tube (2 mm i.d.) and frozen using liquid nitrogen.
Four-pulse DEER experiments were carried out at 85 K using the Q-band Bruker E580
Elexsys pulse EPR spectrometer operating at ~34 GHz and equipped with a 300 W TWT
amplifier. The following DEER pulse sequence was used: œÄobs/2 ‚Äì œÑ1 ‚Äì œÄobs ‚Äì (t-œÄpump) ‚Äì (œÑ2t) ‚Äì œÄobs ‚Äì œÑ2 ‚Äì echo. Rectangular observe pulses were used with lengths set to œÄobs/2 = 1012 ns and œÄobs = 20-24 ns. A chirp œÄpump pulse was applied with a length of 20-24 ns and a
frequency width of 60 MHz. The observe frequency was 90 MHz higher than the center of
the pump frequency range. œÑ1 was 180 ns and œÑ2 was set to 2.4 ms. The DEER experiment
was accumulated for ~12 h. The background-subtracted data were fitted assuming a
Gaussian distribution of the inter-spin distances. The analysis was done using the
LongDistance software (http://www.chemistry.ucla.edu/directory/hubbell-wayne-l).
In vitro seeding
20 ŒºM tauSSP301L was preincubated with 5 ŒºM heparin overnight to prepare tau-heparin
fibrils. Pre-incubated tau-heparin fibrils were used as the seed for seeding experiment. 5%
(molar ratio) of seed was mixed with freshly prepared tau monomer and designated
concentration of polyanions in the presence of 20 ŒºM ThT and different concentration of
NaCl. Both turbidity and fluorescence were monitored using microplate reader.
