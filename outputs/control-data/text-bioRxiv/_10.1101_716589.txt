Summary
The amygdala is a brain area critical for the formation of threat memories. However,
the nature of the teaching signal(s) that drive plasticity in the amygdala are still under
debate. Here, we use optogenetic methods to investigate whether dopamine release
in the amygdala contributes to fear learning. Antero- and retrograde labeling showed
that a sparse, and relatively evenly distributed population of ventral tegmental area
(VTA) neurons projects to the basal amygdala (BA). In-vivo optrode recordings in
behaving mice showed that many VTA neurons, amongst them putative dopamine
neurons, are excited by footshocks. Correspondingly, in-vivo fiber photometry of
dopamine in the BA revealed robust dopamine concentration transients upon
footshock presentation. Finally, silencing VTA dopamine neurons, or their axon
terminals in the BA during the footshock, reduced the extent of threat memory
retrieval one day later. Thus, VTA dopamine neurons projecting to the BA code for
the saliency of the footshock event, and the resulting dopamine release in the BA
facilitates threat memory formation.

Introduction
Animals must predict dangers in their environment to ensure survival; for this reason,
powerful mechanisms of harm detection and fear learning have evolved in animals
(Feinberg and Mallatt, 2017). During auditory cued fear learning, an innocuous
sensory percept like a tone (the conditioned stimulus, CS), acquires a negative
emotional valence, and will elicit a defensive behavior after pairing with an aversive
outcome, like a mild footshock (the unconditioned stimulus, US) (LeDoux, 2000;
Tovote et al., 2015). The amygdala has been identified as a brain structure with an
important role in fear learning (Davis, 1992; LeDoux, 2000; Duvarci and Paré, 2014;
Tovote et al., 2015). Action potential (AP) firing in response to a tone is increased in
many lateral amygdala (LA) and BA neurons during - and after fear conditioning
protocols (Quirk et al., 1995; Amano et al., 2011; Grewe et al., 2017). It is thought
that synapses in the LA that code for the CS undergo LTP, and then drive increased
LA neuron firing upon CS presentation (Rumpel et al., 2005; Sigurdsson et al., 2007;
Nabavi et al., 2014). The nature of the synaptic- and/or neuromodulatory signal that
instructs plasticity in the LA and BA is currently investigated (Herry and Johansen,
2014). This "teaching signal" for plasticity is likely represented, on the one hand, by

depolarizing inputs coding for the US, which can induce associative plasticity. Indeed,
footshock stimulation causes cfos expression in a sparse, but distinct neuronal
population in the LA and BA (Gore et al., 2015). Furthermore, we have recently
identified a glutamatergic synaptic input from the insular cortex as a candidate
pathway for one such "depolarizing" teaching signal in the LA (Berret et al., 2019).
In addition to direct glutamatergic depolarization of LA- and BA neurons, behaviorally
salient stimuli like footshocks recruit several neuromodulatory systems, which,
amongst other target areas, project to the BA and LA where they can facilitate the
acquisition of threat memories (Johansen et al., 2014). Recent work has shown that
both acetylcholine and noradrenaline, acting in the LA and/or BA, facilitate the
formation of fear memories (Jiang et al., 2016; Uematsu et al., 2017). We wished to
investigate whether dopamine acting in the amygdala might be an additional
neuromodulator that facilitates the formation of threat memories.
Dopamine neurons in the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA) are a heterogenous
population that project to the prefrontal cortex, the Nucleus acumbens ( NAc) and the
amygdala (Asan, 1998; Wise, 2004); (Lammel et al., 2011; Lammel et al., 2012; Beier
et al., 2015), and the different dopaminergic projections can be involved in both
appetitively and aversively motivated behavior. Early evidence for a role of dopamine
signaling in the amygdala during aversive learning came from measurements of
enhanced dopamine in the basolateral amygdala and in the NAc after stressful stimuli
(Young and Rees, 1998; Inglis and Moghaddam, 1999; de Oliveira et al., 2011), and
from infusion of dopamine receptor antagonists in the amygdala that reduced fear
learning (Lamont and Kokkinidis, 1998; Guarraci et al., 1999; Nader and LeDoux,
1999; Heath et al., 2015). However, classical studies in monkeys and rats have found
a role for VTA dopamine neurons in reward processing (Schultz, 1998; Wise, 2004),
and some studies found that VTA dopamine neurons are inhibited by aversive stimuli
(Mirenowicz and Schultz, 1996; Schultz, 1998; Ungless et al., 2004; Tan et al., 2012).
Thus, a role of dopamine neurons in aversively motivated behavior has remained
somewhat controversial, despite evidence from genetic manipulations indicating a
role of the dopamine system in aversive learning (Fadok et al., 2009; Zweifel et al.,
2011), and despite findings that some dopamine neurons in the VTA are excited by
aversive stimuli (Guarraci and Kapp, 1999; Brischoux et al., 2009; Gore et al., 2014);

see (Horvitz, 2000), for an insightful early review). In the present study, we have used
optogenetic methods, in-vivo optrode recordings, in-vivo fiber photometry and circuit
mapping techniques to investigate the role of a VTA to BA dopaminergic projection in
auditory cued fear learning.

Materials and Methods
Animals. All procedures with laboratory animals (mus musculus) were authorized by
the veterinary office of the Canton of Vaud, Switzerland (authorizations 2885.0 and
3274.0). The following mouse lines were used in this study: 1) DAT-internal ribosome
entry site (IRES)-Cre line (B6.SJL-Slc6a3tm1.1(cre)Bkmn/J, Jackson Lab #006660) called
here DATCre mice (Bäckman et al., 2006); 2) Cre-dependent channelrhodopsin 2
reporter line (Rosa26:lsl:ChR2-eYFP, Jackson Lab #024109, also known as Ai32)
called here ChR2-eYFP mice (Madisen et al., 2012); 3) C57Bl6/J wild type mice
(Jackson Lab #000664). All experimental mice were virgin males, group-housed
under a 12/12 hr light/dark cycle with food and water ad libitum until separated into
single cages one day before surgery.
Viral vectors. For Cre-dependent expression of Arch in DAT+ neurons (Figs. 3, 4), an
AAV1:CBA:FLEX:Arch-GFP vector was used (UPenn [Addgene], cat. no. AV-1PV2432 [22222-AAV1]). In mice for the control groups (Figs. 3, 4) and for
anterograde tracing (Fig. 1), eGFP expression was driven in DAT+ neurons by an
AAV1:CAG:FLEX-eGFP vector (UPenn [Addgene], cat. no. AV-1-ALL854 [51502AAV1]). For in-vivo fiber photometry of dopamine release (Fig. 5), an
AAV5:hsyn:dLight1.2 vector was used (Addgene; cat. no. 111068-AAV5).
Virus injection and optic fiber implantation. The age of the mice at surgery was 42-49
days. For in-vivo optogenetic silencing experiments virus was injected into the VTA of
DATCre mice, and optic fibers were implanted unilaterally above the VTA (Fig. 3), or
else bilaterally above the BA or bilaterally above the central amygdala (CeA) during
the same surgery session (Fig. 4). The fiber coordinates were: AP -1.66 mm, ML
±3.35 mm, DV 3.65 mm for BA, or AP -1.36 mm, ML ±2.85 mm, DV 3.65 mm for CeA
(DV measured from the dura surface). The animals were randomly assigned to a
"control group" or to an "Arch group", injected respectively with AAV1:CAG:FLEXeGFP or AAV1: CBA:FLEX:Arch-GFP virus (see above). All other procedures were

the same between the control - and the test groups. Stereotaxic surgeries with a
model 940 stereotactic instrument (Kopf Instruments, USA) followed the procedures
described in Berret et al. (2019). Virus suspension (200 - 400 nl) was injected
unilaterally into the VTA at coordinates relative to bregma: AP -3.3 mm; ML -0.35
mm; DV 4.2-4.6 mm (DV measured from the dura surface).
Fiber optic implants for in-vivo optogenetic silencing were custom made from a 200
µm core / 0.39 NA / 230

m outer diameter optic fiber (FT200EMT; Thorlabs) and

1.25 mm outer diameter ceramic ferrules (CFLC230; Thorlabs) as described (Sparta
et al., 2012). Yellow light was produced by a 561 nm diode pumped solid state
(DPSS) laser (MGL-FN-561-AOM-100mW, CNI Lasers, China) equipped with an
AOM and an additional mechanical shutter (SHB05T; Thorlabs) as described
previously (Berret et al., 2019). The laser power was adjusted to 10 mW after the
implant tip for each individual animal.

The optrode implantation procedure into the VTA (Fig. 2) was similar to the VTA fiber
implantation, with an additional stainless steel microscrew (Antrin Miniature
Specialties, CA, USA) with a soldered copper ground wire implanted into the skull.
Behavior. Behavioral experiments were performed after 3-4 weeks of post-surgical
recovery period. Prior to behavior testing, animals were habituated to handling and to
the head tethering with the optic patch cords. A classical auditory cued threat
memory paradigm was performed in a conditioning chamber of a NIR Video Fear
Conditioning Optogenetics Package for Mouse (MED-VFC-OPTO-M, Med Associates
Inc., VT, USA). The 3-day protocol consisted of the following steps (see Fig. 3F). On
Day 1, the animal was subjected to a habituation session when six tone blocks (CS)
were delivered at pseudo-random intervals in a context A. Each tone block consisted
of 30 beeps (7 kHz, 80 dB, 100 ms long, repeated at 1 Hz for 30 s). On Day 2 (the
same context A), each of the 30s tone blocks was followed by a 1s - long mild electric
footshock applied through the metal grid floor of the conditioning chamber (0.6 mA
AC). On Day 3, four CS tone blocks were delivered in a new context B. For this, the
grid floor was replaced with a smooth white acrylic floor, and a curved wall was
installed instead of a square arena used in the context A. The Context A chamber

was cleaned before and after each session with 70% ethanol, whereas the Context B
chamber was cleaned with a general purpose soap. On some occasions, we tested
the retrieval of contextual threat memory on Day 4 by monitoring the animal's
freezing behavior in context A for 5 min (Fig. 3F).
Freezing was quantified using VideoFreeze® software (Med Associates) from the
recorded videos of behaving mice (30 frames/sec). The freezing level (Figs. 2 - 5)
was expressed as the percentage of time the mouse spent freezing during the CS
presentation (30 s - long tone block).
Optrode recordings. For recording extracellular spiking activity in the VTA (Fig. 2), we
used a 16-channel amplifier (ME16-FAI-µPA; Multi Channel Systems, Germany) and
custom-built microdrive mounted optrodes. The general design to build the optrodes
followed (Anikeeva et al., 2012); specific manufacturing steps and materials were
described in Berret et al. (2019). We used ChR2 expression in DAT+ neurons to
optogenetically identify recorded units (DATCre x ChR2-eYFP mice). In one case a
DATCre mouse (FT6963) was injected with AAV8:hsyn:FLEX:ChETA-eYFP; this
vector was custom packaged in the lab of Dr. B. Schneider (EPFL).
One day before the behaviour testing, the optrode was re-positioned under ketamine
anesthesia (90 mg/g body weight ketamine and 10 mg/g xylazine) to search for optotagged units in the VTA by advancing it ventrally from the initial implantation site. The
optrode was slowly advanced until light-evoked spikes could be detected at a latency
of 2-8 ms (see Fig. 2B-C). Opto-tagging was done by delivering short (2-5 ms, 3-10
mW) light pulses at 2 Hz repetition rate, from a 473 nm DPSS laser (MBL-FN-473150mW; CNI Lasers). The opto-tagging procedure was repeated after each
behaviour session (without advancing the optrode in the later sessions) to collect
light-evoked spikes in response to ~2000 light pulses.
Raw data was recorded with a MC_Rack software (MultiChannel Systems) at 40 kHz
sampling rate, and was band-pass filtered (0.6-6 kHz) before the analysis. Off-line
analysis was performed in IgorPro 7.08 (Wavemetrics, OR, US) as described
previously (Berret et al., 2019). Spike waveforms were clustered using a MClust
toolbox (Dr. David Redish; University of Minnesota, USA) running KlustaKwik

algorithm (Rossant et al., 2016) under MATLAB (MathWorks, USA). The quality of
the clusters was assessed by computing the isolation distance (ID) and L-ratio to
control for type I and type II clustering errors (Schmitzer-Torbert et al., 2005); only
clusters with ID > 24 and L-ratio < 0.5 were retained.
Response types of the units to sensory stimuli were classified according to the
following criteria. i) The unit was considered US-responsive if the time-averaged zscore during the 1s - long footshock calculated from the average post-stimulus timing
histograms of six US presentations on Day 2 exceeded a value of + 2. ii) For the CS
response classification, average z-scores over 100 ms - long tones were calculated
from 30 aligned and averaged tone responses. A unit was considered CS-entrained
if, first, the z-score did not exceed 2 for at least five out of six CS presentations on
Day 1 (i.e. the unit was not innately responsive to sound), and, second, if out of the
last three tone presentations on Day 2, at least two resulted in a summed z-score
larger than 4 (i.e. tone response increased on Day 2 as a result of training), or if at
least two tone presentations on Day 3 resulted in a summed z-score larger than 4
(i.e. the tone response was maintained on Day 3).
Fiber photometry measurements of dopamine release. For in-vivo fiber photometry,
an AAV5:hsyn:dLight1.2 vector (Patriarchi et al., 2018) was injected into the left BA of
C57Bl6/J mice (250 nl; 4·1012 particles / ml; coordinates relative to bregma: AP -1.35
mm; ML -3.3 mm; DV 5.2 mm). Photometry optic fibers were made from a 400
core / 0.5 NA / 440

m

m o.d. fiber (FP400URT; Thorlabs) and a 1.25 mm stainless

steel ferrule (SFLC440; Thorlabs).
The optical setup was based on a modified Mightex OASIS tilting microscope
(Mightex Systems, Toronto, Canada). Excitation light was generated by two
collimated BioLED modules: a 470 nm emitter (BLS-LCS-0470-15-22, Mightex
Systems), and a custom fitted 408 nm UV-emitter (LZ4-40UB00-00U8, LED Engin
Inc, San Jose, CA, USA). The beams of the two LEDs were combined using a multiwavelength combiner (LCS series, Mightex Systems) and further coupled via a light
guide into a 40 x objective (LUMPlanFL N, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The objective
formed an image of the end of the 400 µm core optic fiber onto an EM-enhanced
CCD camera (C9100-13, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan; operated at

100 frames/sec under the MicroManager software; (Edelstein et al., 2014). A 495 nm
dichroic mirror and a 525/50 nm GFP emission filter (Chroma Technology) were used
to separate 408 and 470 nm excitation from the fluorescence of the dLight1.2 probe.
The LEDs were driven by a two-channel LED driver (BLS-1000-2, Mightex Systems)
under control of a Master-8 stimulator (A.M.P.I., Jerusalem, Israel) to generate 7 ms
long light pulses at 408 nm, 470 nm plus a dark exposure. The LED power was
calibrated to 100 µW at the tip of the implant for both wavelengths. The effective
sampling rate after multiplexing the wavelengths was ~33 Hz. The timestamps of
LED pulses, CCD exposures, and the TTL signals from the fear conditioning chamber
(Med Associates) were recorded by an EPC-10 patch-clamp amplifier (HEKA
Elektronik; Germany).
Off-line analysis of photometry signals was done with custom routines in IgorPro
(WaveMetrics). Bleaching and other slow drifts in the signal were removed by fitting
3rd - 5th order polynomials to the background-subtracted 470 nm and 408 nm
fluorescence traces. The 408 nm fluorescence signal was scaled with the ratio of the
standard deviations of the 470 and 408 nm traces, and then subtracted from the 470
nm signal. The resulting corrected 470 nm signal was used to calculate F/F0 traces
that were subsequently low-pass filtered at 8 Hz for display purpose (Fig. 5).
Retrograde tracing, immunohistochemistry and histological analysis. For retrograde
labeling (Fig. 1G-L), Alexa Fluor-conjugated cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) was used
(CTB–Alexa 647; Thermo Fisher Scientific). CTB was unilaterally injected into the BA
of a DATCre x ChR2-eYFP mouse, at the coordinates from bregma: AP -1.05 mm, ML
3.25 mm, DV -5.18 mm (250 nl of 0.1% dilution in PBS). Seven days after CTB
injection, the brains were dissected and processed for histological analysis.
Immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1A-F) and post-hoc histology to confirm the viral
targeting and optic fiber placement (Figs. 2-5) were done according to standard
procedures after transcardial perfusion of mice with 4% paraformaldehyde. The
following primary antibodies were used: chicken anti-GFP (cat. 13970; Abcam;
1:1000 dilution) and rabbit anti-TH (cat. AB152; Millipore; 1:1000 dilution). Secondary
fluorescently tagged antibodies were: goat anti-chicken Alexa-488 (cat. A11039) and
goat anti-rabbit Alexa-647 (cat. A21244; both from Thermo Fisher Scientific), used at

1:200 dilution. Slices were mounted in Dako fluorescence mounting medium (Dako,
Glostrup, Denmark).
Histological sections were imaged at the Bioimaging and Optics Platform (BIOP),
EPFL. For cell counting (Fig. 1), the images were taken on an upright LSM 700
confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) with 20x / 0.8 NA dry and 40x / 1.3 NA oil
immersion objectives. Quantification of eGFP and TH colocalization in the VTA (Fig.
1) was performed by using an automated ImageJ routine (provided by Olivier Burri,
BIOP, EPFL). For the post-hoc histological analysis (Figs. 2-5), slices were imaged
with a stitching fluorescence microscope DM5500 (Leica) using 5x / 0.15 NA or 10x /
0.3 NA objectives, or using a Slide Scanner VS120-L100 (Olympus) with a 10x / 0.4
NA objective.
Ex-vivo electrophysiology. For slice electrophysiology, 300 µm thick slices containing
the VTA were made from 3-4 months old mice previously injected with
AAV1:CBA:FLEX:Arch-eGFP, using a Leica VT1000S slicer (Leica Microsystems,
Wetzlar, Germany). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of VTA neurons were done at
room temperature (21 - 23°C) with a K-gluconate based pipette solution, and a
standard bicarbonate buffered extracellular. The set-up was equipped with an
EPC10/2 patch-clamp amplifier (HEKA Elektronik), and an upright microscope
(Axioskop 2, Carl Zeiss, Germany) with a 60x / 0.9 NA water-immersion objective
(LUMPlanFl, Olympus, Japan). For activation of Arch (Fig. 3B), yellow light pulses
were delivered from a high-power LED (Amber CREE XP-E2 PC, 595 nm; Cree Inc,
NC, USA), coupled to the epifluorescence port of the microscope. The LED was
controlled with a Cyclops LED driver (Open-Ephys.org; (Newman et al., 2015). The
maximal light intensity used in experiments was estimated to be 1.24 mW/mm2 at the
focal plane. The electrophysiological recordings were analyzed in IgorPro using
NeuroMatic plug-in (Rothman and Silver, 2018).
Experimental design and statistical analysis. No previous sample size calculation was
performed. Optogenetic silencing experiments with Arch (Figs. 3H, I; 4C, D; 4G, H)
were usually performed in small "cohorts" of n = 3 and n = 3 mice for "control group"
and "Arch group". Usually, repeating such cohorts 2 - 3 times, giving rise to n = 6 - 9
mice in the control group and n = 6 - 9 mice in the Arch group, was found necessary

to determine if silencing induced a significant change in the Arch group as compared
to the control group (Figs. 3H, I; 4C, D), or not (Fig. 4G, H).
Replicates often refer to the number of mice or else to the number of cells as
indicated in the Results section; in these cases, replicates are biological replicates.
Sometimes, technical replicates such as the number of sections analyzed are also
indicated in the Results.
Statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, CA,
USA). The data were expressed as mean ± s.e.m. For the statistical analysis of the
optogenetic silencing data (Figs. 3H, 4C, 4G), a repeated measures two-way ANOVA
was used, followed by a post-hoc Bonferroni test for multiple comparisons.
Additionally, for the analysis of cued retrieval (Figs. 3I, 4D, 4H), the freezing data in
response to all n = 4 tone blocks applied on day 3 were pooled, and averaged for
each group; in this case, a two-tailed heteroscedastic two-sample Students-t-test was
used (referred to as "t-test" in Results). The data in Fig. 5F was analyzed by a oneway repeated measures ANOVA (p < 0.0021; F(5,25)=5.19), followed by a post-hoc
test for linear trend. The data in Fig. 5G was tested with a one-way repeated
measures ANOVA, and with a Dunnett post-hoc test using the first point on Day 1 as
a reference. Significance levels are reported in the Results text, and are additionally
indicated in the Figures by star symbols according to: p > 0.05, no star; p < 0.05, *; p
< 0.01, **; p < 0.001, ***.

Results
Dopamine neurons of the VTA project to the BA and medial CeA
We first investigated the VTA - amygdala projection anatomically by antero- and
retrograde tracing techniques. We used dopamine-transporter Cre mice (DATCre),
and injected an AAV vector that drives the Cre-dependent expression of eGFP into
the VTA (AAV1:CAG:FLEX:eGFP; Fig. 1A). Confocal fluorescence images revealed
many transduced, eGFP-positive cell bodies within the VTA that were also positive
for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) as revealed by an anti-TH antibody (Fig. 1B).
Specifically, we found that 81 ± 9% (1060 / 1259) of all TH - positive (TH+) cells in the
VTA expressed eGFP (n = 9 sections from n = 3 mice), and that 98 ± 2%
(1060/1082) of the eGFP-expressing cells were TH+ (n = 9 sections in n = 3 mice;

Fig. 1C). Thus, ~ 80% of the VTA neurons were infected with the AAV1 vector, and
expression was virtually limited to TH+ neurons, demonstrating tight expression
control by the Cre-dependent expression vector.
In the amygdala region, we found eGFP - expressing axons in the CeA and in the
basolateral nucleus complex (Fig. 1D). In the latter, the highest fiber density was
found in the BA, whereas the LA received few eGFP-positive fibers (Fig. 1D). In the
CeA, the medial subdivision showed a denser innervation with eGFP - positive fibers
as compared to the lateral CeA (Fig. 1D; (Mingote et al., 2015)). Nevertheless, the
lateral CeA was densely stained by the TH antibody, consistent with a
catecholaminergic innervation of the lateral CeA from a non-VTA source (Asan, 1998;
Hasue and Shammah-Lagnado, 2002; Matthews et al., 2016). In the BA and the
medial CeA, the expression pattern of eGFP+ axons largely overlapped with that of
TH (Fig. 1E, F). Besides the BA and medial CeA, TH+ fibers, many of which also
expressed eGFP, were found in the amygdalostriatal transition zone (AStr) (Fig. 1D).
This data shows that DAT-expressing neurons in the VTA send axons to the BA, and
to the medial CeA.
We next investigated the location of BA - projecting dopamine neurons in the VTA by
using the retrograde tracer Choleratoxin-B (CTB), which was injected into the BA of
DATCre x ChR2 (Channelrhodopsin-2) mice (CTB-Alexa 647; Fig. 1G). The injections
filled a large fraction of the BA but at the same time were limited to the BA (Fig. 1H).
Retrogradely labeled neurons were found in the mPFC, the hippocampus and other
brain regions known to provide input to the BA (not shown). In the VTA, we similarly
observed retrogradely labeled neurons (Fig. 1I, J). We found that BA projectors were
homogeneously distributed over the a-p axis (Fig. 1 K, L), and medio-laterally as
measured by the distance from the midline (Fig. 1 L). On the other hand, we found
more BA projectors in the dorsal half as compared to the ventral half of the VTA (n =
145 of a total of n = 160 neurons were located in the dorsal half; Fig. 1K). Thus, we
confirm a preferential dorsal localization of BA projectors within the VTA (Baimel et
al., 2017). However, we could not confirm a preferential localization of BA projectors
in the more lateral-, and more posterior parts of the VTA; the difference might be
caused by the more restricted BA injection volumes in the previous study (Baimel et
al., 2017). Taken together, antero- and retrograde labelling experiments reveal a

projection from DAT+ neurons to the BA and CeA. The projection to the BA is carried
by a subpopulation of relatively evenly distributed neurons in the VTA.

VTA neurons respond to footshock and acquire tone (CS) responses
To investigate the role of VTA dopamine neurons in fear learning, we recorded the
activity of VTA dopamine neurons throughout a three-day fear learning paradigm
(see Materials and Methods and Fig. 3B for the fear learning protocol). For the in-vivo
recordings, we used optrodes, which consisted of four tetrode bundles placed around
a central optical fiber (Fig. 2A, B) (Anikeeva et al., 2012). Initial attempts to
optogenetically identify BA projectors after expression of ChR2 with retrograde
viruses in the BA (Herpes Simplex virus) were not fruitful, maybe because of the
relatively sparse population of BA projectors in the VTA (Fig. 1). We therefore
decided to express ChR2 under the DAT promoter using DATCre x ChR2-eYFP mice,
which allowed us to identify putative dopamine neurons by optogenetic stimulation
(Fig. 2C). The example mouse of the recordings shown in Fig. 2 developed a strong
freezing response on the training day, and maintained this level of freezing on the
retrieval day (Fig. 2D).
During the training day, when tones were paired with footshock stimulation, a majority
of the recorded units showed an increased AP firing in response to the footshocks,
and acquired an AP firing response to the tone. The example unit shown in Fig. 2E, F
(a putative DAT+ dopamine neuron) reliably responded to the footshock (Fig. 2E,
right). In addition, this unit developed a short-latency response to the tone beeps
when these were followed by a footshock on the training day (Fig. 2E). The tone
response was maintained during the retrieval of threat memory one day later (day 3;
Fig. 2F). In this mouse, n = 8 units that fulfilled the quality criteria for unit isolation
could be followed through at least day 2 and day 3. In n = 4 of these units, a CS
response developed during the pairing of the CS with a footshock, whereas other
units remained below the criterion for a response (Fig. 2G, pink- versus grey traces,
respectively). In the same mouse, n = 6 units responded to footshocks, whereas n =
2 units were non-responsive (Fig. 2H, pink- and gray traces respectively). The APfiring responses varied in individual units across the six footshocks, but no clear timedependence could be found (Fig. 2H).

We next analyzed the various response types in the form of Venn diagrams for each
mouse (Fig. 2I - K). We made optrode recordings in n = 12 mice, but we could only
recover useful single-units that could be followed over at least day 2 and - 3 of the
fear learning protocol in n = 3 mice. In these mice, there was a substantial overlap
between US-responders and CS-entrained units (Fig. 2I – K; red and blue areas
respectively). In all three mice, opto-tagged units (putative DAT+ neurons) were a
sub-population of US-responding and CS-entrained units (white and yellow areas in
Fig. 2I - K), and in each mouse, we found a minority of non-responding units (Fig. 2I K, gray areas). Furthermore, we observed a decrease in AP firing in response to
footshocks in n = 1 opto-tagged unit (Fig. 2J, red dashed area), and in n = 1 out of 20
non-identified units (Fig. 2J, blue circle; see Extended Data 1 - Fig. 2 - 1 for the
traces).
Taken together, a majority of units recorded in the VTA during the fear learning
protocol, amongst them putative DAT+ neurons, responded with an increased APfiring to the footshocks, and acquired a short-latency response to tones when these
were reinforced by a footshock. These results suggest that VTA dopamine neurons
have a role in auditory-cued fear learning.

Role of VTA dopamine neurons in auditory threat memory
To investigate whether dopamine neurons in the VTA contribute to the formation of
an auditory-cued threat memory, we next employed optogenetic methods. Because
we found that many VTA neurons, including dopamine VTA neurons, increase their
AP firing in response to footshocks (Fig. 2), we next wished to silence VTA dopamine
neurons at the time of the footshock, and observe the effect on fear learning. For this,
we employed DATCre mice, and expressed the light - activated proton pump ArcheGFP in a Cre-dependent manner virally in the VTA (using AAV1:CBA:FLEX:ArcheGFP; Fig. 3A). Initial slice electrophysiology experiments showed that yellow light
(561 nm) caused robust outward currents and strong hyperpolarization of Arch expressing VTA dopamine neurons (Fig. 3B, C; n = 5 recordings from n = 3 mice).
We next tested whether VTA dopamine neuron firing during the footshock is needed
for threat memory formation. We injected AAV1:CBA:FLEX:Arch-eGFP into the VTA
of DATCre mice and implanted a single optic fiber over the VTA (Fig. 3D, E). We used

a fear learning protocol in which we applied six tone blocks on day 1 without
footshock (Fig. 3F; "Day 1"). On day 2, the tone blocks co-terminated with a 1s
footshock, and on day 3, retrieval of the auditory-cued threat memory was assessed
by applying n = 4 tone blocks alone in a different context (Fig. 3F). To ask whether
footshock-driven firing of dopamine neurons contributes to threat memory formation,
yellow light was applied for 3s starting 1s before the footshock and ending 1s after
the footshock (Fig. 3G). Mice injected with an AAV vector driving the expression of
eGFP served as control group.
The average freezing levels during the behavioral tests over all four days of Archand eGFP- expressing control mice is shown in Fig. 3H. A two-way repeated
measures ANOVA revealed a significant effect of silencing on the freezing levels
during the fear learning protocol (p = 0.0117; F(15, 150) = 2.12 for the interaction
between the two factors time, and photoinhibition). A post-hoc Bonferroni test
showed a significant difference in the freezing level for the sixth tone - footshock
pairing on the training day (p < 0.05), and for the second and third tone block on the
retrieval day (p < 0.01 for both; Fig. 3H). Pooling the freezing data over the four tone
blocks of day 3 indicated a significantly reduced retrieval of cued threat memory (p =
0.013, t-test; Fig. 3I). On the other hand, the contextual threat memory retrieval
tested on day 4 was not significantly different between the Arch group as compared
to the eGFP group (Fig. 3H, right; p = 0.102, t-test). Taken together, these results
suggest that footshock - driven activity of VTA dopamine neurons on the training day
contributes to the formation of auditory cued threat memory.

The VTA to BA projection contributes to auditory cued threat memories
The experiments of Fig. 3 suggest that dopamine neurons in the VTA contribute to
the formation of auditory - cued threat memories. Nevertheless, there are several
possible output projections of VTA dopamine neurons that might contribute to
aversive learning, including projections to the mPFC and NAc (Vander Weele et al.,
2018; de Jong et al., 2019), as well as the projection to the BA that we characterized
anatomically (Fig. 1). To study the role of the dopaminergic VTA to BA projection
more specifically, we next silenced the output of the VTA dopamine projections in the
BA. This was achieved by bilateral injection of AAV1:CBA:FLEX:Arch-eGFP into the
VTA of DATCre mice, and implantation of optic fibers bilaterally over each BA (Fig. 4A,

B). Mice that expressed eGFP in the VTA but that otherwise underwent identical
procedures as the Arch group served as controls. Yellow light (561 nm) was again
delivered during a 3s period centered over the footshock stimulation on the training
day (Fig. 4C).
In the Arch group, we found a significant decrease of freezing across the fear
learning protocol as compared to the eGFP group (Fig. 4C; F(15, 195) = 1.87, p =
0.0238, for interaction between photoinhibition and time; two-way repeated measures
ANOVA). Bonferroni post-hoc analysis showed that freezing in response to the fourth
tone block on the retrieval day was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). Analysis of the
pooled data over all four tone blocks of the retrieval day showed a significant
decrease of freezing in the Arch group as compared to the eGFP group (Fig. 4D, p =
0.0043, t-test). Furthermore, contextual threat memory retrieval tested on day 4 was
significantly smaller in Arch-eGFP expressing mice as compared to the control group
(Fig. 4C, right; p = 0.046, t-test). These data show that footshock - driven activity of
DAT+ axons in the BA originating from the VTA contributes to the formation of
auditory cued threat memories, as well as to the formation of contextual threat
memories.
Because we found that VTA dopamine neurons also project to the CeA and
especially to the medial division of the CeA (Fig. 1; (Mingote et al., 2015), we next
tested whether this pathway might contribute to auditory cued threat memory. We
expressed Arch-eGFP Cre-dependently bilaterally in the VTA of DATCre mice (using
AAV1:CBA:FLEX:Arch-eGFP), and implanted optic fibers bilaterally over each CeA
(Fig. 4E, F). Yellow light was again applied for 3s during the footshock stimuli. When
analyzed over the three subsequent days of the auditory cued fear learning protocol,
we found no significant effect of silencing on freezing (Fig. 4G; F(15, 195) = 0.6, p =
0.875 for interaction between photoinhibition and time; two-way repeated measures
ANOVA). Similarly, pooling of the freezing data on the retrieval day did not reveal a
significant difference between the groups (Fig. 4H, p = 0.90, t-test). Finally, the
contextual retrieval of threat memories on day 4 was not significantly different after
silencing the dopaminergic VTA axons over the CeA (Fig. 4G, right; p = 0.83, t-test).
Taken together, the experiments in Fig. 4 show that the dopaminergic VTA to BA
pathway contributes to the formation of auditory cued threat memories and to

contextual threat memories, while the VTA to CeA projection seems not necessary
for these learning behaviors.

Footshock stimuli drive dopamine release in the basal amygdala
Previous microdialysis studies have shown that dopamine concentrations rise in the
amygdala in response to stressful stimuli including footshocks (Young and Rees,
1998; de Oliveira et al., 2011). Nevertheless, dopamine release has not been
measured in the amygdala with high time-resolution at different time points
throughout fear learning protocols. We found above that many VTA neurons,
including dopaminergic (DAT+) neurons respond with an increased AP - firing to
footshock stimulation, and acquire responses to tones reinforced by footshocks (Fig.
2). We therefore wished to investigate whether dopamine is released in the BA during
footshock stimuli as we would expect, and second, whether dopamine release might
develop in response to the learned CS at the time of threat memory retrieval.
To measure dopamine release during the 3-day fear learning protocol in the BA, we
used the dopamine sensor dLight1.2 (Patriarchi et al., 2018). We expressed
dLight1.2 in the left BA using an AAV5 vector, and measured its fluorescence with an
optical fiber implanted over the BA three weeks later during the fear learning protocol.
Tone stimulation alone during habituation on day 1 did not notably increase the
dopamine concentration in the BA (Fig. 5C1). On day 2, when each tone block was
followed by a 1s footshock, we observed robust increases of the dLight1
fluorescence signal, that started precisely with each 1s - footshock stimulus (Fig.
5C2). These dLight1 fluorescent changes were reproducibly observed upon each
footshock presentation (Fig. 5C2; Fig. 5F; n = 6 mice), but they were absent in n = 3
control mice in which expression of dLight1.2 was omitted (Fig. 5D). The footshock evoked dopamine concentration transients reached their peak ~ 1.8 s after the onset
of the 1s-long footshock stimulus, and had a decay time constant of 3.2 ± 0.3 s (n = 6
mice; Fig. 5E). The peak amplitude of the dopamine transients decreased with
successive footshock stimuli (Fig. 5F; one-way repeated measures ANOVA,
[F(5,25)=5.19, p = 0.0021], post-hoc test for linear trend, p < 0.0001). The decay of the
dLight1.2 peak signal with repeated footshocks might indicate that dopamine
responses are stronger with novel, unexpected stimuli (Wise, 2004). A post-hoc
histological analysis of fiber position indicated that the amplitude of dLight1.2

transients correlated with the precision of the fiber implant over the BA (Extended
Data 2 - Fig. 5 - 1). Taken together, these data show that footshock stimulation
during the fear learning protocol induces robust dopamine release in the BA.
We next analyzed the possibility of dopamine release in the BA during the tone
presentations. In response to the tone stimulation on day 3, the example mouse of
Fig. 5 showed a well - measurable dopamine concentration transient in the BA at the
onset of each tone block (Fig. 5C3). Nevertheless, the amplitude of the tone - driven
dopamine transients upon threat memory retrieval was smaller than the amplitudes of
the footshock - evoked dopamine transients on day 2 (compare Fig. 5C2 with 5C3; p
= 0.00071, paired t-test). When we analyzed the integral of the dLight1.2 traces
during the 30s tone presentations, a decrease in dopamine became apparent in
response to the first two CS presentations on day 2 (Fig. 5C2, C3, green traces and
arrows; Fig. 5G, arrows). Furthermore, we observed increased dopamine levels in
response to the CS presentation on day 3 (Fig. 5G, vertical arrow). A 1-way repeated
measures ANOVA showed that the dLight1.2 integral signals in response to the CS
underwent a significant time-dependent change (p < 0.0001; F(15,75)=4.62; n = 6
mice). A post-hoc Dunnett test showed that the integral dLight1.2 signal in response
to the second CS presentation on day 2 was significantly smaller than the response
to the first CS presentation (Fig. 5G, p < 0.01). On the other hand, the increased
dLight1.2 response to the first CS presentation on day 3 was not significant (p > 0.05;
post-hoc Dunnett test; see Fig. 5G, vertical arrow). Taken together, dLight1.2
photometry shows that footshock stimuli cause robust dopamine release in the BA
during the training day of the fear learning protocol, whereas dopamine responses to
the learned CS are smaller, and more variable between mice.

Discussion
Using in-vivo optogenetic methods and optrode recordings, as well as anatomical
circuit tracing and in-vivo imaging of dopamine release, we have studied the role of
the VTA to BA dopamine pathway in the formation of an auditory cued threat
memory. Silencing the VTA - BA pathway during footshock presentation led to a
reduced expression of threat memory one day later, suggesting that footshock-driven
activity of VTA axons in the BA facilitates the formation of an auditory cued threat
memory. In-vivo optrode recordings of single units in the VTA showed that most

recorded units, including putative dopamine neurons, responded to the footshock
with increased AP firing rates, and acquire CS responsiveness. Furthermore, dLight1
imaging showed that footshocks, and to a smaller degree the learned CS, cause
dopamine release in the BA. Thus, we conclude that VTA dopamine neurons
contribute to signal salient somatosensory events to the BA, where the resulting
dopamine release facilitates the formation of an auditory cued threat memory.
A role of dopamine in aversive learning has first been hypothesized based on
pharmacological experiments with D1- and D2-receptor blockers and microdialysis based dopamine measurements in the amygdala (Lamont and Kokkinidis, 1998;
Young and Rees, 1998; Guarraci et al., 1999; Nader and LeDoux, 1999).
Furthermore, fear-potentiated startle was reduced in the dopamine-deficient mouse
model and after conditional genetic deletion of NMDA-receptors in TH+ neurons
(Fadok et al., 2009; Zweifel et al., 2011). On the other hand, the generally accepted
role of VTA dopamine neurons in reward processing (Schultz, 1998; Wise, 2004),
and recordings suggesting that VTA dopamine neurons might be uniformly inhibited
by aversive stimuli (Ungless et al., 2004; Tan et al., 2012), might have hampered
progress in understanding the role of dopamine in aversively motivated learning.
More recent circuit tracing analyses with viral approaches, as well as retrograde
labeling and electrophysiology after behavioral tests showed that the VTA is
composed of neurons with diverse projection areas belonging to different subsystems
(Lammel et al., 2011; Lammel et al., 2012; Beier et al., 2015). These dopaminergic
subsystems in the VTA can be involved in both reward - based learning (for most
NAc projectors) or in aversive learning (mPFC projectors). Nevertheless, the VTA to
amygdala pathway had received little attention in recent studies.
We made in-vivo optrode recordings in the VTA throughout the 3-day fear learning
protocol. Although the yield of the recordings was low, the results showed that in
behaving mice, most recorded units, including putative dopamine neurons identified
optogenetically under the DAT promoter, were excited by the footshock (Fig. 2). We
only found few units that were inhibited by the footshock (~ 10%), even within the
sample of putative DAT+ neurons (Fig. 2I-K). Furthermore, we found that a population
of units which largely overlapped with the US - responsive population developed a
response to tones when these when re-inforced by the footshock (Fig. 2). It was

shown, largely based on AP - waveform criteria, that footshocks in anesthetized mice
excite putative VTA GABA neurons, and mostly inhibit putative VTA dopamine
neurons (Tan et al., 2012). It remains possible that a fraction of the non-identified
units in our sample represented GABA neurons. On the other hand, we showed with
optogenetic tools that inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons during the footshock
(using DAT+ Cre mice), or inhibition of VTA dopamine axons over the BA,
significantly reduced threat memory formation (Figs 3, 4). These results, and our
finding of robust, footshock-triggered dopamine release in the BA (Fig. 5), strongly
suggest that footshocks activate dopamine neurons in the VTA, and that the resulting
release of dopamine in the BA facilitates threat memory formation.
Several recent studies have provided evidence for roles of distinct dopamine neuron
populations, both within and outside the VTA, in aversively motivated learning. One
study found that VTA dopaminergic axons that project to a ventro-medial area of the
NAc shell were excited by footshocks (de Jong et al., 2019). Interestingly, these
axons acquired a tone response when the latter was re-inforced by footshocks,
similar to what we found here for a large fraction of recorded VTA units (Fig. 2). De
Jong et al. (2019) also showed that projections to the lateral shell of the NAc – these
dopamine axons were involved in reward processing - were inhibited by footshocks.
Yet another population of VTA dopamine neurons, the mPFC projectors, are involved
in aversive valence processing (Lammel et al., 2011; Vander Weele et al., 2018), and
a dopamine projection from the VTA to the NAc and to the CeA is involved in fear
memory and fear discrimination (Jo et al., 2018). Thus, together with the VTA
dopamine neurons projecting to the BA that we have studied here, there are different
populations of VTA dopamine projection neurons involved in aversive learning.
Furthermore, dopamine neurons located in the dorsal raphe that project to the CeA,
and dopamine neurons of the lateral portion of the substantia nigra that project to the
posterior striatum, were recently shown to be involved in aversive learning (Groessl
et al., 2018); (Menegas et al., 2018). The molecular logics of these dopamine neuron
populations with distinct projections patterns has recently been addressed by using
intersectional genetic approaches (Poulin et al., 2018). Together, these functional and genetic circuit studies corroborate the anatomical notion that distinct populations
of midbrain dopamine neurons have largely separate projection targets (Swanson,
1982; Menegas et al., 2015). The various dopamine projection pathways that are

involved in aversive learning (see discussion above) might be regarded as parallel
streams of neuromodulatory input to largely separate projection domains in the
telencephalon. The functional advantage for such parallel streams of dopamine
signaling should be further elaborated in future work.
We have found a contribution of the VTA - BA dopamine projection to the formation
of auditory cued threat memories (Figs 3, 4), and our finding that dopamine is
released precisely at the start of the footshock (Fig. 5) supports the notion that
dopamine can contribute to a "teaching" signal for plasticity in the BA (Herry and
Johansen, 2014). On the other hand, the LA, which receives many sensory inputs
from cortical and thalamic areas (LeDoux et al., 1990; Nabavi et al., 2014; Lucas et
al., 2016), was only sparsely innervated by dopamine fibers from the VTA (Fig. 1). It
therefore remains unclear whether dopamine plays a role for associative plasticity in
both the LA and the BA, or whether the role of dopamine is limited to the BA. What
might be the mechanisms by which dopamine acts in the BA to promote threat
memory formation? Dopamine acts on metabotropic D1- and D2-like receptors (Neve
et al., 2004; Tritsch and Sabatini, 2012), and activation of both D1- and D2- receptor
subtypes in the amygdala (Lamont and Kokkinidis, 1998; Guarraci et al., 2000) is
expected to modulate various signaling aspects. These include an up-regulation of
intrinsic neuronal excitability via D1-receptors (Kroner et al., 2005; Tang, 2018), a D2
- receptor mediated decrease in transmission at both excitatory- and inhibitory
synapses (Rosenkranz and Grace, 1999); (Chu et al., 2012), and an action of D1receptors on intracellular signaling pathways involved in long-term plasticity of
excitatory synapses (Li et al., 2011). Thus dopamine likely facilitates the induction of
plasticity at excitatory synapses in an "instructive" manner involving the activation of
D1-receptors, or more indirectly in a "permissive" manner via D2-receptor mediated
inhibition of GABA release onto BA principal neurons (Bissiere et al., 2003; Chu et
al., 2012).
In summary, our study shows that many VTA neurons, and amongst them dopamine
neurons, are excited during footshock stimulation and aversive learning. The
resulting dopamine release in the BA facilitates the formation of an auditory - cued
threat memory. It will be interesting to investigate which specific excitatory, or
inhibitory pathways in the BA are modulated by dopamine to facilitate plasticity, and

teaching signal in aversively motivated learning will allow us to gain further insights
into the mechanisms of maladaptive plasticities that underlie anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (Yeh et al., 2018).

Fig. 1. A dopaminergic afferent projection from the VTA to different amygdala
subnuclei (A) Schematic of the experimental approach for panels B - F. An AAV1
vector driving the Cre-dependent expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein
(eGFP) virus was injected into the VTA of a DATCre mouse. (B) The injection area on
the level of the VTA, with eGFP fluorescence (green channel) and the
immunohistochemistry with an anti-TH antibody (red channel). The area indicated by
the white box is shown at a higher magnification on the right. Note that eGFP
expression is limited to TH+ cells. (C) Quantifications of, left, the percentage of
eGFP+ cells that were also TH+ amongst all eGFP+ cells, and, right, the percentage of
eGFP+ and TH+-positive cells within all TH+ cells, respectively (mean ± S.E.M; from n
= 9 VTA sections from n = 3 mice). (D) eGFP-expressing axons were observed in the
basal amygdala (BA), medial portion of the central amygdala ("CeA" labels the entire
central amygdala) and in the amygdala-striatal transition zone (AStr), but were largely
absent in the lateral amygdala (LA). (E - F) Confocal images of eGFP and TH+ fibers
in the BA (E) and CeA (F). (G) Schematic of the retrograde labelling approach for
panels H-L. A fluorescently labeled cholera toxin B (CTB-Alexa 647, magenta) was
stereotaxically injected into the BA of a DATCre x ChR2-eYFP mouse. (H) Example
image of the injection site in the BA, overlaid with the outlines (white lines) of the
brain areas from the mouse brain atlas (Franklin and Paxinos, 2016). (I) Image of a
coronal brain section containing the VTA at the indicated Bregma position. The
magenta channel shows neurons back-labelled with CTB-Alexa 647; green channel
shows expression of a ChR2-eYFP reporter gene in DAT+ neurons. (J) A confocal
image of a CTB-Alexa 647 labelled BA-projecting neuron in the VTA. (K) Dorsoventral (DV) position of CTB-Alexa 647 - positive neurons within the VTA (0%
represents most dorsal position), for all sections along the AP axis of one mouse, and
the corresponding histogram (right). Note the preferential position of BA projectors in
the dorsal half of the VTA. (L) Medio-lateral position of CTB-Alexa 647 - positive
neurons, again for all sections along the AP-axis. The black lines show the medial or
lateral border of the VTA; from Bregma ~ -3.3 mm the bilateral nuclei of the VTA
meet at the midline. Note that there was no apparent preferential localization of BA
projectors on the medio-lateral axis, nor on the anterior - posterior axis. Similar
observations were made in another mouse.

plot for four electrodes (E1-E4) of one tetrode, showing unsorted spikes aligned to
the onsets of n = 100, 2 ms – long laser light pulses (blue shading). Spikes at 2-8 ms
after the light pulse were collected and subjected to spike clustering (see Materials
and Methods). (D) Time course of freezing of the example mouse during the three
days of the fear learning protocol. (E) Spiking activity of a single opto-tagged putative
DAT+ unit during day 2 (training day). AP frequency (top) and z-score (bottom) are
shown in response to the CS (averages over the n = 30 tone presentations for each
tone block), as well as in response to footshocks (averages over the n = 6 footshock
presentations; right). (F) Spiking activity of the same unit as (E), but for responses to
CS presentations on day 3 (threat memory retrieval). Right, AP-waveforms for the
unit shown in E, F. (G, H) Responses of all units in this mouse (FT7612) to tone
presentations during day1 - day 3 (G), and to footshocks on day 2 (H). Z-scores were
analyzed and plotted as a function of time (number of tone block). Units classified as
CS - entrained are shown in pink, and the others in gray. Thick red and black lines
show average ± S.E.M. across these groups, respectively. Square symbols
connected by lines represent DAT+ units identified by optotagging. (I, J, K) Venn-type
diagrams showing the number of units in the different response classes and their
overlap. The data in (I) is from the example mouse shown in panels B-H. Note the
overall similar distribution and overlap of response types across n = 3 mice. Two US
responsive units in mouse FT6963 showed a reduction in firing upon the footshock
(J, dashed areas).

F/F0 traces of dLight1.2 fluorescence recorded in one mouse (FU3644) on

habituation day 1 (C1), training day 2 (C2) and threat memory retrieval day 3 (C3).
The timing of CS - and US - presentations are shown by blue and red traces,
respectively. Robust dopamine concentration transients were observed with every
footshock stimulation on day 2 (C2). Integrated F/F0 traces for the duration of the
CS are shown in green. Right, individual traces of F/F0, aligned either to the onset
of tone (CS) presentations (C1, C3), or to the onset of the footshock on day 2 (C2).
Gray, individual cutout traces; black, average traces. The inset in panel C2 shows the
average

F/F0 trace at higher time resolution. (D) Responses to footshocks in a

control mouse (FU3844) in which the injection with the AAV5 vector driving the
expression of dLight1.2 was omitted. Note absence of F/F0 signal (compare to C2,
right). (E) Average, and individual data points for time to peak (left) and for the decay
time constant (right) of dLight1.2 F/F0 traces in response to footshocks. N = 6 mice
each. (F) Average (black) and individual (gray; n = 6 mice) values of peak dopamine
concentration transients in response to the n = 6 footshocks on day 2. The responses
declined over repeated CS-US pairings on day 2; for statistical testing, see Results.
(G) Integral

F/F0 values for CS - responses (integration interval 30s). Gray and

black traces are individual and average traces for n = 6 mice. Note the negative
integral values (arrow) for the first and second CS presentation on day 2 (see also
arrows in panel C2), and the positive F/F0 value in response to CS stimulation on
day 3 (vertical arrow). For statistical testing, see Results. Error bars are mean ±
S.E.M.

Extended Data 1 – Fig. 2 - 1. Examples of spiking activity of opto-tagged (DAT+) and
unidentified single units. The data is presented in a format identical to Fig. 2E, F;
stimulus-aligned AP-firing frequency (top row) and z-score (bottom) are shown for the
training day 2 (CS presentations in blue, US in red) and for the retrieval day 3 (for CS
only). Average AP - waveforms for the four electrodes are shown on the right. (A-B)
Spiking activity of an unidentified unit from the same example animal as shown in
Fig. 2B-H (mouse FT7612). The unit was classified as non-responsive to US, but as
CS-entrained (note an increase in CS-evoked spiking over repeated CS - US pairings
on day 2). (C-D) A DAT+ unit from another mouse (FT6963) which showed no CS
entrainment, and reduced AP – activity in response to the footshock (C). This unit is
highlighted by the red dashed area in Fig. 2J. (E-F) Example for a non-identified unit
measured in mouse FT6963. This unit also showed reduced AP – firing activity in
response to the footshock (see E), and showed CS-entrainment during day 2. This
unit is highlighted by the blue dashed circle in Fig. 2J.

Extended Data 2 – Fig. 5 - 1. Post-hoc histological verification of optic fiber
placement for dLight1.2 measurements of dopamine release in the BA.
(A) Immunofluorescent images of coronal sections through the left BA of n = 6 mice
showing expression of the dLight1.2 probe (green; detected with an anti-GFP
antibody). The outline of BA is shown with a dashed line. The solid line represents
the reconstructed cross-section through the photometry optic fiber, with an emanating
light cone at the ventral end of the fiber (a 500 µm effective illumination radius was
assumed; see Aravanis et al., 2007). (B) The peak F/F0 values of the first US
responses of dLight1.2 probe on the training day 2 (see Fig. 5C2) were plotted
versus the percent area of the light cone profile that overlapped with the outline of the
BA nucleus. The overlap area was summed up over serial brain sections covering the
full extent of the light cone in 3D. Note that in mice with lower overlap (e.g. FU3642,
FU3646; see A) the US-triggered F/F0 responses were lower than in the mice with
larger overlap (Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.579).
