ABSTRACT
According to the Wallacean shortfall, knowledge about the geographic distribution of most
species is still incomplete. Cryptonanus agricolai (Moojen, 1943) is a didelphid marsupial
considered Data Deficient by IUCN, since species records are few and sparse. Although little
information is available for the species, it is commonly associated with xeric habitats from
Caatinga and open formations of the Cerrado in east-central Brazil. Here we report the first
records of C. agricolai in the Atlantic Forest core, a new ecoregion of occurrence for the
species, based on a recent collected voucher - identified through morphological and molecular
analysis - from a Mussununga formation in Reserva Biológica do Córrego do Veado,
southeastern Brazil. This record extends the occurrence of the species to more than 1 700 000
km² and lower its altitudinal range limit to 108 m.

INTRODUCTION

On the way to extend the knowledge of biodiversity, scientists often come across
shortfalls on local-scale data. Those shortfalls generate uncertainty in all analyses of
biodiversity, compromising the generality and validity of theoretical knowledge and the
quality of conservation assessments and actions (Hortal et al. 2015). One of those recognized
shortfalls is the Wallacean, which defines that, for the majority of taxa, geographical
distributions are still poorly understood and contain many gaps, being frequently inadequate
at all scales (Lomolino 2004; Whittaker et al. 2005). Such shortfall is particularly true for
tropical species, especially for those hardly trapped and/or not abundant in communities, even
though many of them possess high conservation value (Beck et al. 2018).

The Neotropical region is home to one of the richest mammal faunas in the world
(Antonelli & Sanmartini 2011; Patterson & Costa 2012). Nevertheless, much of the diversity
it houses is still unknown and there are huge sample gaps, even in regions with a long history
of occupation and research, as is the case of the Atlantic Forest (Bovendorp et al. 2017).
Regarding the knowledge about Neotropical marsupials, within the last years the number of
Didelphidae species has increased from 91 species (Gardner 2008) to 103 recognized species
(Astúa 2015). However, 15% of these are currently considered as Data Deficient (IUCN
2019). Although research, and consequently, the knowledge on the Neotropical fauna has
increased in recent years, gaps in taxonomic and biogeographic knowledge of specious and

yet elusive groups, such as the Neotropical small mammals, hinder conservation initiatives.
Effective biodiversity conservation requires minimal knowledge about the targets of
protection (Brito 2004), making it essential that efforts be devoted to cataloging, quantifying
and mapping such biodiversity.

Cryptonanus is a didelphid genus that was previously referred as Gracilinanus, until
be recently validated as a different genus through morphological characters and molecular
markers (Voss et al. 2005). Currently, four species of Cryptonanus are recognized: C.
agricolai (Moojen 1943), C. chacoensis (Tate 1931), C. guahybae (Tate 1931) and C.
unduaviensis (Tate 1931), which are distributed throughout open habitats in tropical and
subtropical ecoregions east of the Andes and south of the Amazon River, including the
Caatinga, Chaco, Cerrado and Pampas (Voss et al. 2005; D’Elía & Martínez 2006; Voss &
Jansa 2009; Garcia et al. 2010; Quintela et al. 2011).

Cryptonanus agricolai, is mostly found in xeric habitats in Caatinga and open
formations of the Cerrado biomes in east-central Brazil, from 400 to 760 m (Gardner 2008),
but also occurs in contact zones with the Amazon (in northern Mato Grosso state, MN 66318;
Bezerra et al. 2009) and the Atlantic Forest limits (seasonal tropical forests of Minas Gerais
states; Gardner 2008). Although there is few information available about its locomotion
habits, most faunal surveys report captures in pitfall traps, suggesting a ground-dwelling
locomotion (Astúa 2015), and probably an insectivore/omnivore diet. The conservation status
for such species is assessed as Data Deficient (Carmignotto et al. 2016), since there are few
and scattered records over a wide area, and little is known about its habitat requirements,
which makes research efforts on its geographical distribution needed.

Here we report the first records of Cryptonanus agricolai in the Atlantic Forest core in
southeastern Brazil, due to the identification - through morphological and molecular analysis -

of a recently collected specimen from state of Espírito Santo, and the recognition of a
previously reported Cryptonanus sp. (Delciellos et al. 2016) from Rio de Janeiro state as C.
agricolai. Our findings extend the occurrence of this species to 1 773 398 km² and set its
lowest altitudinal range limit to 108 m, in addition to register its presence in an unexpected
ecoregion.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Córrego do Veado Biological Reserve comprises a forested area of 2 357 ha in the
municipality of Pinheiros, state of Espírito Santo, southeastern Brazil, where secondary
vegetation predominantes (Ibama 2000). The surroundings of Córrego do Veado are
characterized by anthropic activities, such as cattle ranches and coffee, papaya, eucalyptus
and rubber tree plantations (Moscal 2012). On October 17th, 2015, a specimen of didelphid
marsupial (LPC1636) was caught in a pitfall trap at Córrego do Veado (18° 19' S, 40° 07' W,
altitude = 108 m) in an area of Mussununga (i.e. “soft and wet white sand”, in Tupi-Guarani;
Meira-Neto et al. 2005), characterized by shrub and bush vegetation that develops in sandy
soils (Saporetti-Junior et al. 2012). The individual was collected as voucher and deposited in
the Mammal Collection at Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo (UFES-MAM 3075). Liver
tissue samples were preserved in 70°GL ethanol and deposited in the Animal Tissue
Collection at Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo (UFES-CTA 4116).

Biological information collected for the individual included: reproductive stage, dental
age class, body mass (BM, in grams) and external body measurements (in millimeters), such
as head-to-body length (HB), tail length (TL), hindfoot length (HL) and ear length (E). Skulls
were removed, cleaned, and measured using a digital pachymeter accurate to 0.01 mm. The
following cranial and dental measurements were taken from the specimen following Voss et

al. (2005): condylobasal length (CBL), nasal breadth (NB), least interorbital constriction
(LIB), zygomatic breadth (ZB), palatal length (PL), palatal breadth (PB), maxillary toothrow
length (MTR), length of M1 to M4 (LM), and length of M1 to M3 (M1 – M3).

Additionally, 801 bp of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b (Cyt-b) were used for
molecular analyses, due to its potential to distinguish sister species of mammals (e.g. Agrizzi
et al. 2012; Bradley & Baker 2001) and also because there are several Cyt-b sequences
available for a considerable number of didelphid species in GenBank. Sequence alignment
was performed using CLUSTALW algorithm implemented in MEGA X (Kumar et al. 2018),
with posterior manual edition. We performed BLAST searches in GenBank (http://blast.stva.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) in order to determine the approximate association of the
obtained sequences with published records. Phylogenetic inference of Maximum Likelihood
(ML), Maximum Parsimony (MP) and Neighbor Joining (NJ) was generated in MEGA X
using Tamura and Nei’s (1993) model of nucleotide substitution and variable sites following a
gamma distribution (TN93+G). Bayesian analysis was performed in Mr. Bayes v3.2.6
(Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003). Phylogenetic trees were later edited in FigTree v1.4.3
(Rambaut & Drummond 2012). We also conducted systematic searches in online academic
databases (Google Scholar, Scielo, Scopus, Web of Science) for occurrence localities of
Cryptonanus agricolai, in order to elaborate an updated distribution map of the species. We
only considered as reliable those records that included a detailed description of how the
specimen was identified.

The individual UFES-MAM 3075 captured in a pitfall trap on 17th October 2015 was
an adult male with evident scrotal testicles and dental age class 5 (all molars functional and
permanent third premolar completely erupted; Tribe 1990). External, cranial and dental
measurements are shown in Table 1. A combination of morphological aspects related to the
upper premolars (P3 greater than P2) and fenestrae in the palate (long maxillopalatine
fenestra, palatal fenestra, posterolateral foramen, incisive foramen and absent maxillary
fenestra) led us to identify the specimen as belonging to the genus Cryptonanus (Fig. 1),
according to didelphid identification key to genera (Rossi et al. 2012; Voss & Jansa 2009).

Southeast Brazil (A–C; UFES-MAM 3075). Scale bar = 10 mm (Credit: Heitor Bissoli).

For accurate identification at the species level, we also used molecular approaches. In
a BLAST search we found 98% identity with published sequences of C. agricolai. Through
phylogenetic inference it was possible to identify the specimen as C. agricolai, since the
sample of UFES-MAM 3075 was grouped with other previously identified specimens of the
same species, in a highly supported clade (Bayesian posterior probability = 1). Maximum
likelihood and Bayesian inference trees depicted the same topology - only the latter is here
represented (Fig. 2). The sister status of C. agricolai and C. chacoensis, was also strongly
supported, and these two taxa formed a marginally supported clade including C. guahybae,
with C. unduaviensis as the outermost clade, then composing a monophyletic group for the
genus Cryptonanus. Through systematic searches in online academic databases, it was
possible to compile unambiguous records of C. agricolai in the literature (Table 2), and to
estimate the current extent of occurrence (minimum convex polygon) for the species in 1 773
398 km², (Fig. 3).

DISCUSSION
The specimen here identified as Cryptonanus agricolai represent the first record of the
species in the Central Atlantic Forest Corridor (Brazil 2006; Camara & Galindo-Leal 2009), a
region formerly considered outside its distributional range (Carmignotto et al. 2016).
Previously, two records of Cryptonanus had already been registered in the Atlantic Forest;
however, in both cases the authors did not identify the specimens at species level (see Souza
et al. 2010; Delciellos et al. 2016). Therefore, the present study expands the extent of
occurrence of the species in 324 452 km² (Fig. 3; hatched area), updating to 1 773 398 km²
the total area of occurrence. Additionally, our record from Pinheiros, state of Espírito Santo,
set the lower altitudinal limit for C. agricolai at 108 m above sea level (Table 2). Moreover,
according to the geographical coordinates of a trap site mentioned in Bonvicino et al. (2012)
we inferred what can be recognized as the highest altitudinal limit of the species: 850 m; an
increase of almost a 100 m of that previously suggested (400 to 760 m; Gardner 2008).
Hence, we can now establish the altitudinal range of C. agricolai from 108 to 850m.
Besides changes in distributional and altitudinal ranges of C. agricolai, our work
confirms the occurrence of the species, often associated with xeric habitats and open
vegetation, in a central region of the Atlantic Forest domain, with points of occurrence far
from the contact zones of this biome with either the Cerrado or Caatinga domains. Although
the individual was captured in an ecoregion distinct from that usually related to C. agricolai,
the species can still continue to be associated with xeric-open habitats, since the sampling site
in Reserva Biológica Córrego do Veado is dominated by patches of vegetation called
Mussununga Such formations are characterized by phytophysiognomies ranging from
grasslands to woodlands over sandy soils that have high water retention, with a consistently
hard and impermeable cementation layer, which causes flooding stress in the rainy season and

drought stress in the dry season (Mecke et al. 2002; Horbe et al. 2004; Saporetti-Junior et al.
2012). Despite the fact that Mussununga formations are threatened by many factors (e.g. fire,
logging, road construction, and biological invasion), such kind of vegetation is still
underrepresented in the context of studies conducted in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
(Eisenlohr et al. 2015; Heringer et al. 2019).
In addition to C. agricolai, another species of the genus occurs in the South America
diagonal of open formations (e.g. Chaco, Cerrado and Caatinga domains; Prado & Gibbs
1993): C. chacoensis, which is widely distributed in Gran Chaco, but there is also records for
this species in southwest areas of the Cerrado Domain (Teta & Días-Nieto 2019). Since there
are strong evidence that each species may constitute a species complex, pending a formal
revision (Astúa 2015), and considering the possibility of sympatry between C. agricolai and
C. chacoensis in the southwest portion of Cerrado, as well as the morphological similarities
shared by them, we did not include in the updated occurrence map (Fig. 3) records of C.
agricolai provided by articles that report its occurrence in this area, but without detailed
description of identification diagnosis (Caceres et al. 2008; Martin et al. 2012; Hannibal &
Neves-Godoi 2015; Gonçalves et al. 2018). Although delimiting the western limits of C.
agricolai is somewhat outside the scope of our work, we emphasize the importance of
meticulous and comprehensive identifications, as well as descriptions of how species were
diagnosed when distribution records are given, especially in areas with possible sympatry of
cryptic genus and species.
When the genus was described, authors mentioned that significant range extensions of
Cryptonanus could be expected by surveys in extralimital savanna landscapes, specially by
pitfall trapping (Voss et al. 2005; Dias et al. 2015). In the Central Atlantic Forest Corridor
(Brazil 2006; Camara & Galindo-Leal 2009), small mammal surveys using pitfall traps are

still scarce (Bovendorp et al. 2017), despite their obvious and demonstrated efficiency to, trap
elusive species (Rocha et al. 2015). Protocols that include this and other alternative kinds of
trap methods could contribute largely to fill in many gaps on species distribution, as showed
here. The records presented herein as C. agricolai expanded the geographic distribution of the
species approximately 430 km eastward (UFES-MAM 3075; Fig. 3) and 360 km southward
(the recognition of MZUSP 35409 as C. agricolai), throughout an area of 324 452 km²
(hatched area; Fig. 3). This augment corresponds to a 22% of increase in the extent of
occurrence previously known for the species and indicates that C. agricolai distribution is
significantly larger, extending over a substantial portion of the Atlantic Forest ecoregion.
