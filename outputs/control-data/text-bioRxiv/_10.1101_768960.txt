Abstract
The ability to modify behavior based on prior experience is essential to an animal’s

16

survival. For example, animals may become attracted to a previously neutral odor or reject a

17

previously appetitive food source upon learning. In Drosophila, the mushroom bodies (MBs) are

18

critical for olfactory associative learning and conditioned taste aversion, but how the output of

19

the MBs affects specific behavioral responses is unresolved. In conditioned taste aversion,

20

Drosophila shows a specific behavioral change upon learning: proboscis extension to sugar is

21

reduced after a sugar stimulus is paired with an aversive stimulus. While studies have identified

22

MB output neurons (MBONs) that drive approach or avoidance behavior, whether the same

23

MBONs impact proboscis extension behavior is unknown. Here, we tested the role of MB

24

pathways in modulating proboscis extension and identified 10 MBON split-GAL4 lines that upon

25

activation significantly decreased proboscis extension to sugar. Activating several of these lines

26

also decreased sugar consumption, revealing that these MBONs have a general role in modifying

27

feeding behavior beyond proboscis extension. Although the MBONs that decreased proboscis

28

extension and ingestion are different from those that drive avoidance behavior in another context,

29

the diversity of their arborizations demonstrates that a distributed network influences proboscis

30

extension behavior. These studies provide insight into how the MB flexibly alters the response to

31

taste compounds and modifies feeding decisions.

Introduction
A key role of the brain is to prioritize relevant sensory information to guide behavior.
Animals exhibit innate behaviors to a variety of sensory stimuli including tastes and odors, and

36

the ability to modify those behaviors based on contextual cues and prior experience is essential

37

to an animal’s survival.

38

In Drosophila, the mushroom body (MB) has long been implicated as a center for

39

learning and memory, and has been studied most extensively in the context of olfactory

40

associative learning (1–4). The dendrites of the principal cells of the MB, Kenyon cells (KCs),

41

receive sparse, random synaptic inputs from olfactory projection neurons (5). The parallel axonal

42

fibers of the KCs form the MB lobes, the output region of the MB. The axonal lobes comprised

43

of ~2000 KC axons are beautifully organized into 15 compartments, defined anatomically by the

44

dendrites of 21 types of MB output neurons (MBONs) (6). These compartments also contain the

45

axon terminals of 20 types of dopaminergic neurons (DANs), which similarly tile the MB lobes.

46

The DANs convey signals of reward or punishment for sensory associations (7-14). In Pavlovian

47

terminology for a classical conditioning paradigm, the odor is designated the conditioned

48

stimulus (CS), and the DANs carry the unconditioned stimulus (US).

49

In the current model of olfactory associative learning, behavior is determined through the

50

summation of activity in different MB compartments. Some compartments encode approach

51

behavior, and others encode avoidance (15). In a naïve animal, the total valence carried by the

52

positive and negative compartments is in balance, and thus there is no observed approach or

53

avoidance behavior. During olfactory aversive learning, the balance tips towards avoidance

54

behavior: long-term depression is thought to decrease the output in a compartment that signals

55

positive valence (16). Using similar logic, after appetitive olfactory learning, DANs carrying a

56

rewarding signal decrease the activity in aversive MBONs, leading to increased acceptance. The

57

sum of synaptic changes drives the overall behavior toward avoidance or acceptance, thereby

58

modifying the innate behavior.

59

In support of the model that individual MBONs encode a positive or negative valence,

60

the behavioral roles of MBONs have been investigated through direct activation (15, 17).

61

Optogenetic activation of some MBONs causes approach behavior, while activation of other

62

MBONs causes avoidance behavior (15). Activation of other MBON subsets causes neither

63

approach nor avoidance. A different subset of MBONs has been found to play a critical role in

64

odor-seeking behavior (18). Although these studies argue that diverse MBONs can influence

65

behavior, it is unclear whether MBONs signal a positive or negative valence in the context of

66

multiple behaviors or how MBONs impact feeding behaviors like proboscis extension.

67

How do the outputs of the MBs influence specific behaviors? One possibility is that MB

68

outputs alter the probability of response to a given sensory stimulus, promoting or inhibiting the

69

response, independent of the nature of the response. In this model, MB outputs would serve to

70

gate the probability of actions but not participate in action selection. One prediction of this model

71

would be that the MBONs that signal a positive valence and promote approach might promote

72

other behavioral responses as well. An alternative model is that MBON activity has behavioral

73

specificity. For example, the MBONs that promote approach might be different from the

74

MBONs that promote ingestion. To begin to examine this question, we tested the role of MB

75

pathways in modulating an innate behavior, proboscis extension to sucrose.

76

The fly gustatory system is an excellent model to study how MB pathways modulate

77

innate behaviors, as feeding decisions may be altered by learned associations, and importantly,

78

there is a clear behavioral readout: the proboscis extension response (PER). For example, during

79

conditioned taste aversion, a paired application of sugar to the tarsi and bitter to the proboscis

80

results in a reduction of PER to sugar alone (19–22). During conditioned aversion, taste

81

information is transmitted from the subesophageal zone (SEZ) to the MBs for learned

82

associations (22–24). While studies have found that some components of the MBs are required

83

for taste memory formation (22, 24, 25), how MBONs impact innate proboscis extension

84

behavior has not been resolved.

85

In this study, we test the role of MB pathways in modulating PER. We find that a subset

86

of MBONs drives inhibition of proboscis extension. Specifically, we identified 10 MBON split-

87

Gal4 lines that upon activation significantly decreased proboscis extension to sugar. Inhibiting

88

neural activity in these MBON split-Gal4 lines did not reciprocally regulate proboscis extension.

89

Activating several of the identified MBON split-Gal4 lines also decreased sugar consumption,

90

revealing that these MBONs have a more general role in the feeding circuit beyond the proboscis

91

extension motor program. In addition, activating dopaminergic inputs in 3 MB compartments

92

also suppressed proboscis extension to sugar. The MBONs that decrease proboscis extension and

93

ingestion are different from those mediating avoidance in another context. The diversity of

94

MBON compartments that influences PER demonstrates that a distributed network influences

95

behavior and is consistent with the role of MBs in generating context-dependent behavioral

96

biases.

Activation of MBONs suppresses proboscis extension

100

To identify the MB outputs that modulate proboscis extension, we screened 35 previously

101

described split-Gal4 lines that cover the 21 MBON types (15). We used the red-light-activated

102

ion channel CsChrimson to optogenetically activate split-Gal4 lines. Flies were raised on

103

standard cornmeal food (controls) or all-trans-retinal-supplemented food (experimental animals)

were starved for 1 day before being tested for proboscis extension. Proboscis extension was

105

tested in response to simultaneous 635 nm light illumination to activate MBONs and 100 mM

106

sucrose presentation to the tarsi. For 12 lines, we found that activation with CsChrimson caused

107

a significant decrease in proboscis extension to sucrose (Fig 1A). One line (MB323B) had motor

108

defects and leg folding upon activation and was excluded from further study.

The 11 lines showing reduced proboscis extension upon MBON activation were re-tested

133

for proboscis extension to a range of sucrose concentrations (10, 100, 350, 1000 mM) with and

134

without CsChrimson activation of MBONs. Ten of the 11 lines showed significantly reduced

135

proboscis extension to several sucrose concentrations upon CsChrimson activation (Fig 1B). One

136

line (MB062C) did not show a phenotype upon retesting and was excluded from further study

137

(Fig 1B). Importantly, the decrease in proboscis extension was not due to fly paralysis, as

138

determined by measuring walking speed in a locomotor assay (Fig S1). The 10 MBON split-Gal4

139

lines that reduced proboscis extension are not localized to any single compartment or lobe.

140

Instead, their neurites arborize in 7 of the 15 mushroom body compartments and the calyx and

belong to 7 different MBON cell-types: γ4>γ1γ2, α1, β'1, γ2α'1, α'2, α2sc, and the calyx (Fig

Inhibition of MBON candidates does not influence proboscis

145

As activation of several MBON split-Gal4 lines decreased proboscis extension to sucrose,

146

we hypothesized that reducing neural activity in those MBONs would cause a reciprocal increase

147

in PER. To test this, we expressed a temperature sensitive, dominant negative dynamin, Shibirets,

148

using a transgene that drives strong expression (20xUAS-Shits1) in the 10 MBON split-Gal4 lines

149

that influenced proboscis extension. Flies were stimulated with 100 mM sucrose applied to the

150

proboscis at 30–32°C to inhibit vesicle reuptake or at ~22°C as same genotype controls. Flies

151

tested at 30–32°C were pre-incubated for 15 minutes prior to the start of the experiment on a 30–

152

32°C heating block. Only 1 line, MB078C, showed increased PER at the restrictive temperature

153

(Fig 2A).

effects A) MBON lines identified in our activation screen were conditionally silenced with

157

20xShibirets and PER to tarsal sugar presentation (100 mM sucrose) was recorded. Silencing with

158

this method caused an increase in one line (MB078C). n = 18-59. Permissive temperature= 20-22°C,

159

restrictive = 30–32°C. B) MBON candidates were conditionally silenced with 1xShibirets and PER

160

to 50 mM sucrose on the legs was recorded. Silencing MBONs with this method caused an increase

161

in PER rate in one line (MB310C). n = 20-74. C) Candidates were silenced acutely with the light-

162

gated anion channelrhodopsin 20xgtACR1 and PER to 10 mM sucrose on the legs was recorded.

163

Silencing MBONs with this method increased PER to sucrose in one line (MB242A). n = 16-36. For

Because the strong Shibire effector has been reported to produce phenotypes at the

permissive temperature (15), we repeated these experiments using the weaker 1xUAS-Shits1. We

169

also altered the behavioral paradigm to stimulate with 50 mM sucrose instead of 100 mM

sucrose, as PER to 100 mM sucrose under control conditions was high, creating the possibility of

171

ceiling effects. Under these conditions, 1 of the 10 MBON split-Gal4 lines (MB310C) showed

172

increased proboscis extension upon neural silencing (Fig 2B).

173

Finally, we tested an additional acute silencing strategy that provides rapid light-triggered

174

hyperpolarization. The light-gated anion channelrhodopsin, gtACR1, was expressed in candidate

175

MBON lines. Flies were stimulated with 10 mM sucrose, as this concentration produced ~50%

176

PER in genotype controls. For each MBON line, the same genotype was examined in the

177

presence of 635 nm light for neural silencing or under control conditions. We found 1 line

178

(MB242A) where acute silencing with gtACR1 increased proboscis extension (Fig 2C).

179

Taken together, the neural silencing experiments argue that the MBON split-Gal4 lines

180

that inhibited proboscis extension when activated do not consistently alter proboscis extension

181

when inhibited. One explanation may be that proboscis extension to sugar is modulated by

182

MBONs although they are not a required component of the sensorimotor circuit. Instead, the

183

proboscis extension motor program may be controlled by local SEZ circuits and an alternative

184

pathway may relay taste information to the higher brain for learned associations. Alternatively,

185

MBONs may not be intrinsically active and blocking activity in neurons that are already silent

186

may not produce a phenotype. Another possibility is that multiple MBONs may need to be

187

silenced in order to produce a phenotype (15). Regardless, these studies demonstrate that

188

inhibiting single classes of MBONs does not strongly influence proboscis extension to sucrose.

189

MBON activation also affects sugar consumption

190

We next asked whether MBONs have a more general role in influencing feeding behavior

191

beyond the simple proboscis extension motor program. To address this, we investigated the

192

effect of MBON split-Gal4 line activation on sucrose consumption. We hypothesized that the set

193

of MBONs whose activation suppresses proboscis extension would also decrease sucrose

194

consumption. In flies starved 24 hours, we measured consumption of 100mM sucrose while

195

activating the 10 MBON split-Gal4 lines with a PER suppression phenotype using the red-light

196

gated channel 10xChrimson88. Comparing consumption in the presence of red light (for

197

activation) to consumption without red light (controls), we found that 3 lines (MB078C,

198

MB311C, and MB242A) consumed less sugar upon activation (Fig 3). These MBONs provide

199

inputs to the β'1 compartment, the α1 compartment and the MB calyx, respectively.

Screen for MB DANs regulating PER
In the current model of the MB, activity is balanced between different compartments to

209

drive overall behavior. The dopaminergic inputs to MB compartments are thought to change the

210

strength of synaptic connections between MB neurons and MBONs, mainly through their inputs

211

onto the KCs conveying sensory information (15, 26, 27). Whether those synaptic connections

212

are weakened or strengthened appears to be context-dependent and compartment-specific: in

213

some studies DANs inhibit MBON outputs through long term depression (LTD) (16, 17, 28–31),

214

while in other studies DANs have been reported to potentiate KC to MBON connections (17, 32–

215

34). The timing of the DAN and sensory inputs is critically important for determining synaptic

216

potentiation or depression (16, 35).

217

To investigate whether specific DANs modulate PER and whether they are associated

218

with the same compartments innervated by MBONs that influence PER, we conducted an

219

unbiased screen of DANs. Since activating MBONs innervating γ4>γ1γ2, α1, β'1, γ2α'1, α'2,

220

α2sc, and the calyx suppressed PER, we hypothesized that the DANs innervating those same

221

compartments would cause an increase or decrease in PER.

222

To conduct the screen, we crossed 33 DAN split-Gal4 lines to 10x UAS-Chrimson88, and

223

recorded proboscis extension to sucrose. Flies starved 24 hours were stimulated with 10 mM

224

sucrose presented to the tarsi in the absence (controls) or presence of red light to activate DANs

225

and tested for proboscis extension. This sucrose concentration was chosen to provide a dynamic

226

range capable of detecting increases or decreases in PER rates. Upon activation with red light, 4

227

lines showed decreased PER to sucrose (Fig 4). Activation of one line (MB438B) caused legs to

228

fold in the red light condition and was thus excluded from analysis. The remaining DAN lines

229

causing decreased PER mainly innervate the PAM-β'2(amp) and PAM-α1 compartments (as well

230

as weakly PAM-γ5 and PAM-β1).

240
241

In addition to these lines whose activation decreased PER, we also found one DAN split-

242

Gal4 line whose activation caused spontaneous PER: MB296B, a split-Gal4 for PPL-γ2α’1 (Fig.

243

4). We re-tested this line with the effector CsChrimson and found robust PER to red light (Fig.

244

S2A). Chronic silencing of these neurons with the inward rectifying potassium channel Kir2.1

245

resulted in increased PER compared to genetic controls (Fig S2B). Acute silencing with gtACR1

246

did not have a significant effect (Fig S2C). MB296B labels some neurons outside PPL-γ2α’1 in

247

the SEZ where gustatory sensory axons terminate and proboscis extension motor neurons are

248

located (Fig. S2D). To address the contribution of non- PPL-γ2α’1 in MB296B, we used an

249

intersectional strategy to restrict CsChrimson expression to the SEZ using a Hox gene promoter

250

that overlaps with the expression of MB296B (Fig. S2D). In flies that express the red-light

251

activated channel in the SEZ neurons of MB296B, there was PER to red light in some flies (Fig.

252

S2E), suggesting that the SEZ neurons are responsible for some of the PER phenotype. Since red

253

light induced PER in only a small fraction of flies expressing CsChrimson in the SEZ neurons, it

254

is possible that a combination of the SEZ neurons and the PPL neurons contributes to proboscis

255

extension.

revealed that 10 MBON split-Gal4 lines reliably decreased PER to sucrose. In addition, 3 lines

261

linked to decreased PER also decreased sucrose consumption upon activation. None of the

262

MBONs with activation phenotypes showed consistent reciprocal phenotypes upon decreasing

263

neural activity. We also examined whether activation of DAN inputs into the MBs influenced

264

PER to sucrose and identified 3 lines that decreased PER (Fig 5). These studies provide insight

into how MBONs influence taste responses and encode behavior.

label (purple for PAM and blue for PPL). MB051B, MB051C, and MB077B contain dendrites in 2

273

compartments. The α1 compartment is the one MB compartment whose activity consistently

274

influenced feeding behavior (both PER and consumption). This diagram was modified from Figure

275

17 in (28).

276
277

The current model of MBON function proposes that each MBON has a positive or

278

negative valence and the combined activity of MBONs determines whether the stimulus is

279

attractive or aversive. Consistent with this model, previous studies have identified MBONs that

280

drive approach and others that drive avoidance. Here, we tested MBONs to see whether they

281

affect PER to sucrose and found that several MBON split-Gal4 lines (MB298B, MB310C,

282

MB311C, MB078C, MB051B, MB051C, MB077B, MB080C, MB242A, and MB622B)

283

decreased PER. Of these, optogenetic activation studies have implicated MB298B in innate

284

avoidance and MB077B in innate approach (28). The other MBONs that decreased PER did not

285

show approach or avoidance behavior upon optogenetic activation. MB077B has also been

286

shown to be required for food and odor seeking behavior in hungry flies (18), and silencing

287

MB310C increases food seeking behavior (18). Additionally, MB080C has been previously

288

described as having a PER suppression phenotype upon activation (22); the other lines identified

289

here were not tested.

290

The observation that the majority of MBONs that suppress PER are different from those

291

that cause innate avoidance or decrease yeast seeking argues against a simple model where

292

MBONs have a fixed valence and activity is additive. Instead, the finding that the MBONs for

293

PER inhibition are different from those that drive avoidance or decreased seeking suggests two

294

different models for MBON function. One model is that MBONs have behavioral specificity,

295

such that there are different MBONS for PER versus avoidance. An alternative model is that the

296

context in which MBONs are activated determines their contribution to behavior. In our studies,

297

flies were starved for 24 hours and were presented with sucrose. Both starvation and sucrose

298

detection influence activity in MBs and may alter net MBON activity and the contributions of

299

specific MBONs to behavior (9). Thus, our results do not distinguish whether different MBONs

300

contribute to different behaviors or whether different MBONs have different weights in different

301

contexts. Future studies are warranted to distinguish these models. However, given the number

302

of MBONs that suppress PER and the number of compartments they innervate, the behavioral

303

specificity model seems unlikely. Instead, these results are consistent with a more nuanced

304

picture in which the role of MBONs in influencing behavior is context-dependent. Importantly,

305

our studies argue against the notion that MBONs that drive aversion in one context are

306

universally aversive in all contexts.

307

The finding that many MBONs reduce the probability of proboscis extension is consistent

308

with the view that the MB is a complex, distributed circuit. The lines with the greatest PER

309

suppression phenotype cover 7 different cell types: γ4>γ1γ2, α1, β'1, γ2α'1, α'2, α2sc, and the

310

calyx, demonstrating that multiple compartments can influence this behavior (Fig. 5). In

311

addition, 3 dopaminergic inputs into the MBs were also sufficient to regulate PER. These

312

innervate the PAM-β'2(amp) and PAM-α1 compartments as well as weakly label PAM-γ5 and

313

PAM-β1. There is no clear correlation between the DAN and MBON compartments that inhibit

314

PER, as only the α1 compartment contains DANs and MBONs decreasing PER. Although the

315

DAN activation experiments demonstrate that MB inputs are also sufficient to influence PER,

316

how DAN activation propagates to MBONs to regulate behavior in these experiments is

317

unresolved. It is possible that simultaneous activation of multiple DANs would elicit stronger

318

effects on behavior.

319

One caveat with these studies is that artificial activation is not physiological and tests the

320

case of strong activation. Under physiological conditions, there are likely more nuanced

321

dynamics that drive behavior. Still, we find strong evidence that multiple MB compartments are

322

able to modulate proboscis extension and feeding behavior.

323

Unlike activation, conditional silencing of MBONs had modest effects on PER in our

324

study, suggesting many parallel pathways or compensatory mechanisms. One possibility is that

325

proboscis extension is mediated by local SEZ circuits and modulated by MBONs. In this

326

scenario, PER circuits may be influenced by MBONs but MBONs do not normally contribute to

327

the behavior. Alternatively, multiple MBONs may contribute to the behaviors, such that

328

silencing a large number of MBONs may be necessary to see a strong phenotype.

329

Overall, this work investigated how the activity of MB inputs and outputs impinges on

330

feeding behavior by characterizing mushroom body neurons that impact proboscis extension to

331

sucrose. We demonstrate that activation of several MBONs and DANs influences proboscis

332

extension to sucrose, consistent with the view that a distributed network of MB compartments

333

modulates behavior.

343

Drosophila stocks were maintained at 25°C except those containing temperature-

344

sensitive transgenes (Shibirets) which were raised at 19°C. Flies were reared on standard fly food,

345

except in experiments involving CsChrimson, Chrimson88, and gtACR1, which were transferred

346

to food containing 0.4mM retinal prior to experiments.

350

Mated female flies, 4-9 days post-eclosion, were used for behavioral studies. Animals
were starved for 20-26 hours in a vial with a kimwipe wet with 3 mL double distilled water.
For optogenetic experiments, flies with UAS-Chrimson88, UAS-CsChrimson, or UAS-

351

gtACR1 transgenes were raised in the dark at 25°C. Two days prior to testing, flies were

352

transferred to fresh food with 0.4 mM all-trans retinal (Sigma). Flies were then starved on a wet

353

kimwipe with the same retinal concentration. For activation experiments (CsChrimson,

354

Chrimson88), flies were assayed one at a time with 635 nm light (LaserGlow). Silencing with

355

gtACR1 was done using a custom-built LED panel (530nm) or 530-535nm laser (LaserGlow).

356

For 1xShibirets and 20xShibirets experiments, flies were reared at either 19°C or 23°C. During

357

the experiment, mounted flies were incubated at 30–32°C on a heating block for 15 minutes prior

358

to the start of and throughout the experiment. For Kir2.1 experiments, flies were reared at 25°C.

359

Proboscis Extension Response Assay

360

PER was performed as described (45), except that each animal was treated as an

361

independent data point. Briefly, flies were mounted on glass microscope slides with nail polish

362

or UV glue (12 flies /slide for optogenetic experiments, and 36 flies/ slide for Kir2.1 and Shibire

363

experiments), and allowed to recover for 15 minutes before being placed in a dark, humidified

364

chamber for 2-5 hours. Prior to testing and between trials, flies were allowed to drink water ad

365

libitum.

366

In the CsChrimson screen, we simultaneously activated MBONs while presenting 100

367

mM sucrose to the tarsi. This concentration was chosen because it is a moderately appetitive

368

stimulus that results in proboscis extension ~50% of the time in control flies. Flies were water-

369

satiated before the experiment and between trials, and presented with the tastant and red light

370

until proboscis extension was observed, for up to 5 seconds. Flies were given a score of 0 (for no

371

extension) or 1 (for full extension), and the average was taken across two trials.

372

For thermogenetic silencing experiments (20xShibirets and 1xShibirets), flies were

373

assayed with 100 mM sucrose and 50 mM sucrose, respectively. For Kir2.1 experiments, flies

374

were presented 30 mM sucrose.

375

For subsequent optogenetic (Chrimson88, gtACR1) PER assays with both MBONs and

376

DANs, flies were assayed using 10 mM sucrose because 50 mM sucrose elicited close to 100%

377

PER in the dark condition for some lines.

378

Temporal Consumption Assay

379

Temporal consumption assays were performed as described (23). Flies were glued onto

380

glass slides using nail polish or UV glue, then allowed to recover in a humidified chamber for 2-

381

4 hours. Each fly was water-satiated, then presented with 100 mM sucrose on the proboscis and

382

forelegs. Cumulative drinking time over 10 consecutive presentations was recorded.

383

Locomotor Assay

384

Flies were gently aspirated into a circular bowl chamber made of 1.5% agarose, 44 mm in

385

diameter [Bidaye et al., unpublished]. The stimulation protocol was 60s off, 30s pulsing 633nm

386

light at 50 Hz. Light was delivered using a custom LED panel. Freely moving flies were

387

videotaped under IR illumination using a Blackfly camera. The movie was subsequently

388

analyzed using the Ctrax software suite version 0.3.9 (46). The total distance walked was

389

computed and used to generate a mean distance traveled for each genotype assayed.

Immunohistochemistry

391

Dissection and immunohistochemistry of 9- to 14- day old female fly brains were

392

performed using the Janelia split-Gal4 screen protocol (https://www.janelia.org/project-

393

team/flylight/protocols) with small modifications: the incubation time for both primary and

394

secondary antibodies was 3-7 days. Primary antibodies were chicken anti-GFP (Life

395

Technologies, 1:500) and mouse anti-nc82 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City,

396

IA 1:500). Secondary antibodies were (both Invitrogen at 1:100): 488 anti-chicken, 647 anti-

397

mouse. Images were acquired on a Zeiss confocal microscope. Brightness and contrast were

398

adjusted using FIJI.

399

Statistical Analyses

400

Statistical analyses were done using R (ggPubR). For PER in response to red light and

401

sucrose in the CsChrimson screen, Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests with Bonferroni correction for

402

multiple comparisons were used to compare the PER rate in retinal-exposed vs. no-retinal

403

animals. For all other optogenetic PER assays, paired Wilcoxon tests with Bonferroni correction

404

were used, since individual animals were tested both in the dark and light conditions. For PER

405

experiments with Shi unpaired Wilcoxon tests were used since different populations of

406

genetically identical animals were tested at the permissive temperature (22°) and the restrictive

407

temperature (32°). For TCA experiments, Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests were used with Bonferroni

408

correction for multiple comparisons.

illumination with a camera, and then subsequently analyzed using ctrax and custom matlab

514

scripts. The stimulation protocol was 3x (60s off, 30s on pulsing 633nm light at 50 Hz), and a

515

total of 5 minutes of video was recorded for each trial. A) Velocity heat map, each row is an

516

individual fly. Genotypes are denoted. B) Box and whiskers plot of average velocity over 3 trials,

517

for light off and light on periods. Each data point is one fly, whiskers = 10th to 90th percentile,

518

box = 25th to 75th percentile, and line in box = median. Statistical significance was calculated

519

using unpaired Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests with Bonferroni correction, *p<0.05, **p<0.01,

520

***p<0.001. C) Bounded line plots. For each fly, the average velocity over 3 trials of (60s Light

521

Off, 30s Light On) was calculated. The black line represents the mean average trial velocities of

522

n = 16-20 flies for each genotype; the shaded grey areas represent the standard error. MBON

523

split-Gal4 lines crossed with UAS-CsChrimson are on top, paired with the genetic controls of

524

MBON split-Gal4 lines crossed with w1118, bottom. The red line marks the beginning of the light

525

on period at 60s.

527

to UAS-Chrimson88 and UAS-CsChrimson for light induced activation, and tested for proboscis

528

extension in 3 conditions: (1) red light alone, (2) 30 mM sucrose to the tarsi, and (3)

529

simultaneous red light and sucrose presentation to the tarsi. Extension rates were compared

530

between each condition in the same fly and between different fly genotypes of the same

significance was calculated using paired Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests (same flies, different

533

conditions) or unpaired Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests (flies of different genotypes, same treatment

534

condition) with Bonferroni correction, *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001. Green bars represent flies given

535

sucrose and red light. Grey bars represent flies given sucrose. B) MB296B was inhibited with

536

Kir2.1 and PER to 30 mM sucrose on the legs was recorded. Silencing with Kir2.1 increased

537

PER (n = 44-56, Mean ± SEM). Statistical significance was determined by Wilcoxon Rank Sum

538

tests with Bonferroni correction, *p<0.05. C) Candidates were silenced with 20xgtACR1 and

539

PER to 30 mM sucrose on the legs was recorded, in the absence and presence of green light. n =

540

47, mean ± SEM. Statistical significance was determined by a paired Wilcoxon test. D) Top:

Projection pattern of MB296B. Bottom: Projection pattern of the SEZ neuron labeled by

542

MB296B, as determined by an intersection between the Hox gene scr and MB296B. E) MB296B-

543

split-Gal4 was crossed to 20xUAS-dsFRT-CsChrimson.mVenus; LexAop-FLP/CyO; scr-

544

LexA/TM2 flies for light induced activation, and tested for proboscis extension to light (n = 31.)

545

Of these 31 flies, 7 were also tested for their responses to 30 mM sucrose to the tarsi, and

546

simultaneous red light and sucrose presentation to the tarsi as well. Statistical significance was

547

calculated using Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests, **p<0.01.
