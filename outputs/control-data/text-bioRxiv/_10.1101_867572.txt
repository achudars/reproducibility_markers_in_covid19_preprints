Abstract

9

Moisture levels are a crucial meteorological factor affecting all epidemiological stages of foliar

10

diseases, but their effect on pathogen development has been much less studied that of

11

temperature, for example. There has been no detailed investigation of the tolerance or

12

adaptation of pathogen populations to contrasting or changing moisture conditions. We

13

investigated differential tolerance to moisture stress in the wheat fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria

14

tritici at the individual and population levels. We retained 48 genetically different isolates from

15

populations originating from two Euro-Mediterranean climatic zones – Ireland and Israel – with

16

very different moisture conditions (annual air relative humidity – RH – of 85.1% vs. 69.7%,

17

respectively). We assessed the responses in planta of these isolates to four different moisture

18

regimes imposed on wheat seedlings during the first three days after inoculation (RH of 88.3%,

19

92.2%, 96.1% and 100%). Visual assessments of lesion development conducted at 14, 17 and

20

20 dpi were performed to establish individual- and population-level moisture reaction norms

21

expressing the sporulating area of the pathogen on inoculated leaves for the mean RH over the

22

three days following inoculation. Our findings highlight: (i) the critical effects of moisture

23

regime on the development of Z. tritici during the earliest infection stages (pycnidiospore

moisture adaptation signature in a fungal pathogen of plants. These findings provide insight

into drought stress tolerance and the diversity of its responses between pathogen individuals

and populations in terms of the likely effects of climate change on plant disease epidemics.

Introduction

36

Micrometeorological factors within the plant canopy define the physical environment in which

37

fungal pathogens live and develop (Campbell and Norman, 1998; Chelle, 2005). Temperature

38

and moisture are critical physical factors that govern each epidemiological stage of foliar

39

diseases (Agrios, 2005). The presence, abundance and persistence of moisture determine

40

whether the biological processes of infection (Yarwood, 1992), and colonization accelerate,

41

slow or stop altogether, with consequences for the incubation and latent periods (Huber, 1992),

42

spore production (Rotem et al., 1978) and release (Ingold, 1978). The effects of temperature

43

have been studied in detail, but much less is known about the precise effects of moisture levels

44

and thresholds, whether considered in terms of relative humidity (RH) or leaf wetness (presence

45

of water films and droplets), on pathogen and disease development.

46

This gap in our knowledge may reflect the experimentally greater challenge of controlling,

47

measuring and reporting moisture conditions (Rowlandson et al., 2015). RH is defined in

48

physical terms and can be measured as the ratio of the partial pressure of water vapor to

49

the equilibrium vapor pressure of water at a given temperature. Wetness, by contrast, is not easy

50

to define and is not a standard meteorological measurement. Leaf wetness duration (LWD) is

51

also very difficult to measure as different parts of the leaves may be wet and dry at different

52

times, both in the field and in controlled conditions (Huber & Gillespie, 1992).

53

Several epidemiological studies have identified prolonged wetness as an important factor, and

54

several disease-forecasting models contain the variable LWD (Rowlandson et al., 2015). Fewer

55

studies have focused on RH requirements for optimal infection; some have established that the

56

RH threshold (the level below which infection does not occur) differs between types of

57

pathogens. RH requirements can be very high for some fungal species (e.g. 90% for

58

Magnaporthe oryzae, Li et al., 2014; 95% for Didymella rabiei, Jhorar et al., 1998).

59

Studies of the response of a fungal pathogen to moisture conditions at the leaf scale during the

60

earliest stages of infection (incubation period) are particularly relevant, because this period,

61

together with the spore release and dispersal stages, is one of the most sensitive to LWD and

62

RH in the vast majority of pathogens. Septoria tritici blotch, caused by Zymoseptoria tritici,

63

formerly known as Mycosphaerella graminicola, is a highly relevant biological model in this

64

context, because of its long latent period (i.e. asymptomatic stage), spanning from 15 to 35 dpi,

65

depending on temperature (Shaw, 1990).

66

The impacts of post-inoculation LWD and of the duration and interruption of the wet period on

67

Z. tritici have been analyzed in detail in controlled conditions (Holmes, 1974; Shearer &

68

Zadoks, 1972; Eyal, 1977; Hess et al., 1987; Chungu et al., 2001; Magboul et al., 1992; Shaw,

69

1990; Shaw, 1991; Fones et al., 2017). Moisture appears to be crucial at all stages of the cycle

70

(Shaner et al., 1975). An increase in RH favors an increase in overall infection rate (penetration

71

of leaf tissues via the stomata; Kema et al., 1996), hyphal growth and pycnidiation intensity

72

(Shaw, 1991; Fones et al., 2017). RH is of particular importance because early penetration (<

73

24-48 h) is rare, with spores germinating rapidly on the leaf and epiphytic growth occurring

74

over a period of up to 10 days or more (Fones et al., 2017). RH has been inferred to be optimal

75

between 72 and 96 h, at 100% (Shipton et al., 1971; Chungu et al., 2001; Suffert et al., 2013),

76

and pycnidiation has been reported to occur at an RH of 35-100% (Pachinburavan, 1981).

77

However, threshold RH levels have not been formally tested, except for 50%-75%-100%

78

comparisons (Shaw, 1991), probably because it is technically more difficult to generate

79

different RH conditions in parallel than to modulate LWD under the same RH conditions. The

80

RH threshold for Z. tritici therefore remains unknown. The duration of leaf wetness has also

81

been shown to have critical effects on infection, pycnidiation and, in some cases, the duration

82

of the latent period (Chungu et al., 2001; Shaw, 1990). These experimental results are supported

83

by the importance of the presence and duration of moisture (particularly LWD) for the

84

prediction of septoria tritici blotch epidemics in wheat (Hess & Shaner, 1987; Markham, 1992).

85

Reviews on the impact of climate change on plant diseases have stressed the importance of

86

focusing on changes in temperature and rainfall patterns (Garrett et al., 2006). Global climate

87

models (GCMs) predict more frequent and extreme rainfall events and higher atmospheric

88

water vapor concentrations with increasing temperature (Kirk-Davidoff et al., 1999;

89

Huntingford et al., 2003). Until recently, it was difficult to obtain LWD and RH, which

90

critically influence plant pathogen infection and disease development, from GCM outputs

91

(Chakraborty et al., 2000). It had been suggested that higher levels of canopy moisture

92

promoted the development of a range of foliar pathogens, but this factor was never considered

93

essential and was rarely taken into account in discussions on the effects of climate change on

94

plant diseases (e.g. West et al., 2012). However, the changes in RH are likely to be at least as

95

marked as those in temperature in semi-arid zones, such as the area around the Mediterranean

96

basin (Vicente-Serrano, 2007). The predicted slight decrease in the duration of wet periods and

97

slightly warmer conditions will probably have opposite effects, decreasing and promoting

98

infection, respectively, and detailed modeling approaches are therefore required to predict the

99

overall outcome.

100

This paradigm shift will require an understanding of the diversity of responses and levels of

101

adaptation of pathogen populations to contrasting RH conditions. This understanding can be

102

developed by identifying differences in moisture responses between pathogen genotypes within

103

the same species, and, more generally, by characterizing the intra- vs. inter-population

104

phenotypic variability connected to genetic differentiation at neutral marker loci to reveal local

105

adaptation (Merilä & Crnokrak, 2001).

106

RH may have been much less considered than temperature to date because there are more

107

convenient methods for thermal phenotyping (e.g. Zhan & McDonald, 2011; Boixel et al.,

108

2019a) than for moisture phenotyping (Li et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2016). Assessments of the

109

differences in response to temperature in vitro (tests conducted without interaction with the

110

plant) are biologically meaningful and can be reasonably extrapolated (Boixel et al., 2019a).

111

By contrast, differences in the response to humidity must necessarily be performed in planta

112

(tests conducted in interaction with the plant), particularly for the early stages of infection (e.g.

113

spore germination, epiphytic growth, stomatal penetration).

114

We investigated the diversity in moisture responses in Z. tritici, at the individual and population

115

levels, for two natural populations collected from contrasting climatic zones (humid vs. dry

116

environment). We evaluated the variation of the aggressiveness of the individuals of these

117

populations on wheat seedlings subjected to four moisture regimes.

Methods
Fungal material
We chose to investigate two Z. tritici populations collected from contrasting Köppen-Geiger
Euro-Mediterranean climatic zones (Peel et al., 2007): (i) an Irish population (IR) sampled on
cultivar JB Diego from a single field at Carlow (52°83’65’’ N - 6°93’41’’ E) in July 2016 (Cfb,
oceanic climate); (ii) an Israeli population (IS) sampled on cultivar Galil from a single field at
Kiryat-Tivon (32°71’62’’ N - 35°12’74’’ E) in March 2017 (Csa, hot-summer Mediterranean
climate). These two populations, which have already been characterized for thermal adaptation
and genotyped for 12 neutral genetic markers (Boixel et al., 2019b), originate from
environments with different mean RH conditions (85.1% vs. 69.7%, respectively), mainly due
to marked differences in mean temperature and rainfall regimes over the year (Figure 1). We
selected 24 IR and 24 IS Z. tritici isolates from these populations for sequential studies in three
experimental series in which isolates were screened in a growth chamber under different
moisture regimes but in identical temperature conditions.
Plant material
The 48 isolates were phenotyped on the highly susceptible bread wheat cultivar, ‘Taichung 29’,
commonly used as a susceptible check cultivar (Kema et al., 2000) in the screening of wheat
germplasm (Makhdoomi et al., 2015) or in tests of global panels of Z. tritici isolates (Zhong et
al., 2017). Wheat seeds were sown in 0.4-liter pots, so as to obtain three seedlings per pot. The
pots were kept in a growth chamber, under a controlled light/dark cycle (16 hours of light at
300 mol.m-2.s-1 - Osram Lumilux L58W/830 - at 22°C / 8 hours of dark at 18 °C).

Inoculation procedure

Isolates were grown in Petri dishes containing PDA (potato dextrose agar, 39 g L-1) at 18°C, in
the dark, for five days. Conidial suspensions were prepared by flooding the surface of the fiveday-old cultures with sterile distilled water and then scraping the agar surface with a sterilized
glass rod to release the conidia. The density of conidia in the suspension was adjusted to 105
conidia.mL-1 with a Malassez counting chamber. We added two drops of surfactant (Tween 20,
Sigma) to each suspension to ensure adequate coverage of the inoculated leaf surface. A
paintbrush was used to inoculate the 7.5 cm mid-length portion of the second leaf of six twoweek-old seedlings with each of the isolate suspensions.
Differential exposure to moisture regimes during the incubation period
After inoculation, the plants were split into two identical groups assigned to two experimental
blocks, under four RH regimes. We decided to modulate RH conditions during the crucial early
stages of infection (Fones et al., 2017), and, more specifically, over the first three days postinoculation, to cover the time required for penetration (Kema et al., 1996; Duncan and Howard,
2000; Cousin et al., 2006). The four RH regimes were obtained by covering plants with
transparent polyethylene bags for different periods of time after inoculation (0, 1, 2 and 3 days,
respectively; Figure 2). These bags did not maintain visible drops of moisture on leaves, but
they favored condensation, as the plant transpired in a closed space. Previous studies have
demonstrated that free water on the leaf surface is not required for infection (Shaw et al., 1991;
Suffert et al., 2013). Plants were exposed to 100% RH when covered with polyethylene bags,
whereas uncovered plants were exposed to 100% RH in the dark and to a RH of about 80% (on
average) during light periods.
Air temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) in the growth chamber were automatically
recorded, every 15 minutes, with a ventilated sensor. For characterization of the RH sensitivity
of the isolates through comparisons of their moisture reaction norms (see ‘Data analyses’

section below), we summarized the four moisture regimes in terms of the mean RH prevailing
during the three-day-post-inoculation period: 88.3% (C0), 92.2% (C1), 96.1% (C2) and 100%
(C3). We chose not to characterize each moisture regime by the duration of time for which RH
= 100 %. Indeed, there is no evidence to suggest that a RH of 80 %, which is higher than the
RH value below which infection is thought to be impossible (RH = 50%; Shaw, 1991) but below
the "driest" conditions tested here, can prevent fungal growth and stop infection.
Disease assessment
Disease severity was assessed by eye, by the same assessor, at 14, 17 and 20 dpi (days postinoculation), as the percentage of the inoculated leaf surface (1, 2, 3 and 5%, then increments
of 5% up to 100%) displaying chlorosis (chlorotic area), necrosis (necrotic area, including both
sporulating and non-sporulating area) and visible fruiting bodies or pycnidia (sporulating area).
Data analysis
Effect of moisture conditions on disease severity – The experimental and biological main
effects on the variability of sporulating area (SPO, expressed as a percentage of the inoculated
leaf surface) and their interactions were assessed by a statistical modeling approach. We
investigated the partitioning of the variability into eight different components of variation
(deviance): series (S), block (B), RH conditions (H), population (P), isolate I(P), RH conditions

× population interaction (H×P), RH conditions × isolate interaction (H×I(P)), residuals (sbpih).
We analyzed these deviance components, by fitting a generalized linear model (GLM) with a
log-link function and quasi-Poisson errors to account for overdispersion, according to the
following model (R glm function; R Core Team, 2018): SPOsbpih = S + B + P + I(P) + H + H×P
+ H×I(P) + sbpih. Post-hoc comparisons of differences in SPO means (multivariate analysis of

variance) and homoscedasticity (Levene’s test) between IR and IS populations were performed
to investigate differences in inter- and intra-population responses to moisture conditions.
Establishment of individual moisture reaction norms – Individual moisture reaction norms,
describing the pattern of SPO as a function of relative humidity, were established for each
isolate. Reaction norms were assumed to be linear within the investigated 80-100% RH range
and were therefore estimated by a linear regression y = a.x + b. Individual reaction norm
properties were summarized by three parameters accounting for sensitivity to RH: (i) the
intercept ‘b’ corresponding to the elevation or the sensitivity to the driest environment; (ii) the
steepness of the slope ‘a’ corresponding to the response to variation, i.e. whether phenotypic
responses increased or decreased in extreme environments and to what extent; (iii) the midpoint
‘y94.2%’ corresponding to the average response or the response at the midpoint of the RH range,
to consider shifts in the entire reaction norm. The heterogeneity of RH sensitivity across isolates
at the individual level and the difference between IR and IS population-level moisture reaction
norms were assessed on the basis of these three parameters.
Differentiation in individual and population responses – Phenotypic differentiation in terms
of the intercept, slope and midpoint was compared to between-population neutral genetic
differentiation, to determine the potential for local adaptation of moisture responses (PST - FST
comparisons performed with the ‘Pstat’ R package). Neutral genetic variability, and the
structure and distribution of diversity between and within the IR and IS populations were
characterized in a previous study (Boixel et al., 2019b) based on microsatellite genotyping data
acquired for 12 SSRs (ST1, ST2, ST3A, ST3B, ST3C, ST4, ST5, ST6, ST7, ST9, ST10, ST12
neutral microsatellites; Gautier et al., 2014). In parallel, components of phenotypic variation in
the response to the four moisture regimes (C0, C1, C2, C3) were extracted by principal
component analysis. We projected all four-fold phenotypes onto a two-dimensional space and

clustered the isolates (hierarchical classification on principal components, HCPC) on the basis
of their sensitivities to the four moisture regimes (‘FactoMineR’ and ‘factoextra’ R packages).

Results
Overall effect of the experimental conditions
The block (B) and series (S) effects were significant. Our experimental design provided strong
control over RH conditions (saturation-level application), but these experimental effects are
probably due to the spatial and temporal variability of other micrometeorological conditions
reported to occur within growth chambers, even under controlled conditions (e.g. gradient in
irradiance intensity due to artificial lighting; Poorter et al., 2012). Mean RH had a significant
effect on sporulating area at all times of disease assessment (14, 17 or 20 dpi; p-value < 0.01;
Table 1, Figure 3). The significant differences in sporulating area induced by different Z. tritici
isolates (I(P)) confirmed the genetic origin of the variability in aggressiveness. The population
effect (P) was significant at 14 dpi, when sporulating area was greater for IS than for IR isolates
under the C0, C1 and C2 regimes (Figure 4). Significant H×I(P) and H×P interactions
highlighted differential individual and population-level tolerance to the four moisture regimes
(Table 1). At 14 dpi, differences in the mean sporulating area (post-hoc analysis of the HP
interaction, i.e. the interaction of moisture regimes and differential population-level response
to these conditions) and its intrapopulation variance (Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance)
between the IR and IS populations were significant (p-value < 0.05; Figure 4). At 17 dpi, these
differences were small and did not differ significantly between the two populations; they had
completely disappeared by 20 dpi.
Significant effect of moisture during the early stages of infection

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/867572; this version posted December 6, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

The temporal dynamics of the effect of moisture regimes justified the sequential fitting of
GLMs at 14, 17, and 20 dpi (Figure 3): at 14 dpi, the differences in sporulating area between
C0-C1 and C2-C3 highlighted a dichotomy between unfavorable and favorable RH conditions,
probably separated by a threshold at about 94% RH. At 17 dpi, the differences between the four
moisture regimes C0, C1, C2 and C3 were larger and significant. At 20 dpi, there were no longer
any differences, due to saturation being reached for sporulating area (100%). In summary, from
0 to 3 dpi, the closer the RH to 100%, the more intense the development of lesions. Indeed, a
slight difference in moisture regime during the very early stages of Z. tritici infection, despite
the relatively high RH value of the driest conditions tested (88.3%), had a strong impact on the
dynamics of lesion development. Any increase in average RH bringing it closer to 100%
favored the development of the isolate during the early stages of infection.
Comparisons of tolerance to drier conditions are best performed at 14 dpi
Sporulating areas at 14 dpi were significantly larger for IS isolates on wheat plants subjected to
the C0-C1-C2 regimes, whereas no significant difference was observed for C3 (Figure 4),
highlighting the greater tolerance of drier conditions in the IS population. No difference was
observed between the populations at 17 and 20 dpi (no statistically significant H×P interaction,
although this interaction was close to significance at 17 dpi; p-value < 0.1), suggesting that the
driest regimes delayed infection processes but did not prevent Z. tritici development. These
results led us to perform further analyses at 14 dpi, through comparisons of ‘moisture reaction
norms’ or ‘response curves’, to assess the differences between isolates within these two
pathogen populations in more detail.
Interindividual differences in moisture adaptation within the two populations at 14 dpi
The comparison of individual reaction norms (Figure S1), particularly for density distributions,
and the ranges of values for the three parameters capturing the general characteristics of the

response (intercept, slope, midpoint), highlighted high levels of interindividual variation in
moisture sensitivity (Figure 5). Mean phenotypes did not differ significantly between the two
populations (Wilcoxon rank sum test; differences in mean response assessed for the intercept:
p-value = 0.33; slope: p-value = 0.39; midpoint: p-value = 0.92), but individual variation was
greater for the midpoint coefficient in the IS population (Bartlett test of homogeneity of
variance; p-value < 0.01). For the population-level linear moisture reaction norm, a significant
difference in sporulating area was observed between the IS and IR populations for C1
(Wilcoxon rank sum test, p-value = 0.03), but not for the other three moisture regimes (p-value
> 0.05). This suggest that RH conditions may have been too restrictive or detrimental for the
expression of biological differences and variance for the trait under the C0 regime, whereas
they were not limiting for C2 and C3. Neutral markers highlighted no differences in genetic
structure between the IR and IS populations (Figure S2). PST values (computed at the critical
c/h² ratio of 1) and their confidence intervals at c/h2 = 1 indicated a robust difference between
PST and FST (Figure S3). Thus, any phenotypic difference can be interpreted as a result of
adaptation, suggesting that interindividual differences in moisture adaptation within the two
populations may conceal signatures of local adaptation.
Classification of Z. tritici sensitivity to the four moisture regimes
Based on a PCA of phenotypic variation, we were able to classify the 48 Z. tritici isolates
according to their sensitivity to the four moisture regimes (Figure 6). At 14 dpi, the C2 and C3
regimes did not discriminate between individual responses in terms of sporulating area. Cluster
4 consisted of isolates with a particularly large sporulating area (extreme phenotypes of is16,
is19 and is34; Figure S1) that were less affected by the C0 and C1 regimes.

Effect of moisture conditions during the early stages of Z. tritici infection
In this experimental study, we established individual- and population-level moisture reaction
norms, expressed as the area of Z. tritici sporulation on inoculated leaves for a RH averaged
over the three days following inoculation. By this approach, we were able to assess the critical
effects of moisture regime on the development of septoria tritici blotch during the earliest stages
of infection (pycnidiospore germination, epiphytic hyphal growth and stomatal penetration)
despite the relatively high RH value of the driest regime tested (88.3%). It also made it possible
to refine the findings of several previous studies performed in our range of experimental
conditions (Holmes, 1974; Shearer & Zadoks, 1972; Eyal, 1977; Hess et al., 1987; Chungu et
al., 2001; Magboul et al., 1992; Shaw, 1990; Shaw, 1991; Fones et al., 2017). The effects of
moisture conditions were more pronounced at 14 dpi than at 17 and 20 dpi. Based on these
results, we analyzed the data acquired at 14 dpi in more detail, to determine moisture sensitivity
at both the individual and population levels. These findings also raise the question as to why
the effects of moisture conditions are less pronounced at 17 and 20 dpi. Fones et al. (2017)
previously showed that increasing leaf moisture is associated with increasing disease severity
(number of pycnidia per leaf), because it decreases the time required for Z. tritici to penetrate
into leaf tissues. This finding is consistent with our results, suggesting that moisture conditions
have a greater impact on the rate at which symptoms appear than on their final intensity. We
may hypothesize that suboptimal moisture regimes have slowed epiphytic hyphal growth and
penetration into the leaf tissues via the stomata, but that they did not ultimately reduce the
germination rate or infection efficiency, at least for the RH values which were tested here.
Epiphytic development was probably slower during the daytime periods, when wheat leaves
were not bagged, resulting in a ‘delay’ in the infection process rather than an ‘irreversible’
ending of this process. This hypothesis could be tested with direct experimental approaches
based on cytological observations or indirect approaches measuring infection efficiency,

defined as the proportion of pathogen spores able to infect susceptible plant tissues once they
have landed on them, which could be assessed by methods based on the time‐resolved imaging
of disease progress (Karisto et al., 2019).
Technical limitations: moving towards in vitro tests for minimizing background noise?
Even under controlled conditions, growth chambers are subject to spatiotemporal fluctuations
in within-chamber conditions, particularly as concerns the distribution of light intensity (Potvin
& Tardif, 1988; Poorter et al., 2012). Such spatial patterns of heterogeneity may have
contributed to the block effect we detected in our experimental design, whereas differences in
inoculation conditions (e.g. abiotic factors, spore virulence levels) might also explain the
differences in symptom expression between series (Kay et al., 2019). One possible
improvement to experimental methods, making it possible to screen larger numbers of isolates
in a more standardized way (making it easier to separate environmental and physiological
responses), would be to control and test moisture conditions in vitro, with the experimental
devices proposed by Li et al. (2014; different RH conditions formed within humidity chambers
obtained with different glycerol solution concentrations) or Xu et al. (2016; discrete RH
gradient formed in spatially separated wells of a modified multiwell plate), for example. This
would have the advantage of countering the effect of the host resistance × environmental
response interaction on the expression of aggressiveness in isolates (Ahmed et al., 1996),
although, in our experiment, the two Z. tritici populations were similarly aggressive on the
cultivar 'Taichung 29'. In vitro approaches may be particularly relevant for Z. tritici, as they
have been shown to be a reliable proxy for the assessment of differences in thermal sensitivity
(Boixel et al., 2019a).
First evidence of moisture adaptation in a fungal plant pathogen

Our results highlight strong individual variations in the phenotypic plasticity of Z. tritici with
respect to sensitivity to RH conditions. Notwithstanding the relatively limited sample size (48
isolates) and number of populations (n = 2) investigated here, this study revealed, for the first
time in a fungal plant pathogen, the existence of individual variation in responses to moisture
conditions. Moreover, the Israeli population was shown to be more tolerant to drier conditions
at 14 dpi and we found no genotypic differentiation for neutral microsatellite loci between the
two populations. This result highlights a moisture adaptation signature, again, the first to be
reported for a fungal plant pathogen, and is consistent with the climatic conditions of the areas
from which the two populations were collected.
The interaction between RH and isolate effects was significant, whenever disease was assessed,
highlighting the importance of taking the interindividual variation in response to moisture
conditions into account. Differences in moisture sensitivity were analyzed at both the
population and individual levels. The moisture performance curves highlighted sensitivity
variations between the two populations. The differences in the mean values of the parameters
characterizing this sensitivity were not significant. However, the interindividual analysis
revealed significant differences in moisture sensitivity between isolates, suggesting that it
would be possible to quantify such differences more accurately in future experiments. This
would require the study of larger numbers of individuals and more stringent moisture
conditions.
The estimation of interactions between moisture and temperature adaptation at both
population and individual levels is ambitious, but technically possible
The Israeli and Irish Z. tritici populations studied here are part of a Euro-Mediterranean set of
eight populations included in a broader study on thermal adaptation (Boixel et al., 2019b).
General ecological concepts, knowledge and methods have been developed to a greater extent

for thermal biology than for moisture biology (Angiletta, 2009). The estimation of interactions
between moisture and temperature adaptation would also be relevant at both population and
individual level. For this purpose, Z. tritici is an interesting case, both because a physical
relationship between the two microclimatic variables, temperature and moisture, has been
established (Shaw & Royle, 1993; Pietravalle et al., 2003), and because the development of
septoria tritici blotch is known to be strongly influenced by both variables (Markham, 1992).
The interactions between temperature and moisture effects could be studied from a mechanistic
angle (for instance, testing pleiotropy vs. co-selection hypotheses in the genetic determinism of
such a dual adaptation) but also from an epidemiological angle (predicting the consequences of
climate changes affecting plant disease development in a more holistic way). The comparison
of differences between temperature and moisture responses in different pathogen populations,
starting with the Israeli and Irish populations, is particularly interesting because moisture
adaptation is already interconnected with thermal adaptation in some models (e.g. Shinozaki &
Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, 2000; Mutamiswa et al., 2019).
How best to characterize individual variations of phenotypic plasticity and sensitivity to
RH conditions in Z. tritici?
This study did not aim to determine the moisture limit below which Z. tritici isolates cannot
infect wheat, but we can nevertheless unambiguously conclude that a “RH as close as possible
to 100% is best for Z. tritici”. The minimal RH threshold for Z. tritici remains unknown. Shaw
(1991) previously showed that breaks at 50% relative humidity had large effects but
nevertheless enabled infection to occur. We can assume that there is a threshold moisture (a
lethal condition definitively blocking the infectious process), like that for temperature, but
previous studies in Z. tritici and general knowledge about the epidemiology of fungal disease
suggest that a minimum threshold, rather than a maximum, must be taken into account (as RH,
by definition, cannot exceed 100%), together with a time period during which RH remains

below this minimum threshold. Conversely, for temperature, the lethal threshold that should be
considered is a maximum value, because Z. tritici can survive the thermal conditions of winter
and freezing at -80°C in laboratory conditions.
We used averaged RH conditions to describe the moisture regimes, which limits comparisons
with published data, as most previous studies focused on the duration of moisture periods rather
than variations of RH values sensu stricto (Shaw, 1991; Magboul et al., 1992; Chungu et al.,
2001). However, we found that this was the most pragmatic approach to the establishment and
comparison of moisture performance curves. As mentioned above, in addition to RH, leaf
wetness duration is crucial, as different parts of the leaves may be wet and dry at different times
(Huber & Gillespie, 1992). More generally, the question of how best to describe RH conditions
remains unresolved: averaging, intermittent favorable/unfavorable conditions, etc. How can the
effect of the putative minimum moisture threshold (still unknown) be linked to the effect of the
duration of dry periods? To which microclimatic variables are the individuals and populations
really (mal)adapted? These questions should be addressed. As for moisture, it has been
experimentally demonstrated that Z. tritici responds to ‘leaf temperature’ (similar to ‘body
temperature’ for animals) rather than ‘air temperature’ (Bernard et al., 2012), and that the time
step for measurement is important (Bernard, 2012). These conclusions can also be extended to
moisture.
Additional studies on adaptation to very suboptimal moisture regimes (e.g. 50-75% RH) rather
than regimes close to the optimum (e.g. 85-100% RH) should be considered: (i) for
methodological reasons, because this would probably maximize the expression of adaptation,
making it easier to characterize experimentally, with populations contrasting less than the
Israeli and Irish populations studied here; (ii) for epidemiological reasons, because it would
provide knowledge to improve predictions of the adaptation of Z. tritici populations on bread
and durum wheat in dryland farming areas (e.g. in Middle East and North Africa) in response

to climate change. Such aims are ambitious and the studies will need to take into account the
difficulties involved in experimental studies of the effects of moisture.
The exploitation of relevant analyses based on biological data requires attention to the issue of
‘drought stress tolerance’ and an extension of reflections to the ecology of communities (Sheik
et al., 2011). Our study provides preliminary insight into such drought stress tolerance and the
diversity of its responses across individuals and populations when considering the effects of
climate change on plant disease epidemics. A knowledge of the microclimatic requirements for
fungal pathogen development is essential for prospective studies of the impact of climate
change with a solid experimental basis. To date, such studies have mostly focused on
temperature, but climate change in the global context will also include large changes in moisture
conditions with pronounced domino effects (Siepielski et al., 2017).

Table 1 - Analysis of the deviance of sporulating area (SPO in %) induced by 48
Zymoseptoria tritici isolates on wheat seedlings exposed to four RH regimes (see Figure
2) at 14, 17 and 20 dpi. A quasi-Poisson generalized linear model with a log-link function
was fitted to experimental data, to assess the relative importance of the factors considered for
the observed variation: series (S), block (B), RH conditions (H), population (P), isolate I(P),
RH conditions × population interaction (H×P), RH conditions × isolate interaction (H×I(P)).
The values reported in the table correspond to the components of deviance and their
corresponding p-values (P).

Fig. 1 - Relative humidity (RH) conditions and precipitation at the two sampling sites. (a) Mean annual RH in the Euro-Mediterranean area (data from the
Atlas of the Biosphere, http://atlas.sage.wisc.edu/; New et al., 1999); (b) mean monthly RH and rainfall distribution (1982-2012 data from the World Climate
Database, https://en.climate-data.org/) at the sites from which the two Zymoseptoria tritici populations were collected (Carlow in Ireland for the IR population;
Kyriat-Tivon in Israel for the IS population). The horizontal gray bar indicates the standard wheat-growing period (from sowing to harvest).

Fig. 2 - Moisture regimes investigated over the three first days post-inoculation (dpi). Solid (from 0 to 3 dpi) and dotted (after 3 dpi) lines depict the four
post-inoculation moisture regimes to which the wheat seedlings were subjected in the early stages of infection: C0 = without bagging (mean RH = 88.3%); C1
= bagged for one day (mean RH = 92.2%); C2 = bagged for two days (mean RH = 96.1%); C3 = bagged for three days (mean RH = 100%). White and gray
areas indicate successive light and dark periods, respectively.

Fig. 3 - Effect of moisture regime (C0, C1, C2, C3; see Figure 2) on the percentage of sporulating area (SPO) induced by Zymoseptoria tritici, by
disease assessment time (14, 17, 20 dpi). Medians are indicated by the lines at which the notches converge, and different letters indicate significant
difference in SPO between experimental conditions in post-hoc tests.

Fig. 4 - Dynamics of the effect of moisture regime (C0, C1, C2, C3; see Figure 2) on the percentage of sporulating area (SPO expressed as the mean ±
SEM) in the early stages of Zymoseptoria tritici infection, by isolate origin - Ireland (IR; solid line) or Israel (IS; dashed line) - and the timing of
disease assessment (14, 17, 20 dpi). Significant differences in the mean (post-hoc analysis of the H  P interaction, i.e. the interaction of moisture regimes
and differential population-level response to these conditions) and the intrapopulation variance (Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance) of SPO between
IR and IS populations are highlighted by black and gray stars, respectively (p-value < 0.05).

Fig. 5 - Variation of Zymoseptoria tritici response to moisture conditions at the population (IR: Irish population, IS: Israeli population) and individual
levels, at 14 dpi. (a) Population-level moisture reaction norms (mean RH prevailing over the first three days after inoculation, expressed as a %) for the IR
(black circles/solid line) and IS (gray triangles/dashed line) populations. The corresponding linear regression lines fitted to the percentage of sporulating area
(SPO, expressed as the mean ± SEM) are displayed with their 95% confidence intervals. (b) Interindividual variation of the three chosen descriptors of
individual moisture reaction norms: intercept (b), slope (a) and midpoint (y94.2%). Crude individual values (open circles), means (horizontal black thick lines),
distributions (smoothed density curves) and 95% Bayesian highest density intervals (central rectangular boxes enclosing the means) are shown for each
descriptor for which interindividual variation is displayed by population (IR, IS).

Fig. 6 - Classification of Zymoseptoria tritici sensitivity to the four moisture regimes (C0, C1, C2, C3; see Figure 2) at 14 dpi. (a) Principal component
analysis (PCA) biplot showing Irish (IR, black points) and Israeli (IS, gray points) isolates plotted in two dimensions, using their projections onto the first two
principal components to summarize their response (SPO, i.e. percentage of sporulating area) under the four moisture regimes. HCPC clusters of individual
responses are shown as colored areas on the factorial plane. (b) Relative proportions of the four identified clusters in the IR and IS populations. (c) Reading
grid for the clustering of isolates based on their responses to the four moisture regimes: SPO significantly lower (-) or higher (+) than the dataset mean (0).

Fig. S1 - Individual moisture reaction norms at 14 dpi for (a) the 24 Irish (IR) and the (b) 24 Israeli
(IS) Zymoseptoria tritici isolates. Sporulating areas (SPO) are expressed as a percentage of the
inoculated leaf area for each isolate (except ir7, due to unsuccessful inoculation), in response to four
moisture conditions characterized by the mean RH prevailing during the three-day period immediately
after inoculation (see Figure 2). Linear regression lines (in blue) and their 95% confidence intervals
were fitted independently to experimental observations (dark points corresponding to six seedling wheat
leaves per isolate  moisture conditions).

Fig. S2 - Genetic subdivision of the 48 Zymoseptoria tritici isolates composing the Irish (IR) and
Israeli (IS) populations. Bar plot displaying the Bayesian genetic clustering of IR and IS populations
according to 12 SSR markers. The STRUCTURE algorithm was applied under the admixture and
correlated allele frequencies model (500,000 iterations of the Markov chain followed by a run phase of
1,000,000 iterations with 10 independent replicates for each tested number of clusters). Each isolate is
represented by a single vertical bar broken into two color segments, the lengths of which are proportional
to the probability of to the isolate being assigned to the inferred genetic clusters (K = 2). No population
structure was detected because each individual was affected to the three genetic clusters with similar
probabilities.

Fig. S3 - Phenotypic divergence in moisture reaction norms between the IR and IS populations. Sensitivity analyses exploring the robustness of PST–FST
comparisons over variations in the c/h2 ratio, which determines the accuracy of the approximation of QST by PST. Phenotypic divergence in individual moisture
reaction norms between populations (PST) was investigated for the intercept, slope and midpoint parameters. On each plot, estimates of PST (solid line in red)
and FST (dashed line in green) are shown, to reveal the contrasting patterns of phenotypic responses to moisture conditions and neutral genetic divergence. The
PST values displayed (computed at the critical c/h² ratio of 1) and their confidence intervals at c/h2 = 1 indicate the occurrence of a robust difference between
PST and FST, suggesting the existence of signatures of local adaptation.
