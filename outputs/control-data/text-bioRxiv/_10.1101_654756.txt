Abstract

40

A mosaic of cross-phyla chemical interactions occurs between all metazoans and their

41

microbiomes. In humans, the gut harbors the heaviest microbial load, but many organs,

42

particularly those with a mucosal surface, associate with highly adapted and evolved

43

microbial consortia1. The microbial residents within these organ systems are increasingly well

44

characterized, yielding a good understanding of human microbiome composition, but we have

45

yet to elucidate the full chemical impact the microbiome exerts on an animal and the breadth

46

of the chemical diversity it contributes2. A number of molecular families are known to be

47

shaped by the microbiome including short-chain fatty acids, indoles, aromatic amino acid

48

metabolites, complex polysaccharides, and host lipids; such as sphingolipids and bile acids3–

49

11

50

in both health and disease. Considering the diversity of the human microbiome, numbering

51

over 40,000 operational taxonomic units12, a plethora of molecular diversity remains to be

52

discovered. Here, we use unique mass spectrometry informatics approaches and data

53

mapping onto a murine 3D-model13–15 to provide an untargeted assessment of the chemical

54

diversity between germ-free (GF) and colonized mice (specific-pathogen free, SPF), and

55

report the finding of novel bile acids produced by the microbiome in both mice and humans

56

that have evaded characterization despite 170 years of research on bile acid chemistry16.

. These metabolites profoundly affect host physiology and are being explored for their roles

57

Main
In total, 96 sample sites, covering 29 organs, producing 768 samples (excluding

60

controls, Fig. S1) were analyzed from four GF and four colonized mice by LC-MS/MS mass

61

spectrometry and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The metabolome data was most strongly

62

influenced by organ source, but as expected, the microbiome was dictated by colonization

63

status (Fig. 1a,b). GF mice and sterile organs in SPF mice clustered tightly with background

64

sequence reads from blanks (reflecting their sterility), whereas colonized organs within the

65

SPF mice clustered apart from these samples (Fig. 1a,b). Mapping the principle coordinate

66

values of the two data types onto the murine 3-D model showed how the gut samples were

67

similar, but important differences were observed, including separation of the stool sample

68

from the upper GI tract in the metabolome but not in the microbiome, and similarity between

69

the esophageal and gut microbiomes. The strongest separation in the metabolome between

70

colonization states was present in the stool, cecum, other regions of the GI tract, and

71

samples from the surface of the animals including ears and feet (Fig. 1c). The liver also had

72

signatures suggestive of metabolomic differences between the GF and SPF mice, but these

73

were not significant compared to the within individual variation (Fig. 1, Fig. S2).

74

Molecular networking is a novel spectral alignment algorithm that enables identification

75

of unique molecules in mass spectrometry data and the relationships between related

76

spectra14. Applying molecular networking to this comprehensive murine dataset identified

77

7,913 unique spectra (representing putative molecules) of which 14.7% were exclusively

78

observed in colonized mice and 10.0% were exclusive to GF (Fig. 2). Although the overall

79

profiles exhibited the strongest difference in the GI tract, molecular networking showed that

80

all organs had some unique molecular signatures from the microbiome, ranging from 2% in

81

the bladder to 44% in stool (Fig. 2). As expected, the metabolome of the cecum, site of

82

microbial fermentation of food products, was profoundly affected by the microbiota, but other

83

GI sites had weaker signatures. Spectral library searching enabled annotation of 8.86% of

84

nodes in the molecular network (n=700 annotated nodes13,17); which included members of the

85

molecular families of plant products, such as soyasaponins and isoflavonoids (sourced from

86

the soybean (Glycine max, f. Fabaceae) component of mouse chow), host lipids and

87

microbial metabolic products (Fig. 2a). Many of the unique signatures attributed to the

88

microbiome were the result of metabolism of plant triterpenoids and flavonoids from food

89

(Supplemental Data, Fig. S3, S4). These effects were location specific, indicating that the

90

microbiome inhabits spatially distinct and varied niche space throughout an organism,

91

exerting location-dependent effects on host physiology through the metabolism of xenobiotics

92

and modification of host molecules.

93

The strong impacts from the microbiome in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract led to deeper

94

analysis of the molecular changes in this organ system. A random forests classification was

95

used to identify the most differentially abundant molecules between the GF and SPF GI

96

tracts. The metabolome of both the GF and SPF mice changed through the different sections

97

of the digestive system (Fig. 3a). While changes through the upper GI tract were subtle in GF

98

mice, SPF animals had progressive transitions in this region (Fig. 3a). A major transition

99

occurred between the ileum and cecum in both groups, but the specific molecules that were

100

changing were different between them (Fig. 3a). Many unique metabolites in SPF mice were

101

unknown compounds, but known molecules were also identified including bile acids and

102

soyasaponins (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Data, Fig. S3,S5). The Shannon diversity index of the

103

GF and SPF mouse metabolome was mirrored in the upper GI tract, both being low in the

104

esophagus and higher in the stomach and duodenum, however, upon transition to the cecum,

105

the diversity of the two groups of mice began to separate (Fig. 3c,d). The molecular diversity

106

in the cecum and colon of colonized mice was significantly higher than GF mice (Mann-

107

Whitney U-test), but not in the stool samples (Fig. 3c).

108

We also compared the changing microbial community through the GI tract in the

109

context of the changes observed in the molecular data. Similar to the metabolites,

110

microbiome transitions were observed traversing the GI tract (Fig. 3b). The corresponding

111

microbial diversity of the colonized animals showed a similar profile to the metabolome,

112

mostly stable through the upper parts of the system and then abruptly increasing at the

113

cecum, followed by a decrease in the colon and stool (Fig. 3d). However, an interesting

114

contrast was observed where a high diversity of the metabolome in the duodenum

115

corresponded to a lower microbial diversity. We hypothesize that this contrasting result was

116

due to the secretion of bile acids from the gallbladder at this location. Because these

117

molecules possess antimicrobial properties, their high abundance may explain the lower

118

microbial diversity in the upper GI tract18, while simultaneously, microbial modification of the

119

molecules increases their molecular diversity. After the duodenum, changes in the diversity of

120

microbiome and metabolome were closely aligned, but colonized mice had greater molecular

121

diversity in the cecum and colon. This shows that microbial activity in these organs was

122

altering the molecules present, particularly bile acids, soyasaponins, flavonoids, and other

123

unknown compounds, which expanded the metabolomic diversity of the cecum

124

(supplementary results).

125

Molecular networking also enabled meta-mass shift chemical profiling19 of the GF and

126

SPF GI tract, which is an analysis of chemical transformations based on parent mass shifts

127

between related nodes without the requirement of knowing the molecular structure. For

128

example, a unique node found in colonized mice with an 18.015 Da difference represents

129

H2O and 2.016 Da is H2. In colonized animals, there was a strong signature for the loss of

130

water in the duodenum and jejunum and the loss of H2, acetyl and methyl groups in latter

131

parts of the GI tract (Fig. 3e,f). GF mice had notable mass gains corresponding to

132

monosaccharides in all regions of the GI tract, which were absent in SPF animals. Instead, a

133

mass gain of C4H8 was seen in the jejunum and ileum of SPF mice, which was associated

134

with the conjugated bile acid glycocholic acid (Fig. 3e,f). A significant portion of the

135

dehydrogenation and dehydroxylation mass shifts from the microbiome were associated with

136

bile acids, indicating that microbial enzymes acted on C-C double bonds of the cholic acid

137

backbone and removed hydroxyl groups, which is a known microbial transformation3.

138

Deacetylations were also prevalent in SPF animals, though the metabolites upon which these

139

losses were occurring remain mostly unidentified. Overall, both GF and SPF mice had many

140

cases of mass loss between related molecules, but there were comparably fewer molecules

141

in the colonized mice that showed gain of a molecular group (Fig. 3f). This indicates that the

142

microbiome contributes more to the catabolic breakdown of molecules and less to anabolism;

143

however, one interesting anabolic reaction that was detected was the addition of C4H8 on

144

glycocholic acid, which we subsequently investigated further.

145

Glycine and taurine conjugated bile acids were detected in both GF and SPF mice. As

146

they moved through the GI tract, the conjugated amino acid was removed in SPF mice only,

147

representing a known microbial transformation (Fig. S5,20). In the bile acid molecular network

148

that contained taurocholic acid and glycocholic acid there were modified forms of these

149

compounds that were only present in colonized animals. These nodes were related to the

150

glycocholic acid through spectral similarity and to the sulfated form (Fig. 4a) and one of them

151

corresponded to the addition of C4H8 described above. Analysis of the MS/MS spectra of the

152

three nodes m/z 556.363, m/z 572.358 and m/z 522.379 showed maintenance of the core

153

cholic acid, but with a fragmentation pattern characteristic of the presence of the amino acids

154

phenylalanine, tyrosine and leucine through an amide bond at the conjugation site in place of

155

glycine or taurine (Fig. S6). In the extensive bile acid literature, representing 170 years of bile

156

acid structural analysis and greater than 42,000 publication records in PubMed, the only

157

known conjugations of murine (and human) bile acids were those of glycine and taurine16.

158

Here, we have found a set of unique amino acid conjugations to cholic acid mediated by the

159

microbiome creating the novel bile acids phenylalanocholic acid, tyrosocholic acid and

160

leucocholic acid. These structures were validated with synthesized standards using NMR and

161

mass spectrometry methods (Supplemental methods and Fig. S7, S8, S9, S10, S11). These

162

uniquely conjugated bile acids were detected in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum of SPF

163

mice, with phenylalanocholic acid being the most abundant (Fig. 4). In comparison,

164

glycocholic acid was present in the latter parts of the GI tract (cecum and colon), whereas

165

taurocholic acid was most abundant in the upper parts of the GI tract (reduced through the

166

lower GI tract in SPF mice). The concentration of phenylalanocholic acid in mouse ileal

167

content from the four mice was 0.59 μM (s.d. 0.21) in the duodenum, 3.0 μM (s.d. 4.43) in the

168

jejunum and 5.25 μM (s.d. 2.42) in the ileum, with its highest concentration reaching 13.24

169

μM in a single jejunum sample (Fig. S12). These findings demonstrate that these novel amino

170

acid conjugates are abundant in the upper GI tract of mice on a normal soy-based diet and

171

require the microbiota for their production, but were subsequently absorbed, further modified,

172

or deconjugated again upon travel to the cecum.

173

Because GNPS is a public repository of mass spectrometry data from a wide variety of

174

biological systems, we used an analysis feature called “single spectrum search” to search all

175

739 publically available data sets for the presence of MS/MS spectra matching these

176

conjugated bile acids (April 27, 2018,13). Spectral matches corresponding to

177

phenylalanocholic acid, tyrosocholic acid and leucocholic acid were found in 19 other studies

178

comprising samples from the GI tract of both mice (with at least one conjugate found in 3.2 to

179

59.4% of all samples, Fig. S13) and humans (in 1.6 to 25.3% of all samples, Fig. S13). In a

180

crowd-sourced fecal microbiome and metabolome study at least one of these unique bile

181

acids was found in 1.6% of human fecal samples with tyrosocholic acid being the most

182

prevalent (n=490, the American Gut Project 21, Fig. 4b). They were found in higher frequency

183

in fecal samples collected without swabs, including studies of patients with inflammatory

184

bowel syndrome, cystic fibrosis (CF) and infants (Fig. 4b). Re-analysis of data from a

185

previously published study of the murine microbiome and liver cancer enabled a comparison

186

of the abundance of these molecules in mice fed a high-fat-diet (HFD) and treated with

187

antibiotics22, Fig. 4b). Supporting the role of the microbiome in their production, the

188

Phe/Tyr/Leu amino acid conjugates were decreased with antibiotic exposure, whereas

189

glycocholic acid, which is synthesized by host liver enzymes, was not. In contrast, these

190

microbial bile acids were more abundant in mice fed HFD, with no change observed in the

191

host conjugated glycocholic acid22. In a separate data set where atherosclerosis-prone mice

192

were similarly fed a HFD the novel conjugates were also increased over time, but not on

193

normal chow and the host-conjugated taurocholic acid did not change significantly (Fig. S14).

194

Finally, exploration into the metadata associated with a public study of a pediatric CF patient

195

cohort showed that there was a higher prevalence of these compounds in CF patients

196

compared to healthy controls, particularly those with pancreatic insufficiency (Fig. 4b).

197

Insufficient production of pancreatic lipase in the CF gut results in the buildup of fat and a

198

microbial dysbiosis23, which parallels the gut microbial ecosystem in mice fed HFD.

199

The first chemical characterization of a bile acid was in 184824, the first correct

200

structure of a bile acid related molecule was elucidated in 193225 and bile acid metabolism by

201

the microbiome has been known since the 1960s26. Since then, microbial alteration of bile

202

acids has been known to occur through four principal mechanisms: dehydroxylation,

203

dehydration and epimerization of the cholesterol backbone, and deconjugation of the amino

204

acids taurine or glycine3,27,28. Here, using a simple experiment with colonized and sterile

205

mice, we have identified a fifth mechanism of bile acid transformation by the microbiome

206

mediated by a completely novel mechanism: conjugation of the cholesterol backbone with the

207

amino acids phenylalanine, leucine and tyrosine. Further research is required to determine

208

the microbial producers of these compounds and their role in gut microbial ecology,

209

especially considering the important findings that microbiome based bile acid metabolism can

210

affect C. difficile infections29 or regulate liver cancer30. The findings reported here show that

211

all bile acid research to date have overlooked a significant component of the human bile acid

212

pool produced by the microbiome.

213

In conclusion, the chemistry of all major organs and organ systems are affected by the

214

presence of a microbiome. The strongest signatures come from the gut through the

215

modification of host bile acids and xenobiotics, particularly the breakdown of plant natural

216

products from food. Addition of chemical groups to host molecules were more rare, but those

217

that were detected were sourced from a unique alteration of host bile acids by the

218

microbiome that changes our understanding of human bile after 170 years of research16. As

219

the connections between us and our microbial symbionts becomes more and more obvious, a

220

combination of globally untargeted approaches and the development of tools that interlink

221

these data sets will enable us to identify novel molecules, leading to a better understanding of

222

the deep connection between our microbiota and our health.

through GI tract of novel microbiome associated bile acids in this murine study. Structures of

352

the previously known conjugates glycocholic acid, taroursocholic acid and taurocholic acid

353

are shown for comparison to structures of the newly discovered amino acid conjugates. The

354

molecular network of these bile acids is shown with mapping to the GF and SPF mice

355

according to the color legend. An inset highlighting the parent masses and mass differences

356

between the newly discovered molecules is shown for clarity. 3D-molecular cartography

357

maps the mean abundance and standard deviations of the mean of the newly discovered

358

conjugates onto a 3D-rendered model of the murine GI tract and the relative abundances of

359

the molecules through the GI tract samples compared to the host produced glycocholic acid

360

and taurocholic acid are also shown. b) Bar plots of the percent of samples positive for the
