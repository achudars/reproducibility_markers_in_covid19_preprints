Abstract

18
19

The evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding proteins HuR and MSI are essential for

20

multiple developmental processes and are upregulated in many cancer tissues. The C. elegans

21

homologues EXC-7 (HuR) and MSI-1 (MSI1 and MSI2) have been implicated in tubulogenesis,

22

neural development, and specific behaviors that include male tail-curling to maintain contact

23

with the hermaphrodite during mating.

24

Here, drug studies plus biochemical and genetic results indicate that MSI-1 affects serotonergic

25

signaling through stabilization of mRNA of the Gα protein GOA-1/GNAO1 in neurons, which in

26

turn affects activity of the serotonin synthase TPH-1/tryptophan hydroxylase via the response

element CRH-1/CREB.

This behavior is mediated by serotonin signaling.

EXC-7 (HuR) is also involved in this regulatory pathway. These results

Introduction

36

RNA-binding proteins (RBP) play vital roles in the translational regulation of gene

38

expression, mRNA distribution, stability, and degradation [1, 2].

The Hu/ELAV and Musashi

39

families of RNA-binding proteins have been particularly well studied. The ELAV family (from

40

Drosophila Embryonic Lethal Abnormal Vision [3]) has four members in humans: HuB, HuC,

41

HuD, and HuR [4]; and one nematode homologue, EXC-7 [5, 6]. These proteins are critical for

42

neural development, and affect stability and splicing of thousands of different mRNAs by

43

binding to 3’ UTRs (untranslated regions) of regulated mRNAs.

many mRNAs, including mRNAs encoding the Musashi RNA-binding proteins [11]. Similarly,

47

in C. elegans, EXC-7 regulates stability of multiple mRNAs, for example that of sma-1

48

(encoding the cytoskeletal protein βH-spectrin) required for long tubule integrity [5, 6], and also

49

regulates mRNA splicing [12] and synaptic transmission [13].

The ability of male C. elegans to mate efficiently requires tail flexures mediated by

61

signaling by the neurotransmitter serotonin [25, 26], a step defective in msi-1 mutants.

62

Serotonin is a neurotransmitter involved in many C. elegans behaviors, including locomotion [27,

63

28], defecation [29], pharyngeal pumping [30, 31-33], egg-laying [29, 34, 35], and male tail

64

flexure during mating [25, 26].

65

Since both serotonin and MSI-1 are required for male tail flexure, we have examined

66

possible interactions between these two components. Findings here indicate that the human

Gossypol inhibits C. elegans MSI-1 interactions with mRNA

81

Once attracted to a hermaphrodite, the C. elegans male places its genital gubernaculum

82

onto the hermaphrodite, and maintains contact while moving backward until sensory receptors in

83

the tail locate the vulva near the center of the animal [36-38]. If the male reaches the end of the

84

hermaphrodite before locating the vulva, the male tightly flexes its tail, maintaining contact, and

85

curls around the hermaphrodite to move backward along the other side of the animal. Several

86

passes may be required before the vulva is located [36]. The turns must be precise for the male

87

tail to remain in contact, as the hermaphrodite may be moving during this process, so strong

88

stimulation and flexure of the male diagonal muscles of the tail is necessary.

89

to maintain tail contact with the hermaphrodite is defined as a “successful turn” (Fig. 1A, Supp.

90

Video 1). When the male’s tail completely falls off the hermaphrodite, the turn is defined as

91

“missed” (Fig. 1B, Supp. Video 2). An intermediate “sloppy turn” occurs when the tail loses

92

contact briefly, but the male then reestablishes placement on the hermaphrodite (Fig. 1C, Supp.

93

The goa-1 gene is expressed in many tissues, including the male-specific diagonal muscles

As noted above, msi-1 is expressed in many neurons.

whether GOA-1 is needed within the muscles or neural tissues to mediate male turning, we

stably overexpressed genomic goa-1 driven by either the tph-1 promoter (expressing in the

181

Since serotonin is a key regulator of male turning behavior [25, 26], we tested whether

182

exc-7, msi-1, and goa-1 mutants were affected by exogenous serotonin. Mutants in these genes

183

were soaked in buffer containing 1mM serotonin for 1 hour, and tested for male turning ability.

For exc-7, msi-1, and goa-1, male turning defects were significantly rescued by exogenous

Two major classes of protein are often involved downstream of G proteins in signaling:

202

calcium channels and transcription factors [44]. Mutants in unc-2 (encoding a calcium channel

203

alpha subunit) and in crh-1 (encoding a homologue of the cyclic AMP-response element-binding

204

protein CREB) both affect serotonergic TPH-1 expression in other C. elegans neurons [45, 46].

205

Here, mutants in either gene showed male mating defects (Fig. 3A).

206

mutants (65% missed plus sloppy turns) were comparable to those in the tph-1 mutant, while

207

unc-2 mutants were significantly less impaired (37% missed plus sloppy turns).

208

turning in crh-1 mutants can be rescued by soaking the animals in 1mM serotonin (Fig. 3A) or

Discussion

294
295

The results of this study delineate a novel and likely conserved pathway by which

296

RNA-binding proteins mediate synthesis and signaling of the neurotransmitter serotonin. We

297

found that (-)-gossypol, inhibitor of human Musashi, also binds to C. elegans MSI-1 to inhibit its

298

binding to mRNA.

299

behavior; this binding could be interrupted by (-)-gossypol and cause defects in male turning.

300

Mutations in exc-7, encoding the homologue of human HuR RNA-binding protein, also exhibited

301

defects in male turning, as did homozygous mutations in the goa-1 gene, encoding the alpha

302

subunit of the Go heterotrimeric G-protein signal transduction complex.

303

goa-1, in contrast, rescued the turning defects in both homozygous msi-1 and homozygous exc-7

304

mutants.

In C. elegans, MSI-1 bound to goa-1 mRNA to mediate male turning

Stable expression of

305

Two other genes, crh-1 and tph-1, acted downstream of goa-1; both encode proteins that

306

regulate production of serotonin [43, 45, 46]. CRH-1 is the homologue of cyclic AMP-response

307

element-binding protein CREB, while TPH-1 tryptophan hydroxylase enzyme conducts the

rate-limiting step in serotonin synthesis [50].

309

310

neurons, and application of serotonin to affected animals rescued mutants in all of the genes

Mutations in these genes also caused male

315

(-)-gossypol at concentrations in the same range as for human cells in culture strongly affected

316

turning ability, we infer that the male ray openings are the most likely entry site for (-)-gossypol

317

to affect male turning, and that the ray neurons are the most likely site of action of the pathway

318

described above.

319

A model to summarize serotonin regulation at male tail rays is presented in Fig. 7G.

In

320

wild-type animals, MSI-1 binds to goa-1 mRNA to promote its translation. GOA-1 upregulates

324

the amount of goa-1 mRNA and concomitant decrease in serotonin synthesis.

EXC-7 is also involved in

The inhibitor (-)-gossypol passes through the ray

325

Male ray neurons synapse with the male-specific CP neurons [51]. The CP neurons are not

326

well-studied, but appear to innervate the diagonal muscles needed for male tail flexure.

327

Interestingly, while all of the genes studies were found to be expressed in Rays 1, 3, and 9, the

328

GOA-1 protein did not appear to be expressed in the CP neurons (although we could not exclude

329

the possibility that GOA-1 is found solely at synapses to ray neurons). This reinforces our

330

conclusion that the ray neurons are the site of (-)-gossypol action on serotonin synthesis.
All of the proteins in the pathway have been well conserved from nematodes to humans,

and several are involved in human diseases.

Mutations in GNAO1 have been linked to various human diseases, including breast

carcinoma [52], lung adenocarcinoma [53], as well as epileptic encephalopathy [54, 55], and

343

A pathway regulating serotonin synthesis from RNA-binding proteins to G-protein signaling

344

to serotonin synthesis appears to be conserved from nematodes to humans. (-)-Gossypol, which

345

inhibits the action of these RNA-binding proteins in humans exerts a similar effect on a

346

serotonergic pathway in humans. Unlike many drug effects on C. elegans, the impermeability
