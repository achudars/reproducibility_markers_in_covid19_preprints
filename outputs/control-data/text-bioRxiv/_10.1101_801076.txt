Abstract

2

Silencing of FMR1 and loss of its gene product FMRP results in Fragile X Syndrome. FMRP binds

3

brain mRNAs and inhibits polypeptide elongation. Using ribosome profiling of the hippocampus,

4

we find that ribosome footprint levels in Fmr1-deficient tissue mostly reflect changes in RNA

5

abundance. Profiling over a time course of ribosome runoff in wildtype tissue reveals a wide range

6

of ribosome translocation rates; on many mRNAs, the ribosomes are stalled. Sucrose gradient

7

ultracentrifugation of hippocampal slices after ribosome runoff reveals that FMRP co-sediments

8

with stalled ribosomes; and its loss results in decline of ribosome stalling on specific mRNAs. One

9

such mRNA encodes SETD2, a lysine methyltransferase that catalyzes H3K36me3. ChIP-Seq

10

demonstrates that loss of FMRP alters the deployment of this epigenetic mark on chromatin.

11

H3K36me3 is associated with alternative pre-RNA processing, which we find occurs in an FMRP-

12

dependent manner on transcripts linked to neural function and autism spectrum disorders.

Introduction

2
3

The Fragile Syndrome (FXS) is characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delays,

4

social impairment, hyper-anxiety, and other maladies. The root cause of FXS is an iteration of

5

~200 or more CGG triplets in FMR1 that induces DNA methylation and transcriptional inactivation.

6

Loss of the FMR1 gene product FMRP results in synaptic dysfunction and aberrant circuit

7

formation, which produces neuro-pathological conditions during development (Santoro et al

8

2012). FXS is modeled in Fmr1 knockout mice, which mimic many facets of the human disease

9

including learning and memory deficits, repetitive disorders, susceptibility to seizures, etc. In these

10

animals, neuronal communication is frequently examined at hippocampal Schaffer collateral-CA1

11

synapses, which exhibit exaggerated metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent long term

12

depression (mGluR-LTD) (Huber et al 2002). This form of synaptic plasticity normally requires

13

protein synthesis but in Fmr1-deficient animals, protein synthesis is both unnecessary for mGluR-

14

LTD and excessive in neurons, which contributes to aberrant circuit formation and other hallmarks

15

of the syndrome (Waung and Huber 2009).

16

FMRP is an RNA binding protein present in most cells; in neurons, its localization at

17

postsynaptic sites is thought to control activity-dependent synapse remodeling by regulating

18

mRNA expression (Richter et al 2015). Considerable effort has been made to identify FMRP

19

target mRNAs but the most rigorous involves in vivo crosslink and immunoprecipitation (CLIP).

20

CLIP combined with RNA-seq has identified 842 target mRNAs in the p11-p25 mouse cortex and

21

cerebellum (Darnell et al 2011), predominantly a single mRNA in cultured cortical neurons (Tabet

22

et al 2016), 1610 RNAs in the p13 cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum (Maurin et al 2018), and

23

~6000 RNAs in HEK cells ectopically expressing epitope-tagged FMRP (Ascano et al 2012). This

24

diversity of FMRP CLIP targets could reflect the different procedures employed or the different

25

brain cell types examined. Surprisingly, the majority of CLIP sites in mRNA are in coding regions

26

(Darnell et al 2011; Maurin et al 2018), with perhaps a bias to some cis sequences (Anderson et

al 2016; Maurin et al 2018). FMRP association with mRNA coding regions and co-sedimentation

2

with polyribosomes in sucrose gradients (Khandjian et al 1996; Feng et al 1997; Stefani et al

3

2004) suggests that it normally inhibits translation by impeding ribosome translocation. Indeed,

4

studies that examined polypeptide elongation directly (Udagawa et al 2013) or susceptibility to

5

puromycin release of nascent polypeptides (Darnell et al 2011) indicate that FMRP regulates

6

translation at the level of ribosome transit. Supporting evidence comes from studies showing that

7

Drosophila FMRP interacts with ribosomal protein L5 (rpL5) (Ishizuka et al 2002), which may

8

preclude tRNA or elongation factors from engaging the ribosome, thereby leading to a stalled

9

configuration (Chen et al 2014). Although these observations need to be extended to mammalian

10

FMRP, they suggest a molecular mechanism by which FMRP stalls ribosomes. However, such

11

observations do not indicate whether or how FMRP could stall ribosomes on specific mRNAs.

12

Ribosome profiling is a whole genome method for analyzing the number and positions of

13

ribosomes associated with mRNA; when combined with RNA-seq, it yields valuable and

14

heretofore unobtainable information on gene expression at high resolution (Ingolia et al 2009;

15

Ingolia 2014; Brar and Weismann 2015). We have used this method to explore FMRP regulation

16

of gene expression in mouse adult neural stems cells (aNSCs), which in FXS have an abnormal

17

proclivity to differentiate into glia at the expense of neurons (Luo et al 2010; Guo 2011). We

18

identified hundreds of mRNAs whose ribosome occupancy was up or down regulated in FMRP-

19

deficient cells, demonstrated that hundreds of other mRNAs had altered steady state levels and

20

whose ribosome association reflected these alterations, and discovered yet additional mRNAs

21

whose ribosome occupancy was “buffered” so that changes in their levels was compensated for

22

by opposite changes in ribosome association (Liu et al 2018).

23

Ribosome profiling at steady state cannot distinguish between translocating and stalled

24

ribosomes, suggesting that studies examining FMRP-regulated translation by this method or ribo-

25

TRAP (Thomson et al 2017; Liu et al 2018, 2019; Greenblatt and Spradling 2018; Das Sharma et

26

al 2019) may overlook key events leading to FXS. Moreover, if intact brain circuitry is important

1

for FMRP regulation, then culturing disaggregated neurons, for example, might not reveal

2

important aspects of FMRP function. To circumvent these issues, we have developed a

3

hippocampal slice assay to detect mRNA-specific ribosome translocation dynamics. Hippocampal

4

slices maintain the in vivo synaptic connectivity and cellular architecture, as well as express

5

protein synthesis and FMRP-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity (Huber et al., 2002). Profiling

6

over a time course of ribosome runoff in slices demonstrates a wide range of ribosome

7

translocation rates on specific mRNAs, ranging from rapid (rates similar to those in ES cells,

8

Ingolia et al 2011) to near complete stalling. A number of mRNAs retain 4-6 ribosomes after runoff

9

in WT, but not in FMRP-deficient slices. Some RNAs associated with FMRP-stalled ribosomes

10

encode proteins involved in neurologic function and transcriptional regulation. One such RNA

11

encodes an epigenetic regulator, SETD2, a methyltransferase for the chromatin mark H3K36me3.

12

We find an increase in SETD2 protein levels in Fmr1-deficient hippocampus. ChIP-seq

13

demonstrates that distribution of this mark varies in a genotype (i.e, WT vs. Fmr1-deficient)-

14

dependent manner in hippocampal tissue. In mammals, apart from blocking cryptic transcription

15

initiation and DNA damage response, H3K36me3 is correlated with pre-mRNA processing events

16

such as alternative splicing (Kim et al 2011; Kolasinska-Zwierz et al 2009). RNA sequencing

17

reveals that a number of splicing events such as exon skipping are altered in FMRP-deficient

18

slices, and that these transcripts are linked to neural function and autism spectrum disorders.

19

Aberrant RNA splicing of synapse related genes has in recent years been found to be widely

20

prevalent in autism spectrum disorders (Lee et al., 2016; Quesnel-Vallières et al., 2016; Smith

21

and Sadee, 2011). Our study demonstrates that a reduction in ribosome stalling in the Fmr1-

22

deficient brain results in a cascade of epigenetic and RNA processing changes that likely

23

contribute to neurologic disease.

Results

3

Hippocampal Schafer collateral-CA1 synapses exhibit an exaggerated mGluR-LTD in

4

Fmr1-deficient mice that is aberrantly protein synthesis-independent (Huber et al 2000). To

5

identify mRNAs whose basal level expression is misregulated, we prepared CA1-enriched

6

hippocampal slices (400µm thickness) (Figure 1A), performed ribosome profiling and RNA-seq

7

(Figure 1B) and calculated translational efficiency (TE), which is defined as the number of

8

ribosome footprints divided by the number of RNA-seq reads. We identified RNAs with changes

9

in TE (TE up /TE down) or RNAs whose levels were elevated or reduced but without

10

commensurate changes in TE (mRNA up/ mRNA down) (Figure 1C, Table S1) (nominal p-value<

11

0.01, false discovery rate = 0.097 by permutation test). A gene ontology (GO) functional analysis

12

of the biological processes most enriched in each regulatory group shows that the RNA down

13

group encodes factors that mediate taxis/chemotaxis, while the “mRNA up” group encodes factors

14

involved in ribonucleotide metabolism (Figure 1D, S1A,B). The “TE down” mRNAs encode factors

15

that control synaptic transmission (Figure 1D, S1C). The “mRNA down” group is enriched for

16

cellular components linked to the extracellular matrix while the “mRNA up” group encodes the

17

myelin sheath and spliceosomal-interacting factors. The “TE down” group is involved in the

18

extracellular matrix and structures involved in synaptic architecture (Figure 1E, S1C). No GO

19

terms from the TE up group were statistically significant.

20

Heat maps of the top 20 mRNAs with altered TEs both up and down in Fmr1-deficient

21

hippocampal slices compared to the wild type are shown in Figures 2A and B. Examples of the

22

change in TEs is depicted in Figure 2C. Gfpt2 (glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 2)

23

mRNA, is nearly unchanged in Fmr1 KO but has an increase in ribosome footprints Figure 2C).

24

Conversely Lhfpl5 (Lipoma HMGIC fusion partner-like 5) mRNA, has reduced numbers of

25

ribosome footprints while RNA levels are mostly unchanged (Figure 2D). Neither Gfpt2 nor Lhfpl5

26

mRNAs have FMRP CLIP sites. Figure 2E shows boxplots for all 843 FMRP CLIP RNAs (Darnell

et al 2011). As a group, these RNAs decrease significantly in Fmr1 KO, which is tracked by

2

commensurate decreases in ribosome footprints resulting in no change in TE.

3

We compared our “TE down” and “TE up” groups in Fmr1 KO hippocampus with results

4

from Das Sharma et al (2019), who performed ribosome profiling on mouse frontal cortex, and

5

Thomson et al (2017) who performed ribosome affinity purification (TRAP-seq) from hippocampal

6

CA1 pyramidal neurons (Figure 2F). Only 37 of our TE down RNAs were similarly detected by

7

Das Sharma et al (2017) and only 5 by Thomson et al (2017). Even fewer of our TE up RNAs

8

were detected in either of those studies (Figure 2F). We surmise that the differences in methods

9

and source material are likely responsible for little overlap among the studies.

10

Our data show almost all changes in ribosome footprint number in Fmr1-deficient

11

hippocampal-cortical slices can be attributed to altered RNA levels irrespective of whether the

12

transcripts are FMRP CLIP targets. This suggests that the increase in incorporation of labeled

13

amino acids into protein in Fmr1 KO hippocampal slices (e.g., Dolen et al 2007; Udagawa et al

14

2103; Bowling et al 2019) is mostly due to changes in RNA levels and/or ribosomal transit rate

15

(see below). However, TE may not necessarily reflect protein production. For example, increased

16

initiation with no change in elongation would result in an increased density of ribosome footprints

17

and yield an elevated level of protein product (Figure 2G). If there is no change in initiation but

18

elevated elongation, the TE will appear to be reduced but the production of protein will be

19

increased. Consequently, ribosome profiling at steady state, which cannot distinguish between

20

transiting and stalled ribosomes, may inadequately represent translation if there are changes in

21

elongation. To assess whether FMRP regulates ribosome dynamics, we modified our procedure

22

to investigate temporal changes in genome-wide ribosome translocation rates.

Ribosome run off dynamics in hippocampal-cortical slices

We next performed ribosomal profiling and RNA-seq in hippocampal-cortical slices at

26

different time points after blocking initiation with homoharringtonine (HHT). HHT halts ribosomes

on initiation codons but allows elongating ribosomes to continue translocating until they run off

2

the mRNA (Ingolia et al 2012; Lee et al 2012). Using this assay, we aimed to determine

3

differences in ribosome translocation rates of all expressed genes in wild type tissue slices. Slices

4

were incubated with HHT for 0-60 min and ribosome transit stopped at specific times with

5

cycloheximide; the samples were then used for ribosome profiling (Figure 3A, Table S1). A

6

metagene analysis of the ribosome footprints on 1401 mRNAs with open reading frames of >3000

7

nt aligned with the start and stop codons is shown in Figure 3B. The read densities at each

8

position were normalized to the average densities of the last 500 nucleotides of the CDS and is

9

based on the P site of the ribosome footprints. Using these data, a linear regression analysis

10

between the HHT treatment time and ribosome runoff distances was used to estimate the global

11

elongation rate of 4.2 nt/sec at 30oC (Figure 3C). By comparison, the global elongation rate in

12

cultured ES calls is 1.7 nt/sec at 37oC (Ingolia et al 2011).

13

We next performed a cluster analysis of all the RNAs with respect to number of ribosome

14

protected fragments at each time point (5, 10, 30, 60 min) relative to time 0. Briefly, euclidean

15

distance was first computed, followed by hierarchical clustering using Ward’s algorithm (Ward,

16

1963), and the Analysis of group similarities (ANOSIM) test (Clarke, 1993) was then used to

17

assess whether distances between clusters were statistically greater than within clusters (Figure

18

3D). The RNAs fell into two broad clusters (ANOSIM R=0.56, p-value<0.001): those whose

19

ribosome runoff occurred relatively quickly (i.e., within 5-10 min, bottom cluster), and those whose

20

runoff occurred slowly, if at all (top cluster). These two clusters were then further grouped into 3

21

sub-clusters each for 6 total sub-clusters (ANOSIM R=0.64, p-value<0.001). Sub-clusters 1-3 had

22

slow runoff times while sub-clusters 4-6 had relatively fast ribosome runoff times (Figure 3D and

23

3E). The ribosomes on RNAs in sub-cluster 2 had the slowest runoff time. We next determined

24

the ribosome runoff patterns for the RNAs in each sub-cluster (Figure 3E). For example, RNAs

25

for Alcam (activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule), Arc (activity-regulated cytoskeleton), and

26

Nptn (neuroplastin) are present in the sub-cluster 1, Col11 (collectin subfamily 11) in sub-cluster

2, Nrxn3 (neurexin 3) in sub-cluster 3 and actin in sub-cluster 4 (Figure 3F). As examples, Figure

2

3G shows the ribosome footprints of Nrxn3 and actin over time; Figure S2A shows ribosome

3

footprints for additional RNAs. Although there was some CDS length dependency of the ribosome

4

runoff rates, the correlation was not linear (Figure S2B). GO term analysis showed that specific

5

biological activities were remarkably associated with each sub-cluster. Genes in sub-clusters 1

6

and 3 were closely associated with neural function such as axon development and synapse

7

organization (Figure 3H). Sub-cluster 2, which contained ribosomes with the slowest runoff rates,

8

had genes encoding the extracellular matrix, sub-cluster 4 contained genes involved in metabolic

9

functions, sub-cluster 5 was associated with RNA processing and regulation, and sub-cluster 6

10

with organelle localization, among other functions (Figure S2C). These results suggest that

11

clusters of mRNAs with specific functions have differential ribosomal transit rates.

12
13

FMRP controls ribosome translocation on specific mRNAs

14

To investigate whether FMRP controls ribosome stalling on specific mRNAs, we first

15

determined whether it is present in ribosome-containing complexes or “granules” as suggested

16

by earlier studies (Feng et al 1998; Khandjian et al 2004; Stefani et al 2004; El Fatimy et al 2016).

17

Extracts from cortices were treated with nonionic (NP40) or ionic (DOC) detergents, or RNase

18

and sedimented through sucrose gradients. Figure S3A shows FMRP sedimented to a “heavy”

19

ribosome-containing region of the gradient even in the presence of NP40 or RNase; DOC

20

treatment, however, stripped FMRP from ribosome-containing complexes as shown previously

21

(Stefani et al 2004; Darnell et al 2011). These data suggest that FMRP is associated with

22

ribosomes in heavy granule structures and thus could play a role in ribosome stalling.

23

We next performed sucrose gradient analysis of hippocampal slices treated with HHT for

24

30 min (Figure 4), which allows ribosomes on most genes to run off (as shown in Figure 3). Figure

25

4A shows that most FMRP co-sediments with polysomes as has been shown previously (e.g.,

26

Feng et al 1998; Stefani et al 2004), but after HHT treatment, it is more prevalent in “medium”

1

gradient fractions that correspond to 4-6 ribosomes. Other proteins (e.g., UPF1, MAP2, eEF2) do

2

not show a similar change in sedimentation (Figure S3B). A small amount of FMRP remains in a

3

“heavy” (>7 ribosomes) region of the gradient (Figure 4B). The same experiments were performed

4

with Fmr1 KO slices (Figure 4C, D). RNA-seq of the “heavy” fractions showed that 1574 RNAs

5

and 686 RNAs were reduced or elevated, respectively, in both genotypes, indicating that heavy

6

granules contain mRNAs that are sensitive or resistant to HHT treatment (Figure 4E). Actin is one

7

such RNA that was sensitive to HHT that was depleted by ribosome runoff (Figure 4F), which is

8

consistent with results from the HHT time course (Figure 3F, G). Map1b RNA, on the other hand,

9

was enriched in the heavy polysomes by HHT treatment (Figure 4G). Figure 4H shows GO terms

10

for the RNAs depleted in the heavy fractions after runoff, which include RNA processing and other

11

factors involved in RNA metabolism. Figure 4I shows the GO terms for RNAs enriched in the

12

heavy polysomes after HHT treatment, which include factors involved in membrane and ion

13

transport.

14

In contrast to the “heavy” polysome fractions, we found genotype-specific differences in

15

the RNA-seq of the “medium” polysome fractions (Table S1). Forty-six RNAs were down-

16

regulated in HHT-treated Fmr1 KO slices relative to WT, indicating that they are normally bound

17

by FMRP-stalled ribosomes (Figure 5A). Eight of these mRNAs encode epigenetic and

18

transcriptional regulators and 23 encode proteins specifically involved in neural function (Figure

19

5B). One example is Ankrd12 (ankyrin repeat domain containing 12), which is depleted in the KO

20

slices following HHT treatment (Figure 5C). Figure 5C shows that after HHT treatment, Ankrd12

21

RNA contains fewer stalled ribosomes in the medium fractions of Fmr1 KO slices, confirming this

22

mRNA is under FMRP regulation. Figure 5D demonstrates that compared to all RNAs, the HHT-

23

sensitive RNAs (Figure 5B) showed significant decreases in RPFs and TEs but not RNA levels in

24

Fmr1 KO relative to WT (ribosome profiling data of these RNAs from Figure 2) showing the

25

consistency between steady state ribosome profiling and the dynamic ribosome run-off assay.

Finally, Figure 5E demonstrates that one of the mRNAs decreased in the “medium”

2

fraction in the Fmr1 KO slices, SETD2, shows an increase in its protein levels in Fmr1 KO

3

hippocampus relative to WT, which is expected if FMRP stalls ribosome translocation on this

4

RNA. SETD2 is the sole histone lysine methyltransferase that trimethylates the histone H3 tail on

5

the lysine36(K36) residue.

FMRP mediated regulation of H3K36me3

8

To investigate whether altered SETD2 levels influence gene-specific changes in

9

H3K36me3, we performed ChIP-seq from WT and Fmr1 KO hippocampus in duplicate, combining

10

hippocampal tissue from 2 animals per biologic replicate (Figure 6A). All genotypic replicates were

11

highly correlated with each other (Figure S4A). H3K36me3 is a broad histone mark that is

12

enriched primarily in the body of the gene. To measure regions with enrichment of the mark we

13

used the SICER v1.1 package (Xu et al., 2014) that annotates ChIP signal over a stretch of DNA

14

as ‘islands’ (an island is defined as a cluster of non-overlapping consecutive DNA regions (200

15

bp windows) separated by at least a 600bp gap region of DNA with no ChIP-enriched signal

16

detected above threshold). Annotation of the H3K36me3 islands shows that they were primarily

17

present within the gene body compared to promoter proximal regions, as expected (Krogan et al

18

2003; Tiedemann et al 2016) (Figure 6B,I). Metagene analysis showed there to be no genotype-

19

specific difference in the distribution of marks overall along the gene body and no effect of gene

20

length (Figure S4B, C, D). Next, we compared the number of genes with H3K36me3 islands

21

detected between both genotypes, and found more H3K36me3 harbouring genes in the Fmr1 KO

22

than those in the WT (Figure 6B, II; note that there may be multiple islands in a single gene). We

23

further compared the differential enrichment of the H3K36me3 islands between the genotypes

24

using SICER-df script from the SICER v1.1 package (Xu et al., 2014). We found 3008 islands with

25

decreased and 2472 islands with increased H3K36me3 in the Fmr1 KO compared to wild type

26

hippocampus ChIP-seq (p-value < 0.0001, FDR <0.0001) (Table S2). Examples of the changes

of these marks that are genotype-dependent is shown in Figure 6C where H3K36me3 on Reep4

2

(receptor expression-enhancing protein 4) is reduced but elevated on Tprkb (TP53-related protein

3

kiase binding protein). The decreased islands were mostly found in intragenic regions whereas

4

the increased islands were present in higher proportion in the intergenic regions (Figure 6D)

5

demonstrating a redistribution of H3K36me3 in FXS model mice. Many of the islands, especially

6

those that decrease in Fmr1 KO animals are found on genes linked to autism spectrum disorders

7

as defined by SFARI (Figure 6E). A subset of genes (219) showed both increased and decreased

8

islands along the length of the gene body (Figure 6E). GO term enrichment analysis of the genes

9

that have either increased or decreased H3K36me3 islands is shown in Figure 6F. Although the

10

genes that have decreased islands are quite diverse, those with increased islands are remarkably

11

enriched for genes involved in neural function such as synapse assembly and animal behavior.

12

The methylated islands also undergo genotype-specific length changes; they are significantly

13

longer in the WT compared to Fmr1 KO (p-value <0.001, Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test) (Figure

14

S4E). Our data thus show that an increase in the levels of SETD2 in the Fmr1 KO results in

15

dysregulated H3K36me3 chromatin marks.

FMRP regulates alternative RNA processing

18

H3K36me3 in mammals has been correlated with alternative pre-mRNA splicing (Kim et

19

al 2011). We analyzed our RNA-seq data from WT and Fmr1 KO hippocampal slices using rMATS

20

alternative splicing package (Shen et al., 2014) and detected many alternative pre-mRNA

21

processing events including skipped exon (SE), mutually excluded exon (MXE), alternative 5’ and

22

3 splice site (A5SS and A3SS), as well as retained intron (RI) (Figure 7A, Table S3, FDR < 5%

23

and p-value<0.05). The number of exon inclusion events are shown (Differences in exon inclusion

24

levels is calculated as Percent Spliced In (PSI) and a cutoff of |deltaPSI| ≥ 5% is used). Several

25

of the exon skipping events were validated by RT-qPCR, with ~20-40% reduction in exon skipping

26

in the Fmr1 KO relative to WT (Figure 7B). These skipped exons have previously been found to

be associated with defects in brain development and disease pathology (An and Grabowski, 2007;

2

Fugier et al., 2011; Rockenstein et al., 1995; Wang et al., 2018). Figure 7C shows all the RNA

3

processing events that undergo changes in Fmr1-deficient hippocampus relative to WT (p-

4

value<0.05, |deltaPSI| ≥ 5%). Skipped exons are by far the most prevalent category, followed by

5

alternative 3’ splice sites; retained introns are the most infrequent. The genes whose RNA

6

processing events are altered in Fmr1 KO are strongly linked to neural function such as vesicle

7

transport to synapses, vesicle recycling, etc. (Figure 7D). Moreover, many of the alternatively

8

spliced (Alt. Spl. or AS) genes in Fmr1 KO hippocampus (Alt. Spl. Fmr1 KO) are linked to autism

9

(i.e., SFARI autism spectrum disorder database, ASD) (Figure 7E). In addition, the AS genes in

10

Fmr1 KO significantly overlap with genes previously found to be alternatively spliced in patients

11

with autism (Alt. Spl. ASD) (Parikshak et al., 2016) (Figure 7E). We also find an overlap of genes

12

with changes in H3K36me3 islands with those found to harbor aberrant splicing in Fmr1 KO tissue

13

(Figure 7E). We next assessed the H3K36me3 levels at the skipped exons in the SE category

14

and found a trend towards a decrease in the H3K36me3 marks at the 5’ splice site of these exons

15

that are skipped in the Fmr1 KO hippocampus compared to the wild type (Figure 7F, p-

16

value<0.07). Thus, as with other autism spectrum disorders, dysregulated alternative splicing is

17

prevalent in a mouse model of FXS and might be linked to changes in H3K36me3.

Discussion

2
3

We used several approaches to investigate FMRP regulation of mRNA expression in the

4

mouse brain, focusing first on steady state ribosome profiling in hippocampal slices. Fmr1

5

deficiency resulted in ribosome footprint levels that mostly tracked altered levels of RNA, which

6

is consistent with other studies (Liu et al 2018; 2019; Das Sharma et al 2019). Because ribosome

7

profiling at steady state cannot distinguish between static and translocating ribosomes, we

8

modified our profiling procedure (Ingolia et al 2011) to identify the dynamic range of ribosome

9

translocation rates genome-wide in hippocampal slices. These studies in turn resulted in four

10

main novel findings. First, they showed that mRNAs cluster into defined functional biology groups

11

based on the transit rates of their associated ribosomes. The ribosomes on most (>5000

12

detectable mRNAs) transit relatively rapidly, whereas on other RNAs (~3000), ribosome transit is

13

slow or nearly not at all (~350). There is some CDS length dependency as well. Second, using a

14

combination of ribosome runoff and sucrose gradient centrifugation, we identified ~50 mRNAs

15

associated with FMRP-stalled ribosomes, which strongly imply translational regulation. One of

16

these mRNAs encodes a histone lysine methyltransferase, SETD2, which is elevated in Fmr1 KO

17

hippocampus. Third, the SETD2-dependent histone mark, H3K36me3, is rearranged in both

18

intragenic and intergenic regions upon Fmr1 deficiency. Fourth, because H3K36me3 has been

19

correlated with alternative RNA processing in mammals (Kim et al 2011), we analyzed our RNA-

20

seq data and found widespread aberrant splicing in the Fmr1 KO hippocampus, most prominently

21

exon skipping/inclusion. These altered processing events often correlated with changes in the

22

histone mark, occurred on genes that regulate pre-synaptic functions such as synaptic vesicle

23

recycling, and were strongly linked to autism spectrum disorders (Figure 7E).

24

Earlier studies have inferred that ribosome stalling in the brain is linked to RNA transport

25

granules in dendrites (Krichevsky and Kosik 2001; Mallardo et al 2003; Kanai et al 2004;

26

Khandjian et al 2004). It is possible that at least some of the ribosome stalling we observe may

1

be the result from such compartmentalization in neurons, or perhaps is a more general feature of

2

the brain. In contrast, rapidly dividing ES cells do not appear to have stalled ribosomes, at least

3

not of the magnitude we observe here (Ingolia et al 2011). Irrespective of whether ribosome

4

stalling is a dendritic or neuronal phenomenon, how it occurs mechanistically on specific mRNAs

5

is unclear, but it could be related to secondary structure or association with RNA binding or other

6

proteins. One clue, however, could be the accumulating evidence that strongly implicates

7

phosphorylation of eEF2 as a coordinator of translation and neural activity, and thus is likely to be

8

one mediator of ribosome translocation rates (Scheetz et al 2000; Sutton et al 2007; Park et al

9

2008; McCamphill et al 2015; Heise et al 2017). Even so, the involvement of phospho-eEF2, a

10

general translation factor, would unlikely be responsible for mRNA-specific stalling. We also noted

11

that some mRNAs, such as those in sub-cluster 2 (Figure 3D, E) encode proteins involved in the

12

extracellular matrix (Figure S2C). A number of these proteins contain proline-rich stretches,

13

whose geometry in the polypeptide exit tunnel can lead to ribosome stalling (Schuller et al 2017;

14

Hutter et al 2017).

15

We have identified ~50 mRNA whose ribosomes are stalled specifically by FMRP. These

16

RNAs include those with and without FMRP CLIP sites in coding regions, so it would appear that

17

a simple FMRP “roadblock” model would not explain ribosome stalling. Alternatively, Ishizuka et

18

al (2002) showed that Drosophila FMRP binds ribosomal proteins, and in a cryo-EM study, Chen

19

et al (2014) found that Drosophila FMRP reconstituted with mammalian ribosomes binds a region

20

that would preclude tRNA and elongation factors from engaging in translation. However attractive

21

this model is for FMRP-mediated ribosome stalling, the fact that mRNA or translation factors were

22

not included in the reconstitution assays brings into question whether it reflects the physiological

23

basis for ribosome stalling.

24

Our studies revealed that FMRP stalls ribosomes on a number of mRNAs that encode

25

epigenetic regulators and that the mis-regulation of one of them in Fmr1-deficient hippocampus,

26

SETD2, leads to widespread changes in H3K36me3 chromatin marks (islands). These

1

H3K36me3 islands are both enriched for and depleted from autism risk genes (Figure 6E) as well

2

as those with synaptic functions (Figure 6F). This suggests that SETD2, the only enzyme that

3

catalyzes this chromatin mark, might also be an autism risk gene, which has been previously

4

reported (Lumish et al 2015). Mutations in several chromatin remodeling genes have been linked

5

to changes in neural function, autism, and other intellectual disabilities (van Bokhoven 2011;

6

Goodman and Bonni 2019). In most cases, however, mutations in epigenetic modifiers result in

7

up or down regulation of transcription. Indeed, previously identified epigenetic changes in FXS

8

model mice by Korb et al (2017), particularly H3K4me3, H4K8ac, and H4K16ac, were responsible

9

for widespread changes in transcription in cortical neurons and the cerebellum. Importantly, these

10

investigators could rescue several FXS pathophysiologies, many of which resemble those in

11

autism, by targeting the epigenetic reader protein Brd4. H3K36me3 does not mark promoter

12

regions, but instead is found in gene bodies and increases as RNA polymerase II proceeds 3’

13

during catalysis (Neri et al 2017). In mammals, one of the functions H3K36me3 is correlated with,

14

if not causative for, alternative pre-mRNA processing (Kim et al 2011). In the Fmr1-deficient

15

hippocampus, we detected extensive changes in RNA processing, mostly exon skipping.

16

Surprisingly, most of the skipped exons occurred in genes that have pre-synaptic functions such

17

as synaptic vesicle recycling, transport, exocytosis, etc., which could at least partially explain

18

alterations in synaptic vesicle dynamics and neurotransmitter release in FXS model mice (Deng

19

et al 2013; Ferron et al 2014; Broek et al 2016). Furthermore, a number of skipped exons in Fmr1

20

KO have been linked to neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (skipped exon 7 in

21

APP (Fragkouli et al., 2017; Rockenstein et al., 1995)), Parkinson’s disease (skipped exon 3 in

22

Mapt (Lai et al., 2017)), and intellectual disabilities (skipped exon12 in Cnksr2 (Houge et al.,

23

2012)).

24

Alternative pre-mRNA processing is a common feature in autism (Quesnel-Vallieres et al

25

2019), so it is perhaps not surprising that this would occur in Fragile X. However, because FMRP

26

is an RNA binding protein that regulates translation, a reasonable assumption would be that

1

mRNAs encoding splicing factors are improperly expressed in the disorder, and that this leads

2

directly to misplicing events. However, our data indicate that this relationship might not be linear.

3

Instead, we find that FMRP controls ribosome dynamics on specific mRNAs, which leads to

4

elevated translation (e.g., SETD2), which leads to chromatin modifications (e.g., H3K36me3),

5

which in turn might lead to alternative splicing of neuronal mRNAs (Figure 7G). These

6

observations do not preclude the possible, if not likely, direct involvement of FMRP in some of

7

these events. Even so, inferences that Fragile X is a disorder of improper translation, while not

8

incorrect, is vastly oversimplified. However, the complexity of gene expression changes in Fragile

9

X might offer opportunities for therapeutic intervention at multiple steps.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

2

Mouse acute brain slice preparation

3

Mouse protocols were reviewed and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee

4

(IACUC) and all colonies were maintained following animal research guidelines. Transverse

5

hippocampal or hippocampal-cortical brain slices were acutely prepared from P28-35 C57BL/6N

6

wild-type or Fmr1 KO male mice littermates as previously described (Guo et al., 2016). Briefly,

7

mice were anesthetized with ketamine (125 mg/kg)/xylazine (25 mg/kg) and transcardially

8

perfused with chilled (4°C) sucrose dissection buffer containing the following (in mM): 2.6 KCl,

9

1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 0.5 CaCl2, 5 MgCl2, 212 mM sucrose, and 10 dextrose aerated with

10

95% O2/5% CO2. Transverse hippocampal slices (400µm) were obtained on a Leica VT1200S

11

slicer. For ribosomal profiling experiments (Figure 1), CA3 was cut off to enrich for CA1 and for

12

each biological replicate, 8-10 slices from 6-8 mice/genotype were pooled. Slices were recovered

13

and maintained at 30°C for 3-4 hours in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) which contained the

14

following (in mM): 119 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 26 NaHCO3, 1 NaH2PO4 and 11 D-glucose

15

aerated with 95%/O2/5% CO2 to pH 7.4. Slices were then treated with cycloheximide (100 µg/ml)

16

in ACSF, 4°C, snap-frozen on dry ice/EtOH bath, and stored at -80°C. For homoharringtonine

17

(HHT) experiments (Figures 3-5), cortical-hippocampal slices were recovered 3-4 hours in ACSF

18

and then treated with HHT (20 µM) (Tocris) or 0.05% DMSO (vehicle) for different times (0, 5, 10,

19

30, 60 min). At the end of the incubation time, slices were snap/frozen on dry ice/EtOH bath and

20

stored at -80 C. Ten slices from 2-3 mice/genotype were pooled for each biological replicate.

were measured by Nanodrop (A260 units). For each sample, cytoplasmic RNA for RNA-seq was

8

purified from one-fourth of the lysate with TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen, #10296028). The other

9

three-fourths of the lysate was digested with 100ng RNase A (Sigma, # R4875) and 60U RNase

10

ice and adding 50U SUPERase In RNase inhibitor (Ambion, #AM2694). Digested lysates were

12

applied to 10%-50% (w/v) sucrose gradients prepared in 1X polysome buffer (20mM Tris-HCl

pH7.4, 5mM MgCl2, 100mM KCl, 1mM DTT, 100μg/ml CHX in nuclease-free water). After the

ultracentrifugation in a SW41Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter) at 35,000 rpm (avg 151,263g) 4°C for

15

2.5 hours, gradients were fractionated at 1.5 ml/min and 12 sec collection intervals through a

Briefly, rRNA was depleted from the purified monosomal RNA with RiboZero (Illumina,

2

pH5.5, 1mM EDTA, 0.25% SDS) at room temperature overnight, filtered with Spin-X Centrifuge

3

Tube Filters (Corning, #8162) and precipitated with equal volume of isopropanol. Recovered RNA

was dephosphorylated with T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (NEB, #M0201S) and ligated with

5

preadenylated adaptor in miRCat®-33 Conversion Oligos Pack (IDT) using T4RNL2Tr.K227Q

6

ligase (NEB, #M0351L). Reverse transcription (RT) was performed with primers containing 5nt-

barcodes and 8nt-unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and SuperScript III (Invitrogen, #18080-

8

044) in 1X first-strand buffer without MgCl2 (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mM KCl). RT products

9

were separated on a 10% TBU gel and the 130-140nt region was selected. cDNA was eluted in

10

DNA elution buffer (10mM Tris pH 8.0, 300mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA) at room temperature overnight,

11

filtered, and precipitated with isopropanol. Purified cDNA was circularized with CircLigase

12

(Epicentre, #CL4115K). Except for the RNase titration samples, cDNA derived from remaining

13

rRNA was hybridized to biotin-labelled antisense probes (IDT) and further depleted with

14

Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 (Invitrogen, #65001). Optimal PCR cycle number was

determined empirically by test PCR reactions with titrated cycle numbers. Final PCR amplification

16

was performed with KAPA Library Amplification Kit (Kapa Biosystems, #KK2611) and 180-190bp

In parallel, input RNA samples were processed similarly as the ribosome footprints except

Based on the FMRP signals in the immunoblotting of gradient fractions, medium and heavy

12

fractions were identified, pooled, and extracted with TRIzol LS together with saved input lysates.

13

RNA samples were quantified with Qubit HS RNA assay kit and the integrity was examined with

Fragment Analyzer. 200ng RNA was used for BIOO Rapid directional qRNA-seq library

15

preparation following the manufacturer’s instructions. 12 cycles were used for the final PCR

16

amplification. The libraries were quantified with KAPA Library Quantification Kit and the quality

17

was examined with Fragment Analyzer. Libraries were pooled with equal molar ratios, denatured,

the mapping steps. Trimmed reads were quality filtered with Trimmomatic (0.32) and mapped to

2

the mouse rRNA and then tRNA references with Bowtie2 (2.1.0). Unmapped reads were next

3

mapped to the mm10 mouse genome with Tophat2 (2.0.9). Reads mapped to >1 loci of the

4

genome were classified as “multimapped” reads and discarded. PCR duplicates were marked

5

based on the UMI sequences with custom scripts and only uniquely mapped reads without

6

duplicates were retained with Samtools (0.0.19) for the downstream analyses. RPF length

7

distribution, P-site offsets, and frame preference were calculated with plastid (0.4.8). Counts at

8

each nucleotide position were extracted using P-sites of RPFs and 5’end of mRNA reads with

9

+11 offset, normalized to the library size, averaged across replicates, and plotted along mRNA

10

positions with custom scripts.

Steady-state differential translation analysis

13

Cleaned bam files were converted to fastq files with bedtools. For both ribosome profiling and

14

RNA-seq, gene expression was quantified with RSEM (1.2.11) using the cleaned fastq files and

15

Refseq (V69) mouse CDS without the first and last 30nt to avoid the translation initiation and

16

termination peaks. Genes were filtered with minimum 10 reads across all replicates and then the

17

read counts were batch-corrected with the Combat function in sva (3.24.4) using a full model

18

matrix. Batch-corrected counts were normalized with trimmed mean of M values (TMM) method

19

and used to identify differential expressed genes (DEGs) with anota2seq (1.0.0). Instead of the

20

default setting, the priority of TE groups were set to be higher than that of mRNA only groups. A

21

permutation test was performed to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR) with nominal p-value

22

< 0.01, which was 0.097. GO analysis was performed and plotted with clusterProfiler (3.10.1)

23

using all genes past filtering in the dataset as the background.

To categorize and group genes with distinct ribosome run-off patterns, the RPF of each gene at

2

each time point was first normalized to time point 0. The Euclidean distance matrix was then

3

calculated, followed by hierarchical clustering using Ward’s agglomeration method (Ward, 1963).

4

The clustering process was performed using the hclust (Galili, 2015), and the clustering heatmap

5

was displayed using pheatmap (Kolde and Kolde, 2015) in R. To test the reliability of clustering,

6

analysis of group similarities (ANOSIM) test (Clarke, 1993) was performed using vegan (Dixon,

7

2003) in R with 1000 permutation times on both overall clusters and sub-clusters. The global

8

pattern of each cluster was summarized using the corresponding median and standard deviation

9

in each timepoint.

10

GO enrichment analysis for each sub-cluster were performed through clusterProfiler (Yu

11

et al., 2012) using genes covered by run-off ribosome profiling as background. The statistical

12

significance was adjusted using FDR. To remove redundancy in reporting, each reported GO term

13

was required to have at least 25% of genes that were not associated to another term with a more

14

significant p value.

15

Western blotting

16

Hippocampi were homogenized at 4°C in RIPA buffer. Protein complexes were released by

17

sonication at 4°C and the extract was centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for 10 min at 4°C and the

18

supernatant collected. Protein concentration was determined by BCA reagent. Proteins (10 μg)

19

were diluted in SDS-bromophenol blue reducing buffer with 40 mM DTT and analyzed using

20

western blotting with the following antibodies: SETD2 (ABclonal, A11271) and Lamin AC (Thermo

21

Fisher, 14-9688-80). After incubation in primary antibody, immunoblots were incubated with HRP-

22

conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch) and developed by Clarity ECL

23

substrate (Biorad). For sucrose gradient fractions, 60µl samples were mixed with 20µl 4X SDS

24

loading dye (240mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 5% beta-mercaptoethanol, 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, 0.04%

25

Chromatin immunoprecipitation Sequencing (ChIP-Seq)

12

ChIP was performed as previously described (Cotney and Noonan, 2015). Briefly,

13

hippocampal tissue was isolated from 4 adult mice (P35) per genotype and minced into tissue <

14

0.5mm3 in 250ul of ice-cold PBS with protease inhibitors. Tissue was cross-linked with 1%

15

formaldehyde and rotated at room temperature for 15 min at 50 rpm and quenched with 150mm

16

glycine for 10 min in a total volume of 1ml PBS. The supernatant was discarded after

17

centrifugation at 2000g for 10 min at 40C and the pellet was resuspended in 300ul of chilled cell

18

lysis buffer for 20 min on ice. Swollen pellets were homogenized using a glass Dounce

19

homogenizer (2ml) with 40 strokes of a tight pestle on ice. Nuclei were harvested after

20

centrifugation at 2000g for 5min at 40C and resuspended in 300ul ice-cold nuclear lysis buffer for

21

20min on ice. SDS was added to make a final concentration of 0.5%. Samples were sonicated on

22

a Bioruptor® sonicator at high power settings for 9 cycles (sonication: 30 sec on, 90 sec off) of

23

15min each at 4°C at high power. Supernatants were collected after centrifugation at 16,000g for

24

10 min at 40C. The samples were diluted to bring the SDS concentration <0.1%; 10% of each

25

sample was reserved as input. The rest of the samples were divided into two and incubated with

Protein G dynabeads coupled overnight at 40C with either H3K36me3 (Abcam ab9050, 5μg per

2

ChIP) or IgG (Sigma 12-371, 5 μg per ChIP). After IP, beads were washed, and chromatin eluted

3

in elution buffer for 20 min shaking at 65°C. IP and Input samples were de-crosslinked overnight

4

at 65°C. RNAse digestion for 1 hr. at 37°C and proteinase K treatment for 30 min at 55°C was

5

performed. DNA was then purified with the QIAGEN PCR purification kit in 50ul elution buffer. For

6

library preparation, purified input and IP DNA was end repaired using T4 DNA polymerase,

7

Klenow polymerase and T4 Polynucleotide kinase from NEB at 20°C for 30 min. DNA was

8

extracted using 35ul of the Agencourt Ampure XP beads and ‘A’ bases were added to the 3’ end

9

using Klenow exonuclease (3’ to 5’ exo minus) from NEB for 30min at 37°C. DNA was purified

10

using 60ul of the Agencourt Ampure XP beads and Illumina adapter sequences were ligated to

11

the DNA fragments using the Quick Ligase (NEB) for 15min at 20°C. The library was size-selected

12

using 50ul of Agencourt Ampure XP beads. Using the multiplexing barcoded primers, the library

13

was PCR amplified and purified using 50ul of the Agencourt Ampure XP beads and analyzed

14

using a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical, performed by Molecular Biology Core Labs at

15

UMMS). Libraries were pooled with equal molar ratios, denatured, diluted, and sequenced with

ChIP-Seq analysis

20

For ChIP-sequencing analysis, alignments were performed with Bowtie2 (2.1.0) using the mm10

21

genome, duplicates were removed with Picard and TDF files for IGV viewing were generated

22

using a ChIP-seq pipeline from DolphinNext (Yukselen et al., 2019). The broad peaks for

23

H3K36me3 ChIP-Seq were called using the SICER v1.1 package (Xu et al., 2014). H3K36me3

24

enriched islands were identified using the parameters set to a window size of 200bp, gap size

25

600bp and FDR cutoff of 1 × 10-3, and the default value for the redundant rate cutoff. Significantly

1

enriched islands for each genotype were identified using the sicer-df.sh script with an FDR cutoff

2

of 1 × 10-3. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed using the clusterProfiler

3

package (Yu et al., 2012) to obtain GO terms related to Biological processes in the genes with

4

differentially enriched islands in the Fmr1 KO vs Wild type. deepTools was used to plot heatmaps

5

and profiles for genic distribution of H3K36me3 ChIP signal. Samtools (0.1.19) was used for

6

sorting and converting Bam files. RPGC (per bin) = number of reads per bin / scaling factor for 1x

7

average coverage was used for normalization where the scaling factor was determined using

8

sequencing depth: (total number of mapped reads x fragment length) / effective genome size.

9

IGV tools (2.3.67) was used for visualizing TDF files and all tracks shown are normalized for total

10

read coverage. To quantify the H3K36me3 level for each gene, we calculated ChIP reads density

11

in TSS regions divided by the corresponding value in the gene body. To quantify the H3K36me3

12

level at the 5’ and 3’ splicing sites of the SE, the read density of ±50bp at each splice site was

13

normalized to the read density in the entire gene body, which controls for any fluctuations in total

14

H3K36me3 at the respective genes between both genotypes.

16

Alternative splicing analysis

17

RNA-seq from hippocampal slices was used to analyze alternative splicing (AS) using the rMATS

18

package v3.2.5 (Shen et al., 2014) with default parameters and reads were trimmed to 50bp. The

19

Percent Spliced In (PSI) levels or the exon inclusion levels calculated by rMATS using a

20

hierarchical framework. To calculate the difference in PSI between genotypes a likelihood-ratio

21

test was used. AS events with an FDR < 5% and |deltaPSI| ≥ 5% as identified using rMATS were

22

used for further analysis. We included genes that had at least one read at the differential splice

23

junction for both genotypes. GO enrichment analysis was done by the clusterProfiler package (Yu

24

et al., 2012) to obtain GO term enrichment for the AS events. The genes with significant skipped

25

exons were used for validation using RT-qPCR analysis. One ug of RNA from hippocampal tissue

26

was used to generate cDNA using the Quantitech two-step cDNA synthesis kit. Primers were

(A) Ribosome runoff patterns for clusters 1 and 2. The RPFs of each gene at each time point was
normalized to time 0. The euclidean distance matrix was then calculated, followed by hierarchical
clustering using Ward’s agglomeration method (Ward, 1963). The global pattern of each subcluster was summarized using the corresponding median and standard deviation in each
timepoint. Representative ribosome runoff profiles are shown.
(B) CDS length dependency of the ribosome runoff rates. Results of the KS test for significance
are shown
(C) GO terms for sub-clusters 2,4, 5 and 6.

Figure S3. Sedimentation of proteins in polysome sucrose gradients. (Related to Figure 4,
also see Table S1)
(A) Hippocampal extracts, some of which were treated with RNAse A, were centrifuged through
sucrose gradients, fractionated, and immunoblotted for FMRP, RPS6 and RPL4. Long and short
refer to relative exposure times.
(B) Hippocampal slices from WT or FMRP KO mice were treated with vehicle only or HHT for 30
min. The gradients were fractionated and immunoblotted for the indicated proteins. The red arrow
denotes the eEF2 band. The medium polysome fractions are indicated.

Figure S4. H3K36me3 ChIP metagene analysis (Related to Figure 6, also see Table S2)
(A) Scatter plot for ChIP-seq normalized reads density (Transcripts per million mapped reads,
TPM) mapped to the genic regions between biological replicate samples, WT1 and WT2 and
Fmr1 KO1 and Fmr1 KO2. r values for correlation efficiency is shown. Asterisks indicate statistical
significance.

(B) Metagene plots using deepTools for distribution of H3K36me3 marks along the gene lengths.
A similar increase in ChIP signal in all samples is seen in the gene body. The transcription start
site (TSS), Transcription end site (TES) and 2.0kb downstream is shown.
(C) Heatmap for distribution of H3K36me3 signal along the gene length in each sample, compiled
plot in Figure S4B. The transcription start site (TSS), Transcription end site (TES) and 4.0kb
downstream is shown. No overall differences in ChIP signal was observed between samples.
(D) Violin plot to assess the effect of gene length on H3K36me3 ChIP signal between WT (white)
and Fmr1 KO (red) samples.
(E) Histogram depicting number of islands (log scale) and their respective island length for all
significant islands (bp in log scale) identified in the WT (blue) and Fmr1 KO (green) ChIP-seq.
The island lengths were parsed in bins of 100bp and the center of each bin is plotted in the
histogram. Asterisks indicate statistical significance.
