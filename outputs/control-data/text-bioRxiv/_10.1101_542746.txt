Abstract
Membrane-potential dynamics mediate bacterial electrical signaling at both intra- and inter- cellular
levels. Membrane potential is also central to cellular proliferation. It is unclear whether the cellular
response to external electrical stimuli is influenced by the cell‚Äôs proliferative capacity. A new strategy
enabling electrical stimulation of bacteria with simultaneous monitoring of single-cell membrane
potential dynamics would allow bridging this knowledge gap and further extend electrophysiological
studies into the field of microbiology. Here we report that an identical electrical stimulus can cause
opposite polarization dynamics depending on cellular proliferation capacity. This was demonstrated
using two model organisms, namely B. subtilis and E. coli, and by developing an apparatus enabling
exogenous electrical stimulation and single-cell time-lapse microscopy. Using this bespoke apparatus, we
show that a 2.5 sec electrical stimulation causes hyperpolarization in unperturbed cells. Measurements
of intracellular K+ and the deletion of the K+ channel suggested that the hyperpolarization response is
caused by the K+ efflux through the channel. When cells are pre-exposed to UV-violet light, the same
electrical stimulation depolarizes cells instead of causing hyperpolarization. A mathematical model
extended from the FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron model suggested that the opposite response dynamics are
due to the shift in resting membrane potential. As predicted by the model, electrical stimulation only
induced depolarization when cells are treated with antibiotics, protonophore or alcohol. Therefore,
electrically induced membrane potential dynamics offer a novel and reliable approach for rapid detection
of proliferative bacteria and determination of their sensitivity to antimicrobial agents at the single-cell
level.

Compared to animal bioelectrical signaling, bacterial electrical signaling is understudied and only recently
were the excitation dynamics of membrane potential shown to mediate the intra- and inter- cellular
signaling which regulates important physiological processes, namely mechanosensation, spore formation
and biofilm dynamics (1‚Äì4). In animal bioelectrical signaling, externally applied electrical stimuli and
measurements of cellular electrical properties have been the principle methodology (5‚Äì8). This approach
has led to many key discoveries regarding the roles of animal bioelectrical signaling (e.g. early tissue
development (9, 10), regeneration (11) and carcinogenesis (12‚Äì14)) and has fostered the development
of real-world applications such as for tissue engineering (15‚Äì17), wound healing (6, 18) and
electroceuticals (19). Utilizing exogenous stimuli is an important step forward toward understanding
bacterial electrical signaling and development of applications based on bacterial electrophysiology. In the
past, applications of electric currents to bacteria were used for sanitization (20), electroporation (21) and
most recently synthetic biology (22). However, due to the only recent discovery of bacterial membranepotential excitation dynamics, use of external electrical signals in the context of bacterial
electrophysiology has been left largely unexplored.

where ‚àÜùõπ
is the induced membrane potential, ùëé is the cell radius, ùê∏ is the applied field strength, ùëì is
the AC field frequency and ùúè is the relaxation time of the membrane (23). This equation, derived from
the electromagnetic theory (24), expresses that the maximum change in the membrane potential of a
cell caused by an electrical stimulus is proportional to the applied field strength. Theoretically, when an
electrical stimulus is applied to proliferative bacterial cells, it should lead to opening of voltage-gated K +
channels (Kv) and consequent hyperpolarization due to K+ efflux. Conferring the typical values of bacterial
resting potential (-140~-75 mV (25, 26)) and threshold potential for Kv (~-50 mV (27)) on the equation,
one can expect that the depolarization by an electrical stimulus with the field strength of approximately
+35~120 mV/¬µm should open voltage-gated K+ channels on bacteria.

In addition to its role in bioelectrical signaling, membrane potential is central to cellular
proliferation; it provides the essential driving force for ATP synthesis (28) and is crucial for cell division
(29). A quantitative estimation based on the measured energy consumption of E. coli suggests that the
maintenance of membrane potential accounts about half of the total energy consumption (30), and thus
it is inherently linked to the proliferative capacity. In fact, the proliferative capacity is commonly
determined either by direct time-lapse observation of individual cells or by probing the intracellular state
using membrane potential. The latter could be achieved using fluorescent indicators for membrane
potential such as Thioflavin T (ThT), DiOC2(3) and Rhodamine 123 (3, 31‚Äì34). However, the use of such
indicators for determining the proliferative capacity is known to be difficult because membrane potential
can be affected by many physiological states and environmental conditions (35‚Äì37). Due to the baseline
fluorescence of cells being affected by a variety of conditions, comparisons between individual cells,
populations of cells and difference species are technically complex. This means that meticulous and
tedious calibrations are required for species, strains, mediums and detection systems. The difficulties
associated with these calibrations often preclude the broad use of these agents for the detection of
proliferative bacteria. Nevertheless, these fluorescent indicators provide a useful indication of
intracellular physiological state for live-cell imaging.

The dual roles of membrane potential in both signaling and proliferation beg the question
regarding the interplay between these two roles of membrane potential. In particular, could the electrical
response of cells be affected by the proliferative capacity of individual cells? This is a fundamentally
important question for understanding bacterial electrical signaling because the input-output relations
are fundamental to ‚Äúsignaling‚Äù (38). However, it remains unclear whether cellular responses to an
electrical stimulus differ depending on their proliferative capacity. If it does, one may expect that an
identical signal input produces different outputs depending on their proliferative capacities, which could
be a novel dynamics-based approach to probing cellular proliferative capacity through the monitoring of
cellular electrical responses.

In this study, we utilized an exogenous electrical stimulus to investigate the impact of
proliferative capacity on electrical signal response. By experimentally testing a prediction from a
mathematical model, we showed that an exogenous electrical stimulus induces hyperpolarization in
unperturbed cells while inducing depolarization in inhibited cells. This finding offers a novel application
to use bacterial electrophysiological dynamics for rapid detection of proliferative cells and differentiation
of proliferative and non-proliferative cells within a minute after electrical stimulation.

To investigate the potential impacts of proliferative capacity on electrical signaling response, direct
observation of cell proliferation, membrane potential and its response to electrical stimuli at the
individual-cell level is needed. However, the commercially available apparatus for neural
electrophysiology were unsuitable due to the small size of bacterial cells; i.e. ~1.4 ¬µm 3 for B. subtilis and
E. coli (39). To overcome this technical challenge, we designed and developed a novel tool for bacterial
electrophysiology. The tool consists of an electrical relay circuit with an open-source I/O board, Arduino
UNO, and a bespoke electrode-coated glass-bottom dish (Fig. 1A and S1-3, see Methods for details).
Bacterial cells were inoculated on agarose pads and placed on the electrode surface. Importantly, this
setup enables the monitoring of cells at single-cell resolution using phase-contrast and the fluorescence
membrane-potential indicator, ThT (Fig. 1B).

To examine whether an externally applied electrical stimulus is capable of opening K+ channels on
bacterial membranes, we applied an exogenous electrical stimulus (3 Vpp AC 0.1 kHz for 2.5 sec) to B.
subtilis cells placed between the 50 ¬µm electrode gap (Fig. 1B). Upon electrical stimulation, the intensity
of ThT fluorescence increased, indicating a hyperpolarization response (Fig. 1C). Single-cell analysis of the
fluorescence dynamics revealed that most cells exhibited the hyperpolarization of membrane potential
(Vm), while a small subpopulation of cells depolarizes upon stimulation (Fig. S4A). Intriguingly, the growth
rate of these depolarizing cells was found to be much lower compared to other cells (Fig. S5). No
detectable change in ThT intensity was observed with the absence of electrical stimulus, indicating that
the observe dynamics are induced by the electrical stimulus (Fig. S6). The hyperpolarization response
suggests that electrical stimulation causes the efflux of cations such as K+, the dominant intracellular
cation. It has been shown that chemical depolarization opens the YugO potassium channels (3). The
Schwan equation predicts that external electrical stimuli can depolarize bacterial cellular membranes
(40). Therefore, we hypothesized that depolarization by the electrical stimulation opens YugO channels,
resulting in membrane hyperpolarization by K+ efflux.

To test this hypothesis, the same experiment was conducted with a mutant strain lacking the
gene encoding the YugO potassium channel. Although the strain still showed an initial hyperpolarization
response in the timescale of ~5 sec, the hyperpolarization response on the timescale of ~30 sec is greatly
attenuated (Fig. 1D, E and S4B). For a further test, we measure the intracellular K + levels using Asante
Potassium Green-2 AM (APG-2 AM) (3), and found that the intracellular K+ decreases upon stimulation
(Fig. S7). These results suggest that K+ efflux through the YugO channel is responsible for the
hyperpolarization following an electrical stimulation. It also suggests that there may be other voltagegated channels with faster timescales of activation and inactivation (~5 sec). It is worth noting that
bacteria have several voltage-gated ion channels (1, 41, 42). This is an interesting observation in
conjunction with the fact that different neural ion channels have their unique timescales of activation
and inactivation which contribute to information processing (27). We also conducted the same
experiment with E. coli and confirmed that E. coli cells also exhibit hyperpolarization in response to an
external electrical stimulus (Fig. S8). Together, these results demonstrate with single-cell resolution that
a pulsed electrical stimulus can induce a hyperpolarization response in bacterial cells.

Having tested our apparatus, we examined the impact of proliferative capacity on signal response by
using inhibited cells. To inhibit the proliferative capacity of cells, we chose UV-Violet light (400 nm)
because it is one of the most commonly used sanitization methods, which has been shown to be effective
with both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (43, 44). Importantly, application of UV-V light
allows spatially precise inhibition, creating both irradiated and unirradiated regions within the same field
of view. This is critical because it ensures identical electrical stimulation is applied to both proliferative
and inhibited cells. We irradiated B. subtilis cells in a defined region by UV-V light for 30 sec (Fig. 2A). The
growth suppression of the irradiated cells was confirmed by the single-cell analysis of phase-contrast
time-lapse microscopy before being stimulated with an electrical pulse (Fig. S10). Upon an electrical
stimulation, the irradiated cells exhibit depolarization, while cells in untreated regions become
hyperpolarized, in spite of the fact that both received identical electrical stimulus (Fig. 2B and C). This
experiment demonstrates that an identical electrical stimulus can result in cellular response in apparent
opposite directions depending on whether cells are exposed to UV-V or not. Strikingly, analysis of the
fluorescence dynamics after electrical stimulation showed a clear bimodal distribution correlating with
the irradiation (Fig. S11A and B). To examine whether this is unique to B. subtilis, we conducted the same
experiment with E. coli cells. The result with E. coli also revealed distinct responses depending on whether
cells were treated by UV or not (Fig. S11C). These results suggest that proliferative and growth-inhibited
cells respond differently to an identical electrical stimulus and that this difference in response dynamics
is common to these two phylogenetically distant model organisms.

To gain conceptual understanding of the observed distinct responses to an identical electrical stimulus,
we used a mathematical framework based on FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neuron model. The FHN neuron
model, originally published over half a century ago (45), is one of the most paradigmatic models in
neuroscience due to its mathematical simplicity and richness for capturing complex behaviors (46). We
extended the FHN neuron model to bacterial electrophysiology while retaining its mathematical
simplicity (see SI text for details). Briefly, in our FHN bacteria model, we considered two parameters
representing the resting-state membrane potential and K+ transmembrane gradient. Numerical
simulations of the model showed that an external electrical stimulus causes hyperpolarization in
proliferative cells, while the same stimulus produces a relaxation response from depolarization in
inhibited cells (Fig. 3A and S12). This is because the direction of K+ flux (influx or efflux) differ depending
on the resting-state membrane potential and transmembrane concentration gradient of K + (Fig. 3B).
According to our simulations, opening of K+ channels in proliferative cells results in K+ efflux following the
concentration gradient, thus causes hyperpolarization. However, the same opening of K + channels only
lead to the relaxation from depolarization due to weaker transmembrane K+ gradient. This mechanistic
insight from the simulations predicts that the shift in resting-state membrane potential is sufficient to
alter the response dynamics to an electrical stimulus. This means that different classes of growthinhibition treatments should also make cells to respond by depolarization.

To examine this prediction from the model, we conducted the electrical stimulation experiment
with the cells exposed to different classes of common growth-inhibition treatments; namely, an antibiotic
vancomycin, a protonophore CCCP and a common antimicrobial agent ethanol. As predicted by the
model, vancomycin-treated cells exhibited a clear depolarization in response to an exogenous electrical
stimulus (Fig. 3C), as opposed to the hyperpolarization response seen in unperturbed cells (Fig. 1C).
Experimental tests with the cells treated with ethanol or CCCP also showed depolarization response (Fig.
3D and S14). These results strongly support the conclusion drawn from the FHN model that proliferative
and inhibited cells produce opposite membrane-potential dynamics, despite cells being treated by an
identical electrical stimulus. Conversely, this finding suggests that the proliferative and inhibited cells can
be distinguished based on their response to an exogeneous electrical stimulus.

The above observations and understanding raised the possibility of using the electrically induced
membrane-potential dynamics for differentiation of species in a mixed culture based on the sensitivity
to selective antibiotics. This process would find a wide range of applications where detection of
proliferative bacteria is crucial. For proof of concept, we explored this possibility using a co-culture of E.
coli (Gram-negative) and B. subtilis (Gram-positive). Our hypothesis was that the above approach of
measuring electrically induced membrane-potential dynamics allows for the rapid differentiation of E.
coli and B. subtilis when combined with exposure to vancomycin. This is based on the fact that
vancomycin inhibits the cell-wall synthesis of Gram-positives but is largely inactive to Gram-negatives
due to their outer membrane barrier (47).

To test this hypothesis, we co-cultured fluorescently labeled strains of E. coli and B. subtilis
expressing mCherry and YFP under IPTG inducible promoters for E. coli and B. subtilis, respectively. Multichannel fluorescence imaging exhibited distinct signals for E. coli and B. subtilis (Fig. 4A). The fluorescence
of ThT showed lower intensity with E. coli compared to B. subtilis (Fig. 4B). Although the exact reason for
this is unclear it may suggest that there is a difference in stability or fluorescence yield of ThT between
these two species. This difference in intensity level highlights an advantage of our approach focusing on
the response dynamics rather than being reliant on the initial affinity of the cells for the dye. After an
hour-long exposure to vancomycin, the co-culture was treated with an external electrical stimulus. The
result revealed distinct patterns of membrane potential dynamics for E. coli and B. subtilis cells treated
with vancomycin. Specifically, the electrical stimulation causes E. coli to become hyperpolarized, while
depolarizing B. subtilis (Fig. 4 C, D and Fig. S16). Similar patterns were observed with mono-cultures of E.
coli or B. subtilis (Fig. S15). We also confirmed that vancomycin is active on B. subtilis, but not on E. coli
(Fig. S13). The histogram of individual-cells response revealed distinct distributions between E. coli and
B. subtilis (Fig. 4E). These results thus demonstrate that the approach focusing on electrically induced
membrane-potential dynamics allows for rapid differentiation of E. coli and B. subtilis in a mixed culture.

Our hope is that the experimental setup we have developed and demonstrated in this work will
encourage more microbiologists to consider bacterial electrophysiology in conjunction with their
physiological processes of interest. In addition to mechanosensation and biofilm dynamics, membrane
potential is closely associated with important microbiological processes including persister formation and
antibiotics resistance (48‚Äì51). This is an important societal challenge since antimicrobial resistance is
rising. Our device will provide a new toolkit to identify the molecular-mechanism involved in this relation.
It would also be useful to systematically analyze whether externally altering membrane potential using
electrical stimulation impacts the formation of persisters. Furthermore, our device could be used for
single-cell investigation of metabolic electron flow, which would be particularly important for metabolic
engineering (52‚Äì54). Beyond these phenomena known to be related to membrane potential, we
speculate that bacterial electrical signaling may play roles in many more physiological processes than
previously realized. The uses of exogeneous electrical stimuli should unlock opportunities to gain new
insights regarding bacterial electrical signaling mediated by membrane potential dynamics. In parallel to
fundamental research, we envision that the use of applied electrical stimuli in the context of bacterial
electrophysiology will open the door to future developments into a novel approach for real-time
electrical control of bacterial functions.

Our finding, that proliferative capacity alters cellular response to electrical stimuli, provides
insights into bacterial electrical signaling. For example, it was shown that metabolic stress, namely
glutamate limitation, triggers biofilm electrical signaling (3). Our findings now suggest that metabolic
stress is not only capable of initiating electrical signaling but also alters the cellular response to this
signaling. This additional layer of interaction between metabolic activity and electrical signaling can form
a feedback loop that allows emergence of complex behavior. Characterizing this feedback interaction and
examining the impacts of electrical stimulus to biofilms are important future research tasks. In E. coli
mechano-sensation, electro-physiological response to mechanical stress was shown to be

heterogeneous, although the source of this heterogeneity remains unclear (1). If the response to
electrical stimuli is intrinsically linked to proliferative capacity, then our discovery may suggest that the
endogenous heterogeneity in proliferative capacity can be a source of this heterogeneity. It will be
interesting to examine this possibility using single-cell microscopy analysis combined with an applied
exogeneous electrical stimulus.

Our simulation and experiments suggested that the distinct response dynamics between
proliferative and inhibited cells are due to a shift in resting membrane potential. Since the maintenance
of membrane potential accounts for a major fraction of cellular energy consumption (30), it seems
plausible that different types of metabolic and environmental stress would all ultimately lead to
imbalance in transmembrane ion gradient at resting state. For instance, the Ktr potassium uptake system
in B. subtilis and the Kdp potassium uptake system in E. coli are both ATP-driven (55, 56). This means that
maintaining the resting-state membrane potential requires constant consumption of ATP in order to keep
the intracellular K+ level up to two orders of magnitudes higher than the outside. When an electrical
stimulus opens voltage-gated K+ channels, the flux of K+ through the channel follows the electrochemical
gradient of K+, which indicates that hyperpolarization due to K+ efflux occurs only when intracellular K+
concentration is significantly greater than the extracellular level. This effect was accounted by the
parameter kK in our FHN bacteria model (see SI text). In the future studies, we will quantitatively analyze
the dynamics of other electrophysiologically important ions, such as Ca2+ and Cl-, and determine their
contributions to the membrane potential dynamics in bacteria. Biological and biophysical
characterization of the dynamics of transmembrane gradients of different ions and their corresponding
channels will form the fundamental basis to our understanding of bacterial electrical signaling. Another
important area of research is to identify the molecular mechanism by which electrical stimuli open the
YugO potassium channel.

Finally, our findings offer a novel approach for rapid detection of proliferative bacteria without
the need of observing actual proliferation. Most importantly, the focus on response dynamics minimizes
the requirement of calibrations for differentiation of proliferative and inhibited cells. This contrasts with
the currently available techniques relying on single-time point measurements which could be affected by
many physiological states in various ways such as species, growth phases and media (33). It is also worth
noting that our approach could detect proliferative cells within a minute after an electrical stimulation,
as opposed to the typical duration of 12-48 hours required by conventional culture-based detection
methods (57). This is an attractive feature since it could accelerate the examination of antimicrobial
agents and diagnosis in medical sector and enable efficient quality-control in the water, pharmaceutical,
food and beverage industries. The growing demand for fast identification of live bacterial cells has been
driving the developments of novel technologies for rapid bacterial detection (57). Our findings provide a
novel strategy with a unique capability to differentiate UV-damaged cells from healthy cells. In further
studies, we will examine if this approach enables the detection of medically and industrially relevant
bacterial species for timely diagnosis. If applied widely, this approach of using membrane-potential
dynamics and exogenous electrical stimuli could bring great societal benefits by accelerating the
detection of proliferative bacteria and determination of their sensitivity to antimicrobial agents.

vancomycin hydrochloride, 1 mM NH4Cl and 0.25% (w/v) glucose were supplemented to the MSgg LMPagarose pads. Pads were prepared as described previously (59). Briefly, LMP agarose (Formedium,
Bacteriological Granulated Agar) was dissolved in MSgg and left to solidify between two 22 mm x 22 mm
cover glasses (Fisher Scientific) for 10 minutes at room temperature. When stated, final concentration of
1 % (v/v) ethanol or 100 ¬µM CCCP was supplemented to MSgg liquid and MSgg agarose pads. For the
measurements of intracellular K+, APG-2 (Abcam PLC), instead of ThT, was supplemented to MSgg agarose
pad at the final concentration of 2 ¬µM. The solidified agar was cut into approximately 5 mm x 5 mm pads.
2 ¬µl of bacterial liquid LB culture (OD600 ‚âà 1.5) was inoculated onto each pad. Pads were then placed on
the gold-coated glass bottom dish for microscopy.

For the construction of E. coli K12 pGEX6P1-mCherry strain, pGEX-6P1 plasmid (GE Healthcare) was
digested with EcoRI and NotI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs). The mCherry gene was amplified
by PCR using PrimeSTAR Max DNA Polymerase (Takara Bio) using the primers AP609 (5‚ÄôCCCCTGGGATCCCCGGAATTCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAG-3‚Äô)
and
AP610
(5‚ÄôAGTCACGATGCGGCCGCTCGAGTTTAGCACTTGTACAGTTCGTCCATG-3‚Äô). The PCR product was assembled
together with the digested pGEX-6p1 by the Gibson Assembly using Gibson Assembly Master Mix kit (New
England Biolabs), and was transformed into competent E. coli K12 cells. The competent cells were
prepared using Mix&Go Competent Cells kit (Zymo Research). The sequence of the assembled plasmids
was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Source BioScience) and aligned using Benchling
(https://benchling.com/).

Components shown in Fig. S3 were mounted through-hole onto a solderable breadboard with copper
tracks printed onto one side. Connections between components were accomplished by soldering jumper
wires of appropriate length to the appropriate position on the copper track. A track breaking tool was
used to isolate the components which should not be connected but were on the same track. The
components were assembled as shown in the circuit diagram (Fig. S3). The trigger input from scientific
cMOS camera (Orca Flash 4.0, Hamamatsu) was connected to the circuit through a BNC (Bayonet NeillConcelman) connector soldered onto the circuit board. The signal pin from the BNC connector was
further connected to an analogue pin on an Arduino UNO R3 (Arduino, arduino.cc) to record when the
voltage output from the camera attached to the microscope. A counting loop was implemented in
Arduino script to count camera exposures to coordinate the electrical stimulate and sequential imaging.
At the programmed time in the imaging sequence a digital pin is set ‚ÄòHIGH‚Äô to provide power to an electromechanical relay. This switches the relay throw from ground to the input signal from the arbitrary
function generator (Tekronix). All counter electrodes are permanently grounded through a common
ground connection.

Stainless steel disks of 50 ¬µm in thickness and 39 mm in diameter were manufactured by Laser
Micromachining Ltd. with a negative electrode design and used as coating masks. A negative mask was
placed into a glass-bottom dish (HBST-5040, Willco Wells). The glass-bottom dish with a mask in place
was then attached to 40 mm stainless steel washers on a silicon wafer using several 5 mm neodymium
magnets. Once attached, the silicon wafer was mounted in an Electron Beam Physical Vapor Deposition
System (A custom built model II2000EB, Scientific Vacuum Systems); a 20 nm titanium adhesion layer and
a 100 nm gold conductive layer were deposed onto the dish, with the mask permitting the electrode
design to be applied. Copper wire was soldered to corresponding connections on a 10 pin IDC (Insulationdisplacement connector, RS Components) at channels corresponding to the electrodes. Small holes were
made through the plastic rim of the dish, with the copper wire being threaded through until all were in
their corresponding positions. The IDC was then fixed in position using two-part waterproof adhesive
(Araldite Rapid, RS Components). Once the IDC was fixed in place the wires were attached to their
corresponding electrode terminals with aqueous graphite conductive adhesive (Alfa Aesar), then left
overnight at room temperature to set to reduce resistance of the adhesive. Following this, the graphite
connections were covered with Araldite adhesive to protect them from moisture degradation.

Application of electrical stimulation was accompanied with time-lapse imaging with 2 fps (frames per
second) for 1 minute. An alternating current (AC) signal (0.1 kHz; 3 V peak-to-peak (-1.5~+1.5 V)) was
generated using an Arbitrary Function Generator (Tektronics) and connected to a series of relays, each
corresponding to an electrode on the gold-coated dish (Fig. S2). The camera trigger was connected to
Arduino UNO R3 in the relay circuit to control the timing of electrical stimulation; upon counting 10
camera exposures, the relay to the electrode being imaged would open for 2.5 sec, applying electrical
stimulation to the electrode while simultaneously imaging.

The membrane potential dynamics and growth of individual cells were recorded using an inverted epifluorescence microscope, DMi8 (Leica Microsystems), operated by MetaMorph (Molecular Devices). The
microscope is equipped with an incubation chamber (Pecon, i8 Incubator) which maintained the
temperature at 30¬∞C throughout the experiments. Prior to microscopy experiments, the chamber was set
to 30¬∞C for at least 3 hours, and samples were placed in the chamber for an hour. For all observations, a
100x objective lens (NA=1.3, HCX PL FLUOTAR, Leica) was used and images were taken with scientific
cMOS camera ORCA-Flash 4.0 v2 (Hamamatsu Photonics). Cell growth was monitored using phase
contrast (exposure time: 100 msec). ThT fluorescence was detected using a single-band filter set
consisting of Ex 438/24 nm, Em 483/32 nm, and Dichroic mirror 458 nm (Semrock), with exposure time
of 150 msec. For the mixed culture experiment, YFP was detected using a filter set consisting of Ex 509/22,
Em 544/24, and Dichroic mirror 526 (Semrock). mCherry was detected using a filter set consisting of Ex
554/23, Em 609/54, and Dichroic mirror 573 (Semrock). The exposure time for the imaging of both YFP
and mCherry was 300 msec.

For irradiation to UV violet light, cells were irradiated by UV-Violet light for 30 sec using the inverted
microscope DMi8 (Leica Microsystems) and the LED light source, SOLA SM II Light Engine (Lumencor),
with an excitation filter 400/16. Field Diaphragm of the microscope was used to irradiate only a specific
region of the field of view. Before electrical stimulation, a one-hour growth period was allowed during
which cells were observed using phase contrast microscopy to ascertain the effects of UV-V light. For
ethanol experiments, MSgg containing 1% (v/v) ethanol was used instead of Msgg.

Region of interest (ROI) was registered for individual cells and the fluorescence intensity over time for
each ROI was measured using Fiji/imageJ. The results were saved in csv (comma-separated values) and
imported to python. Based on the Nernst equation (See SI text for details), -ŒîVm was calculated by taking
the logarithms of the ratio between intracellular ThT fluorescence intensity (Fi) and the intensity at the
resting state (Fi,R). For measurement of cell elongation rate, ROI was registered for individual cells and
the cell size over time for each ROI was measured. The results were saved in csv and imported to MATLAB.
The elongation rates were determined as the slope of fitted straight lines. Numerical calculations were
performed in python using scipy (scipy.org) and numpy (numpy.org). Graphs and plots were generated
using the python data-visualization packages matplotlib (matplotlib.org) and seaborn (seaborn.pydata.
org). Scripts were written using Jupyter Notebook (jupyter.org/).

log(FThT/FThT,R), where FThT is ThT fluorescence and FThT,R is ThT fluorescence at resting state (see SI text).
Time-traces of individual cells are shown in Fig. S4 (wt: n = 321; yugO: n =308). Images were taken at 2
fps. E) Histogram of -ŒîVm at 30 sec after electrical stimulation. The distributions of wildtype and yugO
are clearly distinguishable.

Figure 2
UV irradiation makes B. subtilis cells to response to an electrical stimulus in an opposite
direction. A) Phase-contrast microscopy image shows wildtype B. subtilis cells within the electrode gap.
A rectangular region indicated by the dashed line within the field-of-view was irradiated by UV light.
Growth was suppressed in the UV irradiated region, while cells outside of UV-irradiation region
replicated. B) The region shown in panel A was treated with an electrical stimulus. -ŒîVm was calculated
from ThT fluorescence (log(FThT/FThT,R)) and shown with the colormap in the panel. To an identical
electrical stimulus, unperturbed cells hyperpolarized (blue) and UV-irradiated cells depolarized (red). C)
Mean (thick lines) and Standard deviation (shaded color) of -ŒîVm for cells in unperturbed (blue) and UV
