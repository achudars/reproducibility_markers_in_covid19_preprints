SUMMARY
Post-translational modifications of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain (CTD) coordinate
the transcription cycle. Crosstalk between different modifications is poorly understood. Here, we
show how acetylation of lysine residues at position 7 of characteristic heptad repeats (K7ac)—
only found in higher eukaryotes—regulates phosphorylation of serines at position 5 (S5p), a
conserved mark of polymerases initiating transcription. We identified the regulator of pre-mRNA
domain-containing (RPRD) proteins as reader proteins of K7ac. K7ac enhanced CTD peptide
binding to the CTD-interacting domain (CID) of RPRD1A and RPRD1B proteins in isothermal
calorimetry and molecular modeling experiments. Deacetylase inhibitors increased K7ac- and
decreased S5-phosphorylated polymerases, consistent with acetylation-dependent S5
dephosphorylation by an RPRD-associated S5 phosphatase. Consistent with this model,
RPRD1B knockdown increased S5p, but enhanced K7ac, indicating RPRD proteins recruit K7
deacetylases, including HDAC1. We also report auto-regulatory crosstalk between K7ac and
S5p via RPRD proteins and their interactions with acetyl- and phospho-eraser proteins.

INTRODUCTION
The RNA polymerase II (Pol II) complex is highly conserved in all eukaryotic cells and
responsible for production of most gene expression products (Buratowski, 2003; Eick and
Geyer, 2013). RPB1, the largest subunit of the complex, contains the catalytic core of the
complex and a unique regulatory region called the C-terminal domain (CTD). In eukaryotes, the
CTD is composed of 20 or more repeats with a heptad consensus sequence, Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7,
which is highly conserved from yeast to humans. In multicellular eukaryotes, the CTD is
expanded and contains a varying number of non-consensus repeats, depending on the
organism (Chapman et al., 2008). The 52 repeats of the mammalian CTD can be divided into 21
mostly consensus repeats proximal to the enzymatic core, and 31 non-consensus repeats distal
from the core with less fidelity to the consensus. Divergence from the consensus sequence
most commonly occurs at position 7, where the consensus serine is most commonly replaced
with an asparagine (N), threonine (T), or lysine (K) (Eick and Geyer, 2013). The CTD is
intrinsically disordered and functions as an interaction platform for accessory proteins required
for transcription and transcription-associated RNA-processing events (Buratowski, 2009;
Jasnovidova and Stefl, 2013).
The heptad repeats within the CTD are extensively and dynamically post-translationally
modified at different times during the transcription cycle. Of the seven consensus CTD residues,
five can be phosphorylated (Y1, S2, T4, S5, and S7), and the two remaining proline residues
can undergo isomerization to cis or trans conformations (Heidemann et al., 2013). Serine-5
phosphorylation (S5p) and serine-2 phosphorylation (S2p) are the most thoroughly studied CTD
modifications (Buratowski, 2009; Jasnovidova and Stefl, 2013). Serine-5 is phosphorylated by
the cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) subunit of general transcription factor TFIIH, is enriched
at promoters, and decreases successively towards the 3′ end of genes (Brookes et al., 2012;
Ebmeier et al., 2017). The phosphorylated serine-2 mark, placed by several kinases (CDK9,
CDK12, CDK13 and BRD4), starts to accumulate downstream of transcription start sites and
steadily increases towards the 3′ ends of genes, reflecting its critical role in productive
polymerase elongation (Bartkowiak et al., 2010; Devaiah et al., 2012; Nechaev and Adelman,
2011). Similar to S5p, Serine-7 phosphorylation (S7p) is catalyzed by CDK7, is enriched near
promoters and in gene bodies, and regulates the expression snRNA genes (Brookes et al.,
2012; Egloff et al., 2012). Tyrosine-1 phosphorylation is enriched near promoters, and has been
linked to enhancer and antisense transcription, as well as transcription termination (Descostes
et al., 2014; Shah et al., 2018). Threonine-4 phosphorylation is enriched in coding regions and
is required for cell viability and transcription elongation (Hintermair et al., 2012).
Post-translational modifications (PTMs) specifically found in non-consensus repeats
include asymmetric dimethylation of a single arginine (R1810me2), conserved among some
metazoa, that regulates transcription of small nuclear and nucleolar RNAs (Sims et al., 2011). In
addition, lysine residues at position 7 of eight heptad repeats are acetylated by the
acetyltransferase p300/CBP (KAT3A/B) (K7ac), and are also mono- and di-methylated by an asyet-unknown methyltransferase (Dias et al., 2015; Schroder et al., 2013; Voss et al., 2015;
Weinert et al., 2018). These lysine residues evolved in higher eukaryotes in the common
ancestor of the metazoan lineage, and are highly conserved among vertebrates (Simonti et al.,
2015). While lysine-7 mono- and di-methylation marks are found near promoters, K7ac is
enriched in gene bodies (Dias et al., 2015). K7 residues are required for productive transcription
elongation of immediate early genes in response to epidermal growth factor stimulation
(Schroder et al., 2013). Importantly, K7ac marks are found at ~80% of actively transcribed
genes, with a peak in signal +500 bp downstream of the transcription start site (TSS), indicating
that the modification could more broadly regulate the transition from transcription initiation to
productive elongation (Schroder et al., 2013). In a genetic model in which all eight K7 residues
were mutated to arginines (8KR), cells expressing 8KR RPB1 exhibited altered expression of

genes relating to development, multicellularity and cell adhesion, underscoring a critical role of
K7ac in the development of higher eukaryotes (Simonti et al., 2015).
Effector proteins interacting with differentially modified CTDs often contain a so-called
CTD-interacting domain (CID), which is one of the best-studied CTD-binding modules and is
conserved from yeast to humans (Ni et al., 2011). The mammalian Regulator of Pre-mRNA
Domain-containing (RPRD) proteins 1A, 1B and RPRD2 proteins are homologues of the yeast
transcription termination factor Rtt103, and each contains a CID (Ni et al., 2011). Rtt103 and
RPRD CIDs bind CTD peptides carrying S2p, but not S5p; S7p and unmodified K7 residues
reside at the edge of the CID binding cleft, and can be substituted without altering their binding
affinity (Jasnovidova et al., 2017; Meinhart and Cramer, 2004; Ni et al., 2014). RPRD1A and
RPRD1B are found in macromolecular complexes that associate with Pol II and transcription
regulatory factors, including the S5-phosphatase RPAP2 (Liu et al., 2015; Morales et al., 2014;
Ni et al., 2011; Ni et al., 2014; Patidar et al., 2016). RPRD1A, also called P15RS, regulates
G1/S cell-cycle progression and suppresses Wnt and β-catenin signaling via interactions with
the class I lysine deacetylase HDAC2 and transcription factor 4 (TCF4) (Jin et al., 2018; Liu et
al., 2015; Liu et al., 2002; Wu et al., 2010). RPRD1B, also called CREPT, was identified in a
mass spectrometry (MS)-based screen for mammalian Pol II-interacting proteins; it is
upregulated in various cancers and regulates genome stability and transcription termination (Lu
et al., 2012; Morales et al., 2014; Patidar et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018). Although the
homology with Rtt103 implies a conserved role in transcription termination and explains why the
proteins are enriched in the 3′ ends of eukaryotic genes, an additional less well-defined role of
RPRD proteins has emerged at the 5′ ends of genes in higher eukaryotes. This involves a
mechanism to regulate genome stability through the resolution of R-Loops, which are DNA-RNA
hybrids (Lu et al., 2012) as well as the recruitment of RPAP2 to initiating RNA Pol II (Ni et al.,
2014).
In this study, we provide molecular insight into the role of RPRD proteins at the 5′ ends
of genes and newly connect RPRD proteins with K7ac. We find that RPRD proteins via their
CIDs specifically interact with K7ac, and that this interaction promotes S5-dephosphorylation at
and beyond +500 bp downstream of the TSS. These data support a model in which vertebrates
evolved specific crosstalk between S5p and K7ac to ensure precise transcription initiation
dynamics and a timely transition to a productive elongation phase at a defined distance from the
TSS.

RESULTS
Preferential Binding of RPRD Proteins to Acetylated RPB1
To identify proteins that interact with Pol II K7ac, we performed stable isotope labeling with
amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). We overexpressed HA-tagged RPB1 proteins, either wild
type (WT) or 8KR mutant, in HEK293T cells. The proteins also contained a known α-amanitin
resistance mutation enabling propagation of successfully transfected cells in the presence of αamanitin, which induces the degradation of endogenous Pol II (Bartolomei and Corden, 1987).
After culture of cells in differential metabolic labeling medium, RPB1-containing complexes were
purified via their HA tag and subjected to MS analysis (Figure 1A, Supplemental Table 1). We
found all members of the RPRD family preferentially bound to WT RBP1, including RPRD1A,
RPRD1B, RPRD2 along with several of their interacting partners, such as RPAP2, RPAP3,
MCM7 and RUVB1, that were identified by MS (Ni et al., 2011; Patidar et al., 2016) (Figure 1B).
Using HA-immunopurification and western blotting, we confirmed enrichment of K7ac (p
= 0.014) and RPRD1B (p=0.0098) in WT relative to 8KR samples, the most thoroughly studied
of the RPRD family (Figure 1C). In addition, we confirmed that the RPRD-interacting protein
RPAP3 (p = 0.049), binds preferentially WT RPB1 protein relative to the 8KR mutant. However,
HSP90, another hit in the screen, showed no preferential interaction in follow-up studies (Figure
1C, D). The enrichment of endogenous RPRD1B and RPAP3 proteins after immunoprecipitation
of WT, but not mutant, HA-RPB1 was consistent among three or more independent experiments
and statistically significant (Figure 1D). We also tested the interaction of endogenous RPB1,
RPRD1A and RPRD1B proteins in NIH3T3 cells treated with lysine deacetylase (KDAC)
inhibitors. KDAC inhibitor treatment induced robust hyperacetylation of endogenous RPB1 in
input material as tested with an antibody specific for K7ac (Schroder et al., 2013), but did not
change unmodified Pol II protein levels as measured with the 8WG16 antibody, which correlate
with total Pol II levels (Tsai et al., 2018; Vian et al., 2018) (Figure 1E). After pulldown of
endogenous Pol II, more RPRD1A and RPRD1B proteins were recovered when cells were
treated with KDAC inhibitors as compared to vehicle-treated cells, confirming positive regulation
of the RPB1:RPRD interaction by acetylation (Figure 1E, F).
Next, we tested in vivo recruitment of RPRD1B to a known target gene, Leo1 (Ni et al.,
2011). Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by quantitative PCR, we found
RPRD1B recruitment to the Leo1 promoter (+33 bp) consistently enhanced in NIH3T3 cells
treated with KDAC inhibitors as compared to vehicle-treated cells (Figure 1G). Similar to what
we observed by western blotting, K7 residues were hyperacetylated at the Leo1 promoter in
response to KDAC inhibition in ChIP analysis with the K7ac-specific antibody. Importantly, Pol II
occupancy as measured with the 8WG16 antibody did not increase under KDAC inhibition,
confirming K7 hyperacetylation and enhanced RPRD1B recruitment in response to KDAC
inhibition (Figure 1G).

Direct Interaction of K7ac with RPRD CTD-Interacting Domains
To test whether K7ac modulates CTD-interacting domain (CID) binding to RPRD CIDs, we
performed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to measure the binding free energy between
synthetic CTD peptides and purified CID domains from both RPRD1A and RPRD1B proteins.
We generated CTD peptides spanning ~3 heptad repeats (20 amino acids) with repeat 39 at the
center. This region was chosen because it is acetylated and phosphorylated in vivo (Voss et al.,
2015; Weinert et al., 2018), and contains multiple consecutive K7 residues (Figure 2A).
Peptides were synthesized in an unmodified, acetylated (K7ac), or phosphorylated (S2p and
S5p) state. S2p was included as a positive control as it enhances CTD:CID interactions, while
S5p served as a negative control (Ni et al., 2014; Pineda et al., 2015). In addition, we combined
S2p and S5p with K7ac to investigate potential combined effects. Compared to the unmodified
CTD, binding of the RPRD CIDs to CTD peptides carrying K7ac had a significantly lower Kd
(2.3-fold reduction for RPRD1A and 3.8-fold for RPRD1B), indicating enhanced binding
(Figures 2B–E). S2p itself had a robust effect in enhancing CID binding, as previously
observed, but combining K7ac with S2p further decreased the Kd by 2.8-fold and 4.2-fold,
respectively. S5p-carrying peptides did not interact with CID proteins as expected, and adding
K7ac did not further enhance binding (Figures 2B–E). These observations indicate that K7ac
enhances the interaction of RPRD proteins with the Pol II CTD with and without additional S2p
marks.

Molecular Modeling of K7-Acetylated CTD Peptides with CID Domains
To better understand the mechanism for how K7ac stabilizes the binding of the CID and CTD
peptides, we performed molecular modeling with published RPRD1B CID structures bound to
CTD peptides pdb: 4Q94 (dimer) and 4Q96 (tetramer). RPRD protein dimerization is believed
to occur through coiled-coil domain interactions that are not present in these structures (Mei et
al., 2014; Ni et al., 2014), which nonetheless dimerize and tetramerize by domain swapping. We
proceeded with in silico analyses of both structures and searched for consistencies between
them. Because phosphorylation and acetylation change the net charge of the peptide fragment,
we first calculated the electrostatic potential of the CID structure to understand the charge
distribution along the binding cleft (Dolinsky et al., 2004). We found that the recognition module
within the CID in the dimeric and tetrameric structures has a positively charged binding pocket
with numerous amide-containing residues within 5Ǻ of the peptide (Figures 3A–D,
Supplemental Figure S1A–D). Acetylation and thus charge neutralization of the CTD lysine
side chain favors interaction with this binding pocket by reducing electrostatic repulsion with the
positively charged RPRD domains.
We also obtained 20-ns molecular dynamics trajectories to refine the models and identify
residues within the CID that directly interact with S2p and K7ac and, thus, contribute to the
recognition of these PTMs. Through these simulations, we reproduced the reported coordination
between S2p and R106 (Ni et al., 2014), and observed that the two K7 residues in the
acetylated state formed transient interactions with nearby CID residues (Figure 3C, D). In
particular, the first acetylated K7 residue in the CTD peptide formed transient hydrogen bonds
with two spatially proximal CID residues (N18 and N54). The second acetylated K7 residue
interacted with CID residues at the other end of the binding cleft (Q24, Q68, N69 and R72)
(Figure 3C, D). Similar results were obtained in simulations of the tetrameric structure, which
also showed coordination between S2p and R106 along with similar transient hydrogen-bonding
between K7ac and several residues in the CID (N18, Q20, E92 and K96) (Supplemental
Figure S1E, F). These results suggest that the acetylated lysine forms transient hydrogen
bonding interactions that may contribute to binding stability, particularly with asparagine and
glutamine that, like acetylated lysine, contain an amide group in the side chain.
Based on these observations, we hypothesized that RPRD1B evolved to specifically
recognize K7ac through spatially proximal amide-containing side chains. Specific modes of
recognition evolved to interact with different combinations of CTD modifications (Becker et al.,
2008; Ni et al., 2014). For example, the SCAF8 protein recognizes doubly phosphorylated CTD
peptides at S5 and S2 to regulate a putative role in pre-mRNA processing (Becker et al., 2008;
Patturajan et al., 1998). Sequence alignment of CID domains reveals that RPRD proteins
contain conserved asparagine and glutamine residues at key positions near the CID binding
cleft. In contrast, the corresponding residues of SCAF family CID domains contain lysine,
arginine or histidine residues (Figure 3I). We performed molecular modeling with acetylated
non-consensus peptides that interact with the SCAF8 crystal structure (PDB: 3D9K).
Interestingly, the SCAF8 CID binding interface contains a stronger net positive charge relative to
RPRD1B with several lysine, arginine and histidine residues less than 5Ǻ from the CTD peptide
(Figure 3E, F). Only two amide-containing side chains were observed in the binding region
(Q72, N120) compared with nine residues observed in RPRD1B (Figure 3G, H). These data
indicate K7 acetylation interacts with amide groups in stabilizing CID-CTD interactions in RPRD
proteins, something not conserved across other CID containing proteins (Figure 3I).

Increased K7ac Correlates with Reduced S5p Downstream of Transcription Start Sites
RPDR1 proteins interact with RPAP2, the mammalian homolog of yeast Rtr1 and a known S5
phosphatase (Ni et al., 2011). We tested the influence of K7ac on S5p levels by performing
ChIP-seq with antibodies specific for K7ac, S5p (4H8) and unmodified (8WG16) Pol II in
chromatin isolated from NIH3T3 cells treated with KDAC inhibitors. Average metagene profiles
measured as reads per million, relative to input controls, were generated for all expressed
genes (Ramirez et al., 2016) (Figure 4A–C). KDAC inhibition increased genome-wide Pol IIK7ac occupancy as expected, particularly 500 bp downstream of the TSS within the gene body
and downstream thereof. Pol II occupancy as measured with the 8WG16 antibody was not
markedly changed by KDAC inhibition (Figure 4A, B). Interestingly, S5p levels around the TSS
remained unchanged, while beyond the 500 bp mark S5p levels decreased below the level of
control cells, mirroring enhanced K7ac (Figure 4C). These data confirm that Kac and S5p levels
are inversely correlated with a control point 500 bp downstream of the TSS.
A focused analysis of known target genes of RPRD1B, such as Leo1 and Cyclin D1 (Lu
et al., 2012; Ni et al., 2011), showed corresponding profiles with lowered S5p and enhanced
K7ac levels downstream of the TSS in response to KDAC inhibition (Figure 4D). But for ~10%
of actively expressed genes, including Tub1a1 and Mdm2, S5p was not downregulated in
response to KDAC inhibition despite strong upregulation of K7ac. These results indicate that
these genes are possibly controlled by mechanisms other than the RPRD proteins (Figure 4E).
Unfortunately, we could not examine the occupancy of RPRD proteins genome-wide as the
available antibodies had an insufficient signal-to-noise ratio in ChIP-seq experiments (data not
shown).
Monoclonal antibodies such as the 8WG16 and 4H8 antibodies that we use in this
manuscript, are used to recognize CTD modification states by western botting and ChIP.
Changes in signal, or absence of signal, can indicate either a physical absence of the
modification, or masking of the epitope by other modifications (Heidemann et al., 2013). Using
the peptides we used for our ITC experiments (Figure 2A), we tested by dot-blot our Pol II
(K7ac) antibody specificity in the presence of S5p and S2p on the same repeat (Supplemental
Figure S2). We observe that S5 or S2 phosphorylation decrease, but do not abolish the K7ac
antibody recognition of acetylated CTD peptides. Furthermore, neither 4H8 nor 8WG16
antibodies are able to recognize the non-consensus CTD repeats tested (Supplemental Figure
S2). These results indicate that the reduction we see in S5p is not likely due to masking of the
4H8 antibody epitope, and that we probably underestimate the signal of K7ac that we observe in
our western blotting and ChIP-seq experiments.

RPRD1B Knockdown Perturbs Both K7ac and S5p Marks Genome-Wide
Overexpression of RPRD proteins decreases S5p levels at the Leo1 gene. This finding is
consistent with a model in which RPRD proteins recruit the S5 phosphatase RPAP2 (Ni et al.,
2011). We now performed the inverse experiment and knocked down RPRD1B in NIH3T3 cells
using lentiviral shRNAs. A 50% knockdown efficiency was sufficient to induce global S5
hyperphosphorylation as observed by western blotting, indicating a critical role of RPRD1B in
overall S5 dephosphorylation. Surprisingly, we also observed a consistent upregulation of K7ac
levels in RPRD1B knockdown cells, suggesting a K7 deacetylase was recruited by RPRD
proteins in addition to the S5 phosphatase (Figure 5A). No change in Pol II levels as measured
with the H-224 antibody was observed. Marked S5 hyperphosphorylation was also observed
when the HA-8KR mutant RPB1 protein was immunoprecipitated from transfected NIH3T3 cells,
confirming that K7 residues are required for proper S5 dephosphorylation (Figure 5B). In
addition, we found endogenous HDAC1 protein co-immunoprecipitating with endogenous
RPRD1B proteins in NIH3T3 cells, pointing to HDAC1 as a specific RPRD1-associated K7
deacetylase (Figure 5C).
Next, we performed ChIP-seq in RPRD1B knockdown cells with antibodies against
K7ac, S5p and unmodified Pol II. The most striking finding was the induction of a distinct TSSproximal increase in K7 acetylation with minimal changes to 8WG16 Pol II occupancy (Figure
5D and 5E). This is consistent with the observation that K7ac was induced upon RPRD1B
knockdown in western blot experiments (Figure 5A) and underscores a model where RPRD1B
recruits a K7 deacetylase that counterbalances K7 acetylation within the first 500–1000 bp of
transcribed genes. In conjunction with this, a dramatic increase in S5p upon RPRD1B
knockdown (Figure 5D, F) fits well with the observation that reduced RPRD1B levels globally
induce S5 hyperphosphorylation due to the lack of S5 phosphatase recruitment. Interestingly,
K7ac enrichment was localized specifically to the TSS-proximal region, whereas S5p levels
were higher globally than in cells treated with control shRNAs.
RNA-seq on RPRD1B knockdown cells identified 271 differentially expressed genes as
compared to control shRNA-treated cells (Supplemental Figure S3A, Table S2). RPRD1B was
among the most significantly downregulated genes with an mRNA knockdown efficiency of 41%
(p = 0.0019; Supplemental Figure S3D), similar to what was observed for protein expression.
Gene Ontology analysis on dysregulated genes indicated that RPRD1B knockdown induced
changes in genes related to developmental processes, multicellular organismal development
and cell adhesion, consistent with previous findings that complete knockout of the factor causes
embryonic lethality (Morales et al., 2014) (Supplemental Figure S3B–D). This finding agrees
with studies indicating that K7ac specifically evolved in higher eukaryotes and regulates
developmental genes with significant enrichment for evolutionary origins in the early history of
eukaryotes through early vertebrates (Schroder et al., 2013; Simonti et al., 2015). These data
identify RPRD1B as a regulator of genes involved in multicellular organismal development and
further support the model that RPRD proteins are relevant reader proteins of the K7ac mark in
higher eukaryotes.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we report a new molecular function for K7ac in decreasing S5p levels in the
transition from transcription initiation to elongation. We show that K7ac enhances the
recruitment of RPRD proteins to the initiated Pol II complex to facilitate S5 dephosphorylation;
this occurs presumably via RPAP2, their interacting S5 phosphatase (Figure 6A). Surprisingly,
we found that lack of RPRD1B protein expression also increased K7ac levels, indicating that in
addition to binding an S5 phosphatase, RPRD proteins recruit a K7 deacetylase that we
identified as HDAC1. This provides a unique autoregulatory mechanism as binding to RPRD
proteins to K7ac ultimately leads to the removal of the mark. Previous studies highlighted the
importance of S2p in enhancing the interaction between the CTD and RPRD CID domains (Ni et
al., 2014; Pineda et al., 2015), and so, the emergence of S2p downstream of K7ac may serve to
maintain RPRD recruitment to complete S5 dephosphorylation during the early phase of
transcription elongation (Ni et al., 2014). When levels of K7ac were perturbed by KDAC inhibitor
treatment (Figure 6B) or RPRD1B knockdown (Figure 6C), recruitment of the S5 phosphatase
was either enhanced, resulting in increased S5 dephosphorylation and lower S5p levels
genome-wide, or recruitment was diminished, enhancing S5p levels, respectively. Therefore,
these data support a model in which dynamics of K7 acetylation evolved to blunt the peak of S5
phosphorylation at a precise distance from the TSS in higher eukaryotes, likely facilitating the
transition between transcription initiation and productive elongation.

We previously reported a transient enrichment in the occupancy of K7-acetylated Pol II
located approximately +500 bp downstream of the TSS when we normalized K7ac peaks to
unmodified Pol II occupancy on expressed genes (Schroder et al., 2013). This fits well with the
self-limiting nature of K7ac where the modification recruits HDAC1 to support a negative
feedback loop of K7ac via the RPRD reader proteins. Here we observed characteristic changes
in S5p levels at and beyond the +500 bp mark that support the model that K7ac and S5p are
regulated by RPRD proteins. In our current study, peaks proximal to the +500 bp mark behaved
on average differently than peaks at or beyond the mark. There are several possible
explanations. A) RPRD proteins are recruited specifically to the +500 bp location (at the peak of
K7ac) and exert their effect on S5p and K7ac in this region and beyond. B) The balance
between S5 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation immediately downstream of the TSS is
shifted towards S5p, and efficient dephosphorylation only occurs after CDK7 levels are
additionally lowered beyond the TSS (Ebmeier et al., 2017). C) The transition of Pol II into
elongation and the occurrence of S2p at the transition point allow efficient RPRD association
and S5 dephosphorylation and K7 deacetylation. We envision that multiple of the mechanisms
could be in place to explain the observed changes.
An important finding of our study is that K7ac enhances the binding of the RPRD CIDs to
CTD peptides. We show that the affinity of the CID:K7ac interaction is ~90 M, which lies in the
range of acetyl-lysine interactions with bromodomains, the latter being the “classical” Kac
recognition domain (Muller et al., 2011). Interestingly, the K7ac:CID interaction accommodates
additional phosphorylation marks, such as S2p. This supports previous findings that the CID
domain creates a positively charged “channel” in which the CTD peptide is bound, depending on
its PTM status (Jasnovidova et al., 2017; Ni et al., 2014). Molecular modeling suggests that
K7ac recognition occurs through electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding with various
residues of the CID. The principles of specific recognition of phosphorylated amino acids have
been well-studied and are consistent with the features we highlighted for S2p.
Although lysine acetylation has received less attention, our results suggest that side
chains containing amide groups (N and Q) are important and form transient hydrogen bonds
with the amide group of acetylated K7 residues. The amide groups in proteins, including those
in the backbone and asparagine and glutamine side chains, tend to interact with each other,
such as in secondary structure elements, asparagine capping the N-terminal end of alpha
helices, and poly-glutamine repeats (Perutz et al., 1994). It is especially interesting that N18,
N69 and Q24, which form hydrogen bonds with the acetylated lysine amide in the dimer or
tetramer models, are conserved across RPRD proteins in mammals (Ni et al., 2014), but not in
other CTD-binding proteins, such as SCAF8. Furthermore, we note that several CTD heptad
repeats contain asparagine at position 7. We speculate that RPRD proteins may recognize such
repeats, although this will require further experiments.
Serine-7 phosphorylation is the third-best studied PTM of the CTD. In mammals, S7p is
enriched with S5p near promoters, but is uniquely stable in gene bodies (Descostes et al.,
2014). Similar to K7ac, S7-phosphorylated residues are considered docking stations for RPAP2
that regulate S5-dephosphorylation and expression of snRNA genes (Egloff et al., 2012).
Interestingly, S7p also enhances CTD:CID interaction consistent with the enhancement of
electrostatic stability we describe here for K7ac (Egloff et al., 2012; Ni et al., 2014). Recent
studies examined individual repeat PTMs in vivo and showed that CTD heptads are generally
phosphorylated at one position per repeat (Schuller et al., 2016; Suh et al., 2016). This supports
a model of dynamic movement along the 52 mammalian CTD repeats proposed here where the
RPRD complex may start at distal non-consensus regions and work its way up to more proximal
consensus regions to reach all S5p marks and allow maximal placement of S2p.
Another notable finding is the autoregulatory nature of K7ac. Although RPAP2 is a
known S5 phosphatase, we showed that HDAC1 is a new RPRD1B-associated deacetylase.
Previous studies with overexpressed proteins identified HDAC2 as a RPRD1A-associated

deacetylase and, thus, another possible candidate for CTD regulation (Liu et al., 2015).
However, using endogenous proteins, we found no HDAC2 associated with RPRD proteins, but
this may be due to limited sensitivity of the antibodies used (data not shown). The two
candidates, HDAC1 and HDAC2, are consistent with our previous observations that class I/II
KDACs are involved in deacetylation of the hypophosphorylated form of Pol II during or after
transcription initiation (Schroder et al., 2013). Notably, HDAC1 and HDAC2 often function
together within the NuRD complex, and further studies will investigate how NuRD complex
proteins could regulate K7ac and thus Pol II-dependent transcription (Basta and Rauchman,
2015; Xue et al., 1998).
Gene expression changes as a consequence of RPRD1B knockdown were moderate,
but the cellular pathways altered in response to RPRD1B knockdown revealed a relevant list of
genes. These were mainly involved in development of multicellular organisms and were
strikingly similar to differentially regulated pathways found in WT and 8KR- Pol II expressing
cells (Simonti et al., 2015). We have previously shown that K7ac evolution in higher eukaryotes
presented a unique mode by which transcription elongation is regulated in mammals. We
propose that the regulation of K7ac is linked to the now reported recruitment of RPRD proteins
and the corresponding S5 dephosphorylation, a step tightly controlled in its dynamics in yeast.
The question of why the need arose to control S5p with K7ac in multicellular organisms at a
defined distance from the TSS remains unanswered but will be further examined. At this point,
our data underscore a key role of controlled CTD PTM regulation at the transition from initiation
to elongation important for the expression of developmentally relevant genes; they further
demonstrate that this control depends on precise interactions with the RPRD complex, which
performs reader and effector functions at a well-defined time during the transcription cycle.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Antibodies and Reagents
See Table S3 (Key Resource Table); Dynabeads Protein G (ThermoFisher, 10003D),
Dynabeads Protein A (ThermoFisher, 10001D), bovine calf serum (Gemini, 100-506), 293T and
NIH3T3 cells were from ATCC. Panobinostat (CAS 404950-80-7) and α-amanitin (CAS 2310905-9) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All other chemicals and reagents were
purchased from Sigma.
Cell Fractionation and Immunoprecipitation
Cell fractionation was performed using the Dignam & Roeder method with minor modifications.
293T or NIH3T3 cells were pelleted and washed in cold DPBS. Pellets were resuspended in 5
volumes of DR Buffer A (10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT,
1x HALT, 30 nM Panobinostat and 5 μM nicotinamide). Cells were Dounce homogenized with
10 strokes using a tight pestle (Wheaton), and cytoplasmic lysates were set aside or decanted.
Nuclear pellets were resuspended in DR Buffer C (20 mM HEPES, 0.42 M NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2,
0.2 mM EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mM DTT, 1x HALT, 30 nM Panobinostat and 5 μM
nicotinamide), sonicated using the Sonic Dismembrator 500 (ThermoFisher Scientific). 500 μg
of nucleoplasm was precleared with normal IgG (Santa Cruz) conjugated to the appropriate
beads, and immunoprecipitation was performed using anti HA-agarose beads (Sigma, A2095)
or antibodies bound to Dynabeads. Immunoprecipitates were eluted either by boiling in 2x
Laemmli buffer (agarose) or incubating in Elution Buffer (50 mM NaHCO3, 1% SDS) and adding
2x Laemmli buffer (Dynabeads).
Lentiviral Transduction of RPRD1B shRNAs
VSV-G pseudotyped lentiviruses were produced to contain a puromycin resistance gene and a
shRNA against RPRD1B (NM_027434.2-1003s21c1) or a scrambled control. Cells were
transduced with 0.5 mL of unconcentrated virus and selected using 2 μg/mL puromycin for 1
week prior to experimentation.
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation in NIH3T3 Cells
NIH3T3 cells were grown under normal conditions (10% BCS, 1x penicillin and streptomycin, 2
mM L-glutamine). We treated 6x107 cells with a lysine deacetylase inhibitor cocktail (30 nM
Panobinostat, 5 M nicotinamide) or a vehicle control (DMSO, water) for 2 h. Cells were fixed
with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min, thoroughly washed with DPBS, and resuspended in ChIP
lysis buffer #1 (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 1x HALT, 30 nM Panobinostat
and 5 μM nicotinamide). After sitting on ice for 10 min, cells were briefly vortexed, and the nuclei
were pelleted. Nuclei were treated with MNase (NEB, M0247S) for 25 min at RT, pelleted and
resuspended on ice in ChIP lysis buffer #2 (50 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS,
1x HALT, 30 nM Panobinostat and 5 μM nicotinamide). Chromatin was further sheared by
sonication using the Sonic Dismembrator 500 (ThermoFisher Scientific) and preserved at -80oC
until immunoprecipitation. 20–40 g of chromatin was used for each IP with the antibody
concentrations listed in Table S3. IPs were diluted into a final volume of 800 L with ChIP
Dilution buffer (167 mM NaCl, 16.7 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 1.2 mM EDTA, 1.1% Triton X-100,
0.01% SDS) and left at 4oC overnight. IPs were washed then eluted in ChIP elution buffer (50
mM NaHCO3, 1% SDS) and decrosslinked at 65oC for 16 h. Samples were treated with RNAse
A (Thermofisher, EN0531) for 20 min, and DNA was purified using the QIAquick PCR
purification kit (Qiagen, 28106). Primer sequences are available upon request. For samples that
were deep-sequenced, 2 ng of immunoprecipitated DNA from each reaction was used to create
libraries using the Ovation Ultra-Low Library prep kit (Nugen, 0344-32), following manufacturer

recommendations, and libraries were deep sequenced on the HIseq 4000 or NextSeq 500 using
single-end 50 bp or single-end 75 bp sequencing, respectively.
RNA Sequencing
RNA was prepared from 1x106 NIH3T3 cells using the QIAgen RNeasy Plus Kit. Libraries were
prepared with the Ovation Ultralow System V2 kit pn: 7102-32 / 0344-32, and libraries were
deep sequenced on NextSeq 500 using paired-end 75 pb sequencing. RNA seq analysis was
done using the Illumina RNAexpress application v 1.1.0.
ChIP-seq Data Analysis
Barcodes were removed and sequences were trimmed using Skewer (Jiang et al., 2014). For
each ChIP 50-60 million reads were aligned to the Mus musculus mm10 genome assembly
using Bowtie with the –a -l 55 -n 2 -m 1 parameter (Langmead et al., 2009). Peaks were called
and sequence pileups normalized to reads per million relative to input controls using MACS2 -B
-SPMR -g mm -no-model -slocal 1000 (Zhang et al., 2008). TSS profiling was done using
plotProfile on matrices generated with 10-bp bins using the computeMatrix function found in the
Deeptools 2.2.3 build (Ramirez et al., 2016). Reproducibility of data was assessed by principal
component analysis (Ramirez et al., 2016).
Stable Isotope Labeling of Amino Acids in Culture (SILAC) of WT and 8KR Polymerases
SILAC labeling was performed according to the manual of SILAC Protein Quantitation Kit (LysC)
–DMEM (Thermo Scientific cat. no. A33969). In brief, 293T cells stably expressing Pol-II-WT-HA
and Pol-II-8KR-HA were grown in the light medium (L-Lysine-2HCl) or heavy medium (13C6LLysine-2HCl), respectively. After growing seven doubling times in the respective medium,
incorporation efficiency of heavy L-lysine in 293T-Pol-II-8KR-HA cells was determined and the
efficiency was more than 99%. To immunoprecipitate the HA proteins, 5 mg of total cell lysate
from Pol-II-WT-HA and 5 mg of total lysate from Pol-II-8KR-HA cells in p300 lysis buffer were
mixed together (total 500 L), and 100 L of HA agarose (Roche) were added. After overnight
immunoprecipitation at 4ºC, the HA-agarose was washed 4 times with 1 mL of cold p300 lysis
buffer to remove non-specific binding proteins. The bound proteins were eluted twice by 100 L
of 0.1 M glycine, pH 2.5, after a 30-min incubation. Each elution was stored in separate tube. 10
L of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was added into each elution to neutralize the pH. The quality of the
elution was monitored by Protein Silver Staining (Pierce). Two elusions were combined and 50
L out of the 200 L combined elusions were analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). Two
independent biological repeats were performed.
MS Analysis
Samples were analyzed on a Thermo Scientific LTQ Orbitrap Elite MS system equipped with an
Easy-nLC 1000 HPLC and autosampler. Samples were injected onto a pre-column (2 cm x 100
m I.D. packed with 5 m of C18 particles) in 100% buffer A (0.1% formic acid in water) and
separated by a 120-min reverse phase gradient from 5–30% buffer B (0.1% formic acid in 100%
ACN) at a flow rate of 400 nL/min. The MS continuously collected spectra in a data-dependent
manner, acquiring a full scan in the Orbitrap (at 120,000 resolution with an automatic gain
control target of 1,000,000 and a maximum injection time of 100 ms), followed by collisioninduced dissociation spectra for the 20 most abundant ions in the ion trap (with an automatic
gain control target of 10,000, a maximum injection time of 10 ms, a normalized collision energy
of 35.0, activation Q of 0.250, isolation width of 2.0 m/z, and an activation time of 10.0). Singly
and unassigned charge states were rejected for data-dependent selection. Dynamic exclusion
was enabled to data-dependent selection of ions with a repeat count of 1, a repeat duration of

20.0 s, an exclusion duration of 20.0 s, an exclusion list size of 500, and exclusion mass width
of + or - 10.00 ppm.
Raw MS data were analyzed using the MaxQuant software package (version 1.2.5.8)
(Cox and Mann, 2008). Data were matched to the SwissProt human proteins (downloaded from
UniProt on 2/15/13, 20,259 protein sequence entries). MaxQuant was configured to generate
and search against a reverse sequence database for false discovery rate calculations. Variable
modifications were allowed for methionine oxidation and protein N-terminus acetylation. A fixed
modification was indicated for cysteine carbamidomethylation. Full trypsin specificity was
required. The first search was performed with a mass accuracy of +/- 20 parts per million, and
the main search was performed with a mass accuracy of +/- 6 parts per million. A maximum of
five modifications were allowed per peptide. A maximum of two missed cleavages were allowed.
The maximum charge allowed was 7+. Individual peptide mass tolerances were allowed. For
MS/MS matching, a mass tolerance of 0.5 Da was allowed and the top six peaks per 100 Da
were analyzed. MS/MS matching was allowed for higher charge states, water and ammonia loss
events. The data were filtered to obtain peptide, protein, and site-level false discovery rates of
0.01. The minimum peptide length was seven amino acids. Results were matched between runs
with a time window of 2 min for technical duplicates.
Isothermal Titration Calorimetry
RNA Pol II CTD peptides were purchased from Peptide 2.0 (Chantilly, VA). ITC experiments
were performed as described (Ni et al., 2014)
Molecular Modeling
Crystallographic structures were used for the dimer (pdb:4Q94) and tetramer (pdb:4Q96)
models of RPRD1B and for SCAF8 (pdb: 3D9K). Electrostatic potential surfaces were
calculated using an adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann solver (APBS) from the PDB2PQR server
using the Amber force field and PROPKA to assign protonation states (Dolinsky et al., 2004).
Amber’s LEaP program was used with the Amber ff14SB force field and the following force field
modifications: phosaa10 (phosphates), ffptm (phosphorylated serines) and ALY.frcmod
(acetyllysines). The TIP3P water model was used to solvate the system in a cubic periodic box,
such that the closest distance between any atom in the system and the periodic boundary is
10Å. Net positive charge in the box was neutralized by adding counterions (Cl-) until neutrality.
Energy minimization was performed in two steps: using harmonic restraints on the protein (10.0
kcal mol-1 Å-2) and an unrestrained minimization. For each minimization, we ran 1000 steps of
steepest descent and 1000 steps of conjugate-gradient minimization at a constant volume with
a non-bonded cutoff of 9Å. The equilibration was done in three steps. First, the system was
heated from 0 to 300K with a restrained equilibration (10.0 kcal mol-1 Å-2) for 20 ps at constant
volume with a non-bonded cutoff of 9Å, using the SHAKE algorithm to constrain bonds involving
hydrogens and the Andersen thermostat. The second round of equilibration was performed by
lowering the harmonic restraints (1.0 kcal mol-1 Å-2) on the system for 20 ps (other parameters
identical). The third round was performed for 1 ns at constant pressure of 1.0 bar with nonbonded cutoff of 9Å at 300K with the Andersen thermostat. Simulations were performed without
restraints using new velocities with random seeds at constant pressure of 1 bar with nonbonded cutoff distance of 9Å. 20-ns simulations were run with 2 fs timesteps per construct.
Coordinates and energy were saved every picosecond (500 steps) (Case et al., 2005).
Molecular graphics and analyses were performed with the UCSF Chimera package (Pettersen
et al., 2004).
