ABSTRACT

21

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene expression is coordinately regulated pre- and

22

post-transcriptionally, and its perturbation can lead to human pathologies.

23

Mitochondrial ribosomal RNAs (mt-rRNAs) undergo a series of nucleotide

24

modifications following release from polycistronic mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA)

25

precursors, which is essential for mitochondrial ribosomal biogenesis. Cytosine N4

26

methylation (m4C) at position 839 of the 12S small subunit (SSU) mt-rRNA was

27

identified decades ago, however, its biogenesis and function have not been elucidated

28

in details. Here we demonstrate that human Methyltransferase Like 15 (METTL15) is

29

responsible for 12S mt-rRNA methylation at C839 (m4C839) both in vivo and in vitro.

30

We tracked the evolutionary history of RNA m4C methyltransferases and revealed the

31

difference in substrates preference between METTL15 and its bacterial ortholog rsmH.

32

Additionally, unlike the very modest impact on ribosome upon loss of m4C

33

methylation in bacterial SSU rRNA, we found that depletion of METTL15

34

specifically causes severe defects in mitochondrial ribosome assembly, which leads to

35

an impaired translation of mitochondrial protein-coding genes and a decreased

36

mitochondrial respiration capacity. Our findings point to a co-evolution of

37

methylatransferase specificities and modification patterns in rRNA with differential

38

impact on prokaryotic ribosome versus eukaryotic mitochondrial ribosome.

INTRODUCTION

42

Mitochondrial gene expression requires a series of inter-connected processes

43

encompassing mtDNA replication and repair, mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA)

44

transcription, maturation and mitoribosome assembly (1, 2). The mt-RNAs, especially

45

rRNAs and tRNAs, are subjected to extensive enzyme-mdiated modifications, which

46

play key roles in RNA stability, RNA structure, and mitochondrial ribosome assembly

47

(3, 4). Some of these modifications are deposited co-transcriptionally or immediately

48

after transcription, while others occur when the rRNA is assembled into the

49

pre-ribosomal particle (3-5).

50

51

Prokaryotic and eukaryotic cytoplasmic rRNAs contain more than 30 and 200

52

modified sites, respectively, but only around 10 modifications are found in the

53

mitochondrial rRNAs (4, 5). These modifications are located at the functionally

54

important regions of mitoribosome, such as the decoding center (DC) of the small

55

subunit (SSU), suggesting that these modifications might be retained due to their

56

essential roles (5, 6). The best characterized example is the TFB1M-mediated

57

dimethylation on the two highly conserved sites, A936 and A937, at the 3′-end of the

58

mt 12S rRNA, which is necessary for the assembly of the SSU (7, 8). The NOP2/Sun

59

RNA Methyltransferase 4 (NSUN4) forms a complex with MTERF4 to catalyze m5C

60

methylation at the position 841 in mt-12S rRNA and to coordinate the mitoribosome

61

assembly (9, 10) However, enzymes for m4C and m5U (uracil) methylation in

62

mammalian mitochondrial rRNAs remain to be identified (6, 11).

63

Mitochondrial diseases may be caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)

64

(12), but growing evidence suggests that defects in the nuclear genes involved in

65

mitochondrial RNA modifications can also lead to human mitochondrial diseases . For

66

instance, loss of TFB1M results in mitochondrial dysfunction that leads to impaired

67

insulin secretion and diabetes (13). A missense mutation in pseudouridylate synthase 1

68

(PUS1), which converts uridine to pseudouridine at several mitochondrial tRNA

69

positions, has been reported to be associated with myopathy, lactic acidosis and

70

sideroblastic anaemia (MLASA) (14). Moreover, a defect in the mitochondrial rRNA

71

methyltransferase MRM2 that causes loss of 2’-O-methyl modification at position

72

U1369 in the human mitochondrial 16S rRNA leads to MELAS-like clinical

73

syndrome in patients (15). In addition, an 11p14.1 microdeletion was identified to be

74

highly associated with Attention-Deficit/Hyperreactive Disorder (ADHD), autism,

75

developmental delay, and obesity (16). Intriguingly, the microdeletion region always

76

encompasses a METTL-famlily protein METTL15. More recently, a trans-ancestral

77

meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies uncovered a completely novel

78

single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs10835310) at METTL15 associated with

79

childhood obesity, (17), further implicating the involvement of METTL15 in this

80

human syndrome, although the underlying molecular mechanisms for these

81

associations is still unclear.

83

In this current study, we demonstrate that human METTL15 protein, encoded by a

84

nuclear gene, is localized in mitochondria and is responsible for methylation of 12S

85

mt-RNA at C839 in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that

86

METTL15-dependent modification of 12S mt-rRNA is necessary for mitoribosome

87

maturation. Our study reveals that methylation of 12S mt-rRNA m4C839 by

88

METTL15 is an important epitranscriptome modification, critical for efficient

89

mitochondrial protein synthesis and respiratory function.

RESULTS

92

METTL15 is a mitochondrial protein associated with 12S mt-rRNA

93

METTL15 is a member of the methytransferase like (METTL) family, characterized

94

by the presence of a binding domain for S-adenosyl methionine, which is a

95

methyl-group donor for methylation reactions (18, 19). Through phylogenetic analysis,

96

we found that METTL15 is highly conserved during evolution and is an ortholog of

97

the bacterial methylatranferase, rsmH (Figure 1A), which is responsible for the

98

N4-methylation of m4Cm1402 in 16S rRNA in almost all species of bacteria

99

(Supplementary Figures S1A)(20). Given its similarity with rsmH, we wondered

100

whether METTL15 is also a m4Cm methyltransferase for rRNA. To address this

101

possibility, we purified SSU rRNA fragments containing C1402 or its equivalent

102

nucleotide from four representative species and measured the levels of m4Cm by

103

HPLC-MS/MS. We didn’t detect any meaningful levels of m4Cm in the cytoplasmic

104

SSU rRNAs from fruitfly, zebrafish or human, though a large amount of Cm was

105

readily detectable (Supplementary Figures S1B), which is consistent with previous

106

reports that the SSU rRNAs of those eukaryotic cells were abundantly modified by

107

2’-O-methylated cytosine (Supplementary Figures S1C)(21).

112

mitochondrial genome-encoded RNAs, expecially mt-12S and mt-16S rRNA, but not

113

cytoplasmic RNAs such as 18S rRNAs, are found to be associated with the HA tagged

114

METTL15 in an RNA immunoprecipitation experiment (RIP) (Figure 1B).

115

Consistently, immunofluresence experiments showed that METTL15 is exclusively

116

localized in the mitochondria, dependent on its putative mitochondria-targeting

117

signals (MTS) (Figure 1C)(22), which suggests that METTL15 is a bona fide

118

mitochondria protein that interacts with mitoribosome rRNAs.

119

120

METTL15 is responsible for methylation of 12S mt-rRNA m4C839 in vivo

121

To unambiguously identify the in vivo methylation sites modified by METTL15, we

122

profiled the mitochondrial RNA methylome in wildtype (WT) and METTL15

123

knockout (KO) cells using RNA bisulfite sequencing (RNA BS-seq), which detects

124

both m5C and m4C cytosine modifications in RNAs (23). The RNA BS-seq revealed

125

that in the absence of METTL15, the methylation level of mt-12S C839 is

126

dramatically decreased from 58% to near background level (0.9%), which suggests

127

that methylation of mt-12S C839 may be mediated by METTL15 (Figure 2A and 2B).

128

To validate the BS-seq results, we designed sequence-specific primers to amplify a

129

145 nucleotoide (nt) region surrounding C839 from bisulfite-treated RNA samples

130

and employed targeted sequencing (detailed procedure in the Methods) to examine the

131

methylation levels of C839. In agreement with the BS-seq result, methylation of C839

132

was found to almost completely disappear in the METTL15 KO cells

(Supplementary Figures S2C). Importantly, the methylation level of m4C839 can be

134

fully rescued by wild type METTL15, but not a catalytically compromised mutant

135

METTL15 (GA mutant:

136

S2C)(24), which strongly supports the hypothesis that METTL15 is responsible for

137

m4C839 on 12S mt-rRNA in vivo and is consistent with a very recent study (25).

138

Interestingly, the neighbouring methylation site, m5C841, which is catalyzed by

139

NSUN4 (9), is reduced (but not eliminated) upon METTL15 deletion. In addition, the

140

m5C841 reduction could be fully restored by reintroducing wild type METTL15 and

141

partially restored by enzymatically inactive METTL15, suggesting METTL15 might

142

regulate the installation of m5C841 by NSUN4 in both enzymatic activity-dependent

143

and independent manner (Supplementary Figure S2C).

(Supplementary Figures

144

145

Given both m4C(m) and m5C are able to block the C-to-T transition by bisulfite

146

treatment and therefore can’t be distinguished in the BS-seq analysis (23), we turned

147

to an optimized LC-MS/MS method to efficiently separate different forms of methyl

148

cytosines in order to define the exact type of methylation in C839 (Supplementary

149

Figures S2B). As shown in Figure 2C, m4C was detected in WT cell lines but

150

reduced to a background level in the METTL15 KO cells, indicating that METTL15

151

may be a m4C methyltransferase for C839. Consistent with the BS-seq data,

152

HPLC-MS/MS analysis also found a modest reduction of m5C at C841 due to

153

METTL15 depletion, which again points to a potential crosstalk between C839 and

C841 methylation. m4C methylation of C839 is mediated by the intrinsic enzymatic

155

activity of METTL15 as reintroduction of wildtype, but not the catalytically inactive

156

METLL15, back into the METTL15 KO cells restored the methylation level of

157

m4C839 (Figures 2D and Supplementary Figures S2A/C). Collectively, these

158

findings demonstrate that METTL15 is likely the enzyme responsible for methylation

159

of mt-12S m4C839 in vivo (Supplementary Figures S2D).

160

161

METTL15 methylates 12S mt-rRNA m4C839 in vitro

162

We next asked whether recombinant METTL15 mediates 12S mt-rRNA methylation

163

at C839. C-terminal FLAG-tagged METTL15 was expressed in 293T cells and

164

purified using an ANTI-FLAG M2 Affinity column (Supplementary Figures S3A).

165

Recombinant METTL15 was incubated with 12S mt-rRNA oligos (nt 832 to 846) in

166

the presence of d3-SAM (S-(5'-Adenosyl)-L-methionine-d3) as a methyl group donor,

167

and the resulting rRNAs oligos were isolated for LC/MS measurement. As shown in

168

Figure 3A, m4 methylation of C839 was successfully detected while the catalytically

169

compromised METTL15 failed to mediate C839 methylation.

170

171

As described before, a main difference between the m4C methylation site of bacterial

172

ribosome and human mitoribosome is that cytosine in bacterial ribosome is mainly

173

m4Cm while in the human mitoribosome at the equvalent cytosine residue, it’s m4C

174

without the 2’-O methylation. This prompted us to determine whether human

175

MEETTL15 (hMETTL15) displays any preference for unmodified cytosine versus

176

2’-O methylated cytosine. Consistently, unmodified cytosine in the mt-12S rRNA

177

appears to be a better substrate for hMETT15 in vitro (C vs Cm in Figure 3B). In

178

contrast, rsmH shows higher apparent activity towards Cm compared with C of mt

179

12S rRNAs (solid line in Figure 3C, Supplementary Figures S3C). Interestingly, we

180

found an aromatic amnio acid (W139) in rsmH, which has been changed into Valine

181

(V210) in the eukaryotic orthologs (METTL15), might potentially mediate the

182

interaction of 2’-O methyl group of Cm with rsmH based on the published rsmH

183

structure (Supplementary Figures S3B) (26). These results confirmed that human

184

METTL15 is a bona fide m4C methyltransferase and has a higher activity toward

185

unmodified cytosine compared with 2’-O methylated cytosine in vitro.

186

187

Depletion of METTL15 inhibits the function of mitoribosomes

188

As METTL15 is localized in mitochondria, we first investigated the effect of

189

METTL15 deletion on mtDNA copy number and transcription of mitochondrial

190

genome-encoded genes. We found METTL15 deletion only causes minor changes of

191

mtDNA copy number and transcription (Figure S4A/B). Given that the methylation

192

site lies in the critical region of mitoribosome, we asked whether loss of METTL15

193

affects the function of mitoribosome. We performed the mitochondiral ribosome

194

profiling in a 10%-30% sucrose gradient to determine whether there was any

195

difference in the assembly of mitoribosome. The distribution of SSU and LSU in the

196

sucrose gradient were detected by the presence of 12S and 16S mt-rRNA, respectively.

197

According to the protein complex density, the first peak of 12S rRNA (fraction 8)

198

represents SSU, while the first peak of 16S rRNA (fraction 9) represents LSU, and the

199

co-fractionated peaks (fractions 12 and 13) represent the mature ribosome. The

200

co-fractionation ratio of 12S and 16S mt-rRNAs in METTL15 KO cells was

201

significantly reduced (compared with factions 12-13 in wildtype cells), thus

202

identifying a major defect in mitoribosome assembly. In addition, the ratio of mRNA

203

encoded by mitochondrial genome was also significantly reduced in the 55S mature

204

monosomes (fractions 12-13), indicating compromised translation efficiency, which

205

was consistent with the observed mitoribosome assembly defects (Figure 4A and 4B).

206

Western blotting results of two representative mitochondrial protein-coding genes,

207

COX2 and ND6, showed that the levels of the protein products were also reduced

208

significantly.

209

mitochondria-encoded genes could be rescued by wild type METTL15 but not the

210

catalytic mutant (Figure S4D), suggesting the function of METTL15 on

211

mitoribosome is m4C849 dependent. These data thus demonstrate that the methylation

212

mediated by METTL15 is critical for mitoribosomes maturation and mt-mRNA

213

translation.

217

through respiration, and to regulate cellular metabolism. Most of the ATP synthesized

218

during glucose metabolism is produced in the mitochondria through oxidative

219

phosphorylation (OxPhos) powered by the Electron Transport Chain (ETC) complex,

220

which consists essentially of about 70 nuclear-encoded proteins and 13

221

mtDNA-encoded proteins translated by mitoribosome in mitochondria. To determine

222

the impact of loss of METTL15 on respiratory activity, we measured the respiratory

223

activity of METTL15 KO cells using a Seahorse XF96 analyzer. The oxygen

224

consumption rate (OCR) of the METTL15 KO cells was substantially lower than that

225

of WT cells, and this effect is dependent on the enzymatic activity, indicating that

226

METTL15 mediated m4C839 on 12S mt-rRNA is required for proper oxidative

227

phosphorylation function. (Figure 5A/B). After two days in culture, the medium of

228

METTL15 KO cells turned more yellow indicating a lower pH and more lactate

229

secretion, although the cell numbers are comparable between WT and KO, (Figure

230

S5A). Consistently, extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), which approximates

231

glycolytic activity, was significantly up-regulated in the METTL15 KO cells, likely to

232

compensate for dysfunction of the mitochondria (Figure 5C). Furthermore,

233

metabolites profiling shows a decline of citrate and alpha-ketoglutarate, the

234

intermediators of the TCA cycle, which is closely coupled with OxPhos to generate

235

ATP. It is also known that an essential function of respiration in proliferating cells is

236

to support aspartate biosynthesis (27, 28). The decline of the aspartate level in

237

METTL15 KO cell is consistent with the compromised respiration function. At the

238

same time, the upregulated level of lactate suggested that cells use more anaerobic

function and cellular metabolic homeostasis.

DISCUSSION

245

Here we describe the identification of METTL15 as the methyltransferase that

246

generates m4C839 in human 12S mt-rRNA. The phylogenetic analysis indicates that

247

METTL15 orthologs exist in most eukaryotes, which implies the importance of this

248

methyltransferase for proper functions of mitoribosome. Consistent with this

249

hypothesis, mitochondrial translation is inhibited and oxidative phosphoryaltion is

250

remarkably compromised in METTL15 KO cells, identifying an important function of

251

METTL15 in regulating mitochondria functions by methylating 12S mt-rRNA.

252

253

Crosstalk between m4C839 and m5C841 on 12S mt-rRNA

254

Ribosomal maturation involves multiple steps of subunit assembly and incorporation

255

of chemical modifications into the rRNA (3). The assembly of protein components

256

and rRNAs has been well characterized through high-resolution Cryo-EM, while the

257

process of modification deposition is still largely unclear (29). For the bacterial 16S

258

rRNA, quantitative analysis of rRNA modifications finds that the modification events

259

seem to occur in a 5′-to-3′ sequential order: from 5′ body domain, the 3′ head domain,

260

to 3′ minor domain (30). In this current study, we found that m4C839 methylation

261

appears to precede m5C841 and important for the nearby m5C841 methylation,

262

suggesting crosstalk between modifications of the two nearby residues. Furthermore,

263

the enzymatically inactive METTL15 can partially restore the m5C841 methylation

264

decreased in METTL15-null cells, raising the question of whether the crosstalk is

mediated by physical interactions between METTL15 and the m5C methyltransferase,

coordinately deposited in an orderly manner will significantly increase our

understanding of mitoribosome maturation (31).

Co-evolution of rRNA methyltransferases and rRNA fuctions

271

Unlike the universally conserved rRNA modifications (such as m6,6A) (5), the

272

N4-methylation of SSU rRNA is only maintained in prokaryotes and mitochondria of

273

eukaryotic cells. In bacteria, rsmI and rsmH (which is the bacterial METTL15

274

ortholog) install 2’-O methylation and N4-methylation, respectively, on the equivalent

275

cytosine to generate m4Cm1402 of bacterial 16S rRNAs (20). There are two notable

276

differences between methylation of human mt-rRNAs versus bacterial rRNA. First, at

277

the molecular level, our in vitro enzymatic assays showed that rsmH prefers Cm as a

278

substrate and m4C methylation at C1402 in bacteria may occur subsequent to the 2’-O

279

methylation. Interestingly, the aromatic pocket in the rsmH enzymatic domain appears

280

to have degenerated in its eukaryotic ortholog METTL15 proteins during evolution,

281

and this might be coupled with the loss of rsmI in eukaryotic organisms. Second, the

282

m4C methylation is essential for the mitoribosome assembly and maturation, while in

283

contrast, m4Cm loss in bacteria only generates a rather modest phenotype (20). These

284

findings suggest that m4C appears to have gained importance in regulating

285

mitochrondrial functions during evolution.

METTL15 and human diseases

287

Previous studies demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunctions in mature adipocytes

288

cause defects in fatty acid oxidation, secretion of adipokines, and dysregulation of

289

glucose homeostasis (32). Importantly, a reduction in the oxidative capacity of brown

290

adipocytes results in impaired thermogenesis, and has been linked to diet-induced

291

obesity (33). In this context, it's important to note that microdeletion and SNPs in

292

METTL15 gene are highly associated with obesity (16, 17). Therefore, we speculate

293

that if altered METTL15 activity impacst obesity onset, it's likely to be due to the

294

ability of METTL5 to regulate mitochondrial functions by methylating 12S mt-rRNA.

295

In summary, we identify METTL15 as a m4C methyltransferase that specifically

296

mediates m4C methylation of 12S mt-rRNA at residue C839. Interestingly, our

297

HPLC-MS/MS and enzymological analyses reveal a methylation pattern shift during

298

evolution, which is likely a consequence of degeneration of an ancestral aromatic

299

pocket present only in bacterial METTL15 orthologs, which recognizes 2’-O-methyl

300

cytosine. This pocket is absent in eukaryotic METTL15, which is probably why

301

human METTL15 prefers C839 but not Cm839. Importantly, METTL15 depletion

302

affects mitoribosome assembly, inhibits translation of mitochondria encoded proteins,

303

and compromises the oxidative phosphorylation, which underlies the importance of

304

METTL15 in maintaining mitochondrial functions. Future experiments will determine

305

whether METTL15 plays a role in human diseases such as obesity through its ability

306

to mediate methylation of mitochondrial rRNA.

Generation of METTL15 knockout cell lines

327

The CRISPR-Cas9 targeting system was utilized as previously described (34). The

328

guide RNA sequence is METTL15 KO: 5’-TTGAGATCTGTGTAACTCCT-3’,

329

targeting exon 3 of the NCBI METTL15 reference sequence NM_001113528.

330

331

RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP)

332

A total of 5 million METTL15-HA stable cells were crosslinked with 1%

333

formaldehyde and then harvested and lyzed in 3 volumes of lysis buffer (50 mM

334

Tris-Cl [pH 7.5], 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.25 % NP-40 with protease inhibitor)

335

on ice for 15 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, the

336

supernatant was used for IP. For each RIP reaction, 5 million cells and 10 μl HA beads

337

were used. After washing, the precipitated RNA samples were extracted by TRIzol

338

directly and reverse transcribed, followed by qPCR detection.

339

incubated with HisPur Ni-NTA Resin at 4 degree for 5 hours. His-rsmH protein was

347

eluted with elution buffer (20 mM Tris pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 200mM Imidazole) in

348

0.5 ml aliquots until color change was no longer observed (Bradford assay).

349

350

Sucrose gradient sedimentation

351

Sucrose gradient sedimentation was performed as previously described with minor

352

modifications (35). For each sample, around 1 mg mitochondria protein lysate was

353

used, and the lysates were loaded on a 10 ml 10 % – 30 % uncontinuous sucrose

354

gradient (50 mM Tris-Cl, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2) and centrifuged at 32,000

355

rpm for 130 mins in a Beckman SW60-Ti rotor. A total of 16 fractions were collected

356

from the top and used for RT-qPCR analyses.

357

358

Seahorse assay

359

An XF96 extracellular flux analyzer (seahorse bioscience) was used to determine the

360

oxygen consumption rate(OCR) between WT and METTL15 KO cells, which were

361

seeded at 15,000 cells per well. The concentrations of oligomycin, FCCP, rotenone

362

and antimycin A are 1 μM, 1.5 μM, 0.5 μM and 0.5 μM, respectively.

Isolation of a defined rRNA fragment

366

To isolate the corresponding fragments of 12S rRNA containing known modified

367

residues, we refer to the method as previously described (36) with minor

368

modifications.

369

oligodeoxynucleotide probe and 100 μg of total RNA for one experiment and the

370

sequences of the probes are listed in the supplementary table. After annealing and

371

digestion with mung bean nuclease (NEB) and RNase A , the duplex of the probe and

372

corresponding RNA fragment is purified with streptavidin C1.

Briefly,

Processing of RNA samples for mass spectrometry

375

The RNA sample is digested with 0.5U of Nuclease P1 (Sigma) in 80 μl NP1 buffer at

376

42℃ for 2 hours. To dephosphorylate the single nucleotides, 1U of CIP (NEB) is

377

added and incubated for an hour at 37℃. The samples are filtered with Millex-GV

378

0.22 μm filters before loaded onto the column of mass spec machine.5 μl of solution

379

was loaded into LC–MS/ MS (Agilent6410 QQQ triple-quadrupole mass

380

spectrometer). Nucleosides were quantified by using retention time and nucleoside to

381

base ion mass transitions of 244 to 112 (C), 258 to 126 (m4C and m5C), 258 to 112

Bisulfite mapping of mC residues in mitochondrial RNA

386

For purified mitochondria, mitochondrial RNA for bisulfite treatment was isolated

387

with TRIzol and treated with TURBO DNase (Ambion) to remove mitochondrial

388

DNA. Bisulfite treatment was performed with the EZ RNA methylation kit (Zymo

389

research). Half of the treated RNA was used for bisulfite RNA-seq library preparation

390

with NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (NEB), according to the

391

manufacturers instructions. For the targeted bisulfite analysis, the bisulfite-treated

392

RNA was directly converted to cDNA using PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit(Takara Bio,

393

Inc.), followed by PCR amplification using primers specific for the region

394

surrounding C839 of 12S mt-rRNA. The PCR products were separated from

395

unincorporated primers using low melting agarose and submitted for Amplicon-EZ

396

sequencing (Genewiz).

397

398

BS RNA-seq was carried out on Illumina NextSeq platform with single-end 75 bp

399

read length. Raw reads were stripped of adaptor sequences and removed of low

400

quality bases using Cutadapt. The processed reads were aligned to human

401

mitochondrial genome with meRanT align(meRanTK, version 1.2.0) and the

402

methylation ratio was calculated by meRanCall (meRanTK, version 1.2.0)(37).

cDNA obtained from bisulfite treated RNA from control (A) and METTL15 KO (B)

533

cells.

534

(C) LC-MS/MS chromatograms of C, m4C, and m5C in the corresponding 12S rRNA

535

fragments purified from total RNA. Samples from Ctrl, METTL15 KO cells were

536

analyzed.

537

(D) The m4C methylation is readily restored by re-expression of WT METTL15 but

538

not the catalytic mutant.

Figure S2 (A) The mutation in the catalytic activity of METTL15 doesn't affect its

541

mitochondrial localization.

542

(B) LC-MS/MS chromatograms of C, m4C, and m5C standard.

543

(C) Targeted BSP sequencing shows that METTL15 KO induces a dramatic reduction

544

of m4C839 and m5C841 methylation, which is readily rescued by wild-type

545

METTL15. In contrast, m4C839 can not be restored by the catalytic mutant of

546

METTL15 at all while m5C841is partially restored.

547

(D) The secondary structure of human SSU mt-rRNA 3’ terminus and the localization

548

of m4C and m5C.

mitochondrial 12S rRNA in vitro.

552

(A) In vitro methylation assay indicates that recombinant wild-type, but not catalytic

553

mutant METTL15, is able to deposit a methyl group onto the N4-position of C839 in

554

12S mt-rRNA.

555

(B) Human METTL15 prefers RNA oligos with unmodified C839.

556

(C) Bacterail rsmH methylatransferase shows stronger activtiy toward 2’-O

557

methylated subsrates.

560

Blue staining(left) and Western blotting (right).

561

(B) Analysis of the crystal structure of rsmH shows that rsmH has a aromatic pocket

562

that might be involved in recognizing 2’-O methylation of 2’-O-methylcytidine. Note:

563

cytidine was used in the original co-crystal structure. The dash circle indicates the

564

predicted position of 2’-O methyl group when rsmH uses 2’-O-methylcytidine as

565

substrate.
