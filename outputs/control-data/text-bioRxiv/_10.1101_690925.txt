We engineered electrochromic fluorescence resonance energy transfer (eFRET) genetically
encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) with “positive-going” fluorescence response to membrane
depolarization through rational manipulation of the native proton transport pathway in
microbial rhodopsins. We transformed the state-of-the-art eFRET GEVI Voltron into Positron,
with kinetics and sensitivity equivalent to Voltron but flipped fluorescence signal polarity. We
further applied this general approach to GEVIs containing different voltage sensitive rhodopsin
domains and various fluorescent dye and fluorescent protein reporters.
Genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) allow visualization of fast action potentials and
subthreshold dynamics in groups of genetically defined neurons with high spatiotemporal
resolution1,2. Monitoring voltage signals in vivo in large populations of neurons will enable
dissection of detailed mechanistic links between brain activity and animal behavior. Despite
recent advances, no current GEVI has ideal properties for routine, robust in vivo imaging.
Knowledge of the mechanistic function of GEVIs will lead to improved designs. Existing GEVIs use
voltage sensitive protein domains from voltage sensitive ion channels or phosphatases3–7 (VSD
GEVIs), or microbial rhodopsin domains8–14 (rhodopsin GEVIs). Archaerhodopsin 3 (Arch)
from Halorubrum sodomense was the first rhodopsin GEVI that accurately tracked changes in
neuronal membrane potential8. However, Arch also generated a hyperpolarizing light-driven
current upon exposure to imaging light8,15 by functioning as an outward proton pump15. A single
amino acid substitution (D95N) in Arch abolished light-driven currents and retained Arch voltagedependent fluorescence change8. The equivalent mutation in Ace112, Ace212,14, and Mac13
rhodopsins was used to generate later GEVIs.

The rhodopsin GEVI optical signal is fast and linear8, two desirable features for a voltage indicator.
However, rhodopsin fluorescence is very dim, requiring intense illumination for imaging8. Fusions
of fluorescent protein (FP) domains or other bright fluorophores to rhodopsin GEVIs were
therefore made to facilitate imaging11,13,14. These fusions enable voltage-sensitive electrochromic
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (eFRET) from a bright fluorophore to the retinal cofactor
within the rhodopsin, which acts as a dark quencher. While the absorbance of the retinal cofactor
increases with increasing membrane potential, the emission of the eFRET-coupled fluorophore
consequently decreases. All reported eFRET GEVIs therefore have negatively sloped
fluorescence-voltage relationships; they are brighter at resting membrane potential and become
dimmer during an action potential (negative-going). Probes with positively sloped fluorescencevoltage relationships (positive-going) are expected to exhibit higher signal-to-noise ratios due to
lower background fluorescence. Although two VSD GEVIs, FlicR4 and Marina16, exhibit positivegoing signals in neurons, they have significantly slower response kinetics than eFRET GEVIs,
making detection of action potentials difficult. Here, we present a general approach to engineer
eFRET GEVIs with fast, bright, and positive-going fluorescence signals in response to neuronal
action potentials by modification of the natural proton transport pathway within microbial
rhodopsins.
Previous work fused the Ace2 rhodopsin from Acetabularia acetabulum17 to the FP mNeonGreen
to produce a negative-going eFRET GEVI that allowed in vivo imaging of voltage signals in several
model organisms12. We recently used the same Ace2 rhodopsin to engineer a negative-going
chemigenetic eFRET GEVI called Voltron, which uses a HaloTag protein domain to covalently bind
bright and photostable small molecule flurophores18,19, extending the duration and number
neurons imaged simultaneously in vivo14. In both of these GEVIs, photocurrent of Ace2 rhodopsin
(Fig. 1a) is blocked by mutating the residue that normally functions as the proton acceptor (PA)20
(D81N) (Fig. 1a,b), analogous to the Arch D95N mutation described above. This mutation blocks
the primary pathway for exchange of protons from the retinal Schiff base, which links retinal to
the rhodopsin protein, to outside the cell20. Electrophysiology measurements showing transient
inward photocurrents with Ace2 D81N (Fig. 1c) and other rhodopsin based GEVIs21 suggest that

voltage sensitivity in Ace2 D81N and other eFRET GEVIs results from membrane potential
changes altering the equilibrium of protonation between the retinal Schiff base, the proton donor
(PD) residue20, and the cell cytoplasm (Fig 1a,b).
We hypothesized that we could alter the local electrochemical potential of protons on the retinal
Schiff base and instead establish a protonation equilibrium with the outside of the cell, which
would cause the rhodopsin absorbance and eFRET fluorescence to exhibit the opposite response
to membrane potential change. Blocking access of protons to the retinal Schiff base from the cell
cytoplasm should enable preferential exchange of protons with the outside of the cell. This
hypothesis is supported by a recent report that describes a natural light-driven inward proton
pump showing the capacity of microbial rhodopsins to accept protons from outside the cell22. To
block access of protons from the cytoplasmic side, we substituted the amino acid at the PD
position of Voltron for a neutral residue (D92N). As expected, this substitution led to a block of
the transient inward photocurrent of Voltron (Fig 1d). Importantly, Voltron D92N (as well as other
substitutions to neutral residues at the PD position (Supplementary Fig. 1)) showed a positivegoing fluorescence signal with membrane depolarization, but with slow kinetics that made it
incapable of following neuronal action potentials (Fig 1d).
We reasoned that the proton pathway between the retinal Schiff base of Voltron D92N and the
exterior of the cell was inefficient, resulting in the observed slow kinetics. To improve the
efficiency of proton movement towards the outside of the cell, we substituted the amino acid at
the PA position for a negatively charged aspartate (N81D), as was present in the original Ace2
rhodopsin sequence. This resulted in an indicator (Voltron N81D D92N) that had sufficient
response speed to track action potentials in neurons (Fig. 1e). Critically, Voltron N81D D92N
exhibited no steady-state photocurrent (Fig. 1e), showing that it can function as a GEVI without
pumping protons across the membrane. Voltron N81D D92N had a transient outward
photocurrent (Fig. 1e), confirming that the Schiff base proton was now in equilibrium with the
outside of the cell. Although Voltron N81D D92N was suitable for monitoring neuronal action

potentials with positive-going fluorescence changes, it showed only ~40% of the fluorescence
change of the negative-going Voltron (Fig. 1e, g).
To improve the sensitivity of Voltron N81D D92N we focused on the rest of the proton transport
pathway of the Ace2 rhodopsin. We reasoned that proton release (PR) residues20 near the
outside of the cell should play a critical role in proton movement towards the cell exterior and
possibly modulate the protonation equilibrium of the retinal Schiff base. Saturation mutagenesis
of the two PR sites (positions 189 and 199 in Ace2) led to a variant with the substitution E199V
that had ~2 fold improved dynamic range over Voltron N81D D92N (Fig. 1f,g and Supplementary
Fig. 2). We decided to name Voltron N81D D92N E199V “Positron” due to its positive-going
response to membrane depolarization. Compared with Voltron, Positron bound to the
fluorescent dye JF525 had similar fluorescence response to voltage steps, but with a positive
fluorescence-voltage slope (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 3). With sub-millisecond on and off
time constants (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 1), Positron clearly reported
action potentials in neurons (Fig. 1f) with sensitivity equivalent to that of Voltron. We observed
that Positron was 41% dimmer than Voltron at resting membrane potential in neurons (Fig. 1h),
consistent with the hypothesis that at rest, the retinal Schiff base of Positron is more protonated
and has a higher absorption, resulting in more eFRET and less dye fluorescence emission. When
the membrane depolarizes, the proton is driven toward the outside of the cell, resulting in lower
retinal absorption, less quenching of dye fluorescence, and a positive-going fluorescence
response (Fig. 1i).
We previously showed that Voltron was suitable for imaging voltage signals in the brains of live
animals such as fruit flies, zebrafish, and mice14. To confirm that Positron allows for in vivo
imaging, we recorded optical voltage signals from five neurons simultaneously in the forebrain
of a larval zebrafish expressing Positron and labeled with JF525 using a widefield fluorescence
microscope (Fig. 1j). We observed independent spiking and subthreshold signals in each of the
neurons (Fig. 1j) with fluorescence changes and signal-to-noise comparable to those observed
with Voltron imaged similarly in the same preparation (compare Fig. 1j with Fig. S34 of ref. 14).

To demonstrate the generality of our approach to generate eFRET GEVIs with positive-going
fluorescence response, we explored different reporter fluorophores and rhodopsin domains.
Positron showed sensitive fluorescence response when labeled with a yellow dye (JF525) or a red
dye (JF585) (Fig. 2a). We also showed that the HaloTag could be exchanged for either green or red
FP domains (Fig. 2b). We created positive-going versions of the Ace2N-mNeon12 and VARNAM23
eFRET GEVIs capable of sensitively reporting action potentials in neurons with positive-going
signals (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6). Next, we substituted the rhodopsin domain
with Ace1, Mac, and Arch rhodopsins bearing mutations analogous to the three mutations we
introduced to create Positron (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Figs. 7-12). Despite only low amino acid
sequence identity (27-54%) between these rhodopsins (Supplementary Fig. 10), each of these
permutations resulted in a GEVI with positive-going fluorescence changes capable of following
action potentials when we patched neurons in culture and injected current (Fig. 2c and
Supplementary Fig. 12). Importantly, all three rhodopsins bearing mutations analogous to
Positron showed no steady-state photocurrent (Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12).
Positron is the first eFRET GEVI to run in reverse, having lower fluorescence at resting membrane
potentials, positive-going signals in response to action potentials, and sensitivity equal to that of
state-of-the-art eFRET GEVIs. We achieved this by rational mutation of the PD, PA, and PR sites
within the characterized proton transport pathway of microbial rhodopsins and found that the
effect of these substitutions can be generalized to other rhodopsins. This work provides further
mechanistic insight into the class of rhodopsin eFRET GEVIs and has potential advantages for
lower resting fluorescence background and improved signal detectability in densely labeled
samples.

The genes for Ace2 and HaloTag were amplified from a Voltron plasmid1. The genes for Ace1,
MacQ, QuasAr3, mNeonGreen, mRuby3 were synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies) with
mammalian codon optimization2–6. Rhodopsin and fluorescence reporter genes were combined
using overlap PCR. Cloning was done by restriction enzyme digest of plasmid backbones, PCR
amplification of inserted genes, isothermal assembly, and followed by Sanger sequencing to
verify DNA sequences. A soma localization tag7,8 (ST) was added using overlap PCR to make soma
targeted versions of indicators (e.g. Positron-ST). For expression in primary neuron cultures,
sensors were cloned into a pcDNA3.1-CAG plasmid (Invitrogen). For expression in zebrafish,
Positron-ST was cloned into the pTol2-HuC vector (for pan-neuronal expression) and into the pT2Tbait-UAS vector (for Gal4-dependent expression). The DNA and amino acid sequences of

HEK 293 cell culture
Spiking HEK 293 cells9 that stably express NaV1.3 and Kir2.1 were used to test the fluorescence
response of some Positron mutants using field stimulation. Cells were grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2, in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, Geneticin (Invitrogen,
10131-027), Penicillin/Streptomycin (Invitrogen, 15140-122), and Puromycin (Invitrogen,
A11138-03). All the transfections and assays were done in cells between passage 5 and 15.
Plasmids were transfected using calcium phosphate. After transfection, spiking HEK cells were
plated on glass-bottom 24-well plates (MaTeK) and cultured for 24 hours before imaging. To label
HaloTag-containing constructs, cells were incubated with 100 nM JF-dye HaloTag ligand for 30
minutes.
Primary neuron cell culture
All procedures involving animals were conducted in accordance with protocols approved by the

indicators by electroporation (Lonza, P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector X kit) according to the
manufacturer’s instruction. After transfection, hippocampal neurons were plated onto 24 well

mTagBFP210 to the C-terminus of Positron and Voltron to make pCAG-Positron-mTagBFP2 and
pCAG-Voltron-mTagBFP2 plasmids. Fluorescence images were acquired from 10 different wells
across three independent transfections for each construct in primary hippocampal neurons. To
label Voltron-mTagBFP2 and Positron-mTagBFP2 expressing neurons, cultures were incubated
with 100 nM JF525 HaloTag ligand for 25 minutes, then washed twice with imaging buffer,
incubating the cells for 5 minutes during the second wash. An EBFP2 filter set (405/20 nm
(excitation), 460/50 nm (emission), and a 425LP dichroic mirror (49021; Chroma)) was used to
image the TagBFP2 channel, and a custom filter set (510/25 nm (excitation), 545/40 nm
(emission), and a 525LP dichroic mirror (Chroma)) was used to image the JF525 channel in VoltronmTagBFP2 and Positron-mTagBF2 constructs. The ratio of the TagBFP2 channel and JF525 channel
was calculated using ImageJ software.
Field stimulation in spiking HEK cells or primary neuron culture
A stimulus isolator (A385, World Precision Instruments) with platinum wires was used to deliver
field stimuli (50V, 1 ms) to elicit HEK cell spiking or action potentials in cultured neurons as
described previously11. The stimulation was controlled using Wavesurfer and timing was
synchronized with fluorescence acquisition using Wavesurfer and a National Instruments PCIe6353 board.

Electrophysiology in primary neuron culture
Filamented glass micropipettes (Sutter Instruments) were pulled to a tip resistance of 4 – 6 MW.
Pipettes were positioned with a MPC200 manipulator (Sutter Instruments). Whole cell voltage
clamp and current clamp recordings were acquired using an EPC800 amplifier (HEKA), filtered at
10 kHz with the internal Bessel filter, and digitized using a National Instruments PCIe-6353
acquisition board at 20 kHz. Data were acquired from cells with access resistance < 25 MW.
WaveSurfer software was used to generate the various analog and digital waveforms to control
the amplifier, camera, light source, and record voltage and current traces.
All electrophysiology measurements were performed in imaging buffer: 145 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 10
glucose, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, adjusted to 310 mOsm with sucrose. Internal solution
for current clamp recordings contained the following (in mM): 130 potassium methanesulfonate,
10 HEPES, 5 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 Mg-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP, 14 Tris-phosphocreatine, adjusted to pH 7.3
with KOH, and adjusted to 300 mOsm with sucrose. For current-clamp recordings to generate
action potentials, current was injected (20 – 200 pA for 1-2 s) and voltage was monitored.
For fluorescence step responses of Positron to voltage clamp measurements, 500 nM TTX was
added to the imaging buffer to block sodium channels. Synaptic blockers (10 μM CNQX, 10 μM
CPP, 10 μM GABAZINE, and 1 mM MCPG) were added to block ionotropic glutamate, GABA, and
metabotropic glutamate receptors11. Internal solution for fluorescence step responses of
Positron to voltage clamp recordings contained the following (in mM): 115 cesium
methanesulfonate, 10 HEPES, 5 NaF, 10 EGTA, 15 CsCl, 3.5 Mg-ATP, 3 QX-314, adjusted to pH 7.3
with CsOH, and adjusted to 300 mOsm with sucrose.
For fluorescence voltage curves, cells were held at a potential of –70 mV at the start of each
recording and then 1 second voltage steps were applied to step the potential from –110 mV to
+50 mV in 20 mV increments. Fluorescence images were acquired at 400 Hz using the same
microscope described in the “Microscopy” section above. For determining response speed of
indicators, fluorescence images were acquired at 3200 Hz in response to a 100 mV potential step

delivered to voltage clamped neurons (from -70 mV to +30 mV). Traces were fit to a double
exponential function using MATLAB. All recordings were done at room temperature.
Photocurrent measurements
Photocurrents were recorded at room temperature in voltage-clamp mode with a holding
potential of −70 mV in response to 1s light pulses. Photocurrents were recorded using an EPC800
amplifier (HEKA), filtered at 10 kHz with an internal Bessel filter, and digitized using a National
Instruments PCIe-6353 acquisition board at 20 kHz controlled using WaveSurfer. Light was
delivered to the clamped neurons using the same microscope described above. Irradiance at the
imaging plane was set to 70 mW/mm2 determined with a microscope slide power sensor (S170C,
Thorlabs).
Imaging in zebrafish
In vivo wide-field voltage imaging in zebrafish was performed using the procedure described
previously (ref. 1). Briefly, the Positron-ST indicator was transiently expressed by the injection of
pT2-Tbait-UAS-Positron-ST (25 ng/μl DNA with 25 ng/μl Tol2 transposase mRNA in E3 medium)
in Tg(elavl3:Gal4-VP16) at 1-2 cell stage. JF525 was loaded to the injected fish at three day postfertilization (dpf) by incubation in 3 μM JF525 system water solution for 2 hours. The fish with
sparsely labeled forebrain neurons were paralyzed by a-bungarotoxin (1 mg/ml) and mounted in
low-melting point agarose. Spontaneous activity of forebrain neurons was imaged using a custom
wide-field microscope equipped with a 60x 1.0 NA water immersion objective lens (MRD07620,
Nikon), a LED light source (CBT-90-W, Luminous) and a TRITC filter set (TRITC-B-000, Semrock).
The images were acquired with sCMOS camera (pco.edge 4.2, PCO) at 400 Hz for 1-2 min.
Irradiance at the imaging plane was 28 mW/mm2 (S170C, Thorlabs).
