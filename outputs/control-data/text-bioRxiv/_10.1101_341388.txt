Abstract

15

Objectives: To test the hypothesis that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the left

16

dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) influences performance in a 20-min time-trial self-paced

17

exercise and electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillatory brain activity in a group of trained male

18

cyclists.

19

Design: The study consisted of a pre-registered (https://osf.io/rf95j/), randomised, sham-controlled,

20

single-blind, within-subject design experiment.

21

Methods: 36 trained male cyclists, age 27 (6.8) years, weight 70.1 (9.5) Kg; VO2max: 54 (6.13) ml.min-

22

1

23

three separate sessions, corresponding to three stimulation conditions: anodal, cathodal and sham.

24

tDCS was administered before each test during 20-min at a current intensity of 2.0 mA. The anode

25

electrode was placed over the DLPFC and the cathode in the contralateral shoulder. In each session,

26

power output, heart rate, sRPE and EEG (at baseline and during exercise) was measured.

27

Results: There were no differences (F = 0.31, p > 0.05) in power output between the stimulation

28

conditions: anodal (235 W [95%CI 222 - 249 W]; cathodal (235 W [95%CI 222 - 248 W] and sham

29

(234 W [95%CI 220 - 248 W]. Neither heart rate, sRPE nor EEG activity were affected by tDCS (all

30

Ps > 0.05).

31

Conclusion: tDCS over the left DLFC did not affect self-paced exercise performance in trained

32

cyclists. Moreover, tDCS did not elicit any change on oscillatory brain activity either at baseline or

33

during exercise. Our data suggest that the effects of tDCS on endurance performance should be taken

34

with caution.

Introduction

39

Self-paced exercise refers to a physical activity in which the effort needs to be evenly distributed and

40

monitored in order to complete the task without reaching premature exhaustion [1]. Performance in

41

self-paced exercise is undoubtedly related to the functioning of peripheral body systems, such as the

42

muscles, heart, lungs etc., as well as the brain. In this respect, self-pacing during exercise is a

43

challenging cognitive task [2], as it requires constant control and monitoring of internal (e.g., heart

44

rate) and external inputs (e.g., a bump on the road while cycling), while maintaining the goals of the

45

task (e.g. completing a set distance as fast as possible). In other words, self-paced exercise can be

46

regarded as an executive task, with high demands of self-control, goal-monitoring and inhibition [2].

47

Research in cognitive neuroscience has long pointed to the prefrontal cortex as a key brain area

48

involved in executive processing [3]. Interestingly, the few neuroimaging studies testing participants

49

while exercising have shown activation of the prefrontal cortex, together with the expected sensory-

50

motor recruitment [4,5], which reinforces the hypothesis of the crucial role of executive processing on

51

self-paced exercise. It has been proposed that the prefrontal cortex acts as a control structure by

52

integrating central and peripheral information during exercise, exerting top-down control. The

53

prefrontal cortex would be responsible for merging afferent signals together with inputs provided by

54

the anterior cingulate cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex [6], which has been related to motivational

55

and emotional processing. Therefore, the rationale of the present study was that anodal stimulation of

56

the prefrontal cortex via transcranial direct current would improve self-paced exercise performance,

57

supporting previous evidence (see below).

58

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive electrical brain stimulation technique

59

that is able to induce cortical changes by depolarizing (anodal) or hyperpolarizing (cathodal) a

60

neuron’s resting membrane potential [7]. Recently, there have been an increasing interest in the use of

61

tDCS to enhance endurance performance [8–10]. For example, Angius et al. [9] and Vitor-Costa et al.

62

[10] found an increased time to exhaustion in a cycling test after acute stimulation of the primary

63

motor cortex (M1). Angius et al. [9] attributed that performance enhancement to a reduction of the

64

perceived effort (RPE), although Vitor-Costa et al. [10] did not find such a reduction perceived

65

exertion. These apparently contradictory results leave open the question of whether tDCS affects

66

people’s RPE when stimulating the motor cortex. Meanwhile, Okano et al. [11] found improved

67

cycling performance (greater peak power output) in the anodal condition than in the sham condition

68

after stimulating the temporal cortex of ten trained cyclists. The authors argued that their anodal

69

condition might have influenced activity in the insular cortex, which has been linked to autonomic

70

regulation and to self-perception and awareness of body sensations [12]. Most of research on the effect

71

of tDCS on endurance performance has hitherto been focused on activation or inhibition of the motor

72

and temporal cortices.

73

To the best of our knowledge, only two studies have targeted the prefrontal cortex. Lattari et al. [13]

74

found increased exercise tolerance in a time to exhaustion at 100% of the peak power after stimulating

75

the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 20-min in eleven physically active women. This improvement

76

was not accompanied by a reduction in the RPE. Meanwhile, Borducchi et al. [14] found an

77

improvement in cognitive performance and mood in elite athletes of different sport modalities (n = 10)

78

after ten days of anodal stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which, according the

79

authors, may contribute to performance gains, greater well-being and faster recovery. However, due to

80

the lack of a control condition (Borducchi et al.) and small sample sizes in their studies (like in almost

81

every previous study on tDCS and sport performance), the above results should be considered with

82

caution.

83

The present (pre-registered, https://osf.io/rf95j/) research is novel as it is the first to directly test the

84

hypothesis that stimulation of the prefrontal cortex would affect performance in a 20-min time-trial

85

self-paced exercise bout in trained male cyclists. More precisely, we expected that activation via

86

anodal stimulation would improve performance, whilst inhibition of the prefrontal cortex via cathodal

87

stimulation would impair performance (compared to a sham condition). The indexes of physical

88

performance were the power output during exercise and the RPE after the self-paced exercise.

89

Additionally, we asked participants to perform an executive task [15] after the exercise. The purpose

90

was to test the hypothesis that any change on physical performance produced by the tDCS over the

91

prefrontal cortex would modulate the subsequent (known [16]) effect of exercise on inhibitory control.

92

This is in line with the idea of a bi-directional relationship between exercise, brain and cognition [16],

93

i.e., brain and cognitive functioning influences exercise performance and vice versa. Brain electrical

94

activity was measured at rest, during exercise, and during the cognitive task by recording

95

electroencephalography (EEG) in order to examine the effects of tDCS at brain level. Even though the

96

literature over the effect of tDCS on EEG is scarce and inconclusive [17], we anticipated an increase

97

in the alpha and beta band after stimulation in the anodal condition compared to cathodal and sham

98

condition.

Methods

100

Following institutional ethical approved by the University of Granada Ethics Committee

101

(287/CEIH/2017), a randomized, sham-controlled, single-blind, within-subject experimental design

102

was conducted on male trained cyclists and triathletes with a reported weekly training of more than

103

7h/week. All experimental procedures were designed to comply with the Declaration of Helsinki.

104

Before being recruited, participants provided written informed consent having previously read a

105

participant information sheet. All data were entered in a case report form, and subsequently in a

106

computerized database and stored at the Mind, Brain and Behaviour Research Centre (MBBRC) of the

107

University of Granada. Exclusion criteria was the presence of symptomatic cardiomyopathy,

108

metabolic disorders such as obesity (BMI >30) or diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,

109

epilepsy, therapy with b-blockers and medications that would alter cardiovascular function, hormonal

110

therapy, smoking, and neurological disorders, as well as the presence of implanted metal devices (e.g.,

111

pacemakers, metal plates, wires).

112

The method and planned analyses of this study were pre-registered on the Open Science Framework.

113

This was done on June 29, 2017, and can be found at https://osf.io/rf95j/.

114

Additionally, we considered that a medium effect would be appropriate in terms of the potential future

115

practical application of the findings from this type of research to elite cyclists. Therefore, according to

116

the G*Power software [18], 36 participants were required for a power of .8 and a medium effect size,

117

(partial eta-squared 𝜂 = .13) for a 3 conditions (anodal, cathodal, sham) design. During the data

118

collection, two of the participants could not complete the three experimental sessions and were

119

replaced by two other participants. Accordingly, data collection stopped when complete datasets

120

(successful completion of all three condition) were obtained for 36 endurance trained cyclists and

121

triathletes. The physiological characteristics of the participants are (mean and SD): age = 27 (6.8)

122

years, weight = 70.1 (9.5) Kg; VO = 54 (6.13) ml.min .kg and Maximal Power Output: 4.77 (.6)

123

W/kg

124

Participants visited the MBBRC four times (one screening visit and three experimental sessions).

125

Participants initially attended the MBBRC for a screening visit. After verifying that the participants

126

met the inclusion criteria, they performed a maximal incremental exercise test in order to identify their

127

maximal oxygen consumption using a standard laboratory protocol [19]. After completing the

128

maximal incremental test, participants performed a 10-min time-trial self-paced exercise test in order

129

to familiarise themselves with the protocol to be used in subsequent visits. The shorter duration of the

130

familiarization test (with respect to the proper experimental self-paced exercise) was motivated for the

131

following reasons: 1) our participants were experienced cyclists used to performing self-paced

132

exercise during training and competitions (at high intensity and even for longer durations than that of

133

the experimental self-paced test); 2) most of the participants had already enrolled on previous studies

134

from our lab in which we also used the same test; 3) we were aware that the 10-min test was

135

performed after the maximal incremental exercise test and participants were already fatigued.

136

After the screening visit, participants attended the lab on three separate occasions to perform the 20-

137

min time-trial acute self-paced exercise (all procedures were the same, except for the stimulation

138

condition). Participants were asked to refrain from drinking alcohol (48 h abstinence) and caffeine (24

139

h abstinence) and instructed not to perform any exhaustive exercise in the 48 h before each

140

experimental session. Participants were also asked to keep their pre-exercise meal the same for every

141

session. The experimental sessions were completed at the same time of the day to avoid diurnal

142

variations. EEG was recorded throughout the session, except for the stimulation period. Before the

143

beginning of the stimulation, we recorded 5-min EEG with open-eyes as a baseline measure. After the

144

baseline measure, we delivered 20-min of tDCS stimulation: anodal, cathodal or sham. The order of

145

presentation of the three experimental conditions was counterbalanced across participants to control

146

for a potential learning effect. Next, we repeated the 5-min baseline EEG measure with open-eyes.

147

After that, participants performed the 20-min self-paced exercise preceded by 5-min warm-up (at 120

148

watts) on the cycle ergometer (SRM, Julich, Germany). During the data collection, the SRM broke and

149

we had to replace it for a Phantom 5 ergometer (CyleOps, Madison, USA). The Phantom 5 measure

150

the power output using an on-board power meter PowerTap (PowerTap, Madison, USA) with power

151

accuracy of +/- 1.5%. Every participant completed the time-trial self-paced exercise on the same

152

ergometer: seventeen participants completed the trial on the SRM and nineteen on the Phantom 5.

153

Participants were instructed to achieve the highest average power possible during time-trial self-paced

154

exercise and were freely able to change gearing and cadence throughout. Participants were aware of

155

the elapsed time, but they did not have feedback on performance (wattage and heart rate) during, or

156

after the self-paced exercise. Heart rate was measured continuously throughout the protocol (V800,

157

Polar Electro, Finland). Immediately after exercise, we asked the participant to rate their session RPE

158

(sRPE) [20]. Finally, participants completed a 5-min cool-down and the executive task. The interval

159

between the different sessions was at least 48h to allow the full recovery and to minimize carryover

160

effects.

161

Stimulation was delivered using battery powered DC stimulators (Newronika S.r.l, Milan, Italy) and

162

delivered through a saline soaked pair of surface sponge electrodes (5 x 5 cm). For the anodal

163

(increased excitability) or cathodal (decreased excitability) we targeted the prefrontal cortex. The

164

anode or cathode electrode was placed over F3 area according to the international EEG 10-20 system

165

[21]. The opposite electrode was placed over the contralateral shoulder area in order to avoid the

166

delivery of current on the participant’s scalp. Current was set at 2 mA and was delivered for 20-min,

167

which has previously been shown to provoke cortical changes [22]. The sham stimulation (control)

168

was similar to the anodal and cathodal stimulation but the device only provided 2mA for 30s after

169

which was turned off without the participant’s awareness. This method replicates the sensory feelings

170

experienced in the tDCS trial (i.e. itching and tingling sensations) and cannot be distinguished from it,

171

whether the stimulation is continued or stopped [23]. The EEG cap was kept over the sponges during

172

stimulation period, but the EEG activity was not recorded. At the end of the session (after completing

173

the cognitive task), participants answered a questionnaire regarding their experience during and after

174

the tDCS sessions [24]. The questionnaire included a set of 19 items (e.g. did you have itching during

175

the stimulation?) scored on a scale that ranged from 0 (no effect at all) to 4 (severe effect).

176

Participants completed a modified flanker task [15], via use of computer software (E-Prime,

177

Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), to assess inhibitory control, a form of executive

178

processing after the self-paced exercise. Here, the flanker task involves the response to the direction of

179

a central arrow surrounded by other arrows pointing in the same or opposite direction. Congruent trials

180

consist of a central target arrow being flanked by other arrows that faced the same direction (e.g.,

181

<<<<< or >>>>>). The incongruent trials consist of the target arrow being flanked by other arrows

182

that faced the opposite directions (e.g., <<><< or >><>>). Participants pressed a button with their left

183

index finger when the target arrow (regardless of condition) faced to the left (e.g., ‘<’) and a button

184

with their right index finger when the target arrow faced to the right (e.g., ‘>’). Each trial started with

185

the presentation of a cross (fixation point) that remained on a steady until the appearance of the target

186

arrows 2 seconds later. The target was presented in the middle of the screen for 150 ms and a response

187

window of 1350 ms was allowed. The next trial started 1500 ms after the response. Total task duration

188

was approximately 7-min. Participants completed one block of 160 trials with equal probability for

189

congruent and incongruent trials, randomized across task conditions. A brief familiarization of the task

190

was included in the screening visit. RT (in ms) and response accuracy (percentage of correct

191

responses) for each stimulus were recorded.

192

EEG were recorded at 1000 Hz using a 30-channel actiCHamp System (Brain Products GmbH,

193

Munich, Germany) with active electrodes positioned according to the 10-20 EEG International System

194

and referenced to the Cz electrode. The cap was adapted to the individual head size for each

195

participant (mean of 57 cm), and each electrode was filled with Signa Electro-Gel (Parker

196

Laboratories, Fairfield, NJ) to optimize signal transduction. Participants were instructed to avoid body

197

movements as much as possible, and to keep their gaze on the centre of a computer screen during the

198

measurement. Electrode impedances were kept below 10 kΩ. EEG pre-processing was conducted

199

using custom Matlab scripts and the EEGLAB and Fieldtrip Matlab toolboxes. Each period and

200

stimuli for the analysis were detected by triggers sent through a parallel port from the E-prime

201

software to the EEG recorder. EEG data were resampled at 500 Hz, with a butter filter design and

202

bandpass filtered offline from 1 and 40 Hz to remove signal drifts and line noise, and re-referenced to

203

a common average reference. Horizontal electrooculograms (EOG) were recorded by bipolar external

204

electrodes for the offline detection of ocular artefacts. Independent component analysis was used to

205

detect and remove EEG components reflecting eye blinks. The potential influence of

206

electromyography activity in the EEG signal was minimized by using the available EEGLAB routines

207

[25]. Independent component analysis was used to detect and remove EEG components reflecting eye

208

blinks [26]. Abnormal spectra epochs which spectral power deviated from the mean by +/- 50 dB in

209

the 0-2 Hz frequency window (useful for catching eye movements) and by +25 or -100 dB in the 20-

210

40 Hz frequency window (useful for detecting muscle activity) were rejected. On average, 2.25 % of

211

epochs per participant were discarded.

212

All analyses were completed using statistical nonparametric permutation tests with a Monte Carlo

213

approach. These tests do not make any assumption of the underlying data distribution, are unbiased,

214

and as efficient and powerful as parametric statistics. When statistical significance (p < 0.05) was

215

found, values were corrected by the false discovery rate method. The effect of experimental condition

216

(anodal, cathodal, sham) on self-paced exercise power output, heart rate and RPE were analysed using

217

a within-subject design condition.

218

Spectral power was analysed using a within-participants’ design with the factor of stimulation (anodal,

219

cathodal, sham). Each period (Baseline, Warming Up, Exercise, Cooling Down) was tested separately

220

for significance. In the absence of strong a priori hypotheses over the frequency range and channels

221

which tDCS may induce a change, we use a stepwise, cluster-based, non-parametric permutation test

222

[27]. The spectral decomposition of each epoch (1s) was computed using Fast Fourier Transformation

223

(FFT) applying a symmetric Hamming window (0.5s) and the obtained power values were averaged

224

across experimental periods.

225

For the cognitive task, we analysed the event-related spectral perturbation main effects of stimulation

226

(anodal, cathodal, sham) for each stimulus (congruent, incongruent) by applying the cluster-based

227

approach [28]. In order to reduce the possibility that the type II error rate was inflated by multiple

228

comparisons correction, we set an a priori criteria of collapsing data into four frequency bands: Theta

229

(4–8 Hz), Alpha (8–14 Hz), lower Beta (14–20 Hz) and upper Beta 1 (20–40 Hz). Task-evoked

230

spectral EEG activity was assessed by computing event-related spectral perturbation in epochs

231

extending from -500 ms to 500 ms time-locked to stimulus onset for frequencies between 4 and 40 Hz.

232

Spectral decomposition was performed using sinusoidal wavelets with 3 cycles at the lowest frequency

233

and increasing by a factor of 0.8 with increasing frequency. Power values were normalized with

234

respect to a -300 ms to 0 ms pre-stimulus baseline and transformed into the decibel scale [29].

Executive task

275

A main effect of stimulus was reported in the flanker task, with participants being less accurate (M=

276

98 vs 91 % correct responses; F(2,34) = 13.17, p < 0.01) and slower (423 vs 515 ms; F(2,34) = 182.39,

277

p < 0.05) in the incongruent stimulus compared to the congruent stimulus. There were no significant

278

differences between conditions for the congruent and incongruent target, for RT and accuracy (Fs < 1,

279

all ps > 0.05).

Discussion

281

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study testing the influence of prefrontal cortex tDCS’

282

stimulation on self-paced exercise and brain activity during exercise. The main finding of this study

283

was that 20-min anodal or cathodal tDCS’ stimulation (relative to sham) over the left dorsolateral

11

284

prefrontal cortex did not affect exercise performance or brain electrical activity. Moreover, neither

285

sRPE, EEG or cognitive performance were affected by the stimulation. Our findings indicated that

286

anodal or cathodal tDCS applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex before exercise did not

287

modulate exercise performance during a 20-min time-trial self-paced exercise. This finding contrasts

288

the results of the only previous study testing the effect of tDCS on cycling over the same brain area

289

[13], as well as previous studies reporting positive effects of tDCS.

290

The rationale of our study was that the prefrontal cortex is involved in the control of self-paced

291

exercise, and therefore stimulating it via tDCS would increase performance. In view of our null

292

results, it may be possible that, through experience, self-pacing the effort became a more automatic

293

task for our experienced cyclists, requiring less involvement of brain areas typically linked to

294

executive processing. This may account for the apparent discrepancy of our results with those of the

295

only previous study [13] testing the effect of tDCS over the prefrontal cortex on performance in a

296

cycling task (a time to exhaustion test performed in the cycle ergometer). Indeed, participants in

297

Lattari et al.’s study only reported 3 hours per week of aerobic physical activity the last six months,

298

and hence could clearly not be classified as experienced cyclists. Therefore, the stimulation of the

299

prefrontal cortex, instead of M1 as in the majority of previous positive findings, would explain the

300

lack of effect of tDCS in our experiment.

301

Another factor that could help explaining our null results refers to the intensity of the stimulation. It is

302

possible that 2mA (the most commonly used tDCS intensity in this research domain) was not high

303

enough to affect neuronal circuits and hence to modulate exercise performance. Indeed, a study by

304

Vöröslakos et al. [30] suggests that much higher current intensities are necessary to induce observable

305

effects of electric brain stimulation. However, Vöröslakos et al. used transcranial alternating current

306

stimulation (tACS) in their experiment which somewhat limits a direct comparison with studies using

307

tDCS. It could be also possible that an individualized current intensity would be necessary to affect

308

exercise performance due to the high inter-variability across participants (see [31], for discussion on

309

this issue).

310

The hypothesis that anodal stimulation would increase EEG amplitude was not confirmed in the

311

present study. After the 20-min stimulation, the EEG spectral power was similar across all condition

312

for each period of time. This null effect is in line with the outcome of a review by Horvath et al. [34]

313

who found that tDCS does not appear to modulate EEG power spectrum measures or event-related

314

potential measures. This is also supported by the inconsistence aftereffect of tDCS on brain

315

oscillations reported across studies [32]. Once again, the null effect of tDCS on the EEG signal could

316

be explained by the low intensity of the stimulation. Indeed, using tACS, Vöröslakos et al. [30] found

317

that currents between 4-6 mA should be delivered to modulate EEG amplitude.

318

The rationale of including the flanker task after the cycling self-paced exercise was that any change in

319

physical performance and brain activity via tDCS would modulate the subsequent influence of cycling

320

on cognitive (inhibition) performance. The lack of differences in physical exertion, RPE and EEG

321

between the three experimental conditions make reasonable to have found no difference in RT or

322

accuracy as a function of tDCS.

323

Apart from the abovementioned alternative explanations, we believe that a key methodological aspect

324

could explain the discrepancy between our null findings and previous published studies, as well as the

325

inconsistencies found in this literature (see [8] for discussion on this issue): the sample size of

326

previous reports. The sample size of the vast majority of the tDCS studies in the Sport Science domain

327

are low. According to a recent review, to date, the average sample size in tDCS’ experiment is N=14

328

[8]. If one assume that there is a true effect of tDCS over exercise performance, by testing 14

329

participants one would be assuming an effect size of dz=0.81 for a paired-sample two-tailed t-test

330

(anodal vs. sham) and an a priori power of 1-b=.8 [18]. Testing a lower sample size (like in [9,11,13])

331

would assume an even larger effect size. However, such large effects are very unlikely in the tDCS

332

research domain. For instance, the estimate average effect size for tDCS studies in cognition is

333

dz=0.45 [33]. This would suggest, together with the low reproducibility of tDCS’ studies [33,34], that

334

a statistically significant effect from a published tDCS-exercise study with a small sample size (which

335

would not ensure sufficient statistical power) may easily reflect a false positive [35]. In view of our

336

null result, one might wonder whether our study, assuming there is a true small effect of tDCS over

337

self-paced exercise, was also underpowered even if we performed an a priori power analysis (based on

338

an expected medium effect size). In that respect, it is worth noting that, to the best of our knowledge,

339

our study has tested the largest sample size ever in this research domain. At this point, we believe that

340

a meta-analytical review is necessary to unveil the overall effect (if any) of tDCS over exercise/sport

341

performance and the effect of potential moderators (e.g., electrode site). Finally, we believe that the

342

”file drawer effect” (i.e., the tendency to only publish positive outcomes) might be biasing the

343

literature to positive findings [36].

344

Conclusions

345

tDCS is an increasingly popular technique used within a wide range of settings, from treatment of

346

neurological disorders, to attempting to improve exercise performance. Our data, however, add further

347

to the mixed evidence in this area, challenging the idea that an acute session of tDCS can improve

348

physical performance. At this point, we believe that research on this topic will benefit from further

349

methodologically sound research in order to accumulate evidence on whether an acute session of tDCS

350

affect sport performance or not.
