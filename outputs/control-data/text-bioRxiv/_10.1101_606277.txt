Abstract
Obesity is highly heritable, yet only a small fraction of its heritability has been attributed to specific
genetic variants. Missing heritability is particularly pronounced for childhood obesity. Here we studied
226 children for whom we typed almost one million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and
collected weight and length or height at eight time points between birth and the age of three years.
Leveraging longitudinal weight gain trajectory information and novel functional data analysis (FDA)
techniques, we constructed a polygenic risk score (PRS) comprised of 24 SNPs. This PRS explains
56% of the variability in weight gain trajectories among the studied children. Moreover, it is significantly
higher in children with (vs. without) rapid infant weight gain—a predictor of obesity later in life. We
validated the constructed PRS in populations of adolescents and adults—suggesting that some genetic
variants predispose to obesity at both childhood and later life stages. In contrast, PRSs from
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of adult obesity were not predictive of weight gain in our
cohort of children, and did not share SNPs with our PRS. Our research provides a strong example of a
successful application of FDA to a GWAS. We demonstrate that a sophisticated characterization of a
longitudinal phenotype can provide increased statistical power to studies with smaller sample sizes.
This has the potential of shifting the existing paradigm in GWAS.

Introduction
Obesity is a rising epidemic, and one that is increasingly affecting children. In 2018, 18% of children in
the United States were obese and approximately 6% were severely obese​1​—a substantial increase
from previous years​2​. Given the strong association between weight gain during childhood and obesity
across the lifecourse​3​, the search for early life risk factors has become a research and public health
priority.
Obesity is a complex disease with an etiology influenced by environmental, behavioral, and genetic
factors, which likely interact with each other​4​. For childhood obesity, dietary composition and sedentary
lifestyle have often been cited as main contributors​5​. Evidence also exists for a significant role of
parents’ socioeconomic status​6​ and maternal prenatal health factors including gestational diabetes​7​ and
smoking​8​. ​Obesity risk in children has also been associated with​ ​appetite​9​ which has been shown to be
partially influenced by genetics​10​.
The heritability of obesity has been estimated to be between 50% and 90% (with the highest values
reported for monozygotic twins and the lowest for non-twin siblings and parent-child pairs, reviewed in
11​
). This is a much higher percentage than that accounted for by the genetic variants found so far​12,13​.
Therefore, obesity suffers from “missing heritability”—a broad discrepancy between the estimated
heritability of the phenotype and the variability explained by genetic variants discovered to date. Indeed,
the search for specific genetic variants that increase the risk of obesity, in adulthood as well as in
childhood, is still ongoing. Using whole-genome sequencing, researchers have found variants in
individual genes that contribute to severe, early-onset obesity​14​. Moreover, genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are significantly
associated with obesity phenotypes such as increased body mass index (BMI), high waist-to-hip ratio,
etc.​15–21​. Albeit successful, these studies have some shortcomings; the individual contributions of the
identified SNPs tend to be very small​12​, and the prevalent focus is still on adult cohorts—with only one
childhood obesity study for every 10 adult obesity studies​22​.
One way to utilize the information gained from GWAS is to summarize the risk from multiple
disease-causing alleles in polygenic risk scores (PRSs) that can be computed for each individual​23​.
These scores are either simple counts (unweighted) or weighted sums of disease-causing alleles
identified by GWAS. Notably, while several studies have constructed PRSs for childhood obesity​24–27​,
most have done so relying on SNPs identified by GWAS on adult BMI. Since SNPs affecting obesity
risk in adults and children may differ​28​,​29,30​, this may explain the limited​12​, 3​ 1​ and age-dependent​32
explanatory power of such scores for children’s weight gain status.
In this study, we attempted to bridge this gap by focusing specifically on SNPs affecting obesity risk in
children and by using novel, highly effective Functional Data Analysis (FDA) statistical methods
developed by our group. Based on data from a deeply characterized pediatric cohort​33–35​, we
constructed children’s growth curves and treated them as a longitudinal phenotype. FDA fully leverages

this longitudinal information, extracting complex signals that can be lost in standard analyses of
cross-sectional or summary measurements. This increases power and specificity for assessing
potentially complex and combinatorial genetic contributions. Moreover, FDA models genetic effects on
the entire growth curve non-parametrically. This characterizes changes in effect size over time in a
more flexible and effective manner than other statistical methods for longitudinal data. With our
analyses, we identified genetic variants significantly associated with children’s growth curves and
combined them in a novel PRS that is strongly predictive of growth patterns and rapid infant weight
gain​36,37​, which is associated with obesity later in life. We also investigated how environmental and
behavioral covariates compound with our novel score in affecting growth curves, and provided
biological and statistical validations of our findings.

Results
Participants and DNA typing
Our study utilized 226 first-born children (out of a total of 279) enrolled in the Intervention Nurses Start
Infants Growing on Healthy Trajectories (INSIGHT) study​33​. For these children, weight and length were
measured at birth, 4 weeks, 16 weeks, 28 weeks, 40 weeks, and one year, and weight and height—at
two and three years. Using the ratios of weight for length or height (henceforth referred to
weight-for-length/height)​ at these eight time points, we constructed ​growth curves​ for all children (Fig.
1a; see Methods). We used weight-for-length/height ratio because it is the recommended measurement
for identification of children at risk for obesity under the age of two years by the American Academy of
Pediatrics (BMI is recommended afterwards)​38​. Six out of eight time points in our study fall into this
category, therefore for consistency we utilized weight-for-length/height ratio for all eight time points
analyzed.
In addition to growth curves, we computed ​conditional weight gain​ for each child (change in weight
between birth and 6 months, correcting for length, see Methods). Conditional weight gain was shown to
be an effective indicator of risk for developing obesity later in life in a previous study​39​. Also in our
study, children who experienced ​rapid infant weight gain​, i.e. those with a positive conditional weight
gain, had a significantly greater weight at one (p<2.2x10​-16​), two (p=9.1x10​-14​), and three (p=6.2x10​-13​)
years of age than children who did not (one-tailed t-tests, Fig. S1).
We isolated genomic DNA from blood samples from the 226 children and genotyped it on the Affymetrix
Precision Medicine Research Array containing 920,744 SNPs across the genome. SNPs that had
missing information, a minor allele frequency below 0.05, or were in the mitochondrial DNA were
removed from the dataset—leaving a total of 79,498 SNPs for subsequent analyses (Fig. S2).

FDA-based Polygenic Risk Score predicts growth curves and rapid
infant weight gain
The sample size of our study (n=226) is small for a traditional GWAS. However, our FDA approach
allowed us to leverage the longitudinal information in growth curves to identify significant SNPs and
combine them into a polygenic risk score (PRS). More specifically, we used FDA screening​40​ to first
reduce the analysis from 79,498 to 10,000 potentially relevant SNPs. Next, we used Functional Linear
Adaptive Mixed Estimation (FLAME)​41​ to identify 24 SNPs as significant predictors of children’s growth
curves (Table 1). Finally, we constructed our novel ​FDA PRS​ as a weighted sum of allele counts across
the 24 selected SNPs, with weights determined with additional FDA techniques (see Methods). We
found that FDA PRS is indeed a strong predictor for growth curves with a significant positive effect on
weight-for-length/height ratios across time (R​2​=0.56, p<1x10​-15​, function-on-scalar regression, see
Methods), and especially between ~10 and ~30 months of age (Fig. 2a). This can also be observed
noting that growth curves of children with high PRS values are concentrated above the mean curve
(Fig. 1b). Moreover, FDA PRS is significantly larger for children with rapid infant weight gain compared
to those without (one-tailed t-test, p=4.2x10​-10​;​ ​Fig. 2b), and is positively correlated with conditional
weight gain (R​2​=0.19, p<1x10​-05​; Fig. 2c) as well as with weight-for-length/height ratio at one (R​2​=0.50,
p<1x10​-5​), two (R​2​=0.53, p<1x10​-5​), and three (R​2​=0.46, p<1x10​-5​) years of age (Fig. S3).
These results are in sharp contrast with those we obtained for our cohort using a PRS based on adult
obesity SNPs from another study. For each child, we calculated ​Belsky PRS​—a weighted PRS based
on 29 SNPs identified through adult obesity GWAS as described by Belsky and colleagues​26​. This PRS
was used because it was correlated with BMI outcomes from age three to 38, so we hypothesized that
it would be a good predictor of weight outcomes across the lifecourse. However, Belsky PRS is not a
significant predictor of our children’s growth curves from birth through age three (R​2​=0.0032, p=0.35,
function-on-scalar regression, Fig. 2d). Furthermore, Belsky PRS is not significantly larger for children
with rapid infant weight gain compared to those without (one-tailed t-test, p=0.22; Fig. 2e) and does not
display significant correlations with conditional weight gain (R​2​=0.0009, p=0.66; Fig. 2f) and
weight-for-length/height ratio at one (R​2​=0.0064, p=0.25), two (R​2​=0.0036, p=0.37), and three

(R​2​=0.0009, p=0.71) years of age (Fig. S4). Additionally, we calculated three other previously published
childhood obesity PRSs for our cohort—Elks PRS​25​, den Hoed PRS​24​, and Li PRS​27​. Similar to the
Belsky PRS, these scores were not correlated with conditional weight gain (Fig. S5a-c) and there was
not a significant difference in PRS values between children with vs. without rapid infant weight gain
(Fig. S5d-f).

The 24 SNPs included in the FDA PRS (Table 1) do not appear in prior PRSs for either childhood or
adult obesity, and, interestingly, are not located in genes commonly associated with obesity (e.g.,
​
FTO​32,42​ and ​MC4R​15,42).
However, nine of the 24 SNPs in our FDA PRS can be linked directly or
indirectly to obesity-related traits. In particular, using the NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog
(​https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/​), we found that some of the SNPs are located in genes associated with
BMI (rs4915535, rs10227226, rs471670), cholesterol levels (rs12039940, rs9837708, rs17626544),
Type 2 diabetes (rs638348), and hypertension (rs1539759). Some SNPs we discovered are located in
the vicinity of obesity-related genes. In addition to being located in ​ZNF648​, a gene important for
determining HDL cholesterol levels, rs12039940 is located downstream of ​CACNA1E,​ a gene
associated with BMI change over time​43​. Another instance is rs72679478, a SNP with a high weight in
the FDA PRS (Table 1). It is located within ​DNAJC6​, a gene associated with Parkinson’s disease, but it
is also just upstream of the leptin receptor gene (​LEPR)​ which has been associated with early-onset
adult​ ​obesity​44​. Potential relationships between the remaining 15 SNPs and obesity should be
investigated in future studies.

Contributions of environmental and behavioral covariates
Children’s weight gain patterns can be affected by a variety of environmental and behavioral factors,
which compound to genetic effects. To evaluate their potential effects on our results, we considered a
functional regression (see Methods) of the growth curves on FDA PRS plus 11 potential confounding
covariates, namely: maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, paternal BMI, child’s birthweight, maternal gestational
weight gain, maternal gestational diabetes, maternal smoking during pregnancy, mode of delivery, the
child’s sex, mother-reported child’s appetite score, INSIGHT intervention group, and family
socioeconomic status (Table 2). FLAME​41​ applied to this regression identified FDA PRS, birthweight
and appetite as significant predictors—however, the variability explained by these three predictors
(R​2​=0.57; Table S1) is very similar to that explained by the FDA PRS alone (R​2​=0.56).​ ​Thus, genetic
effects captured by our FDA PRS remain significant, and in fact strongly dominant, also when
accounting for the environmental and behavioral covariates at our disposal.
To confirm these results we also considered the regression of conditional weight gain​39​ on the same 12
predictors as above. Best subset selection applied to this regression identified FDA PRS (p=8.65x10​-09​)
and appetite (p=2.80x10​-05​), but not birthweight, as significant positive predictors. The variability
explained (R​2​) produced by these two predictors is 0.24 (Table S1), only five percentage points higher
than the one produced by FDA PRS alone (R​2​=0.19). Thus, again, the majority of the explanatory
power remains attributable to the FDA PRS. Group LASSO​45​ applied to this regression identified FDA
PRS and birthweight, but not appetite, as relevant predictors. It also selected maternal pre-pregnancy
BMI and paternal BMI, but led to a lower R​2​ of 0.21 (Table S1).
Notably, and not unexpectedly given its lack of association with children’s growth patterns, when we
reran the analyses presented above using the Belsky PRS (instead of the FDA PRS), we did not
identify it as a significant predictor. For instance, best subset selection for the regression of conditional
weight gain on the Belsky PRS plus the 11 environmental and behavioral covariates at our disposal
retained only appetite as positive and significant predictor (p=5.53x10​-05​); all other predictors, including
the Belsky PRS itself, were eliminated.

Validation of the FDA-based Polygenic Risk Score
Biological validation of the FDA PRS. ​The analyses presented above assess the predictive power of
our FDA PRS “in-sample”—that is, on the same data on which we selected SNPs and estimated the
scoring weights.To validate the FDA PRS, we considered two independent datasets from dbGaP. It is
important to note that we could not identify publicly available data from an independent cohort that
matches our study design (i.e. with genome-wide SNP data and longitudinal weight and length or height
measurements for children under the age of three). We thus used dbGaP data from older individuals,
fully aware of the fact that these are not ideal for our purposes.
Remarkably, we were able to successfully validate FDA PRS in two independent cohorts consisting of
much older individuals—adolescents and adults—as compared with our study population of

three-year-olds. The first dataset consists of 525 adolescents between the ages of 12 and 15 from the
Philadelphia Neurodevelopment Cohort (dbGaP study phs000607.v3.p2​46–48​). Individuals are classified
based on BMI-for-age percentiles as underweight (<5th percentile), normal (5th to <85th percentile),
overweight (85th to <95th percentile), and obese (≥95th percentile). The distributions of our FDA PRS
in these classes shift towards larger values as BMI increases from underweight to obese (Fig. 3a,
upper and lower panels). While this does not translate in significant differences between all pairs of
classes, the FDA PRS of obese adolescents is significantly higher than that of underweight adolescents
(p=0.012, one-tailed t-test).
The second dataset consists of 3,486 adults (≥18 years of age) from the eMERGE study (dbGaP study
phs000888.v1.p1) who are classified as extremely obese (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m​2​) or non-obese (20 kg/m​2​ ≤
BMI < 30 kg/m​2​). Extremely obese individuals have significantly higher FDA PRS than non-obese
individuals (one-tailed t-test, p=3.2x10​-3​, Fig. 3b). Thus, FDA PRS based on children’s weight gain
patterns is predictive of extreme obesity later in life.

adults (over 18 years of age) from the eMERGE study classified as extremely obese or non-obese according to BMI values.

Finally, as an additional form of biological validation of our FDA PRS constructed using
weight-for-length/height ratio growth curves, we considered growth curves constructed using BMI. As
mentioned above, weight-for-length/height ratio is recommended for children under two years of age by
the American Academy of Pediatrics​38​ . However, our cohort is observed at ages two and three, when
BMI is recommended as the most meaningful measurement​38​ . Thus, we also considered growth curves
constructed using BMI measurement at all eight time points of the INSIGHT study. Notably, our
weight-for-length/height FDA PRS is a strong predictor also for the BMI growth curves (R​2​=0.43,

p<1x10​-15​, function-on-scalar regression)—suggesting a reasonable consistency between the
information conveyed by the two measurements, at least up to this age.
Statistical validation of the selected SNPs.​ We also assessed the robustness of our FDA-based
SNP selection with a sub-sampling scheme akin to a 20-fold cross-validation on our original dataset.
Specifically, we randomly split the data (i.e. the participants) in 20 equal parts and applied FLAME​41​ to
perform SNP selection 20 times, using different 19/20 of the data each time. We next counted how
many times (out of 20) each SNP was selected. Notably, for the 24 SNPs included in our FDA PRS, the
weights computed to construct the PRS correlate with the number of times the SNPs are selected in
this sub-sampling scheme (Fig. 4). The frequency of selection captures, in a way, how stable the effect
of a genetic variant is amid the complex and combinatorial signals in this type of data. Moreover, SNPs
which have both the largest weights and the highest selection frequency may be the most important to
interpret and validate in future studies.

Figure 4​. ​Statistical validation of FDA-based SNP selection.​ The frequency with which the 24 SNP included in the FDA
PRS are re-selected in a 20-fold sub-sampling scheme is plotted against their absolute weights in the FDA PRS—showing a
strong positive association. The SNPs with both the largest weights and the highest re-selection frequency (top five SNPs
labeled by arrows) may be the most important to interpret and validate in future studies.

Discussion
A novel, highly predictive FDA-based PRS for childhood obesity.​ In this study, we used FDA
techniques to construct a novel polygenic risk score which includes 24 SNPs selected based on
children’s longitudinal weight gain patterns. Among our study participants, this score explains
approximately 56% of the variability in growth curves from birth to the age of three years, and
approximately 19% of the variability in conditional weight gain. Moreover, our score validates on two
independent datasets comprising adolescent and adults individuals, and our SNP selection shows
statistical robustness.

While the 24 SNPs identified by our study do not appear in prior polygenic risk scores for either
childhood or adult obesity, some are located in genes linked to obesity-related phenotypes in previous
GWAS studies. Among the others, three SNPs are within genes previously associated with child
development (puberty timing) and four within genes linked to periodontitis. Connections between
obesity and puberty timing​49​, as well as between obesity and periodontitis in adults​50​, have been
suggested, yet the functional mechanisms remain unclear. As with all GWAS-type studies, it is
important to note that some of the identified SNPs may not be truly “causal”, but may be in linkage
disequilibrium with causal SNPs—and the genes in the immediate vicinity of such SNPs may not be
those through which the phenotype is influenced (e.g., rs72679478 located upstream of the leptin
receptor gene). We have also identified several SNPs with no prior associations, some of such SNPs
have high statistical robustness and high weight in the PRS, and thus need to be we investigated in
future functional experiments.
The power of FDA-based GWAS.​ Our results demonstrate a key advantage of FDA-based GWAS
over traditional GWAS. Our study was set up as an ultra-high dimensional problem—with many more
predictors (i.e. SNPs) than observations (i.e. individuals). By integrating FDA techniques into every step
of the analysis, from the screening and selection of SNPs through the construction of the polygenic risk
score, we were able to utilize a more dynamic and information-rich phenotype than the ones used in
traditional cross-sectional analyses. In turn, this allowed us to unveil subtler, more complex effects with
limited information. This is a valuable contribution as it expands the scope of GWAS to studies that do
not comprise tens of thousands of individuals—but instead a few hundred deeply characterized
participants​51​.
Genetics of childhood and adult obesity. ​Previous studies supported a relationship between
polygenic scores including adult BMI SNPs and childhood weight gain status​24–27​. However, this
relationship was generally weak—and weaker the younger the age of the children​13,24,26​. In fact, Belsky
and colleagues​26​ themselves found no relationship between their PRS (i.e. Belsky PRS) and BMI at
birth (R​2​=0.00, p>0.9) and a very weak relationship at three years of age (R​2​=0.0064, p<0.01). This is
confirmed by our inability to detect a relationship between the Belsky PRS and growth curves or
conditional weight gain measurements in our cohort. In contrast, our FDA-based PRS comprising SNPs
identified from childhood growth curves was able to distinguish extreme obesity-related phenotypes in
adolescents and adults from two independent validation cohorts. Thus, while SNPs with strong effects
on adult obesity are minor or insignificant contributors to weight gain in childhood, the SNPs with strong
effects on such gain in childhood do predict obesity later in life. This is consistent with the notion that
early life weight gain, and hence its genetic underpinning, predispose to obesity across the lifecourse​3​.
Other contributing factors and perspectives.​ Behavioral and environmental factors are important
variables to consider when investigating the etiology of complex diseases. In our study we considered
11 such factors that could influence child weight gain trajectories and found that, while the FDA PRS is
by far the dominant predictor, an appetite score computed on our cohort (see Methods) and birthweight
have significant effects. We also found some evidence for an effect of parental BMI measurements. It
has been shown that a child’s appetite behavior impacts early weight gain and may have a strong
genetic basis​31​,​10​. In agreement with this, a recent study found a positive relationship between a

childhood obesity PRS and appetite​52​. In our study child’s appetite behaviour was reported by his/her
mother which could have introduced some biases. Because appetite is emerging as an interesting
predictor of child weight gain status, it should be explored in more detail in future studies. Birthweight
has also been associated with the genetic risk for obesity, although the strength of the association
between weight and genetics seems to increase as one ages​25,27​,​53​. Finally, parental BMI has been
associated with children being overweight or obese​54–56​, which could be explained by shared
environment, shared genetics or their interaction.
In addition to the type of environmental and behavioral factors considered in our study, other factors
may compound to and interact with genetics in shaping obesity risks. These include the microbiome,
the metabolome, and the epigenome. We found previously that children’s oral microbiota composition is
associated with growth curves​57​. Moreover, we are collecting data on the metabolomes and
epigenomes of the children in our study cohort. Our overarching goal is to develop a multi-omic model
to comprehensively understand the development of childhood obesity and identify a combination of risk
factors that can be used for accurate identification of children who would benefit most from early life
intervention programs.
Our FDA-based polygenic risk score was computed considering the longitudinal change in
weight-for-length/height ratio from birth through three years of age. An ongoing follow-up of our study
participants, with weight and height collected at later time points, will allow us to further evaluate the
predictive power of the FDA PRS as age progresses. Finally, we note that our children cohort (Table 2),
as well as the cohorts of adolescents and adults used for validation, consisted predominantly of
individuals of European ancestry. It will be of great interest to conduct similar analyses on individuals of
non-European ancestries, and identify differences and commonalities in the genetic factors contributing
to obesity risks among different ethnicities.

We collected genetic information from 226 children recruited from the 279 families involved in the
INSIGHT study​33​. These children are full-term singletons born to primiparous mothers in Central
Pennsylvania. The INSIGHT study is a randomized, responsive-parenting behavioral intervention aimed
at the primary prevention of childhood obesity against a home safety control. INSIGHT collected
clinical, anthropometric, demographic, and behavioral variables on the children between birth and the
age of three years (Table 2). In this study we utilized 11 of these variables including maternal
pre-pregnancy BMI, paternal BMI, maternal pregnancy health variables (gestational weight gain,
gestational diabetes, and smoking during pregnancy), family income (as a proxy for socioeconomic
status), mode of delivery, child’s sex, child’s birth weight, INSIGHT intervention group (intervention or
control), and mother-reported child’s appetite at 44 weeks. The appetite score is an ordinal variable on
a scale from 1-5 which summarizes the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire (CEBQ)​58​. Domains on the

CEBQ include food responsiveness, emotional over-eating, food enjoyment, desire to drink, satiety
responsiveness, slowness in eating, emotional under-eating, and food fussiness. Length was measured
using a recumbent length board (Shorr Productions) for visits before two years (birth, 3-4 weeks, 16
weeks, 28 weeks, 40 weeks, and one year). Standing height was measured with a stadiometer (Seca
216) at two and three years.
To construct growth curves, we utilized the anthropometric data collected above to calculate
weight-for-length/height ratio at each time point for our analysis. We used FDA to analyze these
longitudinally as individual functions through the ​fdapace​ package in ​R​. This package implements the
Principal Analysis by Conditional Estimation (PACE) algorithm​59​, which pools information across
subjects for more accurate curve construction. We used the default settings and represented them in
Fig. 1a using 51 cubic spline functions with evenly spaced knots.
Conditional weight gain z-scores were calculated as the standardized residuals from a regression of
age- and sex-specific weight-for-age z-score at 6-months on the weight-for-age z-score at birth
(determined using the World Health Organization sex-specific child growth standards)​34​. Length-for-age
z-score at 6-months, length at birth, and precise age at the 28-week visit were considered as cofactors
in this regression and thus only the change in weight between birth and 6-months was captured​34,36​.
These scores are approximately normally distributed and have, by construction, a mean of 0 and a
standard deviation of 1. Positive conditional weight gain z-scores correspond to a greater than average
weight gain and are used to define rapid infant weight gain, which is a risk factor for developing obesity
later in life​37,60,61​.

Genotyping
Blood from a fingerstick was collected at the child’s one year clinical research visit. Genomic DNA was
isolated (Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit) and genotyped on the Affymetrix Precision Medicine
Research Array (PMRA). Initial quality filtering was performed using the following criteria: we removed
SNPs with minor allele frequency >0.05 and/or present in less than 5% of individuals. All quality filtering
steps were performed in PLINK v1.9​62,63​ with 79,498 SNPs remaining after quality filtering.
To obtain missing genotype calls and genotypes not included on the PMRA, we performed imputation.
Individual’s genotypes were first phased leveraging pedigree information (genotypes were also
collected for mother and father in most cases, and some younger siblings) using SHAPEIT2​64,65​. The
phased haplotypes were then used for imputation using the 1,000 Genomes Project phase 3 data​66​ as
a reference panel in IMPUTE2​67​. SNPs with imputation probability <90% were removed. Following
imputation, we had 12,479,343 SNPs.

Functional Data Analysis techniques
First, we used an ​FDA feature screening​ method​40​, which is an effective and fast procedure to filter out
SNPs that are clearly unimportant, yielding a substantially smaller subset of SNPs that can then be
used in a more advanced joint model​68​. This method is specifically designed for longitudinal GWAS and

can handle up to millions of SNPs. The method evaluates each SNP individually fitting a simplified
model comprising only that SNP (with no other SNPs involved) and calculating a weighted mean
squared error. This is then used to rank the SNPs. In our study, the top 10,000 SNPs were selected
with this feature screening step. See Supplementary Note S1 for additional details about FDA feature
selection.
After feature screening, we used FLAME (​Functional Linear Adaptive Mixed Estimation​)41​
​ , a method
that simultaneously selects important predictors and produces smooth estimates for function-on-scalar
linear models. This method further downselects from the pool of the top 10,000 SNPs as ranked within
our screening step. In addition, it provides smooth estimates of the effects of the selected SNPs on the
growth curves. To tune the penalty involved in FLAME, we split our observations into training (75%)
and test (25%) sets. This procedure resulted in 24 SNPs and their corresponding estimated effect
curves. FLAME was also used to assess the statistical robustness of SNP selection in a 20-fold
sub-sampling scheme (selection was repeated 20 times, each time on 19/20 of the data); for this
exercise we fixed the penalty level, to be consistent across folds. See Supplementary Note S2 for
additional details about FLAME.
Next, we used the estimated effect curves produced by FLAME for each of the 24 selected SNPs to
construct our ​FDA-based Polygenic risk score.​ This was done choosing SNP-specific weights that
maximize the covariance between weighted SNP counts and growth curves fitted through the FLAME​41
estimates—thus incorporating both the dynamic nature of the SNP effects and linkage disequilibrium
between the SNPs themselves. We applied the weights to the allele counts of each child, and
computed his/her FDA PRS as the weighted sum of counts across the selected SNPs. Thus, FDA
allows us to exploit the longitudinal structure of our data to not only screen and select SNPs, but also
weigh them using estimates of how their effects change over time.
We assessed the association between growth curves and the FDA PRS fitting function-on-scalar linear
models​69​. The significance of the FDA PRS was determined based on three tests​70​ employing different
types of weighted quadratic forms. One employs a simple L2 norm of the parameter estimate (L2),
another uses principal components to reduce dimension prior to a Wald-type test (PCA), and the last
blends the two through the addition of a weighted scheme in the PCA (Choi). We reported the more
conservative of the three values.

Polygenic Risk Scores constructed by other studies
To run the calculations of Belsky PRS​26​, Elks PRS​25​, den Hoed PRS​24​, and Li PRS​27​, we employed the
Allelic Scoring function in PLINK v1.9​62,63​. In some cases proxy alleles had to be used in place of SNPs
that were not assessed on the PMRA. Such proxies were determined using linkage disequilibrium with
LDlink​72​. Tables describing the composition of each PRS can be found in the Supplemental Materials
(Tables S2-S5).

Validation datasets
We used two validation datasets downloaded from dbGaP. The first dataset was obtained from
Neurodevelopmental Genomics: Trajectories of Complex Phenotypes (dbGaP dataset accession
number phs000607.v3.p2​46–48​). We considered 525 adolescents between the ages of 12 to 15 years
who self-reported as being of European descent. Using their height and weight measurements, we
calculated BMI and then categorized the BMI based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
BMI-for-age (and gender) recommendations. The second dataset was obtained from the eMERGE
Network Imputed for 41 Phenotypes (dbGaP dataset accession number phs000888.v1.p1, variable
number phv00225989.v1.p1). We considered 3,486 adults with either a case or control diagnosis of
extreme obesity. For both datasets the FDA GRS was calculated using the score function in PLINK
v1.9​62,63​. Proxies for SNPs were determined using LDLink​72​ and are summarized in Table S6.

Analysis of environmental and behavioral covariates
Using the Bayesian Information Criterion option of the ​bestglm​ function in R​73​, we applied best subset
selection to the regression of conditional weight gain scores​34​ on 11 potentially confounding covariates
(described in the Results section). We did not consider interaction terms for this analysis, but we
included (separately) Belsky PRS or FDA PRS as a 12th predictor in the regression. Once the best
subset of predictors was selected, we fitted a linear model on it using the lm function in the R stats
package.
We also applied LASSO and Group LASSO procedures to the same regressions for conditional weight
gain, using the ​glmnet​74​ and ​gglasso​75​ packages respectively. We considered again the 11
potentially confounding covariates along with a PRS, and all possible two-way interactions. The LASSO
methods were tuned via 10 fold cross-validation, fixing the penalty parameter to be within 1 standard
error of the overall minimum cross-validation error. This is considered the more parsimonious
approach, usually favoring a sparser final model​71​.
