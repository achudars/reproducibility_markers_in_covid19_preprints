Abstract
2

Birds have classic examples of exaggerated sexually dimorphic traits, including colors.
Sexes among the wild rock dove and its derived domestic breeds, however, are quite

4

indistinguishable and sex can only be ascertained through genotyping or egg laying and
successful hatching of eggs. Yet, the pigeon fancy has discovered sexually dimorphic traits and

6

harnessed some of these traits in some auto-sexing breeds. Early genetics pioneers characterized
the sex-linked Stipper locus and showed it to be linked to the pigeon Z linked B-locus (Tyrp1).

8

The alleles of the Stipper locus have variable dominance relative to wild-type (more severe
alleles are incompletely dominant, less severe alleles are reportedly fully dominant),

10

characterized by a continuum of lightening in homozygotes and increased variegation in
heterozygotes corresponding with severity. We leveraged this positional information and

12

population structure among breeds in a candidate gene approach to identify the genetic
mechanism of de novo pigeon sex dichromatism. A large tandem duplication (77 kb) centered on

14

the gene Melanoma antigen recognized by T cells (Mlana) is completely associated with alleles
of the Stipper locus. Copy number of the 77 kb genetic lesion was not correlated with allele

16

severity suggesting that other mechanisms, including epigenetic regulation could underlie both
allele severity and degree of variegation.

Introduction
2

Sexual dimorphism is known from theoretical and empirical work to result from
antagonistic natural selection or sexual selection acting on autosomal or sex-linked loci. Sexual

4

dichromatism, especially is exaggerated to a greater extent among birds than among mammals,
with cocks often being the targets for runaway sexual selection. Theory predicts that

6

dichromatism is easier to evolve when a locus under selection is sex-linked by virtue of dosage
effects in each sex (Rice 1984; Albert & Otto 2005), especially given the incomplete or lack of

8

dosage compensation reported among birds (Teranishi et al. 2001; Shang et al. 2010; Caetano et
al. 2014; Graves 2014).

10

In domestic pigeons, an otherwise uniform blue-gray species, classical genetic work has
identified two pairs of sex-linked (Z-linked) color loci: Stipper and B-locus, and dilution and

12

reduced (Cole & Kelley 1919; Hawkins 1931; Hollander & Cole 1940). Stipper (St) and B-locus
(b) are closely linked (~3 cM), and approximately 45 cM from the second pair, dilution and

14

reduced that are ~5 cM apart (Hollander, unpublished). Both Stipper and B-locus exhibit sexual
dimorphism in degree of plumage variegation, and alleles of the former (e.g. Faded) have been

16

fixed in some auto-sexing breeds (fig. 1). We recently showed two Z-linked genes, Slc45a2 and
Tyrp1 map to the dilution locus and B-locus respectively (Domyan et al., 2014) .

variegation and pigmentation increase with age; Almond females (left, 5 month old) develop less
2

variegation than heterozygous males (right, 3 month old). The breeder’s classic Almond (not
shown) in contrast to unrefined Almonds (shown here) combine mutant alleles in heterozygosity

4

at several autosomal and sex-linked pigmentation loci that enhance the richness of the
variegation. B and C: Texan pioneer is a squabbing breed (produced for meat), in which a

6

Faded allele of a single origin has been fixed. B: a male blue Texan pioneer (wild-type/blue-gray
at the B-locus) appears nearly white (StF/StF) in contrast to a female; C: a female blue Texan

8

10

pioneer appears wild-type (StF/•).

In this study our goal was to map the Stipper locus, which is characterized by more
extreme sexual dichromatism than the B-locus, including male-specific lethality for some of the

12

more severe alleles in the homozygous state. Mapping the molecular underpinnings of the
Stipper locus will provide a rare opportunity to examine the evolution of sexual dichromatism at

14

its earliest stages. This locus is highly mutable in the germline, reportedly spontaneously giving
off less severe alleles from the most severe allele (Stipper/Almond) in 1/100 informative meioses,

16

and the Faded allele alone is reported to have arisen multiple times in this manner. The
complexities of this locus are that almost all reports subsequent to Hollander’s work come from

18

fancier-geneticists, and distinct phenotypic manifestations due to dosage, allele severity, somatic
instability (variegation), and reported new alleles have likely arisen in previously unexamined

20

genetic contexts (breeds previously not known for Stipper alleles). The Stipper locus has seven
recognized alleles of decreasing severity and dominance: Almond or Stipper (St), Sandy (SSa),

22

Qualmond (StQ), Hickory (StH), Faded (StF), Chalky (StCh), Frosty (StFy), with wild-type (st+) at
the bottom of the allelic series (Peter 2015). In homozygosity the phenotypes are reported to

24

form a near-continuum of plumage lightening from blue-gray in wild-type to white in the
Almond allele. Almond homozygotes, are reported to hatch out naked (without neonatal down),

with defective eyes, and fledge white. These fledglings are not known to make it to sexual
2

maturity. Sandy homozygotes unlike Almonds are reported to have mild eye defects, and are not
homozygous lethal. In heterozygosity too phenotype severity is reported to correspond with

4

dominance hierarchy, such that degree of variegation is greatest in Almond, and degree of
variegation is greater in cocks than in hens. Variegation is least in homozygotes. Finally, each

6

fleck of variegation increases in size and distribution with successive molts (fig. 1).
The Almond (St) allele in heterozygosity is prized among breeders for the rich colors

8

produced in the flecks, particularly in combination with heterozygosity at a number of autosomal
pigmentation traits and the linked B-locus. The pigmentation in the variegating flecks is

10

influenced by the genotype and gametic phase at the neighboring B-locus, with distinct cis- vs.
trans- allelic interactions in males doubly heterozygous at Stipper and B-locus (Hollander 1982).

12

For example: in Almond, B-locus double heterozygotes, the flecks bear the color encoded by the
dominant B-locus allele only when that allele is in trans- (out of phase) with the Almond (St)

14

allele. When this phase relationship is reversed, the flecks may bear colors encoded by either Blocus allele.

16

The Faded (StF) allele has been harnessed by pigeon squab breeders for auto-sexing
purposes in a small number of utility breeds, including the Texan pioneer (fig. 1 B & C)

18

(Hollander 1982; Hollander 1938; Hollander & Cole 1940). This breed is unique in that the date
and origin of the Faded allele in the breed is known (new breed admission 1962 NPA).

20

The large number of alleles, continuum of phenotypes, sexually dimorphic variegation
and plumage lightening, and distinct cis- vs. trans- interaction with the B-locus are suggestive of

22

instability in the vicinity of B-locus/Tyrp1 that suppresses pigment synthesis or melanocyte
differentiation. Several examples of continuous traits and variegation have been characterized in

24

other species with multitude of mechanisms (Lyon 1962; Argeson et al. 1996; Kijas et al. 2001;
Clark et al. 2006; Girton & Johansen 2008; Choate et al. 2010; Walbot 2013). As there are

several models that might account for various aspects of these dimorphic variegation, identifying

the molecular underpinning is essential to understanding these processes.

Results
The Z-linked Stipper locus is reportedly 3 cM from B-locus (Tyrp1) and the chicken Z

6

centromere is approximately 10 Mb from chicken Tyrp1. BLAST alignment of the pigeon Z
centromeric PR1 repeat and the chicken CENP-A, Z centromeric repeat sequences map across

8

pigeon scaffold 6 approximately 3 Mb upstream from Tyrp1 (scaffold 6 – 4.8 Mb; Tyrp1 –
204968-215057) (Solovei et al. 1996; Shang et al. 2010). A CR-1 non-LTR transposable

10

element was discovered interrupting the centromere repeat alignment when BLASTing a 2 Kb
sequence of pigeon genomic scaffold 6, centered on the PR1 repeat against the pigeon genome.

12

The B-locus, Ash-red haplotype spans the proximal portion of scaffold 6 and includes
centromeric repeats at its distal 5′ end [Domyan et al., (2014) refined this to a 20 kb haplotype;

this gene was casual. On the 5′ of Tyrp1, the tested markers were not polymorphic at the end of

3.17 Mb on scaffold 6 and Adaptor-related protein complex 3, beta-1 subunit (Ap3b, scaffold

an earlier study among unrelated individuals of several breeds showed lack of polymorphism in a

We investigated scaffolds in this region of all resequenced pigeon genomes that bear
candidate genes for structural polymorphism by piling up the regional depth over respective

10

library genome wide averaged read depth. Two putative, large, nested, copy number variants
(CNV) 5′ of Tyrp1, both centered on candidate gene Mlana (scaffold 6) were discovered in

12

several libraries. The smaller 25 kb tandem duplication, spanning only Mlana occurred in ten
libraries, while the larger 77 kb tandem duplication occurred in five of those ten libraries (fig. 3).

14

The 77 kb duplication appears to have occurred on the 25 kb duplication haplotype and does not
appear from the WGS data to crossover and segregate away. It is thus predicted that a Z

16

chromosome bearing the 25 kb duplication has two copies of Mlana and a chromosome bearing
the 77 kb duplication is expected to have four copies of Mlana. None of the breed standards for

18

libraries having either CNV were suggestive of selection for specific Stipper alleles. However,
the possibility that some breeds are fixed for traits that may actually be unrecognized alleles of

20

Stipper is considered. Given the high frequency of the 25 kb CNV, we chose to empirically
validate and test the 77 kb duplication with a panel of Stipper allele individuals. The

sequences. Reads for the region flanking the boundaries of the putative CNVs were manually
aligned to identify the breakpoint spanning sequences across which allele specific amplicons

were designed. A large CT rich repeat (TTTCCCTTTTCCTTCCTTTTCCCCC) ~25 flanking the
breakpoint and the duplication specific primer of the 77 kb CNV allowed only a

presence/absence assay. The 77 kb duplication was empirically verified in a panel comprising
unrelated Almond cocks and individuals of Sandy, Qualmond, Faded, Chalky, and Frosty alleles.

Genetic association was tested in an expanded panel comprising wild-type hens and cocks and
Stipper alleles from unique lineages. The breakpoint spanning amplicon had PCR amplification

in all of the Stipper individuals, and failed to amplify in any of the wild-type individuals
(Fisher’s exact test: p = 3.56 x 10-15; fig. 4).

the Faded allele of Texan pioneer pigeons will have a narrow range of variation due to their
2

known single origin. Using the method of Livak and Schmittgen (2001), Texan pioneer hens (n =
2) tested had seven-fold amplification of Mlana in contrast to 13-fold and 16-fold amplification

in two unrelated Almond hens, relative to an ascertained wild-type hen. Copy-number (fold
change) of Mlana per chromosome ranged from three to 18 in Almonds (Almond cock: x̅ – 9.5,

Discussion
De novo origins of sexual dimorphism are without doubt of great interest to biologists,

4

especially when we can observe and test the molecular underpinnings. Pigeons provide a unique
opportunity to understand the underpinnings of sex-linked dimorphism. These dimorphic

6

pigmentation traits were observed by early pioneers including Darwin, and are reported to have
been harnessed even in ancient breeds like the Reehani dewlap to discriminate sexes (Darwin

8

1868; Levi 1963). Four sex-linked pigmentation traits were recognized by early geneticists and
the sexually dimorphic expression was recognized for two of the four loci. The positional

10

information of the four sex-linked loci together with advances in our understanding of the
melanogenesis pathway and availability of the pigeon genome data and well annotated chicken

12

14

genome limited the genome-wide pool of candidate genes on the Z chromosome.

Given the reported 3 cM distance of the Stipper locus from B-locus and similarities
between the Ash-red phenotype at B-locus and alleles of Stipper, we have shown here that a 77

16

kb tandem duplication centered on Mlana is in complete association with alleles of the Stipper
locus (p = 3.56 x 10-15). The 25 kb tandem duplication spans only Mlana, whereas the 77 kb

18

tandem duplication also spans Monocarboxylate transporter 2 (Mct2 or Slc16a7) and portions of
KIAA2026 and Endoplasmic reticulum metallopeptidase 1. MCT proteins are a poorly

20

understood family of solute carriers that transport monocarboxylates such as pyruvate, lactate,
and ketones across cell membranes for carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism

22

(Halestrap & Wilson 2012). Mct2 has different expression profiles in the few species in which it
has been studied and is not reported to be expressed in melanocytes (Halestrap & Wilson 2012).

24

Mlana, the only pigmentation candidate in the region is a melanoma, melanocyte and retinal
pigment epithelial cell marker (Coulie et al. 1994; Aydin & Beermann 2009; Aydin et al. 2012).

The MLANA protein is reported to play a key role in maturation of Premelanosome protein
2

(PMEL), a melanosomal matrix protein, upon which the melanin pigments are deposited (Hoashi
et al. 2005).

4

The 77 kb genetic lesion with Mlana at its center is the seed for the allelic continuum at
Stipper locus. While there is an indication of a linear relationship between copy-number and

6

allele severity among homozygotes of Stipper alleles, lack of a clear copy-number correlation
with Almond allele severity may be a consequence of phenotype ascertainment bias or genetic

8

heterogeneity and other models that are discussed below.
Intriguingly, the ice pigeon library (SRR516995), which is known to be fixed for the ice

10

phenotype has both the 77 kb and 25 kb duplications. The breed is additionally fixed for wildtype (blue) at the B-locus. Considering this breed is not known to exhibit variegation or sexual

12

dimorphism and has no reports of sub-lethal effects or reduced fertility, it is conceivable that ice
could be an allele of the Stipper locus, but lower than Faded in dominance order and severity.

14
Models to explain attributes of Stipper mutants
16

Several non-exclusive models account for multiple features of this locus. Simple sexlinked dosage effects could manifest in different character states in each sex and genotype

18

because in birds, unlike in mammals, global silencing of one sex chromosome in the
homogametic sex is not known to occur (Lyon 1962; Teranishi et al. 2001). The extent and

20

mechanisms of avian dosage compensation are still unclear, and are areas of active research, but
recent results in chickens indicate that a chromosomal interval flanking Dmrt1 (candidate avian

22

sex determination locus) is hyper-methylated in males and hypo-methylated in females by the
long non-coding RNA of the Male hyper-methylation locus (MHM) (Teranishi et al. 2001; Shang

24

et al. 2010; Caetano et al. 2014; Graves 2014). This mode of regional dosage compensation
found in chickens does not appear to be found in all birds, as demonstrated by the lack of the

MHM locus in zebra finches (Itoh et al. 2010).
2

The continuous nature of the plumage lightening phenotypes of various Stipper alleles,
however, is suggestive of dosage modulation due to copy number variation. The bioinformatic

4

data leads one to expect a chromosome bearing a single 77 kb duplication to have four copies of
Mlana. The copy number assays, however, reveal a wide range of variation among alleles of

6

Stipper, especially among unrelated Almond, and even among related Almond individuals.
The variegation in the Stipper phenotypes is reminiscent of position effect variegation

8

(PEV) in Drosophila and the mouse Agouti hypervariable allele (Talbert & Henikoff 2006;
Slotkin & Martienssen 2007), in both of which a genetic lesion triggers epigenetic modifications

10

in the soma that restores the underlying phenotype. Similarly, if epigenetic modifications of the
77 kb genetic lesion are inherited stably in the germ-line, then the allelic continuum and

12

heritability of the phenotype could be easily explained (fig. 1A: copy number of the hen/positive
control = 13, and cock = 4). In the melanocytes, variation in copy number together with its

14

epigenetic modifications during feather growth could result in variegation and explain the allelic
continuum and cis-/trans - effects.

16

The long stretch of tandemly repeated homologous sequence is also ripe for illegitimate
recombination, and can also result in expansion or contraction of the motif in the germline,

18

similar to well-known examples in dogs and humans (Fondon & Garner 2004; Choate et al.
2010; Gemayel et al. 2010). Such somatic recombination models could adequately account for

20

the cis- vs. trans- allelic interactions between the Stipper and B-locus. A simple model of repeat
expansion and contraction can however, entail a runaway process that can cause breakage of the

A “fragile Z” model might also explain variegation, but may not be adequate on its own to

explain the cis- vs. trans- allelic interaction between alleles of the Stipper and B-locus in the
soma unless Tyrp1 is centromeric to Mlana. It is conceivable that a combination of CNV

expansion and somatic recombination can underlie the basis of allelic continua, de novo origins
2

of alleles in pedigrees, and variegation.
An alternate model considers the requirement of the MLANA protein to participate in the

4

maturation of the PMEL. In dogs, a SINE insertion in the terminal intron of Pmel is associated
with the merle trait, which is a patchwork of wild-type and depigmented patches (Clark et al.

6

2006). Similarly loss of function mutations of Pmel in chicken, horse, and cattle result in varying
degrees of hypopigmentation (Kerje et al. 2004; Brunberg et al. 2006). If the native state of the

8

77 kb Mlana tandem duplications in the germline is epigenetically silenced, then copy-number of
Mlana may not be crucial to the phenotype as the data seem to suggest. In this scenario, silencing

10

of Mlana can have downstream effects on PMEL and melanosome morphology, thus resulting in
the bleached phenotype, such that loss of silencing in the germline and soma results in de novo

12

lower alleles and variegation (Aydin et al. 2012).
One intriguing possibility is raised by the fact that MLANA is a melanoma specific

14

antigen recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). It is thus conceivable that overexpression of Mlana triggers an auto-immune response resulting in immune-mediated depletion

16

of melanocytes. Sufficient exposure to CTLs, which is known to select for cells that do not
express the antigens (Jäger et al. 1996), may relieve melanocyte depletion and restore

18

melanogenesis in the pigmented flecks of feathers.

Methods
Foundation stock was obtained from hobbyists to screen for marker-phenotype

association; in addition crosses were established between diverse breeds in which to test cosegregation of markers and color phenotypes. Blood was drawn from the brachial or axillary vein

24

and stored in ice in EDTA vacutainers, or blood was drawn into heparinized capillary tubes and
plunged into 50% ethanol in 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes. All animals were photographed in a

using a Nikon D5000 DSLR camera. Detailed interviews were conducted with breeders for each
sample to ascertain the phenotypes, genotypes, and to assess confidence. Pedigree information

4

including phenotypes/genotypes of first degree relatives, and information on size and diversity of
loft, and breeding goals of the breeder were used to vet and inform decisions on sample

6

ascertainment and confidence. Knowledge of the Z linkage group was used to target samples
across breeds such that phase relationships could be deduced with the objective that mapping one

8

locus will help lead to nearby loci. All experiments involving animals were conducted in
accordance with Institutional Animal and Use Committee guidelines (protocol #s A09.009 &

10

A14.009; PI: JWF).
In the chicken Z chromosome (Ggal 4.0) Tyrp1 (the pigeon B-locus) lies 10 Mb from the

12

metacentric centromere. Published pigeon and chicken centromeric repeat sequences from
Genbank (Solovei et al. 1996; Shang et al. 2010) were BLASTed against the pigeon genome to

14

determine the location of the pigeon Z centromeric repeats in relation to the pigeon B-locus
(Tyrp1, scaffold 6). Gene order and orientation were screened by eye and gene order at scaffold

16

termini were used to determine scaffold ordering by contrasting against the chicken and hoazin
genomes, in addition to using the chromosome bowser (Evolution Highway v1.0.6002). Whole

18

genome shotgun sequence (WGS) reads were extracted using Samtools and manually aligned to
bridge across scaffold breakpoints in order to identify candidate polymorphisms. Candidate

20

genes that account for different attributes of Stipper in this chromosomal interval include Tyrp1
(pigeon B-locus) and Melanoma A (Mlana, melanoma antigen recognized by T cells) (Aydin &

22

Beermann 2009; Aydin et al. 2012). Additionally, Nuclear factor I B (NfIb, melanocyte stem cell
homeostasis), Lens epithelium derived growth factor (Ledgf, maintenance and survival of lens

24

2

To bound the chromosomal interval of the Stipper locus relative to B-locus, markers
(SNP and indel) were selected from WGS data of Shapiro et al. (2013), and genotyped to exclude

4

Tyrp1 in association panels comprising closed sub-populations with confidence of few or single
origins of the Stipper allele. To determine the direction in which Stipper lies, chromosome

6

walking on either side of Tyrp1 was performed in the Texan pioneer breed for homozygosity
mapping among individuals of unknown relationships from a single loft. Since all three B-locus

8

alleles occur in the breed, Texan pioneers are therefore expected to share the same, albeit large
haplotype around Faded, but harbor variation at the B-locus.

10
Detection of variants from whole genome shotgun sequence libraries
12

Available sequence reads from whole genome shotgun sequence libraries from 40 pigeons of
diverse breeds/varieties (described in Shapiro et al. 2013) were obtained from the Sequence Read

14

Archive (SRA, BioProject accession PRJNA167554) and used to identify sequence variation
within Z chromosome scaffolds. The SRA format was converted into split FASTQ files for

16

mapping using the fastq-dump tool included in the SRAtoolkit provided by NCBI
(https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki/Downloads). These FASTQ formatted reads were mapped

18

to the Cliv1.0 pigeon reference genome using the Novoalign short-read mapping software,
version 2.08.02 (Novocraft Technologies, Selangor, Malaysia) with default parameters. Single

20

nucleotide variants and short insertions and deletions were identified using the mpileup feature
of SAMtools (Li et al. 2009). Simple sequence repeat length variations were characterized using

22

the methods of Fondon et al. (2012), for repeats identified by Tandem Repeat Finder v2.30
(Benson 1999) with parameters “2 5 5 80 10 14 5.”

Larger insertions, deletions, and other structural variation within 50 kilobases of Mlana
were identified by anomalous inferred insert size, mate-pair orientation, or mapped read depth

Copy number assay
2

To empirically verify existence of copy number variants, primers were placed across
breakpoint spanning sequences and tested in a discovery panel comprising various Stipper

4

alleles. Allele specific tailed primers were designed for use in a three primer PCR assay,
controlling for oligonucleotide sequence, amplicon sequence, genomic context, while preserving

6

haplotype specific features and microhomology sequence between the allele specific primers.
Genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) standardized for 10

8

μL volume reactions, 0.1 μL Taq DNA polymerase, 0.5 μL left and right primers (40 μM)
respectively, 5 μL Failsafe premix (EpiCentre), 2.9 μL H2O, and 1 μL genomic DNA template.

10

PCR cycling conditions were 96 °C – 3 min, (96 °C – 0.30 min, (65 – 55 °C) 0.30 min, 72 °C –
0.30 min) x 29, 72 °C – 6 min, hold at 4 °C, or touchdown protocol [96 °C – 3 min, {(96 °C –

12

0.30 min, 72 °C – 0.30 min) x 30}] 72 °C – 6 min, hold at 4 °C].

14
Copy-number assessment
16

To evaluate copy-number correlation with allele severity, the Applied Biosystems ®
SYBR green I chemistry (Power SYBR and Fast SYBR) were employed on an ABI7300

18

instrument. Quantitative PCR was performed using manufacturer’s protocol for 20 μL volume
reactions, 10 μL SYBR, 0.2 μL left and right primers (20 μM) respectively, 7.6 μL H2O, and 2

20

μL genomic DNA template. Cycling conditions for Power SYBR and Fast SYBR on the ABI
7300 were 95 °C – 10 min, [(95 °C – 0.10 min, 60 °C – 0.30 min) x 40] and 95 °C – 0.23 min,

22

[(95 °C – 0.10 min, 60 °C – 0.30 min) x 40] respectively. Relative quantification of copy number
was assessed using the 2-∆∆CT method, which contrasts PCR signal at the target or candidate

24

region with an untreated control locus of known copy-number (Livak & Schmittgen 2001). ∆CT
values for each sample were normalized against those of the wild-type hen to estimate fold

change in amplification efficiency. Two amplicons of 90 bp length were designed, placing one
2

amplicon in the heart of the candidate region (Mlana exon 4) and the second amplicon in a
region on the Z chromosome that was ascertained bioinformatically to be invariant. To ensure

4

wild-type genotype (single copy of Mlana per chromosome), phenotypically wild-type hens were
genotyped for absence of the 25 kb and 77 kb duplication. An ascertained wild-type hen was

6

used for further experiments. To ascertain the reliability of this method a panel comprising a
wild-type hen, Almond hen (St/•) and two unrelated Texan pioneer hens (StF/•), was used with the

8

expectation that the Texan pioneers will have comparable amplification fold change relative to
wild-type and half that of Almond. Follow-up experiments were designed to evaluate relative

10

copy numbers of various alleles of the Stipper locus in males (homozygotes and heterozygotes)
and females. Finally, to independently ascertain the relationship of copy-number and Stipper

12

phenotype all Almond individuals from a nuclear family sired by an Almond cock were assayed.
