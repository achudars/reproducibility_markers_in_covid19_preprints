SUMMARY

In the mammalian brain, the insula is the primary cortical substrate involved in the perception of taste. Recent imaging studies in rodents have identified a gustotopic organization in
the insula, whereby distinct insula regions are selectively responsive to one of the five basic
tastes. However, numerous studies in monkeys have reported that gustatory cortical neurons are
broadly-tuned to multiple tastes, and tastes are not represented in discrete spatial locations. Neuroimaging studies in humans have thus far been unable to discern between these two models,
though this may be due to the relatively low spatial resolution employed in taste studies to date.
In the present study, we examined the spatial representation of taste within the human brain using ultra-high resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at high magnetic field
strength (7-Tesla). During scanning, participants tasted sweet, salty, sour and tasteless liquids,
delivered via a custom-built MRI-compatible tastant-delivery system. Our univariate analyses
revealed that all tastes (vs. tasteless) activated primary taste cortex within the bilateral dorsal
mid-insula, but no brain region exhibited a consistent preference for any individual taste. However, our multivariate searchlight analyses were able to reliably decode the identity of distinct
tastes within those mid-insula regions, as well as brain regions involved in affect and reward,
such as the striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, and amygdala. These results suggest that taste quality
is not represented topographically, but by a combinatorial spatial code, both within primary
taste cortex as well as regions involved in processing the hedonic and aversive properties of
taste.

1 INTRODUCTION
The sensation of taste begins on the tongue with sensory receptor
cells tuned to one of the five basic tastes: sweet, salty, sour, bitter,
and umami (Roper and Chaudhari, 2017). These taste receptor cells
signal to afferent sensory neurons, and although some are dedicated
to one specific taste, most receive input from multiple taste cells
(Roper and Chaudhari, 2017). Thus taste coding in the periphery
is a mixture of labelled-line transmission and a complex combinatorial code across afferent neurons that are both specifically and
broadly-tuned (Simon et al., 2006; Roper and Chaudhari, 2017). In
the taste afferent pathway, taste fibers travel along cranial nerves
VII, IX, and X to reach their first synapse at the nucleus of the solitary tract in the medulla (Beckstead et al., 1980). In primates, these
second-order taste afferents are relayed to the thalamic gustatory
nucleus (knows as either the VMb or VPMpc nucleus) (Pritchard
et al., 1986). At both of these sub-cortical relays different tastes

are intermingled, with little evidence for topographic organization
(Simon et al., 2006) prior to reaching their cortical target in the
mid-dorsal region of the insular cortex (Small, 2010).
There are two basic models that can account for the representation of taste quality within the insular cortex: A topographic
model, where a specific taste, such as sweet, is represented at
a discreet spatial location, and a combinatorial coding model in
which taste is represented by a combination of broadly tuned cortical neurons that are differentially sensitive to different tastes. The
topographic model would be analogous to somatotopy in the somatosensory system, or retinotopy in the visual system. It should
be noted, however, that unlike retinotopy and somatotopy, where
sensory signals are represented according to their well-defined location in space, the sensation of taste has no such spatial layout,
as previous theories of a taste map on the tongue have been disproven (Chandrashekar et al., 2006). Currently, although there is
some support for the topographical model in rodents (Chen et al.,
2011), human neuroimaging studies have failed to provide evidence for this possibility. These previous studies, however, have
relied on small sample sizes and relatively low resolution imaging (Schoenfeld et al., 2004; Prinster et al., 2017). Higher resolution neuroimaging methods may be needed in order to identify to-

pographically distinct insula regions selective for particular tastes.
Relatedly, another possibility suggested by a previous human neuroimaging study (Schoenfeld et al., 2004) is that, while distinct
tastes may be represented topographically, this representation may
not be uniform from one subject to another. If so, then a taste topography may not be observable at the group level but may be revealed
in individuals scanned on different days.
In contrast to topographical models, many neurophysiology
studies in rodents and primates have provided evidence for some
form of a combinatorial coding model. These studies report that the
neurons in gustatory cortex are responsive to a complex variety of
orosensory, viscerosensory, and motor signals, with relatively few
neurons responsive solely to taste (Scott and Plata-Salamn, 1999;
Scott and Giza, 2000). Indeed, in primates, most taste-responsive
neurons appear to be broadly tuned to multiple tastes, and there
appears to be no observable topographic organization for specific
tastes (Scott et al., 1991). If, as these primate studies suggest, (Scott
and Plata-Salamn, 1999; Kaskan et al., 2018), insula gustatory regions are broadly responsive to multiple tastes, taste-specific neural responses might be discernable within those regions using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) techniques (Kriegeskorte et al.,
2006). In fact, some evidence for this possibility in the human brain
has recently been reported (Chikazoe et al., 2019).
To distinguish between these competing models, we examined
taste-evoked hemodynamic responses within the human brain using
ultra-high resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
at high magnetic field strength (7-Tesla). During scanning, participants tasted sweet, salty, sour and tasteless (control) liquids, delivered via a custom-built MRI-compatible tastant-delivery system.
To identify brain regions exhibiting shared and distinct responses
for each taste, we employed both standard univariate analyses as
well as multivariate analysis techniques to examine distributed activation patterns across multiple brain voxels.

2 METHODS
2.1 Participants
18 subjects (11 female) between the ages of 22 and 48 (Average:
27 years). Ethics approval for this study was granted by the NIH
Combined Neuroscience Institutional Review Board under protocol
number 10-M-0027. The institutional review board of the National
Institutes of Health approved all procedures, and written informed
consent was obtained for all subjects. Participants were excluded
from taking part in the study if they had any history of neurological
injury, known genetic or medical disorders that may impact the results of neuroimaging, prenatal drug exposure, severely premature
birth or birth trauma, current usage of psychotropic medications, or
any exclusion criteria for MRI.

2.2 Experimental Design
All scanning was performed at the NIH Clinical Center in
Bethesda, MD. Participant sessions began with a taste assessment
performed within the 7T scanner itself, but prior to the beginning
of the scan session. This was done to ensure that ratings were obtained as close in time as possible to the scan itself, without any
effects of differing environmental context between the testing and
scanning session. The taste assessment was followed by a high resolution anatomical reference scan and a functional MRI session,

during which they performed our Taste Perception task. Five participants returned for a second session where they once again completed the Taste Perception task. The time between these sessions
varied from 6 to 98 days (average 34 days).

2.2.1 Taste Stimuli
Participants received four tastant solutions during scanning and the
pre-scan taste assessment: Sweet (0.6M sucrose), Sour (0.01M citric acid), Salty (0.20M NaCl), and Neutral (2.5mM NaHCO3 +
25mM KCl). To reduce within-subject variability, all participants
received tastants at the same molar concentration. The specific concentrations used for this study were derived from median concentrations used in previous neuroimaging studies of taste perception,
compiled in previous neuroimaging meta-analyses (Veldhuizen et
al., 2011; Yeung et al., 2017). All tastants were prepared using sterile lab techniques and USP-grade ingredients by the NIH Clinical
Center Pharmacy.

2.2.2 Gustometer Description
A custom-built pneumatically-driven MRI-compatible system delivered tastants during fMRI-scanning (Simmons et al., 2013b; Avery et al., 2015; 2017; 2018), see Figure 1. Tastant solutions were
kept at room temperature in pressurized syringes and fluid delivery
was controlled by pneumatically-driven pinch-valves that released
the solutions into polyurethane tubing that ran to a plastic gustatory manifold attached to the head coil. The tip of the polyethylene mouthpiece was small enough to be comfortably positioned
between the subjects teeth. This insured that the tastants were always delivered similarly into the mouth. The pinch valves that released the fluids into the manifold were open and closed by pneumatic valves located in the scan room, which were connected to
a stimulus delivery computer, which controlled the precise timing
and quantity of tastants dispensed to the subject during the scan.
Visual stimuli for behavioral and fMRI tasks were projected onto a
screen located inside the scanner bore and viewed through a mirror
system mounted on the head-coil. Both visual stimulus presentation and tastant delivery were controlled and synchronized via a
custom-built program developed in the PsychoPy2 environment.

2.2.3 Taste Assessment
During blocks of the taste assessment task, the word Taste appeared
on the screen for 2.5s, and subjects received 0.5mL of either a
sweet, sour, salty, or neutral tastant (Figure 1b). Next, the word
swallow appeared on the screen for 2.5s, prompting subjects to
swallow the tastant. Following this, subjects were asked to indicate,
using a hand-held response box, A) the identity of the tastant they
received, by selecting it from one of four possible options (sweet,
sour, salty, or neutral) presented on the screen B) the pleasantness
of the taste on a 0 (not pleasant at all) to 10 (extremely pleasant)
scale, and C) the intensity of the taste, on a 0 (not intense at all) to
10 (extremely intense) scale. Subjects provided ratings via a handheld fiber optic response box (Current Designs, Philadelphia, PA).
Rating periods were self-paced, average of 3s for rating trials and
2s for identification trials. Following these rating periods, the word
wash appeared on the screen and subjects received 1.2mL of the
neutral tastant, to rinse out the preceding taste. This was followed
by another (2.5s) prompt to swallow. A five-second fixation period
separated successive blocks of the taste assessment task. Tastants

angle = 55 degrees, voxel size = 1.2 1.2 1.2 mm3). A Multi-Band
factor of 2 was used to acquire data from multiple slices simultaneously. A GRAPPA factor of 2 was used for in-plane slice acceleration along with a 6/8 partial Fourier k-space sampling. Each
slice was oriented in the axial plane, with an Anterior-to-Posterior
phase encoding direction. The scan window did not achieve full
brain coverage though, and data was not acquired from areas at
the top of the frontal and parietal lobes, as well as the very bottom of the cerebellum. See Figure 2a and 2c for boundaries of EPI
scan window at subject and group level. Prior to task scans, a 1minute EPI scan was acquired with the opposite phase encoding
direction (Posterior-to-Anterior), which was used for correction of
spatial distortion artifacts during preprocessing (see Image Preprocessing). An ultra-high resolution MP2RAGE sequence was used
to provide an anatomical reference for the fMRI analysis (TE =
3.02 ms, TR = 6000 ms, flip angle = 5 degrees, voxel size = 0.70
0.70 0.70 mm).
2.3.1 Image Preprocessing

A) During scanning, participants tasted sweet, salty, sour and tasteless liquids, delivered via a custom-built MRI-compatible tastant-delivery system.
B) While in the scanner, but prior to fMRI scanning, subjects rated the identity, pleasantness, and intensity of each taste solution. During the fMRI task,

were presented five times each (20 blocks total), in random order.
Altogether, this session lasted between five to ten minutes.
2.2.4 Taste Perception task
During the Taste Perception fMRI task (Figure 1c), the word Taste
appeared on the screen for 2.5s, and subjects received 0.5mL of
either a sweet, sour, salty, or neutral tastant. Next, the word swallow appeared on the screen for 2.5s, prompting subjects to swallow.
These taste and swallow periods occurred four times in a row, with
the identical tastant delivered each time. Following these four periods, the word wash appeared on the screen and subjects received
1.2mL of the neutral tastant, to rinse out the preceding tastes. This
was followed by another (2.5s) prompt to swallow. In total, these
taste delivery blocks lasted 25 seconds. Participants were not instructed to perform any ratings during the scanning session. Nor
were they asked the identity, pleasantness, or intensity of the tastants. Previous research has identified that the insula is particularly
sensitive to attentional orientation (Veldhuizen et al., 2007; Simmons et al., 2013a; Avery et al., 2015; 2017), and taste activity patterns vary significantly within the insula, according to task context
(Bender et al., 2009). Following taste delivery blocks, a fixation
cross + appeared on the screen for 15 seconds. Two sweet, salty,
sour, and neutral taste delivery blocks (16 total) were presented in
random order throughout each run of this task. Each run lasted 325
seconds (5min25sec). Participants completed 8 runs of the Taste
Perception task during one scan session.
2.3 Imaging Methods
fMRI data was collected at the NIMH fMRI core facility at the NIH
Clinical Center using a Siemens 7T-830/AS Magnetom scanner and
a 32-channel head coil. Each volume consisted of 68 1.2-mm axial
slices (echo time (TE) = 23 ms, repetition time (TR) = 2500 ms, flip

All fMRI pre-processing was performed in AFNI
(http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni). The FreeSurfer software package (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) was additionally used for
skull-stripping the anatomical scans. A de-spiking interpolation
algorithm (AFNIs 3dDespike) was used to remove transient signal
spikes from the EPI data, and a slice timing correction was then
applied to the volumes of each EPI scan. The EPI scan acquired in
the opposite (P-A) phase encoding direction was used to calculate
a non-linear transformation matrix, which was used to correct for
spatial distortion artifacts. All EPI volumes were then registered
to the very first EPI volume using a 6-parameter (3 translations, 3
rotations) motion correction algorithm, and the motion estimates
were saved for use as regressors in the subsequent statistical
analyses. Volume registration and spatial distortion correction
were implemented in the same non-linear transformation step, in
order to minimize the number of interpolation steps performed
on EPI data. For univariate analyses, smoothing with a 2.4mm
(i.e. 2-voxel width) full width at half maximum Gaussian kernel
was used to enhance image signal-to-noise ratio. Importantly, the
core univariate results (see Figures 3 and 4) were not qualitatively
different when examined with no spatial smoothing applied. No
spatial smoothing was used for multivariate analyses. Finally, the
signal intensity for each EPI volume was normalized to reflect
percent signal change from each voxels mean intensity across the
time-course.
Anatomical scans were first co-registered to the EPI scans and
were then spatially normalized to Talairach space via a non-linear
transformation implemented in AFNIs 3dQwarp. These non-linear
transformation matrices were then used to register the subject-level
statistical maps to Talairach atlas space.
In addition to volume registration, motion-censoring algorithms were also implemented to guard against potential artifactual confounds induced by uncontrolled subject motion. Briefly, the
Euclidean-normalized derivative of the subjects motion parameters
was calculated for each TR, and a list of time points was created
in which that value was greater than 0.3 (roughly 0.3mm motion).
The TRs within this list were then censored during the subjectlevel regression analysis. Additionally, any subject with an average
Euclidean-normalized derivative of greater than 0.3 during any of
the tasks was excluded from the group-level analysis. Three subjects were thus excluded from the original group of 21 subjects,
due to excessive head motion, leaving 18 subjects.

sour), we identified brain voxels where activity for that taste was
greater than both other tastes, as well as the neutral tastant. For example, to be considered as sweet-selective the voxels would need to
exhibit a significantly greater response to sweet versus sour, versus
salty, and versus neutral. We performed these conjunction analyses at the level of individual subjects as well, separately correcting
the statistical contrast maps that went into each conjunction using
a voxel-wise FDR correction. In a less stringent approach to identifying differences between tastes at the group level, we also used the
AFNI program 3dANOVA2 to identify a main effect of taste from
among the three tastants (i.e. sweet, salty, and sour).

Functional MRI data was acquired at ultra-high voxel resolution (1.2mm x
1.2mm x 1.2mm) at high magnetic field strength (7-Tesla). A) Echo-planar
images (EPI) were acquired in 68 axial slices, in a scan window that ranged
from the top of the cingulate gyrus (superiorly) to the tip of the temporal
pole (inferiorly). B) Anatomical images were transformed to Talairach atlas
space using a high-fidelity non-linear warp. C) Average temporal signalto-noise ratio (TSNR) of unblurred EPI images, within a mask constructed
from the intersection of EPI scan windows for all subjects, after non-linear
transformation to Talairach space.

The EPI data collected during the Taste Perception task were
analyzed at the subject level using multiple linear regression models in AFNIs 3dDeconvolve. The regression model included one
regressor for each tastant block (sweet, salty, sour, and neutral) and
one regressor for wash/swallow events. These regressors were constructed by convolution of a gamma-variate hemodynamic response
function with a boxcar function having a 20-second width (5 for
wash/swallow events) beginning at the onset of each trial period.
The regression model also included regressors of non-interest to account for each runs mean, linear, quadratic, and cubic signal trends,
as well as the 6 normalized motion parameters (3 translations, 3 rotations) computed during the volume registration preprocessing.

2.4 Imaging Analyses
To evaluate between the competing models of taste representation, we performed both univariate and multivariate analyses on
data from the Taste Perception task. For the univariate analyses,
we sought to identify brain areas exhibiting both shared and distinct activation for each taste. We used the subject-level beta coefficient maps to perform group-level random-effects analyses, using
the AFNI program 3dttest++. All group-level contrast maps created
(sweet vs. sour, sweet vs. salty, salty vs. sour, and each taste vs.
neutral) were separately corrected for multiple comparisons using
non-parametric permutation tests, as described below.
Firstly, to identify brain areas exhibiting shared activation for
each taste, we used the statistical contrast, all taste (sweet, salty,
and sour) vs. neutral. Secondly, to identify brain voxels exhibiting
specific taste preferences, we performed a series of conjunctions of
our taste contrast maps. For each of our tastes (sweet, salty, and

Our next analysis approach was to identify whether, within insula
regions broadly responsive to multiple tastes, taste-specific neural
responses might be discernable using multivariate pattern analysis
(MVPA) techniques. The analysis, based on a linear support-vectormachine approach, was trained and tested on subject-level regression coefficient maps obtained from the Taste Perception task, using leave-one-run-out cross-validation. These analyses were conducted using The Decoding Toolbox (Hebart et al., 2014). The insula regions-of-interest (ROIs) used for these analyses were created from the conjunction of sweet vs. neutral, sour vs. neutral, and
salty vs. neutral contrasts, each separately corrected for multiple
comparisons, as defined below.
At the whole-brain level, we ran a multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA), using a searchlight approach (Kriegeskorte et al.,
2006), which allowed us to identify the average classification accuracy of a multi-voxel searchlight centered on each voxel in the
brain. The MVPA analyses were again conducted using The Decoding Toolbox (Hebart et al., 2014), and results were tested in
AFNI. To generate these maps, a separate subject-level regression
model was applied to the EPI data, which modeled each of the
eight task runs separately, so that all task conditions would have
eight beta-coefficient maps for the purposes of model training and
testing. For every subject, we performed separate searchlight analyses for all three pairwise taste contrasts (sweet vs. sour, sweet vs.
salty, salty vs. sour). The output of each searchlight analysis was a
voxel-wise map of classification accuracy minus chance (50% for
pairwise comparisons).
To evaluate the classification results at the group level, we averaged those three pairwise comparison maps together, warped the
resulting map to Talairach atlas space, and applied a small amount
(2.4mm FWHM) of spatial smoothing to normalize the distribution of scores across the dataset. We then performed group-level
random-effects analyses using the AFNI program 3dttest++ and
applied a non-parametric permutation test to correct for multiple
comparisons.
To verify the specificity of those classification maps, we also
performed separate group-level voxel-wise corrected t-tests for
each of the pairwise taste contrasts and calculated the conjunction
of all three of those corrected maps.
2.4.2 Assessment of covariance with pleasantness ratings
We examined the relationship between fMRI activation to tastants
and participants self-reported pleasantness ratings of those tastants in two separate ways. Firstly, we included participants average pleasantness ratings for each of the tastant solutions (including the neutral solution) in the subject-level regression model, using amplitude modulation regression in AFNI, which varies the

Taste quality mapping in human brain
height of the predicted hemodynamic response by the height of
the associated behavioral covariate. In this case, the predicted response to tastant delivery varied as a function of subjects pleasantness ratings. The regression model also included regressors of noninterest, for motion, polynomial trend, and wash trials, as above.
We then performed group-level random-effects analyses on the resulting amplitude-modulated beta-coefficient maps using the AFNI
program 3dttest++. This first method allowed us to estimate the
amount of within-session variability accounted for by participants
pleasantness ratings.
Secondly, we performed a linear mixed-effects (LME) analysis at the group level, using the AFNI program 3dLME (Chen
et al., 2013). For this analysis, we provided the program with the
subject-level beta-coefficient maps for each tastant (including neutral), as well as subjects pleasantness ratings for each of those tastants. This analysis was used to estimate the amount of variability
accounted for by pleasantness ratings, across subjects. This method
also served as a means of removing the variance associated with
that effect from our standard univariate contrasts (i.e. sweet vs.
sour, sweet vs. salty, salty vs. neutral).

ventrally from this dorsal mid-insula area down the central insular sulcus, extending towards the ventral anterior insula. A separate cluster was located in the dorsal right anterior insula, located
in the fundus of the overlying frontal operculum, on the middle
short insular gyrus. Outside of the insula, we observed significant
activation in the bilateral post-central gyrus, approximately in the
tongue and mouth region of the motor strip, as well as bilateral regions of cerebellar lobule VI, regions associated with orosensory
and motor movements (Suzuki et al., 2003). Finally, we observed
activation for all tastes in a cluster of the right ventral thalamus,
in the approximate location of the gustatory thalamic nucleus (Figure 3a, Table 1). These results were obtained using non-parametric
multiple comparisons correction over the whole scan volume. In a
follow up analysis, we performed a conjunction of contrast maps
created by comparing each of the individual tastes vs. the tasteless
control. This conjunction identified bilateral regions of the dorsal
mid-insula and a region of the left somatosensory cortex (Figure
3b).

3.2.2 Taste Specificity Analyses
2.4.3 Permutation testing for multiple comparison correction
Multiple comparison correction was performed using AFNIs
3dClustSim (AFNI version 19.0.25, March 15, 2019), within a
whole-volume TSNR mask. This mask was constructed from the
intersection of the EPI scan windows for all subjects (after transformation to talairach space) with a brain mask in atlas space (Figure
2c). The mask was then subjected to a TSNR threshold, such that
all remaining voxels within the mask had an average un-smoothed
TSNR of 10 or greater. For one-sample t-tests, this program will
randomly flip the sign of individual datasets within a sample 10,000
times. This process generates an empirical distribution of clustersize at the desired voxel-wise statistical threshold (in this case,
p < 0.001). The clusters which survive correction are those that
are larger than 95% of the clusters within this empirical clustersize distribution. Permutation tests utilizing cluster size have been
demonstrated to accurately control false positive rates (see (Eklund
et al., 2016), for discussion).

3 RESULTS
3.1 Behavioral Results
Sweet, Salty, and Sour tastants did not differ in intensity (p > 0.10),
but each was rated more intense than the neutral tastant (p < 0.01).
The sweet tastant was rated as the most pleasant (p < 0.001), followed by the neutral tastant. The sour and sweet tastants did not
differ in pleasantness (p = 0.83). Average identification accuracy
was 93%(SD = 8%).

3.2 Imaging Results
3.2.1 Univariate Contrasts
All tastes compared to the tasteless control significantly activated
a bilateral region of the dorsal mid-insula, located in an area in the
fundus of the central insular sulcus and the overlying frontoparietal operculum (Figure 3a, Table 1). In the left insula, as well as
the right, to a lesser extent, activation for taste vs. neutral extended

A series of whole brain conjunction analyses was performed to
identify voxels within the brain that were preferentially activated
by each taste greater than both other tastes as well as the tasteless
control. After correction for multiple comparisons and voxel-wise
conjunction analysis, we did not identify any voxels within the insula or the wider brain exhibiting a significant preference for either
sweet, sour, or salty taste. This procedure was repeated using multiple voxelwise statistical thresholds with identical results (Figure 4a,
uncorrected maps presented for display purposes only). In another
analysis approach, we did not identify any regions of the brain that
exhibited a main effect of taste quality, after correction for multiple
comparisons.
At the subject-level, a similar series of taste specificity analyses identified distributions of voxels within the insula that exhibited a selective preference for specific tastes. However, the distribution of these voxels was not consistent across subjects, nor were
the dominant preferences in any consistent pattern (Figure 4b). To
identify whether these taste-selective responses reflected a consistent spatial organization at the subject-level, we brought back a subset of our subjects for a second session of the Taste Perception task
(N = 5). We observed that, within individual subjects, the patterns
of taste-selective responses identified via the conjunction analyses
did not remain consistent from day to day (Figure 4b).

3.2.3 MVPA Results
To identify whether taste-selective activity patterns are present
within insula regions broadly responsive to multiple tastes, we performed multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) using the mid-insula
ROIs identified above (Figure 3b). We were able to reliably classify between sweet, salty, and sour tastants within the bilateral dorsal mid-insula with an average accuracy of 60% (i.e. 10% above
chance; all pairwise p-values p < 0.001; see Figure 5a).
The multivariate searchlight analysis identified a number of
brain regions that exhibited significant, above chance classification accuracy for discriminating between tastes. Those regions included primary sensory areas such as bilateral regions of the dorsal
mid-insular cortex, somatosensory cortex, and piriform cortex. Additionally, we also were able to reliably classify between distinct
tastes within brain regions involved in affect and reward, including

A) All tastes (sweet, sour, and salty) reliably activated taste cortex in the dorsal mid-insula, as well as primary lingual somatosensory cortex and a region
of left ventral thalamus. Each of these regions has been previously identified as taste-responsive in prior human neuroimaging studies of taste (Small et al,
2010; Veldhuizen et al., 2011; Yeung et al., 2017). B) A conjunction of contrast maps for sweet, salty, and sour vs. neutral, separately corrected for multiple
comparisons, identifies the bilateral dorsal mid-insula as commonly activated by all tastes. C) The hemodynamic response within the bilateral dorsal midinsula, estimated using finite impulse response functions, closely tracks the delivery of tastants during tastant blocks. The average response to each taste within
the dorsal mid-insula is greater than the tasteless control, and this region exhibits no preferred activation for either taste.

mediodorsal thalamus, the dorsal striatum, and the subgenual prefrontal cortex (BA25) (see Figure 6a and Table 2 for a list of these
regions and descriptive and statistical data). In a complementary
analysis, we performed a conjunction of the pairwise classification
maps at the group level, each separately corrected for multiple comparisons. The conjunction analysis identified clusters within the bilateral mid-insula, left amygdala, and left piriform cortex (Figure
6b).

3.2.4 Pleasantness Analyses
We also attempted to identify the effect of self-reported pleasantness ratings on the hemodynamic response to tastants. We
performed both a group-level t-test of parametrically-modulated
hemodynamic response functions as well as a group-level linear
mixed-effects regression model. Neither approach was able to identify any brain regions exhibiting a reliable relationship between

significantly diminish the size of clusters present with our main
univariate contrast (i.e. taste vs. tasteless, Figure 3).

4 DISCUSSION

Figure 4. Conjunction analyses of taste contrasts provide no clear evidence of topographical organization.
A) At the group level, whole brain conjunctions of taste contrasts, using
corrected statistical contrasts, did not identify any voxels within the insula
or the wider brain exhibiting a significant preference for either sweet, sour,
or salty taste. B) Specificity maps from five subjects who were scanned on
two separate sessions. Not only did specificity maps vary greatly between
subjects, the patterns of taste-selective responses identified did not remain
consistent within individual subjects from day to day. Images above show
uncorrected specificity maps at low statistical threshold (p < 0.05).

Figure 5. Multivariate pattern analyses decode taste quality within primary taste cortex.
Multivariate pattern analyses run within the dorsal mid-insula, a region
broadly responsive to multiple tastes (Figure 3b) show high accuracy for
classifying between distinct tastes, as seen in A) pairwise classification accuracy plots and B) multi-class confusion matrices.

Prior evidence from optical imaging studies in rodent models has
suggested that tastes are represented in topographically distinct areas within the insular cortex (Chen et al., 2011). However, studies
in non-human primates instead have suggested that taste within the
insula is represented within populations of broadly tuned neurons,
without any clear spatial organization (Scott et al., 1999). Human
neuroimaging studies of taste to date have largely been conducted
using low-resolution functional neuroimaging methods, which may
not have the power to discriminate between distinct taste-specific
regions within insular taste cortex. In order to discriminate between
the competing topographical and combinatorial coding models, we
examined the spatial representation of multiple tastes within the human brain using ultra-high resolution fMRI at high magnetic field
strength. In agreement with previous human neuroimaging studies
of taste (Small, 2010; Veldhuizen et al., 2011; Yeung et al., 2017),
sweet, sour, and salty tastant solutions (vs. a tasteless solution) activated regions of the anterior and mid-insular cortex. However, we
did not observe any evidence that any region within the insula, or
in the rest of the brain, exhibited a clear preference for a specific
taste.
One previous fMRI study that examined taste representation
in the insula reported that patterns of taste-specific responses were
highly variable across subjects, but suggested that those patterns
were stable over time within subjects (Schoenfeld et al., 2004). To
examine this possibility of a stable individual-level topography, we
also examined the tastant responses of a subset of subjects which
were scanned during two separate sessions. Using the same type
of conjunction analyses we employed at the group level, we observed that the patterns of taste-specific responses were not only
highly variable across subjects, but within subjects as well. While
we were unable to rule out the possibility of a micro-scale organization of taste specific neurons within gustatory cortex, such as that
observed in previous studies of rodents (Chen et al., 2011), we find
little evidence for discrete topographical regions for specific tastes
in humans at the spatial scales observable with ultra-high resolution
fMRI.
However, using multivariate pattern analysis at those same
spatial scales, we were nonetheless able to discriminate between
the responses to distinct tastes within the insula. Using an MVPA
searchlight approach (Kriegeskorte et al., 2006), we identified that
the bilateral dorsal mid-insula reliably classified between distinct
tastes with an accuracy significantly greater than chance. These results support a model of insular functional organization wherein
taste quality is encoded by distinct spatial patterns within primary
gustatory regions of the insular cortex (Simon et al., 2006). These
activity patterns may be represented either in heterogenous pools of
neurons specialized for detecting specific tastes, by a combinatorial
population code within cortical neurons broadly tuned to multiple
tastes, or by some mixture of broadly-tuned and specialist neurons,
much like how taste is represented in the peripheral nervous system
(Roper and Chaudhari, 2017).
We also explored the possibility that any effect of taste response that we observed was simply due to differences in relative pleasantness of tastant solutions. We tested this possibility using two different approaches, one in which participants pleasantness ratings were used to account for trial-by-trial variance (i.e.

Figure 6. Multivariate pattern analyses decode taste quality within brain regions involved in taste perception and reward.
A) Several regions of the brain were identified using a multivariate searchlight analysis, trained to distinguish between sweet, salty, and sour tastes. Among
those regions were primary sensory regions for taste the bilateral dorsal mid-insula and smell the bilateral piriform cortex, as well as limbic regions involved in
affect and reward, such as the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, subgenual prefrontal cortex, and mediodorsal thalamus. B) A conjunction of separate searchlight

amplitude modulation regression) and one in which ratings were
used to account for any remaining variance at the group level. Neither approach provided evidence for an effect of participants’ selfreported pleasantness ratings upon the hemodynamic response to
tastes. Thus, within the parameters of this study, in which tastes
were only mildly pleasant or mildly aversive, variability in pleasantness did not account for a variability in taste response.
The actual location of the human primary gustatory area in
the insula has also been the subject of some controversy. Many researchers have argued that the far anterior region of the dorsal insula is the likeliest candidate, given the location of Area G in the
non-human primate insula (Rolls, 2016). However, numerous human neuroimaging studies over the past 15 years have implicated
the dorsal anterior insula as playing a more domain-general role
in cognition and attention (Kurth et al., 2010; Nelson et al., 2010),
and many consider the human anterior insula to be a newly developed cortical structure (Craig, 2009), perhaps due to the expansion
of language faculties in our species (Nieuwenhuys, 2012). The effects of task context, such as whether subjects identify or evaluate
a taste during scanning, have also been shown to affect the spatial
representation of that taste within the insula (Bender et al., 2009).
Nevertheless, a large number of human neuroimaging studies of
taste, incorporating multiple imaging modalities (Kobayakawa et
al., 1999; 2005; Veldhuizen et al., 2007), as well as cortical electrode stimulation studies in pre-surgical patients (Mazzola et al.,
2017), point to the mid-to-posterior dorsal insula as the location
of human primary gustatory cortex. In the present study, we identified regions of the dorsal mid-insula, anterior ventral insula, and
mid-anterior insula that exhibited a significant activation to taste vs.

tasteless solutions, consistent with meta-analyses of human neuroimaging studies (Veldhuizen et al., 2011; Yeung et al., 2017). Of
those regions, the bilateral dorsal mid-insula regions exhibited the
most consistent ability to discriminate between different tastant solutions, suggesting a focal role for the dorsal mid-insula in the primary sensory processing of taste.
One recent human neuroimaging study, which was acquired
using lower resolution fMRI (36.75mm3 at 3T; 8mm3 at 7T vs.
1.73mm3 for the present study) and within the context of a hedonic evaluation task, also provided evidence that multivariate methods could be used to classify tastes within the insula (Chikazoe
et al., 2019). In agreement with the results of Chikazoe and colleagues, we identified regions of the mid-insula that reliably classify between different tastes. In contrast to their results, however,
we identified other regions of the brain that exhibited spatial activity patterns that discriminated between different tastes. These regions included other cortical sensory regions such as the piriform
cortex, involved in olfactory processing (Sobel et al., 2000) as well
as regions involved in various aspects of food sensation and reward,
such as the bilateral amygdala, the orbitofrontal cortex, the dorsal
striatum, and the mediodorsal thalamus. These results suggest that
the presence of multivariate patterns supporting taste-specific information is not a unique feature of insular taste cortex, as previously
suggested (Chikazoe et al., 2019).
Notably, the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex and striatum are
all downstream regions in the taste pathway (Scott and PlataSalamn, 1999; Rolls, 2005), that receive primary (or secondary)
projections from gustatory cortex, and that play different roles in
food reward, aversion, and value based decision making (Kringel-

bach et al., 2003; Kringelbach, 2005; Rolls, 2005; Saez et al.,
2017). The involvement of the amygdala in the perception of basic
tastes has been demonstrated in patients undergoing amygdala resection, who exhibit increased sensitivity to sour taste and greater
perceived taste intensity (Small et al., 1997). The activity of the
amygdala, especially the central nucleus and basolateral amygdala, is strongly associated with conditioned taste aversion (Reilly
and Bornovalova, 2005). The OFC, in concert with the amygdala
and mediodorsal thalamus, are thought to represent the momentto-moment value of environment stimuli and sensory experiences,
informed by the bodys current state (Rudebeck and Murray, 2014).
As these regions play key roles in taste perception and normative
responses to food, the multivariate taste-specific patterns identified within them may reflect information related to the appetitive
or aversive components of these tastant solutions.

4.1 Conclusion
We set out to distinguish between two competing theories of taste
representation in the insula using ultra-high resolution fMRI at high
magnetic field strength. We identified a strong overlap in the activity for all three tastes in previously identified gustatory regions of
the insula. We did not identify any regions within the insula or the
wider brain that exhibited a preference for specific tastes. However,
we were able to decode taste identity in a consistent manner within
primary gustatory insula and other brain regions associated with
food perception and reward. This suggests that taste quality exists
in a distributed pattern across multiple voxels within gustatory cortex, potentially resulting from a combinatorial code among popu-
