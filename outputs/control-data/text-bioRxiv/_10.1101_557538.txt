Abstract:
Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease driven by the accumulation of pro-inflammatory,
lipid-loaded macrophages at sites inside artery walls. These accumulations lead to the development
of atherosclerotic plaques. The rupture of plaques that contain lipid-rich necrotic cores can trigger
heart attacks and strokes via occlusion of blood vessels. We construct and analyse a system of
partial integro-differential equations that model lipid accumulation by macrophages, including
generating apoptotic cells and a necrotic core. The model includes the following cell behaviours:
recruitment of macrophages into the plaque; macrophage ingestion of low density lipoproteins
LDL and of apoptotic cells and necrotic material; lipid offloading to high density lipoproteins
(HDL); macrophage emigration; and macrophage apoptosis and necrosis of apoptotic cells. With
this model, we study how changes in parameters predict the characteristic features of plaque
pathology. In particular, we find the qualitative form of lipid distribution across the macrophage
population and show that high lipid loads can occur in the absence of LDL ingestion. We also
demonstrate the importance of macrophage emigration in the model in mitigating and resolving
inflammation and plaque lipid accumulation.

Atherosclerosis and the role of lipid accumulation in
macrophages

Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the artery wall [1–4]. Inflammation occurs at
sites inside the artery wall where modified low-density lipoproteins (LDL) accumulate after entering the wall from the bloodstream [5]. The immune response attracts circulating monocytes into
such sites [6–8]. After crossing the endothelium (the layer of cells that line the lumen of the blood
vessel) the monocytes enter the blood vessel wall and typically differentiate into macrophages that
clear LDL via phagocytosis [9]. As the macrophages accumulate internalised lipid, they produce
inflammatory signals that promote further monocyte recruitment [10, 11]. In this way, persistent
LDL and monocyte influx into the artery wall produce large numbers of lipid-laden macrophages.
This positive feedback creates a nonresolving inflammatory response [12] that thickens and expands the artery wall, to produce an atherosclerotic plaque. Plaques may continue to grow over
the course of a lifetime and amass a build up of lipid-rich necrotic debris (called the necrotic core)
via necrotic cell death of live and apoptotic macrophages [4, 13–15]. Plaques may rupture due
to artery wall deterioration leading to the release of thrombotic (blood-clot forming) material. If
these blood clots block arteries then they may cause heart attacks or strokes.
The intensity of inflammation, in general, depends on the number of LDL particles and macrophages inside the artery wall. The number of monocyte-derived macrophages inside the plaque
(of the order of 106 cells) is determined by the balance [9] between rapid monocyte recruitment
(of the order of 105 cells per day) [6–8], macrophage proliferation [16, 17], rapid programmed cell
death (apoptosis) (of the order of a day to a week) [14] and/or emigration of macrophages out of
the artery wall [18, 19]. Macrophages accumulate lipid via phagocytosis of both LDL and apoptotic cells. (Efferocytosis refers to phagocytosis of apoptotic cells.) LDL phagocytosis introduces
lipid into the macrophage population whereas efferocytosis recycles and concentrates lipid that is
already present in the macrophage population. Macrophages can offload cholesterol to high-density
lipoproteins (HDL) [20, 21] and emigrating macrophages ferry their accumulated lipid out of the
plaque [18]. Macrophages store accumulated internalised lipid in benign cytoplasmic lipid droplets
(which gives them a ”foamy” appearance) and will eventually accumulate cholesterol in the cell
membranes and in the cytoplasm as crystals [22]. In this state, macrophages display elevated levels
of inflammatory signalling, [23], apoptosis [24, 25] and may undergo necrotic cell death [26].
Most macrophages enter the plaque via monocyte recruitment and eventually undergo apoptosis. A study of myocardial infarction estimated that roughly 10% of macrophages emigrated
from the inflamed tissue [8]. Thus, when cell numbers remain stable, apoptotic macrophages are
produced almost as rapidly as monocytes enter the plaque. Rapid clearence of apoptotic cells
(efferocytosis) prevents postapoptotic necrosis [14, 15, 27]; inefficient efferocytosis can lead to the
accumulation of lipid-laden apoptotic macrophages and large amounts of cell necrosis [15]. Cell
necrosis causes the release of lipid-rich cell contents into the extracellular space. This extracellular

pool of thrombogenic and lipid-rich necrotic debris forms the necrotic core of the plaque. Large
macrophage numbers and large necrotic cores are hallmarks of symptomatic plaques [4, 13].
There is increasing interest in mathematical modelling of the immunology of atherosclerotic
plaques due to the dynamic nature of inflammatory macrophage populations [9]. Many mathematical models divide the macrophage population into ”macrophage” and ”foam cells”. This is true
in ODE models [28], spatially resolved PDE models [29–31] and other computational models [32].
Yet it is clear that there is a continuous distribution of lipid loads across macrophage populations,
stretching from monocytes with low lipid loadings and macrophages that can be labelled as foam
cells in atherosclerotic plaques. The variation in lipid load across a population of macrophages
suggests that it may be instructive to develop structured models in which the macrophages are
characterised by their intracellular lipid load similar to adipocytes [33].
In this paper we develop and analyse such a mathematical model, explicitly accounting for
lipid accumulation by monocyte-derived macrophages and its impact on the size and structure of
the macrophage population and the generation of necrotic material in the plaque. At the heart of
our model is a state variable which represents the quantity of lipid contained by monocyte-derived
macrophages; this state variable plays a similar role to age in age-structured population models and
size in size-structured models [34–37]. Applying principles of mass conservation yields a coupled
system of time-dependent, non-local, partial integro-differential equations (PDE) that describe how
the number of macrophages within the plaque and their lipid content change over time. The model
resolves the dynamic interplay between monocyte recruitment, LDL phagocytosis, lipid accumulation by macrophages and apoptotic macrophages, macrophage apoptosis, macrophage emigration,
efferocytosis of apoptotic cells, and necrosis of live and apoptotic macrophage. Our model predicts
how the balance of these cellular processes influences the development of inflammatory states in
atherosclerosis and, in particular, the accumulation of high numbers of macrophages with high
intracellular lipid loads, and necrotic debris (Figure 1).
The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. In section 2 we derive the general form
of our model. It incorporates cellular processes which are known to play a significant role in the
dynamics of lipid and macrophages, apoptotic cells and necrotic material within plaques. After
nondimensionalising the governing equations, we present time-dependent numerical simulations.
In section 3 we determine steady state solutions of the model and show how the distribution of
internalised lipid across the macrophage population changes as the balance between macrophage
immigration, efferocytosis, emigration, apoptosis and necrosis changes. In this way we reveal the
subtle interplay between these processes and how their balance can be physiologically, pathologically or therapeutically altered to drive plaque pathogenesis or resolution. We also examine a
special case for which there is no LDL (exogenous lipid) for macrophages to ingest but where efferocytosis of apoptotic cells cause macrophages to accumulate endogenous lipid derived from the
membranes of macrophages that have since died and have been consumed. This special case could

to foam cell that spontaneously form in inflammatory macrophage populations [10]. Finally, in
section 4, we discuss our results and draw conclusions.

Model development
Model framework

We assume that the plaque is a dynamic mixture of live, apoptotic and necrotic macrophages and,
for simplicity, spatial effects are neglected. Let m(a, t) ∈ R, m(a, t) ≥ 0 and p(a, t) ∈ R, p(a, t) ≥ 0
represent the number density in the plaque of live and apoptotic macrophages respectively with
lipid content a ∈ R, a ≥ 0 at time t ∈ R. Let a0 be the endogenous lipid content of macrophages
so that a ≥ a0 . That is, a0 represents the quantity of lipid in the cell’s membranes and other
structures that is intrinsic to the cell itself and has not been accummulated by the macrophage
ingesting other cell or lipids. Let N (t) ∈ R, N (t) ≥ 0 represent the quantity of lipid in the necrotic
core. Since necrotic material is acellular, N (t) is a function of t only. In constructing the model it
will be useful to note that the total number of macrophages, M (t), and apoptotic cells, P (t), are
given by:
Z ∞
Z ∞
M (t) =
m(a, t) da and P (t) =
p(a, t) da .

We will also use the total lipid load of all macrophages, AM (t), and of all apoptotic cells, AP (t),
given by the first moments of m(a, t) and p(a, t) respectively:
Z ∞

AM (t) =
a m(a, t) da and AP (t) =

In this subsection we present the model equations in terms of the cellular processes that govern
the time evolution of m(a, t), p(a, t) and N (t). The functional forms used to model these processes
are outlined in subsequent subsections.
Our mathematical model comprises a system of two partial differential equations and one

In equations (3)-(5), A, A0 , C 0 , E, E 0 , E 00 , G, R, S and S 0 represent source and sink terms that
drive changes in the distributions of live and apoptotic macrophages and the amount of necrotic
material within the plaque.

The terms appearing in the advection term on the left hand side of equation (3) model
processes which alter the lipid load of macrophages incrementally due to uptake of LDL (at rate
L), offloading intracellular lipid to HDL (at rate H) and lipid uptake due to phagocytosis of
necrotic material (at rate C).
Macrophage lipid loads also change when a macrophage ingests an apoptotic cell (efferocytosis). In this model, we assume that macrophages ingest whole apoptotic cells and acquire the
entire lipid content of the apoptotic cell. In mathematical terms, efferocytosis produces non-local
change as the lipid content, a, of the consumer cell increases instantaneously by a finite amount
equivalent to the lipid content of the consumed apoptotic cell. In equation (3) E represents the
rate at which macrophages of lipid load a are created through efferocytosis while E 0 represents the
rate at which macrophages of lipid load a move to a higher load through efferocytosis. The term
E 00 in equation (4) represents the rate at which apoptotic cells with lipid content a are removed
via efferocytosis.
In equation (3), macrophages are assumed to enter the plaque by crossing the endothelium
and arriving in the artery wall at a rate R. We also assume that macrophages emigrate out of the
artery wall at rate G and undergo apoptosis at rate A. We remark that the sink of live macrophages
due to apoptosis in equation (3) is balanced by the source term A0 in equation (4) for apoptotic
cells.
Apoptotic cells that are not ingested by macrophages become necrotic at rate S and act as
a source of lipid flowing into the necrotic core at rate S 0 . Material in the necrotic core is ingested
and cleared by macrophages at rate C 0 .
In the next section, we introduce functional forms for each of these rates.

Specifying the functional forms for the model processes
Lipid flux into and out of macrophages via LDL and HDL (L and H)

We suppose that serum entering into the artery wall at a fixed rate σ (unit volume per unit time)
contains fixed concentrations of LDL and HDL which we denote by `e and e
h (particles per unit
volume) respectively. We further assume that LDL particles contain a fixed amount of lipid `0
(lipid molecules per LDL particle), that they rapidly become modified once inside the artery wall
(e.g. by oxidation) and are consumed by macrophages at a constant rate ω (per cell per unit time).
Let `(t) be the number of LDL particles in the tissue at time t. If we assume that macrophages
consume LDL at a rate proportional to the availability of LDL and independent of macrophage
lipid load, then the change in `(t) is given by
d`
= σ `e − ω`(t)M (t) .

(6)

Rates of LDL ingestion occur on the scale of minutes-to-hours whereas rates of macrophage apoptosis occur on the scale of days-to-weeks [8, 38]. We assume that changes in ` occur over a
much shorter timescale than the timescale of the cell dynamics such that changes in cell numbers

If we assume that the rate at which macrophages ingest lipid from LDL is proportional to the
number of LDL particles in the tissue and the lipid load of each particle, then, from equation (7),
we have that the total rate of lipid influx into each macrophage via LDL ingestion in equation (3)
is:

Once inside the artery wall, HDL particles take up lipid (principally cholesterol) from macrophages. We assume that macrophages offload lipid to HDL particles at a fixed rate ξ (lipid
molecules per cell per HDL particle per unit time). If h0 (lipid molecules per HDL particle) is the
lipid capacity of an HDL particle then the time taken for a HDL particle to be filled with lipid is
h0 /(ξM (t)) (unit time); assuming all macrophages have accumulated lipid to offload. If we assume
that HDL particles become fully loaded with lipid before leaving the artery wall then the number
of HDL particles h(t) inside the artery wall is modelled by:

As we assume that individual macrophages offload lipid to HDL at a rate proportional to the

the net rate at which macrophages take up lipid from lipoproteins depends on the total number of

2.2.2

Monocyte recruitment from the vasculature

The recruitment of monocytes across the endothelium and into the artery wall is driven by cytokines
such as interleukin 1 (IL-1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), that are produced
by macrophages in response to lipid ingestion or high lipid loads [39, 40]. Once in the plaque,
monocytes differentiate into macrophages.
We assume in the following derivation that there is only one generic cytokine, concentration c.
We neglect cytokine production from other sources such as T-cells and necrotic or apoptotic cells.
We assume that this cytokine is produced at rate f (a) (per cell per unit time) by macrophages
with lipid load a. In general, f (a) is an increasing function of a. We also suppose that the
cytokine degrades and/or leaves the system at rate ζ (per unit time). The time evolution of c(t)
can therefore be modelled by the following integro-DE:
Z ∞
d
c(t) =
f (a) m(a, t) da − ζc .
(13)
dt
a0
If the timescales on which cytokines are produced and degraded are much shorter than the timescale
i
on which macrophage levels change, then as before we may assume that dc
≈ 0 in which case
dt
equation (13) gives:
Z
1 ∞
c=
f (a) m(a, t) da .
(14)
ζ a0
We assume that the rate of monocyte influx into the artery wall (that is, the recruitment
rate) is a saturating function of c. Let α (cells per unit time) be the maximum recruitment rate
and K be the cytokine level at which the recruitment rate is half maximal. Then the rate of
monocyte recruitment is given by:
R∞
α a0 f (a) m(a, t) da
c
R∞
=
monocyte recruitment rate = α
,
(15)
K +c
κ + a0 f (a) m(a, t) da
where κ = Kζ. For n cytokines with concentrations ci , 1 ≤ i ≤ n, a similar analysis produces a
similar recruitment function with the interpretation of κ and f (a) suitably adjusted.
For simplicity, we now assume that macrophages produce cytokines at a rate proportional to
their accumulated lipid content so that f (a) = a − a0 . If we assume further that monocytes enter
the system with a fixed amount of endogenous lipid a = a0 then using equation (15) we arrive at
the following functional form for R, the rate of recruitment of monocytes in equation (3):
R∞
α 0 (a − a0 )m(a, t) da
α(AM (t) − a0 M (t))
R∞
= δ(a − a0 )
,
(16)
R = δ(a − a0 )
κ + AM (t) − a0 M (t)
κ + 0 (a − a0 )m(a, t) da
where δ is the Dirac delta function and M (t) and AM (t) are defined in equations (1) and (2). We
remark that this source term can alternatively be cast as a boundary condition at a = a0 . In
all subsequent analysis, monocyte recruitment will be incorporated via a boundary condition at
a = a0 .

2.2.3

Macrophage apoptosis (A and A0 )

We suppose that macrophages undergo apoptosis at a constant rate β (per unit time) and produce
equal numbers of apoptotic cells with equal lipid content so that:
apoptosis

m(a, t) −−−−−→ p(a, t) ,
β

(17)

and the functional forms for A and A0 in equation (3) and (4) are:
A = A0 = βm(a, t) .
2.2.4

(18)

Emigration of macrophages from the artery wall (G)

We assume that live macrophages emigrate from the artery wall at rate γ (per unit time) independently of their lipid content. In this case, the emigration sink term G in equation (3) is:
G = γm(a, t) .

(19)

We emphasise that migrating cells remove cellular lipid from the artery wall and, as a result,
emigration plays a key role in determining the overall lipid burden in the plaque and, in particular,
the size of the necrotic core.
2.2.5

Efferocytosis (E, E 0 and E 00 )

We assume that apoptotic macrophages are typically consumed whole by live macrophage via
efferocytosis. Efferocytosis transfers the lipid contents of an apoptotic cell, including its endogenous
lipid, to the live macrophage that consumes it. We suppose that live macrophages consume
apoptotic cells at a constant rate η, independent of the lipid contents of the apoptotic and live
cells. We assume further that, when live macrophages with lipid content a consume apoptotic cells
with lipid content a0 , a more heavily loaded live macrophage with lipid content a + a0 is produced.
Thus, we have:
efferocytosis

m(a, t) + p(a0 , t) −−−−−−→ m(a + a0 , t) for a ≥ a0 and a0 ≥ a0 .
η

(20)

Since macrophages ingest apoptotic cells with lipid load a0 ∈ (a0 , ∞) the rate E 0 at which live
macrophages with lipid load a are lost due to efferocytosis is:
Z ∞
0
E =η
m(a, t) p(a0 , t) da0 = ηm(a, t)P (t) .
(21)
a0

Macrophages that are removed from the population with lipid load a following efferocytosis produce
macrophages with higher lipid loads. Thus the efferocytosis source term E in equation (3) is
modelled by a convolution between the number of live m(a, t) and apoptotic p(a, t) macrophages
with lipid content a0 and a − a0 respectively with a0 < a − a0 :
Z a−a0

The rate E 00 at which apoptotic cells with lipid load a are removed as a result of efferocytosis
is defined in a similar way so that:

2.2.6

Necrosis (S and S 0 )

If apoptotic cells are not consumed by macrophages, they will, eventually, undergo necrosis. Lipid
released from apoptotic cells into the extracellular space contributes to the lipid content of the
necrotic core. We assume that apoptotic cells undergo postapoptotic necrosis at rate ν (per unit
time) such that:
necrosis

ap(a, t) −−−−→ N (t) .
ν

(24)

Thus the necrosis sink term S in equation (4), is given by:
S = νp(a, t) ,

and the source term S 0 in equation (5) is:

2.2.7

Macrophage ingestion of necrotic material (C and C 0 )

We assume that the rate at which a macrophage ingests lipid from the necrotic core is proportional
to the amount of material in the core and independent of the macrophage lipid load. Hence, in
equation (3),
C = θN (t) .
(27)
The total rate at which the macrophage population ingests necrotic material is proportional to
the total number of macrophages and the amount of necrotic material and, so, in equation (5) we
define:
C 0 = θM (t)N (t) .
(28)
We remark that the functional forms used to define C and C 0 ensure conservation of mass of
necrotic material.

In what follows, it will be useful to keep track of the total quantity of lipid contained by live
macrophages AM (t) and apoptotic macrophages AP (t). Ordinary differential equations for AM (t)
and AP (t) can be found by multiplying equations (29) and (30) by a and integrating with respect
to a. Making the additional assumption that am(a, t) → 0 and ap(a, t) → 0 as a → ∞ we get:

Equations (31) and (34) to (37) together with their associated initial conditions are a closed
system of ODEs for M , P , AM , AP and N . These give information about the total macrophage
and apoptotic cell population size and total lipid loads as well as the size of the necrotic core. The
PDEs (29) and (30) for m(a, t) and p(a, t) provide detailed information about the distribution of
lipid loads across the population of live and apoptotic macrophages. From this distribution it is
possible to extract information pertaining to the degree of pathology of the plaque.

Nondimensionalising the model

We recast our model in dimensionless variables. We nondimensionalise time t by β −1 , the average
macrophage lifespan and nondimensionalise lipid content a with a0 , the endogenous lipid content
of each cell and denote dimensionless quantities with tildes, so that:
e
t ≡ βt ,

e
a ≡ a/a0 .

Parameters Λ, Φ, Ω and Γ play key roles in the analysis in the rest of the paper and have the
following physical interpretation:
• Parameter Λ ≥ 0 is the ratio of the rate of influx of LDL-derived (exogenous) lipid into the
macrophage population to the maximum rate of influx of monocyte-derived (endogenous)
f > 1 then we anticipate that most of the lipid
lipid into the macrophage population. If Λ/M
f < 1 then most internalised
inside the macrophages derives from LDL; conversely if Λ/M
lipid derives from apoptotic cells.
• The parameter Ω ≥ 1 governs the proportion of macrophages that undergo apoptosis (at
rate β) versus emigration out of the plaque (at rate γ). The proportion of macrophages that
β
γ
have an apoptotic fate is β+γ
= Ω1 and the proportion which emigrate is β+γ
= 1 − Ω1 .
• The model assumes that emigration and apoptosis are both independent of lipid load. Hence,
the average lipid content of the apoptotic cell or emigrating cell is given by the average
g
macrophage lipid content A
M which reflects the rate of LDL, necrotic debris and apoptotic
cell ingestion. A macrophage that dies via apoptosis produces one apoptotic cell that is
consumed by a live macrophage via efferocytosis (rate ηM ) or deposits its lipid content
into the necrotic core via postapoptotic necrosis (rate ν). Thus the proportion of apoptotic
f
ηM
M
macrophages that undergo efferocytosis is ηM
= ΦΦM
f+1 and the proportion that undergo
+ν
1
necrosis is ηMν+ν = ΦM
f+1 .
• The dimensionless parameter Γ governs the rate of saturation of the monocyte recruitment
rate function. It represents the quantity of accumulated lipid in the macrophage population

A numerical simulation of the time-dependent model

Time-dependent solutions to the model were obtained. Finite difference approximations were used
to generate numerical solutions to the governing equations. The midpoint method was used to
approximate equations (48)-(52) [41]. An upwinding scheme was used to solve equations (45) and
(46), which are first order hyperbolic partial differential equations [41].
To our knowledge, parameter values associated with atherosclerotic plaques in vivo are not
currently known and may vary markedly between individuals or even plaques. Here, guided by the
parameter estimates from [38], biologically plausible parameters values were chosen to simulate
four different plaque states illustrated in Figure 2. The chosen values and reasoning for each state
are as follows. To model a low-grade inflammatory state we chose a parameter set for which the
lipid gain per cell via LDL is slightly higher than the lipid removal per cell via HDL (Λ = 0.01),
macrophages are ten-times more likely to undergo apoptotic death than emigration from the plaque
(Ω − 1 = 0.1) [8] and the rate of efferocytosis is high relative to the rate of necrosis so that Φ = 100
which implies that postapoptotic necrosis is negligible. To model a severe inflammatory response
to elevated LDL levels in the serum, we increased Λ from Λ = 0.01 to Λ = 10 at time t = 200.
To model the onset of plaque pathology associated with reduced efferocytosis we reduced Φ from
Φ = 100 to Φ = 0.1 at time t = 400. To model plaque regression, we increased Ω from Ω = 1.1 to
Ω = 2 to reflect either an increased emigration rate and/or decreased apoptosis rate. Note that
only one parameter is change in value at a time; Φ and Ω hold their value when Λ increases in
value at t = 200, etc.
Figure 2 illustrates results from a numerical simulation of the nondimensional model given
by equations (45)-(52). As outlined above, parameters Λ, Φ and Ω change at times t = 200, 400
and 600 respectively while parameters Γ, Θ and Ξ are held constant. The top two plots of Figure
2 show how the number and average accumulated lipid content of live and apoptotic macrophages
change over time and also how the lipid content of the necrotic core evolves. High rates of LDL
ingestion rate, modelled by high values of Λ, lead to the appearance of large numbers of foam

cells which drive rapid monocyte recruitment into the tissue. Low efferocytosis rates (that is, low
values of Φ) promote postapoptotic necrosis and produce a necrotic core. Together, high rates of

LDL ingestion and low efferocytosis rates produce large numbers of postapoptotic foam cells and
a large lipid-rich necrotic core. High macrophage emigration rates, (high values of Ω) remove large
quantities of lipid from the system as lipid-loaded cells leave the plaque and, consequently, reduce
lipid accumulation inside macrophages and the necrotic core.
The bottom plot in Figure 2 shows changes in the lipid distribution across the macrophage
population (m(a, t)). For high rates of LDL ingestion, lipid is monotonically distributed across the
macrophage population. In this case, the extent of lipid accumulation and population heterogeneity
with respect to lipid content is large. By contrast, when LDL ingestion rates are low, the lipid
distribution is principally determined by phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and, as a result, has a
series of peaks, separated approximately by the amount of endogenous lipid in each cell.
In Figure 2 the timescale of interest is the average lifespan of a macrophage before it undergoes
apoptosis. We note, for the parameter values used here, that the system approaches a steady state
solution generally within a non-dimensional time span of 100 macrophage lifespans or less. In
inflamed tissues, the macrophage lifespan is on the order of days to weeks [6, 8] and so 100
macrophage lifespans might correspond to 0.5-2 years. Since plaques can exist for decades, this
suggests that it may be sufficient to study the steady state distribution of lipid in the live and
apoptotic macrophage populations.

Analysis and results

We assume that lipid loads, the numbers of live and apoptotic macrophages, and the lipid in the
necrotic core reach a steady state quickly, relative to the lifetime of the plaque and in the absence
of physiological changes. These changes might include an increased rate of LDL influx into the
plaque or decreased rate of efferocytosis. We examine the steady state solutions of equations (45)
to (52) where all time derivatives are set to zero. We first focus on the ODE system defined by
equations (48) to (52).

We assume that as t → ∞ the variables M (t), P (t), N (t), AM (t) and AP (t) approach steady
state values M ∗ , P ∗ , N ∗ , A∗M and A∗P respectively. Setting time derivatives to zero in equations
(48)-(52), we deduce that M ∗ , P ∗ , N ∗ and A∗P can be defined in terms of A∗M as follows:

cell numbers M ∗ (black line; top row), average accumulated lipid content A∗M (black line; bottom row), apoptotic
cell numbers P ∗ (coloured dots and dashes; top row) and lipid content of the necrotic core N ∗ *(coloured dots and
dashes; bottom row) for a range of Λ (x-axis), Ω (left to right plots) and Φ (colours). Here we have fixed Γ = 5.

Equations (54) and (55) are used to plot M ∗ , P ∗ , A∗M , A∗P and N ∗ in Figure 3 for various values
of parameters Λ, Ω and Φ and fixed Γ = 5.
For Λ > 0 and Ω > 1, equation (55) admits two real positive solutions: one solution has
∗
AM ≥ Γ and the other A∗M ≤ Γ . Since we require M ∗ ≥ 0 for physically real solutions, we reject
the solution with A∗M ≤ Γ. In the special case when Λ = 0, there are two solutions: A∗M = Γ
when Ω − 1 ≥ Γ1 or A∗M > Γ when Ω − 1 < Γ1 . The first solution gives M ∗ = 0 which implies
that the immune response does not exist when there is no net LDL ingestion and large numbers of
macrophages emigrate from the tissue. As Ω → 1 (no emigration) then the real solution A∗M → ∞
and M → 1 because without net lipid efflux from cells or cell emigration there is no mechanism
for lipid to leave the plaque and as a result, it progressively accumulates inside the macrophage
population.
Physically unrealistic (i.e. complex and/or negative) solutions may exist when Λ < 0; that
is, when HDL exports lipid from the cells at a faster rate than that at which it accumulates due to
LDL ingestion. In this case, cells are likely to have low lipid loads and so macrophage recruitment
and macrophage numbers will remain at low levels. This case, which represents healthy tissue, is
not of primary interest in this study and so we will henceforth assume that Λ > 0.

3.1.2

Pathological states

In our model, inflammation resolves only when lipid gained via LDL ingestion is less than lipid
removed via HDL (Λ ≤ 0) and when at least 20% (if Γ = 5) of all macrophages emigrate from the
tissue (as opposed to die in the tissue). Otherwise, a nonresolving inflammatory response occurs.
An atherosclerotic plaque is considered pathological and potentially harmful when it contains
large numbers of macrophages (say M ∗ > 0.9) with large lipid loads (say A∗M > 10) and a large
necrotic core (say N ∗ > 10) [13, 42, 43]. Suppose that the plaque is non-pathological/benign
when M ∗ , A∗M and N ∗ are all small. The pathological state arises in our model for large LDL
influx rates into the tissue (say Λ > 1), low emigration rates (say Ω − 1 < 0.2) and ineffective
efferocytosis (say Φ < 10). In this state, a large necrotic core forms when large numbers of
macrophage foam cells die via apoptosis and then undergo postapoptotic necrosis as a result of
defective efferocytosis. The non-pathological state in our model occurs only for low LDL influx
rates (Λ < 1), high emigration rates (Ω − 1 > 0.2) and high efferocytosis rates relative to the rate
of secondary necrosis (Φ > 10). In this state, macrophages clear LDL, apoptotic cells and necrotic
debris and ferry the lipid out of the plaque via cell emigration and HDL export. There are several
inflammatory states which are not necessarily pathological. For example, for large LDL influx
rates, low emigration rates and high efferocytosis rates, there can be large numbers of foam cells
(large M ∗ and A∗M ) without the presence of a necrotic core (small N ∗ ) as efficient efferocytosis
blocks postapoptotic necrosis. By contrast, for low efferocytosis rates, high LDL influx rates and
high emigration rates the necrotic core remains small because high macrophage emigration rates
prevents apoptosis and hence postapoptotic necrosis.

Λ (equations (54) and (55)). Parameter Ψ is the mean rate of influx of lipid into each macrophage
ΦM ∗

regardless of the value of Λ.

the cell emigration rate relative to the apoptosis rate is small (Ω < 1.1) and the efferocytosis rate
relative to necrosis rate is large (Φ > 10). That is during typical inflammatory responses where net
lipid uptake from LDL ingestion is negligible, when most macrophages die via apoptosis and most
apoptotic cells are consumed, the macrophage lipid load may have a single peak in each interval
n, a < n + 1.

Figure 6 shows that m∗ (a) has a monotonic profile when k12 + k1 k2 (2 − 21 ek1 +k2 ) + k22 > 0
(region (a) in Figure 6). These parameter values may correspond to either pathological or healthy
states. Figure 4 shows that k1 < 1 for large Ω which represents a resolving inflammatory response
where most macrophages emigrate from the tissue and macrophage recruitment is low so that
there are small numbers of macrophages (M ∗ ) with a small average lipid content (A∗M ). Figure 4
shows that k1 < 1 also for pathological inflammatory responses where LDL ingestion (Λ) is large
so that there are large numbers of macrophages (M ∗ ) with a large average lipid content (A∗M ). In
this case, Ω can take on a wider range of values, but Φ remains low. The low value of Φ could
be attributed to low rates of efferocytosis relative to necrosis which leads to the formation of a
large necrotic core. In summary, our model shows that the steady state distribution of lipid across
macrophages is closely linked to plaque pathology.

3.3

Special case: no LDL ingestion or lipid-offloading to HDL (Λ = 0)

Macrophage foam cell formation via extensive LDL ingestion is a unique feature of atherosclerotic
plaques. However, macrophage foam cells also commonly appear in chronic lesions that do not
contain modified LDL [10] Here, we show that efferocytosis alone, with no net ingestion of LDL
or lipid export to HDL, can cause macrophages to accumulate lipid derived from the membranes
of macrophages that have died and been consumed.
We suppose that there is no net LDL influx into the tissue and no net lipid export from
macrophages, so that Λ = 0. We further assume that the rate of phagocytosis (given by ηM in
the dimensional equations) is more rapid than the rate of apoptosis (β) and secondary necrosis
(ν) such that η  ν, β which, in terms of the nondimensional variables, implies ΦM  1. We
assume further that every apoptotic macrophage is consumed so that in the limit as ΦM → ∞
(given M > 0). If ΦM → ∞ then the nondimensional equations (46), (50) and (52) become:

and p = m .

Under this assumption apoptotic cells are ingested rapidly by live macrophages soon after
have undergone apoptosis. With these relations, equations (45), (49) and (51) become:

If macrophages do not ingest LDL, then they will only accumulate lipid in integer units of the
endogeneous quantity of lipid, which is a0 in dimensional terms and 1 in the nondimensional system.
(We are assuming here, of course, that all macrophages have an equal quantity of endogeneous
lipid.) Hence, on n ≤ a < n + 1, we set
m(a, t) = δ(a − n)mn (t) ,

(73)

where mn (t) is the proportion of macrophages at time t that contain n units of the endogenous lipid
content. We substitute equation (73) into equation (70) to produce the following Smoluchowski

where AM and M are given by equations (71) and (72). The fact that equation (74) and (75)
belongs to the family of Smoluchowski coagulation equations implies that efferocytosis causes endogenous lipid to accumulate inside macrophage populations via a coalescence (or coagulation)
process [45, 46]
We are primarily interested in the steady state solutions of equations (74) and (75) where
mn (t) → m∗n as t → ∞. By setting the time derivatives equal to zero in equations (71), (74) and
(75), we find that m∗n is given by the following recurrence relation:
m∗1 =

Ω

1+Ω

m∗n =

n−1
1 X ∗ ∗
m 0m 0 .
1 + Ω n0 =1 n n−n

(76)

Note equation (76) can also be derived from equation (61) in the limit k1 , k2 → ∞ and k2 /k1 → Ω
and when all derivatives with respect to a are equal to zero. By comparing equation (76) to the
recurrence relation that generates the Catalan numbers, we deduce that m∗n has following solution:
m∗n =

Ωn Cn−1
2n−1 ,
Ω+1

(77)

where Cn is the n-th Catalan number. In Figure 7 we use equation (77) to plot m∗n for various
values of Ω. In Figure 8 we use equations (66) and (8) to compare the continuous distribution
m∗ (a) from (66) with the discrete distributions m∗n where Λ = 0 from (8). From this figure it is
clear that efferocytosis drives, LDL phagocytosis exacerbates and cell emigration reduces excessive
lipid accumulation inside macrophages.
Figure 7 shows that for n  1, m∗n decays algebraically for Ω = 1 and exponentially for
Ω > 1. That is, the behaviour of m∗n is qualitatively different when Ω = 1 from its behaviour for
Ω > 1.

From equation (78) we conclude that, when Ω > 1, the decay in m∗n as n → ∞ is dominated by
the exponential term. When Ω = 1 (no cell emigration), m∗n decays algebraically. The qualitative
change in m∗ (a) as Ω → 1 indicates that only small rates of emigration are required to significantly
reduce the coalescence of accumulated lipid, suppress excessive lipid accumulation and remove
accumulated lipid from the population.

macrophages and the amount of necrotic material in an atherosclerotic plaque change with time.
The model couples lipid and inflammation dynamics to show, for the first time, how inflammation
shapes lipid accumulation inside macrophages and how this internalised lipid accumulation then
shapes inflammation. The model describes how lipid enters, leaves, accumulates and redistributes
inside inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages as these cell enter the tissue, take up LDL and
necrotic debris, offload lipid to HDL, die via apoptosis, consume apoptotic cells via efferocytosis
and leave the tissue.
By constructing steady state solutions to the governing equations, we are able to assess the
impact on plaque formation of known risk factors such as high levels of LDL cholesterol in blood
serum, high blood monocyte counts and inefficient phagocytosis by macrophages.
The model developed in this paper is focused on lipid and macrophage dynamics during
inflammation and in particular lipid accumulation by macrophages as a consequence of phagocytosis. It considers cellular dynamics within the artery wall rather than the interaction of the artery
wall with the bloodsteam or the mechanisms of cell and lipid perfusion through the blood vessel
wall. Because this is a simple, analytically tractable, foundational model, we do not include spatial
structure as, for example in [29]. Clearly there is scope to include internalised lipid structure in
macrophage in many different types models for atherosclerotic plaque development. The model
presented here is intended to generate understanding of the role and consequences of this type of
macrophage population structure. Ultimately many different models may be combined into more
comprehensive models of atherosclerotic plaque development. Models for specific processes and

species in the plaque also have the capacity to generate significant new insights on their own and
hence are valuable in their own right.
The key insights into atherosclerosis provided by our model are summarised in Figure 9.
During typical inflammatory responses, millions of monocyte-derived macrophages turn over daily,
primarily via monocyte recruitment (as opposed to cell division), apoptosis (as opposed to cell
emigration) and efferocytosis (as opposed to postapoptotic necrosis) [6, 8]. Lipid is introduced into
the tissue, not only via LDL influx, but, significantly, via monocyte recruitment which brings cells’
endogenous lipid into the plaque. Lipid that has ben internalised via phagocytosis is transferred
from one cell to another via efferocytosis of apoptotic cells.
Our model predicts that if lipid export and cell emigration are suppressed [10], then apoptosis
and efferocytosis can concentrate monocyte-derived lipid, that comes from endogenous lipid, to
extraordinarily large quantities inside the macrophage population via coalescence (Figures 7 and
8). In this way, macrophages with very high lipid loads may be produced independently of LDL.
This theory may explain why macrophage foam cells appear in numerous chronic inflammatory
conditions such as tuburculosis granulomas [47] as well as in atherosclerotic plaques. Furthermore,
spontaneous foam cell formation may produce a positive feedback with monocyte recruitment due
to cytokine signalling by foam cells, which sustains a nonresolving inflammatory response [12].
Suppressed lipid export may be beneficial when an inflammatory response is required to clear
an infectious agent [10] although we have not included this behaviour in the model. However
suppressed lipid export may be detrimental in the to the resolutions of nonresolving inflammatory
responses such as to oxidised LDL during atherosclerosis or apoptotic adipocytes in obesity [48].
Efferocytosis can, therefore, act as a double edged sword; it is necessary to prevent postapoptotic
necrosis, but may drive excessive lipid accumulation in macrophages.
The inflammatory response inside the artery wall becomes pathogenic when the necrotic core
and macrophage population size are large [13]. Our model generates these disease characteristics
when the rates of monocyte and LDL influx into the artery wall are large and efferocytosis and
emigration are suppressed (see Figure 9).
When efferocytosis is efficient and there is a large influx of LDL, average macrophage lipid
loads may become high. This promotes cytokine signalling and so increases the rate of monocyte
recruitment and expands both the population size and the amount of lipid in the tissue. Macrophage numbers and lipid contents can be large even while the necrotic core size is small. This is
particularly likely when emigration rates are high. In this case efferocytosis clears all apoptotic
macrophages and recycles lipid back into the macrophage population and macrophages can ferry
their lipid load out of the tissue. This state, where macrophage numbers and lipid content are
large, can become vulnerable to becoming pathological if the efferocytosis rate declines. Where the
rate of cell emigration is low and efferocytosis is inefficient, a proportion of apoptotic cells will not
be ingested by live macrophages, but will become necrotic. The necrotic material will be ingested
by macrophages, but if these macrophages can rapidly offload lipid to HDL or emigrate from the

Figure 9: A schematic diagram that summarises the key results derived from our model. Each of the four constituent
diagrams represent a different type of plaque. Macrophages are represented by circles, apoptotic macrophages by
clouds and necrotic debris by stars. Each plaque experiences macrophage recruitment, which may be amplified
by cytokine production by macrophages that are already in the plaque; macrophage emgration; and macrophage
apoptosis which is followed either by efferocytosis of the apoptotic cells (top and middle right) or secondary necrosis
of the apoptotic cells followed by phagocytosis of the necrotic material (middle left and bottom). Some plaques
(middle right and bottom) also experience large LDL influxes. The plaque at the top is unlikely to become dangerous.
Macrophages undergo apoptosis and are ingested and recycled effectively leaving few macrophages with large lipid
loads. The two plaques in the middle row are both somewhat pathological. The plaque on the left has inefficient
efferocytosis which results in the formation of a necrotic core. The plaque on the right has high rates of LDL influx
which creates a plaque where macrophage recruitment is pathologically enhanced and where many macrophages
have very high lipid loads. The plaque at the bottom of the diagram is highly pathological with both a high rate
of LDL influx and inefficient efferocytosis resulting in a large necrotic core and a large proportion of macrophages
carrying heavy lipid loads.

plaque, then lipid loads will remain low, despite the presence of the necrotic core. (See Figure 9.)
Cell emigration typically promotes disease regression [18]. Emigration leads to lipid removal
from the artery wall as and, thereby, prevents it from being recycled via efferocytosis. Reduction
in apoptotic cell formation also reduces the extent of postapoptotic necrosis when efferocytosis is
inefficient. In pratice, however, the rate of emigration is small compared to the rates of recruitment and efferocytosis. [8, 49]. A quantitative study suggests that 5 − 15% (Ω = 1.5 − 1.15) of
monocyte-derived cells leave via cell emigration during inflammation [8]. Although the proportion
of macrophages that undergo emigration is small [8, 49], our model suggests that it is significant
in relation to lipid accumulation (Figure 7).
Where a large rate of recruitment is balanced by a large rate of emigration, LDL-derived lipid,
apoptotic cells and necrotic debris that have been consumed by macrophages, are effectively moved
from the artery wall. High monocyte recruitment may be beneficial as it increases macrophage
numbers and so reduces the average lipid load per cell, but recruitment can also be detrimental as
it introduces fresh endogenous lipid into the system. Macrophage populations may also grow via
cell proliferation [16, 17], although we have not included this in this model. Cell division may be a
beneficial way to increase macrophage numbers because it dilutes lipid across the population and
acts as a branching or fragmentation process that opposes the reverse-branching or coagulation
process associated with efferocytosis. Thus a coagulation-fragmentation process can describe the
population dynamics of substance accumulation inside macrophages that divide, die via apoptosis
and ingest apoptotic cells via efferocytosis.
Our model can readily be extended to represent changes in macrophage phenotype as a function of lipid load. For example, lipid accumulation increases the rate of macrophage inflammatory
signalling, [23], apoptosis [24, 25] and necrosis [26]. This type of behaviour can be easily incorporated allowing the rates of apoptosis, efferocytosis, macrophage emigration and ingestion of LDL in
equations (29) to (37) to be functions of lipid load a. With these changes, the quantity of cytokines
or apoptotic cells in the artery wall, for example, will depend on both the number of macrophages
and their distribution across the spectrum of possible lipid loads. In our model we neglect spatial
effects although it is clear from observations that macrophage density and lipid load are spatially
structured within the artery wall [50]. Introducing another independent variable for space in our
model would enable us to study how the macrophage population evolves over time, space and lipid
content.
The model presented in this paper includes, for the first time, the distribution of intracellular
lipids in the macrophage population of an atherosclerotic plaque and in the associated population
of apoptotic macrophages. Tracking intracellular lipids using this model has generated new insight
into the importance of endogeneous lipid in foam cell development, the role of emigration and the
factors that promote foam cell formation.
