Abstract

47

Ecdysteroids are the principal insect steroid hormones essential for insect development and

48

physiology. In the last 18 years, several enzymes responsible for ecdysteroid biosynthesis,

49

encoded by Halloween genes, have been identified and well characterized, both genetically

50

and biochemically. However, none of these proteins have yet been characterized at the

51

tertiary structure level. Here, we report an integrated in silico, in vitro, and in vivo analyses of

52

the Halloween glutathione S-transferase (GST) protein, Noppera-bo (Nobo). We determine

53

crystal structures of Drosophila melanogaster Nobo (DmNobo) complexed with glutathione

54

and 17β-estradiol, a DmNobo inhibitor. 17β-estradiol almost fully occupied the putative

55

ligand-binding pocket, and a prominent hydrogen bond formed between Asp113 of DmNobo

56

and 17β-estradiol. Asp113 is essential for inhibiting DmNobo enzymatic activity by 17β-

57

estradiol, as 17β-estradiol does not inhibit and physically interacts less with the Asp113Ala

58

DmNobo point mutant. Asp113 is highly conserved among Nobo proteins, but not among

59

other GSTs, implying that Asp113 is important for endogenous Nobo function. Indeed, a

60

homozygous nobo allele possessing the Asp113Ala point mutation exhibits embryonic

61

lethality with undifferentiated cuticle structure, a phenocopy of complete loss-of-function

62

nobo homozygotes. These results suggest that the nobo family of GST proteins has acquired a

63

unique amino acid residue, which seems to be essential for binding an endogenous sterol

64

substrate to regulate ecdysteroid biosynthesis. This is the first study to reveal the structural

65

characteristics of insect steroidogenic Halloween proteins. This study also provides basic

66

insight into applied entomology for developing a new type of insecticides that specifically

67

inhibit ecdysteroid biosynthesis.

Significance Statement

74

Insect molting and metamorphosis are drastic and dynamic biological processes and,

75

therefore, have fascinated many scientists. Ecdysteroids represent one class of insect

76

hormones that are indispensable for inducing molting and metamorphosis. It is well known

77

that proteins responsible for catalyzing ecdysteroid biosynthesis reactions are encoded by

78

“Halloween” genes, most of which have names of ghosts and phantoms. However, no studies

79

have focused on the structural properties of these biosynthetic proteins. In this study, we

80

addressed this unsolved issue and successfully unraveled a structural property that is crucial

81

for the function of the fruit fly Halloween protein, Noppera-bo (a Japanese faceless ghost).

82

This is the first study to reveal the structural characteristics of an insect steroidogenic

83

Halloween protein.

85

Introduction

86

Ecdysteroids play pivotal roles in regulating many aspects of development and physiology in

87

arthropods, including insects (1, 2). Because ecdysteroids do not exist naturally in animals

88

other than arthropods, it has been long thought that molecules involved in ecdysteroid

89

biosynthesis, secretion, circulation and reception could be good targets for developing third-

90

generation pesticides that specifically inhibit insect life cycles, with no adverse effects on

91

other animals (3). Thus, the study of ecdysteroids has been important, not only in the basic

92

biological sciences, but also in the field of applied agrobiology.

93

Ecdysteroids are biosynthesized from dietary sterols that are primarily obtained from

94

food sources (1, 2). The formation of each biosynthetic intermediate going from dietary

95

sterols to the biologically-active form of ecdysteroids, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), is

96

catalyzed by a specific ecdysteroidogenic enzyme (2, 4). Since 2000, a series of these

97

enzymes has been identified. These enzymes include Neverland (5, 6), Non-molting

98

glossy/Shroud (7), Spook/CYP307A1 (8, 9), Spookier/CYP307A2 (9), CYP6T3 (10),

99

Phantom/CYP306A1 (11, 12), Disembodied/CYP302A1 (13), Shadow/CYP315A1 (13), and

100

Shade/CYP314A1 (14). A deficiency of genes encoding these enzymes results in

101

developmental lethality. Particularly, in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, complete loss-

102

of-function mutants of shroud, spook, phantom, disembodied, shade, and shadow, which are

103

often classified as Halloween mutants, commonly result in embryonic lethality with the loss

104

of differentiated cuticle structures (15). To date, the functions of these enzymes have been

105

characterized genetically and some of them have also been analyzed biochemically (2, 16).

106

However, none of these enzymes have yet been characterized at the tertiary structure level.

107

Here, we report the first crystal structure of an ecdysteroidogenic regulator encoded

108

by the Halloween gene, noppera-bo (nobo) (17–19). nobo encodes a member of the epsilon

109

class of cytosolic glutathione S-transferases (GST, EC 2.5.1.18; hereafter GSTEs) (20). In

110

general, GSTs catalyze various reactions with an activated glutathione (GSH) molecule in the

111

following 3 ways: GSH conjugation to a substrate, reduction of a substrate using GSH, and

112

isomerization (21). Data from previous studies have demonstrated that nobo is specifically

113

expressed in ecdysteroidogenic tissues, including the prothoracic gland and the adult ovary

114

(17–19). In addition, loss-of-nobo-function mutations in D. melanogaster and Bombyx mori

115

result in developmental lethality, which are well rescued by administering 20E (17–19).

116

Consistent with the requirement of GSH for GST function, a defect in glutathione

117

biosynthesis in D. melanogaster also leads to larval lethality, in part due to ecdysone

118

deficiency (22). These data clearly indicate that the nobo family of GSTs is essential for

119

ecdysteroid biosynthesis. However, besides GSH, an endogenous ligand and a catalytic

120

reaction driven by Nobo have not been elucidated.

121

In this study, we utilized the vertebrate female sex hormone 17β-estradiol (EST, Fig.

122

1A) as a molecular probe to gain insight into Nobo ligand recognition, based on our previous

123

finding that EST inhibits the GSH-conjugation activity of D. melanogaster Nobo (DmNobo;

124

also known as DmGSTE14) (23). We therefore considered the complex of DmNobo and EST

125

to be an ideal target for elucidating a 3-dimentional structure of an ecdysteroidogenic

126

Halloween protein and characterizing the interaction between DmNobo and its potent

127

inhibitor. Moreover, we used an integrated, combined approach based on quantum chemical

128

calculations, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, biochemical and biophysical analyses,

129

and molecular genetics. Consequently, we identified one DmNobo amino acid residue that is

130

strongly conserved only in the nobo family of GSTs, which is crucial for DmNobo inhibition

131

by EST and for the normal in vivo function of DmNobo during D. melanogaster

132

embryogenesis.

135

Crystal structure of DmNobo

136

The crystal structure of the apo-form of DmNobo (DmNobo_Apo) was determined at 1.50-Å

137

resolution by the molecular replacement method (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A, Table S1). DmNobo

forms a polypeptide homodimer with a canonical GST fold, which has a well-conserved

139

GSH-binding site (G-site) and a hydrophobic substrate-binding pocket (H-site) adjacent to

140

the G-site (21, 24). The crystal structures of the DmNobo_GSH, DmNobo_EST, and

141

DmNobo_EST-GSH complexes were also determined at resolutions of 1.75 Å, 1.58 Å, and

142

1.55 Å, respectively (Fig. 1B, SI Appendix, Fig. S1B, Table S1). The crystal structures of the

143

DmNobo_EST and DmNobo_EST-GSH complexes reproducibly showed clear electron

144

densities for EST. GSH and EST binding did not affect the overall structure of DmNobo (SI

145

Appendix, Fig. S1C); the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values for each pair among the

146

four crystal structures were comparable with respect to the estimated coordinate errors (SI

147

Appendix, Table S2).

148

GSH, a common substrate of GSTs (21, 24), was found in the G-site of DmNobo.

149

Crystallographic analysis revealed that the position and conformation of GSH in DmNobo

150

were essentially identical to those in other GSTEs (25–27). GSH is recognized by an

151

intensive hydrogen bond network with Gln43, His55, Val57, Pro58, Asp69, Ser70, His71, and

152

Ser107 in the G-site (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). The hydrogen bond interactions are similar to

153

those found in other GSTE proteins (25–27). Moreover, these residues are well conserved

154

among not only GSTEs but also the delta and theta classes of GSTs (hereafter GSTD proteins

155

and GSTT proteins, respectively), which are closely related to GSTEs (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A

156

and S3B) (20). Therefore, we conclude that the interaction between the G-site and GSH

157

cannot account for the unique functional property of DmNobo, as compared to other

158

GSTD/E/T proteins.

159

160

Molecular mechanism of EST recognition by DmNobo

161

EST was bound in the H-site, which has a hydrophobic character. The electron-density map

162

clearly showed that the compound in the H-site was the intact EST molecule. The EST

163

molecule had no chemical modifications, including reduction and S-glutathionylation. The H-

164

site, of which volume is approximately 365 Å3, was mostly filled with the EST molecule,

165

which has a volume of approximately 350 Å3, and no space was available to accommodate

166

another compound in the H-site (SI Appendix, Fig. S4).

167

Of the 16 amino acid residues lining the H-site, Arg13, Ser14, Gln43, Ser118, Arg122,

168

and Met212 do not have direct contacts with EST (SI Appendix, Table S3). The D-ring of

169

EST is situated near the entrance of the H-site and exposed to the solvent. Only a few

170

interactions are observed between the D-ring of EST and DmNobo (Fig. 2A, SI Appendix,

171

Table S3). In contrast, the A-ring of EST is located deep inside of the H-site and makes

172

intensive interactions with H-site residues (Fig. 2A, SI Appendix, Table S3). Ser14, Pro15,

173

Leu38, Phe39, and Phe110 form hydrophobic interactions with the A-ring of EST and are

174

completely conserved among the Nobo proteins (Fig. 3A, Fig. 3B, Fig. 3C, SI Appendix,

175

Table S3). The conservation of these residues among DmGSTD/E/T proteins are less than

176

those among Nobo proteins (Fig. 3D, Fig. 3E, Fig. 3F, SI Appendix, Table S3). While Ser114,

177

Met117, Ser118, Val121, Thr172, and Leu208, which form hydrophobic interactions with

178

EST, are not conserved completely in the Nobo proteins, they show higher conservation than

179

that found among DmGSTD/E/T proteins. These results suggest that the three-dimensional

180

structure of the H-site, particularly near the A-ring of EST, is conserved in Nobo proteins and

181

has different characteristics from DmGSTD/E/T proteins.

182

While the H-site has an overall hydrophobic character, there is one charged residue,

183

Asp113, in the H-site. Asp113, which is nearly completely conserved in the Nobo proteins

184

(see below), is located at the innermost region of the H-site and forms a hydrogen bond with

185

a hydroxyl group on the C3 atom of EST. EST binding induces a rotation of the χ1 angle of

186

Asp113 by 25.4°, and Oδ of Asp113 forms a hydrogen bond with O3 of EST (Fig. 2B). The

187

carboxyl group of Asp appears to be ionized, as expected considering that its isoelectric point

188

is approximately 3.6 and that crystallization in solution was achieved at a pH of 6.4. This is

189

the only hydrogen bond found between EST and DmNobo and seems to be critical for EST

190

binding.

191

To evaluate the contribution of the hydrogen bond to the interaction with EST, total

192

interaction energies between EST fragments and DmNobo amino acid residues were

193

calculated using the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method, which can evaluate the inter-

194

fragment interaction energy (IFIE) based on the quantum chemistry (28, 29). The FMO

195

calculation classifies the IFIE into 4 energy categories, namely the electrostatic energy (ES),

196

exchange-repulsion energy (EX), charge-transfer energy and higher-order mixed term

197

(CT+mix), and dispersion energy (DI). The FMO calculation estimated that the ES

198

represented approximately half of the total IFIE (-41.4 kcal/mol versus -82.4 kcal/mol; Fig.

199

2C and SI Appendix, Table S4). The crystal structure suggested that the ES arises from the

200

hydrogen bond between Oδ of Asp113 and O3 of EST (SI Appendix, Table S4). These results

201

suggested that Asp113 plays a critical role in interacting with EST.

202

203

Asp113 in DmNobo is essential for EST binding

204

The importance of the Asp113-EST hydrogen bond for EST binding was biochemically

205

examined with a recombinant mutated DmNobo protein carrying Asp113Ala amino acid

206

substitution (DmNobo[Asp113Ala]). DmNobo[Asp113Ala] lacks the sidechain carboxyl

207

group at position 113 and therefore cannot form a hydrogen bond with EST. The crystal

208

structure of the DmNobo[Asp113Ala] did not show significant structural differences

209

compared with the wild-type DmNobo (DmNobo[WT]) protein (SI Appendix, Fig. S5A, Fig.

210

S5B).

211

We

first

examined

the

enzymatic

activities

of

DmNobo[WT]

and

212

DmNobo[Asp113Ala] using an in vitro enzymatic assay system with the fluorogenic

213

substrate 3,4-DNADCF (23). In this assay system, GSTs catalyze GSH conjugation to the

214

non-fluorescent molecule, 3,4-DNADCF, giving rise to highly fluorescent product, 4-GS-3-

215

NADCF. In the absence of EST, both DmNobo[WT] and DmNobo[Asp113Ala] showed

216

GSH-conjugation activity (Fig. 4C). In the presence of EST, as expected from the EST-

217

binding to the H-site, the enzymatic activity of DmNobo[WT] was inhibited with an IC50

218

value of approximately 2.3 μM (Fig. 4A, Fig. 4C). In contrast, the enzymatic activity of

219

DmNobo[Asp113Ala] was not inhibited by EST, even at a concentration of 25 μM (Fig. 4A,

220

Fig. 4C).

221

We next measured the dissociation constant (Kd) values between DmNobo and EST

222

by performing surface plasmon-resonance (SPR) analysis. The Kd values between

223

DmNobo[WT] and EST in the presence or absence of GSH were 0.38 ± 0.02 µM and 0.48 ±

224

0.10 µM, respectively (Fig. 4B, Fig. 4C). In contrast, it was barely possible to determine the

225

Kd value between DmNobo[Asp113Ala] and EST due to a weak interaction (Fig. 4B, Fig.

226

4C), which was consistent with crystal structure analysis (SI Appendix, Fig. S5C). These

227

results suggest that Asp113 is critical for interaction with EST.

228

We also employed MD simulations to confirm the contribution of Asp113 to the

229

interaction with EST using DmNobo[WT] and DmNobo[Asp113Ala] as models. In these MD

230

simulations, the initial structures of EST and the DmNobo proteins were defined based on

231

data acquired from our crystallographic analyses (Fig. 4D). While simulating DmNobo[WT]

232

for 100 nano seconds (ns), we found that the distance between Oδ of Asp113 and the

233

hydroxyl group of EST was relatively constant (Fig. 4E and 4F, Movie 1, Movie 2). However,

234

when simulating DmNobo[Asp113Ala], the distance between Ala113 and the hydroxyl group

235

of EST increased over time, and EST moved from the initial position (Fig. 4E and 4F, Movie

236

1, Movie 2). Among three independent MD simulations, the maximum RMSD value of EST

237

in DmNobo[WT] was less than ~6.60 Å (SI Appendix, Fig. S6A, Fig. S6B). In contrast, with

238

the MD simulation of DmNobo[Asp113Ala], the maximum RMSD value was less than ~9.54

239

Å (SI Appendix, Fig. S6A, Fig. S6B). These simulation results also support the possibility that

240

hydrogen bonding between Asp113 and EST is required for stable binding of EST to the H-

241

site.

242

243

Evolutionary conservation of Asp113 in Noppera-bo

244

Previous reports have demonstrated that the nobo family of GSTs is found in Diptera and

245

Lepidoptera (18, 30, 31). Amino acid-sequence analysis revealed that all Nobo proteins from

246

6 dipteran and 13 lepidopteran species have Asp at the position corresponding to Asp113 of

247

DmNobo (Fig. 3A, Fig. 3B, Fig. 3D). An exception is found in Nobo of the yellow fever

248

mosquito Aedes aegypti, as the corresponding amino acid residue of A. aegypti Nobo is Glu,

249

which also has a carboxyl group in the sidechain similar to Asp. In contrast, no Asp/Glu

250

residue was found at the corresponding position of the DmGSTD/E/T proteins, other than

251

Nobo (Fig. 3C, Fig. 3E, Fig 3F). Consistent with the amino acid composition, EST did not

252

inhibit the enzymatic activity of the DmGSTE6 or DmGSTE9 recombinant proteins (Fig. 3G).

253

These results suggest that Nobo proteins utilize Asp113 to recognize their target compounds

254

as a common feature and that Asp113 serves a biological role.

255

256

Asp113 is essential for Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis

257

Finally, we examined whether Asp113 is essential for any in vivo biological function of

258

DmNobo. We utilized a CRISPR-Cas9-based knock-in strategy to generate a nobo allele

259

encoding an Asp113Ala point mutation (nobo3×FLAG-HA-D113A). We found that no trans-

260

heterozygous mutant D. melanogaster with nobo3×FLAG-HA-D113A and the complete loss-of-

261

nobo-function allele (noboKO) (18) survived to the adult stage (Table 1). By performing a

262

detailed developmental-stage analysis, we identified no first-instar larvae or later-staged

263

insects with the nobo3×FLAG-HA-D113A/noboKO genotype. These results indicate that the

264

nobo3×FLAG-HA-D113A/noboKO genotype is embryonic lethal. We also found that nobo3×FLAG-HA-

similar to the feature of Halloween mutants, such as noboKO/noboKO homozygotes (18). We

confirmed that the protein level of Nobo3×FLAG-HA-D113A was comparable to that of

Nobo3×FLAG-HA-WT (Fig. 5E, Fig. 5F), suggesting that the phenotypes were due to loss of

Discussion

275

In this study, we employed an integrated experimental approach, involving in silico, in vitro,

276

and in vivo analyses to unravel the structure–function relationship of the ecdysteroidogenic

277

GST protein, Nobo. GSTs are widely expressed in all eukaryotes and are also massively

278

duplicated and diversified (24). Among them, the nobo family of GST proteins is strictly

279

required for ecdysteroid biosynthesis in insects. Importantly, the lethality of nobo mutation in

280

D. melanogaster is rescued by overexpressing nobo orthologues, but not by overexpressing

281

non-nobo-type gst genes involved in detoxification and pigment synthesis (18). This fact

282

strongly indicates that, when compared to canonical GSTs, Nobo proteins must possess a

283

unique structural property that make Nobo specialized for ecdysteroid biosynthesis.

284

Regarding this point, this study is significant in that we found that the unique acidic amino

285

acid, Asp/Glu113, is crucial for the in vivo function of Nobo. It should be noted that, besides

286

Asp/Glu113, other amino acids constituting the H-sites are also highly conserved among 21

287

Nobo proteins (Fig. 3A, Fig. 3B, Fig. 3D). These common features imply that the Nobo

288

proteins might share an identical endogenous ligand for the H-site in the ecdysteroidogenic

289

tissues among the species.

290

An endogenous ligand for Nobo remains a mystery. This study, however, provides

291

some clues for considering candidates for an endogenous ligand. First, it is very likely that

292

the ligand forms a hydrogen bond with the Oδ/Oε atom of Asp/Glu113, given that the nobo

293

Asp113Ala point mutation was embryonic lethal and the complete loss-of-function nobo

294

phenocopy in mutant D. melangaster. Second, considering the complementary shape between

295

the H-site and EST, it seems reasonable to predict that the endogenous ligand(s) is at least

296

similar in shape to steroids. This prediction is also supported by the fact that Nobo acts in

297

ecdysteroidogenic tissues where steroidal molecules are enriched. One steroid that possesses

298

these features is cholesterol. Evidence from our previous study suggests that nobo may be

299

involved in cholesterol transport and/or metabolism in ecdysteroidogenic tissues (17–19).

300

Very interestingly, an MD simulation indeed predicted that cholesterol can stably bind to the

301

H-site of DmNobo via a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group of cholesterol (C3

302

position) and Asp113 of DmNobo (SI Appendix, Fig. S7). However, paradoxically, it seems

303

that cholesterol contains no site for a chemical reaction with GSH by DmNobo. It is possible

304

that Nobo might serve as a carrier for the ligand, possibly cholesterol, as several classes of

305

GSTs have been shown to exhibit “ligandin” function to carry and transport specific ligands

306

in cells (32). Currently, we have failed in multiple attempts to detect DmNobo-cholesterol

307

complexes via crystallographic analyses, and further experiments are needed for clarify any

308

interaction between Nobo and cholesterol.

309

The activities of insect ecdysteroids can be disrupted in vivo using chemical agonists

310

and antagonists of the ecdysone receptor, some of which are also utilized as insecticides (33).

311

However, chemical compounds that specifically inhibit ecdysteroid biosynthesis are not

312

available. This study provides the first structural information for guiding the development of

313

efficient Nobo inhibitors, which might serve as seed compounds for new insecticides in the

314

future. However, it should be noted that EST and estrogenic chemical compounds are often

315

recognized as endocrine-disrupting chemicals that can dangerously influence the endocrine

316

systems of wild animals (34). Therefore, while EST is a prominent inhibitor of Nobo, a

317

practical compound that can be utilized as an actual insecticide must display no-estrogenic

318

activity. To consider this problem, it is important to note a difference in the EST-recognition

319

patterns between DmNobo and the mammalian estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) protein (35–

320

38). The details of the EST-ERα interaction were investigated using the crystal structures of

321

human ERα in an EST-bound form (35, 39). In ERα, Glu353 interacts with the O3 atom of

322

EST, Phe404 interacts with the A-ring of EST via a CH/π interaction, His524 interacts with

323

the O17 atom of EST, and hydrophobic residues interact with the steroid nucleus. Each of

324

these recognition patterns were found in DmNobo, except for a hydrogen bond with the O17

325

atom of EST. Asp113 of DmNobo interacts with the O3 atom of EST as in the case of Glu353

326

of ERα, and DmNobo utilizes a Cys residue of GSH for an SH/π interaction with the A-ring

327

of EST. However, no interaction was found between O17 of EST and residues of the H-site of

328

DmNobo (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). Given this difference, we expect that a Nobo-specific, non-

329

estrogenic chemical compound can be developed. Currently, we are pursuing large-scale

330

computational calculations to select chemical compounds that satisfy those conditions and an

331

in vitro enzymatic assay to examine DmNobo inhibition.

332

We emphasize that this report is the first to describe the physical interactions between

333

a Halloween protein and a potent inhibitor at the atomic level. Our interdisciplinary approach

334

will also be applicable for Nobo proteins other than D. melanogaster, such as disease vector

335

mosquitos and the agricultural pest moths, and might be a viable strategy for developing new

336

insecticides useful for human societies.

Additional methods are presented in the SI Appendix.

340

341

Protein expression, purification, and in vitro enzymatic analysis

342

Recombinant DmNobo was expressed with the pCold-III plasmid vector (TaKaRa Bio) in

343

Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Promega) and purified via glutathione-affinity column

344

chromatography, followed by size-exclusion column chromatography. In vitro GST assays

345

and GST activity-inhibition assays using 3,4-DNADCF were performed as described

346

previously (23).

347

348

Crystallization

349

DmNobo_Apo crystals were obtained using a crystallization buffer containing 42.5% (v/v)

350

polypropylene glycol 400 (PPG400) and 100 mM Bis-Tris (pH 6.4). Crystals of DmNobo-

351

ligand complexes were prepared by the soaking method. DmNobo crystals were soaked for 6

352

h in an artificial mother liquor (42.5% [w/v] PPG400 and 100 mM Bis-Tris [pH 6.4])

353

containing 10 mM EST, with or without 1 mM GSH.

354

355

Crystal structure determinations

356

Crystals were scooped with a cryo-loop (MiTeGen) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.

357

Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at beamlines BL-1A and BL-5A in the Photon

358

Factory, Tsukuba, Japan, and at beamline X06SA in the Swiss Light Source, Villigen,

359

Switzerland. The diffraction datasets were automatically processed and scaled using XDS

360

(40), POINTLESS (41), and AIMLESS (42) on PReMo (43). The crystallographic statistics

361

are summarized in SI Appendix, Table S1. Phases for the DmNobo_Apo_1 crystal were

362

determined by the molecular replacement method with MOLREP (44) using DmGSTE7

363

(PDB ID = 4PNG) as an initial model. Molecular replacement calculations for the other

364

structures were performed using DmNobo_Apo_1 as an initial model. Crystallographic

365

refinements were carried out using REFMAC5 and PHENIX.REFINE (45, 46). Models were

366

manually built by COOT (47). The volume of the H-site of DmNobo was calculated using 3V

367

(48). All molecular graphics presented in this manuscript were prepared with the PyMOL

368

Molecular Graphics System, version 1.7.6 (Schrödinger, LLC).

371

Kd values were determined by SPR using a Biacore T200 instrument and a CM5 sensorchip

372

(GE Healthcare) at 25°C. DmNobo[WT] or DmNobo[Asp113Ala] was used as a ligand, and

373

EST was used as an analyte in a buffer containing phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (10 mM

374

KH2PO4-Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, 137 mM NaCl, and 2.7 mM KCl) with 1% dimethyl sulfoxide

375

(DMSO) in the presence or absence of 1 mM GSH as a running buffer. The Kd values of the

376

ligands and analyte were evaluated with Biacore T200 Evaluation Software from triplicate

377

assays.

378

379

FMO calculations

380

Ab initio FMO calculations (49–51) were performed with the DmNobo crystal structures.

381

First, hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structures, and their energy minimizations

382

were performed. IFIEs were then calculated by the FMO method at the MP2/6-31G* level for

383

the energy-minimized DmNobo models that were fragmented into amino acid and ligand

384

(EST) units. The obtained IFIEs were decomposed into four energy components (the ES, EX,

385

CT+mix, and DI components) using paired interaction-energy decomposition analysis

386

(PIEDA) (28, 29).

387

388

MD simulations

389

The structures of DmNobo[WT]_EST-GSH and DmNobo[Asp113Ala]_EST-GSH were

390

processed to assign bond orders and hydrogenation. The ionization states of EST and GSH

391

suitable for pH 7.0 ± 2.0 were predicted using Epik (52), and H-bond optimization was

392

conducted using PROPKA (53). Energy minimization was performed in Maestro using the

393

OPLS3 force field (54). Preparation for MD simulation was conducted using the Molecular

394

Dynamics System Setup Module of Maestro (Schrödinger). DmNobo[WT]_EST-GSH and

395

DmNobo[Asp113Ala]_EST-GSH, which were subjected to energy minimization, were placed

396

in an orthorhombic box with a buffer distance of 10 Å to create a hydration model, using the

397

TIP3P water model (55). NaCl (0.15 M) was added as the counterion to neutralize the system.

398

The MD simulations were performed using Desmond ver. 2.3 (Schrödinger) (56). The cut-off

399

radii for the van der Waals and electrostatic interactions, and the time step, initial temperature,

400

and pressure of the system were set to 9 Å, 2.0 fs, 300 K, and 1.01325 bar, respectively. The

401

sampling interval during the simulation was set to 10 ps. Finally, we performed MD

402

simulations with the NPT ensemble for 100 ns.

404

Phylogenetic analysis

405

Twenty one amino acid sequences of DmNobo or Bombyx mori Nobo orthologues were

406

obtained from NCBI non-redundant protein database (57) and the Uniprot Knowledgebase

407

(58).

408

For the phylogenetic analysis of insect GSTD/E/T proteins, previously described

409

amino acid sequences were obtained from the Uniprot Knowledgebase, NCBI protein

410

database, MonarchBase (18, 58–60). Multiple alignment of 503 amino acid sequences was

411

performed with COBALT (61), and the sequence alignment was used for cluster-analysis

412

with CLANS (62). A major cluster included 372 amino acid sequences of GSTD/E/T and

413

other GST proteins (SI Appendix, Table S5). A phylogenetic tree was drawn with COBALT

414

using the 372 GSTs with a neighbor-joining algorithm. We identified 371 sequences with a

415

Grishin-sequence difference of 0.9, which included 151 GSTDs, 178 GSTEs, and 42 GSTTs.

416

The GSTEs included 21 Nobo proteins. To calculate the amino acid frequencies, the obtained

417

alignment was manually edited based on the known crystal structures, using Jalview (63).

418

The amino acid frequencies were calculated and illustrated using WebLOGO version 3.7.4

419

(64), and colored using the “Chemistry (AA)” scheme.

421

Transgenic D. melanogaster insects and genetics

422

The generation of D. melanogaster knock-in flies was performed as described in the SI

423

materials. We found that nobo3×FLAG-HA-WT-homozygous flies were fully viable, whereas

424

nobo3×FLAG-HA-D113A-homozygous flies displayed embryonic lethality. We utilized nobo3×FLAG-

425

HA-D113A

-heterozygous and -homozygous embryos for cuticle preparation and immunostaining.

426

To formally rule out the possibility that the embryonic lethality was due to anonymous

427

deleterious mutations other than nobo3×FLAG-HA-D113A, we counted the number of trans-

428

heterozygous flies with a nobo knock-out (noboKO) from a previous report (18), as follows.

429

Heterozygous nobo3×FLAG-HA-WT, nobo3×FLAG-HA-D113A, and nobo-knock-out (noboKO) alleles

430

were balanced with CyO carrying Actin5C:gfp cassette (CyO-GFP). Either nobo3×FLAG-HA-

431

WT

/CyO-GFP flies or nobo3×FLAG-A-D113A/CyO-GFP flies were crossed with noboKO/CyO-GFP

432

flies. The trans-heterozygous flies (nobo3×FLAG-HA-WT/noboKO or nobo3×FLAG-HA-D113A/noboKO)

433

should exhibit no GFP signals. We found that GFP-negative nobo3×FLAG-HA-WT/noboKO

434

embryos hatched normally and developed into adults without any abnormalities, whereas

435

nobo3×FLAG-HA-D113A/noboKO embryos did not.

438

Embryonic cuticle preparation was performed as previously described (65). Immunostaining

439

for whole-mount embryos was conducted as previously described (18). A mouse anti-FasIII

440

monoclonal antibody 7G10 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa,

441

USA; 1:20 dilution) and an anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated with Alexa488 (Life

442

Technologies; 1:200 dilution) were used for immunostaining the embryos. For

443

immunostaining of the brain-ring gland complex in third-instar larvae, we first crossed

444

nobo3×FLAG-HA-WT homozygous females or nobo3×FLAG-HA-D113A/CyO-GFP females with

445

Oregon-R wild type males. Third-instar larvae of the heterozygous offspring (nobo3×FLAG-HA-

446

WT

/+ or nobo3×FLAG-HA-D113A/+) were dissected and then immunostained as previously

447

described (66). The antibodies used for the brain-ring gland complex included a rat anti-HA

448

high-affinity monoclonal antibody (3F10, 1:20 dilution; Roche), a guinea pig anti-Shroud

449

antibody (67) (1:200 dilution), an anti-rat IgG antibody conjugated with Alexa488 (1:200

450

dilution; Life Technologies), and an anti-guinea pig IgG antibody conjugated with Alexa555

451

(1:200 dilution; Life Technologies). Fluorescence images were obtained using an LSM700

452

microscope (Carl Zeiss).
