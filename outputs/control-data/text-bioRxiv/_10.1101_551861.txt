Abstract

2

Background: Defects in embryonic development of the thyroid gland are a major cause for

3

congenital hypothyroidism in human newborns but the underlying molecular mechanisms are

4

still poorly understood. Organ development relies on a tightly regulated interplay between

5

extrinsic signaling cues and cell intrinsic factors. At present, however, there is limited

6

knowledge about the specific extrinsic signaling cues that regulate foregut endoderm

7

patterning, thyroid cell specification and subsequent morphogenetic processes in thyroid

8

development.

9

Methods: To begin to address this problem in a systematic way, we used zebrafish embryos to

10

perform a series of in vivo phenotype-driven chemical genetic screens to identify signaling

11

cues regulating early thyroid development. For this purpose, we treated zebrafish embryos

12

during different developmental periods with a panel of small molecule compounds known to

13

manipulate the activity of major signaling pathways and scored phenotypic deviations in

14

thyroid, endoderm and cardiovascular development using whole mount in situ hybridization

15

and transgenic fluorescent reporter models.

16

Results: Systematic assessment of drugged embryos recovered a range of thyroid phenotypes

17

including expansion, reduction or lack of the early thyroid anlage, defective thyroid budding

18

as well as hypoplastic, enlarged or overtly disorganized presentation of the thyroid

19

primordium after budding. Our pharmacological screening identified BMP and FGF signaling

20

as key factors for thyroid specification and early thyroid organogenesis, highlight the

21

importance of low Wnt activities during early development for thyroid specification and

22

implicate drug-induced cardiac and vascular anomalies as likely indirect mechanisms causing

23

various forms of thyroid dysgenesis.

24

Conclusions: By integrating the outcome of our screening efforts with previously available

25

information from other model organisms including Xenopus, chicken and mouse, we conclude

26

that signaling cues regulating thyroid development appear broadly conserved across

27

vertebrates. We therefore expect that observations made in zebrafish can inform mammalian

Introduction

33

Thyroid hormones (TH) are critically important regulators of vertebrate growth and

34

development (1). The thyroid gland is the only known site of de novo synthesis of TH in

35

vertebrates. The minimal functional units of thyroid tissue are thyroid follicles consisting of a

36

single layer epithelium of thyroid follicular cells (TFC) enclosing a luminal cavity that is

37

filled with a proteinous matrix containing TH precursors (2, 3). Although thyroid tissue

38

differs in shape, size and anatomical position between vertebrate species, these variations in

39

thyroid anatomy appear to have no major impact on thyroid functionality (3). The key

40

requirement for normal thyroid function is the formation of sufficient amounts of functional

41

thyroid follicles to meet physiological demands for TH synthesis.

42

The thyroid is the anterior-most organ derived from the embryonic gut tube in vertebrates and

43

its morphogenesis is a complex developmental process comprising a sequence of conserved

44

morphogenetic events (2–4). The initial event in TFC development is the specification of

45

thyroid precursor cells (TPC) within a restricted domain of the anterior endoderm.

46

Molecularly, TPC are characterized by co-expression of a unique combination of transcription

47

factors including orthologs or paralogs of human NKX2-1, PAX8, FOXE1 and HHEX (5–7).

48

This TPC population constitutes the thyroid anlage, formed as early as embryonic day 8.5

49

(E8.5) in mouse and around E20 in human (8, 9). TPC represent a committed cell state but

50

functional differentiation genes are not yet expressed and TPC are not capable of TH

51

synthesis. Current concepts hold also that the size of this population of committed cells is

52

likely one key determinant of later organ size (6).

53

Morphologically, the earliest evidence of thyroid organogenesis is the formation of the

54

thyroid placode recognizable as a thickening of the ventral foregut epithelium, commonly

55

positioned at a level between the first and second pharyngeal arch in a region where the

56

cardiac outflow tract (OFT) is in close contact with the pharyngeal endoderm (8, 10, 11). The

57

placodal thickening rapidly transforms into a true organ bud that eventually detaches from the

58

pharyngeal floor followed by a relocation of the thyroid diverticulum towards its final adult

59

position. The thyroid primordium then expands by proliferation and attains a species-specific

60

shape. Along with the initiation of folliculogenesis, thyroid functional differentiation genes

61

are induced, encoding among others for thyroglobulin, thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor,

62

thyroid peroxidase and sodium-iodide symporter (2). This induction also marks the transition

63

of TPC into terminally differentiated TFC capable of TH synthesis. Thyroid organogenesis is

64

complete in mice at E16.5 (8) and around the 11th week of gestation in human (12).

65

Although the morphological events of thyroid organogenesis have been outlined in much

66

detail in diverse model organisms (8, 13–16), the understanding of the specific molecular

67

mechanisms regulating cell and tissue dynamics during these processes remains at best

68

preliminary (3, 6, 16). Organ development relies on the tightly regulated interplay between

69

extrinsic signaling cues and cell intrinsic factors (i.e. lineage-specific transcription factors).

70

While core aspects of the transcription factor network regulating thyroid cell development

71

have been experimentally dissected in mouse and zebrafish (7, 17–20), there is still a paucity

72

of data on the extrinsic signaling cues that regulate foregut endoderm patterning, thyroid cell

73

specification and subsequent morphogenetic processes (21). From recent reviews on these

74

topics (6, 21, 22), it becomes apparent that current knowledge is largely based on a patchwork

75

collection of experimental observations made in diverse experimental systems and species.

76

This makes it challenging to formulate robust hypotheses on the role of distinct signals for

77

specific morphogenetic processes and to infer the potential contribution of perturbed signaling

78

to the etiopathology of developmental thyroid diseases such as congenital hypothyroidism due

79

to dysgenesis (2, 6, 21).

80

Accordingly, there is a need for systematic analyses to further our understanding of the

81

specific role of common signaling pathways during thyroid organogenesis. Suitable test

82

systems to tackle this problem should meet some important demands. First, a recurrent theme

83

in the developmental biology of endoderm-derived organs is that adjacent mesodermal tissues

84

play a critical role as a source of inductive and permissive signals for organ specification and

85

differentiation (23–25). With regard to thyroid development, fate mapping and tissue

86

recombination experiments in various species revealed that pre-cardiac anterior lateral plate

87

mesoderm and the OFT-forming cardiac mesoderm are likely major sources of signaling cues

88

instructing early thyroid development (10, 26). Such complex tissue-tissue interactions are

89

difficult to replicate in classical in vitro systems arguing for the need of whole organisms as

90

experimental systems. In addition, current models of endoderm patterning and organ

91

specification highlight that mesoderm-endoderm interactions can be transient and that specific

92

signaling cues can have diverse and even opposite regulatory activities depending on the

93

temporal context (27–29). Accordingly, experimental models preferably should offer the

94

ability to have temporal control over the phenotype. In this respect, chemical genetic

95

approaches based on small molecules targeting specific biological pathways can provide

96

distinct advantages over classical genetic models.

97

Zebrafish embryos represent one such powerful in vivo model system to investigate cellular

98

and molecular mechanisms of thyroid organogenesis combining the tractability of worm or fly

99

models with physiological and anatomical characteristics of higher vertebrates (30).

100

Morphogenetic events during early thyroid development are well conserved from fish to men

101

(7, 11, 13–15, 18, 22, 31) and the zebrafish model offers several salient features that are

102

particularly attractive for larger-scale chemical genetic studies on organ development (32). In

103

contrast to the intrauterine development of mammalian embryos, zebrafish embryos develop

104

externally which greatly facilitates experimental manipulations and permits monitoring of

105

developmental processes and pathological deviations in real time. Addition and removal of

106

bioactive compounds at specific developmental stages offers temporal control of embryonic

107

signaling activities in order to characterize phenotypes within specific developmental

108

contexts. The high fecundity of zebrafish permits generation of thousands of developmentally

109

synchronized embryos that can then be housed conveniently in well plates or small petri

110

dishes. Combined with small size, optical transparency and rapid development of embryos,

111

these advantageous properties permit the realization of in vivo screening approaches requiring

112

large numbers of test organisms (32, 33).

113

In this study, we harnessed advantages of the zebrafish model to perform a series of

114

pharmacological screens investigating the role of major signaling pathways during early

115

thyroid organogenesis. For this purpose, we treated embryos during defined developmental

116

periods with a panel of small molecules known to modulate specific signaling pathways and

117

performed comprehensive phenotypic analyses with respect to thyroid morphogenesis and

118

cardiovascular development. A systematic assessment of drugged embryos recovered a range

119

of different thyroid phenotypes including expansion, reduction or lack of the early thyroid

120

anlage and the thyroid primordium, defective thyroid budding as well as overtly disorganized

121

anatomical presentation of the thyroid primordium. Our results highlight key roles for

122

fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling during

123

thyroid specification, demonstrate the importance of low Wnt/β-catenin signaling activities

124

for early morphogenetic events and implicate drug-induced cardiac and vascular anomalies as

125

an indirect mechanism causing abnormal thyroid development.

Methods

128

Zebrafish husbandry and embryo culture

129

Zebrafish embryos were collected by natural spawning. Embryos were raised at 28.5°C under

130

standard conditions (34), staged according to hours post fertilization (hpf) as described (35)

131

and enzymatically dechorionated by incubation in embryo medium containing 0.6 mg/mL

132

pronase (Sigma) at room temperature. For live analyses and prior to sampling and fixation,

133

embryos were anesthetized in 0.02% tricaine (Sigma). The following zebrafish lines were

134

used in this study: pigmentless casper strain (36), Tg(tg:nlsEGFP) abbreviated as tg-nlsEGFP

135

(18), Tg(sox17:EGFP)s870 abbreviated as sox17-EGFP (37), Tg(myl7:EGFP)twu26 abbreviated

136

as myl7-EGFP (38) and Tg(kdrl:EGFP)s843 abbreviated as kdrl-EGFP (39). To generate

137

transgenic sox17-EGFP, myl7-EGFP and kdrl-EGFP embryos, homozygous transgene

138

carriers of each line were crossed with WT fish. Reporter expression in transgenic sox17-

139

EGFP, myl7-EGFP and kdrl-EGFP embryos highlights endodermal, myocardial and

140

endothelial/endocardial cells, respectively. To generate pigmentless transgenic tg-nlsEGFP

141

embryos, homozygous carriers of the tg-nlsEGFP transgene maintained in the casper

142

background were crossed with non-transgenic casper fish. In transgenic tg-nlsEGFP embryos,

143

a nuclear GFP variant is specifically expressed in thyroglobulin-expressing thyroid cells. If

144

indicated, pigmentation of embryos was inhibited by addition of 0.003% 1-phenyl-2-thiourea

145

(PTU; Sigma) to the embryo medium. Embryos were fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered

146

paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma) overnight at 4°C, washed in phosphate-buffered saline

147

containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST), gradually transferred to 100% methanol, and stored at

148

−20°C until further use. Zebrafish husbandry and all experiments were performed under

149

standard conditions in accordance with institutional (Université Libre de Bruxelles-ULB) and

150

national ethical and animal welfare guidelines and regulation. All experimental procedures

were approved by the ethical committee for animal welfare (CEBEA) from the Université

152

Libre de Bruxelles (protocols 578N-579N).

153

Preparation of Treatment Solutions

154

A total of 20 small molecule compounds (see Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1) were used

155

in the pharmacological screens and each compound was applied at three concentrations. Stock

156

solutions of test compounds were prepared in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma) with the

157

exception of cyclopamine (prepared in ethanol) and SAG (prepared in distilled water). Stock

158

solutions were aliquoted and stored at -20°C until use. Concentrations of stock solutions and

159

test solutions are provided in Supplementary Table 1. Treatment solutions were prepared by

160

serially diluting stock solutions in embryo medium. Control treatments included a water

161

control group (embryo medium alone), DMSO vehicle control groups (medium containing 0.1

162

- 1.0% DMSO) and ethanol vehicle controls (medium containing 0.1 - 0.5% ethanol). For the

163

gastrula screen, test solutions were additionally supplemented with 0.01 mg/L methylene blue

164

to prevent the growth of bacteria or fungus. For the pharyngula screen, PTU was added to

165

media to prevent pigmentation.

166
167

Experimental Conditions of Gastrula Screen

168

For signaling pathway manipulation during gastrula stages (treatment period I in Fig. 1),

169

embryos were treated with small molecule compounds from 6 to 10 hpf. Normally developing

170

embryos were collected from different clutches and pooled at 4 hpf. Embryos were then

171

randomly allocated into petri dishes (60 mm x 15 mm, Sarstedt) so that each dish contained

172

either 30 tg-nlsEGFP embryos or a pool of ten sox17-EGFP, ten myl7-EGFP and ten kdrl-

173

EGFP embryos. At 6 hpf, embryo media were removed and 6 mL of treatment solution was

174

added per dish. All treatments were performed in duplicate. Embryos were incubated in the

175

dark at 28.5°C until 10 hpf. Treatments were stopped by replacing treatment solutions with

176

embryo medium followed by three 10 min washes of embryos in fresh medium. Thereafter,

177

embryos were transferred to clean petri dishes containing 10 mL of embryo medium and were

178

further raised under standard conditions. At 20/21 hpf, all embryos were dechorionated and

179

transferred to medium containing PTU. At 22 hpf, all sox17-EGFP embryos were inspected

180

for gross organismal effects and GFP reporter expression and then fixed in 4% PFA. At 26/27

181

hpf, all remaining embryos were inspected for gross organismal effects and reporter

182

expression. At 28 hpf, half of the tg-nlsEGFP embryos from each dish were fixed in 4% PFA.

183

Remaining embryos were raised in medium containing PTU until 54/55 hpf, inspected for

184

gross organismal effects, analyzed for reporter expression and then fixed in 4% PFA for

185

further analyses.

186
187

Experimental Conditions of Somitogenesis Screen

188

Small molecule treatment during somitogenesis stages (treatment period II in Fig. 1) lasted

189

from 10 to 26 hpf. At 8 hpf, normally developing embryos were collected from different

190

clutches and pooled. Embryos were then randomly allocated into petri dishes (60 mm x 15

191

mm) as described for the gastrula screen. At 10 hpf, embryo medium was replaced by 6 mL of

192

treatment solution per dish and embryos were incubated in test solutions at 28.5°C in the dark.

193

All treatments were performed in duplicate. At 21 hpf, treatment of sox17-EGFP embryos

194

was stopped, embryos were dechorionated, inspected for gross organismal effects and GFP

195

reporter expression and fixed at 22 hpf in 4% PFA. All other treatments were stopped at 26

196

hpf by replacing treatment solutions with embryo medium followed by two 10 min washes in

197

medium containing PTU. Embryos were dechorionated and further raised under standard

198

conditions. At 27/28 hpf, embryos were inspected for gross organismal effects and reporter

199

expression. At 28 hpf, half of the tg-nlsEGFP embryos in each dish were fixed in 4% PFA.

200

Remaining embryos were raised in medium containing PTU to 54/55 hpf, inspected for gross

201

organismal effects and reporter expression and fixed at 55 hpf in 4% PFA for further analyses.

203

Experimental Conditions of Pharyngula Screen

204

Drug treatments covering pharyngula stages (treatment period III in Fig. 1) were performed

205

from 24 to 54 hpf. For these experiments, embryos were dechorionated at 20/21 hpf,

206

transferred to medium containing PTU and normally developing embryos were randomly

207

allocated into petri dishes (60 x 15 mm) so that each dish contained either 20 tg-nlsEGFP

208

embryos or a pool of ten myl7-EGFP and ten kdrl-EGFP embryos. At 24 hpf, embryo

209

medium was removed and 6 mL of treatment solution was added per dish. All treatments were

210

performed in duplicate. Embryos were incubated in treatment solutions in the dark at 28.5°C

211

until 54 hpf. Treatments were stopped by discarding the treatment solutions followed by two

212

10 min washes in 10 mL of embryo medium containing PTU. All embryos were inspected for

213

gross organismal effects and reporter expression and subsequently fixed in 4% PFA for

214

further analyses.

215
216

Whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH)

217

DNA templates for synthesis of nkx2.4b (previously nkx2.1a, ZDB-GENE-000830-1) and tg

218

(ZDB-GENE-030519-1) riboprobes were generated by PCR as described (14). The plasmid

219

for the myl7 (previously cmlc2, ZDB-GENE-991019-3) riboprobe has been used as described

220

(40). Single color WISH of nkx2.4b was performed essentially as described (14) using

221

nkx2.4b riboprobes labeled with digoxigenin (DIG), anti-DIG antibody conjugated to alkaline

222

phosphatase (1:6000, Roche) and BM Purple (Roche) as alkaline phosphatase substrate.

223

To facilitate a higher throughput of dual-color WISH assays for nkx2.4b/myl7 in 28 hpf

224

embryos and tg/myl7 in 55 hpf embryos, we developed a WISH protocol based on triple probe

225

hybridization of pools of 28 and 55 hpf embryos using nkx2.4b, tg and myl7 riboprobes

226

labeled with DIG, dinitrophenol (DNP) and fluorescein (FLU), respectively. We first

227

confirmed for each experimental treatment group that embryos collected at 28 and 55 hpf can

228

be unequivocally distinguished by morphological landmarks so that these embryos can be

229

pooled during different steps of WISH assay. We additionally identified many experimental

230

treatment groups displaying unique, treatment-related morphological anomalies (i.e. cyclopia,

231

curled tails, etc.) that would permit pooling with normally developing embryos from other

232

treatments.

233

Embryos were processed during pre-hybridization protocol steps as described (41). Just prior

234

to probe hybridization, stage 28 and 55 hpf embryos were pooled in hybridization tubes

235

according to morphological criteria and incubated in 1 mL triple-probe hybridization buffer

236

for at least 16 hours at 65°C. Post-hybridization washes were performed with pooled samples

237

as described (41). Before antibody incubation, embryos were sorted for developmental stage.

238

Stage 28 hpf embryos were incubated with anti-DIG to detect the nkx2.4b probe and stage 55

239

hpf embryos were incubated with anti-DNP antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase

240

(1:500, Vector Laboratories) to detect tg probe. After overnight antibody incubation and

241

several washing steps, nkx2.4b expression in 28 hpf embryos was revealed by BM purple

242

staining and tg expression in 55 hpf embryos by NBT/BCIP staining (Roche). Staining

243

reactions were stopped by several 5 min washes in PBST followed by a 10 min incubation in

244

100% methanol to remove background staining. Thereafter, stage 28 and 55 hpf embryos

245

were recombined for two 5 min HCl-glycine (pH 2.2) treatments to remove the first antibody

246

(42) followed by overnight incubation of pooled samples with anti-FLU antibody conjugated

247

to alkaline phosphatase (1:2000, Roche). Expression of myl7 in 28 and 55 hpf embryos was

248

then revealed by Fast Red (Sigma) staining. Double-stained embryos were washed in PBST,

249

post-fixed in 4% PFA and embedded in 90% glycerol. Stained specimen were sorted

250

according to developmental stage and treatment group and analyzed for treatment-related

251

effects on thyroid and cardiac marker expression. Whole-mount imaging of stained specimen

252

was performed using a DFC420C digital camera mounted on a MZ16F stereomicroscope

253

(Leica). If indicated, embryos were embedded in 7% low-melting point agarose (Lonza) and

254

sagittal tissue sections at 100 µm thickness were cut on a VT1000S vibratome (Leica).

specimens were post-fixed in 4% PFA, gradually transferred to 90% glycerol and

Using a pharmacological approach, our study aimed at temporally dissecting the role of major

275

signaling pathways for normal thyroid morphogenesis in zebrafish embryos. The small

276

molecules used in study (see Table 1) were selected based on a thorough review of available

277

zebrafish studies reporting on their efficacy and specificity to modulate the activity of specific

278

signaling pathways. For all compounds, maximum tolerable concentrations were determined

279

during initial range-finding studies to ensure low mortality rates during the definitive

280

treatment experiments.

281

Limited solubility in DMSO or ethanol prevented the preparation of highly concentrated stock

282

solutions for some compounds (Table 1). As a consequence, some treatment solutions

283

contained increased solvent concentrations of up to 1% DMSO or 0.5% ethanol. To account

284

for the different solvent concentrations used during the definitive treatment studies, all

285

experiments included three DMSO-containing vehicle control groups (0.1, 0.5, 1.0%) and at

286

least two ethanol-containing vehicle control groups (0.1, 0.5%).

287

Possible effects of small molecule treatment on early thyroid development were analyzed at

288

two developmental stages. At 28 hpf, all embryos were examined for nkx2.4b mRNA

289

expression by means of WISH. While first nkx2.4b-expressing TPC can be identified in

290

zebrafish as early as 23/24 hpf, a larger domain of thyroidal nkx2.4b expression with

291

stereotypic dimension and localization can be visualized by WISH in 28 hpf embryos (see

292

embryo #3 in Fig. 2). We refer to this expression domain as the zebrafish thyroid anlage. The

293

absence of other tissues expressing nkx2.4b in the vicinity of the thyroid anlage facilitates

294

sensitive analyses to identify treatment-related changes in size, shape and localization of the

295

thyroid anlage. Within the anterior endoderm, the thyroid anlage normally forms in a region

296

adjacent to the developing cardiac OFT (see embryo #1 in Fig. 2). Co-staining of 28 hpf

297

embryos with a probe for the myocardial marker myl7 provided also relevant landmark

298

information to identify possible ectopic locations of nkx2.4b expression. In addition to

299

topological properties of the thyroid anlage, we carefully monitored the progressive evolution

300

of the staining signal in all WISH assays as an indicator for possible treatment-related

301

differences in nkx2.4b expression levels. If robustly detected across replicate experiments, we

302

will refer to such observations as enhanced or diminished expression levels.

303

Treatment-related effects on thyroid morphogenesis were also analyzed at 55 hpf. At this

304

developmental stage, we examined the expression characteristics of the functional

305

differentiation marker thyroglobulin (tg) which was assessed by means of monitoring

306

nlsEGFP reporter expression in live transgenic tg-nlsEGFP embryos (18) and by WISH

307

analyses of endogenous tg mRNA expression. In 55 hpf embryos, the thyroid primordium has

308

completed its detachment from the ventral pharyngeal endoderm and presents as a compact

309

midline mass of thyroid cells with a slightly ovoid shape when viewed frontally (see embryo

310

#4 in Fig. 2). All embryos were assessed for treatment-related differences in thyroid size,

311

shape, localization and myl7 co-staining was performed to identify possible ectopic locations

312

of tg expression relative to the cardiac OFT. In addition to the evaluation of thyroid markers,

313

drugged embryos were assessed for treatment-related gross morphological anomalies (edema,

314

tissue malformations, developmental delay, growth deficits) by brightfield microscopy.

315

Fluorescence microscopy of transgenic embryos was used to qualitatively assess possible

316

deviations from normal endoderm (sox17-EGFP line), cardiac (myl7-EGFP line) and vascular

317

(kdrl-EGFP line) development.

318
319

Pathway Manipulation during Gastrula Stages

320

A first pharmacological screen addressed thyroid development following manipulation of

321

signaling pathways during gastrula stages. This treatment (6 to 10 hpf) coincides with the

322

developmental period during which the three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm)

323

and the major body axes are formed. Many of the pathways targeted in our experiments have

324

critical regulatory roles during these processes, most notably BMP, FGF, Wnt and Nodal

325

pathways (43, 44). Accordingly, the presence of characteristic developmental anomalies in

326

drugged embryos allowed us to verify the efficacy of pathway disruption. Small molecule-

327

induced abnormalities included C2 dorsalized phenotypes after BMP inhibition (45), loss of

328

caudal tissue in FGF inhibitor-treated embryos (Supplementary Fig. 2A) (46), cyclopic eyes

329

and loss of forebrain following Nodal inhibitor treatment (47) and neural posteriorization

330

phenotypes in embryos treated with Wnt activators (48).

331
332

Thyroidal Effects

333

Small molecule treatment of zebrafish embryos covering gastrula stages revealed alterations

334

in early thyroid development in response to nine drugs affecting five different pathways.

335

Specifically, abnormal thyroid development resulted from treatment with inhibitors of FGF,

336

platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), Nodal/transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) and BMP

337

pathways and activators of Wnt signaling (Fig. 2,3).

338

At 28 hpf, embryos treated with two different FGF pathway inhibitors (PD166866, SU5402)

339

showed a more rapid evolution of the staining for the early thyroid marker nkx2.4b compared

340

to vehicle-treated embryos (Fig. 2). In addition, we frequently detected a posterior expansion

341

of the thyroidal nkx2.4b expression domain (see embryo #8 in Fig. 2) or additional ectopic

342

domains of nkx2.4b expression (Supplementary Fig. 1). Analysis of sox17-EGFP embryos did

343

not reveal discernible effects of FGF inhibition on anterior endoderm formation (Fig. 4).

344

Notably, comparative analyses of tg staining between drugged embryos and control embryos

345

did not reveal gross differences in thyroid size at 55 hpf (Fig. 2). However, FGF inhibitor-

346

treated embryos presented at 55 hpf a less compact mass of thyroid cells (see embryo #9 in

347

Fig. 2) and irregular thyroid morphology (see embryo #10 in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig.

348

2B). Conversely, treatment with BCI, a dusp6 inhibitor that locally enhances FGF signaling,

349

did not cause clear thyroid effects as small reductions in thyroid size were limited to embryos

350

displaying an overall developmental delay.

351

Enhanced nkx2.4b expression at the thyroid anlage stage was observed also in embryos

352

treated with KI11502, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with selectivity for PDGF signaling

353

(Fig. 2). A modest mediolateral expansion of the thyroidal nkx2.4b expression domain was

354

observed in approximately one third of KI11502-treated embryos (see embryo #13 in Fig. 2).

355

Endoderm formation was unaffected by Ki11502 treatment (Fig. 4). Thyroid anomalies due to

356

Ki11502 treatment were also apparent at later stages including frequent detection of an

357

irregular mediolateral expansion of tg expression in 55 hpf embryos (see embryo #15 in Fig.

358

2). The increased thyroid size in KI11502-treated embryos was particularly remarkable given

359

that these embryos displayed reduced whole body and head size at 55 hpf (see embryo #15 in

360

Fig. 2).

361

Consistent with the crucial role of Nodal signaling in early embryonic development, inhibitors

362

of this pathway (LY364947 and SB505124) caused, in a concentration-dependent manner,

363

severe gross morphological defects including loss of ventral forebrain structures (see lack of

364

forebrain nkx2.4b expression in embryos #17,18 in Fig. 2), cyclopia (see embryos # 19,20 in

365

Fig. 2) and a dramatic reduction of anterior endoderm (Fig. 4). Despite these overt

366

developmental anomalies, thyroidal nkx2.4b expression was robustly detectable in 28 hpf

367

embryos, even in embryos completely lacking forebrain nkx2.4b expression (see embryos

368

#17,18 in Fig. 2). However, shape and position of the thyroid anlage was abnormal in most

369

inhibitor-treated embryos. Specifically, the thyroidal domain of nkx2.4b expression showed a

370

reduced mediolateral extension but expanded further caudally (see embryo #18 in Fig. 2). In

371

embryos treated with high concentrations of inhibitors, additional ectopic clusters of nkx2.4b-

372

expressing cells were frequently detected in posterior positions (Supplementary Fig. 3). At 55

373

hpf, the thyroid primordium of most embryos from LY364947 and SB505124 treatments

374

displayed an irregular shape and the number of tg-expressing cells appeared reduced in

375

SB505124-treated embryos if compared to controls (see embryo #20 in Fig. 2).

376

The most severe defects in early thyroid development resulted from inhibition of BMP

377

signaling and from over-activation of canonical Wnt signaling. Treatment of gastrulating

378

embryos with two BMP pathway inhibitors (DMH1 and LDN193189) consistently caused a

379

concentration-dependent loss of thyroidal nkx2.4b expression at 28 hpf. Almost all embryos

380

treated with the highest inhibitor concentrations displayed a complete lack of detectable

381

nkx2.4b expression in the thyroid region. The absence of a thyroid anlage was not associated

382

with any discernible reduction of foregut endoderm formation as judged from analyses of

383

sox17-EGFP embryos (Fig. 4). For both BMP pathway inhibitors, early defects in thyroid

384

specification correlated closely with a severe reduction or absence of detectable tg staining in

385

embryos at later stages (see embryos #24,25 in Fig. 2).

386

Over-activation of canonical Wnt signaling in gastrulating embryos by treatment with BIO

387

and azakenpaullone caused complex developmental phenotypes. At 28 hpf, drugged embryos

388

showed a concentration-dependent loss of anterior neural tissue concurrent with severe

389

inhibition of cardiac development and a dramatic reduction of thyroidal nkx2.4b expression

390

(see embryos #26-28 in Fig. 2). At the highest test concentrations of BIO (5.0 µM) and

391

azakenpaullone (5.0 µM), nkx2.4b expression was no longer detectable in the thyroid region.

392

Although formation of anterior endoderm was evident in embryos treated with Wnt activators,

393

perturbed morphogenesis was frequently observed in lateral and most rostral regions of the

394

anterior endoderm (Fig. 4). Interestingly, despite the absence of detectable nkx2.4b expression

395

in the majority of 28 hpf embryos treated with high drug concentrations, all 55 hpf embryos

396

had detectable tg expression, although tg expression was restricted to tiny and often

397

ectopically positioned domains (see embryo #30 in Fig. 2). Conversely, inhibition of Wnt

398

signaling by IWR1 treatment did not affect thyroid specification. Deviations from normal

399

thyroid development were limited to an aberrant shape of the thyroid primordium in 55 hpf

400

embryos when viewed laterally (Supplementary Fig. 2B).

401
402

Pathway Manipulation during Somitogenesis Stages

403

A second pharmacological screen involved treatment of embryos from 10 to 26 hpf and

404

covered the somitogenesis period of zebrafish embryonic development. In zebrafish, the

405

endoderm becomes morphologically distinctive at the beginning of the somitogenesis period

406

as two converging sheets of cells that will fuse at the midline by the 15-17 somite stage (49).

407

While the posterior endoderm rapidly remodels into a rod-like structure, the prospective

408

foregut endoderm region will maintain a sheet-like morphology until after completion of the

409

somitogenesis. Towards the end of the somitogenesis period, TPC co-expressing nkx2.4b,

410

pax2a and hhex become detectable around 23/24 hpf in the anterior endoderm region (31).

411
412

Thyroidal effects

413

Somitogenesis treatment of zebrafish embryos with small molecules revealed alterations of

414

early thyroid development in response to 11 drugs affecting seven different pathways (Fig. 5

415

and 6). Drug-induced deviations from normal thyroid development were detectable following

416

treatment with inhibitors of PDGF, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Sonic

417

hedgehog (Shh), Nodal/TGFβ, BMP and FGF signaling and activators of Wnt signaling (Fig.

418

7).

419

Inhibition of PDGF signaling during somitogenesis by KI11502 treatment caused a marked

420

mediolateral expansion of the nkx2.4b expression domain at 28 hpf (see embryos #6-8 in Fig.

421

5A). This enlargement of the thyroid anlage occurred concomitantly with an abnormal heart

422

morphology characterized by a widened arterial pole region of an otherwise shorter heart tube

423

(see embryo #7 in Fig. 5A). While endoderm formation was unaffected by PDGF inhibition,

424

live analyses of heart development in inhibitor-treated myl7-EGFP embryos revealed delayed

425

cardiac fusion and heart tube assembly (Supplementary Fig. 4) as previously described in

426

zebrafish pdgfra mutants (50). At 55 hpf, the thyroid primordium of KI11502-treated embryos

427

appeared enlarged compared to control embryos. The expanded domains of tg expression in

428

drugged embryos had an aberrant morphology often characterized by an irregular bilateral

429

expansion (see embryos #9,10 in Fig. 5A).

430

A very similar late thyroid phenotype was observed in embryos following treatment with the

431

VEGF inhibitor vatalanib (see embryo #15 in Fig. 5A). Concurrent analyses of pharyngeal

432

vasculature development in kdrl-EGFP embryos revealed another commonality between

433

KI11502 and vatalanib treatments in that irregularly enlarged thyroids were predominantly

434

observed in treatment groups with defective OFT vessel morphogenesis (Fig. 5B). Three-

435

dimensional reconstructions of confocal images of the pharyngeal vasculature in KI11502-

436

and vatalanib-treated embryos showed dysplasia of specific vessels previously identified as

437

vital structures guiding the localization of zebrafish thyroid tissue (15).

438

Inhibition of Shh signaling during somitogenesis by treatment with the Smoothened

439

antagonist cyclopamine resulted in complex phenotypic alterations. Cyclopamine treatment

440

between 10 to 26 hpf efficiently phenocopied many malformations previously described in

441

zebrafish mutants with impaired Shh signaling including ‘curly tail down’ body shape, mild-

442

to-severe cyclopia, hemorrhage as well as OFT malformations (51, 52). Despite these severe

443

developmental defects, cyclopamine treatment caused only mild alterations of the thyroid

444

anlage in 28 hpf embryos (Fig. 5A). While the intensity of nkx2.4b staining in cyclopamine-

445

treated embryos was similar to control levels, a unique topological characteristic of the

446

thyroid anlage in cyclopamine-treated embryos was that TPC were restricted to more medial

447

positions so that the anlage had an overall reduced mediolateral size (see embryo #17 in Fig.

448

5A). Prevalence of this early thyroid phenotype in cyclopamine treatments was correlated

449

with concentration-dependent decrements in the mediolateral size of the anterior endoderm

450

(Supplementary Fig. 5). At 55 hpf, cyclopamine-treated embryos displayed severe

451

malformations of pharyngeal development. Embedded in a grossly abnormal subpharyngeal

452

environment, multiple clusters of tg-expressing cells were detectable at ectopic locations

453

along the pharyngeal midline (Fig. 5A). Additional confocal analyses of the pharyngeal

454

vasculature confirmed dysgenesis of major OFT vessels in cyclopamine-treated kdrl-EGFP

455

embryos (Fig. 5B).

456

Somitogenesis treatment with inhibitors of Nodal/TGFβ signaling (LY364947, SB505124)

457

caused moderate thyroid phenotypes (Fig. 5A). At the thyroid anlage stage, the major

458

phenotype was a reduced intensity of nkx2.4b staining while size, shape and location of the

459

nkx2.4b expression domain was similar to controls (see embryo #23 in Fig. 5A). In later stage

460

embryos, inhibition of Nodal/TGFβ signaling resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease

461

of the size of the thyroid primordium (see embryo #25 in Fig. 5A).

462

In the somitogenesis screen, the most severe thyroid defects were observed following

463

treatment of embryos with inhibitors of BMP (DMH1 and LDN193189) and FGF signaling

464

(PD166866, SU5402) and compounds stimulating canonical Wnt signaling (BIO,

465

azakenpaullone). For all six compounds, a concentration-dependent loss of thyroidal nkx2.4b

466

expression was evident in 28 hpf embryos (Fig. 6). At the highest test concentration, each of

467

the compounds caused a complete lack of detectable nkx2.4b expression in the thyroid region.

468

Conversely, drug treatment did not cause gross defects in anterior endoderm formation as

469

judged from analyses of sox17-EGFP embryos (data not shown). However, dual-color WISH

470

of nkx2.4b and myl7 expression showed that the concentration-dependent loss of thyroid

471

marker expression caused by BIO and azakenpaullone treatment was accompanied by

472

concurrent depletion of myocardial cells and failure of heart tube formation at high test

473

concentrations (see embryo #17 in Fig. 6). Although inhibition of BMP and FGF signaling

474

resulted also in heart malformations (i.e. jogging and looping defects) in a high proportion of

475

embryos, there was no similar dramatic loss of cardiac tissue. For all treatments, impaired

476

TPC specification in 28 hpf embryos was associated with a dramatic diminution or even

477

complete absence of tg-expressing cells in 55 hpf embryos (Fig. 6). Yet, there were notable

478

differences among differentially treated embryos with respect to the phenotypic presentation

479

of the small remaining thyroid tissue. The small thyroid primordium of 55 hpf embryos

480

treated with activators of Wnt signaling was mostly restricted to the expected midline position

481

(see embryo #19 in Fig. 6). In embryos treated with BMP inhibitors, tg-expressing cells were

482

frequently detected off the midline, predominantly in tiny bilateral cell clusters located on

483

either side of the cardiac OFT (see embryo #9 in Fig. 6). Conversely, inhibition of FGF

484

signaling caused a much more variable localization of tg-expressing cells with irregularly

485

positioned clusters of thyroid cells expanding uni- or bilaterally away from the midline (see

486

embryo #15 in Fig. 6).

487
488

Pathway Manipulation during Pharyngula Stages

489

In a third screen, embryos were treated with small molecules from 24 to 54/55 hpf covering

490

the pharyngula period of zebrafish embryogenesis. During this period, the endoderm

491

undergoes further dramatic remodeling to finally form a primitive gut tube (53). The thyroid

492

anlage which is formed during early pharyngula stages transforms into a thyroid bud during

493

the second half of the pharyngula period. Notably, thyroid bud formation in zebrafish is

494

accompanied by the onset of expression of functional differentiation markers including tg,

495

tshr, tpo and slc5a5 between 34 and 42 hpf (14). This thyroid primordium detaches from the

496

then formed ventral floor of the foregut around 48 hpf and relocates into the subpharyngeal

497

mesenchyme in close apposition to the cardiac OFT. According to these timelines, this screen

498

specifically addressed the role of signaling cues for thyroid budding, bud detachment and

499

relocation of the thyroid diverticulum.

501

Thyroidal effects

502

Small molecule treatment of zebrafish embryos from 24 to 54/55 hpf revealed alterations of

503

thyroid development in response to 10 drugs affecting five six different pathways (Fig. 8,9).

504

In this screen, embryos were analyzed only at 55 hpf and drug-induced thyroid anomalies

505

were detectable after treatment with inhibitors of BMP, FGF, Shh, Nodal/TGFβ, PDGF and

506

VEGF signaling.

507

Pharyngula treatment with inhibitors of BMP (Fig. 8A), FGF (Fig. 8A) and TGFβ (Fig. 9A)

508

signaling caused concentration-dependent decrements in thyroid size in 55 hpf embryos.

509

Penetrance and severity of these effects was stronger for BMP and FGF inhibitors (Fig. 8C)

510

with many treated embryos displaying only very tiny patches of tg-expressing cells (see

511

embryos #4,6 in Fig. 8A). In the BMP inhibitor treatment groups, up to one third of embryos

512

displayed supernumerary clusters of tg-expressing cells located bilaterally to the cardiac OFT

513

(see #3 in Fig. 8A). Cardiac looping was not affected in these treatments but inhibition of

514

BMP signaling was associated with an increased ventricle size compared to controls (see

515

embryo #3 in Fig. 8A).

516

Treatment with inhibitors of FGF signaling caused a more complex phenotype. Treated

517

embryos had a much smaller head size, a reduced head-trunk angle (35) indicative of delayed

518

development and showed compromised morphogenesis of the pharyngeal region (Fig. 8B).

519

Interestingly, treatment with the FGF inhibitor PD166866 resulted in delayed or even

520

incomplete detachment of the thyroid primordium from the pharyngeal floor (Fig. 8B). From

521

dual-color WISH analyses, we noted an increased space between the thyroid and the cardiac

522

OFT indicating that inhibition of FGF signaling disrupted the normal coordination of thyroid

523

budding and heart descent into the sub-pharyngeal region (Fig. 8B).

524

A similar budding defect appeared to occur following inhibition of Nodal/TGFβ signaling

525

(Fig. 9A). During the initial phenotyping of double stained embryos, we observed a high

526

proportion of Nodal/TGFβ inhibitor-treated embryos with a thyroid primordium positioned

527

close to the pharyngeal floor but at large distance to myl7-expressing cardiac tissue (see

528

embryos #3,5 in Fig. 9A). These embryos also presented mild pericardial edema. Subsequent

529

vibratome sections of stained embryos revealed large accumulations of blood cells in the

530

distal part of the OFT (see embryos #4,6 in Fig. 9A). When analyzing Nodal/TGFβ inhibitor-

531

treated embryos carrying the kdrl-EGFP transgene to visualize endocardial and endothelial

532

cells, we observed a massive ballooning of the aortic sac (Fig. 9B), a transient embryonic

533

structure connecting the cardiac OFT to the first pair of aortic arch arteries and the ventral

534

aorta (15). Since the aortic sac is not covered by a myocardial cell layer, this ballooning effect

535

was not visualized by myl7 staining. These observations indicated that the massively enlarged

536

aortic sac was pushing the thyroid diverticulum towards the pharyngeal floor preventing an

537

effective relocalization of the thyroid. Additional analyses of live kdrl-EGFP embryos

538

indicated that the aortic sac ballooning and blood cell accumulation were due to defective

539

blood flow (data not shown). Upon removal of the inhibitors from the medium at 55 hpf, we

540

observed a gradual recovery of cardiac functionality, a concomitant regression of the aortic

541

sac and, within 24 to 48 hours of drug withdrawal, relocalization of the thyroid into the

542

hypobranchial region became evident (data not shown).

543

Although thyroids of cyclopamine-treated embryos at 55 hpf had a comparable size as their

544

control counterparts, approximately half of the treated embryos displayed an aberrant thyroid

545

morphology (Fig. 9). Most prevalent were uni- or bilateral expansions of the tg expression

546

domain (see embryo #8 in Fig. 8A). Incidence of thyroid anomalies in cyclopamine-treated

547

embryos increased concomitantly with the prevalence and severity of vascular alterations

548

(data not shown). Co-occurrence of vascular and thyroidal abnormalities (irregularly enlarged

549

thyroids) was observed also for embryos treated with the PDGF inhibitor KI11502 and VEGF

550

inhibitors (vatalanib and SU4312). Disorganized and enlarged thyroids detected in these

551

treatment groups resembled thyroid phenotypes described in embryos treated with these

552

compounds in the somitogenesis screen (this study, see Fig. 5B) and in previous studies (15).

Discussion

555

In this study, we employed a pharmacological strategy to gain insights into the role of major

556

signaling pathways during early stages of zebrafish thyroid development. Given the

557

experimentally supported concept that cardiac mesoderm provides a source of instructive

558

signals for different steps of thyroid development (10, 11, 15, 26, 54, 55), our screening

559

approach included a comprehensive phenotyping of drug-induced deviations of thyroid

560

morphogenesis and concomitant cardiovascular anomalies. One advantage of pharmacological

561

approaches is that they can afford a level of temporal control of pathway modulation that is

562

often difficult to achieve by genetic model systems (32, 56). This is an important asset as the

563

literature of endoderm organ development is rich in instances where specific signaling

564

pathways have reiterative, diverging and even opposite roles during organ development

565

depending on the temporal context (29, 57, 58). Analyses of thyroid phenotypes following

566

timed small molecule treatment in the present study provide several such examples for the

567

importance of developmental context. For instance, while FGF inhibition during gastrula

568

stages caused enhanced thyroidal nkx2.4b expression at 28 hpf (see Fig. 2), application of the

569

same FGF inhibitors during somitogenesis completely abolished expression of this early

570

thyroid marker in the prospective thyroid region (see Fig. 6). For the purpose of this first

571

screening study, we temporally restricted small molecule treatments to cover three important

572

phases of early zebrafish development (gastrula, somitogenesis, pharyngula). We expect that

573

results from these screens will provide valuable guidance for further temporal refinements of

574

treatments periods in order to more precisely describe iterative pathway functions and identify

575

critical developmental periods at a higher temporal resolution.

576
577

When probing the role of different pathways during gastrulation, thyroid phenotypes became

578

evident following manipulation of four major signaling pathways (Wnt, FGF, BMP,

579

Nodal/TGFβ) implicated in endoderm formation and early endodermal anterior-posterior

580

patterning. For example, chemical blockage of FGF signaling, a pathway that normally exerts

581

posteriorizing activity on endoderm patterning (59), caused enhanced thyroidal nkx2.4b

582

expression in the anterior endoderm of zebrafish embryos. Such promoting effects on the

583

specification of an anterior cell lineage fit well into concepts that drug-induced dampening of

584

posteriorizing signals during gastrula promotes development of anterior tissue at the expense

585

of posterior tissues (28). Corroborating this concept, we observed that treatment with FGF

586

signaling inhibitors caused a dramatic truncation of the body at the level of the first somites

587

(see Supplementary Fig. 2A), a gross phenotype reminiscent of what has previously been

588

observed following dominant-negative FGF receptor overexpression (46, 60). However, still

589

other morphogenetic effects might contributed to this specific thyroid phenotype given that

590

early FGF blockage was previously shown to increase also total numbers of endodermal cells

591

in Xenopus and zebrafish embryos (43, 61, 62).

592

Our gastrula screen faithfully recovered thyroid phenotypes for other pathways with reported

593

posteriorizing effects on early anterior-posterior patterning of the endoderm (63). For

594

example, over-activation of canonical Wnt signaling during gastrulation strongly suppressed

595

TPC specification in the anterior endoderm. The contribution of posteriorizing activities of

596

Wnt signaling to impaired TPC specification is further supported by a striking correlation

597

between prevalence and severity of thyroid specification defects and neural posteriorization

598

phenotypes in embryos treated with Wnt-activating compounds. Combined with the lack of

599

prominent thyroid phenotypes following chemical blockage of early Wnt signaling, our

600

observations indicate that endodermal progenitors of the thyroid cell lineage require an

601

environment with low endogenous Wnt signaling during early development.

602

However, referring only to known anterior-posterior patterning activities of signaling

603

pathways falls short in explaining some other phenotypes observed in our gastrula screen. For

604

example, inhibition of BMP signaling in gastrula embryos severely impaired thyroid

605

specification, a phenotype that is difficult to interpret in the light of reported posteriorizing

606

activity of BMP on early endoderm patterning (64). Yet, it is important to note that BMP also

607

plays a central role in dorsal-ventral (DV) patterning (65). Recent studies on early endoderm

608

patterning showed that BMP is indeed required to promote ventral fates in the foregut

609

endoderm while it represses dorsal fates (66). Although the zebrafish anterior endoderm at the

610

time of thyroid specification is still a simple epithelial sheet lacking apparent morphological

611

correlates of a DV axis (53), the thyroid bud will later develop from the ventral foregut

612

endoderm. In the light of the reported down-regulation of ventral foregut markers in Xenopus

613

embryos treated with the BMP inhibitor DMH1 (66), our findings in DMH1-treated zebrafish

614

embryos suggest that a ventral identity might be assigned to the prospective endodermal

615

thyroid progenitors already during gastrula stages and that such early DV patterning of the

616

endoderm requires BMP.

617

Nodal/TGFβ signaling is yet another important, early acting pathway for endoderm formation

618

and anterior-posterior axis patterning (67). During zebrafish blastula and early gastrula stages,

619

Nodal activity is essential for the specification of mesendoderm in the marginal zone (68) and

620

zebrafish mutants with compromised Nodal/TGFβ activity exhibit deficient endoderm

621

formation along with severe thyroid specification defects (7, 31). However, when temporally

622

restricting the inhibition of Nodal/TGFβ signaling to stages between 6 and 10 hpf, as in our

623

gastrula screen, thyroid specification was only modestly affected. Notably, despite a marked

624

reduction in the amount of anterior endoderm, inhibitor-treated embryos displayed only small

625

reductions in the size of the thyroidal nkx2.4b expression domain. It appears, therefore, that

626

the development of endodermal progenitors with a competence to differentiate into thyroid

627

cells is largely independent of Nodal/TGFβ signaling in the period from 6 to 10 hpf.

628

Conversely, the high prevalence of embryos displaying ectopic nkx2.4b expression at more

629

posterior positions implies a possible posteriorizing activity of Nodal/TGFβ signaling during

630

endodermal anterior-posterior patterning. Collectively, results from our gastrula screen

631

indicate that Wnt and FGF signaling during gastrulation stages are dispensable for

632

development of endodermal progenitors of the thyroid lineage whereas gastrula BMP

633

signaling is absolutely required for later thyroid specification.

634
635

During somitogenesis, the pre-patterned endoderm undergoes further intricate patterning

636

accompanied by the acquisition of regionalized cell fates. This process results in the definition

637

of stereotypic regions at which endoderm-derived organ buds will be induced along the

638

primitive gut tube. In contrast to the induction of hepatic, pancreatic and lung cells fates (24,

639

25, 29), very little is known about the identity of permissive and inductive signaling cues

640

regulating thyroid cell specification. Thus, thyroid phenotypes arising from pathway

641

manipulation during somitogenesis stages are of particular interest to fill this gap of

642

knowledge. One key finding of our somitogenesis screen was a strict requirement of FGF and

643

BMP signaling for thyroid cell specification to occur in zebrafish embryos. Inhibition of

644

either pathway caused severe impairments of thyroid development and the thyroid phenotypes

645

observed at high concentrations of BMP and FGF signaling inhibitors could be classified as

646

true thyroid agenesis because of a complete lack of thyroid cell specification and later thyroid

647

tissue formation. Moreover, it is of particular note that our somitogenesis screen identified

648

with BMP and FGF the same two signaling pathways that are currently considered the most

649

potent signals to induce thyroid cell differentiation in human and murine stem cell models

650

(69, 70). This screening outcome underscores the value of the zebrafish model as a powerful

651

in vivo system to interrogate signaling cues controling vertebrate thyroid organogenesis.

652
653

Several previous in vivo studies have documented a pivotal role of FGF signaling in

654

regulating embryonic thyroid development in mouse (71–73), Xenopus (69, 74) and zebrafish

655

(10). The thyroid cell specification defects observed in our somitogenesis screen following

656

treatment with two different FGF inhibitors (PD166866, SU5402) are qualitatively similar to

657

results from a previous zebrafish study using SU5402 treatment during somitogenesis (10). In

658

zebrafish, fgf8 has been identified as one important factor for thyroid specification (10). Since

659

zebrafish fgf8 is expressed in the cardiac mesoderm adjacent to the converging anterior

660

endoderm throughout somitogenesis stages, this finding adds further evidence to the

661

presumed critical role of cardiac mesoderm as a source of instructing factors for thyroid cell

662

specification. Previous studies suggested that, although required for thyroid cell specification,

663

FGF signaling might not exert inductive activity in zebrafish but rather acts as a permissive

664

factor (10). This contention is supported by our observations that somitogenesis treatment

665

with BCI, a compound that enhances local FGF signaling (75), did not cause expanded or

666

ectopic nkx2.4b expression. Notably, although diverse defects during thyroid organogenesis

667

were observed in murine genetic models with impaired FGF signaling (55, 72, 73), none of

668

these genetic studies reported a severe thyroid specification defect as observed in zebrafish. It

669

is likely that redundant activities among different branches of FGF signaling prevented such

670

early thyroid phenotypes in genetic models. However, similar to what we observed in

671

zebrafish embryos, global pharmacological FGF inhibition in mouse embryonic explant

672

cultures effectively blocks induction of thyroidal Nkx2.1 expression in foregut endoderm

673

(70).

674

In contrast to FGF, no data were previously available on the importance of BMP signaling for

675

early thyroid development in zebrafish and no conclusive information has been obtained from

676

genetic mouse models with perturbed BMP signaling. In Twisted null mice, for example,

677

thyroidal expression of Hhex is reportedly absent at the 10-somite stage but these mice later

678

develop macroscopically visible thyroid glands of unknown functionality (76). In mutant mice

679

lacking the endogenous BMP inhibitor chordin, hypoplastic thyroids develop in a severely

680

disorganized tracheal region but no data are available about the development of the early

681

thyroid anlage in these mutants (77). While our somitogenesis screen results provide the first

682

demonstration of an absolute requirement of BMP signaling for thyroid cell specification in

683

zebrafish, these findings compare well to recent observations in Xenopus embryos (69) and

684

mouse embryonic explant cultures (69, 70), corroborating an evolutionary conserved role of

685

BMP for early thyroid development across vertebrates. Notably, in all three experimental

686

systems, pharmacological inhibition of BMP signaling during somitogenesis stages

687

completely blocked the induction of early thyroid marker expression in the prospective

688

thyroid region.

689

Our screening revealed further that FGF and BMP are still required at later stages of thyroid

690

morphogenesis. The presence of small and tiny thyroids in stage 55 hpf embryos treated with

691

FGF inhibitors during the pharyngula period is reminiscent of the hypoplastic thyroid

692

phenotypes reported for various murine models with impaired FGF signaling (55, 73).

693

Moreover, similar to reports of anomalous thyroid budding in mouse embryos with defective

694

FGF signaling (55), we confirmed that distorted thyroid budding is one component of the

695

thyroid phenotype in FGF inhibitor-treated zebrafish embryos.

696
697

BMPs and FGFs are diffusible growth factors and several FGFs and BMPs are expressed in

698

the cardiac mesoderm adjacent to the developing thyroid (55, 73, 78). While pharmacological

699

inhibition of FGF and BMP signaling clearly results in failure of thyroid development, it is

700

conceivable that perturbed development of cardiac mesoderm or abnormal positioning of

701

cardiac mesoderm relative to the population of endodermal thyroid progenitors could

702

similarly affect early thyroid development as a consequence of altered local signaling

703

activities. Proof-of-principle experiments with embryonic foregut endoderm explants have

704

shown that endoderm cultured in the absence of mesoderm fails to induce TPC specification

705

whereas addition of exogenous FGF2 and BMP4 to mesoderm-depleted endoderm explants

706

effectively induces early thyroid marker expression including nkx2.1, pax2 and hhex (69).

707

In fact, our combined analyses of cardiac and thyroid development suggest that altered

708

mesoderm-endoderm interactions might be involved in some thyroid phenotypes recovered in

709

our screens. One such example is the thyroid agenesis caused by over-activation of canonical

710

Wnt signaling during somitogenesis stages. While the overall normal thyroid anlage

711

formation following IWR1 treatment indicates that Wnt signaling during somitogenesis is

712

dispensable for thyroid specification, the complete lack of thyroid marker expression

713

following treatment with Wnt inducers has, to our knowledge, no precedent in other model

714

organisms. Wnt signaling is required for development of several endoderm-derived organs

715

including pancreas, liver, and swim bladder in zebrafish (24, 58, 79) but the role of this

716

pathway for thyroid induction has not yet been addressed.

717

At a first glance, thyroid specification phenotypes resulting from Wnt over-activation during

718

gastrula and somitogenesis stages appear quite similar, but there are several notable

719

differences. First, whereas gastrula stage-treated embryos displayed severe posteriorization

720

phenotypes indicating thyroid loss as a consequence of early anterior-posterior patterning

721

defects, such global posteriorization effects were less prominent in somitogenesis-treated

722

embryos. Second, almost all embryos treated with Wnt inducers during gastrula stages

723

displayed at least some small domains of tg expression at 55 hpf whereas Wnt over-activation

724

during somitogenesis caused a permanent lack of thyroid marker expression. Third, combined

725

analysis of cardiac and thyroid development revealed a very close correlation between

726

diminished cardiac mesoderm formation and reduced thyroid marker expression. The latter

727

observation is particularly intriguing as other zebrafish models with severely impaired cardiac

728

formation also showed marked deficits in thyroid specification (10). Consistent with previous

729

reports (57), we found that drug-induced over-activation of Wnt signaling at stages after heart

730

tube formation no longer impairs thyroid marker expression. Further analyses of Wnt-induced

731

phenotypes in cardiac and thyroid development are warranted to shed light on the underlying

732

developmental mechanisms leading to thyroid agenesis.

733

Disturbed positioning of cardiac mesoderm relative to endodermal thyroid progenitors might

734

also be involved in the expanded expression domain of the early thyroid marker nkx2.4b

735

following inhibition of PDGF signaling. Although the PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase

736

inhibitor KI11502 causing this thyroid specification effect is known to effectively phenocopy

737

various developmental defects of pdgfra zebrafish mutants (50), a mechanistic interpretation

738

of this phenotype remains quite puzzling. First, similar to the normal endoderm development

739

reported in pdgfra-deficient zebrafish (50, 80), anterior endoderm formation was unaffected in

740

KI11502-treated embryos. Second, while ligands of the PDGF receptor are expressed in

741

anterior endoderm of zebrafish (pdgfaa, pdgfab) and in murine ventral foregut endoderm

742

(Pdgfa), expression of PDGF receptors is essentially absent in the anterior endoderm during

743

periods of thyroid specification in mouse and zebrafish (50, 81). Together, these findings

744

point to a non-cell autonomous mechanism possibly involving interactions between endoderm

745

and adjacent tissues. Accordingly, it was of particular interest that KI11502-treated embryos

746

displayed a very specific cardiac developmental phenotype; a delay of midline fusion of the

747

bilateral heart fields and heart tube assembly. Around the time of thyroid specification (23/24

748

hpf), this cardiac-specific delay resulted in a peculiar anatomical constellation where the

749

prospective thyroid region within the anterior endoderm is juxtaposed to an enlarged cardiac

750

field if compared to the anatomically more discrete and smaller arterial pole structures of the

751

forming heart tube present at this stage in control embryos. One intriguing hypothesis is that

752

due to the mispositioning of an enlarged field of cardiac mesoderm, an expanded region of

753

anterior endoderm could be exposed to cardiac-borne signals with instructive capacity to

754

induce endodermal nkx2.4b expression. Since KI11502 treatment effectively phenocopied the

755

cardiac fusion defects of zebrafish pdgfra mutants (50, 80), such mutant models will provide

756

an important resource for further experimental studies to verify or refute this hypothesis in

757

genetic model systems.

758

During phenotyping of embryos at 55 hpf, we noticed that global manipulation of signaling

759

pathways often results in grossly disorganized morphogenesis of the pharyngeal region

760

including tissues surrounding the developing thyroid. This was particularly evident for the
33

761

OFT region and the pharyngeal vasculature. Accordingly, caution is required in such cases

762

when attempting to mechanistically link early signal perturbations to late stage thyroid

763

phenotypes. Likely, certain late thyroid phenotypes could result from an overall

764

maldevelopment of the tissue neighbo578rhood rather than from specific signaling

765

perturbations acting directly on developing thyroid cells. In mouse and zebrafish, the nascent

766

thyroid bud is associated with tissues of the cardiac OFT, most prominent is the direct

767

apposition to the aortic sac (8, 15). A number of previous studies demonstrated that aberrant

768

vessel development is often associated with irregular thyroid morphogenesis (11, 15, 54, 82)

769

suggesting that the thyroid primordium is responsive to instructive cues from pharyngeal

770

vessels influencing size, shape and localization of the diverticulum after detachment from the

771

pharyngeal floor epithelium. Results from our screen reinforced this view as, in fact, most

772

experimental treatments causing irregular and enlarged domains of tg expression in stage 55

773

hpf embryos showed concurrent defects in formation of the anterior arch arteries and the

774

hypobranchial artery; i.e. vessels previously shown to guide positioning of thyroid tissue in

775

zebrafish embryos and larvae (15, 82). The identification of a massively enlarged aortic sac

776

due to cardiac dysfunction as the cause for a seemingly ectopic positioning of thyroid buds in

777

TGFβ inhibitor-treated embryos further underscored the value of a combined thyroid and

778

cardiovascular phenotyping approach for enhanced phenotype interpretation.

779
780

We also identified signaling pathways that appeared to have, if any, only a subordinate role in

781

early zebrafish thyroid development. Consistent with conclusions reached in previous mouse

782

and Xenopus studies (11, 17, 54, 83), results from our three screens indicate that Shh

783

signaling is dispensable for thyroid specification. If detected, abnormalities in thyroid anlage

784

formation coincided with impaired anterior endoderm formation (somitogenesis screen) and

785

treatment with potent inducers of Shh signaling (i.e. purmorphamine) did not evoke detectable

786

thyroid abnormalities in any of our screens. Moreover, cyclopamine-induced thyroid

787

abnormalities present in later stage embryos always occurred along with defective cardiac

788

OFT and pharyngeal vessel morphogenesis.

789

Thyroid phenotyping of embryos in all three screens failed to detect effects of Notch pathway

790

inhibition on early zebrafish thyroid development indicating if any only a minor role of

791

Notch-mediated lateral inhibition in the regulation of thyroid anlage specification and thyroid

792

primordium formation during normal development. Consistent results were obtained using

793

two new generation Notch pathway inhibitors, LY411575 and RO4929097, both of which

794

inhibit γ-secretase activity, an accepted pharmacological approach to effectively block the

795

Notch pathway in multiple model systems (84). Embryos treated with LY411575 and

796

RO4929097 in our screens displayed well documented phenotypes of Notch pathway

797

inhibition (85, 86) indicating that Notch signaling was effectively blocked by our

798

experimental conditions. One previous zebrafish study reported significant increases in the

799

size of the thyroid anlage (24 hpf) and the thyroid primordium (48 hpf) in Delta-Notch

800

signaling-deficient mindbomb mutants compared to their WT siblings and significantly

801

enlarged thyroid primordia following treatment with another γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT (87).

802

Although the reasons for the conflicting findings are currently unknown, it remains possible

803

that the prominent pharyngeal vessel anomalies detected in mindbomb mutants and DAPT-

804

treated embryos contributed to a stronger thyroid phenotype. In our experiments, only few

805

embryos treated with high concentrations of RO4929097 showed mild thyroid anomalies,

806

cardiac edema and vascular defects at stage 55 hpf. Given recent data on a possible

807

association of defective JAG1-Notch signaling with congenital hypothyroidism (88), further

808

experimental studies are needed to examine NOTCH-dependent developmental processes

809

during thyroid morphogenesis.

811

In summary, our studies showed that small molecule screening approaches are a valuable tool

812

to uncover the role of major signaling pathways during thyroid morphogenesis in zebrafish.

813

Our pharmacological screens identified BMP and FGF signaling as key factors for thyroid

814

specification and early thyroid organogenesis in zebrafish, revealed the importance of low

815

Wnt activities during early development for normal thyroid specification and corroborated

816

further evidence for the contention that pharyngeal vessels provide guidance for size, shape

817

and localization of thyroid tissue. Moreover, we identified several cases where the specific

818

thyroid phenotype is likely due to perturbed local signaling as a result of defective cardiac

819

mesoderm development. Given the plentiful signaling biosensor models available to the

820

zebrafish community (89), studies are now required to map sites of action for critical

821

pathways such as BMP and FGF signaling during early zebrafish development. By comparing

822

our results with available data from other model organisms including Xenopus, chicken and

823

mouse, we found that signaling cues regulating thyroid development appear broadly

824

conserved across vertebrates. Thus, we expect that findings in the zebrafish model can inform

825

mammalian models of thyroid organogenesis to further our understanding of the molecular

826

mechanisms of congenital thyroid diseases. Moreover, we are confident that our data sets will

827

provide a valuable resource enabling the formulation of new and testable hypotheses with

828

respect to patterning cues that could improve the efficiency of in vitro stem cell-based

829

protocols to generate thyroid cells.

Figure 1. Timing of small molecule treatments and main endpoint analyses. Experimental

1111

design. The left of the schematic illustration highlights how periods of small molecule

1112

treatment during screening assays I (gastrula screen), II (somitogenesis screen) and III

1113

(pharyngula screen) relate temporally to early zebrafish development and key events of

1114

thyroid morphogenesis. Time points along the arbitrarily scaled axis are given in hours post

1115

fertilization (hpf). Note that treatment periods in the gastrula screen (6 – 10 hpf) and

1116

somitogenesis screen (10 – 26 hpf) cover developmental periods preceding thyroid anlage

1117

formation (around 23/24 hpf) whereas the treatment period in the pharyngula screen (24 – 54

1118

hpf) covers the developmental period after the onset of thyroid anlage formation. The right

1119

part of the scheme summarizes the timing of main endpoint analyses for each assay.

1120

Endpoints include examination of thyroid (nkx2.4b, tg) and cardiac (myl7) marker expression

1121

by in situ hybridization and evaluation of GFP reporter expression patterns in transgenic

1122

zebrafish embryos (marked by green letters).

1125

were treated from 6 to 10 hpf with inhibitors (i) or activators (a) of major signaling pathways.

1126

At 28 and 55 hpf, expression of thyroid (nkx2.4b, tg) and cardiac (myl7) markers was assessed

1127

by single and dual-color in situ hybridization. Note that nkx2.4b is expressed in the thyroid

1128

anlage and the ventral forebrain (fb). Black arrowheads point to domains of thyroid marker

1129

expression and red arrows point to the developing heart. Phenotypic comparison of thyroid

1130

development in treated and control embryos (DMSO, dimethylsulfoxide) at 28 hpf revealed

1131

enhanced expression of the early thyroid marker nkx2.4b (#8,13), aberrant posterior expansion

1132

of the thyroidal nkx2.4b expression domain (#6,8,17,18) and severe reduction or complete

1140

embryos were treated from 6 to 10 hpf with a panel of 20 small molecule compounds known

1141

to inhibit (black letters) or activate (red letters) specific signaling pathways. Control groups

1142

included non-treated embryos (NT) and embryos treated with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or

1143

ethanol (EtOH). Bar graphs depict quantification of the proportion of specimen displaying

1144

abnormal thyroid development as determined by nkx2.4b staining of 28 hpf embryos (upper

1145

panel) and tg staining of 55 hpf embryos (lower panel). Results are shown for the highest test

1146

concentration of each compound and data are presented as the percentage of embryos

1147

displaying a particular phenotype. Thyroid phenotypes were classified into seven categories

1148

according to the overall expression level of the marker gene and apparent deviations from

embryos showed irregularly expanded domains of tg expression (PDGF-i, #9,10; VEGF-i,

1174

#15), irregularly positioned and reduced domains of tg expression (Shh-i, #20) and overtly
