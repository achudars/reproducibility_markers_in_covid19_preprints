ABSTRACT

Epidemiological studies have shown that female smokers are at higher risk of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD). Female patients have worse symptoms and health status and
increased risk of exacerbations. We determined the differences in the transcriptome of the airway
epithelium between males and females at baseline and in response to smoking. We processed
public gene expression data of human airway epithelium into a discovery cohort of 211 subjects
(never smokers n=68; current smokers n=143) and two replication cohorts of 104 subjects (21
never, 52 current, and 31 former smokers) and 238 subjects (99 current and 139 former smokers.
We analyzed gene differential expression with smoking status, sex, and smoking-by-sex
interaction and used network approaches for modules’ level analyses. We identified and
replicated two differentially expressed modules between the sexes in response to smoking with
genes located throughout the autosomes and not restricted to sex chromosomes. The two
modules were enriched in autophagy (up-regulated in female smokers) and response to virus and
type 1 interferon signaling pathways which were down-regulated in female smokers compared to
males. The results offer insights into the molecular mechanisms of the sexually dimorphic COPD
risk and presentation potentially enabling a precision medicine approach to COPD.

INTRODUCTION
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects more than 300 million people and is the
3rd leading cause of death worldwide 1. In Canada, COPD is the leading cause of hospitalization,
accounting for 80,000 hospital admissions per year2. While historically men used to smoke more,
there has been a marked rise in the prevalence of smoking among women since the 1960’s,
leading to a sharp increase in the burden of COPD among women. In the year 2000 the number
of women dying of COPD surpassed that of men in the United States 3, and in Canada recent
estimates suggest that that there are approximately 85% more female COPD patients than male
patients 4. Our group has reported previously that female smokers experience a heightened risk
of COPD, particularly following menopause 5. These data have been validated in a study
involving 149,075 women and 100,252 men in the UK Biobank 6. For the same severity of
airflow obstruction, female patients have increased shortness of breath, poorer quality of life and
health status and greater functional impairment than male patients7. Furthermore, women with
COPD are more likely to experience increased risk of exacerbations 8.
There is a growing body of evidence from histological, imaging and animal models to support
the notion that females have more airways disease and less emphysema compared to male COPD
patients9,10. In a murine model where male and female (ovariectomized and ovary-intact) mice
were exposed to smoke for 6 months, the female mice with intact ovaries had significantly
thicker small airway walls but had similar degrees of emphysema compared with male or
ovariectomized female mice 11.
Females are also thought to have augmented xenobiotic metabolism of inhaled chemicals such as
nicotine

12

. Since some metabolites of nicotine may be toxic, the sex-related differences in

xenometabolism maybe an important driver of increased female susceptibility to COPD 13,14.
We have shown in vitro that females have enhanced ability to produce oxidants in the airways in
response to cigarette smoking, leading to increased airway damage 15,16.
To further understand the sexual dimorphism in disease risk and response to smoking, we
determined whether there were major differences in the transcriptome of the airway epithelium
between males and females at baseline and in response to smoking.

RESULTS
The demographics of the discovery and replication cohorts are described in Table 1. The
discovery set included 68 never smokers and 143 current smokers while the replication set
included 21 never smokers, 31 former smokers and 52 current smokers. There were no
statistically significant differences in age or pack-years between female never smokers, female
current smokers, male never smokers and male current smokers in the discovery or the
replication sets (all Bonferroni adjusted p-values > 0.05). We also used a third dataset
(GSE37147) for potential replication although it only contained data on former and current
smokers (i.e. there were no never-smokers). However, compared to the discovery or the
replication sets, the female current smokers, the subjects in GSE37147 were significantly older
(all Bonferroni adjusted p-values < 0.05). The male current smokers in GSE37147 also had
increased pack-years compared to those in the discovery or thereplication sets (Bonferroni
adjusted p-values < 0.05). The female current smokers in GSE37147 had increased pack-years
compared to those in the discovery set (Bonferroni adjusted p-value = 9.04E-03) but not to those
in the replication set (Bonferroni adjusted p-value = 0.95).

Prediction of sex in the replication set
The best-performing elastic net-regularized logistic regression model consisted of three probes
and together they demonstrated 100% cross-validated AUC in the training dataset. These three
probes corresponded to RPS4Y1, DDX3Y and KDM5D genes, which are located on the Ychromosome. The model was then evaluated in the testing dataset and also showed perfect ability
to discriminate with an AUC of 100% (Supplementary Figure 2A and 2B). After confirming
the model performance, we applied it to the replication set to classify the subjects into 79 males
and 25 females (Supplementary Figure 2C).

Differential expression with sex and smoking
As shown in the PCA plot in Supplementary Figure 1E, there was clear clustering in the gene
expression profiles of the discovery set, the replication set and GSE37147. The differences may
be related to different microarray platforms that were used and different generations of the
airway that were sampled across the 3 studies
In the discovery set, 8,000 probes, corresponding to 5,466 genes, were differentially expressed
between never and current smokers after adjustment for sex, age, COPD, ethnicity and packyears of smoking (FDR < 0.1) and 735 of these genes were replicated in the replication set (at a
threshold of P < 0.05) (Figure 2A and 2B). A gene was considered “replicated” if any of the
probes showed differential expression between never and current smokers in both the discovery
and replication sets with the same direction of effect. The top three replicated genes associated
with smoking were ADH7 (FDR=1.15E-32), GPX2 (FDR=1.43E-31) and ALDH3A1
(FDR=8.56E-31), which were all up-regulated in current smokers. We also validated the
discovery in a second replication set GSE37147; out of the 735 replicated genes, 526 were
further replicated in GSE37147 in former versus current smokers.
A total of 169 probes, corresponding to 100 genes were differentially expressed between males
and females after adjustment for smoking status, age, ethnicity and pack-years (FDR < 0.1) and
27 of these genes were replicated in the replication set -(P < 0.05) (Figure 3C and 3D). Four of
the replicated genes, CCND2, FABP5, NLRP2, and SERPINB3, are on the autosome. CCND2
and NLRP2 were down-regulated in males while FABP5 and SERPINB3 were up-regulated in

males. The top three genes differentially expressed between males and females werewere
RPS4Y1 (FDR=3.98E-88), DDX3Y (FDR=4.33E-86) and EIF1AY (FDR=6.79E-82), which
arelocated on the Y-chromosome (all three genes were up-regulated in males). Additional
evaluation using GSE37147 replicated 22 out of the 27 replicated genes, including CCND2 and
NLRP2.
The complete lists of genes that were significantly associated with smoking status and sex are
shown in Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Table 3, respectively.
Sexually dimorphic gene expression changes in response to smoking
Having identified genes differentially expressed according to sex and smoking status, we next
identified sexually dimorphic genes in response to smoking. In the discovery set, 3,416 probes,
corresponding to 2,654 genes were associated with sex-by-smoking interaction -(FDR < 0.1)
(Figure 2E). In the replication set, 1,737 probes, corresponding to 1,423 genes, were associated
with sex-by-smoking interaction - (P < 0.05) (Figure 2F). A total of 184 genes showed
differential expression between never and current smokers in both datasets and within the same
direction (Figure 3A). The top three replicated genes were RALGDS (FDR=2.19E-03), DNAI2
(FDR=9.84E-03) and DGKZ (FDR=1.48E-03). The sexually dimorphic genes in response to
smoking were not restricted to the XY chromosome; 96.5% of the associated genes in the
discovery set and 94.0% of the 184 replicated genes were located on the autosome (Figures 4A
and 4B). The lists of probes that were associated with the sex-by-smoking interaction term are
shown in Supplementary Table 4 in the discovery and the replication sets. Interestingly, the
number of replicated genes decreased to 26 when we combined the never and former smokers
together and compared them with the current smokers in the replication set, despite the increase
in sample size (Figure 3B). The number of replicated genes decreased to 9 if we compared the
former smokers to the current smokers in the replication set (Figure 3C). Similarly, when
GSE37147 (containing current and former smokers but no never-smokers) was used as the
replication set, only 14 genes were replicated (Figure 3D). Figure 3E shows the expression of
the top three replicated genes in both the discovery and the replication set (never vs. current
smokers). If we use GSE37147 to further replicate the 184 replicated genes, only one gene,
PLCB2, was also replicated in GSE37147.

Module-level associations
Based on the expression of 12,537 genes in the discovery set, 37 gene modules were constructed.
The module sizes ranged from 17 genes in the “yellowgreen” module to 3,822 genes in the
“turquoise” module. Eleven modules were significantly associated with smoking status (never
vs. current smokers) after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity and pack-years of smoking (FDR <
0.1) in the discovery set. Four of these modules, “darkgreen”, “greenyellow”, “grey60”, and
“midnightblue”, were successfully replicated in the replication set (never and former vs. current
smokers) at a threshold of P < 0.05.
Only the “yellowgreen” module was associated with sex after -(FDR < 0.1) in the discovery set
and this module was also replicated in the replication set at a threshold of P < 0.05.
Thirteen modules were associated with sex-by-smoking interaction -in the discovery set (FDR <
0.1). Three modules, “blue”, “darkmagenta”, and “yellowgreen”, were successfully replicated in
the replication set (P < 0.05).

The “darkmagenta” and the “yellowgreen” modules were

relatively small in size with 18 and 17 genes while the “blue” module included 1860 genes. The
module-phenotype association along with the module sizes for the replicated modules are shown
in Figure 5. The associations between the modules and the phenotypes are shown in
Supplementary Table 5.
Enrichment in Biological Processes
An FDR cutoff of 0.1 was used to identify Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes that were
associated with the replicated modules. Among modules that were associated with smoking
status, the “darkgreen” module genes were associated with protein complex assembly and the top
genes with the highest MM in this module were NPAS3, CYP4X1 and PGRMC1. The
“greenyellow” module genes were associated with metabolic processes, responses to oxidative
stress and homeostasis and the top members of this module were AKR1B10, GPX2, AKR1C2.
The “midnightblue” module gene were related to cornification, protein glycosylation and viral
entry into host cell. The top members of the “midnightblue” module are ST14, HM13, TMPRSS4.
No significant pathways were enriched in the “grey60” module and the top members of this
module were CEACAM5, GALE and AGR2.

Of the three modules associated with sex-by-smoking interaction, all the genes in the
“yellowgreen” module belonged to the X and Y chromosomes and showed enrichment in
translational initiation, protein targeting to endoplasmic reticulum and histone demethylation.
The top members of the “yellowgreen” module were DDX3Y, KDM5D and USP9Y. This module
was also associated with sex. For the remaining two modules, the “darkmagenta” module
showed strong association with defense responses to virus, regulation of innate immune
response, membrane fusion and Th2 cell cytokine production. The genes with the highest MM in
the “darkmagenta module” are DDX60, SAMD9 and IFI44. The “blue” module was related to
autophagy, biological processes of mitochondrion, cellular response to oxidative stress and
negative regulation of the MAPK signaling cascade. The top members of the “blue” module are
RALY, UQCRC1 and MAP2K2. Table 2 shows the top GO biological processes enriched in the
replicated modules and Supplementary Table 6 shows the complete enrichment results for the
replicated modules. Supplementary Table 7 shows the list of top 10 genes with the highest
membership in each module.

In Figure 6, the gene expression changes for genes in the significant pathways: autophagy and
response to virus are shown in males and females separately in response to smoking. While
genes in autophagy pathway show little change in males, they were significantly up-regulated in
females in response to smoking. On the other hand, genes in the viral response pathway showed
little change in males but were significantly down-regulated in females in response to smoking.
Enrichment in transcription factor binding site (TFBS)
An FDR cutoff of 0.05 and an odds ratio > 2 were used to identify TFBSs that were enriched in
the replicated modules. For modules that were associated with smoking status, 13 TFBSs were
enriched in the “darkgreen” module, 8 TFBSs were enriched in the “greenyellow” module, no
TFBSs were enriched in the “grey60” module and 1 TFBS was enriched in the “midnightblue”
module. No TFBS was enriched in the “yellowgreen” module which was associated with sex and
sex-by-smoking interaction. For the remaining two modules that were associated with sex-bysmoking interaction, 72 TFBSs were enriched in the “blue” module including estrogen-related
receptor alpha (ESRRA), and 7 TFBSs were enriched in the “darkmagenta” module.
Supplementary Table 8 shows the complete list of enriched TFBSs in each module.

DISCUSSION
Studying the transcriptome is a very powerful hypothesis-free approach to elucidate the
molecular mechanisms underlying diseases and phenotypes. In this study, we analyzed the
differential transcriptomics of human airway epithelium at baseline and in response to smoking
between males and females u. and found that 1) smoking has a large and reproducible effect on
gene expression profiles; 2) the smoking effects on the transcriptome of human airways are
modified by the underlying sex of the individual; 3) the sexually dimorphic smoking genes are
common throughout the autosome and not restricted to sex chromosomes; and 4) the sexually
dimorphic smoking genes are enriched in biological processes that are related to virus, anti-viral
responses, type 1 interferon signaling, and autophagy.
There is increasing interest in understanding sexual dimorphisms across organs and tissues. In
the study of Melé et al.17, the authors investigated sexual dimorphism in gene expression data of
1,641 samples from 175 individuals representing 43 sites and identified 753 genes that had tissue
specific sex-biased expression (FDR < 0.05). Chen et al.18 used a much larger sample size
(compared to Melé et al.) and investigated sexual dimorphism in gene expression data from the
GTEx dataset: they evaluated 8,716 human transcriptomes collected from 31 tissues in 549
individuals of whom 188 were females (34%). The authors observed sexually dimorphic gene
expression for 10% of the genes across autosomes in most tissues including the lung. The most
sexually dimorphic gene expression were noted in the breast, skin, thyroid, brain, and adipose
tissues while the least dimorphic was the gastrointestinal tract18. Multiple other studies in single
cell or tissue types have confirmed to varying extents the large transcription differences between
the two sexes19-22. Similar patterns emerged from these studies including the presence of large
and perhaps underestimated differences in the transcriptome between males and females present
throughout the autosomes and not restricted to sex chromosomes. Extrapolating findings from
the published studies (even the large ones) to respiratory diseases is challenging since they do
not contain data on airway epithelium and lack essential phenotypic information such as
smoking. To our knowledge, the current study is the first to report sexually dimorphic gene
expression changes in human airway epithelium in response to cigarette smoking. The airway
epithelium is the initial site of injury in airway diseases such as COPD and is an important
mediator of the host’s immune response to inhaled toxins, allergens and medications 23.

We found that smoking differentially altered two main pathways in men versus women. These
included those related to host’s response to viruses (e.g. type 1 interferon signaling) and
autophagy. In females, our study revealed that most autophagy genes were up-regulated in
response to smoking compared to males where these genes were either down-regulated or only
slightly up-regulated (Figure 6A). Autophagy is a physiological process that maintains
homeostatic removal, degradation, and recycling of damaged proteins in response to
physiological (e.g. development and immunity) and even pathological stressors such as oxidative
stress

24

. Increased autophagy has been reported in the lungs of COPD patients, in cigarette

smoke-exposed mice as well as in airway epithelial cells exposed to cigarette smoke extracts in
vitro 25,26. The disruption of autophagy caused by smoking may lead to epithelial loss of function
and cell death27 which may adversely impact physiologic processes such as mucociliary
clearance, and cellular senescence, which together would increase the risk of disease24,28,29.
Interestingly, sexual dimorphism in autophagy has been demonstrated in the spinal cord and
skeletal muscles in mice 30 as well as the human hippocampus 31.

The other sexually dimorphic pathway in response in smoking was type 1 interferon signaling
and response to virus. Genes in this pathway were down-regulated in females in response to
smoking while being neutral or slightly up-regulated in males (Figure 6B). Previous studies have
demonstrated that smoking affects the lung epithelium’s ability to produce the early inductive,
and amplification phases of the type I interferon response and decreases the ability to elicit an
antiviral response

32,33

. Furthermore, these effects were reversible and are almost completely

abrogated with the antioxidant glutathione32. The sexual dimorphism in immune response to
viruses is well described (reviewed in

34,35

). The reasons underlying this sexually dimorphic

response is attributed to sex hormones, sex chromosomes linked genes involved in viral response
or genes on autosomes that seem to be regulated by sex chromosome linked genes

34

. Certain

sexually dimorphic immune responses are however present throughout life, and not necessarily
between the years of puberty and reproductive senescence, suggesting that both genes and
hormones are involved 36. In general, females are thought to mount a stronger immune response
to viral infections compared to males due to a more robust humoral and cellular immune
response resulting in higher male mortality observed in epidemiological studies37. This is also
consistent with observations that females have a higher risk to many autoimmune diseases38. We

observed an enrichment in many transcription factors for the autophagy module including the
estrogen-related receptor alpha ESRRA (enrichment FDR = 7.02E-33) suggesting the biological
differences are not only due to the hormonal effect. Further studies are needed to understand the
clinical consequences of this sexually dimorphic virus response to smoking with regard to COPD
risk, progression as well as exacerbations attributed to viral and bacterial infections. The finding
of down-regulation of anti-viral response pathway genes in females in response to smoking is
consistent with the epidemiological observations of higher exacerbation rate in females
compared to males8.

We have used both gene and network level analyses in this study. The network level approach to
transcriptomic data is biologically intuitive since it takes into account the phenomenon of gene
co-expression. We have previously used network approach using WGCNA to identify a
reproducible signature for lung function in peripheral blood39. The approach allows the
identification of hub genes that reflect the biological processes of their corresponding modules.
For example, the “hub” gene for the virus response enriched module “darkmagenta” is DDX60
(DExD/H-box helicase 60) gene; a gene that is involved in antiviral response 40.

The definition of smoking has a big effect on discovery and replication of sexually dimorphic
gene expression in response to smoking. When we included the data from GSE37147 (Sterling et
al.) which included former and current smokers (but no never smokers) for replication, although
the sample size is large (n=238), the replication was poor and hence was not used for replication
(Figure 3D). Similarly, when we included both former and never smokers in our replication
cohort vs. current smokers, and despite the increase in sample size, fewer genes were actually
replicated compared to when we only included never vs. current smokers (Figure 3A-3C). This
is consistent with previous findings from our group highlighting the importance of case
definition of smokers on gene signature discovery41.

This study has a number of limitations. First, the sample size, although large, may not be
sufficient to detect and replicate genes with smaller effects. Second, we used self-reported
smoking status based on available data on GEO but self-reports may not accurately reflect
smoking habits41. Third, we studied changes in airway epithelium given its role in the

pathogenesis of lung diseases, but smoking may also affect other cell types such as immune and
infiltrating cells in the airways. Finally, changes at gene expression may not necessarily reflect
changes in protein levels or activities.

In summary, our study demonstrated that while smoking has a large effect on the transcriptome
of airway epithelium, it differentially affects the viral response and autophagy pathways in
female smokers compared to males. Such differential expression may explain the increased risk
for disease and exacerbation among female smokers. These findings will stimulate mechanistic
studies on how sex-specific genes impact risk to smoking related diseases such as COPD.

METHODS
Data collection
The search terms “airway epithelium” was used to identify gene expression studies of human
airway epithelium gene expression from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). After excluding
irrelevant studies such as cancer, virus infection, influenza and injury, we have identified 18
studies with phenotypic information on subjects’ sex, smoking status and pack-years of smoking.
Information on these 18 studies is shown in Supplementary Table 1. Of the studies identified,
16 were reported by the same lab and generated using the same microarray platform (U133A
Plus 2.0 array). These datasets were combined together to form the “discovery” set. Phenotypic
information such as sex, smoking status, age, COPD status, ethnicity and pack-years were
available for 211 subjects (never smokers n=68; current smokers n=143) after removing
duplicate data and outliers. GSE7895, which was generated using the U133A array, was used as
the “replication” set consisting of 21 never smokers, 52 current smokers, and 31 former smokers.
Smoking status, age and pack years were available from GEO for GSE7895 but the sex
information was missing which was imputed for this cohort based on gene expression data from
the discovery cohort (see below). GSE37147, which was generated using the GeneChip Human
Gene 1.0 ST Array, was used as an additional replication cohort. Smoking status, sex, pack-years
and lung function measurements of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and
FEV1/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) were available for 99 current smokers and 139 former
smokers. Figure 1 shows a flowchart of the overall study design.

Data processing
Raw data (.CEL files) were downloaded from GEO for the discovery set, the replication set and
GSE37147. Since the 16 studies of the discovery set contained overlapping samples, we
carefully examined the phenotypic information of each sample to remove biological and
technical replicates. No batch effect was detected among these studies using principal component
analysis (Supplementary Figure 1A). The raw data of the discovery set were then normalized
together using the Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) method. Similar to the discovery set, the
replication set was also normalized using the RMA method (Supplementary Figure 1B). The
presence of outliers was assessed using a principal component analysis before and after

normalization for both the discovery and replication sets. Three outliers were observed and
removed from the discovery set (Supplementary Figure 1C) while no obvious outliers were
observed in the replication set (Supplementary Figure 1D). GSE37147 was also processed
similarly and no obvious batch effect or outliers were detected. Large differences in the gene
expression profiles were observed among the discovery set, the replication set and GSE37147
(Supplementary Figure 1E). All data processing and statistical analysis were performed within
the R statistical computing environment (version 3.5.0).

Prediction of sex in the replication set
Since the sex information of the replication set was not available from GEO, thus we imputed the
sex of subjects using gene expression of selected XY-chromosome probes. To identify the probes
that best discriminated male from female subjects, elastic net-regularized logistic regression was
used for probe selection. The discovery set was partitioned into a training dataset, which
contained 70% of female subjects and an equal number of male subjects, and a test dataset,
which contained the remaining participants. Models with parameters were built based on the
training dataset. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) obtained from
100 repeats of a 10-fold cross-validation was used as the criterion to evaluate the performance of
the models. The performance of the model with the highest AUC was validated in the testing
dataset. Finally, the model was applied to the replication set to predict the sex information.
Comparing the demographic characteristics
We performed Kruskal-Wallis H test followed by Dunn’s test with the Bonferroni correction to
compare age and pack-years of smoking between males and females within different smoking
status strata in the discovery set, the replication set and GSE37147.
Modeling the effect of smoking and sex on gene expression
Linear regression was used to identify probes that were associated with smoking status, sex and
sex-by-smoking interaction adjusting for potential covariates such as age, ethnicity and packyears of smoking in both the discovery and replication sets. The analyses were performed using

R package limma 42. The Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to control the false discovery
rate (FDR) and to correct for multiple hypotheses testing.
Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)
The R package WGCNA

39

was used to construct gene co-expression modules with genes that

are highly correlated with each other. The workflow of WGCNA starts with creating a matrix of
Pearson correlations between genes, and transforming these into an adjacency matrix through
soft thresholding and then converting them into a topological overlap matrix (TOM)43. Modules
are defined as groups of highly interconnected genes using the average linkage hierarchical
clustering to group genes based on the topological overlap of their connectivity, followed by a
dynamic cut-tree algorithm to cluster dendrogram branches into gene modules44. Each gene
within a module will be assigned a Module Membership (MM) whose value ranges between 0
and 1 by relating the gene’s expression profile with the module eigengene determined by the first
principal component of the gene expression profiles in that module. Genes with the highest MM
are considered “hub” genes, which are thought to be central to the module.
Since the discovery set and the replication set were generated using different microarray
platforms, we first summarized the probe-level data of both sets into gene-level data using R
package Jetset

45

before performing WGCNA. Using the 12,537 genes of the discovery set, we

identified 37 gene modules and each module was assigned a color. For each of the gene module,
an eigengene, which is representative of the module expression profile, was obtained. Linear
regression was used to identify module eigengenes that were associated with smoking status, sex,
and sex-by-smoking interaction, and COPD status adjusting for ethnicity and pack-years of
smoking. To replicate our findings for modules constructed in the discovery set, we calculated
their eigengenes in the replication set and then tested for their relationships to smoking status,
sex, and sex-by-smoking interaction using linear regression. Similar to the discovery set, the
models were adjusted for potential covariates such as pack-years.
Enrichment analysis
For gene modules that were successfully replicated in the replication set, we performed
enrichment analyses using R package clusterProfiler

46

and TFEA.ChIP

47

to identify Gene

Ontology (GO) biological processes and transcription factor binding sites that were enriched in
the module genes.
