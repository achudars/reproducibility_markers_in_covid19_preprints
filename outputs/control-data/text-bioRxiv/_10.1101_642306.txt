Abstract

36

Understanding the genomic signatures, genes, and traits underlying local adaptation of organisms

37

to heterogeneous environments is of central importance to the field evolutionary biology. Mixed

38

linear mrsodels that identify allele associations to environment, while controlling for genome-

39

wide variation at other loci, have emerged as the method of choice when studying local

40

adaptation. Despite their importance, it is unclear whether this approach performs better than

41

identifying environmentally-associated SNPs without accounting for population structure. To

42

examine this, we first use the mixed linear model GEMMA, and simple Spearman correlations,

43

to identify SNPs showing significant associations to climate with and without accounting for

44

population structure. Subsequently, using Italy and Sweden populations, we compare evidence of

45

allele frequency differentiation (F ST ), linkage disequilibrium (LD), fitness variation, and

46

functional constraint, underlying these SNPs. Using a lenient cut-off for significance, we find

47

that SNPs identified by both approaches, and SNPs uniquely identified by Spearman

48

correlations, were enriched at sites showing genomic evidence of local adaptation and function

49

but were limited across Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) explaining fitness variation. SNPs

50

uniquely identified by GEMMA, showed no direct or indirect evidence of local adaptation, and

51

no enrichment along putative functional sites. Finally, SNPs that showed significantly high F ST

52

and LD, were enriched along fitness QTL peaks and cis-regulatory/nonsynonymous sites

53

showing significant functional constraint. Using these SNPs, we identify genes underlying

54

fitness QTL, and genes linking flowering time to local adaptation. These include a regulator of

55

abscisic-acid (FLDH) and flowering time genes PIF3, FIO1, and COL5.

Introduction

61

Populations of a species may inhabit different environments where local selection pressures

62

favor a combination of (multivariate) phenotypes (Leimu and Fischer 2008; Conover, et al. 2009;

63

Hereford 2009; Savolainen, et al. 2013). Once locally adapted, the resident genotype is expected,

64

on average, to have a higher relative fitness than a foreign genotype (Kawecki and Ebert 2004).

65

Despite the widespread evidence of local adaptation in many taxa (Leimu and Fischer 2008;

66

Jeong and Di Rienzo 2014; Arguello, et al. 2016), our understanding of the traits involved, its

67

genetic basis, and its environmental underpinnings is still at an infant stage (Savolainen, et al.

68

2013; Tiffin and Ross-Ibarra 2014; Wadgymar, et al. 2017).

69
70

In a variety of species, reciprocal transplant and common garden/laboratory experiments have

71

showed significant adaptive differentiation between natural populations inhabiting different

72

environments (Via 1991; Hendry, et al. 2002; Savolainen, et al. 2007; Ågren and Schemske

73

2012; Kaufmann, et al. 2017; Phifer-Rixey, et al. 2018). Furthermore, in plants and animals,

74

mapping experiments have uncovered Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) for traits that are thought to

75

underlie local adaptation (Colosimo, et al. 2004; Oakley, et al. 2014; Yang, et al. 2016; Ågren, et

76

al. 2017), in addition to QTL explaining fitness differences across environments (Ågren, et al.

77

2013; Anderson, et al. 2013). Despite the importance of QTL studies in providing direct

78

evidence for local adaptation (Ågren, et al. 2013), in many instances they provide a low

79

resolution for its genetic basis, and in practical terms are time consuming, expensive, and labor

80

intense (Joosen, et al. 2009).

82

With the advent of low-cost, and fast, next generation sequencing (Henson, et al. 2012), higher

83

resolution population genomics approaches have emerged as the new means for examining the

84

genetic basis of local adaptation. (Lachance and Tishkoff 2013; Savolainen, et al. 2013; Tiffin

85

and Ross-Ibarra 2014; Sork 2017). In brief, these methods include: (a) identifying single

86

nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showing significant allele frequency differentiation between

87

populations (F ST ) (Beaumont and Balding 2004; Foll and Gaggiotti 2008; de Villemereuil and

88

Gaggiotti 2015); (b) identifying genomic regions showing significant increases in linkage

89

disequilibrium (Jacobs, et al. 2016) or composite likelihood ratios for recent sweeps (DeGiorgio,

90

et al. 2016; Huber, et al. 2016); and (c) alleles showing significant correlations to

91

environment/climate (Hancock, et al. 2011; Jones, et al. 2012; Lasky, et al. 2012; Lasky, et al.

92

2014; Pluess, et al. 2016; Yeaman, et al. 2016; Monroe, et al. 2018; Price, et al. 2018). The latter

93

approach has gained particular attention because it can be implemented on the basis of individual

94

(as opposed to population-based) sampling, and furthermore it provides a direct link to

95

ecologically relevant factors (e.g., climate).

96
97

Despite the ability of population genomic methods to identify candidate genetic variation

98

underlying local adaptation, it is hard to disentangle the effects of selection from demographic

99

history (Lotterhos and Whitlock 2014; Hoban, et al. 2016). Geographically varying environments

100

can generate population structure in the regions of genes involved in adaptation, even under

101

conditions (e.g. high gene flow) that do not generate population structure at a genome-wide level

102

(McKay and Latta 2002). The degree to which population structure influences the patterns of

103

genome-wide LD and therefore the occurrence of false positives has emerged as a critical hurdle

104

(Platt, et al. 2010). To limit the number of spurious associations, studies usually estimate

105

population structure using different methods (Price, et al. 2010), incorporate population structure

106

(Yu, et al. 2006; Kang, et al. 2010; Wang, et al. 2011; Zhou and Stephens 2012) and/or

107

geographic structure (Lasky et al. 2012) into statistical models, and finally test whether certain

108

loci explain significantly higher variation in environment/climate than population structure itself

109

(Hancock, et al. 2011; Lasky, et al. 2012; Fischer, et al. 2013; Huber, et al. 2014; Lasky, et al.

110

2014; Monroe, et al. 2016; Rellstab, et al. 2017; Frachon, et al. 2018; Lasky, et al. 2018; Price, et

111

al. 2018). While such approaches may limit the number of false positives, they can also lead to

112

false negatives (Bergelson and Roux 2010; Anderson, et al. 2011). According to simulations

113

(Forester, et al. 2018), when selection is spatially autocorrelated, accounting for population

114

structure reduces the power to detect loci under selection (Forester, et al. 2018).

115
116

The negative effects of accounting for population structure, may explain the reduced signal of

117

genetic convergence to climate among distantly related conifers (Yeaman, et al. 2016).

118

Furthermore, in Arabidopsis thaliana, it may underlie the lack of significant associations

119

between climate-correlated SNPs and fitness QTL exhibiting genetic tradeoffs (Price, et al.

120

2018); and the lack of SNPs showing significant associations to drought survival among

121

Eurasian accessions (Exposito-Alonso, et al. 2018). Finally, in the plant Capsella bursa‐pastoris,

122

accounting for population structure explained all variation in gene expression among ecotypes

123

that differed in important life-history traits such as flowering time and circadian rhythm

124

(Kryvokhyzha, et al. 2016).

125
126

In conjunction to population genomic signatures of selection or significant associations to

127

climate, genetic variation underlying local adaptation is expected to be enriched along sites that

128

are functional and influence fitness. SNPs showing significant associations to climate were found

129

to be significantly enriched among nonsynonymous, but also synonymous variation (Hancock, et

130

al. 2011; Lasky, et al. 2012). The enrichment among synonymous variation (which largely

131

evolve neutrally) maybe the result of linkage disequilibrium due to neutral processes but also

132

background selection (Charlesworth, et al. 1993) and/or hitchhiking (Gillespie 2000). A stricter

133

enrichment test will be one that controls for sequence conservation along coding and non-coding

134

sites. Sites that are highly conserved among species (Miller, et al. 2007; Haudry, et al. 2013;

135

Hupalo and Kern 2013), are assumed to be under functional/selective constraint and functionally

136

important — that is, due to purifying selection the number of tolerated mutations is limited

137

(Graur 2016). Therefore, SNPs showing significant evidence of local adaptation across highly

138

constraint sites are more likely to be true positives.

139
140

In the current study, we first examine how accounting for population structure in genome-wide

141

associations to climate may affect our ability to provide a comprehensive picture on the genetic

142

basis of local adaptation; and secondly, we use an approach that accounts for genetic signatures

143

of selection and functional constraint to detect potential genes underlying local adaptation.

144
145

More specifically, during the first phase we use 875 A. thaliana Eurasian accessions and identify

146

SNPs showing significant correlations to Minimum Temperature of Coldest Month

147

(Min.Tmp.Cld.M) using a mixed linear model that accounts for population structure (Zhou and

148

Stephens 2012) (GEMMA- Genome-wide Efficient Mixed Model Association) and simple

149

Spearman correlations (Spearman 1987) that did not account for population structure (we mainly

focused on Min.Tmp.Cld.M —a proxy to winter temperature— because of significant evidence

linking cold acclimation to local adaptation in wild populations (Ågren and Schemske 2012;

152

Oakley, et al. 2014; Gienapp, et al. 2017; Oakley, et al. 2018)). Using the two sets of SNPs, we

153

first separated them into ones identified by both methods (referred to as “Common” hereafter),

154

and ones uniquely identified by each approach (referred to as “GEMMA” and “Spearman”

155

hereafter). Thereafter, we compared evidence of local adaptation and function underlying the

156

three sets of SNPs. More specifically, using Italy and Sweden re-sequenced genomes, and QTL

157

explaining fitness variation between these populations (Ågren, et al. 2013), we examined: (a) the

158

level of allele frequency differentiation and linkage disequilibrium underlying SNPs showing

159

significant associations to climate before and after accounting for population structure; (b) how

160

these SNPs were distributed along LOD score peaks of 20 fitness QTLs (Ågren, et al. 2013); and

161

(c) how they were distributed along nonsynonymous and cis-regulatory sites showing significant

162

functional constraint among plants species of the Brassicaceae family (Haudry, et al. 2013).

163
164

During the second phase, we use SNPs showing significant evidence of local adaptation and

165

function, to identify potential genes underlying fitness QTL and flowering time variation

166

between Italy and Sweden populations. Flowering time is a life history trait that is thought to

167

play a significant role in local adaptation to climate (Hall and Willis 2006; Verhoeven, et al.

168

2008; Sandring and Agren 2009; Dittmar, et al. 2014; Ågren, et al. 2017), and whose genetic

169

basis has been thoroughly studied (Salomé, et al. 2011; Sasaki, et al. 2017). To re-examine

170

evidence linking flowering time to climate adaptation we used the following data: (1) a list of

171

genes that were experimentally shown to affect flowering time; (2) high confidence QTL

172

explaining flowering time variation between Italy and Sweden populations (Ågren, et al. 2017),

Detecting associations to climate with and without accounting for population structure

178
179

To compare allele associations to climate with and without accounting for population structure

180

we focused on the climate variable Minimum Temperature of Coldest Month (Min.Tmp.Cld.M).

181

Using a SNP genotype matrix for a panel of 1,135 globally distributed accessions downloaded

182

from the 1001 Genomes database, we filtered out accessions from outside the native Eurasian

183

and North African range of A. thaliana, as these accessions may have weaker patterns of local

184

adaptation (Lasky, et al. 2012). We also filtered out accessions that were likely laboratory

185

escapees or contaminants (Pisupati, et al. 2017), leaving 875 accessions. After we filtered for

186

biallelic SNPs with minor allele frequency >0.05, we tested association with home climate of

187

ecotype and tested for potential confounding effects of population structure using the software

188

“gemma” (Zhou and Stephens 2012). The parameters used in gemma were a MAF of 0.05

189

(default 0.01) and a missingness threshold of 0.05. For the linear mixed model option, we used

190

Wald test (default) to test for significant associations to climate. We tested models where home

191

climate was a function of SNP allele, and the association p-values we report are for the null

192

hypothesis that the mean climate occupied by the two alleles is equal (Lasky, et al. 2014). Using

193

the same set of SNPs we estimated correlations to climate using simple “Spearman” correlations

194

(Spearman 1987) and not accounting for population structure. To estimate p-values for the

195

Spearman correlations we used the ‘cor.test’ function implemented in R (Team 2009).

201

In addition to associations to climate, genomic signatures of selection were examined in North

202

Sweden and South Italy populations that represent the most northern and southern tips of

203

Eurasia. The accessions used, including latitude and longitude coordinates are found in the

204

Supplementary data file. Evidence of local adaptation/selection across SNPs between Italy and

205

Sweden populations was measured using absolute allele frequency differentiation (F ST≈

206

|𝑓𝑓𝑁𝑁.𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 − 𝑓𝑓𝑆𝑆.𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 |) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) between a SNP and its neighboring SNPs

207

with a 20kb window. LD was measured using the package ‘PLINK’ (Purcell, et al. 2007) and it

209

was estimated as the mean square coefficient of correlation (𝑟𝑟���2 ). For evidence of recent sweeps

210

computed using Sweepfinder2 (DeGiorgio, et al. 2016). We focused on CLR’s in North Sweden

211

because in other populations signals identified were very weak (Long, et al. 2013; Huber, et al.

2014; Price, et al. 2018).

To narrow down SNPs to ones that are more likely to underlie differences in function/expression

215

of protein-coding genes we focused on cis-regulatory and nonsynonymous variation that was

found along sites showing significant functional constraint. We regarded cis-regulatory SNPs as

217

those found within 1 kb upstream from the transcriptional start site of a gene (Zou, et al. 2011;

218

Pass, et al. 2017), unless these sites were found in transcribed regions of other genes (in which

219

case they were excluded). To call nonsynonymous variation we used bi-allelic sites, we used a

220

publicly available python script (callSynNonSyn.py; archived at https://github.com/kern-lab/),

221

and gene models downloaded from the TAIR database (TAR10 genome release) (Berardini, et al.

2015). To annotate regions showing significant functional constraint across the A. thaliana

genome we used phastCons scores (Siepel, et al. 2005) derived using a nine-way alignment of

224

Brassicaceae species from the study by Haudry et al. (2013). We defined conserved regions as

225

those with a score >=0.8 over blocks of >=10 nucleotides.

Fitness and flowering time QTL underlying Italy and Sweden populations

228

Quantitative trait loci explaining fitness variation between natural A. thaliana Italy and Sweden

229

populations were retrieved by the study of Ågren et al. (2013). These 20 fitness QTL were

230

assembled into 6 genetic tradeoff QTL (Ågren, et al. 2013), however we treated them as

231

independent given the very long genetic distances between fitness QTL peaks (Supplementary

232

data). Furthermore, we retrieved high confidence QTL explaining flowering time variation

233

between these populations (Ågren, et al. 2017) (Supplementary data).

Circular permutation tests

To test whether SNPs showing significant correlations to Min.Tmp.Cld.M and/or SNPs showing

237

high F ST and LD between Italy and Sweden populations are enriched along QTL peaks and

238

among cis-regulatory/nonsynonymous variation at sites showing significant functional constraint

239

we used a 1,000 circular permutations (Fig. 1).

measures. The first step involves choosing a random location along the genome and shift pvalues or allele frequency differentiations. In the next step, when examining climate
associations, we chose SNPs with a p-value less than a specified threshold. We also samples
of SNPs showing a high FST and LD. SNPs showing “significant” correlations to climate
were further partitioned into those showing “significance” using both Spearman and
GEMMA correlations (“Common”) or were unique to each approach (“GEMMA” or
“Spearman”). Using the final set of SNPs, we computed various measures of interest.

LD>0.19: 0.70 and 0.19 represent the 95th percentiles of the distributions). For climate

249

associations, SNPs were partitioned into those showing “significance” using both Spearman and

250

GEMMA associations (“Common”) or those showing “significance” using only one approach

251

(“GEMMA” or “Spearman”).

252
253

The final sets of SNPs were used to estimate the following measures: (a): % of SNPs found

254

within a certain distance (100, 200, ….600 kb) upstream and downstream of the 20 fitness QTL

255

peaks; and (b) the proportion of cis-regulatory and nonsynonymous SNPs that were within

256

regions showing significant functional constraint.

257
258

Sliding window analysis of chromosomal variation SNPs showing evidence of local adaptation

259

To detect chromosomal regions with a high proportion of SNPs showing significant evidence of

260

local adaptation we used a sliding window approach. Specifically, for a window size of 20kb and

261

a step size of 1kb we estimated the ratio of SNPs showing a specific requirement (e.g.,

262
263

𝑓𝑓𝑁𝑁.𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 − 𝑓𝑓𝑆𝑆.𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 |>0.70 and LD>0.19) over the total number of SNPs within a 20kb window.

were grown in growth chambers with the following settings: after 6 days of stratification in the

orthologs between Arabidopsis thaliana and outgroups Arabidopsis lyrata and Capsella rubella from

279

the Phytozome database (Goodstein, et al. 2012) and after aligning the coding sequences with

depicts the p-value distributions that were obtained when testing for significance using GEMMA

low p-values; many of which are likely false positives. Nonetheless, we compared the results

obtained by the two methods using different percentiles of the p-value distributions as cutoffs for

identified by both methods (“Common”) the set of “Common” and “Spearman” SNPs showed

313

significantly higher allele frequency differentiation and LD than the genome average (Fig 2A-

314

2B). On the other hand, SNPs that were unique to “GEMMA” did not show any large differences

315

in F ST and LD from the genome average (Figs 2A-2B). Furthermore, across “Common” and

316

“Spearman” SNPs we see a decrease in (|𝑓𝑓𝑁𝑁.𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 − 𝑓𝑓𝑆𝑆.𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 |) and LD as the threshold of

317

significance becomes less stringent (Figs 2A-2B). This is indicative that stronger associations

318

capture SNPs showing stronger evidence of local adaptation and recent selection. Therefore, for

319

any further tests we used the set of SNPs that were significant using the 1st percentile of the p-

320

value distributions as the cutoff.

Local adaptation is expected to lead to an increase in allele frequency differentiation and LD at

323

and near the site under selection; in other words, we would expect a positive correlation between

|𝑓𝑓𝑁𝑁.𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 − 𝑓𝑓𝑆𝑆.𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 | and LD. As shown in Figs 2C-2E all three sets of SNPs showed significant

associations between |𝑓𝑓𝑁𝑁.𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 − 𝑓𝑓𝑆𝑆.𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 | and LD. On the other hand, while “Spearman”

LD was lower (Fig. 2D) (also reflected in Fig. 2B). Finally, as expected given the small

deviations from the genome average (Figs 2A-2B), “GEMMA” SNPs showed the poorest

Direct evidence of local adaptation was shown in a study by Ågren et al. (2013) in which they

338

identified 20 QTL explaining fitness variation between Italy and Sweden populations

339

(Supplementary data). To examine population genomic evidence of local adaptation underlying

341

these QTL we first examined |𝑓𝑓𝑁𝑁.𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 − 𝑓𝑓𝑆𝑆.𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 | and LD which are measures specific to Italy

342

selection we would expect a significant enrichment of high F ST and LD SNPs. Using different

343

window sizes (100, 200, ….600 kb) from the QTL peaks we compared the observed proportion

344
345

of high F ST SNPs (|𝑓𝑓𝑁𝑁.𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 − 𝑓𝑓𝑆𝑆.𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 | >0.70 —0.70 represents the 95th percentile of the

percentile of the distribution ) to the expected proportion derived using a circular permutation

test. As expected, we observed a significantly high proportion of high F ST (>0.70) SNPs and

348

high F ST and high LD SNPs (Figs 3A-3B). A significant proportion was also observed at 200 kb,

but as window sizes became larger the proportions became insignificant (<95th percentile) and

Next, we performed the same test using SNPs showing significant associations to climate, and

SNPs that showing significant associations to climate and a high F ST and high LD. When

considering only associations to climate (Fig. S3) we find an enrichment of “Common” and

considered high F ST and high LD, none of the SNPs showed an enrichment (Fig. 3C). Among the

three sets, Spearman SNPs showed the highest observed proportion (>80th percentile). To

Given that “Common” SNPs did not show an enrichment within 100kb of the 20 fitness QTL

(14,719-14,781Mb) of a single genetic tradeoff (GT) QTL (GT QTL 2:2) (Fig. S4). Apart from

380

being limited to a single GT QTL, given the multiple fitness QTL within GT QTL 2:2 (which

381

spanned a length of ~4Mb); the multiple regions showing significant recent sweeps in Sweden;

382

and the large number of windows showing a high proportion of high F ST and LD SNPs; it is

383

highly unlikely that the “Common” set of SNPs cover all the causative genetic variation within

384

GT QTL 2:2.

385
386

To further test for enrichment of “GEMMA” SNPs showing significant associations to climate

387

and within 100 kb of fitness QTL peaks, we used an additional three climate variables (Table

388

S1). Using a lenient cutoff for significance (FDR<0.1), we only identified a few additional SNPs

389

within 100 kb of fitness QTL.

390
391

All in all, our results indicate that accounting for population structure when performing GWA to

392

climate significantly reduces our ability to capture recent selection underlying fitness QTL.

significant associations to climate ( “Common”, “GEMMA”, and “Spearman”) and SNPs

399

showing high F ST and LD ( abbreviated as “F ST &LD”) we examined their distribution among

421

Given the significant enrichment of high F ST and LD SNPs, along QTL peaks (Fig. 3B) and

422

conserved cis-regulatory and nonsynonymous sites (Figs 4A & 4B), we used them to detect

423

potential genes that may underlie fitness QTL (note: we only focused on variants within 100kb of

424

their peaks), in addition to examining evidence of local adaptation underlying a list of ~170

425

genes affecting flowering time (Supplementary data). To further narrow down on SNPs that are

426

more likely to underlie the fitness QTL examined, we only considered variation that segregated

427

between the parents used to derive the RIL’s (Ågren, et al. 2013). SNPs between the parental

428

genomes were called in a previous study (Price, et al. 2018).

429
430

Our analysis resulted in 25 genes within 100 kb of fitness QTL peaks and spanning three genetic

431

tradeoff QTL (2:2, 4:2, 5:5) (Table S2). Many of these were involved in interesting biological

432

processes such as: response to different abiotic stress factors and the abscisic-acid signaling

433

pathway which is important in abiotic stress response (Tuteja 2007) (Table S2). Among these

434

genes, two of them (AT4G33360 (FLDH), AT4G33470 (HDA14)) showed strong expression

435

GxE interactions (GxE interactions were identified in a previous study (Price, et al. 2018)) when

436

Italy and Sweden plants were grown under cold acclimation conditions (4 °C) for two weeks

437

(Gehan, et al. 2015). Interestingly, FLDH is a negative regulator of the abscisic acid signaling

438

pathway (Bhandari, et al. 2010) . As shown in Fig. 5A this gene was within a region of a genetic

439

tradeoff QTL that showed a significantly high proportion of high F ST and high LD SNPs.

440

Expression of FLDH under control and cold acclimation conditions was significantly lower in

441

Sweden than Italy plants (Fig. 5A).

Among the set of flowering time genes, we identified three (AT1G09530 (PIF3), AT2G21070

been found to affect flowering time (Oda, et al. 2004) and was found underlying a region along
chromosome 1 that showed the largest Composite Likelihood Ratio (CLR) of a recent sweep in
Sweden and windows with a high proportion of high F ST and high LD SNPs. A rooted phylogeny
of the PIF3 coding region indicated that Eurasian accessions sharing the same allele as the
Sweden parent (blue dot) show significantly higher flowering time than accessions sharing the
same allele as the Italy parent (red dot). (C) COL5 is another gene that has been found to affect
flowering time (Hassidim, et al. 2009) and in which Eurasian accessions show significant genetic
differentiation and segregation in flowering time. This gene is also found within previously
identified flowering time QTL (FlrT-5:4) (Ågren, et al. 2017) in which the Sweden genotype was
associated with longer flowering time in both Italy and Sweden

469

Eurasian accessions sharing a similar allele as the Sweden parent showed longer flowering time

470

than accessions sharing the same allele as the Italy parent (Fig. 5B). The same pattern was

471

observed when examining COL5 (Fig. 5C), a flowering time gene which was also found within a

472

flowering time QTL (FlrT-5:4, Supplementary data). According to FlrT-5:4, the Sweden

473

genotype was associated with longer flowering time in both Italy and Sweden (Ågren, et al.

474

2017). In conjunction, with its overlap to a genetic tradeoff QTL (Ågren, et al. 2017), indicates a

475

possible role in fitness tradeoffs. Studies have attributed flowering time variation within FlrT-5:4

476

to VIN3 (1001 Genomes Consortium 2016; Ågren, et al. 2017). Although it may be an additional

candidate we did not find any significant genetic differentiation and selection along coding and

Discussion

490

In the quest to study the genetic basis of local adaptation using genome wide associations to

491

environment, linear mixed models have emerged as a powerful tool given their ability to account

492

for population structure while testing for significant associations (Yu, et al. 2006; Kang, et al.

493

2008; Kang, et al. 2010; Zhou and Stephens 2012). Although they provide a robust statistical

494

framework for removing many false positives, the current study shows that such an approach

495

may significantly limit our ability to understand the polygenic basis of local adaptation.

496
497

SNPs showing significant associations to climate after accounting for population structure, were

498

not in line with high F ST and LD SNPs that showed a significant enrichment along fitness QTL

499

peaks and coding/noncoding sites under functional constraint. Since these QTL are of large

500

effect (Ågren, et al. 2013), the lack of significant associations is less likely to be a result of many

501

alleles having a small effect on fitness. A more likely explanation is that accounting for

502

population structure using genetic relatedness estimated from genome-wide SNPs, can lead to a

503

significant number of false negatives. Arabidopsis thaliana however, is a simple, highly inbred

504

species —to correctly assess the impact of accounting for population structure when examining

505

the genetic basis of local adaptation there needs to be examination of other species with more

506

complex life-history traits and evolutionary dynamics.

507
508

A large portion of SNPs that showed significant associations to climate, and SNPs that showed

509

high F ST and LD between Italy and Sweden populations were enrichment among

nonsynonymous/cis-regulatory variation at sites showing significant functional constraint. These

511

results, further support an important role of cis-regulatory (Lasky, et al. 2014; Siepel and Arbiza

2014; Li and Fay 2017; Price, et al. 2018; Sackton, et al. 2019) and nonsynonymous variation

515

and showing significant evidence of local adaptation at functionally constraint sites, we

identified FLDH. FLDH is a negative regulator of abscisic-acid signaling (Bhandari, et al. 2010),

517

that showed strong GxE interactions between Italy and Sweden plants under cold acclimation

518

conditions. Abscisic-acid signaling is known to play an important role in abiotic stress response

519

(Tuteja 2007), with many studies supporting its role in local adaptation to climate (Keller, et al.

520

2012; Lasky, et al. 2014; Kalladan, et al. 2017; Ristova, et al. 2017).

521
522

In addition to abscisic-acid signaling, our results provide further support for the important role of

523

flowering time in local adaptation to climate. Among a list of genes that were experimentally

524

shown to affect flowering time, we identified three genes (PIF3, FIO1, and COL5) that showed

525

significant evidence of local adaptation and functional constraint along nonsynonymous sites.

526

FIO1 was previously shown to contain SNPs that showed significant associations to flowering

527

time among natural Swedish lines (Sasaki, et al. 2015) and COL5 was located within a QTL that

528

explains flowering time variation among Sweden and Italy recombinant inbred lines (Ågren, et

529

al. 2017). Finally, PIF3, a transcription factor that interacts with phytochromes (Soy, et al.

530

2012), has been implicated in multiple biological processes including early hypocotyl growth

531

(Monte, et al. 2004), photomorphogenesis (Dong, et al. 2017), flowering time (Oda, et al. 2004),

532

and regulation of physiological responses to temperature (Jiang, et al. 2017). This highly

533

conserved transcription factor was found within a large region that showed significant evidence

534

of local adaptation. This chromosomal region may involve a single causative variant, or a group

535

of linked genes that interact with PIF3 and were under selection because they contributed to

536

building an advantageous phenotype (Barton and Bengtsson 1986; Yeaman and Whitlock 2011).

537
538

When ignoring functional constraint, we identify a list of addition flowering time genes showing

539

significant evidence of local adaptation along nonsynonymous/cis-regulatory sites. Genes such

540

as SVP, MAF2, and MAF3 were previously associated with flowering time variation among

541

natural Arabidopsis accessions (Caicedo, et al. 2009; Sasaki, et al. 2015). Although adaptation

542

may involve sites that are not deeply rooted and/or under strong functional constraint, including

543

additional plant genomes when estimating sequence conservation across species may increase

544

our power to detect functionally important regions. As shown by studies examining adaptation in

545

species ranging from bacteria (Maddamsetti, et al. 2017) to birds (Sackton, et al. 2019),

546

addressing functional constraint can improve our understanding of its genetic basis.

547
548

Finally, the current study shows that we need a new statistical framework to examine genome

549

wide associations to environment, and furthermore, it increases our understanding on the genes

550

and traits that may underlie local adaptation in A. thaliana.
