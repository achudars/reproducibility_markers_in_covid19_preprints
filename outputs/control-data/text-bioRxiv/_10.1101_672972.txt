ABSTRACT

32

Photosynthesis in plant cells would not be possible without the supportive role of

33

mitochondria. However, isolation of mitochondria from plant cells, for physiological and

34

biochemical analyses, is a lengthy and tedious process. Established isolation protocols

35

require multiple centrifugation steps and substantial amounts of starting material. To

36

overcome these limitations, we tagged mitochondria in Arabidopsis thaliana with a triple

37

haemagglutinin-tag for rapid purification via a single affinity purification step. This protocol

38

yields a substantial quantity of highly pure mitochondria from 1 g of Arabidopsis seedlings.

39

The purified mitochondria were suitable for enzyme activity analyses and yielded sufficient

40

amounts of proteins for deep proteomic profiling. We applied this method for the proteomic

41

analysis of the Arabidopsis bou-2 mutant deficient in the mitochondrial glutamate transporter

42

À bout de souffle (BOU) and identified 27 differentially expressed mitochondrial proteins

43

compared with transgenic Col-0 controls. Our work also sets the stage for the development

44

of advanced mitochondria isolation protocols for distinct cell types.

INTRODUCTION

47

In all eukaryotic organisms, mitochondria are the major source of ATP, which is produced via

48

the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway, thus playing a vital role in cellular energy

49

metabolism. Mitochondria also participate in amino acid metabolism as well as in

50

photorespiration in photosynthetic eukaryotes. Photorespiration plays a crucial role in

51

photosynthesis by detoxifying 2-phosphoglycolate, which is produced by the oxygenation of

52

Rubisco and acts as an inhibitor of several plastidial enzymes (Ogren and Bowes, 1971;

53

Kelly and Latzko, 1976; Husic et al., 1987). Plants reclaim 2-phosphoglycolate in the

54

complex pathway of photorespiration, yielding 3-phosphoglycerate, which is returned to the

55

Calvin Benson cycle. The photorespiratory pathway includes several enzymatic steps that

56

occur in four subcellular compartments: plastids, peroxisomes, mitochondria, and cytosol

57

(Eisenhut et al., 2019). Knockout mutants of genes encoding enzymes and transporters

58

involved in photorespiration often show a photorespiratory phenotype, characterized by

59

chlorotic leaves and growth inhibition under ambient carbon dioxide (CO2) conditions, which

60

can be rescued in a CO2 enriched environment (Peterhansel et al., 2010). A key step in

61

photorespiration is the conversion of two glycine molecules into one serine residue in the

62

mitochondrial matrix, accompanied by the release of CO2 and ammonia. This step is

63

catalyzed by the glycine decarboxylase (GDC) multienzyme system, comprising a P-protein

64

(GLDP), H-protein (GDCH), L-protein (GDCL), and T-protein (GLDT), in combination with

65

serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHM) (Voll et al., 2006; Engel et al., 2007). In green

66

tissues, these proteins constitute up to 50% of the total protein content of the mitochondrial

67

matrix, indicating the importance of glycine oxidation in mitochondria (Oliver et al., 1990).

68

The Arabidopsis thaliana bou-2 mutant was previously identified as lacking the mitochondrial

69

glutamate transporter À bout de souffle (BOU), which is involved in photorespiration

70

(Eisenhut et al., 2013). Plants lacking the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) protein BOU

71

show a pronounced photorespiratory phenotype under ambient CO2 conditions, significantly

72

elevated CO2 compensation point, and highly reduced GDC activity in the isolated

73

mitochondria (Eisenhut et al., 2013). Because BOU is co-expressed with genes encoding

74

components of the GDC complex, and the bou-2 mutant shows a similar metabolic

75

phenotype as the shm1 mutant, it was hypothesized that BOU transports a metabolite

76

necessary for the proper functioning of GDC (Voll et al., 2006; Eisenhut et al., 2013).

77

Recently, it was demonstrated that heterologously expressed BOU functions as a glutamate

78

transporter (Porcelli et al., 2018). Glutamate is neither a substrate nor a product of the

79

reaction catalyzed by GDC. Besides its role in amino acid and N metabolism, glutamate is

80

necessary for the glutamylation of tetrahydrofolate (THF), a cofactor of GLDT and SHM (Suh

81

et al., 2001). Glutamylation of THF increases its stability. Moreover, THF-dependent

82

enzymes generally prefer polyglutamylated folates over monoglutamylated folates as a

83

substrate (Suh et al., 2001). However, because (1) BOU is not the only glutamate

84

transporter in mitochondria, and (2) glutamylation of folates is not restricted to mitochondria,

85

the exact physiological function of BOU remains unclear (Hanson and Gregory, 2011;

86

Monné et al., 2018). Notably, a glutamate/glutamine shuttle across the mitochondrial

87

membrane was previously suggested to support the reclamation of ammonia released during

88

photorespiration (Linka and Weber, 2005).

89

Analysis of the biochemical and physiological functions of mitochondria frequently requires

90

the isolation of intact mitochondria. Mitochondria can be isolated from leaf tissue in less than

91

1 h by differential centrifugation. This method yields mitochondria with good integrity and

92

appropriate enzyme activity. However, mitochondria are frequently contaminated with

93

plastids and peroxisomes. Hence, in many cases, a combination of differential centrifugation

94

and Percoll density gradient is used (Millar et al., 2001; Werhahn et al., 2001; Keech et al.,

95

2005). While this produces a pure fraction of respiratory active mitochondria with low plastid

96

and peroxisome contamination, such procedures generally take several hours and require

97

up to 50 g of starting material for producing sufficient yields (Keech et al., 2005). Moreover,

98

traditional protocols are not practical for the isolation of mitochondria from mutants with

99

severely impaired growth or from less abundant tissue types such as flowers and for the

100

analysis of mitochondrial metabolites. Furthermore, media used for the isolation of

101

mitochondria typically contain high concentrations of sugars and other metabolites that can

102

potentially interfere with MS-based metabolite analyses.

103

Recently, Chen and coworkers reported a method for the rapid isolation of mitochondria from

104

human HeLa cell cultures via co-immunopurification (co-IP) (Chen et al., 2016). The authors

105

generated transgenic HeLa cell lines expressing a triple hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged

106

enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) fused to the outer mitochondrial membrane

107

(OMM) localization sequence of OMP25 (3×HA-eGFP-OMP25). Because the epitope-tag

108

was displayed on the surface of mitochondria, these transfected cell lines could be used to

109

rapidly enrich mitochondria after cell homogenization. The HA-tagged mitochondria were

110

captured and pulled down using magnetic beads coated with an anti-HA-tag antibody. Given

111

the small size (1 µm diameter) and non-porous behavior of anti-HA-tag beads, these beads

112

performed better than the porous agarose matrix for the enrichment of mitochondria. Thus,

113

the authors established a method that ensures a high yield of pure mitochondria in

114

approximately 12 min. The isolated mitochondria showed high purity, integrity, and

115

functionality. Additionally, the authors developed a simple potassium-based buffer system

116

that maintains mitochondrial intactness and is compatible with downstream analyses, such

117

as metabolite analysis by LC/MS (Chen et al., 2016).

118

Building on this previous work, we developed an affinity-tagging strategy for the rapid

119

isolation of mitochondria from Arabidopsis. We generated transgenic Arabidopsis lines

120

carrying an HA-tagged translocase of the OMM 5 (TOM5) and isolated highly pure and intact

121

mitochondria from these lines in less than 25 min. The isolated mitochondria were

122

successfully subjected to proteomics and enzyme activity analyses. Moreover, we applied

123

the isolation strategy to the bou-2 mutant, revealing differential protein abundance and

124

enzyme activities.

RESULTS

127

Identification of TOM5 a suitable anchor peptide and generation of affinity-tagged

128

Arabidopsis lines

129

Recently, Chen and colleagues reported a rapid protocol for the isolation of intact

130

mitochondria from transgenic HeLa cells expressing the mitochondrial fusion protein 3×HA-

131

eGFP-OMP25 using co-IP. The Arabidopsis genome does not encode an ortholog of

132

OMP25. Therefore, we screened the available Arabidopsis mitochondrial proteome data,

133

including the OMM proteins with known topology and function, and identified TOM5 as a

134

potential candidate for our mitochondria affinity-tagging approach. Together with TOM6,

135

TOM7, TOM20, TOM22/9, and TOM40, TOM5 forms the protein import apparatus of plant

136

mitochondria (Werhahn et al., 2003). In yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), TOM5 is an

137

integral protein of the OMM. It has a negatively-charged N-terminal domain, which faces

138

toward the cytosol (Dietmeier et al., 1997) and can be fused to GFP without altering the

139

subcellular localization of TOM5 (Horie et al., 2003). The protein import machinery is well

140

conserved among eukaryotes. The predicted N-terminal cytosolic domain of Arabidopsis

141

TOM5 is necessary for the recognition of cytosolically synthesized mitochondrial preproteins

142

(Wiedemann et al., 2004). Therefore, we generated an N-terminal translational fusion of the

143

Arabidopsis TOM5 gene with triple HA-tagged synthetic GFP (sGFP) gene under the control

144

of

145

Supplemental Fig. S1). The construct was used to stably transform Arabidopsis ecotype

146

Columbia (Col-0) and bou-2 mutant. Expression and localization of the fusion protein was

147

verified in root and leaf tissues of 10-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings via confocal laser

148

scanning microscopy. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines expressing the 3×HA-sGFP-TOM5

149

protein in leaf and root mitochondria of Col-0 and bou-2 seedlings were identified based on

150

the co-localization of the fluorescent signal of GFP signal with that of the mitochondrial

151

marker CMXRos (Fig. 1A–D). CMXRos is a lipophilic cationic dye that accumulates in the

152

mitochondria because of the negative membrane potential; thus, it solely stains mitochondria

153

with an intact respiratory chain (Pendergrass et al., 2004). Because the fluorescent signals

154

of the 3×HA-sGFP-TOM5 protein (green) fully overlapped with those of the MitoTracker

155

(red), we conclude that overexpression of the UB10p-3×HA-sGFP-TOM5 construct in Col-0

156

and bou-2 does not affect mitochondrial intactness. In a few transgenic Col-0 lines, the

157

fluorescent signal of sGFP formed a ring around the mitochondria, suggesting the

158

localization of 3×HA-sGFP-TOM5 to the OMM (Fig. 1A, B). Notably, transgenic Col-0 or bou-

159

2 lines showed no apparent phenotypic differences compared with non-transgenic Col-0 or

160

bou-2 plants (control), respectively, under our culture conditions.

162

Transgenic Col-0 and bou-2 lines were used for the isolation of intact HA-tagged

163

mitochondria via co-IP using magnetic anti-HA beads. We chose HA as the epitope-tag for

164

purification because it has a high affinity for its cognate antibody, and Chen and coworkers

165

previously demonstrated that the size and non-porous behavior of the anti-HA beads yields a

166

high amount of mitochondria (Chen et al., 2016). Additionally, we used the LC/MS-

167

compatible buffer containing KCl and KH2PO4 (KPBS) developed by Chen et al. (2016). Our

168

purification procedure included five steps: homogenization of plant material in KPBS (1 min),

169

filtration of the homogenate (1 min), two centrifugation steps (5 min and 9 min), and co-IP (7

170

min, including washing steps). Altogether, mitochondria were purified from plant material in

171

less than 25 min (Fig. 2). If the first centrifugation step used to remove contaminating

172

chloroplasts and cell debris is omitted, the isolation time can be reduced to 18 min. The

173

purified mitochondria were verified by immunoblot analyses using known organelle-specific

174

protein markers. Mitochondria were enriched via co-IP only from lines harboring the

175

mitochondrial 3×HA-sGFP-TOM5 protein, as demonstrated by immunoblot analyses with

176

antibodies directed against different mitochondrial marker proteins including isocitrate

177

dehydrogenase (IDH; mitochondrial matrix), alternative oxidase 1/2 (AOX1/2; IMM), and

178

voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1; OMM). No enrichment of mitochondria was

179

observed in control Col-0 lines, indicating that the beads bind specifically to the HA-tag on

180

mitochondria in transgenic lines (Fig. 3). Comparison with classical mitochondria isolation

181

protocols using differential centrifugation and density gradient purification revealed that the

182

mitochondrial fraction enriched using our affinity-tagging method showed significantly less

183

contamination with proteins from plastids, peroxisomes, endoplasmatic reticulum (ER),

184

nuclei, and cytosol (Fig. 3). The following proteins were used as markers for different

185

organelles: Rubisco large subunit (RbcL; plastid), catalase (Cat; peroxisome), lumenal-

186

binding protein 2 (BiP2; ER), histone H3 (nucleus), and heat shock cognate protein 70

187

(HSC70; cytosol).

188

The intactness of mitochondria isolated from HA-tagged and control lines via co-IP was

189

assessed based on the latency of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) activity. Additionally,

190

isolation was performed in the presence of 1% (w/v) Triton X-114. MDH activity could be

191

detected in mitochondria isolated from HA-tagged lines but not in those isolated from the

192

control lines, thus verifying the results of our immunoblot analyses. When 1% (w/v) Triton X-

193

114 was added to the washing buffer during co-IP, MDH activity was undetectable in both

194

transgenic and control lines, as the detergent lyses the organelles (Fig. 4).

195

Typically, we used 5–10 g of Arabidopsis seedlings grown on agar plates for the isolation of

196

mitochondria, and this yielded up to 700 µg of total mitochondrial protein. However,

197

mitochondria could also be isolated from 1 g of starting material, yielding up to 200 µg of

198

total mitochondrial protein. This is advantageous for very young seedlings or mutants with

199

severely impaired growth. Isolation from less than 1 g of starting material may also result in

200

an appropriate yield of mitochondria, but this was not tested in the current study.

Taken together, our data indicate that mitochondria can be rapidly isolated via co-IP using a

202

simple LC/MS-compatible buffer.

207

To assess the effect of the bou-2 mutant allele on mitochondrial metabolism, we rapidly

208

isolated mitochondria from 10-day-old transgenic Col-0 and bou-2 seedlings grown under

209

elevated CO2 conditions (3,000 ppm) and those shifted to ambient CO2 conditions (380 ppm

210

CO2 after 5 days). Mitochondria were lysed and used to measure the activity of MDH,

211

aspartate

212

aminotransferase (AlaAT), γ-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T), and formate

213

dehydrogenase (FDH). Enzyme activities were calculated from the initial slopes. Enzyme

214

activities in transgenic bou-2 mutant lines were compared with those in transgenic Col-0

215

lines, which were set to 100%.

219

from seedlings grown under elevated CO2 conditions, but were significantly reduced in

220

transgenic mutant lines after the shift to ambient CO2 conditions (Fig. 5C, D). The activity of

221

AlaAT was significantly reduced (Fig. 5E), whereas that of GluDH was significantly increased

222

in transgenic mutant lines under elevated CO2 conditions; however, both enzyme activities

223

reverted back to the levels in transgenic Col-0 when seedlings were shifted to ambient CO2

224

conditions (Fig. 5F). Together, our results suggest a possible involvement of BOU in

225

mitochondrial amino acid and N metabolism.

226

In addition, we found that the activity of MDH was strongly reduced in 4-week-old transgenic

227

bou-2 mutant plants grown under elevated CO2 conditions (Supplemental Fig. S2). However,

228

no change was observed in MDH activity in 10-day-old transgenic bou-2 plants, suggesting

229

pleiotropic effects in older leaf tissues due to accumulating photorespiratory intermediates.

230

Proteomic analysis of mitochondria affinity-purified from transgenic Col-0 and bou-2

231

mutant lines

232

Mitochondria were isolated from 10-day-old transgenic Col-0 and bou-2 seedlings grown

233

under elevated CO2 conditions in four independent biological replicates. Proteome analysis

234

of the isolated mitochondria revealed 15,688 peptides belonging to 1,240 proteins present in

235

at least three of the four replicates (Supplemental Table S1, Supplemental Table S2).

236

Subcellular localization of the quantified proteins was annotated using the SUBAcon

237

database (Hooper et al., 2017). Summing up the label-free quantitation (LFQ) intensities of

238

the spectra showed that 80% of all quantified peptides resulted from proteins localized or

239

predicted to be localized to the mitochondria, 11.5% from plastid-localized proteins, and

240

5.7% from proteins with no clear subcellular localization (designated as ambiguous).

241

Additionally, more than 90% of the quantified peptides were assigned to the mitochondria.

242

Contamination of the mitochondrial proteins by proteins from peroxisomes, ER, Golgi,

243

vacuoles, endomembranes, plasma membranes, nuclei, and cytosol was less than 1% each

244

(Supplemental Table S1, Supplemental Table S2). These results indicate high purity of the

245

rapidly isolated mitochondria, which was comparable with the purity of classically isolated

246

mitochondria (Klodmann et al., 2011; Senkler et al., 2017).

247

Next, we compared our proteome data with previous proteomic analyses and quantified

248

proteins and some of the subunits of known mitochondrial complexes (Supplemental Table

249

S1, Supplemental Table S2). The OXPHOS pathway of mitochondria consists of five protein

250

complexes (I–V) located in the IMM. Complexes I to IV represent oxidoreductases, which

251

comprise the respiratory chain that regenerates oxidized forms of cofactors involved in

252

mitochondrial metabolism, thereby creating an electron flow. This leads to the simultaneous

253

export of protons into the intermembrane space (IMS). The built-up proton gradient is used

254

by Complex V to generate ATP. Complex I is the largest complex involved in the OXPHOS

255

pathway and comprises at least 47 protein subunits that form the so-called membrane and

256

peripheral arms (Peters et al., 2013; Meyer et al., 2019). Except NDUA1, NDUB2, Nad4L,

257

and Nad6 (At3g08610, At1g76200, AtMg00650, and AtMg00270, respectively), we could

258

identify all Complex I subunits in our proteomic data set. Additionally, we identified eight

259

previously proposed assembly factors (Meyer et al., 2019), five γ-carbonic anhydrases, and

260

five additional proteins proposed to form a matrix-exposed domain attached to Complex I

261

(Sunderhaus et al., 2006). Complex II is composed of eight subunits (Millar et al., 2004). In

addition to its function in the OXPHOS pathway, Complex II also participates in the

263

tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). Six out of eight subunits of Complex II and the assembly

264

factor SDHAF2 were identified in our data set. Additionally, peptides of all proteins and

265

isoforms of Complex III, eight of its assembly factors, and proteins previously defined as

266

alternative pathways (Meyer et al., 2019) were identified in our data set. Complex V consists

267

of 15 subunits, of which 13 were identified in our proteomic data set; Atp6 (AtMg00410 and

268

AtMg011701) and Atp9 (AtMg01080) were the only two subunits that could not be identified.

269

In addition, we found three of the five proposed assembly factors (Meyer et al., 2019). The

270

cytochrome c oxidase complex (Complex IV) consists of 16 proposed subunits in

271

Arabidopsis (Mansilla et al., 2018). Of these, 9 subunits and 11 assembly factors of Complex

272

IV were identified in our proteomic data set. Furthermore, we identified three proteins

273

involved in the assembly of OXPHOS supercomplexes (Meyer et al., 2019).

274

Except the abovementioned subunits of the SDH complex, all proteins of the TCA cycle and

275

GDC multienzyme system were identified in the rapidly isolated mitochondria. Additionally,

276

our proteomic data set contained a number of pentatricopeptide and tetratricopeptide repeat

277

proteins involved in RNA metabolism as well as heat shock proteins and ribosomes involved

278

in protein control and turnover (Supplemental Table S1, Supplemental Table S2).

279

In Arabidopsis, the majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear genes,

280

translated in the cytosol, and then imported into the mitochondria. The import and sorting of

281

nuclear-encoded mitochondrial preproteins requires functional TOM and sorting and

282

assembly machinery (SAM) in the OMM, mitochondrial IMS import and assembly (MIA)

283

machinery in the IMS, and translocase of the IMM (TIM) in the IMM (Murcha et al., 2014). All

284

mitochondrial preproteins enter the mitochondria via the TOM complex in the OMM. In the

285

IMS, membrane proteins are sorted via the small TIM proteins toward the SAM or TIM22

286

complex for incorporation into the OMM or IMM. Soluble proteins of the mitochondrial matrix

287

are imported via the TIM17:23 complex, and proteins that remain in the IMS are processed

288

via the MIA machinery (Murcha et al., 2014). In this study, we identified all of these proteins

289

in our proteome data set, except the OMM protein TOM6, IMS protein ERV1, IMM protein

290

PRAT5, and matrix proteins MGE1 and ZIM17. Additionally, we identified plant-specific

291

import components, including OM64, PRAT3, and PRAT4, in the OMM (Murcha et al., 2015)

292

and proteins of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS), which

293

connects the IMM to OMM (van der Laan et al., 2016). Other notable OMM proteins

294

identified in our proteomic data set included GTPases MIRO1 and MIRO2, lipid biosynthesis

295

protein PECT, and β-barrel proteins VDAC1–4 (Supplemental Table S1, Supplemental Table

296

S2). Recently, it was shown that the cytosolic protein GAPC interacts with VDAC (Schneider

297

et al., 2018); we also identified GAPC in our proteomic data set.

298

Overall, we conclude that mitochondria isolated using our rapid isolation method are suitable

299

for proteomic analyses.

300

Differential analysis of the mitochondrial proteome of transgenic Col-0 and bou-2

301

lines

302

To assess the effect of bou-2 mutation on the mitochondrial proteome, we performed

303

comparative proteomic analysis of transgenic Col-0 and bou-2 lines. A total of 47 proteins

304

showed significantly increased abundance in the mutant, of which five were localized to the

305

mitochondria. Additionally, 44 proteins showed significantly decreased abundance in the

306

transgenic bou-2 samples, of which 22 were predicted to be localized to the mitochondria

307

(Table 1); among these proteins, BOU was the least abundant. The bou-2 line is a GABI-Kat

308

line that carries a T-DNA insertion in the second exon of the BOU gene (Kleinboelting et al.,

309

2012; Eisenhut et al., 2013). We identified two peptides of BOU in at least three of the four

310

replicates of transgenic bou-2 samples. Both peptides were translated from the first exon of

311

the gene. Because the T-DNA was inserted in the second exon of the gene, it is possible

312

that the first exon was translated. However, a functional protein is not synthesized in the

313

knockout mutant (Eisenhut et al., 2013). Among the mitochondrial proteins showing

314

significantly reduced abundance in transgenic bou-2 seedlings, we identified six proteins of

315

the OXPHOS pathway (three Complex I proteins and one protein each of Complex II, III, and

316

V), two proteins involved in protein translocation, two proteins involved in metabolite

317

transport, two proteins involved in lipid metabolism, three proteins involved in protein

318

turnover/synthesis, one protein involved in the TCA cycle, and six proteins (including FDH)

319

involved in other processes. Among the proteins with significantly increased abundance in

320

transgenic bou-2 mutant, we identified two proteins involved in RNA/DNA metabolism, one

321

protein involved in THF metabolism, one MIRO-related GTPase, and one LETM1-like protein

322

(Table 1).

323

Previously, Eisenhut and colleagues showed that GDC activity is reduced in mitochondria

324

isolated from 4-week-old bou-2 mutant plants (Eisenhut et al., 2013). The authors showed

325

that the bou-2 mutant accumulated higher amounts of glycine than the wild type and

326

exhibited differential amount and status of the P-protein. Immunoblot analysis showed no

327

differences in the levels of other GDC proteins in the bou-2 mutant compared with the wild

328

type (Eisenhut et al., 2013). In our proteomic data set, none of the proteins of the GDC

329

complex or SHMT showed significant differences between transgenic Col-0 and bou-2

330

seedlings (Table 2). However, the amounts of GLDP1, GLDP2, GDCH1, GDCL1, GDCL2,

331

and GLDT were slightly reduced, whereas those of SHM1, SHM2, and GDCH3 were

332

increased in the mutant compared with Col-0. Among these proteins, the strongest reduction

333

was detected in the amount of GDCH1. However, differences in protein levels between

334

transgenic Col-0 and bou-2 seedlings were not statistically significant. Only one peptide

335

related to GDCH2 was detected in our data set; however, because it was detected in only

336

one of the four replicates, it is not listed Supplemental Table S1.

337

In this study, we showed that mitochondria of the bou-2 mutant displayed reduced AlaAT

338

activity, increased GluDH activity, and no change in MDH, AspAT, GABA-T, and FDH

339

activities under elevated CO2 conditions compared with that under ambient CO2 conditions

340

(Fig. 4A–F). Except FDH, none of the assayed enzymes showed significantly altered

341

amounts in our proteomic data set (Table 2). The amount of FDH was significantly reduced

342

in transgenic bou-2 samples; however, its activity was not altered in the mutant under both

343

elevated and ambient CO2 conditions, indicating post-translational modification of FDH. The

344

level of AlaAT was slightly increased in the mutant but showed only 60% activity compared

345

with Col-0 under both elevated and ambient CO2 conditions. The activities of MDH, AspAT,

346

and GABA-T did not differ between transgenic Col-0 and bou-2 mutant under elevated CO2

347

conditions, although these proteins were more abundant in transgenic mutant samples. The

348

activity of GluDH was significantly increased in the mutant compared with Col-0 under

349

elevated CO2 conditions, which may be associated with the increased amount of protein

350

detected in the transgenic bou-2 seedlings in our proteomic data set. However, this increase

351

was not statistically significant.

352

Overall, we conclude that differences in the activities of MDH, AspAT, GluDH, AlaAT, GABA-

353

T, and AlaAT measured in this study and that of GDC measured in a previous study most

354

likely do not relate to changes in protein abundance in mitochondria of Col-0 vs. bou-2

355

mutant but instead might be caused by metabolic impairment or post-translational

356

modifications.

DISCUSSION

359

Recently, analyses of mitochondrial proteome content, complexome composition, post-

360

translational modifications, energy metabolism, OXPHOS complex formation and function,

361

protein translocation, and metabolite shuttles have been conducted to further our

362

understanding of mitochondrial metabolism in Arabidopsis (König et al., 2014; Fromm et al.,

363

2016; De Col et al., 2017; Rao et al., 2017; Senkler et al., 2017; Porcelli et al., 2018; Hu et

364

al., 2019; Kolli et al., 2019; Meyer et al., 2019; Nickel et al., 2019). Many of these analyses

365

required the isolation of intact mitochondria. Here, we report a procedure for the rapid

366

isolation of HA-tagged mitochondria from transgenic Arabidopsis lines via co-IP.

367

Mitochondria isolated using this method showed high enrichment of mitochondrial marker

368

proteins, with only minor contamination, as demonstrated by immunoblot and quantitative

369

proteomic analyses (Fig. 3, Supplemental Table S1, Supplemental Table S2).

370

The method reported here enables the isolation of intact mitochondria from Arabidopsis

371

seedlings in less than 25 min (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Moreover, by omitting the first centrifugation

372

step, the isolation time could be shortened to 18 min, although the resulting mitochondrial

373

fraction contained a higher level of other contaminating cellular components. The

374

mitochondrial fraction used for proteomic analyses in this study was obtained using the

375

slightly longer protocol that results in lower contamination with non-mitochondrial proteins.

376

Nevertheless, this isolation method is significantly faster than the standard isolation

377

procedures that generally take up to several hours. To date, we have been able to

378

successfully isolate mitochondria from whole seedlings, leaves, and roots (data not shown).

379

Moreover, this method could be used for the rapid isolation of mitochondria from other plant

380

tissues such as flowers and developing seeds because (1) the expression of the affinity tag

381

is driven by the ubiquitous UB10p promoter (Supplemental Fig. S1) and (2) only a small

382

amount of starting material (as low as 1 g) is needed. Additionally, this method is

383

advantageous for the isolation of mitochondria from very young tissues or mutants with

384

growth defects or reduced biomass accumulation. The rapid isolation method is superior to

385

the standard isolation protocols with respect to the yield of mitochondria; we were able to

386

isolate 200 µg of total mitochondrial protein from 1 g of starting material and up to 700 µg

387

total mitochondrial protein from 10 g of whole Arabidopsis seedlings. By contrast, the

388

standard isolation protocols yield only 1.2 mg mitochondria from 50 g of leaves (Keech et al.,

389

2005). Generally, a higher yield is expected using our isolation method, as the HA-tag has

390

high affinity for its cognate antibody. Further optimization of the protocol and bead to extract

391

ratio may result in even higher yields.

392

The purity of affinity-purified mitochondria was similar to that of mitochondria isolated using

393

standard protocols including density gradients (Senkler et al., 2017). Immunoblot analysis

394

revealed only minor contamination with proteins of the ER or peroxisomes in affinity-purified

395

mitochondria (Fig. 3). These results were corroborated by quantitative proteomic analysis.

396

Less than 3% of all quantified proteins were assigned to peroxisomes, ER, Golgi, vacuoles,

397

endomembranes, plasma membranes, nuclei, and cytosol. The highest contamination was

398

due to plastid-localized proteins (Supplemental Table S1, Supplemental Table S2).

399

However, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the contaminants bound non-

400

specifically to the beads, despite extensive washing. Approximately 80% of the identified

401

proteins and 90% of the identified peptides showed mitochondrial localization (Supplemental

402

Table S1, Supplemental Table S2). Thus, we conclude that the purity of mitochondria

403

isolated using the rapid affinity purification method is comparable with that of mitochondria

404

isolated using traditional methods. We cannot comment on the physiological activity and

405

coupling state of affinity-purified mitochondria because we could not efficiently elute the

406

mitochondria from the magnetic beads with HA peptide. However, mitochondria could be

407

efficiently eluted using SDS-PAGE or detergent lysis buffer. Elution of intact mitochondria

408

might be achievable by integrating a protease cleavage site between the HA-tag and GFP;

409

this will be explored in future studies.

410

In our data set, we were able to identify 96% and 99% of the proteins detected by Klodmann

411

et al. (2011) and Senkler et al. (2017), respectively, in previous analyses of mitochondrial

412

proteomes and their complexome composition (Supplemental Table S1, Supplemental Table

413

S2). On the basis of a recent review on the composition and function of OXPHOS in

414

mitochondria (Meyer et al., 2019), we were able to identify 86% of all the predicted subunits

415

and assembly factors. To date, all of the proteins reviewed in Meyer et al. (2019) have not

416

been confirmed, and it might require an in-depth analysis or membrane enrichment to

417

confirm their presence in mitochondria in proteomic studies. Previously, it was reported that

418

the subunit ND4L is difficult to detect in proteomic studies because of its hydrophobic nature

419

(Peters et al., 2013). Consistent with this observation, we also could not identify this protein

420

in our proteome or in the list of quantified peptides (Supplemental Table S1, Supplemental

421

Table S2). However, we were able to detect all proteins of the TCA cycle (except two

422

subunits of Complex II), all GDC proteins, majority of the proteins and subunits of the

423

TIM/TOM protein import apparatus, metabolite transporters of amino acids, dicarboxylic

424

acids, cofactors, ions and energy equivalents (e.g., BOU, BAC, UCP, DCT, SAMC, NDT,

425

APC, AAC, and PHT), as well as many proteins involved in protein synthesis/turnover and

426

DNA/RNA metabolism (Supplemental Table S1, Supplemental Table S2). Thus, our rapidly

427

isolated mitochondria showed good purity, integrity, and functionality.

428

Among all of the identified proteins, 20% could not be assigned to mitochondria. These

429

proteins included components of PSI and PSII; these could be clearly categorized as

430

contamination. However, we also identified proteins with unknown function and no clear

431

prediction of localization. In addition, we detected proteins such as GAPC, which was

432

previously shown to interact with the OMM protein VDAC (Schneider et al., 2018). Therefore,

433

we predict that some of the proteins classified as contaminants might represent novel

434

mitochondrial proteins, for example, as part of OMM protein complexes in the cytosol or as

435

components of complexes at organellar contact sites. However, this needs to be evaluated

436

in more detail in the future.

437

Application of the novel method to a mutant lacking the mitochondrial glutamate transporter

438

BOU resulted in the detection of surprisingly few changes in protein abundances compared

439

with Col-0. Only 22 mitochondrial proteins showed a significant reduction in abundance in

440

the bou-2 mutant, whereas five proteins were significantly increased in abundance.

441

However, only changes in a mitochondrial folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FGPS) and in

442

FDH, which contributes to the production of CO2 by oxidizing formate, might be connected to

443

photorespiration. Formate is released from 10-formyl-THF by 10-formyl deformylase, an

444

enzyme involved in the maintenance of the THF pool in mitochondrial matrix (Collakova et

445

al., 2008). Reduced GDC activity in bou-2 might result in a lower production of formate and

446

finally a reduced abundance of FDH. FGPS is involved in vitamin B9 metabolism by

447

catalyzing the glutamylation of THF, a cofactor of GLDT and SHM (Hanson and Gregory,

448

2011). No significant changes were detected in the abundance of any of the proteins of the

449

GDC multienzyme system. SHM1, SHM2, and GDCH3 were slightly more abundant in the

450

mutant than Col-0, whereas the others seem to be slightly reduced; however, this trend did

451

not meet the significance threshold (Table 2). The observed changes were not pronounced

452

and did not explain why the GDC activity was reduced to approximately 15% of the Col-0

453

level in the bou-2 mutant. A possible explanation could be that Eisenhut and coworkers used

454

4-week-old rosettes (Eisenhut et al., 2013), whereas we used 10-day-old seedlings in the

455

current study. This possibility is supported by the observation that no difference in MDH

456

activity could be detected between 10-day-old mutant and Col-0 seedlings (Fig. 5A).

457

However, in 4-week-old leaves, the MDH activity was significantly reduced in the mutant

458

compared with Col-0 (Supplemental Fig. S2). In contrast to GDC, the abundance of FDH

459

was significantly reduced in the mutant, whereas its activity was unaltered compared with

460

Col-0 (Table 1, Fig. 5B). Previously, FDH was identified in a lysine acetylome study of

461

Arabidopsis mitochondria from 10-day-old Col-0 seedlings (König et al., 2014). This might

462

indicate that FDH activity is more likely regulated by post-translational modifications than by

463

protein abundance.

464

The BOU protein was recently assigned the function of a glutamate transporter (Porcelli et

465

al., 2018). Glutamate is indirectly linked to photorespiration, as it is needed for the

466

polyglutamylation of THF, which increases its stability and promotes the activity of THF-

467

dependent enzymes (Hanson and Gregory, 2011). However, in addition to BOU,

468

mitochondria-localized uncoupling proteins 1 and 2 show glutamate uptake activity in

469

Arabidopsis (Monné et al., 2018). This raises the question why knockout of the BOU gene

470

leads to a photorespiratory phenotype in young tissues, if BOU is not the only glutamate

471

transporter of mitochondria. Additionally, polyglutamylation is not restricted to mitochondria,

472

as Arabidopsis contains three isoforms of FGPS localized to the mitochondria, plastids, and

473

cytosol (Hanson and Gregory, 2011). Folate transporters prefer monoglutamylated forms of

474

THF, whereas enzymes generally prefer polyglutamylated forms (Suh et al., 2001). These

475

data indicate that BOU performs other functions, in addition to glutamate transport in vivo.

476

We exclude its function as a mitochondrial glutamate/glutamine shuttle, as BOU shows no

477

glutamine uptake activity (Porcelli et al., 2018). However, it is possible that BOU is involved

478

in folate metabolism, as folate biosynthesis occurs only in mitochondria (Hanson and

479

Gregory, 2011). This possibility, however, needs to be investigated in future studies.

480

CONCLUSIONS

481

Our experiments show that affinity-tagging is a powerful tool not only for the analysis of

482

protein-protein interactions but also for the isolation of functional organelles from

483

Arabidopsis. The mitochondria isolated using this method showed high purity and integrity.

484

Future studies will be required to assess the physiological state of the isolated mitochondria

485

after elution from magnetic beads and to determine the applicability of this method for

486

metabolite analyses. To conduct metabolite analyses, it is encouraging that the LC/MS-

487

compatible buffer system developed previously for mammalian mitochondria (Chen et al.,

488

2016) can also be used for the isolation of mitochondria from plant tissues. Expressing the

489

affinity tag under the control of cell-specific promoters will allow the isolation of mitochondria

490

from specific cell types, such as meristems or guard cells (Yang et al., 2008; Schürholz et

491

al., 2018). The use of cell-specific promoters in our construct will help unravel the complex

492

role of mitochondria in various cell types. We expect that similar tagging strategies will be

493

applicable to other plant cell organelles, such as plastids and peroxisomes. Moreover,

494

simultaneous expression of several different affinity tags will facilitate the affinity purification

495

of different organelles from a single extract.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

497

Pant growth conditions

498

Arabidopsis

499

http://www.gabi-kat.de/db/lineid.php) (Kleinboelting et al., 2012) were used in this study.

500

Seeds were sterilized by washing with 70% (v/v) ethanol supplemented with 1% (v/v) Triton

501

X-100 twice for 10 min each, followed by washing with 100% ethanol twice for 10 min each.

502

Seeds were grown on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (1/2 MS) medium (pH 5.8)

503

supplemented with 0.8% (w/v) agar. Seeds were subjected to cold stratification for 2 days at

504

4°C. After germination, seedlings were grown under 12 h light/12 h dark photoperiod under

505

100 µmol m-2 s-1 light intensity and 3,000 ppm CO2-enriched atmosphere, unless otherwise

506

stated.

507

Construction of transgenic lines

508

The HA epitope-tag was amplified with a start codon from the Gateway binary vector

509

pGWB15. The coding sequence (CDS) of sGFP, minus the start and stop codons but

510

including a linker peptide (GGSG) at the 5' and 3' ends, was amplified from the Gateway

511

binary vector pGWB4. The CDS of TOM5 (minus the start codon) was amplified from

512

Arabidopsis cDNA. Starting from the 5'-end to the 3'-end, the amplified 3×HA-tag, sGFP, and

513

TOM5 were cloned into the pUTKan vector under the control of the Arabidopsis UB10p using

514

restriction endonucleases. The construct was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens,

515

strain GV3101::pMP90, which was then introduced into Col-0 and bou-2 plants via

516

Agrobacterium-mediated transformation using the floral dip method, as described previously

517

(Clough and Bent, 1998).

518

Confocal laser scanning microscopy

519

The expression of 3×HA-sGFP-TOM5 was verified via confocal laser scanning microscopy

520

using the Zeiss LSM 78 Confocal Microscope and Zeiss ZEN software. The Col-0 and bou-2

521

seedlings regenerated from independent transformation events were incubated with 200 nM

522

MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) in 1/2 MS supplemented with 3% (w/v)

523

sucrose for 15 min. Images were captured using the following excitation/emission

524

wavelengths: sGFP (488 nm/490–550 nm) and MitoTracker Red CMXRos (561 nm/580–625

525

nm). Pictures were processed using the ImageJ software (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).

526

Rapid isolation of mitochondria using co-IP

527

Epitope-tagged mitochondria were rapidly isolated using co-IP, as described previously

528

(Chen et al., 2016). Briefly, 1–10 g of Arabidopsis seedlings were harvested and

530

The resulting homogenate was filtered through three layers of miracloth supported by a

531

nylon mesh and centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 5 min. The pellet containing cell debris and

chloroplasts was discarded. The supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 20,000 × g for

533

9 min. The pellet representing the crude mitochondrial fraction was resuspended in KPBS

534

using a fine paintbrush and homogenized using a Potter-Elvehjem. Crude mitochondria were

535

incubated with pre-washed magnetic anti-HA beads (ThermoFisher Scientific) on an end-

536

over-end rotator for 5 min. Magnetic beads were separated using a magnetic stand and

537

washed at least three times with KPBS. In the detergent treatment control, KPBS was

538

supplemented with 1% (v/v) Triton X-114 in all washing steps. The purified mitochondria

539

were lysed using mitochondria lysis buffer (50 mM TES/KOH [pH 7.5], 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM

540

MgCl2, 10% [v/v] glycerol, and 0.1% [v/v] Triton X-100) for enzyme activity assays and

541

immunoblot analysis or directly frozen in liquid nitrogen for proteome and metabolite

542

analyses. All steps were carried out at 4°C. The amount of protein recovered after lysis was

543

determined using the Quick StartTM Bradford Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad), with bovine serum

544

albumin (BSA) as the standard.

545

Isolation of mitochondria using the traditional approach

546

Mitochondria were isolated from 10-day-old Col-0 seedlings via differential centrifugation and

547

Percoll gradient purification, as described previously (Kühn et al., 2015).

548

Immunoblot analysis

549

25 µg of total leaf extract and 6.45 µg of isolated mitochondria fractions were heated at 96°C

550

in SDS-PAGE loading buffer for 10 min and separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels

551

(Laemmli, 1970). Proteins were transferred to 0.2 µm polyvinylidene difluoride membranes

552

(PVDF) or 0.45 µm nitrocellulose membranes using standard protocols. Protein transfer was

553

verified by staining the membranes with Ponceau S red. Membranes were blocked

554

according to the manufacturer’s instructions for 1 h, washed with Tris-buffered saline

555

containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 (TBST) and subsequently incubated with either a primary

556

antibody or a single-step antibody overnight at 4°C. Antibodies against marker proteins were

557

diluted as follows: anti-AOX (1:1,000), anti-IDH (1:5,000), anti-VDAC1 (1:5,000), anti-HA-

558

HRP (1:5,000), anti-RbcL (1:7,500), anti-Cat (1:1,000), anti-BiP2 (1:2,000), anti-Histone H3

559

(1:5,000), and anti-HSC70 (1:3,000). Membranes were washed with TBST twice for 10 min

560

each and incubated with the secondary goat anti-Rabbit-HRP antibody (1:5,000) at room

561

temperature for 1 h or at 4°C overnight. Subsequently, membranes were washed with TBST

562

five times for 5 min each and visualized using a chemiluminescence detection system

(Immobilon Western HRP Substrate, Merck Millipore). All steps were carried out with

564

phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), when using anti-Cat antibody.

565

Enzyme assays

566

Activities of mitochondrial enzymes were measured using a spectrophotometer, based on

567

the absorbance at 340 nm. The activity of MDH was measured based on the oxidation of

568

NADH to NAD+ at 340 nm, as described previously (Tomaz et al., 2010). The reaction

569

mixture contained 50 mM KH2PO4 (pH 7.5), 0.2 mM NADH, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 2

570

mM OAA (Tomaz et al., 2010), and 0.1–0.4 µg total mitochondrial protein. AspAT activity

571

was measured in a reaction coupled with MDH, as described previously (Wilkie and Warren,

572

1998), with 0.3–1 µg total mitochondrial protein per assay. No external pyridoxal-5’-

573

phosphate was added to the reaction mixture. GluDH activity was measured as described

574

previously (Turano et al., 1996), based on the reduction of NAD+ to NADH at 340 nm. To

575

determine the amination activity, 0.5–2 µg total mitochondrial protein was used per assay.

576

GABA-T activity was measured in a reaction coupled with succinate-semialdehyde

577

dehydrogenase (SSADH), as described previously (Clark et al., 2009). The assay buffer

578

contained 50 mM TAPS (pH 9), 0.2 mM NAD+, 0.625 mM EDTA, 8 mM GABA, 2 mM

579

pyruvate, 1 U/ml SSADH, and 2–5 µg total mitochondrial protein. The NAD+-dependent

580

SSADH was purified from Escherichia coli, as described previously (Clark et al., 2009). The

581

recombinant purified protein catalyzed the production of NADH with a specific activity of 1.6

582

U/mg protein. AlaAT activity was measured in reaction coupled with lactate dehydrogenase,

583

as described previously (Miyashita et al., 2007), with 1–5 µg total mitochondrial protein. FDH

584

activity was measured based on the reduction of NAD+ to NADH at 340 nm and 30°C, with

585

1–5 µg total mitochondrial protein. The assay buffer contained 100 mM KH2PO4 (pH 7.5),

586

1mM NAD+, and 50 mM sodium formate.

587

Sample preparation for LC/MS analysis

588

To elute proteins from magnetic beads, 30 µl of Laemmli buffer was added to the reaction

589

mixture, and samples were incubated at 95°C for 10 min. Subsequently, 20 µl of protein

590

sample was loaded on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel for in-gel digestion. The isolated gel

591

pieces were reduced using 50 µl of 10 mM DTT, then alkylated using 50 µl of 50 mM

592

iodoacetamide, and finally digested using 6 µl of trypsin (200 ng) in 100 mM ammonium

593

bicarbonate. The peptides were resolved in 15 µl of 0.1% trifluoracetic acid and subjected to

594

LC/MS analysis.

595

LC/MS analysis

596

The LC/MS analysis was performed on a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo

597

Scientific, Bremen, Germany) connected to an Ultimate 3000 Rapid Separation LC system

598

(Dionex; Thermo Scientific, Idstein, Germany) and equipped with an Acclaim PepMap 100

599

C18 column (75 µm inner diameter × 25 cm length × 2 mm particle size; Thermo Scientific,

600

Bremen, Germany). The length of the isocratic LC gradient was 120 min. The mass

601

spectrometer was operated in positive mode and coupled with a nano electrospray ionization

602

source. Capillary temperature was set at 250°C, and source voltage was set at 1.4 kV. The

603

survey scans were conducted at a mass to charge (m/z) ranging from 200 to 2000 and a

604

resolution of 70,000. The automatic gain control was set at 3,000,000, and the maximum fill

605

time was set at 50 ms. The ten most intensive peptide ions were isolated and fragmented by

606

high-energy collision dissociation (HCD).

607

Computational MS data analysis

608

Peptide and protein identification and quantification was performed using MaxQuant version

609

1.5.5.1 (MPI for Biochemistry, Planegg, Germany) with default parameters. The identified

610

Arabidopsis peptides and proteins were queried against a specific proteome database

611

(UP0000006548, downloaded 12/11/17) from UniProt. The oxidation and acetylation of

612

methionine residues at the N-termini of proteins were set as variable modifications, while

613

carbamidomethylations at cysteine residues were considered as fixed modification. Peptides

614

and proteins were accepted with a false discovery rate of 1%. Unique and razor peptides

615

were used for label-free quantification, and peptides with variable modifications were

616

included in the quantification. The minimal ratio count was set to two, and the ‘matched

617

between runs’ option was enabled.

618

Normalized intensities, as provided by MaxQuant, were analyzed using the Perseus

619

framework (version 1.5.0.15; MPI for Biochemistry, Planegg, Germany). Only proteins

620

containing at least two unique peptides and a minimum of three valid values in at least one

621

group were quantified. Proteins which were identified only by site or marked as a

622

contaminant (from the MaxQuant contaminant list) were excluded from the analysis.

623

Differential enrichment of proteins in the two groups (Col-0; bou-2) was assessed using

624

Student’s t-test. Significance analysis was applied on log2-transformed values using an S0

625

constant of 0 and a false discovery rate of 5%, as threshold cutoffs.

626

The MS proteomics data has been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the

627

PRIDE partner repository with the data set identifier PXD014137.
