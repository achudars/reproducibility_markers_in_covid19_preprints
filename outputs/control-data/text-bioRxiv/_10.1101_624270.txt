Abstract:

17

Biomarkers are important tools for diagnosis, prognosis, and identification of the causal

18

factors of physiological conditions. Biomarkers are typically identified by correlating biological

19

measurements with the status of a condition in a sample of subjects. Cross-sectional studies

20

sample subjects at a single timepoint, while longitudinal studies follow a cohort through time.

21

Identifying biomarkers of aging is subject to unique challenges. Individuals who age faster have

22

intrinsically higher mortality rates and so are preferentially lost over time, in a phenomenon

23

known as cohort selection. In this paper, we use simulations to show that cohort selection biases

24

cross-sectional analysis away from identifying causal loci of aging, to the point where cross-

25

sectional studies are less likely to identify loci that cause aging than if loci had been chosen at

26

random. We go on to show this bias can be corrected by incorporating correlates of mortality

27

identified from longitudinal studies, allowing cross sectional studies to effectively identify the

28

causal factors of aging.

Body:
Despite the universality of aging (1, 2), we do not know which factors are the most important

33

contributors to age-associated decline in physiological function and to increase in mortality rate.

34

Further, we lack consensus regarding what it means to be aged and how to properly measure

35

aging (3, 4). The advent of high throughput “omics” technologies has led to the tantalizing

36

promise that a large enough dataset of informative biomarkers might both elucidate the causal

37

factors behind aging, and provide precise, individualized diagnoses (5). Biomarkers have also

38

been proposed as surrogate endpoints, allowing studies to forgo the slow and expensive process

39

of measuring the symptoms of aging as they develop over time (6). However, the limits of what

40

biomarkers can tell us about aging, and the consequences of the methods by which we discover

41

biomarkers, have yet to be examined theoretically.

42

Biomarkers, broadly speaking, are biological quantities that are convenient to measure, and

43

that give us medically important information (7, 8). Biomarkers can inform three very different

44

categories of medically important information. First, biomarkers can inform diagnosis and

45

associated prognosis. The first molecular biomarker was glucose, used to diagnose diabetes (9).

46

Historically, sweet urine indicated death within a matter of months (10), making glucose in the

47

urine useful for informing prognosis but little else. Today, prognosis without treatment is still

48

useful for patients with untreatable cancer or Alzheimer’s disease, who may wish to put their

49

affairs in order. Biomarkers for aging can similarly predict lifespan remaining or future quality

50

of life (e.g. 11).

51

Second, biomarkers can reveal disease mechanisms. Perhaps surprisingly, while glucose is

52

important to the mechanism of diabetes, historically, it did not lead physicians directly to the

53

causal mechanisms of the disease. When medieval physicians noticed that glucose in the urine

54

varied with diet, they mistakenly concluded that diabetes must be a disease of the digestive

55

system (10). Instead, the indirect advantage of the discovery of glucose was that because its

56

presence in the urine aided diagnosis, it facilitated the search for other mechanistic clues,

57

specifically abnormalities in the pancreas noted during autopsy (12). In contrast, after cholesterol

58

was noted as a prognostic biomarker for coronary artery disease, this led more directly to

59

understanding the mechanistic role of plaque build-up (13).

60

Third, a biomarker can provide information that enhances interventions and improves

61

outcomes (14). Such markers are called “predictive” rather than the “prognostic” biomarkers

62

discussed above (15, 16). Insulin treatment, combined with a more accurate blood test (17), made

63

glucose an important biomarker to drive treatment decisions (10). The presence of hormone

64

receptors in breast cancer biopsy tissue is another predictive biomarker used to make treatment

65

decisions. There is hope that the many cancer driver mutations currently being identified might

66

also move from prognostic indicators to drug targets, in the way that oncofusion protein BCR-

67

Abl (18) is targeted by Gleevec.

68

Identifying biomarkers generally begins with noting a correlation between a measurement

69

and patient fate (19-22). Patient fate can be measured longitudinally, or else a known correlate of

70

patient fate can be measured within a contemporaneous cross-section. To measure biomarkers of

71

aging in a longitudinal study, potential markers are measured at the start, and a cohort is then

72

followed through time to determine mortality. The correlation between marker status at the

73

beginning of the study and later mortality rates or other symptoms of aging is then ascertained

74

(23-25). In a cross-sectional study, biomarkers are identified based on their ability to predict

75

either current chronological age (26), or a composite of chronological age and physiological

76

indicators often termed “biological age” (27), even when their intent, as described above, is to

77

predict lifespan remaining (28). New technologies mean that we can now investigate many

78

potential biomarkers simultaneously, which opens the door both to discovering more and/or

79

better markers, and to the risk of spurious results (29).

80

Longitudinal studies are obviously slow and difficult to conduct, but cross-sectional studies

81

may not yield reliable results. Individuals with lower intrinsic mortality rates are likely to survive

82

to older ages than their peers with high mortality rates, and are thereby more likely to be

83

observed at older ages. This bias, known as cohort selection (30), may complicate the search for

84

biomarkers of aging. Here, we simulate core aspects of the search for epigenetic biomarkers in

85

the cross-sectional approaches, specifically those of Horvath and collaborators (26, 27, 31). We

86

include the possibility of cohort selection, in order to determine what cross-sectionally identified

87

biomarkers can, and cannot, tell us about aging.

88
89
90

Methods:
We first conduct simulations based on the procedure of Horvath (26), who trained an

91

algorithm to predict chronological age from DNA methylation status at 21,389 sites in a cross-

92

section of 7,844 individuals of different ages. The resulting regression model used 353 of those

93

sites, and was used to assess the relative rate of aging (assessed as the difference between

94

predicted age and chronological age) in a wide range of test datasets, from cancer tissue to

95

patients with progeria.

96

Guided by this procedure, we simulate the methylation status of many loci during aging,

97

followed by cross-sectional approaches to select loci as biomarkers. Specifically, we simulate

98

L=20,000 loci in each individual. Each locus has two states, degraded and non-degraded, and

99

begins the simulation in the undegraded state. We simulate enough individuals to obtain 1000

100

living individuals at each target age of 10, 20, 30,…80 years, with simulations proceeding in

101

discrete time steps of one year. Each year, each un-degraded locus i has a probability 𝜌" of

102

degrading, making the mean age at which the locus degrades (1-𝜌i)/ 𝜌i.

103

We consider two models for the probability of dying m. First, we make the probability of

104

dying increase exponentially with time, independently of which loci have degraded, according to

105

a Gompertz mortality curve (32):
𝑚 = α exp(𝛾𝑡)

106
107

Using mortality rates from Arias et al. (33), we estimate 𝛼 = 𝑒 012 deaths/year and 𝛾 =

108

0.0807/year to obtain a survival curve that approximates human demography in a developed

109

nation, excluding elevated infant and early adult mortality, as well as any late life mortality

110

deceleration.

(1)

111

In the second model, we make mortality a function of the number of degraded loci,

112

choosing a function that yields a mortality curve that increases approximately exponentially with

113

age. Specifically, we make mortality a power function of the sum of the effects of all degraded

114

loci:

115

𝑚 = 𝑎(1 − ∑" 𝑏" 𝑥" )=

(2)

116

where bi is the effect size of locus i (often 0) and xi is 0 if the locus is in an undegraded state and

117

1 if the locus is degraded. Log mortality then has a linear relationship with age (i.e. we have a

118

Gompertz mortality curve) in the special case where ∑" 𝑏" = 1, with k determining its slope.

119

With 𝑘 < 0, mortality varies from a minimum of 𝑎 when no causal sites have degraded to a

120

maximum of infinity (instant death) when all sites have degraded. In our simulations, we set 𝑏"

121

for all causative sites to equal 1⁄𝐿 where 𝐿 is the number of causative loci. We refer to the

6

122

“effect size” as the percent increase in mortality resulting from a single degraded locus in an

123

otherwise undegraded individual: 100 × ((1 − 𝑏" )= − 1).

124

To parameterize Equation 2 to approximate the Gompertz curve parameter values of

125

Equation (1), we assume (just for the purpose of this parameterization) that all loci degrade at the

126

same rate 𝜌, and thus the expected number of degraded loci as a function of time t is E(∑" 𝑥" ) =

127

𝐿(1 − (1 − 𝜌)D ). If we ignore variation both in effect sizes of causative loci and in the number

128

of causative loci degraded, and we also ignore cohort selection (i.e. ignoring the fact that

129

individuals with more than average degradations are less likely to be alive to have their mortality

130

assessed), substitution of this expectation into Equation 2 would yield:

131

𝑚 = 𝑎 exp(𝑘𝑡 ln(1 − 𝜌))

(3)

132

We therefore set 𝑎 = α and 𝑘 = 𝛾/ ln(1 − 𝜌) in Equation 2. Figure 1 shows that when these

133

simplifying assumptions are relaxed, mortality in our Equation (2) simulations (red and blue for

134

small and large 𝑏" , respectively) still exhibits the exponential relationship with time

135

characteristic of a Gompertz mortality curve (solid black), with a slight deviation toward late life

136

due to cohort selection when loci are of large effect (blue).

137

Some more recent efforts to identify biomarkers of aging (e.g. Levine (27)) train on a

138

measure of “biological age” that incorporates phenotypic indicators in addition to chronological

139

age. Phenotypic indicators are physiological measurements identified by their ability to predict,

140

within a linear regression, mortality rates measured in a longitudinal study.

141

To determine how including measures of biological age affects the search for causal

142

biomarkers of aging, we construct a simulated “biological age” phenotype p. We assume that

143

phenotype can be scaled such that the mean phenotype of each age group is equal to the mean

144

mortality rate of that age group (i.e., 𝑚
HHHHD = 𝑝JD ), and that once this is done, the variance in

145

phenotype among individuals of age t is equal to the variance in mortality (i.e., vart(mi) =

146

vart(pi)). We also assume that within any age cohort, the phenotype correlates with mortality

147

with the same correlation coefficient 𝑟L,N . Finally, we assume p is normally distributed, making

148

individual i's simulated phenotype:

149

R
𝑝" = 𝑚
HHHHD + 𝑟L,N (𝑚" − HHHH)
𝑚D + 𝑁Q0, Q1 − 𝑟L,N
S varD (𝑚" )S

150

where 𝑚" is the true mortality rate of individual 𝑖, and 𝑁(0, 𝜎 R ) is a random number drawn from

151

a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 𝜎 R . This formulation lets 𝑟L,N determine the

152

fraction of variance in p that stems from variation in m, without changing vart(pi).

(4)

153

Next we consider how phenotypes can be used to construct a biological age. Simulated

154

phenotypic values could be used, along with mean mortality HHHH
𝑚D for each age group, to predict

155

individual mortality rates using a linear model:
𝑚
[Ẏ = 𝛽D 𝑚
HHHHD + 𝛽L 𝑝"

156

(5)

157

Instead of simulating the fit of this regression model to a data sample, we consider the

158

best possible predictor by obtaining values for 𝛽 analytically when the number of datapoints n

159

goes to infinity. First, we take the expectation of both sides of Eq. 5, giving 𝑚
HHHHD = lim 𝛽D 𝑚
HHHHD +

160
161

lim 𝛽L 𝑚
HHHH,
D hence for the best predictor we will have 𝛽D = 1 − 𝛽L .

_→a

Second, we minimize the sum of squares ∑_"(𝑚
[Ẏ − 𝑚" )R . From Equation 5,
R

∑_"(𝑚
[Ẏ − 𝑚" )R = ∑_"Q𝛽D HHHH
𝑚D + 𝛽L 𝑝" − 𝑚" S .

HHHHD + 𝛽L 𝑝" − 𝑚" c .

This reaches a minimum when the derivative by 𝛽L is zero, which occurs when 𝛽L = 𝑟L,N .

175

To obtain an estimated biological age 𝑡fẎ from the combination of an observed phenotype

176

𝑝" and a chronological age t, using this idealized linear model, we back-transform the estimated

177

mortality from Equation 5 using the Gompertz mortality function (Equation 1):

178
179

𝑡fY = g (ln 𝑚
[Ẏ − ln 𝛼)

(9)

For each age cohort, we simulate each individual until they either die or reach the target

180

age; only the latter are included in the training dataset. The process is repeated until we obtain

181

1000 individuals for each of the 8 ages of interest. Each locus is coded as 1 if degraded at the age

182

of sampling and 0 otherwise. We correlate loci status either with chronological age, as in

183

Horvath (26), or with biological age, as in Levine et al. (27), using the glmnet package in R (34).

184

Regression coefficients between locus status and age are generated with a ridge lasso elastic net

185

with the elastic net mixing parameter α=0.5 as in Horvath (26). During our analysis we noticed

186

subtle biases in the regression coefficients generated by glmnet as a function of the order in

187

which the loci appear in the training data set. To prevent such biases from affecting our results,

188

we randomized the order of loci in the data set.

Results:

191

First, we illustrate the effect of cohort selection on the degradation status of age-causing

192

and neutral loci over time (Figure 2). Let ni be the number of individuals with i degraded loci,

193

mi(t) the probability of dying from age t to age t+1 of individuals with l degraded loci, and

194

𝑝h"_iN (𝑙 − 𝑖, 𝐿 − 𝑙, 𝜌" ) the probability from a binomial distribution of 𝑙 − 𝑖 loci degrading out of

195

𝐿 − 𝑙 previously non-degraded loci when the probability of a locus degrading per year is pi. The

196

expected number of individuals of age t years with l degraded loci is then:
𝑛k (𝑡) = ∑k" 𝑛" (𝑡 − 1)Q1 − 𝑚" (𝑡 − 1)S𝑝h"_iN (𝑙 − 𝑖, 𝐿 − 𝑙, 𝜌" )

197
198

(10)

For neutral loci, we make mortality a function of time as given by Equation 1 (Figure 2,

199

dashed black); for causative loci, mortality is given by Equation 2 (Figure 2, solid grey). Early in

200

life, the frequency of degraded age-causing loci is dominated by the rate of degradation and is

201

thus indistinguishable from neutral loci. Later in life, the additional mortality incurred by age-

202

causing loci results in a slight decline in frequency relative to non-causal loci. We will see

203

below that even though cohort selection is subtle as illustrated in Figure 2, it is nevertheless

204

enough to make loci that cause aging slightly worse correlates of chronological age than neutral

205

loci.

206

Next, we examine the effect of two locus attributes – degradation rate, and the effect size

207

of degradation on mortality – on the regression coefficient assigned by glmnet as a predictor of

208

age. Loci with expected ages of degradation less than 40 make poor biomarkers of age, and the

209

most commonly selected biomarkers have expected ages of degradation between 60 and 100

210

(Figure 3A). Similarly, the most informative loci (i.e. those assigned the largest weights by

211

glmnet) are expected to degrade between ages 70 through 90 (Figure 3B).

212

Loci that have no causal effect on mortality are more likely to be chosen as informative

213

markers (Figure 3C) than their age-causing counterparts. This counter-intuitive result arises

214

because, as shown in Figure 2, cohort selection makes age-causing loci correlate more weakly

215

with age than neutral loci. This biases regression analyses trained on age toward neutral markers.

216

In the rare cases when age-causing loci of large effect are chosen, they have slightly smaller

217

regression coefficients than neutral loci (Figure 3D). Together, these results show that loci that

218

cause aging are worse predictors of chronological age than neutral loci.

219

Training on chronological age biases regression analysis away from identifying causative

220

loci of aging, but more recent work instead trains biomarkers on “biological age,” a combination

221

of chronological age and phenotypic measurements that are known to correlate with mortality

222

(27). Such phenotypic measurements are identified by regressing phenotype and mortality over

223

the course of a longitudinal study (e.g. 24).

224

To determine whether training on longitudinally validated correlates of aging can help

225

identify causative loci of aging in a cross-sectional study, we modified our analysis to

226

incorporate chronological age, a known correlate of individual mortality, and simulated noise.

227

We construct a simulated biological age-revealing phenotype such that the correlation coefficient

228

𝑟L,N between an appropriately transformed version of that phenotype and mortality has the same

229

value within each age cohort. Biological age is then calculated as an optimal function of

230

R
phenotype and chronological age (see Methods). When 𝑟L,N
= 1, biological age perfectly reflects

231

R
an individual’s true mortality; when 𝑟L,N
= 0, it gives no information beyond that already given

232

by chronological age. Figure 4 shows that when phenotype provides little additional information

233

R
(𝑟L,N
< 0.04), non-causative loci (blue circles) are preferentially chosen as biomarkers to predict

11

234

R
biological age. However, when phenotype is a reliable indicator of mortality (𝑟L,N
> 0.7) most,

235

or even all, causative loci (red diamonds) are chosen as biomarkers of age.

236

To evaluate the quality of existing age-revealing phenotypes in the context of the search

237

for causative biomarkers of aging, we used NHANES III linked laboratory and mortality data

238

from the CDC (35, 36). We regressed (using the lm function in R) the nine phenotypic indicators

239

used in Levine et al. (27) (white blood cell count, serum alkaline phosphatase, red cell width

240

distribution, mean blood cell volume, lymphocytes percent, ln(serum C-reactive protein), serum

241

creatinine, serum albumin, and serum glucose) on lifespan remaining, including only the 6898

242

individuals who had died over the course of the study. Chronological age explained r2 =0.184 of

243

variation in lifespan remaining, while the combination of chronological age plus phenotype

244

explained r2 =0.28, indicating that the amount of unique information provided by phenotype is r2

245

= 0.096 with respect to lifespan remaining, on the cusp of where biological age is useful for

246

identifying causative loci of aging in our idealized model with respect to mortality rate.

247

However, there is also considerable stochastic variation in lifespan remaining even when there is

248

no variance in underlying mortality rate. It therefore seems clear that the phenotypic age markers

249

used by Levine et al. (27) are above the threshold quality needed to identify causal loci of aging

250

more often than chance.

251

Next, we examine whether biomarkers of aging may be useful prognostic indicators of

252

variation in the overall rate of degradation between individuals. To test this, we generated

253

populations where the rate of aging varies among individuals, and populations where individuals

254

vary in initial status, but then continue to age at the same rate. We trained the model to predict

255

chronological age from loci status, as above. Comparing the difference between predicted age

256

and chronological age to the known underlying rate of aging shows that biomarkers, even neutral

257

biomarkers, can provide useful information regarding the rate of aging (Figure 5A), but not

258

regarding initial mortality rate (Figure 5B). Note that we examined the special case in which

259

variation in either the slope or intercept of the aging curve arises at birth. These results should

260

still hold when it is later events that alter longevity, e.g. following an intervention. Biomarkers of

261

aging could therefore inform the efficacy of interventions that affect the slope of the Gompertz

262

curve, but not its intercept.

Discussion:
Like other biomarkers discussed in the Introduction, biomarkers of aging can have three uses:

266

to estimate lifespan remaining (prognosis), to identify the mechanisms that cause aging (37, 38),

267

and, most ambitiously and usually late in their development, to distinguish classes of individuals

268

for whom different treatments are appropriate. In cross-sectional studies, epigenetic biomarkers

269

of aging have been selected for their ability to predict age at the time of sampling (21). However,

270

the individuals in the training dataset are not random samples from their age cohort. Specifically,

271

some individuals will not be sampled because they died before reaching the age of interest, and

272

these individuals will on average be faster-aging. The resulting bias is known as cohort selection.

273

Here, we have shown that cohort selection can make a cross-sectional study design spectacularly

274

ineffective at identifying causal factors of aging.

275

While we have focused on cohort selection associated with causal locus-induced mortality, a

276

similar sampling bias can arise from study exclusion criteria. Sicker individuals might be less

277

likely to enroll in such studies, and may be excluded, e.g. if they have defined diseases whose

278

prevalence increases with age, such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes (39). In a cross-

279

sectional study, any alleles or epigenetic events that cause a predisposition toward such diseases

280

will thus be underrepresented in older individuals.

281

Even if cross-sectional analyses trained on chronological age cannot identify loci that

282

contribute to accelerating mortality, such analyses are not without value. Much effort has been

283

put into quantifying natural variation in the slope and intercept of the aging curve (40) as well as

284

the impact of interventions (41, 42). Our simulations show that aging biomarkers can provide

285

prognostic (and hence potentially diagnostic) information regarding variation in the overall rate

286

of degradation among individuals (25), but not in the basal mortality rate. They may therefore be

287

useful in identifying factors affecting the overall rate of aging, as suggested by Horvath (26).

288

Biomarker selection enriches not just for non-causal loci, but also for loci with an expected

289

age of degradation toward the end of human lifespan. To obtain this result, we considered the

290

degradation rate of a locus to be independent of its causal effect. Whether selection against age-

291

related mortality, which is necessarily subtle (43), can lead to lower degradation rates in age-

292

causing loci than in the rest of the genome is an important theoretical and empirical question.

293

Degradation rates are a function of evolvable factors such as sequence context, chromatin

294

structure, or enzyme recruitment (44-46). The evolution of site-specific error rates has been

295

observed for species with larger population sizes than humans (47-49). Comparing methylation

296

changes associated with the expression of genes known a priori to play a role in aging to those in

297

putatively neutral sites may help illuminate whether loci that cause aging are under tighter

298

regulation than the genome as a whole.

299

While we have focused on molecular biomarkers of aging, our results apply to non-molecular

300

markers as well. Indeed, the most commonly used non-molecular markers of aging, such as grip

301

strength or skin elasticity (50, 51), are non-causal.

302

Our results show that such physiological measurements, if sufficiently strongly correlated

303

with mortality, can be used to identify causal loci of aging. However, a longitudinal study is

304

required first to identify reliable physiological markers of mortality rates, whether molecular

305

(52), physical (53, 54), or mental (55). What we have shown is that it is possible for a cross-

306

sectional study to “piggy back” off markers identified from a longitudinal study to identify other,

307

causative, loci of aging.

308

To better identify causal factors of aging we need a better understanding of what it means

309

to be “aged”. Regression analyses using subjects’ chronological ages implicitly assume that

310

“aging” is the process of having survived for a certain duration of time. Alternatively, “age” can

311

be interpreted as morbidity, with associated mortality rate following a Gompertz curve.

312

Ultimately, we are interested in the causal factors that prevent survival or decrease quality of life

313

beyond a certain age. Our results confirm the critical importance of long-term longitudinal

314

studies, whether directly conducted or indirectly incorporated, in finding both correlates and

315

causes of aging.

on average, than those of neutral loci, at least when causative loci are of fairly large effect

488

(>2%). Panels A and B show the outcome of a single simulation in which each of the 20,000

489

loci have expected ages of degradation 1+199(i/20,000) for integers i = 0 through 20,000. All

490

loci are neutral and mortality is determined by Equation (1). Horizontal lines indicate the

491

y-axis value corresponding to the 200 loci in each bin. A degradation time well above

492

human lifespans indicates a locus with a low probability of degrading prior to death. Each

493

point in panels C and D shows the mean outcomes of six independent replicate simulations

494

in which each of the 20,000 loci are either neutral or have a single causal effect size (non-

495

round-number effect sizes are an artifact of making choices using an alternative effect size

496

metric). Mortality is determined by Equation (2), with the numbers of causative loci (top x-

497

axis C,D) inversely proportional to the effect size of a causal locus (bottom x-axis C,D). In

498

C and D, all loci have an expected age of degradation of 75 years. Error bars show

499

standard errors; markers for causative loci have been offset slightly to the right.

Figure 4: When phenotypes can accurately distinguish individual mortality within a cohort

503

of the same age, regression on biological age (here an optimal function of both

504

chronological age and phenotype) can preferentially choose loci that cause aging (red

505

diamonds) over neutral loci (blue circles) as biomarkers of aging. As in the rightmost

506

markers in Figure 3 C and D, here 301 loci of large effect are causative of aging.

Figure 5: The deviation between an individual’s chronological age and predicted age

511

informs the rate of aging, as measured by the slope of the Gompertz mortality curve (A),

512

but not the intercept of the Gompertz mortality curve (B). Mortality depends on causal

513

biomarker loci according to Equation 2. Markers were chosen by regression on

514

chronological age in a training dataset, then applied to a separate testing dataset of

515

independent but identically constructed simulations. In A, each individual’s rate of aging

516

was drawn at birth from a normal distribution with mean 0.0807 and standard deviation

517

0.00807. The rate of aging 𝛾i of individual i determines the probability of degradation 𝝆i of

519

gives an estimated age of degradation of 75 years as in Figure 3; all loci are non-degraded

520

at birth. In B, a number of loci drawn from a Poisson distribution with mean 10,000 were

521

degraded at birth, making the mean mortality rate at birth of individuals in the top

522

quartile roughly 17% higher than those of the bottom quartile. To keep the mean mortality

rate at birth m0=e-10 as above, we make a=6.65×10-7; the rate of degradation of loci is
