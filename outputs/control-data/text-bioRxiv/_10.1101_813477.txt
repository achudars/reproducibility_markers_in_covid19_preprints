The 16S rRNA gene is the golden standard target of sequencing to uncover the composition of

4

bacterial communities but the presence of multiple copies of the gene makes gene copy

5

normalization (GCN) inevitable. Even though GCN resulted in abundances closer to the

6

metagenome, it should be validated by communities with known composition as both amplicon

7

and shotgun sequencing are prone to methodological biases. Here we compared the

8

composition of three mock communities to the composition derived from 16S sequencing

9

without and with GCN. In all of them, the 16S composition was different from the mock

10

community and GCN improved the picture only in the community with the lowest Shannon

11

diversity. Albeit with low abundance, half of the identified genera were not present in the mock

12

communities. Our approach provides empirical evidence to the methodological biases

13

introduced by sequencing that was only counteracted by GCN in the case of low α-diversity,

14

potentially due to the small number of bacterial taxa with known gene copy numbers. We thus

15

cannot recommend the use of GCN moving forward and it is questionable whether a complete

16

catalogue of 16S rRNA copy numbers can outweigh the methodological biases of sequencing.

17

Amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA is the golden standard to describe the composition of

18

bacterial communities due to (i) cost, (ii) availability, (iii) presence of extraction and preparation

19

kits, (iv) taxonomic resolution as deep as the level of genera and (v) previous research.

20

Unsurprisingly it outcompeted (46,473 papers as of February 2019) other possible techniques

21

to describe community structures such as metagenomics (7,699), metaproteomics (367) or

22

metatranscriptomics (439). The general practice as shown by the myriads of publications does

23

not comprise the correction of the obtained raw counts by 16S rRNA gene copy numbers per

24

bacterial genome even though it is known that bacteria can have multiple copy numbers of the

25

gene 1. Logically, two bacteria with similar raw counts but different gene copy numbers cannot

26

be equally abundant which is why GCN seems necessary. The recent recommendation against

27

GCN based on the systematic evaluation of the predictability of 16S GCNs in bacteria

28

contradict the previous suggestion in favor of GCN based on the comparison of 16S and

29

metagenomics 1. However, sequencing techniques are prone to similar methodological biases

30

introduced by extraction, PCR, sequencing and bioinformatics, and could thus similarly diverge

31

from the real picture as recently demonstrated 3. We therefore believe that the use of mock

32

communities as standard is inevitable to prove the viability of GCN. Here we compared three

33

randomly chosen taxonomically different mock communities (Mock-2, Mock-20 and Mock-21)

34

from mockrobiata provided elsewhere

35

genomic DNA from bacterial strains and the subsequent 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to

36

estimate the impact of GCN on the bacterial community composition.

that derived from the combination of extracted

37

Operational taxonomic units (OTU) were annotated by blastn 5 as best hit down to the

38

genus level with an average similarity match of 97.7±1.7% for Mock-2, 97.4±1.7% for Mock-20

39

and 97.6±1.6% for Mock-21. In total 3,973 from 34,154 OTU counts (13.2%) in Mock-2 could not

40

be assigned to a bacterial genus compared to 378 from 173,460 (0.22%) for Mock-20 and 328

41

from 180,542 (0.18%) for Mock-21. Mock-2 comprised of 23 bacterial genera of which only 14

42

were identified by 16S sequencing opposed to 17 in Mock-20 and 16 in Mock-21 of which all

43

have been identified (Figure 1). These findings illustrated missed identifications that seem to be

44

related to the sequencing depth. 30,000 OTU counts for Mock-2 were not sufficient to identify

45

all of the 23 genera in the community whereas 180,000 OTU counts for Mock-20 and Mock-21

46

resulted in the identification of all genera. However, the three mock communities are simple

47

compared to the billions of organisms belonging to thousands of different species in one gram

48

of soil 6. Particularly considering the prokaryotic density of 10,000,000 organisms per gram of

49

soil 7 that is at least one magnitude of order higher than per milliliter of water in the ocean 8,

50

we conclude that 10,000 but at least 2,000 OTU counts per taxonomic rank of interest are

51

necessary to fully cover the members of the community.

52

In total, 19 genera in Mock-2 together with 18 in Mock-20 and 77 in Mock-22 were

53

wrongly identified during sequencing due to their absence when the extracted genomic DNA

54

was combined. Admittedly, the majority among them were found with low abundance,

55

presumably as noise during sequencing. However, Klebsiella of the family Enterobacteriaceae

56

comprised high abundances in each community. Together with highly abundant extracted DNA

57

from Escherichia but low sequencing abundances, we conclude the misidentification of

58

Escherichia, also an Enterobacteriaceae, as Klebsiella. In compliance with our results,

59

phylogenetic trees based on the 16S rRNA gene are ambiguous in Enterobacteriaceae and differ

60

in the relative position of several genera 9,10. Processes of recombination and gene conversion

61

11,12

62

previously hold accountable. Here we provide empirical evidence for the misidentification of

63

Escherichia as Klebsiella, which could prove to be detrimental for proper prophylactic medical

64

treatment since both are pathogens causing a different array of diseases 14,15. Even though one

65

advantage of targeting the 16S rRNA gene is taxonomic resolution, we report the failure of

66

correct identification of the genus within Enterobacteriaceae, which could be true for other

67

bacterial families as well.

, and different sequences of the 16S rRNA gene found within a single species

13

were

68

Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) revealed that the mock community

69

composition derived from combining extracted DNA was indeed different to the composition

70

derived from 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (Figure 2). GCN did not impact the

71

community composition and its relative distance within two dimension of the NMDS to Mock-2

72

and Mock-20, which was further supported by the residual sum of squares between each mock

73

community and 16S sequencing without and with GCN (Table 1). However, in Mock-21, GCN

74

resulted in a picture closer to the mock community, presumably due to the low complexity of

75

the community as its Shannon diversity on genus level was 40% lower (1.69) than in Mock-2

76

(2.71) and in Mock-21 (2.76). Logically we suggest that GCN in communities of low Shannon

77

diversity (<<2.7) could be beneficial. However, the Shannon diversity of bacterial communities

78

typically range between 3 and 6 in both terrestrial 16–19 and aquatic ecosystems 20,21, which are

79

likely too diverse for GCN to have an impact as shown for Mock-2 and Mock-20.

80

Concluding, together with the issues to predict 16S GCNs in bacteria 2, we cannot

81

recommend the use of GCN based on the in vitro comparison of sequenced amplicons from

82

three randomly chosen mock communities.
