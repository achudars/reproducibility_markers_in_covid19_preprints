Abstract
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) induces an acute inflammatory response in the central nervous
system that involves both resident and peripheral immune cells. The ensuing chronic
neuroinflammation

causes

cell

death

and

tissue

damage

and

may

contribute

to

neurodegeneration. The molecular mechanisms involved in the maintenance of this chronic
inflammation state remain underexplored. C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) 1 and 2 are
transcriptional coregulators that repress diverse cellular processes. Unexpectedly, we find that the
CtBPs can transactivate a common set of proinflammatory genes both in lipopolysaccharideactivated microglia, astrocytes and macrophages, and in a mouse model of the mild form of TBI.
We also find that the expression of these genes is markedly enhanced by a single mild injury in
both brain and peripheral blood leukocytes in a severity- and time-dependent manner. Moreover,
we were able to demonstrate that specific inhibitors of the CtBPs effectively suppress the
expression of the CtBP target genes and thus improve neurological outcome in mice receiving
single and repeated mild TBIs. This discovery suggests new avenues for therapeutic modulation
of the inflammatory response to brain injury.

Introduction
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability among children and young
adults in the United States (1-3). It can be classified as mild, moderate and severe based on
neurological injury severity. Severe TBI is a well-established risk factor for several diseases of the
aging brain, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease
(4). The mild form of traumatic brain injury (mTBI, also known as concussion) accounts for >80%
of all TBIs (5, 6). The majority of mTBI patients experience full recovery within a couple of weeks
to months. A small minority of these patients (10–20%) experience persistent postinjury symptoms
(7-9). Disturbingly, even a single mTBI induces pathophysiological changes in the brain that can
be detected in both acute and chronic phases postinjury (10-12). Athletes and military service
members are especially vulnerable to multiple mTBIs, raising concerns about cumulative or longterm effects of recurrent insults (8, 13). In effect, repeated mTBI has been linked to late-onset
neurodegenerative disease development, such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (14, 15). There
are currently no FDA-approved drugs specifically for TBI.
TBI elicits a distinct inflammatory response in the central nervous system (CNS) that involves
both local and peripheral immunocytes (16-18). The acute phase of the injury begins within
minutes of the primary mechanical damage to the brain tissue. Microglial and astroglial activation
can persist for months and years after TBI and can affect CNS neurodegeneration. In mTBI,
diffuse axonal injury, often resulting from impact/acceleration forces, leads to the release of danger
signals such as damage-associated molecular patterns and alarmins from the stressed axons (19,
20). These signals induce the rapid activation of resident microglia, which upregulate the
expression of an array of inflammatory mediators to amplify the immune response and recruit
peripheral immune cells to the damage site. Excessive inflammation causes cell death and tissue
damage and in the chronic phase may contribute to neurodegeneration (21). There is a compelling
need for effective neuroprotective interventions that improve functional outcomes in TBI patients
(22, 23). In spite of its recognized importance in the regulation of inflammatory responses,
inhibition of NF-kB showed a limited neuroprotective effect in experimental models of TBI (24,

25). As such, the discovery and development of new modulators of brain injury-mediated
neuroinflammatory response are the subject of intense pharmaceutical efforts.
C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) 1 and 2 are paralogous transcriptional coregulators that
repress diverse biological processes by directly binding transcription factors and recruiting
chromatin-modifying enzymes to target gene promoters (26, 27). These two proteins exhibit a
remarkable structural similarity to D2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases, including an N-terminal
substrate binding domain, a central NAD(H)-binding domain and a C-terminal extension (28).
They also contain a hydrophobic cleft within the N-terminal substrate binding domain known as
the PXDLS-binding site and a surface groove within the central NAD(H)-binding domain that
recognizes the sequence RRTGXPPXL (RRT motif) (29-31). These two unique structural
elements constitute the majority of CtBP interactions with transcription factors and chromatin
modifying enzymes such as histone deacetylases, acetyltransferase, methyltransferases and
demethylases (32-35). NAD(H) facilitates the dimerization of the CtBPs and promotes their
transcriptional corepression function (36, 37). The CtBPs, which were originally identified through
their binding to the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein (38), have been demonstrated to regulate multiple
transcription factor networks with roles in tumorigenesis and cell survival (26, 39, 40). Inhibition
of the interaction between the CtBPs and their PXDLS-containing target proteins by the peptide
Pep1-E1A has been shown to block transcriptional repressor activity and mitigate oncogenic
phenotypes in mice (41). On the other hand, the small molecule MTOB that inhibits the
dehydrogenase activity of the CtBPs attenuates the growth and self-renewal of cancer stem cells
in vitro and decreases tumor burden in a mouse model of colon cancer (42-44). In addition, it is
postulated that the CtBPs also function as context-dependent transcriptional coactivators (34, 45,
46). In this report, our results indicate that CtBP1 and CtBP2 increase the in vivo transcription of
proinflammatory genes in response to mTBI; reveal that the mechanism underlying both local and
systematic induction of these CtBP target genes operates in an impact energy dose- and timedependent manner; and indicate that Pep1-E1A and MTOB inhibit the transactivating activity of
the CtBPs, reduce microglia activation and ameliorate neurological deficits following single and

repeated injuries in mice, thus demonstrating the potential utility of these agents to modulate the
immune response to head injury.
Results and Discussion
CtBP1 and CtBP2 are required for the transactivation of proinflammatory genes in LPSactivated microglia and macrophages
To explore the role of the CtBPs in cellular regulation of the inflammatory response, we
investigated their occupancy on the promoters of the 674 inflammatory response genes of the Gene
Ontology GO:0006954 set (47, 48) through the analysis of CtBP ChIP-seq data obtained from nonstimulated breast cancer cells (49). We observed a moderate enrichment in the promoters of the
IL1B, IL6, TNFA, ICAM1, VCAM1, S100A8, S100A9, NLRP3 and PTGS2 genes. To assess whether
the inflammation-induced expression of the above genes is CtBP-dependent, we evaluated the
effects of siRNA-mediated simultaneous knockdown of CtBP1 and CtBP2 on the mRNA levels of
these candidate genes in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglia and macrophage using the
reverse transcription and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) method. As shown in Figures 1A
and 1B, exposure to LPS induces the expression of all nine genes (3- to 70-fold increase) in the
murine BV2 microglia and RAW264.7 macrophages. Silencing of the CtBP genes markedly
decreases the LPS-induced gene expression, ranging from 40% to 85% (see Figures 1A and 1B),
suggesting that CtBP1 and CtBP2 are involved in the upregulation of these genes in response to
LPS activation. We also observed similar CtBP-dependent activation of the above nine genes in
LPS-stimulated human THP-1 monocytes. Thus, CtBPs likely regulate the expression of the nine
candidate genes in the human and mouse monocytes. To validate our analysis, we performed
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments in the LPS-activated BV2 cells to measure
CtBP binding to the promoter regions of the four strongly induced genes (IL1B, IL6, TNFA and
S100A8) as a testbed. Indeed, LPS stimulates a significant increase in the binding of CtBP1 (10to 17-fold change) and CtBP2 (7- to 14-fold change) to the promoter regions of these genes (Figure
1C). We also found that the promoter recruitment of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) p300, a
PXDLS-containing protein that binds CtBP (32), is intimately associated with CtBP occupancy at

the four target genes (Figure 1C). Taken together, our findings indicate that CtBP1 and CtBP2
serve as transcriptional coactivators capable of enhancing LPS-induced expression of the nine
aforementioned proinflammatory genes.
Pep1-E1A suppresses the induction of the CtBP target genes in LPS-activated mouse
primary microglia and astrocytes
We have shown previously that the Pep1-E1A peptide disrupts the interaction of CtBP1 with the
PLDLS-containing repressor ZEB1 in cancer cells and relieves the transcriptional repression
of CDH1 (E-cadherin) and BAX by the CtBPs (Blevins et al., 2018). To explore whether this
peptide inhibitor can interfere with the transactivation function of CtBP1 and CtBP2, we
preincubated Pep1-E1A with mouse primary microglia and astrocytes for 2 h prior to stimulation
with LPS and measured mRNA levels of the above nine CtBP-regulated proinflammatory genes
by RT-qPCR. As expected, the LPS treatment of both microglia and astrocytes increases the
expression of these nine genes by 7- to 132-fold while reducing the expression
of CDH1 and BAX to approximately 50% of the levels seen in controls (Figures 2A and S1A). In
contrast, Pep1-E1A pretreatment significantly suppresses the LPS-induced expression of the nine
proinflammatory genes by 40 to 70%, and effectively relieves the repression of CDH1 and BAX
by ~50% (Figures 2A and S1A). We also note that Pep1-E1A pretreatment results in a 40% to 50%
decreases in the basal mRNA expression of these proinflammatory genes in both primary microglia
and astrocytes without stimulation with LPS, and causes a 57% and 80% increase in the basal
mRNA levels of CDH1 and BAX, respectively (Figures 2A and S1A). We conclude that CtBP1
and CtBP2 play a crucial role in mediating the activation of the nine proinflammatory genes. These
findings also indicate that the CtBPs exhibit a dual role in transcriptional activation and repression.
Mild TBI causes dynamic changes in the induction of gene expression by CtBP1 and CtBP2
in both brain and peripheral blood leukocytes
To directly evaluate the hypothesis that the CtBPs play a role in the regulation of the acute
inflammatory response following mild TBI, we used a closed-head impact model of engineered
rotational acceleration (CHIMERA) in mice to investigate the dose–response relationship between

injury severity and changes in the expression of CtBP target genes in vivo. This mouse model was
selected in the present study because diffuse axonal injury is the hallmark of inertial TBI (50).
Animals received sham or a single head injury with the impact kinetic energy of 0.5 J, 0.65 J and
0.8 J, respectively. At 24 h postinjury, brain and blood leukocyte samples were collected to
measure mRNA levels of the five CtBP-regulated proinflammatory genes identified above as well
as those of CtBP1 and CtBP2 by RT-qPCR. The single brain injury leads to the increased
expression

of

all

five

proinflammatory

genes

and CtBP2, in both

CNS

and

systemic compartments, in an impact energy dose-dependent manner (Figures 3A and 3B).
Specifically, the NLRP3, ICAM1, PTGS2 and CtBP2 genes are moderately upregulated in the
mouse brain, with 2.2- to 2.9-fold change at 0.5 J, 3.2- to 3.7-fold change at 0.65 J and 4.0- to 4.4fold change at 0.8 J. The IL1B gene is induced to a significant degree, with 23-, 34-, and 45-fold
change at 0.5 J, 0.65 J and 0.8 J, respectively. The expression of S100A8 is exceptionally high (76-,
93- and 109-fold change at 0.5 J, 0.65 J and 0.8 J, respectively). Remarkably, there is a strong,
linear correlation between the mRNA expression levels of the above six genes in the mouse brain
and peripheral blood leukocyte samples (Figures 3A and 3B). In parallel, we observed impact
energy dose-dependent increases in the expression of the S100A8, NLRP3 and CtBP2 proteins in
the injured mouse brain, as assessed by the Western blot method (Figure 3C). These data
demonstrate the dose-dependent effects of mild brain injury on CtBP-mediated inflammatory
response in mice. In addition, the upregulated CtBP2 gene expression observed following
mTBI has implications for the mechanism of CtBP-mediated transcriptional activation (see
Figures 3 A–C).
To characterize the kinetics of the above head injury-induced gene expression, animals
received a single impact of 0.7 J energy and were euthanized at different time points afterwards.
The mRNA expression levels of the five proinflammatory genes and CtBP2 started to increase in
both brain and peripheral blood leukocytes as early as 2 h postinjury, peaked at 24 h, and then
gradually decreased, but the level remained significantly higher than that in the sham control 72 h
after injury (p < 0.05, Figures 3D and 3E). Western blot analysis also shows time-dependent

changes in the expression of the S100A8, NLRP3 and CtBP2 proteins in the injured brain (Figure
3F). Moreover, the highest levels of these protein expression coincide with those of their mRNAs
at 24 h postinjury (see Figures 3D and 3F). Our data suggest that the CtBPs may play a role in
determining the timing and intensity of the inflammatory response to brain injury, consistent with
cerebral and plasma proinflammatory cytokine profile following injury in human TBI patients (51,
52).
To address the question whether the TBI-induced proinflammatory gene expression observed
in the peripheral blood leukocytes (see Figures 3B and 3E) is caused by the release of inflammatory
mediators from the injured brain or the region of the skin and/or skull at the point of impact, three
groups of mice received single head, back and ear impacts at 0.7 J energy, and their blood samples
and skin tissues containing the site of the impact were collected 24 h postinjury. Moderate mRNA
expression levels of the nine CtBP target genes identified in the present study were observed in
the skin of the three injury groups, whereas the head injury group exhibits significantly increased
mRNA levels of these genes in the circulating leukocytes relative to the other two groups (p <
0.001, Figures S2A and S2B). In particular, the most strongly upregulated genes S100A8 and
S100A9 in circulating leukocytes display >95-fold change in the head injury group, and 6- to 8fold change in the back and ear injury groups (Figure S2B). Our results suggest that the single mild
head injury can evoke a systemic inflammatory response. Consistent with this argument, systemic
inflammatory response syndrome is frequently observed in human patients with TBI (53). We
therefore propose that CtBP1 and CtBP2 are potential mediators of both local and systemic
inflammation in response to mTBI.
Therapeutic benefits of CtBP inhibition after mTBI
Because Pep1-E1A suppresses LPS-induced inflammatory response in primary microglia and
astrocytes by directly targeting the transcriptional activation function of CtBP1 and CtBP2 (see
Figures 2A and S1A), we investigated whether Pep1-E1A could be useful in attenuating the acute
inflammatory sequelae of brain trauma using our mouse model of mild head injury. To assess the
therapeutic efficacy of Pep1-E1A on head trauma, animals were subjected to the application of a

single head impact of 0.8 J energy. The animals were then randomized to begin treatment with
placebo (vehicle), Pep1-E1A or Pep1-E1AMut (3 mg/kg by i.p. injection at 1 h and 24 h postinjury).
An evaluation of neurological function was performed at 1 h, 24 h and 48 h after injury using
criteria of the neurological severity score (NSS). We found that averaged NSS numbers were
statistically different between the vehicle control and Pep1-E1A-treated groups at 48 h postinjury
(p < 0.05), while no significant differences were observed between the vehicle control and Pep1E1AMut-treated groups (Figure 4A). As expected, Pep-E1A treatment significantly reduces mRNA
expression of the nine CtBP-regulated proinflammatory genes described above near 48 h
postinjury in both brain tissue and peripheral blood leukocytes (Figures 4A and 4B). Thus, these
results demonstrate that the inhibition of CtBP1 and CtBP2 ameliorates mTBI-induced
inflammatory damage in mice. It is also noteworthy that the inhibitory effect of Pep1-E1A on the
CtBP-mediated transactivation is more pronounced in the peripheral blood cells (56–83%) than in
the brain tissues (21–41%), presumably due to the inability of the peptidic Pep1-E1A inhibitor to
efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier.
The small molecule NSC95397, like the peptide Pep1-E1A, inhibits the transcriptional
repressor activity of CtBP1 and CtBP2 by interfering with their binding to PXDLS-containing
targets (Blevins et al., 2015). The above mouse model of mild head injury was used to examine
the effectiveness of NSC95397 in limiting neuronal damage following TBI. NSC95397-treated
mice showed a significant improvement in neurobehavioral deficits, and lower NSS compared to
the vehicle control at 48 h (p < 0.05) and 72 h (p < 0.01) postinjury (Figure 5A). NSC95397
demonstrated equal inhibitory effects on the expression of the nine CtBP target genes in brain
tissue (66–86%) and peripheral blood leukocytes (68–90%) at 72 h postinjury (Figures 5B and 5C).
We next examined the effects of NSC95397 on the response of microglia and astrocytes to
local brain injury at 3 d after mTBI by immunofluorescence staining using antibodies specific for
the microglial marker Iba1 and the astrocytic marker GFAP (54, 55). Compared to sham brains,
injured brains showed significant increases in the number of Iba1-positive microglia in the optic
tract and of GFAP-positive astrocytes in the corpus callosum, indicating the activation and

proliferation of these CNS glial cells following head injury (Figure 5 D-G). By contrast, we
observed significantly reduced numbers of Iba1-positive microglia and GFAP-positive astrocytes
in the two above white matter-rich regions of NSC95397-treated brains (Figure 5 D-G). On the
other hand, Iba1-positive microglia in the optic tract of the injured brain exhibited the amoeboidlike morphology that is typically associated with activated microglia, while Iba1-positive
microglia in the NSC95397-treated brain showed decreased cell soma volume and increased cell
ramification, largely resembling the resting state morphology in the sham brain (Figure 5D). In
addition to white matter-rich regions, we also noted that NSC95397 treatment features GFAPpositive astrocytes in the hippocampal CA1 region with smaller, more compacted cell bodies and
elaborated thinner processes as compared to the vehicle control group (Figure 5H). These results
support our hypothesis that the pharmacological inhibition of CtBP1 and CtBP2 is a promising
strategy for the treatment of brain injury-induced inflammation and neurodegeneration.
As noted above, another small-molecule CtBP dehydrogenase inhibitor, MTOB, has been
shown to antagonize the transcriptional regulatory activity of CtBP1 and CtBP2 by eviction from
their target promoters in breast cancer cell lines (49). We therefore investigated whether MTOB,
as well as NSC95397, could alleviate neuroinflammation caused by repetitive mild head injury.
Mice were given either a single injury (1xTBI) or two injuries 24 h apart (2xTBI). The 2xTBI mice
received an injection of placebo (vehicle), MTOB (860 mg/kg) or NSC95397 (1.5 mg/kg) at 1 h
and 18 h after the first injury (see Figure 6A for experimental timeline). All mTBI groups showed
significantly increased loss of righting reflex (LRR) duration following the first injury as compared
to sham mice (Figure 6B). The 1xTBI group regained righting reflex within 24 h after injury, and
the 2xTBI group had a significantly longer LRR duration following the second injury (p < 0.01)
(Figure 6B). The increased duration of righting reflex was effectively suppressed by administration
of MTOB (p < 0.01) or NSC95397 (p < 0.05) after the first injury (Figure 6B). Furthermore, the
2xTBI group exhibited significantly higher NSS than the 1xTBI group at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h (p <
0.001) following the first injury (Figure 6C). NSS scores were significantly decreased by MTOB
(p < 0.001 at 24 h; p < 0.01 at 48 h; and p < 0.05 at 72 h) and by NSC95397 (p < 0.001 at 24 h and

p < 0.05 at 48 h) (Figure 6C). In addition, we observed a 150 to 230% increase in the mRNA
expression of the nine CtBP-regulated proinflammatory genes in the brain tissues of the 2xTBI
group as compared to the 1xTBI group at 3 d after the first injury (Figure 6D). The inhibitor-treated
mice exhibited lower or equal levels of expression of these CtBP target genes relative to the 1xTBI
mice (Figure 6D). Therefore, MTOB and NSC95397 attenuate repetitive head injury-elicited
neurologic dysfunction via inhibition of the transactivation activity of CtBP1 and CtBP2.
In summary, we prove that CtBP1 and CtBP2 can transactivate select proinflammatory target
genes in single and repetitive mTBI mice, thus contributing to acute neurological deficits
resembling clinical mTBI symptoms that can be quantified using the NSS score, as in our model
(see Figure 6E). We have also demonstrated that acute treatment with CtBP inhibitors mitigates
the TBI-induced inflammatory pathology and significantly improves mouse brain function. Finally,
and most importantly, these findings suggest that suppression of CtBP function could potentially
be an effective strategy to alleviate TBI-induced chronic inflammation and neurological
impairment.

Materials and Methods
Animals.
All animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the University of Colorado Anschutz
Medical Campus Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol B-114116(12)1E) and
performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. C57BL/6 mice were group
housed in environmentally controlled conditions with 12:12 h light:dark cycle and provided food
and water ad libitum.
CHIMERA TBI.
Mice at 16-20 weeks old of age (body weight 20-30 g) were randomly assigned to sham, injury,
or injury with treatment groups. Animals were anaesthetized with isoflurane (induction: 4.5%,
maintenance: 2.5-3%) in oxygen (0.9 L/min) and underwent TBI or sham procedures as described
(50). The average total duration of isoflurane exposure for the whole procedure was 3 to 4 min.
For single TBI experiments, mice received a closed-head impact from a pneumatically driven 50
g steel piston that was calibrated to deliver 0.5 to 0.8 J of kinetic energy at the point of impact. An
impact of 0.5 J energy was defined as the low threshold for producing CHIMERA-delivered mild
brain injury in a previous dose-response study (56). In the repeated mTBI experiment, mice
received two successive 0.5 J impacts spaced 24 h apart. The sham group underwent all procedures
except for the impact. For receiving head injury, the animal was placed in a supine position in the
holding bed with the top of its head placed flat over a hole in the head plate. The top of the animal’s
head was aligned using crosshairs so that the piston strikes a circular area with a radius of 2.5 mm
surrounding the bregma on the vertex of the head. In the control experiment to distinguish between
the local and systemic effect of CHIMERA-delivered impact (see Figure S2), animals were held
in place such that the animal’s back or one ear was positioned over the hole of the head plate to
receive the piston-delivered impact.
Administration of CtBP inhibitors.
Preparation of the PLDLS-containing Pep1-E1A and the PLDLS-to-PLDEL mutant (Pep1-E1AMut)
peptides were as previously described (41). Peptides (6 mg/mL) and MTOB sodium salt (Sigma,

K6000; 425 mg/mL) were dissolved in water. NSC95397 (Sigma, N1786; 5 mg/mL) was dissolved
in DMSO. The stock solutions were diluted in PBS solution (vehicle) to desired final
concentrations freshly before use. Pep1-E1A was delivered at 2 mg/kg dosage, 4-methylthio-2oxobutyric acid (MTOB) sodium salt at 860 mg/kg and NSC95397 at 0.75 or 1.5 mg/kg with
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection.
Behavioral analyses.
The latency to righting reflex (a.k.a. loss of righting reflex, LRR), a surrogate measurement for
loss of consciousness after brain injury, is used as a behavioral indicator of injury severity (57).
The LRR duration was recorded as the time interval from the discontinuation of isoflurane
exposure until the animal spontaneously rights itself from a supine position (50). Post-traumatic
neurological impairments were evaluated using a 10-point neurological severity score (NSS)
paradigm, which evaluate mice in performance of ten tasks: circle exiting, seeking behavior, gait
pattern (monoparesis or hemiparesis) and paw grip, straight walk, startle reflex, beam (7 mm × 7
mm) balancing, beam walking on a flat surface of 3, 2 and 1 cm width, and round stick (5 mm in
diameter) balancing (58). One point is given for the lack of a tested reflex or the inability to perform
the task, with a maximal NSS of 10 points indicating the failure of all tasks.
Tissue collection, histology, and immunofluorescence.
Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane via a nose cone. Blood samples were collected by cardiac
puncture into EDTA-coated tube to prevent clotting. Leukocytes were collected by two rounds of
10-min incubation in a red blood cells lysis buffer (0.8% NH4Cl, 0.084% NaHCO3 and 0.037%
EDTA) followed by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 10 min, all at room temperature. The pelleted
white blood cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until RNA extraction. The
animals were transcardially perfused with ice-cold 0.8% NaCl solution for 4 to 5 min until the
liver is cleared of blood. Mouse brain was obtained by decapitation of the perfused animal. For
biochemical analyses, the brain was longitudinally hemisected, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at -80°C until RNA and protein extraction. For immunohistological analyses, mice were
perfused with PBS followed by 4% ice-cold paraformaldehyde-PBS solution for 5 min. Brain

tissue were post-fixed in 10% formalin-PBS for 48 h at 4°C, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned
coronally to 40-μm thickness. The primary antibodies used for immunofluorescence imaging were:
mouse anti-CtBP2 (1:200,BD, 612044), goat anti-CtBP2 (Santa Cruz, sc-5966, 1:100), rabbit antiIba1(GeneTex, GTX100042, 1:200), rabbit anti-GFAP (Abcam, AB7260, 1:1000), mouse antiNeuN (GeneTex, GTX30773, 1:100). Secondary antibodies used were IgG conjugated to Alexa
Flour 594 or 488 (1:500, Invitrogen), biotin-labeled IgG (1:300, Vector lab), Streptavidin
conjugated to Alexa Flour 594 or 488 (1:2000, Life Technology, S11227 and S11223). Mouse on
Mouse (MOM) Detection kit (Vector Laboratories, BMK-2202) were used to reduce endogenous
mouse Ig straining when using mouse primary antibodies on mouse tissues. All slides were
counterstained with DAPI to visualize the nuclei.
Cell transfection and LPS treatment
The mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC, VA, USA). The mouse microglial BV2 cell line was a kind gift from Dr. Manisha Patel
(University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus). Both cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's
modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Corning 10017CV) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS, GEMINI, 100-500) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Corning, 30002CI) at 37°C with
5% CO2.
Cell transfection was carried out in 24-well plates as described (59). Briefly, RAW264.7 and
BV2 cells under approximately 80% confluence were treated with 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (Corning,
25-053-CI) and then transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, 11668019) in suspension
with siRNAs specific to mouse CtBP1 (UCUUCCACAGUGUGACUGCGUUAUUUU, 50 nM),
CtBP2 (GCCUUUGGAUUCAGCGUCAUAUUU, 50 nM), or both (25 nM each). The transfected
cells were incubated in DMEM for 24 h, followed by treatment with 200 ng/mL LPS (SigmaAldrich, L3880) for 6 h, and harvested for RNA extraction.
Primary microglia and astrocyte cultures and treatment with peptide and LPS
Mouse primary microglia and astrocytes were isolated from cerebral cortices of neonatal pups (P0
to P2-d-old) and cultured as described (60, 61), with minor modifications. The isolated cortices

were washed with ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 1 × minimum essential medium (MEM)
non-essential amino acids (Corning, 25025CL). Single cell suspension was made by pipetting up
and down through a sterile 10 ml pipette ten times followed by passing through a 18G needle three
times. The mixed cortical cells were passed through a nylon mesh cell strainer with 70-μm pores
and plated on an uncoated T75 flask in DMEM (Corning, 10013CV) with 10% FBS (Gemini,
100-500). After the mixed glial culture reached confluency at 10 to 14 d post-plating, microglia
were detached using an orbital shaker (220 rpm, 1 h), collected and re-plated in DMEM with 15%
FBS. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells were removed by further shaking at 220 rpm for 6 h. The
remaining astrocyte layer were detached by trypsin digestion and re-plated in DMEM with 10%
FBS. The primary microglia and astrocyte cultures were >90% pure based on immunofluorescence
imaging with antibodies specific to Iba1 and GFAP, respectively.
Cultured primary microglia or astrocytes were incubated with 20 µM Pep1-E1A or Pep1E1AMut for 2 h before the addition of 200 ng/mL LPS (Sigma-Aldrich, L3880). Cells were
harvested 2 h after LPS treatment for RNA extraction. Anti-FLAG immunofluorescence staining
was performed to monitor cellular internalization of the peptides as described (41).
Reverse Transcription and Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR).
Total RNA was extracted from freshly harvested cells or frozen tissues using TRIzolTM reagent
(Invitrogen, 15596026) and analyzed by RT-qPCR. First-strand cDNA was reverse transcribed
from 1.0 µg total RNA with oligo (dT) primers using Verso cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo
Scientific, AB1453A). Quantitative PCR with SYBR green detection (Applied Biosystems,
A25741) was performed using 1% of the reversely transcribed cDNA mixture on a BioRad
CFX96 real-time detection system. Relative expression of individual genes were normalized to
ACTB (β-Actin) expression using the 2−DDCt method (62). The sequences of all RT-qPCR primers
were provided in Supplementary Table 1.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP).
ChIP experiments were carried out as described (63) with modifications. In brief, cells were crosslinked with 1% (w/v) formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. The cross-linking was

quenched with 0.125 M glycine for 5 min. About 1 × 108 cross-linked cells were lysed by
sonication for 15 × 30 s with 30 s break on ice in 10 mL lysis buffer (0.1% SDS, 0.5% Triton X100, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-pH 8.1, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM EDTA, and with protease inhibitor
cocktail freshly added before use; Roche, 11836153001). After centrifugation at 19,000 × g for
15 min, the supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation with 1/100 of the lysate (100 µL) set
aside as the input sample. The remaining lysate were split into four equal parts and incubated with
each antibody (mouse anti-CtBP1, BD Biosciences, 612042; mouse anti-CtBP2, BD Biosciences,
612044; mouse anti-p300 Santa Cruz, sc-48343; and mouse IgG1, Santa Cruz, sc-69786) overnight
with rotation at 4°C. Protein A beads (RepliGen, 10-1003-03) were added to the lysate with
rotation at 4°C for 4 h. The beads were washed 5 × 5 min with the lysis buffer. The precipitated
DNA-protein complex was eluted into 300 µL 1 mM NaHCO3 and 1% SDS by incubation at 65°C
for 15 min. After centrifugation at 19,000 × g for 1 min, the supernatant was transferred to fresh
tubes, followed by supplementation with 5 M NaCl to a final concentration of 300 mM and
incubation at 65°C overnight to reverse the cross-linking. Protein and SDS of both input and IP
samples were removed through phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The DNA
of input and ChIP samples was resuspended in 100 µL and 400 µL H2O, respectively. For qPCR,
1.5 µL from each sample was used. For each antibody, relative ChIP signal was calculated as
percent of input using the 2−DDCt method (62) and the ChIP signal of the LPS-stimulated cells were
normalized to that of the non-stimulated control. The sequences of all ChIP-qPCR primers were
provided in Supplemental Table 1.
Western Blotting.
Protein extracts were prepared from longitudinally halved mouse brain (~200 mg) in 500
µL homogenization buffer consisting of 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM
EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 1 × complete
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, 11836153001). Debris were removed by centrifugation at
18,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant fraction was quantified through use of the Bradford
assay (Bio-Rad, 5000006). For each sample, 50 µg of total protein extracts was resolved by 12%

SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane for immunodetection. Membrane were
incubated with antibodies specific to CtBP1 (BD Biosciences, 612042, 1:1,000), CtBP2 (BD
Biosciences, 612044, 1:1,000), S100A9 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-58706, 1:1,000),
NLRP3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 134306, 1:1,000) and GAPDH (Sigma, G8795, 1:5,000) at
4°C overnight, followed by peroxidase-labeled appropriate secondary antibodies at room
temperature for 1 h. The membrane was developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence
substrate (Millipore Corporation, WBKLS0500) and scanned with a ChemiDoc MP imager (BioRad). Raw signal intensity for each band was measured using Image J software (4.0.1 version).
Statistical Analysis
Plots were made and statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 8.0
(GraphPad Software). Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). In cell culture
experiments the ‘n’ values denote the number of experiments. Each independent experiment
contained triplicate cultured wells.
