Abstract
The regulation of cell cycle progression and differentiation in retinal progenitor cells is a
fundamental feature controlling organ size of the eye in vertebrates. Nance-Horan
Syndrome (NHS) is a rare X-linked disorder caused by mutations in the NHS gene.
Dysmorphic features of NHS include severe congenital cataracts, micropthalmia, facial
dysmorphisms, and visual impairment. In this study we report an evolutionarily
conserved role for NHS in vertebrate retinogenesis. Loss of function of nhs leads to
small eye size in both zebrafish and Xenopus tropicalis, marked by reduced proliferation
but not cell death. Transcriptome analysis of nhs morphant zebrafish eyes revealed a
marked upregulation in Δ113p53, an isoform of p53, concomitant with a selective
upregulation of p53 responsive genes that inhibit cell cycle progression but not
apoptosis. Our data supports a model where Nhs is a negative regulator of Δ113p53
expression and exerts its function through regulation of the p53 pathway to promote
expansive growth of retinal progenitor cells prior to differentiation.

Introduction:
A fundamental question in biology is how organ size is controlled during
development. Organogenesis is regulated by a balance between progenitor cell cycle
progression, self-renewal, differentiation, and programmed cell death. The neural retina
serves as a model system that illustrates this general concept. The retina develops as
an outpouching of the neuroepithelium and grows through symmetric proliferative
divisions of retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) followed by a switch to asymmetric
neurogenic divisions (Fadool and Dowling 2008; Willardsen and Link 2011; He et al.
2012; Boije et al. 2014). In the zebrafish retina, early RPCs undergoing symmetric cell
divisions progress through the cell cycle slowly but then switch to a rapidly proliferating
phase in which the cell cycle duration markedly decreases (Hu and Easter 1999; Li et
al. 2000; He et al. 2012). This serves to rapidly increase the progenitor pool in advance
of asymmetric neurogenic divisions in which some daughter cells exit the cell cycle to
differentiate into neurons (He et al. 2012). Thus, coordinated cell proliferation and
differentiation result in the correct number of cells that collectively contribute to the
volume and size of the retina (Joseph and Hermanson 2010; Hindley and Philpott
2012). However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate cell cycle progression in
retinal progenitor cells are not completely understood (He et al. 2012; Boije et al. 2014).

found at the distal end of the X chromosome. The most frequent mutations associated
with NHS are nonsense mutations predicted to result in a truncated protein (Burdon et
al. 2003; Ramprasad et al. 2005; Florijn et al. 2006; Huang et al. 2007; Sharma et al.
2008; Coccia et al. 2009; Chograni et al. 2011; Tug et al. 2013; Hong et al. 2014;
Shoshany et al. 2017; Tian et al. 2017), but insertions, small deletions, and a missense
mutations have also been reported (Accogli et al., 2017; Brooks et al., 2004; Burdon et
al., 2003; Chograni et al., 2011; Florijn et al., 2006; Li et al., 2015). Affected males have
severe bilateral congenital dense nuclear cataracts that lead to profound vision loss and
usually require surgery at an early age (Burdon et al. 2003; Huang et al. 2007; Sharma
et al. 2008; Coccia et al. 2009). Despite cataract surgery during infancy, many NHS
patients continue to exhibit visual impairment that may be caused by an underlying
retinopathy (Mathys et al. 2007; Ding et al. 2009). It has been demonstrated that NHS
protein is expressed in midbrain, lens, tooth and retina (Burdon et al. 2003; Sharma et
al. 2006).
The p53 tumor suppressor protein has an established role as a cellular stress
sensor, responding to a variety of insults such as DNA damage, nutrient starvation,
nucleolar and ribosomal stress, and hypoxia (Vousden and Lane 2007; McCubrey et al.
2017). Evidence suggests that p53 functions to arrest cell cycle progression allowing
time for DNA repair machineries to restore genome integrity before replication. If
deleterious conditions are too severe, p53 activates cell death pathways. p53 performs
many of its functions though downstream transcriptional activation of target genes, such

as cdkn1a/p21CIP1/WAF1 (p21) to halt cell cycle at the G1 phase and bax to execute
programmed cell death pathways (Vogelstein et al. 2000; Harris and Levine 2005).
In addition to the full-length p53 protein, the p53 gene locus encodes for several
isoforms generated by alternative promoter usage or alternative spicing (Bourdon et al.
2005; Joruiz and Bourdon 2016). A prominent variant Δ133p53 in humans is transcribed
from an internal promoter in intron 4 and is evolutionarily conserved in zebrafish (termed
Δ113p53), suggesting an important role in p53 functions (Bourdon et al. 2005; Chen et
al. 2005). Δ113p53 encodes an N-terminally truncated protein with a deletion of the
transactivation domains and a partial deletion of the DNA-binding domain (Bourdon et
al. 2005; Chen et al. 2005; Chen and Peng 2009). ∆113p53 is itself a p53 target gene
that is strongly upregulated following DNA damage, due to binding of full-length p53 to
p53 response elements within intron4 of the p53 locus (Bourdon et al. 2005; Chen et al.
2005; Marcel et al. 2010; Aoubala et al. 2011). Previous work showed that ∆113p53
functions to protect cells from apoptosis by differentially modulating p53 response
genes, promoting the expression of cell cycle arrest genes while antagonizing p53regulated apoptotic activity (Chen et al. 2009; Aoubala et al. 2011; Ou et al. 2014).
Thus, the ∆113p53/∆133p53 variants function evolutionarily to promote cell survival
when genome integrity is compromised to allow for DNA repair to take place (Gong et
al. 2015).
Although p53 has a well-established role in maintaining genome stability to
prevent tumor progression, a role for the p53 pathway in regulating development and
organogenesis is less well understood. Loss-of-function mutations in p53 at first

appeared to result mostly in viable offspring with no obvious developmental defects
(Donehower et al. 1992). However, a number of p53 mutant mice die in utero due to
exencephaly, a defect in neural tube closure due to overgrowth of neural progenitors in
the midbrain, due at least in part to decreased apoptosis of neural progenitors (Sah et
al., 1995). On the other hand, unrestrained activity of p53 can inappropriately induce
p53 target genes and trigger cell cycle arrest and/or cell death during development
(Jacobs et al. 2004; Dugani et al. 2009). For instance, loss of mdm2 or mdm4, negative
regulators of the p53 protein, cause early embryonic lethality in a p53-dependent
manner (Marine et al. 2006). More modest levels of p53 activation are associated with
defects similar to those seen in patients with CHARGE syndrome (Van Nostrand et al.
2014). Recent work in zebrafish identified digestive organ expansion factor (def) as a
pan-endodermal-enriched factor that is essential for expansive growth of digestive
organs (Chen et al. 2005). Analysis of def null mutants revealed a selective regulation of
the p53 isoform Δ113p53, that contributed to cell cycle arrest leading to reduced size
and defective digestive organ development (Chen et al. 2005, 2009).
Here, we report a role for NHS in the development of the vertebrate retina.
Knockdown of nhs in zebrafish and frog resulted in a reduced eye size. We show the
small retinal size caused by nhs deficiency is due a decrease in RPC proliferation. The
small retina, caused by nhs deficiency, is due a proliferation restriction mediated by the
elevated expression of Δ113p53. We hypothesize that nhs functions in RPCs to limit
p53 pathway induction as neural progenitors undergo rapid cell division.

RESULTS
The NHS family of genes
The Nance-Horan Syndrome family of genes is conserved among vertebrates
including humans, mice, frogs, and zebrafish. Members of the NHS gene family include
the prototypical NHS, as well as NHS-like 1 (NHSL1) and NHS-like 2 (NHSL2). The
NHS genes are orthologs of the Drosophila gene GUK-holder (gukh)(Katoh and Katoh
2004)(Fig. 1A). Although most vertebrates express three NHS paralogs, (NHS, NHSL1
and NHSL2), zebrafish have two copies of each paralog (nhsa, nhsb, nhsl1a, nhsl1b,
nhsl2a, and nhsl2b) due to a genome duplication event in the teleost lineage
(Postlethwait et al. 1998, 2000)(Fig. 1A).
In this study, we focused only on NHS orthologs. Previously, it was noted that the
human NHS gene encompassed an unusually long distance between exon1 and exon2
(Brooks et al. 2004, 2010b). Comparison of other vertebrate genomes showed that the
genomic architecture of the NHS gene remained conserved among human, mouse, frog
and zebrafish with comparable number of exons. The large distance between exon1
and exon2 of NHS was also detected in other vertebrate genomes (Fig. 1B). The human
NHS gene generates multiple protein isoforms by virtue of alternative promoter usage
and alternative splicing (Huang et al. 2006; Brooks et al. 2010a). Isoforms arising from
the alternative translational start site in exon1a appear to be evolutionarily conserved
across vertebrates, as evidenced by sequencing of expressed sequence tags (EST)
libraries (Fig. 1B). However, only NHS isoforms encoded from the first translational start

site in exon1 are predicted to be essential for development, since nonsense mutations
in exon1 in humans leads to NHS (Burdon et al. 2003; Brooks et al. 2004).
We examined the temporal expression pattern of nhs paralogs during zebrafish
development and find that both nhsa and nhsb are present in embryos before 2 hours
post fertilization (hpf), suggesting that both transcripts are loaded maternally (Fig. 1C).
We find that both nhs paralogs are expressed through all stages of development (Fig.
1C).

Zebrafish nhsb is expressed in the developing eye and is required for normal
retinogenesis
To determine the role of NHS in zebrafish development, we first examined the
nhsafh298 mutants generated by Tilling (Draper et al. 2004). nhsafh298 carries a truncating

nonsense mutation at position Q217* (C4524T) (Fig. 1B). Examination of embryos
derived from an incross of nhsafh298/+ heterozygotes revealed no discernable
morphological differences among siblings, suggesting that nhsa is dispensable for early
development (Fig. S1).
We therefore decided to focus our efforts on zebrafish nhsb during
embryogenesis. Using in situ hybridization, we found expression of nhsb in the eye
during key stages of retinogenesis. Expression of nhsb was seen within proliferating
retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) and in the lens at 24 hpf (Fig. 2A). By 48 hpf and 72 hpf,
nhsb expression was downregulated in proliferating RPCs and not found in the ciliary
marginal zone (CMZ). Instead, nhsb expression was detected in differentiated cells
outside of the CMZ, with staining present in the retinal ganglion cell layer and inner
plexiform layer of the retina (Fig. 2B-D).
We next examined a role for nhsb in zebrafish embryo development. To
accomplish this, we designed splice-blocking antisense morpholino oligonucleotides
(MO) to the exon2-intron2 boundary of the nhsb gene (nhsb MO1) (Fig. 1B). We found
that nhsb MO1-injected embryos initially look indistinguishable from control embryos
until 24 hpf, suggesting that knockdown of nhsb does not affect early development, eye
field specification and/or separation. By 72 hpf, we observed a striking difference in the
size and shape of the retina in nhsb morphants as compared to controls (Fig. 2E-H).
nhsb morphants exhibited a small retina located on top of the lens (Fig. 2H). We did not
observe any lens defects in nhsb MO1-injected embryos that were reminiscent of
cataracts as observed in humans with Nance-Horan Syndrome (Burdon et al. 2003;

Brooks et al. 2004; Sharma et al. 2008; Coccia et al. 2009). We confirmed that injection
of nhsb MO1 caused a mis-splicing of the nhsb transcript leading to retention of intron2
(Fig. S2). To ensure that the small eye phenotype was specific to knockdown of nhsb,
we injected a second splice-blocking nhsb MO (nhsb MO2), targeted to the intron2exon3 (I2E3) boundary (Fig. 1B). We found that nhsb MO2-injected embryos exhibited
the same phenotype as that observed with nhsb MO1 (hereafter referred to as nhsb
MO) (Fig. S3).
To further test whether the small eye phenotype was specific to disruptions in the
nhsb gene, we used CRIPSR/Cas9 to generate insertion/deletion (indel) mutations at
the nhsb locus. We designed a single-stranded guide RNA (gRNA) to target exon1 of
the nhsb gene (Fig 1B). It was previously reported that injection of increasing amounts
of gRNA can lead to bi-allelic disruptions in the targeted gene (Jao et al. 2013). We
found that co-injection of nhsbex1 gRNA and Cas9 mRNA into one-cell stage embryos
led to growth defects in the eye of injected founder (F0) embryos (14%, n = 245), similar
to that seen in nhsb morphants (Fig 2I,J). We chose five injected embryos displaying
the small eye phenotype and validated indel mutations at the nhsb locus using a T7
endonuclease I (T7E1) assay; all assayed embryos showed high mutagenesis rates at
the nhsb locus (Fig. S4). Taken together, our results demonstrate that the nhsb gene is
expressed in the retina during key stages of retinogenesis, and that loss-of-function of
nhsb leads to reduced retinal size in zebrafish.

tropicalis because they are diploid and possess only one nhs gene. First, we made antisense in situ hybridization probes against the Xenopus tropicalis nhs gene (Fig. 1B).

Similar to zebrafish nhsb, the expression of nhs was detected in the retinal progenitor
cells and lens of Xenopus tropicalis eyes at embryonic stage 31 (Fig. 3A). As
retinogenesis proceeded, nhs expression in RPCs faded and was found concentrated in
the plexiform layers of the retina (Fig. 3A-D).
To determine whether the role of Nhs in retina development was evolutionarily
conserved among vertebrates, we designed splice-blocking MOs targeting the exon3intron3 boundary of Xenopus tropicalis nhs (nhs MO). We co-injected nhs MO along
with rhodamine-dextran into one cell of a two-cell stage embryo. This experimental
approach provided us with an internal control, since only half the embryo received nhs
MO. We found that 96% of embryos (n = 56) injected with nhs MO had small retinas as
compared to eyes on the contralateral side that did not receive morpholino (Fig. 3E-H).
The efficacy of knockdown by the nhs MO in Xenopus was validated by RT-PCR (Fig.
S5). These findings suggest that the role of NHS in retinal development is evolutionarily
conserved since knockdown of nhs in frog and knockdown of nhsb in zebrafish results
in a similar small eye phenotype. Taken together, the expression and function of Nhs
during key stages of retinogenesis is conserved between Xenopus tropicalis and Danio
rerio.

Nhs is required for proliferative growth of RPCs in the retina.
To further investigate the function of Nhs in retinal development we performed
the rest of our analysis on zebrafish nhsb morphants. The earliest manifestation of the
reduced eye size in nhsb morphants occurred between 24hpf - 48 hpf. This corresponds
to the period of rapid RPC proliferation followed by neurogenesis and differentiation (He
et al. 2012). To determine whether the reduced eye size was due to an increase in RPC
cell death, we analyzed wild-type and nhsb morphant retinas for apoptotic cells. We

evaluated cell death using an anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody, a marker of apopotic
cell death. We found virtually no dying cells in the retinas of either wild-type (0.187%
(4/2137 cells, n = 6 embryos) or nhsb-deficient embryos (0.140%; 2/1427 cells, n = 6
embryos) at 36 hpf (Fig. 4A,B). Furthermore, nhsb morphant retinas did not display
pyknotic morphology characteristic of dying cells (Fig. 4A,B). These results imply that
the reduced eye size observed in nhsb-depleted embryos was not due to an increase in
cell death.
To determine whether the small eye phenotype observed in nhsb morphants was
due to a defect in RPC proliferation, we analyzed cryosections stained with phosphohistone 3 (PH3) antibody, a marker of M-phase of the cell cycle. At 24 hpf, a timepoint in
which no morphological difference in eye size was observed, we found no significant
difference in the proportion of PH3-positive cells in nhsb morphants compared to wildtype embryos (wt, 0.43 ± 0.05%, n = 538 cells, 4 embryos; nhsb MO, 0.51 ± 0.04%, n
=745 cells, 5 embryos)(Fig. 4B-I). At 48 hpf, however, the number of cells at M-phase
was significantly fewer in the retina of nhsb morphants (0.92 ± 0.08%, n = 655 cells, 4
embryos) compared to wild-type (1.98 ± 0.18%, n = 2218 cells, 4 embryos) embryos (p
< 0.05)(Fig. 4B-I). This suggests that reduced proliferation of RPCs may contribute to
the lack of eye growth in the absence of nhsb function.

We next sought to determine whether differentiation of RPCs into neurons was
affected by loss of nhsb. To accomplish this, we made use of TgBAC(neurod1:EGFP)
transgenic zebrafish that expresses GFP under control of the promoter for neuroD
(Thomas et al. 2012). This transgene is not expressed in proliferating RPCs, but is
expressed in a subset of retinal neurons undergoing differentiation (Thomas et al.
2012). Some of the first differentiating neurons identified with this transgenic line can be
seen around 34 hpf (Fig. 5A-C). Many GFP-positive neurons are present in the retina of
wild-type embryos at this timepoint, and this number increased by 48 hpf (Fig. 4G-I). In
contrast, by 34 hpf, no GFP-positive neurons are observed in nhsb morphants (Fig. 4DF). By 48 hpf, however, a few GFP-expressing neurons can be visualized in nhsb
morphant retinas (Fig. 4J-L), suggesting that the differentiation of neurons from RPCs is

not blocked but is delayed in nhsb-depleted embryos. These findings are consistent with
the idea that nhsb knockdown mainly affects expansive growth of RPCs but does not
inhibit neuronal differentiation.

Loss of nhsb leads to a marked upregulation of Δ113p53 and p21, but not fulllength p53
To gain insight into the downstream function of Nhsb, we compared retinal
expression profiles between wild-type and nhsb morphants. Total RNA was isolated
from 40 zebrafish eyes dissected from wild-type and nhsb morphant embryos at 48 hpf
for microarray analysis using Affymetrix zebrafish GeneChips. We used SAM analysis
and found 1,212 significant genes that were differentially expressed in wild-type eyes
compared to nhsb morphant eyes (Table S2A,B).
A subset of genes with significantly higher expression in nhsb-depleted eyes
included genes that are markers of RPC identity such as mz98/col15a1b (collagen
typeXV, alpha 1b), ccnd1 (cyclin D1), dlc (deltaC), and pold1 (DNA polymerase delta 1).
(Fig. 6A). We also found a subset of genes whose expression was reduced in nhsb
morphants compared to control, including markers of differentiated neurons such as
neuroD,

opn1sw1

(opsin1

short-wave-sensitive

1),

rho

(rhodopsin),

calb2a

(calbindin2a), snap25a (synaptosomal-associated protein, 25a) (Fig. 6A). These
findings are consistent with the idea that RPCs in nhsb morphant retinas proliferate
slower, maintaining their identity as RPCs with delayed neuronal differentiation.
Surprisingly, functional annotation analysis using the Database for Annotation,
Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) identified a number of genes that were
differentially expressed between wild-type and nhsb-depleted retinas with known roles
in the regulation of cell cycle progression, including the tumor-suppressor gene tp53

and its target gene mdm2 (Fig. 6A). This suggests that loss of nhsb may regulate cell
cycle progression through the p53 pathway.
To validate our microarray results, we performed semi-quantitative RT-PCR,
using RNA extracted from dissected retinas of wild-type and nhsb morphants. We found
that the levels of full-length p53 transcripts were unchanged in nhsb morphants
compared to wildtype controls, a result that differed from our microarray expression
analysis (Fig. 6B). Whereas the microarray probe binds to the C-terminal tp53 coding
region, our RT-PCR primers amplify N-terminal tp53 coding region from exon1 to exon4
(Table S1). However, using primers that specifically amplify the truncated Δ113p53
transcript, we found a marked up-regulation of Δ113p53 expression in nhsb morphant
eyes compared to wild-type controls (Fig. 6B). Our results demonstrate that the
elevated p53 transcripts detected by the Affymetrix probe, directed against the Cterminal coding region of p53, is due to the upregulation of the N-terminal truncated p53
variant Δ113p53, but not full-length p53.
We next asked whether other p53 target genes were affected by nhsb depletion.
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR results showed that additional p53 target genes were upregulated in nhsb morphant eyes compared to wild-type eyes, including mdm2, ccng1
(cyclinG1), and cdkn1a/p21WAF1/CIP-1 (p21), a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor that
blocks the G1-to-S-phase transition (Cazzalini et al. 2010)(Fig. 5B). On the other hand,
expression levels of the pro-apoptotic factor bax did not show apparent differences
between nhsb morphants and control eyes (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these data are
consistent with our histological data that the reduced eye size in nhsb morphants is not

Knockdown of p53, reduces Δ113p53 and p21, and rescues the nhsb morphant
phenotype
Previous data from Chen and colleagues demonstrated that the induction of
Δ113p53 was p53-dependent (Chen et al. 2009). Our data suggest that nhsb may be a
negative regulator of Δ113p53 expression. Since Δ113p53 is itself a transcriptional

target of full-length p53 that binds to promoter elements in intron 4 (Chen et al. 2009),
we reasoned that the small-eye phenotype seen in nhsb morphants may be rescued by
knock-down of full-length p53. To determine whether full-length p53 is required for the
elevated levels of Δ113p53 caused by nhsb depletion, we co-injected nhsb MO2 with
p53 MOATG that specifically targets the translation start site of the full-length p53 protein
(Robu et al. 2007). We found that co-injection of nhsb MO and p53 MOATG rescued the
small eye phenotype caused by injection of nhsb MO alone. (Fig. 7A). Splice blocking
efficiency and knockdown of nhsb was confirmed by RT-PCR (Fig. S6) and phenotypes
quantified (Fig. S7). Interestingly, co-injection of nhsb MO and p53 MOATG led to a
reduced expression of Δ113p53 and p21 transcripts, compared to nhsb MO alone (Fig.
6B). Our findings indicate that the upregulation of Δ113p53 and p21 in nhsb-depleted
retina is dependent on full length p53, consistent with the notion that Δ113p53 and p21
are p53 target genes (Chen et al. 2009). Overall this result suggests that the
proliferation restriction enforced on RPCs was alleviated when levels of Δ113p53 and
p21 were reduced.
It was previously reported that Δ113p53 antagonizes the apoptotic activities of
p53 (Chen and Peng 2005; Chen et al. 2009), thereby promoting cell survival. To
determine whether expression of Δ113p53 variant is required for cell survival in nhsb
morphants, we designed a second morpholino targeting the splicing site of the Δ113p53
transcript at the exon ES - intron 4 splice junction (Δ113p53 splMO). The activity of
Δ113p53 splMO is predicted to affect splicing of the Δ113p53 transcript, but not fulllength p53 transcripts. Injection of either p53 MOATG or Δ113p53 splMO alone had no

discernable effect on retinal development (data not shown). However, embryos coinjected with nhsb MO and Δ113p53 splMO resulted in embryonic death, indicative of
an increase in p53-mediated apoptosis when Δ113p53 transcripts are absent.
Taken together, these results demonstrate that the upregulation of Δ113p53
protects retinal progenitors from undergoing cell death in nhsb knockdown embryos,
while imposing a proliferation restriction in a manner that likely involves other p53 target
genes, such as the cell cycle inhibitor p21. Our data supports a model where nhsb is a
negative regulator of Δ113p53 expression and exerts its function in development though
regulation of the p53 pathway.

Discussion
The vertebrate retina develops from a small pool of retinal progenitor cells (RPCs)
comprising the optic cup. Just prior to the onset of retinal neurogenesis, RPCs undergo
cycles of rapid self-replication to expand the tissue (Agathocleous and Harris 2009; He
et al. 2012). The proliferative capacity of RPC’s are diminished when key transcription
factors like Rx1, Pax6, Chx10, and Sox2 are inhibited, whereas activation of these
transcription factors often lads to increased mitosis and a larger retina (Marquardt et al.
2001; Green et al. 2003; Philips et al. 2005; Van Raay et al. 2005; Taranova et al. 2006;
Zaghloul and Moody 2007; Oron-Karni et al. 2008). Temporal expression of bHLH
proteins like neurogenin 2 (Ngn2), atonal homolog 5 (ATH5) and NeuroD trigger cell
cycle exit to initiate specification and differentiation in a highly coordinated manner
(Agathocleous and Harris 2009). Extrinsic signals from the retina microenvironment also
affects division and differentiation of RPCs. Ligands like Sonic Hedgehog (Shh)
promotes rapid proliferation of RPCs by shortening cell cycle length through the
activation of G1 and G2 phase cyclins (Wang et al. 2005; Locker et al. 2006;
Agathocleous et al. 2007). It has been proposed that Shh stimulates the transition of
early RPC from slow cycling to faster cycling in advance of terminal differentiation
(Locker et al. 2006; Agathocleous et al. 2007). Our results demonstrate that knockdown
of Nhs in zebrafish and Xenopus leads to a reduction in proliferation of RPCs before the
onset of differentiation. We propose that loss of Nhs function leads to an increase in cell
cycle length that may be due to the elevated levels of cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitors, such as p21, as a result of p53 pathway activation. Our results show that

Nhs-depletion does not inhibit, but rather delays the differentiation of RPCs. Although
differentiation proceeds, it remains unclear whether loss of Nhs function affects the
differentiation of RPCs into all possible cell types in the retina. Nevertheless, our
findings indicate Nhs regulates overall retinal size by promoting the faster cycling of
RPCs associated with the expansion of the RPC population in advance of terminal
differentiation.
Although it is clear that the p53 tumor suppressor plays important roles in cancer
progression, a role for p53 (or any or the p53 isoforms) in embryonic development or
development of the nervous system is less clear. p53 acts primarily as a transcription
factor, although it has been shown to have a cytoplasmic roles (Vousden 2006; Endo et
al. 2008). In response to DNA damage or other cellular stresses, there are two main
outcomes of p53 activation, namely cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. In the nervous
system, p53 plays a key role, along with other p53 family members, p63 and p73, in
regulating survival and apoptosis in the developing and adult nervous system (Miller et
al. 2000; Jacobs et al. 2004). p53 becomes a major pro-apoptotic proteins eliciting
naturally occurring cell death in peripheral neurons (Aloyz et al. 1998; Jacobs et al.
2005)and neural progenitor cells (Dugani et al. 2009; Fatt et al. 2014). Consistent with
this, mice deficient in DNA ligase 4 (Lig4) or XRCC4, two components of the
nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway that repairs double-stranded DNA breaks,
exhibit neuronal apoptosis that has been shown to be p53-dependent (Frank et al.
1998; Gao et al. 1998). A screen of zebrafish mutants harboring mutations various
categories of cell essential genes, such as DNA replication, transcription, telomere

maintenance, ribosome biogenesis, splicing, chaperoning, endocytosis, and cellular
transport, all share an upregulation of p53 and excessive neural apoptosis (Danilova et
al. 2010). Activation of the p53 pathway then is likely responsible for a wide range of
defects seen in human congenital disorders (Mendrysa et al. 2011).
Few studies, however, have investigated the role of p53 isoforms, such as
Δ113p53/Δ113p53, in embryonic development. The zebrafish protein Δ113p53, and its
human counterpart, Δ133p53, are N-terminally truncated forms of p53 that are missing
the transactivation domain, and MDM2-interacting motif, with a partial deletion of the
DNA-binding domain (Bourdon et al. 2005; Chen et al. 2005, 2009). Transcriptional
expression of Δ113p53/Δ133p53 is initiated by an alternative p53 promoter in intron 4
that is completely dependent on full length p53 protein (Bourdon et al. 2005; Chen et al.
2009; Aoubala et al. 2011). Δ113p53/Δ133p53 is strongly induced by DNA double
strand breaks, where it antagonizes p53-mediated apoptosis(Gong et al. 2015).
Previous work had shown that Δ113p53 does not act in a dominant-negative fashion,
but by differentially modulating p53 target gene activation to protect cells from apoptosis
(Chen et al. 2009; Ou et al. 2014). In zebrafish, Δ113p53 was identified in the analysis
of a zebrafish mutant def, a pan-endodermal-enriched factor that is essential for the
expansive growth of digestive organs (Chen et al. 2005). In def null mutants, Δ113p53
transcripts were upregulated and induced the expression of p53-responsive genes to
trigger arrest of cell cycle, but not apoptosis, leading to reduced organ growth (Chen et
al. 2005, 2009). We identified a similar role for nhsb in expansion growth of the retina. In
the absence of nhsb, Δ113p53 expression increased, which concomitant increase of the

p53 target gene p21. Increased levels of p21 enforced a proliferation restriction on
RPCs, while the pro-apoptotic gene bax was not increased in hypoplastic retinas. Our
findings are in agreement with the previously reported role for Δ113p53 as regulator of
p21, but not bax (Chen et al. 2005, 2009). These results suggest that i) Nhs is required
in retinal progenitor cells to keep levels of Δ113p53 low, and that ii) loss of nhs causes
a small retina due to cell cycle arrest, but not apoptosis. Indeed, when Δ113p53 were
depleted, loss of nhsb led to an increase in cell death.
How does Nhs regulate the Δ113p53 transcript levels? Our data suggest that
Nhs is a negative regulator of Δ113p53 expression. Nhs could regulate Δ113p53 levels
directly or indirectly through modulation of the p53 pathway. Our experiments indicate
full length p53 is required for the micropthalmia and Δ113p53 induction caused by nhsb
deficiency. However, we show that transcript levels of full-length p53 are unchanged in
nhsb morphants, suggesting that Nhs does not regulate p53 at the level of transcription.
One possibility is that Nhs regulates the steady state levels of p53 protein, and in the
absence of Nhs, p53 levels would accumulate and elevate expression of Δ113p53 and
p21. Alternatively, Nhs could limit the transcriptional activity of p53 without affecting
protein levels. It was recently reported that Def is a nucleolar protein that mediates p53
protein degradation through a proteasome-independent pathway (Tao et al. 2013).
Future studies will be aimed at uncovering the mechanism of how Nhs modulates the
p53 pathway.
Finally, our study uncovers a developmental role for Nhs that provides an
underlying mechanism for pathology associated with Nance-Horan Syndrome (NHS).

Affected males have severe bilateral congenital dense nuclear cataracts that lead to
profound vision loss and usually require surgery at an early age (Burdon et al. 2003;
Huang et al. 2007; Sharma et al. 2008; Coccia et al. 2009). Despite cataract surgery
during infancy, many NHS patients continue to exhibit visual impairment that may be
caused by an underlying retinopathy (Mathys et al. 2007; Ding et al. 2009). Our findings
that Nhs is essential for proper retinal development may clarify why NHS patients
continue to exhibit ocular abnormalities and vision loss, even when cataracts have been
corrected by surgery. NHS is caused predominantly by truncating (nonsense) mutations
in the NHS gene that have been found in each of the 8 exons. There is no apparent
clinical difference between mutations in C-terminal exons compared to N-terminal exons
(Tug et al. 2013). Previous reports have suggested that humans have at least three
isoforms of NHS transcripts generated by the use of alternative transcriptional start
sites, arising from exon1, exon1a, and exon1b (see Fig 1B). Transcripts encoded from
exon1 is known to be important in the pathogenesis of NHS, because patient nonsense
mutations identified in exon1 are only predicted to affect this isoform (Burdon et al.
2003; Brooks et al. 2004; Huang et al. 2006; Hong et al. 2014). This exon1 is
evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates. Our results

presented here using CRISPR

genome editing with guide RNAs directed against exon1 of the zebrafish nhsb gene
showed a similar micropthalmia compared with morpholino oligonucleotide-mediated
knockdown. These results are consistent with the human molecular genetics
demonstrating that NHS isoforms encoded from exon1 are relevant to the pathogenesis
of Nance-Horan Syndrome.

Illustra Probe-quant columns (GE Healthcare). The mix of gRNA (100ng/μL) and nlszCas9-nls mRNA (300 ng/μL) was injected into one-cell stage embryos.

T7 Endonuclease I Assay
Genomic DNA was prepared from whole embryos at 24 hpf. A short stretch of genomic
region (~735 bp) flanking the target site was PCR amplified from genomic DNA. PCR
product was denatured and slowly allowed to re-anneal to encourage heteroduplex
formation. The re-annealing procedure consisted of a 5 minute denaturation step,
followed by cooling to 85°C at -2°C per second and further to 25°C at a rate of -0.1°C
per second. The re-annealed amplicon was then digested with 20 units of T7
endonuclease I (New England Biolabs) at 37°C for 15 minutes. The reaction was
stopped by adding 1 μL of 0.5M EDTA. The sample was run through a 2% agarose gel
and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.

Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)
Splice-blocking MOs were validated by RT-PCR. Primers used to validate are listed in

RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and genomic contamination was eliminated by on-column DNA
digestion (Qiagen). First Strand cDNA was synthesized using the Protoscript M-MuLV

First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs). Equal concentrations of RNA
(1ug) from all developmental timepoints were used in the cDNA synthesis reaction.
Concentration of cDNA across developmental timepoints was validated using primers
specific to the ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) gene or elf1a. RNA extracted from retinas
were used to validate array data. For semiquantitative RT-PCR, the amount of template
and the number of PCR cycles were optimized to ensure that the reactions were in the
linear range of amplification. The primer pairs and detailed PCR conditions used to
amplify each of these genes are listed in Table S1.

Affymetrix Array
We dissected 40 eyes each from wildtype or nhsb MO2-injected embryos at 48hpf. This
experiment was performed in duplicate. Dissections were done in Half Ringers Solution
(2.2mM CaCl2, 5.6mM KCl, 154 mM NaCl, 2.4mM NaHCO3, 2 mM Tris-Cl, adjust to pH
7.4) on ice. Total RNA was extracted from pooled tissues using RNeasy kit (Qiagen)
and treated with DNAse I. We used 200ng input total RNA for cRNA amplification using
the Affymetrix One Cycle kit. Amplicons were fragmented, hybridized to GeneChip
Zebrafish Genome Arrays and scanned (Affymetrix). Quality control of total RNA,
amplified RNA, and fragmented RNA was checked using Experion (Bio-Rad). GeneChip
arrays were scanned on an Affymetrix Scanner 3000 7G scanner. Data was analyzed
by Affymetrix Expression Console software. Raw intensity data was exported and
filtered with a lower cut off value of 2 to assure that probe intensities data were
generated within the dynamic range of fluorescence. Data was normalized by Robust

uploaded into TMEV for Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) analysis. The
resulting 1,212 significant genes were entered into DAVID for further gene ontology

Immunostaining and Imaging
Embryos were fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C, incubated in 30% sucrose and
saturated in OCT (Tissue-Tec), frozen on cryostat stages prior to storage at -20°C.
Coronal sections of 10uM were cut on a cryostat and mounted to Colorfrost Plus,
microscope slides (Fisher). Immunostaining was performed on sections with the
following antibodies: anti-phosphohistone 3 (pH3) (1:1000 Cell Signaling); anti-GFP
(1:2000, Torrey Pines); cleaved caspase 3 (1:500) (Cell Signaling). Primary antibodies
were detected using secondary antibodies: goat anti-mouse Alexa 564 or goat antirabbit Alexa 488 (Life Technologies). Nuclei were labeled with Dapi. Sections were
mounted in 100% glycerol and coverslipped. Confocal images of labeled cryostat
sections or whole-mount embryos were obtained on a Carl Zeiss Spinning Disk Laser
Confocal Observer Z1 (VCU) using either 20X or 63X objectives.
