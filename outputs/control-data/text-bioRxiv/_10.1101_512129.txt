ABSTRACT

31	  

ER tubules and sheets conventionally correspond to smooth and rough ER, respectively.

32	  

The ratio of ER tubules-to-sheets varies in different cell types and changes in response

33	  

to cellular conditions, potentially impacting the functional output of the ER. To directly

34	  

test if ER morphology impacts ER function, we increased the tubule-to-sheet ratio by

35	  

Rtn4a overexpression and monitored effects on protein translation and trafficking. While

36	  

expression levels of several cell surface and secreted proteins were unchanged, their

37	  

exocytosis was increased. Rtn4a depletion reduced cell surface trafficking without

38	  

affecting ER morphology, and increasing the tubule-to-sheet ratio by other means did

39	  

not affect trafficking. These data suggest that Rtn4a enhances exocytosis independently

40	  

of changes in ER morphology. We demonstrate that Rtn4a enhances ER-to-Golgi

41	  

trafficking and co-localizes with COPII vesicles. We propose that Rtn4a promotes COPII

42	  

vesicle formation by inducing membrane curvature. Taken together, we show that

43	  

altering ER morphology does not necessarily affect protein synthesis or trafficking, but

44	  

that Rtn4a specifically enhances exocytosis.

INTRODUCTION
How organelle size and morphology affect organelle function is a fundamental

47	  
48	  

question in cell biology. In this study, we investigated how morphology of the

49	  

endoplasmic reticulum (ER) affects its functional output. The ER is an elaborate and

50	  

dynamic membrane bound organelle that is continuous with the nuclear envelope. The

51	  

ER network is composed of flat cisternae or sheets and arrays of highly curved tubules

52	  

interconnected by three-way junctions (Shibata et al., 2006; Urra and Hetz, 2012; Goyal

53	  

and Blackstone, 2013). Despite sharing a common luminal space, different ER domains

54	  

are associated with distinct functions. Flat ER sheets correspond to rough ER (RER),

55	  

accommodate large polyribosomes on their surface, and play major roles in protein

56	  

translation, folding, and modification. Smooth ER (SER) is composed of ER tubules that

57	  

generally exhibit low ribosome density because high membrane curvature disfavors

58	  

binding of polyribosomal structures (Shibata et al., 2006; Goyal and Blackstone, 2013).

59	  

Rather, ER tubules are involved in lipid synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, calcium

60	  

homeostasis, and interorganellar contacts (Park and Blackstone, 2010; Shibata et al.,

2010; Goyal and Blackstone, 2013). Discrete specialized domains of the SER termed

62	  

transitional ER (tER) or ER exit sites (ERES) represent sites of COPII coat assembly

63	  

and vesicle budding (Hughes and Stephens, 2008). Vesicles packed with cargo proteins

64	  

and lipids arise from ERES and traffic towards the Golgi apparatus through post-ER

65	  

structures known as pre-Golgi intermediates (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 2000; Hughes

66	  

et al., 2009).

67	  

Multiple proteins contribute to the unique structures characteristic of different ER

68	  

domains. ER tubules are curved by the Reticulon (Rtn) and DP1/REEP/Yop1p family of

69	  

proteins, all of which contain two tandem hydrophobic hairpin segments, termed

70	  

reticulon-homology domains (RHDs), thought to wedge into the outer leaflet of

71	  

phospholipid bilayers to induce membrane curvature (Voeltz et al., 2006; Shibata et al.,

72	  

2008; Goyal and Blackstone, 2013; Zhang and Hu, 2016). Although predominantly

73	  

localized to ER tubules, reticulons also occupy the curved edges of ER sheets (Shibata

74	  

et al., 2009; Shibata et al., 2010). There are four mammalian reticulon genes (RTN1,

75	  

RTN2, RTN3, and RTN4/Nogo) that can give rise to alternatively spliced transcripts

76	  

(Oertle and Schwab, 2003; Yang and Strittmatter, 2007). The C-terminal RHD is highly

77	  

conserved among all reticulons, while their N-termini exhibit little or no sequence

78	  

similarity (GrandPré et al., 2000). Rtn4a is the largest in the reticulon family and was

79	  

originally identified as an inhibitor of neurite outgrowth and axonal regeneration in the

80	  

central nervous system (Chen et al., 2000; GrandPré et al., 2000; Prinjha et al., 2000;

81	  

Oertle and Schwab, 2003; Yang and Strittmatter, 2007; Zurek et al., 2011; Di Sano et al.,

82	  

2012). While most reticulons, including Rtn4a and its shorter splice variants Rtn4b and

83	  

Rtn4c, are enriched in the nervous system, they are also ubiquitously expressed in all

84	  

tissues and localize to curved ER tubules and sheet edges (Chiurchiu et al., 2014;

85	  

Ramo et al., 2016). The flat regions of ER sheets are supported by coiled-coil domain

86	  

containing proteins, such as CLIMP-63, kinectin, and p-180. CLIMP-63 stabilizes a

87	  

constant sheet width of 50-100 nm in mammals by forming intraluminal bridges,

88	  

whereas p-180 and kinectin are thought to form rod-like structures on the surface of ER

89	  

sheets to promote flatness (Klopfenstein et al., 2001; Voeltz and Prinz, 2007; Lin et al.,

90	  

2012; Goyal and Blackstone, 2013).
Cells with specialized functions are enriched in specific ER morphologies. For

92	  

example, pancreatic acinar cells and plasma cells, which produce and secrete large

93	  

amounts of protein, are mostly populated with polyribosome studded ER sheets. In

94	  

contrast, cells involved in carbohydrate metabolism (e.g. hepatocytes), steroid hormone

95	  

synthesis (e.g. adrenal cortical cells), and Ca+2 signaling (e.g. muscle cells) are

96	  

enriched in smooth tubular ER (Black, 1972; Shibata et al., 2006; Friedman and Voeltz,

97	  

2011; West et al., 2011; Goyal and Blackstone, 2013). The unfolded protein response

98	  

and ER stress induced by excess fatty acids lead to expansion of ER sheets, which is

99	  

energetically more favorable than ER tubule expansion and is thought to provide more

100	  

space for protein folding (Schuck et al., 2009; Friedman and Voeltz, 2011; Wikstrom et

101	  

al., 2013). Thus while correlations between ER morphology and function have been

102	  

described in certain specialized cell types and in response to cellular conditions, the

103	  

question remains whether ER morphology directly affects the functional output of the

104	  

ER.
In our study, we manipulated the ER tubule-to-sheet ratio to test if this broadly

105	  
106	  

impacts protein translation and trafficking, functional roles ascribed to the RER and SER,

107	  

respectively. We overexpressed the tubule shaping protein Rtn4a/Nogo-A in HeLa cells

108	  

to increase the ER tubule-to-sheet ratio, a previously validated approach to alter ER

109	  

morphology (Voeltz et al., 2006; Puhka et al., 2007; Shibata et al., 2010; Romero-Brey

110	  

and Bartenschlager, 2016). We examined a number of cell surface and secreted

111	  

proteins, finding that while their total levels were unchanged upon Rtn4a overexpression,

112	  

their trafficking through the secretory pathway was increased. We show that this effect

113	  

on exocytosis is in fact not due to altered ER morphology, but is rather a specific

114	  

function of Rtn4a. We also provide evidence that Rtn4a accelerates ER-to-Golgi

115	  

trafficking by promoting COPII vesicle formation. Thus our data suggest that altering ER

116	  

morphology does not necessarily influence protein translation and trafficking, but that

117	  

Rtn4a has a specific function in promoting COPII-mediated exocytosis.

123	  

GFP-NLS as a control, and overexpression of Rtn4a was confirmed by western blot and

124	  

immunofluorescence (Fig. S1, A-D). Based on immunoblotting, Rtn4a levels were

125	  

increased 8.8 ± 1.5 fold (average ± SD) compared to controls (Fig. S1, A-B). This level

126	  

of ectopic Rtn4a expression did not cause ER stress as evidenced by constant levels of

127	  

the ER chaperones calnexin, ERp72, and GRP78 (Fig. S1, E-H). To quantify Rtn4a-

128	  

induced conversion of ER sheets into tubules, we stained cells for the ER sheet marker

129	  

CLIMP63 (Fig. S1, I). Rtn4a expression increased the relative proportion of tubular ER

130	  

(Fig. S1, C) with a concomitant 2.6 ± 0.2 fold reduction in ER sheet volume (Fig. S1, J).

131	  

To assess how this change in ER morphology might affect protein synthesis and

132	  

trafficking, we focused on two cell surface plasma membrane proteins whose transit

133	  

through the secretory pathway has been well studied, Integrinβ1 and MHC class I/HLA-

134	  

A (Akiyama et al., 1989; Gawantka et al., 1992; Jones et al., 1996; Sun et al., 2009;

135	  

Rose et al., 2014). Total staining intensity for Integrinβ1 and HLA-A was unchanged

136	  

upon Rtn4a overexpression, indicating that reducing ER sheet volume does not reduce

137	  

synthesis of these two proteins (Fig. 1, E-H). Surprisingly, staining of non-permeabilized

138	  

cells revealed greater cell surface levels of these membrane proteins in Rtn4a-

139	  

transfected cells, by 1.4 ± 0.1 fold for Integrinβ1 and 3.2 ± 0.3 fold for HLA-A (Fig. 1, A-

140	  

D). Rtn4a overexpression also increased the cell surface transport, but not total levels,

141	  

of Integrinβ1 and HLA-A in MRC-5 cells, a non-cancerous lung fibroblast cell line (Fig.

142	  

S1, O-V). Thus in both a normal and cancer cell line, Rtn4a overexpression enhanced

143	  

trafficking of Integrinβ1 and HLA-A to the cell surface without affecting their overall

144	  

levels.
We reasoned that enhanced trafficking of Integrinβ1 and HLA-A through the

145	  
146	  

secretory pathway might lead to faster and overall increased maturation of these

147	  

proteins. While immature N-glycoproteins in the ER lumen and cis-Golgi are sensitive to

148	  

cleavage by endogycosidase H (EndoH), mature glycoproteins become EndoH-resistant

149	  

after terminal mannose removal by mannosidase II in the medial Golgi. Whole cell

150	  

lysates from control and Rtn4a-GFP transfected cells were treated with EndoH or buffer

151	  

alone and immunoblotted for Integrinβ1 and HLA-A, allowing for quantification of mature,

152	  

EndoH-resistant protein levels (Fig. 2, A and C). While total levels of Integrinβ1 and

153	  

HLA-A were unaffected by Rtn4a overexpression, consistent with our

154	  

immunofluorescence results, mature forms of Integrinβ1 and HLA-A were increased by

155	  

2.8 ± 0.8 fold and 1.8 ± 0.4 fold, respectively (Fig. 2, B and D). To assess all cell

156	  

surface glycoproteins, non-permeabilized cells were stained with concanavalin A (ConA)

157	  

which detects immature, high mannose N-glycans. Rtn4a overexpression decreased

158	  

cell surface ConA-staining intensity by 1.2 ± 0.03 fold without affecting total ConA-

159	  

staining levels (Fig. S1, K-N), suggesting an increased presence of mature

160	  

glycoproteins on the cell surface. Because the levels of key Golgi glycosyltransferases

161	  

were unchanged upon Rtn4a overexpression (data not shown), Rtn4a does not appear

162	  

to enhance protein maturation by modulating the protein glycosylation machinery.

163	  

Instead, we propose that Rtn4a promotes exocytic trafficking, thereby leading to

164	  

accelerated Golgi transport, N-glycosylation, and maturation. Taken together, these

165	  

data show that Rtn4a overexpression, which converts ER sheets to tubules, promotes

166	  

trafficking of two membrane glycoproteins to the cell surface without influencing their

167	  

overall expression levels.

168	  
169	  

Rtn4a promotes trafficking of cell surface proteins independently of effects on ER

170	  

morphology
While Rtn4a overexpression did not induce ER stress and increased trafficking of

171	  
172	  

cell surface proteins, indicating that overexpression was not having dominant negative

173	  

effects on cell function, we also wanted to test the consequences of Rtn4a depletion.

174	  

HeLa cells transfected with siRNA against Rtn4 exhibited reduced Rtn4 expression (Fig.

175	  

3, A-B), with Rtn4a levels decreased by 4.3 ± 0.9 fold based on immunoblotting (Fig.

176	  

S2, A-C). Rtn4 knockdown reduced cell surface levels of Integrinβ1 and HLA-A by 1.2 ±

177	  

0.1 fold and 1.3 ± 0.1 fold, respectively (Fig. 3, C-F). Consistent with previous studies

178	  

showing that Rtn1, 3, and 4 must be co-depleted to allow for conversion of ER tubules

179	  

into sheets (Voeltz et al., 2006; Anderson and Hetzer, 2008; Christodoulou et al., 2016),

180	  

we observed no change in ER sheet volume in Rtn4 knockdown cells (Fig. 3, G-H).

181	  

These results suggest that Rtn4 influences protein trafficking independently of any

182	  

effect on ER morphology.
To test if altering ER morphology through Rtn4a-independent means would

183	  
184	  

impact exocytosis, we overexpressed two other curvature stabilizing ER membrane

185	  

proteins – REEP5 and Rtn4b. Overexpressing REEP5 decreased ER sheet volume 2.9

186	  

± 0.04 fold (Fig. S2, D-G), similar to the 2.6-fold reduction in ER sheet volume induced

187	  

by Rtn4a overexpression (Fig S1, I-J), but had no effect on the amount of surface

188	  

localized Integrinβ1 and HLA-A (Fig. S2, H-J). Consistent with these results, a 6.9 ± 1.8

189	  

fold increase in Rtn4b expression led to a 2.3 ± 0.2 fold reduction in ER sheet volume

190	  

(Fig. S2, K-N) without changing the levels of Integrinβ1 and HLA-A on the cell surface

191	  

(Fig. S2, O-Q). Collectively, these data show that shifting ER morphology from sheets

192	  

to tubules is not sufficient to enhance trafficking of membrane proteins to the cell

193	  

surface, implying Rtn4a has a unique ER morphology-independent function in this

194	  

process.

195	  
196	  

Overexpression of Rtn4a increases the secretion of soluble proteins
To test if Rtn4a promotes exocytosis of soluble proteins in addition to cell surface

197	  
198	  

membrane proteins, we examined the secreted and intracellular levels of fibulin-5

199	  

(FBLN5) and thrombospondin-1 (TSP1). FBLN5 and TSP1 are both extracellular matrix

200	  

components ubiquitously expressed and secreted by many cells types (Lahav, 1993;

201	  

Bornstein, 1995; Crawford et al., 1998; Albig and Schiemann, 2005). Rtn4a

202	  

overexpression increased the amount of FBLN5 and TSP1 secreted into the media (Fig.

203	  

4, A and D), without affecting their overall expression levels (Fig. 4, C and F). While the

204	  

intracellular FBLN5 concentration was unchanged upon Rtn4a overexpression (Fig. 4

205	  

B), the intracellular TSP1 concentration was reduced (Fig. 4 E), suggesting TSP1 might

206	  

be trafficked faster than FBLN5. These data show that Rtn4a promotes exocytosis of

207	  

soluble secreted proteins in addition to membrane-bound proteins.

208	  
209	  

Rtn4a accelerates ER-to-Golgi trafficking
To begin to address how Rtn4a might promote protein trafficking to the cell

210	  
211	  

surface, we used the RUSH system to monitor transport of a fluorescent cargo through

212	  

the exocytic pathway. HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected with a LAMP1-RUSH

213	  

construct encoding mCherry-LAMP1 and streptavidin-Ii (Boncompain et al., 2012),

214	  

along with Rtn4a-GFP or GFP-NLS as a control. Prior to biotin addition, mCherry-

215	  

LAMP1 is trapped in the ER (Fig. 5 A; first row of images). After biotin addition and

216	  

LAMP1 release from the ER, we fixed cells at 15-minute intervals. While control cells

217	  

exhibited compact LAMP1 localization in the perinuclear region 15 minutes after biotin

218	  

addition, in Rtn4a-overexpressing cells LAMP1 was present in puncta dispersed

219	  

throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 5 A; second row of images). Similar LAMP1 cytoplasmic

220	  

puncta were not observed in control cells until 45 minutes after biotin addition (Fig. 5 A;

221	  

fourth row of images). These data suggest that LAMP1 exocytosis occurs more rapidly

222	  

when Rtn4a is overexpressed.
To estimate when LAMP1 was entering the Golgi, cells were fixed at shorter time

223	  
224	  

points after biotin addition and immunostained with the Golgi marker GRASP65 to

225	  

assess co-localization of LAMP1 with the Golgi (Fig. S3, A-D). Just a few minutes after

226	  

biotin addition, we observed significantly greater co-localization of LAMP1 with the Golgi

227	  

in cells overexpressing Rtn4a compared to controls (Fig. S3 E), suggesting accelerated

228	  

ER-to-Golgi transport. This prompted us to track ER-to-Golgi transport of LAMP1 by live

229	  

cell imaging (Fig. 6). We monitored the accumulation of mCherry-LAMP1 signal in the

230	  

presumptive Golgi as an increase in perinuclear fluorescence relative to peripheral ER

231	  

fluorescence. Perinuclear LAMP1 fluorescence peaked 6 minutes after biotin addition in

232	  

Rtn4a-overexpressing cells (Fig. 6, D-F and H; Video S1B), 9 minutes earlier than in

233	  

control cells (Fig. 6, A-C and G; Video S1A). It appeared that the Golgi was more

234	  

disperse in Rtn4a-transfected cells (Fig. 6 E; 6 minutes after biotin addition) compared

235	  

to control cells (Fig. 6 B; 15 minutes after biotin addition), which we confirmed by

236	  

staining for GRASP65 and the medial Golgi marker ManII, observing a ~2-fold decrease

237	  

in Golgi circularity and ~2-3 fold increase in Golgi volume upon Rtn4a overexpression

238	  

(Fig. 7, S3 F). Golgi morphology was also altered in REEP5- and Rtn4b-overexpressing

239	  

cells in which cell surface trafficking was unaffected (Fig. S3, G-I), suggesting that Golgi

240	  

fragmentation and enlargement are not sufficient to increase exocytosis and that Rtn4a

241	  

likely influences anterograde trafficking through another mechanism. Taken together,

242	  

these data suggest that Rtn4a overexpression accelerates ER-to-Golgi transport, which

243	  

in turn increases trafficking of proteins to the cell surface.

247	  

To begin to understand how Rtn4a might influence ER-to-Golgi vesicular

248	  

trafficking, we immunostained cells with the ER exit site (ERES) marker Sec31A, a key

249	  

component of the outer COPII coat that facilitates budding of anterograde vesicles out

250	  

of the ER (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 2000; Fromme and Schekman, 2005; Melero et al.,

2018). While predominantly perinuclear in control cells, Sec31A appeared more

252	  

scattered throughout the cytoplasm of Rtn4a-overexpressing cells and the Sec31A

253	  

staining area was 1.4 ± 0.2 fold greater (Fig. 8, A-B). Intriguingly, Sec31A puncta

254	  

frequently co-aligned with cortical ER tubules labeled with Rtn4a-GFP (Fig. 8, A and C).

255	  

Furthermore, in Sec31A co-immunoprecipitation experiments, overexpressed Rtn4a co-

256	  

precipitated with immuno-isolated intact COPII vesicles, as did a small fraction of

257	  

endogenous Rtn4a in control-transfected cells (Fig. 8, D-E). These data suggest that

258	  

Rtn4a may promote budding of COPII vesicles, perhaps by inducing membrane

259	  

curvature at ERES. Consistent with Rtn4a promoting anterograde trafficking, Rtn4a

260	  

overexpression also led to more disperse staining of ERGIC53 (Fig. S4, A-D), a

261	  

receptor for glycoprotein transport from ERES and a marker of transient pre-Golgi

262	  

structures found in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (Appenzeller et al.,

263	  

1999; Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 2000; Fromme and Schekman, 2005). Moreover,

264	  

Rtn4a overexpression scattered the distribution of COPI-coated retrograde vesicles (Fig.

265	  

S4, E-G), suggesting that Golgi-to-ER retrograde traffic may also increase upon Rtn4a

266	  

overexpression, possibly balancing enhanced forward transport (Lippincott-Schwartz et

267	  

al., 2000).

268	  
269	  

Overexpressed Rtn4a closely associates with Sec31A-containing vesicles and

270	  

tubules

271	  

To test if overexpressed Rtn4a might promote recruitment of COPII coat

272	  

components, we performed transmission electron microscopy on cells immuno-labeled

273	  

for Rtn4a and Sec31A with 6 nm and 15 nm gold particles, respectively. Rtn4a and

274	  

Sec31A were more frequently observed within the same tubular or vesicular

275	  

compartments in Rtn4a-overpressing cells compared to control cells (Fig. 9, A-B).

276	  

Because ER tubules are 50-100 nm in diameter (Bernales et al., 2006; Shibata et al.,

277	  

2006) and COPII-coated vesicles are generally 60-70 nm wide (Fromme and Schekman,

278	  

2005), we reasoned that in order for Rtn4a and Sec31A to co-localize in the same

279	  

membrane compartment, 6 and 15 nm gold particles should be at most 100 nm apart

280	  

from each other. We therefore quantified the number of 6 nm particles within 100 nm of

281	  

each 15 nm particle, which was 3.9 ± 0.3 fold greater in Rtn4a-overexpressing cells

282	  

compared to control cells (Fig. 9 C). Because this difference might be due to Rtn4a

283	  

overexpression itself, we also quantified the density of 6 nm particles in regions devoid

284	  

of Sec31A, finding that the Rtn4a particle density was 1.6 ± 0.1 fold higher close to

285	  

Sec31A as opposed to far from Sec31A in Rtn4a-overexpressing cells (Fig. 9 C). These

286	  

data suggest that COPII coats are preferentially recruited to Rtn4a-containing

287	  

membranes. Consistent with this idea, we also measured the distance between each 15

288	  

nm (Sec31A) particle and the nearest 6 nm (Rtn4a) particle, observing a 1.8 ± 0.1 fold

289	  

decrease in this distance upon overexpression of Rtn4a (Fig. 9 D).

290	  

We also observed co-localization of Sec31A and Rtn4a in membrane structures

291	  

that appeared morphologically distinct from canonical membrane vesicles (Fig. S5, A-

292	  

B). These membrane structures protruded from enclosed membrane compartments and

293	  

consisted of narrow tubular necks terminating in wider vesicular heads. Rtn4a was

294	  

frequently observed in these structures and Sec31A tended to localize along the necks

295	  

(Fig. S5, A-B). Perhaps Rtn4a can promote an alternative mode of vesicle budding at

296	  

ERES whereby the COPII machinery pinches off a tubular vesicle instead of coating the

297	  

vesicle surface. We also quantified a 1.2 ± 0.03 fold decrease in ER tubule width upon

298	  

Rtn4a overexpression (Fig. S5 C), consistent with the idea that Rtn4a-induced

299	  

membrane constriction and curvature might promote recruitment of the COPII vesicle

300	  

budding machinery.

301	  
302	  

DISCUSSION
We report that inducing a more tubular ER does not significantly influence protein

303	  
304	  

synthesis levels in both HeLa cells and a normal lung fibroblast cell line. ER sheets are

305	  

synonymous with rough ER, bound by translating polyribosomes and associated with

306	  

protein biosynthesis, folding, and post-translational modification (Shibata et al., 2006).

307	  

Conversely, smooth ER tubules are largely devoid of polyribosomes and are instead

308	  

specialized for calcium signaling and lipid metabolism. Why might reducing ER sheet

309	  

volume have no effect on protein synthesis levels? One possibility is that active

310	  

polyribosomes redistribute to the tubular ER in Rtn4a-overexpressing cells. However,

311	  

our TEM images provided no evidence of increased polyribosomes on ER tubules (data

312	  

not shown), consistent with the observation that ER tubules are only populated by non-

313	  

translating single ribosomes and small polyribosomes (Shibata et al., 2006; Shibata et

314	  

al., 2010), likely because the high curvature of the SER prevents recruitment of large,

315	  

spiral polysomal structures. Rather we propose that the biosynthetic capacity of rough

316	  

ER sheets is sufficiently high so that a ~2.6-fold reduction in ER sheet volume has no

317	  

effect on overall protein levels. Consistent with this idea, our TEM images showed no

318	  

significant change in the density of spiral polyribosomes on the RER upon Rtn4a

319	  

overexpression (data not shown). Furthermore, converting ER tubules into sheets by

320	  

overexpression of CLIMP63 did not increase synthesis of Integrinβ1 and HLA-A (data

321	  

not shown), again suggesting that the relative luminal volume of the RER does not

322	  

directly impact the output of the translational machinery. Thus while there are

323	  

specialized cell types that are enriched in rough ER sheets or tubular smooth ER

324	  

(Friedman and Voeltz, 2011; Goyal and Blackstone, 2013), altering ER morphology in

325	  

cells with a more traditional ER tubule-to-sheet ratio has little effect on overall protein

326	  

synthesis levels.
While Rtn4a overexpression did not alter levels of protein synthesis, we did

327	  
328	  

observe an increase in ER-to-Golgi trafficking and exocytosis of both membrane-bound

329	  

and soluble proteins. This effect was likely not due to a change in ER morphology, as

330	  

cell surface trafficking was unaffected by overexpression of two other ER tubule-

331	  

promoting proteins, Rtn4b and REEP5, and Rtn4a knock down reduced trafficking

332	  

without affecting ER morphology. Thus Rtn4a appears to have a specific function in

333	  

enhancing anterograde transport. If ER morphology has little effect on protein

334	  

translation and trafficking, how might Rtn4a specifically promote exocytosis? Rtn4a is

335	  

known to induce membrane curvature (Voeltz et al., 2006; Shibata et al., 2008; Zurek et

336	  

al., 2011), and COPII vesicle budding preferentially occurs at sites of high membrane

337	  

curvature (Wang et al., 2017; Melero et al., 2018). As our immunofluorescence, co-

338	  

immunoprecipitation, and immuno-TEM experiments all suggested co-localization of

339	  

Rtn4a and Sec31A, we propose that membrane curvature induced by Rtn4a promotes

340	  

recruitment of the COPII coat machinery, thereby facilitating vesicle budding from ERES

341	  

and enhancing overall exocytosis. REEP5 and Rtn4b overexpression did not alter

342	  

protein transport to the cell surface, indicating that membrane curvature by itself cannot

343	  

enhance trafficking and that Rtn4a must contain a unique structural element that

344	  

confers this ability. The splice isoform Rtn4b lacks a unique N-terminal domain present

345	  

in Rtn4a, suggesting that this region may be involved in promoting trafficking. It is worth

346	  

noting that this same N-terminal region is also associated with Rtn4a’s inhibitory effect

347	  

on neurite outgrowth (GrandPré et al., 2000; Oertle and Schwab, 2003; Yan et al., 2006;

348	  

Yang and Strittmatter, 2007), suggesting a potential link between these two functions.

349	  

While C-terminal transmembrane domains in Rtn4 are known to induce membrane

350	  

curvature, there is evidence that other domains of Rtn4a may also be important in

351	  

shaping the tubular ER (Zurek et al., 2011). Perhaps unique biophysical properties of

352	  

Rtn4a-induced membrane curvature contribute to enhanced exocytosis. Future studies

353	  

will elucidate the structural elements of Rtn4a that enhance vesicular transport.
Our results with Rtn4a add to a growing literature on the role of reticulons in

354	  
355	  

protein trafficking. Overexpression of RTN1C in rat PC12 adrenal tumor cells increased

356	  

exocytosis of human growth hormone, mediated by interactions with the SNARE

357	  

proteins syntaxin-1, -7, -13, and VAMP2 (Steiner et al., 2004; Di Sano et al., 2012).

358	  

RTN3 has been shown to play a role in retrograde protein transport from the cis-Golgi

359	  

and/or ERGIC to the ER. Notably, overexpression of RTN3 in HeLa cells delayed

360	  

trafficking of VSVG from the ER to the cell surface and restricted ERGIC53 staining to

361	  

the perinuclear region (Wakana et al., 2005). Combining these results with our own,

362	  

perhaps Rtn3 and Rtn4a have antagonizing effects on the early secretory pathway.

363	  

Previous studies support a role for Rtn4a in neuronal protein secretion. Rtn4a mRNA is

364	  

highly expressed in the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus of the rat

365	  

hypothalamus, both regions being highly active for neuroendocrine secretion

366	  

(Hasegawa et al., 2005), and RTN4A knockdown decreased dopamine release in rat

367	  

PC12 cells (Xiong et al., 2008). Thus, while Rtn4a/Nogo-A has been implicated in

368	  

protein secretion in the nervous system, our results show that Rtn4a plays a more

369	  

general role in exocytosis, providing a potential mechanism that involves recruitment of

370	  

the COPII vesicle budding machinery.

371	  

Finally, Rtn4a’s capacity to enhance exocytosis might be relevant in cancer and

372	  

neurodegenerative disease, where pathogenesis is often driven by abnormal secretion

373	  

of growth factors, proteases, and neuropeptides (Daughaday and Deuel, 1991; Lynch

374	  

and Mobley, 2000; Yan et al., 2006; Lodish et al., 2008). For example, Rtn4a protein is

375	  

upregulated in malignant brain tumor (glioma) cells (Björling et al., 2008), concomitant

376	  

with increased secretion of cathepsin B (McCormick, 1993), VEGF (Jensen et al., 2006),

377	  

and chemokines (Jordan et al., 2008). Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is

378	  

associated with motor neuron degeneration and skeletal muscle paralysis. High levels

379	  

of Rtn4a were measured in the muscles of ALS patients as well as in mouse models of

380	  

ALS. Knocking down RTN4A in ALS mice delayed disease progression and extended

381	  

survival (Dupuis et al., 2002; Bruijn et al., 2004; Jokic et al., 2006). Given that Rtn4a is

382	  

an inhibitor of neurite outgrowth and axonal regeneration, processes regulated by

383	  

vesicular trafficking (Tojima and Kamiguchi, 2015), perhaps Rtn4a contributes to ALS

384	  

by influencing exocytosis (Yang and Strittmatter, 2007). The pathogenesis of

385	  

Parkinson’s disease has also been linked to Rtn4a (More et al., 2013; Schawkat et al.,

386	  

2015), with a possible mechanism being increased secretion of the inflammatory

387	  

cytokines TNFα and IL-6 (Zhong et al., 2015). Future research will examine the potential

388	  

disease links between Rtn4a and protein trafficking.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

391	  

Plasmids and siRNA

392	  

The Rtn4a-GFP (pAcGFP1-N1 Rtn4a) (Shibata et al., 2008) and mCherry-REEP5

393	  

(pmCherry-C2 REEP5) (Schlaitz et al., 2013) mammalian expression plasmids were

394	  

generous gifts from Gia Voeltz (University of Colorado, Boulder) and Anne Schlaitz

395	  

(Zentrum für Molekulare Biologie der Universität Heidelberg), respectively. The RUSH

396	  

construct Str-Ii_LAMP1-SBP-mCherry was a gift from Franck Perez (Boncompain et al.,

397	  

2012). The GFP-Rtn4b expression plasmid (pDL34) was described previously (Jevtić

398	  

and Levy, 2015). The control GFP-NLS plasmid was from Invitrogen (V821-20). To

399	  

knock down expression of RTN4, we used a DsiRNA (IDT): sense 5’-

400	  

CUGGAAUCUGAAGUUGCUAUAUCUG-3’, and antisense 5’-

401	  

CAGAUAUAGCAACUUCAGAUUCCAG-3’. This DsiRNA sequence is based on a

previously described siRNA against RTN4 (Anderson and Hetzer, 2008).

403	  
404	  

Mammalian Tissue Culture and Transfections

405	  

HeLa cells were obtained from ATCC and MRC-5 normal human lung fibroblast cells

406	  

were a gift from Jason Gigley (University of Wyoming). Cells were verified to be

407	  

mycoplasma-free (ThermoFisher Scientific #M7006). Both cell lines were cultured in

408	  

Eagle’s minimum essential medium (EMEM), supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine

409	  

serum (FBS) and 50 IU/ml of penicillin/streptomycin, at 37°C in 5% CO2. For transient

410	  

transfection of plasmids, cells were seeded at 3 x 105 cells/well in 6-well plates and

411	  

grown to 70–90% confluency. 2.5 µg of plasmid DNA were transfected per well using

412	  

Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer’s protocol. For transient

413	  

siRNA transfections, cells were grown in 6-well plates to 60-80% confluency. 25 pmol of

414	  

siRNA were transfected per well using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen), following

415	  

the manufacturer’s protocol. BLOCK-iT™ Alexa Fluor™ Red Fluorescent Control

416	  

(Invitrogen) was used as a control and also co-transfected with RTN4 siRNA to identify

417	  

transfected cells. The average transfection efficiency for each plasmid and siRNA was

418	  

calculated from 3-5 independent experiments: 69.5% for GFP-NLS, 75.6% for Rtn4a-

419	  

GFP, 62.2% for mCherry-REEP5, 72.4% for GFP-Rtn4b, 64.2% for BLOCK-iT Red

420	  

Fluorescent Control alone, and 64.5% for the co-transfection of RTN4 siRNA with

421	  

BLOCK-iT Red Fluorescent Control. To prepare cells for immunofluorescence analysis,

422	  

transfected cells from each well were trypsinized using 450 µl of 1X Trypsin-EDTA

423	  

solution (Sigma) at 24 h after transfection and transferred onto two acid-washed 18-mm

424	  

square coverslips in 35-mm2 dishes with 2 ml of fresh culture medium. 12 h later,

425	  

culture medium was removed and coverslips were processed for immunofluorescence.

426	  

To prepare cell pellets for whole cell lysates, medium was removed from the 6-well

427	  

plates at 24 h post transfection and replaced with 2ml/well of fresh culture medium. 12 h

428	  

later, cells were trypsinized, spun down at 3500 rpm for 5 min, and washed twice in

429	  

PBS.

(PBS), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and then subjected to three 5 min

434	  

washes with PBS. Cells were permeabilized for 7 – 10 min with 0.25% Triton-X-100 and

435	  

washed thrice with PBS for 5 min each. Blocking was performed for 1 hr at room

436	  

temperature with 10% normal goat serum (Sigma) supplemented with 0.3 M glycine and

437	  

then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibody diluted in 1.5% normal goat

438	  

serum. Cells were washed thrice in PBS for 5 min each and incubated at room

439	  

temperature for 1 hr with secondary antibodies diluted in 1.5% normal goat serum

440	  

supplemented with 2.5 µg/ml Hoechst. Cells were then washed thrice in PBS for 5 min

441	  

each followed by two brief washes with sterile water. Finally, coverslips were mounted

442	  

in Vectashield (Vector Labratories) and sealed with nail polish. The following secondary

443	  

antibodies were used at 1:500 dilutions: Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 568

444	  

conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) and Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) (Invitrogen) and

445	  

Alexa Fluor 405 conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H&L) (Abcam 175652). The Triton-X-

446	  

100 incubation step was skipped for experiments requiring non-permeabilized cells.

447	  
448	  

Confocal Microscopy

449	  

Imaging was performed with a spinning-disk confocal microscope based on an Olympus

450	  

IX71 microscope stand equipped with a five-line LMM5 laser launch (Spectral Applied

451	  

Research) and switchable two-fiber output to allow imaging through either a Yokogawa

452	  

CSU-X1 spinning-disk head or TIRF illuminator. Confocal images were acquired with an

453	  

ORCA-Flash4.0 V2 Digital CMOS C11440-22CU camera (ImagEM, Hamamatsu) using

454	  

an Olympus PlanAPO 100x/1.40 oil objective (for fixed cells) or Olympus UPlanFLN

455	  

60x/0.90 dry objective (for live cells). Z-axis focus was regulated using a piezo Pi-Foc

456	  

(Physik Instrumente), and multiposition imaging was performed using a motorized Ludl

457	  

stage. Image acquisition and all system components were controlled using MetaMorph

458	  

software (Molecular Devices). All images were acquired using the same exposure time

459	  

for a particular channel and experimental condition.

460	  
461	  

Quantification from Fixed Cell Imaging

462	  

Unless otherwise noted, multiple z-stacks were acquired during fixed cell imaging for

463	  

each cell, using a 0.2 µm z-slice thickness. Z-stacks were converted into maximum

464	  

intensity projections in ImageJ, thresholded using MetaMorph software (Molecular

465	  

Devices), and mean fluorescence intensity per cell was measured from thresholded

466	  

images. Finally, mean fluorescence intensities from all cells were averaged for each

467	  

condition. In order to quantify ER sheet and Golgi volumes, z-stacks were reconstructed

468	  

and thresholded in 3D using MetaMorph software and the voxel volume was calculated

469	  

based on the thresholded isosurface. Circularity/compactness of Golgi structures was

470	  

measured from maximum intensity projections as previously described (Zahnleiter et al.,

471	  

2015). Briefly, images were thresholded in MetaMorph and regions of interest were

472	  

defined around Golgi clusters. The perimeter and area of every Golgi component were

473	  

quantified and circularity of the Golgi apparatus was calculated using the formula 4π x

474	  

[ {sum(areas) ÷ sum(perimeters)}2 ]. Staining areas of Sec31A and COP-A were

475	  

measured from thresholded images in MetaMorph. ERGIC53 staining distribution was

476	  

quantified from maximum intensity projections in ImageJ by drawing three straight lines

477	  

per cell (up to 15 µm in length) from the nuclear envelope to the cell periphery and

478	  

measuring pixel intensities along the lines. Pixel intensities along the line scans were

479	  

then averaged for all cells. For quantifying the colocalization of mCherry-LAMP1

480	  

(magenta) and Golgi (cyan), 3 - 4 single z-slices with prominent Golgi membranes were

481	  

selected for both channels. Golgi images were thresholded in MetaMorph and total

482	  

Golgi areas were quantified. Next, images from both channels corresponding to a

483	  

particular z-plane were merged such that ‘white’ pixels corresponded to co-localization.

484	  

The total area covered by white pixels was quantified manually in MetaMorph by

485	  

drawing regions of interest around every white/merged component. To calculate the

486	  

LAMP1 fraction that co-localized with the Golgi, the colocalized area (white) was divided

487	  

by the total Golgi area for 3 – 4 selected z-planes per cell. These values were averaged

488	  

from all z-planes for every cell to produce a mean value for the LAMP1 fraction that co-

489	  

localized with the Golgi. For publication, images were cropped and pseudocolored using

490	  

ImageJ, but were otherwise unaltered.

Live Cell Imaging and Quantification

495	  

Slide 8 Well (Ibidi – 80826) each containing 300 µl of fresh media. 12 h later,

496	  

chambered slides were placed in a stage top incubator (Tokai Hit – INUBG2A-ZILCS)

497	  

and confocal imaging was performed at a single focal plane. ER trapped LAMP1 was

498	  

released by adding 40 µM D-Biotin to the media and time lapse imaging was started

499	  

immediately. Images were acquired every 90 seconds and continued for 1 h 12 min. To

500	  

quantify trafficking of LAMP1 through the secretory pathway, regions of interest of the

501	  

same area were drawn around bright perinuclear LAMP1 puncta as well as dimmer

502	  

perinuclear regions for every time point until 24 min post Biotin addition. Integrated

503	  

densities of mCherry fluorescence were measured for the indicated regions in ImageJ.

504	  

Integrated density for the brighter perinuclear LAMP1 signal was divided by the

505	  

integrated density of the dimmer perinuclear LAMP1 signal at each time point to

506	  

estimate accumulation of LAMP1 in the Golgi over time. Each of these ratios was then

507	  

normalized to the lowest value in a time series for a given cell, averaged, and plotted as

508	  

a function of time post ER release. Peaks were interpreted to represent the highest

509	  

relative accumulation of LAMP1 in the Golgi for each condition.

Western Blots

512	  

Whole-cell lysates were prepared from tissue culture cell pellets at 36 h post

513	  

transfection using SDS-PAGE sample buffer supplemented with benzonase nuclease

514	  

(Sigma, E1014) and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE gels (4–

515	  

20% gradient) and transferred to PVDF membrane. Membranes were blocked in

516	  

Odyssey PBS Blocking Buffer (Li-Cor, 927-40000). The primary and secondary

517	  

antibodies were diluted in Odyssey PBS Blocking Buffer supplemented with 0.2%

518	  

Tween-20. Anti-β-actin was used as a loading control. The secondary antibodies used

519	  

were anti-mouse IRDye-680RD (Li-Cor 925-68070) and anti-rabbit IRDye-800CW (Li-

520	  

Cor 925-32211) at 1:20,000. Blots were scanned on a Li-Cor Odyssey CLx instrument

521	  

and band quantification was performed with ImageStudio. For a given sample, Rtn4a

522	  

band intensity was normalized to the actin signal.

NP-40, 0.5% Sodium Deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM DTT, 1x Sigma Fast Protease

527	  

Inhibitor cocktail) for EndoH digestion. Cell pellets were obtained at 36 h post

528	  

transfection, resuspended in ice-cold RIPA buffer, and allowed to lyse for 30 min on ice.

529	  

After lysis, cells were spun down at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was

530	  

stored at -80°C or used immediately. Total protein concentration was measured using

531	  

the EZQ™ Protein Quantitation Kit (Invitrogen). 5-10 µg of total protein (9 µl of lysate)

532	  

were treated with Endo Hf (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 37°C, following the

533	  

manufacturer’s protocol. Untreated controls were supplemented with GlycoBuffer3 (New

534	  

England Biolabs). Reactions were stopped by treatment with SDS-PAGE sample buffer

535	  

containing benzonase nuclease (Sigma, E1014) and boiling for 5 min. Samples were

536	  

separated on SDS-PAGE gels (4–20% gradient) and transferred to PVDF membrane for

537	  

immunoblotting.

Concanavalin A Staining

540	  

Coverslips with cells were fixed 36 h post transfection and processed following the

541	  

standard immunofluorescence protocol with or without permeabilization with 0.25%

542	  

Triton-X-100. Blocking was performed with a 1% solution of glycoprotein free Bovine

543	  

Serum Albumin (Sigma - A3059) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were

544	  

incubated with 10 µg/ml Biotinylated Concanavalin A (Vector Laboratories, a gift from

545	  

Don Jarvis at the University of Wyoming) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature,

546	  

followed by three 5 min washes with PBS. Cells were then stained with 5 µg/ml Texas

547	  

Red Streptavidin (Vector Laboratories, a gift from Don Jarvis at the University of

548	  

Wyoming) for 30 min at room temperature and washed thrice in PBS for 5 min each.

549	  

Cells were stained for 5 min with Hoechst (5 µg/ml) and briefly washed thrice with PBS

550	  

and twice with sterile water. Finally, coverslips were mounted in Vectashield (Vector

551	  

Labratories) and sealed with nail polish.

Nucleofection and ELISA

556	  

Nucleofection of HeLa cells was performed using a Lonza 4D-Nucleofector™ device

557	  

and Amaxa™ SE Cell Line 4D-Nucleofector™ X Kit (Lonza - V4XC-1024), according to

558	  

the manufacturer’s protocol. 5.8 x 105 cells were used per reaction. Post-nucleofection,

559	  

cells were immediately seeded into 12 well plates containing 900 µl of medium per well.

560	  

12 h later, the conditioned medium was removed, spun down at 5000 rpm for 5 min at

561	  

room temperature, and the supernatant was collected. The cells from each well were

562	  

trypsinized, counted using a hemocytometer, and lysed in 50 µl of RIPA buffer. Both the

563	  

media supernatant and whole cell lysate were subjected to sandwich ELISA. ELISAs

564	  

were performed using FBLN5 (Fibulin-5) Human ELISA Kit from Fine Test (EH0772)

565	  

and Thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) Human ELISA Kit from Invitrogen (BMS2100), following

566	  

the manufacturer’s protocols. ELISA plates were read at 450 nm using a Wallac 1420

567	  

Victor2 Microplate Reader (Perkin Elmer, provided by Don Jarvis at the University of

568	  

Wyoming). Whole cell lysate was diluted 1:10 in ELISA assay buffers. FBLN5 and TSP1

569	  

concentrations (ng/ml) were quantified in media (secreted) and whole cell lysate

570	  

(intracellular) from standard curves. Total protein amounts (picograms) present in 900 µl

571	  

of media and 50 µl of cell lysate were calculated. These values were normalized to the

572	  

number of live cells per well. Secreted and intracellular protein amounts were added to

573	  

calculate the total protein amount per cell. Data from three independent experiments

574	  

were averaged. Average nucleofection efficiencies for GFP-NLS and Rtn4a-GFP were

575	  

71.6% and 82.2% respectively, calculated from three independent experiments.

576	  
577	  

Immuno-isolation of Sec31A/COPII Vesicles

578	  

HeLa cells were nucleofected with plasmids expressing GFP-NLS or Rtn4a-GFP in

579	  

triplicate (6.5 x 105 cells per reaction) as previously described and seeded in T25 flasks

580	  

containing 3 ml fresh culture medium. 24 h post-nucleofection, medium was removed

581	  

and cells were scraped into 2.5 ml ice cold PBS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+)

582	  

supplemented with 10 µg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin. Cells were

583	  

spun down at 2,000 rpm for 3 min at 4°C and the pellets were resuspended in 1.5 ml ice

584	  

cold Homogenization Buffer (250 mM Sucrose, 25 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES pH=7.2, 1

585	  

mM EGTA, and 1x Sigma Fast Protease Inhibitor cocktail), as previously described

586	  

(Syed et al., 2017). Cell suspensions were homogenized by passing through a 25-

587	  

gauge syringe needle (10 times) and homogenates were centrifuged (600 g for 5 min)

588	  

twice	  at 4°C. The final supernatant (Post Nuclear Supernatant) containing intact

589	  

membrane vesicles was used for immunoprecipitation using Pierce™ Protein A/G

590	  

Magnetic Beads (Thermo Scientific), following the manufacturer’s protocol. A detergent-

591	  

free wash buffer (Tris Buffered Saline) was used to maintain the integrity of immuno-

592	  

isolated vesicles and all steps were performed at 4°C. 10 µg of anti-Sec31A antibody

595	  

membrane vesicles were eluted in 50 µl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 5

596	  

min. 30 µl aliquots were separated on SDS-PAGE gels (4–20% gradient) and

597	  

transferred onto PVDF membrane for immunoblotting with anti-Sec31A and anti-Rtn4a

Immuno Electron Microscopy

601	  

Cells from three independent transfection reactions were collected at 36 h post

602	  

transfection and processed for immuno electron microscopy, following a previously

603	  

described protocol (Phend et al., 1995). Briefly, cells were fixed with 4%

604	  

paraformaldehyde + 0.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 1.5 h and

605	  

embedded in 2% low melting point agarose. Agarose cubes containing cells were rinsed

606	  

with ddH2O three times for 5 min each and treated with 1% tannic acid in PBS for 1 h at

607	  

room temperature. After three 5 min washes with ddH2O, agarose cubes were

608	  

incubated with 2% uranyl acetate at room temperature for 1.5 h. Embedded cells were

609	  

sequentially dehydrated in 10%, 20%, and 40% ethanol (10 min each), then 60% and

610	  

80% ethanol (20 min each), then 100% ethanol (three times, 15 min each). Next,

611	  

infiltration was performed in 1:2 (v/v) LR White Resin (LRW):ethanol (100%) for 1.5 hr,

612	  

2:1 (v/v) LRW:ethanol (100%) for 1 hr, and then 100% LRW overnight at room

613	  

temperature. Finally, cell blocks were sealed in beem capsules filled with LRW and

614	  

polymerized overnight at 4–8°C under UV radiation. Polymerized blocks were trimmed

615	  

and cut into 50 – 60 nm sections using an ultramicrotome and 3 sections were collected

616	  

on each formvar-carbon coated nickel grid. For immuno-labeling, grids were blocked for

617	  

nonspecific binding with 10% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature.

618	  

Grids were then incubated with rabbit anti-Rtn4a antibodies (Abcam) and mouse anti-

619	  

Sec31A antibodies (Santa Cruz) diluted 1:20 in 1.5% goat serum overnight at 4°C,

620	  

followed by three 5 min rinses in PBS. The grids were blocked again for 1 h at room

621	  

temperature and incubated for 2 h with 1:20 Goat-Anti-Rabbit IgG antibodies (H+L)

622	  

(EMS 25104) and 1:10 Goat-Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) (EMS 25133) antibodies coupled

623	  

with 6 nm and 15 nm gold particles, respectively, diluted in 1.5% goat serum. The grids

were rinsed three times 5 min in PBS, stained with lead citrate for 30-60 sec, rinsed

625	  

extensively in ddH2O, and air dried. All grids were imaged with a Hitachi H-7000

626	  

transmission electron microscope, equipped with a 4K×4K Gatan digital camera (Gatan,

627	  

Inc., Pleasanton, CA). For each condition, 5 – 7 1513nm x 1513nm images were

628	  

acquired from each section, for 7 - 10 sections from 3 grids. 8 – 10 sections were used

629	  

from each polymerized block and 2 blocks were used per condition. All quantifications

630	  

were performed in ImageJ and images were cropped to 500 nm x 500 nm for

631	  

publication. All reagents for electron microscopy and secondary antibodies for immuno-

632	  

gold labelling were purchased from Electron Microscopy Sciences.

633	  
634	  

Statistics

635	  

Averaging and statistical analysis were performed for independently repeated

636	  

experiments. Unpaired t-tests were performed using GraphPad Software to evaluate

637	  

statistical significance. The p-values, number of independent experiments, and error

638	  

bars are denoted in the figure legends.

accumulation of LAMP1 in the Golgi over time, the integrated density of the brighter

937	  

perinuclear LAMP1 signal was divided by the integrated density of the dimmer

938	  

perinuclear LAMP1 signal at each time point. The peaks indicated by arrows at 15

939	  

minutes for the control and 6 minutes for Rtn4a overexpression represent the highest

940	  

relative accumulation of LAMP1 in the Golgi.

HeLa cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing GFP-NLS as a control

946	  

or Rtn4a-GFP (green). (A) Cells were stained for medial Golgi marker ManII (red) and

947	  

DNA (blue). (B-C) Golgi circularity (B) and volume (C) were quantified based on ManII

948	  

staining for 26-29 cells per condition. Volume was quantified from 3D reconstructed

949	  

confocal z-stacks. (D) Cells were stained for Golgi marker GRASP65 (red) and DNA

950	  

(blue). (E-F) Golgi circularity (E) and volume (F) were quantified based on GRASP65

951	  

staining for 38-41 cells per condition. Volume was quantified from 3D reconstructed

952	  

confocal z-stacks.

Figure 9. Overexpressed Rtn4a closely associates with Sec31A-containing

971	  

vesicles and tubules. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing

972	  

GFP-NLS as a control or Rtn4a-GFP. Cells were processed for TEM, and immuno-gold

973	  

labeling was performed to label Rtn4 with 6 nm gold particles and Sec31A with 15 nm

974	  

gold particles. (A-B) Representative immuno-TEM micrographs of cells showing

975

Red arrows denote single or multiple 6 nm gold particles corresponding to Rtn4a. 15 nm

977	  

gold particles marked by black arrowheads represent Sec31A. (C) To quantify the

978	  

density of 6 nm particles close to a 15 nm particle, the number of 6 nm particles was

979	  

counted within a 100 nm radius circle around a 15 nm particle (85 – 127 15 nm particles

980	  

per condition). To quantify the density of 6 nm particles in regions devoid of 15 nm

981	  

particles, the number of 6 nm particles was counted within randomly selected 100 nm

982
