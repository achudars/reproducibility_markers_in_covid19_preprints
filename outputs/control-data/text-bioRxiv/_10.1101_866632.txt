Abstract
Unlike in animals, in plants vein patterning does not rely on direct
cell-cell interaction and cell migration; instead, it depends on the
transport of the plant signal auxin, which in turn depends on the
activity of the PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1) auxin transporter. The
current hypotheses of vein patterning by auxin transport propose
that in the epidermis of the developing leaf PIN1-mediated auxin
transport converges to peaks of auxin level. From those convergence
points of epidermal PIN1 polarity, auxin would be transported in the
inner tissues where it would give rise to major veins. Here we tested
predictions of this hypothesis and found them unsupported:
epidermal PIN1 expression is neither required nor sufficient for auxintransport-dependent vein patterning, whereas inner-tissue PIN1
expression turns out to be both required and sufficient for auxintransport-dependent vein patterning. Our results refute all vein
patterning hypotheses based on auxin transport from the epidermis
and suggest alternatives for future tests.

Introduction
Most multicellular organisms solve the problem of long-distant transport of signals
and nutrients by means of tissue networks such as the vascular system of
vertebrate embryos and the vein networks of plant leaves; therefore, how vascular
networks form is a key question in biology. In vertebrates, the formation of the
embryonic vascular system relies on direct cell-cell interaction and at least in part
on cell migration (e.g., (Noden, 1988; Xue et al., 1999)), both of which are
precluded in plants by a wall that keeps cells apart and in place; therefore, vascular
networks form differently in plant leaves.
How leaf vein networks form is unclear, but available evidence suggests that
polar transport of the plant signal auxin is non-redundantly required for vein
patterning (Mattsson, Sung, & Berleth, 1999; Sieburth, 1999). Such nonredundant functions of polar auxin transport in vein patterning in turn depend on
non-redundant functions of the PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1) auxin transporter
(Galweiler et al., 1998; Petrasek et al., 2006; Zourelidou et al., 2014; Sawchuk,
Edgar, & Scarpella, 2013; Verna, Ravichandran, Sawchuk, Linh, & Scarpella,
2019). At early stages of leaf development, PIN1 polar localization at the plasma
membrane of epidermal cells is directed toward single cells along the marginal

epidermis (Reinhardt et al., 2003; Benkova et al., 2003; Heisler et al., 2005;
Scarpella, Marcos, Friml, & Berleth, 2006; Wenzel, Schuetz, Yu, & Mattsson,
2007; Hay, Barkoulas, & Tsiantis, 2006; Bayer et al., 2009). These convergence
points of epidermal PIN1 polarity are associated with broad domains of PIN1
expression in the inner tissue of the developing leaf, and these broad domains will
over time become restricted to the narrow sites where the midvein and lateral
veins will form.
Consistent with those observations, the prevailing hypotheses of vein
patterning propose that convergence points of epidermal PIN1 polarity contribute
to the formation of local peaks of auxin level in the epidermis, and that that auxin
is transported by PIN1 from the epidermal convergence points into the inner
tissues of the leaf, where it will lead to vein formation (reviewed in (Runions,
Smith, & Prusinkiewicz, 2014; Prusinkiewicz & Runions, 2012); see also (Alim &
Frey, 2010; Hartmann, Barbier de Reuille, & Kuhlemeier, 2019), and references
therein). As such, these hypotheses predict that epidermal PIN1 expression is
required for vein patterning. Here we tested this prediction and found it
unsupported: epidermal PIN1 expression is neither required nor sufficient for
auxin-transport-dependent vein patterning; instead, PIN1 expression in the inner
tissues turns out to be both required and sufficient for auxin-transport-dependent
vein patterning. Our results refute all the current hypotheses of vein formation
that depend on polar auxin transport from the epidermis and suggest alternatives
for future testing.

Results and Discussion
PIN1 Expression during Arabidopsis Vein Patterning
In Arabidopsis leaf development, the formation of the midvein precedes the
formation of the first loops of veins (“first loops”), which in turn precedes the
formation of the second loops (Mattsson et al., 1999; Sieburth, 1999; Sawchuk,
Head, Donner, & Scarpella, 2007; Scarpella, Francis, & Berleth, 2004; Kang &
Dengler, 2004) (Fig. 1A–C). The formation of second loops precedes the formation
of third loops and that of minor veins in the area delimited by the midvein and
the first loops (Fig. 1C,D). Loops and minor veins form first near the top of the
leaf and then progressively closer to its bottom, and minor veins form after loops
in the same area of the leaf (Fig. 1B–D).

Consistent with previous reports (Scarpella et al., 2006; Wenzel et al., 2007;
Sawchuk et al., 2013; Heisler et al., 2005; Benkova et al., 2003; Marcos & Berleth,
2014; Bayer et al., 2009; Reinhardt et al., 2003; Sawchuk et al., 2007; Verna et al.,
2019), a fusion of the PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1) open reading frame to YFP driven
by the PIN1 promoter (PIN1::gPIN1:YFP) (Xu et al., 2006) was expressed in all
the cells of the leaf at early stages of tissue development; over time, however,
epidermal expression became restricted to the basalmost cells, and inner-tissue
expression became restricted to developing veins (Fig. 1E–H).
We asked whether PIN1::gPIN1:YFP expression were recapitulated by the
activity of the PIN1 promoter. To address this question, we imaged expression of
a nuclear YFP driven by the PIN1 promoter (PIN1::nYFP) in first leaves 2, 2.5,
3, and 4 days after germination (DAG).
Just like PIN1::gPIN1:YFP (Fig. 1E–H), PIN1::nYFP was expressed in all
the inner cells of the leaf at early stages of tissue development, and over time this
inner-tissue expression became restricted to developing veins (Fig. 1I–L). However,
unlike PIN1::gPIN1:YFP and PIN1::gPIN1:CFP (Gordon et al., 2007) (Fig. 1E–
H,M), PIN1::nYFP was expressed in very few epidermal cells at the tip of 2-DAG
primordia and at the margin of 2.5-DAG primordia, and this epidermal expression
was very rare (Fig. 1I,J). PIN1::nYFP expression in epidermal cells at the leaf
margin was more frequent at 3 and 4 DAG but was still limited to very few cells
(Fig. 1K–M). Moreover, these PIN1::nYFP-expressing epidermal cells were not
those that contributed to convergence points of epidermal PIN1 polarity (Fig.
1M).
Because a fusion of the PIN1 coding sequence to GFP driven by the PIN1
promoter (PIN1::cPIN1:GFP) was hardly expressed in leaf epidermal cells (Fig.
2C,D,I,J), we conclude that the already limited activity of the PIN1 promoter in
the leaf epidermis is suppressed by the PIN1 coding sequence and that the leaf
epidermal expression characteristic of PIN1 is encoded in the gene’s introns.

During leaf development, PIN1 is expressed in all the tissues — the epidermis, the

tissues. To address this question, we expressed in the WT and pin1 mutant
backgrounds

(1) PIN1::gPIN1:GFP, which like PIN1::gPIN1:YFP and PIN1::gPIN1:CFP
(Fig. 1E–H,M) is expressed in all the tissues of the developing leaf (Fig.
2A,G);
(2) cPIN1:GFP driven by the epidermis-specific ARABIDOPSIS
THALIANA MERISTEM LAYER1 promoter (Sessions, Weigel, &
Yanofsky, 1999) (ATML1::cPIN1:GFP) (Fig. 2B,H);
(3) PIN1::cPIN1:GFP, which is expressed in the leaf inner tissues (Fig.
2C,D,I,J);
(4) cPIN1:GFP driven by the vascular-tissue-specific SHORT-ROOT
promoter (Gardiner, Donner, & Scarpella, 2011) (SHR::cPIN1:GFP) (Fig.
2E,K);
(5) cPIN1:GFP driven by the SCARECROW-LIKE32 promoter, which is
active in the nonvascular inner tissue of the leaf (Gardiner et al., 2011)
(SCL32::cPIN1:GFP) (Fig. 2F,L).
We then compared vein patterns of mature first leaves of the resulting
backgrounds.
Consistent with previous reports (Sawchuk et al., 2013; Verna et al., 2019),
the vein patterns of nearly 50% of pin1 leaves were abnormal (Fig. 2M–P). The
vein patterns of PIN1::gPIN1:GFP, ATML1::cPIN1:GFP, PIN1::cPIN1:GFP,
SHR::cPIN1:GFP, and SCL32::cPIN1:GFP were no different from the WT vein
pattern (Fig. 2M–P). Both PIN1::gPIN1:GFP and PIN1::cPIN1:GFP normalized
the phenotype spectrum of pin1 vein patterns (Fig. 2M–P; Fig. S1A,C).
SHR::cPIN1:GFP shifted the phenotype spectrum of pin1 vein patterns toward
the WT vein pattern (Fig. 2M–P; Fig. S1D). The vein pattern defects of
ATML1::cPIN1:GFP;pin1 and SCL32::cPIN1:GFP;pin1 were no different from
those of pin1 (Fig. 2M–P; Fig. S1B,E). We observed a similar effect of tissuespecific PIN1 expression in PIN1-dependent cotyledon patterning (Figure S2).
Consistent with interpretation of similar findings in other organisms (e.g.,
(Wisidagama, Thomas, Lam, & Thummel, 2019; Cherbas, Hu, Zhimulev,
Belyaeva, & Cherbas, 2003; Topalidou & Miller, 2017; Soloviev, Gallagher,
Marnef, & Kuwabara, 2011)), we conclude that PIN1 expression in the epidermis
is neither required nor sufficient for PIN1-dependent vein patterning. By contrast,
PIN1 expression in the inner tissues of the leaf is both required and sufficient for
PIN1-dependent vein patterning; such function of PIN1 expression seems to
mainly depend on PIN1 expression in the vascular tissue.

Expression of PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 During Vein Patterning
Collectively, PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 act redundantly with PIN1 in PIN1dependent vein patterning, and like PIN1 they are expressed in both epidermis
and inner tissues of young leaves (Verna et al., 2019). In those leaves, however,
the most reproducible features of the Arabidopsis vein pattern can already be
recognized (Donner, Sherr, & Scarpella, 2009; Gardiner, Sherr, & Scarpella, 2010;
Gardiner et al., 2011; Sawchuk et al., 2013; Donner & Scarpella, 2013; Verna,
Sawchuk, Linh, & Scarpella, 2015; Amalraj et al., 2019; Verna et al., 2019).
Therefore, to test the possibility that compensatory functions provided by PIN3,
PIN4, and PIN7 may account for the observation that PIN1 expression in the
epidermis is dispensable and that PIN1 expression in the inner tissues of the leaf
is sufficient for PIN1-dependent vein patterning, we first asked what the
expression were of PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 during vein patterning. To address this
question we imaged expression of PIN3::gPIN3:YFP, PIN4::gPIN4:YFP, and
PIN7::gPIN7:YFP in first leaves 2, 2.5, 3, and 4 DAG.
PIN3 Expression
At 2 DAG, PIN3::gPIN3:YFP was expressed in the abaxial epidermis, though
more strongly near its top, and in inner cells on the abaxial side of the primordium,
mainly at its bottom (Fig. 3A). At 2.5 DAG, PIN3::gPIN3:YFP was expressed in
the marginal epidermis, though more strongly near its top (Fig. 3B). Inner
expression was restricted to the top and bottom of the midvein and to and around
the top of the first loops. At 3 DAG, PIN3::gPIN3:YFP expression persisted in
the marginal epidermis, but strong expression had spread toward the bottom of
the primordium (Fig. 3C). Inner expression had spread to the whole midvein but
was stronger at its top and bottom; inner expression had also spread toward the
bottom of the primordium but was stronger in and around the first loops. At 4
DAG, PIN3::gPIN3:YFP expression continued to persist in the marginal
epidermis, but strong expression had spread to the whole lamina (Fig. 3D). Inner
expression persisted in the midvein and remained stronger at its top and bottom;
furthermore, inner expression had spread to the entire lamina but was stronger in
and around loops and minor veins.
PIN4 Expression
At 2 DAG, PIN4::gPIN4:YFP was expressed in both the adaxial and abaxial
epidermis, though more strongly at the top of the primordium (Fig. 3E). Inner
expression was restricted to the bottom of the midvein and to very few cells

scattered across the primordium. At 2.5 DAG, PIN4::gPIN4:YFP was expressed
in the marginal epidermis, though more strongly at its top (Fig. 3F). Inner
expression persisted at the bottom of the midvein and in very few cells scattered
across the primordium. At 3 DAG, PIN4::gPIN4:YFP expression persisted in the
marginal epidermis, though expression was stronger at its top and bottom (Fig.
3G). Inner expression had spread to the whole midvein and to small groups of cells
scattered across the primordium. At 4 DAG, PIN4::gPIN4:YFP continued to be
expressed in the marginal epidermis, but expression had become more
homogeneous (Fig. 3H). Inner expression persisted in the midvein and had spread
to and around loops and larger groups of cells scattered across the lamina.
PIN7 Expression
At 2 DAG, PIN7::gPIN7:YFP was expressed in the abaxial epidermis and in inner
cells on the abaxial side of the primordium (Fig. 3I). At 2.5 DAG,
PIN7::gPIN7:YFP was expressed at the bottom of the midvein (Fig. 3J). At 3
DAG, PIN7::gPIN7:YFP became expressed in the marginal epidermis, though
expression was stronger near the top of the primordium (Fig. 3K). Inner expression
had spread to the whole midvein but was stronger at its top and bottom; inner
expression had also spread to and around the first loops, though expression was
stronger at their top. At 4 DAG, PIN7::gPIN7:YFP expression had spread to the
whole marginal epidermis but was weaker at its bottom (Fig. 3L). Inner expression
persisted in the midvein and remained stronger at its top and bottom; furthermore,
inner expression had spread to the whole lamina, though expression was stronger
in and around loops and minor veins.
⁂
In conclusion, during vein patterning PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 are collectively
expressed in the epidermis, in developing veins, and — more weakly — in the
nonvascular inner tissue of the leaf.

Tissue-Specific PIN1 Expression in PIN1 Redundant Functions
in Vein Patterning
Collectively, PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 act redundantly with PIN1 in PIN1dependent vein patterning (Verna et al., 2019), and they are expressed in the leaf
epidermis and inner tissues during vein patterning (Figure 3). Therefore, to test
the possibility that compensatory functions provided by PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7
may account for the observation that PIN1 expression in the epidermis is

dispensable and that PIN1 expression in the inner tissues of the leaf is sufficient
for PIN1-dependent vein patterning, we next expressed in the pin3;pin4;pin7
(pin3;4;7 hereafter) and pin1,3;4;7 mutant backgrounds
(1) PIN1::gPIN1:GFP, which is expressed in all the tissues of the developing
leaf (Fig. 4A,G);
(2) ATML1::cPIN1:GFP, which is only expressed in the epidermis (Fig.
4B,H);
(3) PIN1::cPIN1:GFP, which is expressed in the leaf inner tissues (Fig.
4C,D,I,J);
(4) SHR::cPIN1:GFP, which is only expressed in the vascular tissue (Fig.
4E,K);
(5) SCL32::cPIN1:GFP, which is expressed in the nonvascular inner tissue of
the leaf (Fig. 4F,L).
We then compared vein patterns of mature first leaves of the resulting
backgrounds.
As previously shown (Verna et al., 2019), the vein pattern of pin3;4;7 was no
different from that of WT, and none of the pin1,3;4;7 leaves had a WT vein
pattern (Fig. 4M–P). The vein patterns of PIN1::gPIN1:GFP;pin3;4;7,
ATML1::cPIN1:GFP;pin3;4;7,
PIN1::cPIN1:GFP;pin3;4;7,
SHR::cPIN1:GFP;pin3;4;7, and SCL32::cPIN1:GFP;pin3;4;7 were no different
from the WT vein pattern (Fig. 4M–P). Both PIN1::gPIN1:GFP and
PIN1::cPIN1:GFP normalized the phenotype spectrum of pin1,3;4;7 vein patterns
(Fig. 4M–P; Fig. S3A,C). SHR::cPIN1:GFP shifted the phenotype spectrum of
pin1,3;4;7 vein patterns toward the WT vein network pattern, to match the
phenotype spectrum of pin1 vein patterns (Fig. 4M–P; Fig. S3D; cf. Fig. 2M–P).
The

pattern
defects
of
ATML1::cPIN1:GFP;pin1,3;4;7
and
SCL32::cPIN1:GFP;pin3;4;7 were no different from those of pin1,3;4;7 (Fig. 4M–
P; Fig. S3B,E). We observed a similar effect of tissue-specific PIN1 expression on
that component of cotyledon patterning that depends on PIN1, PIN3, PIN4, and
PIN7 (Figure S4).
Therefore, that PIN1 expression in the epidermis is dispensable and that PIN1
expression in the inner tissues of the leaf is sufficient for PIN1-dependent vein
patterning cannot be accounted for by compensatory functions provided by PIN3,
PIN4, and PIN7. Such compensatory functions are also unlikely provided by the
remaining PIN proteins, by the ABCB1 and ABCB19 auxin efflux carriers, or by

the AUX1/LAX auxin influx carriers because none of these proteins are either
expressed in the epidermis or have functions in vein patterning, whether in WT
or in auxin-transport-inhibited leaves (Verna et al., 2015; Sawchuk et al., 2013;
Verna et al., 2019). As such, we conclude that PIN1 expression in the epidermis
is dispensable for auxin-transport-dependent vein patterning. This conclusion is
consistent with the observation that cup-shaped cotyledon2 mutants lack
convergent points of epidermal PIN1 polarity and yet have normal vein patterns
(Bilsborough et al., 2011). By contrast, PIN1 expression in inner tissues is required
and sufficient for auxin-transport-dependent vein patterning; such function of
PIN1 expression seems to mainly depend on PIN1 expression in the vascular tissue.
In conclusion, vein patterning hypotheses based on polar auxin transport from
the epidermis (reviewed in (Runions, Smith, & Prusinkiewicz, 2014; Prusinkiewicz
& Runions, 2012); see also (Alim & Frey, 2010; Hartmann et al., 2019), and
references therein) are unsupported by experimental evidence. Our results do not
rule out an influence of the epidermis on vein patterning, for example through
local auxin production (e.g., (Abley, Sauret-Gueto, Maree, & Coen, 2016)), but
they do exclude that such influence is brought about by polar auxin transport.
Alternatively, patterning of local epidermal features, such as peaks of auxin
production or response, and of the processes that depend on those features may
be mediated by auxin transport in underlying tissues; there is evidence for such
possibility (e.g., (Deb, Marti, Frenz, Kuhlemeier, & Reinhardt, 2015)), and our
results are consistent with that evidence. In the future, it will be interesting to
test these and other possibilities, but already now our results refute all the vein
patterning hypotheses that depend on polar auxin transport from the epidermis.

Plants
Origin and nature of lines, genotyping strategies, and oligonucleotide sequences
are in Tables S1, S2, and S3, respectively. Seeds were sterilized and sown as in
(Sawchuk, Donner, Head, & Scarpella, 2008). Stratified seeds were germinated and
seedlings were grown at 22°C under continuous fluorescent light (~80 µmol m-2s1
). Plants were grown at 25°C under fluorescent light (~100 μmol m-2s-1) in a 16h-light/8-h-dark cycle. Plants were transformed and representative lines were
selected as in (Sawchuk et al., 2008).

Imaging
Developing leaves were mounted and YFP was imaged as in (Sawchuk et al.,
2013). CFP, YFP, and autofluorescence were imaged as in (Sawchuk et al., 2013).
GFP and autofluorescence were imaged as in (Amalraj et al., 2019). Images were
stacked, aligned with the Scale Invariant Feature Transform algorithm (Lowe,
2004), and maximum-intensity projection was applied to aligned image stacks in
the Fiji distribution (Schindelin et al., 2012) of ImageJ (Schneider, Rasband, &
Eliceiri, 2012; Schindelin, Rueden, Hiner, & Eliceiri, 2015; Rueden et al., 2017).
Mature leaves were fixed in ethanol : acetic acid 6 : 1, rehydrated in 70% ethanol
and water, and mounted in chloral hydrate : glycerol : water 8 : 2 : 1. Mounted
leaves were imaged as in (Odat et al., 2014). Greyscaled RGB color images were
turned into 8-bit images, and image brightness and contrast were adjusted by
linear stretching of the histogram in the Fiji distribution of ImageJ.
