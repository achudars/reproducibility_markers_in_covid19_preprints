SUMMARY
While many neuronal membrane-anchored proteins undergo proteolytic cleavage, little is known about
the biological significance of neuronal ectodomain shedding. Using mass spectrometry (MS)-based
proteomics, we showed that the neuronal sheddome mirrors human cerebrospinal fluid (hCSF). Among
shed synaptic proteins in hCSF was the ectodomain of CNTNAP2 (CNTNAP2-ecto), a risk factor for
neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). Using structured-illumination microscopy (SIM), we mapped the
spatial organization of neuronal CNTNAP2-ecto shedding. Using affinity chromatography followed by
MS, we identified the ATP2B/PMCA Ca2+ extrusion pumps as novel CNTNAP2-ecto binding partners.
CNTNAP2-ecto coimmunoprecipitates with PMCA2, a known autism risk factor, and enhances its
activity, thereby modulating neuronal Ca2+ levels. Finally, we showed that CNTNAP2-ecto regulates
neuronal network synchrony in primary cultures and brain slices. These data provide new insights into
the biology of synaptic ectodomain shedding and reveal a novel mechanism of regulation of Ca2+
homeostasis and neuronal network synchrony.

INTRODUCTION
Numerous transmembrane proteins undergo proteolytic processing, resulting in the release of a soluble
extracellular fragment in a process called ectodomain shedding. Ectodomain shedding plays a
widespread role in development and disease, including in the central nervous system (Lichtenthaler et
al., 2018). Conversely, dysregulation of ectodomain shedding is linked to diseases, including
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Haass et al., 2012) and inflammation (McIlwain et al., 2012).
The physiological functions of ectodomain shedding are only beginning to be uncovered, particularly
because the functions of most shed ectodomains are not known. For synaptic cell adhesion molecules
(CAMs), proteolytic cleavage is generally thought to terminate adhesion, causing loss of cell-cell
contacts and synapse weakening (Malinverno et al., 2010). Remarkably, ectodomains of some synaptic
proteins participate in pathogenesis or have protective effects in disease conditions (Venkatesh et al.,
2017; Yao et al., 2015). This suggests broader roles of synaptic ectodomains in pathogenic processes
which remain to be explored.
The CSF is one of the few sources of proteins derived from the brain of living humans; hence it has the
potential to offer a readout of brain physiopathology. Synaptic transmembrane proteins have been
detected in the CSF (Pigoni et al., 2016), suggesting the CSF could be a source for biomarkers of
synapse function or pathology in the brain. However, the relationship of the neuronal and, more
specifically, the synaptic sheddome to the CSF has not yet been systematically investigated.
Disease-linked mutations in several synaptic membrane-anchored proteins predictably trigger a soluble
secreted ectodomain. One such molecule is encoded by the CNTNAP2 gene. Gene dosage, rare
mutations, and common variations in CNTNAP2 have been associated with several syndromal
neurodevelopmental disorders sharing symptoms of epilepsy, intellectual disability (ID), ASD, and
language impairment (Poot, 2015). The CNTNAP2 gene encodes contactin associated protein like 2
(Caspr2 or CNTNAP2), which is abundant in the brain and it is enriched at synapses (Bakkaloglu et al.,
2008). Moreover, CNTNAP2 also has a role in neuronal connectivity and synchrony. CNTNAP2
polymorphisms disrupt brain connectivity (Scott-Van Zeeland et al., 2010). Synchronized network
activity plays key roles during several stages of brain development, in sensory processing, motor
control, and cognition (Uhlhaas and Singer, 2010). However, the molecular mechanisms regulating
network synchrony are yet to be fully understood.

Here we hypothesized that proteomic analysis of the CSF and neuronal sheddomes could reveal novel
synaptic regulators and functions. We showed that the neuronal sheddome is mirrored in hCSF and is
enriched in adhesion and synapse regulatory molecules, as well as neurodevelopmental disorder risk
molecules. We detected CNTNAP2 in hCSF and showed that it undergoes synaptic activity-dependent
ectodomain shedding. We found that the ectodomain of CNTNAP2 (CNTNAP2-ecto) binds to and
activates the ATP2B/PMCA Ca2+ pump and modulates neuronal network synchrony. Taken together,
our data provide new insight into the biology of synaptic ectodomain shedding and reveal a novel
mechanism of regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis and neuronal network synchrony.

RESULTS
The neuronal sheddome is mirrored in the CSF and is enriched in neurodevelopmental disorder
risk factors
While proteomic analyses of cellular secretomes and sheddomes have been performed (Brown et al.,
2013; Tien et al., 2017), the neuronal sheddome has not been systematically analyzed, and its
relationship with the CSF proteome has not been investigated. While the term “secretome” refers to all
proteins found in the extracellular milieu of a given biological sample, the “sheddome” is the subset of
proteins found in the secretome that undergo ectodomain shedding and thus originally possess a
transmembrane domain or a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor.
To gain biological insight into the neuronal sheddome, we analyzed a previous dataset from secretome
protein enrichment with click sugars and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS) analysis of media from cultured neurons. To determine the subset of proteins that undergo
ectodomain shedding, we overlapped this dataset with proteins that are bound to the cell membrane
(i.e., contain at least one transmembrane domain or a GPI anchor, based on UniProt). We identified
178 proteins likely to undergo ectodomain shedding, defined as the “neuronal sheddome” (Fig.1A). To
gain insight into their biological functions, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. The most
enriched biological processes were “positive regulation of synapse assembly” and “cell adhesion”.
To identify proteins in the CSF that potentially undergo ectodomain shedding, we performed LC-MS/MS
analysis of human CSF (hCSF) and detected 1416 proteins. We overlapped it with a dataset of
membrane-anchored proteins, using the same filtering method as for the neuronal secretome, yielding
472 proteins, the "CSF sheddome" (Fig.1B). GO analysis of these proteins revealed "cell adhesion"

and "axon guidance" as the most significantly enriched biological processes. However, GO analysis of
soluble proteins in the neuronal secretome and the hCSF showed an enrichment in “extracellular matrix
organization” and “platelet degranulation” related proteins (Fig.S1D). When analyzed by number of
proteins per biological process, cell adhesion was the most highly represented in the three datasets we
analyzed: the neuronal sheddome, and two hCSF datasets (Fig.S1F).
Next, we examined the disease profiles of the in vitro neuronal secretome and the hCSF proteome. We
overlapped either the membrane-anchored or the secreted proteins from both datasets with
neurodevelopmental disorder-specific genes compiled from de novo exonic mutations, which implicate
individual genes with particular disorders. Remarkably, proteins encoding ASD susceptibility genes
were enriched in the neuronal sheddome, but not in the secreted components of the neuronal
secretome (Fig.1C). Similarly, ASD and SZ risk gene-encoded proteins were enriched in the cleaved,
but not in the secreted CSF fraction (Fig.1D). To corroborate the enrichment in ASD-related genes, we
performed the same analysis using the gene list annotated by SFARI. We found again an enrichment
for ASD-related molecules from SFARI in the membrane-anchored protein datasets, but not in the
soluble protein datasets (Fig.S1E). This indicates that specifically ectodomain shedding, but not
secretion of soluble proteins, may be implicated in ASD. We cross-validated these findings by
performing GO and disease-profile analyses on an already published hCSF sheddome dataset with
consistent results (Fig.S1A-B).
This analysis suggests that the CSF could mirror the neuronal sheddome, as they show similar GO and
disease profiles. Corroborating this idea, hypergeometric testing showed a highly significant overlap
between the neuronal and CSF sheddome datasets (Fig.1E and Fig.S1C). To specifically define the
synaptic sheddome observable in the CSF, we overlapped the CSF sheddome with the postsynaptic
density (PSD) proteome and found that 111 of 1408 PSD proteins (~8%) were detected in the CSF
sheddome (Fig.1F).
To gain insight into molecular and disease pathways within the synaptic sheddome present in hCSF,
we built a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network (Fig.1G). This PPI network includes several
neurodevelopmental disorder-associated synaptic molecules known to undergo ectodomain shedding
(such as NRXN1/3, NLGN2), but also many proteins not yet reported to undergo ectodomain shedding,
including CNTNAP2. This highlights the paucity of information on ectodomain shedding and suggests

that analysis of the CSF could be a reasonable strategy to investigate synaptic ectodomain shedding
in humans.

CNTNAP2 undergoes activity-dependent ectodomain shedding
To further explore the hypothesis that the synaptic sheddome detectable in hCSF can reveal novel
biological mechanisms, we focused our investigation on CNTNAP2, previously unknown to undergo
ectodomain shedding.
We first validated the presence of CNTNAP2-ecto in hCSF and mouse CSF (mCSF) by western blotting
(WB), using antibodies against the extracellular N-terminal (N-term) region and the intracellular Cterminal (C-term) region (Fig.2A). The N-term was present in both hCSF and mCSF, with a molecular
weight just below that of the full-length protein containing the C-term region, suggesting cleavage of
the protein to produce CNTNAP2-ecto (Fig.2B). The same band was also present in mouse cortex
soluble fraction, but was absent from Cntnap2 KO mouse brain homogenate (Fig.2C). The shorter Nterm segment of CNTNAP2 was detected in whole cell lysates and extracellular media from WT but not
Cntnap2 KO mouse cortical neuronal cultures (Fig.2D). CNTNAP2 ectodomain shedding was also
corroborated in HEK293 cells transfected with exogenous CNTNAP2 (Fig.S2A). Together, these data
show that soluble CNTNAP2-ecto is present in CSF, in mouse brain, and in vitro in neuronal media.

CNTNAP2-ecto levels increased in media of cultured neurons from week 1 to 4, as neurons and
synapses mature (Fig.2E). The amount of CNTNAP2-ecto in the media paralleled that of full-length
CNTNAP2 in whole cell lysates, indicating that its increased shedding was due to increased overall
protein levels.
We then asked whether CNTNAP2 was cleaved at the plasma membrane. Incubation of rat neurons
with the endocytosis inhibitor dynasore significantly increased CNTNAP2-ecto in the media. As
inhibiting endocytosis increases surface levels of plasma membrane proteins, this indicates that
CNTNAP2 cleavage occurs at the cell surface (Fig.2F).
Because cleavage of several other synaptic adhesion molecules is regulated by synaptic activity
(Suzuki et al., 2012), we examined the effect of chemical LTP (cLTP) on CNTNAP2-ecto production.
cLTP of week 4 neuronal cultures resulted in a strong increase in CNTNAP2-ecto in the neuronal media
(Fig.2G), indicating that CNTNAP2-ecto shedding is up-regulated during synaptic potentiation. cLTP6

dependent ectodomain shedding required both NMDA and AMPA receptor activity, as it was blocked
by both aminophosphonovalerate (APV) and NBQX (Fig.2H).
We next used different protease inhibitors to identify the protease responsible for CNTNAP2 cleavage.
cLTP-induced CNTNAP2 ectodomain shedding was blocked by TAPI-0, which inhibits several MMPs
and TACE (Fig.2I). In addition, the general MMP inhibitor GM6001 significantly reduced cLTP-induced
CNTNAP2 cleavage (Fig.2I), implicating MMPs in activity-dependent CNTNAP2 cleavage. As only
MMP3 and 9 are highly expressed in cortex, and MMP9’s activity is known to be up-regulated by LTP,
we performed a dose-response curve using MMP9 inhibitor I. This inhibitor blocked cLTP-dependent
CNTNAP2-ecto shedding in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.2J), indicating that MMP9
mediates activity-dependent CNTNAP2-ecto shedding. These results were validated in CNTNAP2transfected N2a cells, where GM6001, TAPI-0 and MMP9 inhibitor inhibited CNTNAP2 ectodomain
shedding (Fig.S2B).
We then tested whether activity-induced CNTNAP2 cleavage occurs at synaptic sites by subcellular
fractionation. We observed a decrease of CNTNAP2 levels in the synaptic fraction after cLTP and no
change in the extrasynaptic fraction (Fig.2K), indicating that CNTNAP2 occurs in the synaptic region.

Spatial organization of CNTNAP2 ectodomain shedding
To examine the distribution of CNTNAP2-ecto in situ, we sparsely transfected cortical neurons
generated from Cntnap2 KO mice with a distal N-terminally flag-tagged CNTNAP2 along with GFP
(Fig.3A). We detected abundant exogenous Flag-CNTNAP2 in soma of individual neurons, as well as
in dendrites and spines (Fig.3A-B). Flag-CNTNAP2 immunofluorescence could also be detected
outside the neurons, not overlapping with GFP, as shown by line scans (Fig.3B).
To further enhance the spatial resolution, we used structured illumination microscopy (SIM) to visualize
the relative distribution of the N- and C-termini of transfected Flag-CNTNAP2 in GFP-expressing
neurons generated from Cntnap2 KO mice (Fig.3C). In total, 55% of CNTNAP2-ecto was found within
the GFP signal and the rest was found outside (Fig.S3A). CNTNAP2 N- and C-terminal
immunofluorescence colocalized inside dendrites and spines, but not outside, and N-terminal
immunofluorescence was detected outside neurons, often near spines and dendrites (Fig.3C) as well
as axons and synaptic boutons (Fig.S3B), consistent with it being cleaved and deposited in the
extracellular space surrounding neurons.

To examine the spatial organization of activity-dependent CNTNAP2 ectodomain shedding, we used
SIM to visualize the distribution of the N- and the C-termini of CNTNAP2 in GFP-expressing Cntnap2
KO neurons subjected to cLTP (Fig.3D). We analyzed the overlap of CNTNAP2-ecto (presence of Ntermini but absence of C-termini) relative to the neuronal structure, outlined by GFP fluorescence. We
found no difference in the area occupied or the number of CNTNAP2-ecto puncta within the GFP signal
between control and cLTP-treated neurons (Fig.3E-F). However, analyzing the same parameters in the
synaptic compartment, defined as the overlap between GFP and the presynaptic marker vGLUT1, we
found that upon cLTP, both the area occupied and the number of CNTNAP2-ecto of puncta significantly
decreased in the synaptic region (Fig.3E, G). These data suggest that CNTNAP2-ecto, produced
postsynaptically upon cLTP, diffuses away from synaptic regions, likely in a paracrine fashion.

CNTNAP2-ecto affinity-MS identifies PMCA2 as a novel interacting partner
Notably, only two ligands of CNTNAP2-extracellular domain are known, CNTN1 and CNTN2 (Poliak et
al., 2003; Rubio-Marrero et al., 2016). Because a few reports also identified signaling roles for
ectodomains, we hypothesized that shed CNTNAP2-ecto may act as a ligand for unidentified
transmembrane proteins. We used a combination of CNTNAP2-ecto affinity chromatography with a
proteomic protocol that couples affinity purification with LC-MS/MS and bioinformatics analysis
(Fig.4A). We generated a recombinant flag-tagged CNTNAP2-ecto bait protein from the supernatants
of CNTNAP2-transfected HEK293 cell cultures. SYPRO ruby staining of the recombinant CNTNAP2ecto and vehicle control revealed high purity of the purified CNTNAP2-ecto (Fig.4B). Moreover, MS
analysis of tryptic peptide digestion of the purified CNTNAP2-ecto identified peptides corresponding
only to the extracellular domain, indicating little or no contamination with full-length protein (Fig.4C). To
identify proteins interacting with the CNTNAP2-ecto, we incubated the Flag-CNTNAP2-ecto or vehicle
control with mouse cortical membranes. Affinity-purified proteins were comprehensively analyzed by
LC-MS/MS. To sort the identified proteins, we rank-ordered the prey proteins detected in descending
order on the basis of the number of normalized spectral counts. The fold enrichment of each prey
protein was calculated by subtracting the number of spectral counts in the sample containing the
bait minus the sample containing the vehicle control, this value was then divided by the total number
of spectral counts obtained for CNTNAP2-ecto. As expected, the bait protein was the most abundant
protein present. We also detected CNTN1 as a very abundant affinity-isolated protein, validating our
approach (Fig.4D). In addition, all four members of the PMCA/ATP2B family of Ca2+ transporters were
highly abundant among CNTNAP2-ecto interacting proteins (Fig.4E). Because PMCA2 showed a high

enrichment and because it has been implicated in ASD (Takata et al., 2018), we investigated its
interaction with CNTNAP2-ecto.
To validate the interaction, we applied purified CNTNAP2-ecto or vehicle control to mouse cortical
membrane fractions, and used flag-agarose beads to pull down CNTNAP2-ecto, followed by detection
of co-purified PMCA2 by WB (Fig.4F). To corroborate this finding, we incubated purified WT and 1253*
CNTNAP2-ecto or vehicle with lysates of PMCA2-transfected or untransfected HEK293 cells, and
detected the interaction by WB (Fig.4G and Fig.S4A). Moreover, confocal images of dissociated rat
cortical neurons showed colocalization of PMCA2 and CNTNAP2 (Fig.S4B). To determine if absence
of CNTNAP2 impacted the developmental time course of PMCA2 expression, we compared the protein
levels of PMCA2 in WT and Cntnap2 KO mouse cortex and found a significant reduction in PMCA2
levels in the KO cortex at P28 (Fig.S4C). These experiments suggest that PMCA2 is a novel
endogenous CNTNAP2-ecto binding partner.
CNTNAP2-ecto activates Ca2+ extrusion in neurons and acute brain slices
PMCA2 regulates cytosolic Ca2+ by extruding it into the extracellular space with the concomitant
hydrolysis of ATP. To investigate directly whether CNTNAP2-ecto regulates the Ca2+ pump activity of
PMCA2, we expressed exogenous PMCA2 in HEK293 cells, loaded them with the fluorescent Ca2+
sensitive dye Fura-2, and incubated them with CNTNAP2-ecto or vehicle control for 5 min (Fig.4H).
Immediately after, we treated the cultures with 0.5 mM ATP to elicit a cytosolic Ca2+ signal (Fig.4I and
Fig.S4G). CNTNAP2-ecto reduced the t1/2 off of the Ca2+ peak by ~ 50%, without affecting nontransfected HEK293 cells (Fig.4J, K). However, neither the Ca2+ peak amplitude (Fig.S4G) nor the tauon
(Fig.4J) were affected by the CNTNAP2-ecto. This indicates that CNTNAP2-ecto specifically increases
the speed of Ca2+ extrusion by PMCA2.
We then assessed the effect of CNTNAP2-ecto on neurons transfected with the Ca2+ indicator
GCamP6s and the cell fill DsRedExpress2 to check for cell health (Fig.5A). We first performed a
concentration response curve, finding that 10 nM is the CNTNAP2-ecto concentration exerting the
strongest effect in Ca2+ extrusion (Fig.S5B). Incubation with CNTNAP2-ecto for 5 min decreased by
30% the t1/2 off of the KCl-induced Ca2+ signal (Fig.5A-C), without affecting the tauon or the amplitude
(Fig.5C and Fig.S5C). We then checked if the observed effect is specific to inhibitory or pyramidal
neurons, finding that the most consistent effect occurs in excitatory neurons (Fig.S5D). These data

indicate that CNTNAP2-ecto specifically regulates the extrusion phase of the Ca2+ signal in primary
neurons.
To investigate the effect of CNTNAP2-ecto in the context of native tissue with preserved cellular
populations and networks, we measured Ca2+ dynamics after KCl-evoked Ca2+ responses in acute
brain slices, imaging in layer V of the M2 region of the cortex (Fig.5D and E). We loaded slices with the
cytosolic Ca2+ sensor Cal520-AM and the glial red dye SR-101 to discard the signal originating from
glial cells, incubated them with CNTNAP2-ecto (Fig.5D), and imaged KCl-evoked Ca2+ signals
(SuppVideo1). As in cultured neurons and HEK293 cells, CNTNAP2-ecto decreased the t1/2 off by 22%
without affecting the tauon and the Ca2+ amplitude (Fig.5F-G). CNTNAP2-ecto thus enhances Ca2+
extrusion in acute brain slices.

CNTNAP2-ecto regulates synchrony in neuronal networks in vitro and in acute brain slices
In order to understand the impact that this newly discovered effect of CNTNAP2-ecto on Ca2+
homeostasis could have at the circuit level, we investigated how exposure to exogenous CNTNAP2ecto affected coordinated patterns of Ca2+ signaling or Ca2+ synchrony. We first examined the effect of
CNTNAP2-ecto on network activity in rat neurons in vitro by imaging the spontaneous Ca2+ transients
or oscillations of cytoplasmic [Ca2+], using the Ca2+ dye Fluo-4 (Fig.6A). After normalizing the average
somatic Ca2+ fluorescence for hundreds of neurons per coverslip, Ca2+ transients were automatically
detected/defined in an unbiased manner using a custom-made Matlab routine (Fig.S6). Both vehicleand CNTNAP2-ecto-treated neurons displayed synchronized network events (Fig.6B); however,
CNTNAP2-ecto incubation led to a 25% decrease in the fraction of synchronized transients (Fig.6C,
D), without changing the transient frequency (Fig.6E). By measuring the amplitude of the Ca2+ peaks
within and outside of the synchrony windows, we observed an increase in the Ca2+ peak amplitude
during network synchrony that was lost after CNTNAP2-ecto exposure (Fig.6F). This indicates that
CNTNAP2-ecto suppresses the synchrony of Ca2+ firing and as a result, reduces the potentiation on
the Ca2+ peak amplitude that occurs in synchronized events at a network level.
To investigate whether CNTNAP2-ecto could also alter neuronal Ca2+ patterns in a preparation with
intact circuitry, we examined spontaneous neuronal activity in acute brain slices from P5-P7 mice
(Fig.6G-O). We imaged network events by two-photon microscopy in the CA3 region of the
hippocampus with bath application of modified artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). In agreement with
previous studies (Bonifazi et al., 2009), vehicle-treated slices exhibited regular network events (Fig.6H10

I, SuppVideo2). Remarkably, CNTNAP2-ecto incubation decreased the fraction of peaks localized
inside these synchronized events by 30% (Fig.6J-K). This difference was not associated with any
significant changes in Ca2+ signal frequency or amplitude (Fig.6L-M). A fundamental aspect of neuronal
networks is their ability to form functional assemblies of co-active cells, essential for cognitive processes
and response to external stimuli. We analyzed these ensembles by measuring the percentage of coactive neurons during synchronized network events and, interestingly, these were reduced by 34.3%
when treated with CNTNAP2-ecto (Fig.6N, O). In summary, CNTNAP2-ecto alters the neuronal network
behavior in brain slices by desynchronizing neuronal firing.

DISCUSSION
The neuronal sheddome is mirrored in the CSF and is enriched in neurodevelopmental disorder
risk factors
Here we present a global bioinformatics characterization of the neuronal sheddome and show that it is
closely mirrored in the CSF. We found that both the neuronal sheddome and CSF are enriched in
adhesion and synaptic proteins, as well as in neurodevelopmental disorder risk molecules. While
ectodomain shedding by individual synaptic molecules has been reported, the sheddome comprised of
synaptic proteins has not been systematically analyzed, and its relationship with the CSF proteome, as
well as the representation of neurodevelopmental disorder risk factors in the synaptic sheddome, have
not been investigated. Our findings thus provide novel insight into the neurobiology of ectodomain
shedding.

Neurodevelopmental disorder risk factor CNTNAP2 undergoes synaptic activity-dependent
ectodomain shedding
Proteomic profiling of the rodent neuronal sheddome in vitro and hCSF revealed that the prominent
neurodevelopmental disorder risk factor CNTNAP2 undergoes synaptic activity-dependent ectodomain
shedding mediated by MMP9, and it can be detected in hCSF. CNTNAP2 ectodomain shedding has
not been reported before and may represent a mechanism of intercellular signaling. This indicates that
proteolytically-cleaved cell-cell adhesion membrane proteins could function as signaling molecules.
SIM microscopy showed that CNTNAP2-ecto was often present outside of the neurons, sometimes at
a considerable distance. Upon cLTP we observed a decrease in the amount of CNTNAP2-ecto in
synaptic regions, similar to what was observed biochemically, consistent with ectodomain shedding

occurring at synaptic sites. Notably, a recent article reported that postynaptically-released neurexin-1
binds to presynaptic UNC-2/CaV2 Ca2+ channels and reduces acetylcholine release at the
neuromuscular juction (Tong et al., 2017).

PMCA2 is a novel binding partner of CNTNAP2-ecto
Using affinity purification combined with MS proteomics, we identified novel targets of CNTNAP2-ecto,
including the Ca2+ pump PMCA2. Currently, only two extracellular CNTNAP2 ligands are known, CNTN1 and -2 (Poliak et al., 2003; Rubio-Marrero et al., 2016). Interaction of CNTNAP2-ecto with several
PMCAs indicates that Ca2+ signaling is a major target of CNTNAP2 ectodomain signaling, and reveals
a novel mechanism for the regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis by shed ectodomains.
Accurate control of intracellular Ca2+ is crucial for neuronal function. The plasma membrane Ca2+ATPase (PMCA) family of Ca2+ pumps are the major high-affinity Ca2+ extrusion pathway in spines
(Scheuss et al., 2006). CNTNAP2-ecto enhances Ca2+ extrusion through PMCAs, and may thus control
local or global Ca2+ transients by shaping their duration and spread. Among PMCAs, PMCA2 is widely
distributed throughout the brain (Fig.S4D) and is present both pre- and postsynaptically (Burette and
Weinberg, 2007).
A shed ectodomain regulates neuronal Ca2+ spikes and network synchrony
We show for the first time that neuronal synchrony is regulated by a shed ectodomain, through a novel
mechanism of regulation of Ca2+ dynamics. Neural network synchrony plays key roles during several
stages of brain development (Marin, 2016), in sensory processing, motor control, and cognition
(Uhlhaas and Singer, 2010).
A brief activity-regulated increase of CNTNAP2-ecto could mediate feedback inhibition in response to
a short period of high activity, such as following LTP, to reestablish normal activity levels, to prevent
over-excitation and excessive synchrony. Alternatively, it may modulate activity-dependent shaping of
oscillations, for example during sensory processing. Consistent with this, Cntnap2 KO mice show
altered network activity and have seizures (Penagarikano et al., 2011).
Mechanistically, we propose that CNTNAP2-ecto activates PMCA pumps and enhances cellular Ca2+
extrusion. Remarkably, even moderate changes in Ca2+ kinetics are known to have an impact on the

The synaptic sheddome as a potential source of biomarkers and players in pathogenesis
We show that the CSF mirrors the neuronal sheddome, potentially providing access to the extrasynaptic
milieu in the brain. CSF could provide insight into normal and pathophysiological processes in the brain,
and has been proposed as a source of novel biomarkers. For example, in neurodegenerative disorders
including ALS, Parkinson’s, and AD, elevated levels of synaptic proteins in the CSF is thought to reflect
synapse loss (Bereczki et al., 2017; Kester et al., 2015). Similarly, elevated levels of L1, NCAM, and
p75NTR ectodomains have been detected in the CSF in AD (Jiao et al., 2015; Strekalova et al., 2006),
ICAM5 in acute encephalitis (Lindsberg et al., 2002), and NCAM in SZ (Vawter et al., 2001). In contrast,
because its shedding is activity-dependent, altered levels of CNTNAP2-ecto in the CSF could reflect
alterations in activity in brain regions enriched in CNTNAP2.
Ectodomain shedding can be affected by disease-associated mutations, providing a new pathogenic
mechanism for neurodevelopmental disorders. Of particular interest is the presence of the same
homozygous truncating point mutation (I1253X) in several members of an old-order Amish population
with cortical dysplasia focal epilepsy (CDFE), along with learning, language, and social deficits. In a
cellular system, this mutation results in a secreted protein with a sequence nearly identical to native
CNTNAP2-ecto (Falivelli et al., 2012).
Some of the synaptic protein ectodomains we have detected may participate in pathogenesis or have
therapeutic utility. For example, activity-dependent shedding of neuroligin-3 promotes glioma
proliferation (Venkatesh et al., 2017). Similarly, excessive CNTNAP2-ecto could promote pathogenesis
by desynchronizing networks. On the other hand, the p75NTR ectodomain is neuroprotective against
amyloid-beta toxicity in AD (Yao et al., 2015). Similarly, future CNTNAP2-ecto-based therapies could
prevent seizures, modulate intracellular Ca2+, and activate PMCAs in PMCA-associated disorders.
Ca2+ extrusion and neuronal synchrony in neurodevelopmental disorders
We show that PMCAs are novel binding partners for CNTNAP2-ecto. PMCAs have been associated
with autism, ataxia, deafness, and cardiovascular disease. Specifically, PMCA2 has been implicated in
ASD (Takata et al., 2018). We found a reduction in PMCA2 levels in the Cntnap2 KO mice cortex at
P28. Interestingly, a reduction in the protein levels of PMCA2 has been observed in postmortem brain
tissue from ASD patients (Voineagu et al., 2011). Moreover, decreased gene expression of ATP2B2
has also been observed in lymphoblasts of autism patients (Stafford et al., 2017).

We show that CNTNAP2-ecto modulates neuronal network synchrony. Alterations in neuronal
synchrony are thought to occur in ASD, SZ, (Mathalon and Sohal, 2015) and epileptic seizures
(McCormick and Contreras, 2001), disorders associated with CNTNAP2 genetic variation. Abnormal
synchrony has been reported in multiple mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders, including
Cntnap2 KO (Penagarikano et al., 2011), Fmrp (Goncalves et al., 2013), 22q11 deletion (Sigurdsson
et al., 2010), and neuroligin 3 R451C (Gutierrez et al., 2009), suggesting that abnormal synchrony is a
common pathophysiological mechanism in neurodevelopmental disorders.
As such, abnormal levels of CNTNAP2-ecto, either caused by anomalous CNTNAP2 expression or
shedding, could lead to altered synchrony, or alter seizure susceptibility. Human subjects with
CNTNAP2 risk variants showed reduced long-range and increased local connectivity in cortical circuits
(Scott-Van Zeeland et al., 2010), while healthy individuals with the risk allele had increased activation
of specific cortical regions (Whalley et al., 2011).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
CONTACT FOR REAGENT AND RESOURCE SHARING
Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled
by the Lead Contact, Peter Penzes (p-penzes@northwestern.edu).
EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Cntnap2 knockout mice. Cntnap2 KO mice were generated and kindly donated by Elior Peles
(Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel). The colony was genotyped following the primers and conditions
previously described (Poliak et al., 2003), and it was maintained in their original strain, CD1.

Neuronal culture. High density (100,000 cells/cm2) cortical neuron cultures were prepared from P0
Cntnap2 WT or KO mice or Sprague-Dawley rat E18 embryos as described previously (Srivastava et al.,
2011). Briefly, neurons were plated onto coverslips coated with poly-D-lysine (0.2 mg/mL; Sigma), in
feeding medium (Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), 0.5 mM glutamine and
penicillin/streptomycin). 200 μM DL-APV (Abcam) was added to the medium 4 days later. Half of the
feeding medium+APV was replaced twice a week until the neurons were used.
Neuronal transfections. Cortical neurons were transfected at DIV 21 using Lipofectamine 2000
following the manufacturer's recommendations, and the neurons were maintained in the feeding media
for 2 days after the transfection. Neurons were then fixed in 4% formaldehyde + 4% sucrose in PBS for
10 min and washed 3 times with PBS for 10 min. Coverslips were then processed for immunostaining.
Only neurons that exhibited a pyramidal asymmetric morphology, with a single long apical and highly
branching protrusion, and many basal shorter protrusions radiating from the soma, were selected for
further analysis. Any signs of poor neuronal health excluded the cell from quantification. Rats and mice
were used in accordance with IACUC and national guidelines and regulations under approved
protocols.

METHOD DETAILS
Antibodies, plasmids and CSF samples. The following antibodies were purchased: CNTNAP2 (Cterminal, rabbit polyclonal, Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), CNTNAP2 (N-terminal, mouse monoclonal,
Neuromab, Davis, California), actin (mouse monoclonal, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), GFP
(chicken polyclonal, ab13972; Abcam), Flag (Mouse, Sigma), vGLUT1 (Guinea Pig, Synaptic System

Antibodies), PMCA2 (Rabbit, Thermo Fisher), CNTN-1 (Abcam). Plasmids used in this study were:
pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Mountain View, California); Flag-CNTNAP2 (generated by subcloning human
CNTNAP2 cDNA from a plasmid kindly provided by Dr. Elior Peles, Weizmann Institute of Science,
Israel) (Gao et al., 2018); PMCA2w/b and GCamP6s (both from Addgene); and DsRedExpress2
(Clontech). Pooled murine (CD1) and remnants of human CSF were obtained from Bioreclamation IVT.
Biological process enrichment analysis. The gene annotation enrichment analysis tool DAVID v6.8
was used to perform biological process GO term enrichment (Huang da et al., 2009). For the secretome
analysis, the list of detected proteins previously published in (Kuhn et al., 2016) was used as an initial
dataset. For the hCSF analysis, a sample from a healthy individual was obtained from BIoreclamation
IVT, and MS was performed. For comparison, a published hCSF proteome (Kroksveen et al., 2017)
was included in Fig.S1A-C with a list of 2071 IDs. In order to avoid any nomenclature discrepancies,
all IDs were translated into entrez gene ID, thus we used H. sapiens as the background list except for
the membrane-anchored analysis, for which we used as background a list of transmembrane and GPIanchored proteins obtained from UniProt. The –log10 of the Benjamini corrected P-value was calculated
and graphed for the top 5 non-redundant GOTERM_BP_FAT categories, where statistical significance
is reached at a value of 1.3.
Disease enrichment analysis. A hypergeometric test was used to calculate the probability of finding
an over- or under-enrichment of disease-relevant genes in the secretome, hCSF, and the published
hCSF gene ID lists and sub-lists (including total, membrane-anchored, and secreted proteins). As
disease-relevant gene lists, we used all de novo gene lists from the supplementary data compiled in
(Genovese et al., 2016). Only de novo variants affecting protein-coding regions or splice sites were
included (that is, missense, frameshift, and splice site mutations, altered stop codons, altered start
codons, insertions, and deletions).
Protein-protein interaction network analysis with STRING. STRING v10.5 was used to perform
protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis. The confidence of the PPI is shown by the network edges,
using “experiments” and “databases” as the active interaction sources, with medium confidence. We
adjusted the network to fit 4 clusters and used the k means clustering method for creating the PPI
network to provide a global and intuitive understanding of the functional properties of the proteins
belonging to the synaptic sheddome, defined as the overlap between the hCSF dataset (1416 IDs) and
the PSD proteome (Bayes et al., 2012).

Chemical LTP induction protocol. High density, 24 days in vitro (DIV) rat cortical neurons were
accommodated for 30 min in aCSF (containing in mM: NaCl 125, KCl 2.5, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1.25, glucose
11, NaHCO3 26.2, NaH2PO4 1, Hepes 10, 200 μM APV, pH 7.4). Then, LTP was induced chemically
by the application of a chemical cocktail containing 100 μM picrotoxin, 1 µM strychnine,10 μM glycine,
0 Mg2+, 0 APV, in aCSF) for 30 min. After this, extracellular media proteins were collected and
concentrated by the TCA method and cells were lysed in RIPA buffer. When inhibitors or antagonists
were employed, they were added in the accommodation to aCSF phase as well as during the cLTP
phase. The following chemicals were used: dynasore (Sigma, 100 μM), APV (Sigma, 200 μM), NBQX
(Tocris, 10 μM), TAPI-0 (Enzo, 25 μM, which inhibits MMP13, MMP9, MMP1, TACE and MMP3 with
decreasing affinities Ki in nM 0.2, 0.5, 6, 8.8, 68 respectively), GM6001 (Calbiochem, 50 μM), MMP9
inhibitor I (Calbiochem,10 μM).
Precipitation of extracellular media proteins by TCA method. Supernatants were centrifuged for 3
min at 16,000 rpm to eliminate suspended cells. 0.015% deoxycholate was incubated with the
supernatants for 5 min. TCA was added to the supernatants to a final concentration of 20%. After an
incubation period of 1 h, the samples were centrifuged at 18,000×g. The pellets were washed three
times with ice cold acetone. Remaining acetone was evaporated, and the pellets were dissolved in
sample buffer.
Separation of membrane and soluble fractions from tissue. The protocol described by Suzuki et
al. (Suzuki et al., 2012) was used with slight modifications. One-month old male WT and Cntnap2 KO
mice were dissected, and cortices were homogenized with a dounce homogenizer in a Tris-based buffer
(50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, and Roche protease inhibitor cocktail). They were centrifuged
at 1500 g for 10 min, and the supernatants were subsequently centrifuged at 100,000×g for 1 h. The
pellet containing the membranes and the supernatants containing soluble proteins were analyzed by
western blotting.
Immunocytochemistry. 24 DIV neurons were first washed in PBS and then fixed in 4% formaldehyde4% sucrose-PBS for 10 min. Fixed neurons were then permeabilized and blocked simultaneously (0.1%
BSA, 4% NGS, 0.1% Triton-X-100 in PBS, 1 h at RT), followed by incubation of primary antibodies
overnight at 4 ºC. The coverslips were washed 3 times with PBS and incubated with the corresponding
fluorophore-secondary antibodies (45 min, RT) (Alexa Fluor®488, Alexa Fluor®596, LifeTechnologies,
Carlsbad, California), as described previously. The coverslips were then mounted onto slides using

ProLong Antifade reagent (Invitrogen), and stored at 4 ºC until the acquisition of the images. All images
were acquired in the linear range of fluorescence intensity. When vGlut1 antibody was used, incubation
with primary antibodies and the corresponding secondary antibodies was performed in two consecutive
days to avoid cross-reaction of chicken Alexa Fluor®488 with guinea pig vGlut1 primary antibody.
SIM imaging and analysis. 3-week old Cntnap2 KO cortical neurons were transfected with GFP and
an extracellularly tagged Flag-CNTNAP2. Then, after a 30-min accommodation of the cells in aCSF
(containing in mM: NaCl 125, KCl 2.5, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1.25, glucose 11, NaHCO3 26.2, NaH2PO4 1,
Hepes 10, pH 7.4), LTP was induced chemically (100 µM picrotoxin, 1 µM strychnine,10 µM glycine, 0
Mg2+, 0 APV in aCSF) for 30 min. After this, cells were fixed and stained for GFP, vGLUT1, Flag, and
CNTNAP2 C-terminal antibody. Images were taken with an N-SIM microscope at the Nikon Imaging
Center at Northwestern University, as previously described (Smith et al., 2014). Acquisition was set to
10 MHz, 14 bit with EM gain, and no binning. Autoexposure was kept at 100-300 ms, and the EM gain
multiplier restrained below 300. Laser power was adjusted to keep look up tables (LUTs) within the first
quarter of the scale. Reconstruction parameters Illumination Modulation Contrast, High Resolution
Noise Suppression, and Out of Focus Blur Suppression (0.96, 1.19, and 0.17, respectively) were kept
consistent across experiments and imaging sessions, as described (Smith et al., 2014).
Images were analyzed with ImageJ. Line scans were used to generate fluorescence intensity profile
plots to assess colocalization. CNTNAP2-ecto was identified using the AND, OR, and XOR functions,
in order to identify signal that contained only the flag staining (N-terminal or extracellular) and no Cterminal/intracellular signal. This flag signal void of CNTNAP2 C-terminal signal was considered to
correspond to CNTNAP2-ecto and was analyzed in two different compartments: GFP or overlap
between GFP and vGLUT1 (synaptic). The area occupied by CNTNAP2-ecto and the number of
punctae were measured within the GFP and synaptic regions.

Fractionation protocol for neuronal culture. We followed a protocol described elsewhere, with slight
modifications (Won et al., 2016). Briefly, 3-week old rat cortical neurons were rinsed in PBS and cells
were collected in a PBS solution containing 1 mM MgCl2 and 0.1 mM CaCl2, protease inhibitor cocktail,
and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail. Cells were harvested after centrifugation at 16,000×g for 2 min, and
lysed for 15 min in hypotonic buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM MgCl2 and 0.1 CaCl2, protease inhibitor cocktail,
and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail, pH 7.5). Membranes were pelleted by centrifugation (20,000×g, 20
min) and lysed for 15 min in lysis buffer (PBS, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 CaCl2, 1% Triton-X-100, protease
inhibitor cocktail, and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail). Then, samples were centrifuged at 20,000×g for
20 min, finding the extrasynaptic fraction in the supernatant, and the insoluble pellet containing the
synaptic fraction was dissolved in PBS, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% SDS. Whole
cell lysates and extrasynaptic and synaptic fractions were analyzed by western blotting.
CNTNAP2-ecto protein production. HEK cells were plated in PDL-coated 10 cm2 dishes and
transfected with Flag-CNTNAP2 using lipofectamine following the manufacturer’s recommendations.
After a 2-day transfection, supernatants from CNTNAP2-transfected and non-transfected cultures were
collected, centrifuged at 700×g, and filtered through a 0.22 µm filter. In order to concentrate the
supernatants to a smaller and more manageable volume, samples were spin-filtered with molecular
cut-off filters of 100 kD (Millipore). The concentrated supernatant was then affinity-purified with flagagarose beads (Sigma) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, beads were washed and
rinsed, added to the concentrated supernatants and rocked at 4 °C for 4 h. After a 2 min centrifugation
at 2,000×g, the beads were rinsed 3 times with TBS and finally the proteins were eluted with 100 mM
Gly, pH 3.5, and beads were removed by centrifugation. 1 M Tris, pH 8.5, was added to the eluate to
neutralize the solution. Finally, the samples containing the purified CNTNAP2-ecto and the vehicle
control were dialyzed 3 times using 100 kDa spin filters (Millipore) to remove the glycine and substitute
it with a TBS solution.
Expression and purification of CNTNAP2-ecto. The construct encoding the entire extracellular
domain of CNTNAP2 from residue 28 to 1261 was fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1 as detailed
elsewhere (Rubio-Marrero et al., 2016). This construct was transfected into HEK293GnTI- cells and the
cells were selected by growth in the antibiotic G418. For large scale protein expression, stable cells
were maintained at 37 °C and 5% (v/v) CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing up to
5% (v/v) FBS. CNTNAP2-Fc secreted in the medium was affinity purified using ProteinA-CaptivA TM
PriMAB (RepliGen, Waltham, MA) and subsequently cleaved with recombinant 3C protease to remove

the Fc fragment and leave the mature (i.e., no leader peptide) extracellular domain of CNTNAP2. The
purified protein was buffer exchanged into 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, and 150 mM NaCl, concentrated to
~3 to ~6 mg/mL, and stored at 4 °C until used.
Affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry. Tissue preparation. Cortices from 20 6-8-week
old male C57BL6J mice were homogenized on ice with a dounce homogenizer in buffer HB (20 mM
Hepes, pH 7.4, 320 mM sucrose, 5 mM EDTA, protease inhibitors). Homogenates were centrifuged at
3,000×g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and cell debris. Supernatant was further centrifuged at
38,400×g (15 min, 4 °C) and the pellet was resuspended in buffer SB1 (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 M KI,
5 mM EDTA, protease inhibitors) to remove peripheral proteins. This homogenate was then centrifuged
at 38,400×g (15 min, 4 °C) to collect membranes. Pellet containing membranes was washed with buffer
SB2 (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA, protease inhibitors) to remove KI and it was centrifuged
again at 38,400×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was then resuspended in buffer RB (20 mM Hepes,
pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 1% CHAPS, protease inhibitors) and rotated for 1.5
h at 4 °C to solubilize the membranes. Finally, the homogenate was ultracentrifuged at 100,000×g for
1 h at 4 °C to remove insoluble materials. The final supernatant was split in halves. Vehicle or
CNTNAP2-ecto was added to the membrane homogenate and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The
following morning, the same amount of flag-agarose beads (Sigma) was added to each sample and
incubated with rotation for 1.5 h at 4 °C. After capture, samples were centrifuged at 2,000×g for 1 min,
and the beads were rinsed with buffer RB 3 times. The samples containing the beads were passed
through disposable chromatography columns (BioRad) and then bait and prey proteins were eluted by
adding a solution containing 100 mM glycine, 1% CHAPS, pH 2.5, 3 times. The eluate was precipitated
by adding trichloracetic acid to a final concentration of 20% over 1 h at 4 °C, and the solution was then
centrifuged at 18,000×g for 1 h at 4 °C. Finally, the pellet was washed 3 times with ice cold acetone,
and the samples were kept at RT to dry and stored at -80 °C until they were analyzed by mass
spectrometry. Sample preparation for LC-MS/MS analysis. We followed the protocol described
elsewhere (Hickox et al., 2017). The precipitated protein pellets were solubilized in 100 μL of 8 M urea
for 30 min; 100 μL of 0.2% ProteaseMAX (Promega) was then added, and the mixture was incubated
for an additional 2 h. The protein extracts were reduced and alkylated as described previously (Chen
et al., 2008), followed by the addition of 300 μL of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 5 μL of 1%
ProteaseMAX, and 2 μg of sequence-grade trypsin (Promega). Samples were digested overnight in a
37 °C thermomixer (Eppendorf). For Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid MS analysis, the tryptic peptides were
purified with Pierce C18 spin columns and fractionated with increasing acetonitrile (ACN)

The search space included all fully and half-tryptic or non-tryptic (for CNTNAP2 sequence mapping)
peptide candidates that fell within the mass tolerance window with no miscleavage constraint. Peptides
were assembled and filtered with DTASelect2 (version 2.1.3) (Cociorva et al., 2007; Tabb et al., 2002)
through Integrated Proteomics Pipeline (IP2 version 3, Integrated Proteomics Applications,
http://www.integratedproteomics.com). To estimate peptide probabilities and false discovery rates
(FDR) accurately, we used a target/decoy database containing the reversed sequences of all the
proteins appended to the target database (Peng et al., 2003). Each protein identified was required to
have a minimum of one peptide of minimal length of 6 amino acid residues; however, this peptide had
to be an excellent match with a FDR <0.001 and at least one excellent peptide match. After the
peptide/spectrum matches were filtered, we estimated that the protein FDRs were ≤1% for each sample
analysis. Resulting protein lists included subset proteins to allow for consideration of all possible protein
forms implicated by a given peptide identified from the complex protein mixtures.
Immunoprecipitation in HEK293 cells. One 10 cm2 dish was seeded with HEK293T cells. At 70%
confluency, cells were transfected with PMCA2w/b with lipofectamine 2000 following the
manufacturer’s instructions. After a 2-day transfection, cells were lysed in Hepes buffer (20 mM Hepes,
1% CHAPS, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail III (Sigma)). The lysate was precleared for 30 min at 4 °C with anti-flag M2 affinity beads
(Sigma). CNTNAP2-ecto or vehicle was incubated with the cell lysate overnight. Then, flag beads were
added to the lysate and incubated for 2 h. The beads were washed 3 times with Hepes buffer, and
finally, sample buffer was added to the beads, and the mixture was heated for 20 min at 40 °C to elute
the proteins. Proteins were detected by western blotting.

Cytosolic Ca2+ imaging in HEK293 cells. One day after seeding, cells were transfected with GFPPMCA2w/b. After 2 days, cells were loaded with 1 µM Fura-2AM, a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator used to
measure cytosolic free Ca2+ levels. Cells were rinsed twice with recording solution containing, in mM,
NaCl 145, KCl 5, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1, glucose 10, Hepes 10, pH 7.4. The glass-bottomed dish containing
the cells was placed on the stage of a C2 Nikon microscope where the temperature was maintained at
37 °C. Images were acquired using a 20X objective. After 60 s of basal recording, the cells were treated
with either vehicle or CNTNAP2-pNTF, after which 0.5 mM ATP (Sigma) was added to elicit a cytosolic
Ca2+ signal. Acquired images were analyzed with NIS elements (Nikon), selecting both PMCA2
transfected and non-transfected cells.
Cytosolic Ca2+ imaging in dissociated rat cortical neurons. At day-in-culture 17, rat cortical neurons
were transfected with the cytosolic genetic Ca2+ indicator GCaMP6s and the red cell fill DsRed
Express2. After 2 days, cells were cells were rinsed twice with aCSF containing (in mM) NaCl 125, KCl
2.5, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1.25, glucose 11, NaHCO3 26.2, NaH2PO4 1, Hepes 10, pH 7.4. The glassbottomed dish containing the neurons was placed on the stage of a microscope where the temperature
was maintained at 37 °C. After 60 s of basal recording, the cells were treated with either vehicle or
CNTNAP2-pNTF, after which 30 mM KCl was added to elicit a cytosolic Ca2+ signal. Acquired images
were analyzed with NIS elements (Nikon). For the analysis of Ca2+ in soma, a C2 Nikon microscope
and a 20X objective were used.
Brain slice preparation. Animals were deeply anesthetized with 5% isoflurane in O2 and decapitated.
The brain was rapidly extracted and placed on ice-cold modified aCSF containing (in mM) NaCl 125,
NaHCO3 26, glucose 11, KCl 2.5, NaH2PO4 1.25, CaCl2 2.5, MgCl2 6, and kynurenic acid 1 for 2-3 min
and then glued on a vibratome VT1000S (Leica). The slicing chamber was filled with the same ice-cold
aCSF. Slices then recovered at 34 °C for at least 45 min in classic aCSF (in mM, NaCl 125, NaHCO3
26, glucose 11, KCl 2.5, NaH2PO4 1.25, CaCl2 2.5, MgCl2 1.3) before incubation with the Ca2+ sensor
Cal520-AM (15 mM, AAT Bioquest) and the glial indicator SR-101 (1 μM, Sigma) for 45 min at 34 °C
with constant bubbling of 95% O2/5% CO2 in a custom made incubator. Slices were then pre-incubated
for 1 h with 10 nM of the CNTNAP2-ecto or vehicle at 34 °C before imaging. Slices were transferred to
an imaging chamber (Warner) with a constant flow of 3 mL/min of 95% O2/5% CO2 in aCSF under a
Nikon A1R multiphoton microscope, immersion objective 25X, NA 1.1. A chameleon laser was tuned
at 820 nm and the power was set around 12-16 mW. aCSF was kept at 37.5 °C by a heated controller
(TC344, Warner Instrument) to have a final temperature of 32-33 °C in the imaged sample. Slices were

allowed to stabilize for 5 min in the chamber before recording. The 30 mM KCl evoked responses were
acquired at 2 frames/s, and spontaneous activity was recorded at a speed of 3 frames/s with 7.5 mM
of KCl to induce spontaneous network events (Feldt Muldoon et al., 2013).
Analysis of spontaneous activity and synchrony. Regions of interest were traced manually on
somas based on the maximum projection obtained in ImageJ, blinded for the experimental conditions.
Somas stained for the red glial dye SR-101 were not included in the analysis. The background was
subtracted, and the mean intensity was used as the intensity of the fluorescence for each time point.
The normalized data were analyzed in Matlab (Matwork) using a homemade routine based on the
“findpeak” functions of the software. The minimum variation of intensity was set at 6% for neuronal
cultures and at 10% for slices. ROIs presenting no transients during the time course of the movie were
discarded from the analysis. To prevent bias while detecting the time windows when the neuronal
network was synchronized, we used a method based on 10,000 random permutations over time of the
binary Ca2+ transients for each neuron. The generated distribution of the number of events per frame
is used to determine a threshold of significant synchrony corresponding to ܶℎ‫ݏ݁ݎ‬ℎ‫ܿ݊ݕܵ ݈݀݋‬ℎ‫ ߤ = ݕ݊݋ݎ‬+
3 ߪ where μ is the average number of events per frame in the 10,000 shuffled data, and σ is the standard
deviation of number of events per frame in the shuffled data. The synchrony ratio corresponds to the
fraction of transients during the synchrony phases divided by the total number of events (Fig.S6).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (La Jolla, USA). To compare differences
between two groups, Student’s t-test (Gaussian distribution of data) or a Mann Whitney test (nonGaussian distribution of data) was used. Data distribution was considered Gaussian after passing the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test or the F-test to compare variances when n<5. To compare multiple variables,
two-way ANOVA was used, followed by a Newman-Keuls post hoc test to compare replicate means
unless otherwise specified. Statistical significance was defined as P<0.05.

SUPPLEMENTAL FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure S1, Related to Figure 1. A. Venn diagram showing that, of the 2072 proteins taken from a
published human CSF dataset, 860 could potentially undergo ectodomain shedding. GO analysis
performed for originally membrane-anchored proteins shows cell adhesion and axon guidance as the
top enriched categories. B. The membrane-anchored fraction of the published hCSF shows an
enrichment for ASD-related genes, but no significant enrichment is observed in the soluble or secreted
proteins. C. Hypergeometric test shows a highly significant overlap between the neuronal sheddome in
vitro and the published hCSF sheddome (139 proteins). D. GO analysis performed for soluble proteins
in the neuronal secretome, the hCSF and the published hCSF shows extracellular matrix organization
and platelet degranulation as the top enriched categories. E. Hypergeometric tests run in the three
datasets analyzed (neuronal secretome, hCSF, and previously published hCSF) show that only the
membrane-anchored proteome is enriched for ASD-related risk factors taken from the SFARI database
(category 1-5). F. The number of proteins per biological process (Y axis) in the neuronal, hCSF, and
previously published hCSF sheddomes shows that cell adhesion is the process with the highest number
of proteins in the three datasets.
Figure S2. A. Cell lysates and extracellular media extracted from HEK293 cells transfected with WT
and ΔCT CNTNAP2 and the CDFE ASD associated mutation 1253* after a two-day transfection.
Samples were immunoblotted for CNTNAP2 N-term antibody and CNTNAP2 C-term antibody. * used
to mark the intracellular C-terminal fragment produced after ectodomain shedding. # used to mark the
CNTNAP2-ecto found in the WT, dCT and the 1253* samples. Extracellular media samples were devoid
of actin signal, indicating no cell death or debri present in the samples. Moreover, there was no signal
with the C-terminal antibody in the media samples, confirming that the signal observed with the N-term
antibody corresponds to the CNTNAP2-ecto and not to the full length. B. N2a cells transfected with
CNTNAP2 display CNTNAP2 ectodomain shedding that is blocked with the inhibitors GM6001, TAPIO and MMP9 inhibitor I, corroborating our data obtained in cultured neurons.
Figure S3, Related to Figure 3. A. Analysis of the localization of CNTNAP2-ecto shows its presence
both within the cell as the full-length CNTNAP2 (45%) and in the extracellular space adjacent to the
neuron (55%), demonstrating CNTNAP2 ectodomain shedding by SIM, a superresolution imaging
technique. B. Analysis of the localization of CNTNAP2-ecto by SIM imaging shows that it is localized
extracellularly, both well outside the axonal compartment and close to synaptic boutons, and also within
axons.

Figure S4, Related to Figure 4. A. Pull down experiment of HEK293 cells transfected with PMCA2,
incubated with WT CNTNAP2-ecto or disease associated CNTNAP2 1253* demonstrates that both
forms of CNTNAP2 interact with PMCA2. B. Confocal images of dissociated rat cortical neurons shows
colocalization of PMCA2 and CNTNAP2. C. PMCA2 expression levels in Cntnap2 WT and KO mice.
WT mice show increasing amounts of PMCA2 with age, while KO mice present decreased levels of
PMCA2 at age P28 compared with the WT counterparts. Data are represented as mean±SEM, n=3, ttest *P=0.0349. D. Allen brain atlas images of CNTNAP2 and PMCA2 show a similar pattern of
expression of both proteins in 8th sagittal slice of P56 mice brains. E. Experimental protocol employed
for Ca2+ imaging in HEK293 cells transfected with PMCA2 and treated with vehicle or CNTNAP2-ecto.
Kinetic parameters such as peak, tmax, and area under the curve (AUC) show no difference between
vehicle and CNTNAP2-ecto-treated PMCA2-transfected HEK293 cells. Data are represented as
mean±SEM. Peak data: N=7 cultures, one-way ANOVA *P<0.0001, Newman-Keuls post-hoc test, ns.
tmax: N=7 cultures, Kruskal-Wallis test *P<0.02, Dunn’s post-hoc test, ns. AUC: N=6 cultures, one-way
ANOVA *P=0.3149, Newman-Keuls post-hoc test, ns.
Figure S5, Related to Figure 5. A. Scheme of the protocol followed for Ca2+ imaging in dissociated rat
cortical neurons. Cells were transfected with the Ca2+ indicator GCaMP6s and the cell fill
DsRedExpress2. After two days, they were incubated with vehicle (Veh) or CNTNAP2-ecto (Ecto) for
5 min. KCl at 30 mM was then added to the cells to depolarize neurons and elicit a Ca2+ peak. B.
Concentration response curve of CNTNAP2-ecto at 3, 10, and 30 nM indicates that 10 nM is the most
efficient concentration to decrease the t1/2 off; consequently, the rest of the experiments were performed
at this concentration. Data are represented as mean±SEM, n=25-47 neurons, one-way ANOVA
P=0.0312, Newman-Keuls post-hoc test *P=0.0312. C. Other kinetic parameters analyzed at
CNTNAP2-ecto 10 nM, such as the peak and the tmax, were not altered by the incubation with CNTNAPecto, confirming that the effect of the CNTNAP2-ecto is specific to the Ca2+ extrusion phase. Data are
represented as mean±SEM, n=39/23 neurons, peak: Mann-Whitney test, P=0.1370; tmax Mann-Whitney
test, P=0.2417. D. Using the cell fill DsRedExpress2 to dissociate the effect of CNTNAP2-ecto in
pyramidal vs inhibitory neurons based on their different morphology, we found that the effect exerted
by the CNTNAP2-ecto on the t1/2 off is approximately the same (23.7% vs 22.5% reduction), but only
significant in pyramidal neurons, probably due to the variability encountered in inhibitory neurons. Data
are represented as mean±SEM. Pyramidal neuron analysis: Mann-Whitney test, n=28-23, *P=0.0285.
Inhibitory neuron analysis: t-test, n=11-9, P=0.1781.

spontaneous Ca2+ imaging on control primary cortical neurons. B. Co-activation map after a random
shuffling in time of the Ca2+ transients. C. Raster plot of the real Ca2+ transients and D. after reshuffling

the random distribution plus 3 times the standard deviation.
