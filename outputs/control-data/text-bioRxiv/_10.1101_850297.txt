ABSTRACT
Quorum sensing (QS) is a mechanism of cell-to-cell communication via diffusible signal
molecules that controls multiple secreted factors including virulence factors in bacterial
pathogens [1,2]. While the standard view is that QS functions as a density-sensing
mechanism, the functional and evolutionary context of QS continues to be disputed [3–
11]. A critical step in assessing the various adaptive hypotheses is establishing the
functional capacities and limits of QS. Current functional studies largely focus on a
dichotomy of QS on/off (or, quorate / sub-quorate) states, despite the increasing amount
of heterogeneity on a cellular scale [4,12–16], overlooking the potential for intermediate,
graded responses. In this paper we explore the functional capacity of QS to resolve finely
graded environmental densities and introduce the use of reaction norms as a way to
holistically characterize QS response. Here we show that Pseudomonas aeruginosa can
deliver a graded response to variation in environmental population density on both the
population and individual scales. We further resolve the linear population response to be
the product of two component cellular reaction norms: the likelihood of being responsive
and the intensity of response. Overall, this work reveals that there is no critical cell mass
or ‘quorum’, at which QS is activated on either the individual cell or population scale.
INTRODUCTION
Many species of bacteria are capable of a form of cell-cell communication via diffusible
signal molecules, generally referred to as quorum sensing (QS). The study of QS has
largely focused on the intracellular scale, leading to a detailed understanding of the
regulatory mechanisms shaping the production of and response to signal molecules in
model organisms such as Vibrio cholerae, Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa
[1]. We now understand that QS is mediated by multiple diffusible signals that together
control a diverse array of responses, including swarming, luminescence, competence and
the production of diverse secreted factors [17].
While the molecular mechanisms of QS have been described for model organisms in
remarkable detail, the functional and evolutionary context of QS continues to be disputed.
In other words, while we understand how QS works, we still have limited understanding
of why bacteria use this system to control behavior. What are the functions of QS? How
do these QS functions help bacteria to survive and grow? The standard answer is that

bacteria use QS to sense when they are at sufficient density (‘quorate’) to efficiently turn
on cooperative behaviors such as secretion of toxins and enzymes in order to collectively
modify their environment [5]. Other researchers have argued that QS is an asocial sensing
apparatus, where individual cells produce and monitor signal levels in order to infer their
physical environment (am I in an open or enclosed space?) [18]. More recently,
integration of molecular and evolutionary approaches has increased the menu of potential
functions to include sensing multiple aspects of both the social and physical environment
[3–6] and coordinating complex social strategies that limit the profitability of noncooperating ‘cheat’ strains [7–11].
A critical step in assessing the various adaptive hypotheses is establishing the functional
capacities and limits of QS. Previous studies have demonstrated ‘density sensing’
functions –populations can use QS to sense when they exceed a density threshold
[5,19,20]. In addition, Darch et al. demonstrated that responding with increased QS
controlled cooperative activity at high density can provide a fitness benefit [5]. Other
studies have demonstrated ‘diffusion sensing’ functions [18] –QS systems can
functionally respond to variation in physical containment, so that even a single cell can
become ‘quorate’ (turn on a QS controlled reporter gene) if isolated in a sufficiently
small contained space [4]. More recently, some studies have demonstrated ‘genotype
sensing’ functions – QS can respond to variation in the genotypic composition of a
population, restricting QS-controlled responses to populations that are enriched with
wildtypes [7,8,21,22].
The functional studies outlined above largely focus on a dichotomy of QS on/off (or,
quorate / sub-quorate) states, overlooking the potential for intermediate, graded responses
(Fig 1A). The threshold quorate/non-quorate concept is ingrained in the QS literature
following the use of the legal ‘quorum’ analogy [20], and is also supported by
mathematical models of QS signal dynamics that highlight how sufficiently strong
positive feedback control of signal production can produce a sharp threshold response to
changes in environmental parameters such as density or diffusion [23,24]. However,
these same mathematical models indicate that graded-responses are also possible,
dependent on the model parameterization. More generally, Fig 1A highlights that the
phenotypic response of QS bacteria to differing environmental conditions can be viewed
as a ‘reaction norm’ [25–28] that can in principle take differing shapes. Reaction norms
describe phenotypic responses of a single genotype (y-axis, Fig 1A) to varying
environmental inputs (x-axis, Fig 1A). With this reaction norm framework, it is important
to emphasize that in our study the x-axis is not time, but instead discrete environmental
conditions. Whether responses are graded or thresholded during the growth towards high
density in a single colony is a separate issue. Describing the reaction-norms of QS cells
and populations to environmental changes is an important step towards understanding the
capacities of QS systems to differentially respond to novel environments.

Figure 1. Schematic of potential population and single cell responses to variation in stationary phase
density. A) Population response (y-axis) across discrete stationary culture density environments (x-axis),
given a threshold (left) or graded response (right). In (B) and (C) we outline alternative cell-scale responses
(intensity of green cells) that are consistent with discrete population-scale behaviors (yellow arrows). (B)
threshold (ON/OFF) cellular responses can produce a threshold or graded responses on population scale.
(C) graded individual responses can produce threshold or graded responses on a population scale.

Whether the population-scale reaction norm to environmental variation is threshold-like
or graded (Fig 1A), a separate question is how collective population level responses are
constructed out of individual cellular contributions (Fig 1B,C). Studies of QS on a singlecell scale have revealed substantial heterogeneity in response to QS signals [4,12–16],
highlighting that cell-cell communication does not necessarily result in tight
synchronization of individual cell activity (Fig 1B,C). In some systems, heterogeneity can
be quenched by the addition of extra signal [13,15], implying a lack of receptor
saturation. However, this is not a universal result [12], indicating that other molecular
processes can drive cellular variation in response. Regardless of the molecular details, we
currently lack a functional understanding of how individual cellular responses vary with
changes in the environment.
In the current study we address the canonical ‘density sensing’ function of QS, using the
environmental generalist and opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and an
unprecedented scale of reaction norm resolution (17 different stationary phase densities).
Our first challenge is to map the population-scale resolving power of QS to quantitatively
discriminate graded differences in population density (Fig 1A). Does P. aeruginosa
respond in a purely threshold manner, collapsing quantitative differences in population
density into a simple low / high qualitative output, or can QS allow P. aeruginosa to
deliver a graded response to distinct environmental densities? Our second challenge is to

understand how collective responses are partitioned across individual cells. Are changes
in collective responses governed primarily by changes in the proportion of cells in an on
state (Fig 1B) or changes in the individual cell intensity of response (Fig 1C), or both?
RESULTS
Collective level of response to density is linear and graded. Our first challenge is to
map out the population scale reaction norm of the collective QS-controlled response to
variation in stationary phase population densities. To provide a detailed picture of the QS
response reaction norm to varying density, we grew a QS reporter strain (PAO1 lasBGFP) under 17 conditions of carbon limitation and measured average fluorescence output
per cell at early stationary phase per condition (Fig 2). The range of cell densities
generated from this method is from 1x108 cells/ml to 2x109 cells/ml.

Figure 2. Population response to increasing cell density is linear and graded. Stationary culture density
was controlled by manipulating the concentration of casamino acids as the limiting resource (Fig S1). Cells
were grown to stationary phase and assayed for QS response via fluorescence microscopy imaging.
Response is determined by a translational fusion of the quorum sensing controlled lasB promoter and a
green fluorescent protein. Individual cell pixel intensity is a measure of quorum sensing response and
average pixel intensity is calculated across all cells in the population as a proxy for total population
expression. Data is congruent with microplate results (Fig S2). Quorum sensing signal knockout
(ΔlasIΔrhlI) shows background response (GFP) with no signal in the environment. Average population
investment in QS increases as culture density increases with no observable density threshold (AIC linear
model fit: 1.56, AIC step-function fit: 71.03). Range of stationary phase cell densities is from 1x108
cells/ml to 2x109 cells/ml.

Figure 2 shows that QS response is linear with increasing culture density, providing
intermediate levels of per-capita response to intermediate densities. To confirm the lack
of threshold behavior we assessed alternate statistical models including threshold
functions, and found that a linear fit model supports the data significantly more than a

step-function fit (AIC linear: 1.56, AIC step-function: 71.03), supporting a graded
population response as outlined in Figure 1.
Individual response to density is bimodal. Figure 2 establishes that on a collective
scale, the response to environmental variation (in stationary density) is smoothly graded.
Next, we ask how this collective response is built from individual cell contributions. Is
the graded increase due to more cells turning on at higher densities (Fig 1B), cells turning
on to a greater extent (Fig 1C) or both? To address this question, we take the same data
presented in Figure 2 and now present the distribution of individual cellular responses
rather than simply the mean response (Fig 3).

Figure 3. Individual response is bimodal. Ridgeline plot of cellular response data showing the
distribution of cellular expression across the population. Populations exhibit a non-uniform response to
increasing density. The lowest population density matches the QS null mutant (quorum sensing signal
knockout, ΔlasIΔrhlI, in blue on the far right). Populations with higher cell densities split into two
subpopulations, unresponsive and responsive. A total of 55 populations were sampled across 17 stationary
phase environments. Representative samples were chosen for this plot by selecting populations with ~0.1
OD600 increments. Between 5,000 and 15,000 individual cells were measured per population.

As expected from prior studies [4,12–16], plotting all individual responses within a
population shows cell-to-cell variation in QS response within a single population despite
isogenic and homogenous culture conditions (Fig 3). At higher densities we see evidence
of a bimodal distribution, with the population segregating into an unresponsive, subquorate, OFF state and a responsive, quorate, ON state. Looking across populations
grown to differing stationary phase densities, we see qualitative evidence of a graded
shift in the ON state towards higher cellular intensities at higher densities. To further
analyze the single-cell scale data in Fig 3 we fitted a mixed normal statistical model to

the data (Fig 4A), which allows us to define the number of cells in the OFF or ON states
(Fig 4B), and also the average intensity of the ON state (Fig 4C).

Figure 4. Proportion of cells responding and level of response varies with density. In light of the
binomial responses (Fig 3), we course-grain the data into discrete states, and further quantify the magnitude
of the ON state. A) Method summary. By fitting two gaussian distributions (grey and green curves) via the
mixtools package in R, mixing proportions (proportion of total individuals that fall under each distribution)
and mean of each distribution can be quantified. Cells in the left, grey distribution are defined as OFF,
shorthand for a sub-quorate, unresponsive state which is indistinguishable from the QS null mutant (Fig 3).
Cells in the right, green distribution are defined as ON, shorthand for a quorate, responsive state. The
histogram shows the distribution of cellular expression levels in a single density treatment (0.42 OD600).
B) Proportion of cells ON in the population as determined from the mixing proportions of a Gaussian fit
mixed model. Proportion of cells ON increases with culture density but does not reach 100%. C) Level of
response as determined from the means of the fit distributions. The mean intensity of the ON state
distribution increases as culture density increases, while the mean of the OFF state remains constant.

Figure 4B illustrates persistent cellular heterogeneity across the range of assayed
environments, with the proportion of responding (ON) cells increasing rapidly from 0.03
towards a plateau of 0.95 responsive cells at higher densities. In addition to the variation
in proportion responding, the responsive ON proportion linearly increases their per-cell
investment (Fig 4C). In other words, low density environments are characterized by low
frequencies of ‘ON’ cells that invest at a low level, whereas high density environments
are characterized by near universal ‘ON’ states with high levels of per-cell investment.
Our analysis in Figure 4B,C depends on a course-graining of the underlying data (Fig 3)
into a simple 2-parameter summary (proportion ON, intensity ON), via mixed normal
model fits (Fig 4A). To assess the validity of the statistical summaries in Figure 4, we
contrast the predicted mean intensity per population (the product of proportion ON times
intensity ON, 4B * 4C) with the observed mean intensity per population (Fig 1). The
agreement between observed and expected values (Fig 5; mean absolute percentage error

= 9.7%) indicates that the data is adequately described by a simple decomposition into
proportion ON and intensity ON.

Figure 5. Proportion of cells responding and mean level of response explain population level
response. Plotting the observed average pixel intensity data (Fig 2) against the predicted response
(intensity ON x proportion cells ON, Fig 4B,C) indicates that the two predictor parameters capture the
observed population response (mean absolute percent error = 9.7%).

DISCUSSION
Our results show that populations of P. aeruginosa can respond in a graded manner to
variation in stationary phase density (Fig 2), and that this population-scale graded
response is due to both a graded increase in the number of responsive ‘ON’ cells and the
intensity of the ‘ON’ state (Figs 3-5). The ability to achieve a graded population-scale
response implies in principle that P. aeruginosa can tune collective responses (such as the
secreted elastase protein produced by our lasB reporter gene) to graded environmental
changes, rather than simply course-graining into a simple ‘high / low’ dichotomy. A
similar population scale graded response to continuous environmental variation was
reported by Allen et al., looking at variation in the genotypic concentration of mixed
populations grown to the same total density [7]. As the proportion of wildtype (PAO1
versus ΔlasB ‘cheats’) increased, the wildtype per-capita investment in cooperative LasB
secretions also increased, providing a simple behavioral mechanism to protect
cooperative investments from exploitation by cheats [7,22]. Darch et al. also reported a
graded response in lasB expression across 5 density environments, all of which fall into
the lower 3rd of the total density environments described here [5].
The existence of graded population scale responses across two continuously varying
environmental inputs (density, genotypic composition) raises the question of why use a

graded response? Is there an evolutionary rationale for a graded response, or is a graded
increase simply the ‘best approximation’ of a threshold response, given a simple system
working under genetic constraints. Existing evolutionary theory suggest that graded
investment reaction norms can be adaptive, under a range of distinct scenarios [29,30]. In
the specific context of quorum-sensing bacteria, evolutionary theory suggests that
population-scale responses to increasing density should depend critically on the shape of
the cost and benefit functions of increasing cooperative investments. Specifically, a
graded response is predicted to be the optimal strategy if the benefit function is
decelerating and costs are linear [31].
To further consider the functional context of the graded reaction norms, we turn to the
single cell scale data, which reveals how the graded population response is built from the
contributions of individual cells. In agreement with previous work [4,12–16], we find
cell-scale heterogeneity, but provide finer resolution and observe heterogeneity in both
ON/OFF state and the intensity of the ON state. Our results further illustrate that both the
proportion ON and the intensity of the ON state increase smoothly with increases in
stationary density (Fig 3-5). Together these results illustrate that the graded populationscale response is built from the combination of two graded cellular responses (OFF/ON
state, and intensity of ON) to changes in density. To assess the relative contribution of
these two components, we re-analyzed the data fixing one component and allowing the
other to vary (Fig S3). This analysis demonstrates that combining variation in both ‘onness’ (proportion ON) and intensity of the ON state leads to a steeper reaction-norm than
either component alone. In principle, the use of the two components to build the
population-scale reaction norm can make a more tunable system; changes in the reaction
norm can follow from changes to either the intensity responsiveness, the on-state
responsiveness or both.
Our single cell data illustrates that even at high densities (OD600 = 0.74, CFU =
2.02x109) a fraction of cells continue to be non-responsive (Fig 4B, max observed
proportion non-responsive of 0.06), but still viable (Table S1, max observed non-viable
of 0.0176). Persistent heterogeneity of QS response on single cell scale has been reported
across multiple studies and model organisms, implicating multiple mechanisms including
receptor copy number limitation [12]. Some cells may lack sufficient LasR to respond to
a quorum, regardless of the signal concentration. LasR homologs such as LuxR can
support a large range of copy numbers [12,32], so LasR insufficiency could be an
inevitable result of stochasticity in gene expression. We recognize that our experimental
manipulation of stationary density via controlling carbon limitation potentially had other
impacts on cellular physiology and therefore QS response. However, we found that
controlling density via carbon limitation had little impact on growth rate between
environments (Fig S1). We only observed a significant growth rate difference between
the lowest carbon and the other treatments (p < 0.0001), and no impact on the proportion
of viable cells (Table S1). Apart from growth rate, we recognize the confound that cells
will have undergone different numbers of generations. Indeed, Teng. et al have shown
that partitioning of LuxR, a LasR homolog, is slightly asymmetric and can generate
heterogeneity in responsiveness to signal [32].

In summary, introducing population and individual-scale reaction norms to the study of
quorum-sensing provides a platform to characterize and compare the functional
characteristics of QS systems, and also to place QS within the broader analysis of
phenotypic plasticity [27,28,30]. Our results provide a finely resolved mapping of the QS
reaction norm to environmental density in PAO1, on both the collective and single-cell
scale. On the population scale we see a graded linear response across a broad range of
cellular densities (1x108 cells/ml to 2x109 cells/ml), and we further resolve this linear
response to be the product of two component cellular reaction norms: the likelihood of
being responsive and the intensity of response. In an infection context, our results
indicate that there is no hard threshold separating sub-quorate ‘stealth’ mode and a
quorate ‘attack’ mode [33]. One implication is that attempts to control virulence and
biofilm expression in medicine and industry via QS inhibition could have greater impacts
across a spectrum of population densities. In this applied context, it is important to assess
the generality of our results and ask, how do QS reaction-norms vary across strains and
species of QS bacteria? How do they vary across environments? More broadly, our work
undermines the threshold concept of a ‘quorum’, instead placing QS bacteria in the
graded world of reaction norms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions. The bacterial strains used in this study were
P. aeruginosa PAO1 containing the lasB-GFP quorum sensing reporter [34] and P.
aeruginosa PAO1 ΔlasI/ΔrhlI lasB-GFP, which is deficient in the production of QS
signal molecules. Overnight cultures were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth,
supplemented with 100ug/ml gentamicin to maintain the pMHLB plasmid, with shaking
at 37 °C. Experiments were conducted in lightly buffered (50uM MOPS) minimal
defined media composed of an autoclaved basal salts solution (Na2HPO4, 6.8 gL−1;
KH2PO4, 3.0 gL−1; NaCl, 0.5 gL−1) and filter-sterilized 1M supplement stock solutions of
NH4Cl, CaCl2, and MgSO47H2 with casamino acids (CAA) as the carbon source.
Controlling Stationary Culture Density. We manipulated density by controlling the
limiting resource in the media, carbon, allowing us to tune the carrying capacity of each
treatment (Fig S1). To cover a variety of densities, we generated a CAA range between
0.05% and 0.25% via dilutions of a 0.5% CAA minimal media stock for a total of 17
different stationary phase densities. This produced a range of densities environments
from 1.18x108 cells/ml to 2.02x109 cells/ml. Overnight cultures were grown in LB
gentamicin 100ug/ml and centrifuged at 8,500 x g for 2 minutes. The cells were then
washed twice and resuspended in carbonless minimal media and then adjusted to 0.05
OD600. Aliquots of the various CAA treatments were inoculated with the appropriate
strains at a concentration of 10ul/ml. Then, 200 uL of each sample was added to a 96well microplate and blank minimal media was used as a negative control. Plates were
incubated with continuous shaking at 37 °C in a Hidex Sense plate reader and growth
curves were generated by absorbance readings taken at 30-min intervals for a period of
18hrs.

Measuring QS Response. To measure population response, we performed growth-curve
experiments as previously described using PAO1 lasB-GFP, additionally taking
fluorescence readings at 30-min intervals. Readings at end exponential phase were
extracted and plotted as population level response. Controls were done with the QS signal
deficient mutant PAO1 ΔlasI/ΔrhlI lasB-GFP.
To measure individual response, we performed growth-curve experiments as previously
described, but removed samples for microscopy as they reached end exponential phase. A
small aliquot (5ul) was immediately added to a 1.5% agarose pad to immobilize cells and
imaged in the dark on a Nikon Eclipse TI inverted microscope at 20x magnification. Both
bright field and green fluorescence (20% Lumencor light engine power, 200ms exposure,
and 64x gain- sufficient for imaging of low fluorescent cells without saturating pixel
intensity) channels were captured. Between 5,000 and 15,000 individual cells were
captured for each sample. Aliquots were diluted with carbonless minimal media when
required to ensure an even distribution of cells. Images were imported into ImageJ, cells
were identified on bright field images, and an ROI (region of interest) was generated for
each individual cell. These ROIs were then overlaid onto the corresponding fluorescent
image, and pixel intensity was then measured as a proxy for level of QS response. Data
shown has normalized pixel intensity from 0-255 to a 0-1 scale. This data was then
analyzed in R via the mixtools package [35], which fits gaussian distributions to
experimental data. While fitting gaussian distributions allows a non-zero probability of
negative values, this is not a prevalent issue due to the minimal negative counts imposed
on the data. As our data is bimodal, this results in two curves generated per sample, an
OFF and an ON distribution. The package also allows for quantification of mixing
proportions (λ) and mean (μ) for each distribution. Population level response can also be
summarized as the sum of each individual’s pixel intensity divided by total number of
observed individuals. The trend of both the population microplate data and averaged
microscope data agreed, so the latter is provided in this paper.

Figure S1. Efficacy of controlling stationary phase density by varying carbon availability. A) Growth
curves for samples across different carbon limitations, error bars denote 4 replicates each. Growth data
(carrying capacity, k, and growth rate, r) was determined by fitting a logistic growth equation to the raw
data. B) Carrying capacity of the culture increases with increasing carbon concentration. C) Carbon
concentration had minimal impact on growth rate of the bacteria. There was a statistically significant
difference between group means as determined by one-way ANOVA (p = <0.001), but post hoc
comparisons using the Tukey-Kramer HSD test indicated that the only significant differences were between
0.05% carbon and 0.07% (p = 0.002) and 0.05% and the rest (p < 0.0001). Even though a significant
difference was reported, it is important to note the difficulty of fitting a logistic growth model to the 0.05%
carbon condition due to the similarity in starting density and carry capacity. This is reflected by the
increased spread in 0.05% growth rates.

Figure S2. Microplate data. Cultures were grown as mentioned in the method section and fluorescence and
OD600 were measured on a Hidex Sense plate reader. Microplate results agree with microscopy results that
that population response to increasing cell density is linear and graded.

Figure S3. The data were re-analyzed by fixing one component to the mean population value and allowing
the other to vary. Linear regressions were performed for each plot to assess the relative contribution of the
two observed components (proportion ON and intensity ON). A) Two component reaction norm with both
components allowed to vary, y = 0.857x – 0.0627, R2 = 0.9129. B) Single component reaction norm with
fixed intensity ON, y = 0.294x + 0.172, R2 = 0.5518. C) Single component reaction norm with fixed
proportion ON, y = 0.638x + 0.0161, R2 = 0.8526.

Table S1. Cultures were grown as mentioned in the method section and then stained for 5 minutes with
propidium iodide (PI) at a 1:100 concentration to determine cell viability. PI is a common red-fluorescent
intercalating agent that only binds to DNA of membrane-compromised bacteria. The average reported nonviable proportion is 0.00659 (+/- 0.00561) and proportions are un-correlated with density (linear regression,
F statistic: 2.153 on 1 and 15 DF, p-value: 0.1629).
