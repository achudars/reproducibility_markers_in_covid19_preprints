Abstract

Mechanical cell competition is important during tissue development, cancer invasion, and tissue ageing. Heterogeneity plays a key role in practical applications since cancer cells can have
different cell stiffness and different proliferation rates than normal cells. To study this phenomenon, we propose a one-dimensional mechanical model of heterogeneous epithelial tissue
dynamics that includes cell-length-dependent proliferation and death mechanisms. Proliferation
and death are incorporated into the discrete model stochastically and arise as source/sink terms
in the corresponding continuum model that we derive. Using the discrete model and the new
continuum description, we explore several applications including the evolution of homogeneous
tissues experiencing proliferation and death, and competition in a heterogeneous setting with a
cancerous tissue competing for space with an adjacent normal tissue. This framework allows us
to postulate new mechanisms that explain the ability of cancer cells to outcompete healthy cells
through mechanical differences rather than by having some intrinsic proliferative advantage.

Key words: discrete, individual-based, cell-based, continuum-limit, coarse-graining, cell migration,
cell proliferation, cell death.

Introduction

In cell biology, epithelial tissues are continuously experiencing forces and replacing cells, through
cell proliferation and death, to maintain homeostasis. These tissues can be naturally heterogeneous
or heterogeneous due to to cancer development and progression [14, 36]. This heterogeneity is observed at multiple scales, from sub-cellular to cellular to the tissue scale [44], and can result in cell
competition. Cell competition can act as a quality control mechanism in tissue development or as a
defence against precancerous cells, and harnessing cell competition has been suggested as a possible
approach to enhance both cell-based cancer and regenerative therapies [37]. Therefore, gaining a
greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying cell competition is very desirable. In mathematical models of cell competition the classical hypothesis is that cells compete due to differences
in their intrinsic proliferation rates. However, this may not be true and mathematical models have
began to explore different mechanisms [19, 48]. We will explore mechanical cell competition.

In the emerging field of mechanical cell competition, winner cells compress neighbouring cells
promoting tissue crowding and regions of higher density, which leads to cell death [5, 21, 47], while
cell proliferation occurs in regions of lower density [13]. In this work, we focus on mechanical cell
competition arising from the coupling of a cell-based model of epithelial tissue mechanics with celllength-dependent proliferation and death mechanisms. We consider mechanical forces to be driven by
cell stiffness which is important for cancer progression [41], cancer detection [36], morphogenesis [10],
and wound healing [9]. A grand challenge in cell biology is to understand how tissue-level outcomes
are related to cell-based mechanisms, especially when experiments are performed by focusing on a
single scale, and many cellular processes occur over multiple overlapping timescales [6, 48]. Therefore,
we apply mathematical modelling with in silico simulations to develop a framework to quantitatively
connect cell-level mechanisms with tissue-level outcomes.
Many mathematical modelling frameworks, including both discrete models and continuum models, have been used to study cell migration and cell proliferation. In discrete models individual cell
properties and inter-cellular interactions can be prescribed [33, 34]. However, discrete models often
lack macroscopic intuition and can be computationally intensive, especially with proliferation and
death included, which are commonly stochastic and require many realizations to understand the average behaviour. Continuum models commonly include proliferation and death through source/sink
terms and may require constitutive equations to close the system [3, 21, 25, 39, 43]. In general,
continuum models do not make the underlying cell-level processes clear [12]. However, continuum
models can be less computationally expensive than discrete models and can be analysed with wellestablished mathematical techniques such as stability analysis [1] and phase plane analysis [18].
We are most interested in models that connect the discrete and continuum scales [4, 11, 26, 32,
35, 46, 49] because this allows us to switch between the two spatial scales and take advantage of both.
To do so, we focus on a mechanical model and extend the works of Murray et al. [28, 29, 30, 31],
Lorenzi et al. [23], Baker et al. [2], and Murphy et al. [27] to a new model for fully heterogeneous
populations which experience both proliferation and death. This framework allows us to explore
mechanical cell competition, which was not previously possible.
This work is structured as follows. In Section 2, we present a new discrete mechanical model that
includes cell-length-dependent proliferation and death mechanisms. We then derive the corresponding novel continuum model that takes the form of a system of coupled nonlinear partial differential
equations with both hyperbolic and parabolic properties. In Section 3.1, we explore our novel model
by considering the evolution of a homogeneous tissue where cells are undergoing both proliferation
and death. In Section 3.2, we explore mechanical cell competition in the context of cancer invasion
by heterogeneous tissue composed of both cancerous and normal cells that compete for space. Using
the model we explore whether cancer cells will eventually replace all of the healthy cells or can the
cancer cells coexist with the healthy cells?

Model formulation

In this section, we focus on how we stochastically implement cell proliferation and death for heterogeneous cell populations within the discrete mechanical framework and the derivation of the continuum
description.

2.1

Discrete model

We start by describing the mechanical model and then include proliferation and death. We represent
the epithelial tissue as a one-dimensional chain of cells, connected at cell boundaries, in a fixed domain
of length L. The cells experience cell-cell interaction forces at their cell boundaries, for example cellcell adhesion [17] or compressive stresses [24]. For a system of N cells, cell i has left and right cell
N
boundaries at positions xN
i (t), xi+1 (t), respectively. Fixed boundary conditions at x = 0 and x = L
N
are imposed xN
1 (t) = 0 and xN +1 (t) = L. To allow for heterogeneous tissues, each cell i, which can

be thought of here as a mechanical spring, is prescribed with intrinsic cell properties including a cell
stiffness, kiN , and resting cell length, aN
i (Figure 1a). Assuming cell motion occurs in an overdamped
environment, the evolution of cell boundary i in a system of N cells is
η

dxN
i (t)
N
N
= fiN (liN (t)) − fi−1
(li−1
(t)),
dt

i = 2, . . . , N,

(1)

where η > 0 is the viscosity coefficient and fiN (li (t)) is the cell-cell interaction force [27]. This cellcell interaction force law may be given by, for example, a cubic, Hertz, Lennard-Jones, or JohnsonKendall-Roberts law [2, 23, 29]. However, for simplicity, we choose a Hookean force law,


fiN (liN (t)) = kiN liN (t) − aN
,
i

(2)

N
where cell i has length liN (t) = xN
i+1 (t) − xi (t) > 0.

We include cell proliferation stochastically, by considering that cell i proliferates with probability
P (liN (t))dt in the small time interval [t, t + dt), that depends on the current cell length, liN (t), and
proliferation mechanism P (·) [2, 38]. When cell i proliferates we increase the number of cells by one
+1
N +1
N
N
by introducing a new cell boundary, xN
i+1 , at the midpoint of the original cell, xi+1 = (xi +xi+1 )/2,

and relabel indices accordingly (Figure 1a). Daughter cells take the same intrinsic cell properties
as the parent cell. Cell death is included similarly to cell proliferation with a cell-length-dependent
+1
death mechanism, D(liN (t)). In a system of N + 1 cells, when cell i dies, with cell boundaries xN
i
+1
and xN
i+1 , the number of cells is reduced by one. The two cell boundaries are set to instantly

coalesce at the midpoint of the dying cell (Figure 1b). Cell death at the tissue boundaries needs to
be considered separately (Supplementary Material S1.2). In this work, we consider constant, linear,
and logistic models of proliferation and death (Table 1, Figure 2). We solve discrete Equations (1)
together with a stochastic implementation of proliferation and death numerically (Supplementary
Material S2.1).

Proliferation and death rates remain dependent on the length of each cell. This could also represent
a single tissue with internal heterogeneity.

2.2

Derivation of continuum model

To understand the mean behaviour of the discrete model we must average over many identically
prepared stochastic realizations. However, this can be computationally intensive, especially for
large N . The corresponding continuum model, which we first present and then derive, represents
the average behaviour and unlike the discrete model the computational time required to solve the
continuum model is independent of N .
The continuum model for the evolution of the cell density, q(x, t), in terms of the continuous
cell-cell interaction force, f (x, t), proliferation rate, P (1/q(x, t)), and death rate, D(1/q(x, t)), is

(4)

with cell stiffness, k(x, t), and the resting cell length, a(x, t), also being described by continuous
fields. These intrinsic mechanical cell properties are constant for each cell and transported by the
motion of cells. The proliferation and death functions, P (·) and D(·), respectively, (Table 1) are
evaluated at 1/q(x, t). Depending on the choice of proliferation and death mechanisms we may have
additional intrinsic cellular properties, β(x, t), γ(x, t), and ld (x, t). All intrinsic cellular properties
which are constant are governed by transport equations of the form
∂χ(x, t)
∂χ(x, t)
+ u(x, t)

∂t
∂x

χ = k, a, β, γ, ld ,

force through
u(x, t) =

1
∂f (x, t)
.
ηq(x, t) ∂x

(6)

From Equation (6), the cell density flux, j(x, t) = q(x, t)u(x, t), is equal to the spatial gradient of
the cell-cell interaction force, (1/η)∂f /∂x. We solve the system of Equations (3)-(6) together with
initial conditions and boundary conditions numerically (Supplementary Material S2.2).
We now systematically derive Equation (3). We take care to explicitly state and make clear
all approximations made in this derivation. We incorporate proliferation and then death into the
modelling framework, under the assumption that the two processes are independent. The previously
derived mechanical relaxation term and transport of cellular property equations (5) are briefly discussed [27]. For clarity, the derivation is shown for one spring per cell. However, this analysis can
be extended to m > 1 springs per cell which, for sufficiently small N , is a more appropriate method
to define the continuous field functions [27] (Supplementary Material S1.1).

2.2.1

Proliferation

As cell proliferation is included stochastically (Sections 2.1, S2.1), we consider an infinitesimal time
interval [t, t + dt) and condition on the possible proliferation events that could occur and influence
the position of cell boundary i in a system of N cells. Choosing dt sufficiently small so that at most
one proliferation event can occur in [t, t + dt), there are four possibilities: i) there is no proliferation,
in which case the cell boundary position xN
i only changes by mechanical relaxation; ii) there is
proliferation to the right of cell i − 1; iii) there is proliferation to the left of cell i − 1; and iv) cell i − 1
proliferates. This leads to the following infinitesimal evolution law for the position of cell boundary
xN
i , accounting for cell relabelling when a new cell is added:

Equation (11) is only valid for the time interval [t, t + dt) under the assumptions iv) and v) above.
Thus far, we have extended the discrete model with mechanical relaxation to include the effects of
cell proliferation. However, the statistically averaged model still retains information about discrete
cell entities. We thus average over space to define a continuum cell density. Following Murphy et al.
[27], we introduce the microscopic density of cells,
q̂(x, t) =

where δ is the Dirac delta function [8, 22]. We define a local spatial average over a length scale δx,
denoted h·iδx , such that ai  δx  L, which is sufficiently large to capture local heterogeneities for
cellular properties that are constant during cell motion, including k and a, but sufficiently small to
define continuous properties across L. The continuous cell density function, q(x, t), is thus defined
as

On the right hand side of Equation (11), the first two terms involving f correspond to a mechanical
contribution. This contribution is unchanged compared to Murphy et al. [27] and, when substituted
into Equation (14), it gives rise to the mechanical relaxation term in the right hand side of continuum
model Equation (3) (Supplementary Material S1.4). We now focus only on the contribution due to
proliferation determined by substituting the proliferation terms of Equation (11) into Equation (14),

At this point, we see that all explicit references to the total number of cells, N (t), vanish. This
allows the validity of the derivation, initially restricted to the time interval [t, t + dt), to be extended
RL
to arbitrary times. As N (t) = 0 q(x, t) dx, the change in the total cell number with time due
to proliferation is accounted for through the source term written in Equation (22). We also stated
assumption vii) that held true when sufficiently far from the tissue boundary but we find that this
works at the boundary also (Sections 3.1, 3.2). Equation (22) shows proliferation arises as a single
source term consistent with usual continuum-based formulations of proliferation whereas in Baker
et al. [2] proliferation arises as this term with an additional contribution.
2.2.2

Death

The derivation of the cell death sink term follows similarly to that of the cell proliferation source
term. We again consider an infinitesimally small time interval [t, t + dt), so that at most one cell
death event can occur in [t, t + dt), and condition on cell death events to understand all possible
events that occur and influence cell boundary i at t + dt. This gives

Then, following the same approach as the proliferation derivation, we arrive at the sink term in

2.2.3

Cell properties

Each cell is prescribed with intrinsic mechanical, proliferation, and death properties which are taken
to be constant for each cell throughout the simulation. For mechanical cell properties, which include
cell stiffness and resting cell length, we have the relationships χ(xN
i (t), t) = χi for χ = k, a. Similar
relationships can be defined for the proliferation and death cell properties, β, γ, ld . Differentiating
these equations with respect to time we obtain Equations (5) [27].

Numerical results

In this section, we first explore the evolution of a homogeneous tissue with different proliferation
and death mechanisms and then explore mechanical cell competition for a heterogeneous tissue.

3.1

A homogeneous tissue

The simplest case to consider first is a homogeneous tissue composed of a population of identical
cells. We explore three different proliferation and death mechanisms: constant, linear, and logistic
(Table 1, Figure 2). For each mechanism we explore proliferation only, death only, and proliferation
with death. Cell proliferation and death parameters (Figure 2) are chosen to observe homeostasis
where the total cell number remains stable at approximately N (t) = 40 for t > 0.
In all simulations we set L = 10, use a Gaussian initial density centred at x = L/2 with variance
three and scaled to have N (0) = 40. We set k = 10, so that mechanical relaxation is fast in comparison to the proliferation and death [2]. For individual realizations this results in uniform densities
except for short-time transient behaviour following a cell proliferation or death event (Figures 3.1a-c,
3.1a-c, S3.2a-c). For simplicity and to represent that cells in an epithelial tissue are understood to
be in extension [48], we set a = 0 throughout this work.
For individual discrete realizations, cell proliferation causes a localised force imbalance followed by
fast mechanical relaxation towards mechanical equilibrium and an overall increase in density (Figures
3.1a, 3.1a, S3.2a). Similarly, cell death results in a decrease in density followed by fast mechanical
relaxation and an overall decrease in density (Figures 3.1b, 3.1b, S3.2b). With proliferation and
death, cell boundaries are repeatedly introduced and removed, and the overall density remains, on
average, constant (Figures 3.1c, 3.1c, S3.2c).
We observe excellent agreement when we compare the mean of many identically prepared discrete
realizations and the corresponding solutions of the continuum model for both density snapshots and
total cell number (Figures 3.1d-o, 3.1d-o, S3.2d-o).
We note that the continuum model does not always provide a good match with an individual
realization of the discrete model. For example, for constant proliferation and constant death with
equal rates, every discrete realization will eventually become extinct (Supplementary Material S3.1)
as proliferation and death are independent of mechanical relaxation. This is expected as the total
cell number is a linear birth-death process [40]. As a consequence, the standard deviation of the
total cell number increases with time (Figures 3.1o). When cell proliferation and death are celllength-dependent there is closer agreement between the continuum model and single realizations of
the discrete model as extinction is extremely unlikely and the standard deviation of averaged discrete
realizations is smaller (Figures 3.1o, S3.2o).

3.2

Mechanical cell competition

How tissues compete with each other for space is of great interest with many open biological questions
being pursued in the experimental cell biology literature [5, 21, 45]. For example, in cancer invasion
in an epithelial tissue a key question is whether cancer cells will eventually replace the entire healthy
tissue or can the cancer cells coexist with the healthy cells? We consider this question by simulating
a heterogeneous tissue composed of two populations, cancer cells adjacent to healthy cells (Figure
1c). Biologically, it is a hallmark of cancer cells that they are more proliferative and resistant to
death than healthy cells [15]. In existing models the standard procedure would be to include these
hallmarks as modelling assumptions and not consider the role of mechanical relaxation. However, we
will now show this assumption is not necessary. We find that mechanical differences are sufficient for
these hallmarks to arise and for cancer cells to outcompete healthy cells. We prescribe cancer and
healthy cells the same proliferation and death mechanisms and parameters. We ask a further key
question, how does mechanical relaxation alone compare to mechanical relaxation with proliferation,
and to mechanical relaxation with proliferation and death?
In all scenarios, the left tissue (tissue 1) is coloured red to represent cancer cells and the right
tissue (tissue 2) is coloured blue to represent healthy cells (Figure 1c). Each tissue starts with 20
cells. We assume cancer cells have lower stiffness than healthy cells [20] so we set cells in tissue 1
and 2 with cell stiffnesses K1 = 10 and K2 = 20, respectively. Again, we set a = 0.
With only mechanical relaxation the interface position, s(t), relaxes to the long-time interface
position, S = limt→∞ s(t) = 6.66 [27]. In this scenario, the cancer and healthy cells coexist. However, the assumption of mechanical relaxation alone is only realistic over a short timescale where
proliferation and death are negligible. When we include proliferation and death below, we use this
long-time solution as the initial condition. As the mechanical relaxation rate is faster than the
proliferation and death rates, using this initial condition only neglects initial short-time transient
behaviour and does not significantly impact the long-time solution.
For mechanical relaxation with proliferation (Figure 3.2), we prescribe the linear proliferation
mechanism for both the cancer and healthy cells with the same parameters.As cancer cells have
lower cell stiffness than healthy cells, the cancer cells are always longer than the healthy cells (Supplementary Material S4.1) except for the short transients after proliferation events where the cells
have yet to mechanically relax. Initially, the cancer cells, with length 1/3, are double the length of
healthy cells. Referring to Figure 2b we see that the difference in cell lengths corresponds to cancer
cells being more likely to proliferate than the healthy cells. Therefore, the cancer cells proliferate
more than the healthy cells not because they were set to have advantageous intrinsic proliferation
or death properties through a modelling assumption, but simply due to the coupling of mechanical
relaxation with the length-dependent proliferation mechanism. With each proliferation event all cells
become smaller, with the healthy cells remaining smaller than the cancer cells. Here we have coexistence but all cells will eventually become unrealistically small and this happens first for healthy cells.

In the absence of cell death, changing the proliferation mechanism will still result in coexistence.
For mechanical relaxation with proliferation and death (Figure 3.2) a cell is more likely to die
when it is smaller (Figure 2b). As we have observed for mechanical relaxation with proliferation, the
healthy cells are smaller first, due to their higher relative stiffness, and therefore are more likely to
die first. Once all of the healthy cells have died we have a homogeneous population of cancerous cells
(Section 3.1). Importantly, we find that the cancerous cells, despite having identical proliferation
and death mechanisms, are the winner cells of mechanical cell competition; they outcompete the
healthy cells and take over the domain purely as a result of having lower cell stiffness.
Similar results regarding cancer invasion are found when considering the logistic mechanisms with
both proliferation and death (Supplementary Material S4.2). In contrast, for the constant proliferation and death mechanisms, where the proliferation and death mechanisms are both independent of
the cell length and therefore independent of mechanical relaxation, to observe cancer cells invading
the full domain we would have to prescribe the cancer cells to be more proliferative and resistant to
death than the healthy cells.

Conclusion

In this work, we present a new one-dimensional cell-based model of heterogeneous epithelial tissue
mechanics that includes cell proliferation and death. The main focus is to determine the corresponding continuum model which is a novel coupled system of nonlinear partial differential equations. The
cell density equation is a parabolic partial differential equation while the cell property equations are
hyperbolic partial differential equations. In deriving the continuum model, the discrete mechanisms
and assumptions that underpin the continuum model have been made explicit by presenting the
details of the coarse-graining derivation. Assumptions that relate to mean-field approximations and
statistical independence of quantities are normally implicitly assumed in continuum models. By
specifying the details of the derivation, and all assumptions required, our work provides insight into
situations when these assumptions hold, as well as giving insight into when these assumptions fail
to hold, such as when the number of cells, N (t), is not sufficiently large or when cell properties
vary rapidly in space. Under these conditions we recommend that the discrete description is more
appropriate than the approximate continuum description.
By coupling mechanics with proliferation and death we are able to explore biological scenarios
that could not be described in previous modelling frameworks. Specifically we can focus on mechanical cell competition driven by variations in cell stiffness and resting cell length. By choosing
mechanical relaxation rates sufficiently fast relative to proliferation rates we observe good agreement
between the average of many identically prepared stochastic realizations of the discrete model and
the corresponding solutions of the continuum model. This holds even when our simulations only
consider 40 cells which is extremely small in comparison to the number of cells in an epithelial tissue. A continuum model is beneficial as we now have a tissue-level understanding of the mechanisms
encoded in the discrete model and the time to solve the continuum model is independent of N (t).
We explore mechanical cell competition applied to cancer invasion by considering cancer cells
adjacent to healthy cells which compete for space. Interestingly, when we only allow cancer cells
and healthy cells to differ in their cell stiffnesses, as a result of mechanical coupling, we observe that
the cancer cells have more opportunities to proliferate and are less likely to die than healthy cells.
We can then identify the cancer cells, as a result of the property of lower cell stiffness, as being the
winner cells which invade the full domain. The influence of cell stiffness and cell size may therefore
be an important factor to include when interpreting proliferation and death rates in experimental
data. This analysis would not be possible using other existing models.
In all simulations we set a = 0 to model cells being in extension [48]. Setting a > 0 gives
qualitatively very similar results for homogeneous populations and also for heterogeneous populations
when cells remain in extension throughout the simulation. This modelling framework is well-suited
to be extended to cases where cells may also become compressed, for example in a tumour spheroid
[7].
Many interesting extensions to this work are possible. Mathematically, the extent to which the

continuum-limit holds with a free boundary is not yet clear. A free boundary also allows us to consider
tissue growth [42] and shrinkage in mechanically less constrained environments, such as in developmental biology. Further, explicitly incorporating additional biological mechanisms that regulate cell
size [16, 50, 51] and the evolution of intrinsic cell properties [14] would be both mathematically interesting and biologically relevant. The theoretical foundations presented here for building a discrete
model and constructing the continuum limit of that discrete model could be used to describe these
additional mechanisms in future analyses.
