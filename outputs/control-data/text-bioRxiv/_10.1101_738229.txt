Abstract

18

A wide range of differences between the subgenomes, termed as subgenome asymmetry or SA,

19

has been reported in various polyploids and different species seem to have different responses

20

to polyploidization. We compared subgenome differences in gene ratio and relative diversity

21

between artificial and natural genotypes of several allopolyploid species. Surprisingly,

22

consistent differences in neither gene ratio nor relative diversity between the subgenomes were

23

detected between these two types of polyploid genotypes although they differ in times exposed

24

to evolutional selection. As expected, the estimated ratio of retained genes between a

25

subgenome and its diploid donor was invariably higher for the artificial allopolyploid

26

genotypes due likely to the presence of variable genome components (VGC). Clearly, the

27

presence of VGC means that exaggerated differences between a donor and a subgenome in a

28

polyploid are inevitable when random genotypes were used to represent species of either a

29

polyploid or its donors. SA was also detected in genotypes before the completion of the

30

polyploidization events as well as in those which were not formed via polyploidization.

31

Considering that significant changes during and following polyploidization have been detected

32

in previous studies, our results suggest that the influence of VGC needs to be considered in

33

evaluating SA and that diploid donors may define changes in polyploid evolution.

Introduction

37
38

Polyploidy, forming new species by enveloping two or more genomes within a single nucleus,

39

is a prominent speciation process. Previous studies show that polyploidization was likely

40

involved in the evolution of all flowering plant species (Bowers et al. 2003; Paterson et al.

41

2006; Jiao et al. 2011; Van et al. 2017; Ding and Chen, 2018). Understanding why polyploid

42

species have been so pervasive and successful has attracted wide attention in the scientific

43

community worldwide. As a result, possible effects of polyploidization on various aspects of

44

plant biology have been intensively investigated (Feldman et al. 1997; Soltis and Soltis 1999;

45

Li et al. 2014a; Soltis and Soltis 2016; Van et al. 2017; Edger et al. 2018; Ghanbari et al. 2019).

46

There are two major types of polyploids: autopolyploids and allopolyploids. The former

47

results from whole-genome duplication (WGD) and each of them bears two or more copies of

48

the same genome. The majority of the latter results from inter-specific or inter-generic

49

hybridization followed by chromosome doubling, and each of them bears two or more different

50

genomes enveloped within a single nucleus. Many important crop species, including wheat,

51

cotton, Brassica, potato and banana, are typical allopolyploids.

52

Results from previous studies show that different species react differently to

53

polyploidization. Wheat (Feldman et al. 1997; Uauy et al. 2017) and Brassica (Gaeta et al.

54

2007; Liu et al. 2018) are among species for which rapid and massive changes in DNA

55

sequences were detected in newly synthesized allopolyploid genotypes. However, such

56

changes were not detected in either cotton (Liu et al. 2001; Page et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2018)

57

or Arabidopsis (Wang et al. 2006; Del Pozo et al. 2015). It is also widely believed that different

58

subgenomes of a polyploid species have different responses to internal interactions as well as

59

external stimuli. Such differences, termed as contrasted plasticity, subgenome dominance, or

60

asymmetric evolution (AE), result in subgenome asymmetry (SA) or biased features in gene

61

number, diversity or expression between the constituting subgenomes (Feldman et al. 1997;

62

Flagel and Wendel 2010; Liu et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2017; Xu et al. 2018).

63

Possible evolutionary advantages of SA have been proposed in various species (Feldman et al.

64

1997; Flagel and Wendel 2010; Grover et al. 2012; Pont et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2014; Zhang et

65

al. 2015; Kasianov et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2017; Bao et al. 2018; Xu et al. 2018).

66

Recent studies reveal that an individual genotype does not possess all genes existing in a

67

species. Genes not shared by different members of a species, termed as the dispensable or

68

variable genome components (VGC), account for about 36% in bread wheat (Liu et al. 2016;

69

Montenegro et al. 2017), 38% in barley (Ma et al. 2019), and as high as 50% in maize (Jin et

70

al. 2016). However, possible influence of VGC in studying polyploid evolution has not been

71

considered. Most of previous studies reporting the existence of SA were based on the analyses

72

of polyploid genotypes only (e.g., Pont et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2017).

73

Limited comparisons between subgenomes and their progenitors have been carried out in some

74

studies but used only random genotypes to represent the donor species (e.g., Flagel and Wendel
3

75

2010; Li et al. 2014a). Clearly, due to the existence of VGC, using random genotypes to

76

represent either a polyploid or its progenitor species would likely lead to over-estimation of

77

differences between a subgenome and its donor.

78

Artificial allopolyploid genotypes have been obtained in different studies for several

79

polyploid species. Different from those natural genotypes, the artificial ones all have very short

80

time-frames of existence. In other words, the artificial genotypes have not been exposed to

81

evolutionary selection for long thus parts of the differences between them and those natural

82

genotypes should belong to changes accumulated during evolution in the latter. Further, the

83

exact parents for some of the artificial allopolyploid genotypes are known thus using them to

84

estimate shared features between a given subgenome in a polyploid genotype and its diploid

85

donor could avoid the interference of VGC. We thus decided to use the artificial polyploid

86

genotypes as surrogates to represent the beginning of polyploid evolution in the study reported

87

here. Our results do not only show that considering VGC is important in evaluating SA but also

88

suggest that changes accumulated in polyploid evolution must be defined by their founding

89

genomes.

93

Genome and RNA sequences used

94

Sequence data from Brassica, wheat, cotton and Arabidopsis were used in this study

95

(Supplementary table 1). All the sequences were downloaded from the National Centre for

96

Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Short Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database

97

(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra).

98

For Brassica, a total of 26 sets of transcriptomic data from 25 genotypes and 15 sets of

99

genomic data from 15 genotypes were used (Supplementary table 1). The transcriptomic

100

sequences were obtained from natural genotypes representing three allotetraploid species (B.

101

juncea with a genome of AABB, B. napus with a genome of AACC and B. carinata with a

102

genome of BBCC) and their diploid progenitors (B. rapa for A subgenome, B. nigra for the B

103

subgenome, and B. alboglabra for the C genome). Sequences from artificial allotetraploids for

104

each of the three allotetraploid species and their parental genotypes were also used. They

105

included three artificial F1 hybrids with a genome of AC (di-haploids) and an allotetraploid

106

derived from reciprocal hybridization between the diploid A and C donors (genomes CCAA).

107

In addition, genomic sequences from 15 genotypes each representing the three diploid donor

108

species were used to estimate the difference in relative genetic variation among these species.

109

For wheat, 30 sets of transcriptomic data from 16 different genotypes were collected for this

110

study (Supplementary table 1). They included genotypes representing natural and artificial

111

allotetraploids (genome AABB), natural and artificial allohexaploids (genome AABBDD),

112

their three diploid donors (T. urartu accession for A genome, Ae. longissima accession for the

113

S genome, Ae. tauschii accession for the D genome), and one tatreploidploid donor (T. durum

114

(genome AABB) as the maternal donor to the hexaploid wheat). The wheat genotypes also

115

included an artificial tri-haploid (genome ABD) and a hexaploid (genome AABBDD) derived

116

from it by chromosome doubling. It is of note that the S genome from Ae. Longissimi was used

117

as the surrogate for the B subgenome donor in the artificial polyploids. Results from a recent

118

study indicates that the B subgenome donor was likely the product from introgressions of

119

several Aegilops species that yet to be identified if not already extinct (El Baidouri et al. 2017).

120

For cotton, genomic sequences from seven genotypes were used (Supplementary table 1).

121

They included four natural allotetraploids, two belonging to the subspecies G. hirsutum and

122

the other two belonging to G. barbadebse. They all share the same genome structure of AADD

123

(Song et al. 2017). They also include one artificial tetraploid (genome AADD) and its two

124

diploid parents (an accession of G. arboretum as the A genome donor and an accession of G.

125

raimondii as the D genome donor).

126

Eighteen sets of transcriptomic data from Arabidopsis were also used in this study

127

(Supplementary table 1). They were derived from one artificial and nine natural allotetraploid

128

genotypes (all with a genome of AATT) with their two diploid subgenome donors (an accession

129

from A. arenosa as the A genome donor and an accession from A. thaliana as the T genome

130

donor).

131
132

Transcriptomic sequence analyses

133

Based on the initial assessments using the software FastQC (version 0.11.5) (Andrews 2016),

134

transcriptomic sequences were trimmed and filtered using the software SolexaQA++ (Cox et

135

al. 2010). Low quality reads were removed with the criteria of Q<30 and length<50bp. As both

136

the quality and quantity of sequences would likely influence the estimation of the numbers of

137

genes in a genome and the percentage of shares genes between genotypes, we decided to control

138

the quantity of sequences for each of genotype based on its relative genome size. For example,

139

as the B subgenome or its diploid progenitor is bigger than the diploid A genome donor in

140

wheat (Ling et al. 2013; IWGSC 2014; Avni et al. 2017), a larger quantity of the trimmed

141

sequences was used for the former. Further, similar quantities of sequences were used for the

142

artificial and natural genotypes (Supplementary table 1).

143

Following the quality and quantity controls, the selected transcriptomic sequences were

144

assembled using Trinity (version 2.5.1) (Grabherr et al. 2011) with K-mers=25 and de novo

145

assembled with a minimum length of 200bp. Redundant sequences were then removed using

146

the cd-hit package (version 4.6.4) (Li and Godzik 2006) with the sequence similarity threshold

147

of 95%. Coding sequences (CDS) for the assembly sequences were then predicted using

148

TransDecoder (version 5.0.2) (https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder/releases).

149

In estimating genes shared between the subgenomes with their respective diploid donors,

150

BLAST+ (version 2.7.1) (Camacho et al. 2009) was used to identify syntenic genes with a

151

minimum E-value of 1e-5, a minimum coverage size of 100bp and a minimum identity

152

threshold of 95%. The diploid sequences were first used as a query to BLAST against the

153

polyploid sequences and then a reciprocal analysis was carried out by using the polyploid

154

sequences as a query to BLAST against the diploid sequences. A custom script (Powell et al.

155

2017) was used to retrieve all those sequences where the polyploids or diploids gave the best

156

hits. These sequences were used to calculate the percentages of genes shared between a given

157

subgenome and its diploid donor.

158
159

Genomic sequence analyses

160

Quality control of the genomic sequences was also carried out using the software FastQC

161

(version 0.11.5) (Andrews 2016) and low-quality sequences were removed using SolexaQA++

162

(Cox et al. 2010) with Q<30 and length<50bp. The selected genomic reads were assembled

163

using the software SOAPdenovo2-r240 (Luo et al. 2012) with the default settings based on k-

164

mer size 63 for cotton, and k-mer size 55 for Arabidopsis. The GapCloser (including in

165

SOAPdenovo2 package) was used to reduce gaps among the assembled scaffolds and the cd-

166

hit package (version 4.6.4) (Li and Godzik 2006) was used to remove redundant sequences. For

167

the genomic sequences from cotton, gene prediction was conducted by comparing sequences

168

with known protein structures with DIAMOND blastx (Buchfink et al. 2015) (E value < 10-10

169

and bitscore > 60) based on the SWISS-PROT database (Bairoch and Apweiler 1999). The

170

gene prediction of Arabidopsis was conducted by augustus (version 3.2.3) (Stanke and

171

Morgenstern 2005) with the default settings. The genes predicted from A. thaliana and A.

172

arenosa were used to identify shared genes in the subgenomes of the artificial allotetraploids,

173

because sequences from the parents of the artificial allotetraploid were not available. The same

174

methods described above for the transcriptomic sequences were used to identify genes in

175

genome or subgenome and to calculate the percentage of genes shared between them.

176

For estimating the relative diversity among the three diploid donor species in Brassica,

177

genome sequences were used to identify SNPs in each of them. Sequence reads were mapped

178

to the reference genome of B. rapa (assembly Brapa_1.0), B. nigra (assembly ASM168289V1)

179

and B. oleracea (assembly BOL) with BWA (version 0.7.12) (Li and Durbin 2009), after

180

viewed and sorted by SAMtools (version 1.5) (Li 2011), duplicates were removed by samtools

181

rmdup and SNPs were identified using SAMtools mpileup by skipping alignments with mapQ

182

smaller than 20, finally filtered SNPs with DP < 4 and SNPs within 3 base pairs of an indel by

183

SAMtools/BCFtools (version 1.5) (Li 2011). Genome diversity for each of the species was

184

calculated by dividing the total numbers of SNPs with the genome size.

185
186

Results

187

Gene ratios between the subgenomes for a given species are highly consistent despite of

188

the wide variation in predicted CDS or gene numbers among different data sets used

189

As expected, the numbers of predicted CDS or genes do not only vary among genotypes but

190

also for a given subgenome among genotypes. The largest variations were found for the three

191

polyploid species of Brassica, where more than two-fold differences in the number of predicted

192

genes were detected. These differences apparently reflect differences in the quantity and quality

193

of sequences from various sources (Supplementary table 2). However, the differences did not

194

seem affected the estimated gene ratios between subgenomes much. In fact, the estimated gene

195

ratios between subgenomes among various genotypes for a given species are highly consistent.

196

It was the same subgenome which gave a lower or higher ratio of genes among different

197

genotypes for a given species, irrespective of either transcriptomic or genomic sequences were

198

used for the analyses. Specifically, the B subgenome is the one giving a higher ratio of genes

in B. juncea (genome AABB); C subgenome for B. carinata (genome BBCC); C subgenome

200

for B. napus (genome AACC); B subgenome for tetraploid (genome AABB) wheat and D

201

subgenome for the tetraploid cotton (genome AADD) (table 1). The highly consistent gene

202

ratios obtained between subgenomes among the different allopolyploid genotypes indicate that

203

the use of large quantity of high-quality sequences is not critical in estimating gene ratios

204

among subgenomes.

205
206

Significant and consistent difference in gene ratio among subgenomes was not detected

207

between natural and artificial allopolyploids

208

Compared with natural ones, the artificial allopolyploid genotypes all have very short times

209

frames of existence. We thus decided to use the artificial genotypes as surrogates to represent

210

the beginning of polyploid evolution, and estimated changes accumulated during evolution.

211

Surprisingly, little difference in gene ratio was detected between the artificial and natural

212

polyploid genotypes for any of the species studied when sequences from the same tissue was

213

used. These included the estimations based on the use of the transcriptomic data for the four

214

artificial and five natural allotetraploid genotypes of B. napus (table 1 and fig.1); for the one

215

artificial and two natural genotypes of B. carinata (table 1 and fig.1), for the one artificial and

216

two natural polyploid genotypes of B. juncea (table 1 and fig.1), for the six natural and two

217

artificial tetraploid genotypes of wheat (table 1 and fig. 1). Similar results were also obtained

218

based on the analysis of genomic sequences on cotton, although the natural genotypes of this

219

species have a much longer history of evolution compared with either the polyploid Brassica

220

or wheat (Paterson et al. 2012) (table 1 and fig. 1).

Difference in gene ratios between subgenomes was detected before polyploidization

224

As mentioned earlier, the process of forming the majority of allopolyploids can be divided into

225

two steps: inter-specific or inter-generic hybridization and chromosome doubling. Assuming

226

that the two diploid species (one with a genome of XX and the other YY) are involved in

227

forming an allotetraploid genotype, the first step results in the formation of a di-haploid with a

228

genome XY, and the allotetraploid with a genome XXYY will then be formed with the

229

completion of the second step. To examine possible changes in gene ratios among the

230

subgenomes before and after the polyploidization event, we analysed an artificial F1 tri-haploid

231

hybrid (genome ABD) and its corresponding allohexapolyploid genotype (genome AABBDD)

232

based on the available transcriptome sequences from these materials. This analysis showed that

233

the gene ratios among the subgenomes between these two genotypes were very similar (table

234

2). As rapid and intensive changes following polyploidisation have been reported in previous

235

studies (Soltis and Soltis 1999; Adams et al. 2005; Soltis et al. 2015; Soltis and Soltis 2016),

236

the results from this analysis can only be explained by the likelihood that the founding genomes

237

define changes caused by polyploidization in the subgenomes of a polyploid.

238
239

Gene ratios in allopolyploid genotypes not formed via polyploidization events

240

Different from those for the majority of allotetraploid species, the allotetraploid species of

241

Arabidopsis suecica can be synthesized without the step of polyploidization. As the A

242

subgenome donor is already a tetraploid (with a genome of AAAA), the first step in generating

243

artificial A. suecica genotypes is to generate an autotetraploid genotype of A. thaliana by

244

doubling its chromosomes. Then an allotetraploid with a genome of AATT can be generated

245

by crossing the two autotetraploid genotypes. Thus, comparing gene ratios between the

246

artificial allotetraploid genotypes with those natural ones of A. suecica provides another mean

247

to test the possible effect of polyploidization on SA. Again, little difference in gene ratio

248

between the subgenomes was detected between these two types of allotetraploid genotypes

249

(table 3 and fig. 1).

250
251

Differences in relative gene diversity among the three subgenomes of the various

252

allopolyploid Brassica species correlate with those among their diploid donors

253

To evaluate the possible relationship between a subgenome and its diploid donor, we estimated

254

the gene diversity among the three diploid donors which contributed to the three subgenomes

255

of the polyploid genotypes assessed. As expected, the numbers of predicted SNPs increased

256

with the increase in quantity of sequences used. With a similar amount of sequences used, the

257

relative gene diversity among the three diploid donors was in the order of B. rapa (AA) > B.

258

oleracea (CC) > B. nigra (BB), which is the same as their order as subgenomes in the various

259

allotetraploids (Supplementary table 2). The same order in relative gene diversity between the

260

three subgenomes and the three diploid donors again cannot be a coincidence. Rather, they

261

must indicate changes occurred in the subgenomes must be defined by their founding genomes.

262
263

Difference in the ratio of shared genes between a subgenome and its diploid donor

264

between artificial and natural polyploid genotypes

265

Considering the existence of VGC, the ratios of shared genes between a subgenome and its

266

diploid donor should be higher for an artificial polyploid than for those natural polyploids. This

267

is because that the exact diploid donors for the former are known thus influences from the VGC

268

can be removed when conducting such an analysis. We conducted such a comparison for

269

Brassica, wheat, cotton and Arabidopsis. As expected, the ratios shared genes between the

270

artificial tetraploid with its two diploid parental genotypes are indeed significantly higher than

271

those shared between the natural genotypes and those ‘random’ diploid genotypes from the

272

progenitor species for each of these species assessed (tables 1, 3). These results reflect the

273

importance of considering variations among individual genotypes within and between species

274

in investigating the mechanism of polyploid evolution. In other words, the presence of VGC

275

means that using random diploid genotypes would invariably lead to under-estimation of

276

shared gene ratios between a subgenome and its diploid donor.

277
278

Discussion

279
280

Polyploids are pervasive in flowering plants and SA has been reported in all allopolyploid

281

species investigated to date. Differences in many aspects, including gene number and relative

282

diversity, have been used to assess SA (Akhunov et al. 2003; Qi et al. 2004) and that and

283

epigenetic variation seems to affect subgenome dominance (Hollister and Gaut 2009; Guo and

284

Han 2014; Song et al. 2015; Cheng et al. 2016; Bird et al. 2018; Cheng et al. 2018; Ding and

285

Chen 2018; Xu et al. 2018). Many previous studies on polyploid evolution analysed natural

286

genotypes only and treated differences detected between subgenomes as originated from

287

asymmetric evolution (Flagel et al. 2010; Schnable et al. 2011; Feldman and Levy 2012;

288

Cuadrado et al. 2013; Guo and Han 2014; El Baidouri et al. 2017; Bao et al. 2018; Xu et al.

289

2018). To investigate possible changes in SA during evolution, we compared artificial and

290

natural genotypes of several allopolyploid species. Different from those natural genotypes,

291

artificial polyploids have hardly been exposed to evolutionary processes and their exact donors

292

are known. With the believe that AE alters SA, we expected to find significantly enhanced

293

levels of differences between the subgenomes in the natural genotypes. Surprisingly, little

294

differences in either gene ratio or relative diversity among subgenomes were detected between

295

these two types of allopolyploid genotypes. By examining di-haploid genotypes, we further

296

showed that polyploidization does not seem to have dramatic influence on SA in allopolyploid

297

genotypes. Rather, our results suggest that the differences observed between subgenomes of a

298

polyploid seem to simply reflect those between the diploid donors of a polyploid. The less

299

variable subgenome of a polyploid genotype was derived from the less variable diploid donor

300

and they tend to share a higher ratio of genes. These results seem to contradict with those

301

previous studies which have shown unequivocally that extensive changes do occur during and

302

following polyploidization in at least some species (Qi et al. 2004; Cheng et al. 2016; Edger et

303

al. 2017). The contradiction can be explained by the likelihood that founding genomes are

304

critical in defining changes during polyploid evolution. In other words, considering that

305

significant changes in various aspects including gene number (Akhunov et al. 2003; Qi et al.

306

2004), diversity (Adams et al. 2005) and epigenetic regulation (Wendel et al. 2000; Guo and

307

Han 2014; Song et al. 2015; Cheng et al. 2016; Ding and Chen 2018; Edger et al. 2018) have

308

been detected in polyploid evolution, our results suggest that the levels and directions of the

309

changes during and following polyploidization events could be profoundly influenced by the

310

founding genomes.

311

It is important to note that assaying whole gene contents for any of the genotypes used in

312

this study is not our intention and that they are not required for estimating either gene ratios or

313

relative diversity between subgenomes. Clearly, only expressed genes can be detected in

314

transcriptomic analysis and the expression of many genes can be tissue-specific (Coram et al.

315

2008; Mittapalli et al. 2010; Fagerberg et al. 2014). However, with the use of a single set of

316

parameters, comparing subgenomes with the large quantity of expressed genes should likely

317

provide high-quality estimates for both gene ratio and relative diversity. This likelihood is

318

supported by the fact that the obtained results in this study are highly consistent in that

319

significant difference was not detected between artificial and natural polyploid genotypes for

320

any of the species investigated with the use of transcriptomic sequences from different tissues.

321

Considering the large number of combinations of genotypes by tissues used, the highly

322

consistent results cannot be a coincidence. Similarly, the genomic sequences used in this study
13

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/738229; this version posted August 16, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

323

may not be adequate for high quality whole genome assembly for any of the genotypes from

324

which they were generated. However, the results obtained from the genomic sequences again

325

showed consistently that significant changes in neither gene ratio nor relative diversity among

326

subgenomes were not detected between artificial and natural polyploid genotypes.

327

In addition to epigenetic regulations, previous studies in Brassica also showed that genomic

328

exchanges including non-reciprocal homoeologous ones also affect SA (Chalhoub et al. 2014;

329

Liu et al. 2014; An et al. 2019; Lu et al. 2019). However, similar to that found in any other

330

species examined in this study, significant changes in SA was not detected between the

331

artificial and natural genotypes and the differences observed between subgenomes seem to

332

simply reflect those between the diploid donors. In fact, the triangle formed among the three

333

diploids and their corresponding subgenomes in Brassica provides strong evidence showing

334

the relationship between a subgenome in an allopolyploid and its diploid donors. The A

335

subgenomes in either of the allotetraploids it was involved in (B. juncea with a genome of

336

AABB and B. napus with a genome of AACC) was the one containing the lower gene ratios;

337

the C subgenome is the one containing a higher gene ratios in both of the allotetraploids it was

338

involved (B. napus with a genome of AACC and B. carinata with a genome of BBCC); and

339

the B subgenome is the one containing a higher ratio in the combination of AB (B. juncea) but

340

it is the one containing a lower ratio of genes in the combination of BC (B. carinata).

341

Different from many other species, the artificial allotetraploids of Arabidopsis (genome AATT)

342

were not formed via typical polyploidization. They were generated by hybridizing two

343

autotetraploid genotypes, one with the genome of AAAA and the other TTTT. In other word,

344

no change in ploidy level was involved in the last step in obtaining the allotetraploid genotypes.

345

However, similar to the allopolyploids of A. suecica, the gene ratio between the artificial

346

tetraploids of Arabidopsis do not differ significantly from those of natural genotypes (table 3

347

and fig. 1). These results indicate that polyploidization was not be a prerequire for the
14

348

differences between the two subgenomes. This likelihood is supported by that significant

349

difference in gene ratio was not detected between the di-haploids and their allopolyploid

350

derivatives.

351

Possible relationships between a subgenome and its donors are apparently not limited to

352

gene diversity and gene ratios. For example, results from previous studies also showed that the

353

significant difference in genome size between the subgenomes of polyploid wheats is also

354

present between its progenitor species (IWGSC 2014; Šafář et al. 2010). Similarly, the huge

355

difference in genome size between the two subgenomes (Zhang et al. 2015) also exists between

356

the two progenitor species in cotton (Hendrix and Stewart 2005; Li et al. 2014b). These

357

relationships provide further evidence suggesting that the differences between the subgenomes

358

of the polyploid wheat are likely significantly influenced by its donors. As the exact parents

359

for natural polyploids are unknown and VGC account for large proportions of various genomes

360

(Jin et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2016; Montenegro et al. 2017; Ma et al. 2019), random genotypes

361

from the donor species cannot be used to accurately estimate the relationship between a

362

subgenome and its donor. Considering VGC or differences among individual genotypes in a

363

species is critical in studying SA in polyploid evolution.

Although there is a time difference between their formations, consistent difference in gene ratio

537

between the subgenomes do not exist between artificial and natural genotypes for any of the

538

polyploid species. ‘?’ indicates that the time is unknown for the species in concern, and MYs

539

stands for million years.

*The triploid F1 hybrid (with a triploid genome of ABD) was obtained by crossing an
allotetraploid genotype (producing AB gametes) with a diploid genotype (producing D
gametes). The artificial hexaploid (genome AABBDD) was derived from doubling the
chromosomes of the triploid F1 hybrid.
