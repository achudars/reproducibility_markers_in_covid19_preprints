FinDonor study cohort

Abstract
Background and Objectives
There is increasing evidence that frequent blood donation depletes the iron stores of some
blood donors. The FinDonor 10 000 study was set up to study iron status and factors affecting
iron stores in Finnish blood donors. In Finland, iron supplementation for at-risk groups has
been in place since the 1980’s.
Material and Methods
2584 blood donors (N= 8003 samples) were recruited into the study alongside standard
donation at three donation sites in the capital region of Finland between 5/2015 and 12/2017.
All participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire about their health and lifestyle. Blood
samples were collected from the sample pouch of whole blood collection set, kept in cool
temperature and processed centrally. Whole blood count, CRP, ferritin and sTFR were
measured from the samples and DNA was isolated for GWAS studies.
Results
Participant demographics, albeit in general similar to the general blood donor population in
Finland, indicated some bias toward older and more frequent donors. Participation in the study
increased median donation frequency of the donors. Analysis of the effect of time lag from the
sampling to the analysis and the time of day when sample was drawn revealed small but
significant time-dependent changes.
Conclusion
The FinDonor cohort now provides us with tools to identify potential donor groups at increased
risk of iron deficiency and factors explaining this risk. The increase in donation frequency
during the study suggests that scientific projects can be used to increase the commitment of
blood donors.

FinDonor study cohort

Introduction
Approximately 200 - 250 mg of iron is drawn in a standard blood donation; this amount
accounts for 25% of average tissue iron stores in men and up to 75% in women. There is
compelling evidence that a portion of blood donors may become iron depleted or deficient.
Deferral rates of presenting donors, due to too low level of hemoglobin, vary a lot depending
on populations and policies from below 10 % to up to 20 %. In addition, for example, in the
U.S. 35% of frequent blood donors were found to be iron deficient [1–6]. Adverse health
effects with various symptoms such as fatigue, pica, restless legs syndrome, and cognitive
problems have been linked to iron deficiency and anemia [7], although the effect of iron
deficiency without anemia in otherwise healthy individuals is still unclear [8]. The iron removed
by blood donation should be replaced by dietary iron. Another tool to ensure correction of iron
stores is the minimum time interval between blood donations, which must be balanced
between donor health issues and blood demand. There is evidence [2,4,9] that the current
intervals may not be sufficient for iron or Hb recovery at least for some donors. Identification
of donors who are at highest risk for developing iron depletion or anemia as a result of
frequent blood donation is warranted as it could give us fact-based tools to steer donor
recruitment.
Implementation of iron supplementation to an entire blood donor population to manage iron
deficiency is rare, although several countries provide some iron supplementation [10]. The
Finnish Red Cross Blood Service (FRCBS) has implemented a national risk-group based iron
supplementation policy since the 1980’s. Iron tablets are provided at donation time to all
female donors under the age of 50 and to all other donors donating every 4th month or more
frequently.
To complement the above mentioned studies on iron depletion and cohorts collected elsewhere
[11–14], we set up a cohort study focusing primarily on the measurement of iron stores,
factors affecting them, and, in addition, on the effect of systematic iron supplementation. The
study had 3 specific goals:
1) To assess the feasibility of carrying out research embedded in the regular blood
donation process of FRCBS.
2) To assess the current status of iron biomarkers in the Finnish blood donor population
and their relationship to self-reported health and genetic background.
3) To provide preliminary data on the evolution of iron biomarkers for estimating sample
sizes of future studies.

FinDonor study cohort
In consecutive publications, we will analyze distributions of iron biomarkers and estimate their
determinants with multivariate regression (goal 2) [15]. We will subsequently carry out
genome wide association analysis for iron biomarkers. We will use results from these studies to
carry out simulations for estimating sample-sizes for future studies (goal 3).
Based on our sociological study, Finnish blood donors are willing to donate also for research
use [16]. In general, blood donors have been regarded as an important resource for
biomedical studies [17]. We here describe the FinDonor 10 000 cohort, its collection process,
possible sources of bias and give evidence that there are factors in the measurements that
may affect the results if not carefully taken into account.

Materials and methods
The Finnish Red Cross Blood Service (FRCBS) is a national blood establishment responsible for
the collection, processing and distribution of blood products in Finland. An Ethical review and
approval for the study was obtained from the Ethical Board of Helsinki University Hospital,
Helsinki, Finland. Informed consent was obtained from participants and they were allowed to
withdraw from the study at any time.
Sample collection
The FinDonor 10 000 study ran from May 18th 2015 to December 8th 2017. All donors in the
participating three fixed donation sites located in the Helsinki metropolitan area (Kivihaka,
Sanomatalo, Espoo) were informed of the possibility to join the study with leaflets, posters and
Facebook–postings. All prospective whole blood donors were invited to join the study. A
permanent deferral was the only criteria for exclusion from the study. The age limit for blood
donation and thus for study participation was 18-70 years (18-59 years for first time donors).
Blood samples were taken regardless of the success of the donation. Donation-site nurses
actively recruited blood donors to the study only when there was sufficient time for it without
impeding the normal donation process. Donors were only recruited in the Helsinki metropolitan
area to ensure rapid shipping of samples to the analysis laboratory.
All donations and donor registrations were recorded in a single database (e-Progesa, MAKSYSTEM). Each participant was asked to fill out a health and lifestyle questionnaire using an
internet portal provided at the donation site. The questions are provided in Supplementary
Table 1 and are similar to those used e.g. in the Danish blood donor studies [18]. Each
participant was asked to fill out the same questionnaire again through the internet portal by an
invitation letter sent in June 2018. The internet portal was closed in November 2018. The

FinDonor study cohort
follow-up questionnaire included 3 additional questions pertaining to quality of life,
employment and education. These questions were not asked in the enrollment questionnaire
as they were considered too sensitive to be asked at the time of a voluntary and nonremunerated blood donation.
Samples of peripheral blood were collected from the diversion pouch (CompoFlow® Quadruple
T&B, Fresenius Kabi, Germany) for successful donations and a separate venous sample was
drawn for deferred donations. For blood counts and genomic DNA extraction, samples were
collected in 3 ml K2-EDTA tubes (Terumo Europe NV, Belgium) and for CRP, ferritin and sTfR
measurements in 3 ml Lithium heparin tubes (Terumo Europe NV, Belgium). A cell pellet was
stored for genomic DNA preparation. Samples were sent with the signed informed consent to
FRCBS headquarters, located in Kivihaka, Helsinki, Finland, where donor identity and coding on
the tubes were double-checked and added to the research database. Plasma samples were
sent for laboratory measurements (whole blood count, CRP, ferritin and sTfR; see
Supplementary Table 2 for further details) in batches twice a day to the clinical laboratory of
the University of Helsinki Central Hospital. Blood counts were measured with Sysmex XE
(Sysmex, Japan). The measurements are accredited by the local authority FINAS and the
laboratory participates in national and international quality assurance rounds. The tubes were
kept in cool storage between transportation and handling and time points from blood draw to
analysis were recorded.
Genotyping
The first 760 enrolled individuals were genotyped using an Illumina HumanCoreExome-24v11_A beadchip (Illumina, USA) to estimate ethnic diversity and relatedness. Genotyping of the
rest of the participants is under way. See supplementary methods for further detail. The
datasets analyzed during the current study are not publicly available due to limitations of the
ethical permits which do not allow distribution of personal data, including individual genetic
and clinical results.
Blood count data analysis
The effects of donation time and sampling-to-analysis delay were analyzed using generalized
linear multiple regression. Blood count measurement data were used as response variables
and donation time, sampling-to-analysis delay, sex and age group (ten year bins) were used
as explanatory variables. CRP and ferritin were log2-transformed. Graphical examination of the
data suggested interactions between the explanatory factors donation time and sampling-toanalysis delay. Hence, first a model that includes an interaction term for them was tested and
if the interaction was not found significant a model without an interaction term was fitted to
calculate coefficients of the explanatory variables. The significance of p-values was estimated

with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. The effect of repeated measures was tested by
fitting mixed effect models using lme4 R-library [19]. Mixed effect models were identical to the
no-interaction models with an additional explanatory variable of individuals as a random effect.
Qualitatively similar effect sizes were obtained from the mixed effect models and the nointeraction models. The data were analyzed using R version 3.4.3 [20] and plotted with the
ggplot2 R-library [21].
Results
In total 2584 individual donors (1015 men, 1569 women) gave consent to participate in the
study and donated at least one sample. This represent 6% of all donors who visited the study
sites during the study. In total, participants donated 8003 samples. None of the participants
has withdrawn his or her consent so far (07/2019). 159 participants were new donors (Table
1).
Summary statistics of the age, haemoglobin (Hb) levels, donation interval, count of donations
and blood types in the study population were compared to those of the entire national donor
population (Group “All” in Table 1 and Supplementary Figures 1 and Figure 2) and to those of
the donor population of the recruitment sites (Group “Study Sites” in Table 1 and
Supplementary Figures 1 and 2). These three groups were found to differ. The median age of
study participants in both sexes was higher than both the national and recruitment site
populations, but closer to the national population. The age distribution was bimodal and again
the study population resembled more the national donor population than the donor population
of the study sites (Supplementary Figure 1A).
The median donation interval during the study for both sexes was lower than in the
national and recruitment site populations. Accordingly, donation counts were higher
(Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 2). Mean Hb (g/l) was lower in men in the study population
than in the national and recruitment site populations (Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 1B).
However, in women, mean Hb (g/l) in the study population was higher than in the recruitment
site population, which reflects the higher age of the study population. Consequently, the study
population consisted of a markedly higher proportion of older donors with frequent donation
activity and fewer new donors. The distribution of blood types between different populations
resembled each other closely except that the study population has been more comprehensively
blood typed due to their frequent donor status (Table 1).
The during-study donation attempt frequency was found to be higher than the
before-study donation attempt frequency for study participants (median of during-

study – before-study frequency = 0.6, p < 2e-44 for men; 0.6, p< 9e-80 for men, Wilcoxon
signed rank test, Figure 1). For each donor, the before-study donation frequency was
calculated as the annual average count of donations for the two years before study enrollment.
The during-study frequency was calculated as the annual average count of donations from the
time of enrollment to the study end. Donors who enrolled after 2016.12.08 (less than one year
before the end of the study) and new donors were excluded. 2271 (906 men and 1365
women) donors were therefore included in the analysis.
Of the 2584 study participants, 2562 (99%; 1004 men, 1558 women) answered the
enrollment questionnaire and 1477 (57%; 597 men, 880 women) the follow-up questionnaire.
We used self-reported health as the main indicator of blood donor health. Donors answered the
question “How would you rate your recent health in general” on a five-point scale (Figure 2).
At the population-level, the distributions of answers given in the enrollment questionnaire
(filled at time of donation) and in the follow-up questionnaire (answered outside donation
visits) are similar. At the individual level, there did not seem to be any systematic increase or
decrease of participants’ health ratings during the study period.
We asked donors about their level of education and their employment situation to assess any
potential effects of these factors on self-reported health (Figure 3). Most of the donors who
replied to both questionnaires had at least a vocational college education (men: 59 %, women:
57 %). Furthermore, a majority of these donors were either employed full-time (men: 70 %,
women: 67 %) or pensioners (men: 17 %, women: 14 %).
At least two blood samples could be collected from 1976 donors (N= 840 men, N= 1136
women, see Supplementary Table 3 for further details).
DNA samples from 760 participants were subjected to a genome-wide SNP array screen. To
demonstrate the genetic homogeneity of the study population, we performed principal
component analysis (Supplementary Figure 3) that demonstrated that all 760 participants
could be classified as Northern Europeans.
For each blood-count test, the sampling time (Figure 4) as well as the time when the analysis
result was ready were entered to the laboratory information system. The difference between
these two time points was used as the sampling-to-analysis delay time (Figure 5). To assess
whether the trends shown in Figures 4 and 5 were significant, a multiple regression model was
fitted for each individual blood count measurement including both donation time, sampling-toanalysis delay, an interaction term between these two variables, and sex and age as
explanatory factors (Table 2). The interaction term was used to evaluate if the two time
variables could be separated from each other in this cohort. If the interaction term was not

FinDonor study cohort
found to be significant then the coefficient and p-value of the time variables were calculated
from a model without the interaction term. While the coefficient from a model without the
interaction term is the unit change in an hour, e.g. Hb drops on average 0.2 g/l per hour when
going from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., there is no such intuitive interpretation for coefficients from a
model with an interaction term. An effect in same direction and very similar size range has
been shown previously from finger prick Hb measurements [22].
For hematocrit and platelet count there was a separable significant sampling-toanalysis delay time (h) effect and for erythrocyte count, Hb, hematocrit, MCH and
leukocyte count there was a separable significant donation time (h) effect. For
ferritin, MCV, MCHC, RDW and sTfR there were significant interactions of donation time (h) and
sampling-to-analysis delay time (h) and hence their individual effects could not be separated.
A single elevated CRP measurement, i.e. a value above 10 that may point to inflammation,
was found in 1.8 % of women and 0.3 % of men. Respectively, 14.3 % and 7.6 % had a single
measurement between 3 and 10, i.e. a low grade inflammation. To investigate if these
measurements could point to chronic inflammation we investigated the data graphically
(Supplementary Figure 4). No donor was found to have two CRP measurements above 10,
hence, they most likely had no chronic inflammation.
Discussion
The present cohort was collected primarily for studies investigating the effects of regular blood
donation on donors’ health, in particular regarding iron stores and factors regulating them in a
population with a long-standing systematic iron replacement policy. The cohort complements
those collected elsewhere [12–14,18]. We put special emphasis on careful collection and
follow-up of plasma and serum samples to understand possible confounding factors in
measurements of iron markers. Modelling blood count and related data is not simple as HCT,
MCHC, MCV, RDW and CRP show properties of counts instead of true continuous
measurements, hence, defying the assumptions of standard linear regression. To mitigate this,
we experimented with various transformations, link functions and error distributions in the
modelling process to no avail. The results (Figures 4 and 5, Table 2) clearly demonstrate that
it is essential to know the detailed conditions of collected samples if accurate results are to be
assumed. Recent literature suggests that the stability of blood count parameters in cool
storage is process- and device-specific, hence it should be addressed in every cohort
specifically [23,24]. There are interesting studies demonstrating large effects related to the
time of drawing the samples [25] and this variation also is relevant in everyday blood donation
practice [22]. However, for many screening purposes the variation in measurements found in
the present study is apparently not critical.

FinDonor study cohort

Another factor that is essential to know in cohort studies is how well the study population
represents the overall target population, here blood donors. Based on the demographics, Hb
distribution and donation activity, participants (Supplementary Figures 1 and 2, and Table 1)
of the FinDonor 10 000 cohort can be regarded in general to represent Finnish donor pool
despite some bias toward frequent and committed donors. As a key question to be clarified
with the cohort is related to effects of frequent donation, this bias may not have serious
drawbacks for our future studies.
In Finland all blood donations are voluntary and non-remunerated. Such a blood donation
system could be sensitive to any additional burden to donors (e.g., participating to research).
However, as suggested by two previous studies [13,26], it was found that the donation
frequency of study participants did not decrease during the study in comparison to their
previous donation activity (Figure 1). It is of note that no additional efforts to remind
participants to donate were made. Hence, carrying out blood donation research of this scale
embedded in the regular blood donation process of FRCBS is clearly feasible.
Self-reported health is one of the most widely used instruments to assess general health in
public health studies and associates strongly and constantly with mortality [27]. When a
person arrives to donate she considers herself healthy. Hence, answers to questions regarding
her health status at donation time could be biased towards feeling healthier than she generally
feels. To check for the presence of this possibly important source of bias, we asked donors to
answer the study questionnaire again at the end of the study, outside any blood donation visit.
Based on the comparison of the enrollment and follow-up questionnaires, it seems that this
bias, if present at all, is negligible in our cohort.
The socio-economic make-up of blood donor populations vary amongst countries and cultural
contexts [28]. As socio-economic background is also an important determinant of health, it
was important to assess the educational background and employment situation of our specific
donor population. In the FinDonor cohort’s follow-up questionnaire, university graduates (38%
of men and 28% of women) and full-time employees (70% of men and 67% of women) are
overrepresented in comparison to the general Finnish population. In the general Finnish
population of at least 15 years of age in 2017, only 10 % had at least a graduate level degree
and only 38 % were employed full-time [https://findikaattori.fi/]. Our data may however be
affected by a self-selection bias. Answering the follow-up questionnaire required the donor to
access the internet portal from their own device, therefore more educated donors and/or techsavvy donors might have been more likely to answer it.

FinDonor study cohort
The prevalence of CRP between 3 and 10 was very similar to what has been reported in the
Danish blood donor population (14.4% women and 6.1% men [29]). The prevalence of CRP >
10 was found to be below 2%. Approximately 7% of the apparently healthy Finnish adults
have earlier been reported to have CRP levels over 10 [30,31]. As a minor CRP elevation
(between 3 and 10) does not directly point to inflammation but rather to various mild tissue
stress or injury [32], the FinDonor 10 000 cohort appears to have a markedly low level of
chronic inflammation. This is in accordance with the healthy donor effect, [33] i.e. healthier
individuals are selected as donors and are able to maintain the habit from years to decades.
Conclusions
Together with similar cohorts from other populations [12–14,18] the FinDonor cohort provides
us with tools to identify the potential donor groups at risk for iron deficiency and the genetic
and non-genetic factors associated with this increased risk, as well as to study other health
effects of blood donation. These background facts are needed for ensuring safer and more
personalized blood donation in the future.

Figure and Table Legends

Table 1 Characteristics of the study population. Comparison to national (All) and
study recruitment site (Study sites) donor populations during the timespan of the
study. To facilitate comparison to other cohorts, the count of donations has been
normalized from the study period (2.5 years) to 2 years.
Table 2 Significance of explanatory variables for each measurement. For each
variable a model was fitted with age, sex, sampling-to-analysis delay (h) and donation
time (h) as explanatory variables. A model including an interaction term was first
fitted (“p-value from a model with interaction”). If the interaction term was not
significant, coefficient and p-value is provided for a model without interaction. Pvalues that are significant after Bonferroni correction of alpha (original alpha 0.05) are
marked with an asterix (*).
Figure 1: Difference of during study donation attempt frequency and before
study donation attempt frequency. Before study donation frequency for a donor
was calculated as the annual average count of donations from two years before the
study enrollment.
Figure 2: Self-rated health in study enrollment and follow-up questionnaire.
Marginal distributions show the total amount of answers and numbers in cells the
specific combinations of answers to the two questionnaires.
Figure 3 Distributions of education (A) and employment (B) status among
participants who answered the follow-up questionnaire.
Figure 4: Effect of donation time to measurement values. Data is binned to
hexagons and the color of each hexagon shows how many individual measurements
are contained in each hexagon. The black line shows a linear regression trend line.
See Table 2 for full description of measured variables.
