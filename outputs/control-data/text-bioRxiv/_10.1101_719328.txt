ABSTRACT

29

Coccidioides posadasii is a pathogenic fungus that causes coccidioidomycosis in many arid regions of

30

the Americas. One of these regions is bordered by the Caribbean Sea, and the surrounding

31

landscape may play an important role in the dispersion of C. posadasii across South America

32

through southeastern Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala and Venezuela. Comparative phylogenomic

33

analyses of C. posadasii reveal that clinical strains from Venezuela are genetically distinct from the

34

North American populations found in Arizona (AZ), Texas, Mexico, and the rest of South America

35

(TX/MX/SA). We find evidence for admixture between the Venezuela and the North American

36

populations of C. posadasii in Central America. As expected, the proportion of Venezuelan alleles in

37

the admixed population decreases as latitude (and distance from Venezuela) increases. Our results

38

indicate that the population in Venezuela may have been subjected to a recent bottleneck, and

39

shows strong population structure. This analysis provides insight into potential for Coccidioides

40

spp. to invade new regions.

INTRODUCTION

42
In spite of their human health impact, fungal pathogens are currently understudied (1, 2).

43
44

To date approximately 150 species are responsible for disease in humans, with an estimated 1.5

45

million deaths each year (3, 4). The most affected are immunocompromised patients (e.g. HIV), but

46

several of these diseases can also affect otherwise healthy patients (5, 6). Systematic surveys of

47

genetic diversity of fungal pathogens have revealed extensive variability in the strength of virulence

48

among genotypes of isolates from the same species (e.g., (7)). Other traits like antifungal resistance,

49

and ability to survive different environmental conditions also show extensive variation (8-10).

50

Understanding the magnitude and sources of variation among these traits is a crucial aspect of

51

understanding why some pathogens are more effective at spreading and causing disease than

52

others.

53

An important aspect of variation is not only the total magnitude within a species but also

54

how that variation is apportioned across populations (11, 12). Population structure within species

55

and barriers to gene flow can maintain genetic variation within and between species boundaries,

56

respectively. Studying the origin and maintenance of genetic variation is important because it is

57

likely to dictate the pathogen’s ability to cause disease and respond to management strategies (13).

58

The paucity of studies that have focused efforts to understand the magnitude of this variation is

59

particularly acute for fungal pathogens that occur in the tropics and subtropics. The tropics are

60

generally more diverse than temperate areas in terms of numbers of species (14-16), thus the

61

genetic diversity of fungi, and in particular of fungi with the ability to cause disease in humans,

62

might be larger in the tropics as well.

63

Coccidioidomycosis or “Valley Fever” is an example of one of these primary fungal diseases,

64

and is caused by the saprobic species Coccidioides immitis and C. posadasii (17). The disease range

65

overlaps arid regions throughout the American continent, but California and Arizona encompass

66

the vast majority of reported cases of the disease (18). Due to the availability of many clinical

67

isolates, most sampling has occurred in these two US states, even though the geographic range

68

extends into Latin America. Coccidioidomycosis has been reported less frequently in arid and semi-

69

arid environments of Central America (Guatemala and Honduras) and South America (Brazil,

70

Argentina, Paraguay, Colombia and Venezuela) (19, 20). It is unclear if isolates of Coccidioides from

71

the southwestern United States show a pattern of higher infectivity and/or virulence, or if it reflects

72

a lower prevalence of the organism in other endemic regions in the Americas coupled with lower

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/719328; this version posted July 30, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

73

population densities in most arid regions. Alternatively, the pattern could be explained by lower

74

rates of fungal disease awareness, testing, and reporting from tropical regions.

75

The two etiological agents of coccidioidomycosis, C. immitis and C. posadasii, are two sibling

76

species that diverged about 5 million years ago (21). The species are thought to be phenotypically

77

similar but some key differences have been reported. Besides showing a highly differentiated

78

genome, C. posadasii grows more slowly than C. immitis at high concentrations of salt (22).

79

Additionally, spherules of C. posadasii appear to develop asynchronously as compared to C. immitis

80

(23). There are also broad differences in the geographic distribution of the two species. While C.

81

immitis is restricted to North America, C. posadasii has a broader distribution, which ranges from

82

Arizona to Argentina. Consistent with this distribution, coccidioidomycosis in South and Central

83

American is primarily caused by C. posadasii but reports of C. immitis exist from Argentina and

84

Colombia (24-26). Both species of Coccidioides show strong signatures of population structure. In

85

the case of C. immitis, genomic analyses have revealed the existence of two subdivided populations:

86

Washington state (at the northernmost point of the known range of the species distribution) and

87

the rest of the range (27). In the case of C. posadasii at least two distinct populations have been

88

proposed: Arizona (AZ) and Texas/Mexico/South America (TX/MX/SA) (21, 28).

89

Studying population structure of C. posadasii is critical to understanding the spread of the

90

pathogen across the Americas. Based on microsatellite analyses, the introduction of C. posadasii into

91

South America has been dated between 9,000 to 140,000 years ago, and was proposed to follow the

92

Amerindian intercontinental migration (29). However, the most recent common ancestor for C.

93

posadasii populations, inferred by whole genome SNP analysis, revealed that C. posadasii lineages

94

that gave rise to TX/MX/SA and AZ emerged 700kya, and C. posadasii Guatemala about 200kya

95

(21). These two findings are not consistent with a serial bottleneck giving rise to the current South

96

American populations, but are consistent with ancestral population structure previous to the

97

spread of C. posadasii to South America and the migration of a few lineages to the south. However,

98

before any of these hypotheses can be tested, an assessment of the genetic characteristics of South

99

American isolates is sorely needed.

100

One of these most characteristic xeric ecosystems in South America is the Paraguaná xeric

101

shrubland (30), which is characterized by arid and dry climates, low altitude, xerophytic vegetation,

102

and sandy soils with high salt. This environment may favor Coccidioides spp. growth and

103

development (31). Notably, skin test surveys using coccidioidin in Latin American communities

104

revealed positive testing in 44% and 46% in the Chaco region of Paraguay and the Lara state of

105

Venezuela, respectively (26, 32). Additionally, environmental molecular detection of Coccidioides

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/719328; this version posted July 30, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

106

spp. in Venezuela suggests a high prevalence of C. posadasii in the soil (33). The actual occurrence of

107

coccidioidomycosis remains unclear; as fewer than 1,000 total coccidioidomycosis cases have been

108

reported over the last century in South and Central America (19, 26). However, environmental

109

sampling and serological inquires suggest that the importance and prevalence of

110

coccidioidomycosis in South America may be vastly underappreciated, and little is known about the

111

genetic characteristics and genealogical relationships of this population.

112

In this report, we aim to bridge this gap. We sequenced 10 C. posadasii isolates from

113

Venezuela and studied their relationship to other isolates. These isolates form a monophyletic

114

group with little diversity, which is differentiated from other C. posadasii populations. Notably, we

115

find that Central American populations of C. posadasii are the result of admixture between North

116

America and Venezuela. These results reveal the importance of characterizing tropical populations

117

of Coccidioides as they harbor distinct genetic variants, and likely phenotypic differences, among

118

populations. These populations can act as donors of variation, and contribute to the evolution of

119

other populations in subtropical and temperate regions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

122
123

Fungal strains, DNA extraction and DNA sequencing

124
125
126

Coccidioides isolates
Coccidioides isolates were retrieved from human clinical specimens collected at the at the

127

Servicio Autónomo Instituto de Biomedicina Dr. Jacinto Convit, Caracas, Venezuela; the Valley Fever

128

Center for Excellence, Tucson, Arizona; or at the UC Davis Center for Valley Fever, UC Davis Health,

129

Davis, California. Clinical specimens were initially seeded onto Mycosel agar (BD Biosciences), or

130

Sabouraud agar with 100 ug/mL chloramphenicol and cycloheximide, and fungal isolates were

131

subjected to serial passage onto 2X-GYE media (1% w/v Difco yeast extract and 2% w/v glucose)

132

for fungal colony stabilization and to detect any potential contamination. Coccidioides

133

arthroconidia were harvested and preserved in 25% glycerol, 0.5% glucose, and 0.25% yeast

134

extract storage media, and finally stored at -80ºC.

135
136
137

DNA extraction
To culture isolates and extract DNA, we grew Coccidioides (isolates listed in Supplementary

138

Table 1) in BSL-3 conditions either at the Pathogen and Microbiome Institute, University of

139

Northern Arizona, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA or at the Servicio Autónomo Instituto de Biomedicina Dr.

140

Jacinto Convit, Caracas, Venezuela. We seeded all fungal cultures from glycerol stocks, previously

141

kept at -80C, onto 2X-GYE media for mycelia propagation at 28°C for 14 days. We harvested

142

~500mg of mycelia using a cell scraper (VWR, Radnor, PA) and this material was used as input for

143

total DNA extraction using the UltraClean Microbial DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen) according to the

144

manufacturer's protocol. We then confirmed the sterility of all DNA before removing the DNA

145

preparations from the BSL3 facility for further sequencing by plating 5% of the eluted material onto

146

2X-GYE media and growth was evaluated after 72 hours at 28°C. Once removed from the BSL3, we

147

estimated DNA purity and concentration using spectrophotometry on the NanoDrop® ND-1000

148

system (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

149
150
151

Library preparation and sequencing
We prepared sequencing libraries for the ten de novo sequenced isolates using the Kapa

152

Biosystems kit (Kapa Biosystems, Woburn, MA) and ~1μg of DNA of each isolate according to

153

manufacturer’s protocols. We then multiplexed individual libraries using 8-bp indexes and

154

quantified using quantitative PCR (qPCR) in a 7900HT system (Life Technologies Corporation,

155

Carlsbad, CA) using the Kapa library quantification kit (Kapa Biosystems, Woburn, MA). We pooled

156

libraries that were quantified using qPCR as above, and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500

157

instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA) at the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen)

158

aiming for a coverage of 100X per isolate. Resulting paired end reads had a length of 125bp.

159
160
161

Public data
We obtained 72 publicly available sequence reads for C. posadasii (51) and C. immitis (21)

162

isolates from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). All accession numbers are listed Supplementary

163

Table 1.

165
166

Read mapping and variant calling
First, we removed Illumina adaptors using Trimmomatic v 0.36 from the reads obtained for

167

the 10 sequenced isolates (34). To improve de novo references, we used the Unmanned Genome

168

Assembly Pipeline (UGAP - https://github.com/jasonsahl/UGAP) that uses the genome assembly

169

algorithm SPAdes v 3.10.1 (35) as well the Pilon toolkit v 1.22 (36). We obtained publicly available

170

Coccidioides raw reads from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) deposited at the accession number

171

SRR3468064 (C. posadasii Nuevo Leon-1) and SRR1292225 (C. immitis strain 202). We used

172

Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) v 0.7.7 (37) to align reads to each of the assembled references: C.

173

posadasii strain Nuevo Leon-1 (27) or C. immitis strain 202 (38). We removed mismatching

174

intervals with the RealignerTargetCreator and IndelRealigner tools available in the GATK toolkit v

175

3.3-0 (39, 40). To call SNPs, we used UnifiedGenotyper setting the parameter “het” to 0.01. Finally,

176

we filtered the .vcf files using the following parameters: QD = 2.0 || FS_filter = 60.0 || MQ_filter =

177

30.0 || MQ_Rank_Sum_filter = -12.5 || Read_Pos_Rank_Sum_filter = -8. SNP’s with less than 10X

178

coverage or with less than 90% variant allele calls or that were identified by NUCmer (41) as being

179

within duplicated regions in the reference were removed from the final dataset. In total, our dataset

180

was composed of 78 Coccidioides genomes.

181
182
183

Phylogenetic tree
To study the genealogical relationships among C. posadasii isolates, we built a Maximum

184

Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree using genome-wide SNP data. We used concatenated genome-

185

wide SNPs as Coccidioides as we expect low levels of genealogical discordance (42, 43). We first

186

obtained whole supercontig sequences for each individual from the VCF file using the

187

FastaAlternateReferenceMaker tool in GATK. Next, we used IQ-TREE to infer the most likely tree

188

with maximum likelihood (44); we used the -m TEST option (jModelTest (45)) for automatic

189

molecular evolution model selection. We calculated the support of each branch on the resulting

190

topology, using 1,000 ultrafast bootstraps coupled with a Shimodaira–Hasegawa-like approximate

191

likelihood ratio test (SH-aLRT) (46, 47). Tree topologies were visualized using FigTree v1.4.2 -

192

http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/.

193
194
195

Mating type
We determined whether the genomes from the C. posadasii population from Venezuela have

196

evidence of functional mating type loci based on sequence similarity to known mating type

197

sequence. The Onygenalean mating-type locus contains one of two forms of unrelated sequences

198

(known as the idiomorph) in a syntenic but unique segment that gives sexual identify to fungal

199

cells. To identify the mating type of the Venezuelan C. posadasii isolates we followed the same

200

strategy previously used to identify the MAT1-1 or the MAT1-2 loci in this pathogen (27, 48). Briefly,

201

we used the full MAT1-1 (containing the alpha-box MAT1-1-1 gene - EF472259.1) and MAT1-2

202

(containing the HMG-box MAT1-2-1 gene EF472258.1) loci as reference sequences to query the

203

Venezuelan C. posadasii read files. All isolates examined to date carry only one of these loci, and are

204

classified as either a MAT1-1 or MAT1-2 genotype.

206
207

Approximate time of divergence
We used Beast v2.5.2 (49) to infer molecular dating estimates. The analysis was performed

208

in two steps. In the first step, we run the program twice including all the taxa, but assuming two

209

different time priors following a normal distribution truncated at zero (with means at 5.1 Mya and

210

at 12.8 Mya respectively, each with a standard deviation = 10%). We assumed a birth-death tree

211

prior. In the second step, we assumed a coalescent model (skyline; (50)) including the Caribbean

212

population only (i.e., excluding the reference C. immitis) with root prior age extrapolated from the

213

age ranges rather than 95% highest posterior densities (HPD) for this same node in runs of the first

214

step, under a uniform distribution. We assumed the prior root age to be within the range given by

215

the minima and maxima of the ranges considering the two different runs of the first step, i.e.,

216

[min(minima); max(maxima)]. After the second step was completed, we generated a skyline plot.

217

For each scenario, we ran two MCMC runs until convergence was detected and effective sample

218

sizes were > 200, as revealed in Tracer v1.7 (51). We then summarized the two runs for each case

219

using treeannotator (within the Beast v2.5.2 distribution) after discarding the burnin regions,

220

summarizing ranges and 95% HPD of divergence times.

221
222
223

Population structure
We studied the population structure of C. posadasii using two different methods. First, we

224

used Principal Components Analysis (PCA) which provides a graphical representation of the

225

partition of genetic variance in a population sample. To do so, we restricted our dataset to biallelic

226

sites and used the R package ‘adegenet’ (52). We used the function fasta2genlight to extract biallelic

227

SNPs from VCF files (see above) and the function glPca to compute the first two principal

228

components (PCs). We also report the percentage of genetic variance explained by each PC. Next,

229

we inferred the most likely population clustering within C. posadasii using fastSTRUCTURE v1.0

230

(53). This tool calculates the most likely number of populations (K) and the probability that each

231

strain belongs to each population. SNPs were assumed to be unlinked under the admixture model,

232

and the ancestry of each individual and correlated allele frequencies were simulated for a range 2

233

to 8 populations. To infer the most likely true number of populations, we found the K with the

234

lowest likelihood using the script chooseK.py (53), which parses the log files of each inferred value

235

of K and infers the best fitting model by maximizing the marginal likelihood.

236
237

Genetic distances

238

One of the proxies of cryptic speciation is that isolated species show considerably larger

239

genetic differentiation than the magnitude of intrapopulation variation (43). We studied whether C.

240

posadasii showed the signature of cryptic speciation. We measured the genetic differentiation

241

between the nine groups defined by the above phylogenetic analysis. To calculate the between

242

group distance, we used Dxy, the mean number of genetic differences between two genomes from

243

different clusters. We compared the mean differentiation between two groups to the magnitude of

244

genetic diversity within groups. To calculate the within group diversity, we used , the mean

245

number of genetic differences between two genomes from the same cluster. Genome-wide SNP data

246

was loaded into MEGA7 (54) and the genetic groups were determined according to the groups

247

revealed in the phylogenetic tree as follows: C. immitis, C. posadasii Venezuela, C. posadasii

248

Guatemala, C. posadasii TX/MX/SA, C. posadasii AZ1, C. posadasii Phoenix, C. posadasii Tucson and C.

249

posadasii Tucson24/3490/GT120/Sonora. For pairwise comparisons we use asymptotic 2-sample

250

permutation tests using the function perm.test (R library ‘exactRankTests’). Since there were two

251

values of  for each value of Dxy, we compared Dxy values to the highest value of  in a pair of

252

populations. We adjusted the significance threshold to account for multiple comparisons to P =

253

0.00138 (0.05/36).

254
255

Admixture

256

Previous studies have found that species of Coccidioides exchange alleles (55, 56). Our scope

257

was different; we assessed whether populations within C. posadasii exchange genes. We estimated

258

the proportion of admixture for each isolate using ADMIXTURE (57). We inferred the number of

259

populations within C. posadasii by testing which K scenario had the lowest marginal likelihood, in a

260

similar manner to that described for fastSTRUCTURE (see above). In the case of the Caribbean

261

population, we regressed the proportion of admixture to the distance from the putative donor

262

population, Venezuela.

263

Next, we used f4 statistics to assess the proportion of admixture. We restricted this analysis

264

to the Guatemala population. We used admixtools (Patterson et al. 2012) implemented in Treemix

265

(58) and the option -k 1000 was used to group 1,000 SNPs to account for linkage disequilibrium.

266

Assuming a given phylogeny, the f4 ratio allows estimating the two mixing proportions during an

267

admixture event even without access to the precise populations that gave rise to the admixed

268

lineage for the two ancestral populations. Since we have inferred the phylogenetic relationships

269

among Coccidioides populations, we calculated the proportion Venezuela ancestry in Guatemala

270

following the equation:

271
Proportion of admixture = f4(AOXC)/f4(AOBC)

272
273
274

where X corresponds to the potentially admixed population (i.e., Guatemala). O, B A, and C are four

275

populations that are known to branch at four distinct positions along the phylogeny. Outgroup

276

refers to the outgroup; in this case, we used C. immitis. A and C are the donors (or close relative to

277

the donors) of the admixed lineage. In this case, we used A = Phoenix, and C = Venezuela. B is a

278

population that does not harbor introgression; we used B=Tucson. We found no difference in the

279

estimations by swapping Tucson and Phoenix (data not shown).

280

Finally, we tested whether the contribution of Venezuela to the admixed population

281

between Venezuela and Arizona followed the expectation that as distance from Venezuela

282

increased, the contribution of the Venezuela population would decrease. Our hypothesis was that

283

individuals from Central America were admixed and the product of gene exchange between the

284

North American and South American C. posadasii populations. We used the proportion of admixture

285

inferred from ADMIXTURE when K=3 in C. posadasii (the best fitting scenario, see results). Next, we

286

calculated the distance between the collection site of a given sample (defined to the level of country

287

or state) and Caracas using a haversine formula (59). Next, we calculated the distance between

288

Caracas and the closest major city to where the isolate was collected using the great-circle distance

289

between two points (i.e., the shortest distance over the Earth’s surface). We used the approximate

290

coordinates of seven locations to calculate the waypoints distance from Caracas (10.4806° N,

291

66.9036° W). We used the following sites and coordinates: Guatemala (15.7835° N, 90.2308° W),

292

Coahuila (27.0587° N, 101.7068° W), Arizona (34.0489° N, 111.0937° W), Florida (27.6648° N,

293

81.5158° W), Texas (31.9686° N, 99.9018° W), Michoacan (19.5665° N, 101.7068° W), and Sonora

294

(29.2972° N, 110.3309° W). We used a one-tailed Spearman correlation test using the R package

295

‘stats’ (function ‘cor.test’).

Data availability and SNPs
All the raw reads for the 10 isolates we sequenced in this manuscript were deposited at SRA

301

under BioProject number PRJNA438145 with sample accessions numbers SRR6830879-

302

SRR683088 (Table S1). Reads from the 51 C. posadasii previously sequenced genomes were aligned

303

to the reference C. posadasii strain Nuevo Leon-1. This alignment had 261,105 SNPs. When we

304

included C. immitis 202 strain as the outgroup, the alignment had 464,281 SNPs. The difference

305

between in the number of polymorphic sites between these two alignments reflects the genetic

306

differentiation between C. immitis and C. posadasii.

307
308
309

Phylogenetic tree and mating type analysis
First, we found that the model GTR+F+ASC+R9 was the best fit for the C. posadasii strain

310

Nuevo Leon-1 alignment while TVM+ASC+G4 model was the best fit for the alignment for the C.

311

posadasii and C. immitis 202 alignment. We then used these alignments and modes of molecular

312

evolution to generate a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree. We rooted the tree with C. immitis,

313

the closest relative of C. posadasii.

314

The resulting maximum likelihood tree revealed that C. posadasii encompasses two major

315

groups, one formed exclusively by Arizona isolates and one more heterogeneous that includes all

316

the isolates from South America, central America, Texas, and a few isolates from AZ (Figure 1). The

317

branches shown in Figure 1 have bootstrap and SH-aLRT support of over 90%. As expected the

318

longest branch in the tree (i.e., genetic distance) is the branch that separates C. posadasii and C.

319

immitis, the two species of Coccidioides. Consistent with previous studies (27, 56, 60), we estimate

320

that the differentiation between these two species occurred 4.8 MYA (95% HPD - 3.8-5.8 MYA)

321

years ago.

322

The Arizona (AZ) clade contains two main groups, one composed of isolates from

323

Tucson/Pima County, and one mostly (but not exclusively) composed by isolates from

324

Phoenix/Maricopa County (Figure 1). These localities are both in the state of Arizona, USA. This

325

level of micro geographic structure is puzzling because of the geographical proximity between the

326

two sites (160 km), and because the majority of these isolates were collected from human patients.

327

One would expect people to move freely between these two localities. This pattern might suggest

328

that even though people can move between these two cities, there is a high level of predictability of

329

where infections were contracted (i.e. the patient’s main residence).

330

The second clade encompasses a more diverse geographical sample that includes isolates

331

from North, Central and South America (Figure 1). This group is composed of four subgroups. The

332

first one is a clade formed by isolates mostly collected in localities surrounding the Caribbean Sea,

333

including isolates from Guatemala and Florida. This is one of the longest branches within C.

334

posadasii. Venezuela forms a monophyletic group which is sister to this Caribbean region clade. In

335

effect, the Caribbean group is paraphyletic when Venezuela is not included in the topology (data not

336

shown). The second group of the non-Arizonan isolates of C. posadasii, encompassing isolates from

337

South America, appear nested within isolates from Texas and Mexico (henceforth referred to as

338

TX/MX/SA – Figure 1). The existence of this group, which harbors South America and North

339

American isolates, is consistent with (but does not uniquely support) the hypothesis that a

340

genetically diverse group from North America underwent a population bottleneck while expanding

341

south, and gave rise to genetically depauperate populations in South America (61). A third group is

342

formed by 4 isolates from Arizona (AZ-Clade1 in Figure 1). Even though these clinical isolates were

343

collected in the same localities as the isolates from the AZ population, they are not associated with

344

this population. This suggests that these infections might have been acquired in a location different

345

from southern Arizona (Tucson or Phoenix), or that additional phylogenetic clades remain to be

346

defined with additional sampling. Finally, we find a small phylogenetic group composed of one

347

isolate from Texas and one from Colorado (Figure 1). A more systematic sampling is needed to fully

348

understand the genealogical and geographic relationships among C. posadasii groups, but the

349

results from this genome-wide phylogenetic tree suggest there is differentiation among C. posadasii

350

populations based primarily on geographic origin.

351
352
353

Population structure
We next explored the partitioning of genetic diversity within C. posadasii using population

354

genetics approaches. First, we assessed how genetic diversity was apportioned among isolates with

355

a principle components analysis (PCA). We performed the analysis in two different ways. First, we

356

included C. immitis and C. posadasii in the sample (Figure 2A). As expected, PC1 (75.34% of the

357

variance) separates the two Coccidioides species. Consistent with previous findings, we see no

358

intermediate isolates suggesting that even though admixture between the two species of

359

Coccidioides has occurred (28, 62), the amount of genetic exchange between species is small enough

360

to not affect species delineations. Notably, PC2 (3.03% of the variance) differentiates between the

361

Arizona + TX/MX/SA and Venezuela populations with the Caribbean (e.g., Guatemala, Florida)

362

group appearing as intermediaries between these two populations. PC2 thus corresponds to the

363

population variation within C. posadasii. Interestingly with this analysis, the Guatemala population

364

does not appear as a separate lineage but instead appears to be an intermediate between the

365

Arizona and Venezuela populations.

366

The PCA that only included C. posadasii showed similar patterns but added more resolution

367

to the differentiation within C. posadasii (Figure 2B). PC1 (14.26% of the variance) separates

368

Venezuela and the remainder of the C. posadasii populations. PC2 (8.52% of the variance) separates

369

the TX/MX/SA population from the rest of the C. posadasii Arizona populations. We find isolates

370

that show genetic variation patterns that are intermediate between populations. The isolates from

371

Guatemala and the isolates GT-120 (Miami, Florida), Tucson 7, and Tucson 2, appear as

372

intermediaries between the AZ and Venezuela clusters (Figure 2B, PC1). This result is consistent

373

with the PCA that included both species of Coccidioides in the previous analysis. Three isolates

374

(Sonora 2, Michoacán 1, B01813-TX) from Mexico and Texas appear as intermediates between

375

Arizona and TX/MX/SA (Figure 2B, PC2). These results are suggestive of population differentiation

376

among populations between different geographical regions of C. posadasii and a degree of genetic

377

exchange between these populations.

378

Second, we used fastSTRUCTURE with the admixture mode to infer the most likely number

379

of groups in C. posadasii. When we include C. immitis, the method infers three clusters: C. immitis, C.

380

posadasii from Arizona+TX/MX/SA, and C. posadasii from Venezuela (Figure 3). This result is

381

qualitatively similar to the result from the PCA using the same dataset. When the analysis is run

382

without C. immitis, we find a similar result. The genomic data reveal the existence of a Venezuela

383

group, an Arizona group, and a third group formed by the TX/MX/SA isolates. The detection of the

384

latter cluster is the main difference from the analysis run with C. immitis. These two results are

385

consistent with the results the two PCAs (Figure 2) and suggest the existence of strong population

386

stratification within C. posadasii. Notably, fastSTRUCTURE infers that the isolates from the

387

Caribbean group, which appear as closely related to Venezuela in the phylogenetic tree, and as

388

intermediates between Arizona and Venezuela in the PCA, are not as clearly assigned to a cluster.

389

These show a high probability of being associated with the Venezuela group (P  0.85), but there is

390

also a non-trivial probability they are associated with the Arizona group (P  0.15). The results are

391

also largely consistent but not identical to previous attempts to determine the partition of genetic

392

variation within C. posadasii (27); namely we find that Caribbean group is not an isolated

393

population but instead is a population that cannot be assigned to either Venezuela or North

394

America. The reasons for this conflict are explored below.

395
396
397

Genetic distances
Next, we studied whether there was evidence of cryptic speciation within C. posadasii. We

398

measured the mean genetic distance between individual genomes in all pairwise comparisons to

399

get a proxy of within population diversity and potential between population differentiation.

400

Consistent with previous reports, C. immitis and C. posadasii are highly differentiated; the

401

magnitude of interspecific differentiation is over 10 times larger than within species variation. The

402

genetic distance value among populations is around 6% in all pairwise comparisons. Within each

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/719328; this version posted July 30, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

403

population, most  values are close to 5% (i.e. Tucson = 5.7%; Phoenix = 5.3%; TX/MX/SA = 4.5%). This

404

value is in line with the levels of intraspecific variation described for other fungal species (63).

405

However, the Caribbean group shows  values that are much lower. Heterozygosity in Guatemala is

406

three times lower than in North American groups (Guatemala = 1.5%). A more extreme example is

407

that of Venezuela, where heterozygosity is ~50 times lower than that of other C. posadasii

408

populations (Venezuela =0.09%). We next compared these values to determine whether

409

interpopulation pairs show a higher genetic distance than intrapopulation pairs. We find that this is

410

the case in most comparisons (Table S2 showing results from asymptotic 2-sample Permutation

411

Tests). These differences are consistent across groups and the magnitude of differentiation among

412

populations is slightly higher than that within populations but does not clearly indicate the

413

existence of cryptic species within the Caribbean group.

414
415
416

Mating type
One possibility that might explain the low heterozygosity in the Venezuela population might

417

be clonality due to the absence of one of the mating types, thus reducing recombination rates. All 7

418

isolates from the Venezuelan phylogenetic group harbor the MAT1-2 idiomorph in their haploid

419

genomes, while all other C. posadasii populations have balanced MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 idiomorphs

420

(27). This prevalence of a single mating type is similar to observations for the clonal C. immitis

421

Washington population (27), which suggests that population bottlenecks associated with range

422

expansion might result in a single mating type and a clonal population structure.

423
424

Admixture

425

PCA and fastSTRUCTURE results suggest that some isolates have mixed genetic ancestry

426

between divergent C. posadasii populations. We studied the geographical partition of shared

427

ancestry in the Caribbean group within C. posadasii. We used ADMIXTURE to infer the contribution

428

from the minor population (i.e., Venezuela) as a proxy the proportion of admixture in each of the

429

Caribbean group isolates. The results from ADMIXTURE show a similar clustering to the one

430

revealed from fastSTRUCTURE and also suggest the presence of three populations within C.

431

posadasii (Figure S1). The contributions of each of the three resulting populations to the admixed

432

individuals of C. posadasii are shown in Figure 4. Next we studied the broad distribution of

433

Venezuela ancestry across geography. Using the inferred proportion of Venezuela ancestry, we

434

tested whether there was a relationship between the proportion of Venezuela contribution and the

435

distance to the center of the geographical distribution of the parental population. Within the

436

Caribbean population, we find that the proportion of Venezuela ancestry decreases slightly but not

437

significantly as the distance from Caracas increases (Spearman= -0.3562, p-value = 0.088; Figure 4).

438

These results suggest that the Caribbean populations are akin to a contact zone between the

439

Arizona and Venezuela populations. More generally, the results collectively show that in spite of the

440

strong differentiation between C. posadasii populations there is evidence of admixture and gene

441

exchange.

442
443

DISCUSSION

444
445

In this study, we assess the magnitude of the differentiation within C. posadasii using whole

446

genome sequence comparisons. The magnitude and partitioning of genetic variation in human

447

fungal pathogens is a key, yet underappreciated, aspect of pathogen biology. Coccidioides represents

448

a clear example of this paucity. Even though coccidioidomycosis exists in Central and South

449

America, very little is known about the biology of the fungus in this region. Preliminary population

450

assessments indicated that isolates from Central America belong to C. posadasii but these are

451

genetically differentiated from both the C. posadasii TX/MX/SA clade and the Arizona clade (22).

452

Notably, little is known in terms of the genetic diversity of isolates from xeric environments from

453

South America, which poses the possibility that this snapshot of the relationships between C.

454

posadasii isolates is incomplete.

455

Epidemiological studies show that coccidioidomycosis in South America is mostly caused by

456

C. posadasii (19, 61, 64). Molecular analyses of soil DNA revealed that Coccidioides is common in

457

xeric environments of Venezuela: all sampled sites (N = 15) were positive for Coccidioides; and

458

sequencing of one of the ribosomal Internal Transcribed Spacers (ITS2) suggested that all the

459

environmental samples from the region are, indeed, C. posadasii (33). Nonetheless, the sample of

460

genotypes was diverse and encompassed multiple ITS2 haplotypes. If C. posadasii is so common in

461

the soil in Venezuela, why is coccidioidomycosis so rare in the same area? One possibility is that the

462

C. posadasii Venezuela lineage is less infective than other Coccidioides lineages. Since C. posadasii in

463

Venezuela seems to have undergone a strong bottleneck (29), it is possible that the fungus has

464

accumulated deleterious mutations that diminish its ability to establish infection in humans.

465

Another possibility is that the Venezuela lineage is less virulent than other lineages. In this scenario,

466

even if the fungus comes into contact with humans, and has the same ability to cause infection as

467

other lineages, the disease is more likely to be asymptomatic than in other lineages. This would be

468

consistent with the fact that large proportion of the people in Venezuela react to coccidioidin. The

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/719328; this version posted July 30, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

aCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.

469

proportion of reactors in Venezuela is comparable to other human populations (65, 66). Variation

470

in the ability to cause disease, either because of genotypic differences in the ability to infect or to

471

induce disease, has been reported for other fungi of the Onygenales. Histoplasma spp., for example,

472

show differences in fungal burden, disease kinetics, symptomology, and cytokine responses in

473

controlled infections (67). Currently there is no definitive evidence of these differences among

474

lineages of Coccidioides. It is also possible that coccidioidomycosis is underreported in Venezuelan

475

(and other Latin American) populations compared to USA populations. Additionally, arid regions in

476

South America tend to be associated with lower population densities and lower socio-economic

477

status than coastal cities. Certainly, all these possibilities are not mutually exclusive. Defining the

478

relative importance of these factors that may contribute to the low numbers of coccidioidomycosis

479

in South America will required a combination of population genetics, genome-wide association

480

studies, and fine-scale and comparable epidemiological studies paired with environmental surveys

481

in multiple Coccidioides populations from different regions of endemicity.

482

One proposed hypothesis to explain C. posadasii genotypic distributions in South America is

483

dispersion associated with human migration from North America (61). Early settlements of humans

484

in Venezuela (Taima-Taima archeological site, Falcon state) were dated to 15k years ago (68). The

485

divergence between the Venezuela and North America lineages of C. posadasii goes back to at least

486

~145,000- 390,000 years ago, within the Middle and Upper Pleistocene (69). The confidence

487

intervals of these dates do not overlap with the more well accepted understanding of human

488

colonization of the Americas (less than 17,000 years ago; (70-72) but see (73)). Nonetheless, there

489

are several caveats and alternative hypotheses that need to be taken into account. One possibility is

490

that the mutation rate, which was used to convert genetic differentiation to years of divergence,

491

differs across multiple groups of Coccidioides. The difference in mutation rates between Coccidioides

492

lineages would have to high (~10X) to qualitatively change our conclusions. Second, it is possible

493

the Venezuela lineage originated somewhere else (i.e., North America) and went extinct in its

494

location of origin. If this lineage was only able to establish itself in Venezuela, then the hypothesis of

495

human-driven migration of C. posadasii to South America would be compatible with our results.

496

Third, other animal migrations and host-pathogen associations have not been explored. The Great

497

American Biotic Interchange resulted in many species that could be preferred or novel host species

498

moving from North America to South America and vice versa. Finally, the vast majority of isolates

499

analyzed to date are derived from human patients and we cannot be fully confident of their site of

500

origin or of overall genetic diversity in the environment. The patterns of dispersion of fungal

501

pathogens, including C. posadasii, remain an underexplored topic.

502

The study of population structure in fungi has been almost exclusively applied to defining

503

cryptic species. These lineages, which show the genetic signature of reproductive isolation (i.e., the

504

phylogenetic species concept, reviewed in (74)), are morphologically similar and were not known

505

to be distinct before DNA sequencing became possible (reviewed in (75)). This approach has led to

506

the conclusion that the number of species of fungi is significantly underestimated as each species

507

recognized by morphology harbors several phylogenetic species (4). Delineating species

508

boundaries has important consequences for epidemiology and our understanding of pathogenesis;

509

human pathogens previously assigned to a single species have been found to show different levels

510

of virulence and in some cases cause different diseases. The case of Histoplasma exemplifies this

511

utility. Recently, four species of Histoplasma were formally adopted following genomic

512

differentiation. These lineages differ in their genome size, in their ability to cause disease and their

513

geographical distribution (76). Analyses of gene flow show that these species exchange genes rarely

514

but that most introgressions are found at low allele frequency which in turn might indicate the

515

possibility that these exchanged alleles are deleterious, or slightly deleterious.

516

The magnitude of genetic differentiation seems to be insufficient to describe the different

517

lineages of C. posadasii as well-formed different species. The case of the Venezuela clade in which

518

the magnitude of interpopulation genetic distance is higher than the variation within Venezuela is

519

worth highlighting. This pattern is caused by two main factors. First, the Venezuela lineage is

520

differentiated from other populations. On average, the ratio of mean interpopulation distance to

521

intrapopulation variation (outside Venezuela) is 1.2. Second, the Venezuela lineage shows a

522

reduction in genetic diversity of 50X compared to other C. posadasii populations. These two

523

patterns have different biological interpretations. First, there is strong population structure

524

between species of Coccidioides which in turn might be a signal of incipient and recent speciation.

525

Nonetheless, differentiation between incipient speciation and strong population structure is a

526

major challenge (77, 78), which cannot be tackled without prima facie evidence of reproductive

527

isolation. Additionally, the lower variability in Venezuela leads to a skewed ratio of inter- to intra

528

population variation in pairwise comparisons involving Venezuela, and to some extent Guatemala,

529

but this is not caused by an increase in the interpopulation differentiation but by an extreme

530

reduction in intraspecific variation. Moreover, we observe a single mating-type (MAT1-2) within the

531

Venezuelan population and according to the typical bipolar mating system of Eurotiomycetes, both

532

opposite mating types cells (MAT1-1 and MAT1-2) are need for sexual recombination. Thus, we

533

conclude that this is likely an extreme bottleneck event, and not a signature of speciation.

534

Our analyses are parallel to other approaches previously used to quantify the magnitude of

535

interspecific gene flow between species of pathogenic fungi, but our focus differs from these

536

studies; our goal was to study whether populations of C. posadasii across the geographic range of

537

the species are differentiated and exchange alleles. An overlooked aspect of population genetics in

538

fungi is the magnitude of population structure within species. Understanding how species are

539

separated into populations across geography is a prerequisite to address where genetic variation

540

associated with virulence is originating across the geographic range of a species. Intraspecific

541

population structure and speciation are part of a continuum that is modulated by the strength of

542

reproductive isolation and the extent of genetic divergence between lineages (79, 80). The

543

continuous nature of divergence and speciation makes the distinction of species boundaries

544

challenging because population genetics estimates of differentiation cannot distinguish between

545

nascent species and well-structured and old populations of the same species (78, 81). This is

546

especially true for populations that occur in allopatry and do not interbreed.

547

Studying the magnitude of intraspecific gene exchange is not devoid of challenges. Species

548

that have achieved genome-wide reciprocal monophyly will show fixed differences, which allows

549

for detection of alleles that have crossed species boundaries after hybridization (e.g., (28, 82)).

550

Populations from the same species, or even incipient species, are less likely to show these fixed

551

differences, and analyses of introgression must be done based on differences of allele frequencies.

552

This approach has proven useful in human populations (83) and maize (84) (reviewed in (85)). In

553

the case of C. posadasii populations, it is possible that shared ancestry among populations is not

554

caused by gene exchange but by incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) across different populations. This

555

retention of ancestral alleles might be due to balancing selection, or simply by chance (86, 87). As

556

genetic divergence accumulates the likelihood of retaining ancestral polymorphism by chance

557

decreases, thus when divergence is still recent (populations or incipient species) ILS should be

558

common (87, 88).

559

The Coccidioides posadasii population from Venezuela is not the only fungal pathogen from

560

this country that shows signatures of genetic isolation. In the case of Paracoccidioides, two species

561

coexist in the same geographic range; one endemic species, P. venezuelensis, and a species with

562

broader distribution, P. americana, found in Venezuela and Brazil (89, 90). Whether the

563

environments of Venezuela facilitate divergence, or whether it is a case of differences in sampling

564

effort remains unknown. These two possibilities are both likely as xeric environments in South

565

America have not been systematically sampled for Coccidioides, and it is possible that each xeric

566

environment harbors its own lineage of Coccidioides. In the case of Paracoccidioides, sampling effort

567

has been roughly equivalent in multiple countries and Venezuela harbors two species, a number

568

similar to the number of species in Brazil, a country with an area nine times larger.

569

Hybridization and gene exchange seem to be of common occurrence during the

570

evolutionary history of fungal pathogens. For example, Paracoccidioides species show complete

571

mitochondrial capture which is reflected in the discordance between nuclear and mitochondrial

572

gene genealogies (50). Histoplasma ohiense and Histoplasma mississippiense show evidence of

573

admixture in their nuclear genome but such exchanged alleles are at low frequency (76, 82).

574

Cryptococcus species also show evidence of shared genetic variation (91). This pattern is not limited

575

to human pathogens. Plant pathogens and saprobic fungi also show evidence of gene exchange but

576

the features that govern the magnitude of gene exchange remain unknown (e.g., (92, 93); reviewed

577

in (94)). These general patterns are consistent with trends observed in other taxa but need to be

578

formally tested in fungi.

579

Genetic variation among all taxa is dictated by the generation of new variants by mutation,

580

migration, and recombination (63, 95). Geography plays a fundamental role on how these variants

581

are maintained over time (96). Semi-isolated lineages might serve as reservoirs of variation which

582

might feed into the main gene pool of a species by regular, but not constant, gene flow. These

583

metapopulation dynamics in which populations are connected to each other, but where there is the

584

possibility for population divergence and contact, is not exclusive to pathogens. In the case of

585

Coccidioides, a systematic sampling of xeric and other suitable environments is sorely needed to

586

assess how selection might dictate the sojourn of new mutations and also the evolutionary history

587

of the species. More generally, approaches that incorporate spatial and temporal partitioning of

588

genetic variation in pathogens will be crucial to understanding the factors that shape the genome

589

and species history of organisms crucial to human well-being.
