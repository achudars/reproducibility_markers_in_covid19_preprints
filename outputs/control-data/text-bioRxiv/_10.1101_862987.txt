Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs) enable cardiotoxicity
testing and personalized medicine. However, their maturity is of concern, including relatively
depolarized resting membrane potential and more spontaneous activity compared to adult
cardiomyocytes, implicating low or lacking inward-rectifier potassium current (Ik1). Here, protein
quantification confirms Ik1 expression in hiPS-CM syncytia, albeit several times lower than in
adult heart tissue. We find that hiPS-CM cell culture density influences Ik1 expression and the
associated electrophysiology phenotype. All-optical cardiac electrophysiology and
pharmacological treatments reveal reduction of spontaneous and irregular activity in denser
cultures. Blocking Ik1 with BaCl2 increased spontaneous frequency and blunted action potential
upstrokes during pacing in a dose-dependent manner only in the highest-density cultures, in line
with Ik1’s role in regulating the resting membrane potential. Our results emphasize the importance
of syncytial growth of hiPS-CM for more physiologically-relevant phenotype and the power of alloptical electrophysiology to study cardiomyocytes in their multicellular setting.

Introduction
The growing use of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs)
provides genetically-diverse human cardiac models to study cardiac arrhythmia patients with
different phenotypes and to assess proarrhythmic risk of new drugs in vitro (Savla, Nelson et al.
2014, Shinnawi, Huber et al. 2015). Currently, several cardiomyopathy phenotypes have been
successfully recapitulated in vitro, including dilated cardiomyopathy (Sun, Yazawa et al. 2012),
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Lan, Lee et al. 2013) and arrhythmogenic right ventricle
cardiomyopathy (Caspi, Huber et al. 2013). Furthermore, these experimental cardiac models are
used for discovering new drug therapies (Wen, Wei et al. 2015) and for cardiotoxicity screening
(Liang, Lan et al. 2013). This approach overcomes the limitations of species differences in cardiac
electrophysiology when using animal models to tackle human diseases (Davis, Casini et al. 2012)
and the limitations of studying ion channel macromolecular structures in artificial heterologous
expression systems (Hoekstra, Mummery et al. 2012). As the main source of healthy human
cardiomyocytes, hiPS-CMs have also been widely used in basic science investigations of human
cardiomyocyte calcium handling, metabolism studies, single-cell and multicellular contractility and
others (Magdy, Schuldt et al. 2018).
Outstanding concerns about iPS-CMs are related to their level of maturity when compared to adult
cardiac tissue. Differences from primary adult cardiomyocytes are seen in cell morphology,
calcium handling, glycolysis-based metabolism, and higher cell automaticity (Magdy, Schuldt et
al. 2018). While spontaneous contractions of iPS-CM are considered a sign of successful
differentiation, high-frequency spontaneous activity is also a proarrhythmic trait in ventricular cells
and it influences the iPS-CM’s credibility as a proper in vitro model. It has been shown that the
spontaneous activity of iPS-CM may be partially influenced by low levels of the inward rectifier
potassium current (Ik1) (Vaidyanathan, Markandeya et al. 2016, Li, Kanda et al. 2017). The Ik1
current, encoded by Kir2.1, plays an important role in the stabilization of the cardiac resting
potential, the upstroke of the and the late repolarization of the action potential (Figure 1).
Insufficient number or low conductance of Kir2.1 ion channels can cause lower membrane
resistance (Schanne, Lefloch et al. 1990), with a net inward current during rest, thus a relativelydepolarized resting membrane potential, increased spontaneous rates (Nuss, Marban et al. 1999),
slower upstroke and potentially can also affect the action potential duration of hiPS-CMs.
Several approaches have been pursued to increase Ik1 in hiPS-CMs. These include: a). Electrical
injection of calculated Ik1-like current via dynamic voltage clamp was applied (Bett, Kaplan et al.
2013, Meijer van Putten, Mengarelli et al. 2015); b). Optical dynamic clamp (ODC) has been
applied using light and outward-current-generating opsin ArchT to create a computationallyidentical Ik1 contribution (Quach, Krogh-Madsen et al. 2018); and c). Adenoviral overexpression
of Kir2.1 has been applied to boost Ik1 in hiPS-CMs (Vaidyanathan, Markandeya et al. 2016, Li,
Kanda et al. 2017). Through increased functional contribution of Ik1 (or Ik1-like) current, all three
methods claimed a more mature-looking action potential with less depolarized resting membrane
potential and suppressed spontaneous activity. As a result, more physiologically-relevant
responses to ion channel blockers were reported.
Standard studies of ion channel contributions, including all Ik1 studies in hiPS-CM, are conducted
on single cells using voltage-clamp technology. These studies limit the physiological relevance of
the obtained functional data, as isolated cardiomyocytes are phenotypically different from cells
that exist in a well-coupled cardiac tissue. The cell viability at the end of the cell isolation and the

small number of cells that can be studied by such manual techniques inevitably induce selection
bias (Hoekstra, Mummery et al. 2012). Previous studies (Du, Hellen et al. 2015, Kane, Du et al.
2016) have drawn attention to the higher variability in cell morphology and function, including
action potential morphology, exhibited by hiPS-CMs cultured at low plating density. Other reports
have indicated possible effects of cell culture density and cell-cell contacts on gene transcription
of specific ion channels (Schanne, Lefloch et al. 1990, Hershman and Levitan 1998, Uesugi,
Ojima et al. 2014). These studies prompted us to consider that hiPS-CM multicellular growth
conditions may influence cell maturity and the Ik1 contributions to cardiac cell function.
Several voltage-clamp studies of isolated myocytes from adult human heart tissue have reported
Ik1 values between 3.6 and 32pA/pF at highly hyperpolarized potentials of -100mV, while values
for hiPS-CMs were found to be 10 to 100 times lower (Meijer van Putten, Mengarelli et al. 2015),
although recent studies question these findings (Horvath, Lemoine et al. 2018). At these
hyperpolarized voltage levels, Ik1 is an inward current and indicates more the power to excite
rather than maintain resting membrane potential. The peak outward Ik1 current for isolated
myocytes from adult human heart tissue has been reported in the range of 0.4 to 2.2pA/pF (Doss,
Di Diego et al. 2012, Meijer van Putten, Mengarelli et al. 2015); the values for the outward Ik1
current in hiPS-CMs have been controversial. Through computations and dynamic clamp studies,
it has been shown that peak outward Ik1 influences the resting membrane potential for values
under about 3pA/pF, i.e. within the physiological range. To this end, protein quantification and
direct comparison between multicellular hiPS-CMs and adult human ventricle has not been done.
Furthermore, with a few exceptions, detailed functional interrogations of Ik1’s contributions in
multicellular hiPS-CMs are mostly lacking. In this study we investigate the role of cell density on
Ik1 and hiPS-CM electrophysiology using protein quantification, all-optical cardiac
electrophysiology, pharmacological probing and computational analysis.

Results
Syncytia of hiPS-CMs express Kir2.1, albeit at lower levels than adult human tissue;
blocking degradation pathways does not rescue Kir2.1 levels.
Previous voltage-clamp studies in isolated human iPS-CMs have reported the lack of or
insufficient levels of Ik1 compared to adult cardiomyocytes (Meijer van Putten, Mengarelli et al.
2015), with differences at the single-cell level on the order of 10-100 times.
Here, we quantified Kir2.1 protein levels in iPS-CM syncytia using Western Blot and compared
those to levels found in various cardiac tissues, including adult human ventricular tissue, adult
and neonatal rat ventricular tissues, using wild type HeLa cells as a negative control (Figure 2).
Kir2.1 protein was detected at around 48kDa in all samples except wild-type HeLa. Human iPSCM syncytia were found to have lower normalized protein levels (based on Kir2.1/GAPDH ratio)
compared to human heart and rat heart samples. Based on these results (n=4-9 per group), hiPSCMs’ Kir2.1 expression is about six-fold lower (or about 16.4%) compared to adult human
ventricular tissue (Figure 2B). These results confirm previously observed lower Kir2.1 levels in
hiPS-CMs, however show less dramatic differences (by an order of magnitude – 6-fold vs. up to
100-fold) compared to results using voltage-clamp in single cells. These findings drew our

attention to the possibility that syncytial growth may influence the contribution of Ik1 to
electrophysiological function in important ways, and motivated the pursuit of functional
experiments in various hiPS-CM growth condition, changing cell culture density.
To check the possibility that abnormally-fast degradation may be contributing to the lower Kir2.1
protein levels in hiPS-CMs, we applied pharmacological blocking of lysosomal degradation of
Kir2.1 (Suppl. Figure 1). A previous study (Varkevisser et al. 2013) has demonstrated that
dynasore, a non-competitive inhibitor of GTPase activity of dynamin, can inhibit the clathrinmediated endocytosis of Kir2.1 and preserve it from degradation. We treated syncytial samples
of iPS-CMs. Western blot results for 10µM dynasore over 24 hours showed only mild effects on
Kir2.1 protein levels (Suppl. Figure 1).
Frequency of spontaneous oscillations in hiPS-CMs increases with lower cell density.
Pharmacological probing confirms functional Ik1 contribution only in denser cell cultures.
Functional measurements of voltage and intracellular calcium were carried out in a 96-well plate
format using all-optical methods (Figure 1). Three cell density conditions were established by
plating 50,000, 25,000 and 12,500 cells per well. Under the high-density condition, well-connected
syncytium was formed, with synchronous contractions. Middle-density wells formed less
connected cell subgroups with gaps in between. Cells in low cell density wells were more
separated, forming smaller groups (Suppl. Figure 2), and more likely to exhibit asynchronous
subgroup behavior, as seen in other studies as well (Kim, Yang et al. 2015).
Quantification of spontaneous oscillations under different cell plating densities (Figure 3) revealed
a decrease in spontaneous beating frequency with the increase of cell culture density, e.g. the
low-density group had about 2-fold higher intrinsic frequency of oscillations compared to the highdensity cultures. For the sparser cultures, we averaged the frequency of oscillations recorded at
multiple clusters within a well.
Considering that low levels of Ik1 are a key driver of spontaneous oscillations in ventricular cells
(Schanne, Ruiz-Ceretti et al. 1977, Schanne, Lefloch et al. 1990, Nuss, Marban et al. 1999), we
applied a classic pharmacological blocker of Ik1 (BaCl2) to the samples with different plating
density to test if there will be change in their rates of spontaneous oscillations. The effect on
oscillatory activity was quantified as a relative change in spontaneous frequency (%) from
untreated conditions, normalized to levels before drug application in the same samples. As
summarized in Figure 3B (experiments done according to the sequential dosing described in
Figure 1), the syncytial high-density group showed a well-defined dose-dependent increase in
the frequency of oscillations, as expected from blocking endogenous IK1 (*P < 0.05). In the middle
and low-density groups, such dose-dependent changes did not exist or were less pronounced,
suggesting little functional contribution of Ik1. These findings were corroborated in alternative sets
of experiments, where BaCl2 was applied in parallel to physically-different samples – Suppl.
Figure 3.
Lower cell density and suppression of IK1 increase occurrences of irregular activity
In addition to the increased frequency of spontaneous activity, the lower-density samples
exhibited more irregular activity and variability in the morphology of the action potentials, as seen
in other studies as well (Du, Hellen et al. 2015, Kim, Yang et al. 2015, Kane, Du et al. 2016).

Irregular activity included: 1) small fluctuations during the resting membrane potential, 2) action
potentials with variable amplitude and duration, and 3) embedded lower frequency wave
component in the records.
To quantify irregular activity among the different cell density groups, membrane voltage and
intracellular calcium were recorded optically. As summarized in Figure 4, no irregular activity was
observed in the analyzed traces from the middle and high-density groups under control conditions,
while 75% of the low-density cell samples contained such records. Increasing doses of BaCl 2 to
block Ik1 brought about irregular activity in the middle and high-density groups. Again, the high
cell density group remained with the least percent of irregular activity events but showed dose
dependence. The specific action of BaCl2 on Ik1 current and the dose-response in the highdensity group potentially support higher functional Kir2.1 expression and contribution compared
to lower-density samples.
In paced conditions, Ik1 levels mainly influence the action potential upstroke, with milder
effects on APD
Previous dynamic clamp studies and computational work have indicated effects of Ik1 levels on
the morphology of the action potentials in hiPS-CMs (Meijer van Putten, Mengarelli et al. 2015).
To study these in controlled conditions, we combined the optical records with optical pacing
(Klimas, Ortiz et al. 2019). The recorded paced action potentials (0.7Hz at room temperature)
were analyzed by features like action potential upstroke velocity and action potential duration at
90% repolarization (APD90).
Blocking Ik1 with increasing doses of BaCl2 in the high-density samples led to a dose-dependent
decrease of AP upstroke (Figure 5A), likely due to lower availability of Na+ channels as a result
of the more depolarized resting membrane potential. Negligible effects were observed on APD90
in the tested range of Ik1 values (Figure 5B). Computer simulations with a generic adult cardiac
ventricular cell model (Luo and Rudy 1994) matched the experimental results considering
expected low levels of Ik1 (under 30%, see red-outlined areas), Figure 5C-D. Note that the
responses to blocking of Ik1 are different if the cells express higher levels. Similar effects were
reported from a dynamic clamp study in hiPS-CMs and computations (Meijer van Putten,
Mengarelli et al. 2015) where Ik1 current injection varied from 1 pA/pF to 10 pA/pF. Based on
comparison with that study, the red-boxed range of relevant Ik1 values, where AP upstroke is
sensitive to Ik1 block and APD90 is not sensitive, likely encompasses peak outward Ik1 values
below 3 pA/pF for our syncytial high-density hiPS-CMs; this range includes the values for adult
human cardiomyocytes.
Extending this to variations in cell density and dosing with BaCl2, we found that dose-dependent
decrease trends for the maximum upstroke velocity exist in the high and middle density groups,
but not the low-density group (Figure 6). When comparing the decrease in maximum upstroke
velocity before and after 0.5mM BaCl2 treatment, we see the biggest difference in the high cell
density group, corroborating Ik1 functional contribution in that group.
Cell density also influences responsiveness to blockers of spontaneous calcium release
In addition to the Ik1-mediated mechanism of spontaneous oscillations, activation of the forward
mode of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) and abnormal opening of the ryanodine receptors (RyR)
both can increase the probability for spontaneous calcium release (SCR) in cardiomyocytes

(Suppl. Figure 4A). If SCR contributes to oscillatory activity along with the low Ik1 levels, blocking
the function of either of the calcium-related proteins should decrease cell automaticity. Here, we
find that different cell culture densities vary in their sensitivity to the blocking of these channels.
As expected, the oscillations in the low-density culture were found more sensitive to blockage of
SCR. While 10M ryanodine caused only about 15% decrease of spontaneous activity in the highdensity culture, the low-density group experienced stronger effects. Blockage of NCX by
SEA0400 also had higher effect in the low-density culture compared to the high-density culture.
The SEA0400 dosage increase from 2M to 4M showed relative dose-dependent effects in both
groups (Suppl. Figure 4B).

Discussion
Applications of human iPS-cardiomyocytes for better understanding of human cardiac disease
and for personalized medicine require their functional maturation. In the native heart,
cardiomyocytes are functioning as well-connected excitable units. Syncytial in vitro growth of iPSCM is expected to help create conditions that are closer to the native environment, compared to
isolated cells, and therefore yield a more mature phenotype.
Studies of improving maturity of human iPS-CMs over the last decade span a range of approaches,
which include micropatterning, mechanical stretching, electrical field stimulation, induction of cell
alignment, genetic manipulations to induce gene expression, delivery of biochemical factors, such
as triiodothyronine and alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine or a combination of these (Yang,
Pabon et al. 2014). While these strategies of various sophistication levels all may help the
maturation of iPS-CMs, the fundamental cell-cell contact effects brought about by syncytial cell
growth may represent a simple and impactful way to yield a more mature phenotype for human
iPS-CMs.
Here we used protein quantification to establish the expression of Kir2.1 (encoding Ik1) in syncytia
of human iPS-CMs, albeit at about 6 times lower levels than in adult human or rat heart tissue
(Figure 2). This is in contrast with prior studies in isolated human iPS-CMs that found Ik1
completely lacking (Vaidyanathan, Markandeya et al. 2016, Li, Kanda et al. 2017) or at negligible
levels. Further pharmacological investigation (using dynasore as a blocker of clathrin-mediated
internalization pathways, Suppl. Figure 1) revealed that faster protein degradation is likely not
the cause for the lower Ik1 protein levels in hiPS-CMs compared to adult ventricular myocytes,
and instead perhaps protein synthesis is different.
To assess the impact of cell density on the contribution of Ik1 to iPS-CM electrophysiology, we
created conditions of variable cell density growth and applied all-optical electrophysiology to
probe function in these samples. As a fundamental regulator of the resting membrane potential,
Ik1 is known to be a key determinant of spontaneous oscillations in ventricular myocytes.
Accordingly, we found correlation between the frequency of spontaneous oscillations and the cell
density explored in the current study. The highest density syncytial samples showed the lowest
frequency of spontaneous oscillations (as mature ventricular cells would) and the lowest
occurrence of irregular rhythms (Figures 3 and 4). Furthermore, pharmacological probing of the
contributions of Ik1 by variable doses of BaCl2 revealed a dose-response only in these highdensity samples, while minimal effects were registered in the lower-density samples, with

presumably missing Ik1 (Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6, Suppl. Figure 3). Comparing experimental data
on the effects of lower Ik1 levels on paced action potentials in the hiPS-CMs with computational
predictions for adult ventricular myocytes with variable levels of Ik1, we identified key features
that are sensitive to Ik1 variations, AP upstroke in particular. Such computations also helped us
narrow down the likely range of Ik1 peak outward current in the syncytial human iPS-CM samples
to be below 3-4 pA/pF (Figure 6), in line with some previous reports (Meijer van Putten, Mengarelli
et al. 2015). Cell density was found to impact also alternative (to the Ik1) potential mechanisms
of spontaneous oscillations in the human iPS-CMs, related to spontaneous calcium release,
Suppl. Figure 4). Frequency of oscillations was more easily suppressed by blockers of NCX and
of the RyR receptors in the lower-density samples. Theoretically, in conditions of minimal Ik1 and
therefore relatively depolarized resting membrane potential, spontaneous calcium release is
expected to more easily lead to voltage oscillations.
Overall, our results draw attention to the importance of syncytial conditions for the
electrophysiology of human iPS-CMs; they corroborate previous studies where cell growth density
was shown to influence iPS-CM action potential morphology (Du et al. 2015)(Horvath, Lemoine
et al. 2018). Furthermore, earlier work with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes demonstrates cell density
influence on the expression of potassium ion channels (Guo, Kamiya et al. 1996, Hershman and
Levitan 1998). Our results showing that cell density of human iPS-CMs influences Kir2.1
expression and the functional contribution of Ik1 to human iPS-CM electrophysiology is in line
with such studies.
A potential mechanism for these effects is the impact that cell-cell contacts have on the expression
of ion channels, contributing to differences in the electrophysiology of isolated cells compared to
that of cells within a syncytium. Co-localization of ion channels, for example the sodium channel
Nav1.5 (encoded by SCN5a), with gap junctional structures (Cx43) has been demonstrated
before in cardiac tissue (Kucera, Rohr et al. 2002). Macromolecular complexes of ion channels
providing opposing ion fluxes at the cell membrane, e.g. Nav1.5 and Ik1, and their co-localization
with the intercalated disks and the perinexus area of cell-cell contacts (Milstein, Musa et al. 2012,
Veeraraghavan, Lin et al. 2016) are of particular interest as an efficient mechanism for control of
cardiac excitability. Such partnerships and several other known ion channel macromolecular
assemblies (Abriel, Rougier et al. 2015) imply that Kir2.1 expression is indeed likely regulated by
cell-cell contacts and ion channel clustering, driven by adhesion and gap-junctional proteins,
which would only exist in multicellular preparations. This can explain and reconcile our results
showing Ik1 contribution in human iPS-CMs only in the denser cell cultures and previous patchclamp studies reporting lack of Ik1 in isolated cardiomyocytes.
It is important to point out that the classic tools to directly study cardiac electrophysiology, e.g.
the patch clamp and voltage clamp, rely primarily on cells in isolation. The limitations of these
classic approaches have been pointed out recently (Horvath, Lemoine et al. 2018), specifically in
the context of lower seal resistance and ability to assess resting membrane potential when Ik1
levels are low. As in the study by Horvath et al., which analyzed and compared data from isolated
cells and from hiPS-CM monolayers and 3D engineered tissues to find similarities between
properties of multicellular hiPS-CM samples and adult heart tissue, we highlight the importance
of the syncytial setting for cardiomyocytes. Cell dissociation procedures are likely harsher on
hiPS-CM aggregates compared to human heart tissue. All-optical cardiac electrophysiology, as
used here, offers powerful ways to probe cell phenotypes within the multicellular setting. Albeit
not ideal, e.g. in its present form, it cannot report directly contributions of a specific ion current as

voltage clamp does, this approach can provide the most comprehensive view of functional
responses of hiPS-CMs in a syncytium and can do so in a contactless high-throughput manner
(Entcheva 2013, Entcheva and Bub 2016). Further developments may make it possible to also
obtain presently missing quantitative ion current information by implementing versions of an
optical clamp (Quach, Krogh-Madsen et al. 2018) in conjunction with computational tools.
In summary, this study illustrates that syncytial growth of human iPS-CMs represents a simple
approach to influence ion channel expression and obtain a more mature phenotype. All-optical
electrophysiology techniques can help track the functional responses of hiPS-CMs and accelerate
their application to personalized medicine and optimization for heart regeneration purposes.

Methods
Human iPS-CM plating and cell culture
Human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iCell Cardiomyocytes2 CMC-100-012-001) from Cellular
Dynamics International (CDI), Madison, WI, were thawed based on the manufacturer's
instructions. For protein quantification, cells were plated on fibronectin-coated 6-well plate with
recommended plating density of 156,000 cells cm−2. For functional recordings, fibronectin-coated
96-well glass-bottom plates were used. Three tested cell culture density are 156,000 cells cm−2,
78,000 cells cm−2 and 39,000 cells cm−2, which represent 50,000 (high density), 25,000 (medium
density) or 12,500 (low density) cells per well, respectively. All studies were conducted on days
7-8 after thaw.
Optogenetic transduction of hiPS-CMs
To enable optical pacing, hiPS-CMs were infected with Ad-CMV-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP 5 days
after cell plating, as previously described (Ambrosi and Entcheva 2014, Ambrosi, Boyle et al.
2015). Maintenance medium, containing viral doses of multiplicity of infection (MOI 350), was
applied for 2 hours. In the 2 hours period, cells were incubated under 37 °C, 5% CO2 and gently
agitated every 20 minutes. After 2 hours infection, normal maintenance medium was applied.
Functional tests were performed 48 hours after viral delivery.
iPS-CM protein collection
Protein samples from iPSC-CMs were collected 5 days after cell plating. The whole process was
done on ice. After ice cold PBS washes, 120l RIPA buffer was added in each well and the plate
was shaken for 5 minutes. After cells detached from plate, suspended cell content was transferred
into microcentrifuge tubes and spun at 15,000 xg for 30 min in a pre-cooled 4℃ centrifuge. Clear
supernatant was separated for protein quantification.
Adult human heart tissue processing
Flash-frozen adult human heart tissue was purchased from Amsbio and stored at -80 ℃. For
protein collection, 30mg of frozen tissue was minced and put on TissueLyser with metal beads
and 1ml of RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), run at 50Hz for 2 minutes. Tissue lysis then

was spun on 4℃ precooled centrifuge for 1 minute to remove the foam, then the TissueLyser step
was repeated until tissue was no longer visible; a total of 30min centrifugation at 14,000g, at 4℃.
Western Blot protein quantification
The total protein amount was quantified using standard BCA assay in all lysates. Then 5-10ug
protein per sample was loaded onto 4%-20% gradient gel (Bio-rad) and the gel was run for 2
hours at 90mV. Then bands were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane using a semidry
transfer system (Bio-rad). 5% nonfat milk (Nestle) in TBST buffer (Bio-rad) was used to block the
membrane for 1 hour in room temperature. For probing, Kir2.1 antibody (Abcam, ab65796) was
diluted 1:200 in 5% nonfat milk in TBST and incubated with the nitrocellulose membrane at 4
degC overnight. The membrane was rinsed with TBST three times, 10 mins each. HRP goat antirabbit antibody (Abcam, ab6721) diluted 1:1000 in 5% milk in TBST was applied for 1 hour under
room temperature. After three 10 minutes TBST washes, the HRP signal was enhanced by
Radiance Plus (Azure) for imaging. Images were taken by Azure C600 Biosystem. After stripping
the membrane with striping buffer (15g glycine, 1g SDS, 10 mL Tween20 in 1liter of ultrapure
water, adjust pH to 2.2), the membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST again for 1 h in
room temperature. GAPDH (Abcam, ab181602) was probed as loading control. 1:1000 GAPDH
antibody in 5% milk in TBST was incubated overnight at 4 degC. Same secondary antibody was
used to probe the bands and blots were imaged with the same method.
Functional measurements with all-optical cardiac electrophysiology
Functional experiments were performed using all-optical cardiac electrophysiology as described
earlier (Klimas, Ambrosi et al. 2016, Klimas, Ortiz et al. 2019). These were carried out at room
temperature in Tyrode's solution (in mM): NaCl, 135; MgCl2, 1; KCl, 5.4; CaCl2, 2; NaH2PO4, 0.33;
glucose, 5.1; and HEPES, 5 adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. The optical setup was built around an
inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti2), as described in (Klimas, Ambrosi et al. 2016, Klimas,
Ortiz et al. 2019). Optical pacing was done by 470nm light pulses of 5ms, at 0.6-0.8 Hz, using
irradiances of 0.4–2 mW mm2, as needed. Simultaneous voltage-calcium measurements were
performed using temporal multiplexing and iXon Ultra 897 EMCCD camera (Andor Technology
Ltd., Belfast, UK), run at 200fps, covering a field of view of about 400m x 400m. For spectral
compatibility with ChR2, we used a calcium dye Rhod-4AM at 10M (AAT Bioquest, Sunnyvale,
CA) with fluorescence excitation and emission peaks at 530 nm and 605 nm, respectively, and a
near-infrared voltage dye BeRST1 at 1M (from Evan W. Miller, University of California, Berkeley)
with fluorescence excitation at 660nm and emission above 680nm, as described in (Klimas, Ortiz
et al. 2019). Signals were filtered and analyzed using an automated in-house developed software
to extract relevant parameters related to the action potentials and calcium transients under
spontaneous and optically-paced conditions (Klimas, Ambrosi et al. 2016, Klimas, Ortiz et al.
2019).
Blocking Ik1 with barium chloride
Different doses of 0.1mM, 0.2mM and 0.5mM barium chloride (BaCl2, Sigma-Aldrich) were applied
on each sample serially with 35 min intervals in-between. All-optical electrophysiology was
applied to capture spontaneous and optically-paced voltage and calcium from multiple locations
after each 35 min treatment. The selected doses of BaCl2 for relatively selective suppression of
Ik1 were based on prior studies which used 0.1 to 0.5mM (for up to 100% suppression) specifically

in human iPS-CMs (Doss, Di Diego et al. 2012, Cordeiro, Nesterenko et al. 2013, Vaidyanathan,
Markandeya et al. 2016, Li, Kanda et al. 2017).
Blocking calcium-dependent pathways with SEA400 and Ryanodine
Suppression of spontaneous calcium release was done by blocking the forward mode of the NCX
using SEA0400 (ApexBio, cat no. A3811) at 2M and at 4M and by blocking the RyR receptors
using Ryanodine (Tocris, cat no. 1329). at 10M. All-optical electrophysiology was applied to
capture spontaneous calcium activity in the low and high-density samples before and 5 min after
drug application.
Blocking clathrin-dependent protein degradation with dynasore
Dynasore (Sigma-Aldrich, cat no. D7693) was dissolved in DMSO at 10mM and stored at -20℃.
Upon usage, it was diluted in cell culture media at 10µM applied for 24 hours or 48 hours, based
on prior studies (Varkevisser, Houtman et al. 2013). After the treatment, cells were lysed for
protein quantification using RIPA buffer.
Computational modeling of the Ik1 contribution to action potential parameters
Action potential simulations were done using the Luo Rudy’s mammalian ventricular cell
mathematical model (Luo and Rudy 1994), which includes the main factors that shape the action
potential morphology. In the modeling, the Ik1 current density was varied under S1-S2 stimulation
protocol. The measured outputs included action potential upstroke velocity and action potential
duration at 90% repolarization (APD90).
Statistical analysis
Comparisons between different groups were done using either single-way or two-way ANOVA
with a Tukey-Kramer post-hoc correction for multiple comparisons. Significant differences were
considered at p<0.05.

Figure Legends
Figure 1. Experimental design using all-optical electrophysiology to probe Ik1 effects in
syncytia of human iPS-CMs. (A) 96-well plate format was used for functional tests. High (H),
medium (M) and low (L) cell density were achieved by plating: 50,000, 25,000 and 12,500 cells
per well, respectively. (B) Pharmacological probing for Ik1 contributions by sequential application
of increasing doses of BaCl2. Functional (voltage and calcium) data were simultaneously collected
35min after each dose treatment under spontaneous conditions (S) and under optical pacing. (C)
Expected functional electrophysiological implications of the Ik1 current: effects on the resting
membrane potential, action potential upstroke and contributions to late repolarization. (D)
Example image of dual-labeled sample for functional voltage and calcium recordings along with
example records. Scale bar is 50m.
Figure 2. Protein quantification of Kir 2.1 in human iPS-CMs, adult human ventricle, adult
and neonatal rat ventricular tissue, and wild-type HeLa cells as a negative control. (A)
Western blot results for Kir2.1 protein expression and GAPDH as a loading control. Kir2.1 protein
is detected at around 48kDa. (B) Western blot quantification based on Kir2.1/ GAPDH ratio (n=49 per sample type, data pooled from five different runs). Tissue samples came from one female
and one male human heart, two neonatal and one adult rat hearts; iPS-CM samples came from
different cell cultures. Data are normalized by the female human ventricle and shown as mean+/SD.
Figure 3. Unmasking IK1 contributions to spontaneous activity across different cell culture
densities using BaCl2. (A) Spontaneous frequency (Hz) of iPS-CM decreases with the increase
of cell culture density (*P < 0.05); 2-fold and 1.3 times higher frequency in the low and medium
density groups compared to the high-density samples. (B) Changes in spontaneous frequency
(%) from baseline are shown for different doses of BaCl2. The syncytial high-density group shows
a dose-dependent increase in the frequency of oscillations, as expected from IK1 block (*P < 0.05).
Effects of BaCl2 without clear dose dependence in the medium and low-density samples are
indicative of minimal Ik1. Data for this plot were from several locations within n=6 multicellular
samples (5 for the low-density group with several isolated regions), subjected to the full sequential
drug treatment protocol (12 cases of density and drug dose), data presented as mean+/-SE.
Additional experiments with parallel (non-sequential) administration of BaCl2 doses were done,
yielding similar outcomes, as presented in Suppl. Fig. 3.
Figure 4. Irregular activity as function of cell density and suppression of I K1 by BaCl2. (A)
Irregular activity is prominent in the low-density group at baseline (no BaCl2) and is brought about
in the medium and high-density groups by high doses of BaCl2. (B) Example traces (spontaneous
voltage and calcium) for regular and irregular activity. These results were from multiple records
n=11 to 29 per case (12 cases of density and drug dose), see Table of record numbers in the
Supplement.

hiPSC-CMs. Experimentally-obtained (A) maximum upstroke velocity (a.u.) from voltagesensitive fluorescence dye’s records (∆F/F) of optically-paced action potentials, 0.7Hz; and (B)
action potential duration at 90% repolarization (APD90) under different BaCl2 doses. APD90 shows
minor changes with a trend towards prolongation with BaCl2 treatment. Data are presented as

cardiomyocytes as a function of Ik1, analogous to (A); and for (D) APD90 in adult ventricular
cardiomyocytes as a function of Ik1, analogous to (B). (E) Example traces of simulated action
potentials paced at 0.7Hz for different levels of Ik1. Red boxes in (C) and (D) outline the relevant
low-Ik1 (<30%) regions of the plots as likely seen in the experimental hiPS-CM data in (A) and
(B).
Figure 6. Sensitivity to BaCl2 blocking of Ik1 as function of cell density. Dose response of
experimentally-obtained maximum upstroke velocity (a.u.) of optically-paced action potentials
when BaCl2 is applied. Effects vary between the high, middle and low density iPS-CM cultures.
Inset shows the change in upstroke of BaCl2 treated (0.5mM) samples and control samples for
the three cell densities, with the most pronounced seen in the high-density group. Data (n = 3 to
9 multicellular samples for each of the 12 cases of density and drug dose, multiple locations
averaged) are shown as mean+/-SE.
