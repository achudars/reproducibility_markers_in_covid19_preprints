Abstract

13

Heterogeneity in definition and measurement of complex diseases in Genome-Wide Association

14

Studies (GWAS) may lead to misdiagnoses and misclassification errors that can significantly

15

impact discovery of disease loci. While well appreciated, almost all analyses of GWAS data

16

consider reported disease phenotype values as is without accounting for potential misclassification.

17

Here, we introduce Phenotype Latent variable Extraction of disease misdiagnosis (PheLEx), a

18

GWAS analysis framework that learns and corrects misclassified phenotypes using structured

19

genotype associations within a dataset. PheLEx consists of a hierarchical Bayesian latent variable

20

model, where inference of differential misclassification is accomplished using filtered genotypes

21

while implementing a full mixed model to account for population structure and genetic relatedness

22

in study populations. Through simulations, we show that the PheLEx framework dramatically

23

improves recovery of the correct disease state when considering realistic allele effect sizes

24

compared to existing methodologies designed for Bayesian recovery of disease phenotypes. We

25

also demonstrate the potential of PheLEx for extracting new candidate loci from existing GWAS

26

data by analyzing epilepsy and bipolar disorder phenotypes available from the UK Biobank

27

dataset, where we identify new candidate disease loci not previously reported for these datasets

28

that have biological connections to the disease phenotypes and/or were identified in independent

29

GWAS. In the discussion, we consider both the broader consequences and importance of careful

30

interpretation of misclassification correction in GWAS phenotypes, as well as potential of PheLEx

31

for re-analyzing existing GWAS data to make novel discoveries.

Author Summary

33

Prevalent misdiagnosis of diseases due to lack of understanding and/or gold-standard diagnostic

34

measures can impact any analytics that follow. These misdiagnosis errors are especially

35

significant in the domain of psychiatric or psychological disorders where the definition of

36

disease and/or their diagnostic tools are always in flux or under further improvement. Here, we

37

propose a method to extract misdiagnosis from disease and infer the correct disease phenotype.

38

We examined the performance of this method on rigorous simulations and real disease

39

phenotypes obtained from the UK Biobank database. We found that this method successfully

40

recovered misdiagnosed individuals in simulations using a carefully designed hierarchical

41

Bayesian latent variable model framework. For real disease phenotypes, epilepsy and bipolar

42

disorder, this method not only suggested an alternate phenotype but results from this method

43

were also used to discover new genomic loci that have been previously showed to be associated

44

with the respective phenotypes, suggesting that this method can be further used to reanalyze

45

large-scale genetic datasets to discover novel loci that might be ignored using traditional

46

methodologies.

Introduction

48

Identification of statistical associations between phenotypes and genotypes within Genome-wide

49

Association Studies (GWAS) has resulted in the detection of numerous candidate genetic loci that

50

may impact human diseases and other aspects of human physiology[1, 2]. Since the first major

51

GWAS were published[3-6], there has been an increased realization that for many diseases and

52

traits, it will be challenging to identify the bulk of contributing genetic loci due to the nature of

53

genetic effects where issues include small allelic effect sizes, genetic and environmental

54

interactions, and segregation of contributing loci for rare alleles[7, 8]. This realization has driven

55

improved strategies for GWAS discovery such as consortium studies with large sample sizes aimed

56

at increasing power to detect small effect size loci[9-11], sampling of understudied populations to

57

identify loci with differential impacts due to genetics and environment[12-15], and whole-genome

58

sequencing of individuals to assess the impact of rare alleles[16-21]. These strategies have been

59

complemented by continued innovation in analysis methodologies applied to GWAS, including

60

methods that detect epistatic interactions among genetic loci[22-24] and genotype by environment

61

interactions[25-28], as well as methods aimed to extract impact of loci with rare variants[29-33].

62

Together, these innovations in GWAS design and methodology have led to discovery of candidate

63

loci where the impact is particularly noticeable in diseases such as type 2 diabetes and

64

schizophrenia where large-scale consortia studies have enabled isolation of numerous causal loci

65

with low frequency and small effects[2, 34-37]. While these successes justify continued

66

investment in GWAS, it is clear that continued rate of discovery of new loci for well-studied

67

diseases and phenotypes will depend on innovative strategies that leverage underutilized aspects

68

of GWAS.

69
70

A core aspect of GWAS that could be targeted with improved strategies is the phenotype, where

71

there are opportunities for improved phenotype definition[38-40], measurement[41-43], and

72

analysis[44-46]. It is well appreciated that the combination of inconsistency in methods used to

73

diagnose disease[47, 48] and the application of imprecise measurement methodology[43] can

74

introduce phenotyping errors that can reduce discovery potential of a GWAS[49-56]. For example,

75

high misdiagnosis rates have been estimated for disease phenotypes such as Alzheimer’s disease

76

and bipolar disorder which may be misdiagnosed with other forms of dementia and unipolar

77

depression or borderline personality disorder, respectively, due to overlap of symptoms and/or lack

78

of application of Diagnostic Systems Manual criteria[57-64]. As another example, multiple

79

sclerosis has been frequently misdiagnosed with migraine, fibromyalgia and psychogenic disorder

80

due to overlap of symptoms and mistakes in application of clinical and radiographic diagnostic

81

criteria[65]. Though various strategies have been proposed to process GWAS phenotype data[46,

82

66-69], innovations designed to consider alternative phenotypes derived from leveraging structure

83

of total GWAS data are particularly promising for improving candidate loci discovery in GWAS,

84

especially when considering potential for immediate impact and implementation at minimal cost.

85

An underexplored analysis strategy within this class of methods are those that consider

86

misclassification of disease phenotypes[70-73], where error in disease phenotype would result in

87

disease cases recorded as controls and vice versa[74]. Considering disease misdiagnosis rates[75,

88

76], there is significant potential for disease misclassification in GWAS phenotype data where

89

even small numbers of these errors can have significant impact on GWAS statistical power and

90

Type I errors[49, 50].

91
92

There has been surprisingly little attention paid to phenotype misclassification analysis in GWAS,

93

where misclassification errors could be inferred and corrected by making use of genotype

94

associations with phenotype[49, 73, 77]. The only major published methods are Bayesian

95

approaches for recovering nondifferential misclassification (i.e., sensitivity and specificity are

96

considered the same for cases and non-cases/controls)[49, 73] and differential misclassification

97

(sensitivity and specificity are considered different for cases versus non-cases/controls)[77] in

98

GWAS phenotypes. While these methods and their extensions for gene expression data have since

99

been applied in several studies demonstrating potential benefits of misclassification analysis in

100

identifying misdiagnosis of Alzheimer’s patients based on differential gene expression[78, 79],

101

predicting disease subtypes in breast cancer using gene expression data[80], and finding

102

misclassified individuals and estimating SNP effects in simulated GWAS data[49, 73, 77], a

103

number of gaps still remain for the analysis of GWAS data. For example, most applications of

104

existing methods are limited to the extraction of nondifferential misclassification from gene

105

expression datasets and the only application of differential misclassification is presented in

106

simulated GWAS data. Additionally, existing methods fail to account for inherent genetic

107

relatedness and population structure in sampled GWAS populations, which when ignored impede

108

GWAS discovery[81, 82]. Most importantly, these proposed methods for GWAS were only shown

109

to perform well on GWAS datasets simulated with an artificially high number of disease-

110

associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) out of the total number of SNPs (i.e. only

111

150/1000) with genotype-specific disease-odds ratio in the range 4-10. Such simulation scenarios

112

provide an unrealistic picture of the algorithm’s expected performance on real GWAS datasets.

113

These previous methods also failed to directly make use of their improved phenotype

114

classifications to discover new loci from real GWAS datasets, such that real potential for this

115

strategy to make new discoveries from analysis of existing GWAS data has yet to be realized.

116
117

Here, we present a complete framework for Bayesian latent variable misclassification analysis to

118

make new GWAS discoveries: Phenotype Latent Variable Extraction of disease misdiagnosis

119

(PheLEx) (Fig 1). The core of PheLEx is a single modeling framework allowing for differential

120

misclassification in GWAS phenotypes with an underlying full mixed model to account for

121

population structure and genetic relatedness. When concentrating only on the problem of

122

phenotype misclassification, we show that the PheLEx framework dramatically improved

123

performance when analyzing simulated GWAS data that included realistic proportions of disease-

124

associated genotypes in a genome-wide scan and genotype-specific disease-odds ratios consistent

125

with empirical observation[83-85]. Other applications of PheLEx include exploring differential

126

patterns between misclassified and non-misclassified cases within GWAS datasets that may point

127

to potential causes such as misdiagnosis or disease subtypes. Furthermore, we also propose a novel

128

strategy for applying the PheLEx framework to discover new loci within a GWAS dataset by

129

making use of misclassification probabilities for phenotype and strategic filtering of SNPs to

130

improve accuracy and avoid model overfitting. We demonstrate the potential of this innovative

131

application by using PheLEx to analyze datasets for epilepsy and bipolar disorder, where we

132

discover novel candidate loci that were not identified in the traditional analysis of these datasets.

133

While careful interpretation of such PheLEx driven discoveries is critical, these results

134

demonstrate potential of PheLEx for re-analyzing existing GWAS data to make novel discoveries.

Results

143

PheLEx addresses limitations of existing methodologies[49, 73, 77] for Bayesian recovery of

144

disease misclassification by introducing: (i) a more efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)

145

sampling algorithm, (ii) filtration of potentially uninformative genotypes to address issue of

146

disproportionate ratio of disease-associated SNPs in GWAS, and (iii) accounting for genetic

147

relatedness and population structure. Using Adaptive Metropolis-Hastings within Gibbs sampling

148

instead of Gibbs Sampling to sample model parameters (i.e., SNP effect sizes, true-positive rate,

149

false-positive rate and random effects) allows PheLEx more flexibility in sampling parameter

150

estimates from landscape of posterior probabilities. As accuracy of misclassification probability

151

under the misclassification model depends on estimated function of SNP effects and typically most

152

SNPs in a linkage disequilibrium (LD) -pruned GWAS dataset are not associated with phenotype

153

of interest, PheLEx filters out potentially uninformative SNPs by taking a subset of statistically

154

significant GWAS genotypes as input, providing significant advances in terms of computational

155

expense and misclassification accuracy. As population structure and genetic relatedness are a

156

reality of most GWAS datasets[81, 82, 86], PheLEx accounts for these effects, which is critical

157

for estimating accurate misclassification probabilities.

158
159

Beyond these methodology improvements for identifying misclassified phenotypes within a

160

GWAS dataset, we also introduce a novel application of PheLEx for identifying novel GWAS

161

associations when making use of corrected phenotypes. PheLEx presents functions that can be

162

used to estimate misclassification probabilities to produce a corrected phenotype, which in turn

163

can be used to perform association analysis with the genotypes matrix. The corrected phenotype

164

provides an alternative phenotype for association, allowing for new GWAS discoveries to be made

165

with the new phenotype. Given that PheLEx uses a subset of genotypes to estimate

166

misclassification probabilities, any SNPs not included in this training set (and not in LD with

168

analyzing the corrected phenotype.

170

Simulation results

171

While the complete PheLEx framework includes multiple improvements over existing

172

methodologies, to produce a fair comparison of the improved performance achieved by PheLEx

173

compared to these methodologies[49, 73, 77], we introduced the following versions: (i) PheLEx-

174

mh that incorporated mixed model into existing method by Rekaya et al[77] and (ii) PheLEx-m

175

that excluded mixed model from the method PheLEx. PheLEx-mh, PheLEx-m, Rekaya (existing

176

method) and PheLEx were applied to the simulation datasets to identify misclassified samples

177

from increasingly misclassified simulated phenotypes (misclassification rates 5% to 40%).

178

Differences in performance of PheLEx-m versus Rekaya and PheLEx versus PheLEx-mh showed

179

improvement due to use of alternative MCMC algorithm (Adaptive Metropolis-Hastings within

180

Gibbs sampling over Gibbs Sampling). Comparisons between performance of PheLEx versus

181

PheLEx-m and PheLEx-mh versus Rekaya showed improvement when accounting for mixed

182

effects due to population structure and genetic relatedness.

183
184

Identification of misclassified samples in simulations

185

For the simulated datasets with genetic relatedness/population structure across varying degrees of

186

misclassification (5% to 40%), PheLEx outperformed PheLEx-m, PheLEx-mh and Rekaya while

187

the first three methods also showed superior performance to Rekaya (Figs 2A-E, S1 Fig). Area

188

under Precision-Recall curve (AUC) values computed across simulations were also consistent on

189

performance difference observed with PheLEx having the highest mean AUC across

misclassification levels (Fig 2F), where median AUC values (listed in order of increasing

191

misclassification) for PheLEx (median AUC: 0.552, 0.614, 0.661, 0.657 and 0.643), PheLEx-m

192

(median AUC: 0.134, 0.239, 0.403, 0.543 and 0.600) and PheLEx-mh (median AUC: 0.467, 0.537,

193

0.573, 0.575 and 0.576) were higher than median AUC values for Rekaya (median AUC: 0.0676,

194

0.125, 0.228, 0.329 and 0.408). Performance comparisons using Receiver Operating Characteristic

195

(ROC) curves mirrored these Precision-Recall results (S1 Fig). Additional analysis in datasets

196

simulated without genetic relatedness/population structure also show consistent results (S1 Text).

Accounting for population structure and genetic relatedness resulted in greatest increase in

precision over recall as shown by performance of PheLEx-mh versus Rekaya and PheLEx versus

PheLEx-m. Though use of Adaptive Metropolis-Hastings improved performance, this boost was

209

not on the same scale as observed by introducing the mixed model. Though overall performance

210

improved with increasing rates of misclassification, improvement in performance plateaued

211

around 30%-40% rates of misclassification. This plateau in performance can be explained by

212

reduction in total number of informative SNPs passing filtration criteria due to growing

213

misclassification rates, thus affecting estimated SNP effects and consequently, accuracy of

214

misclassification probabilities inferred.

215
216

Improvement in performance was accompanied by a boost in speed as a result of two important

217

components of the PheLEx framework i.e., filtration of SNPs and use of Adaptive Metropolis-

218

Hastings within Gibbs sampling. Using results from applying misclassification extraction methods

219

(i.e., PheLEx, PheLEx-mh, Rekaya and PheLEx-m) to simulation datasets with genetic

220

relatedness/population structure, we observed running time for each method (S2 Fig). Across all

221

simulations, PheLEx (median time: 31.2 minutes) was more efficient than PheLEx-mh (median

222

time: 601 minutes) while PheLEx-m (median time: 6.34 minutes) was faster than Rekaya (median

223

time: 41.6 minutes). Though accounting for mixed effects adds to running time as shown by

224

comparison between PheLEx-m and PheLEx, PheLEx’s speed was still comparable to that of

225

Rekaya underlining efficiency of our MCMC algorithm of choice.

226
227

GWAS discovery via correction by PheLEx in simulated datasets

228

To explore the impact of identifying misclassified samples on association analysis, we computed

229

corrected phenotypes using misclassification probabilities obtained from PheLEx for simulated

230

data. Corrected phenotypes were produced by switching cases with high misclassification

231

probabilities (determined using thresholds defined in the methods section) to controls using

232

PheLEx. We performed GWAS on simulated true phenotypes (no misclassification), misclassified

233

phenotypes and PheLEx corrected phenotypes, and quantified the ratio of sum of statistically

234

significant disease-associated SNPs (according to Bonferroni-corrected p-value threshold) for

235

misclassified phenotypes and corrected phenotypes against sum of statistically significant disease-

236

associated SNPs for the simulated true phenotypes (no misclassification).

237
238

As expected, with increasing misclassification, this ratio decreased for misclassified and corrected

239

phenotypes signifying disease-associated SNPs that lose statistical significance in GWAS (Fig

240

3A). However, the ratio (listed in order of increasing misclassification) for PheLEx corrected

241

phenotypes (mean ratio: 0.951, 0.894, 0.776, 0.629 and 0.469) improved upon the ratio for

242

misclassified phenotypes (mean ratio: 0.951, 0.891, 0.765, 0.610 and 0.454) at each

243

misclassification level with increased improvements at higher misclassification rates (20-40%).

244

Smaller fractions of disease-associated SNPs were recovered at low misclassification rates as

245

compared to higher misclassification rates. At low misclassification rates, lower precision of

246

switching cases would entail loss of true cases (switched to controls by PheLEx) along with

247

misclassified cases in corrected phenotype, reducing PheLEx’s ability to recover true disease-

248

associated SNPs.

263
264

Importantly, we were also able to identify novel SNPs defined as disease-associated SNPs that

265

were not statistically significant for either the simulated true phenotypes (no misclassification) or

266

misclassified phenotypes but were statistically significant for PheLEx corrected phenotypes (Figs

267

3B and 3C), where these novel discoveries were not accompanied by recovery of large numbers

268

of false positives (Fig 3D). Given the modest false positives comparable to those already found in

269

misclassified phenotypes and improvement in discovery of statistically significant disease-

270

associated SNPs, these results indicate PheLEx is a viable approach for making new discoveries

271

in existing GWAS datasets.

272
273

Finding novel associations in real GWAS datasets

274

PheLEx was applied to UK Biobank GWAS datasets for epilepsy and bipolar disorder to extract

275

misclassification probabilities for the phenotype cases. Using a threshold, misclassified cases were

276

identified for each phenotype and their respective phenotypes were switched from case to control,

277

resulting in corrected phenotypes. Using these corrected phenotypes, we performed association

278

analysis to investigate the genetic associations with the new phenotype. In both analyses, we

279

observed improvement in statistical power of association analysis and identification of novel loci

280

in GWAS.

285

“corrected” epilepsy phenotype. GWAS was performed on original epilepsy phenotype of dataset

286

and corrected epilepsy phenotype was produced by PheLEx to compare results (Fig 4). Results of

287

the original analysis were similar to that produced previously for this dataset[87] with no

288

statistically significant SNPs according to Bonferroni-corrected p-value threshold. However, after

289

correction of phenotype an overall improvement in statistical significance of SNPs can be

290

observed. Apart from training SNPs, SNPs not used in training also gained statistical significance

291

at a Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value < 0.1. By computing the r2 measure of linkage

292

disequilibrium (LD) amongst these candidate SNPs and training SNPs (Fig 5), we were able to

293

extract three interesting candidate SNPs not in LD with training SNPs that gained statistical

294

significance (Table 1). Even though most SNPs underwent relatively small changes in their p-

295

values (in either direction), the three candidate SNPs experienced a significant boost from their

296

original p-values indicating the potential of PheLEx to discover new loci. These candidates

297

included SNP in gene PRUNE2 (MIM: 610691) that has been significantly associated in an

298

independent GWAS for hippocampal atrophy[88] linked to epilepsy [89, 90], and has also been

299

associated with other neurological phenotypes in GWAS for mental retardation and Alzheimer’s

300

disease[88, 91]. The closest genes near two other candidate SNPs include ERCC6 which is an

301

epilepsy-related gene[92] and OR2S2, which has not been previously linked to epilepsy. When

302

looking at SNPs in LD with candidate SNP rs12379440 (SNP in OR2S2), these include SNPs in

303

genes AK3 (MIM: 609290), DIRAS2 (MIM: 607863), NTRK2 (MIM: 600456), MAMDC2 (MIM:

in literature[106-108], where in particular, effect sizes were selected to ensure genotype-specific

398

disease odds ratio remained realistic (in the range: 1-3)[83-85] (S3 Fig). For each simulated true

399

disease phenotype Y’, differential misclassification was introduced at varying degrees by switching

400

a fraction of randomly selected controls to cases. The fraction of controls switched to cases varied

401

from 5%, 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% representing increasing rates of misclassification in “observed

402

phenotype” denoted as Y. Resulting datasets consisted of 100 datasets for each misclassification

403

rate simulated with mixed effects of genetic relatedness/population structure. We note that this

404

configuration of simulated GWAS datasets is in stark contrast to simulated data analyzed

405

previously[49, 77], where 150 out of 1000 simulated SNPs were associated with true disease

406

phenotype with maximum genotype-specific disease odds-ratio in range 4-10 in each dataset.

420

described above with the exception of MAF threshold which was replaced with a more

421

conservative threshold of 10-3. Additionally, all genotypes in linkage disequilibrium (LD) were

422

pruned from the dataset using PLINK[23] with specific parameters (flag: --indep-pairwise,

423

window size: 50kb, step size: 5, r2 threshold: 0.20). This resulted in 287,425 SNPs in the UK

424

Biobank dataset which was then divided into datasets for epilepsy and bipolar disorder phenotypes

425

based on diagnosis record. Cases were selected based on diagnosis records where any individual

426

containing diagnosis code for phenotype was labeled a case (bipolar disorder code: 1291 and

427

epilepsy code: 1264). For epilepsy, 3,620 cases were identified and an equal number of controls

428

(n = 3,620) were randomly selected from a pool of individuals who did not have epilepsy as their

429

diagnosis in the UK Biobank dataset. For bipolar disorder, 1,177 cases were identified and twice

430

the number of controls (n = 2,354) were randomly selected from a pool of individuals who did not

431

have bipolar disorder as their diagnosis in the UK Biobank dataset. Distribution of phenotypes and

432

sex within these datasets is described in S1 Table.

Misclassification analysis of simulated and cases studies datasets

435

For application of misclassification extraction methods (detailed below) on simulation datasets,

436

we filtered out potentially uninformative SNPs using their respective p-values from standard

437

GWAS analysis using Bonferroni-corrected p-value threshold as cut-off. For all methods, resulting

438

input genotypes matrix (training SNPs) contained SNPs that passed Bonferroni corrected genome-

439

wide threshold for the dataset. Additionally, only PheLEx was applied to epilepsy and bipolar

440

disorder datasets to identify potentially misclassified samples. For both real phenotypes,

441

association analysis failed to produce any statistically significant SNPs using Bonferroni-corrected

442

threshold. We selected a threshold (-log10(p-value) > 4.5) as a heuristic to filter training SNPs used

Misclassification model

448

In absence of misclassification in phenotype, relationship between genotypes matrix X (composed

449

of j SNPs) and observed phenotype Y (for n individuals) can be stated as,

450
𝑃𝑟(𝑌|𝛽, 𝑢) ∝ ∏𝑛𝑖=1 𝜎(𝛽, 𝑢)𝑌𝑖 (1 − 𝜎(𝛽, 𝑢))(1−𝑌𝑖 )

451
452

where

453

Y = [Y1,…,Yn]

454

X = [Xi|…|Xj] where Xj is a genotypes vector for SNP j

455

( , u) is function of SNP effects and random effects

456
457

In presence of misclassification, the relationship between X and Y can be modeled using

458

hierarchical Bayesian latent variable model (Fig 1A). Here X and Y are intermediated through (i)

459

latent variable representing true phenotype Y’, (ii) false-positive rate in phenotype () representing

460

rate of true controls recorded as cases, and (iii) true-positive rate in phenotype () representing

461

rate of true cases recorded as cases. Hence, the relationship between genotypes X and true

462

phenotype Y’ can be stated as:

463
464

𝑃𝑟(𝑌′|𝛽, 𝑢) ∝ ∏𝑛𝑖=1 𝜎(𝛽, 𝑢)𝑌𝑖 ′ (1 − 𝜎(𝛽, 𝑢))(1−𝑌𝑖 ′)

466

Resulting likelihood of observing the data (X and Y) given unknown parameters is:

467
468

𝑃𝑟(𝑌|𝑌 ′ , 𝛼, 𝜆, 𝛽, 𝑢) ∝ Pr(𝑌|𝜆, 𝑌 ′ = 0) Pr(𝑌 ′ = 0|𝛽, 𝑢) + Pr(𝑌|𝛼, 𝑌 ′ = 1) Pr(𝑌 ′ = 1|𝛽, 𝑢)

469
470

Pr(𝑌|𝑌′, 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝑢) ∝ ∏𝑛𝑖=1[𝜆 (1 − 𝜎(𝛽, 𝑢)) + 𝛼(𝜎(𝛽, 𝑢))]𝑌𝑖 [(1 − 𝜆) (1 − 𝜎(𝛽, 𝑢)) + (1 −

471

𝛼) (𝜎(𝛽, 𝑢))](1−𝑌𝑖 )

472
473

Hence, posterior probability of the model is:

474
475

Pr(𝑌′, 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝑢|𝑌) ∝ ∏𝑛𝑖=1[𝜆(1 − 𝜎(𝛽, 𝑢)) + 𝛼 𝜎(𝛽, 𝑢)]𝑌𝑖. [(1 − 𝜆)(1 − 𝜎(𝛽, 𝑢)) + (1 −

PheLEx Algorithm

478

PheLEx follows a computational framework detailed in Fig 1B. PheLEx takes a subset of GWAS

479

genotypes dataset X as input (training SNPs) containing SNPs based on the statistical significance

480

of association with phenotype of interest. Other inputs for PheLEx include observed phenotype Y

481

and genetic relatedness matrix A. Given these inputs, PheLEx employs Adaptive Metropolis-

482

Hastings within Gibbs Sampling to estimate model parameters. Parameters ( ,  and  ) are

For simulations and real data, prior probabilities on parameters are defined as Pr( ) ~ Beta(10, 1),

518

Pr() ~ Beta(1, 1), Pr( ) ~ N(1, 5) with flat prior on variance parameter u2 as suggested by[111,

519

112]. Variance for jumping distribution of effect sizes was adjusted across iterations to maintain

520

acceptance ratio for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains around 0.2 using established

521

methods defined previously[113]. Acceptance rate of 0.2 was used[114] and the algorithm was run

522

on each dataset for 100,000 iterations with a burn-in of 20,000 iterations. At each iteration,

523

estimates for each parameter ( , ,  and u) were used to calculate misclassification probability

524

for each sample, which in turn was used to compute whether each sample was misclassified.

525
526

Using a defined threshold on estimated misclassification probabilities, potentially misclassified

527

cases were identified for simulations and real datasets. Precision, recall and other operating

528

characteristics were calculated for misclassified cases identified by PheLEx in simulations and

529

compared to performance of other algorithms described below. Misclassified cases found in

530

simulations and real datasets were further used to create corrected phenotypes by switching

531

phenotype of misclassified cases from case to control. Association analysis was performed with

532

corrected phenotypes from simulations and used to estimate impact on GWAS discovery. For real

533

datasets, association analysis was performed with corrected phenotypes where SNPs differentially

534

significant in analysis with corrected phenotype versus original disease phenotype were

535

investigated for biological significance as described below.

536
537

Other misclassification algorithms

538

In addition to PheLEx, we designed two additional algorithms to provide a fair comparison

539

between PheLEx and existing methods proposed by Rekaya[49, 73, 77]. PheLEx-m (PheLEx -

540

/minus mixed model) was designed to exclude the mixed model component of PheLEx.

541

Comparison between PheLEx-m and Rekaya is used to determine improvement due to use of an

542

Adaptive Metropolis-Hastings within Gibbs (used in PheLEx) over Gibbs Sampling algorithm

543

(used in Rekaya). PheLEx-mh (PheLEx -/minus Metropolis-Hastings) was designed to replace the

544

MCMC algorithm in PheLEx with Gibbs Sampling (as used in Rekaya), however, with the mixed

545

model present as implemented in PheLEx. Comparison between Rekaya and PheLEx-mh provide

546

insight into improvement due to accounting for mixed effects due to population structure and

547

genetic relatedness as suggested by the PheLEx framework. Implementation steps for PheLEx-m,

548

PheLEx-mh and Rekaya’s method[77] are described in S2 Text.

Genome-wide association analysis

551

The following procedure was used to produce inputs for analysis of simulations and real case

552

studies. Standard association analysis was applied using a low-rank linear mixed model as

553

implemented in R package lrgpr[115], where for simulations no additional covariates were used

554

in association analysis whereas for epilepsy and bipolar disorder datasets, GWAS was performed

555

using sex (Male/Female) as an additional fixed covariate in the association model. The function

556

used for association analysis was lrgprApply, which uses cross-validation and model selection

557

criteria to estimate a low-rank genetic similarity matrix to be used in association analysis[115].

558

This analysis was similar to those performed previously for UK Biobank phenotypes[87],

559

however, some covariates (e.g. age, batch) previously included[87] were removed from our

560

analysis based on little improvement to quality of Quantile-Quantile plots and GWAS results (S4

561

Fig).

562
563

Identifying misclassified samples in phenotype

564

In simulations, each algorithm (PheLEx, PheLEx-m, PheLEx-mh and Rekaya) produced a matrix

565

of misclassification indicators using estimated misclassification probability for cases and controls

566

computed at each iteration. The rows in the matrix represented samples and columns represented

567

each iteration, where value 1 for any sample at any iteration indicated sample is misclassified (or

568

0 otherwise) according to parameter estimates at that iteration. Average misclassification

569

probability for each sample was computed by dividing sums of each row by total iterations.

570

Misclassified individuals were identified by using a defined threshold as cut-off on average

571

misclassification probability (p) computed for each individual where if p is greater than threshold,

572

the individual is determined to be misclassified. For simulations, threshold was defined as below

573

as defined previously [77]:

574
575

𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑 = 𝜇𝑝 + 2𝜎𝑝

576

where p = vector of average misclassification probabilities of all cases, p = mean of average

577

misclassification probabilities for all cases, and p = standard deviation of average

578

misclassification probabilities for all cases. Corrected phenotype in each simulated dataset was

579

computed by switching phenotype of misclassified individuals identified as above from cases to

580

controls.

581
582

For epilepsy and bipolar disorder datasets, ten sets of average misclassification probabilities were

583

computed using PheLEx. For bipolar disorder, average misclassification probabilities computed

584

showed a natural clustering and all samples with average misclassification probability > 0.5 across

585

PheLEx runs were considered to be misclassified. For epilepsy, as estimated misclassification

586

probabilities lacked natural clustering and were more dispersed, a more stringent criterion was

587

applied with samples having average misclassification probability > 0.7 across at least two sets of

588

PheLEx runs were identified as misclassified. A potential reason for dispersal could be the

589

heterogeneous nature of epilepsy resulting in broad spread of misclassification probabilities. For

590

both epilepsy and bipolar disorder datasets, phenotypes for samples identified as misclassified

591

were switched from cases to controls to compute corrected phenotypes.

592
593

Performance calculations

594

Performance for simulations was measured by each method’s ability to identify misclassified

595

cases. Using misclassification probabilities computed over 100 simulated datasets at each

596

misclassification level (5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%), performance metrics such as recall/true-

597

positive rates, false-positive rates, and precision were calculated for each method (PheLEx,

598

PheLEx-m, PheLEx-mh and Rekaya). For decreasing threshold values in range 0.0-1.0, cases with

599

misclassification probability higher than threshold were marked as misclassified by the method.

600

Recall/true-positive rate was calculated as the fraction of correctly identified misclassified cases

601

out of all misclassified cases in the dataset and false-positive rate was calculated as fraction of true

602

cases labeled as misclassified out of all true cases. Precision was calculated as the fraction of

603

correctly identified misclassified cases in the set of misclassified cases marked by each method.

604

For visualization of Precision-Recall curves, mean precision across 100 simulations at each recall

605

value was calculated per method. Similarly, for Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves

606

mean true-positive rate across 100 simulations at each false-positive rate value was calculated per

607

method. Area under curve for Precision-Recall curves and ROC curves were computed by

608

calculating the area under all 100 Precision-Recall and ROC curves across misclassification levels

609

for each method respectively.

610
611

Measuring impact on GWAS discovery potential for simulations

612

To assess impact of PheLEx’s correction of phenotypes on GWAS discovery potential, recovery

613

of disease-associated SNPs was calculated for simulations with genetic relatedness/population

614

structure. For each simulated true phenotype, association analysis was performed before and after

615

misclassification analysis. Disease-associated SNPs statistically significant in GWAS with

616

simulated true phenotype (no misclassification) and misclassified phenotype were determined

617

(according to Bonferroni-corrected p-value threshold). PheLEx was applied on simulated datasets

618

and misclassification probabilities were computed for each phenotype. Using misclassification

619

probabilities and methodology for identifying misclassified samples (described above), corrected

620

phenotypes were produced for each dataset and association analysis was performed using these

621

PheLEx corrected phenotypes to determine disease-associated SNPs that are statistically

622

significant in GWAS with corrected phenotype. Ratios of total disease-associated SNPs significant

623

in misclassified phenotypes versus true phenotypes (no misclassification) and those significant in

624

corrected phenotypes versus true phenotypes (no misclassification) were computed at each

625

misclassification rate to show recovery of disease-associated SNPs across simulations. At any

626

misclassification rate, an increased ratio produced by corrected phenotype as compared to that

627

produced by misclassified phenotype indicates potential of PheLEx to recover associated SNPs.

628
629

In simulations, true positive SNPs were defined as all disease-associated SNPs for the simulated

630

true phenotype (no misclassification). True positive SNPs gained were defined as true disease-

631

associated SNPs that were significant (according to Bonferroni-corrected p-value threshold in

632

association analysis) in the true phenotype (no misclassification) that: (i) were not statistically

633

significant for the misclassified phenotype, (ii) were not used as input for PheLEx, and (iii) were

634

statistically significant in PheLEx corrected phenotypes. Novel true positive SNPs were defined

635

as disease-associated SNPs that were not statistically significant for the true phenotype (no

636

misclassification) or misclassified phenotype (at any misclassification rate) but were statistically

637

significant in association analysis with PheLEx corrected phenotypes.

638
639

Measuring impact on GWAS discovery potential for case studies

640

For epilepsy and bipolar disorder datasets, PheLEx was applied on these datasets to estimate

641

misclassification probabilities and compute corrected phenotypes. P-values produced from

642

association analysis of corrected phenotype were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg

643

procedure. SNPs that passed statistical significance threshold (adjusted p-value < 0.1) were

644

identified and the r2 measure of LD was computed between these SNPs and those used for training

645

PheLEx (training SNPs). All non-training SNPs where r2 < 0.1 with training SNPs and adjusted p-

646

value < 0.1 in GWAS with the corrected phenotypes were considered ‘recovered’. Annotations for

Discussion

650

PheLEx provides two advances when considering existing methodologies[49, 73, 77] available for

651

Bayesian misclassification analysis in GWAS: (i) PheLEx has significantly improved performance

652

for identifying misclassified phenotypes when considering allelic effect sizes in a realistic range

653

observed in GWAS and (ii) PheLEx provides a novel method for identifying new disease loci

654

associations not detectable with a standard GWAS analysis. In addition, PheLEx is a complete

655

framework that includes components that have been presented as distinct models and/or associated

656

algorithms in the literature (i.e. differential misclassification in cases versus controls[77, 116, 117],

657

considerations of Adaptive Metropolis-Hastings[113] and an underlying mixed model for

658

Bayesian inference using Gibbs sampling[110, 111]). The complete PheLEx framework includes

659

the capability to account for differential misclassification (i.e., different rates of misclassification

660

in cases versus controls) while accounting for mixed effects due to genetic relatedness and

661

population structure, a combination which is essential for GWAS analysis. We also provide an R

662

package phelex to allow application of the entire PheLEx framework for GWAS analysis (see Web

663

Resources).

664
665

When considering the application of PheLEx in extracting misclassification, there are two

666

components of the PheLEx framework that lead to significant improvements in overall

667

performance compared to existing methods[49, 73, 77] in datasets simulated with realistic

668

genotype-specific odds ratios[83, 84, 103]. First, PheLEx includes an Adaptive Metropolis-

31

669

Hastings step within Gibbs sampling that improves posterior sampling resulting in improved

670

performance (Fig 2, S1 and S5 Figs). Second, the PheLEx framework uses filtered genotypes as

671

input to filter out SNPs that have a high probability of being uninformative for learning which

672

phenotypes are misclassified, where using more extreme p-value thresholds to prune SNPs

673

increases the likelihood of training PheLEx on informative SNPs that will accurately point to the

674

misclassified samples. This filtering approach not only provides dramatic savings in terms of

675

computational expense (S6 Fig) but also improves the accuracy of misclassification estimate rates

676

when considering realistic disease allele effect sizes (S5 and S7 Figs). Given existing methods[49,

677

73, 77] do not have acceptable levels of performance for misclassification analysis unless

678

unrealistic allelic effect sizes are considered, PheLEx represents the first Bayesian

679

misclassification that is viable for misclassification analysis for real GWAS.

680
681

The novel methodology advance in PheLEx is the use of misclassified phenotypes to re-analyze

682

GWAS data to identify new associated loci. The joint assumptions justifying this approach are

683

that: (i) there is at least one alternative labeling of case and control phenotypes in a GWAS (i.e.,

684

there are misclassified phenotypes) that are accurately and reproducibly reflecting the impact of

685

alleles and, (ii) that observed genotype associations are strong enough such that there is a

686

reasonable probability of correctly recovering these misclassified phenotypes. Clearly, these

687

assumptions will not always be justified, such that application of this methodology should be

688

applied judiciously (e.g., disease phenotypes known to be problematic to measure but where there

689

are reasonably sized genotype associations) and new discoveries using this application of PheLEx

690

should also be treated with caution. However, as demonstrated by epilepsy and bipolar disorder

691

phenotypes, new reasonable candidate loci can be recovered with this approach. Additionally, as

32

692

shown with epilepsy, this approach may also produce validation evidence for candidates identified

693

in other studies.

694
695

Considered more broadly, the PheLEx framework is addressing a specific problem of

696

misclassification of disease phenotypes in GWAS that is really a function of the overlapping issues

697

of measurement error and incomplete understanding of disease etiology. These can manifest in a

698

number of ways, including misclassification due to: (i) disease similarity and inaccurately

699

measured current diagnosis protocols[57, 58, 118], and (ii) heterogeneous diseases or disease

700

complexes defined as the “same” disease with a single diagnosis protocol[119-122]. The PheLEx

701

framework we introduce is agnostic to the cause of misclassification and rather assumes that the

702

underlying genetics can be leveraged to provide an accurate assessment of misclassification,

703

regardless of cause, and is of value whether used purely for misclassification or for identifying

704

novel associations. For misclassification, there is clear value in identifying healthy individuals

705

who were misdiagnosed such that PheLEx presents an opportunity to identify “false cases” and

706

investigate basis of their misclassification, which may relate to diagnosis error, disease subtypes

707

or differential patterns in diagnostic measurements. Since considering a mixture of diseases with

708

different genetics or a disease phenotype with high heterogeneity may impede extraction of

709

disease-associated loci within a GWAS[50], PheLEx can quickly identify cases in the study that

710

are inconsistent based on underlying disease-associated SNPs, and by defining more tractable

711

GWAS phenotypes, boost the power of association analysis to allow users to identify new loci of

712

interest. PheLEx therefore has promise as a novel analysis methodology for identifying candidate

713

loci in GWAS that can be applied not only to new GWAS but also to re-analyze existing GWAS

714

data.
