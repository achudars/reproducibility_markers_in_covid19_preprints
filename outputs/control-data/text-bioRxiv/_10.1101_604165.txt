VISUAL ENHANCEMENT OF THE MMNm AND AUDITORY SENSITIVITY
24

Abstract

25

Multisensory processing facilitates perception of our everyday environment and

2

26

becomes particularly important when sensory information is degraded or close to the

27

discrimination threshold. Here, we used magnetoencephalography and an audiovisual oddball

28

paradigm to assess the complementary role of visual information in subtle pitch

29

discrimination at the neural level of participants with varying levels of pitch discrimination

30

abilities, i.e., musicians and nonmusicians. The amplitude of the auditory mismatch

31

negativity (MMNm) served as an index of sensitivity. The gain in amplitude resulting from

32

compatible audiovisual information was larger in participants whose MMNm amplitude was

33

smaller in the condition deviating only in the auditory dimension, in accordance with the

34

multisensory principle of inverse effectiveness. These findings show that discrimination of

35

even a sensory-specific feature as pitch is facilitated by multisensory information at a pre-

36

attentive level, and they highlight the importance of considering inter-individual differences

37

in uni-sensory abilities when assessing multisensory processing.

VISUAL ENHANCEMENT OF THE MMNm AND AUDITORY SENSITIVITY
42

Poorer auditory sensitivity is related to stronger visual enhancement of the auditory

43

mismatch negativity (MMNm)

44

3

Because the world is multimodal, everyday perception relies on the complementary

45

roles of simultaneously active sensory systems. Contemporary brain science focuses

46

increasingly on the principles underlying cortical connectivity (Friston, 2005), and the notion

47

that multisensory processing in the brain only occurs after extensive processing in strictly

48

sensory-specific cortical areas (Felleman & Van Essen, 1991) has been challenged in the past

49

decades (for a classic review, see Ghazanfar & Schroeder, 2006), where an increasing

50

number of studies have shown crossmodal influences on processing in primary sensory areas

51

such as the auditory cortex (Atilgan et al., 2018; Brosch, Selezneva, & Scheich, 2005; Jäncke,

52

Rogenmoser, Meyer, & Elmer, 2012; van Wassenhove & Grzeczkowski, 2015).

53

The mismatch negativity (MMN) and its magnetic counterpart MMNm (also termed

54

mismatch field or mismatch response), is used to probe pre-attentive levels of unisensory

55

auditory processing (Näätänen, Paavilainen, Rinne, & Alho, 2007). It is a robust measure

56

derived from the event-related potential (ERP) / event-related field (ERF), which can be

57

elicited in the auditory cortex in response to deviants in a repetitive train of auditory tones,

58

and it is regarded as an index of various auditory functions, including neural sound

59

discrimination and sensitivity (Näätänen, 2008). The amplitude of the MMN is positively

60

correlated with the magnitude of the deviant (Jaramillo, Paavilainen, & Näätänen, 2000;

61

Sams, Paavilainen, Alho, & Näätänen, 1985) as well as with behavioral performance

62

(Amenedo & Escera, 2000; Jaramillo et al., 2000; Novitski, Tervaniemi, Huotilainen, &

63

Näätänen, 2004; Tervaniemi, Just, Koelsch, Widmann, & Schroger, 2005), which makes the

64

MMN paradigm a useful method to assess perceptually relevant neural sensitivity to subtle

65

changes in an auditory stimulus material.

Nonetheless, MMN/MMNm elicitation is not restricted to unisensory auditory

67

processing as strong audiovisual illusions may also elicit an MMN/MMNm in the auditory

68

cortex. A long tradition of scientific studies has used crossmodal perceptual illusions to

69

elucidate the importance and the consequences of the spontaneous cooperation between the

70

sensory modalities at behavioral (McGurk & MacDonald, 1976; Sekuler, 1997; Shams, Ma,

71

& Beierholm, 2005) and neural levels (Bonath et al., 2007; Colin, Radeau, Soquet, Dachy, &

72

Deltenre, 2002; Colin, Radeau, Soquet, Demolin, et al., 2002; Möttönen, Krause, Tiippana, &

73

Sams, 2002; Saint-Amour, De Sanctis, Molholm, Ritter, & Foxe, 2007; Sams et al., 1991; for

74

review, see Alais, Newell, & Mamassian, 2010).

75

For instance, in the McGurk effect (McGurk & MacDonald, 1976), a mismatch

76

between visual (ga-ga) and auditory (ba-ba) speech phonemes most often results in a

77

perceptual experience of a syllable (da-da) which is not a veridical representation of either of

78

the sensory constituents. In a pioneering magnetoencephalography (MEG) study, Sams et al.

79

(1991) used the McGurk effect to show visual modulation of mismatch responses elicited in

80

the auditory cortex in response to deviant perception of identical sounds. Kislyuk, Möttönen,

81

and Sams (2008) complemented the study by Sams et al (1991) by showing that the MMN

82

elicited in response to deviant speech sounds (‘ba’ in a train consisting of ‘va’) may be

83

suppressed by simultaneous presentation of incongruent visual (‘va’) information. Notably, in

84

both of these experiments, the auditory stimuli were kept constant but generated different

85

mismatch responses across conditions. This highlights the link between MMN elicitation and

86

perceptual experience over and above physical properties of the auditory stimuli.

87

A number of studies have assessed the relevance of congruent visual information to

88

non-illusory speech processing in the auditory cortex, (Calvert et al., 1999; Möttönen,

89

Schürmann, & Sams, 2004; Okada, Venezia, Matchin, Saberi, & Hickok, 2013; Pekkola et

90

al., 2005; Smith et al., 2013). Comparatively less is known about crossmodal influences on

91

cortical processing of more basic auditory features such as pitch. This is noteworthy

92

considering the longstanding and recently intensified scientific interest in crossmodal

93

correspondences between auditory pitch and visual features such as brightness (Klapetek,

94

Ngo, & Spence, 2012; Marks, 1987), lightness (Melara, 1989; Melara & O’Brien, 1987),

95

angularity (Marks, 1987; Walker, 2012), size (Evans & Treisman, 2010; Gallace & Spence,

96

2006), and vertical position (Bernstein & Edelstein, 1971; Deroy & Spence, 2016; Melara &

97

O’Brien, 1987; Møller et al., 2018; Orchard-Mills, Van der Burg, & Alais, 2015; Parise,

98

Knorre, & Ernst, 2014; Pratt, 1930; see also Spence, 2011). In a series of studies, Besle and

99

colleagues used electroencephalography (EEG) (Besle et al., 2007; Besle, Fort, & Giard,

5

100

2005; Besle, Hussain, Giard, & Bertrand, 2013) and MEG (Besle et al., 2007) to study visual

101

influences on the MMN(m) elicited in response to salient pitch changes. These studies

102

indicated that visual stimuli have access to the processes in the auditory cortex that underlie

103

the generation of MMN(m) responses elicited to non-speech and non-illusory stimuli,

104

specifically salient pitch changes. If that is the case, then visually induced behavioral

105

facilitation of subtle pitch discrimination should also be evident at the pre-attentive stage of

106

processing probed by the MMNm.

107

We recently conducted an audiovisual behavioral experiment that capitalized on the

108

inter-individual variability that characterizes pitch discrimination. We showed that the size of

109

visually induced gain in subtle pitch discrimination at the behavioral level is inversely related

110

to participants’ musical aptitude and auditory pitch discrimination skills as measured by

111

unisensory tools (Møller et al., 2018). This finding is consistent with an inter-individual

112

interpretation of the multisensory principle of inverse effectiveness (PoIE) according to

113

which, multisensory integration is maximal when responses to the unisensory dimensions of

114

the multisensory event are weak (Stein & Meredith, 1993). The functional relevance of this

115

principle is obvious: when a unisensory dimension of a multisensory event is hardly

116

detectable, verification through other sensory modalities is essential. Notably, previous work

117

in support of PoIE at behavioral and neural levels assessed intra-individual effects, i.e., by

118

comparing group-averaged responses to varying levels of stimulus salience (Senkowski,

119

Saint-Amour, Hofle, & Foxe, 2011). In our behavioral study, we also found a significant

120

congruence effect, i.e., participants performed better when crossmodally matching than

121

mismatching visual cues were presented simultaneously with target pitch deviants. The

122

question remains whether a similar inter-individual interpretation of the PoIE and the

123

congruence effect are evident at the pre-attentive stage of pitch processing probed by the

124

MMNm or whether later levels of processing (e.g., semantic or decisional processes) are

125

exclusively responsible for the pattern of behavioral benefits observed.

126

Consequently, in the present MEG study we asked whether the visual dimension of

127

audiovisual stimuli could modulate the MMNm elicited in the auditory cortex in response to

128

identical subtle pitch changes, and if so whether the size of the visual modulation depends on

129

the degree of unisensory expertise at the level of the individual. This focus necessitated

130

recruitment of participants spanning a wide range of pitch discrimination abilities. Motivated

131

by previous studies that have shown enhanced MMN amplitudes in musicians compared to

132

nonmusicians (Tervaniemi et al., 2005; Vuust, Brattico, Seppanen, Naatanen, & Tervaniemi,

133

2012), a subgroup of musicians were added to the participant pool.

134

We modified the audiovisual oddball paradigm used in the previous behavioral study,

135

allowing us to quantify visually induced gain at the neural level by comparing the amplitude

136

of MMNm responses elicited to deviants differing from the standards in the auditory

137

dimension (pitch), the visual dimension (vertical position), or both dimensions. Notably,

138

when both dimensions varied, they did so in the same or opposite directions of each other,

139

according to the crossmodal correspondence between a high pitch and a high vertical position

140

(Spence, 2011), as this allowed us to assess the effect of crossmodal congruence on pre-

141

attentive pitch processing. To testify to the applicability in the present study of the MMNm

142

amplitude as an index of neural pitch discrimination sensitivity, we also compared individual

143

measures of MMNm amplitude in all conditions against behavioral measures of pitch

144

discrimination thresholds and of musical aptitude.

145

These steps were taken towards the main goal of the study, which was to assess inter-

146

individual differences in audiovisual pitch processing. We tested the specific hypothesis that

147

larger visually induced MMNm enhancements would be present in participants with smaller

148

MMNm responses elicited to auditory-only pitch deviants, (i.e., deviants presented without

149

any complementary visual information). This would be consistent with an inter-individual

150

interpretation of the PoIE and with our previously reported behavioral results (Møller et al.,

151

2018), and it would highlight the need for taking individual differences in unisensory neural

152

sensitivity into accout when assesing multisensory processing.

stimuli had an effect on the size of the MMNm enhancement, as there was no significant

Visually induced enhancements and unisensory skills

195

Visually induced MMNm-enhancement was defined as the difference in MMNm amplitude

196

elicited by AVsame compared to Adev stimuli, henceforth denoted MMNm. Behaviorally

197

measured pitch discrimination thresholds did not predict MMNm, neither in the left

198

hemisphere, r = -.237, 95% CI [-.453, .067], nor in the right hemisphere, r = -.047, 95% ,

199

95% CI [-.258, .364], as assessed with Pearson correlation analyses with bootstrapped bias-

200

corrected and accelerated (BCa) 95% confidence intervals (5000 samples). However, the

201

amplitude of MMNm responses elicited to Adev stimuli were statistically significantly

202

inversely related to MMNm, i.e., larger Adev amplitude was associated with smaller

203

MMNm, r = -.397, 95% CI [-.595, -.194], in the right hemisphere. See scatterplots in Figure

204

2. Although no such statistically significantly association was found in the left hemisphere, r

205

= -.183, 95% CI [-.399, .051], the correlation was significant when responses of the left and

right hemisphere were averaged, (see supplementary materials, Figure S6).

Behavioral correlates to MMNm amplitude

214

Bootstrapped Pearson’s correlation analyses were run to examine the relationship between

215

MMNm amplitude and behavioral scores obtained in the Musical Ear Test (MET) (Wallentin,

216

Nielsen, Friis-Olivarius, Vuust, & Vuust, 2010) and the pitch discrimination threshold (PDT)

217

estimation. Statistical significance was assessed at α = .05. PDT data points were

218

nonnormally distributed and hence log-transformed using the natural logarithm. Left-

219

hemisphere MMNm amplitudes in response to all four experimental conditions were

220

significantly correlated with PDT and with MET(melodic) scores, i.e., larger MMNm

221

amplitudes were associated with lower (i.e., better) pitch discrimination thresholds and with

222

better performance on the MET, testifying to the applicability in the present study of the

223

MMNm amplitude as an index of neural pitch discrimination sensitivity. No significant

224

associations were found between behavioral measures and MMNm amplitudes elicited in the

225

right hemisphere. See Figure 3 for scatterplots and Table 2 for correlation coefficients and

226

bootstrapped bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) 95% confidence intervals. A Pearson

227

product-moment correlation analysis showed that MET and PDT scores were also

228

significantly correlated (r = -.528, p <.001), reflecting the association between musical skills

229

and auditory sensitivity.

Discussion
This study was designed to assess inter-individual differences in visually induced

245

enhancements of subtle pitch discrimination at the pre-attentive stage of perceptual

246

processing. Across all participants (musicians and nonmusicians), the amplitude of the

247

MMNm recorded using MEG was significantly enhanced in conditions containing

248

audiovisual deviants (AVsame and AVopp) compared to a condition in which only the

249

auditory dimension of the audiovisual stimuli deviated (Adev). In the right hemisphere, the

250

size of this enhancement was significantly correlated with the amplitude measured in the

251

Adev condition, indicating that the visual dimension of audiovisual events has a larger impact

252

on pre-attentive pitch discrimination in the auditory cortices of people with lower auditory-

253

only pitch discrimination sensitivity. This result is consistent with an inter-individual

254

interpretation of the principle of inverse effectiveness (PoIE) and suggests not only that

255

individual differences in multisensory processing exist, but also that they may be explained in

256

part by individual differences in unisensory sensitivity.

257

Our study contributes to the literature showing that processes occurring early in

258

sensory-specific cortices can be modulated by crossmodal information (see also Bulkin &

259

Groh, 2006; Driver & Noesselt, 2008; Ghazanfar & Schroeder, 2006). We focused

260

specifically on visually induced enhancements of pitch discrimination in the auditory cortex.

261

It is important to note that perceptual enhancement is but one of several possible outcomes of

262

multisensory integration (Driver & Noesselt, 2008) and also that the MMN(m) has been

263

interpreted specifically as indexing the ability of the brain to detect incongruent relations

264

between auditory and visual stimuli, i.e., as an incongruency response (Paraskevopoulos,

265

Kuchenbuch, Herholz, & Pantev, 2012 b). Our interpretation of the MMNm as an index of

266

perceptual sensitivity rather than an incongruency response rests on previous studies showing

267

that the MMN is related to behavioral performance in tasks that employ similar sounds

268

(Jaramillo et al., 2000; Novitski et al., 2004) and in groups of participants with different

269

levels of auditory abilities, i.e., musicians and nonmusicians (Tervaniemi et al., 2005). This is

270

also confirmed in our data where the correlations between MMNm amplitudes and behavioral

271

measures of pitch discrimination abilities and musical aptitude testify to the applicability of

272

the MMNm amplitude as an index of pre-attentive neural pitch discrimination.

273

Group-level results

274

Visually induced MMNm enhancement was evident in all conditions of the experimental

275

paradigm in which the visual dimension of the audiovisual event deviated (AVsame, AVopp,

276

Vdev) compared to the condition in which it did not (Adev). Our primary interest was the

277

assessment of the difference in MMNm amplitude elicited by AVsame compared to Adev

278

stimuli, i.e., MMNm. This was the most important outcome variable as the key objective of

279

the study was to assess whether this reliance followed the PoIE at the inter-individual scale,

280

i.e., varied with varying levels of auditory-only pitch discrimination abilities. At the group

281

level, this difference was highly significant in both hemispheres, consistent with the notion

282

that visual information not only induces a qualitatively different perceptual experience and

283

hence elicits an MMNm (Möttönen et al., 2002; Saint-Amour et al., 2007; Sams et al., 1991),

284

but that it also modulates the size of the MMNm (Besle et al., 2013) elicited to identical

285

auditory deviants. A discussion of the individual-level results will follow after further

286

considerations of the group-level results.

287

The comparison between AVsame and AVopp constitutes what we have previously

288

referred to as the crossmodal congruence effect (Møller et al., 2018). Note, that we used the

289

feature-based crossmodal correspondence between auditory pitch and visually perceived

290

vertical position because we sought to maximize the likelihood that the visual stimuli would

291

be beneficial. In this perspective, the disentanglement of two kinds of facilitatory effects

292

(i.e.,MMNm and congruence effect) was not as much an aim as a by-product of the

VISUAL ENHANCEMENT OF THE MMNm AND AUDITORY SENSITIVITY

16

293

paradigm, caused by the polarity inherent in the audiovisual stimuli, where the polar

294

dimensions of auditory pitch and visually perceived vertical position map onto each other.

295

From this also follows that we refer to crossmodal congruence in relative terms, in contrast to

296

studies that conceptualize audiovisual congruence in absolute terms, i.e., violations of

297

absolute distances in the same direction are defined as audiovisual incongruence (Nichols &

298

Grahn, 2016) or no change in the visual dimension (comparable to our Adev) is considered an

299

incongruent trial(Paraskevopoulos, Kuchenbuch, Herholz, & Pantev, 2012 a). To avoid

300

confusions with the inconsistent use of the terms evident in the literature, we refrain from

301

using the labels congruent and incongruent to denote trials, but use congruence effect merely

302

to denote the comparison between AVsame and AVopp. We did not find a significant

303

congruence effect in the present study, despite the fact that we did so in our previously

304

reported behavioral study using similar stimuli. The most obvious candidate explanation for

305

this is that the feature-based crossmodal correspondence used does not influence pre-attentive

306

levels of perceptual processing probed by the MMNm. This interpretation of the result taps

307

into the debate about the level at which these crossmodal interactions take place (Deroy &

308

Spence, 2016; Parise & Spence, 2009) and could be taken as an argument that this specific

309

correspondence only influences participants’ responses at semantic and/or decisional levels of

310

processing. Yet, first of all, one should be careful of drawing conclusions based on null-

311

results, and secondly, there is still the possibility that less salient visual stimuli than the ones

312

used in the present paradigm would lead to significant congruence effects, as bimodal

313

response enhancement is most pronounced when both stimulus dimensions in isolation lead

314

to weak responses, according to the PoIE (Stein & Meredith, 1993). As is evident in the

315

topographies of the conditions involving changes in the visual stimuli, this is clearly not the

316

case here (see supplementary materials, Figure S2, S3, S4, S5).

317

17

Although the visual-only deviant (Vdev) was not an explicit focus of our study, as

318

explained in the methods section, we briefly provide two possible yet still speculative

319

interpretations of the finding that an MMNm comparable in size to the Adev (right

320

hemisphere) and AVsame and AV opp (left hemisphere) was elicited to Vdev, despite no

321

change in the auditory dimension of the stimulus. The first is based on a simple idea of

322

classical conditioning of the auditory cortex (Pavlov, 1927). Because all conditions were

323

included in the same paradigm, it is possible that the MMNm response to Vdev was a

324

conditioned reflex, i.e., the result of a conditioning process in which the auditory and visual

325

dimensions of the audiovisual stimulus have been repeatedly coupled. Crossmodal

326

conditioning and anticipatory excitation of the cortex was demonstrated already in the early

327

1940’s (Anokhin, 1974) and more recent findings also support the notion that the perceptual

328

system easily adapts its predictions even to unnatural stimulus events through the course of

329

an experiment (van Laarhoven, Stekelenburg, & Vroomen, 2017). Indeed, in the visual

330

modality it has been shown that after a visuohaptic training session, haptic shape processing

331

activates visual cortex in the absence of visual input (Lee Masson, Bulthé, Op de Beeck, &

332

Wallraven, 2016).

333

An alternative, yet most likely related account, may be rooted in the fundamental

334

object-directed nature of perception, and the fact that spatiotemporal coherence is key to

335

multisensory object formation processes (Atilgan et al., 2018; Lewkowicz & Ghazanfar,

336

2009; Parise, Spence, & Ernst, 2012). Although we presented participants with simple

337

artificial auditory and visual stimuli, their consistent temporal synchronicity may have made

338

them so convincing audiovisual objects, that an MMNm was elicited whether the auditory,

339

the visual, or both dimensions of the audiovisual stimulus deviated. MMNm elicitation is not

340

restricted to conditions in which the physical properties of the sounds deviate, but may also

341

be elicited to violations of abstract feature patterns (Näätänen et al., 2007). Assuming the

18

342

perceptual system recognizes the stimuli as integrated audiovisual percepts, it is not

343

surprising that a violation in any of its dimensions give rise to an abstract-feature MMNm.

344

Validation of such an account, however, would require demonstrations that similar processes

345

occur in the visual cortices, which is beyond the scope of the present study.

346

Individual-level results

347

This is the first study to quantify the size of visually induced MMNm enhancement across

348

participants with varying levels of unisensory auditory abilities in order to show that the

349

MMNm amplitude enhancement is larger in individuals with smaller amplitudes elicited to

350

auditory-only deviants. This result matches our previously reported behavioral findings of

351

larger gains in pitch discrimination with poorer pitch discrimination thresholds (Møller et al.,

352

2018), and is consistent with an inter-individual interpretation of the PoIE.

353

Similar patterns of observation have been found at the intra-individual level in studies

354

investigating vision as the target modality. Noesselt and colleagues (2010) employed group-

355

level analyses of fMRI data to show sound-induced sensitivity enhancements to low-intensity

356

but not high-intensity visual stimuli. Stevenson and colleagues (2012) recorded visual ERPs

357

across salience levels of audiovisual speech and found greater multisensory gains as salience

358

was reduced. The role of uni-sensory expertise was assessed by Caclin and colleagues (2011)

359

who investigated sound-induced enhancements of visual detection thresholds and found that

360

behavioral enhancements were only evident in a group of participants with poor performance

361

in a visual-only condition. Similarly, in the auditory domain, visual facilitation of behavioral

362

pitch discrimination of quite salient pitch changes (1/4 tone, i.e., 50 cents) has been found

363

only in a group of participants with poor auditory-only abilities (Albouy et al., 2015), while

364

conversely, only the control group exhibited visual facilitation of the subtle (1/16 tone, i.e.,

365

12.5 cents) pitch changes. Senkowski and colleagues (2011) studied effects of stimulus

366

intensities on both auditory and visual modalities and found evidence that early multisensory

19

367

interactions in the human brain follow the PoIE. Our results extend these group-level findings

368

to show that the PoIE is also applicable to pre-attentive auditory processing at the inter-

369

individual level, highlighting the value of taking individual differences in unisensory abilities

370

into account when assessing multisensory perceptual processing.

371

Principle of inverse effectiveness

372

Though the PoIE was derived from studies of single multisensory neurons in the midbrain

373

(Stein & Meredith, 1993), it not surprising to find inverse effectiveness as a general principle

374

across a wide range of processing levels and functions (Albouy et al., 2015; Caclin et al.,

375

2011; Møller et al., 2018; Noesselt et al., 2010; Senkowski et al., 2011; Stevenson et al.,

376

2012). This is the case because multisensory processing does not take place in individual

377

neurons or even cortical areas in isolation. The development of the multisensory processing

378

capabilities of individual neurons in the superior colliculus depend on their embeddedness in

379

a neural network consisting of lower-order subcortical areas as well as higher-order

380

association cortices, and on the organism’s experience in the environment (Stein, Stanford, &

381

Rowland, 2014).

382

Similarly, our findings of inverse effectiveness at the pre-attentive level of neural

383

processing in the auditory cortex should not be taken to suggest, that other areas of the brain

384

do not play a role in the kind of multisensory processing studied here. Rather, the

385

interpretation put forth here is similar to previous accounts of multisensory influences on

386

sensory specific cortices that highlight the fundamental object-directed nature of perception

387

and how object formation processes in the brain are made possible through the spatio-

388

temporal coherence of crossmodal information belonging to the same event (Atilgan et al.,

389

2018; Lewkowicz & Ghazanfar, 2009; Parise et al., 2012). Specifically, it has been shown

390

that phase resetting of ongoing neuronal oscillations is a key mechanisms underlying the

391

amplification of neuronal responses. This phase resetting occurs when bimodal stimuli are

20

392

temporally aligned, and ensures that sensory-specific information arrives in sensory-specific

393

cortices during a high excitability phase resulting in perceptual amplification (Atilgan et al.,

394

2018; see also Lakatos, Chen, O’Connell, Mills, & Schroeder, 2007; Maddox, Atilgan,

395

Bizley, & Lee, 2015). As such, it is not the visual information itself that gives rise to

396

excitation of neurons in the auditory cortex, but rather the excitability of the auditory neurons

397

that is enhanced, mediated by the crossmodal synchronicity. “Top-down” influences on

398

sensory-specific cortices are thus crucial in amplifying the salience of the sensory-specific

399

information, in this case leading to the experience of improved hearing.

400

The design of this study was originally motivated by the PoIE, however, the results

401

may also be interpreted within theoretical accounts that consider multisensory percepts as a

402

weighted average of sensory estimates (Ernst & Banks, 2002; Schwartz, 2010). Like the

403

PoIE, these models highlight the flexibility of our perceptual systems to adapt to variations in

404

the sensory environment (darkness, noise). It follows, that if the reliability of the auditory

405

dimension of the audiovisual events in our experiment is considered low in some participants

406

and high in others, then they will give more weight to the visual and auditory dimensions,

407

respectively. This is in line with recent evidence that musicians who specialize in the auditory

408

domain are less susceptible to audiovisual illusions (Bidelman, 2016; Proverbio, Massetti,

409

Rizzi, & Zani, 2016). Our finding that such effects are evident in the MMNm amplitude fits

410

well with recent research showing that reliability-based cue weighting occurs early (< 150ms)

411

in the audio-visual integration process (Boyle, Kayser, & Kayser, 2017), i.e., well before the

412

latencies of the MMNm responses in the present study.

413

Although the correlations betwee(Alho et al., 1996; Giard & Peronnet, 1999;

414

Tervaniemi et al., 1999)n MMNm and Adev showed similar trends in the two hemispheres,

415

it was only statistically significant in the right hemisphere. A possible explanation for this

416

discrepancy could be rooted in the fact that larger amplitudes were seen in the right than in

21

417

the left hemisphere. It may be the case that these larger amplitudes enabled detection of a

418

significant correlation in the right hemisphere, whereas due to response homogeneity in Adev

419

in the left hemisphere, there may not have been enough variance to detect a statistically

420

significant correlation.

421

Analysis limitations

422

Explanations for functional hemispheric asymmetries are highly relevant to discuss,

423

particularly for auditory processing in the human brain. Apart from merely statistical

424

accounts, however, there are notable reasons why further interpretations regarding

425

lateralization can and should not be made based on the analyses reported here. Most

426

importantly, we ran separate analyses in the two hemispheres, leaving interpretations of

427

differences in evidence between them unsupported. Moreover, while it has been repeatedly

428

shown that the MMN elicited to non-speech auditory stimuli is more pronounced in the right

429

hemisphere of the general population (Alho et al., 1996; Giard & Peronnet, 1999; Tervaniemi

430

et al., 1999), and particularly so for change detection (Levänen, Ahonen, Hari, McEvoy, &

431

Sams, 1996), it has also been shown that expert musicians exhibit the reverse pattern, i.e.,

432

larger MMNm amplitudes in the left hemisphere (Herholz, Lappe, & Pantev, 2009;

433

Kuchenbuch, Paraskevopoulos, Herholz, & Pantev, 2012; Vuust et al., 2005). Furthermore,

434

Foxton and colleagues (2009) provided evidence that people with difficulty in pitch

435

processing show greater recruitment of the left than the right hemisphere when performing

436

active determination of pitch glide direction, a finding which may explain their poorer

437

behavioral performance, which in turn was also evident at the pre-attentive level as assessed

438

with the MMNm. Clearly, effects of expertise are likely to interact with any lateralization

439

patterns evident in the present data, considering the fact that musicians and nonmusicians

440

were not separated in the present analysis. Again, the reason for running the analyses across

441

all participants was to ensure sufficient variance in the data to investigate individual

22

442

differences, a focus that was prioritized over that of lateralization. For transparency, we have

443

reported one group-level analysis for each hemisphere. Note, however, that when the

444

reponses were averaged across hemispheres within participants, a procedure justified by the

445

particular focus on individual differences, the correlation between MMNm and Adev was

446

statistically significant, consistent with the PoIE (see supplementary materials, Figure S6).

447

We acknowledge that a sensor-space analysis limits the conclusions we can make

448

regarding the sources of the neural activity measured. However, there is little doubt that the

449

MMNm is elicited in the auditory cortex, and maximally detected with gradiometers right

450

above the local cortical source (Levänen et al., 1996; Luck, 2005; Näätänen et al., 2007),

451

which was also confirmed in the present data at the individual as well as the group level.

452

Furthermore, a recent study showed that MMNm detectability at the individual level is

453

similar whether sensor-space or source-space analyses are employed . Hence, a sensor-space

454

analysis constrained to the four gradiometer pairs of each hemisphere that picked up the

455

largest MMNm response was considered appropriate in the present context, considering the

456

focus on the MMNm and the fact that the MMN is very well described in the literature as a

457

component with primary sources in the auditory cortices (Alho, 1995; Näätänen et al., 2007).

458

Conclusion

459

Most research on perceptual processing involves stimulation of a single sense. Yet, even

460

perceptual experiences that we consider sensory-specific, such as hearing, are influenced by

461

information in other sensory modalities. We have shown visually induced enhancement of

462

subtle pitch discrimination already at the pre-attentive stage of auditory processing probed by

463

the MMNm. Importantly, participants with lower sensitivity to auditory-only deviants gain

464

more from complementary visual information, in accordance with the multisensory principle

465

of inverse effectiveness. In the quest towards understanding hearing as it unfolds outside the

466

lab, we may gain substantially by paying attention to the possibility that hearing is related in

467

systematic ways to other factors than sound waves.

468

Materials and methods

469

The present magnetoencephalography (MEG) experiment forms a separate part of a larger

470

study. In the larger study, the same participants subsequently completed a behavioral

471

experiment (reported in Møller et al., 2018) and participated in a study employing magnetic

472

resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (manuscript in preparation).

473

Behavioral measures included pitch discrimination threshold (PDT) estimations, a musical

474

aptitude test, i.e., the Musical Ear Test (MET) (Wallentin et al., 2010), two questionnaires,

475

i.e., the Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index (Gold-MSI) (Müllensiefen, Gingras, Musil,

476

& Stewart, 2014), and the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) (Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright,

477

Skinner, Martin, & Clubley, 2001), as well as a custom-made test of pitch direction

478

sensitivity. We report results based on the MEG data and correlate these to the behavioral

479

measures from the MET and PDT tests. MET and PDT data were also analyzed in relation to

480

our previously reported behavioral experiment (Møller et al., 2018), however using a smaller

481

sample of the participants. The PDT data were also analyzed in conjunction with the DTI data

482

(manuscript in preparation).

483

No explicit power analysis was used to compute appropriate sample size due to the

484

novelty of the specific topic under study. However, sample size was established by

485

comparisons with sample sizes used in behavioral studies of crossmodal gains and inverse

486

effectiveness (Albouy et al., 2015; Caclin et al., 2011; Laurienti, Kraft, Maldjian, Burdette, &

487

Wallace, 2004; Senkowski et al., 2011), where reasonable effect sizes were found with

488

sample sizes between 11 and 34. Accordingly, we considered recruitment of ~50 participants

489

appropriate as we expected a somewhat high exclusion rate in the subsequent behavioral

490

study due to chance and ceiling level performance.

493

from all analyses due to stimulus presentation failure. Because of the present focus on

494

unisensory abilities, an a priori decision was made to exclude data from participants from

495

whom no pitch threshold estimation was made. This was the case for two individuals. Hence,

496

data from 45 participants (mean age = 24.2 years, SD = 3.6, 23 female) were included in the

497

analyses reported here. As described in the introduction, a sub-group of these were

498

professional musicians. Specifically, participants included 29 nonmusicians (mean age = 24.1

499

years, SD =3.3, 16 female) and 16 musicians (mean age = 24.3 years, SD = 4.1, 7 female). All

500

were right-handed, all reported normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity and no hearing

501

impairments.

502

Participants gave their written consent before participation and received a taxable

503

compensation of DKK 400 for participating in the larger study which took place on two

504

separate days. The study protocol was approved by The Central Denmark Regional

505

Committee on Health Research Ethics (Project-ID: M-2014-52-14).

of four colors per block and report the count orally to the experimenter after each block.

VISUAL ENHANCEMENT OF THE MMNm AND AUDITORY SENSITIVITY

513

Stimuli and paradigm

514

The auditory stimuli consisted of sinusoidal tones of 100 ms duration, including 5 ms fade

515

in/out followed by a 316 ms inter-stimulus interval (ISI). Standard tones were 523.25 Hz

516

(corresponding to C5 on a piano), deviant tones were 20 cents higher (i.e., 529.33 Hz) and 20

517

cents lower (i.e., 517.24 Hz) with respect to the standard. The visual stimuli consisted of an

518

image of a rectangle containing a light grey disc (see Figure 4), which subtended a visual

519

angle of 3 degrees watched from a distance of 135 cm. The rectangle was static, yet the disc

520

was positioned in three vertical positions: either above, below, or in the center of the

521

rectangle, which was clearly marked by the crossing of two lines serving as a fixation cross.

522

The displacement of the disc from the center was 0.5 degrees visual angle, i.e., small enough

523

to be perceived as an excursion of the disc rather than as the sudden pop up of a new disc, but

524

large enough to be clearly visible. The duration of the visual stimuli was 416 ms, i.e., there

525

was no ISI. This was preferred because the perceptual salience of a flickering visual stimulus

526

(i.e., one with a 316 ms ISI) much exceeded the perceptual salience of the excursion of the

527

disc.

528

The audiovisual (AV) stimuli comprised all possible combinations of the three

529

auditory and three visual stimulus types, resulting in nine different stimulus pairs. An AV

530

standard consisted of a standard tone coupled with a disc in center position. With higher pitch

531

corresponding to higher vertical position, the eight AV deviants were categorized into same

532

direction deviants (AVsame) (i.e., high pitch with disc above the center, or low pitch with

533

disc below the center), opposite direction deviants (AVopp) (i.e., high pitch with disc below

534

the center, or low pitch with disc above the center), and auditory-only deviants (Adev) (high

535

pitch or low pitch with no excursion of the disc from the center). A visual-only deviant

536

(Vdev) (no pitch change with disc below or above the center) also appeared in the paradigm.

537

However, because of the focus on putative visual modulation of the auditory MMNm, the

VISUAL ENHANCEMENT OF THE MMNm AND AUDITORY SENSITIVITY

27

538

present paradigm was not designed to assess visual MMNm. Indeed, despite the visual only

539

deviant included, it is not possible to extract proper vMMNm from it that can be likened to

540

the vMMNm reported in the literature (Stefanics, Astikainen, & Czigler, 2015; Winkler &

541

Czigler, 2012). This is the case because no actual visual standard events are present in a

542

visual stream with no ISI, except on the standard immediately following the deviants, which

543

in turn is contaminated by the response to the preceding deviant. The purpose of including the

544

visual deviant nonetheless was to reduce predictability by ensuring that a change in the visual

545

stream was not always accompanied by an auditory deviant.

546

Presentation software (Neurobehavioral systems Inc., Albany, CA, USA) was used to

547

present the stimuli. The timing of the onset of auditory and visual stimuli was adjusted to

548

mimic sound source perception from the perspective of the participant. This included

549

ensuring that the sounds arrived at participants’ ears with the same delay (4 ms) as if they had

550

been emitted from the position of the visual images themselves. The AV stimuli were

551

presented with a stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of 416 ms in an oddball paradigm with

552

20% deviants (2.5% per deviant, 5% per deviant category). 12.1% of the remaining stimuli

553

were control task stimuli. They were similar to the standard stimuli with respect to auditory

554

frequency and position of the disc, yet the disc was colored: green, red, blue, yellow, all

555

matched with respect to the luminance of the grey discs. These control task stimuli were

556

always presented as the first stimulus after a deviant. Each of the eight deviants was

557

presented 100 times, yet pairs of deviants that fell into the same category (Adev, AVsame,

558

AVopp, Vdev, respectively) were concatenated in the analysis to increase the signal-to-noise

559

ratio, yielding 200 trials per deviant category. The deviants were pseudo-randomly presented

560

with a minimum of three and a maximum of seven standards between two deviants. As such,

561

the distribution of the number of standards was centered on four, however, a right skew was

562

enforced in the distribution to give relatively few instances of six and seven standards. This

563

approached was preferred in order to reduce the predictability arising from equiprobable

564

stimulus presentation, which may attenuate the MMNm amplitude. The total number of

565

audiovisual stimuli was thus 4000, 800 of which were deviants. They were presented in four

566

identical blocks preceded by 5 instances of AV standards. The duration of each block was 7

567

min. In addition to the four AV blocks, the experiment included two unimodal control blocks,

568

presented as the third and fifth of the six blocks; the presentation order was counterbalanced

569

across participants within each group. The unimodal visual control block was identical to the

570

AV block except that the sound was turned off. In the unimodal auditory control block, which

571

also contained 200 deviant trials (100 high, 100 low pitch trials), the visual stimuli were

572

replaced by a silent Charlie Chaplin movie.

573

Procedure

574

During MEG recordings, participants were seated in a magnetically shielded and sound-

575

attenuated room with ambient lighting. Visual stimuli were projected onto a screen with a

576

refresh rate of 60 Hz. The screen was positioned 135 cm in front of the participant. Auditory

577

stimuli were presented via in-ear headphones (Etymotic ER•30) at a comfortable hearing

578

level of approximately 70 dB sound pressure level (SPL). Before the experiment, a short

579

experimental procedure varying interaural-level-difference (ILD) was administered to ensure

580

that participants perceived the sounds as originating straight in front of them (i.e., SPL was

581

perceived as equal in the two ears). Participants were informed about the presence of sounds

582

and images in the experiment, and instructed to focus on the cross at the center of the screen,

583

pay attention to the color changes of the disc and silently count the number of occurrences.

584

There were 28 green, 32 red, 37 blue and 24 yellow discs in each block. Participants counted

585

each color separately, and reported the count orally after each block. This task applied to the

586

four AV blocks as well as to the visual only block in which the targets were green discs. In

587

the auditory only block, participants were encouraged to take a break from the task and enjoy

588

the movie. In all encounters with the participants, we referred to the auditory stimuli as

589

“sounds” rather than “notes” or “tones” in order not to induce a semantic confound into the

590

experiment by using a vocabulary that is often associated with the relative terms “high” and

591

“low”. This was particularly important as all instructions were in Danish and the Danish word

592

for “pitch” literally translates into “tone height” (tonehøjde). The duration of the experiment

593

was approximately 50 minutes, including breaks between the blocks.

594

Pitch threshold estimation

595

In a separate session, two to four weeks after the MEG session, individual pitch

596

discrimination thresholds (PDTs) were estimated using a two-down, one-up adaptive staircase

597

procedure that converges on the 70.7% performance level on the psychometric function

598

(Levitt 1971). Using an AXB forced-choice task, the reference (X) was always a 523.25 Hz

599

sinusoidal tone, and the task was to state whether the first (A) or the last (B) tone differed

600

from the two other tones. The staircase terminated after 14 reversals and the threshold was

601

calculated on the basis of an average of the last 6 reversals. Depending on participants’

602

responses, the duration was approximately three to five minutes. The staircase procedure was

603

similar to the one used by Williamson, Liu, Peryer, Grierson, and Stewart (2012), yet adapted

604

to match the stimuli and participants of the present study. The pitch threshold estimation data

605

were also included in the analysis of a behavioral experiment reported in Møller et al.,

606

(2018).

607

Musical abilities assessment

608

To assess the musical abilities of the participants, we used the melodic part of the Musical

609

Ear Test (MET) (Wallentin et al., 2010). In the melodic subtest, participant were asked to

610

judge whether pairs of melodic piano phrases were identical or not. MET scores have been

611

shown to correlate with results of musical imitation tests typically used in auditions for music

612

conservatories.

MEG recording

614

Continuous MEG data were sampled at 1000 Hz using Elekta Neuromag Triux™ whole-head

615

306-channel MEG system, with 204 planar gradiometers and 102 magnetometers. This

616

system is part of the MINDLab Core Experimental Facility at Aarhus University Hospital,

617

Denmark. Participants’ head positions were recorded using four continuous Head Position

618

Indicator (cHPI) coils, and bipolar surface electrodes positioned above and below the right

619

eye (vertical EOG), at the outer canthi of both eyes (horizontal EOG), and on the right

620

clavicle and left rib (ECG) recorded eye blinks and cardiac activity, respectively.

621

MEG preprocessing

622

Initial preprocessing was performed using the temporal extension of the signal space

623

separation (tSSS) technique (Taulu, Kajola, & Simola, 2004; Taulu & Simola, 2006))

624

implemented in Elekta’s MaxFilter software (Version 2.2.15). This involved removal of noise

625

from electromagnetic sources outside the head and compensation for within- and between-

626

block differences in head position as well as continuous head movement compensation using

627

cHPI. EOG and ECG artifacts were detected and removed from the maxfiltered data with

628

independent component analysis (ICA) using the find_bads_eog and find_bads_ecg

629

algorithms in MNE Python (Gramfort et al., 2013, 2014). The topographies and averaged

630

epochs of all identified EOG- and ECG-related components were visually inspected for all

631

participants to ensure the validity of rejected components. The remaining data were band-

632

pass filtered, using an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter with cutoff frequencies of 1 and

633

40 Hz.

634

The subsequent preprocessing was conducted using FieldTrip (Oostenveld, Fries,

635

Maris, & Schoffelen, 2011). The MEG data were downsampled to 250 hz and separated in

636

epochs of 516 ms starting 100 ms before the onset of the trial and ending at the onset of the

637

following trial. Baseline correction was applied based on the 100 ms pre-stimulus window.

Trials containing SQUID jumps were discarded using automatic artefact rejection with a z-

639

value cutoff of 30.

640

31

Planar gradiometers pick up the largest signal just above a local source where the

641

gradient has its maximum (Levänen et al., 1996; Luck, 2005). In contrast, magnetometers are

642

more likely to also pick up activity from deeper sources and elsewhere in the cortex (Vrba &

643

Robinson, 2002). Hence, because our focused interest was in the modulation of the neural

644

signals emanating specifically from the auditory cortex, the sensor space analysis focused on

645

combined planar gradiometer recordings from immediately above auditory cortex. Planar

646

gradiometer recordings were calculated as vector sums by taking the root-mean-square

647

(RMS) of the two gradients at each gradiometer pair resulting in a single positive RMS value

648

for each pair.

649

Channel selection was accomplished through the use of the MMNm response

650

obtained in the unimodal auditory control block. As such, the well-described MMNm

651

response obtained in a classic oddball paradigm as used in our control block served as a

652

functional localizer at the sensor level (Luck & Gaspelin, 2017). Initially, group-averaged

653

difference waveforms for each channel were obtained by first subtracting each participant’s

654

average response to the third standard after a deviant from their average response to the

655

deviants, and then averaging across participants. Peak amplitudes and latencies of the P1m,

656

i.e., the early, sensory-driven component which was prominent for all sounds in the present

657

data, were identified in the standard waveforms within a 40-80 ms time window from

658

stimulus onset. On the difference waveforms, local MMNm peaks were identified within a

659

100-200 ms time window following the timepoint of the P1m peak as it appeared in the

660

standard waveform. This was accomplished using Matlab’s findpeaks function, which

661

identified data samples with a greater voltage than each of its neighboring data samples. A

662

polarity switch in the magnetometer topographies between the P1m and the MMNm

(see Figure 5).

674

33

MMNm amplitudes were defined as the average within a 20 ms time window

675

centered at the MMNm peak latencies. Having identified the MMNm amplitudes for each

676

channel in the unimodal auditory control block, all subsequent analyses were constrained to

677

the four sensors of each hemisphere picking up the largest group-averaged MMNm response

678

(see Figure 5) in the unimodal auditory control block. Rather than using just the peak

679

channel, the average of four channels was used to account for individual variations in head

680

position, size, etc. The four selected channels were also the channels with the largest P1m

681

amplitude in the group-average standard waveform. To confirm the relevance of these four

682

channels at the level of the individual participants, they were compared to the P1m peak

683

channel of each participant for each hemisphere. Individual P1m amplitudes and latencies

684

were identified within the 40-80 ms time window from stimulus onset and the P1m peak

685

channel was defined as the channel containing the largest peak. Except for two participants

686

whose P1m peak channel in the left hemisphere was a more posterior neighboring channel,

687

the P1m peak channel of all participants was identical to one of the four selected channels of

688

each hemisphere.

689

Due to the large inter-individual variability of the ERF difference waveforms in the

690

experimental conditions, individual local MMNm peaks and latencies of each hemisphere and

691

each condition were identified for each participant individually using the same procedure as

692

described for the functional localizer, i.e., within a 100-200 ms time window following the

693

individual participant’s P1m peak in the auditory-only block. A summary value of the

694

MMNm amplitude was extracted for each participant, each hemisphere and each condition

695

(see individual participants’ responses in supplementary materials, Figure S1). In cases where

696

the MMNm peak was exceeded in amplitude by a peak which did not show opposite polarity

697

to the P1m on the magnetometer topography, the window was narrowed further to avoid the

698

spurious peak being picked up by the fully automated procedure. Similarly, plots of

699

waveforms and topographies were compared across conditions within each hemisphere for

700

each participant. Inconsistencies were typically found when MMNms were less prominent,

701

and the search criteria were adapted when applicable to ensure consistency between the

702

automatically selected peaks. Altogether, further constraints were necessary in one or both

703

hemispheres for 10 participants in the unimodal auditory control block and in 1-5 out of 8

704

instances (4 conditions x 2 hemispheres) for 11 participants in the audiovisual experimental

705

blocks, accounting for 9.3 % of the total number of peaks.

706

All statistical analyses were performed in IBM SPSS Statistics 24. Bootstrapping with

707

5000 samples was used to estimate 95% bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) confidence

708

intervals (CIs), when this more robust method was required due to skewness in the

709

distribution of one or more variable outcomes.
