Abstract

27

Rice false smut, caused by the ascomycete Ustilaginoidea virens, is a serious disease

28

of rice worldwide. Conidia are very important infectious propagules of U. virens, but

29

the ability of pathogenic isolates to produce conidia frequently decreases in culture,

30

which influences pathogenicity testing. Here, we developed tissue media with rice

31

leaves or panicles that stimulate conidiation of U. virens. Generally, rice leaf media

32

more effectively increased conidiation than panicle media, and certain non-filtered

33

tissue media were better than their filtered counterparts. Among the tested media, the

34

Indica rice leaf medium with 0.06 g/ml of Wanxian 98 leaf was most efficient for

35

inducing conidiation, and it was also usable for conidiation-defective isolates.

36

Although the conidia induced in rice tissue media were smaller, they were able to

37

germinate on potato sucrose agar medium and infect rice normally. This method

38

provides a foundation for the production of conidia in U. virens that will be widely

39

applied in the pathogenicity testing as well as in genetic analyses for false smut

40

resistance in rice cultivars.

Introduction

52

Rice false smut (RFS), caused by the ascomycete Ustilaginoidea virens, has

53

become one of the most destructive diseases in the majority of rice-growing regions

54

around the world, resulting in severe field losses of rice (Atia 2004; Ladhalakshmi et

55

al. 2012; Rush et al. 2000; Sun et al. 2013; Zhou et al. 2008). The typical symptom is

56

smut balls informed in rice panicles, the surface of which is covered by an abundance

57

of powdery, dark-green chlamydospores (Ikegami 1962). Frequently, sclerotia can be

58

observed on the surface of false smut balls. In addition to yield losses, U. virens

59

produces ustiloxins that are toxic to human and animals and can inhibit radicle and

60

plumule growth in plant seedlings (Abbas 2014; Meng et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2017).

61

U. virens can overwinter with thick-walled chlamydospores and sclerotia, the latter

62

can produce sexual ascospores. Both ascospores and chlamydospores germinate and

63

produce secondary conidia, which are the sources of primary infection in rice (Fan et

64

al. 2014; Fan et al. 2010; Fu et al. 2012). Some studies have indicated that U. virens

65

can infect roots and other rice tissues (Andargie 2015; Tang et al. 2017; Zheng et al.

66

2016). Nevertheless, numerous inoculation experiments and studies have shown that

67

the majority of U. virens infections occur at the booting stage (Fu et al. 2012; Song et

68

al. 2016; Tang et al. 2013; Yong et al. 2016). Conidia germinate and enter spikelets

69

through the gap between the lemma and palea (Ashizawa et al. 2012), after that U.

70

virens hyphae enter and grow intercellularly in the filaments of rice florets during the

71

early stages of infection (Hu et al. 2014; Song et al. 2016; Tang et al. 2013).

72

Subsequently, the hyphal growth extends to invade the stigmas and styles, enclosing

73

the ﬂoral organs (Song et al. 2016). Finally, the hyphal mass extrudes from the lemma

74

and palea, developing into false smut balls.

75

As one of the sources of primary infection, chlamydospores have been used to carry

76

out artificial inoculation experiments; however, the incidence of infection achieved

77

has been low (Fujita et al. 1989; Wang 1992; Zhang et al. 2003). In separate studies,

78

mixtures of conidia and hyphae were injected into rice panicles at the booting stage,

79

which can improve the incidence of infection significantly (Jia et al. 2015; Zhang et

80

al. 2004; Zhang et al. 2003). Currently, this method is widely used to assess the

81

pathogenicity of U. virens and the resistance of rice to RFS (Han et al. 2015; Li et al.

82

2013; Lv et al. 2016; Zheng et al. 2017; Zhou et al. 2014). The production of conidia

83

depends on the time that the isolate has been in cultured and temperature, medium and

84

isolates, etc. Up to 108 conidia/ml can be produced after 6 days in potato dextrose

85

broth (PDB) and potato sucrose broth (PSB) (Wang et al. 1998). Previous research

86

has indicated that 2% sucrose-amended PDB containing barley seed produces more

87

conidia in a shorter period of time (Ashizawa et al. 2011) compared with other media.

88

The largest amount of conidia were detected after 6 or 7 days at 26-28℃ with shaking

89

at 140 to 210 rpm (He et al. 2011; Shi et al. 2017). In addition, some studies have

90

found that conidia production was related to individual isolate characteristics (Li et al.

91

2012a; Li et al. 2012b). We also found that the conidiation capacity varies in different

92

isolates and degradation with increasing numbers of transfers or, for certain isolates,

93

length of time kept in the laboratory.

94

In this study, we developed tissue media with rice leaves or panicles that could

95

promote the conidiation of U. virens. The optimal medium identified was especially

96

useful for stimulating conidiation in isolates with defective conidial production.

97

Although the conidia produced in this medium were small in size, they germinated

98

and infected rice similarly with these produced in normal PSB medium.

101

U. virens strains D32-1, HWD-2 and UV-8 as well as the GFP-labeled strain G2

102

were used in this study. U. virens isolates 09-11-1-1 and 09-14-21 were generously

103

provided by Prof. Shiping Wang (Huazhong Agricultural University), both of which

104

showed defective conidiation after being maintained in a laboratory environment for a

105

long period of time (more than 8 years). The Indica rice cultivar Wanxian 98 and the

106

Japonica rice cultivar Huajing 952 were selected for this study.

107

Media and culture conditions

108

At the late booting stage (3-5 days before the heading stage of rice), leaves and

109

panicles of the Indica and Japonica rice cultivars were collected for media preparation.

110

Subsequently, 0.5, 1.5, 3.0 and 5.0 g of leaves or panicles of Wanxian 98 or Huajing

111

952 were crushed with a 22, 000 rpm mixer (Midea, model number: MJ-250BP01B)

112

for 1 min in 40 ml distilled water respectively. Then they were used directly

113

(unfiltered) or filtered with three layers of gauze to prepare media with the final

114

concentrations of 0.01, 0.03, 0.06 and 0.10 g/ml respectively, and the media were

115

autoclaved at 121℃ for 30 min.

116

For conidiation tests, the strain G2 was incubated on PSA (potato sucrose agar: 200

117

ml of juice from 200 g of potato, 20 g of sucrose, and 15 g of agar per liter) at 27℃

118

for 10 days, two 5-mm mycelial plugs were taken from the periphery of colony using

119

a cork borer and incubated in 50 ml of PSB (PSA without agar) or liquid rice tissue

120

media at 27℃ with shaking at 160 rpm. The production of conidia was investigated

121

from 3rd to 7th day using a hemacytometer. The conidiation from the filtered rice

122

tissue media were compared with unfiltered ones at the 7th day post-incubation (DPI).

123

The conidiation in 0.06 g/ml leaf media were compared with 0.06 g/ml panicle media

124

at 7 DPI. The conidiation in 0.06 g/ml of Indica rice leaves (IRLs) were compared

125

with 0.06 g/ml of Japonica rice leaves (JRLs) at 7 DPI. Three replicates were

126

observed for each treatment, with three droplets of each suspension examined per

127

replicate. The experiment was conducted twice. The conidiation in different

128

concentrations of rice tissue media and PSB were analyzed with SPSS at P = 0.05.

129

Investigation of conidia size and germination and mycelial

130

growth by U. virens strain

131

To determine conidia size, leaves or panicles from Wanxian 98 or Huajing 952 at

132

late booting stage were collected to make 0.06 g/ml rice tissue media and PSB was

133

selected as control. Strain G2 was shaken in liquid media for 7 days and filtered

134

through four layers of gauze to collect its conidia. For each treatment, 100 conidia

135

were measured at two perpendicular directions under a microscope. For the

136

germination test, conidia were harvested by centrifugation at 7, 000 rpm and adjusted

137

to a concentration of approximately 1.0×104 conidia/ml. The conidia were spread on

138

the surface of PSA or WA (water agar: 15 g of agar per liter), and the germination rate

139

was investigated at 12, 24, 36 and 48 h respectively. For each treatment, 100 conidia

140

were measured per replicate and three replicates were carried out. Each experiment

141

was conducted twice. For mycelia growth, 5-mm mycelial plugs were removed from

142

the margins of a colony and placed in the center of PSA, WA and 0.06 g/ml rice tissue

143

media. The plates were incubated at 27℃ in the dark for three weeks, and two

144

perpendicular colony diameters were measured. Five replicates were performed for

145

each treatment, and the experiment was conducted three times.

146

Pathogenicity assays

147

After 7 days of incubation of strain G2 in PSB or 0.06 g/ml IRLs with shaking,

148

conidia were collected and the concentration of each sample was adjusted to 1.0×106

149

conidia/ml with PSB for inoculation or another treatment. For another treatment, the

150

conidia were cultured in 50 ml of PSB at 27℃ with shaking at 160 rpm for 8-12 h for

151

germination, and then conidia were collected again and adjusted to 1.0×106

152

conidia/ml with PSB for inoculation. The inoculation was performed as described

153

previously (Song et al. 2016). In brief, approximately 2 ml of each conidia (1.0×106

154

conidia/ml) suspension in PSB was injected into a single rice panicle at the late

155

booting stage. Inoculated plants were kept in a 27℃ greenhouse with 90-100%

156

relative humidity (RH) for 7 days. Then, they were placed at 27℃ and 80% RH until

157

rice false smut symptoms appeared. The number of false smuts were recorded and

158

analyzed. Twelve rice panicles were inoculated for each treatment, the experiments

159

were conducted three times.

160

Conidia production of conidiation-defective isolates in rice

161

tissue media

162

The conidiation-defective isolates D32-1, HWD-2, UV-8, 09-11-1-1 and 09-14-21

163

were selected for conidiation tests, two 5-mm mycelial plugs were taken from the

164

periphery of a 10-day-old colony of each isolate using a cork borer, and incubated in

165

50 ml of PSB or rice tissue media with the concentration of 0.06 g/ml IRL at 27℃

166

with shaking at 160 rpm. The amounts of conidia were counted 3rd to 7th day using a

167

hemacytometer. Three replicates were examined for each treatment, with three

168

droplets of each suspension per replicate. The experiments were conducted twice.

Results

171

Rice tissue media promoted the conidiation of U. virens

172

To develop a medium that promotes U. virens conidiation, different rice tissue

173

media were produced to investigate whether rice tissues can promote the conidiation

174

of U. virens. Conidiation of strain G2 was evaluated at 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 DPI. As shown

175

in Table 1, compared with PSB, Indica rice leaves or panicles media produced more

176

conidia at individual time points. These results indicated that Indica rice tissues could

177

promote conidia production. Among the four concentrations, in general, higher rice

178

tissue concentrations induced more conidia except for the medium with 0.10 g/ml

179

IRLs, which showed fewer conidia compared with other concentrations of IRLs

180

(Table 1). It is possible that too much fibrous tissue in the 0.10 g/ml IRL medium

181

hindered the smooth shaking that is important for conidia production.

The effect of different media with unfiltered or filtered rice leaves and panicles was

evaluated. The number of conidia from IRL media was compared to that from IRL

IRL media at concentrations of 0.01 (P = 8.873×10-6), 0.03 (P = 7.383×10-4) and 0.06

195

g/ml (P = 1.755×10-2). However, at 0.10 g/ml, fewer conidia were produced in the

IRL medium compared with the IRLF medium, most likely because too much rice

Considering that U. virens infects the rice panicle, panicle tissues were also

selected to prepare media for conidiation testing. The results of the Indica rice panicle

(IRP) media were similar to these of the IRL media at 7 DPI, with the exception of the

202

0.10 g/ml IRP medium that induced more conidia production (P = 4.061×10-4), likely

203

because there is less fibrous tissue in rice panicles compared to leaves. Four

204

concentrations of IRPs and IRP filtrates (IRPFs) were also compared. More conidia

205

were observed in the IRPs media, except for 0.06 g/ml media which did not show

significant difference between the IRP and IRPF media (P = 0.463).

at 0.01 (P = 3.218×10-5) and 0.03 g/ml (P = 7.818×10-5) at 7 DPI, but no significant

209

difference was observed at 0.06 g/ml (P = 0.086). However, at 0.10 g/ml, the IRLs

210

media produced fewer conidia compared with the IRP media (P = 2.867×10-5).

211

Similar results were observed when tissues of Japonica rice cultivar Huajing 952

212

were used. Generally, the rice tissue media produced more conidia, except for the

213

0.01 g/ml Japonica rice leaf filtrate (JRLF) medium. For the different tissues, at 0.06

214

g/ml, Japonica rice leaf (JRL) medium produced more conidia than Japonica rice

panicle (JRP) medium at 7 DPI (P = 2.459×10-2); however, no significant differences

216

produced more conidia at 0.01 (P = 4.608×10-4), 0.03 (P = 2.464×10-5) and 0.06 g/ml

218

(P = 6.709×10-7), and no significant difference was observed at 0.10 g/ml (P = 0.340).

219

JRP media produced more conidia at all four concentrations than JRPF media (Table

conidia produced in PSB were larger than these produced in IRL, IRP, JRL and JRP

To investigate the germination of conidia produced in rice tissue media, conidial

255

germination of strain G2 from IRL, IRP, JRL and JRP media as well as PSB were

256

assessed on PSA and WA at 12, 24, 36 and 48 h. On PSA, the germination rate of

257

conidia from PSB was 96.9% at 12 h. For conidia from IRL and JRL media, the

258

germination rates were 68.9% and 67.8%, respectively. Conidia from IRP and JRP

259

media showed the highest (89.9%) and lowest (41.6%) germination rates among these

260

from the four different rice tissue media (Fig 1). After more than 24 h, almost all

261

conidia had germinated. On WA, a germination rate of 43.6% was observed for

262

conidia from PSB at 12 h, while lower germination rates were found for conidia from

263

other media. Over time, the germination rate increased gradually and more than 90%

264

of conidia from PSB germinated at 48 h. However, the germination rates were 69.2%,

265

56.1%, 54.2% and 37.7% for conidia from IRL, IRP, JRL and JRP media,

266

respectively, which were significantly lower than that from PSB (Fig 1). These results

267

showed that the germination of conidia from rice tissue medium was slower than that

268

from PSB, and generally the germination rate was higher on PSA than on WA.

269

Fig 1. Conidia produced in rice tissue media have decreased germination rates. Conidia

270

produced in PSB, IRL, IRP, JRL and JRP media were spread on PSA (A) or WA (B) and their

germination rates were measured at 12 h, 24 h, 36 h and 48 h. Three independent experiments were

272

performed, and similar results were obtained. Error bars represent the standard deviation of three

273

replicates.

274

The mycelial mass was thin on rice tissue media

275

Considering that rice tissue media promotes the production of conidia, we

276

investigated whether the media provide enough nutrients for U. virens growth.

277

Mycelial growth of strain G2 was assessed on rice tissue media solidified with 2%

278

agar. The results showed that the colony diameter was largest on JRP media with agar

279

(JRPA), while they were smaller on PSA and other rice tissue media. On WA, though

280

some hyphae were observed, they grew slowly and loosely. Basically, despite the fact

281

that mycelial growth was stimulated on some rice tissue media, the hyphae were loose

282

and mycelia were thin (Fig 2). These results showed that U. virens can grow on both

283

rice tissue media and PSA, but the overall biomass is decreased on rice tissue media,

284

suggesting that rice tissue media could not provide enough nutrients for mycelial

285

growth.

296

the conidia were collected and diluted with PSB, and (III) the conidia were collected

298

inoculation results showed that more smut balls were observed for treatment III,

299

whereas few or no smut balls were observed for treatments I and II (Table 4). These

300

results showed that although the conidia produced in rice tissue media can germinate

and infect rice successfully, they should be incubated for 8-12 h in PSB before they

are used to inoculate rice.

As the best medium to induce conidiation among examined different media, the

315

in conidiation-defective isolates. The isolates D32-1, HWD2-2, UV-8, 09-11-1-1 and

316

09-14-21 were selected because they all fail to produce conidia or only produce few

317

conidia. Interestingly, for all of these isolates, conidia were produced at 3 or 4 DPI in

318

319

conversely, little or no conidia were observed in PSB. HWD2-2 and UV-8 produced

320

the most conidia (up to 2.3×107 conidia/ml) in the IRL medium, an amount equal to

321

that produced by non-defective isolates in PSB. The other isolates, D32-1, 09-11-1-1

322

and 09-14-21, produced fewer conidia but were still within the same order of

323

magnitude as that produced by HWD2-2 and UV-8. These results indicated that the

324

IRL medium could be used to induce conidiation in defective isolates (Table 5).

In this study, we developed rice tissue media that could promote the conidiation of

334

conidiation-defective strains. Even though the conidia produced in rice tissue media

335

were smaller and germinated more slowly compared with these produced in PSB, the

336

pathogenicity of the tested strain has not been effected once they were incubated in

337

PSB for 8-12 h before inoculation, indicating that rice tissue media, especially the

338

0.06 g/ml IRL can be used to provide conidia for pathogenicity testing or genetic

339

analyses of rice resistance and U. virens avirulence.

340

The major factors that affect conidiation include nutrients, host tissues and light (Su

341

et al. 2012). For U. virens, temperature, medium and strain are important for conidia

342

production. PSB and PDB media were commonly used for conidia production (Li et

343

al. 2012a; Shi et al. 2017; Wang et al. 1998). However, conidiation varies among

344

different isolates and conidia production can be unstable, eventually receding along

345

with the increased numbers of transfer or long-term storage. Host tissues are often

346

used to induce sporulation in plant pathogenic fungi (Su et al. 2012). Research has

347

shown that different kinds of plant leaves can induce sporulation in Colletotrichum

348

dematium (Yoshida and Shirata 2000). Furthermore, the biotin in mulberry leaves was

349

found to alter the synthesis of cell wall polysaccharides and oleic acid, thus triggering

350

the selective expression of genes involved in sporulation (Yoshida and Shirata 2000).

351

A carrot medium was considered as the best medium for obtaining conidia from

352

Venturia nashicola (Choi et al. 2017). In addition, dried barley seeds were added to

353

2% sucrose-amended PDB medium to improve conidia production in U. virens

354

(Ashizawa et al. 2011). Starvation or nutritional depletion often stimulates sporulation

355

(Skromne et al. 1995), but no clear research has been performed for U. virens. In this

356

study, rice leaves and panicles were crushed to make media in which they induced

357

conidiation within a shorter timeframe than the basal medium. No significant

358

differences were observed between the leaves and panicles from Indica cultivar

359

Wanxian 98. However, for Japonica cultivar Huajing 952, media containing leaves

360

produced more conidia than panicles. No differences were observed between leaf

361

media and leaves from different varieties or stages of maturity. The conidiation

362

capacity of U. virens on different media was positively related to tissue concentrations,

363

except for 0.1 g/ml IRL in which insufficient shaking occurred. The media with rice

364

leaf or panicle filtrates produced fewer conidia compared with unfiltered media,

365

probably because the residues contain substances or provide certain physical benefits

366

that affect conidiation. Meanwhile, less conidia were produced in 0.01 g/ml JRPF

367

than in PSB, which might have been caused by insufficient nutrients. All these rice

368

tissue contain less nutrition compared with PSB, indicating appropriate starvation

369

could stimulate the conidiation. On the other side, some substance in rice may play

370

the function to promote the conidiation.

371

Conidia can germinate on biotic and abiotic surfaces to form hyphae and

372

differentiate conidiophores to generate a large number of secondary conidia or

373

produce secondary conidia directly (Fan et al. 2014; Fu et al. 2012). The conidia

374

produced in rice tissue media were smaller with slower germination than these

375

produced in PSB, suggesting that rice tissue media does not supply enough nutrients

376

for the conidial growth. On WA, the germination rates of the conidia from rice tissue

377

media were lower than these produced in PSB, indicating that sufficient nutrition is

378

important for germination of conidia.

379

Conidia produced in rice leaf media and then cultured in PSB for 8-12 h with

380

shaking were able to infect rice. However, conidia produced without cultured in PSB

381

lost the ability to infect rice, even they were diluted in PSB. For successful

382

inoculation, the conidia have to be diluted or resuspended in PSB (Jia et al. 2015;

383

do not have enough nutrition and should be further cultured in PSB to achieve

385

successful infection.

386

In conclusion, we developed media that induced conidiation in U. virens, even in

387

conidiation-defective isolates. These media are extremely valuable because many

388

important isolates frequently lose their ability to conidiate after many transfers or

389

long-term storage. Our media could stimulate and recover conidiation in such isolates,

390

thus providing a solid foundation for continuously performing pathogenicity testing,

391

which is necessary for genetic analyses of rice resistance and fungal virulence test.
