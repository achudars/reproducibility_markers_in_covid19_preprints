Exploiting Homologous Recombination Increases SATAY Efficiency for Loss- And Gain-ofFunction Screening
Agnès H. Michel1,*, Sabine van Schie2, Andreas Mosbach3, Gabriel Scalliet3 and Benoît Kornmann1,*
The analysis of large-scale transposon mutant libraries is becoming a method of choice for functional genomics in bactebacteria and fungi. We previously established SAturated Transposon Analysis in Yeast (SATAY) to uncover genes necessary for
growth in any condition in S. cerevisiae (Michel et al., 2017).
2017). We present an improved version leveraging homologous rerecombination to increase transposition efficiency by a factor 10, allowing a single experimenter to rapidly perform several

parallel screens. We demonstrate its potential by presenting (1) a comparison of the essential gene sets between two yeast
laboratory backgrounds, (2) a comprehensive description of essential genes displaying phenotypic delays – we highlight
their common features and propose plausible explanations for this phenomenon –, (3) a genome-wide analysis of lossand gain-of-function mutations conferring sensitivity or resistance to a compendium of 9 anti-fungal compounds. This
study highlights the power of this improved SATAY protocol for yeast functional- and pharmaco-genomics.

We wondered whether we could leverage the increased efficacy to simplify the SATAY protocol substantially. In the original protocol, a strain is plated densely on
+galactose -adenine plates and allowed to transpose for
three weeks. With 8-11·103 colonies per plate, ~300 plates
were needed to obtain 2-3·106 independent clones. This
long step was necessary to reach the highest possible number of clones. It was carried out on solid medium to allow
late-emerging clones to catch-up with the early emerging
ones, and therefore to minimize variability arising from
stochastic differences in transposition timing. With the increased efficiency, it became likely that the long waiting

BY4741 library, and 60 ml in 2 L for W303. We thus seeded
4·106 and 13·106 independent transposed clones at an initial
OD of 0.2 for By4741 and W303, respectively. After ~70
hours, the OD had reached ~1-4. We then harvested the
cultures, measured the ratio of Ade+ vs Ade- cells and
found it to be 45-70%. We isolated genomic DNA and proceeded with the standard SATAY procedure as previously
described (Michel et al., 2017).
