Significance: Intermittent Hypoxia is a hallmark of sleep apnea and decreases the threshold for cognitive
deficit. We demonstrate that intermittent hypoxia-dependent HIF1a signaling contributes to impairments in
hippocampal associated memory. This is co-incidental with HIF1a-mediated alternations in synaptic physiology
and increased oxidative stress.

Key points

32

•

Intermittent hypoxia (IH) is a hallmark of sleep apnea and is known to cause learning and memory deficits.

33

•

Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1a (HIF1a), is associated with IH-dependent changes in physiology.

34
35

•

IH exposure causes increased hippocampal HIF1a in wild type mice and is associated with elevated
oxidative stress, impairments to spatial memory, and suppression of long term potentiation (LTP).

36
37

•

IH-dependent suppression of LTP is co-incidental with diminished NMDA receptor contribution to
glutamatergic transmission.

38
39

•

Following IH, mice heterozygous for HIF1a (HIF1a+/-) do not show an increase in HIF1a and oxidative
stress, or changes in either behavior or glutamatergic transmission.

Abstract: Intermittent hypoxia (IH), a key feature of sleep apnea, increases the oxygen regulated

42

transcription factor Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1a (HIF1a). Although recognized for its role in IH-

43

dependent changes in cardio-respiratory physiology, it remains unclear how IH-dependent HIF1a

44

signaling affects neurophysiology underlying learning and memory. This study examines how IH

45

affects hippocampal associated learning and memory in wildtype mice and mice heterozygous for the

46

HIF1a gene (HIF1a+/-). In wild-type mice, ten days of IH impaired performance in the Barnes maze

47

increased hippocampal HIF1a and elevated protein carbonyls. These behavioral and biochemical

48

effects of IH were accompanied by a decrease in the N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAr) and an

49

attenuation of long-term potentiation (LTP) in area CA1. In HIF1a+/-, IH did not impair Barnes maze

50

performance, increase hippocampal HIF1a, or enhance protein carbonyl content. At the network level,

51

IH neither led to a decrease in NMDAr nor impaired LTP. Concurrent antioxidant treatment during IH

52

mitigated the IH-dependent effects on the Barnes maze performance and LTP in wildtype mice. Our

53

findings indicate that IH-dependent HIF1a signaling leads to oxidative stress and reduces NMDAr to

54

impair LTP in area CA1, which contributes to IH-dependent deficits in learning and memory associated

55

with the hippocampus.

Introduction:

58

While sleep apnea is recognized as a risk factor for cardiorespiratory dysfunction, this condition also decreases

59

the threshold for cognitive impairment (Devita et al., 2017; Leng et al., 2017). Similarly, intermittent hypoxia

60

(IH), a hallmark of sleep apnea, has been shown to cause both autonomic dysfunction (Fang and Chen, 1973;

61

Lesske et al., 1997; Greenberg et al., 1999) and memory deficits (Wallace and Bucks, 2013). At the cellular

62

level, exposure to IH increases hypoxia inducible factor 1a (HIF1a), a ubiquitous transcription factor regulated

63

by the state of oxygenation. Although commonly recognized as a crucial mediator of cellular adaptations to

64

hypoxia, HIF1a has been implicated as a critical factor facilitating maladaptive changes in cardiorespiratory

65

physiology caused by IH (Prabhakar, 2016). However, the role of HIF1a signaling in IH-dependent changes to

66

the neurophysiology remains poorly understood.

67

The hippocampal formation is important for learning and memory (Morris et al., 1982) and has been frequently

68

identified as a brain region affected in sleep apnea (Kuwabara et al., 2009; Encinas et al., 2011; Licht et al.,

69

2011; Macey et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2019; Owen et al., 2019). Biochemical studies have documented IH-

70

dependent increases in hippocampal HIF1a protein (Chou et al., 2013; Wall et al., 2014) and oxidative stress

71

within the brain (Nair et al., 2011; Chou et al., 2013). Neurophysiological investigations have also documented

72

that IH exposure leads to deficits in spatial learning and memory (Row et al., 2002; Row et al., 2003) which

73

coincide with weakened hippocampal LTP in area CA1 (Gozal et al., 2002; Goldbart et al., 2003; Payne et al.,

74

2004; Xie et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2012; Wall et al., 2014). HIF1a signaling may have an important protective

75

pro-survival role in the brain preserving function in response to the hypoxia experienced during IH.

76

Alternatively, HIF1a may serve as a pro-oxidant transcription factor leading to oxidative stress and impaired

77

neurophysiology.

78

To better resolve the role of IH-dependent increases in HIF1a, we examine how IH affects behavior and

79

synaptic physiology in wildtype mice and mice heterozygous for HIF1a (HIF1a+/-). Impaired performance on the

80

Barnes maze was evident following IH.

81

oxidative stress, a decreased contribution of the NMDA receptor (NMDAr) to the field excitatory postsynaptic

82

potential (fEPSP), and suppression of LTP. In contrast, IH neither impaired behavioral performance nor caused

83

hippocampal oxidative stress in HIF1a +/-. HIF1a+/- exposed to IH did exhibit a decrease in NMDAr contribution

This phenotype was co-incidental with increased hippocampal

84

to the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) or show an attenuation in LTP. These findings indicate

85

that enhanced HIF1a signaling is a significant factor contributing to IH-dependent changes in synaptic

86

physiology and spatial learning and memory associated with the hippocampus.

Methods:

89

Study Approval. In accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines, all animal protocols were

90

performed with approval from the Institute of Animal Care and Use Committee at The University of Chicago.

91

Animals. Animals were housed in AAALAC-approved facilities with a 12 hour/12 hour light-dark cycle and

92

given ad libitum access to food and water. Experiments were performed on wildtype mice and HIF1a +/- (Iyer et

93

al., 1998), (Peng et al., 2006) from both sexes (P50 to P70). All animals were maintained on a C57BL/6

94

background. Automated genotyping was performed independently by a commercial service (Transnetyx Inc).

95

Intermittent hypoxia (IH) exposure. Male and female mice (P60-P80) were exposed to chronic intermittent

96

hypoxia for ten consecutive days (IH10). In brief, as previously described (Peng et al., 2003), the IH10 paradigm

97

was performed in a special chamber during the light cycle and lasted 8 hours per day (i.e., 80 intermittent

98

hypoxia cycles/day). A single hypoxic cycle was achieved by flowing 100% N 2 into the chamber for

99

approximately 60s (nadir O2 reached 4.5±1.5% and followed immediately by an air break (~21% O2; 300s).

100

In a subset of animals, manganese (III) tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridyl) porphyrin (MnTMPyP, Enzo Life Sciences,

101

CAT #: ALX-430-070), was administered via intraperitoneal injection at the beginning of each day prior to

102

exposure to IH. Previous reports have indicated that dose of MnTMPyP at either 5mg/kg (Peng et al., 2013) or

103

15mg/kg (Khuu et al., 2019) can mitigate the effects of IH in the nervous system. Therefore, the smaller dose

104

(5 mg/kg, n=3 mice) and the larger dose (15mg/kg, n=4 mice) were used but no differences were evident

105

between dosage groups; and therefore, the data at the two concentrations were pooled.

106

Barnes maze. The Barnes maze was performed using a custom made opaque white circular acrylic platform

107

(92.4 cm in diameter) with 20 equidistant holes (5.08 cm in diameter and 2.54 cm from the edge). The platform

108

was elevated (30 cm from the floor) ground and surrounded by four identical walls (27.94 cm high). By default,

109

each hole was closed with a fixed piece of opaque acrylic that could be removed to lead to a dark exit box.

110

Lighting was achieved through diffuse overhead fluorescent lighting such that all holes were equally lit. An

111

overhead camera was suspended above the maze. Data collection and posthoc analysis was performed using

112

CinePlex Video Tracking System (Plexon, Dallas, TX).

113

As previously described (Christakis et al., 2012), the task was performed using a four-day protocol consisting

114

of one training trial per day for three consecutive days and a probe trial on the fourth day. Barnes Maze began

115

on the seventh day of IH10 exposure with respective controls run at the same time. For the training trials, all but

116

one of the holes (exit hole) was closed. An exit box with a small ramp was placed directly underneath the exit

117

hole. Animals were given a maximum of 6 minutes to locate the exit and if unable to locate the exit, they were

118

gently guided to the exit. If the mouse found and entered the exit before the six minutes was over, the trial

119

ended at the time that the mouse entered the exit and the mouse was promptly returned to its home cage.

120

During the probe trial, all holes were closed, and the animal was given 6 minutes to explore the maze. The

121

entire arena was sanitized in-between trials. Following the end of behavior, IH animals were immediately

122

returned to the IH chamber. For animals in the MnTMPyP group, MnTMPyP was administered after the daily

123

behavioral testing, but prior to the return to the IH chamber.

124

Slice Preparation. As previously described (Khuu et al., 2019), acute coronal hippocampal slices were

125

prepared from mice unexposed to intermittent hypoxia (control) or from mice exposed to IH for ten days (IH 10).

126

Tissue harvest occurred within one to two days following IH10. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and

127

euthanized via rapid decapitation. The cerebrum was immediately harvested and blocked, rinsed with cold

128

artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), and mounted for vibratome sectioning. The mounted brain tissue was

129

submerged in aCSF (4°C; equilibrated with 95% O 2, 5% CO2) and coronal cortico-hippocampal brain slices

130

(350 µm thick) were prepared. Slices were then immediately transferred into a holding chamber containing

131

aCSF equilibrated with 95% O2, 5% CO2 (at 20.5±1°C). Slices were allowed to recover for a minimum of one

132

hour prior to recording and used up to eight hours following tissue harvest. The composition of aCSF (in mM):

133

118 NaCl, 10 glucose, 20 sucrose, 25 NaHCO3, 3.0 KCl, 1.5 CaCl2, 1.0 NaH2PO4 and 1.0 MgCl2.

134

Extracellular recording of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential. For electrophysiological recordings,

135

slices were transferred to a recording chamber with recirculating aCSF (30.5±1°C, equilibrated with 95% O2

136

and 5% CO2) and allowed 15 min to acclimate to the recording environment. The fEPSP in the CA1 was

137

evoked by electrical stimulation. The stimulation electrode was positioned in Schaffer Collateral and recording

138

electrode (1-2 MΩ) was placed into the stratum radiatum of the CA1. The intensity of the electrical current

139

(100-400 µA; 0.1-0.2 ms duration) was set to the minimum amount of current required to generate ~50 % of

140

the maximal initial slope (mi) of the fEPSP. The current stimulus to evoked fEPSP relationship was examined

141

across range of stimuli between 0 to 700 microamperes (µA), sampled at intervals of 50 µA 0.2ms duration.

142

This relationship was examined in aCSF, Mg2+ free aCSF, and Mg2+ free aCSF with 20 µM APV (Sigma-

143

Aldrich, MN). The composition of Mg2+ free aCSF (in mM): 119.5 NaCl, 10 glucose, 20 sucrose, 25 NaHCO3,

144

3.0 KCl, 1.5 CaCl2, 1.0 NaH2PO4. The NaCl was increased to 119.5 mM to keep osmolarity from changing

145

when switching from aCSF to Mg 2+ free aCSF. The fEPSP was evoked every 20 s. After 10 minutes of

146

recording the baseline fEPSP, LTP was induced using high frequency stimulation (HFS). HFS consisted four

147

500 msec trains of stimuli (100 Hz) given at 30 sec intervals. The fEPSP slope was normalized to baseline

148

values (prior to HFS).

152

(Molecular Devices: https: www.moleculardevices.com/system/axon-conventional-patch-clamp/pclamp-11-

154

Western Blot. Western blot assays were performed using hippocampal tissue homogenates for quantitative

155

analysis of HIF1a (R and D Systems Cat# AF1935, RRID:AB_355064) and PCNA (Bethyl Cat# A300-276A,

156

RRID:AB_263393) content. Stepwise separation of cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extracts were prepared by

157

NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit (Thermo Scientific, 78833) by following manufactures

158

instructions. Briefly, cytoplasmic fragment was obtained by homogenizing tissue using a tissue grinder and

159

then by pipetting in cytoplasmic extraction buffers. After isolation of cytoplasmic fragment, the insoluble pellet

160

that contains nuclear proteins was suspended in nuclear extraction buffer and separated by centrifugation. Halt

161

Protease Inhibitor (Thermo Scientific, 1860932) was added into cytoplasmic and nuclear extraction buffers to

162

prevent protein degradation. All analyses were conducted by Raybiotech, Inc. (Norcross, GA), using the

163

automated Capillary Electrophoresis Immunoassay machine (WES™, ProteinSimple Santa Clara, CA). The

165

substrate were dispensed into designated wells in the manufacturer provided microplate. After plate loading,

166

the separation electrophoresis and immunodetection steps took place in the capillary system and were fully

167

automated. Auto Western analysis was carried out at room temperature, and instrument default settings were

168

used.

169

Protein Carbonyls. Whole cell protein lysates were isolated from hippocampal tissues by using M-PER

170

mammalian protein extraction reagent (Thermo Scientific, 78501) and by adding Halt Protease Inhibitor

171

(Thermo Scientific, 1860932). Protein lysates were immediately processed or kept in -80oC until used. The

172

amount of protein carbonyls was determined using a Protein Carbonyl Colorimetric Assay Kit (Cayman

173

Chemical, Cat#10005020), per manufacturer instructions and absorbance was measured at a wavelength

174

between 360-385 nm using a plate reader. Protein content was determined using a Protein Determination Kit

175

(Cayman Chemical, Cat# 704002) and absorbance was measured at 595 nm using a Nanodrop 2000

176

spectrophotometer (Thermofisher, Cat# ND-2000).

Experimental Design and Statistical Analyses. All n values are total number of animals, unless otherwise

178

noted. Statistics were performed using Origin 8 Pro (OriginLab, RRID:SCR_014212) or Prism 6 (GraphPad

179

Software; RRID:SCR_015807). Comparisons between two groups were conducted using unpaired two-tailed t

180

tests with Welch’s correction. To compare three groups, a one-way ANOVA was performed followed by a

181

posthoc Tukey’s multiple comparison test or Dunnett’s test, as appropriate. To assess the fEPSP across a

182

range of stimuli, a two-way ANOVA was performed followed by a Bonferroni post-test for significance. Results

183

are presented as mean ± S.E.M. were considered significant when the P-value was less than 0.05.

Results:

187

HIF1a protein content was measured in nuclear extracts prepared from wildtype hippocampi unexposed to IH

188

(control) and wildtype hippocampi exposed to ten days of IH (IH 10). Nuclear HIF1a was approximately two

189

times greater in extracts from IH10 when compared to control (Figure 1A, control n=5, IH10 n=4, P=0.019). In

190

contrast, nuclear hippocampal HIF1a was unchanged in extracts from hippocampi of HIF1a +/- mice unexposed

191

to IH (0-HIF1a+/-) when compared to tissue originating from HIF1a +/- mice exposed to ten days of IH (10-

192

HIF1a+/-) (Figure 1B, 0-HIF1a+/-, n=4, 10-HIF1a+/- n=4, P=0.84).

193

IH-dependent increases in HIF1a protein are mitigated in mice possessing a single copy of the gene.

194

To determine the behavioral consequences of IH on wildtype mice and HIF1a +/-, we examined spatial learning

195

and memory by assessing performance in a Barnes maze apparatus for four experimental groups: wildtype

196

unexposed mice (control, n=11), wildtype mice exposed to ten days of IH (IH10, n=10), HIF1a+/- mice

197

unexposed to IH (0-HIF1a+/-, n=7), and HIF1a+/- mice exposed to ten days of IH (10-HIF1a+/-, n=8). During

198

training, control and IH10 exhibited progressive improvement on locating the exit zone as indicated by the

199

decrease in latency to exit over course of three training sessions (Figure 2A and 2B). 0-HIF1a+/- and 10-

200

HIF1a+/- groups displayed similar performance during training (Figure 2C and 2D). During the probe trial (when

201

the exit was closed), performance of each group was assessed by examining: 1) distance travelled to the exit

202

zone; 2) primary latency to exit zone entry; and 3) probability to exit zone entry.

203

The distance travelled to the exit zone was greater in IH10 when compared to control (control: 2.60 ± 0.70 m

204

versus IH10: 10.34 ± 3.32m, P=0.048). Similarly, larger primary latency to exit zone entry was observed in IH10

205

(Figure 3B, control: 22.60 ± 6.28 sec versus IH10: 117.90 ± 37.47m, P=0.034). In contrast, 0-HIF1a+/- mice to

206

10-HIF1a+/ mice were similar in distance travelled to the exit zone (Figure 3C, 0-HIF1a+/-=2.37 ± 0.91 m, 10-

207

HIF1a+/-=1.71 ± 0.50 m; P=0.55), and primary latency to exit zone entry (Figure 3D, 0-HIF1a+/-=35.18 ± 12.28

208

sec, 10-HIF1a+/-=: 61.61 ± 26.30 sec; P=0.39).

209

Examining the probability to exit zone entry demonstrated that control consistently discriminated the location of

210

exit hole against the other holes (Figure 3E left). However, in IH10, this was not apparent (Figure 3E center).

211

These observations reflected in a difference between control and IH10 (Figure 3E right; control: 15.93 ± 2.39%

212

versus IH10: 6.44 ± 1.38%, P=0.004). In contrast, entry probability into the exit zone for 0-HIF1a+/- and

213

10-HIF1a+/ was similar between both groups (Figure 3F, 0-HIF1a+/-=8.75 ± 1.38%, 10-HIF1a+/-=15.51 ± 4.73%

214

m; P=0.21).

215

The IH-dependent differences in Barnes maze performance may be related to potential differences in synaptic

216

physiology. To address this possibility, we characterized unpotentiated and potentiated synaptic transmission

217

in hippocampal brain slices from the four experimental groups. In slices from wildtype mice, IH did not impact

218

the maximal fiber volley (control= 0.32 ± 0.12 mV, n=4; IH10= 0.34 ± 0.08 mV, n=5; P=0.90) or the maximal
8

These findings demonstrate that

219

unpotentiated fEPSP (control= 1.21 ± 0.20 mV, n=8; IH10= 1.03 ± 0.11 mV, n=10; P=0.41). No differences

220

between groups were found in the stimulus intensity current to fiber volley relationship in aCSF, in Mg2+-free

221

media, or in Mg2+-free media with the competitive NMDAr blocker, APV (data not shown). Comparing the

222

evoked fEPSP at 700 A revealed that synaptic transmission from control and IH10 were similar in aCSF

223

(Figure 4A, control n=5, IH10 n=8, comparison at 700A: P>0.05) and in Mg2+-free media (Figure 4B,

224

comparison at 700A: P>0.05). However, in APV, fEPSP amplitude was larger in IH10 (Figure 4C, comparison

225

at 700A: P<0.05), indicating contribution of ionotropic glutamate receptors to the fEPSP change following IH.

226

In slices from HIF1a+/- animals, the maximal fiber volley (0-HIF1a+/-= 0.32 ± 0.12 mV, n=4; 10-HIF1a+/-= 0.34 ±

227

0.08 mV, n=5; P=0.90) as well as the maximal fEPSP (0-HIF1a+/-= 0.63 ± 0.06 mV, n=7; 10-HIF1a+/-= 1.13 ±

228

0.11 mV, n=8; P=0.0003) were consistently smaller in 0-HIF1a+/- when compared to 10-HIF1a+/-. The fiber

229

volley was undetectable when evoked sub-maximally; therefore, we were unable to compare the stimulus

230

intensity-fiber volley relationship between 0-HIF1a+/- and 10-HIF1a+/-. Differences in the stimulus intensity-

231

fEPSP relationship were present between 0-HIF1a+/- and 10-HIF1a+/- in aCSF (Figure 4D, comparison at

232

700A: P<0.05) as well as Mg2+-free media (Figure 4E, comparison at 700A: P<0.05) but were no longer

233

present in APV (Figure 4F, comparison at 700A: P>0.05).

234

The NMDAr contributes to the prolonging of decay time of the fEPSP. Therefore, we also examined decay time

235

of the fEPSP in Mg2+-free media with and without APV. The NMDAr blocker reduced the decay time by

236

-70 ± 11% in the control group (n=5); whereas, in the IH10 group (n=8) APV reduced the decay time of fEPSP

237

by -28 ± 16%. When comparing these changes, the effectiveness of APV was greater in control as compared

238

to IH10 (Figure 5A, P=0.016). However, reduction in decay time of the fEPSP by APV was similar between

239

0-HIF1a+/- (-24 ± 12%, n=7) and 10-HIF1a+/- (-36 ± 11%n=8) (Figure 5B, P=0.46) further supporting an IH-

240

dependent reduction in the NMDAr. These findings suggest that IH acts to reduce NMDAr through a HIF1a

241

mediated mechanism.

242

To examine the consequence that reduced NMDAr contribution may have on synaptic plasticity, we evoked

243

LTP using HFS. HFS evoked LTP in area CA1 from both control and IH10 (Figure 6A, control n=7, IH10 n=11).

244

No differences between experimental groups were observed in the fEPSP immediately following post-tetanic

245

stimulation (Figure 6B, control=129±9% versus IH10=117±3% P=0.26). However, at 60 min following HFS, the

246

magnitude of LTP in the control versus the IH10 group was larger (Figure 6C, control=162±12% IH10=122±7%,

247

P=0.015). In the HIF1a+/- group, HFS evoked LTP in 0-HIF1a+/- (n=4) and in 10-HIF1a+/- (n=6) was similar

following HFS (Figure 6E, 0-HIF1a+/-=117 ± 6.72%, 10-HIF1a+/-=125 ±12.15%, P=0.59), and 60 min following

250

HFS (Figure 6F, 0-HIF1a+/-=137 ± 21.47%, 10-HIF1a+/-=151.9 ± 9.58%, P=0.56).

251

We next sought to determine whether IH caused increased oxidative stress by measuring protein carbonyl

252

content in hippocampal homogenates from control (n=4), IH10 (n=4), 0-HIF1a+/- (n=4), and 10-HIF1a+/- (n=4).

253

Relative to the control, protein carbonyl content was elevated in IH 10 (Figure 7, P<0.01) but protein carbonyl

254

content was not changed in homogenates from either 0-HIF1a+/- or 10-HIF1a+/- (Figure 7). These findings

255

indicate that hippocampal oxidative stress is a downstream consequence of enhanced HIF1a signaling due to

256

IH exposure. To determine the involvement of oxidative stress in the Barnes Maze performance and synaptic

257

of physiology in area CA1, wildtype mice treated with the antioxidant MnTMPyP, for 10 days without IH

258

exposure (0-MnTMPyP, n=9) and during exposure to 10 days of IH (10-MnTMPyP n=7). Both groups exhibited

259

improvement in exiting the maze with training (Figure 8A). During the probe trial, neither latency to first entry

260

(0-MnMTPyP = 24 ± 7sec, 10MnTMPyP = 38±15sec; P=0.42) nor path length (0-MnMTPyP = 0.25 ± 0.08m,

261

10-MnTMPyP = 0.29 ± 0.05 sec; P=0.70) was different between 0-MnTMPyP and 10-MnTMP. Additionally, the

262

probability of entering the exit zone during the probe trial was similar between groups (Figure 8A). In

263

hippocampal slices from 10-MnTMPyP (n=8), LTP was readily evoked (Figure 8B). However, when comparing

264

the magnitude of LTP in control, IH10 and 10-MnTMPyP revealed that the magnitude of LTP in 10-MnTMPyP

265

was neither different when compared to control or to IH10 (Figure 8C, One-ANOVA followed by a Tukey’s

266

multiple comparisons test).

The strength of potentiation in 0-HIF1a+/- and in 10-HIF1a+/- was comparable immediately

Discussion

269

Consistent with previous reports that assess how intermittent hypoxia impacts spatial learning and memory

270

(Wallace and Bucks, 2013; Varga et al., 2014; Gildeh et al., 2016), we observed that IH10 disrupted

271

performance in the Barnes maze. This disruption coincided with increased HIF1a, increased oxidative stress,

272

changes in ionotropic glutamate receptors, and impaired LTP.

Heterozygosity in HIF1a prevented IH-

273

dependent changes to hippocampal biochemistry, the attenuation of synaptic plasticity in area CA1, and

274

performance deficits in the Barnes maze. Antioxidant administration did not fully attenuate the effects of IH on

275

the performance of wildtype mice in the Barnes maze, or on synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.

276

When evaluating behavioral performance in the Barnes maze, both control and IH 10 groups progressively

277

improved with training, yet prominent differences were present during the probe trial. In addition to the larger

278

primary latency and primary distance traveled following IH, we observed a decrease in the accuracy and

279

precision of locating the exit zone in wildtype mice following IH. These behavioral differences coincided with

280

IH-dependent attenuation of LTP. Our electrophysiological experiments also indicated that IH attenuates the

281

contribution of NMDAr, which would lead to a reduction in NMDAr-dependent Ca2+ entry into neurons and

282

diminish the downstream intracellular signaling critical to LTP.

283

The IH-mediated pro-oxidant condition may have influenced the activity of the NMDAr, as oxidative modulation

284

of the receptor is a well-documented phenomenon (Choi and Lipton, 2000; Lipton et al., 2002; Kumar, 2015;

285

Foster et al., 2017) . Alternatively, IH may have downregulated the expression of the functional receptor in the

286

hippocampus.

287

obligatory subunit for the functional NMDAr, cell density in the cortex and area CA1 (Gozal et al., 2001).

288

Independent of cause, the reduced contribution of the NMDAr appeared to be accompanied by IH-dependent

289

increase in the relative contribution of AMPAr as the fEPSP from control and IH10 were similarly stimulated by

290

Mg2+-free media yet differentially affected by APV. In cancer cells, the AMPAr subunit proteins GRIA2 and the

291

GRIA3 increases with hypoxia and appears to involve HIF1 signaling (Hu et al., 2014). Thus, our observations

292

indicate that IH-dependent behavioral performance deficits are associated with a reduction in long-term

293

synaptic plasticity and a remodeling of the glutamatergic receptors within the hippocampus.

294

Employing pharmacological means or IH to enhance HIF1a in the hippocampus correlated with the

295

suppression of LTP in area CA1 (Wall et al., 2014). Similarly, oxidative stress has been implicated as a

296

significant factor that could influence neurophysiological and behavioral outcomes in response to IH (Xu et al.,

297

2004).

300

(CHOP) is genetically ablated, oxidative stress and HIF1a was not elevated in area CA1 of rodents exposed to

301

IH, suggesting a potential relationship between HIF1a and oxidative stress (Chou et al., 2013). IH did not

302

cause an increase in nuclear HIF1a, or lead to enhanced protein carbonyl content HIF1a +/-. These findings are

303

consistent with the idea that IH-dependent HIF1a signaling causes oxidative stress.

304

No performance deficits caused by IH were observed in HIF1a +/- mice. At the circuit level, IH strengthened

305

glutamatergic transmission as the relationship between current stimulus and the fEPSP, by enhancing

306

contribution of NMDAr and in tissue from 10-HIF1a+/-. Combined with our observations in wildtype mice, IH

307

appears to upregulate AMPAr contribution and downregulate NMDAr contribution. While downregulation of

308

NMDAr appears to be dependent on HIF1a, it is unclear whether AMPAr upregulation was HIF1a dependent.

309

Together with our observations in wildtype mice, IH-dependent HIF1a signaling appears to be important for

310

determining the consequences of IH on hippocampal synaptic physiology and hippocampal associated

311

behaviors.

312

In wildtype mice, IH caused an increase in protein carbonyl content, a measure of oxidative stress within the

313

hippocampus. However, in HIF1a+/- no such increase was observed following IH. Although we did not identify

314

the source of oxidative stress, we demonstrated that antioxidant supplementation using MnTMPyP, to

315

scavenge superoxide anion produced by IH, mitigated many of the IH-mediated changes to behavior and

316

synaptic plasticity. When compared to 0-MnTMPyP, mice receiving MnTMPyP during IH exposure (i.e., 10-

317

MnTMPyP) did not exhibit performance deficits in the Barnes Maze. However, LTP in slices from 10-MnTMPyP

318

was neither similar to LTP recorded in slices from control nor different from LTP evoked in tissue from mice

319

exposed to IH. These findings were unexpected, as antioxidant administration prevented both oxidative stress

320

and behavioral impairments caused by IH (Row et al., 2003). Similarly, MnTMPyP has been shown to mitigate

321

many of the consequences of IH throughout nervous system (Kumar et al., 2006; Peng et al., 2013; Garcia et

322

al., 2016). However, treatment with MnTMPyP may have unique effects in area CA1.

323

MnTMPyP has been shown to block LTP induction in area CA1 of hippocampal slices (Klann, 1998). This

324

raised the possibility that in vivo MnTMPyP treatment could have caused interference with mechanisms

325

common to in vitro LTP and spatial learning and memory associated with area CA1. Alternatively, IH may also

326

act independently of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to affect area CA1 and/or other brain networks involved

328

independent expansion of the neuroprogenitor pool involved with adult hippocampal neurogenesis (Khuu et al.,

329

2019). Thus, mechanisms independent of ROS may also be involved in influencing synaptic plasticity, learning,

330

and memory, but this possibility requires further investigation.

331

In conclusion, our study has demonstrated that IH causes deficits in hippocampal associated behavior, which

332

is correlated with changes in synaptic properties and a weakening in LTP within area CA1 of the hippocampus.

333

We have also shown that HIF1a and oxidative stress appear to be significant factors in dictating these IH-

334

dependent outcomes at the local circuit and behavioral levels. As a result, we have established a working

335

model by which IH-dependent HIF1a signaling acts to cause oxidative stress, remodel glutamatergic synapses,

336

weaken synaptic plasticity, and impair learning and memory.

For example, we have recently demonstrated that IH can cause a ROS-
