Summary Paragraph:
TDP-43 is an essential DNA/RNA processing protein that undergoes both functional and pathogenic
aggregation. Functional TDP-43 aggregates are reversible, forming transient species such as nuclear
bodies, stress granules, and myo-granules1–3. In contrast pathogenic TDP-43 aggregates are irreversible,
forming stable intracellular amyloid-like inclusions4,5. These inclusions are the primary pathology of
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions
(FTLD-TDP)6. Disease-associated, hereditary mutations in TDP-43 are known to accelerate the
deposition of irreversible aggregates in the cytoplasm7. Reversible TDP-43 aggregation has been shown
to precede the formation of irreversible amyloid fibrils similar to the behavior of proteins hnRNPA1 and
FUS8–10. Still unknown, however, are the structural features of TDP-43 fibrils that confer both
reversibility and irreversibility and how hereditary mutations can impose irreversible aggregation. Here,
we determined the structures of amyloid fibrils formed by two segments previously reported to be the
pathogenic cores of TDP-43 aggregation7,11,12; these are termed SegA (residues 311-360) and SegB
A315E (residues 286-331 containing the ALS hereditary mutation A315E). SegA forms three

polymorphs, all with dagger-shaped folds. SegB forms R-shaped folds. All four polymorphs have folds
confined to two dimensions, and are stabilized by hydrophobic cores and peripheral hydrogen bonds.
Energetic analysis suggests that the dagger-shaped polymorphs are examples of the irreversible fibril
structures of TDP-43, whereas the SegB polymorph may participate in both reversible and irreversible
fibril structure. Our structure suggests how the A315E mutation may convert this polymorph to the
irreversible type and lead to mutation-enhanced pathology.

Main text:
Amyloid-forming proteins seem to violate the central tenant of protein science—that amino acid sequence
determines structure and function13. In contrast to globular and membrane proteins each of which folds
into a single functional structure, a given amyloid-forming sequence can fold into several distinctly
different polymorphic structures14,15. Here we find that TDP-43, known to form both reversible functional
aggregates and irreversible pathogenic aggregates, exhibits polymorphic behavior. This complex protein
thus offers an intriguing opportunity for structural exploration.

Irreversible, hyperphosphorylated aggregates of C-terminal segments of TDP-43 are found in the
autopsied brains of ALS and FTLD-TDP patients6,16,17. These aggregates have also been found in
Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, CTE, Huntington’s disease and inclusion body myopathies (IBMs), among
others18–21. Because TDP-43 functions in several essential steps of RNA metabolism22,23, it is widely
considered that TDP-43 aggregation is toxic through a loss-of-function mechanism24–26. Structural studies
of amyloid fibrils of β-amyloid27,28, tau29,30, α-synuclein14, and β2-microglobulin31 have revealed
polymorphs and insights into pathogenesis. Here, we use cryo-EM to determine the overall folds of TDP-

43 amyloid cores, expanding structural information beyond the local interactions previously revealed by
crystallography32,33.

We obtained TDP-43 fibrils by incubating SUMO-tagged TDP-43 segments in the test tube after
the cleavage of SUMO tag (Supplementary Figure 1a). We first aimed to produce fibrils formed by fulllength TDP-43, a pathogenic C-terminal fragment (CTF, 208-414) – truncation product that is enriched in
disease brain34, or by the Low Complexity Domain (LCD, 274-414) which is considered to be necessary
for TDP-43 aggregation32,35,36. However, despite our efforts at optimization, we could observe only highly
clumped fibril-like structures and/or disordered aggregates that are not suitable for cryoEM structure
determination (See Supplementary Figure 1b top panel). We suspect that this may be due to the ability of
longer constructs of TDP-43 to participate in multi-valent interactions, possibly through LARKS32,37 or
other adhesive segments outside the LCD33. These multi-valent interactions have been shown to assemble
networks of protein chains and could conceivably explain why longer segments of TDP-43 form
amorphous aggregates or fibril clumps not amenable to cryoEM structure determination. This observation
is in line with TDP-43’s role in phase separation and stress granule formation, which requires the
presence of multi-valent interactions37.

To overcome the hurdle of the disordered assembly of longer segments of TDP-43, we
implemented a “divide and conquer” approach whereby we selected known aggregation cores for
structure determination. We chose SegA (residues 311-360) and SegB (residues 286-331), guided by the
following evidence. SegA was previously identified as an aggregation core of TDP-43 due to the
observation that its deletion decreases TDP-43 aggregation in vitro and in cells, whereas addition of SegA
to the aggregation-resistant C. elegans TDP-43 homolog induces aggregation11. Fibrils of SegB are toxic

to primary neurons, and an ALS hereditary mutation A315T together with phosphorylation of the
threonine, which is speculated to occur in hyper-phosphorylated aggregates of TDP-43 in disease,
increases SegB’s cytotoxicity7. With this in mind, we selected SegB A315E – another hereditary
mutation with similar effects as A315T7,38–40 and a mimic of A315T with phosphorylation – in order to
visualize the structure of a second possible TDP-43 aggregation core and to gain insight into the
molecular mechanism of mutation-enhanced TDP-43 pathology. The importance of SegA and SegB in
full-length TDP-43 aggregation is also supported by other studies which found that amyloid fibrils
containing either a core region (residues 314-353) of SegA or region (residues 274-313) similar to SegB
can template aggregation of full-length TDP-43 in SH-SY5Y human neuronal cells41. Likewise, in the
same cell line, deletion of these two regions (residues 314-353 or 274-313) from full-length TDP-43
inhibits aggregation. As we expected, fibrils formed by SegA and SegB A315E were much more
homogenous and less bundled than longer segments of TDP-43, including SegAB (286-360) that contains
both aggregation cores SegA and SegB (Supplementary Figure 1b). This observation supports the idea
that eliminating competing multi-valent interactions helps to produce homogenous fibrils of isolated
amyloid cores. Using these homogenous preparations, we determined three polymorphic fibril structures
of SegA (termed SegA-sym, SegA-asym, and SegA-slow) and one of SegB A315E (Figure 1,
Supplementary Figure 2-4 and Supplementary Table 1, see Methods for technical details).

range of residues visualized in the structure of each polymorph. Panels b-e: (left) fibril reconstructions
showing left-handed twist and pitch; (middle) density and atomic model of one cross-sectional layer of
each fibril; (right) schematic model showing protein chain (blue) and residues (hydrophobic in yellow,
polar in green, glycine in pink, glutamate in red, and arginine in blue).

All four fibrils are formed from gradually twisting β-sheets that run the entire length of the fibrils
(Figure 1b-e). A thin slab or “layer” perpendicular to each fibril axis (Figure 1, middle) shows that
individual SegA and SegB chains are each confined within an essentially two-dimensional layer, in
contrast to globular and membrane proteins whose folds occupy three-dimensions. Identical layers stack
on one another creating β-sheets that are parallel and in-register. Each layer contains two or more protein
chains, giving rise to a corresponding number of protofilaments in the fibril.

SegA polymorphs all share a dagger-shaped fold comprised of residues 312-346 and a sharp 160°
kink at Gln327, which forms the dagger tip (Figure 2a-d, Supplementary Figure 5a-c, detailed comparison
see Supplementary Note 1&2). The three SegA polymorphs mainly differ in the number of
protofilaments and symmetry. SegA-sym fibrils contain two protofilaments related by a pseudo-21 axis,
whereas SegA-asym contains two protofilaments with somewhat different conformations. SegA-slow
fibrils contain four protofilaments; two protofilaments are related by a central 2-fold axis and contain 50
ordered residues. These are flanked by two other protofilaments containing only 10 ordered residues.
We note that SegA-sym and SegA-asym structures are compatible with full-length TDP-43 due to their
free N-and C-termini, whereas the SegA-slow structure is an artifact of the truncation since the N- and Ctermini are sequestered in the center of the fibrils (Figure 1d and Supplementary Figure 5b). Therefore, in

the following analysis, we mostly focus on SegA-sym and SegA-asym. However, we note that SegAslow provides valuable information, including validation of the dagger-shaped fold owing to its higher
resolution and direct atomic evidence of secondary nucleation (Supplementary Note 3).

SegB A315E forms fibrils of a single morphology, in contrast to polymorphic SegA. These fibrils
are characterized by an R-shaped fold spanning residues 288-319 (Figure 2e&f and Supplementary Note
4). Overall, the R-shaped fold is more highly kinked than the dagger-shaped fold (Figure 1b-e), probably
due to the abundance of glycine residues. Each fibril is wound from four protofilaments (Figure 2e). The
two inner protofilaments are related through a tight, pseudo-21 symmetric interface (Figure 2e&g,
Supplementary Note 5). These protofilaments are flanked by two outer protofilaments through an
asymmetric interface involving outer residues 289-304 and inner residues 289 and 306-318 (Figure 2e&g,
Supplementary Note 5). Small conformational differences between inner and outer R-folds (Figure 2f)
recall the positional polymorphism observed in a different, shorter TDP-43 segment33.

In all four R-folds we observe a salt-bridge between Arg293 and Glu315 enabled by the
pathogenic A315E mutation. The Arg293-Glu315 salt-bridge is not formed by the residues from the same
layer along the fibril axis. Rather, each Arg293 interacts with the Glu315 from one or two layers above
(Figure 2h), which may affect the kinetics of fibril growth and nucleation. This salt-bridge suggests a
mechanistic explanation for the inclination of A315E toward TDP-43 pathology. Model building

suggests that wild-type SegB can form the same R-shaped fold as A315E, with Ala315 participating in a
hydrophobic interaction with Ala297 and Phe313. This hypothesis is supported by the similar stability
and morphology of wild-type SegB fibrils in our themostability assays (Supplementary Figure 1c)
compared to SegB A315E fibrils and is also supported by the cross-seeding ability of SegB and SegB
A315E (Supplementary Figure 1e).

It is noteworthy that although TDP-43 can form either the dagger-shaped polymorph of SegA or
the R-shaped polymorph of SegB, it is unlikely that a given molecule of TDP-43 can form both
simultaneously. This exclusivity is indicated by a superposition of the two folds in the overlapping
segment Asn312-Asn319 (Supplementary Figure 5h). The superposition reveals incompatible steric
hindrance between the main chains of SegA and SegB would occur if both folds were formed by a single
TDP-43 molecule that contains both SegA and SegB sequences.

The extensive hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds observed in both the dagger- and Rshaped folds suggest that both SegA and SegB A315E fibrils are irreversible. To examine this
hypothesis, we calculated modified atomic solvation energies (see Methods) to quantify the stabilities of
the fibrils. The calculated stabilities of both the dagger- and R-shaped fold fibrils (represented by energy
per layer and per residue) are comparable to other pathogenic amyloid fibrils, such as the Alzheimer’s and
Pick’s disease fibrils (Figure 3). In contrast the stability of FUS fibrils, thought to be reversible42, is
distinctly lower. We performed thermostability assays to validate our energetic calculations. When
heated to 75 °C for 30 minutes, fibrils formed by SegA, SegB, and SegB A315E are all stable, whereas
fibrils formed by mCherry-FUS-LCD (composed of residues 1-214 – identical to the sequence
determined in the FUS ssNMR structure except with a His-tag replacing mCherry42) disappeared after

heating to 60 °C (Supplementary Figure 1c). These results are consistent with our energetic
calculations and support the idea that the dagger- and R-shaped fold fibrils are irreversible.

Several lines of evidence suggest that the dagger and R-shaped folds can be adopted by longer
TDP-43 segments such as the pathogenic TDP-CTF fragment. (1) Structural conservation: The core
region (residue 320-334) of the dagger-shaped fold is structurally conserved in all four dagger-shaped
folds despite differences in local environment (Supplementary Note 1). (2) Model building. The outward
facing disposition of the termini in these folds longer TDP-43 structures to be modeled from these cores
without steric interference. (3) Cross seeding. Fibrils formed by TDP-CTF can seed SegA and SegB
A315E monomer (Supplementary Figure 1f), and SegA and SegB A315E fibrils can seed TDP-LCD
monomer (Figure 4b) (due to its rapid aggregation, TDP-CTF monomer could not be used to measure
seeding and we instead used TDP-LCD monomer as the LCD is required for TDP-43 aggregation32,35,36).
(4) Mutagenesis experiments with TDP-CTF reported here and previously32. We found that five
individual point mutations to tryptophan delay aggregation of TDP-CTF; these sterically conflict with the
tightly packed dagger-shaped (A324W, L330W, Q331W, M337W) and R-shaped (Q303W) folds delay
aggregation of TDP-CTF. Similarly, the mutations A324E and M337E that are disruptive to the daggershaped fold are found to inhibit aggregation of full-length TDP-43 in cells11. As negative controls, we
found that A326W and G304W – located in a solvent exposed environment of the dagger-shaped fold and
a loose cavity of the R-shaped fold, respectively – can tolerate the bulky tryptophan and did not delay
aggregation of TDP-CTF (Supplementary Figure 1d, Supplementary Figure 6a&b, Supplementary Figure
7 and Supplementary Note 5)32. Furthermore, a key stabilizing feature of SegB A315E, the Arg293Glu315 salt bridge, is similarly important for TDP-CTF aggregation. We designed two double mutations,
R293E/A315E and R293E/A315R. Based on our structure of SegB A315E, R293E/A315E would disrupt
the R-shaped fold by electrostatic repulsion whereas R293E/A315R would favor the R-shaped fold by

restoring the salt-bridge. In accordance with our model, R293E/A315E reduces TDP-CTF aggregation
whereas R293E/A315R enhances TDP-CTF aggregation (Supplementary Figure 1d). These results
suggest that both the dagger- and the R-shaped folds are accessible to TDP-CTF molecules, so that
disrupting either one blocks one pathway to fibril formation and hence delays aggregation of TDP-CTF.
The observation that none of these mutations targeting the dagger- or R-shaped fold fully eliminates
aggregation supports our hypothesis that TDP-CTF can form fibrils using one of multiple aggregation
cores, including the dagger- or R-shaped fold, or possibly others not discovered here. In short,
conservation of the dagger fold, modeling, seeding experiments, and mutational analysis all suggest that
TDP-CTF can form the folds we observe.

We investigated whether the dagger- and R-shaped folds are relevant to TDP-43 fibrils in human
disease, motivated by the irreversibility of fibrils formed by these folds and the likely accessibility to both
folds of TDP-CTF. The scarcity of TDP-43 fibrils in autopsied brains of ALS and FTLD patients daunts
structure determination of patient-derived TDP-43 fibrils, so we used seeding experiments to examine the
possibility that our structures represent folds adopted by TDP-43 in disease. We seeded both SegA and
SegB A315E monomer with sarkosyl-insoluble material from brain extracts of two patients with FTLDTDP, which was previously reported to induce FTLD-TDP pathology in a mouse model43. We observe
that the sarkosyl-insoluble material was able to seed SegA monomer (Supplementary Figure 1g). This
process indicates that TDP-43 in these FTLD-TDP brain extracts contains a well-folded SegA region that
can serve as a template for seeded aggregation, thereby providing plausibility for the existence of the
dagger-shaped fold in these extracts. In contrast we found that the same brain extracts cannot seed SegB
A315E monomer (Supplementary Figure 1g), suggesting that the R-shaped fold may not exist in these
extracts. This lack of seeding may mean that the R-shaped fold is specific for patients bearing the TDP-

43 A315E mutation. Alternatively, the R-shaped fold may not exist in this particular FTLD patient but
may exist in other TDP-43 diseases or disease subtypes such as ALS, especially given that the A315E
mutation was discovered in the context of ALS12.

We thus propose a one-to-one correspondence between polymorph and disease subtype. More
specifically, we speculate that the difference between SegA-sym and SegA-asym are so subtle that they
may be associated with the same diseases whereas the differences between the dagger- and R-shaped fold
are significant enough to perhaps be associated with different diseases. This hypothesis is supported by :
(1) insoluble TDP-43 extracts from different sub-types of FTLD have distinct morphologies and
biochemical properties44, and (2) fibrils of two peptides whose sequences closely match the daggershaped fold and the R-shaped fold (Supplementary Figure 6c) seed cell-expressed TDP-43 into distinct
aggregates41.

Our finding of polymorphism of TDP-43 fibrils adds TDP-43 to the cohort of other polymorphforming amyloid proteins14,28–30, and raises the question of why polymorphism is common in amyloid
fibrils but not in globular proteins. We suggest that the polymorphism observed in irreversible amyloid
fibrils arises from a lack of evolutionary pressure to fold into a particular structure that performs an
adaptive function. In contrast, each globular protein and functional aggregate has evolved to fold into a
single structure with lower free energy than any other structure that its sequence can form. That is,
pathogenic amyloid fibrils lack survival advantage and so can adopt multiple conformations that represent
different local energy minima in the protein folding landscape. However, a particular polymorph may give
rise to a particular disease45, perhaps nucleated by a mutation such as TDP-43 A315E or a particular
cellular environment as suggested for alpha-synuclein46. Polymorph-specific diseases are consistent with

results on tau where multiple patients with the same tauopathy all are found to have the same fibril
polymorphs and patients with different tauopaties have different fibril polymorphs29,30,47.

Our structure of SegB A315E, the first reported cryo-EM fibril structure containing a hereditary
mutation, offers a molecular explanation in terms of seeding for cell-to-cell spreading of pathology
through the brain40. As explained above, our SegB A315E structure indicates that A315E facilitates TDP43 aggregation through electrostatic attraction with Arg293, and suggests A315T (if the threonine is
phosphorylated as speculated) can function in a similar way. As summarized in Figure 4a, wild-type
TDP-43 monomer can form either the dagger-shaped or R-shaped fold (or possibly other folds), and both
folds can act as seeds to recruit additional monomers into the fibril. In A315E, the inter-layer interaction
motif of Arg293-Glu315 provides free positive and negative charges on both ends of any R-shaped fibril
that consists of 2 layers or more (Figure 2h), and these free charges can attract additional monomers
through long-range electrostatic interactions. Thus the seeding potency of the R-shaped fold with the
A315E mutation may exceed that of other folds. Our seeding experiments support this model by showing
that SegB A315E fibrils are more effective in seeding TDP-LCD A315E monomer than SegA fibrils
(Figure 4b & Supplementary Note 7).

here. a, (Left) Monomeric TDP-43 can form amyloid fibrils with either dagger-shaped or R-shaped cores
(or perhaps other so far unidentified cores). The ALS hereditary A315E mutation accelerates the Rshaped core through electrostatic interaction of Glu315 with Arg293. b, Experiments seeding TDP-43
fibril formation support the model of Panel A. Notice that both SegA and SegB A315E fibrils seed LCD
monomer (far left and middle left). In contrast, only SegB A315E fibrils seed LCD A315E monomer
whereas SegA fibrils barely seed LCD A315E monomer (far right and middle right). Data are shown as
mean ± s.d., n=4 independent experiments.

Hereditary mutations have also been proposed to impart pathology by additional mechanisms
(Supplementary Note 8), including shifting TDP-43 from a reversible to an irreversible assembly48,49.

Although we have shown that both dagger- and R-shaped folds form irreversible fibrils, and others have
shown that the C-terminal domain can form helical assemblies in liquid droplets49, we cannot rule out the
possibility that under certain conditions the dagger- and R-shaped folds may also participate in reversible
aggregation reported for TDP-43. Energetic analysis suggests this may be possible for the R-shaped fold.
The outer two chains in the SegB A315E structure differs noticeably from the inner two chains
(Supplementary Note 3), having a lower stabilization energy (0.79 kcal/mol per residue), close to the
stabilization energy of the FUS structure (0.66 kcal/mol per residue), which undergoes reversible
aggregation, versus the inner chain (0.94 kcal/mol per residue). Conceivably in the native protein, in the
absence of the constraint of the Arg293-Glu315 salt bridge and accompanied by certain conformational
changes, the R-shaped fold may participate in a reversible fibril (Supplementary Note 9). That is we
speculate that the A315E mutation could impose a switch of a reversible to an irreversible fibril.

Our four near-atomic resolution structures of TDP-43 amyloid fibrils establish that: (1) TDP-43 is
capable of forming multiple fibrillar structural polymorphs; (2) That two sequence segments of TDP-43
can form distinct stable amyloid cores, one with dagger-shaped folds and the other with R-shaped folds;
(3) The R293-E315 salt-bridge in R-shaped fold provides a plausible explanation of enhanced TDP-43
pathology by the ALS related hereditary mutation A315E (and possibly A315Tp); and (4) Energetic
analysis highlights the structural features of amyloid fibrils that may lead to both reversible and
irreversible aggregation.

Materials and Methods
Construct design
Construct design of TDP-43 segments follows the same strategy reported previously1. In addition to
TDP-LCD (274-414) reported in our previous study1, constructs used in this study include TDP-43 full length
(1-414), SegA (311-360), SegB (286-331, wild type or with A315E mutation) and SegAB (286-360). All TDP43 fragments were conjugated by inserting the cDNA into a pET28a vector that contains an amino terminus
conjugation of SUMO protein. The SUMO protein was used to increase solubility and prevent aggregation
during expression and purification. The (His)6-tag on the amino terminus of the SUMO protein was used for Nicolumn purification. The expression sequence of each TDP-43 fragments is as follows:

Protein purification and SUMO-tag cleavage
Protein purification follows the same protocol reported previously1. Briefly, all SUMO-tagged proteins
were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain. LB media with 50 µg/ml kanamycin was used for cell
culture. After bacterial cells were cultured at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.6-0.8, 1 mM isopropyl β-D-1thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added for protein expression and the cells were further cultured at 25 °C for
3 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 10%
(v/v) glycerol, supplemented with 1% (v/v) Halt Protease Inhibitor single-use cocktail (Thermo Scientific), and
were sonicated (3s on/3s of cycle, 10 min) and centrifuged (24,000 g for 20 min) to get cell lysate. The cell
lysate was mixed with homemade NucA nuclease (5000 U per liter of cell culture) and filtered before loading
onto a HisTrap HP column (GE healthcare) for purification. The HisTrap column was pre-equilibrated with
20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole, and sample was washed with 20 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl and 200 mM imidazole and eluted with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl and
500 mM imidazole. Eluted protein was concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filters (Millipore) and
stored at -80 °C for future use.

In order to form fibrils of the TDP-43 fragments, the SUMO-tag of each fragment was removed before
aggregation. SUMO-tagged protein was mixed with 100:1 (weight basis) homemade ULP1 protease, and
incubated for 1 hour. When analyzed by SDS-PAGE, samples mixed with ULP1 at 0 hour show bands of intact
SUMO-tagged protein; after 1 hour of cleavage, bands of free SUMO and TDP-43 fragments were shown on
the gel, as exampled by SegA and SegB A315E cleavage shown in Supplementary Figure 1a.

Fibril preparation and optimization
SUMO-tag removed proteins were used for fibril preparation. For all TDP-43 fragments, the starting
fibril preparation conditions are the same. Protein was diluted to 50 µM concentration with 20 mM Tris-HCl,

pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10 µM DTT and filtered using 0.1 µm Ultrafree-MC-VV centrifugal filters (Millipore),
and incubated at 37 °C with shaking for 3 days. The morphology of each sample was checked by negative stain
TEM.

In order to achieve the necessary fibril concentration and distribution for cryo-EM structure
determination, the fibril growth condition was optimized for each sample. The optimization includes
determining the appropriate concentration of proteins (final values ranging from 3 µM to 100 µM monomer
concentration), incubating the solution without shaking, incubation temperature (4 °C or 25 °C or 37 °C),
incubation time (overnight to more than 2 weeks), buffer (Tris or phosphate), salt concentration (50 mM to 500
mM NaCl) and seeding with pre-formed fibrils. After optimization of all TDP-43 fragments, SegA and SegB
A315E were found to have the best fibril morphology, distribution, and concentration and were therefore
selected for cryo-EM structure determination. The optimized fibril morphology of each fragment is shown in
Supplementary Figure 1b.

The optimized fibril growth condition for SegA was 50 µM protein concentration, incubation in 20 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 10 µM DTT at 37 °C with 3 days of shaking. Two percent (molar ratio,
monomer equivalent) pre-formed SegA fibrils were added as seeds. After shaking, SegA fibrils were collected
by centrifugation at 9,000 g for 5 min and washed twice and resuspended to the starting volume with the
identical buffer as above, except using 150 mM NaCl instead of 500 mM. Fibrils in resuspension buffer were
further incubated without shaking for 3 days at room temperature. Before cryo-EM sample preparation, SegA
fibrils were again collected by centrifugation, and re-suspended with 150 mM NaCl buffer at 5% volume of
previous incubation (20 × concentrating), and the concentrated solution was heated to 75 °C for 30 min with a
PCR machine. The final heating step was necessary to de-clump SegA fibrils and optimize fibril distribution.

The optimized fibril growth condition for SegB A315E was 50 µM initial protein concentration, and
incubation in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10 µM DTT, at 37 °C without shaking. Two percent
(molar ratio, monomer equivalent) pre-formed SegB A315E fibrils were added as seeds. After incubation, SegB
A315E fibrils were collected by centrifugation at 9,000 g for 5 min and washed twice by the same incubation
buffer at 5% volume of previous incubation (20 × concentrating), and the concentrated solution was used for
cryo-EM sample preparation.

Negative stain transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
Negative stain TEM samples were prepared by applying 5 µl of fibril solution to glow-discharged 400
mesh carbon-coated formvar support films mounted on copper grids (Ted Pella, Inc.) and incubating on the grid
for 2 min. The samples were then blotted off and the grids were stained with 3 µl of 2% uranyl acetate for 1
min. The grids were washed with an additional 3 µl of 2% uranyl acetate and allowed to dry for 1 min. Each
grid was imaged using a T12 (FEI) electron microscope.

Cryo-EM data collection and processing
2 µl of fibril solution was applied to a glow-discharged Quantifoil 1.2/1.3 electron microscope grid and
plunge-frozen into liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI). Data were collected on a Titan Krios (FEI)
microscope equipped with a Gatan Quantum LS/K2 Summit direct electron detection camera (operated with
300 kV acceleration voltage and slit width of 20 eV). Super-resolution movies were collected on a Gatan K2
Summit direct electron detector with a nominal physical pixel size of 1.07 Å /pixel (0.535 Å /pixel in superresolution movie frames) with a dose per frame of ~1.1 e-/Å 2. A total of 40 frames with a frame rate of 5 Hz
were taken for each movie resulting in a final dose of ~44 e-/Å 2 per image. Automated data collection was
driven by the Leginon automation software package2.

Micrographs containing crystalline ice were used to estimate the anisotropic magnification distortion
using mag_distortion_estimate3. CTF estimation was performed using CTFFIND 4.1.8 on movie stacks with a
grouping of 3 frames and correction for anisotropic magnification distortion4. Unblur5 was used to correct
beam-induced motion with dose weighting and anisotropic magnification correction, resulting in a physical
pixel size of 1.06 Å /pixel and 1.064 Å /pixel for the SegB and SegA data sets, respectively.

All particle picking was performed manually with SegB A315E data set fibrils picked as a group and
SegA data set fibrils were picked separately in groups of slow twister and fast twisters using EMAN2
e2helixboxer.py6 (we could not discriminate between SegA-sym and SegA-asym by eye due to their similar
crossover distances and morphology; therefore, SegA-sym and SegA-asym particles were later separated by 2D
classification and 3D classification). Particles were extracted in RELION using the 90% overlap scheme into
288 pixel boxes for SegA and 320 pixel boxes for SegB A315E. Classification, helical reconstruction, and 3D
refinement were used in RELION as described7–9. In general, we performed 2D Classifications with higher
tau_fudge (ranging from values of 4 to 12) to identify, and select for future 3D classification, particles
contributing to 2D classes showing β-strand separation along the helical axis. We performed 3D classification
with the estimated helical parameters from each structure and an elongated Gaussian blob as an initial model to
generate starting reconstructions. We ran additional 3D classifications using the preliminary reconstructions
from the previous step to select for particles contributing to homogenous classes (stable helicity and separation
of β-strands in the X-Y plane). Typically, we performed Class3D jobs with K=3 and manual control of the
tau_fudge factor and healpix to reach a resolution of ~5-6 Å to select for particles that contributed to the highest
resolution class for each structure. For the SegB and SegA-slow reconstructions, we performed high-resolution
gold-standard refinement as described9. For SegA-sym and SegA-asym, perhaps due to low particle numbers,
Refine3D seemed unable to adequately regulate working resolution to refine with high enough resolution
factors to allow SegA-sym and SegA-asym reconstructions to refine past 4.8 Å , and gold-standard refinement
did not result in near-atomic resolution maps. Therefore, we employed a “sub-optimal” manual refinement

protocol using all particles against a single reference map as described7,10. Final overall resolution estimates
were calculated from the corrected Fourier shell correlations of two half maps, using high-resolution phase
randomization as implemented in RELION PostProcess to account for effects of a soft-edged solvent mask and
to monitor possible overfitting for the SegA-sym and SegA-asym manual refinements11. For the SegB and
SegA-slow gold-standard refinements, we report the 0.143 FSC resolution cutoff; however, for the SegA-sym
and SegA-asym “sub-optimal” refinements we report the 0.5 FSC resolution cutoff (the particles contributing to
the final map were split a posteriori into even and odd micrographs to prevent particles from the same fibril
contributing to different reconstructions and two half-maps were reconstructed using the fully refined center and
orientation parameters)11. In all cases except the SegA-slow, the default value of 30% was used for the
helical_z_percentage during 3D classification and refinement. Since the crossover distance of the SegA-slow
varied from 1200-2000 Å, we used 10% for the helical_z_percentage to minimize the blurring due to the
variable twist as described12. Reconstructions were compared against the reference-free 2D class averages to
confirm their validity. In addition, de novo model-building also confirms the validity of the 3D reconstructions.

Specific determination of helical symmetry for all structures was performed as follows. For SegA-sym,
SegA-asym, and SegB A315E, we estimated the crossover distances using a combination of manual inspection
of the micrographs and inspection of 2D class averages using larger particle box sizes to capture the entire
crossover distance (box sizes from 432 to 1024 pixels were tested). In the case of the SegA-sym and the SegB
A315E, the mirror symmetry axis parallel to the helical axis in the 2D class averages indicated either a two-start
helix symmetry with a rise of 2.4 Å or a Cn rotational symmetry. Computed diffraction patterns from the 2D
class averages indicated there was no meridional reflection at 4.8 Å , indicating the lack of Cn rotational
symmetry. Therefore, for both of these species, a helical rise of 2.4 Å was assumed and the helical twist was
calculated from the previously estimated crossover distance. Convergence to a stable helicity and highresolution refinement to near-atomic resolution allowing de novo model building confirmed the helical
symmetry. For SegA-slow, the entire crossover distance could not be captured by the 1024 box size, so the

crossover distance was estimated from a combination of manual inspection of micrographs and a “stitched”
together fibril using the 2D classes from the 288 box size (Supplementary Figure 3f). Class averages, as well as
the computed diffraction pattern from the “stitched” fibril, confirm the presence of a meridional reflection at 4.8
Å , indicating Cn rotational symmetry. Therefore, we assumed a helical rise of 4.8 Å and we calculated the
helical twist from the previously estimated crossover distance. High-resolution refinement to near-atomic
resolution allowed de novo model building, confirming the helical symmetry. In addition, reconstructions with a
helical rise of 2.4 Å did not show clear side chain density, and projections of the reconstruction did not match
the 2D class averages (Supplementary Figure 3e). For SegA-asym, the crossover distance was estimated from a
combination of inspection of the micrographs, and 2D class averages with larger box sizes. Due to the lack of
apparent two-fold symmetry in the 2D class averages, we assumed a helical rise of 4.8 Å and calculated the
helical twist from the measured cross-over distances. Refinement to near-atomic resolution demonstrate that the
two SegA-asym monomers within each asymmetric unit are not identical, confirming the lack of two-fold
symmetry.

Atomic model building
We sharpened the refined maps using phenix.auto_sharpen13 at the resolution cutoff indicated by halfmap FSC, and subsequently built atomic models into the refined maps with COOT14. For the three SegA
polymorphs, we built the model of the slow twister first owing to its high resolution (3.3 Å ). The density map of
the slow twister clearly shows a cyclic mainchain with the amino and carboxy termini at the center of the fibril.
The initial model was built with both N-C orientations, and only the orientation shown in the current model fit
all the side chain densities. The conservation of the dagger-fold in the maps of the fast symmetric and fast
asymmetric twister, especially the signature 334WGMMGML340 motif, allowed us to rigid-body fit the model of
the slow twister into the fast symmetric and fast asymmetric maps. Following rigid-body fitting, we manually
inspected and adjusted each residue.

After building atomic models for the main chain of SegA polymorphs, we observed extra density
peripheral to the dagger-shaped fold around Gln331 of SegA-slow and Met323 of both SegA-asym and SegAslow (Figure 1c-d). We believe this density arises from unstable interactions (either due to weak binding or
binding of a mixture of different residues) of other protomers with the core protofilaments. We could not build a
definitive model due to ambiguity of the side-chain densities; however, we built a hypothetical model into the
density near Gln331 of SegA-slow based on the speculation that this density represents part of the continuous
dimer interface found in SegA-sym and SegA-asym.

During model building of SegA-slow, we found that the model that fully recapitulates the registration of
the fast symmetric twister was not favorable due to the steric clash at L340 and unexplained side chain density
at G338 (Supplementary Figure 5d). Therefore, we built the model with a registration that has a 2 residue offset
compared to the fast symmetric twister. We believe that this registration shift is allowed by the similarity of
nearby residues (Gln331 from dagger-fold flanked by Ser342 and Gln344 from the short chain, compared to
Gln331 flanked by Gln344 and Gln346), and is caused by the lack of the hydrophobic anchor formed by
Met336 and Leu340 (Supplementary Figure 5e). A similar registration shift was observed in previous reported
crystal structures of steric-zippers and was termed registration polymorphism15. The extra densities near Met323
in SegA-asym and SegA-slow could represent an additional dimer interface that protects Ala321, Met323 and
Ala325 from the solvent, but without unambiguous side chain density, we could not build in any models for
these densities.

The model building of SegB A315E was initiated by the inspection of the density map near the homodimer interface on the neck of the inner-chain R-shaped fold. The side chain density and nearby environment
indicates the atomic model of this region should feature 4-5 small side chain residues flanked by a big side
chain residue at each side, and the only motif in the SegB A315E sequence that matches this criterion is
293

RGGGAGL299, with only one orientation feasible considering the length of density at each side of this motif.

With the model of 293RGGGAGL299 built, the rest of model was built by adding the residues one-by-one. All
sidechains fit the density unambiguously. The observation that Glu315 forms a salt-bridge with Arg293 further
supports this model. After we built the inner R-shape fold, we speculated that the outer R-shape fold was not a
continuation of the same chain as the inner R-shape fold because there were not enough residues in the
sequence to accommodate the outer R-shape fold. Therefore, the model of the outer R-shape fold was built de
novo similarly to the inner-R-shape fold.

For all structures, after we built the initial model, we used in-house scripts to generate a 5-layer model
using the helical symmetry of the refined map, and used phenix.real_space_refine for model refinement16. After
several rounds of refinement, we adjusted the orientation of the main chain oxygen and nitrogen to facilitate
main chain hydrogen bond within the β-sheet, and we applied these mainchain hydrogen bond restraint for
further real-space refinement. As the last step, the rotamer of each serine, glutamine and asparagine residue was
manually inspected to ensure the energy favorable hydrogen binding. The final model was validated by
MolProbity17.

The G304W model of SegB A315E shown in Supplementary Figure 6b was generated by manually
changing Gly304 residues of 1-layer SegB A315E model (four glycine residues in four chains) to tryptophan in
COOT, and we generated a 5-layer mutated model using the same script as for original SegB A315E model. We
refined this 5-layer mutated model by phenix.real_space_refine using the same density map we used to refine
the original model. The refined model shows no Ramachandran angles and rotamer outliers, and no significant
clashes. The statistics of SegA A315E G304W model are shown in Supplementary Table 3.

Energetic calculation
The stabilization energy is an adaptation of the solvation free energy described previously18, in which
the energy is calculated as the sum of products of the area buried of each atom and its corresponding atomic

solvation parameter (ASP). ASPs were taken from our previous work18. Area buried is calculated as the
difference in solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of the reference state (i.e. unfolded state) and the SASA of
the folded state. The reference state was measured absent all other atoms in the structure but the residue “i” and
main chain atoms of residue i-1 and i+1. The SASA of the folded state was measured for each atom in the
context of all amyloid fibril atoms. Fibril coordinates were extended by symmetry by three to five chains on
either side of the reported molecule, to ensure the energetic calculations were representative of the majority of
molecules in a fibril, rather than a fibril end. To account for energetic stabilization of main chain hydrogen
bonds, the ASP for backbone N/O elements was reassigned from -9 to 0 if they participated in a hydrogen bond.
Similarly, if an asparagine or glutamine side chain participated in a polar ladder (two hydrogen bonds per
amide), and was shielded from solvent (SASAfolded < 5 Å2), the ASPs of the side chain N and O elements were
reassigned from -9 to 0. Lastly, the ASP of ionizable atoms (e.g. Asp, Glu, Lys, His, Arg, N-terminal amine, or
C-terminal carboxylate) were assigned the charged value (-37/-38) unless the atoms participated in a buried ion
pair, defined as a pair of complementary ionizable atoms within 4.2 Å distance of each other, each with
SASAfolded < 40 Å2). In that case, the ASP of the ion pair was reassigned to -9. In the energy diagrams, a single
color is assigned to each residue, rather than each atom. The color corresponds to the sum of solvation free
energy values of each of the atoms in the residue. The energy reported for FUS in Figure 3 is the average over
20 NMR models. The standard deviation is 1.8 kcal/mol.

Thermo-stability assays of TDP-43 and FUS fibrils
To validate the energetic calculations and test the stability of TDP-43 segment fibrils experimentally,
pre-formed TDP-43 segment fibrils were heated at 75 °C for 30 min in a PCR machine, and the existence of
the fibrils were checked by negative stain EM. All fibrils were heated in 20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl,
10 µM DTT at 50 µM monomer-equivalent concentration.
FUS protein was purified and FUS fibrils was formed the same way as previously reported [ref]. FUS
protein was expressed using pHis-parallel-mCherry-1FUS214 plasmid that contain the low complexity domain

of FUS (1-214) conjugated to mCherry. Purification was done by Ni column and size exclusion column. The
hydrogel of FUS was formed by incubating purified mCherry-FUS at 4 °C for 2 weeks at a concentration of 1
M. After hydrogel formation, a scrape of hydrogel was mixed with 20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10
µM DTT to approximately 20x of its original volume (~50 µM monomer concentration). The mixture was
allocated to three PCR tubes, one without heat and two heated at 60 °C and 75 °C for 30 min, respectively. All
three samples were checked by negative stain EM for fibrils. The sample without heat contains abundant
fibrils on the EM grid and the sample with heat contains no visible fibrils anywhere on the EM grid.

ThT assays
Protein was diluted into 12 µM in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 10 µM DTT, 30 µM ThT,
and filtered using 0.1 µm Ultrafree-MC-VV centrifugal filters (Millipore). Filtered solution was mixed with or
without 100:1 (weight basis) ULP1, with or without 5% (molar ratio, monomer equivalent) pre-formed fibril
seeds (or 1% v/v for brain extract seeds), and was pipetted into a polybase black 384-well plate with optical
bottom (Thermo Scientific) and incubated at 37 °C without shaking. ThT fluorescence was measured with
excitation and emission wavelength of 440 and 480 nm, respectively, using FLUOstar Omega plate reader
(BMG LABTECH). The aggregation curves were averaged from four independent measured replicates and
error bars show s.d. of replicate measurements. Fibril seeds were sonicated (1s on/1s off cycle, 3 min) before
use to increase the seeding ability.
The brain extracted materials were a generous gift from Prof. Virginia Lee’s lab. Brain extract #1 was
from a patient diagnosed as FTLD-TDP, whereas brain extract #2 was from a patient diagnosed as FTLD-TDPGRN. Both brain extracts were extracted from the frontal cortex, and estimated TDP-43 concentration were
~500 ng/ml (measured by ELISA assays) and estimated total protein concentration were 2.5 mg/ml for brain
extract #1 and 4 mg/ml for brain extract #2 (measured by BCA assays).
The samples mixed with pre-formed fibril seeds had an additional ThT background reading because of
the seeds. To better compare the curves of samples with and without seeding and estimate the ThT signal

change that represented the formation of seeded fibrils, we removed the background by subtracting the value of
the first reading from each curve. To normalize the different ranges of fluorescence readings observed from
each experiments (probably due to the different fluorescence gain settings of the plate reader), we normalized
the readings to make the minimum mean value in each panel 0%, and the maximum mean value in each panel
100%.

TDP-CTF aggregation assays
The aggregation assays of pathological fragments of TDP-43 (TDP-CTF) were performed largely the
same as previous reported1. The SUMO-TDP-CTF wild type and mutants were diluted into 0.2 mg/ml with 20
mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10 µM DTT and filtered by 0.1 µm Ultrafree-MC-VV centrifugal filters
(Millipore). To simplify the experiment, we did not remove SUMO-tag by ULP1 protease because we found
that wild type TDP-CTF aggregates after overnight incubation even with the protection of SUMO. Filtered
samples were incubated at 4 °C overnight, and separated into supernatant and pellet fractions by centrifugation
at 18,000 g for 3min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended with the same buffer and volume, and both
supernatant and pellet were mixed with 3:1 (v/v) of NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and heated to 100
°C for 10 min. The samples before incubation were also prepared in the same way. All samples were separated
by NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and stained by Coomassie blue. TDP-CTF A324W that had been
shown to reduce TDP-CTF aggregation previously1 was also tested in this study as a control to make sure that
we can get the similar results with or without ULP1 cleavage.

All three polymorphs feature a largely conserved dagger-shaped fold (Figure 2a&b), with the
hydrophobic residues from Phe313 to Ala341 forming tight hydrophobic interactions (Figure 2c). Detailed
single chain superposition shows that SegA-sym and the long chain of SegA-asym have nearly identical dagger13

shaped folds, with the “stem” of the long chain SegA-asym (Ala341 to Ser347) bent approximately 40° (Figure
2c). This bending of the long chain SegA-asym stem forces a 40° bend in the “blade” of the SegA-asym short
chain relative to the reference SegA-sym fold, corresponding with the shift in registration of the stem
hydrophobic interdigitation (Supplementary Figure 5a, left). The blade region of the SegA-asym short chain
(Pro320 to Met337) is still conserved (Supplementary Figure 5a, middle). In addition, the dagger-shaped fold in
SegA-slow is also largely conserved; however, Ala341 to Ser347 of the SegA-slow stem are bent approximately
50° compared to SegA-sym (Supplementary Figure 5a, right), causing a significant conformational change at
Met336. Further, the interaction of the termini in SegA-slow causes a conformational change at Phe313, Phe316
and Met339, and M311 is now visualized and participating in the hydrophobic core (Supplementary Figure 5a,
right). We note that the dagger tip (residue 320-334) is almost identical in all four dagger-shaped fold of three
SegA polymorphs despite differences in local environment. This high degree of structural conservation suggests
this core region of dagger-shaped fold is thermodynamically stable, kinetically accessible and is likely to be
present in other polymorphs (perhaps including disease relevant TDP-43 aggregates).

Note 2 (Detailed comparison of dimer interfaces in three SegA polymorphs):
The protofilament interface in SegA-sym and SegA-asym are similar (Supplementary Figure 5b&c) with
slight differences in the region that have 40° bend (Supplementary Figure 5c, right). We name this the
continuous interface since it is formed by two continuous chains, compared to the broken interface in SegAslow formed by the interaction of the termini (Supplementary Figure 5a). The continuous interface has a
hydrophobic core formed by Met336 and Leu340 from both monomers in the middle and a hydrogen bond
network towards the edges (Figure 2d & Supplementary 5b). The broken interface is formed largely by the tight
packing of Met359 and the hydrogen bonding network of the peripheral asparagine residues (Supplementary
Figure 5b). We observed only part of the continuous interface in SegA-slow, probably due to the
conformational change of Met336 (Supplementary Figure 5d&e, see model building in Methods for details).

Note 3 (information provided by SegA-slow):
The close contact between the N- and C-terminal in the long chain of SegA-slow suggests that SegAslow is not compatible with any TDP-43 segments that are longer than SegA, so that this structure is probably a
truncation artifact. However, we still believe this structure provides valuable information that helps us
understand the aggregation of TDP-43. First, the SegA-slow structure contains the dagger-shaped fold,
demonstrating its conservation in the three different polymorphs we observe for SegA (Supplementary Figure
5a). We note that the incompatibility of SegA-slow to full-length TDP-43 is coming from the tail region
(residues 347-360) that is extra to the dagger-shaped fold (Supplementary Figure 8a, upper panel). Thus, taken
alone, the dagger-shaped fold in SegA-slow (residues 312-346) is still compatible with full-length TDP-43, as
in SegA-sym and SegA-asym. Second, the tail region hairpin structure (residues 342-360) in SegA-slow is also
compatible with full-length TDP-43 when separated from the dagger-shaped fold, with free N- and C- terminals
(Supplementary Figure 8a bottom panel). This hairpin structure is formed by tightly packed hydrophilic zippers
stabilized with extensive hydrogen bonds (Supplementary Figure 8b). Based on the analysis above, we
speculate that this hairpin structure may also be involved in TDP-43 aggregation as another segmental
polymorph. Further study is needed to test our hypothesis as well as identify whether this hairpin contribute to
reversible or irreversible aggregation of TDP-43. Third, our SegA-slow structure may provide, to our
knowledge, the first atomic evidence of secondary seeding of amyloid fibrils. Secondary seeding is considered
as seeding off the side of pre-formed fibrils, in contrast to primary seeding where molecules add to the top or
bottom of pre-formed fibrils. In this case, the extra density near Q331 and M323 of the long chain of SegA-slow
indicates that the secondary seeding can occur on these regions. Because the long chain of SegA-slow contain
all 50 residues in SegA, the extra density must come from other SegA molecules, therefore supporting a
secondary seeding mechanism. In comparison, similar extra density has been observed in other amyloid fibril
structures, such as PHF tau12; but in these structures the ordered fibril core does not contain all residues of
sample molecule, so that we cannot be sure that these densities are coming from a different chain as examples
of secondary seeding, or from flexible residues from the same molecule outside the fibril core.

Note 4 (Structural analysis of SegB A315E):
The overall R-shaped folds of the inner and outer chain of the SegB A315E fibril are largely similar with
some salient differences. The head region of the R-fold inner chain is formed by the hydrophobic interaction of
Leu299, Met307, Met311 and Phe313, as well as by Asn302 and Ser305 hydrogen bonding; whereas in the
outer chain, Leu299 is flipped outside the head to mediate the heterodimer interaction between the inner and
outer chain (Figure 2f). Consequently, the head region of the outer chain is formed by the hydrophobic
interaction of Met307, Met311 and Phe313, together with hydrogen bonds formed by Asn301, Asn302 and
Ser305 (Figure 2f & Supplementary Figure 5f). The neck region of both chains is formed by hydrophobic
interaction between Ala297 and Phe313, the Arg293-Glu315 salt-bridge. The 70° bend of the Phe316-Asn319
leg of the outer chain relative to the inner chain is probably caused by the heterodimer interface formed by the
legs of the inner and outer chain that restricts the conformation of inner chain.

Note 5 (Structure analysis of SegB A315E dimer interfaces):
The homodimeric interfaces (between two pseudo-21 axis related inner chains) are formed by small side
chain residues (Gly298 and Gly300) in the middle (reminiscent of the homodimer interface in the fibril structure
of PHF of tau from Alzheimer’s disease12) and hydrogen bonds among Gln303, Gly295, Ala297 and Gln301
(Figure 2g, left and Supplementary Figure 5g). The heterodimeric interfaces (between inner chain and outer
chain) are formed by hydrophobic interaction of Ile318, Phe316 with Phe289, the insertion of Leu299 into the
pocket formed by the main chain of Asn306-Gly309, hydrophobic interaction of Phe289 (from another inner
chain) and the main chain Asn303-Gly304, and hydrogen bonds among Asn312, Gly290, Ser292 and Met311
(Figure 2g, right and Supplementary Figure 5g).

Note 6 (Structure analysis of mutagenesis studies):

In SegA-sym, three of these mutation sites (Ala324, Leu330 and Met337) point toward the center of the
dagger-shaped fold and the other one (Gln331) points toward the “continuous dimer interface” (Figure 2b &
Supplementary Figure 6a), and all three are buried in a tightly packed interface that cannot tolerate a tryptophan
replacement. In contrast, Ala326 points away from the dagger-shaped fold and is solvent exposed, so that a
tryptophan mutation is allowed.
In SegB A315E, Gln303 of the inner chain is buried within the inter-chain interface whereas Gly304 of
both inner and outer chains are located in a less tightly packed environment, allowing the tryptophan mutation
at position 304 (Figure 3a & Supplementary Figure 6b). Meanwhile, R293E/A315E double mutation is expected
to disrupt the R-shaped fold by creating electrostatic hindrance, whereas R293E/A315R should restore the saltbridge of Arg293 and Glu315 and facilitate the formation of the R-shaped fold.

Note 7 (Analysis of ThT seeding assays):
The observation that both SegA and SegB 315E fibrils can seed LCD monomer (Figure 4b, far-left and
middle-left panel), indicate that the LCD can adopt both the dagger- and R-shaped fold when seeded and also
suggest that roughly equal seeding ability of both folds. Meanwhile, we found SegA fibrils barely seed LCD
A315E monomer (Figure 4b, middle-right panel) whereas SegB A315E fibrils can seed LCD A315E monomer
(Figure 4b, far-right panel). We believe these results are unlikely to come from the incompatibility of the
dagger-shaped fold with A315E mutation because the Ala315 in the dagger-shaped fold is facing towards the
solvent so that A315E mutation should be allowed. Instead, we believe the results shown in Figure 4b middleright and far-right panels indicate that the seeding ability of the R-shaped fold is much higher than the daggershaped fold when seeding A315E monomer. In this case, the observation that SegA fibrils barely seed LCD
A315E monomer can be explained by the enhanced primary nucleation and self-seeding of LCD A315E
monomer via the R293-E315 salt-bridge, so that the self-seeded aggregation overwhelms the seeding of SegA
fibrils. Taken together, we think that the seeding experiments shown in Figure 4b support our hypothesis that
the salt-bridge introduced by A315E mutation accelerates the aggregation of the R-shaped fibrils.

Note 8 (Possible mechanisms of other hereditary mutations):
The structures of the dagger- and R-shaped folds may help explain the role of other hereditary
mutations. For instance, if the R-shaped fold does indeed participate in reversible aggregation, mutations that
disrupt it could promote a transition to a more irreversible amyloid core, such as the dagger-shaped fold, as
previously hypothesized19 (Supplementary Figure 6d). On the other hand, we observe that many hereditary
mutations would have a neutral, or even deleterious, effect on the dagger- and R-shaped folds. This is consistent
with the idea that there are other observed mechanisms for mutation-enhanced pathology, such as toxic gain-offunction RNA splicing activity20. In addition, these mutations may influence the formation of other amyloid
cores not discovered here.

Note 9 (Possible conformational change of the R-shaped fold in reversible aggregates of TDP-43):
We speculate that large structural and energetic differences between the outer and inner chains is
perhaps due to the flexibility of the R-shaped fold owing to its high glycine content and relatively small
hydrophobic core. In humans lacking the A315E mutation, the absence of the Arg293-Glu315 salt bridge would
eliminate the electrostatic attraction that helps to fix the R-shape, perhaps allowing the molecule to partially
unfold to a more open U-shape. This conformational change may further compromise the stability of the Rshaped fold by promoting the disassembly of the four-protofibril bundle given the observation that the
homodimer interface of the R-shaped fold is relatively weak (Figure 2g) and formation of the heterodimer
interface requires the closed conformation of the inner R-shaped folds. Therefore, the transition from reversible
to irreversible assemblies may occur through a U-R switch where a more open and less bundled U-shape fold
converts to a more compact and more bundled R-shape. The U-R switch is possible with both wild-type and
A315E, although perhaps the wild-type sequence would have a higher transition state energy owing to the loss
of the Arg293-Glu315 interaction. We note that our energy analysis relies on the structure of one reversible
fibril and that we have no experimental evidence regarding the role of the R-shape in reversible TDP-43

the R-shape in TDP-43 reversible aggregation is needed.

In contrast, the Ala326 in SegA-sym and Gly304 in SegB A315E are in a relatively loose environment that is
able to accommodate the tryptophan mutations, consistent with the result that A326W and G304W did not delay
aggregation of the pathogenic TDP-43 fragment. For the G304W mutation, a plausible model of the R-shaped
fold with G304W is shown in a separated panel. G304 from the inner chain and outer chain of SegB A315E
were computationally mutated to tryptophan residues and phenix.real_space_refine was used to generate a
model with acceptable rotamers and Ramachandran angles (Supplementary Table 3). The mutated model is
shown in color and the non-mutated model is shown in gray. This model helps explain the tolerance of the
G304W mutation in our previous study. c, Synthetic TDP-43 peptide 274-313 and 314-353 were reported to
