Abstract
Dietary fibre (DF) has multiple health benefits, and wheat products are major
sources of DF for human health. However, DF is depleted in white flour, which is
most widely consumed, compared to wholegrain. The major type of DF in white
wheat flour is the cell wall polysaccharide arabinoxylan (AX). Previous studies have
identified the Chinese wheat cultivar Yumai 34 as having unusually high contents of
AX in both water-soluble and insoluble forms. We have therefore used populations
generated from crosses between Yumai 34 and four other wheat cultivars, three with
average contents of AX (Ukrainka, Altigo and Claire) and one also having unusually
high AX (Valoris), in order to map QTLs for soluble AX (determined as relative
viscosity) of aqueous extracts of wholemeal flours) and total AX (determined by
enzyme fingerprinting of white flour). A number of QTL were mapped, but most were
only detected in one or two crosses. However, all four crosses showed strong QTLs
for high RV/total AX on chromosome 1B, with Yumai 34 being the increasing parent,
and a KASP marker for the high AX Yumai 34 allele was validated by analysis of
high AX lines derived from Yumai 34 but selected by biochemical analysis. A QTL for
RV was mapped on chromosome 6B in Yumai 34 x Valoris, with Valoris being the
increasing allele, which was consistent with the observation of transgressive
segregation for this trait. The data indicate that breeding can be used to develop
wheat with high AX fibre in white flour.

Introduction
Dietary fibre (DF) is essential for human health, with cereals providing about 40% of
the total fibre intake in Western European countries such as the UK (Bates et al.,
2014) and Finland (Helldan et al., 2012). Dietary fibre (DF), and wholegrain cereal
fibre in particular, has been shown to have a number of health benefits, including
lowering blood pressure and serum cholesterol, improving insulin sensitivity and
reducing the incidence of certain types of cancer, notably bowel and breast cancers
(Cade et al, 2007; Wood, 2007; Anderson et al, 2009; Wolever et al, 2010; Aune et
al, 2011; 2016; Cooper et al., 2015; Ye et al., 2012; Hajishafiee et al., 2016;
Reynolds et al., 2018)

The mechanisms are still incompletely understood,but are considered to include
increasing faecal bulk and reducing intestinal transit time, binding cholesterol and
carcinogens, reducing the rate of digestion and glucose release in the small intestine
and fermentation to beneficial short chain fatty acids in the colon. DF also occurs in
soluble and insoluble forms, which are considered to differ in some respects in their
health benefits, with insoluble fibre being more slowly fermented and contributing
particularly to binding cholesterol and carcinogens and increasing faecal bulk.
However, despite these established health benefits, the intake of DF in most
countries falls far below the recommended levels. For example, the daily intake in
the UK is currently 17.2g/day for women and 20.1 g/day for men, compared with a
recommended

intake

of

30g/day

(https://www.nutrition.org.uk/nutritionscience/nutrients-food-and-ingredients/dietaryfibre.html).
Although wholegrain wheat is relatively rich in fibre, containing about 11 to 15% dry
weight, (Andersson et al., 2012), most wheat products are made from white flour
(derived from the starchy endosperm) (Steer et al., 2008) which contains only 2-3%
fibre (Gebruers et al, 2008). Furthermore, increased consumption of highly refined
cereal products (including bread and other products from white flour) is occurring in
countries undergoing urbanisation and industrialisation, which is considered to
contribute to increases in obesity and chronic diseases in these countries (Mattei et
al, 2015).
The major components of the DF fraction of wheat flour are cell wall
polysaccharides, principally arabinoxylan (AX) and (1→3,1→4)-β-D-glucan (βglucan), which account for about 70% and 20% of the total, respectively, with about
2% cellulose ((1→4)-β-D-glucan) and 7% glucomannan (Mares and Stone, 1973).
However, the content of AX also varies between different genotypes of wheat. For
example, 2-fold variation in the content of total (TOT)-AX and 4.7-fold variation in
water-extractable (WE)-AX was reported in white flour of 150 wheat genotypes
grown together on a single site (Gebruers et al., 2008), and 2.9-fold variation in WEAX and 1.7-fold variation in water-unextractable (WU)-AX in 20 wheat cultivars
(Ortiz-Ordaz and Saulnier, 2005). Furthermore, a high proportion of the variation in
the AX content of wholemeal and white flours of wheat is heritable, and hence
accessible for exploitation by breeders (Martinant et al., 1999; Shewry et al., 2010).
However, the exploitation of this variation to develop improved wheats has been

limited by the lack of tools for selection, with biochemical analyses being slow and
costly and a lack of molecular markers for selection.
A number of studies of the genetic control of AX content have been reported using
genetic analysis, with most analysing wholemeal flour by either direct determination
of AX (by monosaccharide analysis or colorimetric determination) or the relative
viscosity of aqueous extracts as a proxy (Martinant et al. 1998; Perretant et al. 2000;
Laperche et al. 2007; Quraishi et al. 2009; Charmet et al. 2009; Nyugen et al; Yang
et al., 2015), for AX content. In addition, two association studies of AX in wholemeal
tetraploid wheat (Marcotuli et al., 2015) and in white flour of bread wheat (Quraishi et
al., 2011) have been reported. However, although these studies identified a number
of QTL, these were not consistent across crosses and have not led to the
identification of markers for breeding.
We have therefore determined the genetic control of AX content in white flour of
wheat, by exploiting crosses with the high AX Chinese cultivar Yumai 34 (Gebruers
et al, 2008). Analysis of crosses between this cultivar and three cultivars with normal
levels of fibre identified a major QTL on chromosome 1B, while analysis of a cross
with a second high AX genotype (Valoris) identified a second major QTL (on
chromosome 6B). This allowed the identification of a linked marker for the 1B QTL
which was validated by analysis of high AX lines developed from Yumai 34 using
biochemical analysis for selection.

Results
Identification of Yumai 34 as a source of high arabinoxylan fibre in white flour

Analysis of 150 bread wheat cultivars in the EU Healthgrain project identified the
Chinese wheat cultivar Yumai 34 as having the highest contents of both WE-AX and
total AX in white flour, with 1.4% water-extractable AX (WE-AX) and 2.75% total AX
(TOT-AX), compared with mean values for the 150 lines of 0.51% and 1.93%,
respectively (Gebruers et al, 2008). The high proportion of WE-AX was especially
notable, corresponding to over 50% of TOT-AX in Yumai 34 compared with a mean
of 26% for the 150 lines.
Although these analyses were carried out on grain samples from single plots grown
on the same site in 2005-6, further comparative analyses carried out on lines grown
for over 10 years has confirmed that Yumai 34 always contains the highest, or

among the highest, contents of both TOT and WE- AX fractions in flour (authors’
unpublished results). This is illustrated by Table 1, which compares the contents of
AX fractions in white flour of four cultivars grown at Rothamsted in 2011/2012. Yumai
34 clearly has the highest contents of TOT-AX and WE-AX, with the latter being
reflected in the high relative viscosity (RV) of aqueous extracts (as discussed below).
Arabinoxylan comprises a backbone of β-D-xylopyranosyl residues linked through
(1→4) glycosidic linkages with some residues being substituted with α-Larabinofuranosyl residues at either position 3 or positions 2 and 3. Monosaccharide
analysis showed that the ratio of arabinose to xylose (A:X) in TOT-AX is lower for
Yumai 34 than for other cultivars, indicating that the structure of AX also differs
(Table 1). This difference was therefore investigated further using enzyme
fingerprinting. Treatment of AX with a specific type of endoxylanase enzyme results
in cleavage of the xylan backbone, releasing a mixture of xylose, xylobiose,
xylotriose (comprising 1, 2 and 3 xylose units, respectively) and arabinoxylan-derived
oligosaccharides (AXOS) comprising 4 to 7 xylose units, one or more of which may
be mono- or disubstituted with arabinose. The proportions of these AXOS therefore
provides a “fingerprint” which reflects differences in the extent and pattern of
arabinose substitution. The application of this approach to AX from white flours of the
four cultivars showed that Yumai 34 has a high proportion of a pentasaccharide with
the structure XA3XX (xylose-xylose monosubstituted with arabinose-xylose-xylose),
which comprised 26% of the total fragments compared with 15.17%, 16.14% and
17.21% in the other cultivars (Supplementary Table S1). This increase is associated
with reduced proportions of oligosaccharides containing disubstituted arabinose
residues, and accounts for the lower A:X ratio shown in Table 1.

Development of populations for genetic analysis of AX
Four populations were generated from crosses between Yumai 34 and European
cultivars: with the central European cultivar Ukrainka (96 F6 recombinant inbred lines
(RILs)) (Y34Ukr), the UK biscuit-making cultivar Claire (95 RILs) (Y34Cl) and the
French breadmaking cultivars Altigo (245 doubled haploid lines (DHL)) (Y34Alt) and
Valoris (84 DHL) (Y34Val). Whereas Ukrainka, Altigo and Claire and were selected
as parents because they had average contents of AX, previous studies have shown
that Valoris has higher than average contents of both WE-AX and TOT-AX (0.8%

and 2.2% compared with means of 0.51% and 1.93%, respectively, in the
Healthgrain study) and it has therefore been used as a “high AX parent” in crosses
with other low AX genotypes (Charmet et al., 2009).

Mapping relative viscosity (RV) of aqueous extracts of wholemeal
Most previous genetic analyses of AX fibre in wheat have determined the RV of
aqueous extracts of white or wholemeal flours as a proxy for arabinoxylan content
(reviewed by Quraishi et al., 2010; Shewry, 2013). This is because this parameter is
more readily determined than AX, eliminating the need for milling and biochemical
analysis. It is considered to be valid because WE-AX is known to be the major
contributor to the viscosity of aqueous extracts. However, the use of RV of
wholemeal flour as a proxy for WE-AX in white flour has not been validated. We
therefore compared the RV of aqueous extracts and the contents of WE-AX in
wholemeal and white flours from 10 lines from the Y34Ukr cross (grown at
Rothamsted in 2013/4). This showed good correlations between wholemeal RV and
wholemeal WE-AX (determined as pentosans) (r=0.70), white flour RV (r=0.84) and
white flour WE-AX (pentosans) (0.77) (Supplementary Figure S1)
The RV of aqueous extracts from single samples of wholemeal flours from the four
populations was therefore determined. This showed clear transgressive segregation
in the population derived from the cross with Valoris (which has high AX) (Figure 1),
but not in the populations derived from crosses between Yumai 34 and the average
AX lines: Altigo, (Figure 1), Claire and Ukrainka (Supplementary Figure S2).
The QTL identified in these crosses are shown in Table 2. Seven RV QTL were
identified on chromosomes 1AS, 1BL, 2BS, 2D, 3BL, 4DL, and 6BS: four in Y34Alt, 2
in Y34Cl, none in Y34Ukr and 3 in Y34Val. These QTL positions are projected onto
the genome of Chinese Spring (Appels et al 2018) in Figure 2. The relative mapped
positions of flanking and peak markers for 2D QTL may suggest rearrangement.
Where the QTL 1 LOD confidence intervals substantially overlap (green line on
figure) for the same trait in different populations we have made the assumption that
the underlying effect is the same. The increasing alleles for these QTL come from
Yumai 34 except for a QTL for RV on 1A in Y34Val and a QTL for RV on 6B in
Y34Val.
A major objective of this study was to understand the genetic basis of the high RV of
Yumai 34 so QTL with increasing alleles from this variety, of large effect, and

expressed in multiple populations are of particular interest. In this respect 1BL
stands out at LOD 12.6 and 7.8 in the Y34Alt and Y34Val populations, respectively,
accounting for 16.3% and 24.2% phenotypic variance. With additive effects of 0.53
and 0.99 RV units these QTL alone can deliver substitution effects of 1 to 2 RV units
in populations with mean RVs of 3 and 4.5. A weaker RV effect also detected in two
populations, Y34Alt and Y34Cl, is found on 3B. No other RV effects are detected in
more than one population.

Mapping TOT-AX determined by fingerprinting
Analyses of ten Y34Ukr lines (discussed above) showed that RV of aqueous extracts
of wholemeal was a poor predictor of TOT-AX (calculated as the sum of the AXOS
released) in white flour (r=0.38) (Supplementary Figure S1). We therefore
determined the amount of TOT-AX by enzyme fingerprinting of 3 replicate samples
of the Y34Ukr, Y34Cl and Y34Val populations.
Three TOT-AX QTL were identified in the Y34Ukr and Y34Cl populations. Both
populations segregated for a TOT-AX QTL on 1B with Yumai 34 carrying the
increasing allele. However, alignment to the wheat genome sequence (Fig 2) shows
that the location on 1B are very different, sub-telomeric 1BL in Y34Cl and subtelomeric 1BS in Y34Ukr. For the third TOT-AX QTL Ukrainka carries the increasing
allele on 1AS.

Coincidence of RV and TOT-AX QTL
Fig 2 shows how some of the QTL for the two traits mapped in the four populations
co-locate. The Claire TOT-AX QTL on 1BL co-locates with the QTL for RV from
Y34Alt and Y34Val, with Yumai 34 carrying the increasing allele in all cases. Two
further co-locating QTL are not shown in Table 2 or Figure 2 because the LOD
scores were below the cut-off. These were a QTL for TOT-AX in Y34Val (LOD 2.5)
and a QTL for RV in Y34Ukr (LOD2.3). Interestingly, a second TOT-AX QTL from
Y34Ukr is located on the opposite end of chromosome 1B (1BS).
QTLs for RV with Yumai 34 carrying the increasing allele were co-located on
chromosome 3B in Y34Alt and Y34Cl and were also identified on chromosomes 2B
(Y34Alt), 4D (Y34Alt) and 2B (Y34Cla).

Three QTL were identified in which Yumai 34 was not the increasing parent, for
TOT-AX and RV from Y34Ukr and Y34Val, respectively, which co-located on
chromosome 1A and for RV on chromosome 6B in Y34Val only.

Identification and validation of markers for the high AX QTL from Yumai 34
The QTLs identified on 1BL for which Yumai 34 alleles increased TOT-AX and/or RV
were prioritised for the development of KASP SNP assays which would allow
validation of the QTL effect in independent populations and the selection of high AX
Yumai 34 alleles in breeding programmes. The five Axiom markers nearest to the RV
QTL peak of Y34Alt were therefore selected for KASP marker development.

The

SNP BA00789946 detected by AX-94524314 was converted into a robust KASP
assay and used to genotype the Y34Alt population, giving exactly the same
segregation pattern as the corresponding Axiom marker.
The marker was then validated using high fibre breeding lines developed by
Tremmel-Bede et al. (2017) from crosses between Yumai 34 and conventional
cultivars. These lines were selected by determining the contents of WE-AX and TOTAX in white flour, showing increases in WE-AX of about 0.5% and in TOT-AX of
about 1% compared to the conventional parents. Of 11 high fibre lines selected from
a cross between Yumai 34 and the Ukrainian winter wheat cultivar Ukrainka, 9
carried the Yumai 34 allele of the BA00789946 KASP marker. The alleles in these
lines are shown together with the contents of WE-AX in white flour in Figure 3. A
second set of selections from the same study was genotyped from a cross between
Yumai 34 and the German wheat cultivar Lupus. Although no polymorphism was
detected using DNA from available accessions of Yumai 34 and Lupus, with both
carrying the Yumai34 allele of BA00789946, the nine high-fibre progeny did
segregate with eight carrying the Yumai 34 allele and one the alternative allele.
Discussion
We have used four crosses with the high fibre wheat cultivar Yumai 34 to identify
QTL for high RV and total AX fibre in white flour. Although a number of QTL were
mapped, which is consistent with earlier studies, most of these were only detected in
one or two crosses. However, all four crosses showed strong QTLs for high AX/RV
on chromosome 1B, with Yumai 34 being the increasing parent, although this
mapped to the 1BS in the Y34Ukr and to 1BL in the other crosses. Furthermore, a

KASP marker for the high AX Yumai 34 allele was validated by analysis of high AX
lines derived from Yumai 34 but selected by conventional biochemical analysis.
Previous studies have also shown QTLs for RV on chromosome 1B, including a QTL
on 1BL with a heritability of 27.4% in one population (Quraishi et al., 2011). This may
correspond to the 1BL QTL in Yumai 34, with the Yumai allele giving higher levels of
AX and RV. The two QTL on 1B described here appear to be genuinely independent.
We investigated whether a translocation present in Ukrainka might cause 1BL
markers in Y34Ukr to link with markers on 1BS, but there was no evidence for this
(data not shown). Moreover, the BA00789946 KASP assay is assigned to 1BL when
mapped using the Y34Ukr population, as in the other three crosses. Nevertheless,
this marker has strong predictive power for high fibre in the progeny selected from
crosses between Yumai 34 and Ukrainka, which supports the QTL for RV on 1BL in
this population even though the LOD score was below the cut-off.
The most likely explanation for the identification of a TOT-AX QTL on 1BS in the
cross with Ukrainka is that Yumai 34 does indeed carry AX increasing effects at both
ends of chromosome 1B. However, detecting linked QTLs requires higher statistical
power and it is likely that we did not detect the TOT-AX QTL on 1BL as significant in
the same cross due to insufficient power.

It is notable that only one cross, between Yumai 34 and the high AX cultivar Valoris,
showed significant transgressive segregation. Previous analysis of a cross between
Valoris and Isengrain (which has a normal AX level) identified a QTL on 6BL which
explained 58.4% of the heritability (Charmet et al., 2009; Quraishi et al., 2011). This
may correspond to the QTL identified on 6B in the Yumai 34 x Valoris cross,
although this QTL was mapped to 6BS not 6BL. The presence of the high AX allele
of the 1B QTL in Valoris probably accounted for the presence of transgressive
segregation, which indicates that it should be possible to stack the 1B and 6B QTLs,
and possibly also other high AX QTLs.
Experimental procedures
Production and growth of materials
Populations of Yumai 34 x Ukrainka, Yumai 34 x Claire and Yumai 34 x Valoris were
grown on three sites in the UK from 2012-2015 at Rothamsted Research,
Hertfordshire, AL5, 2JQ), Church Farm, Norfolk (NR9 3PY), UK, and KWS UK Ltd,

Thriplow, Cambridgeshire, SG8, 7RE, UK. At each field trial site three replicate 1m2
plots were grown per line in a randomised plot design. The populations Yumai 34 x
Valoris and Yumai 34 x Altigo were also grown at INRA, Clermont Ferrand, France in
two replicates of 7.5m² plots, 2013.
The cultivars Yumai 34, Hereward, Manital and Soisson varieties were also grown in
1.8 x 1m2 plots at Rothamsted Research in 2011/12. Analyses of non-starch
polysaccharides in white flours of these samples are given in Table 1 and
representative enzymatic fingerprinting data in Supplementary Table S1.
High fibre lines selected from a cross between Yumai 34 and Ukrainka were grown
at the Centre for Agricultural Research, Martonvásár.
Milling
White flour was produced using a Chopin CD1 mill. Grains were brought to room
temperature and moisture content determined using Bruker Minispec mq-20 NMR
analyser using an in-house developed calibration. 50g of grain was conditioned to
16.5% moisture overnight prior milling. First break and first reduction flours were
combined to give the white flour fraction.
Wholemeal flour was produced from mature grain of the crosses Yumai 34 x
Ukrainka, Yumai 34 x Claire using a Retch centrifugal mill with a 250μm sieve.
Wholemeal flours of the crosses Yumai 34 x Altigo and Yumai 34 x Valoris were
produced by ball milling at 8oC with a 500μm sieve.
All wholemeal and white flour samples were immediately stored at -20oC prior to use.

Determination of relative viscosity (RV)
RV of aqueous extracts of white flours and of wholemeal flours of the crosses Yumai
34 x Ukrainka and Yumai 34 x Claire were determined at 30 °C using an automated
viscometer (AVS 370, SI Analytics, Germany) fitted with a Micro Ostwald capillary (2
mL, 0.43 mm) and WinVisco software (Freeman et al., 2016). Relative viscosities of
wholemeal flours of the crosses Yumai 34 x Altigo and Yumai 34 x Valoris were
determined at 30 °C using an automated viscometer (AVS 310, CV (%) 23 22 8
Schott Gerate, Germany) fitted with an Ostwald capillary (2 mL, 0·4 mm) (Saulnier et
al., 1995).

by

monosaccharide analysis, by GC-FID of alditol acetates as described by Gebruers et
al. (2009) using the method of Englyst et al. (1995). Results were adjusted for the
presence of arabinogalactan as described in Gebruers et al. (2009).
Total and water-extractable (WE) AX were also determined in wholemeal and white
flour samples from 3 replicate plots with two technical replications using the method
described in Finnie et al., 2006 based upon the method of Douglas (1981).
Enzymatic fingerprinting of AX was as described by Lovegrove et al. (2013). White
flour was digested using a mixture of endoxylanase and lichenase (β-glucanase) to
release arabinoxylan oligosaccharides (AXOS) and glucan fragments comprising 3
and 4 residues (G3, G4), respectively. These were separated using a Carbopac PA1 (Dionex) column with dimensions 2 mm × 250 mm and the flow rate of 0.25 mL/min
based upon the original method of Ordaz-Ortiz et al. (2005). At least two technical
replicates of each biological replicate were analysed. The areas under the AXOS
peaks were combined to determine TOT-AX (expressed in arbitrary units).

Markers and mapping
Genetic maps were constructed using KASP single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
markers or the Axiom 35K breeders array. New KASP markers were developed,
where necessary, from SNPs detected by Axiom markers using assays shown on
Cerealsdb predesigned using polymarker (Ramirez et al 2015). The KASP primers
used for SNP BA00789946 (shown as AX-94524314 on the genetic maps presented
here) were: acaactaactatgcaagtgcca (FAM labelled), acaactaactatgcaagtgccg (VIC
labelled) and ggatgacacatctcaagaaaaagaa. Standard conditions for the KASP PCR
were used, with a hydrocycler and a touchdown of 65OC to 57 OC.
