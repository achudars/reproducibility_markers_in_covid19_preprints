Abstract

27

Emotional contagion has recently been described in fish but whether it is affected by

28

familiarity is not known. We tested whether the sight of a distressed conspecific elicited fear

29

in zebrafish, and whether this was modulated by familiarity. Groups of six zebrafish were

30

housed together in the same tanks for 7 days to create familiar conditions. The behaviour of

31

individual fish was then recorded in paired tanks within sight of either a familiar or an

32

unfamiliar individual, before and after distilled water or an alarm substance was added to the

33

demonstrator, but not to the observer. As expected, addition of distilled water did not elicit

34

any behavioural change in either the demonstrator or the observer. However, addition of an

35

alarm cue triggered anti-predatory behaviours in the demonstrator which caused the

36

expression of anti-predatory behaviours in the observer, suggesting the existence of fear

37

contagion. Furthermore, the extent of fear contagion was affected by familiarity, and

38

observers were more active, swam closer to the bottom and further away from the

39

demonstrator when they watched a distressed familiar neighbour than when they watched an

40

unfamiliar fish. Our results have implications for fish welfare because they show that fish can

41

become stressed by simply watching others become stressed. They also have implications for

42

experimental design because fish housed in separate tanks cannot be assumed to be

43

statistically independent if they can eavesdrop on their neighbours.

Introduction

52

Emotional contagion can be defined as the instantaneous matching of emotional state

53

between an observer and a demonstrator (Nakahashi & Ohtsuki, 2018). This phenomenon has

54

been explained through the perception-action mechanism, which postulates that the

55

perception of a demonstrator’s state triggers a neural, unconscious and automatic

56

representation of the same state in the observer, causing an equivalent expression of

57

behaviours (Preston & de Waal, 2002). Emotional contagion is considered a component and

58

evolutionary precursor of empathy (Preston & de Waal, 2002) and has been demonstrated in

59

humans, birds and mammals (Gonzalez-Liencres et al., 2014; Reimert et al., 2014).

60

To evaluate emotional contagion studies have typically focussed on negative

61

emotional states such as stress, pain and fear (Carnevali et al., 2017). A common measure of

62

fear in rodents is freezing behaviour, which can be triggered by a mild electric shock (Lezak

63

et al., 2017; Pisansky et al., 2017). Fear elicited in this way propagates from frightened

64

demonstrators to naïve observers, resulting in increased frequency of freezing (Jeon et al.,

65

2010; Knapp et. al, 2007; Knapska et al., 2006) and activation of the amygdala in the

66

observer (Knapska et al., 2006). Moreover, it seems that how an emotion is shared between

67

individuals is modulated by contextual aspects such as kinship, familiarity and social

68

closeness (Liévin-Bazin et al., 2018; Preston & de Waal, 2002). For instance, when mice are

69

paired with distressed demonstrators they tend to freeze if they had been reared together, but

70

become more active if they come from different cages (Gonzalez-Liencres et al., 2014). In

71

addition, pain perception in mice is more intense when observers are familiar with

72

demonstrators than when they are strangers (Langford et al., 2006). Observers typically

73

respond differently to signals sent by familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics (Gonzalez-

74

Liencres et al., 2014; Jeon et al., 2010), a strategy thought to be adaptive as it can help avoid

75

sensory overload (Hutchinson, 2005) and focuses attention on signals emitted by those

76

neighbours that matter the most, including ‘nasty neighbours’ and ‘dear enemies’ (Müller &

77

Manser, 2007).

78

A recent study has provided evidence for fear contagion in zebrafish (Oliveira et al.,

79

2017), which suggests that this phenomenon may be conserved among social vertebrates.

80

However, to what extent fear contagion in fishes can be affected by the degree of familiarity

81

between demonstrators and observers is not known. Familiarity can broadly be defined as the

82

ability to discriminate between individuals based on previous interactions, and is influenced

83

by the time of interaction and the size of the group among fishes (Griffiths, 2003).

84

Here we used dyadic behavioural tests to assess if fear contagion was affected by

85

familiarity in zebrafish. To this end, demonstrators were exposed to either distilled water or

86

an alarm substance, known to cause a fear response on this species (Kalueff et al., 2013).

87

Zebrafish are highly social (Gerlai, 2010), can discriminate familiar from unfamiliar fish after

88

only 20 min of interaction (Hinz et al., 2013; Madeira & Oliveira, 2017), and form cohesive

89

groups when under threat (Speedie & Gerlai, 2008). Therefore, we hypothesized that

90

observers would show a heightened fear response to the sight of distressed demonstrators

91

when they had been reared together (i.e. were familiar), than when they had been reared apart

92

(i.e. were unfamiliar).

Methods & Materials

95

Experimental fish and husbandry conditions

96

Two month old, laboratory-reared zebrafish (Danio rerio) of homogeneous size were sourced

97

from a local supplier and kept in four 50 L tanks (density = 2 fish/L) connected to a

98

recirculation system for four months before testing. Water quality was maintained by

99

mechanical, biological and chemical filtration, in addition to UV disinfection. Water

100

temperature was kept at 28 ± 1°C, pH at 7.2 and ammonia and nitrite at recommended

101

optimal levels for the species. Photoperiod was set at 12D:12L with the help of fluorescent

102

lights (150 lumens) with the start of the light phase set at 7:00 hrs. Fish were fed commercial

103

pellets twice a day (Nutricom Pet, 38% protein, 4% lipids) and Artemia salina once daily.

104

105

Development of familiar and unfamiliar groups

106

Seven days prior to testing, a sample of 156 adults of both sexes was collected haphazardly

107

from the four stock tanks, mixed, and allocated at random in groups of six to 26 x 20 L glass

108

aquaria (40L x 20W x 25 H cm). Aquaria were filled with system water, were fitted with a

109

sponge filter to maintain water quality, and had their bottom and sides covered with white

110

plastic sheets to prevent visual contact with others groups. Food was offered twice a day, as

111

above.

112

113

Acclimation period

114

After seven days of being reared in groups of six, two individuals from either the same or

115

different aquaria (i.e. familiar or unfamiliar conditions) were transferred to two 2L test

116

aquaria (20L x 10W x 20H cm) placed side by side and left to acclimatize for 18 hours prior

117

to testing, one fish serving as a ‘demonstrator’ and the other as an ‘observer’. To ensure that

118

unfamiliar fish would not become ‘familiar’ during the acclimation period, a removable

119

divider was placed between the two test aquaria, so that demonstrator and observer had no

120

visual contact until the divider was lifted just prior to testing. Similarly, and in order to avoid

121

a potential disruption of familiar dyads, these were acclimated without dividers, in full sight

122

of each other. To test if this could have affected their subsequent behaviour, we tested 8

123

additional familiar dyads acclimatized with dividers, and compared their behaviour to

124

familiar dyads acclimatized without dividers.

125

126

Testing of fear contagion

127

Following the 18h acclimation period, the divider preventing visual contact was removed and

128

the demonstrator and observer were simultaneously recorded (Sony DCR-SX45 Digital VCR)

129

for 5 min (basal behaviour). A syringe connected to a small silicon tube was then used to

130

remotely deliver 2 ml of either distilled water or an alarm substance to the demonstrator

131

(delivery being allocated at random), and their behaviours were recorded at 10 minute

132

intervals over an hour, as shown schematically in Figure 1. To obtain the alarm substance,

133

one zebrafish from the stock tanks was euthanized by an overdose of clove oil (2 ml/L water),

134

and c. 1 cm² of skin from each flank was removed, macerated in 10 ml of distilled water and

135

filtered. Fresh alarm substance was prepared every morning before testing.

136

We tested 48 dyads exposed to alarm substance (24 unfamiliar and 24 familiar) and 20

137

dyads exposed to distilled water (10 unfamiliar and 10 familiar). In addition, 20

138

demonstrators (10 exposed to alarm substance and 10 exposed to distilled water) were tested

139

without observers to ascertain which behaviours were modified by the addition of the alarm

140

substance, and to what extent the presence of observers influenced the demonstrator’s

141

behaviour. Fish were only used once in the experiments, either as observers or demonstrators.

142

The 10 ml of alarm substance obtained from one fish was enough to test five dyads, thus for

143

all the experiments 12 zebrafish were used for the preparation of alarm substance.

162

We used ZebTrack (Pinheiro-da-Silva et al., 2016) to extract from the video recordings six

163

behavioural metrics that had previously been shown to describe well the stress response of

164

zebrafish (Gerlai et al, 2008; Luca & Gerlai, 2012; Tran & Gerlai, 2013), namely : (1) mean

165

swimming speed, (2) maximum swimming speed, (3) total distance travelled, (4) time spent

166

freezing, (5) swimming depth (i.e. distance from the tank bottom) and (6) mean distance to

167

the conspecific’s tank.

168

169

Statistical Analysis

170

Statistical analysis was conducted in R v. 3.4.3 (R Core Team 2013). Our experiment

171

conformed to a fully factorial 2 x 2 x 2 BACI design (before-after-control-impact) and we

172

modelled the behaviour of the observer (dependent variable) as a linear mixed effect model

173

using the lme4 (Bates et al., 2014) and lmerTest (Kuznetsova et al., 2017) R packages. We

174

used as fixed effects (predictors) the behaviour of the demonstrator, the time (before or after

175

the stressor was added), the familiarity (familiar vs unfamiliar dyad) and the stressor type

176

(alarm substance vs distilled water), and considered the dyad identity as a random effect to

177

control for variation among test arenas and account for potential non-independence of

178

observations. For each behavioural metric, we started with a maximal model with all main

179

effects and interactions and used the step and dredge functions in the MuMIn package

180

(Bartoń, 2013) to arrive at a minimal adequate model via Maximum Likelihood on the basis

181

of single deletion tests and relative changes in AICc values. The most plausible model was

182

refitted by REML and the model adequacy and assumptions were checked by examining

183

plots of fitted vs residuals, fitted vs observed values, as well as plots of random effects and

184

standardized fixed effects using the sjPlot package (Lüdecke, 2016). We report all models

185

within ∆AICc = 2. One dyad had missing values so there were 134 observations

186

corresponding to 67 dyads.

187

To better assess the extent to which observers were able to match the overall behaviour of

188

demonstrators, we also carried out a principal components analysis and modelled the scores

189

along the first two first principal components (which together explained 96% of variation) as

190

a function of fish type (observer or demonstrator) and degree of familiarity.

Results

197

Response to alarm cues (single tests)

198

Inspection of temporal data (Supplementary Material, Figure S1) indicated that the response

199

of single fish to alarm cues was rapid and did not persist for more than 10 minutes after the

200

administration of the alarm substance (probably due to habituation). We, therefore,

201

concentrated the analysis on the first 10 minutes after addition of the stimuli. Compared to

202

baseline values, the addition of an alarm cue resulted in an increase in average swimming

203

speed and time spent freezing that was not observed when distilled water was added (average

204

speed, before-after = 6.20, SE = 0.81, t17 = 7.68, P < 0.001; blank-alarm =7.08, SE = 1.11,

205

t27.19 = 6.36, P < 0.001; after x alarm= -6.39, SE = 1.11, t17 = -5.75, P < 0.001; time spent

206

freezing, before-after = 118.7, SE = 13.24, t18 = 8.97, P < 0.001; blank-alarm =110.6, SE =

207

13.52, t35.94 = 8.18, P < 0.001, after x alarm = -105.56, SE = 18.72, t18 = -5.64, P < 0.001) .

208

Fish also stayed closer to the bottom after alarm cue or distilled water were added (before-

209

after = -3.50, SE = 1.00, t18 = -3.49, P = 0.002), but no significant change was detected in

210

relation to maximum speed or distance travelled (P > 0.05; Supplementary Material, Figure

211

S1) and these were not considered any further. Results also indicated that whether familiar

212

demonstrators were visually isolated or not during the 18 hrs of acclimation did not affect

213

their subsequent behaviours (Supplementary Material, Table S1).

Fear Contagion from Demonstrators to Observers (dyadic tests)

216

Swimming Speed

217

As expected from the single tests above, demonstrators in the dyadic tests increased their

218

average swimming speed when an alarm substance was added, but not when distilled water

219

was added (Figure 2). Observers responded by increasing their speed when the demonstrator

220

was unfamiliar, but by decreasing it when the demonstrator was familiar (Figure 2; estimate

237

As expected also from the single tests above, demonstrators spent more time freezing when

238

an alarm substance was added, but not when distilled water was added (Figure 3). The time

239

observers spent freezing increased when an alarm substance was added to the demonstrator

240

(estimate = 0.85, P < 0.001), and also with time (estimate = 0.90, P < 0.001), but was

241

negatively correlated with the time spent freezing by the demonstrators (estimate = -0.19, P =

242

0.024). There was a significant interaction between time and stressor (estimate = 0.63, P <

243

0.001) as observers only increased the time spent freezing over basal values when the alarm

244

substance was added, not when distilled water was added. Familiarity, hence, did not

245

influence the freezing response, which was very strong under both conditions.

253

Following the addition of the alarm substance, demonstrators moved closer to the bottom of

254

the tank, a behaviour not seen when distilled water was added. Observers mimicked this

255

behaviour (Figure 4), tracking what the demonstrator did (estimate = 0.19, P = 0.033).

256

Swimming depth increased over basal values (estimate = 0.23, P = 0.011), as well as with the

257

addition of the alarm cue (estimate = 0.31, P = 0.018). There were significant interactions

258

between demonstrator’s depth and familiarity (estimate = 0.25, P = 0.03), demonstrator’s

259

depth and time (estimate = 0.25, P = 0.002), familiarity and time (estimate = 0.44, P <

0.001), familiarity and stressor (estimate = 0.54, P < 0.001), and familiarity x time x stressor

261

(estimate = 0.28, P = 0.003). There was, hence, evidence of fear contagion which was also

affected by familiarity.

269

Following the addition of the alarm substance to the demonstrator, the observer swam closer

270

to the demonstrator’s tank (Figure 5, estimate = 0.60, P < 0.001), something that did not

271

happen when distilled water was added. Distance to the demonstrator decreased over basal

272

values (estimate = 0.43, P = 0.005) but increased with familiarity (estimate = 0.16, P = 0.031)

273

and was also affected by the interactions between demonstrator and time (estimate = 0.36, P

274

= 0.03), and between time and stressor (estimate = -0.49, P < 0.001). There was thus

275

evidence of fear contagion with respect to proximity to the other fish’s tank and this also

seemed to be influenced by familiarity.

284

PCA analysis showed that the behaviour of demonstrators and observers was similar and

285

showed little variation among individuals when the fish were not stressed (i.e. when distilled

286

water was added or before an alarm cue was added, Figure 6a-c, Figure 6e-g). The first

287

component, PC1, accounted for 89.8% of the variation and described freezing behaviour,

288

while PC2 accounted for 5.9% of the variation and described variation in swimming speed

289

and proximity to the conspecific. No statistical difference between observer and

290

demonstrators was found along PC1 (F3,90 = 0.847, P = 0.472), but there was a marked

291

difference along PC2 (F3,90 = 68.52, P <0.001; Figure 6d, Figure 6h) which depended on the

292

DISCUSSION

352

Our study provides novel evidence in support for the existence of fear contagion in fish, and

353

suggests that this is influenced by familiarity, as shown for mammals (Gonzalez-Liencres, et

354

al 2014; Jeon et al., 2010). The alarm response of zebrafish has been characterised by an

355

increase in swimming speed interspersed with freezing bouts and diving to the bottom

356

(Kalueff et al., 2013). To trigger a fear response we added an alarm substance to the water,

357

schreckstoff, (von Frisch, 1938), a well-established stressor for zebrafish (Jesuthasan &

358

Mathuru, 2008). As expected, the addition of the alarm substance triggered a flight response

359

in zebrafish, which swam faster, moved to deeper waters, and included bouts of freezing

360

behaviour, something not observed when distilled water was added. Such anti-predatory

361

behaviours were mimicked to some extent by the observers, even though they had no direct

362

exposure to the stressor. Thus, the mere sight of a distressed conspecific was enough to

363

trigger in the observer the same fear response experienced and displayed by the demonstrator.

364

Our study shows that fear contagion is modulated by familiarity in zebrafish, since

365

three of the four responses examined varied depending on whether the observers were

366

watching individuals they were familiar with. Compared to unfamiliar demonstrators,

367

observers responded to the sight of familiar demonstrators by matching their swimming

368

speeds more closely, and by moving closer to the bottom. Observers also moved closer to the

369

demonstrator at the sight of a distressed conspecific, but - perhaps unexpectedly, this was

370

more pronounced when they were paired with unfamiliar demonstrators. These results add

371

support to evidence indicating that fish are capable of identifying and reacting to the

372

behaviour of conspecifics (Jesuthasan & Mathuru, 2008; Rey et al., 2015). In social species,

373

fear contagion is thought to be adaptive as it will often increase the probability of escaping

374

from predators (Nakahashi & Ohtsuki, 2018).

375

Among fishes, several studies have shown that familiarity increases shoal cohesion

376

(Chivers et al. 1995; Lachlan et al. 1998) and facilitates social learning (Swaney et al., 2001),

377

and our study shows that familiarity also affects fear contagion, which may explain why

378

association with familiar fish is generally adaptive (Griffiths, 2003). For example, familiar

379

brown trout respond 14% faster than unfamiliar fish to a predator attack (Griffiths et al.

380

2004), most likely because they can interpret signals from familiar fish more accurately.

381

Familiarity in our study was established rapidly, after only seven days of cohabitation, which

382

is consistent with previous results in zebrafish (Madeira & Oliveira, 2017) and other species

383

(Griffiths, 2003), where individuals were able to recognize familiar neighbours after short

384

periods of interaction. Although it is possible that some individuals in our study may have

385

become familiar in the stock tanks (i.e., before the 7 day cohabitation experiment), this is

386

unlikely as the group size was too large (100 fish/tank) for individual recognition (Griffiths &

387

Magurran, 1997), fish were mixed and allocated at random to 26 groups, and this would not

388

explain why familiar and unfamiliar fish behaved so differently.

389

The advantages of familiarity may be accrued through visual recognition, but also

390

through chemical cues (Griffiths, 2003), as fish can recognize the metabolites of conspecifics

391

released in the water (Ward et al. 2009). Zebrafish can use both chemical and visual cues for

392

individual recognition (Hinz et al., 2013), but our study indicates that visual signals alone are

393

enough to trigger fear contagion, as familiar fish behaved differently from unfamiliar fish

394

when no chemical signals were exchanged between observers and demonstrators. The strong

395

shoaling behaviour of zebrafish may help explain the evolution of fear contagion on this

396

species. Unlike social learning, which is thought to have evolved to facilitate the long-term

397

transmission and storage of information (Brown & Laland, 2003), fear contagion may have

398

evolved to deal with rapid, short-term signals and swift responses, such as the anti-predatory

399

response (Nakahashi & Ohtsuki, 2015).

400

It has been proposed that behavioural contagion should be heightened when the

401

demonstrator displays abnormal or extreme behaviours (Nakahashi & Ohtsuki, 2015).

402

Freezing is an extreme behaviour that can be induced by alarm substances and is commonly

403

seen in many fish species in response to predators (Gerlai et al. 2000; Gerlai & Csányi 1990;

404

Miklosi el al. 1997; Roberts et al. 2011; Roberts & Garcia de Leaniz, 2011). In this sense, the

405

increased duration in freezing bouts following exposure to the alarm substance was highly

406

contagious in our study, but it was not affected by familiarity. We suggest that for zebrafish,

407

freezing behaviour constitutes a more robust signal of danger than bottom dwelling or an

408

increase in swimming speed. Hence, it may be adaptive for an individual to freeze when

409

another one is freezing, regardless of the sender’s identity. On the other hand, changes in

410

swimming speed or in the position in the water column form part of the normal behaviour of

411

zebrafish (Kalueff et al., 2013) and may represent less extreme, and hence less reliable,

412

signals.

413

Our results show that zebrafish can not only distinguish between familiar and

414

unfamiliar conspecifics by visual cues alone, but that they can also eavesdrop on their

415

neighbours living in separate tanks and adjust their behaviour accordingly. This may have

416

implications for fish welfare if, for example, fish can become stressed simply by watching

417

their neighbours become stressed. In the wild, eavesdropping may be adaptive as it allows

418

zebrafish to acquire information on predatory threat from shoal neighbours (Abril-De-Abreu

419

et al., 2015; Oliveira et al., 2017), but the implications for fish welfare in captivity deserve

420

further attention. In livestock, contagion of negative emotions such as fear and anxiety can

421

impair the behaviour and health of the group (Reimert et al., 2013), and our study suggests

422

that the same could happen in zebrafish.

423

Our results also have implications for experimental design because fish housed in

424

separate tanks may not be assumed to be statistically independent (Colegrave & Ruxton,

19

425

2017) if their behaviour is affected by that of others. Visual isolation of tanks, therefore, must

426

be ensured to prevent eavesdropping. Ultimately, our study indicates that fish are capable of

427

recognizing and mimicking individual behaviours and place them into the right context.

428

Future studies might benefit from investigating if behavioural contagion also occurs in

429

relation to positive stimuli (such as access to food, mates, or enriched habitats) as this could

430

perhaps be used to improve welfare.
