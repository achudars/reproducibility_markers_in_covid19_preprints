Gametophyte sex-related differences in temperature response

38

Highlight

39

The transcriptomic basis for sexual dimorphism and associated metabolic needs are described for

40

the kelp Saccharina latissima. Temperature modulates sex-biased gene expression resulting in a

41

stronger stress response in females.

Abstract

44

Saccharina latissima is an economically and ecologically relevant kelp species in Europe and

45

North America. In kelps, the sexuality is expressed during the haploid life stage and the

46

microscopic gametophytes exhibit significant sexual dimorphism. To understand the sex-

47

dependent impact of temperature on the gametophyte stage, we analyzed for the first time, gene

48

expression profiles of male and female gametophytes at three different temperatures (4°C, 12°C

49

and 20°C) characteristic for the species distribution range by using RNA-sequencing. We

50

identified several differentially expressed genes between sexes; while female biased genes were

51

enriched in general metabolism and energy production, male biased genes function within cell

52

cycle and signaling. In our study, temperature modulated sex-biased gene expression, with only a

53

small percentage of differentially expressed genes consistently male (7%) or female-biased

54

(12%) at the three temperatures. Female gametophytes responded stronger to higher temperatures

55

than males, suggesting that males are more heat tolerant. Differences between S. latissima and

56

other brown algal gender-dependent gene expression might mirror the different evolutionary and

57

ecological contexts. Genomic information on kelp gametophyte is still scarce and thus this study

58

adds to our knowledge on sex differences in abiotic stress responses in macroalgae at the

59

transcriptomic level.

Introduction

65

Kelps (order Laminariales, Phaeophyceae) feature a haplo-diplontic life cycle in which

66

microscopic haploid gametophytes alternate with macroscopic diploid sporophytes. The two

67

stages are very distinct: sporophytes are structured in holdfast, stipe and blade featuring different

68

tissues (cortex and medulla) and may reach up to several meters in length, while gametophytes

69

are composed of one to few cells (Hurd et al., 2014b). These morphological differences between

70

the life stages entail different susceptibility to abiotic stressors (Coelho et al., 2000), namely high

71

irradiance, ultraviolet radiation and temperature (e.g. Bolton and Lüning, 1982; Fredersdorf et

72

al., 2009; Gao et al., 2019). Therefore, any prediction of future impacts of global warming on

73

kelps must not only consider the responses of the sporophytes but also of the other life-history

74

stages (Assis et al., 2017; Leal et al., 2018; Roleda, 2016).

75

Reproduction in kelps is tightly connected to environmental cues. Gametophytes may enter

76

gametogenesis under the specific combination of nutrients, light and temperature or remain

77

vegetative if conditions are not favorable (Bartsch, 2018; Martins et al., 2017). In the latter case,

78

vegetative gametophytes are considered to be dormant and may act as a “seed bank” allowing for

79

the recovery of the population after a disturbance, e.g. storms or heat-waves (Barradas et al.,

80

2011; Edwards, 2000). Moreover, vegetative gametophytes might be more resistant than

81

macroscopic sporophytes to heat stress during summer, especially at the rear edge of the

82

distribution. Lee and Brinkhuis (1986) suggested that the gametophyte and/or early life stages of

83

Saccharina latissima “oversummer” at the southern distribution limit in USA, as sporophytes are

84

not visible during the hot summer months but are already found in early autumn. Hsiao and

85

Druehl (1973) reported gametophyte survival and gamete production of S. latissima throughout

86

the year, however absence of macroscopic sporophytes during later spring and summer. Given

87

the challenges of studying the microscopic stages in the field, the relevance of the vegetative

88

gametophyte pool for population dynamics is not well understood (Schiel and Foster, 2006).

89

Nevertheless, manipulation of life-cycle transitions is a common practice in aquaculture to allow

90

for year-round production of sporophytes (Charrier et al., 2017). Control of gametogenesis starts

91

by separating male and female gametophytes based on their sexual dimorphism. After spore

92

release and germination, sexual dimorphism soon becomes visible: while female gametophytes

93

are constituted of a few bigger rounder cells that tend to grow in diameter, male cells are much

94

smaller and increase faster in cell numbers (Lüning and Neushul, 1978). Under non-fertilizing

95

conditions, male and female gametophytes form vegetative filaments consisting of several cells

96

that are able to continuously grow over decades (e.g.Martins et al., 2019) and may form mm-

97

sized clumps (Bartsch, 2018). The significance of sex to differences in performance, behavior

98

and ecology are also currently understudied in brown algae (Luthringer et al., 2014). Sexual

99

dimorphism is to a large extent mediated by differential gene expression between sexes in a wide

100

variety of organisms (Ellegren and Parsch, 2007). Up to the present, only a few gametophyte

101

gene expression datasets are available for brown algae: Ectocarpus spp. (order Ectocarpales)

102

(Lipinska et al., 2015), Undaria pinnatifida (Shan et al., 2015), Saccharina japonica (order

103

Laminariales) (Ye et al., 2015), S. latissima (GA Pearson et al. 2019, unpublished data).

104

Transcriptomic differences between sexes in Phaeophyceae have been seldom explored, except

105

for reproductive tissues in Fucus vesiculosus (Martins et al., 2013), S. japonica gametophytes

106

(Bi and Zhou, 2014) Ectocarpus spp. gametophytes and gametes (Lipinska et al., 2015; Lipinska

107

et al., 2013) and in S. latissima gametophytes in response to gametogenesis induction and light

108

quality changes (GA Pearson et al. 2019, unpublished data). Furthermore, so far, the influence of

109

temperature has not been addressed. In the present study we provide the first data on

110

transcriptomic responses of male and female gametophytes of the sugar kelp, S. latissima, to

111

temperature. Saccharina latissima is a relevant foundation species in temperate to Arctic coasts

112

(Steneck et al., 2002; Teagle et al., 2017) and it is the selected species in several aquaculture

113

facilities in Europe and North America (Broch et al., 2018; Forbord et al., 2012; Kim et al.,

114

2015).

115

Our experiment targeted gametophytes of S. latissima originating from Helgoland (German

116

Bight, North Sea) representing its center of distribution in respect to latitude (Araújo et al.,

117

2016). Despite this, summer temperatures observed at this site are high (up to 20°C) (Breitbach

118

et al., 2016) and close to the upper thermal tolerance limit of the species (Bolton and Lüning,

119

1982). Moreover, a decline in S. latissima relative presence and abundance has been described in

120

Helgoland recently and were paralleled by increases in temperature and water clarity (Pehlke and

121

Bartsch, 2008).

122

To our knowledge, this is the first study targeting brown algae gametophyte responses to

123

temperature at the gene expression level. Hence, the present dataset will largely contribute to the

124

understanding of the genomic basis of sex-specific differences in response to the environment of

125

brown algae.

Algal material and experimental design

130

Gametophytes from uniparental stock cultures of Saccharina latissima (formerly Laminaria

131

saccharina L. (Lamour) (Lane et al., 2006) (AWI culture number 3094 ( males) and 3096

132

(females)) from Helgoland, Germany were cultivated in glass flasks under red light (16hL:8hD)

133

at 12°C ( ±1°C) in an environmentally controlled room. Sterile seawater enriched with an

134

adapted Provasoli medium without the addition of iron was replaced weekly. These conditions

135

prevented the onset of gametogenesis (Lewis et al., 2013; Lüning and Dring, 1975; Motomura

136

and Sakai, 1981), which was checked under the microscope regularly. To eliminate the

137

confounding factor of red irradiance in our transcriptomic analysis, red light was replaced by

138

white light with a photon fluence rate of 10 - 15 µmol photons m-2 s -1 (16hL:8hD) provided by

139

fluorescent lamps OSRAM L 18W for one week prior to and during the experiment. These

140

conditions retained our gametophytes’ cultures at a vegetative stage. At the start of the

141

experiment 3.10 +/- 0.10 g of fresh weight of female gametophyte clumps and 2.20 +/- 0.10g of

142

male gametophytes clumps were each transferred separately to plastic petri dishes (diameter 9.5

143

cm x height 3 cm) (n=4) and exposed to three temperatures (4°C, 12°C and 20°C). Experimental

144

temperatures were chosen to mirror mean minimum (4°C) and maximum temperatures (20°C) at

145

Helgoland (Breitbach et al., 2016) and a control temperature (12°C) that falls within optimal

146

growth range for the species (Bolton and Lüning, 1982; Lee and Brinkhuis, 1988). Experiments

147

were conducted in three environmentally controlled rooms and additionally temperatures were

148

kept constant by circulating water baths (models Haake DC1, VWR 1136D). After 14 days of

149

temperature exposure, gametophytes were sampled for RNA extraction. Samples were frozen in

150

liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until further use. RNA extraction was performed within three

151

weeks after sampling.

152

Maximum photosynthetic quantum yield of PS II (Fv/Fm) was measured at the start and end of

153

the experiment (n=4). Gametophytes were dark-adapted for 10 min prior to the measurements.

154

Afterwards, Fv/Fm was measured with an Imaging PAM (Pulse Amplitude Fluorometer; Walz,

155

Effeltrich, Germany).

156

Fresh weight (n=4) was measured at the beginning and at the end of the experiment with a

157

laboratory scale 40SM-200A (PRECISA, Switzerland). All data were tested for normality using

158

the Shapiro-Wilk normality test and for homogeneity of variances using the Levene’s test.

159

Differences in growth and Fv/Fm were tested using a two-way ANOVA with the fixed factors

temperature and sex. Significant differences and interaction of means were compared with the

161

post hoc Tukey test (HSD). All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS software version

RNA extraction, Illumina sequencing and data processing

165

Total RNA extraction was conducted using the method described in Heinrich et al. (2012). RNA

166

quality was analysed by the NanoDrop ND-1000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer and Agilent 2100

167

Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Germany). Three biological replicates per treatment were

168

sequenced. cDNA libraries were prepared with an Illumina TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit

169

according to the manufacturer protocol. The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq 2500

170

and 75 bp paired reads were clipped using default values of the Illumina software. Raw reads

171

were quality controlled by FastQC (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)

172

and quality filtered using Trimmomatic v. 0.36 (Bolger et al., 2014). Quality filtering was

173

performed using the following parameters: leading 3, trailing 3, sliding window 4:15, minlen 30.

174

The Illumina sequence reads generated during the present study are available in the Array

175

express

176

(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-8267/).

177

Reads from all treatments (three temperatures x two sexes) were assembled de novo the RNAseq

178

assembler Trinity v 2.4.0 with default parameters including the reads normalization step

179

corresponding to the Trinity implementation of the diginorm method (Grabherr et al., 2011). The

180

quality of the transcriptome assemblies was evaluated by using BUSCO v3.0.2 (Waterhouse et

181

al., 2017) applying an eukaryote dataset (OrthoDB v9.1). Gametophytes reads were pseudo-

182

aligned with Salmon (Patro et al., 2017) against the de novo assembled transcriptome, the

183

previously assembled sporophyte transcriptome (Li et al., 2019, Array express:E-MTAB-7348),

184

the available S. japonica genome (Ye et al., 2015) and previously assembled transcriptomes of S.

185

latissima (Heinrich et al., 2012; Jackson et al., 2017). A PCA plot of the counts-per-million,

186

followed by a log2 transformation, of all treatments was generated by a Trinity script.

187

Differential expression was calculated using DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) at Trinity’s gene level

188

with an adjusted level of P≤0.001 and a log2 fold change of at least 2 indicating significance.

189

Tools were executed using the scripts included in the Trinity package v 2.4.0 (Grabherr et al.,

190

2011). Functional annotation was performed using the Trinotate functional annotation pipeline

Photosynthetic efficiency and growth

203

To estimate overall fitness of the gametophytes, we assessed maximum photosynthetic quantum

204

yield by measuring Fv/Fm and fresh weight at the beginning and end of the experiment. There

205

was no significant effect of temperature and sex on fresh weight of gametophytes, measured as

206

percentage of initial at the end of the 14 days exposure (temperature, p=0.159, sex, p=0.525). In

207

all treatments a modest increase in fresh weight up to a maximum of 20% in females at 12°C was

208

observed. No significant treatment changes were detected for Fv/Fm (data not shown).

209
210

De novo transcriptome

211

To explore patterns of gene expression, we sequenced RNA obtained from male and female

212

gametophyte samples exposed to three different temperatures (4°C, 12°C and 20°C). The number

213

of reads per library ranged from 20 to 42 million with an average of 33 million reads. The

214

remapping rate of gametophytes cDNA libraries on the de novo assembled transcriptome was on

215

average 86% which is 5 to 18 % better than on other available transcriptomes assemblies (data

216

not shown). The transcriptome assembly consisted of transcripts with more than 1 transcript per

217

million (TPM) in a total of 256,118 transcripts (corresponding to 211,947 Trinity genes) with an

218

average contig size of 713 bp and N50 of 1350 bp. This high total number of genes is a common

219

feature of the Trinity pipeline (e.g. Bryant et al., 2017). Ninety per cent of total expression was

220

present in 58,741 of transcripts with a N50 of 1895 bp. Results of BUSCO analysis indicate that

221

our transcriptome has near-complete gene sequence information for 93% of the genes, 34%

complete and single-copy BUSCOs, 59% completed and duplicated BUSCOs, 5% fragmented

223

BUSCOs and 1% missing BUSCOs (Supplementary Table S1). 36,379 transcripts were

224

functionally annotated using the UniProt Swiss-Prot database, 33,606 using Pfam and 60,961

225

with Uniref90 and 45,240 using NR. A total of 14,240 GO terms and 17,562 KEGG orthology

226

(KO) were assigned to the transcripts.

228

Sex-biased gene expression at the control temperature

229

Several analyses performed in our dataset revealed distinct transcriptomic profiles between male

230

and female gametophytes of S. latissima. Gender explained 34% of the variability in the

231

transcriptome as shown in the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (Figure 1). The second axis

232

of the PCA accounted for 16% of the variability and divided between the three temperatures

233

tested. Many genes were differentially expressed between males and females at the three

234

temperatures (23,698 – 11.2%; Figure 2). Differential gene expression between sexes at the

235

control temperature (12°C – 13,991 DEGs) was higher than at a temperature of 20°C (10,590)

236

and at 4°C (9,411; Figure 2). Differential expression between sexes was more similar between

237

4°C and 12°C than between 12°C and 20°C or 4°C and 20°C (Figure 3). Across temperatures, a

238

female-biased gene expression was observed, with more up-regulated DEGs in females

239

compared to males. Among DEGs up-regulated in females, 12% were up-regulated at the three

240

temperatures, 29% were uniquely up-regulated at 20°C, 28% at 12°C and 9% at 4°C. In turn,

241

among DEGs up-regulated in males, only 7% were consistent across temperatures, 29% were

242

specifically regulated at 4°C, 28% at 12°C and 29% at 20°C (Figure 3). Consistently, several GO

243

terms were significantly enriched in the comparison between gender and patterns shifted with

244

temperature (Figures 4 to 7). The lower temperature, 4 °C drove more metabolic reorganization

245

in males than females and the opposite held true at 12°C and 20°C for females. Taken together,

246

these results reveal a clear sex-biased gene expression that was modulated by temperature.

Putative sex marker genes

Analysis of the genes with the highest contribution to the Principal Component axis 1, measured

250

by its loading values (Legendre and Legendre, 2012), revealed genes potentially related to sex

females and another one highly expressed in males both match one gene coding for

253

homoaconitate hydratase that has been described as female-specific in Ectocarpus spp. and S.

254

japonica (Lipinska et al., 2017). Also, a gene identified in six other brown algal species as male-

255

specific, the high mobility group protein 1 (Lipinska et al., 2017), was also male-specific in our

256

data. Moreover, we identified two protein kinases: dual specificity protein kinase TTK and

257

serine/threonine-protein kinase OSR1 associated with male gene expression. Two other genes

258

functioning in protein modification, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 D2 and galactose-3-O-

259

sulfotransferase 3, were correlated with male samples. A gene coding for serine protease/ABC

260

transporter B family protein tagC and a gene coding for calcium channel YVC1 were associated

261

with females.

262
263

Functional annotation of sex-biased genes

264

To identify the functions of sex-biased genes, we performed a GO enrichment analysis in the set

265

of genes consistently up-regulated in females (2,072) and males (500) across temperatures

266

(Figure 4) and on the full set of genes differentially expressed between sexes at 4°C, 12°C and

267

20°C (Figures 5-7). Sex-biased genes identified in this study were associated with several

268

metabolic processes. Results of the GO enrichment analysis revealed that at 12°C and 4°C the

269

top 15 overrepresented GO terms were related to general metabolism, such as “peptide

270

biosynthetic process”, “organonitrogen compound biosynthetic process” and “translation” for

271

both females and males up-regulated DEGs (Supplementary Table S3). Terms related to

272

cytoskeleton and signalling, e.g. “cellular component assembly”, “actin filament organization”,

273

“small GTPase mediated signal transduction” were uniquely overrepresented in males while GO

274

terms related to aminoacid metabolism (“carboxylic acid metabolic process”) and nucleic acid

metabolism (“nucleoside triphosphate metabolic process”) were uniquely overrepresented in

276

females at both 4°C and 12°C. Considering the extensive list of enriched GO terms and that it

277

contained several human-related biological processes, we applied GO slim to provide an

278

overview. Among GO slim functional categories exclusively over-represented in females

279

consistently across temperatures, we identified GO terms related to metabolism and responses to

280

cues. In the category metabolism, the GO terms “protein metabolism” and “catabolism” were

281

over-represented, while response to cues included the GO terms “response to stress”, “response

282

to external stimulus” and “response to biotic stimulus” (Figure 4). Accordingly, we identified

283

considerably more stress response related DEGs up-regulated in females at the three different

284

temperatures, namely heat-shock and antioxidant proteins (Supplementary Table S4). In turn,

285

functional categories solely over-represented in males included “cell-cell signalling”, “cell

286

cycle” and “cell proliferation”. Moreover, some categories were over-represented in both males

287

and females and could be connected to processes that we expect to take place in both sexes

288

during gametophyte growth and development, namely “cell differentiation” and “cell

289

organization and biogenesis”.

290
291

Sex-biased gene expression at low and high temperatures

292

Shifts in the expressed metabolic pathways were observed in response to changes in temperature.

293

The low temperature tested, 4°C, drove more metabolic reorganization in males than in females

294

(Figure 5). “morphogenesis”, “reproduction”, “transport” and responses to endogenous, biotic

295

and abiotic stimulus gathered more enriched GO terms in males than in females at 4°C (Figure

296

5), and the reverse was observed at 12°C (Figure 6). However, biological processes such as lipid

297

and carbohydrate metabolism and “ion transport” were proportionally higher in females at 4°C

298

and at 12°C than males. Concomitantly, “cell differentiation”, cell and organelle organization

299

and biogenesis were consistently over-represented in males compared to females at both 4°C and

300

12°C.

301

At 20°C, we observed a decrease in the differentiation between sexes, revealed by the lower

302

number of enriched GO terms within the root biological processes differentially expressed

303

between males and females (Figure 7). Almost all the functional categories were over-

304

represented in females: “transport”, “signal transduction”, “response to stress”, “protein

305

metabolism”, “cell organization and biogenesis” and “cell communication” gathered the higher

306

number of GO terms. The top 15 over-represented GO terms in females included “superoxide

307

anion generation”, “positive regulation of oxidative stress-induced intrinsic apoptotic signalling

308

pathway”, “transposition”, “DNA integration” (Supplementary Table S3).

Discussion

311
312

Sex-biased gene expression underlies gender-specific metabolic needs

313

In this study, we identified a high number of genes differentially expressed between male and

314

female gametophytes which were in the vegetative stage. This pattern is consistent with

315

descriptions for Ectocarpus sp. by Lipinska et al. (2015) who reported that differential gene

316

expression between males and females was higher during the immature stage than during the

317

fertile one. Furthermore, more female- than male-biased genes were identified, which agrees

318

with results obtained during gametogenesis in S. latissima (GA Pearson et al. 2019, unpublished

319

data). However, this is in contrast to the situation in two other brown algae, Fucus vesiculosus

320

(order Fucales) (Martins et al., 2013), and Ectocarpus sp. (order Ectocarpales) (Lipinska et al.,

321

2015). Although there are contrasting patterns in sex-biased gene expression within brown algae,

322

the three species belong to different orders and even high variability in sex-biased gene

323

expression among species of the same genus has been described before (Metta et al., 2006).

324

Moreover, differences may mirror the different life cycles (Coelho et al., 2019). While

325

Laminariales and Ectocarpales have a haplo-diplontic life cycle, Fucales display a diplontic life

326

cycle. Moreover, the degree of sexual dimorphism in the haplo-phase (gametophytes) of

327

Laminariales is stronger than in the order Ectocarpales and while the first produce anisogamous

328

gametes with a large non-motile female egg cell and small motile male sperms, Ectocarpales

329

gametes are both motile and isogamous (Luthringer et al., 2014).

330

Functional analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed that several metabolic

331

pathways are distinctly regulated between female and male gametophytes. In females, several

332

GO terms related to general metabolism are enriched, such as “carbohydrate metabolism”, “lipid

333

metabolism”, “nucleobase, nucleoside, nucleotide and acid metabolism”. In addition, the over-

334

represented GO term “generation of precursor metabolites and energy” suggest that female

335

gametophyte cells are actively investing in cell growth and energy production. This is consistent

336

with observational microscopy studies, as female gametophyte cells tend to grow in size while

337

male gametophyte cells tend to grow in number (Destombe and Oppliger, 2011; Lüning, 1980;

338

Park et al., 2017). This investment in cell growth might be advantageous for later sporophyte

339

growth as larger female gametophyte cells will release bigger eggs that tend to generate larger

340

sporophytes (Bell, 1997). Within lipid metabolism, we identified four genes coding for

341

lipoxygenase that were sex-specific in S. latissima in this study (Supplementary Table S5) and

342

during gametogenesis (GA Pearson et al. 2019, unpublished data), as in Ectocarpus sp. (Lipinska

343

et al., 2015) although female-specific in the first and male-specific in the latter species.

344

Lipoxygenases are involved in lipid oxidation and play an important role in the biosynthesis of

345

oxylipins - lipophilic mediators that have several physiological functions such as senescence,

346

growth and development, tolerance to stress and cell homeostasis (Hou et al., 2015; Maynard et

347

al., 2018). In brown algae, they are involved in the defense response to pathogens and grazing

348

(Cosse et al., 2009; Ritter et al., 2017) and their synthesis was induced under copper stress

349

(Ritter et al., 2008). Considering the sex-biased gene expression of lipoxygenases in both

350

Ectocarpus sp. and S. latissima we hypothesize that they are involved in regulating sexual

351

differentiation in brown algae. Further work is required to understand the specific function of

352

lipoxygenases in sexual differentiation and its different expression between brown algae species.

353

In addition, two genes coding for mannuronan C5-epimerase were female-specific and one was

354

male-specific in S. latissima, while in Ectocarpus sp. two genes were male and one was female-

355

specific. Mannuronan C5-epimerases belong to large multigenic families that are involved in the

356

synthesis of alginate, a major component of cell walls in brown algae (Michel et al., 2010).

357

Previously, Fischl et al. (2016) reported four mannuronan C5-epimerases genes preferentially

358

expressed in Ectocarpales gametophytes over sporophytes, suggesting a role in the gametophyte

359

development. Differential expression of some of the genes enconding this enzyme might

360

contribute to the different morphologies of the male and female gametophytes’ cells.

361

A closer inspection of the functional annotation of DEGs revealed that some genes involved in

362

oxidative stress responses were up-regulated in female gametophytes of S. latissima. Similar

363

patterns were also reported for S. latissima during gametogenesis (GA Pearson et al. 2019,

364

unpublished data) and in the female gametophyte of Arabidopsis (Wuest et al., 2010). Reactive

365

oxygen species play a role in embryo sac development and fertilization in Arabidopsis (Martín et

366

al., 2013), cell division (Livanos et al., 2012a) and cytoskeleton homeostasis (Livanos et al.,

367

2012b) in plants. Thus, we hypothesize that reactive oxygen species might function as signaling

368

molecules regulating gametophyte development, as previously reported in gender-biased gene

369

expression in primates and mice (Blekhman et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2006), suggesting that these

370

are highly conserved processes.

371

In vegetative males, GO terms in the GO slim functional categories “cell communication” and

372

“cell-cell signaling” were over-represented which is probably connected to the fact that

373

gametophyte maturation is dependent on both environmental factors and biotic cues, namely the

374

release of pheromones (Lüning and Müller, 1978). Signal transduction might be crucial to allow

375

for temporal and spatial overlap in gametophyte maturation which is critical for successful

376

fertilization in kelps (Schiel and Foster, 2006). During our experiments no reproductive

377

structures were visible and males did not receive female cues for maturation as sexes were kept

378

separated. Nevertheless, our data suggests that male gametophytes prepare in advance for

379

maturation at the transcriptomic level probably to be able to readily synchronize gamete release

380

with females once cues are received. This might confer a competitive advantage and ensure

381

successful fertilization. Li et al. (2013) have observed that the best fertilization rates in S.

382

japonica occur 60-120 minutes after male gamete release and their viability is limited to 12

383

hours. This is further supported by the expression of a “flagellar associated” gene reported from

384

Ectocarpus which was only expressed in males of S. latissima at 4°C and 12°C. Two “flagellar

385

associated proteins” also displayed male-biased gene expression in immature gametophytes of

386

Ectocarpus (Lipinska et al., 2015).

387

Furthermore, higher enriched GO terms within the categories “cell”, “cytoskeleton” and

388

“organelle organization and biogenesis” are in accordance with cell division being enhanced in

389

male gametophyte filaments and these being more highly branched than female gametophyte

390

filaments. Among these functional categories, we found two genes encoding DNA helicases with

391

very high expression in males. DNA helicases are evolutionary conserved among eukaryotes and

392

involved in DNA replication, namely by positive regulation of telomere length, replication of

393

highly transcribed RNA polymerase II genes and unwinding Gquadruplex DNA structures

394

(Rhodes and Lipps, 2015; Sabouri, 2017). Therefore, higher expression of these genes in males

395

might be connected to higher cell division rates.

396
397

Changes in temperature modulated sex-biased gene expression

398

Functional analysis revealed that sex-biased gene expression shifted with temperature.

399

Differences between sexes were less pronounced at 20°C than at 4°C and 12°C suggesting that

400

the gametophytes alter their metabolism from developmental and sex differentiation processes to

401

a heat stress protection response that involves similar pathways in both sexes. This is in

402

agreement with 4°C and 12°C being more suitable temperatures for gametophyte growth and

403

gametogenesis than 20°C (Lüning, 1980).

404

It is widely accepted that temperature is a major factor controlling reproduction in seaweeds

405

(Andrews et al., 2014; Egan et al., 1989; Hurd et al., 2014a). This is further supported in our

406

study by the interactive effect of temperature and sex in gene expression patterns in S. latissima.

407

Only a small proportion of differentially expressed genes were consistent across temperatures

408

(12% for females and 7% for males) and females responded stronger to the higher temperature

409

(20°C) while more genes were overexpressed in males at lower temperatures (4°C). The effect of

410

temperature on growth of S. latissima gametophytes has been previously demonstrated: Lüning

411

(1980) observed optimum vegetative growth between 10 and 19°C and gametophyte death after

412

one week at 22°C. Another study revealed that gametophytes survived 22°C and even 23°C but

413

with visible cell damage (Bolton and Lüning, 1982). Hence, the higher temperature tested in the

414

present study (20°C) is very close to the upper survival temperature in gametophytes and to the

415

maximum temperature reached during summer at the original collection site of the gametophytes

416

(Helgoland, North Sea, (Breitbach et al., 2016)). Other studies have suggested that male kelp

417

gametophytes are slightly more thermotolerant than females (Lee and Brinkhuis, 1988; tom

418

Dieck, 1993). This is supported by the differential gene expression of our study. The male

419

gametophytes seem to be more resilient to the heat stress as functional categories such as

420

“response to stress”, response to external and abiotic stimuli and “cell death” were over-

421

represented in females and categories such as “cell cycle” were over-represented in males. In

422

addition, induction of transposable elements by stress and their effects on gene regulation has

423

been observed in plants, namely in response to heat stress (Dubin et al., 2018; Makarevitch et al.,

424

2015). The over-representation of GO terms related to transposition in females at 20°C suggests

425

a role in heat stress response in S. latissima gametophytes. Concomitantly, other enriched GO

426

terms connected to stress response, such as “superoxide anion generation”, “positive regulation

427

of oxidative stress-induced intrinsic apoptotic signalling pathway” were also among the top 15

428

over-represented GO terms in females at 20°C. This further supports the higher sensitivity to

429

heat stress of female gametophytes. Assessing differential sensitivity to high temperatures

430

between sexes in gametophytes is relevant for hybridization protocols aiming to produce more

431

tolerant cultivars in aquaculture, as it is already current practice in crop plant species (Zinn et al.,

432

2010). Recently, Martins et al. (2019) demonstrated that for the kelps Laminaria digitata and L.

433

pallida female parent gametophytes contributed more for the thermal response of the hybrids

434

than males. Our work suggests that the same might be true for S. latissima and informs current

435

ongoing efforts to maximize sugar kelp cultivation practices.

436

Shifts in sex ratio in response to sub-optimal temperatures have already been described in several

437

kelp species (Izquierdo et al., 2002; Nelson, 2005; Oppliger et al., 2011). In S. latissima, Lee and

438

Brinkhuis (1988) described a greater proportion of male compared to female gametophytes at
15

439

higher temperatures (between 17°C and 20°C). Female gametophyte grew at 20°C, but with a

440

lower rate than between 4 and 17°C and their fecundity was repressed. Pronounced temperature-

441

mediated sex ratio shifts might lead to population declines in several species, especially at sites

442

where species are close to their upper thermal tolerance limit, and may have an impact on the

443

range distribution of species (Hays Graeme et al., 2017; Janzen, 1994; Ospina-Alvarez and

444

Piferrer, 2008). Differences in the sex ratio between populations along the distributional range

445

have been observed for several plants (Barrett and Hough, 2012) and for the kelp Lessonia

446

nigrescens (Oppliger et al., 2011), which warrants concern that skewed sex ratios due to global

447

warming might compromise populations viability. At the gametophyte stage, global warming

448

may lead to a mismatch between male and female gametophyte performance that might

449

compromise sexual maturation and fertilization, as has been recently highlighted by de

450

Bettignies et al. (2018). At the same time, the high levels of gene expression reported here

451

indicate that vegetative gametophytes are still metabolically active rather than “dormant” as in

452

plant seeds (Schiel and Foster, 2006) and therefore more vulnerable to abiotic stress. Therefore,

453

the sex differences in gene expression patterns in response to temperature described here for S.

454

latissima prompts for further investigation on the vulnerability of the gametophyte life-stage to

455

temperature and its potential effects in reproductive success and phenology.
