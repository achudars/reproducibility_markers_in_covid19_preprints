ABSTRACT

2

Tuberculosis, one of the oldest recorded human afflictions, is still one of the biggest killers

3

among the infectious diseases, despite the worldwide use of a live attenuated vaccine and

4

several antibiotics. This study was designed to assess the resistance rate distribution of MDR-

5

TB among pulmonary tuberculosis patients attending Nnamdi Azikiewe University Teaching

6

Hospital (NAUTH) Nnewi and St Patrick’s Hospital Mile 4 Abakaliki in the Southeast

7

Nigeria. Patients with persistent cough for over two weeks were screened by Ziehl-Neelsen

8

(ZN) technique for the presence of acid fast bacilli (AFB) in their sputum and a total of 103

9

patients with AFB positive sputum samples were recruited. The positive sputum samples

10

were subjected to Xpert MTB/RIF assay (GeneXpert®, Cepheid USA) and culture on

11

Lowestein Jensen medium for 42days at 370C. Drug susceptibility testing was done on the

12

isolates using the nitrate reduction assay (NRA). Xpert MTB/RIF assay detected MTB in

13

83(80.6%) samples out of which 45(67.2%) were rifampicin resistant. Sixty-seven (80.7%) of

14

the isolates were resistant to at least one of the first-line drugs. Primary resistance was 91%

15

while 19.4%, 35.8%, 22.4% and 22.4% of the isolates were resistant to one, two, three and

16

four drugs respectively. Isoniazid had the highest rate of resistance (57.8%) while Ethambutol

17

had the least (34.9%) and 30(44.8%) of the resistant isolates were MDR. Smoking (P=.002),

18

gender (P=.002) and history of TB treatment (P=.012) were significantly associated with drug

19

resistance. Educational status was significantly associated with MDR-TB (P=.020). NAUTH

20

and St Patrick’s hospital had MDR-TB rates of 38.9% and 46.9% respectively. The findings

21

of this study indicate high prevalence of MDR-TB among patients with pulmonary TB in the

22

study sites and this portrays a menace to adequate TB control. Prompt diagnosis of TB,

23

adequate patient compliance to therapy and increased awareness and mass education is

24

recommended

INTRODUCTION

28

The discovery of anti-tuberculosis drugs in the 1940s followed by combination chemotherapy

29

made tuberculosis a curable disease. In the developed countries, effective treatment and

30

surveillance reduced tuberculosis dramatically with high hopes of total eradication [1, 2].

31

However, in the 1980s, it was realized that tuberculosis had not only ceased to decline in the

32

developed countries, notably the USA, but was actually increasing, particularly in major

33

cities [2]. It was also soon realized that the disease was out of control and increasing at an

34

alarming rate across most of the poorest regions of the world especially Africa due to

35

HIV/AIDS [1, 3]. Despite aggressive international efforts, tuberculosis remains a leading

36

infectious cause of death, with an estimated 8.6 million incident cases per year. In 2012, an

37

estimated 1.3 million people died from the disease. These death rates, however, only partially

38

depict the global TB threat; more than 80% of TB patients are in the economically productive

39

age of 15 to 49 years [4].

40
41

Interestingly, global tuberculosis control efforts have been threatened by the emergence of

42

multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). It is the strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis

43

which show high level resistance to both isoniazid and rifampicin, with or without resistance

44

to other anti TB drugs [4]. Alarmingly, MDR-TB is estimated to cause 4% of new

45

tuberculosis cases in the developing world. Patients infected with MDR strains are not only

46

difficult to cure but also more likely to remain sources of infection for a longer period of time

47

than those with drug susceptible organisms. MDR-TB requires longer duration of treatment

48

(up to 2 years) to achieve cure, in comparison with 6 month treatment for drug susceptible

49

TB, lower cure rates and even higher default rates, not minding the expensive cost of

50

treatment [5].

51
52

Remarkably, due to the increasing prevalence, MDR-TB is now subdivided into basic MDR-

53

TB, with resistance only to rifampicin and isoniazid, and extensive drug resistant TB (XDR-

54

TB), with a similar resistance pattern but with resistance to one or more additional first and/or

55

second line drugs. Various perturbations in the individual drug target genes are responsible

56

for the genesis of anti-TB drugs resistance. Rifampicin resistance has been shown to be

57

caused by a change in the β-subunit of DNA dependent RNA polymerase, which is encoded

58

by the rpoβ gene and more than 95% of rifampicin resistant strains are associated with

59

mutations within an 81-base pair region of the rpoβ gene, which is termed rifampicin

60

resistance determinant region [6, 7, 8]. On the contrary, resistance to isoniazid is due to

61

mutations at one of two main sites, in either the katG or inhA genes [9, 10]. It is also noted

62

that these mutations are not directly connected, and so separate mutations are required for

63

organisms to change from a drug susceptible isolate to MDR-TB. Furthermore, rifampicin

64

resistance has been considered to be a surrogate marker for checking multidrug resistance in

65

clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis since rifampicin resistance is often accompanied by

66

resistance to isoniazid [7, 8]. Drug resistance in M. tuberculosis occurs by random, single

67

step, spontaneous mutation at a low but predictable frequency, in large bacterial populations.

68

The accurate diagnosis of MDR-TB requires a positive culture of M. tuberculosis and drug

69

susceptibility testing. The use of genotypic analysis of rpoβ for Rif resistance in evaluating

70

the public health threat of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is controversial due to the fact that

71

misdiagnosing of patients as MDR-TB when they are only Rif mono-resistant would lead to

72

inappropriate second line treatment in a world of limited second line armamentarium [11].

74

Due to the burden in diagnosing MDR-TB in pulmonary tuberculosis patients resulting from

75

poor facilities in Nigeria, this study therefore assessed the resistance rate distribution of

76

MDR-TB among pulmonary tuberculosis patients attending Nnamdi Azikiewe University

77

Teaching Hospital Nnewi and St Patrick’s Hospital Mile 4 Abakaliki in the Southeast

Nigeria.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

81

Study Area

82

This study was conducted at Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital (NAUTH),

83

Nnewi and St Patrick’s Hospital, Mile 4 Abakaliki. Nnewi is the second largest city in

84

Anambra State and is home to nearly 388,805 residents. Abakaliki is the capital of Ebonyi

85

state and has a population of 149,683 persons [12]. NAUTH is a tertiary health institution and

86

serves as a site for treatment and management of both TB and HIV patients. It is also a

87

referral centre for both cases. St Patrick’s Hospital, Mile 4 Abakaliki is a faith-based health

88

facility and offers both antiretroviral therapy and TB care to patients.

89

Sample Size

90

Minimum sample size was calculated using the formula stated by [13] and a total of 103

91

sputum smear positive AFB samples were collected for the study.

92

Ethical Approval

93

Ethical approval for this study was obtained from NAUTH research and ethics committee.

94

Consent was obtained from each participant and participants’ confidentiality was maintained

95

throughout the study. Participants received no financial motivation for their involvement in

the study. Participants were free to withdraw from the study at any point and their withdrawal

97

would not affect their treatment. This study was conducted between January 2015 and

98

September 2016

99

Sample collection and analysis

100

About 2mls of venous blood sample from smear positive AFB participants’ was collected in

101

plain tube, allowed to clot and the serum separated and screened for presence of HIV-1/2

102

antibodies using serial algorithm method. Determine®, Unigold® and Stat-pak® HIV test

103

kits were used according to manufacturer’s instruction (Determine® is manufactured by Alere

104

Medical Co., Ltd Japan while Unigold® and StatPak® are manufactured by Trinity Biotech

105

PLC, Ireland and CHEMBIO Diagnostic Systems Inc New York, USA respectively) [14].

106

Consenting, eligible participants were screened for presence of AFB in their sputum. Two

107

sputum samples (spot and early morning) were collected in sterile screw-cap universal

108

containers from each participant on 2 consecutive days and stained by Ziehl-Neelsen’s

109

method.

110

Progressively, early morning mucoid or mucopurulent sputum specimen was collected from

111

each participant with smear positive AFB test result into a sterile screw-cap universal bottle.

112

The specimen was then stored in the refrigerator until transported to the TB reference

113

laboratory of Dr Lawrence Henshaw Memorial Hospital (DLHMH) in Calabar, Cross River

114

State. Transport was done within 72hrs of collection.

115

After appropriate sample preparation, two Lowestein Jensen (LJ) medium slants were

116

cultured for each sample. Tubes were loosely capped and incubated as such at 37oC for one

117

week in a slanted position to ensure even distribution and absorption of inoculum. After 1

118

week, tubes were incubated upright for up to 6 weeks and the caps tightened. An in-house

119

strain H37RV and an uninoculated tube were used as positive and negative control

120

respectively as previously reported by [15].

121

After Colonies was confirmed by Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining for acid-fastness, niacin test

122

was carried out on each inoculated and control tubes. The formation of a yellow colour was

123

interpreted as positive reaction; absence of colour was regarded as negative reaction for

124

production of Niacin. Catalase test, p-Nitrobenzoic Acid (PNB) and TB Ag MPT64 Rapid

125

Test was carried out in this study and M. tuberculosis identification was based on its slow

126

growth rate, no pigmentation, no growth on Lowestein Jensen (LJ) medium containing p-

127

nitrobenzoic acid, niacin production, catalase negative at 68oC and positive Ag MPT 64 test.

128

Drug susceptibility testing (DST) was carried out on all confirmed M. tuberculosis colonies

129

and nitrate reduction assay (NRA) method was used [16].

130

GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay for detection of Rifampicin Resistance was carried out on the

131

sputum samples of the participants. Sputum sediments were mixed with sample buffer in a

132

ratio of 1:3 in a screw cap tube and screwed tightly. The tube was vortexed for 20 seconds.

133

Sample was incubated at room temperature for 10mins. After 10mins the sample was

134

vortexed again for 20 seconds and incubated at room temperature for 5mins. After

135

incubation, 2ml of sample was inoculated into the genexpert cartridge. Cartridge was scanned

136

into the GeneXpert machine (Cepheid USA) and allowed to run for 2hrs. After 2hrs the test

137

result was read off the screen of the GeneXpert machine monitor.

138

Data Analysis

139

Data was statistically analyzed using statistical package for social sciences SSPS for windows

140

version 20.0 software. A standard questionnaire was completed for each recruited patient to

141

collect demographic parameters. Frequencies were calculated as percentages. Comparison of

RESULTS

146

Out of the 103 AFB positive sputum samples collected 83(80.6%) showed culture positive

147

isolates. Sixty-one (61) of the isolates were from St Patrick’s Hospital, Mile 4 Abakaliki

148

while 30 were from NAUTH giving a TB prevalence rate of 73.50% and 26.50%

149

respectively. Fig 2 showed 80.70% resistance rate of the isolates. NAUTH had resistance rate

150

of 81.80% compared with 80.70% from Mile 4 Abakaliki.

In table 3, isolates of M. tuberculosis exhibited fourteen resistance patterns to the first-line

250

anti-TB drugs with the combination of Streptomycin, Isoniazid, Rifampicin and Ethambutol

251

showing the highest resistance rate (22.4%). However based on site, table 4 showed that

252

isolates from NAUTH exhibited eleven (11) distinct resistance patterns while isolates from

253

Mile 4 Hospital, table 5, exhibited fourteen (14) patterns. Table 6, showed resistance pattern

254

of isolates with respect to treatment history, treatment Naïve (primary treatment) exhibited

255

higher resistance pattern when compared with retreatment. Fig 7 showed high Prevalence of

256

MDR-TB (37.50%) with respect to treatment history than retreatment (36.00%).

DISCUSSION

294

Tuberculosis remains the major global health problem which ranked the 9th leading cause of

295

death worldwide and currently, the emergency of MDR-TB is also the main public health

296

problem in both developing and developed countries [17]. Drug resistance in M. tuberculosis

297

isolates arises from spontaneous genetic mutations and can be enhanced by poor adherence of

298

patients to anti-TB drugs [18]. Moreover, infection depends both on the bacterial virulence

299

and the inherent microbicidal ability of the alveolar macrophage that ingests it. If the bacillus

300

is able to survive initial defences, it can multiply within the alveolar macrophage [19].

301

Interestingly, out of a total of 103 acid fast bacilli AFB positive samples in this study 83

302

(80.6%) yielded Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates on culture, 12(11.7%) were negative

303

for M. tuberculosis, while 8(7.8%) were contaminated. Sixty-one (61) of the isolates were

304

from St Patrick’s Hospital, Mile 4 Abakaliki while 30 were from NAUTH giving a TB

305

prevalence rate of 73.50% and 26.50% respectively. The high culture positivity rate in this

306

study agrees with [20] that reported 65.7% culture positivity rate in South-West Nigeria. Also

307

[21] reported that 100 out of 120 sputum samples were positive for M. tuberculosis on culture

308

in a study in Calabar. In the contrary, this rate is higher than the 33% culture positivity rate

309

reported by [15] in a study at Nnewi. Also [22] reported a lower rate of 44% in India.

310

Report has it that drug resistance is mainly due to irregular or improper anti-TB drug use and

311

absence of good, effective national TB control programme which have led to accumulation

312

and multiplication of resistance strains [23, 22]. The high resistance rate of isolates in this

313

study is similarly high in consonance with [24]. They reported that 81.2% of their isolates

314

showed resistance to at least one drug in Georgia. [20] Reported a resistance rate of 62.5% in

315

South-West Nigeria. Also [22] reported 69.7% resistance rate in a study conducted in India.

316

The resistance rate obtained in this study however is higher than the 31% resistance rate

317

reported by [25] in a study at Abuja and this could be due to geographical variations in drug

318

resistance rates. Drug resistance rate obtained from NAUTH (81.80%) is higher than that

319

reported by [15] that showed 46.1% resistance rate to at least one drug in a study conducted

320

in Nnewi. This indicates an increasing trend in drug resistance which could be as a result of

321

selective compliance to treatment and default among clients [23, 26]. However, since

322

previous rate of drug resistance at St Patrick’s Hospital could not be assessed, a comparison

323

could not be made.

324

Among the socio-demographic factors assessed in this study, female gender was significantly

325

associated with drug resistance. The resistance rate for the females was higher than that for

326

the males. This agrees with a study conducted in Georgia which revealed that women were

327

more at risk of drug resistance compared to men [27, 24]. The role of women as care givers

328

predispose them to developing drug resistance as they have longer contact at home with sick

329

relatives. Also because of cultural restrictions, women are educationally disadvantaged.

330

Women due to ignorance may not fully understand the importance of adherence to therapy. In

331

a study to access factors contributing to treatment adherence in Zambia, (39.1%) of the

332

females compared with (33.9%) of the males stopped taking their medication after 2 months.

333

Most of the male TB patients were older and more educated than the female TB patients [28].

334

Gender as a significant demographic factor for drug resistance in this study agrees with the

335

report of [23].

336

The significant association of smoking with drug resistance in this study has been

337

collaborated in other studies. According to [29] smoking among other life style habits has

338

been associated with development of drug resistance. This agrees with [30] who reported that

339

poor treatment outcomes were higher in smokers in a study in Georgia. [31] Described an

340

association between drug resistance and smoking or tobacco use in some cases of drug

341

resistant TB. It was explained that cigarette smoke contains mutagenic chemicals; and

342

smoking and environmental pollutants could also alter the redox balance, in turn affecting the

343

mutation rate. Significant association of a history of TB treatment in this study with drug

344

resistance agrees with several published articles. [15] Reported that previous TB treatment

345

was a risk factor for MDR-TB and [20] in a study in South-west Nigeria reported that the

346

most significant factor associated with drug resistance was a history of previous anti-TB

347

treatment. Also, [21] reported that previous TB treatment was significant for drug resistance.

348

[22] In a study in Karnataka region, India, showed that past history of pulmonary TB was

349

statistically associated with development of drug resistance. [32] Reported also that previous

350

history of TB treatment among other risk factors was independently associated with high risk

351

of resistance to any first-line anti-TB drug. Delayed recognition of drug resistance,

352

inappropriate chemotherapy regimens, inadequate or irregular drug supply, poor compliance

353

by patients, malabsorbtion of one or more drugs, and sequestered disease (in which

354

differential penetration of anti TB drugs may lead to mono-therapy), have been reported as

355

reasons for development of drug resistance in previously treated patients [26].

356

Primary drug resistance in this study was high and this is in conformity with [33] who

357

reported resistance rate of (84.6%) in a study in Tanzania. Also [15] reported that a higher

358

proportion of drug resistance was seen among new TB cases than among previously treated

359

cases. [24] Also showed a primary drug resistance rate of (67.12%) in Georgia. However [34,

360

22, 32], reported lower rates of 10.3%, 9.1% and 15.3% respectively in individual studies

361

done in Uganda, India and Ethiopia respectively. Primary drug resistance occurs when drug

362

resistant bacilli are transmitted to other people [21]. The high rate of primary drug resistance

363

in this study indicates the high proportion of the population harbouring resistant strains.

364

Studies have shown that transmission of drug resistant strains (i.e. primary drug resistance)

365

rather than amplification from susceptible strains (acquisition of resistance conferring

366

mutations i.e. acquired resistance) is the dominant source of MDR-TB [35]. In addition, most

367

of the first line anti-TB drugs are available without prescription (over the counter), and there

368

are no effective control of the availability of these drugs outside the National TB control

369

programme, some of these patients may have been treated with some of these first line anti-

370

TB drugs unknowingly. Hence they are not frank cases of primary drug resistance.

371

Isolates in this study exhibited the highest resistance rate to Isoniazid, and the least to

372

Ethambutol. [36] In a review of first-line anti-tuberculosis drug resistance reported that

373

Isoniazid had the highest resistance in Iran, in over 16-year while Ethambulol had the least.

374

[15] Showed that Isoniazid mono-resistance was highest among the first line anti-TB drugs

375

and similar pattern of drug resistance was also observed by [32]. Isoniazid is one of the main

376

drugs for TB treatment and over the years increasing levels of resistance to Isoniazid might

377

be due to incomplete treatment [37, 36]. The increased prevalence of strains with primary

378

resistance to Isoniazid is a very important indication to estimate the risk of development of

379

MDR TB [26]. In the same vein, a high proportion of isolates in this study exhibited

380

resistance to Rifampicin. Apprehensively, resistance to Rifampicn is the most pressing

381

concern in the TB management because it necessitates very long, expensive and relatively

382

toxic drug schedules and leads to poorer outcomes [35]. It has been shown that patients

383

infected with strains resistant to Rifampicin will experience a higher failure rate with short

384

course of 6 months chemotherapy [36]. Resistant isolates in this study exhibited distinct

385

patterns of drug resistance. Varying patterns of drug resistance was shown by these isolates

386

with respect to site and treatment history. In treatment of MDR-TB, the number of drugs in

387

the regimen depends on the susceptibility pattern, availability of first line agents and extent of

388

disease [38]. The pattern of drug resistance varies from place to place at different periods of

389

time therefore, knowledge of geographic variations is essential for monitoring of antibiotic

390

resistance within a defined population of patients infected with M. tuberculosis [36].

391

From this study, it can be concluded that there is high prevalence of resistance to first line

392

anti-TB drugs, with female gender, smoking and previous TB treatment being significantly

393

associated with development of drug resistance. It was also observed that there is ongoing

394

community transmission of drug resistance as shown by the high proportion of new cases

395

showing drug resistance and that prevalence of MDR-TB is higher than that documented

396

previously. Worthy of note is that primary transmission of MDR-TB is on the increase,

397

therefore, there is need for more pro-active measures to tackle this public health menace.
