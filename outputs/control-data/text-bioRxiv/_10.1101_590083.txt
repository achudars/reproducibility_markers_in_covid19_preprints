Abstract

19

An outbreak of human rabies transmitted by hematophagous bats occurred in 2018 in the

20

state of Pará, Brazil, eastern Amazon, after 14 years with no record of the disease. It is

21

necessary to understand the epidemiological characteristics of these attacks to protect the

22

local population. This study aimed to characterize attacks of humans by vampire bats in

23

the municipality of São João da Ponta, Pará state, Brazil, from 2013 to 2015. All

24

individuals attacked by bats who sought medical care during the study period (n=5) were

25

identified in the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN) database and answered

26

a questionnaire about the circumstances of the attack. Using snowball sampling, seed

27

cases identified other individuals who were attacked in the same period but did not seek

28

medical care (n=61), totalizing 66 people attacked in the same period. The interviewees

29

were male (92.4%), adults between 20 and 50 years old (69.6%) and had completed

30

elementary education (86.3%). Most were rural residents (92.4%) and crab fishermen

31

(79.3%). The interviewees (92.4%) identified the mangrove of the Mãe Grande de Curuçá

32

extractive reserve as an area conducive to attacks by vampire bats, where groups of

33

fishermen sometimes concentrate for days for crab fishing, often living in improvised

34

dwellings without walls and covered by tarps or straw (88.8%). The wounds were single

35

bites (71.2%) and were located on the lower limbs (93.9%). Overall, 42.4% of participants

36

had been bitten more than four times throughout their life (range 1-23 attacks).

37

Participants were unaware of the risk of contracting rabies by the bite (95.4%). Using São

38

João da Ponta as a model, this study shows that bat attacks are an essentially occupational

39

problem in the study region. Indeed, for each reported attack, there are 12.2 unreported

40

cases. It is necessary to develop strategies to reach this population for prophylactic

41

treatment.

Author Summary

44
45

Different from which occurs worldwide in relation to rabies transmission, in Amazon

46

region, vampire bat is involved on direct transmission of rabies virus to humans when

47

searching for bloodmeal. It is common in the state of Pará, Eastern Amazon, large areas

48

inhabited near forests and mangroves. People living there use forest natural resources as

49

a way of income and sustenance and these working conditions is what our study points

50

out as an important factor for aggressions predisposition. Here this subject is shown as an

51

occupational problem. This study also quantified for the first time underreported human’s

52

aggressions by bats in Amazon, using the snowball sampling, which valued the

53

relationship between individuals to reach the target population. Based on these results,

Introduction

77

In general, the causal factors of rabies are manifold. The epidemiological cycle of

78

the viral agent is complex and involves several mammalian hosts. Many researchers

79

consider contact with the wild reservoir, human population mobility, and the social and

80

cultural characteristics of a population as the main determinants for onset of the disease.

81

The high impact of rabies transmission by vampire bats in the Amazon region is

82

unquestionable 1-3.

83

Climate, seasonality, proximity to the forest, and the presence of livestock and

84

natural prey provide conditions conducive to the proliferation of vampire bats in the

85

Amazon. However, this in itself does not determine the occurrence of bites and

86

transmission of rabies in humans. It is the relationships between humans and the

87

environment that place human populations at epidemiological risk, which is also

88

associated with the lack of medical care, poverty and low level education 4,5.

89

This relationship between humans and the environment is reflected in the use of

90

the mangroves’ natural resources by the families in that region. The municipality of São

91

João da Ponta, Pará state (PA), is located in an Extractive Reserve (São João da Ponta

92

RESEX) in the Eastern Amazon and is surrounded by other conservation units. The main

93

economic activity of the municipality is swamp ghost crab (Ucides cordatus) fishing 6.

94

Informal conversations with the population indicated that many residents in the

95

municipality had been attacked by bats but did not seek medical care.

96

According to the guidelines of the Health Surveillance Department of the Ministry

97

of Health (SVS/MS), bat bites are subject to mandatory notification throughout Brazil.

98

Every case of a bite or attack involving bats must be notified to health authorities using

99

the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN) and completing the human anti-

100

rabies treatment notification form [7]. This form collects identification data of the

101

notifying unit and agent, patient identification, characteristics of the injury, characteristics

102

of the animal responsible for the attack (in cases involving dogs or cats), place of

103

residence and treatment regimen. This form must be completed at each visit and sent to

104

the appropriate department for processing. Although this form has a lot of information to

105

aid in rabies surveillance, it does not provide a record of the circumstances of the attack,

106

which is a key for the surveillance of cases in which the attacking animal is a vampire

107

bat.

126

municipality under study is located, Maracanã RESEX, Mocapajuba RESEX in São

127

Caetano de Odivelas, Mestre Lucindo RESEX in Marapanim, and Mãe Grande de Curuçá

128

RESEX. The latter covers practically the entire territory of the municipality of Curuçá-

129

PA. The climate is hot and humid, with a rainy season (from January to June) and a dry

130

season (from July to December) [8][9]. The vegetation is composed of moderately

131

preserved mangrove forest with species such as Rhizophora mangle, Avicennia

132

germinans and Laguncularia racemosa [10](Figure 1).

134

Data collection and analysis

135

Information of individuals attacked by bats in São João da Ponta municipality

136

between 2013 and 2015 were from Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN).

137

This period was selected to prevent the interviewee from having difficulty remembering

138

the episode and answering the questions.

139

These individuals were visited in their homes, and during these visits, the study

140

objectives were explained, and the informed consent form was signed. Subsequently, a

141

semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data on the circumstances of the attack,

142

such as location and time of the attack, type of attack, time elapsed between attack and

143

anti-rabies treatment, frequency of attack, professional occupation of the attacked

144

individuals and structure of the household or shelter where the attack occurred.

145

A non-probabilistic snowball sampling technique was used to obtain information

146

on individuals who were attacked by bats during the same period but did not seek medical

147

care. The seeds were the cases reported in SINAN during the study period [11].

148

Individuals reached by this method were also interviewed and all locations indicated by

149

the interviewees as the area of the attack were georeferenced.

150

The descriptive statistical analysis of the data was performed using SPSS v. 20. A

151

geographic database was created with the coordinates of the locations of the attacks.

152

Using the cartographic databases of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics

153

(IBGE), the spatial distribution of cases was analyzed in ArcGIS™ 10.1. The

154

relationships between the individuals reached by snowball sampling was visualized using

155

R.

156
157

Results

158

Between 2013 and 2015, five residents of the São João da Ponta municipality

159

sought anti-rabies treatment after being attacked by vampire bats and therefore were

160

registered in SINAN. These individuals identified another 141 individuals who were

161

attacked by bats in the same period. Of those, 61 were interviewed and the others 80

162

individuals were disregarded in the analysis because they no longer lived in the

163

community or were bitten for more than three years or refused to answer the questions

164

and we could not confirm the aggression. Therefore, for each individual who sought care,

165

there were at list 12.2 cases that were not reported. The communication network between

166

these individuals is illustrated in Figure 2. We can observe that there are individuals who

167

have more indications. They are individuals better known in the community. In contrast,

168

there are few individuals who know more individuals who have been attacked by bats. To

169

these, besides being more connected with the others in the network, they have high

170

"PageRank" (centrality measures that reflects how much is indicated by the others of the

171

network and those that indicate also have greater popularity). So, we can admit that people

172

have neighbors that have more indications than them, corroborated by the article of Feld

173

(1991) [12. One of these more connected individuals was a Community Health Agent, a

174

professional that visit households daily as a municipality action of preventive medicine.

175

Among the victims, 10 (15.1%) reported that the attacks occurred in their homes

176

or in areas near the São João da Ponta Extractive Reserve, whereas the majority (84.9%)

177

were attacked in the mangrove areas of the Mãe Grande de Curuçá Extractive Reserve in

178

Curuçá municipality, a neighboring city (Figure 3).

179

Nineteen sites were identified as locations of attacks: 14 in the Curuçá RESEX,

180

four in the São João da Ponta RESEX and one in the Marapanim RESEX. The Cuimiri

181

and Pacamorema beaches which are both located in Curuçá, accounted for the highest

182

proportions of bites, 22.7% and 10.6% respectively. Figure 4 shows the route traveled by

183

the crab fishermen between the locations of the attack and their city of origin, where they

184

would seek anti-rabies treatment.

185

The attacked individuals were mostly male (92.4%) and adult (69.6%) and had

186

less than 4 years formal school education (54.4%). Most lived in the rural area of the city

187

(92.4%) and were crab fishermen (79.3%) (Table 1).

The interviewees reported that during crab fishing, they gather for days in

193

makeshift dwellings without walls and covered by tarp or straw (88.8%) (Figure 4). In

194

most cases, these shacks were set up in drier areas within the mangrove (30.3%) or on

195

beaches (56.1%), less than five kilometers from the forest (73.3%) and freshwater bodies

196

(45.4%). In addition, many fishermen reported that bats sheltered in a tree typical of the

197

mangrove area, commonly known as black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) (80.3%).

198

Most of the interviewees reported the presence of domestic animals like dogs (56.5%),

199

domestic birds (23.9%) and bovine (10.9%) where attacks occurred. Wild animals were

200

also observed (75.8%), with raccoon (Procyon cancrivorus) (26.1%), scarlet ibis

201

(Eudocimus ruber), great egret (Ardea alba) (23.5%) and monkey (19.1%) being the most

202

commonly reported species. Some interviewees had found lesions suggestive of bat

203

attacks on dogs (42.9%) and domestic birds (10.6%).

204

On the nights that the attacks occurred, most of the individuals (63.6%) were in a

205

group with more than five fishermen in the same shack (ranging from 2 to 12 people),

206

and 33.3% reported that others were also attacked the same night. The shelters typically

207

had a light source (87.9%) such as a lantern, a bonfire or an oil lamp that was usually

208

extinguished by strong beach winds throughout the night.

209

When questioned about the frequency of attacks, most reported having been

210

attacked more than four times. The number of attacks by bats during the life ranged from

211

1 to 18. In most cases (34.8%), the most recent episodes had occurred between 2 and 6

212

months prior to the interview, more frequently in the drier season (54.4%). In general, the

213

injuries were single bites (71.2%) and were located on the lower limbs (80.8%). Among

214

those who sought care (i.e., the seeds, 13.6%), all completed the prophylactic regimen

215

with 5 doses of vaccine and serum.

216

Questions addressing respondents’ perceptions regarding the risks associated with

217

bat bites and their consequences revealed that most individuals did not use any type of

218

personal protection equipment against bat attacks (63.6%). Those who claimed to use

219

some type of protection used mosquito netting, “sapato de mangue” (resistant fabric

220

wrapped around their feet), bonfires, or fishing nets around the shack as a physical barrier.

221

Most (80.3%) were unaware of the risk of rabies transmission through a bat bite or even

222

unaware of rabies (94.5%). Of those attacked who did not seek medical care, 66.7%

223

reported "not caring about what happened", 13.6% did not know how to respond, and

224

7.6% mentioned the distance from the healthcare unit.

Discussion

227

This is the first study to quantify the underreporting of bat attacks in humans in

228

the Amazon using the snowball sampling method, which capitalized on relationships

229

between individuals to reach the target population. Network analysis was useful in

230

identifying the people most commonly mentioned by the community in relation to bat

231

attacks, and it can be applied to identify key individuals who can be the focus of more

232

intense health surveillance activities. People identified by the network can be great allies

233

in implementing interventions to change habits and attitudes that may hinder prevention.

234

Indeed, it can be useful to optimize Communities Health Agents job, when bitten people

235

active search is necessary.

236

Human behavior, in particular the lack of knowledge in this study population

237

regarding the predictable consequences of vampire bat bites hinders the use of SINAN

238

quantitative reports as a reliable data source to establish public health policies for rabies

239

transmission in these areas. This is because the number of people attacked by bats in this

240

region is much higher than that recorded in the system. Moreover, the reports do not

241

include the locations of attacks or the bat species involved. Although this characterization

242

was carried in municipality of Pará state, São João da Ponta, we believe that it is reflective

243

of the situation in other municipalities of the Salgado microrregion, which have similar

244

geographic and cultural characteristics.

245

Strategies for rabies prevention in vulnerable populations in Amazon regions have

246

been previously reviewed in the literature [1,3,4. In fact, it has already been proposed

247

that the SINAN form be changed to include fields related to dog and cat behavior to

248

support animal rabies surveillance and prophylactic measures [13]. Although these

249

changes have not yet been incorporated, this study demonstrates the need to adapt the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/590083; this version posted March 26, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

250

form to include bat attacks, given that animal attacks relevant to rabies transmission in

251

the Salgado microregion and the whole Amazon typically involve different species than

252

in other regions [14]. The fact that these people are generally not bitten in their homes

253

but, rather, in other circumstances demonstrates that the inclusion in the SINAN form of

254

a field to report the location of attacks is necessary to better prevent vampire bat bites.

255

This study also shows for the first time that living conditions in the mangrove are

256

important factors in bat attacks in the Amazon. Respondents reported that in these areas,

257

attacks by bats have been occurring for a long time and have never resulted in death. In

258

fact, there are no reports of human deaths from the rabies virus in the study region, and

259

there were no reported cases of neurological syndromes in livestocks between 2004 and

260

2013 [23]. However, there are no studies on the circulation of rabies virus in this micro-

261

region and the possibility of inexistent or inadequate communication between healthcare

262

and agricultural services cannot be ruled out [16]. Therefore, based on the evidence of

263

human attacks reported here and the underreporting of bites, the study region cannot be

264

considered as an area of controlled rabies transmission. When in doubt about whether the

265

virus is circulating, it would be prudent to define a policy of immunization and health

266

education for this population, given the history of rabies in Pará and the prevalent risk

267

factors for rabies [24].

268

Travassos da Rosa et al. (2006) stated that the proximity of animal husbandry to

269

the dwellings was a predisposing factor for the attacks on humans that occurred in

270

2004/2005 in Pará state. However, these characteristics were not observed in the present

271

study. For the population, RESEX's are associated to the improvement of the quality of

272

life of people that use forest resource for subsistence, being prohibited the creation of

273

livestock in these areas, because it contradicts its rules of sustainable use [22]. These units

274

were created for the protection of mangrove ecosystems, which constitute an area under

275

strong anthropic pressure, with increased exploitation of their natural resources [21].

276

Informal reports reveal that attacks on humans increased when bovine were removed from

277

such areas. It is also possible that hunting activities by the native population are promoting

278

a reduction in the supply of natural prey for bats, such as the crab-eating raccoon (Procyon

279

carnivores) and nonhuman primates. These animals are targeted and slaughtered by

280

fishermen because they feed on the crabs caught in their traps, thereby reducing their

281

daily catch. Another relevant factor is the fact that the vegetation of the area is

282

predominantly composed of natural fields and mangroves, where little food is available

283

for the vampire bat [20].

284

The age group most affected in this study differs from that reported in previous

285

studies. Whereas most of the victims in this study were male adults, Travassos da Rosa

286

et al. (2006) reported children as the main victims of the rabies virus transmitted by

287

vampire bats in the 2004-2005 period. In contrast to our study, the victims in the

288

Travassos da Rosa study were bitten in their own residences, which commonly house

289

families with individuals of various age groups. In this context, bats seem to prefer

290

children. In the present study, the targets of attacks were clusters of adults who gathered

291

for work, often associated with alcohol consumption. Individuals become passive and

292

docile victims after falling asleep following intense work activity during the day. This is

293

similar to the behavior of herd animals, which are favored targets of vampire bats, as they

294

seek abundant prey and tend to remain in the same place for prolonged periods to feed

295

15,16.

296

This study also demonstrates for the first time the occupational nature of the bat

297

attack problem in the region. The vulnerability of crab fishermen is closely tied to their

298

work activity, as they are bitten primarily while working in the mangroves. Usually these

299

individuals dwell in shacks (huts) built on upland soil inside the mangrove or on the

300

beaches. These dwellings are completely open, with just a tarp or straw roof, and are used

301

for sleeping during the work period. Even students who were bitten reported that they

302

were accompanying their parents to help with crab fishing during the school vacation.

303

Residents of the Deolândia, Guarajuba and Porto Grande communities accounted

304

for most respondents. These communities are the main centers for swamp ghost crab

305

fishing in the region, and ghost crabs are the main natural resource exploited as a source

306

of income by these communities. Therefore, contact between humans and bats is

307

inevitable, as crabs are the only source of income for many of these fishermen. However,

308

the lack of individual protection equipment certainly contributes to the increased number

309

of bat attacks in this population [2,4].

310
311

Conclusions

312
313

Using a single city as a model for investigating bat attacks in the Amazon, this study

314

showed that, for each person who seeks anti-rabies treatment after being attacked by bats

315

in the region, there are 12.2 people who do not seek care and can be easily reached by

316

surveillance agencies through snowball sampling. We also found that the population most

317

at risk is that of crab fishermen, suggesting that bat attacks are an occupational hazard.

318

These results can help health surveillance agencies to establish measures for the

319

prevention of human rabies in these individuals. They can also help minimize costs and

320

increase the efficiency of public health measures, thus avoiding the emergence of rabies

321

in the Salgado micro-region of Pará state.
