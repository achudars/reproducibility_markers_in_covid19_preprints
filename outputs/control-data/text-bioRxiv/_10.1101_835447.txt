Abstract
Limnoperna fortunei — popularly known as the Golden mussel — is an aggressive invasive species that has been
causing environmental damage and adversely affecting economic sectors dependent on freshwater ecosystems in
South America. As a non-model species, knowledge about its biology is very limited, especially molecular
mechanisms that contribute to its invasiveness, such as its high reproduction rate. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is
considered the gold standard technique to determine gene expression levels and its accuracy relies on the use of
stably expressed reference genes for data normalization and to minimize technical variability. Our goal was to
identify reliable reference genes to perform gene expression analysis on the gonads of L. fortunei. The stability of
five candidate genes (RPS3, EF1ɑ, HS6ST3B, NAPA and UBE2F) in the gonads of male and female mussels was
evaluated by using two algorithms, Bestkeeper and Genorm. Results show that NAPA, UBE2F and RPS3 genes
are stable enough to compose a reliable normalization factor for gene expression analyses comparing both sexes.
HS6ST3B and NAPA were found to be more stable in female gonads; thus, their application as a normalization
factor is preferable for studies limited to female processes only.

1. INTRODUCTION
Invasive species are estimated to be responsible for at least 39% of the extinctions that have occurred over the past
four centuries and are considered the second most important threat to worldwide biodiversity after biological
resource use (overexploitation) [1,2]. The golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei), a species native to Asia, has
become an aggressive invader in South America, disrupting freshwater ecosystems and causing major economic
losses. This mussel (Bivalvia, Mytilidae) causes such extensive changes in the environment — by decreasing
substrate availability for native species and by altering the composition and recycling of nutrients in water — that
it is considered an ecosystem engineer of freshwater environments, altering their structure and function [3]. Golden
mussel infestation affects several economic sectors, including the harvesting and treatment of freshwater for
drinking water, fishing and aquaculture, shipping, and especially hydroelectric power generation. So-called
“biofouling” of hydroelectric power plant components, such as intake grids, pipes, and pumps, requires that power
generation be interrupted for maintenance more frequently. L. fortunei is reported to impact at least 40% of Brazil’s
hydroelectric power plants (HPPs), causing losses on the order of USD 120 million per year, just in lost revenue
[4].
To date, the available control methods, mostly physical (e.g. mechanical removal) or chemical (e.g. chlorine), have
been unsuccessful in controlling the invasion by this organism. The primary evidence of the ineffectiveness of
these methods is that the golden mussel continues to disseminate on the continent. Since it was first reported in
South America in 1991 in the estuary of Argentina’s La Plata River, L. fortunei has spread to four other countries:

Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, and Brazil. In the Brazilian Pantanal wetlands, the golden mussel is close to the Téles
Pires River, one of the affluents of the Amazon basin, threatening the aquatic biodiversity of this vast ecosystem
[5]. After almost 30 years of invasion and migration, L. fortunei has spread 5000 km northward, reaching the
Brazilian Northeast [6].
In order to develop more effective methods for controlling the golden mussel, gaps in our knowledge about its
biology, especially the mechanisms underlying the biological attributes that make it such a successful invader,
need to be narrowed. Certainly key among these biological advantages is its rapid reproduction, which is, in part,
a consequence of its rapid development, whereby L. fortunei reaches sexual maturity in just three or four months
[7], [8]. The golden mussel is dioecious, i.e. sexes are separate, although there are rare reports of hermaphroditism.
Reproduction, which is external, occurs almost continuously throughout the year. Gametes are released into the
water, where fertilization takes place [7,8].
An important milestone for understanding the biology of this species was the sequencing of its genome [9]. In
addition, transcriptomic (RNA-seq) analyses have been performed for tissues such as the digestive glands, foot,
mantle, muscle [9,10, 11], and, more recently, for tissue from the gonads of both sexes [12]. This latest work
characterized the gene expression profile of adult male and female gonads and revealed almost 4000 sex-biased
transcripts in this tissue. Despite the value of these genome-wide data resources, experimental assessment of gene
functions in the golden mussel is incipient.
RNA-seq studies produce informative large-scale gene expression data without the need for any previous sequence
knowledge. Nevertheless, quantitative PCR (qPCR) remains the gold standard technique for accurate
determination of gene expression [13,14]. Indeed, as the RNA-seq cost per sample is still prohibitive for large
sample sizes, qPCR is favored to validate specific RNA-seq expression results [15], as well as to investigate the
functions of specific genes in broader experimental conditions.
The accuracy of qPCR assays is largely dependent on the use of reference genes (RGs) stably expressed in these
experimental conditions. RG expression values are used to normalize the data obtained from genes of interest, in
order to adjust for technical variation in the qPCR workflow as, for example, in the quality and quantity of input
samples and in the retrotranscription efficiency [14,16]. Therefore, suitable reference genes that have had their
stability validated under the study conditions, are essential to identify changes in gene expression which are truely
of biological origin.
Nevertheless, the use of suitable reference genes has not been the rule in the literature. Recently, a review of gene
expression studies in several bivalves of ecotoxicological interest was performed and it was observed that validated
RGs were used in less than 40% of the studies. Of these, less than 25% documented the validation process [17].
Another frequent methodological fault is the use of only a single reference gene in 86.3% of the studies, when the
use of normalization factors, consisting of two or more validated RGs, has been considered standard practice by
the scientific community for over 15 years [14,16].
In this study, we sought to validate RGs for gene expression studies in golden mussel gonads, in order to be able
to then investigate the expression pattern of putative genes thought to be involved in the reproduction of this
mollusk. RGs considered candidates for such evaluation were selected from available RNA-seq data and from the
scarce literature describing the validation of RGs for the gonads of close species. We were able to validate suitable
RGs for the normalization of qPCR data produced from male and female golden mussel gonads.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Selection of candidate reference genes
Candidate reference genes were selected using transcriptome and transcripts expression data previously generated
from the gonads of spawning male and females golden mussels [12]. The expression matrix was used for EdgeR
and DESeq2 methods to perform statistical tests between the groups. Transcripts were evaluated according to their
fold change (|logFC|), when comparing males and females, and the coefficient of variation (CV%= standard

deviation/mean*100) of their expression counts (trimmed mean of M-values, TMM) [18] across the biological
replicates (three for each sex). The selection was based on the premise that the more stable the gene, the lower the
LogFC and CV% values. Transcripts for which the TMM count was zero in at least one of the samples, as well as
those which did not match any gene in the reference genome, [9] were not considered.
In order to avoid polymorphic positions during the primer design process, the identification of SNPs based on the
aforementioned RNA-seq dataset was undertaken using a strategy similar to the one described as mpileuptranscriptome [19], except that the transcriptome assembly was generated by a concatenation of three different
strategies as described previously [12]. Briefly, the concatenated transcriptome was used as the reference and reads
were mapped using Bowtie2 [20]. Then, Samtools mpileup and bcftools [20,21] were used to call SNPs from the
mapped reads and a final multifasta file with IUPAC ambiguity codes was generated. These sequences were used
for primer design with the Primer-BLAST tool [22], avoiding regions containing SNPs. Primers were designed to
span exon-exon junctions, except for HS6ST3B, which is a single-exon gene. This was based on the exon-intron
structure predicted for each gene in the golden mussel reference genome [9]. The presence of secondary structures
(hairpin and dimers) in the primers was evaluated using the Oligoanalyzer tool (IDT). Finally, primers specificity
was verified by BLASTn searches against the L. fortunei genome (GCA_003130415.1). All primers generated in
this study are described in Table 1. All transcript sequences were retrieved from the transcriptome assembly
previously performed [12], which are available in the NCBI sequence read archive (SRA) under accession number
PRJNA587212. Transcript identities were confirmed by BLASTx (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi)
searches against the UniprotKB/Swiss-Prot database. Amplicon sequences are provided in S1 Table.

2.2. Collection, sample processing and histological sex identification
A total of 15 golden mussel (L. fortunei) specimens were collected from the Paranapena River in the state of São
Paulo, Brazil). L. fortunei is an exotic species and is not characterized as endangered or protected species. The
gonads of each specimen were dissected and split in two. One half was stored in RNAlater solution (Sigma Aldrich)
at 4ºC during 24h, after which these specimens were stored at -20ºC until further processing. The other gonad half
was fixed in paraformaldehyde 4% (Isofar) and stored at 4ºC. Fixed gonads underwent standard histological
processing steps: dehydration by increasing concentrations of ethanol (Isofar), clarification with xylene (Isofar)

and impregnation in Paraplast Plus® (Sigma Aldrich). Histological sections (7 µm) were obtained, stained with
hematoxylin and eosin and examined under a light microscope for sex identification and gonadal developmental
stage classification according to Callil, Krinski, and Silva [22].
2.3. RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis
Next, specimens underwent DNAse digestion using components of the TURBO DNA-free kit (Invitrogen) for the
removal of any trace genomic DNA. Then, the absence of DNA contamination and the RNA concentration in the
specimens were determined fluorometrically with Qubit™ dsDNA BR Assay and Qubit™ RNA BR Assay Kits
(Invitrogen), respectively. The synthesis of cDNA was performed using 600 ng of total RNA of each sample. The
retrotranscription reactions were carried out using the High capacity cDNA synthesis kit (Applied Biosystems),
following the manufacturer's protocol.
2.4. Quantitative PCR and gene stability analysis
All the qPCR analyses were performed in technical triplicates in 96-well plates on a QuantStudio 3 Real-Time
PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The amplification efficiencies of each primer pair were determined by running
standard curves with five points of a serial 2-fold dilution (ranging from 10 ng to 0.6 ng of total RNA input per
reaction). The PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) kit was used to perform the qPCR assays,
for which the following components were added in each reaction: 5µl of 2X master-mix, 1 µl of diluted cDNA (10
ng/µl, except for standard curves as detailed above), primers at a final concentration of 0.3 µM (for UBE2F, EF1ɑ
and RPS3 genes) or 0.6 µM (for HS6ST3B and NAPA genes) and water up to 10 µl. The reactions were subjected
to temperature cycling as follows: 50ºC (2 min), 95ºC (2 min), then to 40 repeats of: 95ºC (15 s), 56ºC (15 s), 72ºC
(1 min). At the end of the amplification, reactions underwent a melting curve analysis and amplicons were analyzed
by agarose electrophoresis (2%) with ethidium bromide in order to certify the assay specificity. Negative controls,
where no template was added, were performed for all the genes and every 96-well plate. The raw Cq data
(consisting of the means of the three technical replicates for each specimen) were used to generate a Box-plot
graph using the BoxPlotR tool [23] (available at: http://shiny.chemgrid.org/boxplotr/). Finally, the stability of the
candidate reference genes was evaluated using two algorithms: BestKeeper V1 [24] and Genorm [16], with the
latter embedded in the Qbase+ software, version 3.2 (Biogazelle, Zwijnaarde, Belgium - www.qbaseplus.com).
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We were able to identify stably expressed RGs in the golden mussel gonads because we started from an available
RNA-seq dataset and used qPCR to validate our findings. In order to select the most stably expressed genes in this
dataset, we first ordered the transcripts according to the fold change (|logFC|), when comparing males and females,
narrowing down to the first 300 transcripts displaying the smallest fold change values. Then, the remaining
transcripts were placed in ascending order of CV (%) of the expression counts (TMM) across all the specimens
(three for each sex). As summarized in Table 2, three candidate reference genes were selected among the transcripts
displaying lower fold change (0.018 - 0.030) and a lower expression Coefficient of Variation (4.83% - 6.76%). As
determined by BLAST (Table 2), these transcripts are (1) heparan-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase 3-B (HS6ST3B),
(2) NEDD8-conjugating enzyme UBE2F (UBE2F) and (3) alpha-soluble NSF attachment protein (NAPA).

HS6ST3B is involved in the heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan biosynthetic process, and is part of a gene family
composed of three other 6-O-Sulfotransferases found in zebrafish (Danio rerio) [25]. HS plays important roles in
cell regulation; HS itself is modulated by modifications such as the addition of sulfate groups by this family of
genes. In invertebrates such as Caenorhabditis elegans, a single gene is usually identified and shown to be essential
for normal development [26]. The other two genes are part of distinct processes: NAPA is a component of the
fusion machinery required for vesicular trafficking. [27,28], while UBE2F promotes post-translational protein
modification by conjugating the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to its target proteins [29].
Two additional genes were selected based on previous studies conducted on the gonads of other bivalve molluscs:
40S ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3) and elongation factor 1α (EF1α), which are both involved in protein synthesis.
Even though these two genes presented lower stability in the analyzed RNA-seq data as indicated by fold change
and TMM CV% values (Table 2), they are among the most frequently used RGs in other bivalves [17]. RPS3
proved to be stable in the gonads of the mussel Mytilus galloprovinciallis [30], while EF1α was previously
validated as a RG for the gonads of the scallop Pecten maximus L. [31], the oyster Pinctada margaritifera [32],
and the scallop Mizuhopecten yessoensis [30,33] and for this reason these genes were selected for evaluation in
the golden mussel gonads.
The qPCR assay conditions established for the measurement of these five candidate RGs proved to be efficient,
with amplification efficiencies of all genes falling within the recommended range (90-110%) [14], as shown in
Table 1. The melting curves and the amplicon migration patterns seen with agarose electrophoresis were consistent
with the specific amplification of each target as documented in the supporting material (S1 and S2 Figures),
showing that the qPCR assays were also specific to the genes of interest. Thus, after initial qPCR standardization
and validation, candidate reference genes were measured in a set of L. fortunei gonad specimens, including eight
female and seven male specimens. For each sex, there were specimens from three gonad developmental stages as
follows: in maturation (1 male, 2 females), mature (1 male, 2 females) and spawning (5 males, 4 females).
For a preliminary assessment of the stability of the genes, Cq data distribution was displayed in a box plot (Fig 1).
We first analyzed all the results for the whole dataset (females + males) and then for each sex separately. Each of
the three analyses showed a median Cq between 15 and 0, within the recommended range of medium expression
level for reference genes [34]. Considering the complete data set, the gene with the greatest difference between
the minimum and maximum Cq values was HS6ST3B (7.4), while the gene with the smallest difference was NAPA
(2.7). These results suggest that these two candidates may be the most unstable and stable genes, respectively,

when considering specimens of both sexes. Indeed, HS6ST3B is the gene for which the box plot data distribution
profile for female and male specimens differed the most (Fig 1).

Fig 1. Candidate reference genes expression variation according to Cq values distribution. Center lines show the medians;
box limits indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles; whiskers extend to minimum and maximum values.

The stability of candidate RGs should not be assessed solely on the variability of Cq values and, therefore,
amplification data were also analyzed using two of the most widely used algorithms to evaluate RGs stability:
Genorm [16] and BestKeeper [24]. Genorm is based on the principle that the expression ratio between two perfect
reference genes should be identical in all the analyzed samples. In order to evaluate that, this algorithm performs
pairwise variation analysis, where the standard deviation (SD) of the expression ratios observed across the samples
is calculated for each gene pair combination. A measure of stability (Genorm M value) is calculated for each gene
based on the arithmetic average of the pairwise variation values observed for the combination of the gene with
each one of the other candidates under analysis. Therefore, the lower the M value, the lower the variability and the
higher the gene stability. To rank the genes according to their stability, a stepwise exclusion process was
performed, where the least stable gene is removed and the average M value is recalculated for the remaining genes
until a single gene is left. The result of this process is shown in Fig 2A, where data for both sexes were analyzed
together and separately.

Fig 2. Genorm stability analysis of the candidate reference genes. In (a), the curve shows the stepwise exclusion of the least
stable genes and the resulting gene stability rankings for each analyzed scenario. (b) shows the results from pairwise analysis
performed to determine the minimal recommended number of reference genes to be applied for data normalization.

The stepwise exclusion process identified the same three genes (NAPA > UBE2F > RPS3) as the most stably
expressed in males and in the combined (female and male) set of specimens, while the same process when applied
to the female specimens data alone, generated the three top-ranked stable genes (with the lowest average M values)
that were different (NAPA > HS6ST3B > UBE2F). In each of the three scenarios, NAPA was depicted as the most
stable gene, while EF1ɑ was consistently among the two least stable genes. Even though HS6ST3B was highly
stable in females, this gene was among the the two least stable in males and in the combined female + male data,
which is consistent with the box plot profiles observed in Fig 1. For homogeneous samples, Genorm M values
ranging up to 0.5 are considered ideal, while for heterogeneous and more divergent samples, this cutoff value is
less strict and M values up to 1.0 are considered acceptable [35]. This can be considered the case for the gonads
of both sexes, a tissue where gene expression is highly influenced by the sex of the organism [36][12]. Indeed, in
each of the three analyzed scenarios, the three top-ranked genes all showed average M values below the 1.0
threshold.
In order to evaluate the minimal number of Reference Genes to be used for accurate gene expression, normalization
factors (RGs Cq geometric mean) for increasing numbers of genes were calculated, and the pairwise variation (V)
between two sequential combinations were computed (Vn/n+1). In this analysis, a larger variation means that the
addition of another gene could be beneficial. However, once V is below 0.15, an additional gene is not required
[16]. Fig 2B shows that for females and males, separately, the use of two (NAPA and HS6ST3B) and three (NAPA,
UBE2F and RPS3) genes respectively, is sufficient to reach V < 0.15. However, for the complete dataset, a V value
lower than this threshold was not reached, and the lowest observed V value was 0.22 (V2/3). The 0.15 threshold
should not be considered too strictly, and for difficult samples the normalization by the three most stable genes is
generally recommended [16].
The second algorithm used to evaluate gene stability was BestKeeper [24], which like Genorm, is based on the
principle that stably expressed genes should retain some correlation between their expression levels across the
samples representative of the conditions of interest. In order to evaluate that, BestKeeper computes a series of
descriptive statistics (Table 3A) and performs a Pearson’s pairwise correlation analysis (Table 3B) of each gene
with each other and between each gene and a Bestkeeper Index (BKI). The BKI is calculated as the geometric
mean of the candidate RGs Cq values in each specimen. The coefficient of correlation (r), the coefficient of

First, genes were ranked according to the standard deviation (SD) of Cq values (the lower, the better), which is
considered the most relevant BestKeeper statistic. Genes presenting high SD Cq values are excluded, with the
acceptable cutoff in the literature ranging from 1.0 [24] to 1.5 [37]. In the gene rankings for the group combining
female and male specimens (NAPA > UBE2F > RPS3 > EF1a > HS6ST3B) and the group containing only male
specimens (NAPA > RPS3 > UBE2F > HS6ST3B > EF1ɑ) the two least stable genes, with the highest SD Cq values
(Table 3A) were EF1ɑ and HS6ST3B, while the group consisting of female specimens (NAPA > UBE2F >
HS6ST3B > RPS3 > EF1ɑ) the two least stable genes were RPS3 and EF1ɑ.
Next, the two least stable genes in each scenario were excluded, and pairwise correlation analysis were repeated,
in order to access the correlation between each remaining gene and the BKI, which was recalculated based on the
three most stable genes only (Table 3C). Finally, genes were ranked according to the coefficient of correlation (r)
observed in this final pairwise correlation analysis. The same three most stable genes previously found by Genorm
for the female + male dataset (RPS3 > NAPA > UBE2F), as well as for females (NAPA=HS6ST3B > UBE2F ) and
males (NAPA > UBE2F > RPS3) were confirmed by BestKeeper, differing only in the rank order of the genes.

Additionally, another difference was that NAPA and HS6ST3B were found in this last analysis to be equally stable
in the female gonad specimens.
Therefore, Genorm and BestKeeper results are in agreement, reinforcing that among the investigated candidates
RGs, NAPA, RPS3 and UBE2F are the three most stable genes for the gonads of the golden mussel, and should be
applied together to establish a reliable normalization factor, regardless of the sex of the mussel. On the other hand,
the results also show that HS6ST3B is particularly stable in females, and together with NAPA, seems to be sufficient
for accurate qPCR data normalization in studies tracking gene expression in female gonad specimens only.
RPS3, one of the RGs selected from the literature, turned out to be among the three most stable genes. However,
it proved to be less stable than the RGs picked from RNA-seq data. Although there is no universal reference gene,
and validation is always required for the tissues and species of interest, RPS3 has shown some consistency, being
stable in the gonads of several other bivalves, as mentioned earlier, and might be considered as a candidate to be
validated for the gonads of other mussel species.
The results of this study should be seen in light of several limitations. The first is that the analyzed specimens were
limited to the developmental stages where the sexes have already differentiated and can be observed through the
histological analysis of the gonads. Therefore, for gene expression studies in juveniles, when sex is not yet evident,
validation of the genes evaluated in the present work, and possibly other candidates, is required. Another limitation
is that the stability of the genes evaluated here was verified only in the gonads and, therefore, these reference genes
should not be applied to studies that aim to determine the differential expression between this organ and other
tissues without additional validations.
To our knowledge, this is the first work that sought to validate RGs for the golden mussel in an effort to implement
robust qPCR assays for gene expression analysis in this non-model organism. The application of qPCR to this
species has been limited to the detection of larvae in the environment by absolute quantification, for which RGs
are not required [38–40] and to one research article where qPCR was applied to evaluate gene expression in this
mussel foot, but using a single non-validated RG [11]. We hope that the data presented here may help to change
this picture, enabling the execution of reliable gene expression studies in the golden mussel gonads and
contributing to advance the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of key aspects of its extremely efficient
reproduction, one of the distinguishing features of this aggressive invader.
4. CONCLUSIONS
In this study, we evaluated candidate reference genes for normalization of qPCR data generated from the gonad
specimens of male and female golden mussels. Among the investigated genes, RPS3, UBE2F and NAPA were
found to be the most stable and are indicated for studies with individuals of both sexes or only males. HS6ST3B
and NAPA genes showed greater stability in females and should be preferentially used to compose a normalization
factor in studies investigating only female gonad specimens.
