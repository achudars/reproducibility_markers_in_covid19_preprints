ABSTRACT

20

A large-scale genomic inversion encompassing 0.79 Mb of the 1.816 Mb-long Streptococcus

21

pyogenes serotype M49 strain NZ131 chromosome spontaneously occurs in a minor

22

subpopulation of cells, and in this report genetic selection was used to obtain a stable lineage

23

with this chromosomal rearrangement. This inversion, which drastically displaces the ori site,

24

changes the relative length of the replication arms so that one replichore is approximately 0.41

25

Mb while the other is about 1.40 Mb in length. Genomic reversion to the original chromosome

26

constellation is not observed in PCR-monitored analyses after 180 generations of growth in rich

27

medium. As compared to the parental strain, the inversion surprisingly demonstrates a nearly

28

identical growth pattern in exponential phase. Similarly, when cultured separately in rich

29

medium during prolong stationary phase or in an experimental acute infection animal model

30

(Galleria mellonella), the survival rate of both the parental strain and the invertant is equivalent.

31

However, when co-incubated together, both in vitro and in vivo, the survival of the invertant

32

declines relative to the parental strain. The accompanying aspect of the study suggests that

33

inversions taking place nearby oriC, always happen to secure the linkage of oriC to DNA

34

sequences responsible for chromosome partition. The biological relevance of large scale

35

inversions is also discussed.

INTRODUCTION

50

Circular bacterial chromosomes are replicated in a bidirectional way from the unique

51

origin (oriC) and terminated at the termination region (dif) half a chromosome away (1, 2). The

52

symmetry of the origin and terminus loci were shown to play the role in precise choreography of

53

replicated chromosome separation during cell division (3). It has been shown that genetic

54

variability depends not solely on point mutations but also to a high degree from horizontal

55

transfer of genes and intra-genomic rearrangements, the events that may disrupt chromosome

56

organization. Such a situation creates an “evolutionary conflict” between the tendency for

57

stability and evolutionary drive for diversity (4). The resulting genotype represents the

58

compromise between these two tendencies and reflects the existent selective pressure.

59

With the advent of genomic sequencing, the wealth of whole bacterial genomic data

60

demonstrates that, as selective features, the distribution of genes in most cases respect the co-

61

polarity of DNA replication and genes transcription. It also showed a strong bias towards gene

62

activity and essentiality as well as the GC content in the leading and lagging strands (3, 5-8).

63

Highly expressed genes and stress related genes of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis were

64

shown to be clustered on leading strands of the two opposite sides relative to the origin of

65

replication (9). For this reason, most natural stable inversions are symmetrical at the origin-

66

terminus axis of chromosome replication, thus maintaining gene orientation and gene distance

67

relative to the origin of replication minimizing the disruption of the chromosome organization

68

relative to replication and segregation (10-13).

69

Studies of asymmetrical inversions revealed chromosomal segments refractory to

70

inversion. They were interpreted as deleterious effect of recombination (14) or, in contrast, as

71

recombinational impairment of mechanical nature (15). Inversions, especially large ones,

72

antagonize the organization of bacterial chromosome with the greatest consequences to cell

73

viability. However, it has been shown that such rearrangements may also produce some positive

74

trade-off for the mutants in certain extreme environmental conditions (16). We previously

75

reported a spontaneous, large-scale rearrangement in the genome of Streptococcus pyogenes

76

strain NZ131 that affects expression of the streptolysin O gene (slo) (17). In that study, cells

77

with the 0.79 Mb rearranged segment of the NZ131 chromosome were a minor component of the

78

population and could be detected solely by PCR method. No easily selectable phenotype was

79

available to allow their isolation and study independent of the majority population. In this

80

report, we employ genetic selection to isolate a mutant with this specific rearrangement in S.

81

pyogenes, and use this large artificial inversion to assess its impact on cell viability in vitro and

82

on virulence in an invertebrate acute infection model. Finally, we also performed comparative

83

analysis of our inversion with a number of spontaneous and engineered large inversions.

RESULTS

86

Construction of the invertant OK175. An inversion-selectable mutant of S. pyogenes

87

(strain NZ131, group M49) was constructed by inserting a plasmid construct harboring the distal

88

part of the gene Spy49_0145 and the fragment of Spy49_1180 gene mapping 720 Kb away from

89

the Spy49_0145 gene and the promoter-less erm gene (Fig. 1a). Gene Spy49_0145 encodes an

90

inhibitor of the secreted streptococcal NAD-glycohydrolase, and occupies the central location on

91

a polycistronic mRNA between the upstream NAD-glycohydrolase gene (nga) and the

92

downstream streptolysin O gene (slo) (18). Plasmid pOK67 harboring this insert was previously

93

described (17). At that time, the chromosomal sequence of NZ131 had not been determined so

94

gene Spy49_1180 was temporarily labeled as the Ex sequence, and gene Spy49_0145 was

95

combined into the whole slo upstream sequence (17). The promoter-less ermB gene is silent

96

because it is preceded by the chimerical Spy49_0145-Spy49_1180 sequence in which a weak slo

97

promoter found inside the Spy49_0145 gene (19, 20) is inactive due to the proximity of the

98

Spy49_1180 sequence (17, 20). The insertion, selected by resistance to tetracycline, occurred via

99

recombination between the plasmid and chromosomal Spy49_1180 sequences resulting in the

100

strain OK173 (Fig. 1ab).

101

The rare inversion mutants were captured by selection on plates with erythromycin.

102

Resultant erythromycin resistant colonies occurred following recombination between the

103

plasmid-borne Spy49_0145 sequences and the chromosomal Spy49_0145 gene adjacent to slo,

104

bringing transcriptionally inactive erm gene downstream of the strong nga promoter (21).

105

Verification of the inversion termini. The inversion in the new construct OK175 (Fig.

106

1c) was verified by PCR amplification of the predicted junction sections with corresponding

107

primers Table 2, Fig. 1, Fig. 2) and DNA sequencing of the obtained fragments (Fig. 2b). The

108

inversion was also confirmed by PFGE of the SgrA1 digested chromosomal DNA from both

109

strains (Fig. 3a) and with SmaI and Sfi1 (Supp. Fig. 1). Hybridization of PFGE DNA with

110

specific origin and terminus probes pOK166 and pOK167 (Table 1) demonstrated that a

111

compensatory rearrangement of the origin or the terminus region has not occurred (Fig. 3b).

112

Testing stability of the inversion. The stability of the inversion was tested by sub

113

culturing the strain OK175 for 20 days in THY medium. The samples taken after 10 and 20 days

114

were diluted and 200 colonies were tested for growth on THY plates supplemented with

115

erythromycin. Growth of all colonies suggested that the original invertant OK175 retained its

116

original constellation after approximately 120-130 generations. The lack of any amplified DNA

117

in the PCR reaction using P20 and P152 primers with OK175 DNA as a substrate additionally

118

verified stability of the inversion (Fig. 2b).

119

Growth patterns of NZ131, OK173 and OK175 strains. As demonstrated, the growth

120

pattern of the invertant strain OK175 in the exponential phase does not differ much when

121

compared to the parental strain OK173 (Fig. 4a). However, both strains display slower growth

122

as compared to the original strain NZ131 due to the probable effect of mutation in the

123

Spy49_1180 gene coding for glucokinase (22). When grown in separate cultures for a prolonged

124

period, OK173 and OK175 demonstrated similar survival rates (Fig. 4b). However, when co-

125

cultured in a prolonged competition assay, the invertant lagged significantly behind the parental

126

strain, and after eight days, its percentage in the mixture dropped from the initial ~50% of the

127

population to <0.01% in the sample of 1000 replica plated colonies (Fig. 4c).

128

In vivo infection of G. mellonella larvae with strains OK173 and OK175 demonstrated little

129

difference in pathogenicity in monocultures (Fig. 5a). Further, when compared to the NZ131

130

parental strain, decreased larval mortality was observed in OK173 and OK175, possibly due to

131

the mutation in Spy49_1180. Using the wax worm health index developed by Loh and co-

132

workers (23) morbidity of the infections was also assessed (Fig. 5b), again showing no

133

significant differences in morbidity between strain OK173 and OK175 in G. mellonella

134

infections. Finally, when OK173 and OK175 were co-cultured, faster decline of OK175, as

135

compared to the in vitro experiment (Fig. 4c) was observed (Fig. 5c).

136
137

DISCUSSION

138

In the previous study, we described and characterized an unorthodox RecA-independent

139

genomic rearrangement involving two chromosomal loci separated by 0.79 Mb on the 1.816 Mb

140

long S. pyogenes chromosome (17). This rearrangement positioned a TATAAT and TCGAAA -

141

10 and -35 promoter sequences located in gene Spy49_1180 208 bp upstream from the slo gene.

142

The observed rearrangement could only be detected by PCR, suggesting that only a minor

143

subpopulation of cells carried this orientation. To demonstrate that the translocated promoter

144

might activate slo gene independently of the nga promoter (21), we engineered the inversion by

145

reproducing the junction between the Spy49_1180, the slo upstream sequence, and ermB gene as

146

a selectable marker (Fig. 1a). However, activity of this postulated promoter was not detected

147

(17). Finally, the inversion construct of this study which recreated the previous observation (17)

148

failed to activate slo gene from the classical promoter in Spy49-1180 gene (results not presented)

149

( Fig. 1c). Since all experiments were performed in vitro (THY medium), the possibility remains

150

that some unknown physiological factor might activate the transposed promoter or the previously

151

identified weak slo promoter (19, 20) when synthesis of slo gene but not the nga gene is

152

required.

153

At this point, we thought that given the size and growth characteristics, the constructed

154

inversion deserved further study on its own right. In spite of the defect, the invertant OK175

155

grows at a similar rate in logarithmic phase (Fig. 4a) and survives, both in vitro and in vivo,

156

similarly in a protracted stationary phase when compared to the parental mutant OK173 (Fig. 4b,

157

Fig. 5ab). However, the situation changes when OK173 and OK175 are cultured together (Fig.

158

4c, Fig. 5c). OK175 has diminished fitness when co-cultured with OK173 in depleted medium

159

and scavenging for the remaining nutrients. Additionally, with the in vivo waxworm model,

160

OK175 is outcompeted by OK173 in co-cultures much faster that may be due to the Slo-

161

phenotype of OK175 (Fig. 5c) These results show great similarity to the previous study which

162

demonstrated that in naturally non-transformable E. coli, extracellular DNA can serve as the sole

163

source of carbon and energy in nutrient-starved conditions (24). Genome sequencing revealed

164

that horizontal gene transfer is frequent among strains of S. pyogenes, and it is reasonable to

165

propose that in vivo DNA transfer may occur by mechanisms other than transduction as has been

166

seen in E. coli (22, 25). In their seminal work, Mashburn-Warren and collaborators demonstrated

167

that in S. pyogenes all functional genes necessary for transformation exist, and while the pathway

168

does not typically function in laboratory media it can occur in biofilms (26, 27). Thus, it is

169

realistic to speculate that S. pyogenes, similarly to E. coli (24), is also in possession of an

170

additional double-stranded DNA uptake system that is functional to some degree in OK173 but

171

not in the invertant OK175 that consequently is unable to compete with OK173 for scavenging

172

DNA in depleted medium (Fig. 4c).

173

In contrast to spontaneous, X-shaped inversions in which the rearrangements reverse the

174

genomic sequence symmetrically around the origin of replication (10, 13, 28) the inversion we

175

report here drastically displaces the ori site, resulting in a dramatic change of replichore sizes

176

from both having approximately the same lengths to 0.41 Mb and 1.40 Mb, respectively. The

177

terminus region has not been closely studied in strain NZ131, but its location opposite the origin

178

of replication, as expected, can be easily deduced from the switch of the GC content and polarity

179

of transcription in leading and lagging strands as well nucleotide comparative analysis (22)(see

180

Supplemental Fig. 2).

181

Bacterial chromosomes are adaptively organized to optimize cellular functions such as

182

chromosome replication, segregation and resolution, symmetrical polarity of transcription, gene

183

dosage (including optimal positioning of highly expressed and stress genes), and coordinated

184

gene expression (4). All of these functions should have been affected to some degree in the

185

OK175 invertant. They obviously are but given the size and eccentricity of the inversion on one

186

side, and stability and almost normal growth rate of the invertant, these effects are surprisingly

187

not considerably pronounced. A facultative pathogen, S. pyogenes shows many repeated

188

elements like phage chromosomes, ribosomal operons and IS elements (13, 16, 22) resulting in

189

frequent chromosome rearrangements that allow fast adaptation by permitting generation of

190

antigen variations. As speculated before, S. pyogenes and similar organisms containing such

191

recombination elements, as is disclosed in frequent rearrangements, have possibly relaxed the

192

selection of some chromosomal features of their chromosomes (4). Also, both strains OK173

193

and OK175 demonstrate, possibly due to the mutated Spy49_1180 gene, slower growth relative

194

to NZ131 (Fig. 1a), which may attenuate the harmful effect of the inversion (29).

195

It is intriguing to compare inversion of this study with large inversions described in the extensive

196

study of the engineered inversions in closely related low G+C member of Streptococcaceae

197

family Firmicute, Lactococcus lactis (29). Of the strains described in that report, the one having

198

a large asymmetric inversion encompassing oriC (strain pcp-12; 44% of the chromosome

199

inverted) is similar to OK175 insomuch as the inversion is stable for up to 150 generations. By

200

contrast, the two other L. lactis strains with large asymmetric inversions in the same region (pcp-

201

6 and pcp-31), which are shorter than pcp-12 and have end points closer to oriC, are less stable.

202

The longer of these two (pcp-31) is stable in synthetic medium but unstable in rich medium, and

203

the one with the smaller inversion (pcp-6), is unstable in both media (29).

204

Studies on Bacillus subtilis, demonstrate that bacterial cells, similarly to eukaryotic cells,

205

use a mitotic-like mechanism (Par) to provide accurate chromosome partitioning and separation

206

of the replicated sister replication origins. These results identified the parABS genes, which are

207

almost invariably located close to the origin of chromosome replication (oriC). Chromosomal

208

centromere-like parS sequences flank the origin of replication (30, 31). ParB is a site-specific

209

DNA-binding protein (SpoOJ in B. subtilis) that binds parS sites (31-33) and then spreads

210

laterally along the DNA, perhaps for several kb (34-36). It also controls the product of parA,

211

which affects initiation of DNA replication (37). However, the main role of ParB (SpoOJ) is its

212

role in recruitment of the SMC proteins to the oriC site, the proteins being conserved from

213

bacteria to humans. Most bacteria encode a single SMC protein that forms a homodimer (38).

214

The fact that SMC complexes are highly enriched at the region around the origin of replication

215

indicates that they are directly involved in proper segregation (39-42). The conserved positional

216

relationship of parS, parB, parS and oriC suggests that these genes have coevolved and that

217

there is a selective pressure promoting their proximity. All these data provide support for the

218

notion that bacterial cells use a mitotic-like mechanism to provide accurate chromosome

219

partitioning, separation of the replicated sister origins and regulation in B. subtillis with crucial

220

role of SpoOJ (ParB) and to a lesser degree Soj (ParA) (43) and their orthologs in other bacteria

221

(44).

222

Considering the clustering of partition relevant genes around the oriC, one can propose

223

that the described largest pcp-12 inversion, as compared to the smaller pcp-6 and pct-31

224

inversions, of L. lactis (29), is the one that does not disrupt partition complex around oriC but

225

translocates it en block to the different location of the chromosome. In an attempt to identify

226

parS sites in S. pyogenes chromosome, we initially used a BLASTN search with the parS

227

consensus sequence TGTTNCACGTGAAACA from in B. subtilis (31) but with no success.

228

However, the parS consensus sequence from S. pneumoniae genome (tGTTTCACGtGAAACa)

229

(45) identified three hits in immediate vicinity of the oriC: TGTTTCACGTGAA (from 1209–

230

1221 bp); TGTTTCACGTGA (1293-1304 bp) and TCACGTGAAAC (2272-2282 bp). The first

231

two sequences in S. pyogenes are direct repeats that form inverted repeats to the third sequence.

232

In addition, a parB gene was identified at the very end of the NZ131 chromosome in the

233

immediate proximity to oriC (22).

234

pyogenes appears to be highly clustered around the origin. Based upon this inference, the

235

inversion in OK175 strain, which is similar to the inversion strain pcp-12 of L. lactis,

236

translocates the whole parBC cluster to a new distant location on the chromosome. In addition,

237

the most recent study demonstrated that the genome of the hyper virulent strain of S. pyogenes

238

M23ND underwent complex rearrangements that included multiple DNA translocations,

239

inversions and integrations (16). In one inversion, found in six independent isolates, the oriC–

240

proximal recombination site was found to be located only 3 Kb counterclockwise of the parB

241

site ensuring the linkage of that gene to the oriC keeping in that way the partition complex intact.

242

Finally, in the long-term evolutionary experiment (25 years) with E. coli, an inversion covering

243

approximately 1.5

244

recombination site occurred approximately 0.28 Mb counterclockwise of oriC keeping the

245

nearby sequences linked to the oriC. Finally, it was reported that MukBEF, a member of the

246

SMC superfamily is preferentially localized within the region of at least 0.4 Kb centered on oriC

247

(41) and that recruitment of MukBEF towards the origin region is essential for chromosome

248

segregation in E. coli (47).

249

comparative analysis of the OK175 invertant and the invertant mutants reported above, suggest

250

that optimal functioning of the spindle apparatus requires strict clustering of their genetic

251

determinants in the proximity of oriC and that their en bloc transposition, by inversions, and

252

possibly by other types of rearrangements, even to the distant part of the chromosome, does not

253

necessarily have immediate consequences to the cell.

254

and genes responsible for chromosome partition had been well established, but their obligatory

The results of this work show that S. pyogenes can also tolerate, at least for some time,

258

drastic chromosomal rearrangements. This inversion, and probably similar chromosomal

259

perturbations, are certainly not adaptive for long-term survival in vivo, but one could imagine

260

that under strong environmental stress, they might serve as a raw genetic material for further

261

adaptive chromosome rearrangements. As demonstrated by theoretical models with higher

262

organisms, small populations under stress followed by random drift can promote the

263

accumulation of not only neutral mutations but also of slightly deleterious mutations, in which

264

the resulting alterations to chromosome structure can provide potential settings for secondary

265

adaptive changes that are not possible in large populations (48, 49). In our experimental system,

MATERIAL AND METHODS

275

Bacterial strains, media and culture. Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are

276

described in Table 1. S. pyogenes strains were grown in Difco Todd-Hewitt medium containing

277

0.2% yeast extract (THY).

278

tetracycline were added to the plates. Escherichia coli was grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium.

279

When required, 500 µg/ml of erythromycin and 12.5 µg/ml of tetracycline were added to the

280

plates. To make plates, both THY and LB media were solidified with 1.5% agar. The growth of

281

bacterial cultures in the exponential phase was monitored using the Bioscreen-C automated

282

microbiology growth curve analysis system (Growth Curves USA, Piscataway, NJ).

283

quantifying CFU, the described method from Jett et al. was employed (50). When grown in the

284

mixed long-term stationary cultures, the strains were discriminated on the basis of their

285

sensitivity or resistance to erythromycin.

286

DNA manipulation, isolation, and sequencing. Plasmid isolation, digestions with restriction

287

enzymes, ligation, Southern Blot and other recombinant DNA techniques were performed by

288

standard procedures (51). Plasmids were introduced into S. pyogenes recipients by

289

electrotransformation (52), and transformation of E. coli was performed by standard CaCl2

290

method (53). Plasmids were maintained in E. coli host JM109 and isolated with a commercial

When needed, 1.5 µg/ml of erythromycin and 12.5 µg/ml of

291

plasmid isolation kit (Qiagen Inc.). For cloning PCR fragments, specialized cloning vectors with

292

T-nucleotide overhangs pT7Blue (Novagen) and pGEM-T Easy (Promega) were used. All

293

sequencing reactions were performed at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center

294

Laboratory for Genomics and Bioinformatics core sequencing facility.

295

PCR analysis. PCR oligonucleotide primers used in this study are listed in Table 2 and were

296

purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Streptococcal template DNA

297

was isolated by the guanidium thiocyanate DNA isolation method (54). In most cases 40 cycles

298

of amplification were carried out in a Techne DNA thermocycler with the following cycle: strand

299

denaturation (1min at 94° C), annealing (1 min at 59° C) and elongation (1 min at 72° C). The

300

total volume of PCR mixture was 50 µl, and consisted of Taq DNA polymerase (1 U), Taq

301

polymerase buffer (1 X), Mg2+ (2mM), deoxynucleotide phosphates (200 µM each) and primers

302

(1 µM each). Following amplification, 10 µl of each reaction was analyzed by agarose gel

303

electrophoresis. When used for DNA sequencing, PCR products were purified with PCR

304

purification kit following the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen, Inc.).

305

Pulse field electrophoresis. CHEF gel was performed as previously described (55) with some

306

modifications. A portion of the agarose plug containing total DNA from each strain was excised

307

and digested with either SgrA1, SmaI, or Sfi1 restriction endonucleases at 37°C for 16 h. The

308

plugs were washed in 1 ml 10 mM Tris-1mM EDTA, pH 8 for 1 h at 37°C and then loaded into

309

the wells of 1% pulse-field certified agarose gel (Bio-Rad Laboratories) in 0.5X TBE (45mM

310

Tris HCl, 45mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA). The digested DNA was separated by electrophoresis

311

using a CHEF DRII device (Bio-Rad Laboratories) with a pulse ramped from 5 to 35 sec for 21

312

hr. at 200 V. The gels were then stained with ethidium bromide and photographed before DNA

313

fragments were transferred to membranes by capillary blotting.

As described below, the

Construction of molecular probes for detecting chromosomal restriction fragments with

317

origin and terminus sequences. The probes that contained the sequences around origin and

318

terminus of replication were amplified from these regions of the NZ131 genome sequence (22).

319

The origin of replication for S. pyogenes has been previously reported (56), and the terminus was

320

deduced by homology with known dif sequences (Supp. Fig. 2). DNA probes specific for these

321

sites were prepared using primers P212 and P215 and P217 and P219 (Fig. 2) for the origin and

322

terminus regions respectively.

323

(Roche Diagnostics) and done according to the manufacturer's recommended conditions.

324

Hybridization, stringency washes, and detection of the bound probe were also performed

325

according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol and reagents.

326

Galleria mellonella acute infection in vivo model. Larvae of the greater wax moth Galleria

327

mellonella (commonly referred to as wax worms) were reared in-house in a dedicated 37°C

328

incubator and fed an antibiotic-free, artificial diet of 227g of Gerber mixed-grain baby cereal, 80

329

ml honey, and 80 ml glycerin as previously described (57). Larvae were selected at the last

330

instar before pupation and then kept at 4°C for 15 minutes before injection. Overnight S.

331

pyogenes cultures were grown in THY broth at 37°C and harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 x g

332

for 5 minutes then resuspended in standard phosphate buffered solution (PBS) to achieve a

333

desired concentration between 1 x 107 - 2 x 107 CFU/ml. Suspensions were standardized at

334

OD600 nm (OD600 nm between 0.5-0.6) in PBS to achieve the final concentration.

335

Intrahaemocoelic injection of the larvae (n=10 per condition) was performed by a 1 mL

336

tuberculin syringe (Norm-Ject) fitted with a custom 30½-gauge needle (BD PrecisionGlide) at a

volume of 20 µL (~20,000 cells) and using a KDS 100 automated syringe pump (KD Scientific,

338

Holliston, MA). Blank PBS (20 µL) was injected into an equal number of control larvae.

339

Larvae were injected at the hindmost left proleg as previously described (23, 58). Post injection

340

larvae were incubated in 9 cm petri dishes at 37°C for 5 days. Worm health index and mortality

341

were scored as described previously (23).

342

Galleria mellonella competition assay.

343

(erythromycin sensitive) and OK175 (erythromycin resistant) were prepared as described above.

344

Cultures were then mixed and resuspended to achieve a 50:50 ratio. Serial dilutions of this

345

preparation were plated on sheep’s blood agar plates and on THY agar plates supplemented with

346

3 µg erythromycin/ml to determine culture ratios. 20 µL of this suspension was injected into

347

worms as described above. Larvae were injected (n = 15) and incubated at 37°C in a 9 cm Petri

348

dish. At intervals of 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours post-infection (PI), groups of 3 worms were

349

chosen at random and sacrificed. Each worm was homogenized by mechanical disruption and

350

resuspended in 0.5 ml PBS as previously described (23). Aliquots of this suspension were

351

serially diluted and plated as previously described to determine the relative CFUs of OK173 and

Figure 1. (a) Construction of the starting mutant with predilection to produce a large inversion

361

was made by selecting integration of the plasmid pOK67 (tetR) into Spy49_1180 gene of the

362

strain NZ131. (b) The construct obtained (OK173) contains two inverted Spy49_0145 gene

363

sequences prone to recombine and generate an inversion. The origin (ori) and terminus (dif) loci

364

are indicated (c). The generated inversion (OK175) covers 0.72 Mb (40.5%) of the

365

approximately 1.82 Kb long S. pyogenes chromosome. It asymmetrically encompasses the ori

366

region drastically changing its position on the chromosome. The short arrows indicate the

367

position of PCR primers used for the verification of the constructs. The colored arcs illustrate the
