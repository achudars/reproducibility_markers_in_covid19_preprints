Abstract
Mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC)-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) have been reported
to be beneficial against dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. However, the
underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. We hypothesize that the tumor necrosis
factor-α-stimulated gene/protein 6 (TSG-6) in EVs is a key factor influencing the alleviation
of colitis symptoms. DSS-induced colitis mice (C57BL/6, male, n = 6-8/group) were
intraperitoneally administered EVs (100 ug/mice) on day 1, 3, and 5; colon tissues were
collected on day 10 for histopathological, qRT-PCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence
analyses. In mice injected with EV, inflammation was alleviated. Indeed, EVs regulated the
levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-10
in inflamed colons. However, when injected with TSG-6 depleted EV, the degree of
inflammatory relief was reduced. Furthermore, TSG-6 in EVs plays a key role in increasing
regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the colon. In conclusion, this study shows that TSG-6 in EVs is a
major factor in the relief of DSS-induced colitis, by increasing the number of Tregs in the
colon.

Introduction
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic debilitating disease that affects both humans
and dogs, characterized by abdominal pain and diarrhea. It may result in significant morbidity
and mortality, with compromised quality of life and life expectancy. Clinical signs may be
controlled by single or combination therapy, including dietary modifications, antibiotics and
immune-suppressants. However, since there is no clear treatment method, clinical recurrence
frequently occurs even after treatment, and thus, new therapeutic agents need to be sought [1].
Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are of great interest as novel therapeutics for IBD
patients because of their unique ability to regulate immune cells and heal damaged colonic
tissue [2]. Particularly, it has been found that extracellular vesicles (EVs, 40–1000 nm sized
circular membrane fragments shed from the cell surface) secreted from cells can mediate the
delivery of secreted molecules in cell-to-cell communication, studies on the use of EVs as an
alternative to stem cells have been actively conducted [3, 4]. Recently, various studies have
been carried out on the application of EVs as therapeutic agents in various pre-clinical models
such as acute kidney injury, hepatitis, cystitis and uveitis. Although these studies have reported
that inflammation is alleviated following treatment with EVs, the factors responsible for the
protective effects have yet to be elucidated [5-8]. In addition, injecting EVs into DSS-induced
colitis mouse models has shown that not only does it improve activity and appetite, but it also
alleviates inflammation in the colon [9].
Although the protective effects exhibited by EV has been suggested to be related to
immunomodulatory factors such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), indoleamine2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2), and nitric oxide (NO)[10], the mechanisms
associated with this therapeutic mechanism have yet to be examined. If stem cell-derived EVs

are to be used as therapeutic agents in the future, in-depth mechanistic studies to determine
which factors are most highly associated with the ability of EVs to alleviate inflammation must
be conducted.
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α stimulated gene/ protein 6 (TSG-6) secreted from stem cells is
a major factor responsible for regulation of inflammatory responses [11-13]. Moreover, several
studies have shown that TSG-6 plays important roles in attenuating DSS-induced colitis in
mice by altering the composition of immune cells in the colon [12, 14]. However, studies on
TSG-6 in EVs have not yet been conducted, and, thus, further studies are required.
In particular, IBD is related to an immunological imbalance in the intestinal mucosa, which is
primarily associated with cells of the adaptive immune system that respond to self-antigens
produced under inflammatory conditions in such patients [15, 16]. Among the intestinal
immune cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs) control the balance of immune cell functions and play
critical roles in self-tolerance and homeostasis in the colon [17]. However, studies on the effect
of stem cell-derived EVs on colon Tregs are lacking and need to be studied.
Therefore, this study focused on elucidating the role of TSG-6 in EVs in mitigating colitis and
as well as to describe potential mechanisms responsible for any protective effects observed in
DSS-induced mouse models of colitis. We also investigated the effect that EVs have on Tregs
within the colon and how TSG-6 in EVs affects the Treg population in inflamed colons.

Materials and Methods
All animal experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Seoul National University (SNU), Republic of Korea, and all protocols were in
accordance with approved guidelines (SNU; protocol no. SNU-180829-2-1).

Isolation, culture, and characterization of cAT-MSCs
The adipose tissue was obtained from a healthy adult female dog during ovariohysterectomy
at the SNU Veterinary Medicine Teaching Hospital, with the owner’s consent. MSCs were
isolated from tissues and cultures as previous described [12, 18]. The cells were characterized
for the expression of several stem cell markers by flow cytometry before they were used in the
experiments. Additionally, the differentiation ability of cells was confirmed for cAT-MSCs at
passages 3 and 4, and these cells were used in subsequent experiments. The methods used for
isolating, culturing, and characterizing stem cells are described in detail in supplementary
material 1, and corresponding results are described in detail in supplementary figure 1. This
experiment was repeated a minimum of three times to confirm reproducibility.

Isolation and characterization of EVs
cAT-MSCs were cultured for 48 h in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM; PANBiotech, Aidenbach, Germany) supplemented with 10 % Exosome-depleted Fetal bovine
serum (FBS; Systembio, CA, USA) and 1 % penicillin-streptomycin (PS; PAN-Biotech). The
supernatant from each cultured cAT-MSC sample was collected on ice and centrifuged at 300
× g for 10 min to remove the cells. Each supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, centrifuged

at 2000 × g for 30 min to remove cellular debris, and then passed through a 0.22-μm filter
(Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) to remove the large vesicles. Each supernatant was transferred
to a fresh tube and centrifuged at 110,000 × g (Beckman Avanti Centrifuge J-26XP with 70Ti
rotor, Brea, CA, USA) for 80 min, washed with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS),
and purified by centrifugation at 110,000 × g for 80 min. All centrifugation steps were
performed at 4 °C. Each pellet was resuspended in DPBS and sterilized by filtration through a
0.22-μm filter (Figure 1C). The total protein concentration in each EV preparation was
quantified by performing bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assays, and the samples were stored at −80
°C until use.
Protein markers of purified EVs were determined by western blotting with antibodies against
cluster of differentiation 63 (CD63; NBP2-42225; Novus Inc., Littleton, CO, USA) and CD9
(GTX76185; GeneTex, Irivine, CA, USA). The EV morphology was characterized by
transmission electron microscopy. Briefly, 10 μL of an EV suspension was placed on clean
parafilm. A 300-mesh formvar/carbon-coated electron microscopy grid was floated on the drop,
with the coated side facing the suspension, and allowed to adsorb for 20 min at 23 ± 2℃. The
grid was transferred to a 100 μL drop of distilled water and left to stand for 2 min. The grid
was then transferred to a 50 μL drop of 2 % uranyl acetate for negative staining for 10 min,
followed by observation under a TEM (LIBRA 120, Carl Zeiss, Germany) at 120 kV. The size
distribution of the particles was measured using a Zeta-potential & Particle size Analyzer
(ELSZ-1000ZS, Otsuka Electronics, Osaka, Japan). This experiment was repeated a minimum
of three times to confirm reproducibility.

Using citrate phosphate dextrose adenine-containing tubes, we collected blood samples (30 mL)
from three healthy dogs. The blood samples were diluted with an equal volume of phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) and then layered over Ficoll-Plaque PLUS (GE Healthcare Life Sciences,
Little Chalfont, UK) in a conical tube. After centrifugation at 400 × g for 30 min, the buffy
coat layer was carefully collected. The collected samples were incubated with red blood celllysis buffer at room temperature for 10 min. After adding PBS, each sample was centrifuged
at 400 × g for 10 min, and the washing and centrifugation steps were repeated. Canine PBMCs
(cPBMCs) were resuspended in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium (PanBiotech, Dorset, Germany) supplemented with 10 % EV-free FBS and 1 % PS. Non-adherent
cells were obtained after 24 hours.

Treatment of cPBMC-derived lymphocytes with cAT-MSCs or cAT-MSC-derived EVs
Non-adherent cells (comprising peripheral blood lymphocytes but excluding peripheral blood
monocytes) were stimulated with 5 μg/mL Concanavalin A (Con A; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA) for 12 h. The stimulated lymphocytes were transferred to a conical tube and
centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and the remaining
lymphocytes were resuspended in RPMI containing 10 % exosome-free FBS and 1 % PS. The
stimulated lymphocytes (1 × 106 cells/wall) were seeded in 6 well plate. Stimulated
lymphocytes were cocultured with cAT-MSC-EV, siRNA-MSC-EV and siTSG6-MSC-EV
(100 ug/well). Total lymphocytes without EV were cultured as a control. Total RNA was
extracted from all cell groups after 48 hours of incubation.

RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain
reaction
RNA was extracted using the Easy-BLUE Total RNA Extraction Kit (Intron Biotechnology).
Next, cDNA was synthesized using LaboPass M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase
(Cosmogenetech, Seoul, Korea), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA samples
were assayed using AMPIGENE® qPCR Green Mix Hi-ROX with SYBR Green Dye (Enzo
Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Expression levels were normalized to those of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH). The sequences of the primers used in this experiment are shown in Table 1.

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection of cAT-MSCs
When cAT-MSCs reached approximately 70 % confluence, they were transfected for 48 h with
TSG-6 siRNA or control siRNA (sc-39819 and sc-27007, respectively, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions [12, 18, 19]. TSG-6 knockdown was
confirmed by qRT-PCR. The cells were washed twice with PBS, and the media was exchanged
with DMEM containing Exosome-depleted FBS for an additional 48 h before collecting TSG6-depleted EVs. EVs were obtained using an ultracentrifuge as above described, and the
relative TSG-6 protein levels in EVs were measured by western blot analysis. Protein
concentrations were determined by performing BCA assays. The total protein content (20 μg)
of each sample was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting with antibodies against CD63 (LSBio) and TSG-6 (sc30140; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). This experiment was repeated a minimum of three times

to confirm reproducibility.

Flow cytometry analysis
To evaluate Treg polarization, PBMC-derived lymphocytes cocultured with cAT-MSC-EVs
were harvested. Obtained cells (1 × 106) were suspended in 100μL DPBS and 1 μL of each
primary antibody against the following proteins: FOXP3-PE (eBioscience, San Diego, CA,
USA; 1:100) and CD3-FITC (MCA1774F; Bio-Rad, San Diego, CA, USA; 1:100). After
incubation for 1 h at 23 ± 2 ℃, the cells were washed with DPBS. Unstained cells were used
as controls for autofluorescence. Cell fluorescence was analyzed with a flow cytometer (FACS
Aria Ⅱ; BD bioscience). The results were analyzed using FlowJo 7.6.5 software (Tree Star,
Inc., Ashland, OR, USA).

ELISA analysis
The protein levels of interleukin 10 (IL-10) in each cell culture supernatant was detected using
an IL-10 Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay Kit (ELISA; eBioscience), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Mice
Male C57BL/6 mice (6-to-8 week-old and weighing 18 to 20 g) were acclimatized for 7 days
with a 12 h light/dark cycle at 22 ℃ and 60 % humidity before performing the experiments.
For environmental enrichment, 3 to 4 mice were raised in polycarbonate cages (324 × 221.5 ×

130 mm) containing clean bedding (shavings; Nara Biotech), cardboard boxes, and tunnels.
Mice were fed a standard laboratory rodent diet and water ad libitum. At the start of the
experiments, the health status of the mice was evaluated by measuring their weight, vitality,
and defecation; the experiments were conducted on mice with no abnormal symptoms. To
generate a murine model of colitis, the mice were administered 3 % DSS (36–50 kDa; MP
Biomedical, Solon, OH, USA) in their drinking water from days 0 to 7. The studies were
conducted using 46 animals, and the mice were randomly divided into 6 groups with 6-8 mice
per group. The mice were treated with 100 µL DPBS, with or without cAT-MSC-EV (100
μg/mouse), by intraperitoneal (IP) injection on days 1, 3 and 5. The disease-activity index (DAI)
represents the combined score of weight loss relative to the initial body weight (grades 0–4; 0,
no weight loss; 1, < 10 % loss; 2, 10–20 % loss; 3, 20–30 % loss; and 4, 30–40 % loss), stool
consistency (grades 0–2; 0, normal; 1, soft; and 2, liquid), the presence of blood in the feces
and anus (grades 0–2; 0, negative fecal occult bleeding; 1; positive fecal occult bleeding; and
3, visible fecal occult bleeding), and general activity (grades 0–2; 0, normal; 1, mildly to
moderate depressed and 2, severely depressed). The DAI score of colitis was calculated
independently by two blinded investigators. The score for each parameter was summed from
day 0 to the day of sacrifice, and the summed score was averaged to yield the final score. On
day 10 of the study, all mice were humanely euthanized with xylazine injection and CO2
inhalation.

Histological evaluation
Colon tissues were fixed in 10 % formaldehyde for 48 h, embedded in paraffin, cut into 4-μm
sections, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Histological scores are provided in

Table 2. Because DSS-related injury varies, two slides from each colon section were assessed
per mouse, and at least three areas on each slide were examined.

Immunofluorescence analysis
Immunofluorescence staining was performed using mouse monoclonal anti-Forkhead box (Fox)
P3 antibodies (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), as previously described [20]. The slides
were observed using an EVOS FL microscope (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Immunoreactive cells were counted in 20 random fields per section per mouse.

Statistical analysis
Differences between more than two groups were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA), and the differences between two groups were analyzed using Student’s t-tests. The
statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism Version 6.01 (GraphPad, Inc., La
Jolla, CA, USA).

Results
Characterization of cAT-MSC-EV
The characterization of stem cells used for these studies are described in detail in
supplementary figure 1. The EVs were separated from stem cell culture media by
ultracentrifugation. Schematic overview describing this protocol is presented in Figure 1A.
Approximately 100 µg of EVs was produced in the media in which 1  106 cells were seeded
and grown for 2 days (data not shown). Electron microscopic analysis demonstrated that the
EVs were round-shaped and 50–100 nm in diameter (Figure 1B). Using a particle-size analyzer,
the EVs were confirmed to be less than 100 nm in diameter (Figure 1C). In addition, positive
markers of EVs such as CD63 and CD9 were identified by western blotting, whereas negative
markers of EVs such as Lamin A (a nuclear marker) and beta actin (a cytosolic marker) were
present in lower abundance (Figure 1D). Whole-cell lysates were used as a positive control.
Our findings suggest that the EVs contained little or no cellular matrix and nuclei, which are
intracellular components.

Production of EVs containing less TSG-6 from stem cells
To reduce TSG-6 in EVs, cAT-MSCs were transfected with si-TSG-6. No differences were
observed in the cell viability and cell differentiation potentials between transfected and
untreated stem cells. Furthermore, the size and shape of the EVs secreted from the transfected
stem cells did not differ from those of the untreated stem cells, and no difference occurred in
the amount of EVs produced (Additional Figure 1). Further, the TSG-6 mRNA levels in the
transfected cAT-MSCs were reduced by over 50 % (Figure 2A), while the TSG-6 protein levels

in the EVs were reduced to less than half of those in the naïve and control siRNA-treated groups
(Figure 2B).

IP administration of cAT-MSC-EVs containing TSG-6 played a crucial role in alleviating IBD
Administration of EV significantly improved clinical parameters of IBD patients, such as body
weight (Figure 3A). Overall, the DAI (disease activity index; considering body weight, stool
consistency, bloody diarrhea and general activity) improved in the EV group (Figure 3B).
Moreover, shortening of the colon length significantly improved in the EV group compared
with that in the PBS-treated group (Figure 3C). The EV group showed greatly decreased
histological colitis scores for mucosal thickness, mucosal hyperplasia, extent of inflammation,
and crypt damage. In addition, the anti-inflammatory effect of CTL-EV was similar to that of
naive-EV, whereas the effect of TSG-6-depleted EV was insignificantly decreased. (Figure 3D).
Collectively, these results indicate that EV administration alleviated DSS-induced colitis and
indicate that TSG-6 in EV played a role in relieving colitis.

TSG-6 in cAT-MSC-EV modulate pro- and anti- inflammatory cytokine inflamed colon
The colon of EV-treated mice showed reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ,
IL-1β and IL-6) and elevated levels of an anti-inflammatory/regulatory cytokine (IL-10),
compared to that of untreated mice with colitis and TSG-6-depleted EV-treated mice (Figure
4). These results indicate that EV markedly attenuated the inflammatory state in mice with
induced colitis and suggest that TSG-6 in EV played an important role in relieving
inflammatory conditions.

TSG-6 was a major factor in increasing Tregs in Con A stimulated lymphocytes In vitro
The expression levels of CD4, and CD25 mRNA in lymphocytes derived canine PBMCs were
assessed to determine whether TSG-6 in EVs affected Treg activation. Con A, a
mannose/glucose-binding lectin, is a well-known T cell mitogen that can activate the immune
system, recruit lymphocytes, and elicit cytokine production. Therefore, lymphocytes were
stimulated with Con A to confirm the immune cell-control function of EVs. We found that
CD4, CD25 mRNA expression levels increased in the EV group, but decreased in the TSG-6
depleted EV group (Figure 5A). Additionally, the protein levels of IL-10 were measured in the
lymphocyte cultured medium. The EV group showed increased IL-10 expression, whereas the
TSG-6-depleted EV group showed decreased IL-10 expression (Figure 5B). In addition, to
determine whether the increased number of Tregs among total T cells was associated with
TSG-6 in the EVs, the degree of Treg activation was confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell
sorting. Accordingly, the number of FOXP+ cells among CD3+ cells increased in the EV group.
However, in the TSG-6-depleted EV group, the proportion of FOXP+ cells decreased (Figure
5C). These results demonstrate that the immunomodulatory effects of EV were related to TSG6.

TSG-6 in EV induced phenotypic enhancement of Tregs in inflamed colon
The FOXP3, CD4, and CD25 mRNA levels were evaluated to examine whether stem cell EVs
affected the activation of Tregs in the inflamed colon. FOXP3, CD4, and CD25 mRNA levels
increased in the EV group. However, their levels decreased in the TSG-6-depleted EV group

(Figure 6A). To determine whether the increase in the number of Tregs was associated with
TSG-6 in the EVs, quantitative analysis of FOXP3+ cells detected in colon tissue sections by
immunofluorescence showed that the percentage of these cells increased significantly in the
cAT-MSC-EV group compared to that in the PBS group. However, the enhancement of the
number of FOXP3+ cells in the EVs of the colon tissue decreased when TSG-6 was inhibited
(Figure 6B).

Discussion
Our data suggests the following important points: (1) TSG-6 in the stem cell derived EVs is a
key factor in immune regulation and relieving inflammation in the DSS-induced mouse model
of colitis. (2) TSG-6 in EVs alleviates inflammation by enhancing colonic Tregs in an IBD
mouse model.
Previous studies have shown that stem cells affect recipient cells in a paracrine manner,
considering that EVs largely account for the paracrine effect of stem cells [3, 21, 22]. In our,
preliminary study, the immune regulatory capacity of stem cells was significantly decreased
when GW4869 (a noncompetitive neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) inhibitor; exosome
inhibitor) was applied to cAT-MSCs (supplementary figure 2). Moreover, EVs and stem cells
have similar immunomodulatory effects. These results suggested that EV can be used as a nextgeneration therapeutic agent as an alternative to stem cells for immune-mediated disease.
In addition, other studies have been reported to apply EVs as therapeutic agents in various
inflammatory disease models and EVs have also been shown to alleviate colonic inflammation
in DSS-induced IBD mouse models [3, 23]. However, although many studies have examined
the therapeutic effect of EVs, the mechanism by which they relieve colitis is not yet clear. In
this regard, it is noteworthy that this study demonstrated that TSG-6 in EVs is a major factor
in relieving colitis symptoms.
Furthermore, this study is valuable in that it clarifies the relationship between Tregs in the
colon and TSG-6 in EVs. Other studies have shown that immune cells play a role in controlling
inflammation in the colon [24]. Among these immune cells, Tregs have been described as
having important roles in regulating the pathogenesis of IBD [25, 26], and the balance between
Tregs and other T cells in the intestinal tract is known to influence IBD pathogenesis [27].

Thus, an effective way to treat IBD may be to increase in the number of Tregs. To a large
extent, FOXP3 amplifies and stabilizes the molecular features of Treg precursor cells, which
is beneficial for their function and maintenance, and attenuates features that are deleterious to
Treg functions [28]. FOXP3-expressing Tregs, which belong to a suppressive subset of CD4+
T cells, can regulate infection, tumor development, allergy, and autoimmunity [29]. It was
reported that FOXP3+ Tregs are lower in patients with IBD progression than in healthy controls.
It was also reported that an increase in the number of Tregs after treating IBD patients
correlated with relief of IBD symptoms [27]. In other words, increasing the number of Tregs
may serve as a method for treating IBD. In this study, we observed an increase in colonic Treg
as well as a decrease in inflammatory cytokines in EV-treated IBD mice. However, treatment
with TSG-6-depleted EVs did not reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines, nor did they increase
the number of Tregs. These results confirmed that TSG-6 in EVs play an important role in the
regulation of inflammatory cytokines and differentiation of Tregs in the inflamed colon.
Although proteins other than TSG-6, such as TGF-beta, IDO, PGE2, and NO, may also be
contributing to the protective effect of EVs in relieving inflammation[10], results of the current
study confirm that TSG-6-depleted EVs significantly reduce the immunoregulatory ability,
which clearly indicates that TSG-6 is a major factor in immune regulation and antiinflammatory action. Furthermore, the finding that TSG-6 in EVs plays an important role in
immune regulation will serve as evidence to support increasing the level of TSG-6 in EVs as a
strategy to develop EVs with enhanced immunomodulating properties.
Although EV-specific studies have not been conducted, other studies have shown that
pretreatment of stem cells with TNF-alpha (TNF-α) resulted in an increase in mRNA levels of
TSG-6 in stem cells as well as increased levels of TSG-6 protein in the culture medium [12,

30]. Further studies on pre-treated stem cell-derived EVs are needed.
This study is also an important basis for future transitional studies. Like human IBD, canine
idiopathic IBD is a commonly observed chronic IBD that occurs spontaneously with similar
multifocal etiology due to the interactions between abnormal host immune responses, and
genetic and environmental factors. Histological evaluation of intestinal biopsies reveals
extensive or multifocal inflammatory cell infiltration (most commonly lymphoid evolutive,
eosinophilic, and neutrophilic), with simultaneous changes in mucosal structures (e.g. villous
atrophy and fusion). In severe cases, intestinal protein loss, similar to in human disease, can be
observed [1, 31, 32]. This study has been carried out with EVs derived from canine cells and
is of great value in facilitating subsequent experiments in dogs. Therefore, evaluating the
efficacy of TSG-6 in EVs conducted in this study is valuable for applications in veterinary
medicine, particularly for intractable immune-mediated diseases such as IBD, however, much
of these finds may also be applicable to human IBD in the future.

Conclusion
We demonstrated that TSG-6 in EVs secreted from cAT-MSCs ameliorated DSS-induced
colitis in mice by enhancing the Treg population in the inflamed colon. Our findings provide
an insight to improve the current understanding of the role that EVs have in immunoregulation,
and serve as a foundation for applying EVs as a therapeutic agent in IBD.
