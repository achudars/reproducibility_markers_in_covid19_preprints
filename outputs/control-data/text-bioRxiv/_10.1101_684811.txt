Abstract
Experimental ocular hypertension induces senescence of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs)
that mimicks events occurring in human glaucoma. Senescence-related chromatin
remodeling leads to profound transcriptional changes including the upregulation of a
subset of genes that encode multiple proteins collectively referred to as the senescenceassociated secretory phenotype (SASP). Emerging evidence suggests that the presence
of these proinflammatory and matrix-degrading molecules has deleterious effects in a
variety of tissues. In the current study, we demonstrated in a transgenic mouse model
that early removal of senescent cells induced upon elevated intraocular pressure (IOP)
protects unaffected RGCs from senescence and apoptosis. Visual evoked potential (VEP)
analysis demonstrated that remaining RGCs are functional and that the treatment
protected visual functions. Finally, removal of endogenous senescent retinal cells after
IOP elevation by a treatment with senolytic drug dasatinib prevented loss of retinal
functions and cellular structure. Senolytic drugs may have the potential to mitigate the
deleterious impact of elevated IOP on RGC survival in glaucoma and other optic
neuropathies.

Introduction
Glaucoma is comprised of progressive optic neuropathies characterized by degeneration
of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and resulting changes in the optic nerve. It is a complex
disease where multiple genetic and environmental factors interact1,2. Two of the leading
risk factors, increased intraocular pressure (IOP) and age, are related to the extent and
rate of RGC loss. Although lowering IOP is the only approved and effective treatment for
slowing worsening of vision, many treated glaucoma patients continue to experience loss
of vision and some eventually become blind. Several findings suggest that age-related
physiological tissue changes contribute significantly to neurodegenerative defects that
cause result in the loss of vision.
Mammalian aging is a complex process where distinct molecular processes contribute to
age-related tissue dysfunction. It is notable that specific molecular processes underlying
RGC damage in aging eyes are poorly understood. While no single defect defines aging,
several lines of evidence suggest that activation of senescence is a vital contributor3.
In a mouse model of glaucoma/ischemic stress, we reported the effects of p16Ink4a on
RGC death2. Upon increased IOP, the expression of p16Ink4a was elevated, and this led
to enhanced senescence in RGCs and their death. Such changes most likely cause
further RGC death and directly cause loss of vision. In addition, the analysis of p16KO
mice suggested that lack of p16Ink4a gene protected RGCs from cell death caused by
elevated IOP2. Importantly, elevated expression of p16INK4a and senescence were both
detected in human glaucomatous eyes2. Therefore, for the first time, p16Ink4a was
implicated as a downstream integrator of diverse signals causing RGC aging and death,
both characteristics changes in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. Our findings were further

supported by a subsequent report showing that p16Ink4a was upregulated by TANK
Binding Kinase 1 (TBK1) a key regulator of neuroinflammation, immunity and autophagy
activity. TBK also caused RGC death in ischemic retina injury4. Of particular note, a
recent bioinformatic meta-analysis of a published set of genes associated with primary
open-angle glaucoma (POAG) pointed at senescence and inflammation as key factors in
RGC degeneration in glaucoma5.
Glaucoma remains relatively asymptomatic until it is severe, and the number of affected
individuals is much higher than the number diagnosed. Numerous clinical studies have
shown that lowering IOP slows the disease progression6,7. However, RGC and optic
nerve damage is not halted despite lowered IOP, and deterioration of vision progresses
in most treated patients. This suggests the possibility that an independent damaging
agent or process persists even after the original insult (elevated IOP) has been
ameliorated.
We hypothesized that early removal of senescent RGCs that secrete senescent
associated secretory proteins (SASP) could protect remaining RGCs from senescence
and death induced by IOP elevation. To test this hypothesis, we used an established
transgenic p16-3MR mouse model8 in which the systemic administration of the small
molecule ganciclovir (GCV) selectively kills p16INK4a-expressing cells. We show that the
early removal of p16Ink4+ cells has a strong protective effect on RGC survival and visual
function. We confirm the efficiency of the method by showing the reduced level of
p16INK4a expression and lower number of senescent β-galactosidase positive cells after
GCV treatment. Finally, we show that treatment of p16-3MR mice with a known senolytic

drug (dasatinib) has a similar protective effect on RGCs as compared to GCV treatment
in p16-3MR mice.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
All animal experiments were approved by the UC San Diego Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (IACUC) and adhered to the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals
in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. Adult p16-3MR8 or C57BL/6 mice (12-16 weeks old,
Jackson Labs) were housed in 20 ºC environment with standard (12 h light/dark) cycling,
food and water available ad libitum. For all experiments, an equal number of male and
female mice were used.
Drug treatment
The p16-3MR transgenic model (Figure 1A), in which the mice carry a trimodal reporter
protein (3MR) under the control of p16 regulatory region8 , allows potent selective removal
of senescent cells. The 3MR transgene encodes a fusion protein consisting of Renilla
luciferase, a monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) and herpes simplex virus
thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) which converts ganciclovir (GCV) into a toxic DNA chain
terminator to selectively kill HSV-TK expressing cells. The experimental group of animals
was treated by intraperitoneal (IP) administration of GCV (Sigma, 25mg/kg once a day)
or dasatinib (Sigma, 5mg/kg) after IOP elevation (see below), and a control group of mice
was sham-treated with PBS or vehicle (DMSO). Each mouse underwent unilateral
hydrostatic pressure-induced IOP elevation to 90 mm Hg, with the contralateral eye left
as an untreated control. The mice were IP injected intraperitonealy with GCV or dasatinib

at day 0 (IOP elevation day) and continued for four consecutive days (Figure 1B). At day
5, animals were euthanized, retinas were isolated and immunostained with anti-Brn3a
antibody to evaluate the number of RGCs. All drugs were prepared according to the UC
San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) standards. To ensure
a sterile environment, compounds were prepared under the tissue culture hood using
sterile PBS. The final solution was filtered through a 0.22um PES membrane just before
injection. Tips, tubes, and syringes were sterile.
Hydrostatic intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation
Animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine cocktail,
(100 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively), their eyes anesthetized with one drop of
proparacaine (0.5 %, Bausch-Lomb) and dilated with one drop of tropicamide (1 %, Alcon
Laboratories). Unilateral elevation of IOP was achieved by infusing Balanced Salt
Solution (Alcon Laboratories) into the anterior chamber of the eye through using an
intravenous (IV) infusion set. The level of IOP increase was determined by the height of
the saline bottles on the IV infusion set. Stable elevated IOP of 85-90mm Hg was
maintained for 60 minutes, and controlled by IOP measurements using a veterinary
rebound tonometer (Tonovet). Both eyes were lubricated throughout testing with an
ophthalmic lubricant gel (GenTeal, Alcon Laboratories). Animals recovered on a
Deltaphase isothermal pad (Braintree Scientific) until awake. The contralateral eye
without IOP elevation served as a healthy non-IOP control (CTRL).
Visual evoked potential (VEP)
VEP measurements were taken at five days post-IOP elevation. This protocol was
adapted from prior studies9. Mice were dark adapted for at least 12 hours before the

procedure. Animals were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and their eyes dilated as
above. The top of the mouse’s head was cleaned with an antiseptic solution. A scalpel
was used to incise the scalp skin, and a metal electrode was inserted into the primary
visual cortex through the skull, 0.8 mm deep from the cranial surface, 2.3 mm lateral to
the lambda. A platinum subdermal needle (Grass Telefactor) was inserted through the
animal’s mouth as a reference, and through the tail as ground. The measurements
commenced when the baseline waveform became stable, 10-15 s after attaching the
electrodes. Flashes of light at 2 log cd.s/m2 were delivered through a full-field Ganzfeld
bowl at 2 Hz. Signal was amplified, digitally processed by the software (Veris
Instruments), then exported and peak-to-peak responses were analyzed in Excel
(Microsoft). To isolate VEP of the measured eye from the crossed signal originating in the
contralateral eye, a black aluminum foil eyepatch was placed over the eye not undergoing
measurement. For each eye, peak-to-peak response amplitude of the major component
N1 in IOP eyes was compared to that of their contralateral non-IOP controls. Following
the readings, the animals were euthanized, and their eyes collected and processed for
immunohistological analysis.
Immunohistochemistry
Following euthanasia, eyes were enucleated and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in
PBS (Affymetrix) for 1 hour and subsequently transferred to PBS. The eyes were then
dissected, the retinas flat-mounted on microscope slides, and immunostained using a
standard sandwich assay with anti-Brn3a antibodies (Millipore, MAB1595) and secondary
AlexaFluor 555 Anti-mouse (Invitrogen, A32727). Mounted samples (Fluoromount,
Southern Biotech 0100-01) were imaged in the fluorescent microscope at 20x

magnification (Biorevo BZ-X700, Keyence), focusing on the central retina surrounding the
optic nerve. Overall damage and retina morphology were also taken into consideration
for optimal assessment of the retina integrity. Micrographs were quantified using
manufacturer software for Brn3a-positive cells in 6 independent 350 µm x 350 µm areas
per flat-mount.
Real-Time PCR
Total RNA extraction from mouse tissues, cDNA synthesis, and RT-qPCR experiments
were performed as previously described2. Assays were performed in triplicate. Relative
mRNA levels were calculated by normalizing results using GAPDH. The primers used for
RT-qPCR are the same as in2. The differences in quantitative PCR data were analyzed
with an independent two-sample t-test.
SA-βgal Assay to Test Senescence on Retinas Mouse Eyes
Senescence assays were performed using the Senescence b-Galactosidase Staining Kit
(Cell Signaling) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Images were acquired using a
Hamamatsu Nanozoomer 2.0HT Slide Scanner and quantified in independent images of
0.1 mm2 covering the areas of interest using Keyence software.

RESULTS
Intraocular pressure was increased in one eye of transgenic mice bearing the p16-3MR
construct (Figure 1A). After IOP elevation, mice were intraperitonealy injected with GCV
for five consecutive days (Figure 1B) to specifically deplete p16Ink4a-positive (p16+)
cells. In parallel, wild-type animals were subjected to the same protocol, i.e., underwent

immunohistochemistry and RGC quantification were used to assess potential impact of
drug treatment. We observed that five-day administration of GCV after IOP elevation had
a significant protective effect on Brn3a+ RGC number in p16-3MR mice when compared
to untreated eye (Figure 1C, D). This protection was not observed in WT animals (Figure
1E) confirming that the effect of the GCV injection is specific to the mice harboring the
GCV-sensitive transgene.
Next, to test whether the protection of RGC numbers in GCV treated retinas was
accompanied by the protection of the the visual circuit integrity on day five, the in vivo
signal transmission from the retina to the primary visual cortex was assessed by
measuring visual evoked potentials (VEP) (Figure 2A)10,11. In brief, the reading electrode
was placed in the striate visual cortex, with the reference electrode in the animal’s mouth
and ground electrode in the tail. Flash stimuli were presented in a Ganzfeld bowl.
Response amplitudes were quantified from the peak-to-peak analysis of the first negative
component N1. Using this approach, we have found that eyes subjected to IOP elevation
showed decreased VEP P1-N1 amplitude (Figure 2B), compared to contralateral nonIOP control eyes. However, there was a marked rescue of VEP signals in transgenic
animals treated with GCV (Figure 2B). Further quantification showed significant vision

rescue upon GCV treatment only in p16-3MR and not WT animals (Figure 2C, D);
confirming the specificity of GCV treatment.
Our previous studies indicated that the increase in p16INK4a expression could be first
observed as early as day three post-IOP elevation2. Therefore, we chose this time-point
to analyze the effectiveness of GCV treatment on senescent cells in treated and control
retinas of p16-3MR animals. RGC quantification showed that in animals not injected with
GCV only ~15-20% of cells disappeared at day 3 (compared to ~45-50% on day 5).
To test whether GCV treatment indeed removed senescent cells in the retina we used
two approaches. First, we quantified the p16Ink4a expression at day three post IOP
treatment in GCV treated and control retinas. Expectedly, GCV treatment prevented IOPinduced increase in p16Ink4a expression observed in non-treated eyes (Figure 3B).
Importantly, this was accompanied by significant decrease in numbers of IOP-induced βgalactosidase-positive senescent cells in 3-day GCV-treated retinas as compared to nontreated cells (Figure 3C, D). This indicates that IOP-induced early senescent cells are
efficiently removed by GCV-treatment by day 3, what precedes the RGC loss observed
in non-treated eyes between day 3 and day 5.
We next set forward on trying to understand molecular changes underlying the apparent
protective effect of the removal of senescent cells by GCV treatment in p16-3MR animals.
First, we performed time-course experiment in wild-type mice to follow the activation of
caspase expression as a marker of endogenous stress in the cell (Figure 4A). We
quantified both total number of RGC (by nuclear staining for RGC specific transcription
factor Brn3a) and activated caspase-positive cells (by phospho-caspase3 staining). The
highest number of RGCs with concomitant staining of activated caspase was observed

at day 3 after IOP elevation (Figure 4A right). As shown above, at day 3 most of the
RGCs are still present (Figure 3A). Day 3 also corresponds to the highest expression
levels of senescence associated factors, as previously observed2. We thus reasoned that
relevant effects of GCV treatment should be easy to observe at around this stage. To
identify potential differences in an unbiased way, we performed RNA-seq analysis in IOP
and non-IOP retinas with or without GCV treatment. Total RNA isolated from 3 retinas in
each experimental group was converted to cDNA libraries and sequenced. Of the total
21351 detected gene loci, 1601 were significantly de-regulated by the IOP treatment; 999
detected gene loci were up-regulated and 602 down-regulated (Figure 4B, top). When
the IOP treatment was performed in mice treated with GCV, the total numbers of IOPaffected genes changed modestly to 1707, with 848 up-regulated and 859 downregulated (Figure 4B, bottom).
To inquire in an unbiased way about the differences in signaling pathways and cellular
processes affected by IOP, GO analysis using PANTHER was performed12. This
approach revealed that processes of the immune system response, inflammation, and
extracellular matrix composition and cell-matrix interaction were significantly changed in
IOP samples (Table 1). We have also detected the significantly deregulated genes
involved in apoptosis, microglial activation and interlukin-6 and 8 production and
secretion. This analysis shows that many mechanisms are induced upon an acute IOP
elevation, most probably causing additional transcriptional stress to cell.
Further analysis revealed that the genes involved in cellular senescence, extracellular
matrix molecules and in factors involved in apoptosis (Table 2)13 were significantly deregulated upon IOP elevation. Importantly, 3-day treatment to remove p16+ cells

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/684811; this version posted November 12, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

significantly mitigated this response (Figure 4C). This data is in agreement with the loss
of the senescence cells upon GCV treatment (Figure 3B, C, D) and lower detrimental
impact of senescent cells on surrounding cells.
Additional GO analysis of the 617 genes which were significantly de-regulated upon IOP
elevation specifically in non-treated retinas (ie. genes where the effects of IOP were
dampened by GCV-mediated removal of senescent cells) (Figure 4D) identified a specific
enrichment of a class of genes belonging to the ABL1 pathway and ABL1 downstream
targets (Fig S1). Prompted by this finding, we explored whether dasatinib, a well known
senolytic drug and a Bcr-Abl and Src family threonine kinase inhibitor, could have a
beneficial effect similar to GCV in p16-3MR mice. To this end, p16-3MR mice were treated
with dasatinib (5mg/kg) or vehicle for 5 days by intraperitoneal injection, similarly to the
experimental procedure used for GCV (Figure 1B). Performing this experiment in the
transgenic mice allowed direct comparison of the efficiencies of both treatments in the
same mouse strain. At day five after IOP elevation, VEP measurement was performed
and retinas were immunostained to quantify RGC loss. We observed that dasatinib
treatment prevented the loss of RGC (Figure 5C) similar to what was observed in GCV
treated animals (Figure 1E). Most importantly, VEP analysis revealed that senolytic drug
treatment successfully prevented vision loss upon IOP elevation (Figure 5D).
Finally, we explored whether the protective impact of the drug is caused by the sustained
inhibition of the cellular processes and whether it is maintained even after the drug is no
longer present. To do that, p16-3MR mice were treated with dasatinib (5mg/kg) or vehicle
for 5 days by intraperitoneal injection, similarly to the experimental procedure used for
GCV (Figure 1B). After that, the mice were no longer treated with drug or PBS and at

day twelve after IOP elevation, functional measurement was performed and RGCs were
quantified. Also in this treatment regime, dasatinib prevented the loss of RGC (Figure
5C) similar to what was observed in GCV treated animals (Figure 1E). Additionally, VEP
analysis revealed that senolytic drug treatment with seven days “chase” still successfully
prevented vision loss upon IOP elevation (Figure 5D).
DISCUSSION
The collective findings of the current study strongly support the notion that removal of
senescent cells provides beneficial protective effect to retinas damaged by elevated IOP.
Here, we show that in transgenic animals expressing viral TK under the control of
regulatory regions of p16Ink4a8, selective removal of early senescent cells in the retina
is beneficial for neighboring cells undergoing cellular stress induced by IOP elevation. In
this model, the treatment with GCV selectively induces cell death of transgene-expressing
cells. Early application of GCV as soon as day 0 after the IOP elevation and followed for
five consecutive days ensures early removal of p16Ink4a expressing cells resulting in
protection of neighboring RGCs from death. Remaining cells are still able to provide a
signal to the visual cortex, as evidenced by VEP measurements, demonstrating that
protected cells are functional.
Three days after GCV injection there is a significant drop in senescent cell number and
an accompanying alteration of the transcriptional programs in remaining cells as
compared to retinas from untreated mice. Using an RNA-seq approach, we noted
significant changes in the senescence program as well as in the extracellular matrix
(ECM) function. Both pathways are downregulated by GCV treatment. Finally, we show
that dasatinib, a known senolytic drug, can be used to protect RGCs from death, further

confirming that early removal of senescent cells induced upon IOP elevation protects
retina health. The observation also was confirmed when the RGC count and VEP were
assessed seven days after the treatment was stopped; this suggests that the impact of
the drug is not reversible during this time. Further studies should investigate different
regimes and dosages of the senolytic drugs and their neuroprotective role.
Taken together, the results prompt us to propose a model of how increased IOP leads to
the destrucion of retinal structures during glaucoma progression (Figure 5E). During early
stages, elevated IOP induces cell-intrinsic changes leading to cellular senescence and
production of SASP. As the disease worsens, SASP molecules induce apoptosis and
senescence in neighboring cells. Such changes are largely independent of whether the
initial insult is still present or has been eliminated with IOP-lowering treatment. RGC
apoptosis inevitably leads to the loss of axons and optic nerve degeneration. Conversely,
when senescent cells (induced directly by elevated IOP) are removed using senolytic
drugs (Figure 5E, bottom), neighboring cells are not exposed to detrimental SASP and
remain healthy. We propose that such treatment can lead reduce the rate of glaucoma
worsening. Moreover, we speculate that changes in combination with IOP-lowering
treatments may have even better protection than either type of therapy alone.
We and others previously used 90 mm Hg as an extremely acute and reproducible way
to induce cell response and RGC death2. This level of pressure is likely an ischemic insult.
The resulting synchronized and quick cell death provide unique qualities that are
extremely useful for molecular and biochemical studies, however such an acute and high
pressure change is not fully representative of POAG, a chronic optic neuropathy.
However, this acute insult allows the study of stress response time course and can help

unravel important aspects of stepwise response of retinal cells to elevated IOP which is
a daunting task to assess in chronic models the disease. Importantly, our previous data
showing the presence of senescent cells in human glaucomatous retinas2 should
stimulate the use of senolytic drugs in other animal models of glaucoma.
Dasatinib is a selective tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor that is commonly used in the
therapy of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Other studies have shown that
treatment with dasatinib is effective in destroying senescent fat cell precursors14. Our
RNA-seq data pointed to this senolytic drug as a potential candidate for in-vivo treatment
of retinal damage induced by IOP elevation. Notably, we found that the level of RGC
protection resembles the one obtained with GCV treatment of p16-3MR transgenic line.
Based on these findings, we conclude that dasatinib treatment resulted in RGC protection
through removal of senescent cells. It will be of interest to further investigate the possible
therapeutic effects of other senolytic drugs in glaucoma and glaucoma models.
The gene encoding p16INK4a, CDKN2A, lies within the INK4/ARF tumor suppressor
locus on human chromosome 9p21; this is the most significant region to be identified as
having an association with POAG in different population samples15. Although the
molecular mechanism of many of these associations is yet to be described, we have
shown that one of them especially highly correlates with the presence of another top risk
variant of glaucoma – Six6 rs33912345. Our study further showed that upregulation of
homozygous SIX6 risk alleles (CC) leads to an increase in p16Inka expression, with
subsequent cellular senescence2. Interestingly, others have described an alternative
mechanism whereby IOP induced TBK1 expression caused an increase of p16Ink4a
expression through the Akt- Bmi1 phosphorylation pathway4. Given the complexity of the

9p21 locus, we believe that there are more pathways involved in p16Ink4a regulation and
further work is needed to understand the role of p16Ink4a as a integrator of these signals
especially upon IOP elevation.
Several collaborative efforts identified numerous SNPs localized within the 9p21 locus to
be highly associated with the risk of open-angle glaucoma including Normal-Tension
Glaucoma (NTG), a glaucomatous optic neuropathy not associated with elevated IOP16,17.
Intriguingly, one of the top variants associated with the risk of NTG is located in the gene
TBK1, a factor that has been recently shown to be implicated in upregulation of p16ink4a
gene4. Finally, recent studies have also revealed that specific methylation patterns in the
9p21 locus are strongly associated with the risk of NTG glaucoma18. It is notable that the
positions of most, if not all, of these SNPs and methylation markers, overlap with active
regulatory regions within the locus identified by ENCODE19. Although regulation of the
9p21 locus in the context of many diseases and aging is under extensive investigation, it
still remains to be explicitly addressed in relation to glaucoma.
Another major type of glaucomatous optic neuropathy is angle closure glaucoma (ACG),
a condition characterized by blockage of the drainage angle of the eye. To date, there is
no study reporting genetic variants or methylation markers in the 9p21 locus significantly
associated with the risk of ACG despite several studies implicating various molecular
mechanisms

20.

Nevertheless, the fact that progressive vision loss is observed in PACG

patients, even after lowering the IOP21, raises the question whether an association could
be observed between 9p21 markers and the progression rather than the risk of the
disease. Further studies to unravel such associations are necessary.

Markers of cellular senescence such as expression of the p16Ink4a and SASP molecules
dramatically increase during aging in both humans and mice. Several studies suggest
that p16Ink4a+ cells act to shorten healthy lifespan by promoting age-dependent changes
that functionally impair tissues and organs22-25. Intriguingly, a recent explosion of studies
has shown that removal of senescent cells using senolytic drugs in progeroid (accelerated
aging phenotype) and healthy mice induces lifespan extension and improves the health
of animals22,26-28. Our studies suggest a potential use of such therapy to reduce glaucoma
associated blindness, either as a stand-alone treatment or together with IOP-lowering
therapies.

FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 1. Removal of early senescent cells has a neuroprotective effect on RGCs.
A. Schematic representation of the p16-3MR transgene. Triple fusion of luciferase, the
red fluorescent protein and tyrosine kinase from HSV virus are under control of the
regulatory region of p16Ink4a gene. B. Plan of the experiment. After unilateral IOP
elevation mice are daily injected with GCV (25 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. At day 5 VEP is
measured, and tissue is collected for further experiments. C. Representative images of
retina flat mount immunohistochemistry at day five with anti-Brn3a antibody specifically
labeling ~80% of RGC cells. D. Quantification of RGC number at day five after the
treatment of WT animals. N>=5 animals in each group E. Quantification of RGC number

A.

Immunohistochemistry of Brn3a and activated caspase show increase of apoptosis at
day1, 2 and 3 after IOP treatment. left: quantification of the time-course experiments
followed by immunochemistry with Brn3a and activated caspase 3; B, RNA-seq analysis
of response to IOP and GCV. Eyes subjected to IOP elevation show significant change
in gene expression with more genes upregulated than downregulated. Similar analysis in
GCV treated animals shows close to equal distribution of upregulated and downregulated
genes C. Heatmap analysis of genes involved in senescence, active oxidative species
(ROS), apoptosis, extracellular matrix homeostasis (ECM) and inflammation. D. Venn
diagram showing overlap between genes dysregulated upon IOP in GCV treated and
untreated retinas. 617 genes specifically dysregulated in IOP only retinas were used for
GO analysis.
Figure 5. Dasatinib protects retina degeneration. A. plan of the experiment. After
unilateral IOP elevation mice are daily injected with dasatinib (5 mg/kg) intraperitoneally.
At day 5 VEP is measured and tissue is collected for further experiments.
Immunohistochemistry of Brn3a and activated caspase show increase of apoptosis at day
3 after IOP treatment. B, Retina flat mount immunohistochemistry at day 5 with antiBrin3a antibody specifically labelling ~80% of RGC cells. C.D. Quantification of RGC
number (C) or VEP responses (D) at day 5 (four conditions) or day 12 (additional 7 days
of “recovery”, two conditions) after the 5d ay treatment of p16-3MR animals with dasatinib.
N>4 animals in each group . Statistical tests were performed using ANOVA with post-hoc
Tukey correction for multiple testing. * p<0.05, *** p<0.001, n.s. – not significant E. Model.
Top: Upon elevated IOP damaged cells become senescent and start to express SASP
molecules. While disease progresses the SASP molecule induce senescence or
apoptosis in neighboring cells. Bottom: When senescent cells are removed using
senolytic drug the neighboring cells are not exposed to detrimental SASPs and the
disease progression is significantly slowed down. Remaining cells are healthy.
