Abstract
The genus Lactobacillus is known to be extremely diverse and consists of different
phylogenetic groups that show a diversity roughly equal to the expected diversity of a
typical bacterial genus. One of the most prominent phylogenetic groups within this
genus is the Lactobacillus plantarum group which contains the understudied
Lactobacillus mudanjiangensis species. Before this study, only one L. mudanjiangensis
strain, DSM 28402T , was described but without whole-genome analysis. In this study,
three strains classified as L. mudanjiangensis, were isolated from three different carrot
juice fermentations and their whole-genome sequence was determined, together with the
genome sequence of the type strain. The genomes of all four strains were compared with
publicly available L. plantarum group genome sequences. This analysis showed that L.
mudanjiangensis harbored the second largest genome size and gene count of the whole
L. plantarum group. In addition, all members of this species showed the presence of a
gene coding for a putative cellulose-degrading enzyme. Finally, three of the four L.
mudanjiangensis strains studied showed the presence of pili on scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images, which were linked to conjugative gene regions, coded on
plasmids in at least two of the strains studied.

Author summary
Lactobacillus mudanjiangensis is an understudied species within the Lactobacillus
plantarum group. Since its first description, no other studies have reported its isolation.
Here, we present the first four genome sequences of this species, which include the
genome sequence of the type strain and three new L. mudanjiangensis strains isolated
from fermented carrot juice. The genomes of all four strains were compared with
publicly available L. plantarum group genome sequences. We found that this species

harbored the second largest genome size and gene count of the whole L. plantarum
group. Furthermore, we present the first scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of
L. mudanjiangensis, which showed the formation of pili in three strains that we linked
to genes related to conjugation. Finally, we found the presence of a unique putative

Introduction

1

The genus Lactobacillus is known to be extremely diverse [1]. Furthermore, it has been
shown that different phylogenetic groups within this genus display a diversity roughly
equal to the expected diversity of a typical bacterial genus [2–6]. Each of these
phylogenetic groups can be recognized as an entity with unique properties and a distinct
natural history, ecology, function and physiology [5]. Therefore, the study of these
phylogenetic groups separately, as if they would be one genus, can be an interesting
approach that might reveal new, previously overlooked, phylogenetic relationships and
functional properties.
One of the more abundantly studied species within the genus Lactobacillus, is
Lactobacillus plantarum. Previous genome-based phylogenetic studies have defined L.
plantarum as a member of the L. plantarum group together with Lactobacillus
fabifermentans, Lactobacillus paraplantarum, Lactobacillus pentosus and Lactobacillus
xiangfangensis [1, 7]. In addition, the species Lactobacillus herbarum [8], Lactobacillus
plajomi [9], Lactobacillus modestisalitolerans [9] and Lactobacillus mudanjiangensis [10]
are closely related to L. plantarum and thus should be regarded as members of the L.
plantarum group. Lactobacillus mudanjiangensis is a species that has been described for
the first time in 2013 and that was isolated from a traditional pickle fermentation in the
Heilongjiang province in China [10]. Since its first description, no other study has
provided additional characterization or reported the isolation of other strains of the L.
mudanjiangensis species. Therefore, currently, not a single genomic assembly of this
species is publicly available. However, in in this study, four strains isolated from three
different spontaneous carrot juice fermentations [11], were putatively classified as
members of this Lactobacillus species.
Since the discovery of the mucus-binding pili, the fimbriae or adhesins, in
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG [12, 13], several comparative genomic studies have focused
on exploring similar gene clusters in other lactobacilli, including the members of the L.
plantarum group [1, 14–18]. Whereas these specific pili play an important role in cell
surface adhesion, pili can be of importance for an array of other functions as well,
ranging from biofilm formation to uptake of extracellular DNA via natural competence
(type IV pili) or facilitation of DNA transfer via conjugation [19–21]. The latter is a
process that uses conjugative pili to bring bacterial cells together and provide an
interface to exchange macromolecules, such as DNA or DNA-protein complexes [20]. In
general, such a conjugation system consists of three major components, namely (i) a
relaxase (MOB) that will bind and knick the DNA at the origin of replication, (ii) a
coupling protein (T4CP) that will couple the relaxase-DNA complex to (iii) a type IV
secretion system (T4SS), which ultimately transfers the whole complex to the recipient
cell [22–25]. Historically, these conjugation systems and their pili have been associated
with conjugative plasmids only [23], one of the main drivers of horizontal gene
transfer [22, 26]. However, recently, also integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs),
which harbor conjugation systems as well, have been found to be another important
driver of horizontal gene transfer [26–28].
This study aimed to provide more insights into the genomic features of the
understudied Lactobacillus mudanjiangensis species, in relation to the other members of

the L. plantarum group, using a comparative genomics approach. Therefore, the
genome of the type strain of L. mudanjiangensis was sequenced together with three
strains isolated from fermented carrot juice. These and other publicly available genome
sequences were used to screen for L. mudanjiangensis species-specific properties, which
included an analysis for the presence of genes related to pili formation and conjugation.
In total, 304 genomes were subjected to an in-depth analysis focusing on the
phylogenetic relationships as well as the predicted functional capacity of these strains.

The genome assembly of the type strain L. mudanjiangensis DSM 28402T was analyzed
together with the genome sequences of three putative L. mudanjiangensis strains
isolated from carrot juice fermentations, namely AMBF197, AMBF209 and AMBF249,
to confirm their putative classification as L. mudanjiangensis members. Furthermore,
to allow comparison with other closely related Lactobacillus species and detection of L.
mudanjiangensis species-specific properties, all publicly available genome sequences
(NCBI Assembly database, 24/07/2018) of L. plantarum group members were included
in this comparative genomics study, totaling the number of genomes analyzed to 304
(Table 1).

Phylogeny of the Lactobacillus plantarum group

62

To obtain a detailed view on the phylogeny of L. mudanjiangensis in relationship to the
whole L. plantarum group, a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed,
based on 612 single-copy core orthogroups, found with Orthofinder (Fig1 and S1 Fig).
The resulting topology of this tree showed seven major clades, mostly following the
species annotation as described in the NCBI Assembly database. However, these results
exposed a few wrongly annotated genomic assemblies. For example, both L. plantarum
MPL16 and L. plantarum AY01 were annotated as L. plantarum before, whereas here,
they were found within a clade that contained the L. paraplantarum type strain.
Similarly, L. plantarum EGD-AQ4 was found within the clade of the L. pentosus type
strain, whereas it was annotated as L. plantarum before.
The type strain of L. mudanjiangensis formed a separate clade together with the
strains AMBF197, AMBF209 and AMBF249 (Fig1). Based on its single-copy core
orthogroups, this species was phylogenetically the most distant to L. plantarum,
whereas its closest relative was L. fabifermentans, followed by L. xiangfangensis.

Fig 1. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the Lactobacillus
plantarum group. The tree is based on the amino acid sequences of 612 single-copy
marker genes. Lactobacillus algidus DSM 15638 was used as an outgroup. The tree was
pruned to only keep 70 L. plantarum strains to avoid over-plotting. A complete tree can
be found in the Appendix (S1 Fig). The branch length of the outgroup was shortened
for better visualization. Each tip is colored, based on its species name as annotated in
the NCBI Assembly database (where applicable), with dark blue for L. plantarum, light
green for Lactobacillus paraplantarum, light blue for Lactobacillus pentosus, pink for
Lactobacillus herbarum, light orange for Lactobacillus xiangfangensis, dark orange for
Lactobacillus mudanjiangensis and red for the isolates obtained from the carrot juice
fermentations. Type strains of each species are annotated with a triangle (NCBI) or a
square (sequenced in this study).

Low intraclade ANI values for Lactobacillus pentosus and
Lactobacillus plantarum

77
78

To confirm that each major phylogenetic clade represented at least one different species,
the pairwise average nucleotide identity (ANI) values of all genome assemblies were
calculated (Fig2). Intraclade ANI values all exceeded the commonly used 95% species
level threshold [34] for L. mudanjiangensis (99.0-99.4%), L. fabifermentans (99.7-99.9%)
and L. paraplantarum (99.7-99.9%), whereas their interclade ANI values were far below
this threshold, showing that these clades all represented a single species. However, this
was not the case for L. pentosus, for which multiple pairwise comparisons led to
intraclade ANI values below this threshold, suggesting that this phylogenetic clade
contained at least two species (Fig2 and S2 Fig). This result was also found for some L.
plantarum assemblies, although to a much lesser extent, compared to L. pentosus.
Therefore, it was decided that, for subsequent analyses, L. plantarum was kept as one
species, whereas L. pentosus was split into two groups, each representing one species.
One species was designated as species L. pentosus, represented by a clade containing
twelve genomic assemblies, including the type strain L. pentosus DSM 20314T . The
other species, here referred to as clade 5a, was represented by two genomic assemblies
(L. pentosus KCA1 and L. plantarum EGD-AQ4) (Figures 1 and S2 Fig). Finally, for L.
xiangfangensis and L. herbarum, no intraclade comparisons could be performed, as only
one genome assembly was available for these species.

Genomic features of Lactobacillus mudanjiangensis

97

The above results confirmed the initial that strains AMBF197, AMBF209 and
AMBF249 were members of the L. mudanjiangensis species. Therefore, here, the first
four genomes of this species were presented. Their genome size varied between 3.4 Mb
(strain DSM 28402T ) and 3.6 Mb (strain AMBF209), whereas their GC content varied
between 42.73% (strain AMBF209) and 43.06% (strain DSM 28402T ) (Table 2). Finally,
a high number of transfer RNA (tRNA) genes were found in all four strains.
A substantial difference in total genome length between the different species of the L.
plantarum group was found (Fig3A). Lactobacillus mudanjiangensis showed a median

estimated genome size of 3.53 Mb, the second largest of the whole L. plantarum group
up to now. Lactobacillus pentosus showed the largest median estimated genome size
(3.77 Mb), followed by L. mudanjiangensis (3.53 Mb) and L. fabifermentans (3.43 Mb),
whereas for L. xiangfangensis (3.0 Mb) and L. herbarum (2.9 Mb) this size was much
smaller. A remarkable high spread in genome length was found within strains belonging
to the L. plantarum species, as their genome size ranged between 2.9 Mb and 3.8 Mb.
Furthermore, L. mudanjiangensis showed a GC content of 42.9%, the lowest value
within the whole L. plantarum group (Fig3B). Finally, regarding median gene count,
similar trends were found as for the genome length, with L. pentosus showing the
highest count, followed by L. mudanjiangensis and L. fabifermentans, whereas L.
xiangfangensis and L. herbarum harbored the lowest numbers of genes (Fig3C).

classification. Uniquely shared orthogroups between L. mudanjiangensis and one other
L. plantarum group member are colored in orange, whereas uniquely shared orthogroups
between L. mudanjiangensis and two other species are colored in red.
In total, 947,588 genes were found in the whole L. plantarum group, with an average
of 3,110 genes per genome. These genes were further clustered into 8,005 different
orthogroups, leading to an average count of 2,924 orthogroups per genome. The
differences between these numbers was due to the fact that some genes were found in
multiple copies within one genome, which clustered together in a single orthogroup. Of
all these orthogroups, 2,172 were defined as core orthogroups and 5,833 as accessory
orthogroups (see Sections 1.2.2 and 4.2.3 for the definition of these terms). A detailed
overview of the number of genes and core and accessory orthogroups can be found in S2
Table. Subsequently, the distribution of orthogroups between the different L. plantarum
group members was explored (Fig3D). The species with the highest number of
species-specific orthogroups was L. plantarum. With 2,065 species-specific orthogroups,
it greatly outnumbered all other species, although this number was most probably
biased, due to the higher number of sequenced genomes available for L. plantarum
compared with the other L. plantarum group species. It was followed by L.
mudanjiangensis (Fig3D, blue) that contained 372 species-specific orthogroups and L.
fabifermentans harboring 213 species-specific orthogroups. Furthermore, L. plantarum
and L. pentosus shared the highest number of uniquely shared orthogroups (286),
followed by the combination of L. plantarum and L. paraplantarum (219 uniquely
shared orthogroups), which seemed to be in line with the phylogeny described in Fig1.
In contrast, L. mudanjiangensis shared more unique orthogroups with the
phylogenetically distant L. plantarum (166 orthogroups; Fig3D, yellow) than it did with
the most closely related species, L. fabifermentans (59 orthogroups).

species-specific orthogroups were further classified using the EggNOG database (inset
Fig3D). However, this resulted in a vast majority of orthogroups (304), classified under
‘Category S: Function unkown’, showing that further experimental work on functional
gene validation is necessary. Besides this, most orthogroups belonged to category G
(carbohydrate transport and metabolism, 14 orthogroups), followed by category M (cell
wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis, 13 orthogroups).

Carbohydrate transport and metabolism (category G) was found to be the most
abundantly characterized category among the L. mudanjiangensis species-specific
orthogroups. Further examination of the 14 unique orthogroups that were detected in
this category, revealed the presence of a gene in all four strains annotated as
endoglucanase E1, which is involved in the conversion of cellulose polymers into simple
saccharides [35]. A BLAST search of the DNA sequences of this gene to the NCBI nt
database showed a best scoring hit (26% coverage and 69% identity) with a member of
the Herbinix species (GenBank accession number LN879430). The Herbinix genus
contains cellulose-degrading bacteria [36]. This result also showed that this gene was
not found in any other member of the Lactobacillus Genus Complex (LGC), or any
other LAB, and confirmed its uniqueness to L. mudanjiangensis. Since endoglucanases
are classified as glycosyl hydrolases (GHs), GHs were predicted for all genomes. Indeed,
for all four L. mudanjiangensis strains, this endoglucanase E1 gene was classified as
belonging to the GH5 1 family, which was a family uniquely found in L.
mudanjiangensis. Although this GH family showed some degree of polyspecificity, the
majority of enzymes (22 of 24 enzymes characterized) are reported as
endoglucanases [37]. Together, these results thus pointed towards the presence of a
novel putative cellulose-degrading enzyme in all four L. mudanjiangensis strains.

The second most abundant category of L. mudanjiangensis-specific orthogroups,
excluding category S (function unknown), were genes related to ‘cell wall, membrane, or
envelope biogenesis‘ (category M). Examination of the annotation of the genes
belonging to these orthogroups did not reveal any new insights, as many of them were
annotated as hypothetical proteins. Therefore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was
performed to screen the cell surfaces of these four strains in more detail. This analysis
revealed that three of the four strains (L. mudanjiangensis DSM28402T , AMBF209 and
AMBF249) formed pili or fimbriae, connecting different cells to each other as well as
cells to an undefined structure (Fig4A).

phenotypes. These included the spaCBA gene cluster, which has been linked with
probiotic properties in L. rhamnosus, due to better adhesion to intestinal epithelial
cells [38, 39], as well as secretion systems based on pili, such as the type II and type IV
secretion systems [25, 40]. In this study, no spaCBA gene cluster was found. However,
further exploration revealed the presence of a conjugation system in at least three of the
four L. mudanjiangensis strains examined (AMBF209, AMBF249 and DSM 28402T ).
Two complete conjugation systems containing all three mandatory parts (Fig4C)
were found in L. mudanjiangensis AMBF209 and AMBF249, whereas one complete
conjugation system was found in L. mudanjiangensis DSM 28402T (Fig4B). For all four
L. mudanjiangensis strains, the relaxase gene of this conjugation system was classified
as a member of the MOBQ class, whereas the coupling protein was classified as a
T4CP2. The MPF system, which harbored the putative pilus, was further classified as
belonging to the class MPFFATA , which groups the MPF systems of Gram-positive
bacteria [24]. VirB4 was identified as the ATPase motor of this MPF system.
Furthermore, this MPF system contained three accessory genes (trsC, trsD and trsJ ) in
L. mudanjiangensis AMBF209 and AMBF249, whereas four accessory genes were
annotated in L. mudanjiangensis DSM 28402T (trsC, trsD, trsF and trsJ ) (Fig4B).
Homologs for the genes trsC and trsD were already previously identified, with trsC
coding for a VirB3 homolog, which is linked to the formation of the membrane pore,
and trsD coding for another homolog of VirB4, the conjugation ATPase [24]. In
contrast, both trsF and trsJ are poorly characterized.
Further analysis of the genes surrounding the annotated conjugation genes showed
that this genomic region contained 18 to 19 open reading frames, most of them
annotated as hypothetical proteins (Fig4B and S3 Table). However, a bacteriophage
peptidoglycan hydrolase domain was found in orthogroup OG0002812 in both L.
mudanjiangensis AMBF209 conjugation region 1 (AMBF209 CR1) and L.
mudanjiangensis AMBF249 conjugation region 2 (AMBF249 CR2), making it a
VirB1-like protein [41]. In Agrobacterium tumefaciens, the VirB1 protein provides
localized lysis of the peptidoglycan cell wall to allow insertion of the T4SS [42]. A
similar domain, also known to harbor peptidoglycan lytic activity, was found in L.
mudanjiangensis DSM28402 CR1 (orthogroup OG0002812). Finally, another conserved
domain was found in all five gene regions clustered in orthogroup OG0003012,
annotated as T4SS CagC, which was shown to be a VirB2 homolog. VirB2 is the major
pilus component of the type IV secretion system of A. tumefaciens, which is the main
building block for extension and retraction of the conjugative pilus [43–45]. Taken
together, these results showed the presence of pili in three L. mudanjiangensis strains
(AMBF209, AMBF249 and DSM 28402T ), which after genomic analysis were
hypothesized to be part of a conjugation system.
Finally, genome analysis of all other L. plantarum group members showed that, in
contrast to an initial belief, the presence of a complete conjugation system was not
unique to L. mudanjiangensis (S1 Table). All three necessary genes were also found in
58 of 275 L. plantarum strains, two of seven L. paraplantarum strains and four of twelve
L. pentosus strains. In contrast, the system was completely absent in clade5a, L.
herbarum, L. xiangfangensis and L. fabifermentans.

Many conjugation systems are coded on plasmids [27]. Therefore, all four L.
mudanjiangensis genomes were screened for plasmid presence using Recycler [46].
Plasmids were only found in two of four genome assemblies, namely L. mudanjiangensis
AMBF209 and AMBF249 (Fig5). Both strains harbored a plasmid of 27.3 Kb with 33
predicted genes, which after pairwise alignment of the plasmid were foun to be exactly
the same. Subsequently, the presence of a conjugation system on these plasmids was

confirmed using CONJScan. Further examination showed that the plasmid exactly
matched the above described AMBF209 CR2 and AMBF249 CR1 gene regions (Fig4B).
Regarding annotated genes, 13 of 33 gene products were predicted as hypothetical
proteins by Prokka. Further annotation using the EggNOG database revealed that most
genes were mapped to category S (function unknown), followed by category L
(replication, recombination and repair) and category C (energy production and
conversion). Finally, a BLAST search was performed against the NCBI nt database to
explore whether a similar plasmid was already described in the literature. This resulted
in a best matching hit, showing 97% identity and 76% query coverage with plasmid
pKLC4 of Leuconostoc carnosum JB16 (GenBank accession number CP003855). This
plasmid was found in a strain isolated from kimchi and has a length of 36.6 Kb [47],
indicating that some deletions occurred in the L. mudanjiangensis plasmids. All
together, these results showed that L. mudanjiangensis strains AMBF209 and
AMBF249 carried the same conjugative plasmid, of which the encoded gene functions
are poorly characterized.

their annotation, as defined in Fig4.
Since only two of five conjugation regions (Fig4) were plasmid-encoded, an
additional analysis was performed to assess whether the other three conjugation systems
could be part of an ICE. For this, all four L. mudanjiangensis genomes were analyzed
similar to a recently published method [26]. However, ICE regions usually contain
repeats, such as transposases, leading to fragmentation of these ICE regions, if short
read sequencing technology is used [26]. Therefore, these analysis methods usually
require a complete genome for proper ICE identification. The assembly state of the four
genomes made it thus hard to correctly interpret the results obtained.

In this study, the genome sequence of the L. mudanjiangensis type strain DSM 28402T
was presented together with the genomes of three new L. mudanjiangensis strains,
AMBF197, AMBF209 and AMBF249, which were isolated from three different
spontaneous carrot juice fermentations [11]. Since previous phylogenetic analysis of this
species, using the 16S rRNA, pheS, and rpoA genes, showed a close genetic relatedness
with the members of the L. plantarum group [10], it was decided to study these
genomes in relation to the closely related members of the L. plantarum group with a
comparative genomics approach. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree confirmed
that L. mudanjiangensis was closely related to all other L. plantarum group members.
Furthermore, pairwise ANI analysis confirmed that the three strains isolated from
carrot juice fermentations were indeed members of the L. mudanjiangensis species. Yet,
this analysis also revealed that several genomes annotated as L. pentosus and L.
plantarum showed intraclade ANI values below the commonly used cut-off value of 95%
identity [34]. Especially for L. pentosus, low intraclade ANI values (a maximum of
92,3%) were found, meaning that if the 95% cut-off is strictly applied, two genome
assemblies could not be seen as members of the L. pentosus species. One of them
represented the genome sequence of the vaginal isolate L. pentosus KCA1 [48], the other
a genome sequence that has been annotated as L. plantarum EGD-AQ4, isolated from a
fermented bamboo shoot product [49]. The fact that these two genomes showed lower
intraclade ANI values could mean that these bacteria are undergoing a speciation
process or that this strict ANI value cut-off should be revised, as it potentially separates

members from the same species into different species.
The estimated genome size of L. mudanjiangensis was the second largest of the
whole L. plantarum group found up to now. The same trend was found for the gene
count per species. This means that L. mudanjiangensis harbored one of the largest
genomes of the whole LGC, since L. plantarum and especially L. pentosus are known to
be among the lactobacilli with the largest genome size and gene counts [5, 50, 51]. For L.
plantarum, this large genome and also its pangenome size have been coupled to a
nomadic lifestyle [5, 50]. This lifestyle comes with a high genetic diversity, which is
associated to the possibility to survive and thrive in many different ecosystems. This
could possibly also be applied to L. mudanjiangensis, supported by the fact that L.
mudanjiangensis showed a slightly larger number of GHs than L. plantarum (Data not
shown), indicating that this species is capable of transforming and metabolizing a broad
spectrum of carbohydrate sources. This observation was confirmed by the fact that the
type strain was found to be capable of producing organic acids from at least 21 different
carbon sources [10]. Furthermore, here, a putative cellulose-degrading enzyme,
annotated as endoglucanase E1, was found in all four L. mudanjiangensis strains, which
was not found in any other LGC genome so far. Moreover, cellulose-degrading enzymes
were never found in LAB up to now. Cellulose is the most abundant organic polymer on
earth [52], the most important skeletal component in plants in general [52] and the most
abundant crude fiber in carrots [53]. Lactobacillus mudanjiangensis’ putative capability
to degrade this fiber into glucose might allow members of this species to survive in many
different plant-related ecosystems. Fermented carrot juices and fermented pickles are
examples of such ecosystems, where three and one of the strains studied were isolated
from, respectively. Together, these results suggested that, similar to L. plantarum, a
nomadic or otherwise a plant-adapted lifestyle could be assigned to L. mudanjiangesis.
SEM analysis revealed the presence of pili or fimbriae in three of the four L.
mudanjiangensis strains studied. In this study, the observation of pili in L.
mudanjiangensis was associated with bacterial conjugation. Three of the four strains
were found to carry at least one complete putative conjugation region, including a gene
that possibly codes for a VirB2 homolog, the major subunit of a conjugation-related
pilus [43–45]. The three strains that harbored this conjugation region all showed pili
formation on the SEM images, whereas this was not the case for strain AMBF197,
which lacked this region. These results suggested that the detected pili might play a role
in cell to cell contact during the conjugation process, although this was not yet
experimentally validated.
Conjugation is one of the main drivers of horizontal gene transfer and is commonly
associated with conjugative plasmids [22, 26]. Here, two of the five conjugative regions
found were plasmid-associated and the two plasmids found were exactly the same for
both L. mudanjiangensis AMBF209 and AMBF249, although these strains were
isolated from different household carrot juice fermentations [11]. Previous studies also
identified and described conjugative plasmids in other Lactobacillus species, such as
Lactobacillus brevis [54], Lactobacillus casei [55], Lactobacillus gasseri [56], Lactobacillus
hokkaidonensis [57], L. plantarum [58] and Lactobacillus reuteri [59]. Genes on these
plasmids often code for proteins involved in detoxification, virulence, antibiotic
resistance and ecological interactions [22], which could give them a fitness advantage in
certain environments. Here, apart from the conjugation-related genes, many genes were
annotated as hypothetical proteins on the conjugative plasmid. However, since this
plasmid showed great similarity with a plasmid from a Leuconostoc strain, which was
isolated from fermented kimchi [47], it could potentially harbor genes that are beneficial
for survival on plants or in a fermented vegetable environment.
In conclusion, in this study, the genome sequences of four L. mudanjiangensis strains
were studied in relation to the closely related members of the L. plantarum group.

Comparative genome analysis of this phylogenetic group found two wrongly annotated
genome assemblies and intraclade ANI values below the commonly used species
delimitation threshold for L. plantarum and L. pentosus. Furthermore, L.
mudanjiangensis harbored one of the largest genomes and the highest gene counts of the
L. plantarum group. Together with its broad repertoire of GHs and its potential
capability to degrade cellulose, either a nomadic or plant-adapted lifestyle could be
assigned to L. mudanjiangensis. Finally, three of the four L. mudanjiangensis strains
studied showed the presence of pili on SEM images, which were linked to conjugative
gene regions. For two strains, L. mudanjiangensis AMBF209 and AMBF249, these
regions were plasmid-associated. Further experimental studies, such as phenotypic
growth curve-based screenings, conjugation experiments and the creation of knock-out
mutants, are necessary to characterize the plasmid found and to confirm the link
between the pili observed and this conjugation gene region.

342

The type strain of L. mudanjiangensis [L. mudanjiangensis DSM 28402T ( = LMG
27194T = CCUG 62991T )] was purchased from a public microorganism collection
(BCCM-LMG, Ghent, Belgium). The strain was grown overnight in de
Man-Rogosa-Sharpe (MRS) medium (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) and DNA was
extracted using the NucleoSpin 96 tissue kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany), with
an extra cell lysis step using 20 mg/mL of lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA) and 100 U/mL of mutanolysin (Sigma-Aldrich). Whole-genome sequencing was
performed using the Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego,
CA, USA) and the Illumina MiSeq platform, using 2 x 250 cycles, at the Laboratory of
Medical Microbiology (University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium) in the case of the
strains AMBF197, AMBF249 and DSM28402T or 2 x 300 cycles at the Center of
Medical Genetics Antwerp of the University of Antwerp for strain AMBF209. Assembly
of the genome sequence was performed using SPAdes v 3.12.0 [60]. In addition, all
genome sequences annotated as L. fabifermentans, L. herbarum, L. paraplantarum, L.
pentosus, L. plantarum and L. xiangfangensis were downloaded from the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Assembly database on 24/07/2018, using
in-house scripts. In total, 310 genomes were used as an input for quality control.

Quality control and annotation

360

Basic genome characteristics, including genome size, GC content and the N50 value,
were estimated using Quast 4.6.3 [61]. The quality of the genome assemblies was
evaluated using the Quast output. After visualization of several quality control
parameters using ggplot2 [62], genomes with a N50 value < 25,000 bp and a number of
undefined nucleotides (N) per 100,000 bases > 500 were discarded. An overview of all
genome sequences and strains that passed this quality control (304 assemblies) can be
found in S1 Table. Finally, Prokka 1.12 [63] was used to predict and annotate genes for
all genome sequences. In addition to its internal databases, a customized genus-specific
BLAST database was used for higher quality annotation with Prokka’s –usegenus
option. This database was created using BLAST [64, 65] and all complete Lactobacillus
genomes found in the NCBI Assembly database. Genes encoding glycosyl hydrolases
(GHs) were detected by scanning all genomes against hidden Markov model (HMM)
profiles of the CAZyme families [66]. The profiles were downloaded from the dbCAN

coverage of 0.35 were used as cut-off, similar to what has been described before [69].

Defining the pangenomes of all Lactobacillus plantarum group
species
To define the pangenome, all genes were clustered into orthogroups using OrthoFinder
2.2.6 [70] and further analyzed in R [71]. Here, a core orthogroup is defined as an
orthogroup present in more than 95% of a set of genomes. All other orthogroups are
defined as accessory orthogroups. An upset plot was created using the R package
UpSetR [72]. Unique orthogroups belonging to L. mudanjiangensis were further
annotated using EggNOG-mapper [73] and visualized using ggplot2 [62].

Single-copy core orthogroups found by Orthofinder were used as input for the
construction of a phylogenetic tree. Lactobacillus algidus DSM 15638 (NCBI Assembly
accession number GCA 001434695) served as an outgroup, as it is the species most
closely related to the L. plantarum group [1]. The first protein sequence of each fasta
file of the single-copy core orthogroups was compared with a BLAST database of all
genome proteins of the outgroup’s genome sequence. All hits with a coverage > 75%
and a percentage similarity > 50% were added to the alignment of each orthogroup.
These alignments, on amino acid level, were concatenated into a supermatrix that was
used in RaxML 8.2.9 [74], to build a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree with the –a
option, which combines a rapid bootstrap algorithm with an extensive search of the tree
space, starting from multiple different starting trees. The tree and subtrees were plotted
with the R package ggtree [75].

To assess the presence or absence of pili or fimbriae on the cell surface of L.
mudanjiangensis strains AMBF197, AMBF209, AMBF249 and DSM 28402T , SEM was
performed. To this end, the bacterial strains were grown overnight (MRS medium,
37°C), gently washed with phosphate-buffered saline (per liter: 56 g of NaCl, 1.4 g of
KCl, 10.48 g of Na2 HPO4 , 1.68 g of KH2 PO4 ; pH 7.4) and spotted on a gold-coated
membrane [(approximately 5 x 107 colony forming units (CFU) per membrane].
Bacterial spots were fixed with 2.5% (m/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate
buffer (2.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, 0.05% CaCl2 .2H2 O; pH 7.4) by
gently shaking the membrane for 1 h at room temperature, followed by a further
overnight fixation at 4 °C. After fixation, the membranes were washed three times for 20
min with cacodylate buffer (containing 7.5% [m/v] saccharose). Subsequently, the
bacteria were dehydrated in an ascending series of ethanol (50%, 70%, 90% and 95%,
each for 30 min at room temperature and 100% for 2 x 1 h and 1 x 30 min) and dried in
a Leica EM CPD030 (Leica Microsystems Belgium, Diegem, Belgium). The membranes
were mounted on a stub and coated with 5 nm of carbon (Leica Microsystems Belgium)
in a Leica EM Ace 600 coater (Leica Microsystems Belgium). SEM imaging was
performed using a Quanta FEG250 SEM system (Thermo Fisher, Asse, Belgium) at the

Detection of genomic clusters encoding pili or fimbriae

419

420

To screen for the presence of the spaCBA gene cluster, the gene cluster that is
responsible for expression of the fimbriae in L. rhamnosus GG [38, 39], a BLAST
search [64, 65] on protein level was performed against a BLAST database constructed for
each genome separately. The gene sequences of spaA (NCBI GenBank accession number
BAI40953.1), spaB (BAI40954.1) and spaC (BAI40955.1) were used as queries.
Furthermore, the genomes were screened for genes encoding pili-related protein
secretion systems, using the predicted amino acid sequences as query and the TXSScan
definitions and profile models [25] as references in MacSyFinder v1.0.5 [78]. As only
genes related to conjugation systems were found, all protein sequences of all genomes
were again scanned, this time using the CONJScan definitions and profile
models [23, 26] using MacSyFinder. In brief, a conjugation region was only considered if
the conjugation genes were separated by less than 31 genes, except for genes encoding
relaxases that can be separated by maximal 60 genes. The region was considered
conjugative when it contained genes coding for (i) a VirB4/TraU homolog, (ii) a
relaxase, (iii) a type 4 coupling protein (T4CP) and (iv) a minimum number of
mating-pair formation (MPF) type-specific genes [26]. For both scans, hits with
alignments covering > 50% of the protein profile and with an independent E-value ¡
10−3 were kept for further analysis (default parameters) in R [71]. Conserved domain
analysis of genes of interest was performed using the NCBI Conserved Domain web
interface [79]. The gene regions were visualized using the R package gggenes (available
at https://github.com/wilkox/gggenes).

Detection and reconstruction of plasmids in the different L. mudanjiangensis strains
was performed using Recycler v0.7 [46], with the original fastq files and SPAdes
assembly graphs as input. The assembled plasmids were annotated with Prokka and
further characterized by scanning against the EggNOG database, as described in above.
The presence of a conjugation system was confirmed with CONJScan, as described
above. The percentage identity between the different plasmids found was assessed using
BLAST [64, 65]. The similarity with any previously described plasmid was checked by
performing a BLAST search [64, 65] against the NCBI nucleotide (nt) database. A
plasmid map was created using Geneious v8 [80].

The presence of ICEs was explored by a similar approach as the pipeline described
previously [26]. Briefly, all strict core genes, i.e. genes present in all strains of L.
mudanjiangensis were found using the Orthofinder output (see above). Next, all
flanking core genes of each conjugative region were identified. Since within one species
an ICE is expected to be found between the same core orthogroups, the flanking core
genes of each conjugative region found were evaluated to determine whether or not it
could be defined as an ICE.

S1 Fig. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the whole Lactobacillus
plantarum group constructed using 304 genome assemblies and the amino
acid sequences of their 612 single-copy marker genes with Lactobacillus
algidus DSM 15638 as outgroup. The branch length of the outgroup was shortened
for better visualization. The colors represent the species as annotated in the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Assembly database. Type strains of each
species are annotated with a triangle (NCBI) or a square (sequenced in-house).
S2 Fig. Alternative vizualisation of all pairwise average nucleotide
identity (ANI) comparisons for each Lactobacillus plantarum group species,
as defined by the clades in Fig1. In green all inter-clade comparisons are shown,
while orange shows all intra-clade comparisons. For Lactobacillus xiangfangensis and
Lactobacillus herbarum, no intra-clade comparisons could be performed, as only one
genomic assembly was available for these species.
S1 Table. Overview of all of the publicly available Lactobacillus
plantarum group genomes used in this study. If available, the strain name is
shown in the second column. The clade name is in accordance to the phylogenetic tree
