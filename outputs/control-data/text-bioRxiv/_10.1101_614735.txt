ABSTRACT

20

The cardiac muscle proteins, generating and regulating energy transduction during a heartbeat,

21

assemble in the sarcomere into a cyclical machine repetitively translating actin relative to myosin

22

filaments. Myosin is the motor transducing ATP free energy into actin movement against

23

resisting force. Cardiac myosin binding protein C (mybpc3) regulates shortening velocity

24

probably by transient N-terminus binding to actin while its C-terminus strongly binds the myosin

25

filament. Inheritable heart disease associated mutants frequently modify these proteins involving

26

them in disease mechanisms. Nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) cause

27

single residue substitutions with independent characteristics (sequence location, residue

28

substitution, human demographic, and allele frequency) hypothesized to decide dependent

29

phenotype and pathogenicity characteristics in a feed-forward Neural network model. Trial

30

models train and validate on a dynamic worldwide SNP database for cardiac muscle proteins

31

then predict phenotype and pathogenicity for any single residue substitution in myosin, mybpc3,

32

or actin. A separate Bayesian model formulates conditional probabilities for phenotype or

33

pathogenicity given independent SNP characteristics. Neural/Bayes forecasting tests SNP

34

pathogenicity vs (in)dependent SNP characteristics to assess individualized disease risk and in

35

particular to elucidate gender and human subpopulation bias in disease. Evident subpopulation

36

bias in myosin SNP pathogenicities imply myosin normally engages other sarcomere proteins

37

functionally. Consistent with this observation, mybpc3 forms a third actomyosin interaction

38

competing with myosin essential light chain N-terminus suggesting a novel strain-dependent

39

mechanism adapting myosin force-velocity to load dynamics. The working models, and the

40

integral myosin/mybpc3 motor concept, portends the wider considerations involved in

41

understanding heart disease as a systemic maladaptation.

INTRODUCTION

48

The cardiac muscle proteins generate and regulate energy transduction during a heartbeat. They

49

assemble into a cyclical machine in the sarcomere that repetitively translates actin relative to

50

myosin filaments. Myosin is the

51

motor transducing ATP free energy

52

to the work of moving actin against

53

resisting force. Cardiac myosin

54

binding protein C (mybpc3)

55

regulates shortening velocity

56

probably by binding transiently to

57

actin while stably bound to the

58

myosin filament.

59

Myosin (Fig 1) has a 140

60

kDa N-terminal globular head

61

called subfragment 1 (S1) and an

68

Fig 1. Myosin dimer proteolysis produces two subfragment
1 peptides (S1, blue), subfragment 2 (S2, blue), and light

meromyosin (LMM, blue). S1 has a motor domain and lever
arm with bound light chains ELC (black) and RLC (red).
(LMM+S2). Tail domains form
The motor binds to an actin filament and rotates the lever

70

binding site and a lever arm whose rotary movement cyclically applies tension to strongly bound

71

actin 3. The lever arm complex, stabilized by bound essential and regulatory light chains (ELC

72

and RLC) 4-7, converts torque generated by the motor into linear displacement.
Cardiac myosin binding protein C localizes to the C-zone of the muscle sarcomere and

73
74

regulates the actomyosin sliding velocity 8. It has 11 immunoglobulin-like (Ig) or fibronectin-like

75

(Fn) globular domains (c0-c10) resembling a pearl necklace with c0 near the N-terminus. The c0

76

Ig-like domain is unique to the cardiac isoform studied here 9. The protein contains several sites

77

for serine, and one site for threonine, phosphorylation and involving phosphokinase A (PKA)

78

and PKC in its regulation. The mybpc3 C-terminus associates with the myosin thick filament 10.

79

The mybpc3 N-terminus associates with myosin S2 11, RLC 12 and with F-actin in vitro 13-15 and

80

in intact muscle 16, 17 (Fig 1). The role of mybpc3 in cardiac muscle regulation is extensively

81

studied and associates with modulation of contractile force-velocity 11, 18, 19, myosin S2 stability

82

11

, and myosin super-relaxation 20. As relates to modulation of force-velocity, we propose

83

mybpc3 both resembles and competes with ELC because its transient actomyosin crosslink

84

affects movement and it binds actin at the same site as the ELC N-terminus. We suggest it is a

85

fourth subunit of the motor after myosin heavy chain (MHC), RLC, and ELC.

86

Actin has two major domains separated by a nucleotide-binding cleft that are further

87

subdivided into subdomains 1 and 2, and, 3 and 4 21. In their strong binding state, actin and

88

cardiac myosin make multiple contacts over 3 actin monomers in the actin (thin) filament as

89

show in Fig 1 22. These contacts in actin include residues in all 4 subdomains 23. In myosin they

90

included notable structured 24, 25 and unstructured surface loops 26 usually involving ionic

91

interactions, hydrophobic regions on the myosin surface 27, and a unique contact between actin

92

and the myosin ELC N-terminus 28-30. These contacts modulate actin activation of the myosin

93

ATPase, actin affinity for myosin and, myosin step-size 31.

94

Human heart diseases link to variations in myosin, actin, and mybpc3 with diverse

95

phenotypes reflecting modifications to cardiac muscle mechanochemistry. The depth and breadth

96

of cardiac myosin 32, 33, actin 1, 23, and mybpc3 9, 17 structural characterization is unique due to

97

vigorous scientific interest driven by desires to positively affect human health and to understand

98

a natural nanomotor design. Missense single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are clues for

99

understanding cardiovascular disease mechanism quantitated here in an extensive database

100

containing mutant location in a protein domain (domain), residue substitution (sidechain), human

101

population group (demographic), and prevalence (frequency) as independent variables that imply

102

the dependent disease phenotype and pathogenicity characteristics. The unknown disease model

103

mechanism is surmised implicitly using a feed-forward neural network then interpreted explicitly

104

with a discrete Bayes network for Neural/Bayes forecasting as already described 34. Involvement

105

of the independent demographic and frequency characteristics is new to this application as is the

106

application to actin. Neural/Bayes forecasting tests pathogenicity vs demographics of mutations

107

in different protein domains. It provides a prognosis that assesses individual risk due to genetic

108

background and gender, and, identifies protein domains and inter-protein interactions critical to

109

disease mechanisms.

2. METHODS

114

2.1 SNP data retrieval. An automated search/fetch Perl script downloads the SNP reference

115

numbers (rs#) from the National Center for Bioinformatics (NCBI) SNP database for the human

116

cardiac myosin heavy and light chains, actin, and mybpc3 genes. Automated extraction of other

117

information from the NCBI SNP database uses database text search/extract tools in Mathematica

118

(Wolfram, Champaign, IL, USA) collecting location in the protein sequence, residue

119

substitution, population demographic, allele frequency, and the clinical data set assigning

120

pathogenicity and phenotype. Clinical phenotype and pathogenicity data is frequently unfulfilled

121

(presumed unknown), inconclusive (presumed unknown), or contradictory among data

122

submitters. We inspected the clinical data when results from data submitters conflicted and

123

reached consensus by requiring two or more reports to agree. Otherwise, when there is no

124

consensus, the result was presumed unknown.

125

Human ventricular βcardiac myosin (βmys) is encoded in the MYH7 (MHC), MYL3

126

(ELC), and MYL2 (RLC) genes. Human atrial αcardiac myosin (αmys) is encoded by the

127

MYH6 (MHC), MYL4 (ELC), and MYL7 (RLC) genes. Human mybpc3 is encoded by the

128

MYPBC3 gene. Human actin is encoded by the ACTC1 gene.

129
130

2.2 Network configuration. Trial network configurations associate mutant (mu) location in the

131

protein domain (cd), residue substitution (re), population demographic (po), and SNP allele

132

frequency (af) in a causal relationship with phenotype (ph) and pathogenicity (pa) in model

133

configurations denoted in Fig 2.

the linearized representation. Myosin light chains appear below the heavy chain. Actin and
MYBPC3 binding sites are indicated in green and red above the heavy chain and below the ELC.
The mybpc3 diagram consists of 8 Ig-like domains (black circles) and 3 fibronectin-like domains

interest include the proline rich linker (PR) and L2 containing a regulatory site. Z1 is a zinc
binding site. Myosin S2 and LMM and actin binding sites on mybpc3 are indicated above the
linearized model. The cardiac actin diagram consists of α-helical segments (h0-h15) and looping
regions indicated with brackets 1. Domain structure divides the molecule into outer and inner
domains and four subdomains (sd1-4). Myosin and mybpc3 binding sites on actin are indicated
above the linearized model in blue and red.

150

Residue substitution (re in Fig 2) refers to the reference and substituted residue (ref/sub)

151

pair. Possible ref/sub combinations have 420 possibilities for 21 amino acids. A hydrophobicity

152

index was derived from model peptide studies on the stability of amphipathic α-helices. It ranks

153

residues as hydrophilic (p), neutral (n), hydrophobic (m), and very hydrophobic (h) 35. The

154

descriptive index simplifies residue substitution to a more tractable 16 ref/sub pairs

155

characterizing every mutation. Input residue substitution pairs and their 2 letter abbreviations

156

indicated in SI Table S3 summarizes input indicated by re in the Fig. 2 model. In addition, each

157

residue is assigned an integer score whose difference for a ref/sub pair (the ref/sub score Δ)

158

ranges from −3 for hydrophilic/very-hydrophobic pairs to +3 for very-hydrophobic/hydrophilic

159

pairs. The ref/sub scores are also indicated in SI Table S3.

160

Residue substitution prevalence (allele frequency or af in Fig 2) in the human population

161

group (demographic or po in Fig 2) fill out the independent parameters in the network.

162

Demographic groups (po) and their 3 letter abbreviations are indicated in SI Table S4. We will

163

use subsets of these demographic groups pertaining to ethnic identity or gender as indicated in

164

Table S4 to draw attention to interesting data tendencies. Allele frequency is a continuous

165

variable in the database on the interval 0 ≤ af ≤ 1 for 1 meaning all alleles are substituted by the

166

SNP. These data are subdivided into the three discrete categories indicated in SI Table S5.

167

Phenotype (ph) and pathology (pa) data have standardized classifications for

168

cardiovascular disease. A total of 13 phenotypes for cardiac myosin, mybpc3, and cardiac actin

169

from the NCBI SNP database include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hc), dilated cardiomyopathy

170

(dc), restrictive cardiomyopathy (rc), left ventricle noncompaction cardiomyopathy (lv),

171

cardiomyopathy (cm), congenital myopathy (gm), atrial fibrillation (af), ventricular fibrillation

(nv), and unknown (uk). Cardiomyopathy (cm) describes apparent heart conditions in which

174

specific etiologies are not clearly identified. Cardiovascular phenotype (cp) describes conditions

175

affecting the cardiovascular system but not directly the myocardium (e.g. valvulopaties, aortic

176

coarctation) 36, 37. Congenital myopathy (gm) are muscular diseases of genetic etiology that

177

rarely affects the heart. Left ventricle noncompaction (lv) and atrial septal defect (ad) are heart

178

developmental defects sometimes leading to secondary cardiomyopathy due to hemodynamic

179

abnormalities. This phenotype list is also indicated in SI Table S6.

modeling structure/function influences from disease follow from the model in Fig 2. They relate

domain position (cd), residue substitution (re), population (po), and allele frequency (af) inputs

represented in the set except when their representation in the fulfilled 6ddp’s is <2 occurrences.

196

Learnable weights for the linear layers are randomly initialized. Weight initializations are

197

normally distributed with zero mean and standard deviation of (1/n)½ (for n inputs). Bias is

198

initialized to zero. A total of 1800 trials generate the 20 best implicit models. This process is

199

repeated 5 times and the results (100 total models) are combined into 24-25 best-of-the-best

200

implicit models. These 24-25 neural networks embody distinct implicit models for disease that

201

are sufficiently diverse to cause normally distributed estimates for Bayes network probabilities

202

(discussed below) implying that they randomly sample the set of good implicit disease models.

2.3 Neural network validation. The ability to correctly classify new SNPs (new-unknown data

206

corresponding to new unfulfilled 6ddps) measures suitability of a neural network trial. We set

207

aside fulfilled 6ddps to be the new-unknown dataset but from the part of the validation data pool

208

that does not include training data since a real new-unknown could never be a part of training.

209

Each new-unknown 6ddp has its position and substitution assignment evaluated by the neural

210

network trial with the output phenotype and pathogenicity compared to the know value. This

211

comparison is the new-unknown predictor metric that we use to rank neural network model

212

suitability.

213

The best model neural networks (ranked by their new-unknown predictor metric) predict

214

unfulfilled (ph, pa) outputs from their domain position (cd), residue substitution (re), population

215

(po), and allele frequency (af) assignments. Fulfilled and predicted outputs combined are the

216

database for Bayes network (Fig 2) tasked with formulating a statistics based myosin, mybpc3,

217

or actin structure/function mechanism as described in the next section.

Arrows imply a direction for influence hence the domain (cd), residue substitution (re),

221

population (po), and allele frequency (af) assignment implies a probability for phenotype (ph)

222

and pathogenicity (pa). Datasets 6ddpMYH7.xls, 6ddpMYH6.xls, 6ddpMYBPC3.xls, and

223

6ddpACTC1.xls in SI show the fulfilled and unfulfilled 6ddps for βmys, αmys, mybpc3, and

224

actin containing 4523, 6649, 4003, and 170 variations in the database corresponding to 1877,

2.5 Significance testing. We tested reproducibility and significance of the cardiac disease models

233

by generating a large pool of implicit neural network models in the Fig 2 configuration. Models

234

are independent solutions to this highly constrained problem that are ranked for reliability by the

235

new-unknown predictor metric. We used the ranked model solutions to estimate the collective

236

quantities described subsequently in RESULTS related to demographics for each protein

237

sequence. Best ranked model solutions formed a finite subset for each protein drawn from the

238

larger pool of independent solutions. Model solution members in each subset were increased

239

(best solutions by the new-unknown predictor metric used first) until the collective quantities

240

were unchanged by further enlargement of the subset. This selection process favored model

241

subsets best approximating the real disease mechanism by minimizing random error but is

242

unlikely to address systematic model limitations. Each model solution in a subset exactly

243

reproduces 80-92% of the known 6ddps in the target protein constraining potential systematic

244

errors in the models to just 8-20%.of the dataset and implying the measure of their reliability,

3. RESULTS
We applied the Neural/Bayes network models for disease in Fig 2 to ventricular and atrial

251
252

cardiac myosin, mybpc3, and cardiac actin to investigate inheritable cardiac disease

253

demographics versus the mutant location in protein functional domains. Given human

254

populations listed in SI Table S4, pathogenic or benign outcome probabilities were calculated

255

for nonsynonymous SNPs falling into the functional protein domains represented schematically

256

in Fig 3 and listed in SI Tables S1-S2. Results are from using the 24-25 independent best-of-the-

257

best implicit models for each protein’s contribution to the contractile mechanism. Models

258

selected satisfy the reproducibility and significance testing described in METHODS (section

259

2.5).

260

Pathogenicity is summarized as either pathogenic or benign by combining likely-

261

pathogenic with pathogenic probabilities or likely-benign with benign probabilities (see Table

262

1). Demographic probabilities for each protein functional domain and pathogenicity category

263

were computed with Bayesian statistics as described 34 and listed in SI Tables S7-S10. An

264

example from that data for a single functional domain in βmys is shown in Fig 5. There are 26-

265

28 domains for the proteins considered suggesting that a baseline contribution to pathogenicity

266

probability for each functional domain is ~3% of the total. We split this probability between

267

pathogenic and benign categories suggesting domains contributing significantly and specifically

268

to function will likely contribute >1% to each category. We refer to these domains as qualified

269

functional domains (QFDs). SNPs in QFDs cause pathogenic and benign outcomes by selective

270

residue substitutions suggesting their side chains are specifically involved in sarcomere function

271

and implying that their demographic trends are reliable.

βmys is taken from SI Table S7. En domain is a QFD in βmys. Quantities are defined in the
text.

273

Protein domains included in a result for a given protein are those represented in each of

274

the 24-25 implicit models and for both pathogenic and benign outcomes. The example matrices

275

in Fig 5 are for the ELC N-terminus domain (en). It is a QFD and drawn verbatim from the

276

complete results in SI Table S7. In Fig 5 and SI Table S7, large side-by-side matrices are for

277

pathogenic (left) or benign (right) pathogenicity while both matrices pertain to the same

278

functional domain (cd, coded in the first row). Probabilities (first column) are an average over

279

24-25 best-of-the-best implicit models (under heading <P(cd|po)>N, where N is 24-25) for

280

population demographic (po) in the third column. SD (standard deviation, second column)

281

measures the spread. The number of 6ddps contributing to the probability, indicated in column 4,

combine SNP data from NCBI when known (Da for data) with that from estimates by the neural

283

network when unknown (Si for simulated) from 24 implicit models (sol). Mean allele frequency

284

from the contributing 6ddps (under heading < P(cd|af) >N), appears in column 5. N-averaged

285

probabilities in column 1 are themselves averaged over the populations to obtain the value in the

286

bottom row under the heading << P(cd|po) >N >po and with spread below the lower SD in column

287

2. The quantity indicated by x is the total protein domain probability for pathogenic (left matrix)

288

and benign (right matrix) outcomes hence they are comparable horizontally (over pathogenicity)

289

for a given protein domain and vertically among the different protein domains. A domain is a

290

QFD (see Methods section 2.5) when x ≥ 0.01 for both pathogenic and benign categories (en is a

291

QFD in Fig 5). All x quantities for a given protein (seen in SI TablesS7-S10) do not sum to 1

292

because x from some domains are not represented in both pathogenic and benign categories and

293

are not included in the tables. The Σx appearing only on the pathogenic side indicates the sum of

294

x for pathogenic and benign cases in the same domain (i.e., side-by-side matrices). Pearson’s r

295

(R) spans the dynamic range −1 ≤ R ≤ 1 and measures linear correlation between the integer

296

sequence counting three or more populations in column 3 and declining probabilities in column

297

1. It is assigned the largest magnitude value for pathogenic and benign cases in each protein

298

domain and appears only on the benign side. It relates correlation strength for probability vs

299

demographics over the protein functional domains. The R-correlation range over functional

300

domains in βmys, αmys, mybpc3, or actc1 is listed in the last row of SI Tables S7-S10.

301

The detailed results in Tables S7-S10 are broadly summarized by significance tested

302

estimates for most and least overall pathogenic or most and least overall benign ethnic

303

population or gender in Fig 6. The summary ranking estimates identify the demographic that

304

consistently ranks highest or lowest in pathogenic outcomes over the entire protein as measured

305

directly by pathogenicity or indirectly by the lowest or highest ranking in benign outcomes.

306

Summary ranking is a qualitative measure for heart disease burden in a demographic and is done

307

in two ways. The first using Bayes statistics that is appropriately weighted by normalized

308

probabilities and a second simpler approach that permits easier comparison with quantitative

309

results in SI Tables S7-S10. The second method does not preserve relative weighting of

310

functional domains but requires that included functional domains have ≥ 1% of the total

311

probability for pathogenic or benign outcomes. This is different from the QFD rule where both

312

pathogenic and benign outcomes must qualify with ≥ 1% of the total probability. In the second

313

method ranking 1st or 2nd at the high end of the demographic probability listing (column 1 in the

314

qualified matrices from SI Tables S7-S10) earns a 3 or 1 score while ranking lowest or second

315

from lowest in the probability listing earns a -3 or -1 score. These integers are replaced by real

316

probabilities, but keeping the sign assignment, for the Bayes statistics method. Both methods

317

give identical ranking of data used here. When gender is the population group, 2 quantities are

318

involved and scores rank first or last positions with 1 or -1 or the appropriately signed probability

319

for the Bayes statistics method. Smaller matrices in Fig 6 show summary rankings and numerical

320

scores for ethnic population or gender subsets over protein domains that contribute >1%

321

probability to pathogenic (left) or benign (right) outcomes. Ethnic (eg., AFR or EUR) and gender

322

subsets are defined in SI Table S4.

3a. Ventricular cardiac myosin (βmys). Disease demographics for βmys SNPs correlate

328

pathogenicity probability with population. An example for one of the QFDs is shown in Fig 5.

329

Pathogenicity probability vs population is negatively correlated and approximately linear for all

330

qualifying domains as measured by quantity R (SI Table S7). Summary rankings in Fig 6 for

331

βmys has African (AFR) and Ashkenazi Jewish (ASJ) ethnic populations scoring similarly at the

332

high end of the probability scale, to develop pathologic cardiac disease, for the myosin domains

333

represented in each of the 24 best-of-the-best implicit models. European (EUR) and Ad Mixed

334

American (AMR) ethnic populations are more protected from serious disease by scoring at the

335

low end of the probability scale for pathologic outcomes. The 2 most pathogenic populations

336

(AFR and ASJ) are significantly different from the two least pathogenic populations (EUR and

337

AMR) for ANOVA significance testing with p< 0.01. Comparing gender (Fig 6), males (MAL)

338

are more likely to develop pathogenic heart disease than females (FEM) for ANOVA

339

significance testing with p< 0.05. βmys is predominant in the ventricle implying a male

340

preference for ventricle disease. On the benign side of the probability tables, results are less

341

definitive with most probability density for benign outcomes spread over domains inconsistently

342

represented in the 24 best-of-the best implicit models (except for the QFDs, see next paragraph).

343

Allele frequency is low for every population. These prognosis indicators summarized above for

344

βmys add personalized depth to a health plan addressing possible inheritable disease. Trends for

345

protein domains in pathogenic or benign categories are immediately actionable for prognosis.

346

Two domains dominantly impacting disease demographics for βmys are QFDs with >1%

347

of the total probability for both pathogenic and benign outcomes. They are the actin binding

348

sites: C-loop (cl) and ELC N-terminus (en) identified in Fig 1. C-loop is a conserved structured

349

loop on the surface of βmys that senses ATP binding, weak actin binding, and actin-activation of

350

myosin ATPase 24.The C-loop participates in formation of the rigor bond with actin 25. The ELC

351

N-terminus modulates strain-dependent mechanics 38. It is the site for one of two regulatory

352

mechanisms (the other one is strain-dependent ADP release) that remixes the 3 different myosin

353

unitary step-sizes with changed stepping frequencies in response to loading 30. On board machine

354

intelligence in βmys down-shifts average displacement with increasing loads by utilizing these

355

strain-dependent regulatory mechanisms 31, 39. The C-loop and ELC N-terminus QFDs have a site

356

selective and specific response to residue substitutions in the peptide chain that are involved in

357

cardiac disease. They are differently sensitive to ethnic population implying deeper (than the

358

βmys sequence) genetic and cultural factors play a role that we capture in the neural net implicit

359

models used here to classify a large dataset and to address population dependence of disease

360

prognosis. New research will address the deeper genetic and cultural factors in play.

3b. Atrial cardiac myosin (αmys). Disease demographics, summarized in SI Fig S8 for αmys

363

SNPs, correlates pathogenicity probability with population from the 25 best-of-the-best implicit

364

models. Pathogenicity probability vs population for αmys is negatively correlated and

365

approximately linear for all qualifying domains as measured by quantity R (SI Table S8). R for

366

αmys occupies a higher amplitude and narrower range than for βmys implying a more uniform

367

and definitive statement from the best implicit models. Pathogenic and benign outcome statistics

368

for αmys vs βmys are qualitatively reversed. The benign outcomes produce the more definitive

369

findings for αmys and where most probability density for pathogenic outcomes spread over

370

domains inconsistently represented in the 25 best-of-the-best implicit models. The summary

371

rankings in Fig 6 for αmys has South Asian (SAS) and Non-Finnish European (NFE)

372

populations scored at the higher end of the probability scale for benign cardiac disease for the

373

myosin domains represented in each of the 25 best-of-the-best implicit models. African (AFR)

374

and Finnish in Finland (FIN) populations score at the low end of the probability scale for benign

375

outcomes, i.e., they are less protected from serious disease. Populations in the benign disease

376

summary are significantly different from each other for ANOVA significance testing with p <

377

0.01. Female (FEM) populations score higher for pathogenic outcomes compared to male (MAL)

378

populations with the difference significant at the p < 0.01 level. The latter MAL/FEM ordering is

379

also reflected in the probability scores of the benign outcomes. αmys is predominant in the

380

atrium implying a female preference for atrium disease. Gender inequality for α- and βmys

381

suggests that atrium centric inheritable cardiac disease is more detrimental to women’s health

382

while ventriculum centric inheritable cardiac disease is more detrimental to men’s health. The

383

results again suggest deep genetic and cultural factors play a role in the cardiac disease that we

384

capture in the neural net implicit models used here to classify a large dataset and to address

385

population dependence of disease prognosis.

386

SI Table S8 for αmys indicates that five QFDs impact disease demographics for αmys.

387

They are the ELC N-terminus (en, Fig 1), lever arm (la, Fig 1), ELC binding IQ domain on the

388

lever arm (qe), and k7 and k5 that are large (200 and 400 residue) default domains corresponding

389

to 27k and 50k molecular weight fragments produced by proteolysis at unstructured loops 1 and

390

2 (l1 and l2). The ELC N-terminus is the single QFD that presents in both ventriculum and

391

atrium centric inheritable diseases and is the largest contributor to probability in both α- and

392

βmys. ELC is intimately involved in myosin strain-dependent mechanics 38, its binding to the IQ

393

domain (qe) stabilizes the lever arm 40, and it is critical for the native folding of the myosin

394

heavy chain after translation 41. The lever arm (la) converts torque generated in the motor domain

396

of myosin into linear displacement of actin. It is the ultimate determinant of the myosin step-size
42

. The k7 and k5 domains qualify as QFDs due to the size of their contribution to pathogenicity

397

probabilities but are heterogeneous with respect to function as their sequences flank SH3 (h3)

398

and the active site (ac) in k7, and, several of the actin binding sites in k5. The k7 and k5 are

399

default domains that are assigned SNPs whose location falls outside the sequence range of other

400

more specifically functionally identified domains. Identification of k7 and k5 as QFDs suggest

401

that sequence assignment to functional domains needs further scrutiny possibly to involve a

402

larger part of the protein sequence in SH3, active site, and actin binding domain in the heavy

403

chain.

404
405

3c. Cardiac myosin binding protein C (mybpc3). Disease demographics are summarized in SI

406

Fig S9. Mybpc3 domains contributing substantially to the pathogenicity probabilities far

407

outnumber those in βmys and αmys implying the protein and its human host readily tolerates

408

these variations that measurably impact function. Pathogenicity probability vs population for

409

mybpc3 is negatively correlated and approximately linear for all qualifying domains as measured

410

by quantity R (SI Table S9). The summary rankings in Fig 6 for mybpc3 has East Asian (EAS)

411

and Ad Mixed American (AMR) populations are most likely, while South Asian (SAS) and

412

African (AFR) populations least likely to suffer pathologic cardiac disease for the mybpc3

413

domains represented in each of the 25 best-of-the-best implicit models. The benign pathogenicity

414

outcomes (right matrix SI Fig S9) trend identically by favoring South Asian (SAS) and African

415

(AFR) while disfavoring East Asian (EAS) and Ad Mixed American (AMR) populations.

416

Prognosis is significantly impacted by gender. Female (FEM) populations always fare better than

417

Male (MAL) counterparts for pathogenic outcomes. Summary distinctions between ethnic

418

populations and genders are significant at the p< 0.01 level.

419

Four QFDs (c0, c1, l2 and c10) for mybpc3 (out of 20) are especially notable (see SI Fig

420

S9). The c0-c1-l2-c2 Ig-like and linker domains at the mybpc3 N-terminus transiently bind

421

myosin 12, while c1 and l2 (l2 also called M-domain containing 4 phosphorylation sites),

422

transiently bind actin 13-17 (see Fig 1). The c10 (cx) Ig-like domain on the mybpc3 C-terminus

423

binds to LMM 17 anchoring mybpc3 to the thick filament (Figs 1 & 3). The binding sites

424

facilitate actomyosin translation velocity modulation in a mechanism regulated by mybpc3

425

phosphorylation in the l2 linker 18, 43-45. Transient mybpc3 N-terminus/actin binding imitates

426

transient ELC N-terminus/actin binding 46 by targeting the same site on the actin surface (Fig 1)

427

implying they compete for it within the C-zone. Actin binding of the ELC N-terminus performs a

428

strain dependent down-shifting of myosin based displacement by altering the relative frequency

429

of the three βmys step-sizes 31, 47. The specific effect of mybpc3 actin binding and competition

430

with ELC on myosin step-size in the C-zone is unknown. Total probability for SNPs to

431

contribute to pathogenicity is larger for c1 than any other QFD in mybpc3 attesting to its central

432

significance in the implicit disease mechanisms coded in the best-of-the-best neural network

433

models.

3d. Cardiac actin (actc1). Disease demographics for actin summarized in SI Fig S10 are the

436

simplest of the four cardiac sarcomeric proteins studied. The statistics do not identify any QFDs

437

because there is little data on the actin SNPs, possibly because the human protein has few natural

438

SNPs that are not lethal to the fetus. They identify just one domain, the ring-rich loop (rr), with a

439

very substantial contribution to pathogenicity. Pathogenicity probability vs population for

440

cardiac actin is negatively correlated and approximately linear for all qualifying domains as

441

measured by R (SI Fig S10). No summary ranking of demographics equivalent to those in Fig 6

442

is possible in this case. The ring-rich loop is not implicated in F-actin intermolecular interactions

443

possibly allowing individuals with SNPs in that domain to survive longer although the associated

444

cardiac disease is pathological. Actin sequences are highly conserved between skeletal (acta1)

445

and cardiac (actc1) isoforms implying that additional data relevant to cardiac function might be

446

gleaned from SNPs in the skeletal actin although notable structural 48 and functional

447

characteristics 31 differentiate them possibly complicating disease models.

4. DISCUSSION
Myosin is the engine powering the beating heart. Its motor domain transducer located

454

within the heavy chain contains ATP and actin binding sites, and, mechanical elements coupling

455

motor generated torque to the myosin filament backbone for transduction/mechanical coupling.

456

The mechanical coupler is an α-helical lever arm, stabilized by essential and regulatory light

457

chains (ELC and RLC), that rotates to impel strongly bound actin filaments (Fig 1). Linear actin

458

displacement from unitary lever arm rotation produces a unitary displacement (step-size) that

459

responds to conditions in real time by using a second cyclical interaction between actin and the

460

ELC N-terminus 22, 29 to modulate step-size length 47. Myosin in the contraction cycle adapts to

461

changing power demands by regulating contractile force and velocity using 3 distinctive unitary

462

step-sizes with step-size choice decided mainly by load 47. Down-shifting average step-size

463

changes myosin from a high-displacement transducer for high velocity auxotonic shortening into

464

a low-displacement transducer maintaining tension in near-isometric contraction 39. Native

465

myosin functionality could require the structured environment and proximity to ancillary protein

466

components in the muscle sarcomere such as mypbc3, or, might fully replicate its native

467

behavior in vitro as a purified, isolated, and independent motor translating actin. Whether force-

468

velocity regulation is a systemic property of the sarcomere or an intrinsic property of an

469

autonomous myosin impacts approached to researching disease mechanisms.

470
471

Sarcomere protein integration explains demographic/SNP-pathogenicity correlation.

472

In vitro single myosin mechanical characterization uses purified and isolated myosin and

473

reveals a telling correspondence between in vitro and in vivo systems that indicates myosin is to

474

some extent an autonomous molecule such that the cardiac myosin is functionally the muscle in a

475

molecule 47. Autonomous myosin codes its mechanism for real time force-velocity regulation

476

into the protein sequence that was captured in a Neural/Bayes network model 34. Single residue

477

sequence variation from a SNP in myosin or mybpc3 is a common cause of inheritable heart

478

disease that affects people worldwide. Our earlier work developed a machine intelligence model

479

for disease that implicitly characterized SNP impacts on function providing a predictive

480

Neural/Bayes network model for SNP variation disease pathogenicity. Predictability contingent

481

on an autonomous motor implies that a SNP in the motor has implications independent of

482

demographics providing the protein sequence is otherwise conserved. Moreover,

483

structure/function studies of the motor always assume myosin motor autonomy. Now we

484

involved human demographics in SNP classification and find pathogenicity correlates with

485

human subpopulations and gender. Our realization that mybpc3 forms a third actomyosin

486

interaction competing with the ELC N-terminus ratchet 30 implies a new strain-dependent

487

mechanism outside the myosin molecule modulating motor adaptation to load. The new

488

predictive Neural/Bayes network model for myosin, mybpc3, and actin variation disease

489

pathogenicity, developed here from in vivo human data involving the population genetic/cultural

490

background and gender, promises a more realistic statistical prognosis. This working model, and

491

the integral myosin/mybpc3 motor concept, implies some of the wider considerations involved in

492

understanding heart disease as a systemic maladaptation.

493

Earlier work introduced a systemic heart disease mechanism to explain how widely

494

spatially distributed point mutations in myosin, mybpc3, or actin cause specific and unique

495

motor functional alterations but induce a common phenotype such as hypertrophic

had substantial and significantly higher contractile variability compared to normal control

501

remodeling and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

502

The M-band contains connective elements in the sarcomere important for managing force

503

imbalances during active muscle contraction. It has a role as shock absorber in contracting

504

muscle dealing with dynamic mechanical stress by changing its protein composition in response

505

to changing demands 51. It is an adaptive substructure of the sarcomere responding to disease

506

related altered myosin, mybpc3, or actin function that is itself probably impacted by

507

demographic variation. The M-band is a potential addition to the integral myosin/mybpc3 motor

508

concept comprising the actual autonomous contractile system.

511

Alternative role for mybpc3.
Mybpc3 is the third actomyosin crosslinker after the myosin heavy chain and ELC in

512

striated muscle and is now proposed to impact motor strain-dependent mechanics. Its multi-

513

component structure for actomyosin connectivity has the C-terminus Ig-like domain (cx)

514

anchored to the myosin thick filament and the c0-c1-l2-c2 N-terminus domains (l2 is a linker

515

including 4 phosphorylation sites involved in regulation sometimes called the M-domain)

516

engaged in transient binding to myosin (Fig 1). Each subdomain element in the connectivity

517

mechanism, except c2, is a QFD by analysis of the relationship of their SNPs to disease

518

519

motor proteins (α- and βmys) both identify the ELC N-terminus as a QFD while αmys also

520

identifies its complementary Iq-domain for ELC binding as a QFD implying connecting sites

521

from myosin heavy chain-to-ELC-to-actin are necessary for native functionality. An analogous

522

situation occurs in mybpc3 with the cx anchor to myosin (equivalent to the ELC site that binds

523

the lever arm Iq-domain) and transient actin binding activity site c0-c1-l2-c2 (equivalent to the

524

ELC N-terminus in myosin) qualifying as QFDs (except for c2) forming the connectinons

525

necessary for strain regulation. The N-terminus of ELC and the N-terminus of mybpc3 appear to

526

compete for the binding site on actin (Fig 1) implying they competitively influence myosin

527

strain-dependent mechanics. Mybpc3 could sterically disrupt the normal actin/ELC interaction in

528

the C-zone or involve itself as an integral part of an independent myosin strain-dependent

529

mechanism. New experimental work investigating these possibilities will address the impact of

530

the mybpc3 on loaded myosin contractility in the context of single myosin mechanics as done

531

previously for the ELC N-terminus/actin interaction 30, 47.

Demographic inequalities in heart disease
Implicit neural network modeling of human disease mechanisms from nonsynonymous

535

SNPs located in cardiac myosins (α- and βmys) and mybpc3 finds that demographics

536

significantly influence heart disease pathology. Similar modeling for cardiac actin was

537

inconclusive probably because of insufficient SNP data. Considering just myosin and mybpc3

538

findings, SNPs in these proteins collectively favor pathogenic outcomes in the African (AFR) or

539

East Asian (EAS) populations while favoring benign outcomes in the South Asian (SAS) and Ad

540

Mixed American (AMR) populations. These findings are a basis for assessing an individual’s

risk for a particular sequence variant and population group. Statistically significant gender bias in

542

mybpc3 has males (MAL) developing more pathological disease from closely related SNPs when

543

compared to females (FEM). Statistically significant gender bias in β- and αmys suggests

544

pathological and benign outcomes from closely related SNPs in these proteins correlate with

545

pathological outcomes favoring male ventriculum and female atrium and with benign outcomes

546

favoring male atrium and female ventriculum. This observation has value when evaluating risk

547

from heart contractility metrics since it shows atrial or ventricular functional impairment has

548

different implications for women or men.

5. CONCLUSION

552

SNPs cause unique residue substitutions in the functional domains of ventricular myosin (βmys),

553

atrial myosin (αmys), mybpc3, and actin (actc1). Independent SNP characteristics of domain

554

location, residue substitution, demographic, and allele frequency predict their dependent

555

phenotype and pathogenicity using a feed-forward neural network model (Fig 2). The NCBI SNP

556

database was mined to assign known independent and dependent discrete variables in 6

557

dimensional data points (fulfilled 6ddps) for each protein. The latter train and validate the neural

558

network models that can then predict phenotype and pathogenicity for any single residue

559

substitution in myosin, mybpc3, or actin. The SNP database also contains a majority of 6ddps

560

having one or both dependent data points unknown (unfulfilled 6ddps). Unfulfilled 6ddps are

561

predicted using the neural network models. A discrete Bayes network interprets combined

562

fulfilled and predicted 6ddps with conditional probabilities for phenotype or pathogenicity given

563

independent SNP characteristics. This Neural/Bayes network forecasting tests pathogenicity vs

564

demographics of mutations in the protein domains and finds pathogenicity correlates with human

565

subpopulations and gender. The latter implies functional cardiac motor health depends on

566

myosin and ancillary protein components from the muscle sarcomere. In addition, the graphic

567

realization that mybpc3 forms a third actomyosin interaction competing with the ELC N-

568

terminus ratchet (Fig 1) implies a new strain-dependent mechanism outside myosin that

569

contributes to motor adaptation to load. Our working models, and the integral myosin/mybpc3

570

motor concept, portends the wider considerations involved in understanding heart disease as a

571

systemic maladaptation.
