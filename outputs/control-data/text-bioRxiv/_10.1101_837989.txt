Abstract
The incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) increases with age and is a significant cause of
worldwide morbidity and mortality. However, the metabolic perturbations behind the onset of
AD remains unclear. In this study, we performed metabolite profiling in both brain (n = 109) and
matching serum samples (n = 566) to identify differentially expressed metabolites and metabolic
pathways associated with neuropathology and cognitive performance and to identify individuals
at high risk of developing cognitive impairment. The abundances of six metabolites, GLCA,
petroselinic acid, linoleic acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, and palmitoleic acid as well as the
DCA/CA ratio, along with the dysregulation scores of three metabolic pathways, primary bile
acid biosynthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids showed
significant differences in diagnostic groups across both brain and serum (P-value < 0.05).
Significant associations were observed between the levels of differential metabolites/pathways
and cognitive performance, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuritic plaque burden. Metabolites
abundances and personalized metabolic pathways scores were used to derive machine learning
models that could be used to differentiate cognitively impaired persons from those without
cognitive impairment (median of AUC = 0.772 for the metabolite level model; median of AUC =
0.731 for the pathway level model). Utilizing these two models on the entire baseline control
group, we identified those who experienced cognitive decline (AUC = 0.804, sensitivity = 0.722,
specificity = 0.749 for the metabolite level model; AUC = 0.778, sensitivity = 0.633, specificity
= 0.825 for the pathway level model) and demonstrated their pre-AD onset prediction potentials.
Our study provides a proof-of-concept that it is possible to discriminate antecedent cognitive
impairment in older adults before the onset of overt clinical symptoms using metabolomics. Our

findings, if validated in future studies, could enable the earlier detection and intervention of
cognitive impairment that may halt its progression.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the top 10 leading cause of death in the United States, is a
challenge for health care systems resulting in increased economic burden as the population
ages1,2. Currently, there is no therapy to prevent or slow AD progression, which may be due to
the inability to detect AD before its progression into evident cognitive decline. Identification of
early biomarkers associated with preclinical symptoms would allow the development of early
intervention or preventive strategies3. Multiple neurochemical perturbations have been identified
in AD, including amyloid precursor protein metabolism, phosphorylation of tau protein, and a
wide range of metabolic perturbations4. Unfortunately, current biomarkers for early disease,
including cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid and tau levels5, structural and functional magnetic
resonance imaging6, the recent use of brain amyloid imaging7 or inflammaging8, and spinal fluid
markers to track brain atrophy and deposition of cortical beta-amyloid and neurofibrillary
tangles, are limited because they are either invasive, time-consuming, or expensive.
Recent studies have focused on obtaining biomarkers to identify features that differentiate
subjects with cognitive impairment from elderly persons without cognitive impairment.
Molecular markers sensitive to the underlying pathogenic factors will be highly relevant to early
disease detection and facilitation of disease monitoring and treatment responses. Metabolomics is
an unbiased approach to study small-molecule metabolites that offers hope for the discovery of
more biomarkers for AD. This profiling technology has already been used to identify differential
metabolites that can distinguish mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects who will develop AD

from stable MCI9. Mounting evidence suggests that AD is closely accompanied with the
abnormal bile acid (BA) metabolism10–13, free fatty acid (FFA) metabolism14,15,26, lipid
metabolism16,17 and neurotransmitter metabolism18 . BAs are increasingly recognized as
important metabolic signaling molecules that modulate lipid, glucose, and energy metabolism19.
More importantly, BAs in the brain act as neuroactive steroids20. Different classes of BAs can
either inhibit or potentiate GABAα, or inhibit NMDA receptors while also exerting
neuroprotective effects 21,22. Recent cross-sectional studies have shown differences in blood BAs
in AD patients compared with non-cognitively impaired individuals23,24. Additionally, compared
to control mice, researchers found an accumulation of FFAs in the hippocampus and cortex of
AD mice25. Alterations of FFAs have been detected in postmortem AD brain tissues14 and serum
samples26, which may indicate a switch to an alternative fuel source before the onset of clinical
symptoms27. These observations give rise to the possibility that metabolic perturbations could
presage the onset of cognitive impairment and therefore aid in the identification of individuals
with higher risks by providing additional information to use with standard clinical markers.
In this study, we performed a metabolite profiling in participants from a large, longitudinal
cohort, with the goal of identifying metabolic changes as well as key metabolic pathways that
might also serve as new predictors of future cognitive impairment in older adults.

Materials and Methods
Participants
Study data from the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center (RADC) Religious Orders Study (ROS)
and Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) were downloaded from the RADC Data Sharing
Hub (https://www.radc.rush.edu/home.htm). A variety of clinical, demographic, and other

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/837989; this version posted November 12, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

variables are available through RADC (https://www.radc.rush.edu/docs/var/variables.htm), while
omics datasets generated from biospecimens donated by ROS and MAP participants are made
available through the AMP-AD Knowledge Portal. The ROS, which began in 1994, is a
longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort study of risk factors of cognitive decline and incident
dementia run from the RADC that is comprised of individuals from religious communities (e.g.,
Catholic brothers, nuns, and priests) across the USA28,29. The Rush MAP, which began in 1997,
includes participants from northeastern Illinois, USA with a broader range of socioeconomic
status and life experiences29. Participants in both studies enroll without known dementia, agree to
annual clinical evaluation, and organ donation. Both studies were approved by an Intuitional
Review Board of Rush University Medical Center. All subjects signed an informed consent, an
Anatomic Gift Act, and a repository consent to allow their biospecimens and data to be used for
ancillary studies. Both studies are conducted by the same team of examiners and share a large
common core of data collection at the item level to allow for efficient merging of data.

Cognitive performance tests
Cognitive function was measured using a battery of 21 cognitive tests, 19 of which are used to
measure five cognitive domains (i.e., episodic memory, working memory, semantic memory,
perceptual orientation/visuospatial ability, and perceptual speed) (Table S1). Raw scores from
each cognitive test are converted to z-scores and averaged to create a global cognitive
performance measure using the mean and standard deviation at baseline (M=0, SD=1). For each
domain, scores are created by averaging the z-scores which are based on mean and standard
deviation from all baseline data. Additionally, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)
served as a global measure of cognitive function.

Clinical diagnoses
Medical conditions were documented via self-report and clinical evaluation. Clinical diagnoses
each year were determined blinded to previously collected data. A three-step process for all
clinical diagnoses starts with an actuarial decision tree based on the history of cognitive decline
and impairment ratings in five cognitive domains based on cutoffs for 11 cognitive tests30. Then
clinical judgment by a neuropsychologist for cognitive impairment and determination of
dementia and its causes by a clinician (i.e., neurologist, geriatrician, second neuropsychologist,
geriatric nurse practitioner)31. The diagnosis of AD follows the criteria of the National Institute
of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and
Related Disorders Association (NINCDS/ADRDA)32. Participants were categorized as a) AD, b)
MCI if diagnosed with cognitive impairment by the neuropsychologist but not diagnosed
dementia by the clinician30, and c) no cognitive impairment (NCI) if diagnosed without AD or
MCI33. At the time of death, a final diagnosis is rendered by a clinician blinded to postmortem
data using all clinical data.

Neuropathology
Upon death, a postmortem neuropathological evaluation is implemented, and procedures follow
those outlined by the pathologic dataset recommended by the National Alzheimer’s Disease
Coordinating Center. Brains of deceased subjects were removed, weighed, cut into one cm-thick
coronal slabs and stored. Each brain was examined for the neuropathological indices of common
pathologies that contribute to cognitive impairment. The location, age, and volume of all
macroscopic infarcts were recorded, and tissue was obtained for histological confirmation, in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/837989; this version posted November 12, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

addition to the identification of microscopic infarctions, as previously described 34,35. AD
pathology was identified using the modified Bielschowsky silver stain technique and by use of
the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) criteria36 and NIAReagan criteria37, while the assessment of neurofibrillary tangles was based on Braak criteria38 as
described previously39. The CERAD score, a semi-quantitative measure of neuritic plaque
burden, is made of 4 levels: 4 = no AD, 3 = possible AD, 2 = probable AD and 1 = definite AD.
As recommended, CERAD scores were reclassified to a binary level: score 1~2, score 3~4.
Seven categories of Braak stages were based on the region and severity of neurofibrillary tangles
pathology.

Metabolites quantification
Using targeted metabolomics protocols40 and profiling protocols41 established in previous
studies, BAs were quantified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography triple quadrupole
mass spectrometry (UPLC-TQMS) (Waters XEVO TQ-S, Milford, USA) and other metabolites
were quantified by gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) (Leco
Corporation, St Joseph, USA). Details are described in the Supporting Information.

Statistical analysis
Stratifying by clinical diagnosis, continuous demographic variables were expressed as mean
(standard deviation (SD)) and tested by Wilcoxon rank-sum test, while categorical demographic
variables were expressed as n (percentage) and tested by Chi-square test. Missing values in
quantitative metabolites due to limits of quantification were regarded as left-censored missing
and imputed by GSimp42,43. Individual BA concentrations were normalized to the total BAs

concentration (i.e., the proportion of total BAs). Metabolites were reported as median (25%
quantile, 75% quantile) and tested by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Due to the limited sample size of
the AD group (11 participants) in serum samples, we combined MCI and AD participants into an
aggregate group (MCI/AD) for the following data analysis. Log-transformed abundances were
used in the following data analysis. We additionally generated 12 BA ratios based on the BA
metabolic pathway topology.
To identify metabolites differentially expressed in participants with dementia and cognition, we
used ordinal logistic regression to compare metabolites across three groups (NCI, MCI, AD) for
brain samples and logistic regression across two groups (NCI, MCI/AD) for serum samples. The
relationships between log-transformed brain metabolites levels with neurofibrillary tangle burden
and neuritic plaque burden were expressed as boxplots across Braak scores (Kruskal-Wallis test)
and CERAD scores (Wilcoxon rank-sum test), respectively. Using Spearman’s rank correlation
test, we further evaluated the associations between the abundances of each identified metabolite
and the global cognitive function score in both brain and serum samples. Linear regression
models with each individual metabolite used as the predictor and each cognitive test as the
response variable (adjusted for age, sex, years of education and presence of APOE ε4) were used
to test the associations between metabolite and cognitive function. Similar analyses with an
additional adjustment of BMI were conducted for serum samples. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test
was carried out to explore whether identified variables were differentially expressed between
NCI (converters) vs. NCI (non-converters), and between NCI (converters) vs. MCI/AD in sera.
Then, we built a random forest (RF) predictive model to differentiate NCI (non-converters) vs.
MCI/AD using glycolithocholate (GLCA), deoxycholate/cholate (DCA/CA) ratio, petroselinic
acid, linoleic acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, and age as the predictors.

To differentiate MCI/AD vs. NCI (non-converters), we randomly split the data into 70%
(training set) and 30% (testing set) 100 times. Each time, we trained an RF model on the training
set to differentiate the MCI/AD from NCI (non-converters) and evaluated it on the testing set
using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity (SE), and
specificity (SP). A final model was built on the whole NCI (non-converters) and MCI/AD data.
To investigate the pre-clinical predictive potentials as well as to validate the classification
performance of our model, we utilized this model on the whole baseline NCI group to identify
those NCI (converters) from NCI (non-converters). The differences of RF scores between NCI
(non-converters) vs. NCI (converters), between NCI (non-converters) vs. MCI/AD group were
tested by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. To determine whether RF scores could independently
differentiate NCI (converters) from NCI (non-converters) in the presence of potential
confounders, we used the logistic regression method with RF scores as the predictor adjusting for
sex, years of education, APOE ε4, and BMI. We additionally fitted linear mixed effects models
to evaluate correlations between RF scores with global cognitive function and each of the five
cognitive domains separately with a random effects term for education level, BMI and fixed
effects terms for RF score, sex, and APOE ε4.
For the personalized pathway level analyses, we extracted metabolite information from the
Human Metabolome Database (HMDB)44 and metabolic pathway information from the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database45 to map affiliated metabolites to
metabolic pathways. We used the pathifier algorithm46 to transfer metabolic level information of
each sample to pathway level by generating a pathway dysregulation score (PDS). For each
pathway, each sample was projected onto a directed principal curve47, which was yielded
depending on leading principal components of the pathway, to optimally pass through the cloud

of samples. PDS was the distance along the curve between the projection of each sample and that
of NCI. Thus, PDS could capture the pathway-level extent of abnormality (increments or
decrements) for each participant relative to those with NCI. We performed similar data analysis
on pathway level data to what we did on metabolomics level data. We tried to identify
differential pathways using ordinal logistic regression across NCI, MCI, and AD groups in brain
samples and logistic regression for NCI and MCI/AD in serum samples. Next, we explored the
associations between identified pathways with neuropathology (Kruskal-Wallis test for Braak
scores, Wilcoxon rank-sum test for CERAD scores) and cognitive performance (Spearman’s
rank correlation test for global cognitive function, linear regression with adjustments for each
cognitive test). Then, we examined the predictive potential of identified pathways in serum
samples using univariate analysis (Wilcoxon rank-sum test for NCI (converters) vs. NCI (nonconverters), NCI (converters) vs. MCI/AD). Finally, we built RF models on 70% training sets
and tested them on 30% testing sets according to 100 times random splitting on the model
construction data, and applied the final model on the validation data using ROC, SE, SP as
evaluation methods.
Data were analyzed using R version 3.5.1 with packages including pROC, pathifier,
randomForest, ggplot2, ggsignif, and MASS. The statistically significance was determined by a
threshold of p values < 0.05.

Results
Participants and characteristics
For the joint analyses of the ROS/MAP study, we measured metabolomics of 566 serum samples
(446 NCI, 109 MCI, and 11 AD at the time of blood draw) and 109 postmortem brain tissues

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/837989; this version posted November 12, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (51 NCI, 31 MCI, and 27 AD at the time of death). A total
of 92 participants had both brain and blood metabolomics data. NCI participants (n=446) are
further categorized into 90 “NCI (converters)” and 356 “NCI (non-converters)”. NCI
(converters) were those participants who were NCI at the time of blood draw and then
experienced cognitive decline (MCI or AD), while NCI (non-converters) were participants who
remained cognitively normal over follow-up. Detailed demographic characteristics of the serum
samples and postmortem brain samples are included in Table 1. Among participants with
postmortem brain samples, AD patients were more likely to have least one APOE ε4 allele
compared to the NCI group as expected. The mean age of NCI and MCI/AD group at the time of
blood draw among serum samples was 80.77 years (SD: 7.37) and 86.30 (SD: 6.26),
respectively. Similarly, the age and the percentage of APOE ε4 carriers were higher in the NCI
(converters) group than the NCI (non-converters) group. We did not observe other significant
demographic characteristics differences across clinical groups (Table 1).

Identifying metabolites differentially expressed in participants with cognitive impairment
In this study, 177 metabolites and 164 metabolites (129 overlapping metabolites) were detected
in brain tissues and serum samples, respectively (Table S7, Table S8). Amino acids, BAs,
carbohydrates, organic acids, and fatty acids were the predominant types of annotated
metabolites (accounted for 84.17% of all the metabolites in brain tissues, and 84.75% in serum
samples) (Fig. 1a, 1b, left panel). A total of 7 metabolites (1 BA, 1 BA ratio, 1 organic acid
known as a long-chain fatty acid, and 4 fatty acids) showed significant differences across clinical
groups in both brain and serum samples (P-value < 0.05, ordinal logistic regression for brain
samples, logistic regression for serum samples) (Fig. 1a, 1b, right panel). In brain tissues,

increments of the levels of GLCA, DCA/CA ratio, petroselinic acid, linoleic acid, myristic acid,
palmitic acid, and palmitoleic acid followed the pattern NCI<MCI<AD. We observed increments
of GLCA and DCA/CA ratio and decrements of petroselinic acid, linoleic acid, myristic acid,
palmitic acid, and palmitoleic acid in sera of MCI/AD compared to NCI (Table 2).
Previous findings were further validated in 92 individuals who have both brain and serum
samples. From NCI to MCI and AD groups, increments of identified metabolites were observed
in brain samples (Table S11). The increasing trend of GLCA, DCA/CA ratio and decreasing
trend of FFAs among MCI/AD group relative to the NCI group were detected in sera (Table
S11).
The seven brain metabolites were all negatively correlated with global cognitive function where
higher scores indicate better cognitive performance (ρ = -0.091 for GLCA; ρ = -0.21 for
DCA/CA ratio, ρ = -0.16 for petroselinic acid, ρ = -0.25 for linoleic acid, ρ = -0.22 for myristic
acid, ρ = -0.2 for palmitic acid, and ρ = -0.26 for palmitoleic acid) using Spearman’s rank
correlation analysis (Fig. 2a). Similarly, after adjusting for age, sex, years of education and
APOE ε4, all identified metabolites remained negatively correlated with tests in five cognitive
domains and the MMSE (see Table S2 for significant correlation pairs). The serum concentration
of two BAs showed negative correlations with global cognitive function (ρ = -0.074 for GLCA; ρ
= -0.075 for DCA/CA ratio), conversely fatty acids demonstrated positive correlations (ρ = 0.17
for petroselinic acid, ρ = 0.13 for linoleic acid, ρ = 0.13 for myristic acid, ρ = 0.11 for palmitic
acid, and ρ = 0.17 for palmitoleic acid) (Fig. 2b). Linear regression revealed similar, consistent
results in serum samples with adjustment for age, sex, years of education, APOE ε4, and BMI
(see Table S2). Results of associations between identified metabolites/ratio and each cognitive
domain are shown in Table S13. Correlations with global cognitive function were further

validated in 92 individuals with both brain and serum samples and the directions were consistent
with our previous findings among the all subjects. Seven identified metabolites were all
negatively correlated with global cognitive function in brain samples, while two BAs showed
negative correlations and five FFAs showed positive correlations in serum samples (Fig. S6).
Additionally, the serum/brain ratio of identified FFAs were positively correlated with global
cognitive test (a.k.a., lower levels of identified FFAs in serum and higher levels of identified
FFAs in brain were associated with worse cognition) (Fig. S7).

Identified metabolites predicted antecedent cognitive impairment before the manifestation of
clinical symptoms
The concentrations of GLCA and DCA/CA were significantly lower in the NCI (non-converters)
group than in the NCI (converters) group. By contrast, the abundances of petroselinic acid,
linoleic acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, and palmitoleic acid were higher in the NCI (nonconverters) group than in the NCI (converters) group (Fig. 3a). There were no significant
differences in these metabolites between participants in NCI (converters) group vs. MCI/AD
group (Fig. 3a). Using the seven metabolites and age, we built RF models on the 70% training set
according to 100-times randomly splitting approach to differentiate MCI/AD patients from NCI
(non-converters) group. The median of 100 times AUC on 30% testing set was 0.772 (95% CIs =
0.763-0.781) with 0.786 SE (95% CIs = 0.767-0.804) and 0.716 SP (95% CIs = 0.695-0.737)
using Youden's index to maximize the sum of SE and SP (Fig. 3b). RF models showed decent
classification performances in differentiating MCI/AD group from NCI (non-converters).
Next, we were interested in studying the model’s early diagnostic capability for predicting NCI
(converters) before clinical diagnosis. The model was thus applied on the whole NCI group at

baseline to differentiate NCI (converters) from NCI (non-converters). We achieved an AUC of
0.804 (95% CIs = 0.749-0.859, SE = 0.722, SP = 0.749 at the cutoff value of 0.357) (Fig. 3c)
with significant differences in RF scores between NCI (converters) vs. NCI (non-converters),
between NCI (non-converters) vs. MCI/AD group using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (P-value <
0.001) (Fig. 3d). After further adjustment for sex, years of education, APOE ε4, and BMI, the RF
scores remained significant (as an independent predictor) with a coefficient of 6.994 (P value <
0.001) (Table S3). Additionally, the RF scores showed significant negative correlations with
global cognitive function and five cognitive domains with same adjustment in mixed effects
models (Table S12).

Personalized metabolic pathway-based study for the association and prediction of cognitive
impairment
Considering altered metabolite levels were significantly associated with cognitive impairment
and showed early predictive value of clinical symptoms onset, we then employed the pathifier
algorithm to summarize metabolite information to pathways level for further examinations. All
PDS scores range from 0 to 1, where larger scores represent the higher extent of the abnormality
in the corresponding metabolic pathway. A large number of metabolites (109/177 metabolites in
brain tissues and 102/164 metabolites in sera) were successfully mapped to the KEGG metabolic
pathways. This method identified 52 metabolic pathways in brain tissues and 45 metabolic
pathways in serum samples (44 overlapping pathways) (Fig. S1a, S1b, left panel; Table S9,
Table S10), three of which (i.e., primary BAs biosynthesis, FFAs biosynthesis, and biosynthesis
of unsaturated FFAs) were significantly shifted in both brain and serum samples (P-value < 0.05,
ordinal logistic regression for brain samples, logistic regression for serum samples) (Fig. S1a,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/837989; this version posted November 12, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

S1b, right panel). We noted increased PDS for all three identified pathways from NCI to
MCI/AD that suggested dysregulation of these metabolic pathways in MCI/AD patients compare
to NCI. Detailed PDS of these pathways stratified by diagnostic groups are described in Table
S4. Results also indicated that higher PDS were significantly associated with lower global
cognitive function (i.e., worse cognitive performance) in both brain (ρ = -0.16 for primary BAs
biosynthesis pathway, ρ = -0.23 for FFAs biosynthesis pathway, ρ = -0.26 for biosynthesis of
unsaturated FFAs pathway) (Fig. S4) and serum samples (ρ = -0.16 for primary BAs
biosynthesis pathway, ρ = -0.13 for FFAs biosynthesis pathway, ρ = -0.14 for biosynthesis of
unsaturated FFAs pathway) (Fig. S5) respectively. In Table S5, we show the significant negative
associations between each cognitive test and PDS of 3 pathways after adjusting for age, sex,
years of education, and APOE ε4 (further adjustment for BMI in serum samples). Two fatty acid
pathways showed significantly different PDS between the NCI (non-converters) group and the
NCI (converters) group (P-value = 0.0012, and P-value < 0.001), respectively. A gradually
increasing trend was noted for the BAs pathway across groups (i.e., NCI (non-converters) < NCI
(converters) and MCI/AD) (Fig. 4a).
We then constructed a discriminant RF model in 70% training data and tested on 30 testing data
based on three identified metabolic pathways along with age to differentiate MCI/AD from NCI
(non-converters) in model construction data using 100-times randomly splitting approach. The
median AUC on testing set was 0.731 (95% CIs = 0.723-0.739) with 0.750 SE (95% CIs =
0.727-0.773) and 0.662 SP (95% CIs = 0.637-0.687) (Fig. 4b). Applying the RF model to the
whole NCI data at baseline could successfully discriminate NCI (converters) from NCI (nonconverters) with an AUC of 0.778 (95% CIs = 0.721-0.834), SE = 0.633, SP = 0.825, cutoff
value = 0.457 (Fig. 4c). Similarly, predictive RF scores were significantly different between NCI

(converters) vs. NCI (non-converters), and NCI (non-converters) vs. MCI/AD group (P-value <
0.001) (Fig. 4d). After adjusting for sex, years of education, APOE ε4, and BMI, the RF scores
remained statistically significant as an independent predictor with a coefficient of 5.294 (P-value
< 0.001) (Table S6).

Identified metabolites and metabolic pathway were associated with neuropathology
Notably, we observed significant differences (gradually increasing trend) of metabolite
abundances in brain tissue across five Braak score groups: DCA/CA ratio (P-value = 0.021),
petroselinic acid (P-value = 0.038), linoleic acid (P-value = 0.041), palmitic acid (P-value =
0.043), and palmitoleic acid (P-value = 0.038) (Fig. S8a). Consistently, the abundance of six
metabolites in the brain were higher in the CERAD AD group (score 1~2) than the CERAD nonAD group (score 3~4): GLCA (P-value = 0.041), petroselinic acid (P-value = 0.014), linoleic
acid (P-value < 0.001), myristic acid (P-value = 0.015), palmitic acid (P-value = 0.026), and
palmitoleic acid (P-value = 0.0019) (Fig. S8b). Brain PDS of identified pathways were gradually
increased across five Braak score groups, where the biosynthesis of unsaturated FFAs pathway
differed with statistical significance (P-value = 0.036) (Fig. S2). Higher brain PDS were
associated with a significantly greater risk of neuritic plaque burden based on CERAD criteria:
primary BAs biosynthesis (P-value = 0.04), FFAs biosynthesis (P-value = 0.028), and
biosynthesis of unsaturated FFAs (P-value = 0.0089) (Fig. S3).

Discussion
The alternations of metabolic profiles, especially in the brain of MCI and AD patients have not
been extensively studied. In our study, we comprehensively measured 164 and 177 metabolites

in serum and brain samples, respectively. Our findings showed six significantly differential
metabolites and one ratio in both brain and serum samples (petroselinic acid, linoleic acid,
myristic acid, palmitic acid, and palmitoleic acid, GLCA, and DCA/CA ratio). The identified
metabolites/ratio showed consistent associations with neuropathology results, and cognitive tests
regardless of adjustments for potential confounding factors (i.e., age, sex, years of education,
APOE ε4, and BMI). Additionally, these metabolites demonstrated group differences of NCI
(converter) vs. NCI (non-converter) within baseline normal controls which indicated their
potential predictive values. A personalized pathway-level analysis further demonstrated our
findings of FFAs and BAs metabolic perturbations among cognitively impaired patients and the
predictive values of using personalized pathway information.
Altered FAs profiles were found in different regions of brain tissue in AD patients and linked to
neuropathology and cognitive performance14. Our study showed five significant increments of
brain FFAs, while decrements of these FFAs appeared in the serum of AD patients. The
serum/brain ratio of identified FFAs were positively correlated with global cognitive test (i.e.,
lower levels of identified FFAs in serum and higher levels of identified FFAs in brain were
associated with worse cognition) (Fig. S7).
Our findings are consistent with prior observations in AD mice that the significant accumulation
of FFAs in the hippocampus and cortex, including palmitoleic acid, palmitic acid, and linoleic
acid, might be associated with the utilization of FFAs in brain25. It is well-known that brain is
one of the most energy-demanding organs with a high glycolytic catabolizing rate of glucose
consumption. The energy supply shift from glucose towards alternative energy sources (e.g.,
ketone bodies and FFAs) has been observed in other neuropsychiatric conditions48 (Fig. 5). More
interestingly, in the early stage of AD reduced glucose utilization and metabolic dysfunction can

be detected using FDG-PET, which is one of the earliest detectable symptoms of the disease49.
The metabolic instability with decreased glucose utilization in impaired neurons among AD
patients occurs up to twenty years prior to the onset of clinical symptoms indicating that
metabolic decline may contribute to the development of cognitive impairment 50. Previous studies
suggested that fatty acid can across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via simple diffusion. At the
same time, fatty acid transport proteins are also involved in this process. Fatty acid binding
protein 5 (FABP-5), fatty acid transport proteins-1 (FATP-1), FATP-4 and fatty acid translocase
(CD36) are the key FFA transport proteins and these transporters are expressed in human brain
microvessel endothelial cells (HBMEC)51. The significant decrement of the movement for many
FFAs (including linoleic acid, myristic acid, and palmitic acid) from apical medium to the
basolateral medium across HBMEC monolayer with the knockdown of these FFA transport
proteins was observed51. Additionally, many studies demonstrated that the CD36 gene is
associated with AD52,53, and the BBB damage may also facilitate the transferring of FFAs from
blood to brain in AD patients54.
In addition to the FFAs dysregulation, the association between cholesterol metabolism and AD
leads to substantial research interests of how BAs profile changes in cognitively impaired
individuals and AD patients55. Furthermore, BAs play a major role in regulating energy
homeostasis through binding to nuclear receptors and both primary and secondary BAs can
across the BBB via a gut-liver-brain axis56,57. In this study, we observed one secondary
conjugated BA (i.e., GLCA) and one primary-secondary BAs ratio (DCA/CA) increased in both
serum and brain tissue in MCI/AD patients compared to NCI, which was consistent with
previous findings12. Primary BAs are synthesized in the liver from cholesterol and are then biotransformed into secondary BAs by the gut microbiota (Fig. 5). The observed increasing

DCA/CA ratio here might suggest a dysfunction of bacterial 7α-dehydroxylases which leads to
the accumulation of cytotoxic secondary bile acids. Similarly, GLCA, another cytotoxic BA, was
increased in our study. The survival analysis conducted by MahmoudianDehkordi et al. on MCI
conversion to AD showed significantly changed prognostic endpoints when splitting samples
into different groups according to BA levels12, which also suggested that the total BAs/BA ratios
could serve as potential predictors for the conversion of ADs among non-AD clinical groups.
This study has limitations. First, the sample size of brain tissues in this study is relatively
limited due to the study design which required available ante-mortem MRI. Additional work
with a larger number of brain tissues is ongoing. Second, the current serum metabolomics data is
cross-sectional therefore precluding explorations of changes in the serum metabolome changes
over time. Third, although we validated our prediction models on the whole NCI group to show
its additional predictive values in differentiating NCI (converters) from NCI (non-converters),
more external validation data are needed to validate our results. Fourth, our findings suggest the
emerging role for gut microbiome in the development of AD. Thus, further experimental
microbiota studies could provide a better understand of how the gut-brain axis plays a role in AD
development. Last, since our results provide a proof-of-concept for the feasibility of early
detection among NCI subjects at high risk of developing cognitive impairment, future clinical
studies should be designed to explore the benefits of early interventions. The study also has
strengths in that the follow-up and autopsy rates in the parent cohorts are very high leading to
excellent internal validity. The diagnostic groups were comparable as they came from a single
larger cohort.
Collectively, our findings present a new point of view into the pre-clinical evolution of AD and
lend strength to the hypothesis that individuals with higher risks of cognitive impairment can be

identified before the development of overt symptoms via a metabolomics approach. To this end,
we provide two predictive models: one based on differentially expressed metabolites and the
other on identified metabolic pathways. Varma et al. utilized machine learning approaches to
identify potential metabolites related to AD pathology and progression17. We took their work one
step further by constructing machine learning models to discriminant the final-state healthy
controls vs. MCI/AD patients. The 100 times resampling results demonstrated the feasibility and
robustness of our predictive models. Particularly, by employing our models on the baseline
group, we successfully identified the high-risk subgroup (i.e., NCI (converters)) several years
before the clinical diagnosis.

Figure 5. Pathways involved in FFAs and BAs.
Healthy neurons are highly glycolytic, catabolizing rate of glucose consumption through the
glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle to produce ATP. Reduced glucose utilization and
metabolic dysfunction could be detected using FDG-PET and metabolomics approaches in AD
patients.
The metabolic instability with decreased glucose utilization in impaired neurons can cause the
energy supply shift towards alternative energy sources, e.g., FFAs and ketone bodies. Primary
BAs are synthesized in the liver from cholesterol. A dysfunction of gut microbiome can cause
the accumulation of cytotoxic secondary bile acids, e.g., DCA and GLCA, which can be secreted
into the systemic circulation and then across the blood-brain barrier to enter the brain.
