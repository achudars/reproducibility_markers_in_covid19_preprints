DNA sequence is a major determinant
of tetrasome dynamics
O. Ordu, A. Lusser, and N. H. Dekker

ABSTRACT
Eukaryotic genomes are hierarchically organized into protein-DNA assemblies for compaction into the nucleus.
Nucleosomes, with the (H3-H4)2 tetrasome as a likely intermediate, are highly dynamic in nature by way of
several different mechanisms. We have recently shown that tetrasomes spontaneously change the direction of
their DNA wrapping between left- and right-handed conformations, which may prevent torque build-up in
chromatin during active transcription or replication. DNA sequence has been shown to strongly affect
nucleosome positioning throughout chromatin. It is not known, however, whether DNA sequence also impacts
the dynamic properties of tetrasomes. To address this question, we examined tetrasomes assembled on a highaffinity DNA sequence using freely orbiting magnetic tweezers. In this context, we also studied the effects of
mono- and divalent salts on the flipping dynamics. We found that neither DNA sequence nor altered buffer
conditions affect overall tetrasome structure. In contrast, tetrasomes bound to high-affinity DNA sequences
showed significantly altered flipping kinetics, predominantly via a reduction in the lifetime of the canonical
state of left-handed wrapping. Increased mono- and divalent salt concentrations counteracted this behaviour.
Thus, our study indicates that high-affinity DNA sequences impact not only the positioning of the nucleosome,
but that they also endow the subnucleosomal tetrasome with enhanced conformational plasticity. This may
provide a means to prevent histone loss upon exposure to torsional stress, thereby contributing to the integrity
of chromatin at high-affinity sites.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
Canonical (H3-H4)2 tetrasomes possess high conformational flexibility, as evidenced by their spontaneous
flipping between states of left- and right-handed DNA wrapping. Here, we show that these conformational
dynamics of tetrasomes cannot be described by a fixed set of rates over all conditions. Instead, an accurate
description of their behavior must take into account details of their loading, in particular the underlying DNA
sequence. In vivo, differences in tetrasome flexibility could be regulated by modifications of the histone core or
the tetrasomal DNA, and as such constitute an intriguing, potentially adjustable mechanism for chromatin to
accommodate the torsional stress generated by processes such as transcription and replication.
INTRODUCTION
The nucleosome is the basic complex of chromatin in eukaryotic cells (1-3). It comprises 147 base pairs (bp) of
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) wrapped around a disk-shaped assembly of eight histone proteins in ~1.7 turns (46). The histone octamer consists of two copies of two types of heterodimers, one of which is formed by
histones H3 and H4, and the other by histones H2A and H2B (7,8). During nucleosome formation, first the two
H3-H4 dimers assemble onto the DNA to form a tetrasome, after which the binding of two H2A/H2B dimers
completes the full nucleosome (9). The resulting compaction upon DNA wrapping limits the accessibility of the
genome for essential cellular processes, such as transcription, replication and repair. Hence, the positioning
and stability of nucleosomes play a key role in gene regulation and cellular function.
Recent research has provided significant new insights into the structure and especially the dynamics of
nucleosomes (10). For example, studies using single-molecule techniques have revealed the intrinsically
dynamic nature of nucleosomes in the form of ‘breathing’, i.e. the transient un- and rewrapping of the

nucleosomal DNA ends (11-14). Nucleosomes were also found to ‘gap’ by transiently opening and closing the
two turns of nucleosomal DNA along the direction of the superhelical axis (15). The structure, stability and
dynamics of nucleosomes have furthermore been shown to be extensively regulated by post-translational
modifications (16), chaperones (17), and ATP-dependent remodelers (18). Furthermore, nucleosome
composition and dynamics can be altered by forces and torques generated by molecular motors that process
the genome (19,20). Such external influences, as well as changes in the ambient conditions, can cause
nucleosomes to reorganize into different (sub)structures (21). Specifically, tetrasomes, which wrap ~80 bp of
DNA around the (H3-H4)2 tetramer (Figure 1A), have been observed as stable intermediates in several studies
(22-28). Similar to nucleosomes, tetrasomes predominantly adopt a left-handed DNA wrapping, but
interestingly, right-handed DNA wrapping has also been identified (29-34). Recently, we showed that
tetrasomes can spontaneously switch between these two conformations without unbinding from the DNA (3537) (Figure 2A). This conformational flexibility could mitigate the build-up of torsional stress in chromatin
during e.g. transcription or replication and thereby prevent the eviction of histones from the DNA.
DNA sequence has been suggested to play an important role in determining the structural and dynamic
properties of nucleosomes (38). The formation of a nucleosome is significantly affected by the ability of the
underlying DNA to bend sharply (39,40). This feature has not only been examined in numerous in vitro studies
(41), but it has also been observed at a global level in vivo (42). For example, in yeast it was shown that ~50% of
the in vivo nucleosome positions can be attributed to sequence-specific features. In particular, high-affinity
nucleosome binding sequences were found to be enriched in intergenic regions where an integral chromatin
structure is important, while low affinity sequences were most dominant in highly transcribed regions, such as
rRNA and tRNA genes (42). High-affinity sequences were also detected in strongly regulated genes, and it was
proposed that such sequences may favour rapid reassembly of nucleosomes promoting repression of these
genes under unfavourable conditions (42).
While structure and dynamics of high-affinity nucleosomes have also been studied extensively by in vitro
single-molecule assays (43-48), an interesting open question is whether association of histones with highaffinity DNA sequences affects the dynamics of subnucleosomal structures, such as (H3-H4)2 tetrasomes, which
can arise in the course of transcription or other torque-generating processes. In this work we have addressed
this question by a single molecule approach. Using freely-orbiting magnetic tweezers (FOMT) (49), we
systematically investigated the structure and handedness dynamics of single (H3.1-H4)2 tetrasomes assembled
onto the well-characterized high-affinity Widom 601 nucleosome-binding sequence (50). In addition, we have
examined the contribution of different buffers commonly employed in chromatin studies (51-53) to the
dynamics of high-affinity tetrasomes. Our results revealed intriguing effects of DNA sequence on handedness
flipping dynamics that can be counteracted by mono- and divalent salts. Thus, our findings provide conceptual
evidence for a model in which chromatin regions containing high-affinity nucleosomes may be better protected
than other regions from complete histone loss during torque-generating processes, such as transcription or
replication, due to inherently increased handedness flipping dynamics of (H3-H4)2 tetrasomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Preparation of DNA molecules
Tetrasome assembly was performed on linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) fragments of 1.96 kilo-base pair
(kbp) length containing a single 601-sequence of 147 bp at their center. The two ends of the DNA fragments
were ligated to digoxigenin-coated (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) or biotin-coated (Roche Diagnostics)
double-stranded fragments (handle) of 643 bp length, respectively, for immobilization and tethering. The
schematics, sequence, and preparation of the DNA molecules are described in Supplementary Figure S1 and
Supplementary Table SI. Further details on the handles have been described in Ref. (37).

Expression and purification of proteins
The recombinant canonical Drosophila histones H3.1-H4 and nucleosome assembly protein-1 (NAP1)
chaperones were expressed and purified as described in Ref. (35) and Ref. (37). While in vivo NAP1 has been
identified as a chaperone for histones H2A and H2B (54), in vitro it has been found to also interact with
histones H3 and H4 and prevent histone aggregation (35-37,55-60).
Preparation of histones and tetrasome assembly
Individual tetrasomes were assembled and monitored in real time using magnetic tweezers (see below) in
three buffers with varying compositions of core components employed in previous studies (35-37,51-53) (Table
I). To allow for direct comparison to our previous study (35), the protein samples were prepared similarly, by
incubating 51 nanomolar (nM) of an equimolar solution of H3.1-H4 histones – either without or with 192 nM
NAP1 – on ice for 30 min. The incubation buffers were identical to the measurement buffers (Table I), except
for buffer A. In that case, the incubation buffer contained 0.25% (w/v) Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) and 0.25%
(w/v) Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA), and 0.1% (w/v) Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), as in our previous study (35). The
incubated protein solutions were then diluted by at most 1:5000, and 100 μl of the diluted solution was flushed
into the flow cell to assemble a single tetrasome. About 60 s after assembly, 100-300 μl of measurement buffer
was flushed through the flow cell to remove free proteins and to prevent further assembly of tetrasomes.
The details of the sample and flow cell preparation for magnetic tweezers experiments have been described in
Ref. (37). Where the concentrations and volumes of DNA and magnetic bead solutions used in this work differ,
this is stated in Supplementary Table SII. Five (out of total Nexp,total=20) experiments were performed by
resuming the measurement on a tetrasome that did not disassemble during a preceding experiment. Two such
experiments involved an exchange between buffers B and C (Table I) with 300-500 μl of the respective
measurement buffer: In one of these two experiments, a measurement was resumed in buffer C on a
tetrasome that had been assembled before in buffer B, and in the other the reverse procedure was employed.
Magnetic tweezers instrumentation
The assembly and dynamics of an individual tetrasome was monitored for up to 10 h by directly measuring the
length and angular position, i.e. the linking number, of a single DNA molecule in each experiment using FOMT
(49) (Figure 1B). The magnetic tweezers hardware is detailed in Ref. (37). All experiments were performed at
an exerted force of 0.6-0.7 piconewton (pN) and at room temperature (22 ºC).
Data analysis
The analysis of the acquired data was performed using custom-written scripts with built-in functions in Matlab
(Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). An improved version of the custom-written step-finder algorithm described in
Ref. (61) was used to detect stepwise changes in the time traces of the DNA length and DNA linking number.
Subsequently, these fits were analyzed to identify simultaneous steps in both DNA length and DNA linking
number within a time window of 19.1 s (see below), resulting from the assembly or disassembly of a tetrasome
(Figure 1C, Supplementary Figure S4). With this approach, 48% (n=13) of all such steps (N=27) were
automatically identified, while the remaining 52% (n=14) were corrected manually to better match the data.
The retrieved sizes of these simultaneous changes in DNA length (N=27) and DNA linking number (N=27) form
the basic quantities that characterize tetrasomes structure (Supplementary Tables SIII and SIV). Step sizes
were also compared to the mean spatial resolution, determined by averaging the standard deviations (STDs) of
the time trace profiles in all experiments (Figure 1D, Supplementary Figure S5).
The dynamics of tetrasome structure in terms of handedness flipping (Figure 2A) was separately analyzed in
the parts of the time traces with a stable baseline in DNA length and DNA linking number (Figure 2B,
Supplementary Figure S7). The change in DNA linking number upon flipping was determined by fitting a double
Gaussian function to the DNA linking number data (N=23; Figure 2B, Supplementary Table SIX, and
Supplementary Figure S7) and calculating the difference between the mean values. The probability for a

tetrasome to occupy one of the two states was calculated from the relative ratio of the corresponding peak
areas of the two Gaussian fits (Supplementary Table SXI).
The handedness dynamics of single, flipping (H3.1-H4)2 tetrasomes was further analyzed in terms of the times
spent in the left- or right-handed state using another custom-written algorithm based on Ref. (62). A threshold
zone was defined by 1 STDs from the mean values of the two Gaussian distributions about their average (Figure
2B, Supplementary Figure S7). The details of the dwell-time analysis have been described in Ref. (37). Here, the
corresponding DNA linking number data of the time traces of sufficiently long duration (>1600 s) were
smoothed by filtering over N=330 (N=1910) points, corresponding to a time average of τshort = 3.3 s (τlong = 19.1
s). These time scales were obtained from autocorrelation analysis of the bead’s angular fluctuations, as
described in Refs. (37,49) (Supplementary Figure S2). The mean dwell time in each state was then determined
by combining all datasets obtained in identical buffer conditions and fitting these to an exponential function
(Table II, Figure 3A-C, Supplementary Table SXII, and Supplementary Figure S8A-C). For direct comparison, we
also performed dwell-time analysis with the same settings on the partial time traces (N=6) of one of our earlier
experiments published in Ref. (35).
Further details of the data analysis have been described in Ref. (37). The significance of the similarity between
the structural quantities obtained in the different conditions was assessed by respective unpaired two-sample
t-tests (Supplementary Tables SV-SVIII and SX). The results for the dwell times obtained in the different
conditions were checked for similarity by respective Wilcoxon rank-sum tests (Supplementary Tables SXIIISXV). Finally, we note that the times measured in this study are an upper boundary due to the finite bead
response time. The errors reported for the mean values obtained in this study correspond to 1 STD from the
underlying distributions, unless indicated otherwise. The errors of calculated quantities were computed by
error propagation.
Construction of energy diagrams
To construct the schematic energy diagrams of the left- and right-handed states of tetrasomes (Figure 3D,
Supplementary Figure S8D), we have computed the free energy difference between them and estimated the
height of the barrier separating them. The free energy difference can be calculated from the ratio of the
probabilities pleft = p and pright = 1-p for a tetrasome to be in the left- and right-handed conformations,
respectively, using ΔEpeak areas = -kBTln((1-p)/p) (see Data Analysis above, and Supplementary Table SXI). It can
alternatively be computed from the ratio of the dwell times according to ΔEdwell-times = -kBTln(τD,right/τD,left). The
obtained results are summarized in Table II and Supplementary Table SXII. While the results from both
approaches agree within error, we consider the energy differences calculated from the dwell times as more
reliable due to the larger sample size. To estimate the height of the energy barrier ΔG* relative to the left- and
right-handed states of tetrasomes, we compute ΔG* = -kBTln(k/k0), where the transition rates kl->r and kr->l equal
the inverse of the dwell times τD,left and τD,right, respectively, and the transition rate between the two states at
7 -1
zero force k0 is assumed to be symmetric and estimated at ~10 s (37).
RESULTS
DNA sequence and buffer conditions do not affect the structural properties of tetrasomes
To assess whether high-affinity DNA sequences impact the formation and structure of tetrasomes, we loaded
(H3.1-H4)2 tetramers onto individual DNA molecules containing a single centrally positioned high-affinity 601sequence (DNAw/601) known for its strong nucleosome-positioning capability (50) with the help of the histone
chaperone NAP1. Using FOMT (49), tetrasome assembly was recorded in real time by tracking the length z and
linking number Θ of the DNA. In this setting, a single immobilized DNA molecule is tethered to a magnetic bead
that is subject to constant force applied by a cylindrical permanent magnet, allowing its free rotation in the
(x,y)-plane (Figure 1B). This force was set to 0.6-0.7 pN for direct comparison to our previous study of (H3.1-

H4)2 tetrasomes assembled by histone chaperone NAP1 on DNA molecules of random sequence (DNArandom)
(35).
As in our previous studies with DNArandom (35-37), flushing in pre-incubated histone/NAP1-complexes
(nexp,subset=9 out of total Nexp,total=20) induced a simultaneous step-like change in both the length z and linking
number Θ of DNAw/601, indicating the assembly of a single tetrasome (Figure 1C). The mean values of these
changes (Supplementary Table SIII) are in excellent agreement with those previously obtained for NAP1loaded (H3.1-H4)2 tetrasomes on DNArandom (35). Also in agreement with previous observations (35-37) is the
lack of observable interactions between NAP1 chaperones and DNA molecules in the absence of histones
(Supplementary Figure S3). To probe the effects of ambient conditions on tetrasome structure and dynamics,
we performed the experiments in three different buffers employed in prior studies (35-37,51-53) that mainly
differed in the concentrations of mono- and divalent salts (Table I) and obtained highly similar results
(Supplementary Table SIII). We also flushed in (H3.1-H4)2 tetramers in the absence of NAP1 (nexp,subset=11).
Thereby, DNAw/601 also exhibited a simultaneous step-like change in both measured quantities (Supplementary
Figure S4). The mean values of the changes in length z and linking number Θ (Supplementary Table SIII)
correspond excellently to those we obtained for (H3.1-H4)2 tetrasomes loaded by NAP1 onto DNAw/601, or onto
DNArandom (35). The similarity of these results, which were furthermore independent of buffer conditions,
indicate the formation of proper complexes in all cases. This was unexpected, since we never observed
tetrasome formation in the absence of NAP1 in previous studies using random DNA sequences (35-37). Thus,
the specific features of the high-affinity 601-sequence are capable of inducing spontaneous chaperoneindependent assembly of histone tetramers.
Under the highly diluted conditions required for the controlled assembly of single tetrasomes (Materials and
Methods), we also observed disassembly of tetrasomes in 40% (nexp,subset=8) of all experiments (Nexp,total=20)
within 3364 ± 765 s (mean ± 1 standard error of the mean (SEM); Supplementary Figure S6). The absolute
mean values of the disassembly-associated changes in DNA length z and linking number Θ (Supplementary
Table SIV) are in excellent agreement with those obtained upon assembly of tetrasomes (Supplementary Table
SIII). Because disassembly occurred for both NAP1-loaded and spontaneously loaded tetrasomes in all buffer
conditions, we can exclude a destabilizing effect of NAP1 and/or specific buffer conditions.
Given the similarity of the absolute changes in DNA length z and linking number Θ in all experiments in
different buffer conditions (Nexp,total=20) (as assessed by respective t-tests, Supplementary Tables SV-SVIII), all
results were grouped together to yield improved statistics. The absolute changes in DNA length z and DNA
linking number Θ upon assembly and disassembly of single tetrasomes (Ncounts,total=27) yielded mean values of
Δz(dis)ass = 23 ± 5 nm (ncounts,subset=25) and ΔΘ(dis)ass = 0.9 ± 0.2 turns (ncounts,subset=26), respectively (Figure 1D). The
distributions of the changes upon assembly or disassembly alone are shown in Supplementary Figure S5A,B,
respectively. These results are in excellent agreement with values reported in other studies involving
tetrasomes (25,30-37). Overall, our findings indicate that the high-affinity 601 sequence fully supports the
assembly of (H3.1-H4)2 tetramers into proper tetrasome complexes, irrespective of the presence or absence of
NAP1, or of buffer conditions.
High-affinity tetrasomes exhibit spontaneous DNA handedness flipping
To investigate the time-dependent behavior of tetrasomes stably bound to DNAw/601, the FOMT measurements
were continued for several hours following assembly. Like stably bound tetrasomes on DNArandom (35-37), highaffinity tetrasomes exhibited spontaneous dynamics in the handedness of their DNA wrapping (Figure 2A)
irrespective of the buffer conditions. While the length z of the DNA molecules remained constant, the linking
number Θ spontaneously fluctuated (or flipped) between two distinct mean values (Figure 2B, Supplementary
Figure S7). Based on the negative and positive signs of these values, we deduce that they correspond to
conformations of left- and right-handed DNA wrapping, respectively. As observed with tetrasomes on
DNArandom (35-37), tetrasomes on DNAw/601 most frequently adopted the left-handed conformation. The

difference in mean DNA linking number between the two observed states quantifies the induced change in
tetrasome structure. The values of this quantity obtained under different experimental conditions, including
tetrasomes loaded in the absence of NAP1, are summarized in Supplementary Table SIX. Due to the similarity
of their values (as assessed by respective t-tests, Supplementary Table SX), the results from all experiments
were pooled, which yielded a mean change in DNA linking number Θ upon flipping of ΔΘflipping = 1.6 ± 0.2 turns
(Ncounts,total=23) (Figure 2C). These values are in excellent agreement with previous studies (35-37). Overall, our
findings indicate that DNA sequence, the presence or absence of NAP1 during assembly, or buffer conditions
do not affect the structural rearrangement of tetrasomes associated with handedness flipping.
High-affinity DNA sequences increase the kinetics of tetrasome handedness flipping
We further examined the handedness dynamics of single tetrasomes in terms of the times spent in each of the
two states of DNA wrapping (Materials and Methods). To specifically examine the role of DNA sequence, we
focused these studies on NAP1-assembled tetrasomes, comparing the dynamics of NAP1-assembled (H3.1-H4)2
tetramers on either DNAw/601 or DNArandom. The details of tetrasome handedness dynamics upon spontaneous,
NAP1-independent assembly can be found in the Supplementary Results and Discussion and in Supplementary
Figure S8. Our results indicate that the underlying DNA sequence significantly alters the kinetics of tetrasome
handedness flipping (as assessed by respective Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, Supplementary Tables SXIII-SXV). This
can be deduced from the observation that a tetrasome on DNAw/601 spent an average time of τleft = 37 s in the
left-handed state (in standard buffer A, Figure 3A, left), which is 4.9 ± 0.5 fold shorter than a tetrasome
assembled onto DNArandom in the same buffer (τleft = 183 s, Table II). The right-handed state was affected to a
lesser extent, displaying a lifetime τright = 28 s (in standard buffer A, Figure 3A, right), which is 2.0 ± 0.3 times
longer than a tetrasome on DNArandom in the same buffer (τright = 14 s, Table II). These results clearly show that
tetrasomes on high-affinity DNA sequences have a substantially enhanced tendency to flip from the left- to the
right-handed state compared to tetrasomes on random DNA sequences (Supplementary Table SXIII). Since the
experimental conditions were otherwise identical, these effects must arise from the 601-sequence in DNAw/601.
We can translate the information from dwell-time measurements into schematic energy diagrams depicting the
left- and right-handed states of tetrasomes (Materials and Methods; Table II and Figure 3D). Notably, the free
energy differences ΔE between the left- and right-handed conformations of tetrasomes are reduced ~9-fold on
DNAw/601 (ΔE = 0.3 ± 0.1 kBT) relative to DNArandom (ΔE = 2.6 ± 0.1 kBT), reflecting the shift of the equilibrium
occupancy towards the right-handed conformation for NAP1-loaded tetrasomes on DNAw/601. This results
predominantly from the smaller estimated energy difference between the left-handed state and the transition
state (at the top of the barrier) for tetrasomes loaded onto DNA w/601 (ΔG*left~19.7 kBT) relative to DNArandom
(ΔG*left~21.3 kBT).
We next examined the flipping dynamics of tetrasomes on DNAw/601 in two different buffer conditions. In buffer
B (containing a two-fold increased concentration of monovalent salt in the absence of crowding agents, Table
I), tetrasomes dwelled in the left-handed state for τleft = 62 s (Figure 3B, left), 1.7 ± 0.1 times longer than in
standard buffer A (τleft = 37 s, Table II; Figure 3A, left). The average lifetimes in the right-handed conformation
were affected only slightly by the change to buffer B (Figure 3B, right; Table II, Supplementary Tables SXIV and
SXV). In buffer C, which contained additional magnesium chloride relative to buffer B (Table I), a tetrasome
dwelled in the left-handed conformation for an even longer time of τleft = 141 s (Figure 3C, top), which is 2.3 ±
0.2-fold longer than in buffer B (τleft = 62 s, Table II; Figure 3B, left). Again, the mean dwell time in the righthanded state showed essentially no change (Figure 3C, bottom; Figure 3B, right).
These findings can also be transferred into schematic energy diagrams (Materials and Methods; Figure 3D).
Because the predominant effect of increased monovalent salt concentration in buffer B for tetrasomes on
DNAw/601 is an increase in the lifetime of the left-handed conformation, the free energy difference between the
two states increases to ΔE = 0.6 ± 0.1 kBT (compared to ΔE = 0.3 ± 0.1 kBT in buffer A; Table II). The estimated
barrier height relative to the left-handed state is altered to ΔG*left~20.2 kBT, while the barrier height relative to

the right-handed state remains essentially unaffected. Similarly, because the higher concentration of divalent
ions in buffer C caused a further extension of the lifetime of the left-handed conformation, the free energy
difference between the two states correspondingly increases to ΔE = 1.5 ± 0.1 kBT (Table II). Thus, the
estimated barrier height relative to the left-handed state for tetrasomes on DNAw/601 is larger in buffer C
(ΔG*left~21.1 kBT) than in buffer B (ΔG*left~20.2 kBT,), while the barrier height relative to the right-handed state
remains essentially unaffected. In summary, higher concentrations of monovalent salt in the absence of
crowding agents as well as divalent salts attenuate the handedness flipping dynamics of tetrasomes assembled
on the high-affinity Widom 601-sequence by increasing the dwell time in the left-handed state and, thus,
reducing the tendency for tetrasomes to flip to the right-handed state.
DISCUSSION
A strong component determining the positioning and stability of nucleosomes throughout chromatin is the
DNA sequence (63). For instance, nucleosome maps obtained from chromatin assembled in vitro on purified
yeast genomic DNA showed remarkable similarity to nucleosome maps from native chromatin (64). The
observation that specific periodic patterns of AA, TT, TA or GC dinucleotides favour DNA wrapping around the
histone core led to the development of algorithms to predict nucleosome positions in different organisms
(42,65,66). High-affinity nucleosome binding sequences have been found to be enriched at the transcriptional
start site, in intragenic locations or over genes subject to strong regulation (42). In the present study, we have
investigated to which extent such high-affinity sites affect the structure and dynamics of subnucleosomal (H3H4)2 tetrasomes. Our previous single-molecule experiments revealed that the left-handed wrapping of DNA
around the histone octamer is predominantly static, while the absence of H2A-H2B dimers results in highly
dynamic flipping of DNA handedness between the left- and a right-handed state (35-37). However, these
studies were carried out on tetrasomes assembled onto random DNA sequences, and it remained unclear
whether high-affinity sequences, exemplified by the well-characterized Widom 601-sequence (50), would have
an impact on the dynamics of tetrasomes. Our assessment of the assembly and structural features of (H3-H4)2
tetrasomes on DNA including the 601-sequence revealed that the key characteristics of assembled tetrasomes
were very similar to those assembled onto random DNA (35-37). Interestingly, however, we observed that the
601 sequence also supported spontaneous, histone chaperone-independent formation of tetrasomes. As this
property strongly distinguishes DNA including the high-affinity 601-sequence from DNA of random sequence,
this suggests that tetrasome assembly occurs at the 601-sequence under these conditions. In the following, we
assume that a similar sequence-specificity holds for the chaperoned assembly of tetrasomes onto DNA
including the 601-sequence.
In contrast to the overall structural similarity between tetrasomes assembled onto high-affinity versus random
DNA sequences, our analyses revealed a striking difference with respect to handedness flipping dynamics. The
presence of the 601-sequence considerably decreased the lifetime of the canonical left-handed state of highaffinity tetrasomes, corresponding to a reduction in the free energy ΔE between the left- and right-handed
conformations, which results in enhanced flipping frequency.
These results may at first sight seem surprising given the high propensity of the 601-sequence to support
nucleosome/tetrasome formation relative to other DNA sequences (67), which presumably derives from a
combination of enhanced binding to histones and increased bendability or twistability of the DNA (38,50).
Indeed, our observation that histone tetramers assemble spontaneously onto DNA molecules with a 601sequence, but not onto DNA molecules of random sequence, emphasizes the strong affinity of the sequence
for histones. Yet what could be the reason for the increased flipping dynamics of high-affinity tetrasomes? A
likely explanation of these findings could be that the increased binding stability of tetrasomes to DNA reduces
the influence of thermal fluctuations on the disruption of histone-DNA contacts (by analogy to nucleosome
‘breathing’ (11-14)), and instead transmits thermal effects to the H3-H3 interface. This could promote the

this model, high-affinity sequences might not only promote energetically favorable histone-DNA interactions,
but may also endow tetrasomes with enhanced ability to accommodate torsional stress by flipping between
left-and right-handed conformation. This feature may be particularly important during transcription, when
tetrasomes can arise from nucleosomes by loss or removal of H2A/H2B dimers, and when torque can be
generated by elongating RNA polymerase II (68-70). Although most transcription-linked torsional stress is
removed by topoisomerases (71,72), high-affinity tetrasomes may provide extra protection against complete
histone ejection at crucial locations in the genome by their inherently stronger ability to absorb this stress.
In the presence of higher concentrations of mono- and divalent salt and an absence of synthetic crowding
agents, the left-handed states of NAP1-loaded tetrasomes on DNA molecules with a 601-sequence become
longer lived. Hence, these conditions decrease the tendency of tetrasomes to adopt the right-handed
conformation. We consider a direct influence of the synthetic crowding agents PEG and PVA on tetrasome
dynamics to be unlikely, as studies show that the influence of PEG (73) or PVA (74) on the kinetics of biological
systems is negligible at the low concentrations (below 1%) employed in our standard buffer. Thus, these
changes must arise from the higher concentration of salts, which will reduce the strength of electrostatic
interactions through screening. Even a two-fold increase in salt concentration as employed here can induce
small but significant changes in the properties of DNA (e.g. elasticity (75-77), torsional stiffness (78), and
supercoiling (79)) and proteins (80), and in the case of histones, reduce their affinity for DNA (81). In
agreement with the model proposed above, such a generic reduction in affinity could account for the observed
increase of the lifetime of the left-handed state for tetrasomes on DNA molecules with a 601-sequence,
because it would shift the balance between thermally induced opening of DNA-histone contacts and dimer
rotation at the H3-H3 interface towards the former. Upon further addition of divalent salt, which increases
electrostatic screening to an even larger extent, the dwell time in the left-handed state of NAP1-loaded
tetrasomes on DNA molecules with a 601-sequence becomes more pronounced, as one might expect by
analogy with the above. These findings also illustrate that the interpretation of results obtained using
nucleosome-positioning sequences must take into account the specific buffer conditions employed.
In summary, we provide conceptual evidence that DNA sequence impacts tetrasome handedness flipping
dynamics, which may contribute to the mitigation of torsional stress generated by molecular motors without
accompanying eviction of histones.

Figure 1. Real-time assembly of single tetrasomes onto DNA with a 601-sequence. A Top view on
about 80 bp of DNA (dark gray) bound to a tetrameric protein core consisting of the histones H3
(orange) and H4 (cyan). This image was created by modifying the structural data of the Drosophila
nucleosome from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the PDB identification code 2PYO (82). B
Experimental assay based on FOMT (49). A single DNA construct (black) containing a 601-sequence
(red) at its center (DNAw/601) is attached to a coverslip (light blue) at one end, and tethered to a
superparamagnetic bead (light brown) at the other end. Above the flow cell, a cylindrically shaped
permanent magnet (dark blue/red), with its axis precisely aligned with the DNA tether, exerts a
constant force (F) on the bead while allowing its free rotation in the (x,y)-plane (indicated by the
black circular arrow). This enables the direct measurement of the DNA molecule’s length z and
linking number Θ, which upon the assembly of a tetrasome (orange) are changed by Δz and ΔΘ
(indicated by the red straight and circular arrows, respectively). Tetrasome assembly is induced by
flushing in either (H3.1-H4)2 tetramers alone or pre-incubated histone/NAP1 complexes. Nonmagnetic beads attached to the flow cell surface serve as reference for drift correction. This figure is
adapted from Ref. (37) (https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5009100). C Partial time traces of the length z (in
nm, top panel) and the linking number Θ (in turns, bottom panel) of a DNAw/601 molecule before and

decreased both quantities in the form of a step identified using a step-finder algorithm (red lines)
(Materials and Methods). About 60 s after assembly, free proteins were flushed out with
measurement buffer (orange arrows) to prevent further histone binding. In this particular
experiment, a tetrasome was assembled by flushing in NAP1/histone complexes (green arrows) in
buffer A (Table I). A corresponding time trace of a DNAw/601 molecule upon the assembly of a
tetrasome from histone tetramers only is shown in Supplementary Figure S4. D Histogram of the
changes in DNA length upon assembly and disassembly Δz(dis)ass (in nm, top panel) of single (H3.1-H4)2
tetrasomes (N=27) and in DNA linking number upon assembly and disassembly ΔΘ(dis)ass (in turns,
bottom panel) of single (H3.1-H4)2 tetrasomes (N=27) in all buffers (Table I), shown together with the
mean spatial resolution corresponding to the average 1 STD (16 nm and 0.5 turns; green lines) from
all experiments. Data beyond the resolution limits (hatched area) was excluded from the
determination of the mean change Δz(dis)ass = 23 ± 5 nm (n=25) and ΔΘ(dis)ass = 0.9 ± 0.2 turns (n=26).

Figure 2. The structural dynamics of single tetrasomes on DNA with a 601-sequence. A
Representation of the two tetrasome conformations with the DNA wrapped in either a left-handed
or a right-handed superhelix. Tetrasomes were observed to spontaneously flip between these two
states (35-37). This image is adapted from Ref. (37) (https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5009100). B Partial
time traces of the length z (in nm, top panel) and the linking number Θ (in turns, bottom panel) of a
DNA molecule after the assembly of a (H3.1-H4)2 tetrasome in buffer A (Table I) upon flushing in
histone/NAP1 complexes. As indicated from the fit by the step-finder algorithm to the time trace (red
line, left panel) and the fit of a mirrored gamma function (red line in histogram plot, right panel) to
the skewed data, the DNA length remains constant. The DNA linking number spontaneously
fluctuates, i.e. ‘flips’, between two states identified by fitting two Gaussian functions (white lines in
histogram plot, right panel) underlying the full profile (red line in histogram plot, right panel). The
two states correspond to a prevalent left-handed and a less adopted right-handed conformation of
DNA wrapping, with the respective mean linking numbers Θleft = -0.31 ± 0.01 turns and Θright = +1.38 ±

0.06 turns (dashed-dotted magenta lines, 95% confidence level for estimated values). Due to drift,
the mean value for Θleft obtained here is offset from the average change in DNA linking number upon
tetrasome dis-/assembly (Figure 1D, bottom panel). The structural dynamics were quantified in
terms of the dwell times in the two states based on a threshold zone (hatched orange area) that is
bounded by 1 STD from each mean value (orange solid lines) about their average (solid magenta line)
(Materials and Methods). A corresponding partial time trace of a DNAw/601 molecule upon the
assembly of a tetrasome from histone tetramers only is shown in Supplementary Figure S7. C
Histogram of the change in DNA linking number ΔΘflipping (in turns) upon flipping of single (H3.1-H4)2
tetrasomes in their handedness of DNA-wrapping in all buffers (Table I). The data yields a mean value
of ΔΘflipping = 1.6 ± 0.2 turns (N=23). The individual values are provided in Supplementary Table SIX.

the dwell times of a single NAP1-loaded (H3.1-H4)2 tetrasome on a DNAw/601 molecule in the left- (left
panel) and right-handed conformation (right panel) in buffer A (Tables I and II). Exponential fits (red
lines) yielded a mean dwell time of τD,left = 37 ± 2 s (N=371) and τD,right = 28 +2/-1 s (N=373),
respectively (68% confidence level for estimated values). B As in (A), but now in buffer B (Tables I and
II). Exponential fits (red lines) yielded a mean dwell time of τD,left = 62 ± 3 s (N=559) and τD,right = 33 ± 1
s (N=564), respectively (68% confidence level for estimated values). C Histograms of the dwell times

respectively (68% confidence level for estimated values). All data in panels (A)-(C) were obtained by
dwell-time analysis of the DNA linking number time traces filtered by averaging over 3.3 s (N=330)
(Materials and Methods). D Schematic energy diagrams of single NAP1-loaded tetrasomes on
DNAw/601 in all buffer conditions, based on the dwell-time values and the probabilities obtained from
the linking number distributions (Table II, Supplementary Tables SXI, SXIII-SXV). The solid black lines
illustrate the energy levels in buffer A (Table I) for a NAP1-loaded (H3.1-H4)2 tetrasome on DNArandom,
while the solid blue lines depict the energetics for a NAP1-loaded (H3.1-H4)2 tetrasome on DNAw/601.
The green and orange dashed lines show the energy levels for a NAP1-loaded (H3.1-H4)2 tetrasome
on DNAw/601 in buffers B and C, respectively. The free energy differences (ΔE) between the left- and
right-handed conformations of tetrasomes on DNAw/601, with the respective energies Eleft and Eright,
are considerably decreased compared to tetrasomes loaded onto DNArandom (Table II). The heights of
the energy barriers ΔG*left and ΔG*right are estimated from the rates kl->r and kr->l, respectively. For
tetrasomes on DNAw/601 relative to DNArandom in buffer A, ΔG*left decreases strongly, whereas ΔG*right
is largely unchanged. In the presence of mono- and divalent salts in buffers B and C, tetrasomes on
DNAw/601 become considerably longer-lived in the left-handed conformation (i.e. ΔG*left is higher)
compared to tetrasomes on DNAw/601 in buffer A, while the right-handed state (hence ΔG*right)
remains essentially unaltered.
