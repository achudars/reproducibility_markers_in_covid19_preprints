Abstract

30

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) envelope glycoprotein complexes, gH/gL/gO-trimer and

31

gH/gL/UL128L-pentamer, are important for cell-free HCMV entry. While soluble Nrp2-Fc

32

(sNrp2-Fc) interferes with epithelial/endothelial cell entry through UL128, soluble PDGFRα-

33

Fc (sPDGFRα-Fc) interacts with gO thereby inhibiting infection of all cell types. Since gO is

34

the most variable subunit we investigated the influence of gO polymorphism on the inhibitory

35

capacities of sPDGFRα-Fc and sNRP2-Fc.

36

Accordingly, gO genotype 1c (GT1c) sequence was fully or partially replaced by gO GT2b,

37

GT3, GT5 sequences in TB40-BAC4-luc background. All mutants were tested for fibroblast

38

and epithelial cell infectivity, for virions’ gO and gH content, and for infection inhibition by

39

sPDGFRα-Fc and sNrp2-Fc.

40

Full-length and partial gO GT swapping may strongly alter the virions’ gO and gH levels

41

associated with enhanced epithelial cell infectivity. All gO GT mutants except recombinant gO

42

GT1c/3 displayed a near-complete inhibition at 1.25 µg/ml sPDGFRα-Fc on epithelial cells

43

(98% versus 91%) and all on fibroblasts (≥ 99%). While gO GT replacement did not influence

44

sNrp2-Fc inhibition at 1.25 µg/ml on epithelial cells (96%-98%), it rendered mutants with low

45

gO levels moderately accessible to fibroblasts inhibition (20%-40%). In contrast to the steep

46

sPDGFRα-Fc inhibition curves (slope >1.0), sNrp2-Fc dose-response curves on epithelial cells

47

displayed slopes of ~1.0 suggesting functional differences between these entry inhibitors.

48

Our findings suggest that targeting of gO-trimer rather than UL128-pentamer might be a

49

promising target to inhibit infectivity independent of the cell type, gO polymorphism, and

50

gO/gH content. However, intragenic gO recombination may lead to moderate resistence to

51

sPDGFRα-Fc inhibition.

Importance

54

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is known for its broad cell tropism as reflected by the

55

different organs and tissues affected by HCMV infection. Hence, inhibition of HCMV entry

56

into distinct cell types could be considered as a promising therapeutic option to limit cell-free

57

HCMV infection. Soluble forms of cellular entry receptor PDGFRα rather than those of entry

58

receptor neuropilin-2 inhibit infection of multiple cell types. sPDGFRα specifically interacts

59

with gO of the trimeric gH/gL/gO envelope glycoprotein complex. HCMV strains may differ

60

with respect to the virions’ amount of trimer and the highly polymorphic gO sequence. In this

61

study, we show that gO polymorphism rather than gO levels may affect the inhibitory capacity

62

of sPDGFRα. The finding that gO intragenic recombination may lead to moderate evasion from

63

sPDGFRα inhibition is of major value to the development of potential anti-HCMV therapeutic

64

compounds based on sPDGFRα.

Introduction

67

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a widely spread pathogen which may cause substantial

68

harm in congenitally infected newborns and in patients undergoing severe immunosuppressive

69

therapy (1). Natural HCMV transmission follows mainly through body fluids such as urine or

70

saliva (2). Upon infection, HCMV is spread throughout the body infecting many of the major

71

somatic cell types like fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, epithelial cells,

72

neurons, and leukocytes (3).

73

Two virion envelope glycoprotein (gp) complexes of human cytomegalovirus, the trimer

74

gH/gL/gO and the pentamer gH/gL/UL128-131, are known to play crucial roles in host cell

75

entry (4-6). These two complexes share the same gH/gL heterodimer forming either with gO or

76

with UL128 a disulfide bridge with gL-Cys144 (7). Cell-free virions which are infectious for

77

multiple cell types rather than fibroblasts alone, thus resemble in vivo cell tropism, must harbour

78

both gp complexes (8-10). HCMV strains show large differences in the relative levels of trimer

79

and pentamer incorporated in their virions (11). It is suggested that the trimer–to-pentamer ratio

80

influences the infection efficiency for the respective cell types (8, 12, 13) and that a number of

81

HCMV genes have the capacity to impact the composition of the two gH/gL complexes (14).

82

Large sequence comparison analysis has shown that, among all subunits of the two gp

83

complexes, glycoprotein O (gO) exhibits by far the highest sequence polymorphisms with up

84

to 23% amino acid diversity among gO sequences (15-17). All known gO sequences cluster

85

into 5 major groups which can further be divided into 8 genotypes (18, 19). A closer inspection

86

of gO gene sequences in circulating HCMV strains revealed that recombination among distinct

87

strains may have occurred at several positions along the gO gene (16, 17, 20-22), arguing that

88

recombination may be an important driving force of gO sequence evolution. Although it appears

89

that all 8 gO genotypes can form stable trimers (11), it is poorly understood what role gO

90

polymorphism plays in cell tropism. As recently shown gO genotypes may influence the

91

efficiency of epithelial cell infection through specific sequence characteristics (23) or via

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/778241; this version posted September 24, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

92

affecting the relative levels of gH/gL complexes (11, 13). Moreover, it has recently been

93

reported that the accessibility of certain gH or gH/gL epitopes for monoclonal antibodies differs

94

among HCMV strains probably due to the distinct gO genotype sequences of the respective

95

strains (24).

96

Over the last few years, a number of cellular interaction partners for both, the trimer and the

97

pentamer have been identified (14). One of these cellular receptors, platelet-derived growth

98

factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), was identified to directly and specifically interact with gO

99

parts of the trimer (25-27). This interaction enables entry of cell-free virions into fibroblasts,

100

the only cell type which shows a high PDGFRα expression (28). Albeit, soluble forms of

101

PDGFRα (sPDGFRα) can severely inhibit not only entry into fibroblasts, but also entry into

102

endothelial and epithelial cells (25-27), and first observations indicate that the inhibitory

103

capacity of sPDGFRα is effective against several HCMV strains even when they harbour a

104

different gO genotype sequence (26).

105

Neuropilin-2 (NRP2), another recently identified host cell receptor for HCMV, specifically

106

interacts with the UL128 subunit of the pentamer (29). This interaction is required for entry

107

into endothelial and epithelial cells, most likely through endocytosis, but seems to be

108

dispensable for entry into fibroblasts. Accordingly, a soluble form of NRP2 (sNRP2) inhibits

109

endothelial and epithelial infection but not fibroblasts (29). Both PDGFRα and NRP2 likely

110

function as the primary entry receptors for the trimer and pentamer, respectively, however, the

111

modes of entry downstream of receptor binding may substantially differ. In particular, it appears

112

that the trimer functions at steps which are required for entry into all cell types (14) which

113

makes sPDGFRα or derivatives thereof a promising therapeutic tool against HCMV (30, 31).

114

In the present study, we now aimed to assess how gO polymorphism influences the inhibitory

115

capacity of sPDGFRα and sNRP2, respectively. To this end, we generated a set of TB40-BAC4-

116

luc-derived HCMV gO genotype mutant strains, five of them harbour one of the major gO

117

genotype sequences and 2 of them carry a recombinant gO genotypic form. We showed that

118

subtle to moderate differences in the inhibitory capacities of the two entry inhibitors, sPDGFRα

119

and sNRP2, are attributed to gO polymorphism.

121

Results

122

Cell-free infectivity of HCMV strains upon swapping of gO genotype sequences

123

In order to investigate the influence of gO polymorphisms on the cell entry inhibitors sPDGFRα

124

and sNRP2, we generated a panel of gO genotype mutant viruses, in which the parental gO

125

genotype sequence GT1c of TB40-BAC4-luc was fully or partially replaced by another gO GT

126

sequence (see Figure 1, and Supplementary Figure 1). Correctness of the whole UL and US

127

regions of fibroblast-derived reconstituted viruses were validated by whole genome sequencing.

128

All experiments were done with reconstituted virus stocks without further passaging. For

129

comparison analyses and comprehensiveness both the parental strain, referred to as gO GT1c,

130

and the previously generated gO GT mutant, gO GT4 (23), were included in all experiments.

131

First, to assess the ability of the gO GT mutants to infect human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs),

132

cell-free virus stocks of gO GT1c and mutants were adjusted to a similar number of

133

encapsidated genome equivalents (mean of 8.2 log10 copies/ml). Infectivity was quantified by

134

monitoring luciferase expression in cell lysates 2 days post infection. Relative light units

135

(RLUs) are the read out for the extent of infection. The log10 ratio of RLUs to encapsidated

136

genomes was calculated and the fold change relative to gO GT1c was determined. Mutants and

137

parental strain were incubated on the same plate to avoid inter-plate variability of RLU

138

quantitation. As shown in Figure 2A, all gO GT mutants infected fibroblasts similarly efficient

139

as gO GT1c.

140

Next, we determined the relative epithelial cell infectivity by simultaneously infecting both,

141

epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Cell-free virus stocks were adjusted to achieve 300-1,500 RLUs

142

in ARPE-19-infected cell lysates. Infection efficiencies were determined by luciferase assay 2

143

days post infection and the ratios of epithelial cell to fibroblast RLUs were calculated (see

144

Figure 2B). Mutant gO GT3 and the two recombinant forms, GT1c/GT3 and GT3/GT1c, along

145

with gO GT4 displayed a significantly higher epithelial cell infectivity compared to gO GT1c.

146

In summary, the data show that gO GT swapping, either full-length or partial, does not impair

147

the capacity to infect fibroblasts but seems to affect epithelial cell tropism.

148
149

Content of gO and gH in the envelope of gO GT mutant viruses

150

Cell-free virions of parental strain TB40-BAC4-luc are characterized by high gO abundance

151

and low UL128 expression. This is thought to result in a high trimer-to-pentamer ratio

152

associated with a low efficiency for epithelial cell infection (12). Thus, we wanted to know

153

whether the enhanced epithelial cell infectivity of gO GT3, gO GT1c/GT3 and gO GT3/GT1c

154

results from changes in the trimer-to-pentamer ratio upon gO GT swapping. To this end,

155

parental and mutant virions were purified from fibroblast supernatant and the amounts of gO

156

and gH were determined by semi-quantitative western blot under reducing conditions. The total

157

amount of virions was normalized to gB and/or major capsid protein (MCP). The gO content

158

represents the amount of trimer and the gH level is assumed to indicate the overall amount of

159

trimer and pentamer in virions. One representative immunoblot for each mutant is given in

160

Figure 3, and the estimated virions’ gO and gH contents are shown in Table 1. In comparison

161

to gO GT1c the amount of virions’ gO was severely reduced in gO GT3 (~ 80%), GT3/1c (~

162

90%), GT1c/3 (~ 50%), a subtle reduction was found for gO GT5 (~ 30%), but no substantial

163

changes for gO GT4 mutant virions. Notably, almost no gO was detectable in gO GT2b virions

164

even when very high virion concentrations were used for immunoblotting (see Supplementary

165

Figure 2). Although it cannot be excluded that gO GT2b virions harbour very low levels of gO

166

it is more likely that the anti-gO antibody used in this study which is directed towards gO GT1c

167

of TB40E (32) does not cross-react with gO GT2b while the gO genotypic forms GT3, GT4,

168

and GT5 are well recognized (see Supplementary Figure 2). With regard to the gH content it

169

appears that the mutant virions GT3 and GT1c/GT3 harbour 1.6 to 3.2 fold higher gH levels

170

whereas GT2b, GT4, and GT5 contain moderately lower levels as compared to gO GT1c.

171

Hence, these data suggest a shift towards lower trimer-to-pentamer ratio upon full-length and

172

partial swapping of GT3 sequences but not upon replacement of GT1c by GT4 and GT5

173

sequences.

174
175

Inhibition of cell-free fibroblast and epithelial cell infectivity by soluble PDGFRα-Fc

176

Since all gO GT mutants retained the ability to infect fibroblasts and epithelial cells, we were

177

able to directly compare the inhibitory capacity of sPDGFRα-Fc between the five major gO

178

genotypic and the two recombinant forms. The inhibition experiments were performed with a

179

fixed amount of infectious viruses pre-incubated for 2 hours with a 2-fold dilution series of

180

sPDGFRα-Fc ranging from 0.0025 to 0.625 µg/ml. After another 2 hour-incubation on

181

fibroblasts or epithelial cells, respectively, cells were washed and subsequently incubated with

182

fresh medium for further 2 days. RLUs were monitored by a luciferase assay and plotted against

183

the concentration of sPDGFRα-Fc.

184

First, the appropriate amount of infectious input virus was determined using three different

185

virus dilutions of parental strain gO GT1c. As shown in Figure 4A and 4B there was no

186

substantial change in the overall shape of the dose-dependent inhibition over a wide range of

187

input infectivity. Thus, for all further inhibition experiments the cell-free virus stocks were

188

normalized to similar RLUs within the tested range (see Materials and Methods). In all mutants,

189

cell-free infectivity was inhibited by sPDGFRα-Fc in a dose-dependent manner. One

190

representative curve for gO GT1c and the gO GT mutants is shown in Figure 4C and 4D. The

191

half-maximal inhibition (IC50) as calculated by non-linear regression ranged from 49 ng/ml to

192

73 ng/ml for fibroblasts and from 24 ng/ml to 56 ng/ml for epithelial cells (see Table 2). None

193

of the mutants’ IC50 value significantly differed from IC50 of parental strain. Moreover, there

194

was no difference between parental strain and mutants in the overall steep shape of the dose-

195

response curves (slopes >1), neither in fibroblasts nor in epithelial cells, except for one of the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/778241; this version posted September 24, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

196

recombinant mutants, gO GT1c/3, in epithelial cells. This gO mutant showed a shallower dose-

197

response curve with a slope of 1.0 to 2.6 (see Table 2). The slope parameter mathematically

198

analogous to the Hill coefficient is a measure of cooperativity (33) in the binding of multiple

199

ligands (e.g. sPDGFRα-Fc) to linked binding sites (e.g. gO). Dose-response curves with a slope

200

of about 1.0 are indicative for non-cooperativity which means the ligand binds at each site

201

independently. In contrast, steep curves with slopes much larger than 1.0 are thought to result

202

from a form of positive cooperative effects upon ligand binding (33). Hence, these findings

203

suggest that the presumed positive cooperativity is weakened when sPDGFRα-Fc binds to gO

204

GT1c/3.

205

Next, we determined the maximal extent of inhibition at 1.25 µg/ml sPDGFRα-Fc calculated

206

as 1 – (RLU after pretreatment / RLU of untreated virus stocks). The inhibition of fibroblast

207

infectivity was almost complete (> 99%) and did not differ between gO GT1c and mutants (see

208

Figure 4E). In epithelial cells, in contrast, one of the recombinant mutants, gO GT1c/3, retained

209

a significantly higher infectivity (mean: 9%) at this inhibitor concentration compared to gO

210

GT1c. The other mutants did not differ from the parental strain. The reduced epithelial cell

211

inhibition of gO GT1c/3 by sPDGFRα-Fc is well in accordance with the shallower shape of the

212

dose-response curve (Figure 4D). Notably, the inhibition efficiency was slightly less effective

213

in epithelial cells (~ 98 – 99%) than in fibroblasts for gO GT1c and the mutants, GT2b, GT3,

214

and GT3/1c (see Figure 4E).

215

In summary, these findings show that not only the five major genotypic forms of gO are

216

recognized by sPDGFRα-Fc but also recombinant forms of gO. Albeit, one recombinant version

217

of gO seems to be less effectively inhibited by sPDGFRα-Fc on epithelial cells.

218
219

Inhibition of cell-free fibroblast and epithelial cell infectivity by soluble NRP2-Fc

220

It has recently been reported that soluble forms of NRP2 which specifically bind to UL128,

221

inhibit epithelial cell infection while fibroblast infection remains largely unaffected (29). We

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/778241; this version posted September 24, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

222

wanted to know whether alterations in the virions’ gO and gH content upon gO GT swapping

223

may indirectly affect the inhibitory capacity of sNRP2-Fc. To address this question, first we

224

performed inhibition experiments on epithelial cells using a 2-fold dilution series of sNRP2-Fc

225

(range: 0.0025 to 0.626 µg/ml) and a fixed amount of RLU-normalized gO GT virions as

226

described for sPDGFRα-Fc. Two independent experiments were performed for each mutant

227

along with the parental strain and one representative curve is shown in Figure 5A. The dose-

228

dependent inhibition was similar between parental strain and gO GT mutants, the dose-response

229

curves displayed slopes of about 1.0 (range: 0.7 to 2.1) and the IC50 values ranged from 31 to

230

90 ng/ml (see Table 2). These findings indicate that neither the gO genotypic form nor changes

231

in the virion’s gO content influences the capacity of sNRP2-Fc for epithelial cell inhibition.

232

Finally, we wanted to assess the maximum inhibitory capacity of 1.25 µg/ml sNRP2-Fc on

233

epithelial cells and whether such high inhibitor concentrations also have an effect on fibroblast

234

infectivity. As shown in Figure 5B, epithelial cell infectivity was 96% to 98% reduced in all

235

mutant viruses and this did not significantly differ between parental strain and mutants.

236

Interestingly, although the fibroblast infectivity was almost unaffected in parental strain and in

237

two of the mutants, GT2b and GT5, a moderate reduction in fibroblast infectivity of 20% to

238

40% was observed for the other mutants and this reached statistical significance for the

239

recombinant mutant gO GT1c/3. From these data it appears that gO differences upon GT

240

swapping may render mutant virions partially accessible to sNRP2-Fc inhibition on fibroblasts.

241
242

Discussion

243

The two envelope glycoprotein complexes, gH/gL/gO-trimer and gH/gL/UL128L-pentamer,

244

which share the same gH/gL heterodimer, play major roles in HCMV cell entry. In the present

245

study, we focussed on gO, the critical subunit of the trimer. A special hallmark of gO is its high

246

polymorphism with an overall amino acid diversity of ~ 20% (18, 19). To learn more about

247

potential functional differences attributed to gO polymorphism, we fully or partially swapped

248

gO gene sequences in the otherwise identical TB40-BAC4-luc background, tested the set of gO

249

mutants for their capability to infect fibroblasts and epithelial cells, for their relative

250

composition of gO and gH in cell-free virions, and evaluated the inhibitory capacity of

251

sPDGFRα-Fc in comparison to sNRP2 inhibition.

252

First, we demonstrate that gO GT swapping, either partial or full-length, does not substantially

253

affect fibroblast infectivity but may lead to an increase in relative epithelial cell infectivity. In

254

particular, the mutants gO GT3, GT3/1c, and GT1c/3, which displayed the strongest

255

enhancement in epithelial cell infection, contained substantially lower gO but higher gH levels

256

in their cell-free virions as compared to parental strain. Previous studies have revealed that gO

257

and UL128 compete for binding to the same gL cysteine residue in gH/gL (7) which in turn

258

regulates the trimer to pentamer ratio (7, 8) and this renders virions more infectious for

259

fibroblasts (high trimer to pentamer ratio) or epithelial cells (low trimer to pentamer ratio) (11,

260

12). Since parental strain TB40-BAC4-luc is characterized by vastly more gO than UL128

261

accompanied by a low epithelial cell infectivity (12) it is likely that the opposite changes in gO

262

and gH levels upon partial or full-length GT3 swapping cause a shift towards lower trimer to

263

pentamer ratio which may well explain the increase in epithelial cell infectivity. The impact of

264

the relative composition of gO and gH in terms of epithelial cell infectivity is further underlined

265

by the observation that replacement of gO GT1c by GT5 which causes a subtle reduction in

266

both, gO and gH, has no effect on epithelial cell infectivity. Similarly as recently reported, gO

267

GT1b to GT5 swapping and vice versa has also no effect on gO expression levels (13).

268

Together, these findings suggest that the relative abundance of gO and gH incorporated into

269

cell-free virions is influenced by the gO genotypic form. Recently, UL148 has been identified

270

to regulate the trimer to pentamer ratio by stabilizing gO within the endoplasmatic reticulum

271

(34, 35). It is tempting to speculate that the regulatory capability of UL148 is influenced by the

272

gO sequence. Additionally, it cannot be excluded that GT sequence-specific characteristics

273

directly modify the capacity of cell-free virions for entry into epithelial cells, since gO GT4

274

displayed an enhanced epithelial cell tropism without substantial alterations in gO and gH

275

abundance, as previously shown (23).

276

Remarkably, despite significant differences in epithelial cell tropism, the fibroblast infectivity

277

was similar among the mutants and parental strain. These findings indicate that neither changes

278

in gO and gH abundance nor gO GT sequence-specific characteristics affect the capacity for

279

fibroblast infection. Moreover, these data lead to the conclusion that all of these gO genotypic

280

forms can bind to the cellular fibroblast receptor PDGFRα with similar efficiency. Strikingly,

281

a minimum level of gO on cell-free virions seems to be still sufficient for normal fibroblast

282

infection under the tested in vitro conditions as in particular gO GT3 and gO GT1c/3 mutants

283

display very low gO levels. Taken together, these observations provide clear evidence that gO

284

polymorphism has a substantial impact on epithelial cell but not on fibroblast infectivity.

285

Further investigations will clarify how differences in the gO and gH abundance and/or GT-

286

specific sequence characteristics affect epithelial cell entry of cell-free virions.

287

Recombination among different HCMV strains appears to be a major driving force in HCMV

288

evolution as shown by numerous studies (36). Recently, the recombination density throughout

289

the genome was deeply investigated by whole genome sequence comparisons exploring past

290

and recent recombination events as well (16, 20, 21). A particularly interesting finding was the

291

identification of pervasive genome-wide recombination generating diversity both within and

292

between genes (16, 21). So far, little is known about potential functional consequences for

293

individual genes upon intragenic recombination. In the present study, we have now included

294

two chimeric gO GT mutants, each of them carrying a recombinant gO genotypic form

295

composed of GT1c and GT3 sequences. One of them, gO GT3/1c, harbours the recombination

296

breakpoint within the conserved C-terminal part of gO and this mutant differs from full-length

297

gO GT3 in only 4 amino acid residues. The recombination breakpoint of the other one, gO

298

GT1c/3, is located in a small identical sequence stretch between GT1c and GT3 in the otherwise

299

highly polymorphic N-terminal part of gO. Recombination resulted in a severely altered gO

300

sequence with an amino acid diversity of 9% from GT1c and of 10% from GT3. Strikingly,

301

both recombinant gO mutants not only fully retained the ability to infect fibroblasts they even

302

displayed an enhancement in epithelial cell infectivity comparable to full-length GT3 mutant.

303

As discussed above, the change in gO and gH abundance may cause the observed epithelial cell

304

phenotype. Accordingly, these findings indicate that recombination within the gO gene could

305

be considered as an important function for HCMV to generate (i) gene diversity with or without

306

modified functions and (ii) novel combinations of neighbouring loci even when they are highly

307

diverse. This is well in concordance with previously reported sequencing data showing that

308

recombination within gO may sporadically occur also in vivo despite a strong linkage between

309

gO and the adjacent, partly overlapping gN gene (16, 17, 21, 22, 37).

310

Recent studies have shown that PDGFRα specifically interacts with the gO subunit of the trimer

311

which is required for entry into fibroblasts (25-28). As soluble forms of PDGFRα or derivatives

312

thereof can inhibit cell-free infection of several cell types (26) it appears that binding of

313

sPDGFRα to gO interferes with trimer-mediated function(s) widely required for cell entry. We

314

now demonstrate that representatives of the five major gO genotypic forms, GT1c, GT2b, GT3,

315

GT4, and GT5, are similarly recognized by sPDGFRα and upon pretreatment with sPDGFRα-

316

Fc both, fibroblast and epithelial cell infectivity was strongly inhibited. These data are well in

317

line with previous reports showing the inhibitory capacity of sPDGFRα for several distinct

318

HCMV strains (26). Notably, even at a concentration of 1.25µg/ml sPDGFRα we observed a

319

residual infectivity of about 1 - 2% in epithelial cells, while in fibroblasts the inhibition was

320

almost complete (≥ 99%) similar as shown previously (27). Thus, it is tempting to speculate

321

that a trimer-independent entry mechanism accounts for the residual infectivity. Alternatively,

322

it is also possible that not all virions are neutralized at this concentration allowing for a residual

323

infection.

324

Remarkably, one of the two recombinant mutants, gO GT1c/GT3, displayed a significantly

325

lower sensitivity for sPDGFRα inhibition on epithelial cells than the other mutants while the

326

fibroblast inhibition was similarly effective. As mentioned above this mutant comprises its

327

recombination site in the highly polymorphic N-terminal region of the protein, which only

328

recently was suggested to contain the PDGFRα receptor binding domain (31). By mutational

329

analysis the authors identified a small stretch from amino acid 117 to 121 causing the strongest

330

impairment of sPDGFRα binding to virus particles and consequently also a reduced virus

331

penetration into fibroblasts. Although this peptide site overlaps with the recombination site of

332

GT1c/GT3, the specific sequence remained unchanged upon recombination suggesting that

333

sPDGFRα binding to this recombinant form of gO is not impaired. This presumption fits well

334

to the finding that gO GT1c/GT3 mutant does not display a phenotype in fibroblast infectivity

335

while mutants with a mutation in this particular peptide sequence showed reduced penetration

336

into fibroblasts (31). Hence, we assume that the impaired sPDGFRα inhibition for gO

337

GT1c/GT3 mutant on epithelial cells is not caused by a lower binding of sPDGFRα to gO but

338

rather by an impaired interference with a downstream entry step mediated by the trimer.

339

The assumption that binding of sPDGFRα to gO-trimer affects more entry properties than the

340

unique block of the receptor binding site is further strengthened by our findings that inhibition

341

with 2-fold serial dilutions of sPDGFRα led to steep dose-response curves in both fibroblasts

342

and epithelial cells. Such steep inhibition curves with a slope of much greater than 1 are thought

343

to result from a form of positive cooperative effects upon ligand binding (33). Remarkably, the

344

steepness of the sPDGFRα-Fc dose-inhibition curves were not affected by the gO content in

345

virions, nor by the amount of input virions. The underlying mechanisms are not yet clearly

346

understood but following scenarios may explain why sPDGFRα-bound virions become rapidly

347

inactive for cell entry: binding of sPDGFRα to virions leads to (i) steric hindrance and/or

348

conformational changes of the gO-trimer which affects multiple sPDGFRα binding sites on the

349

virion, (ii) cluster formation of trimers and/or other envelope complexes which causes that

350

multiple gO binding sites on the virion are rapidly blocked, (iii) changes of gB prefusion into

351

gB postfusion conformation (under the assumption that the trimer stabilizes the gB prefusion

352

conformation) which renders virions inactive for entry, and/or (iv) cluster formation of multiple

353

virions. Although these proposed scenarios await further clarification, from our data it becomes

354

clear that a presumed cooperative effect triggered by sPDGFRα does not differ among the five

355

major gO genotypes.

356

When we compared the dose-response curves of sPDGFRα with those of sNRP2, a recently

357

identified entry inhibitor for epithelial cells (29), it becomes obvious that the mechanisms of

358

action substantially differ between these two entry inhibitors. The dose-response curves of

359

sNRP2 displayed a slope of about 1 – 2 meaning that binding of sNRP2 to its interaction partner

360

UL128 of the pentamer causes no further effects beside the block of the binding site. There was

361

also seen no difference among the gO GT mutants and parental strain indicating that neither gO

362

abundance nor gO GT-specific characteristics influence the binding efficiency of sNRP2.

363

Notably, all gO mutants along with parental strain displayed a residual epithelial cell infectivity

364

of about 2-3% at a concentration of 1.25 µg/ml sNRP2. Whether an NRP2-independent entry

365

pathway circumvents a complete inhibition or whether not all virions are neutralized by this

366

concentration of sNRP2 yet awaits further investigation. As recently reported, fibroblast

367

infection is largely unaffected by sNRP2 (29). In overall, this finding is well in concordance

368

with our data. However, we observed a subtle inhibition of fibroblast infectivity by high

369

concentrations of sNRP2 in those mutant virions which displayed very low amounts of gO.

370

Thus, it is presumable that binding of high amounts of sNRP2 to virions lead to steric hindrance

371

of the trimer which becomes visible only for virions with low gO levels.

372

In conclusion, in this study we show that the trimer to pentamer ratio which is substantially

373

affected by gO polymorphism has no influence on the inhibitory capacity of sPDGFRα but may

374

render virions slightly susceptible to sNRP2 inhibition on fibroblasts. When sPDGFRα or

375

derivates thereof are considered for a therapeutic option to HCMV infection it should be taken

376

into account that gO intragenic recombination may lead to partial evasion from sPDGFRα

377

inhibition.

Material and Methods

379

Cells

380

Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) were cultured in minimum essential medium Eagle (MEM;

381

Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine

382

serum (FBS; Capricorn Scientific, Ebsdorfergrund, Germany) and 0.5% neomycin (Sigma-

383

Aldrich). Human adult retinal pigmented epithelial cells (ARPE-19; ATCC, Manassas,

384

Virginia) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium/nutrient mixture F12 (PAN-

385

Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin

386

(Thermo Fisher) or in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.5% neomycin.

388

Generation of gO mutant BAC clones by en passant mutagenesis

389

All HCMV gO mutant strains were derived from the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)

390

clone TB40-BAC4-luc (38). By “en passant” mutagenesis in E.coli GS1783 (39), the gO GT1c

391

sequence of TB40-BAC4-luc was fully exchanged by GT2b, GT3, and GT5 respectively, and

392

partially by gO GT3, either at the 5’ or 3’ end of gO GT1c ORF. For generation of full-length

393

gO BAC mutants, a gO deletion mutant was used in which the whole gO ORF sequence was

394

deleted. This ensured recombination between transfer plasmid and BAC-DNA solely upstream

395

and downstream of the gO ORF sequence. For generation of recombinant BAC mutants,

396

GT3/1c and GT1c/3, original TB40-BAC4-luc BAC DNA was used and both chimeric versions

397

resulted from recombination within the gO GT1c ORF. First, a set of recombination cassettes

398

were generated and the primer pairs used are listed in Supplementary table 1. For this, inserts

399

containing a kanamycin resistance gene, flanked on one side by an 18-bp I-Sce I restriction

400

sequence and a gO GT-specific 50-bp sequence, and on both sides by a Sac I or Nde I restriction

401

site, respectively, were generated by PCR using pEP-Kan-S (kindly provided by Nikolaus

402

Osterrieder). Second, each individual insert was cloned into the corresponding restriction site

403

of gO GT sequence carried by pEX-A258 ordered from Eurofins Genomics (Luxembourg). The

404

resulting transfer plasmids were used as template to generate the PCR-derived recombination

405

cassettes containing extensions of ~50 bp sequences on each end for homologous

406

recombination. The recombination cassettes were electroporated into recombination-competent

407

E.coli GS1783 carrying the full-length or gO-deleted TB40-BAC4-luc DNA. After

408

electroporation, recombination-positive E.colis were subjected to kanamycin selection, and the

409

introduced non-HCMV sequences were removed within E.coli by cleavage at the I-Sce I site

410

and a second red recombination. Positive kanamycin-sensitive, chloramphenicol-resistant

411

bacteria colonies were selected. Finally, recombinant BAC DNAs were isolated from positive

412

clones and the correctness of the BAC DNA sequence was verified by whole genome

413

sequencing (see below). Further, overnight E.coli cultures of positive clones were stored at -80

414

°C until further use.

415
416

BAC-derived gO mutant HCMV strains

417

Infectious viruses were generated by reconstitution as described previously (23). Briefly,

418

mutant BAC DNAs were purified from E.coli using the Nucleobond BAC100 kit (Macherey-

419

Nagel, Düren, Germany). The day before transfection, HFFs were seeded in 6-well plates (3 x

420

105 cells/well) and then 2 µg of BAC DNA, 1 µg of pCMV71 DNA (plasmid was kindly

421

provided by Mark Stinski, University of Iowa) and 9 µl of ViaFect reagent (Promega, Madison,

422

Wisconsin) were mixed together with 100 µl of MEM without antibiotics, incubated for 15 min

423

at room temperature and then added to the cells. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed with

424

PBS and fresh MEM with antibiotics was added. One week after transfection, cells were

425

trypsinized and transferred into 25 cm2 cell culture flasks. When CPE was 90-100%,

426

supernatants were cleared by centrifugation at 4°C for 20 min at 4,000 x g and stored as cell-

427

free viral stocks in aliquots at -80 °C. For infection and inhibition analyses, all aliquots were

428

used only once to avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles. Furthermore, one aliquot per reconstitution

429

was subjected (i) to next generation sequencing to confirm the correctness of the complete UL

and US genomic regions, (ii) to DNase treatment to assess the amount of encapsidated genomes,

431

and (iii) to RLU measurements in order to normalize virus stocks in subsequent experiments.

Two independent reconstitutions were performed for each mutant.

435

DNA from BAC purification (as described above) and extracted DNA from DNase-treated or

436

untreated viral stocks from HFF cell culture supernatants upon reconstitution were quantified

437

using the Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

438

One to two ng of DNA per sample were taken for library preparation using the Nextera XT

439

DNA Library Preparation Kit and uniquely indexed samples using the Nextera XT Index Kit

440

were pooled and sequenced together (both Illumina, San Diego, California). Pooled libraries

441

were sequenced with paired-end reads (2x150-250) on a MiSeq system using v2 or v3

442

sequencing reaction chemistry (Illumina). Data were analyzed by CLC genomics workbench

443

v12 software (Qiagen). Low-quality reads were trimmed and in average 52 - 80% of reads

444

mapped to the reference genome.

446

Determination of encapsidated HCMV genomes in virus stocks

447

In order to remove non-encapsidated viral DNA and free cellular DNA, fibroblast-derived virus

448

stocks were treated with TurboDNase (Thermo Fisher). For this, 100 µl of master mix (73 µl

449

H2O, 20 µl 10x DNase buffer, 5 µl 10x PBS, 2 µl TurboDNase (2 u/µl)) were added to 100 µl

450

of sample and incubated for 1 h at 37°C in a thermoshaker at 1,400 rpm. Immediately thereafter,

451

the total reaction volume was added to 2ml lysis buffer and DNA was extracted using the bead-

452

based NucliSens EasyMag extractor (BioMérieux, Marcy-l'Étoile, France) according to the

453

manufacturer’s protocol. DNA was eluted in 50 µl of nuclease-free H2O.

Normalization of parental and mutant virus stocks

462

The firefly luciferase gene of HCMV strain TB40-BAC4-luc allows to monitor relative light

463

units (RLUs) in infected cell lysates as a read out for infection efficiency (40). For

464

normalization of parental strain and mutant virus stocks to similar RLUs, HFFs and ARPE-19

465

cells were seeded in white, clear, flat-bottom 96-well plates (Corning, Corning, New York) at

466

a density of 1 x 104 cells/well. The following day, viral stocks were serially 2-fold diluted in

467

cell culture medium and 100 µl of viral dilution per well were used to infect the cells in

468

triplicates for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times with PBS, supplied with 100 µl of

469

medium and incubated further at 37 °C for 2 days. RLUs were determined by luciferase assay

470

of cell lysates according to the manufacturer’s protocol (SteadyGlo Luciferase Assay System,

471

Promega) and measured in a Victor Light 1420 plate reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham,

472

Massachusetts). Mean RLUs of triplicates were calculated for normalization. For inhibition

473

assays viral stock dilutions generating 1,000 to 20,000 RLUs for both, HFFs and ARPE-19 cells

474

were used. For determination of relative epithelial cell infectivity viral stock dilutions

generating 300-1,500 RLUs in ARPE-19 cells were used.

480

483

medium and incubated further at 37 °C for 2 days before monitoring mean RLUs of technical

484

triplicates. In parallel, 5 µl of the viral dilution was used to determine the actual number of

485

encapsidated genomes used for infection. The ratio of log10 RLUs to log10 encapsidated

486

genomes of parental strain was set at 1.0 and the fold change of the mutants as compared to

487

parental strain was calculated. Three to four independent experiments per mutant were

performed.

Relative epithelial cell infectivity

492

seeded in white, clear, flat-bottom 96-well plates at a density of 1 x 104 cells/well one day

493

before infection. Two days after infection, RLUs were determined by luciferase assay as

494

mentioned above and the epithelial to fibroblast RLU ratio was calculated. All experiments

495

were performed in technical triplicates and three to four independent experiments were

496

performed.

Production of purified virions for immunoblotting

499

Supernatants from infected HFFs were harvested when cells displayed > 90% CPE and then

500

clarified by centrifugation at 4,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C. After filtration through a 0.45 µm

501

filter (Whatman, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Thermo Fisher) viruses were concentrated by

502

centrifugation at 4 °C using vivaspin 20 concentrators with a molecular weight cutoff of 100K

503

(Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany). Thereafter, virions were purified by ultracentrifugation

504

through a 20% sucrose TAN (0.05 M triethanolamine, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 8.0) cushion for 80 min

505

at 70,000 x g at 4 °C and the pellets were gently resuspended in TAN buffer on ice and stored

506

in aliquots at -80 °C until further use.

Western blot analysis

509

For sample preparation, virus stocks were mixed undiluted or diluted in TAN buffer with an

510

equal volume of reducing 2x sample buffer (125 mM Tris/Cl pH 6.8, 6% SDS, 10% glycerol,

511

10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromophenolblue) and incubated on ice for 10 min before

512

boiling at 95 °C for 10 min. Samples were separated on 10% SDS PAGE gels together with a

513

high-range rainbow marker (Amersham ECL High-Range Rainbow Molecular Weight Marker,

514

GE Healthcare, UK). Separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)

515

membranes (Immun-Blot, Bio-Rad, California, USA) in blotting buffer (40 mM Tris, 39 mM

516

glycine, 1.3 mM SDS, 20% methanol), which were then incubated overnight in blocking buffer

517

(PBS, 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20) at 4 °C. All antibodies (Abs) were diluted in blocking buffer.

518

Primary mouse anti-gH (AP86-SA4) and anti-MCP monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), anti-gO.02

519

mAb, and gB antibody (2F12; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) were incubated for 2 h at RT. Sheep,

520

anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Amersham, GE Healthcare, UK) was used as secondary antibody and

521

incubated for 1 h at RT. SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity substrate (Thermo

522

Fisher) was applied for gO detection according to the manufacturer’s instructions and Pierce

523

ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Fisher) for gH, MCP, and gB detection.

Chemiluminescent signals were visualized and analyzed using the ChemiDoc Imager and the

530

incubated with serial dilutions of soluble forms of PDGFRα-Fc or NRP2-Fc, respectively, for

531

2 hours before infection. Two hours after infection cells were washed twice with 1x PBS,

foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) were infected with parental strain gO GT1c and the panel of gO GT mutants

789

using similar numbers of encapsidated genome equivalents (range: 8.0 – 9.2 log10 copies/ml). Two days

790

post infection relative light units (RLUs) were assessed in cell lysates by luciferase assay as a read out

791

of infection efficiency. Log10 RLU to genome ratio was calculated and the fold change relative to gO

792

GT1c was determined. All experiments were performed in triplicates and data shown are means ± SEM

793

of 2 - 4 independent experiments. B) HFFs and ARPE-19 cells were simultaneously infected with

Two days post infection RLUs were determined and the ratio of fibroblast to epithelial cell RLUs was

796

calculated. All experiments were performed in triplicates and data shown are means ± SEM of 3 - 4

797

independent experiments. Statistical significance was evaluated by ANOVA with Tukey‘s test for

798

multiple comparison. ****p<0.0001; **p<0.01; *p<0.05 in comparison to GT1c.

Figure 3. Comparison of gO and gH content in cell-free virions between parental strain gO GT1c and

817

gO mutants. Virions harvested from human foreskin fibroblast supernatant were subjected to reducing

818

gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western Blot using antibodies directed against glycoproteins gB

819

(anti-gB mAb 2F12), gO (anti-gO.02 mAb) and gH (AP86-SA4). The amount of virions loaded on the gels

820

were compared to gB. Contents of gO and gH were compared between gO GT1c and the respective gO

821

mutants. For each mutant an additional 2-fold dilution was loaded on the gel. Band densities were

822

determined relative to the GT1c reference band for each blot individually, and are shown below the

823

blots.
