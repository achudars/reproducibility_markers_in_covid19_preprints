Abstract

17

The ability to generate autonomously replicating plasmids has been elusive in Candida

18

albicans, a prevalent human fungal commensal and pathogen. Instead, plasmids generally

19

integrate into the genome. Here, we assessed plasmid and transformant properties,

20

including plasmid geometry, transformant colony size, four selectable markers, and

21

potential origins of replication for their ability to drive autonomous plasmid maintenance.

22

Importantly, linear plasmids with terminal telomere repeats yielded many more

23

autonomous transformants than circular plasmids with the identical sequences.

24

Furthermore, we could distinguish by colony size, transient, autonomously replicating and

25

chromosomally integrated transformants (tiny, medium and large, respectively). Candida

26

albicans URA3 and a heterologous marker, ARG4, yielded many transient transformants

27

indicative of weak origin activity; replication of plasmid carrying heterologous LEU2 marker

28

was highly dependent upon the addition of a bona fide origin sequence. Several bona fide

29

chromosomal origins, with an origin fragment of ~100 bp as well as a heterologous origin,

30

panARS, from Kluyveromyces lactis drove autonomous replication, yielding moderate

31

transformation efficiency and plasmid stability. Thus, C. albicans maintains linear plasmids

32

that yield high transformation efficiency and are maintained autonomously in an origin-

33

dependent manner.

34

Importance

35

Circular plasmids are important tools for molecular manipulation in model fungi such as

36

baker’s yeast, yet, in Candida albicans, an important yeast pathogen of humans, prior

37

studies were not able to generate circular plasmids that were autonomous (duplicated

38

without inserting themselves into the chromosome). Here, we found that linearizing circular

39

plasmids with sequences from telomeres, the chromosome ends, allows the plasmids to

40

duplicate and segregate in C. albicans. We used this system to identify chromosomal

41

sequences that facilitate the initiation of plasmid replication (origins) and to show that a

42

~100 bp fragment of a C. albicans origin, as well as an origin sequence from a distantly

43

related yeast, can both function as origins in C. albicans. Thus, the requirements for plasmid

44

geometry, but not necessarily for origin sequences, differ between C. albicans and baker’s

45

yeast.

Introduction

60

Plasmids are autonomously replicating extrachromosomal elements that facilitate molecular

61

studies in bacteria as well as in yeasts and other fungi (1). Some yeast species carry natural

62

plasmids, either as circles (e.g., 2µ in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2)), or as linears (e.g., killer

63

plasmids in Kluveromyces lactis (3), and mitochondrial plasmids in Fusarium oxysporum (4,

64

5)). Plasmid replication requires, among other components, an origin DNA sequence to

65

which the origin recognition complex (ORC) binds. Origins of replication initiation (ORIs) on

66

chromosomes and plasmids appear to have different sequence requirements in different

67

yeast species (6). In S. cerevisiae, autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs: ORIs able to

68

drive plasmid replication) are modular, requiring a minimum of 100 bp that includes an

69

11bp ARS consensus sequence (ACS) (7-9) and a T-rich ‘B element’ (10, 11). In most other

70

organisms, the DNA requirements for centromere and ORI function are less well defined: K.

71

lactis requires a 50 bp ACS that is necessary and sufficient for ARS activity (12); and

72

Schizosaccharomyces pombe has no specific ARS consensus but requires a region of >500 bp

73

with multiple A-T hook motifs that binds ORC (13-15).

74

In Candida albicans, a common human fungal commensal and an opportunistic pathogen,

75

ORIs have been only partially characterized. C. albicans origins, like those of S. pombe and

76

higher eukaryotes, have longer and less well-defined DNA motifs (16). Prior work with S.

77

cerevisiae identified ARSs based on their high transformation efficiency (17, 18). Early

78

studies found that ScARS plasmids with circular or linear geometry could be maintained

79

autonomously for some time (19, 20). Work in C. albicans identified a few sequences that

80

conferred high transformation efficiency on circular plasmids (21-27). However, the

81

resulting transformants were either highly unstable (transient transformants) or the plasmid

82

rapidly integrated into the genome (integrants). The CaURA3 marker used in many of these

83

studies, was later found to have an intrinsic weak ARS activity (28), and there was no direct

84

evidence that replication initiated from the inserted sequences.

85

We previously used a machine learning approach to identify proposed-origins (pro-ORIs)

86

based on ORC binding activity and nucleosome occupancy patterns (28). Four pro-ORIs were

87

shown to be bona fide origins that produced replication bubble structures on non-

88

denaturing 2-dimensional (2-D) DNA gels, thereby providing direct evidence of ORI function

89

(28). Importantly, all four bona fide ORIs also drove plasmid replication on linear (but not

90

circular) plasmids derived from circles carrying long inverted telomere repeats separated by

91

a spacer sequence that is cleaved to linearize the plasmid (29). These large plasmids with

92

inverted telomere sequences could work well, but were prone to rearrangement during

93

propagation of the circular precursor plasmid in E. coli.

94

Here, we compared circular and linear plasmids in C. albicans that rely on bona fide ORIs for

95

their maintenance. Linear plasmids were constructed from circles de novo by PCR with

96

primers bearing telomeric repeats prior to transformation. Linear plasmids consistently had

97

higher transformation efficiency, larger numbers of autonomous transformants and higher

98

mitotic stability than analogous circular plasmids. Transformant colony size was a clear

99

reflection of plasmid stability, with tiny colonies indicative of unstable, transient

100

transformants, medium colonies indicative of autonomous transformants with moderate

101

stability levels, and large, smooth colonies were indicative of integrants, in which plasmid

102

was inserted at chromosomal positions. We also tested four markers, including CaURA3 and

103

CaHIS1, as well as heterologous markers, CdARG4 and CmLEU2 (30), which all had different

104

levels of origin-dependent transformation efficiency and maintenance. Finally, we tested

105

bona fide ORIs (28) as well as origin fragments and heterologous origin sequences, and

106

found that a ~100 bp ORI fragment, and a K. lactis panARS (31) have moderate origin activity

107

in C. albicans.

Results

109

Circular CaURA3 plasmids with and without ORIs

110

Overall, across the markers and plasmids tested, three types of transformant colonies were

111

evident. Tiny colonies that could not be maintained on selection (Fig. S1A and B) with

112

undetectable plasmid retention (MS ~0) indicative of rapid plasmid loss were defined as

113

transient transformants (referred to as transients hereafter) (Table 1). Large, round

114

colonies, with short lag time and doubling time (Table 1, Fig. S1C) were defined as

115

integrants based on their highly stability under selection (MS ~80-100%). Medium colonies

116

(MS 1-80%) that grow, albeit less well than integrants under selection, with comparatively

117

longer lag and doubling times (Table 1, Fig. S1D), were defined as autonomously replicating

118

transformants (ARS-transformants) assuming that replicating plasmids can be maintained

119

under selection, and lost in the absence of selection. Accordingly, colony size can reliably

120

predict the MS of plasmids and used as a proxy for the number of different transformant

121

types.

122

To test the hypothesis that bona fide ORIs drive the autonomous replication of plasmids in

123

C. albicans, we first constructed circular plasmids with the CaURA3 marker similar to those

124

from prior studies (22, 23, 25-27) with and without bona fide ORI410 (28) (Fig. 1A). We

125

compared transformation parameters including transformation efficiency (TE, number of

126

transformants/µg of DNA), size of the transformant colonies (tiny (<0.4 mm); medium (0.4-

127

1.6mm) and large (>1.6mm), Table 1), mitotic stability (MS, proportion of cells that retain

128

the plasmid under selection) and plasmid loss rate (LR, rate of plasmid loss per generation in

129

the absence of selection). TE with and without ORI410 was relatively modest (17 and 9

130

transformants/µg DNA, respectively (Fig. 1B)). Importantly, all selected colonies were tiny

131

(<0.4 mm), with and without inclusion of ORI410 (Fig. 1B). The tiny colonies did not grow

132

upon re-streaking, or when seeded into liquid cultures (Fig. S1A), that is a characteristic of

133

transients. Thus, as in several prior studies (22, 23, 25, 27), circular CaURA3 plasmids were

134

not maintained autonomously.

135

Because this result conflicts with the claim that two sequences, ORI7-R1 and ORI7-L1, drive

136

the replication of a circular CaURA3 plasmid (26), we constructed plasmids with these

137

sequences in pCir-CaURA3. Both of them had modest TE (8 and 18 transformants,

138

respectively, Fig. 1B). We obtained only transients for ORI7-R1 with TE similar to the no-ORI

139

plasmid; ORI7-L1 gave twice as many transients compared to no-ORI plasmid, and produced

140

a small number of stable transformants (Fig. 1B), indicating that they integrated into the

141

genome. Thus, neither of the two CEN7 flanking sequences yielded autonomous

142

transformants in the context of a circular CaURA3 plasmid (Fig. 1B), consistent with the poor

143

performance of pCir-CaURA3-ORI410. Similar results for pCir-CaURA3 with ORI410, ORI7-L1

144

and ORI7-R1 were also evident in a second strain background (Table S1).

145

Comparison of different selectable markers on circular plasmid

146

We next asked if the C. albicans HIS1 (CaHIS1) marker would show better TE and MS than

147

CaURA3, with the goal of obtaining ARS-transformants. However, CaHIS1 plasmid yielded

148

small numbers of transformants (32 and 25, with and without ORI410, respectively), with a

149

modest increase (~25%) in TE attributable to ORI410 (Fig. 1C). pCir-CaHIS1 ARS-

150

transformants had MS <5% and plasmid loss rates of ~0.9 (Fig. 1D), indicating that they were

151

autonomous but highly unstable. Thus, in addition to transients and integrants (analyzed in

152

more detail below), pCir-CaHIS1 produced a small number of ARS-transformants- a group

153

not detected with pCir-CaURA3 (Fig. 1C).

154

Because heterologous markers are less likely to integrate into the genome, we tested

155

CmLEU2 marker from Candida maltosa and CdARG4 marker from Candida dubliniensis (30).

156

With the addition of ORI410, TE of CmLEU2 was increased by ~3-times (Fig. 1C), and most of

157

them were ARS-transformants with MS <5% (Fig. 1D) compared to only transients without

158

ORI410; no large colonies were detected. Thus, CmLEU2 produced a small number of ARS-

159

transformants with low MS upon addition of ORI410.

160

By contrast, CdARG4 had a 5-fold higher TE with ORI410 on the plasmid relative to without

161

the ORI; ~50% being ARS-transformants (Fig. 1C) that had MS ~10% for those with ORI410

162

and MS ~5% for those without the ORI (Fig. 1D). Thus, CdARG4 with ORI410 yielded more

163

than 100 ARS-transformants/µg of DNA, with an improved MS (but with LR remaining quite

164

high (Fig. 1D)). However, while ORI410 was required for high TE, and improved MS, it was

165

not required for some autonomous plasmid replication. We suggest that CdARG4 sequence

166

might enable a weak ORI to form on the plasmid (discussed later). Thus, for circular

167

plasmids with all four selectable markers tested, the inclusion of an origin was not sufficient

168

to produce relatively stable autonomously replicating plasmids (low MS and high LR). This

169

indicates that a heterologous marker can drive autonomous replication of a circular plasmid

170

with rare integration events, but they are lost at high frequency.

171

We also asked if autonomous plasmids were detectable in DNA extracts from the medium

172

colonies (low MS and high LR). Indeed, Southern blot of DNA from medium colonies (Fig.

173

S2A) detected bands with similar electrophoretic mobility to that of naked circular plasmids.

174

By contrast, in the DNA from a pCir-CdARG4-ORI410 large colony with high MS (presumed

175

integrant), a larger band was detected along with autonomously replicating plasmid (Fig.

176

S2A), indicating integration in some cells in a population. This is consistent with the idea

177

that large colonies contain integrated plasmid and medium colonies contain autonomously

178

replicating plasmids. Moreover, analysis of the CaHIS1 integrants found gene replacement

179

at the native locus by single cross-over (Fig. S3A).

180

Linear plasmids with telomere ends are maintained autonomously

181

Since circular plasmids did not yield high TE and high MS for ARS-transformants, we

182

constructed and transformed linear plasmids, which are known to replicate autonomously

183

in some fungal model organisms (4, 32-35). Since classical methods of producing linear

184

plasmids (29) used for monitoring origin function in C. albicans (28) proved challenging, we

185

designed a new approach in which linear plasmids were constructed from circular plasmids

186

by PCR (details in methods, Fig. 2A) and transformed directly into C. albicans.

187

Because telomere sequences are not necessary to be added to linear DNA during

188

transformation in some fungal models (4, 32-34), we asked if the presence and the length of

189

the telomere repeats (34 nt vs 57 nt TEL, i.e. 1.5X vs 2.5X of a single 23 nt C. albicans TEL

190

repeat (36)) affects transformation parameters. Linear plasmids without TEL repeats had a

191

TE of ~300/µg for all three markers tested (CaHIS1, CdARG4 and CmLEU2) with the majority

192

being transients (Fig. 2B). CaHIS1 linear plasmid without telomere repeats, resulted in

193

higher TE, increased number of ARS-transformants but also an increase in integration events

194

compared to the corresponding circular plasmid (Fig. 2B vs Fig. 1C). Notably, CmLEU2 linear

195

plasmid without telomere repeats, resulted in a much higher TE and ARS-transformants

196

(~50/µg DNA) than the corresponding circular plasmid (<10/µg DNA, (Fig. 2B vs Fig. 1C)). The

197

CdARG4 plasmid, was an exception yielding similar TE in circular and linear plasmid without

198

telomeres (Fig. 2B vs Fig. 1C). However, all of the ARS-transformants obtained had low MS

199

(<5%) (Fig. 2C) with an irregular colony shape, indicating that they were not readily

200

maintained in the autonomous state and higher proportions of cells failed to divide in the

201

colony under selection conditions.

202

Adding TEL repeats to linear plasmids increased the number of ARS-transformants for both

203

CdARG4 and CmLEU2 plasmids, compared to those without TEL repeats (Fig. 2B). By

204

contrast, TEL sequence addition increased the TE only for CdARG4 plasmids, among the

205

three markers tested. Furthermore, adding TEL repeats increased the MS of ARS-

206

transformants by 2-6-fold (MS ~10-35%) for all three markers. Thus, relative to circular

207

plasmids, linearized plasmids with terminal TEL repeats produced more ARS-transformants

208

with higher MS (Fig. 2B and 2C), and the ARS-transformants displayed shorter lag time and

209

doubling time (Table 1, Fig. S1E and S1F). By contrast, when 1.5X TEL sequence was included

210

on circular plasmids, there was no significant change in any of the transformation

211

parameters relative to the corresponding circular plasmids (Fig. S4A and S4B). Thus, it is

212

likely the linear geometry of the plasmids, along with the inclusion of telomere sequence,

213

that resulted in an increase in ARS-transformants and MS (see discussion). Since we found

214

no obvious advantage to including 2.5X vs 1.5X TEL repeats, we used plasmids linearized

215

with the 1.5X TEL repeats in all subsequent studies.

216

We next asked if linear plasmids carrying 1.5X TEL repeats were maintained autonomously.

217

The ARS-transformants obtained exhibited moderate MS even after three passages,

218

indicating that they were maintained autonomously over a few generations (Table S2).

219

220

showed a single band with electrophoretic mobility similar to that of the naked linear DNA

221

molecule used for transformation. We also recovered pLin-CmLEU2-ORI410 molecules from

222

ARS-transformants in E. coli (Fig. S5), demonstrating autonomous replication in vivo. Copy

223

number of the linear plasmids in ARS-transformants, measured by qPCR, ranged widely (~2-

224

50 per cell, accounting for MS) (Fig. 2D).

225

By contrast, CaHIS1 transformants with moderate MS (45% and 63%) produced larger

226

plasmid-hybridizing bands on Southern blot indicative of genomic integration (Fig. S2B).

227

Further analysis of these CaHIS1 integrants indicated gene replacement at the native locus

228

either by double cross-over or gene conversion event (Fig. S3B). This is consistent with the

229

idea that plasmids with homologous marker can yield integrants apart from ARS-

230

transformants.

231

Effect of marker gene and bona fide ORIs on transformation parameters

232

We next asked to what extent a bona fide ORI sequence (ORI410) affected the

233

transformation parameters of linear plasmids with different markers. With both

234

homologous markers, CaURA3 and CaHIS1, there were some integration events, initially

235

more frequent for CaHIS1, although when propagated under selection, many of the CaURA3

236

plasmids integrated (MS ~80-100% and LR <0.1 per generation, Fig. 3B). Furthermore, for

237

CaURA3 and CdARG4, addition of ORI410 had no effect on the number of ARS-

238

transformants (Fig. 3A), but improved plasmid stability compared to circular plasmids (Fig.

239

3B). This suggests that there may be a cryptic, intrinsic origin activity within CaURA3 and

240

CdARG4 marker fragments (1.3 and 3.1 kb, respectively) that obviates the use of these

241

markers to monitor the contributions of ORIs to plasmid replication and maintenance

242

(discussed below). Similar results for CaHIS1 and CdARG4 were evident in different lab

243

strains (Fig. S6). By contrast, addition of ORI410 on pLin-CmLEU2 resulted in ~5-fold increase

244

in TE, ~14-fold increase in ARS-transformants and improved plasmid stability (Fig. 3B)

245

relative to pLin-CmLEU2 (Fig. 3A), suggesting that CmLEU2 does not carry intrinsic ARS

246

activity seen on other markers.

247

Given that all markers were inserted in the same position on a plasmid, which does not have

248

any obvious origin-promoting sequence features, we tested the hypothesis that some

249

feature required for origin firing is present at higher levels in CaURA3, CaHIS1 and CdARG4

250

relative to CmLEU2; though, many CaHIS1 ARS-transformants integrate into the genome

251

after additional passages. Since the length of CaHIS1 and CmLEU2 are similar, it seems

252

unlikely that marker length is an important factor. Interestingly, the AT content of the two

253

markers CmLEU2 (62.3%) and CaHIS1 (63.3%) with higher levels of ORI-dependent ARS-

254

transformants (Fig. 3A), was below the average AT-content of the C. albicans genome

255

(66.7%), while the AT-content of CaURA3 (68.4%) and CdARG4 (69.1%) was higher than that

256

of the C. albicans genome. Thus, it appears that the markers with cryptic ORI function

257

(CaURA3 and CdARG4) that interferes with bona fide ORI activity have higher AT content. Of

258

note, neither ORIs alone, nor sequences on markers with possible cryptic ARSs share any

259

obvious conserved primary sequence motifs. Based on its ORI-dependence, CmLEU2 is the

260

most effective of the markers tested for comparing ORI activity.

261

Comparing different bona fide origins and ORI410 fragments

262

Four ORIs from C. albicans (ORI410 as well as ORI1055, ORI1046 andORI246), defined

263

previously as ‘bona fide’ ORIs (28), were inserted into pLin-CmLEU2 to examine their

264

function compared to no origin. All four bona fide ORIs, yielded high TEs (~150-600/µg

265

DNA), ARS-transformants (~75-300/µg DNA) (Fig. 4A) with moderate MS (10-45%) and
12

266

plasmid LR (0.2-0.7 per generation) (Fig. 4B). ORI1046 consistently yielded the highest TE

267

and ARS-transformants (~300/µg DNA). Both negative control plasmids pLin-CmLEU2 (No

268

ORI) or with proORI1088, a genomic ORC binding region that did not produce replication

269

bubble arcs in 2-D gels (28) gave much lower TE and ARS-transformants (31 and 44/µg

270

DNA). Thus, all four bona fide ORIs can drive the origin-dependent autonomous replication

271

of pLin-CmLEU2 (Fig. 4A).

272

In S. cerevisiae, where the ACS is 11 bp, ARS function is only detected when the

273

transforming fragment is ~100 bp including ACS (7, 8, 37, 38). We asked if two small

274

overlapping fragments (178 bp and 97 bp) derived from ORI410 (1.2 kb) (28) were able to

275

retain minimum ARS function in C. albicans. ORI410_97 had 2-3 times higher TE (~170

276

transformants/µg DNA) and ~3 times higher ARS-transformants than no ORI control (Fig.

277

4A). While the TE and the number of ARS-transformants for ORI410_97 was lower than for

278

the entire ORI410, the ARS-transformants had moderate MS (10-15%) and LR (~0.4 per

279

generation) (Fig. 4B). Thus, an ORI fragment of only ~100 bp can drive linear plasmid

280

replication, and can yield ARS-transformants, which are 2-3-fold more stable than analogous

281

circular plasmid carrying the entire ORI410 fragment.

282

Heterologous ARS sequences

283

C. albicans centromeres are regional and epigenetic, which contrasts with the point

284

centromeres of S. cerevisiae (16). Since plasmid replication and origin function were difficult

285

to demonstrate in C. albicans, we asked whether heterologous ARS fragments would

286

function in C. albicans. The “panARS”, a 452bp fragment from K. lactis genome functions as

287

an active ORI in a range of Saccharomycotina yeast species with diverse ARS requirements;

288

in some cases, even more efficiently than average homologous ARSs (e.g. P. pastoris) (31).

289

The “ARS1max”, an origin from S. cerevisiae was selected to drive better growth rates and

290

lower plasmid LR than the original ARS1 (39). Thus, we tested the ability of both the

291

sequences to direct C. albicans plasmid replication on pLin-CmLEU2 (pLin-CmLEU2+panARS

292

and pLin-CmLEU2+ARS1max) relative to pLin-CmLEU2+ORI410 and pLin-CmLEU2.

293

The pLin-CmLEU2+panARS plasmid resulted in ~2-3-times higher TE and ARS-transformants

294

relative to pLin-CmLEU2 (Fig. 4A). The panARS ARS-transformants had moderate MS (~10-

295

20%) and LR (~0.3 per generation) comparable to those with ORI410_97 (Fig. 4B). This

296

suggests that the sequence requirements of C. albicans origin function are at least partially

297

conserved with those of K. lactis among other Saccharomycotina species. By contrast, pLin-

298

CmLEU2+ARS1max, had transformation parameters inferior to those of control plasmid

299

pLin-CmLEU2; lower TE, ARS-transformants with lowest MS (<8%) and highest LRs (~0.8 per

300

generation) (Fig. 4A and B) detected for any linear plasmid. This supports the idea that

301

sequence requirements for origins in C. albicans (and other yeasts, for example, Pichia

302

pastoris (40)) are distinct from those in S. cerevisiae.

303

Discussion

304

Early studies seeking potential origin sequences based on their ability to confer high TE,

305

usually used circular plasmids with CaURA3 as the selectable (and counter-selectable)

306

marker (22, 23, 25, 27). However, most transformants were highly unstable or rapidly

307

integrated into the genome and thus were not useful for autonomous plasmid maintenance.

308

Here we systematically compared four selectable markers in plasmids with circular or linear

309

geometries to monitor the function of ORI sequences. Importantly, a ~100 bp fragment (28)

310

or the heterologous panARS (31) was sufficient to provide ARS function on a plasmid in C.

311

albicans. This implies that sequence requirements for origin function in C. albicans are

312

shared with distantly related yeasts. Nevertheless, the ability of cryptic ARSs on marker

313

sequences to generate transient transformants implies that the sequence requirements for

314

ARS function (and most likely chromosomal ORI function as well) are dependent on

315

sequence context, possibly AT-richness, and other features that are not yet well

316

understood.

317

An important insight from this work is that transformant colony size provides a useful

318

preliminary indicator of plasmid mitotic stability. Presumably, colony size reflects the degree

319

to which the plasmid replication and/or segregation enables growth of individual cells in a

320

population under selective conditions. Specifically, in tiny or ‘pin-point’ colonies (25),

321

plasmids are lost rapidly; in large colonies, plasmids are integrated stably (Table 1). In

322

medium colonies, plasmids are moderately stable (Table 1) because they replicate

323

autonomously, with some cells retaining the plasmid and others losing it. Of note, ARS-

324

transformants with plasmids carrying homologous markers, sometimes integrate in

325

subsequent passages (generating larger colony sub-clones), a property less prevalent with

326

the heterologous markers. Nonetheless, all markers on linear plasmids yield ARS-

327

transformants, which initially can be identified based on colony size.

328

Circular vs linear plasmids: In S. cerevisiae, linear plasmids and mini-chromosomes were

329

used to study chromosome components and to propagate large segments of DNA (41, 42).

330

However, most work was done with circular plasmids that are readily propagated in E. coli;

331

propagation of linearizable plasmids with inverted telomere repeats (29, 43-45) was labor

332

intensive and subject to recombination of the repeats in E. coli. Here, a simple approach

333

obviates many of these technical challenges by synthesizing linear plasmids from circles

15

334

immediately prior to transformation (Fig. 2A). Thus, the two plasmid geometries are directly

335

comparable, differing only by the presence or absence of 1.5X TEL repeats.

336

Does the presence of TEL sequence alone improve the segregation of linear vs circular

337

plasmids? In C. albicans as in S. cerevisiae, adding TEL sequences to linear plasmids

338

improves their stability (46) (Fig. 2C). However, adding TEL sequences does not improve

339

circular plasmid segregation in C. albicans (Fig. S4); by contrast, TEL sequences on circles

340

stabilized ScARS plasmids (47) and antagonized the segregation of ScCEN plasmids (48).

341

Thus, CaTEL sequence function is required for autonomous linear plasmid maintenance and

342

is dependent upon its geometry: in a chromosome end context, but not within a circular

343

context. This supports the idea that interactions between non-terminal TEL DNA and

344

telomeric proteins likely differ between C. albicans and S. cerevisiae and that linear plasmids

345

require telomere ends to remain stable.

346

In S. cerevisiae, non-centromeric plasmids are retained in the mother cells due to their

347

attachment with nuclear membrane (49) as well the presence of a diffusion barrier at the

348

bud neck (50). It is tempting to speculate if this is also true for circular plasmids (with or

349

without TEL) in C. albicans. Whether and how the linear plasmids might be more able to

350

segregate to daughter cells remains to be explored.

351

Effect of selectable markers: Comparison of the markers found that CaURA3 was not ideal,

352

which explains difficulties in many earlier investigations (25, 26) and addition of LEU2 or

353

HIS1 to CaURA3 plasmids relied on URA3 selection as well (22, 27). Studies selecting for

354

IMH3R or CaADE2 found that putative ARS-transformants integrated at high frequency (21,

355

25). Sometimes integration events involved and/or altered the putative origin structure (24)

356

and the resulting plasmids were not maintained autonomously. Notably, CaURA3 linear
16

357

plasmid produced very few ARS-transformants, with or without ORI addition, and these

358

eventually integrated into the genome (Fig. 3). By contrast, ARS-transformants with either

359

CaHIS1, CdARG4 or CmLEU2 were maintained over three passages (Table S2).

360

We suggest the appearance of transient transformants cannot be used to define origin

361

function on a plasmid, especially when CaURA3 marker with latent origin activity is used.

362

Therefore, transients seen with ORI7-L1 and –R1 cannot be used to make conclusions about

363

the function of these chromosomal regions as origins, especially since the published data

364

lacks a control plasmid containing the CaURA3 marker without an origin (26). Transient

365

transformants with these origins have been used to postulate that centromere function

366

required a pre-existing origin. However, our results showing that these chromosomal

367

regions do not act as origins, together with published neocentromere locations at

368

chromosomal regions that did not contain pre-existing origins (51, 52), support a model

369

where kinetochore assembly can convert a non-origin region to an origin. Furthermore, if

370

many genome sequences can recruit replication factors and provide weak origin function on

371

a plasmid as in S. pombe (14, 53), it is not surprising that sequences within neocentromere

372

regions may recruit origins to new loci. The dramatically increased origin efficiency of the

373

neocentromeric loci is likely due to neocentromere-mediated recruitment of replication

374

initiation activities like Cdc7-Dbf4, which is normally found at wild-type centromeres (54).

375

Heterologous CdARG4 did not integrate frequently, yet, it gave high numbers of ARS-

376

transformants in the absence of an added ORI. We posit that both CaURA3 and CdARG4

377

have weak intrinsic ARS activity and that this may compete with a bona fide ORI when both

378

are on a plasmid. This suggests that C. albicans, like S. pombe, has “cryptic origins” (55), i.e.,

379

sites that are normally not used for replication initiation, yet have the potential to form

17

380

active replication origins. It also suggests that, once a cryptic origin has been established, it

381

can continue to function, perhaps because, once well-established in an ARS-transformant, a

382

weak origin may be more likely to fire in the next cell cycle. What the requirements for

383

cryptic ARS function are, remains elusive. We cannot rule out the possibility that chromatin

384

structure and topological constraints might affect ARS activity.

385

Why might inefficient ORIs interfere with bona fide ORI activity? In S. cerevisiae, two ORIs in

386

close proximity in the genome interfere with each other (56). Three mechanisms were

387

proposed to explain this: 1) timing of ORI firing might differ such that the non-firing ORI is

388

replicated passively; 2) DNA at the two ORIs might interfere topologically (e.g., via altered

389

supercoiling); or 3) the two origins may compete for a limited number of licensing factors

390

(e.g., ORC-associated proteins) (56). Interestingly, the orientation of ORC sites relative to

391

one another could also be relevant (57) and all six predicted ORC sites (28) on CmLEU2 are

392

oriented in the same direction, while predicted ORC sites (28) on the other three markers

393

were found in both orientations. While mechanisms of CaORI and ScORI firing are likely to

394

differ to some degree, these options may explain the phenomenon in C. albicans as well.

395

Most organisms do not have highly defined ARS consensus sequences, and appears that this

396

is the case in C. albicans as well. In S. pombe, ORIs have average AT content ranging from

397

72-75% (58), with an average of 64% in the genome. CaURA3 and CdARG4 have 68.4% and

398

69.1%, respectively, with an average of 66.7% AT content in the genome. Furthermore, for

399

all four markers on linear plasmids, the number of polyA tracts (≥3 nucleotides, normalized

400

for marker length) correlated well (R2= 0.85) with the number of transients obtained. This is

401

consistent with the idea that AT rich sequences and/or polyA tracts may attract replication

402

factors, and acquire cryptic ORI function. This, in turn, might interfere with bona fide ORI

403

firing on the plasmid by mechanisms like those proposed for S. cerevisiae (56).

404

Testing origin function: The linear CmLEU2 plasmid backbone provided the first opportunity

405

to compare the efficiency of different bona fide ORIs, ORI410-derived fragments (28) as well

406

as heterologous origins (31, 39). All four bona fide ORIs yielded high numbers of ARS-

407

transformants as well as moderate MS and LRs (Fig. 4). We do not know why the 178 bp

408

fragment, ORI410_178, had little or no obvious origin function while a smaller fragment

409

derived from it (ORI410_97) was active. Clearly, DNA primary sequence is not sufficient to

410

confer ORI function. We presume that sequence features, together with their context

411

relative to other plasmid components affect ORI activity, which has been seen on ScARS

412

plasmids as well (59). Importantly, the synthetic panARS, which was derived from K. lactis

413

(31), had transformation parameters similar to those of ORI410_97. Thus, the requirements

414

for replication origin function in C. albicans are at least partially conserved with other

415

Saccharomycotina species and panARS provides a heterologous ORI that should not

416

integrate into the genome. We suggest that it might be possible to whittle down the 452 bp

417

panARS to generate a relatively good heterologous ORI of ~100 bp.

418

Summary

419

ARS function can be studied in C. albicans using a heterologous marker and a bona fide ORI

420

of as small as ~100 bp or the heterologous panARS on linear plasmids carrying 1.5X TEL

421

ends. Importantly, linear plasmid conformation greatly facilitates transformation efficiency

422

and mitotic stability. Unexpectedly, the choice of selectable marker has a major effect on

423

the degree to which plasmids are maintained autonomously. To date, CmLEU2 is the single

424

marker that has a low level of intrinsic cryptic origin activity, and rare integration events,

425

making it ideal for studying origin activity on a plasmid. The linear plasmids described here

426

fill a major gap in the tools available for conventional molecular manipulations of C. albicans

427

and will facilitate our ability to study molecular aspects of ORI, telomeric, and centromeric

structure and function.

Materials and Methods

430

Strains, plasmids, primers and growth conditions

431

Yeast strains and plasmids used are listed in Table 2. Primers used are provided in Table 3.

432

C. albicans strains were grown at 30 °C in YPAD medium (60) or SD minimal medium or SD-

433

Complete medium (60) containing leucine at 170 mg/l and all other amino acids (Sigma

434

Aldrich, USA) at 85 mg/l.

435

E. coli DH5α was used for all cloning experiments and was grown in LB medium (60) at 37°C

436

with Ampicillin (Sigma Aldrich, USA) at 100 µg/ml.

437

Cloning of selection markers and ORIs in plasmids

438

Selection markers and ORIs were amplified with primers (Table 2) carrying 15-40 bp

439

homology to the vector and ~20 bp homology to the marker or ORI fragment. Amplified

440

vector and insert (1:3 ratio) were assembled in 20 µl Gibson reaction (61) as per

441

manufacturer’s instructions (NEB, USA) and 2 µl was transformed into chemically competent

442

E. coli (NEB, USA). Following selection on LB+ampicillin overnight, recombinants were

443

detected by colony PCR using primers to the vector, outside of the cloning sites. Putative

444

positive clones were then confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

445

Construction of linear plasmids

446

Linearizing primers (BP1252, BP1253, BP1254, BP1255; Table 2) contained (from 5’ and 3’)

447

34 or 57 nt telomere sequence (36); AflII and BamHI recognition sites; and then homology

448

to the plasmid AatII site. Linear plasmids were amplified from circular plasmids (Fig. 2A) by

449

two-step PCR using Kappa HiFi HotStart polymerase (Roche, Swtizerland). Cycling conditions

450

were: 98C denaturation step for 30 sec; 30 cycles of 98C (10 sec), 72C (30 sec/kb); final

451

extension, 72C for 10 min.

452

To generate linear plasmids without telomeric ends, the circular plasmids were amplified

453

with primers (BP1204, BP1205; Table 2) using Phusion polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific,

454

USA). Cycling conditions were: 98C denaturation step for 30 sec; 25 cycles of 98C (10 sec),

455

60C (30 sec), 72C for (30 sec/kb); final extension step at 72C for 10 min.

456

Colony PCR

457

A small portion of the colony was resuspended in the PCR reaction with Taq polymerase

458

(Hy-Taq Ready Mix, Hy-labs, Israel). Cycling conditions were: 95C denaturation step for 5

459

min; 25 cycles of 95C (30 sec), annealing at a primer-dependent temperature (30 sec), 72C

460

(1 min/kb); final extension step at 72C for 5 min.

461

High efficiency transformation of C. albicans

462

C. albicans transformation was carried out as described in (62) with the only difference that

463

DTT was added at a final concentration of 25 mM and after 45 min incubation with LiAc-TE,

464

the cells were further incubated with DTT for 1.5 h.

465

Mitotic stability assay

466

Yeast transformants were inoculated into SDC(-AA) (selective) media and grown overnight

467

at 30˚C. The cultures were 10-fold serially diluted and appropriate dilution to yield 100-200

468

colonies was plated onto both SDC (-AA) and SDC plates. The plates were incubated at 30°C

469

and the number of colonies were counted after 2 days. Mitotic stability was calculated as:
No. of colonies on SDC (−AA)
∗ 100
No. of colonies on SDC

470

471

Plasmid loss assay

472

Yeast transformants grown overnight in SDC (-AA) for mitotic stability assay were diluted

473

100-fold into SDC media and grown overnight at 30˚C. The cultures were 10-fold serially

474

diluted and 5 µl of each dilution was spotted on both SDC (-AA) and SDC plates. The plates

475

were incubated at 30˚C for 2 days and the number of colonies were counted from the

476

highest dilution where they were well separated. The proportion of cells that retained the

477

plasmid without selection was calculated as (No. of colonies on SDC (-AA)/ No. of colonies

478

on SDC) from the same dilution. The plasmid loss rate was then determined as described in

479

Longtine et. al. (47).

480

Southern blotting

481

The genomic DNA was extracted from 10 ml overnight grown cultures in SDC (-AA) as

482

described in (62). 15-20 µg genomic DNA was digested overnight with ApaI and run on 1%

483

agarose gel for 16-20 h at 1.4V/cm. Southern blotting was performed as described in (63).

484

PCR fragment of AMPR gene was used to probe the plasmids on the blot.

486

qPCR to determine plasmid copy number

487

qPCR was carried out with the genomic DNA from autonomous transformants using SYBR

488

green master mix (Bio-Rad, USA) as per manufacturer’s protocol in BioRad CFX96 TouchTM

489

Real-Time PCR Detection System. Cycling conditions were: 95˚C (3 min); 40 cycles of 95˚C (5

490

sec), 60˚C (30 sec); melt curve from 65.0 to 95.0 for 5 sec. The AMPR gene was used to

491

determine plasmid copy number and CEN of chromosome 1 was used as a reference gene.

492

The two primer sets used had similar efficiency in the reaction; therefore, fold change in the

493

copy number of plasmids was determined relative to the genomic control. Copy number of

494

plasmids was calculated as:

495

Copy number = (Fold change ∗ 2)/MS

496

Growth rate determination

497

From fresh transformation plate, three independent colonies per colony size were

498

inoculated into 2 ml SDC (-AA) and grown overnight at 30˚C, 250 rpm. 50 µl of cell culture

499

was washed with ddH20 and re-suspended in 1 ml SDC (-AA); 10 µl was inoculated in 100 µl

500

SDC (-AA) in a 96-well round bottom sterile polystyrene plates (Corning). For tiny colonies

501

that could not be propagated in liquid media, three independent colonies were directly

502

inoculated from the plate into 100 µl SDC (-AA). The plate was subsequently incubated at

503

30˚C in a Tecan Infinite F200 Pro (Tecan, Switzerland) microplate incubator/spectrometer

504

with a shaking duration of 900 sec and the OD600 was collected every 15 min over a 24 h

505

period. OD vs Time was plotted to generate growth curves.

Recovery of pLin-CmLEU2-ORI410 plasmid from autonomous transformants

509

The genomic DNA from the yeast transformants was digested with BamHI (NEB, USA) to cut

510

the linear plasmid at both the ends resulting in removal of telomere repeats. The digested

511

DNA was ligated overnight with T4 DNA ligase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The ligation

512

product was transformed into electrocompetent E. coli (64) and the clones obtained were

513

confirmed by PCR primers flanking the ligation site followed by sequencing.

Figure 1. (A) Map of a circular plasmid showing relative position of selection markers (CaURA3, CaHIS1,
CdARG4, CmLEU2) and ORI sequence. (B) pCir-CaURA3 plasmid with different origin sequences:
transformation efficiency, types of colonies and their mitotic stability. The transformation efficiency is an
average of three independent experiments. (C) Comparison of circular plasmids carrying different selection
markers with and without ORI410: transformation efficiency, proportion of different types of transformants
and log2 value of the ratio of average number of transient or autonomous transformants with ORI to
without ORI (ORI410/ORI-). Different markers are represented by different colors and different types of
transformants are represented by varying shades of a color (lightest shade representing transients,
intermediate shade representing ARS-transformants and darkest shade representing integrants). The
transformation efficiency is an average of three independent experiments. (D) Mitotic stability (%) of
integrants and ARS-transformants and plasmid loss rate/ generation for ARS-transformants obtained with
different circular plasmids with and without ORI410. The data represents the average of three independent
colonies of each type. Int: integrants; ARS: ARS-transformants.
