Cannabis vapor self-administration
ABSTRACT
Recent trends in cannabis legalization have increased the necessity to better understand the effects of
cannabis use. Animal models involving traditional cannabinoid self-administration approaches have been
notoriously difficult to establish and differences in the drug employed and its route of administration have
limited the translational value of preclinical studies. To address this challenge in the field, we have
developed a novel method of cannabis self-administration using response-contingent delivery of
vaporized ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol-rich (CANTHC) or cannabidiol-rich (CANCBD) complete cannabis
extracts. Male Sprague Dawley rats were trained to nosepoke for discrete puffs of CANTHC, CANCBD, or
vehicle (VEH) in daily one-hour sessions. Cannabis vapor reinforcement resulted in strong discrimination
between active and inactive operanda. CANTHC maintained higher response rates under fixed ratio
schedules and higher break points under progressive ratio schedules compared to CANCBD or VEH, and
the number of vapor deliveries positively correlated with plasma THC concentrations. Moreover,
metabolic phenotyping studies revealed alterations in locomotor activity, energy expenditure, and daily
food intake that are consistent with effects in human cannabis users. Furthermore, both cannabis
regimens produced ecologically relevant brain concentrations of THC and CBD and CANTHC
administration decreased hippocampal CB1 receptor binding. Removal of CANTHC reinforcement (but not
CANCBD) resulted in a robust extinction burst and an increase in cue-induced cannabis-seeking behavior
relative to VEH. These data indicate that volitional exposure to THC-rich cannabis vapor has bona fide
reinforcing properties and collectively support the utility of the vapor self-administration model for the
preclinical assessment of volitional cannabis intake and cannabis-seeking behaviors.

Cannabis vapor self-administration
INTRODUCTION
With several states recently passing legislation allowing for the use of cannabis for recreational purposes,
there is a pressing need to better understand the neurobiological effects of cannabis use/misuse. Animal
models are valuable in this regard because they afford precise control over extraneous variables that
complicate the interpretation of cross-sectional human data. However, current approaches have limited
translational value [1]. Synthetic cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) agonists or isolated cannabis
constituents (e.g., ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol [THC], cannabidiol [CBD]) have become the drug of choice in
rodent models of cannabis exposure; even though the pharmacological properties of these compounds
differ greatly from those of inhaled cannabis. THC and synthetic CB1R agonists have different
pharmacological profiles (partial vs. full agonists) and recruit different intracellular signaling pathways [2].
Thus, synthetic CB1R agonists may fail to recapitulate the effects of THC, let alone the effects of
cannabis.
Animal models that involve access to THC alone have drawbacks as well. Over 120 unique
phytocannabinoid compounds are present in Cannabis sativa in addition to THC. These
phytocannabinoids have distinct pharmacological and behavioral profiles [3], and interactions between
phytocannabinoids give rise to the psychotropic or physiological effects of cannabis chemovars [4-6]. For
example, CBD acts as a CB1R negative allosteric modulator and inhibits THC-dependent intracellular
signaling and beta-arrestin-2-mediated CB1R internalization [7,8]. CBD attenuates THC-induced
paranoia and memory impairments in humans [9] but can also increase THC serum concentrations when
co-administered with THC [10]. Therefore, THC administration alone may not produce effects that are
representative of the effects of cannabis exposure in humans. In line with this, pure THC selfadministration has been difficult to demonstrate at the preclinical level [11]. Rats acquire stable rates of
intravenous THC:CBD (10:1) self-administration only after extended passive pre-exposure to vaporized
THC:CBD [12]. Thus, studying the effects of THC in the presence of other phytocannabinoids is important
for modeling cannabis use.

Cannabis vapor self-administration
Current animal models typically use the intravenous route for drug delivery; even though, the most
common route of recreational cannabis use is inhalation [13], and the pharmacokinetics of cannabinoids
vary considerably depending on administration route [14-16]. For example, intravenous THC
administration produces adverse effects in humans, likely related to high dosing and faster infusion rates
[17]. Similarly, vaporized THC administration produces conditioned place preference, whereas
intraperitoneal THC administration produces conditioned place avoidance in rodents [18]. Thus, the route
of cannabis administration may fundamentally influence the degree to which cannabis can support selfadministration.
A more translationally relevant approach is needed that uses cannabis and mimics the most common
route of administration in human users. With this in mind, we have developed a novel, ecologically valid
model of cannabis vapor self-administration that uses ‘e-cigarette’ technology to deliver discrete puffs of
vaporized cannabis extracts to rodents in a response-contingent manner. We used this procedure to
examine whether vaporized cannabis extracts that are high in THC or CBD have reinforcing properties
that support stable drug-taking behavior. We characterized the metabolic phenotype of cannabis-trained
rats and since human cannabis users and rodents chronically treated with THC exhibit reduced CB1R
availability [19] and decreased CB1R expression [20-23], respectively, we also measured hippocampal
CB1 receptor binding in rats from each treatment group. Furthermore, given that acute abstinence can
unmask withdrawal-related affective symptoms for other drugs of abuse [24], we examined whether acute
forced abstinence from cannabis vapor increases anxiety-like behavior. Finally, we tested whether
vaporized cannabis regimens maintain drug-seeking behavior in the drug-predictive context (i.e., under
extinction conditions) or upon response-contingent presentation of a cannabis-paired light stimulus (i.e.,
cue-induced reinstatement).

Cannabis vapor self-administration
METHODS AND MATERIALS
A full description of all experimental procedures is provided in the Supplemental Materials.
Animals
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Simonsen Laboratories, Gilroy, CA; 350-400 g) were pair-housed in a
humidity-controlled vivarium on a 12:12 reverse light-dark schedule (lights off at 7h00). Food and water
were available ad libitum. All procedures followed the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Washington State University Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee.
Drugs
Cannabis extracts rich in THC (CANTHC; 28.4% THC/1.1% CBD) or CBD (CANCBD; 1.96% THC/59.3%
CBD) were heated to 60°C under constant stirring and dissolved in 80% propylene glycol/20% vegetable
glycerol vehicle (VEH) at a concentration of 400 mg/ml based on previous studies [25,26]. Based on the
certificate of analysis provided by NIDA, the final concentrations of THC and CBD in CANTHC were ~116.8
mg/ml and ~4.4 mg/ml, respectively. The final concentrations of THC and CBD in CANCBD were ~7.84
mg/ml and 237.2 mg/ml. The CB1R antagonist, AM251 (Cayman Chemical; Ann Arbor, MI), was
dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide:Tween-80:saline (1:1:18) vehicle and administered at a dose of 0, 1, or 3
mg/kg (1 ml/kg, i.p.).
Self-Administration Training
Rats were trained to nosepoke for CANTHC, CANCBD, or VEH vapor puffs under a fixed ratio-1 (FR-1)
reinforcement schedule during daily one-hour sessions on 11 consecutive days (see Supplement for a
description of the vapor delivery system). Rats then progressed to an FR-2 schedule (days 12-16) and
then to an FR-4 schedule (day 17-21). Nosepoke responses made on one (active) operandum resulted
in a 3-s activation of the vaporizer and illumination of a cue light. The cue light remained illuminated
during a 60-s time-out period, during which responses were not reinforced. Nosepoke responses made
on the other (inactive) operandum had no programmed consequences. On the final self-administration
day (day 22), responding was reinforced under a progressive ratio (PR) schedule for 180-min. Schedule

Cannabis vapor self-administration
demand increased after each vapor delivery according to the following schedule: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5,
5, 7, 7, 9, 9, 11, 11, 13, 13, 15, 15, 18, 18, 21, 21, 24, 24, etc. [27]. The breakpoint was defined as the
total number of vapor deliveries obtained until responding ceased for a minimum of 15 minutes.
Cannabinoid Quantification
Immediately following a single one-hour CANTHC or CANCBD (200 or 400 mg/ml) self-administration
session, blood samples (~100 μl) were collected in a different cohort of rats (N=24) to evaluate the
relationship between the total number of vapor deliveries and circulating THC and CBD concentrations.
Blood was collected vial the tail vein in sterile tubes containing 10 ml ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid,
centrifuged at 4°C at 4,000 g for 15 min, and stored at -20°C. Another subset of rats (N=21) was sacrificed
24 hr after the final self-administration session. Brains were extracted to analyze THC and CBD tissue
levels. THC and CBD concentrations in plasma and brain were quantified as described previously [10,28]
(see Supplement).
CB1R Radioligand Binding Assay
Frozen whole brain tissue was collected from some rats (N=12) 24 hr after the final self-administration
session. Tissue was homogenized in TME buffer and centrifuged to generate the crude membrane
fraction. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Membranes (10μg protein/sample) were incubated in TME buffer with [3H]CP55,940 (0.25, 0.5, 1.25, or 2.5 nM) in the
absence or presence of AM251 (10 µM) to assess total and nonspecific binding, respectively. Bmax
(maximal binding site density) and Kd (binding affinity) were calculated by nonlinear curve fitting to the
single site Michaelis–Menten equation using GraphPad Prism as described previously [29,30].
Radiotelemetry Recordings
A subset of rats (N=8) was anesthetized with isoflurane/oxygen mixture (isoflurane 5% induction, 1-3%
maintenance). Sterile radiotelemetry transmitters (Starr Life Sciences Corp., Oakmont, PA; PTD 4000)
were implanted (see Supplement). Radiotelemetry transmissions indexing locomotor activity and body
temperature were collected daily during the one-hour self-administration sessions by Respironics ER4000 receiver plates placed under the chambers.

Cannabis vapor self-administration
Metabolic Phenotyping
A subset of rats (N=18) were housed individually in metabolic cages, when not in the self-administration
chambers. Feeding behavior, water intake, energy expenditure, physical activity, and respiratory quotient
(RQ) were continuously monitored (see Supplement).

CB1R Antagonism
Rats (N=16) were trained to self-administer vaporized CANTHC or CANCBD (400 mg/ml) under an FR-1
schedule over 26 daily sessions. Rats received mock IP injections on the two days prior to testing the
effects of systemic CB1R antagonism on training days 16, 21, and 26. One hour before testing, rats
received AM251 (1 or 3 mg/kg, IP) or VEH using a counterbalanced within-subjects design. Additional
training sessions were conducted between test sessions to re-establish stable responding. All data were
converted to a percent change score relative to the previous mock injection day.
Elevated Plus Maze Test
Anxiety-like behavior was assessed in another cohort of rats (N=37) 24 hours after the final selfadministration session using the elevated plus maze (EPM) test as described previously [30,31] (see
Supplement).
Extinction Training and Cue-Induced Reinstatement
Rats (N=35) were trained to self-administer CANTHC, CANCBD, or VEH under an FR-1 schedule over 19
daily sessions. Rats then underwent daily one-hour extinction training sessions during which nosepoke
responses had no programmed consequences. Extinction training continued until rats reached the
extinction criterion (i.e., ≥ seven extinction training sessions with ≥50% decrease in active nosepoke
responses during the final two sessions). Rats were then tested for cue-induced reinstatement of
extinguished drug-seeking behavior. During the one-hour test session, active nosepoke responses
resulted in cue light presentations without vapor delivery.

expenditure, respiratory quotient, and EPM data were compared across groups using planned t-tests or
one-way or mixed factor analyses of variance (ANOVA) with treatment group (CANTHC, CANCBD, VEH) as
the between-subjects factor and time (session, 15-min bin, phase) as the within-subjects factor.
Nosepoke discrimination was calculated based on a formula used in [12]: nosepoke discrimination index
= (active nosepokes – inactive nosepokes)/(active nosepokes + inactive nosepokes), where 0 indicated
no discrimination between active and inactive operanda, 1 indicated complete preference for the active
operandum, and -1 indicated complete preference for inactive operandum [12]. Effects of AM251 were
analyzed using separate repeated-measures one-way ANOVAs. Significant effects were further probed
using Tukey’s or Dunnett’s post-hoc tests. Vapor delivery and plasma cannabinoid concentrations were
correlated using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r). Alpha was set at .05. Effect sizes are reported as
η2p .

Cannabis vapor self-administration
RESULTS
THC-Rich Cannabis Vapor Supports Stable Rates of Self-Administration
CANTHC elicited more active responses compared to VEH on days 13, 14, 16-21 and compared to CANCBD
on days 5, 6, 9-21 (interaction: F(40,540)=3.57, p=.001, η2p =.20, post-hoc p’s<.05, Fig. 1C), predominantly
under the more demanding FR-2 and FR-4 reinforcement schedules. CANCBD elicited fewer active
responses compared to VEH on days 1 and 2 (p’s=.01 and .03, respectively). CANCBD also elicited fewer
inactive responses than CANTHC and VEH (main effects: F(2-20, 27-540)=6.27–8.36, p’s ≤.001, η2p =.22–.23,
post-hoc p’s≤.03).
The majority of responding occurred during the first 15 min of the session under each reinforcement
schedule (Figs. 1D-F). However, CANTHC elicited more active responses than VEH and CANCBD under
the FR-2 (Fig. 1E) and FR-4 (Fig. 1F) schedules during each 15-min bin (interactions: F(6,81)=6.68–9.05,
p’s<.001, η2p =.33–.40, post-hoc p’s ≤.005). Conversely, CANCBD elicited fewer active responses than VEH
during the first 15-min bin under each reinforcement schedule (p’s ≤.037). CANCBD elicited less inactive
responding than CANTHC, which in turn elicited less inactive lever responding than VEH during the first 15min of sessions under each reinforcement schedule (interactions: F(6,81)=6.26–9.47, p’s<.001, η2p =.32–
.41, post-hoc p’s ≤.02) (Figs. 1D-F), but CANTHC elicited more inactive responses than VEH (p=.04) and
CANCBD (p=.01) during the second 15-min of sessions under the FR-4 schedule (Fig. 1F).
Stable rates of vapor delivery were achieved under each reinforcement schedule, as indicated by a lack
of day effect over the final three days under each schedule. CANTHC elicited more vapor deliveries than
VEH on days 9-21 and more than CANCBD on days 5-19 and 21 (F(40,540)=2.24, p=.001, η2p =.14, post-hoc
p’s<.05, Fig. 1G). CANTHC elicited more vapor deliveries than VEH under FR-2 and FR-4 schedules and
more than CANCBD under each reinforcement schedule (interactions: F(6,81)=7.91–12.3, p’s<.001, η2p =.37–
.48, post-hoc p’s≤.01, Figs. 1H-J). CANCBD elicited fewer vapor deliveries than VEH during for first 15min bin under the FR-1 schedule (p<.001) (Fig. 1H).
The average nosepoke discrimination index was significantly above 0.33 for CANTHC (t(20)=4.39, p<.001)
and CANCBD (t(20)=8.77, p<.001), but not for VEH. Thus, only the cannabis vapor self-administering groups

obtained active to inactive responding ratios that were greater than 2:1. Furthermore, CANCBD elicited
better discrimination for the active operandum than VEH (F(2,27)=6.57, p=.001, η2p =.21, post-hoc p=.003,
Fig. 1K).
THC-Rich Cannabis Vapor Exhibits Robust Motivational Properties
During the PR schedule of reinforcement, CANTHC produced higher cumulative responding compared to
VEH from 100-120 min and compared to both VEH and CANCBD from 130-180 min (F(36,486)=4.49, p=.001,
η2p =.24, post-hoc p’s≤.04, Fig. 1L). CANTHC also elicited higher break points than VEH (F(2,27)=7.17,
p=.001, η2p =.34, post-hoc p=.001) and a trend for higher break points than CANCBD (p=.058, Fig. 1M).
Moreover, CANTHC elicited shorter latencies to re-initiate responding following vapor deliveries than VEH
and CANCBD (F(2,27)=5.01, p=.01, η2p =.27, post-hoc p’s≤.04, Fig. 1N). Importantly, PR responding for
CANCBD was not different from VEH on any endpoint.
Cannabis Vapor Self-Administration Produces Biologically Relevant Increases in Plasma THC and
CBD Concentrations
The number of cannabis vapor deliveries (200 or 400 mg/ml) during the one-hour self-administration
session positively correlated with plasma (A) THC (CANTHC-200: r =.51, p=.03; CANTHC-400: r =.86, p<.001)
and (B) CBD (CANCBD-200: r =.58, p=.01; CANCBD-400: r =.51, p=.18) concentrations post session. Brain
THC concentrations did not differ 24 hours after the final CANTHC versus CANCBD self-administration
session (Fig. 2C), while brain tissue concentrations of CBD were higher following the CANCBD regimen
compared to the CANTHC regimen (t(20)=2.24, p=.04, η2p =.20, Fig. 2D).
CANTHC Vapor Self-Administration Alters Physical Activity and Daily Food Intake
Self-administration of CANTHC (but not CANCBD) reduced locomotor activity during the final seven selfadministration sessions relative to VEH (p=0.009, Fig. 2E). The number of vapor deliveries negatively
correlated with locomotor activity on days 13, 16, and 18 (r’s =.73-98; p’s<.05)]. CANTHC reduced
locomotion during the self-administration sessions relative to VEH (treatment: F(2,14)=10.2, p=.002; time:
F(2,28)=51.2, p<.001; interaction: F(4,28)=1.37, p=.27), relative to CANCBD during the first hour post-vapor

exposure, and relative to VEH during the first and second hour post-vapor exposure (p’s<.02, Fig. 2F).
CANTHC increased daily food consumption over the last 10 days of training relative to VEH and CANCBD
(F(2,14)=5.73, p=.02, η2p =.42, post-hoc p’s<.03, Fig. 2G), but neither CANTHC nor CANCBD altered body
weight gain. CANTHC also increased energy expenditure compared to VEH and CANCBD (phase:
F(1,14)=179.00, p<.001, η2p =.93; treatment: F(2,14)=5.17, p=.021, η2p =.42, post-hoc p’s<.05, Fig. 2H) and
produced higher VO2 and VCO2 values compared to CANCBD (phase: F(1,14)=98.8-140.00, p’s<.001,
η2p =.88-.91; treatment: F(1,14)=4.04-4.49, p’s=.03, η2p =.22-.24. p’s<.05, Fig. S1D-E). Food intake, water
intake, and distance travelled were higher during the active vs. inactive phase (F(1,14)=25.00-166,
p’s<.001, η2p =.64-.92) independent of treatment, and there were no effects of phase or treatment on
respiratory quotients (RQ) (Fig. S1).
The Reinforcing Effects of Vaporized CANTHC Require CB1 Receptor Stimulation
Systemic CB1R antagonism differentially impaired the reinforcing effects of vaporized CANTHC and
CANCBD. Baseline active responses and vapor deliveries were not significantly different between
conditions, and VEH treatment did not alter these measures relative to mock injection. The 3 mg/kg dose
(but not 1 mg/kg dose) of AM251 decreased CANTHC-reinforced active responses (p=.01) and vapor
deliveries (p=.01) relative to baseline (F(2,7)=6.05-7.44, p’s≤.04, η2p =.63-.68, Figs. 2I-J). In contrast,
AM251 did not significantly alter CANCBD-reinforced active responses or vapor deliveries earned (Figs.
2K-L). AM251 treatment did not alter inactive responding relative to baseline (Fig. S2).
CANTHC Self-Administration Alters Hippocampal CB1 Receptor Binding
CB1R radioligand binding assays on hippocampal tissue from cannabis-exposed rats revealed that the
CANTHC regimen significantly reduced CB1R maximal binding site density (B max; t(6)=2.90, p=.03, ᶯ2=.58,
Fig. 3A) without altering CB1R binding affinity (KD; t(6)=.53, p=.61, ᶯ2=.05, Fig. 3B) compared to VEH,
whereas CANCBD failed to alter these endpoints when measured 24 hr after the final vapor selfadministration session.

Cannabis vapor self-administration
Removal of Cannabis Vapor Reinforcement Elicits an Extinction Burst
Rates of vapor self-administration did not differ between groups on the final self-administration day (Fig.
S3). Removal of CANTHC or CANCBD increased active responses on the first extinction day relative to the
last self-administration day (F(2,32)=3.47, p=0.04, η2p =.17; p’s<.005), whereas removal of VEH did not alter
active responses (Fig. 4A). Removal of CANTHC elicited more active responses than VEH on extinction
days 1-3 (interaction: F(12,192)=1.95, p=.03, η2p =.10; post-hoc p’s≤.03). Removal of cannabis increased
inactive responding in all groups (F(1,32)=12.23, p=.001, η2p =.19). Removal of CANCBD elicited fewer
inactive responses than removal of VEH on day 6 and fewer than removal of CANTHC on day 4
(F(12,192)=3.12, p<.001, η2p =.16, post-hoc p’s≤.04, Fig. 4A). Interestingly, removal of CANCBD increased the
number of sessions rats needed to reach the extinction criterion compared to CANTHC (F(2,32)=4.09, p=.03,
η2p =.20, post-hoc p=.03, Fig. 4B).
CANTHC- or CANCBD-Paired Stimuli Elicit Reinstatement of Cannabis Vapor-Seeking Behavior
Response-contingent presentation of either the CANTHC- or the CANCBD-paired (but not the VEH-paired)
light cue increased active responses at test relative to the last extinction training day (interaction:
F(2,32)=3.48, p=.04, η2p =.18; post-hoc p’s<.002, Fig. 4C). The CANTHC-paired cue elicited more active
responses than the VEH-paired cue (p=.05) (Fig. 4C). Response-contingent cue presentation also
altered inactive responding over the final extinction and reinstatement test days (F(2,32)=3.38, p=.047,
η2p =.17), with CANCBD rats making fewer inactive responses than VEH rats irrespective of cue
presentation (p=.04).

Cannabis vapor self-administration
DISCUSSION
Obstacles in establishing a model of cannabis use that closely mimics the human experience have limited
our ability to study the neural mechanisms and impact of cannabis use [1,32]. In the current study, we
present evidence supporting the feasibility of a novel preclinical model of cannabis self-administration
that employs response-contingent delivery of vaporized cannabis extracts.
Our findings indicate that THC-dominant cannabis vapor (CANTHC) has reinforcing properties (Fig. 1).
Despite variability in the rates of self-administration, both cannabis self-administering groups exhibited
stable rates of responding under each schedule of reinforcement (Fig. 1C) and demonstrated robust
discrimination between active and inactive operanda (Fig. 1K). The pattern of responding was consistent
with a preserved loading dose phenomenon, with the majority of responding occurring during the first 15
min of the session (Fig. 1D-F). Importantly, active nosepoke responding was highest in the CANTHC selfadministering group, and only the CANTHC self-administering group exhibited an increase in responding
and maintained the number of vapor deliveries earned under FR-2 and FR-4 reinforcement schedules
relative to the FR-1 schedule (Fig. 1G). Similarly, only the CANTHC self-administering group exhibited
higher break points and shorter latency to re-initiate responding post-vapor delivery under the PR
reinforcement schedule relative to VEH rats (Fig. 1M-N).

Cannabis vapor also supported the acquisition of conditioned motivational effects by an initially neutral
environmental stimulus (Fig. 4). Upon the removal of cannabis vapor reinforcement, both cannabistrained groups increased responding relative to their final day of self-administration (i.e., extinction burst;
Fig. 4A), but only the CANTHC-trained group made more responses than the VEH-trained control group.
Similarly, only the CANTHC-trained group exhibited greater cue-induced reinstatement of cannabisseeking behavior relative to the VEH-trained control group (Fig. 4C). These data indicate that vaporized
cannabis extracts elicit goal-directed responding and cue-induced drug-seeking behavior, and the THC
concentrations present in the extracts determine their reinforcing properties.

Cannabis vapor self-administration
The validity of this model is further strengthened by our findings that response-contingent delivery of
vaporized cannabis extracts produced behavioral and physiological changes that are consistent with
those in human cannabis users (Fig. 2). The number of CANTHC and CANCBD vapor deliveries obtained
positively correlated with THC and CBD plasma concentrations immediately after the session (Fig. 2AB). Self-administered CANTHC reliably reduced locomotor activity during the session (Fig. 2E) and
increased the duration of inactivity in the metabolic chambers during the first 2 hours following the selfadministration session (Fig. 2F). Self-administered CANTHC also increased daily food intake and energy
expenditure (Fig. 2G-H). These data mirror observations of increased caloric intake and energy
expenditure of chronic cannabis users [33-36]. Moreover, CB1R binding was significantly reduced in the
hippocampus 24 hours after the final self-administration in CANTHC rats compared to VEH rats (Fig. 3A),
which is in line with studies in human cannabis users [19] and rodents repeatedly injected with THC [2023]. Notably, biologically relevant THC and CBD concentrations were observed in brain tissue 24 hours
after the final self-administration session (Fig. 2C), which may account for the lack of abstinence-induced
anxiety-like behavior observed in this study (Fig. S6). Brain CBD concentrations were higher than brain
THC concentrations (Fig. 2D), probably due to the long half-life of CBD (i.e., 24-48 hr) [37]. THC tissue
concentration was low but detectable, and similar in both CANTHC and CANCBD rats. CBD inhibits the
cytochrome P450 family of liver enzymes that are primarily responsible for THC metabolism [38]. Thus,
comparable brain THC concentrations following the CANTHC and CANCBD regimens might reflect greater
CBD-mediated inhibition of THC metabolism in the CANCBD group. This possibility will need to be
systematically evaluated in future studies.
The vapor self-administration procedure likely facilitated volitional cannabis exposure. It has been well
documented for other drugs of abuse that control over drug administration profoundly alters the subjective
effects of drug intake, as well as the associated neurochemical responses [39-41]. Following passive
intravenous THC administration, humans report aversive effects that are most often associated with the
dose and infusion rate employed [17]. Thus, it is perhaps unsurprising that intravenous THC delivery
generally fails to support self-administration in rodents (see [32] for review). The cannabis extracts used
in the current study contain THC, CBD, and other naturally-occurring phytocannabinoids, and these

Cannabis vapor self-administration
phytocannabinoids may mitigate the aversive effects of THC [42]. Notably, CBD facilitates intravenous
THC self-administration in rodents [12] (but see [43]) and offsets some of the pharmacological and
behavioral effects of THC in humans [44] and rodents [9]. Furthermore, a passive THC+CBD vapor preexposure regimen facilitates the acquisition of intravenous THC+CBD self-administration, possibly by
offsetting the novelty of THC intoxication or aversive stimulus properties prior to operant training [12].
Thus, the subjective and/or motivational effects of cannabis vapor delivery are different from effects of
intravenous THC administration, and future studies should use whole cannabis preparations when
possible and consider the route of administration when attempting to generalize effects to human
cannabis users.
THC and CBD concentrations vary widely across commercially available cannabis products. As such, it
will be important to study the extent to which modifying cannabinoid constituent concentrations alters the
propensity for self-administration. In the current study, we compared responding for two different
cannabis extracts: one extract containing 28.4% THC and 1.1% CBD (CANTHC) and another containing
1.96% THC and 59.3% CBD (CANCBD). We observed key differences between the effects of CANTHC and
CANCBD extracts. First, CANTHC, but not CANCBD, elicited significant reinforcing effects as indicated by
augmented operant responding upon increases in schedule demand (Fig. 1C). Second, CANTHC had
greater motivational effects as indicated by higher breakpoints and a reduced latency to initiate
responding following vapor delivery compared to CANCBD (Fig. 1M-N). Although both CANTHC and
CANCBD self-administration regimens were sufficient to increase drug seeking upon the removal of the
reinforcer (i.e., extinction) or in the presence of vapor-associated cues (i.e., reinstatement) relative to
responding during the last self-administration session and relative to the absence of cues, respectively,
only the CANTHC regimen elicited response rates above that of the VEH group (Fig. 4A and 4C). Thus,
CANTHC vapor has greater reinforcing properties and stronger conditioned motivational effects than
CANCBD and VEH vapor. Interestingly, the CANCBD regimen produced the strongest discrimination
between active and inactive operanda despite reduced rates of responding. Furthermore, CANCBD elicited
drug-seeking behavior that was more resistant to extinction, as indicated by a larger number of sessions
required to reach extinction criterion relative to CANTHC (Fig. 4B). Detectable brain concentrations of THC

Cannabis vapor self-administration
(Fig. 2C) and a CBD-mediated decrease in the aversive properties of THC likely reconcile these findings
with studies indicating a lack of CBD-mediated reinforcement [45,46].
Altogether, findings from the present study strongly support the utility of a response-contingent vapor
delivery protocol as a means to model stable and pharmacologically relevant levels of cannabis
intoxication in human populations and further examine the neurobiological mechanisms of cannabis
intake and cannabis-seeking behaviors. Ultimately, this model will permit finer interrogation of the effects
of cannabis on the brain and behavior and help to identify causal factors that increase the susceptibility
for developing cannabis use disorders.
