Abstract
Heterochromatic gene silencing is an important form of gene regulation that
usually requires specific histone modifications. A popular model posits that
inheritance of modified histones, especially in the form of H3-H4 tetramers, underlies
inheritance of heterochromatin. Because H3-H4 tetramers are randomly distributed
between daughter chromatids during DNA replication, rare occurrences of
asymmetric tetramer inheritance within a heterochromatic domain would have the
potential to destabilize heterochromatin. This model makes a prediction that shorter
heterochromatic domains would experience unbalanced tetramer inheritance more
frequently, and thereby be less stable. In contrast to this prediction, we found that
shortening a heterochromatic domain in Saccharomyces had no impact on the
strength of silencing nor its heritability. Additionally, we found that replisome

mutations that disrupt inheritance of H3-H4 tetramers had only minor effects on
heterochromatin stability. These findings suggest that histones carry little or no
memory of the heterochromatin state through DNA replication.

Introduction
A central question in biology is how cells with identical genotypes can exhibit
different, heritable phenotypes. By definition, these phenotypes are determined by
information that is epigenetic, or “above the genome.” Just as genetic inheritance
requires faithful replication of DNA, epigenetic inheritance requires replication of
information that is transmitted to both daughter cells during division. Faithful
transmission of epigenetic information is crucial for multiple heterochromatin-based
processes such as X-chromosome inactivation in mammals and cold-induced gene
silencing in Arabidopsis. In these cases and others, the epigenetic inheritance of
heterochromatin indicates that some components of heterochromatin must behave as
heritable units. Surprisingly, the identity of this epigenetic information remains unclear
and heavily debated.
The histone subunits of nucleosomes, especially histones H3 and H4, are
modified by a variety of covalent modifications that are integral to heterochromatin
function. During DNA replication, nucleosomes are partially disrupted and marked
parental H3-H4 tetramers are locally inherited to daughter chromatids. As these

tetramers are inherited, they are reassembled into nucleosomes that are interspersed
with nucleosomes containing newly synthesized H3-H4 tetramers (Prior et al. 1980;
Jackson 1988; Schlissel & Rine in press). One model for epigenetic inheritance posits
that marked parental histones inherited through DNA replication recruit histone
modifiers to deposit similar marks on new adjacent nucleosomes, thereby
reestablishing the previous local landscape of histone modifications (Hecht et al. 1995;
Hoppe et al. 2002; Gaydos et al. 2014). In support of this model, the H3K27
methyltransferase PRC2 binds preferentially to H3K27me3 in vitro (Hansen et al. 2008)
and some other modifying enzymes show a similar ability to bind their histone
modifications (Zhang et al. 2008; Hecht et al. 1995; Imai et al. 2000). If this model is
correct, modified H3-H4 tetramers would constitute heritable units that drive
epigenetic memory of chromatin states.
Studies have come to different conclusions regarding whether histones can
carry epigenetic memory. In S. pombe, localized methylation of H3K9 can silence a
reporter gene, and this silenced state is heritable in the presence of the H3K9
methyltransferase Clr4p as long as the demethylase Epe1p is absent (Audergon et al.
2015; Ragunathan et al. 2015). These studies suggest that histone modifications can
facilitate epigenetic inheritance, and caution that such a mechanism is normally
obscured by H3K9 demethylation activity. Conversely, induced removal of silencer
elements from silenced chromatin in S. cerevisiae causes almost all cells to lose

silencing of adjacent genes after just one round of DNA replication (Holmes & Broach
1996). Similar results are found when silencers are removed from Drosophila chromatin
silenced by the Polycomb complex (Laprell et al. 2017). These silencer-removal
experiments suggest that modified histones are not sufficient to propagate the
silenced chromatin state through DNA replication.
The model in which histones carry epigenetic memory makes a testable
prediction: since parental H3-H4 tetramers have long been thought to be randomly
partitioned between daughter chromatids (Sogo et al. 1986; Cusick et al. 1984), rare
events could occur in which most or all marked parental H3-H4 tetramers within a
domain segregate asymmetrically to one daughter chromatid, causing the other to
inherit primarily newly synthesized histones. A chromatin domain with an insufficient
number of marked parental tetramers would be expected to experience a loss-ofchromatin-state event. In this view, a smaller chromatin domain would correspond to
fewer marked nucleosomes and yield more frequent events in which parental H3-H4
tetramers segregate asymmetrically and the chromatin state is lost. This potential use
of domain size for protection against epimutation is widely conjectured (Dodd et al.
2007; Kaufman & Rando 2010; Moazed 2011; Ramachandran & Henikoff 2015), and
may explain why chromatin domains subject to stable epigenetic inheritance are often
many kilobases long. For example, chromatin domains silenced by Polycomb
Responsive Elements (PREs) in Drosophila usually extend beyond 10kb (Schwartz et al.

2006). In contrast, one study in A. thaliana found that a chromatin domain containing
only three H3K27me3-marked nucleosomes is inherited more frequently than would
be predicted if random segregation of tetramers caused loss events (Yang et al. 2017).
However, no study to our knowledge has systematically tested this prediction.
To test directly whether inheritance of a chromatin state is affected by
chromatin-domain size, we focused on the heterochromatin domains at the HMR and
HML loci in S. cerevisiae. These loci contain copies of mating-type genes that are
silenced by the activity of Sir proteins. Specifically, the E and I silencers flanking HMR
and HML are occupied by the DNA-binding proteins Rap1, Abf1, and ORC, that
collectively recruit Sir proteins; Sir1 is present only at silencers, whereas Sir2/3/4
complexes bind to silencers and spread across the locus in a process that requires
deacetylation of H4K16 (Rusché et al. 2002; Thurtle & Rine 2014). Notably, DNA
methylation and RNA interference do not exist in S. cerevisiae.
Under normal conditions, HMR and HML are constitutively silenced. Rare and
transient loss-of-silencing events can be measured by a sensitive assay that uses the
cre recombinase under control of the HMLa2 promoter to convert transient
transcriptional events into permanent, heritable changes in fluorescence phenotypes
(Dodson & Rine 2015). In contrast, deletion of SIR1 causes genetically identical cells
to be in either of two states at HMR and HML: either fully silenced or fully expressed
(Pillus & Rine 1989; E. Y. Xu et al. 2006; Dodson & Rine 2015). These different

transcriptional states are mitotically heritable and cells switch between states at a low
frequency. This study addresses three questions regarding the inheritance of
heterochromatin in Saccharomyces: 1) Does the size of a silenced domain determine
the fidelity of inheritance? 2) Does removal of Sir1, a protein that facilitates
recruitment of silencing machinery to silencers, uncover an effect of chromatin
domain size on heritability of transcriptional states? 3) Do replisome components that
facilitate symmetric inheritance of parental H3-H4 tetramers also promote inheritance
of transcriptional states?

Results
Local inheritance of nucleosomes and their locus-specific modifications are
thought to facilitate inheritance of chromatin states. According to this view, if
parental H3-H4 tetramers were randomly partitioned between the two daughter
chromatids during replication, one would expect a chromatin state to be lost if, by
chance, one of the daughter chromatids failed to receive enough parental H3-H4
tetramers to support the propagation of that state. By this model, the number of
nucleosomes in the chromatin domain would influence the fidelity of chromatin-state
inheritance.

Nucleosome number did not determine the rate of silencing loss

To test if nucleosome number affected the stable inheritance of a chromatin
state, we used the Cre-Reported Altered States of Heterochromatin (CRASH) assay
(Dodson & Rine 2015) (Figure 1A). In this assay, cre replaces the a2 coding sequence
in HMRa, and a lox cassette containing fluorescent reporters separated by loxP sites is
located on a separate chromosome. Though HMRa is transcriptionally repressed, rare
loss-of-silencing events cause transient expression of cre. These events lead to
excision of RFP from the lox cassette, and a switch from RFP to GFP expression.
Because this change is heritable, loss-of-silencing events during colony growth lead
to formation of sectors of cells expressing GFP, appearing green on an otherwise red
background. The number of sectors in a colony reflects the frequency at which HMRa
transiently loses silencing: more sectors indicate less stable silencing.
HMRa::cre contained fifteen well-positioned nucleosomes between the E and I
silencers (Figure 1-figure supplement 1). To change nucleosome number within the
locus, we deleted DNA corresponding to different sets of nucleosomes (Figure 1B).
Notably, removing DNA corresponding to different combinations of nucleosomes
allowed us to discern whether any effects on silencing stability were due to
nucleosome number or to removal of specific DNA sequences. These deletions did
not affect the local positions of the remaining nucleosomes as measured by MNaseSeq (Figure 1-figure supplement 1).

At the limit of models by which nucleosomes transmit memory of
transcriptional states, inheritance of a single parental H3-H4 tetramer to a daughter
chromatid would be sufficient to template the silenced state. The expected loss-ofsilencing rate would thereby reflect the frequency at which a chromatid inherits no
marked parental H3-H4 tetramers due to random segregation of these tetramers
during replication. This rate would increase exponentially with shorter chromatin
domains as the probability of inheriting at least one parental tetramer decreases
(Figure 1C). Additionally, if inheritance of two or more parental H3-H4 tetramers were
necessary to template the silenced state, the expected loss-of-silencing rate would be
even higher. Full-length HMRa::cre (Strain N14) experiences a loss-of-silencing event
in approximately 0.1% of cell divisions (Dodson & Rine 2015). The silencing-loss rate
predicted by random segregation of H3-H4 tetramers would be approximately 1% of
cell divisions in the smallest version of HMRa::cre tested (Strain N7). Therefore, if this
model were correct, we would expect to see increased sectoring rates in strains with
shorter versions of HMRa::cre. Surprisingly, decreasing nucleosome number at
HMRa::cre led to a slight decrease in silencing loss as measured by sector frequency
(Figure 1D).
To provide an independent measurement of the silencing-loss rate, we also
measured fluorescence profiles of single cells. Cells that have recently lost silencing
of cre at HMRa contain both RFP and GFP due to GFP expression and the persistence

of RFP prior to its degradation and dilution. Using flow cytometry to measure the
frequency of cells that contain both RFP and GFP, we confirmed that nucleosome
number did not strongly affect silencing-loss rates, and that reduction of
nucleosomes might have a slight stabilizing effect on silencing (Figure 1E). Thus, the
size of HMRa::cre did not dramatically influence inheritance of the silenced state, in
contrast to the expectation from models in which H3-H4 tetramers carry memory of
chromatin states through cell divisions. Additionally, we found that changing
nucleosome number at HMLa::cre led to a small increase in silencing loss, and that
these effects were not due strictly to domain size (Figure 1-figure supplements 2-4).
Since studies at HMLa are potentially complicated by its proximity to a telomere,
which is also bound by Sir proteins, further studies were performed only at HMRa.

Nucleosome number did not affect transmission of epigenetic states in sir1∆.
The silencers flanking HMRa are bound by three different proteins that
collaborate to recruit Sir proteins (Rusché et al. 2003). One possibility for the apparent
insensitivity of silencing inheritance to nucleosome number was that the constant
recruitment of Sir proteins to these sites was efficient enough to mask a contribution of
histone inheritance to inheritance of chromatin states. In this scenario, silencers would
be capable of recruiting enough Sir proteins to keep the locus silenced during DNA
replication, regardless of histone segregation patterns. Sir1 binds to silencers, and
deletion of SIR1 partially disrupts silencer activity, as measured by defects in silencing
establishment and silencing heritability (Pillus & Rine 1989; Dodson & Rine 2015). We
therefore tested if parental H3-H4 tetramer inheritance contributed to transmission of
the silenced state when silencer-based recruitment of Sir proteins was impaired by the
sir1∆ mutation.
Within individual cells in a population of sir1∆ cells, HMR is either
transcriptionally silenced or fully expressed. These different states are mitotically
heritable: a cell in one state usually gives rise to more cells of that state. To observe
this epigenetic phenomenon, we placed the GFP coding sequence into HMRa, such
that it was expressed under control of the a2 promoter. Silencing was monitored by
GFP expression at the single-cell level using fluorescence microscopy and flow
cytometry. In comparison to control strains in which HMRa was fully silenced (SIR+) or

expressed (sir4∆), HMRa was silenced in roughly 99% of sir1∆ cells and was
expressed in the remaining cells (Figure 2-figure supplement 1, Figure 2-figure
supplement 2). We also observed different epigenetic states for HMLa::RFP. We used
live-cell imaging to monitor divisions of sir1∆ cells to identify cells in which silencing
of HMR was lost, and other cases in which it was gained (Figure 2A, Video 1). Thus
HMRa::GFP could be used to measure the efficiency of epigenetic inheritance in
sir1∆, similarly to previous studies (E. Y. Xu et al. 2006). For simplicity, we named this
the FLuorescent Analysis of Metastable Expression (FLAME) assay.
To test the prediction that chromatin domain size affects silencing heritability
with the FLAME assay, we removed DNA corresponding to sets of nucleosomes in the
HMRa::GFP locus (Figure 2B, Figure 2-figure supplement 3). As before, models in
which nucleosomes were carriers of epigenetic memory predicted that shorter
chromatin domains would have a higher rate of silencing loss (Figure 2C). Using timelapse fluorescence microscopy to monitor transcriptional states in individual cells and
their descendants as they divided, we found that nucleosome number did not affect
the frequency of silencing loss (Figure 2D). Because the expressed state is also
heritable, with occasional switches to the silenced state, we also asked if the
heritability of the expressed state was influenced by the number of nucleosomes in
the locus. The frequency of silencing establishment was similar between strains with
different numbers of nucleosomes at HMRa::GFP (Figure 2E). Therefore, even in a

influence silencing dynamics. These findings argued against models in which
parental H3-H4 tetramers and their modifications are required for the epigenetic
inheritance of gene expression states in Saccharomyces.

Replisome defects affected epigenetic inheritance
An orthogonal approach to test the role of histones in carrying epigenetic
memory would be to consistently bias parental H3-H4 tetramer inheritance to one
daughter chromatid, leaving the other daughter chromatid with fewer parental H3-H4
tetramers. Recent reports demonstrate conserved roles of two replisome
components, Dpb3 and Mcm2, in producing a more symmetric distribution of
parental H3-H4 tetramers between the leading and lagging strands. Specifically,
dpb3∆ causes biased parental H3-H4 tetramer inheritance to the lagging strand (Yu
et al. 2018) and a set of point mutations in MCM2 (mcm2-3A) causes biased parental
H3-H4 tetramer inheritance to the leading strand (Petryk et al. 2018; Gan et al. 2018).
A complementary study that was able to observe local inheritance of histone H4 in a
small chromatin domain, though was unable to distinguish leading versus lagging
strand biases, found that local histone H4 inheritance was moderately reduced in
both the dpb3∆ and mcm2-3A single mutants, and severely reduced in the dpb3∆
mcm2-3A double mutant (Schlissel & Rine, in press). Together, these studies
demonstrate that Dpb3 and Mcm2 are necessary for efficient inheritance of parental
H3-H4 tetramers to both daughter chromatids during DNA replication.
If parental H3-H4 tetramer inheritance contributes to transmission of chromatin
states, we would predict more loss-of-silencing events in strains with defects in
tetramer inheritance. To test this idea, we measured silencing loss in replisome

mutants using the CRASH assay (Figure 3A). The dpb3∆ and mcm2-3A single mutants
exhibited higher silencing-loss rates, consistent with previous studies done at HML
(Yu et al. 2018; Gan et al. 2018), and the dpb3∆ mcm2-3A double mutant lost
silencing more frequently than either single mutant. Similar results were obtained by
using flow cytometry to measure silencing-loss rates (Figure 3B). These data were
consistent with a model in which inheritance of parental H3-H4 tetramers could
contribute to inheritance of the silenced state at HMR. However, the data were also
compatible with the possibility that heterochromatin assembled in such mutants was
simply unstable for reasons independent of defects in its inheritance.

It is possible that parental H3-H4 tetramer inheritance affects both transient
loss-of-silencing events, as detected by the CRASH assay, and heritability of
epigenetic states. Testing this possibility was important because the currently
unidentified epigenetic information that determines expression states in sir1∆ is
transmitted locally at HML and HMR, respectively, rather than being transmitted in
trans from processes elsewhere in the cell (E. Y. Xu et al. 2006). If parental H3-H4
tetramers were the crucial local factors that transmitted this information, we would
predict that disrupted tetramer inheritance would cause more loss-of-silencing events
in sir1∆. To test this, we generated replisome mutant strains in combination with sir1∆
in the FLAME assay and evaluated the inheritance of transcriptional states using
Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) and live-cell microscopy.
Populations of dpb3∆, mcm2-3A, and dpb3∆ mcm2-3A mutants all showed a
mix of cells that were silenced or expressed at HMRa::GFP; all three mutant strains
also showed a higher frequency of expressed cells than wildtype (Figure 4-figure
supplement 1, Table 1). Because silencing-loss rates and silencing-establishment
rates both affect the frequency of cells in which HMR is silenced or expressed, one or
both of these rates were presumably different in replisome mutants. To measure
these rates, we used FACS to sort cells from each strain into two separate populations
of HMR-silenced and HMR-expressed cells (Figure 4A). By monitoring the rate at
which the initial sorted all-silenced population shifted back to a mixed population of

silenced and expressed cells (Figure 4B, Figure 4-figure supplement 2), we observed
that dpb3∆ and mcm2-3A had a higher loss-of-silencing rate than wildtype (Figure
4C). The dpb3∆ mcm2-3A double mutant had a higher loss rate than the single
mutants. Similar loss trends were observed using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy
(Figure 4D), albeit with overall higher loss rates than those seen with FACS sorting.
Together, these data suggested that faithful inheritance of parental H3-H4 tetramers
helped transmit the silenced state of HMR. However, we also noted that the vast
majority of silenced cells still faithfully transmitted the silenced state in the replisome
mutant backgrounds.
We also asked if replisome mutants had differences in the frequency of
silencing-establishment events. Curiously, any strain containing dpb3∆ had an
increased establishment rate, whereas mcm2-3A had minimal, if any, effects on
establishment rate (Figure 4E-G). Additionally, any strain containing dpb3∆ showed
elevated levels of HMRa::GFP expression in unsilenced cells, as measured by flow
cytometry (Figure 4-figure supplement 3). Because dpb3∆ cells more readily
established silencing, we inferred that the expressed state was less efficiently
inherited. Therefore, Dpb3 contributed to the inheritance of the expressed state of
HMR as well as to the silenced state.

Variations in nucleosome number in replisome mutant backgrounds
Though the rate of silencing loss increased in replisome mutant backgrounds,
the large majority of silenced cells still faithfully transmitted the silenced state through
cell divisions. Indeed, though dpb3∆ and mcm2-3A single mutants exhibit
asymmetric parental H3-H4 tetramer inheritance (Yu et al. 2018; Petryk et al. 2018), it
is likely that this asymmetry is not complete and some parental H3-H4 tetramers are
still stochastically transmitted to each daughter chromatid during DNA replication.
Similarly, the dpb3∆ mcm2-3A double mutant exhibits residual local inheritance of
histone H4 (Schlissel & Rine, in press). We reasoned that, if a daughter chromatid
consistently inherits fewer parental H3-H4 tetramers and thereby loses the silenced
state more frequently, an additional reduction in the size of a chromatin domain
would cause that daughter chromatid to inherit even fewer marked parental H3-H4
tetramers and experience loss-of-silencing events even more frequently. Therefore, if
parental H3-H4 tetramers carry epigenetic memory, we would expect loci with fewer
nucleosomes to exhibit more loss-of-silencing events in replisome mutant
backgrounds. To test his idea, we used the FLAME assay on nucleosome-number
mutants in dpb3∆ and dpb3∆ mcm2-3A strains (Figure 5A, figure 5-figure
supplement 1). There was no clear correlation between silencing-loss rates and
nucleosome number in these sensitized backgrounds (Figure 5B). Establishment-ofsilencing rates were also not strongly affected, though there was a slight increase in

the establishment rate with fewer nucleosomes in dpb3∆ mcm2-3A (Figure 5C).
Therefore, even when parental H3-H4 tetramer inheritance was disrupted and the
number of parental H3-H4 tetramers available for inheritance at HMR was decreased,
cells faithfully transmitted epigenetic transcriptional states.

Discussion
Heterochromatin is frequently characterized by specific histone modifications
bound by silencing proteins; these components are critical to mechanisms of silencing
and have long been considered as mediators of epigenetic inheritance. A popular
model is that modified H3-H4 tetramers are heritable units of epigenetic information
that are randomly segregated between daughter chromatids during DNA replication
(Ramachandran & Henikoff 2015). Models founded on random segregation of parental
H3-H4 tetramers predict that shorter chromatin domains would decrease the
heritability of chromatin states in those domains. Contrary to the prediction, we found
that shortening the silenced chromatin domain at HMR had no significant effects on
silencing-loss rate as measured by the CRASH and FLAME assays, even in mutants
lacking a component of the silencer-binding complex and in mutants with defective
versions of two different regulators of parental H3-H4 tetramer segregation.

Evidence that H3-H4 Tetramers Did Not Carry Epigenetic Memory
Removal of silencers from heterochromatin via induced recombination
demonstrates that silencers are necessary for maintenance of the silenced state.
Specifically, induced silencer excision from HMR causes rapid loss of silencing in
arrested cells (Cheng & Gartenberg 2000). Studies at other loci in S. cerevisiae and
Drosophila show that removal of silencers permits maintenance of silencing in arrested

cells, but causes loss of silencing once the same cells subsequently complete one or
two rounds of DNA replication (Holmes & Broach 1996; Laprell et al. 2017). Therefore,
the presence of modified histones is not sufficient for silencing maintenance or
heritability, depending on the example under consideration. Indeed, given that
silencers are constantly recruiting Sir proteins to these loci, any role of H3-H4 tetramers
in transmission of epigenetic information might be hard to detect.
We considered the possibility that silencer activity masks an underlying
contribution of H3-H4 tetramer inheritance to silencing inheritance. However, the
weakened silencer activity in sir1∆ mutants did not reveal a sensitivity of silencing
inheritance to the size of the silenced domain at HMR. Importantly, epigenetic states of
HML and HMR in sir1∆ are a property of the locus rather than the cell, demonstrating
that factors that determine these epigenetic states are inherited locally at HML and
HMR respectively (E. Y. Xu et al. 2006). Similar studies of an epigenetically-inherited
heterochromatin state in Arabidopsis also demonstrate that the relevant epigenetic
information is carried in cis (Berry et al. 2015). Additionally, epigenetic inheritance of
transcriptional states in heterochromatin is commonly accompanied by the ability to
switch stochastically between states, a feature that implies the existence of imperfectly
heritable epigenetic information. Though modified H3-H4

tetramers could

theoretically be cis-acting, imperfectly heritable units of information, our evidence to
the contrary suggests that other cis-acting factors determine the epigenetic state of

HMR in sir1∆. Given the importance of silencers in inheritance of the silenced
chromatin state, one possibility is that the silencer complex self-templates by
cooperative oligomerization of silencing factors, and that stochastic changes in
epigenetic states reflect the formation or dissolution of such a silencer complex.

Addressing the Possibility that Tetramer Inheritance is Not Random
Classic studies of chromatin replication indicate that parental H3-H4 tetramers
are randomly segregated between daughter chromatids during DNA replication. For
example, chromatin replicated in the presence of cycloheximide, which blocks the
synthesis of new histones, produces daughter chromatids with roughly half the number
of nucleosomes, and these nucleosomes appear randomly dispersed along both
daughter chromatids (Sogo et al. 1986; Cusick et al. 1984). Though our experiments
built on these classic findings, it is also possible that parental H3-H4 tetramers may not
be randomly segregated genome wide, or at HMR in particular. For example, it was
possible that heterochromatin contained factors that facilitated alternating inheritance
of tetramers between the leading and lagging strands. In this case, even if H3-H4
tetramers were to act as the sole units of epigenetic information, decreasing chromatin
domain size might not affect the rate of silencing loss at HMR.
If H3-H4 tetramers carry epigenetic information through DNA replication,
mutations that reduce tetramer inheritance would be expected to increase the

frequency of silencing loss. Studies describe roles of Dpb3 and Mcm2 in
heterochromatic silencing at HML (Yu et al. 2018; Gan et al. 2018), and inheritance of
epigenetic states at a synthetic telomere (Iida & Araki 2003; Foltman et al. 2013). Using
the CRASH and FLAME assays, we found mild but significant increases in HMR
silencing-loss rates in both dpb3∆ and mcm2-3A single mutants. Additionally, the
dpb3∆ mcm2-3A double mutant exhibited higher silencing-loss rates than either of the
single mutants. Together, these effects suggested that reduced tetramer inheritance
caused mild defects in silencing heritability. Though deacetylated H4K16 is crucial for
silencing, other modifications such as H3K56 acetylation also affect silencing (Hyland
et al. 2005; F. Xu et al. 2007) and reduced inheritance of these modifications may
hinder their functions. Considering the variety of histone modifications that parental
H3-H4 tetramers can carry through DNA replication, it was striking that cells with
moderate or severe reductions in inheritance of parental H3-H4 tetramers still exhibit
robust inheritance of the silenced state.
Though replisome mutants exhibit defects in parental H3-H4 tetramer
inheritance, some tetramers are still transmitted to both daughter chromatids in
replisome mutant backgrounds (Yu et al. 2018; Gan et al. 2018; Schlissel & Rine in
press). Therefore, there are still parental tetramers that are theoretically capable of
carrying epigenetic information to both daughter chromatids in the dpb3∆, mcm2-3A,
and dpb3∆ mcm2-3A mutants. Given that all replisome mutants tested showed

increased silencing-loss rates, further reduction in the number of parental H3-H4
tetramers available for transmission to daughter chromatids should cause even higher
rates of silencing loss. However, we saw no significant effects of HMR size on the
silencing-loss rate in replisome mutant backgrounds. Therefore, cells with both
reduced parental H3-H4 tetramer inheritance and a reduction in the number of
tetramers available for inheritance at HMR exhibited a surprisingly robust ability to
transmit the silenced state. These data strongly suggested that inheritance of parental
H3-H4 tetramers has little or no impact on epigenetic inheritance of the silenced state
of HMR.

Epigenetic Inheritance of the Expressed State
The expressed state of HMR in sir1∆ cells is formally an epigenetic state: it is
heritable through cell divisions and can stochastically switch to the silenced state.
One possibility is that the expressed state of HMR depends on the existence of
heritable information, similarly to the silenced state. Histone modifications associated
with active transcription can be transmitted through DNA replication (Alabert et al.
2015; Reverón-Gómez et al. 2018) and multiple transcription factors can bind to the
histone modifications they generate (Jacobson et al. 2000; Owen et al. 2000).
Therefore, histone modifications may form positive feedback loops with both
silencing machinery and transcription factors. Indeed, a model that incorporates

these positive feedback loops and parental H3-H4 tetramer inheritance generates
robust bistable chromatin states (Dodd et al. 2007). This model also predicts that
random segregation of parental H3-H4 tetramers would lead to loss-of-chromatinstate events, and that decreasing chromatin domain size would also decrease the
heritability of both the expressed and silenced states. However, we found that shorter
versions of HMR did not strongly affect inheritance of the expressed state of HMR.
Alternatively, if parental H3-H4 tetramers carry memory of the expressed state,
mutations that disrupt parental H3-H4 tetramer inheritance would be expected to
increase the rate of silencing establishment. Curiously, dpb3∆ exhibited a ~3-fold
increase in the rate of silencing establishment and mcm2-3A had no observable
effect. These data may suggest that parental tetramer inheritance facilitates
heritability of the expressed state, though such an explanation could not account for
the mcm2-3A phenotype. Alternatively, these data may suggest that inheritance of
the expressed state is influenced by a function of Dpb3p that is separate from its role
in tetramer inheritance. It is also important to note that dpb3∆ but not mcm2-3A led
to elevated levels of GFP expression when HMRa::GFP was fully expressed. This
finding is paradoxical, as one would expect elevated transcription to inhibit silencing
establishment, rather than facilitate it. However, recruitment of the transcriptional
activator Ppr1 to HMR causes both increased transcription in expressed cells and an
increased establishment rate in sir1∆ (E. Y. Xu et al. 2006).

Together, our results suggested that the fidelity of H3-H4 tetramer inheritance
has minimal consequences for heritability of the silenced state and may affect
heritability of the expressed state in some contexts. These findings raised doubts
regarding the model in which histones are significant carriers of epigenetic memory
in S. cerevisiae. As such, future studies that continue to examine histone-based
memory models will be complemented by studies on other possible mechanisms of
transcriptional memory.

Materials and Methods
Yeast strains
The strains and oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Supplementary
Files 1 and 2, respectively. All strains were derived from the W303 background.
CRASH assay strains, which contained HMRα, hmrα2∆::cre,
ura3∆::loxP::yEmRFP:tCYC1:KanMX:loxP:yEGFP:tADH1 or hmlα2∆::cre,
ura3∆::loxP::yEmRFP:tCYC1:HygMX:loxP:yEGFP:tADH1 were generated as described
previously (Dodson & Rine 2015). FLAME assay strains were generated with the
following approach. To generate hmlα2∆::yEmRFP, a K. lactis URA3 swap was
performed to replace the α2 coding sequence with yEmRFP coding sequence. The
hmlα2∆::yEmRFP fwd/rev primers were used for integration of yEmRFP in the final
step. To generate HMRα, hmrα2∆::yEGFP, a fragment spanning the X region to the
Z1 region of hmlα2∆::yEGFP was amplified using hmlα2∆::yEGFP fwd/rev primers
and swapped into HMRa.
To delete DNA corresponding to nucleosomes at HMRα and HMLα,
CRISPR/Cas9 was employed as previously described (Lee et al. 2015). Each deletion
or repair fwd/rev primer set contained two partially overlapping primers that were
amplified by PCR prior to use. The HMR-E-proximal sgRNA was used to induce Cas9
cutting between the HMR-E silencer and cre, and N14 to N12 deletion fwd/rev was
used to delete DNA corresponding to two nucleosomes in this region. This sgRNA

and oligo set was also used to convert sN12 to sN10 in the FLAME strain background.
The HMR-I-proximal sgRNA, which cuts between the HMR-I silencer and cre, was used
with N14 to N10 deletion fwd/rev (to convert N14 to N10, and sN12 to sN8) or with
N14 to N9 (to convert N14 to N9). For HMLα, the HML-E-proximal sgRNA was used to
induce Cas9 cutting between the HML-I silencer and cre, and used with N22 to N19a
deletion fwd/rev (to convert N22 to N19a) or N22 to N16a deletion fwd/rev (to
convert N22 to N16a). The HML-I-proximal sgRNA was used to induce Cas9 cutting
between the HML-E silencer and cre, and was used with N22 to N19b deletion
fwd/rev (to convert N22 to N19b) or N22 to N16c deletion fwd/rev (to convert N22 to
N16c) or N22 to N13c deletion fwd/rev (to convert N22 to N13c). Deletions were
confirmed by junction primers and sequencing. To generate mutants with
combinations of nucleosome set deletions, CRISPR/Cas9 technology was applied (as
described above) to strains with one nucleosome set deletion already made.
To generate dpb3∆, the DPB3 sgRNA was used with Cas9 to cut within DPB3
and DPB3 deletion fwd/rev was used to delete the coding sequence. To generate
mcm2-3A, the MCM2 sgRNA was used with Cas9 to cut 244bp into the MCM2 coding
sequence and mcm2-3A repair fwd/rev was used to generate the appropriate point
mutations (Y79A Y82A Y91A). Mutations were confirmed by sequencing.

To generate colonies for analysis by the CRASH assay, RFP-expressing cells
were diluted and plated at a density of ~10 cells/plate (CSM-Trp (Sunrise Science
Products, San Diego, CA), 1% agar). After 5 days of growth, colonies were imaged
using a Leica M205 FA fluorescence stereomicroscope (Leica Camera AG, Wetzlar,
Germany) equipped with a Leica DFC3000G CCD camera, a Leica PLANAPO 0.63x
objective, ET RFP filter (Leica 10450224), ET GFP filter (Leica 10447408), and Leica
Application Suite X (LAS X) imaging software. At least ten colonies were imaged per
genotype.

Live-cell imaging
Cells were grown to saturation in CSM (Sunrise Science Products) at 30°C
overnight. These cells were then back-diluted in 5 ml CSM and grown to mid-log
phase over 6 hours. 500µl was transferred to a microfuge tube and sonicated at 20%
for 15 seconds (Branson Ultrasonics Digital Sonifier 100-132-888R with Sonicator Tip
101-135-066R) (Branson Ultrasonics, Fremont, CA) to break up clumps of cells. 5 µl of
sonicated cells were spotted onto a CSM plate (1% agar) and allowed to soak into the
agar. When dry, a sterile spatula was used to cut a 1 cm × 1 cm agar square
surrounding the cell patch. The square was lifted out of the plate, inverted, and
placed in a 35 mm glass bottom dish (Thermo Scientific 150682) (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA). Cells were imaged using a Zeiss Z1 inverted fluorescence

microscope with a Prime 95B sCMOS camera (Teledyne Photometrics, Tucson, AZ),
Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.40 oil immersion objective (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany),
filters, MS-2000 XYZ automated stage (Applied Scientific Instrumentation, Inc.,
Eugene, OR), and Micro-Manager imaging software (Open Imaging, San Fransisco,
CA). Given that cells were pressed between the agar and glass, the cells were all in
the same focal plane and Z-stacks were not used.
For time-lapse microscopy (i.e. Figure 2D), samples were kept at 30°C and
humidified with a P-Set 2000 Heated Incubation Insert (PeCon, Erbach, Germany).
Time-lapse experiments involved brightfield and fluorescence imaging of 16 different
fields per sample, and images were taken every 10 minutes for 10 hours. Subsequent
analysis of cell divisions was done in ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD). To measure
epigenetic switching rates in the FLAME assay, cell divisions and switching events
were manually counted and the counter was blind to the genotype (single-blind
study). This counting was performed only on cells that could be clearly distinguished
from each other. If a mother and daughter cell pair switched simultaneously, we
counted this as one switching event that probably appeared as two events due to the
lag time in yEGFP expression or degradation.

To measure fluorescence intensities per cell in the CRASH and FLAME assays, a
BD LSR Fortessa cell analyzer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) with a FITC filter (for
GFP) and a PE-TexasRed filter (for RFP) was used. Subsequent analysis was performed
with FlowJo software.
For quantification of silencing-loss rates in the CRASH assay (Figure 1E and
3B), cells were first streaked out to form single colonies. Six colonies per genotype
were added to CSM-Trp media (Sunrise Science Products) in a 96-well plate (Corning
CLS3788) (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) and grown to saturation overnight in an
incubating microplate shaker (VWR 12620-930) (VWR International, Radnor, PA) at
30°C. These samples were then back-diluted and grown to mid-log phase over 6
hours. GFP and RFP expression were then analyzed by flow cytometry (n > 4000 cells
per sample). Distinct populations of RFP+ GFP- (which had not lost silencing), RFP+
GFP+ (which had recently lost silencing), and RFP- GFP+ (which had lost silencing less
recently) were observed. The apparent silencing-loss rate was calculated as the
number of RFP+ GFP+ cells divided by the number of RFP+ GFP+ cells and RFP+
GFP- cells. Measurements from independent cultures were considered as biological
replicates.
For calculating the frequency of silenced and expressed cells at equilibrium in
the FLAME assay, cells were first streaked out to generate single colonies. Three
colonies per genotype were added to CSM media in a 96-well plate and grown to

saturation overnight. These samples were then serially back-diluted in CSM media in
96-well plates and grown at 30°C. After twelve hours, the serial dilutions had a range
of cell densities; the dilution that was closest to ~1 O.D. was again back-diluted in
CSM media and grown at 30°C for another 12 hours. At this point, wells close to ~1
O.D. contained cells that had been growing at log-phase for approximately 24 hours.
These cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Because three populations were
analyzed per genotype, the most representative profiles of silenced and expressed
cells were used for figures. We considered these populations as biological replicates.
To calculate GFP expression levels in expressed cells in the FLAME assay, cells
were streaked out for single colonies and three colonies per genotype were grown
overnight in CSM + 5 mM Nicotinamide (NAM) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). These
samples were then back-diluted in CSM + 5 mM NAM and grown at 30°C for 12
hours. Samples at ~1 O.D. were analyzed by flow cytometry. For Figure 2
Supplemental Figure 3, the most representative profiles of the three profiles
generated per strain were shown. For Figure 4 Supplemental Figure 3, the geometric
mean intensity of GFP per cell (excluding cells that formed a smaller, artifactual peak
at a lower GFP intensity) was calculated for each population using FlowJo software.
Independent cultures were considered as biological replicates.
FACS was utilized in the FLAME assay to calculate switching rates between
epigenetic states in Figure 4. To perform this experiment, cells from each genotype

were serially diluted in CSM media and grown at 30°C. After 12 hours, dilutions
closest to ~1 O.D. were sorted into GFP- and GFP+ populations using a BD FACSAria
Fusion cell sorter (BD Biosciences) equipped with a FITC filter for GFP. Gates were
calibrated from SIR+ (JRY11474) and sir4∆ (JRY11496) cells. For each sample,
150,000 GFP- cells were sorted into one tube and 30,000 GFP+ cells were sorted into
another. Each sorted population was divided evenly into three populations and
grown in CSM in a 96-well plate at 30°C. Serial back-dilutions were used to maintain
constant log-phase growth over two days. Time-points were taken by removing a
fraction of cells from each population and fixing them in a 4% paraformaldehyde
solution (4% paraformaldehyde, 3.4% Sucrose) for 15 minutes at room temperature.
Fixed cells were resuspended in GFP fix buffer (100 mM KPO4 pH 7.4, 1.2 M Sorbitol)
and kept at 4°C. Once the experiment was complete, fixed cells from different timepoints were analyzed by flow cytometry (n > 500 cells per sample) and analyzed by
FlowJo software. The percent of GFP+ cells for each sample over time is shown in
Figure 4B and 4E. Because the initial sorting event required ~20 minutes per sample,
the time of initial sorting (t = 0 hrs) was different between samples; this made the time
points between samples slightly staggered as seen in Figure 4B and 4E. Because cells
were divided into subpopulations after the initial sorting, these subpopulations were
considered as technical replicates.

Switching rate calculation from cell sorting
The following equations were used to model the dynamics of switching rates
between epigenetic states in sir1∆. We considered the balance of GFP+ and GFPcells over time, and assumed that the birth and death rates of the two populations are
similar. Combining the balances and introducing the ratio variable 𝑥, we can derive
the following equation that describes how a population of GFP+ cells and GFP- cells
would move towards equilibrium over time:

1
𝑑𝑥%&
𝑘%&
)
+ 𝑥%& =
𝑘%& + 𝑘%(( 𝑑𝑡
𝑘%& + 𝑘%((

"

𝑘%& is the loss rate per hour, 𝑘%(( is the establishment rate per hour, 𝑥%& is the
fraction of GFP+ cells at a given time, and 𝑡 is time. Solving the differential equation
for 𝑥%& yields:

𝑥%& =

Therefore, the following equations were used to model switching rates between
epigenetic states from data in Figure 4B and 4E.

The nls() function in R was used to provide a nonlinear least squares estimate
of the unknown variables 𝑘%& and 𝑘%(( for each genotype, and 95% confidence
intervals for estimates. With this approach, each genotype had an estimated 𝑘%& and
𝑘%(( from sorting silenced cells and an estimated 𝑘%& and 𝑘%(( from sorting
expressed cells. Since sorting silenced cells subsequently allowed for observation of
more loss-of-silencing events, the 𝑘%& rates from those data were considered more
accurate and used in Figure 4C. Similarly, the 𝑘%(( rates calculated from sorting
expressed cells were used in Figure 4F.

Because each population of sorted cells was evenly divided into three
subpopulations, each genotype has three calculated values for the percent of GFP+
cells at each given time point after sorting. The nonlinear least squares estimate was
made by drawing a best fit line through all data points for a given genotype,
effectively combining the values of all subpopulations. The quality of the fit was
calculated using the confint2() function and represented as 95% confidence intervals
for 𝑘%& values in Figure 4C and 𝑘%(( values in Figure 4F. An alternative approach
involved drawing a best fit line for each individual subpopulation to give three 𝑘%&
values and three 𝑘%(( values for each genotype and averaging these values to get a
single 𝑘%& value and 𝑘%(( value for each genotype, with error bars representing a
standard deviation. Though we also performed this latter analysis method, we favor
the former analysis method because it incorporates how well the data fit the
nonlinear least squares estimate. Notably, both analysis methods gave similar 𝑘%&
and 𝑘%(( values.
The generation time of DPB3 MCM2 (JRY11471) was 1.96 hours in CSM media
at 30°C. To convert 𝑘%& and 𝑘%(( as rates per hour to rates per generation, we
multiplied these variables by the generation time. Similar generation times were
observed for all replisome mutants.

Cells were grown to saturation overnight in 5 mL CSM at 30°C. The following
day, these cells were back-diluted to ~0.1 O.D. in 50 ml CSM and grown at 30°C for 5
hours. Cells were then centrifuged and washed twice in 500 µl SKC buffer (1.2 M
Sorbitol, 100 mM KH2PO4, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 7 mM b-mercaptoethanol) and then
resuspended in 100 µl SKC buffer. Cells were incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes, then
30 µl of 1mg/mL Zymolyase-100T (MP Biomedicals, LLC, Solon, OH) was added for a
final concentration of 0.23 mg/ml Zymolyase-100T and incubated at 37°C for 15
minutes. All subsequent steps were performed on ice. Once spheroplasting was
complete, cells were spun at 3k RPM for 3 minutes at 4°C. Cells were washed twice in
500 µl SPC buffer (1 M Sorbitol, 20 mM PIPES pH 6.3, 0.1 mM CaCl2, with Roche
cOmplete protease inhibitors (Sigma)) and spun at 2k RPM for 3 minutes at 4°C
between washes. Cells were resuspended in 250 µl SPC buffer, and this solution was
gently mixed with 250 µl freshly prepared Ficoll buffer (9% Ficoll, 20 mM PIPES pH
6.3, 0.5 mM CaCl2) to lyse the cell membranes.
Nuclei were then pelleted by centrifugation at 10k RPM for 20 minutes at 4°C.
Nuclei were washed twice in 500 µl SPC and spun at 8k RPM for 3 minutes at 4°C
between washes. Washed nuclei were subsequently resuspended in 250 µl SPC and
CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 2mM CaCl2. Nuclei were incubated for 5
minutes at 37°C, then 20 units of Worthington MNase was added (Worthington
Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ). Nuclei were incubated for 15 minutes at

37°C. MNase activity was quenched by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 10
mM EDTA. Nuclei were centrifuged at 3.7k RPM for 5 minutes at 4°C. The
nucleosome-containing supernatant was subsequently removed and DNA and RNA
were purified using a Qiagen spin column. RNase A (Sigma) was added to a final
concentration of 1 mg/ml RNase A and incubated for 2 hours at 37°C. DNA was then
purified using a Qiagen spin column. MNase libraries were constructed with
NEBnextUltra II library preparation kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and
sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq4000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) as 100 bp paired-end
reads.
Reads were mapped to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C genome
(GenBank accession number GCA_000146045.2) using Bowtie2 (Langmead and
Salzberg, 2012). Mapped reads between 140 bp and 180 bp in length were used in
all further analysis to ensure mononucleosome resolution. The midpoint for each read
was calculated and midpoints were stacked in a histogram. Finally, a 25 bp rolling
mean was used to smooth out the resulting nucleosome peaks. All sequences and
processed data files have been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus
archive under accession number GSE136897.

Figure 4-figure supplement 3: dpb3∆ exhibits a higher expression level of HMRa::GFP in expressed
cells. DPB3 MCM2 (JRY11478), dpb3∆ MCM2 (JRY11550), DPB3 mcm2-3A (JRY11589), and dpb3∆
mcm2-3A (JRY11590) were grown at log phase for 12 hours in 5 mM Nicotinamide (NAM) and
HMRa::GFP expression was measured with flow cytometry. The geometric mean intensity of GFP for
each strain was calculated using FlowJo software. Data are means ± SD (n = 3 independent cultures).
ANOVA and Tukey tests showed GFP expression levels in DPB3 MCM2 were significantly different than
those seen in dpb3∆ MCM2, DPB3 mcm2-3A, and dpb3∆ mcm2-3A (p < 0.05 each). GFP expression in
dpb3∆ MCM2 was not significantly different than dpb3∆ mcm2-3A (p > 0.05).

Table 1: Comparison of epigenetic switching rates and proportion of silenced cells at equilibrium.
Data for DPB3 MCM2 (JRY11471), dpb3∆ MCM2 (JRY11550), DPB3 mcm2-3A (JRY11589), and dpb3∆
mcm2-3A (JRY11590) in the FLAME assay was extracted from Figure 4. The percentages of Silenced (S)
and Expressed (E) cells at equilibrium were determined from Figure 4B. Silencing-loss rates (kon,gen-1)
correspond to data from Figure 4C and silencing-establishment rates (koff,gen-1) correspond to data
from Figure 4F.

HMRa::GFP sir1∆ (JRY11478) cells were grown to log-phase in liquid media and
subsequently imaged by time-lapse microscopy. A loss-of-silencing event is visible
near the center of the field of view at 4 hrs, and an establishment-of-silencing event is
visible near the upper-left corner at 5 hrs.
