Abstract

17

The effect of three fungicide treatment programmes and the level of spring nitrogen

18

fertilisation on the seed yield of two types of cultivars of Brassica napus L. sown at two

19

different seeding rates was studied in a field experiment carried out in a split-split-plot design.

20

The subject of the study was an open-pollinated cultivar (Casoar) and a restored hybrid cultivar

21

(Visby). Three plant protection programmes, two levels of spring nitrogen fertilisation (160 and

22

220 kg Nha-1), and two different seeding rates for each cultivar (Visby—50 and 70 seedsm-2;

23

Casoar—60 and 80 seedsm-2) were included. The most intensive protection programme

comprised three fungicide treatments: first in autumn at the six-leaves-unfolded stage—BBCH

25

16, second in spring at the stem elongation stage—BBCH 33, and third at the full flowering

26

stage—BBCH 65. One of two less intensive programmes of plant protection included fungicide

27

application in autumn at the six-leaves-unfolded stage—BBCH 16 and at the full flowering

28

stage—BBCH 65, while the second included fungicide application in spring at the stem

29

elongation stage—BBCH 33 and at the full flowering stage—BBCH 65.

30

The effectiveness of the protection programmes and nitrogen fertilisation was

31

influenced by the intensity of abiotic stress factors. However, the average yield from the plots

32

protected against pathogens was significantly higher than that from the untreated plots. The

33

increase of nitrogen fertilisation from 160 to 220 kgha-1 also caused significant increase of

34

average seed yield. The yield of cultivar Visby was higher and less dependent on the seeding

35

rate compared to cultivar Casoar. Cultivars responded similarly to plant protection programmes

36

and the rate of nitrogen fertilisation in spring. Higher yields of Visby cultivar can be attributed

37

to the higher number of seeds per silique and the higher number of siliques per m2.

Introduction

40

Crop yields are shaped by advances in breeding progress, which result in varieties with

41

favourable properties, and intensification of cultivation treatments. In the northern hemisphere

42

characterised by a cold climate, the only commonly cultivated oilseed crop is oilseed rape

43

(Brassica napus L.). The possibility of using oilseed rape in the food [1] and feed [25] industry,

44

as well as in the generation of energy [26] , especially biofuels, has significantly contributed to

45

the increase in the cultivation area of this oilseed crop (0.6 million hayear-1 between 1997 and

46

2017) [7]. Increase of the cultivation area as well as the level of yield of oilseed rape recorded

47

since the early 1990s [9, 45] reflects the interest in rapeseed of the food and feed industry,

48

which was gained after the introduction of the double-improved variety with no erucic acid and

49

reduced glucosinolate, and the energy industry using rapeseed oil in biofuel production. The

50

possibility of growing rapeseed for energy purposes has contributed to the increase in the

51

cultivation area of this oilseed plant, and also to its higher yields obtained in Poland.

52

The sown area and yield of oilseed rape increased, respectively, from 0.4 million ha and

53

2.1 Mgha-1 on average during 2001–2003 before Poland’s accession to the European Union to

54

0.9 million ha and 3.0 Mgha-1 in the years 2014–2016 [32]. Such a significant increase in the

55

area stimulates the demand for high- and stable-yielding cultivars that react efficiently to

56

cultivation treatments and justifies the intensification of production strongly conditioned by

57

economic factors. The yields of oilseed rape are shaped on the one hand by the yield potential

58

of the variety [24], its tolerance/resistance to biotic and abiotic stress [41], and on the other

59

hand by cultivation technology, the aim of which is to provide the most favourable conditions

60

for the development of crops and to limit crop losses. The resistance of cultivars to biotic and

61

abiotic stresses is particularly important. Cultivars that exhibit good tolerance to stressful

62

conditions have a better chance of showing good yield potential because the seasons

63

characterised by unfavourable weather conditions for the development of oilseed rape are not

64

uncommon in Poland. For this reason, one of the objectives of the present research is to

65

understand the adaptive abilities of the types of rapeseed cultivars studied to changing

66

environmental conditions. The working hypothesis assumes the overriding role of cultivars’

67

resistance to abiotic stresses in shaping their yield level. The shortage of precipitation during

68

the stages characterised by the greatest demand for water and low temperatures during winter

69

dormant period, which can be seen frequently in Poland, affecting the development of plants

70

may contribute to a significant decrease in the yield level of rape cultivars. In addition, excess

71

of rainfall can limit the yields, especially in the case of cultivars susceptible to infection,

72

because it induces infections and the spreading of pathogens. An effective way to protect plants

73

from pathogens is fungicide treatment [12, 29, 47]. The dependence of humidity conditions of

74

the oilseed rape canopy on the plant density derived from the amount of seeds sown justifies

75

research into the effectiveness of protection against pathogens at different sowing rates.The

76

constant increase of importance of chemical protection against pathogens in the technology of

77

oilseed rape [42] and the decisive significance of the amount of seeds sown for the yield level

78

confirm the accuracy of the selection of these experimental factors. Moreover, the variability

79

of cultivars’ resistance to pathogens [14-15] justifies undertaking research aimed at determining

80

their response to the intensification of this factor of production, although it is rare to find results

81

presenting variation in the yields of cultivars resulting from the intensification of protection

82

[10]. Another factor included in this research mainly due to its stimulating impact on the

83

development and yield of rapeseed [2, 6, 30-31], as well as on infection by pathogens [37], is

84

spring nitrogen fertilisation. Understanding the impact of the intensification of nitrogen

85

fertilisation on the development and yielding of the types of rapeseed cultivars compared here

86

is another goal of the present work. The choice of experimental factors studied in this work was

87

also dictated by their significant role in determining cultivation costs. According to Budzyński

88

and Ojczyk [5], fertilisation and protection account for almost 80% of the cultivation costs of

89

oilseed rape.

Materials and methods

92

The experiment was conducted in 2012–2014 at the Experimental Station of Plant Breeding

93

Smolice Ltd, Co. in Łagiewniki (N 51° 46′, E 17° 14′). It was a three-factor type and was laid

94

out in a split-split-plot design with four replications. The main plot factor was the programme

95

of protection against pathogens (Table 1). Three programmes of fungicide application and a

96

control treatment were included in the experiment. The most intensive protection programme

97

comprised three fungicide applications: first in autumn at the six-leaves-unfolded stage—

BBCH 16, second in spring at the stem elongation stage—BBCH 33, and third at the full

99

flowering stage—BBCH 65. In addition, two less intensive programmes of plant protection

100

were included: the first one involved fungicide application in autumn at the six-leaves-unfolded

101

stage—BBCH 16 and at the full flowering stage—BBCH 65, while the second involved

102

fungicide application in spring at the stem elongation stage—BBCH 33 and at full flowering

103

stage—BBCH 65. In autumn, metconazole (5-[(4-chlorophenyl)methyl]-2,2-dimethyl-1-(1H-

104

1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl) cyclopentanol) was applied at 60 g·ha-1. At the stem elongation stage,

105

prothioconazole

106

dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thione) was applied at 80 g·ha-1 and tebuconazole (α-(2-(4-

107

chlorophenyl)ethyl)-α-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-1-ethanol) was applied at 160

108

g·ha-1. At the flowering stage, dimoxystrobin ((αE)-2-[(2,5-dimethylphenoxy)methyl]-α-

109

(methoxyimino)-N-methylbenzeneacetamide) at 100 g·ha-1 and boscalid (2-chloro-N-(4′-

110

chloro[1,1′-biphenyl]-2-yl)-3-pyridinecarboxamide) at 100 g·ha-1 were applied. The subplot

111

factor was the rate of nitrogen fertilisation. Nitrogen fertiliser was applied at two levels: 160

112

and 220 kg Nha-1. The sub-subplot factor was represented by cultivars sown at different seeding

113

rates; open-pollinated cultivar Casoar was sown at a seeding rate of 60 and 80 seedsm-2, while

114

the fertility-restored hybrid cultivar Visby was sown at 50 and 70 seedsm-2. The experiment

115

was carried out on proper brown soil formed from heavy clay sand, on light or middle clay, of

116

quality class IIIa and good wheat complex. The winter oilseed rape crops previously cultivated

117

on the soil were rye, lucerne, and spring wheat. The chemical constituents of the soil were as

118

follows: P2O5, 221–276 mgkg-1; K2O, 135–191 mgkg-1; Mg, 31–73 mgkg-1; and N, min 6.6–

119

9.4 mgkg-1. The pH of the soil ranged from 6.3 to 7.2 when measured using 1 M KCl. Before

120

sowing, the field received 20–25 kg Nha-1 (ammonium nitrate), 51–80 kg P2O5ha-1 (triple

121

superphosphate), and 105–112 kg K2Oha-1 (60% potash salt). Winter oilseed rape was sown

122

with 30-cm row spacing on 26–29 August. Plants on all investigated plots were protected using

Disease identification and assessment of infection were performed at the ripening stage,

were determined. The percentage of plants showing symptoms of disease infection was

142

estimated as mean disease incidence (DI) using the formula:

143

DI = AP×100/T,

144

where AP is the number of affected plants and T is the total number of examined plants.

145

Stem infection was assessed on all plants on a plot, and silique infection was estimated on 100

146

siliques randomly selected per plot. Disease severity of silique lesions was determined as the

147

percentage of disease-affected area of each silique.

148

The plants were counted per unit area on each plot before and after winter and directly

149

before harvest. Before the harvest, the number of siliques per plant were counted on 15

150

consecutive plants on each plot. Number of seeds per silique was determined by counting the

151

number of seeds in 25 siliques sampled randomly from each plot. Weight of 1000 seeds was

152

calculated from the weight of 400 seeds taken from the bulk yield samples. Based on the number

153

of siliques per plant and the number of plants counted directly before harvest, the number of

154

siliques per unit area was determined. Yield of seeds per plot was adjusted to 13% moisture

155

content and then converted to Mgha-1.

156

The experimental data were compared using an analysis of variance (ANOVA). When

157

F-ratio was significant, the least significant difference was calculated at P≤0.05 using Tukey’s

158

test. ANOVA was performed using STATISTICA software (StatSoft Inc., 2011).

Weather conditions and fenological crop development

164

The growing seasons in which the experiment was conducted differed significantly in

165

meteorological conditions and influenced the fenological development of winter oilseed rape

166

plants (Table 2). The length of the fall growing season ranged from 78 days in 2011 to 94 days

167

in 2012, and total precipitation from 45.8 mm in 2011 to 109.9 mm in 2013. The most

168

unfavourable weather condition in autumn was noted in 2013, when the shortage of

169

precipitation before sowing, the cool and very rainy September and the cool first decade of

170

October, and the stagnation of vegetation at the end of the second decade of November limited

171

the development and the number of plants before winter. As a result of these conditions, oilseed

172

rape plants developed only eight medium-sized leaves before winter, compared to 2011 and

173

2012 when the crop plants developed 12 large-sized leaves before winter and were in very good

174

condition. The mean daily temperature during the winter dormancy was determined at -1.0 °C

175

in 2012–2013 and at 2.9 °C in 2013–2014, while in the coldest decade of winter this parameter

176

ranged from -12.4 °C in 2011–2012 to -5.3 °C in 2012–2013 (Table 2). In 2013 and 2014, the

177

climatic condition during winter were conducive to crop overwintering, while in the coldest

178

decade of 2012, frost reaching -20 °C at night, not accompanied by snowfall did not favour

179

overwintering of oilseed rape plants. Due to the difference in the beginning of vegetation, the

180

length of the spring growing season ranged from 106 days in 2013 to 122 days in 2014. The

181

beginning of vegetation in spring was observed on 16 and 15 March in 2012 and 2014,

182

respectively, while in 2013, on 8 April. Total precipitation was determined at 170 mm in 2012

183

and over 244 mm in 2014. A small amount of precipitation until the full flowering phase in

184

2012 did not favour the production of siliques. In 2013, a similar effect resulted from the late

start of vegetation. Water conditions that were much more favourable for the development of

186

siliques were observed in 2014. However, abundant rainfall during this flowering season was

187

also conducive to plant infection by S. sclerotiorum. The seed harvest was carried out on 13,

188

23, and 15 July in 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively.

Disease control

194
195

The protective programs significantly affected the occurance of pathogens on the crop (Tabela

196

3). All effectively limited the disease symptoms (Table 4). Moreover, by affecting

197

overwintering of plants and 1000 seed weight significantly affected the yield (Table 5). The

198

average yield of seeds from the plants subjected to protective programmes was significantly

199

higher than that from the unprotected plants by 420–560 kgha-1 (Table 6). The effectiveness of

200

plant protection programmes depended on the environmental conditions that shaped the

201

development of plants (Table 7). In the season 2011–2012, significantly higher yields were

202

obtained on plots where plants were protected in autumn compared to the yields on control

203

plots. The autumn treatment of plants with a fungicide with growth-regulating properties

204

contributed to the limitation of plant losses during the winter which resulted in grater number

205

of siliques per m2 compared to unprotected plots in autumn. However, in the season 2013–

206

2014, when plant development in the early stages was limited by the precipitation

207

shortage before sowing and relatively low temperatures in September and the first

208

decade of October (Table 2), significantly higher yields were obtained from the plots

209

without the autumn treatment compared to the yields on the control plots. In the season

210

2012–2013, all methods of protection against pathogens significantly prevented the loss of

211

yield. The yield from the protected plots was significantly higher than the yield from the

212

unprotected plots by 420–580 kgha-1. None of the remaining experimental factors—cultivars

213

sown at different seeding rates and levels of nitrogen fertilisation—had influence on the yield-

Rate of nitrogen fertilisation

245

The increase in the level of nitrogen fertiliser from 160 to 220 kgha-1 caused a significant

246

increase in the average seed yield (Table 6). The effectiveness of nitrogen fertilisation varied

247

during the years of the study. The nitrogen fertilisation significantly increased the seed yield in

248

the second and the third season (2012–2013 and 2013–2014) (Table 8). The effectiveness of

249

nitrogen fertilisation was not influenced neither by cultivars sown at different seeding rates nor

250

by fungicide treatment (Table 5). The higher yield obtained with 220 kg Nha-1 can be attributed

251

to the higher number of siliques per unit area (Table 6). The number of siliques per unit area

252

was the only yield component that significantly increased with an increase in the rate of nitrogen

253

fertilisation (220 kgha-1). Similar to the yield, this parameter also significantly increased with

254

the increase in the rate of nitrogen fertilisation in the second and the third experimental cycle

255

(2012–2013 and 2013–2014) (Table 8).

The average yield in the 3-year experiment ranged from 1.82 to 6.39 Mgha-1 (Table 6). The

262

highest seed yield was observed in the season with favourable wintering and water conditions

263

for the stages of flowering and fruit growth (2013–2014), whereas the lowest yield was noticed

264

in the year with the least favourable conditions for dormancy (2011–2012). Regardless of the

265

seeding rate, the hybrid cultivar Visby showed the highest average yields (5.04 Mgha-1 at 70

266

seedsm-2 and 4.76 Mgha-1 at 50 seedsm-2) in the study. The average yield of the open16

267

pollinated cultivar Casoar was more dependent on the seeding rate; a higher yield (4.31 Mgha-1)

268

was obtained at the higher seeding rate (80 seedsm-2), whereas lowering the seeding rate to 60

269

seedsm-2 resulted in a yield decrease by 410 kgha-1. The effect of seeding rate on the yield of

270

the assessed cultivars was dependant on the weather conditions during the seasons in which the

271

experiment was conducted (Table 9). In the least favourable conditions for plant development

272

(2011–2012), significant differences in the yields were noted in Visby cultivar sown at different

273

seeding rates (2.87 Mgha-1 at 70 seedsm-2 and 2.29 Mgha-1 at 50 seedsm-2). However, in the

274

most favourable conditions (2013–2014), significant differences were observed in the yields of

275

Casoar cultivar (6.54 Mgha-1 at 80 seedsm-2 and 5.82 Mgha-1 at 60 seedsm-2). Moreover, in

276

these conditions, and also in the conditions of the 2012–2013 season, the yields of Casoar

277

cultivar from the plots sown at a higher seeding rate (80 seedsm-2) did not differ significantly

278

from the yields of Visby cultivar from the plots sown at 50 and 70 seedsm-2.

279

Higher yields of Visby cultivar can be attributed to the higher number of seeds per silique and

280

higher number of siliques per m2 resulting from the higher number of plants per m2 before

281

harvest despite the lower seeding rate of 10 seedsm-2 and the greater compensation ability

282

expressed by the greater number of siliques per plant (Table 6). Average higher number of

283

Visby cultivar plants before harvest observed with the lowest seeding rate resulted from the

284

greater overwintering success of this cultivar in the season with the worst conditions of

285

dormancy. In turn, the higher number of siliques per plant of Visby cultivar was a result of the

286

higher plant height. On average, a Visby cultivar plant was taller than a Casoar cultivar plant

287

by 15 cm (data not shown). Irrespective of the cultivar, an increase in seeding rate (Visby: 50–

288

70 pure live seedsm-2; Casoar: 60–80 pure live seedsm-2) decreased the number of siliques per

289

plant and the weight of 1000 seeds. However, significant differences were recorded between

290

the cultivars only in the number of siliques per plant.

Discussion

295

Disease control

296

The winter oilseed rape is exposed to disease infections throughout the growing season. The

297

loss of yields is caused, on the one hand, by infection depending on the genetically controlled

298

resistance of cultivars [38] and the effectiveness of protection from pathogens, and on the other

299

hand, by the incidence of pathogens that cause the most dangerous diseases in this species, such

300

as blackleg (P. lingam, syn. Leptosphaeria maculans), stem rot (S. sclerotiorum), light leaf spot

301

(Cylindrosporium concentricum, syn. Pyrenopeziza brassicae), verticillium wilt (Verticillium

302

dahliae), dark pod spot (Alternaria brassicae), downy mildew (Peronospora parasitica), grey

303

mould (B. cinerea), and clubroot disease (Plasmodiophora brassicae) [31, 42, 48], triggered by

304

the environmental and agrotechnical conditions. The conducted experiment showed that the

305

applied fungicides limited the yield losses resulting from pathogen infection and unfavourable

306

wintering conditions (Table 4, 6, 7). The presented results thus broaden the view of Kruse and

307

Verreet [21] that the increase in yield due to fungicides treatment is a result of not only the

308

inhibition of infection by pathogens but also the action of fungicides as a growth regulator,

309

which contributes to shortening the main shoot, reducing plant lodging, and increasing the

310

resistance of siliques to cracking. In the season 2011–2012 characterised by severe and

311

snowless winter, the use of chemical fungicide with growth-regulating properties at the six-leaf

312

phase (BBCH 16) allowed limiting the loss of plants during winter dormancy and thereby

313

resulting in higher crop yields from the protected plots in autumn (Tbla 7). This result is also

314

confirmed by the previous studies of Geisler [11], Paul [27], and Schulz [34], which showed an

315

increase in the winter hardiness of winter oilseed rape as a result of shortening the plant growth

316

with the use of growth regulators. However, in the season 2013–2014, autumn treatment was

317

not very effective (Table 7). The winter was mild (Table 2), and the treatment at the six-leaf

318

stage of winter oilseed rape plants that were poorly developed due to unfavourable weather

319

conditions did not significantly reduce the yield losses (Table 7). During this season,

320

significantly higher yields were obtained with spring treatment, compared to the yields

321

collected from control plots. Although the effectiveness of all the applied protective methods

322

was significant only in the 2012–2013 season, it is worth emphasising that during the

323

experiment period, the lowest yields were always obtained from the unprotected plots. This

324

indicates the effectiveness of the chemical protection programme used in the experiment in

325

reducing plant infection. The programme that included treatment at the full flowering stage

326

(BBCH 65) was the most effective in reducing the symptoms of stem rot (S. sclerotiorum) and

327

dark pod spot (A. brassicae) (Table 5). The effectiveness of the treatment in the phase of full

328

flowering was also confirmed by Jankowski et al. [17] and Kruse and Verreet [21]. In turn, the

329

combination of the autumn and early-spring treatments was the most effective in limiting the

330

disease symptoms caused by P. lingam, syn. L. maculans (Table 5). Similar results were also

331

reported by Kruse and Verreet [21]. Moreover, the experiment did not show any differences in

332

yield between the cultivars as a result of intensification of protection, confirming the earlier

333

reports of Jajor et al. [15], Jędryczka and Kaczmarek [18], and Wójtowicz [48] and thus

334

indirectly indicating the need to include a chemical protection programme in the cultivation of

335

winter oilseed rape.

336
337

Rate of nitrogen fertilisation

338

Spring nitrogen fertilisation is considered to be one of the most important factors of production

339

[4, 31]. In many experiments, yield increase has been achieved within the dose limits of 150–

340

180 kg Nha-1 [3, 4, 35], and therefore, high (about 240 kg) [46, 50] and very high doses of

341

nitrogen fertilisation (about 300 kg) [36] are rarely required. Determination of the optimal

342

nitrogen dose is hampered by the strong dependence of fertilisation efficiency on the changing

343

weather conditions in the years. In the present work, the increase in the level of fertilisation

344

from 160 to 220 kgha-1 proved to be effective in the second and third growing seasons (2012–

345

2013, 2013–2014). However, in the first season (2011/2012), in the conditions of severe and

346

snowless winter and shortage of rainfall during spring development (Table 2), the increase in

347

the level of fertilisation was ineffective (Table 8). The obtained results correspond with the

348

results presented by Jankowski et al. [17], which also showed the variability of fertilisation

349

efficiency in the years of investigations, when in one season there was a significant increase in

350

the yield at a dose of 240 kgha-1, and in another at a dose of 180 kgha-1. The present research

351

(Table 5) also confirms the results of studies describing a similar response of cultivars to

352

nitrogen fertilisation [8, 17], despite their diverse ability to take up and use nitrogen [19, 44].

353

Therefore, unequal nitrogen uptake and utilisation abilities are usually not significant enough

354

to contribute to a significant difference in crop yield that can result from the varied level of

355

nitrogen fertilisation in the range of doses recommended for agricultural practice. An indirect

356

confirmation of the above statement is the small number of scientific reports showing a

357

significantly different response of cultivars to nitrogen fertilisation. Howewer Wielebski and

358

Wójtowicz [43] showed a significantly lower dependence of the yield level on the level of

359

nitrogen fertilisation of the first hybrid cultivar Synergy in comparison with population

360

cultivars. A similar tendency was confirmed by the research of Pellet [28], except that no

361

statistically significant differences were shown by the results. The results of the present study

362

(Table 4) are also in line with the results presented by Sadowski et al.[33] and Lemańczyk et

363

al. [23], which showed that the increase in nitrogen fertilisation did not increase the severity of

364

disease symptoms caused by S. sclerotiorum and Leptosphaeria ssp. The lack of a negative

365

impact of increased nitrogen fertilisation on the infection of plants by the most dangerous

366

pathogens of oilseed rape is desirable from the point of view of production intensification.

368

Cultivars sown at different seeding rates

369

The yield level is an indicator of a plant’s development which depends on its response to

370

environmental and agrotechnical conditions. The plant response is in turn mainly conditioned

371

by the impact of environmental and agrotechnical factors and its adaptability to adverse

372

conditions. In the unfavourable seasons, yields are significantly determined by the plant

373

resistance to stress. Compared to the Casoar cultivar, over 1-tonne higher yield was recorded

374

for the Visby cultivar in the 2011–2012 season (Table 9), characterised by severe and snowless

375

winter (Table 2), due to the greater winter hardiness and consequently the better wintering of

376

this cultivar, which resulted in a much greater number of siliques per unit area (by more than

377

1000 per m2). In the conditions of severe and snowless winter and shortage of rainfall during

378

spring development in the season 2011–2012, the yield of the Visby cultivar was influenced

379

mainly by the derivative of the sowing rate—the number of plants per unit area—as evidenced

380

by the higher yields (over 0.5 tonne) collected from the plants sown densely at 70 seedsm-2

381

(Table 9). In the season 2013–2014 characterised by a shortage of rainfall during emergence

382

and good moisture content in spring, the amount of seeds sown determined the yields of the

383

Casoar cultivar which showed a significant difference. Significantly higher yields were

384

collected from the Casoar cultivar plants sown more densely at 80 seedsm-2. The lack of a

385

significant variation in the yield of the hybrid cultivar in this season indicates that due to its

386

greater vigour it was able to better utilise the favourable humidity conditions recorded in spring

387

2014. In the remaining growing seasons, the variation in the yield level between the plots sown

388

at different rates was statistically insignificant. Nevertheless, in the case of both hybrid and

389

open-pollinated cultivars, higher yields were collected from the plants sown more densely.

390

These results are consistent with the study by Jankowski et al. [17], which assessed the impact

391

of the seeding rate (80, 60, and 40 seedsm-2) of hybrid cultivars on their yield and showed that

392

the highest yields were obtained from densely sown plants (80 seedsm-2). Similar results are

393

found in the work of Wójtowicz et al. [49], which revealed a significant reduction in the yield

394

of the hybrid cultivar when the amount of seeds sown was reduced from 70 to 35 seedsm-2.

395

Experiments showed that in the conditions of Wielkopolska higher yields were obtained at

396

higher seeding rates as a consequence of the unfavourable humidity conditions during

397

emergence and thermal conditions during the winter dormancy period resulting in a reduction

398

in the number of plants per unit area and the late beginning of vegetation and shortage of

399

precipitation in the spring limiting the production of siliques. This broadens the view presented

400

by Jankowski and Budzyński [16] about the influence of thermal conditions during winter and

401

humidity in spring on the yields from plots sown at varied seeding rates. The humidity

402

conditions during emergence also play an equally important role and can significantly adversely

403

affect the number of plants per unit area. Earlier results of Wójtowicz et al. [49] proved that

404

adverse conditions causing a decrease in plant density can occur with high probability during

405

plant emergence.

406

In the three years of experiment (2009–2011) conducted in Wielkopolska region, unfavourable

407

conditions during early autumn development, which contributed to a reduction in the number

408

of plants in relation to the amount of seeds sown by about 40%, were recorded in two growing

409

seasons (2009–2010 and 2010–2011). From the presented results (Table 5), the lack of a

410

significant interaction between the amount of seeds sown for the evaluated cultivars and the

411

applied levels of nitrogen fertilisation is also worth noting. The above dependence suggests that

412

in the experimental conditions higher plant density did not limit plant development. These

413

results are consistent with those of Budzyński [4], who in intensive technologies for excessive

414

compaction for hybrid cultivars in spring recognised 60 plantsm-2. Despite the documented

415

possibility of reducing the amount of seeds sown to 20–40 pure live seedsm-2 [20, 22, 40], the

416

presented results force taking into account the humidity conditions when determining the

417

seeding rate, especially in the areas characterised by higher probability of precipitation

418

shortage. In addition, the results lead to a hypothesis that under the conditions of predicted

419

global warming, which will result in greater weather variability, the role of the amount of seeds

420

sown, a basic element of rapeseed agrotechnology, in yielding will increase. Another factor that

421

will be of more importance in the future is the selection of cultivar for cultivation. Furthermore,

422

the more frequent occurrence of unfavourable conditions for the development of crop plants

423

will require looking for stable-yielding cultivars.

424
425

Conclusion

426

The conducted experiment showed that all the analysed factors had a significant impact on the

427

yield level. The applied fungicides limited the crop losses resulting from pathogen infection

428

and unfavourable wintering conditions. The protection programme consisting of treatment at

429

the BBCH 65 flowering stage most effectively reduced the damage caused by stem rot (S.

430

sclerotiorum) and dark pod spot (A. brassicae). In turn, the protection programme combining

431

the autumn and early-spring treatments most effectively limited the infection caused by P.

432

lingam, syn. L. maculans. In addition, the effectiveness of nitrogen fertilisation varied during

433

the years of the study. In the conditions of shortage of precipitation during spring development

434

after a period of stress caused by severe and snowless winter, the increase in the rate of

435

fertilisation up to 220 kgha-1 was ineffective. In less stressful conditions, nitrogen fertilisation

436

exerted a yield-increasing effect up to a rate of 220 kgha-1. Increase in nitrogen fertilisation

437

level also did not increase the severity of disease symptoms caused by S. sclerotiorum and

438

Leptosphaeria ssp. This lack of a negative impact of increased nitrogen fertilisation on plant

439

infection by the most dangerous rape pathogens is desirable from the point of view of

440

production intensification. The yield of seeds depended both on the yield potential of the

441

cultivar and its ability to develop under stressful conditions. The experiment has shown a

442

greater resistance of the restored hybrid cultivar Visby to the adverse thermal conditions. Good

443

winter hardiness allowed obtaining relatively high yields of this cultivar in the conditions of

444

severe and snowless winter. Moreover, due to its greater vigour than Casoar cultivar, Visby

445

cultivar was able to better utilise the favourable humidity conditions that were recorded in

446

spring 2014, and regardless of the amount of seeds sown, its yield was high. By contrast, the

447

yields of Casoar were more dependent on the amount of seeds sown. Nevertheless, both

448

cultivars yielded higher at a higher sowing rate. They also responded similarly to plant

449

protection programmes and the rate of nitrogen fertilisation in spring.
