Abstract
Euchromatic histone methyltransferases (EHMTs), members of the KMT1 family,
methylate histone and non-histone proteins. Here we uncover a novel role for EHMTs
in regulating heterochromatin anchorage to the nuclear periphery (NP) via nonhistone (LaminB1) methylations. We show that EHMTs methylates and stabilizes
LaminB1 (LMNB1), which associates with the H3K9me2-marked peripheral
heterochromatin. Loss of LMNB1 methylation or EHMTs abrogates the
heterochromatin anchorage from the NP. We further demonstrate that the loss of
EHMTs induces many hallmarks of aging including global reduction of
H3K27methyl marks along with altered nuclear-morphology. Consistent with this, we
observed a gradual depletion of EHMTs, which correlates with loss of methylated
LMNB1 and peripheral heterochromatin in aging human fibroblasts. Restoration of
EHMT expression reverts peripheral heterochromatin defect in aged cells.
Collectively our work elucidates a new mechanism by which EHMTs regulate
heterochromatin domain organization and reveals their impact on fundamental
changes associated with the intrinsic aging process.

Introduction
The Euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferases G9a, encoded by EHMT2, and
GLP, encoded by EHMT1 (KMT1/Suv39 methyltransferase family), are present as
heteromeric complex and negatively regulate gene transcription. The SET domain of
EHMT catalyzes mono and dimethylation of lysine residues at histone3 (H3) in vitro
and in vivo [1–5]. H3K9me2 deposited by EHMT1/2 complex demarcates
heterochromatin, particularly non-genic regions and is prevalent in gene deserts,
pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions, with little being observed at individual
active or silent genes. Non-coding and gene containing DNA present at the NP are
also marked by the presence of H3K9me2 which spans several megabases [6,7].
Specifically, these domains are strongly correlated with binding of LMNB1 and are
depleted of H3K4me3 and RNA Polymerase II activity [6]. These data suggest that
H3K9me2 domains are critical determinants of higher-order chromosome structure in
association with the nuclear lamina (NL).
In mammalian cells, the NL acts as a hub for multiple cellular functions including
chromatin organization [8–11]. NL is composed of A and B type lamins along with
inner nuclear membrane (INM) proteins [12], and together with mediator proteins
such as Barrier-to-Autointegration Factor (BAF) and Heterochromatin Protein 1
(HP1), facilitate attachment of chromatin to NL [13,14]. Additionally, these
interactions have been proposed to form specific chromatin organization that opposes
transcriptional activity [15]. The association between LMNB receptor and LMNA/C
mediates peripheral heterochromatin attachment in a wide variety of mammalian cells
[16]. Any perturbation in such organization leads to a complete loss of peripheral
heterochromatin and developmental abnormalities [17].

Recent studies demonstrated that the Lamina associated domains (LADs) enriched in
H3K9 methyl (me2/me3) marks contact NL via association with LMNB1 [7,18–20].
These interactions are highly stochastic in nature and are dependent on H3K9me2
activity governed by G9a/EHMT2. Accordingly, G9a/EHMT2 promotes LAD
formation and its loss leads to the opposite effect [18]. Similar to humans, H3K9
methylation is important for heterochromatin positioning in C. elegans [21], as
depletion of H3K9 methyltransferases Met2 and Set-25 (mammalian SETDB1 and
G9a /EHMT2 homolog) leads to detachment of large gene-array from peripheral
heterochromatin. Altogether, loss of lamins and INM proteins or H3K9me2 activity
leads to peripheral heterochromatin defects, however, whether there is a link between
these common consequences remains unknown. Here we establish EHMT proteins as
a common module that governs heterochromatin tethering via histone dependent
(H3K9me2) and independent mechanisms (by directly regulating LMNB1
methylation).

Results
EHMTs associates with LMNB1
To identify the novel non-histone interactors of EHMT proteins, endogenous EHMT1
was immunoprecipitated (IP) and unique bands in the EHMT1 pull down were
subjected to LC/MS analysis. We found LMNB1 and histone proteins as interactors of
EHMT1 (Fig 1A). Mass spectrometry data was validated by sequential IP reactions of
endogenous EHMT1 and LMNB1 proteins (Fig 1B). This interaction was also found
using nuclear extracts from human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) (Fetal derived unless
mentioned otherwise), suggesting that it is not cell type specific interaction (Fig
Supplementary Fig 1A). Consistent with previously published reports, we also
detected HP1 in association with EHMT and LMNB1 (Supplementary Fig 1A). The
absence of Ash2l (a member of H3K4 methyltransferase complex) in the IP-EHMT1
or IP-LMNB1 confirmed the specificity of IP reaction (Supplementary Fig 1A).
Mapping experiments (in vivo and in vitro) to identify the LMNB1 interacting domain
of EHMT1, revealed that the SET domain of EHMT1 is sufficient to bind to LMNB1
(Supplementary Fig 1B and C; Fig 1C). These results confirmed that the EHMT1/2
directly associates with LMNB1 via its SET domain.
Both EHMT and LMNB1 are known to interact with chromatin independently or via
mediator proteins [17,22,23]. To identify EHMT1-LMNB1 co-bound regions in the
genome, we performed ChIP-Seq analysis. Individually, EHMT1 and LMNB1
occupied 36807 and 32688 number of peaks respectively and 8584 peaks were cobound by EHMT1 and LMNB1 (Fig 1D). A majority of EHMT1 and LMNB1 reads
were distributed on non-TSS regions such as introns and gene-poor regions
(represented as “others”) (Fig 1E and F), whereas only 1.5% of reads were found on
the upstream region of genes (Fig 1F). Functional category analysis of the genes

occupied by EHMT1, LMNB1 or EHMT1-LMNB1 revealed enrichment of genes
regulating transcription, signal transduction and cell adhesion (Supplementary Fig
1D-F).
H3K9me2 deposited by EHMT1/2 complex demarcates heterochromatin, particularly
non-genic regions and is prevalent in “other regions” such as gene deserts,
pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions, with little being observed at individual
active or silent genes. Detailed analysis of read densities performed on individual
chromosomes identified a significant correlation (p<0.001) between EHMT1 and
LMNB1 localization. Interestingly, we observed higher ChIP-seq read density onto
subtelomeric, and around centromeric regions (indicated as a red line on the
chromosome) that are preferentially maintained in the silent state (Fig 1G, H, and
Supplementary Fig 1G). These data suggested that EHMT1-LMNB1 associates on
gene-poor areas that are the critical determinants of higher-order chromosome
structure at the NP.

EHMTs methylate LMNB1
Next, we tested if LMNB1 is a substrate for methylation by the EHMT enzymes.
Using an in vitro fluorometric methyltransferase assay we demonstrate an increase in
fluorescence upon incubation of EHMT1-SET domain with GST-LMNB1 in presence
of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) (Supplementary Fig 2A). To confirm that EHMT
proteins indeed methylate LMNB1, we used lysine methyl-specific (Methyl-K)
antibody to probe for methylated LMNB1. Purified LMNB1 C terminus protein
containing the rod domain and tail domains (LMNB1-CT) (Supplementary Fig 2B)
was used in this assay. Towards this, we performed in vitro methyltransferase assay
using different concentrations of LMNB1 and incubated with an equimolar ratio of

the EHMT1/2-SET domain in presence or absence of SAM. When products of these
reactions were immunoblotted using the Methyl-K antibody, specific methylation
signal was observed upon incubation of LMNB1 with EHMT1/2-SET in presence of
SAM (Fig 2A and B).
Further, to examine if LMNB1 is methylated in vivo, we performed anti-Methyl-K or
anti-LMNB1 IPs from HEK nuclear lysates. Products of IPs were split into two
halves and probed with either anti-LMNB1 or anti-Methyl-K specific antibodies.
Several lysine residues are methylated on the H3 tail, detecting the histone signal in
IP-Methyl-K confirmed the specificity of IP reaction and served as a positive control
(Fig 2C). The presence of a LMNB1 band in the same Methyl-K IP samples indicated
the presence of endogenous methylated LMNB1 (Fig 2C). In reciprocal IP reaction in
which LMNB1 was IP’ed and probed with Methyl-K antibody, identification of
Methyl-K signal in the IP-LMNB1 confirmed LMNB1 methylation in vivo (Fig 2D).
It has been reported that EHMT2 is capable of methylating lysine on dipeptide ArgLys (RK) sequence of non-histone proteins [24]. We synthesized peptides for such
motifs present at the C-terminus of LMNB1 and identified K417 as the methylation
site targeted by EHMT1 and EHMT2 (Fig 2E). K417A peptide mutation abolished
methylation of LMNB1 (Fig 2E). To investigate the function of methylated LMNB1
in vivo, we mutated the 417K residue to alanine (K417A) in the wild-type (Wt.)
LMNB1 construct. As opposed to Wt.LMNB1, which was localized at the NP, much
of K417A-LMNB1 was accumulated in the nucleoplasm (Fig 2F and Supplementary
Fig 2C-E). We also observed aggregates of mutant LMNB1 transported into the
cytoplasm, and was accompanied by abnormal nuclear morphology (Fig 2F and
Supplementary Fig 2C, 2F). Co-staining with LMNB1 antibody showed localization
of endogenous LMNB1 and overexpressed Wt.LMNB1 at the NP in Wt.LMNB1

expressing cells (Fig 2F). However, in mutant-LMNB1 expressing HDFs, endogenous
LMNB1 was localized in K417A-LMNB1 aggregates indicating a dominant negative
function of the mutant protein (Fig 2F). Further mislocalization of LMNA/C in the
aggregates of mutant-LMNB1 (Supplementary Fig 2G) indicated LMNB1
methylation is critical for maintaining the NL meshwork composition at the
periphery. Based on these data we speculated that the methylation modification
prevents the degradation of LMNB1 and confers protein stability.

EHMTs regulate LMNB1 levels
To test the consequence of the loss of EHMTs on LMNB1 levels we used shRNAs
and achieved approximately 60% and 70% depletion of EHMT1 and EHMT2,
respectively (Supplementary Fig 3A-C).

Reduced expression of EHMT2 in

shEHMT1 cells and vice-versa indicated reciprocal stabilization of these proteins
within the heteromeric complex (Supplementary Fig 3A-C). Further reduced levels of
LMNB1 protein in shEHMT1 and shEHMT2 cells (Fig 3A) confirm the regulation of
LMNB1 by EHMTs.

Moreover, shEHMT1 and shEHMT2 cells exhibited a

significant distortion of nuclear morphology (Fig 3B, C, and Supplementary Fig 3D).
Recent studies demonstrate that the B-type lamins are long-lived proteins [25].
Therefore, loss of such proteins is a combination of transcriptional inhibition and
protein degradation. Thus, we tested if EHMT proteins regulated LMNB1 expression
transcriptionally. Our data demonstrate approximately 60% loss of LMNB1 transcript
upon depletion of EHMT proteins (Fig 3D). Overall our results demonstrate that
EHMT1 and 2 regulate LMNB1 expression transcriptionally and directly via posttranslational modification.

EHMT mediated histone and non-histone methylation influences peripheral
heterochromatin organization
H3K9 methylation and LMNB1 are the critical determinants for the formation of the
LADs at the NP [7,18–20]. To test the requirement of EHMT mediated H3K9
dimethylation in tethering peripheral heterochromatin, we depleted EHMTs and
monitored the co-localization of H3K9me2 with LMNB1. Global H3K9me2 was
decreased by 50% in shEHMT1 and 80% in shEHMT2 cells (Supplementary Fig 4A
and B), confirming that EHMT2 is the predominant HMTase among EHMT proteins.
Though H3K9me2 is primarily localized to the NP in shCnt and shEHMT1 HDFs,
there was a significant loss of enrichment of H3K9me2 in shEHMT2 cells
(Supplementary Fig 4C-E and Fig 4A).
Next, we performed EM to investigate the status of heterochromatin in EHMT
depleted cells. shCnt transduced HDFs exhibited a layer of electron dense peripheral
heterochromatin just beneath the nuclear envelope (NE) (Fig 4B). Knockdown of
EHMT2 led to the partial disruption of heterochromatin from the periphery to the
interior of the nucleus (Fig 4C). This result was correlated with redistribution of
H3K9me2 marks towards the interior of the nucleus. In shEHMT1 HDFs, we noticed
near complete detachment of peripheral heterochromatin and a distorted NE (Fig 4D).
We also detected floating islands of heterochromatin in the nuclei. Interestingly, the
severity of heterochromatin detachment and compromised NE integrity were unique
to shEHMT1 knockdown wherein H3K9me2 activity was modestly affected.
We also looked at the effects of pharmacological inhibition of H3K9me2 on overall
heterochromatin positioning and nuclear distortion. HDFs treated with BIX 01294
showed 40% less H3K9me2 staining compared to controls (Supplementary Fig 4F-H)

with no changes in the LMNB1 methylation levels (Supplementary Fig 4H). Unlike
EHMT depleted cells, we did not notice any significant changes in the nuclear
morphology of BIX treated cells (Supplementary Fig 4F and I). EM imaging indicated
modest changes in heterochromatin anchorage (Supplementary Fig 4I). Interestingly
addition of BIX did not influence EHMT mediated methylation of LMNB1 in

(Supplementary Fig 4J).
To obtain a clearer picture of the role of LMNB1 methylation, HDFs were
transfected with either the Wt.LMNB1 or K417A-LMNB1 construct. Overexpression
of Wt. or mutant LMNB1 did not alter the levels of H3K9 dimethylation
(Supplementary Fig 4K-L). Immunostaining for H3K9me2 revealed the colocalization
of H3K9me2 with LMNB1 at the NP in Wt.LMNB1 overexpressing cells (Fig 4E
upper panel). In mutant-LMNB1 expressing cells, the peripheral distribution was
severely compromised and we noticed segregation of LMNB1 and H3K9me2
aggregates in the nucleoplasm (Fig 4E lower panel and Supplementary Fig 4M). EM
analysis revealed that the nuclei of mutant-LMNB1 expressing cells were devoid of
peripheral heterochromatin and displayed a ruptured nuclear envelope (Fig 4F-G).
This data suggests that the mislocalization of K417A LMNB1 could be responsible
for the loss of peripheral distribution of chromatin. Nonetheless, our results
demonstrate the significance of EHMT mediated LMNB1 methylation in stabilizing
LMNB1 at the NP and heterochromatin organization.
To investigate the additional changes that could influence heterochromatin
organization in EHMT depleted cells we profiled gene expression changes in
shEHMT1 and shEHMT2 HDFs. RNA-Seq analysis identified overlapping and
unique genes that were regulated by EHMT1 or EHMT2 (Supplementary Fig 5A,

Supplementary Table 1 and 2), which were enriched for genes involved in the cellcycle, homeostasis and axon guidance etc. (Supplementary Table 3). Interestingly,
significantly high numbers of pathways were distinctly regulated by EHMT1 and
EHMT2 (Supplementary Table 3). The varying degree of peripheral heterochromatin
detachment in shEHMT1 vs. shEHMT2 HDFs led us to investigate the number of
chromatin modifiers that were altered upon EHMT depletion. While there were
overlapping chromatin modifiers that changed in response to EHMT depletion,
EHMT1 loss reduced expression of repressive PRC1 components (Supplementary
Table 4). On the contrary EHMT2 reduction predominantly influenced the expression
of KDMs, SIRT6 and SETD1 proteins (Supplementary Fig 5B, Supplementary Table
4). Functional validation of the loss of PRC members was performed by assaying
EZH2 transcript and H3K27 methyl marks. Reduced EZH2 expression and
H3K27me3 staining in shEHMT1 and shEHMT2, indicates that knockdown of
EHMTs affects PRC protein expression (Fig 4H and I upper panel). Interestingly, we
detected the loss of HP1 only in shEHMT1 cells but not in shEHMT2 HDFs (Fig 4I,
lower panel). Overall our results revealed the commonalities and differences upon
individual knockdown between two structurally similar proteins that contribute to the
phenotype of peripheral heterochromatin detachment.

Sequential loss of EHMT proteins correlates with diminished peripheral
heterochromatin organization during physiological aging
The cellular phenotypes induced by EHMT1 knockdown impinge on known
molecular hallmarks of cellular aging [26]. These observations prompted us to survey
if age-related genes were affected in response to EHMT depletion. Comparison of
RNA-Seq profile obtained from shEHMT1 and shEHMT2 HDFs identified

approximately 30% of aging specific genes (Total 108 of 307 genes listed in the aging
database) were altered in response to depletion of EHMT (Supplementary Fig 6A and
Supplementary Table 5). PCR analysis verified that genes linked to senescence, aging
and diabetes are differentially regulated upon EHMT depletion (Supplementary Fig
6B and C).
To test if EHMTs and H3K9me2 are indeed involved in regulating the aging process,
we monitored the expression of EHMT1 and EHMT2 in HDFs derived from
individuals of different age groups.

As previously reported histone methyl marks

H3K27me3, H3K9me3 and HP1 are diminished in aged HDFs (Supplementary Fig
6D and E). Further investigation into levels of EHMT proteins revealed a decline of
EHMT1 and EHMT2 in an age-dependent manner (Fig 5A-D). Compared to fetal
cells, 18Y old HDFs exhibited decline in EHMT2 and preceded the loss of EHMT1
(Fig 5B and C). An investigation of the status of H3K9me2 methylation demonstrated
its decline in aging fibroblasts (Fig 5E and F). An equally important observation was
that the preferential localization of H3K9me2 was noticed at the NP in fetal HDFs,
while these marks were distributed in the nucleoplasm in 18Y and 65Y HDFs (Fig 5F
and Supplementary Fig 7A-D). This data correlates with our observations that
reduction of EHMT2 in fetal-HDFs results in the re-localization of H3K9me2 methyl
marks to the nucleoplasm (Fig 4A and Supplementary Fig 4C).
We next examined whether progressive loss of EHMTs and altered distribution of
H3K9me2 impacts heterochromatin organization in aging cells. Compared to fetal
cells, in 18Y and 31Y HDFs, heterochromatin was still retained at the periphery
where there was a substantial loss of EHMT2 (Fig 5G and A). We also observed a
redistribution of peripheral heterochromatin, which correlated with redistribution of
H3K9me2 marks (Fig 5G and Fig 4B). Further, there was a gradual loss of peripheral

heterochromatin in 40Y old cells with complete depletion observed in 65Y aged
nuclei (Fig 5G). Interestingly complete loss of peripheral heterochromatin
organization was correlated with loss of EHMT1 and EHMT2 in aged cells as shown
in Fig 5A-C.
Since both EHMTs were downregulated during aging we explored the regulation of
EHMT1 and EHMT2 transcripts and proteins. The EHMT1 transcript was
downregulated by 10% from fetal to 18Y HDFs and was further downregulated by
90% from 18Y to 65Y stage (Supplementary Fig 7E). This data clearly indicated that
EHMT1 expression is controlled transcriptionally during aging.

On the contrary,

only 30% of EHMT2 was regulated transcriptionally (20% downregulation from fetal
to the adult state, with a further decline by 30% from adult to aged cells)
(Supplementary Fig 7E). Since a small amount of EHMT2 was regulated
transcriptionally, there seemed a strong possibility of post-translation regulation
during aging. Hence, to investigate if EHMT2 protein levels are regulated via
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPS), we treated 18Y and 65Y old HDFs with the
proteasome inhibitor MG-132. In 18Y old cells, EHMT2 protein levels were
increased to 2-fold upon MG-132 treatment, whereas no such increase was noticed in
EHMT1 levels (Supplementary Fig 7F and G). Interestingly, EHMT2 levels could not
be rescued in 65Y HDFs (Supplementary Fig 7F), indicating that the blockade of UPS
activity can restore the EHMT2 degradation only in early age group and such
mechanisms do not operate in aged cells wherein EHMT2 is already drastically low.
Taken together our data on the loss of EHMT1 either as a consequence of
physiological aging or by forced depletion in fetal HDFs implicates EHMTs in
heterochromatin organization at the NP.

Low levels of LMNB1 have been observed in senescent cells and fibroblasts derived
from Progeria patients [27]. In this study, expression analysis of nuclear lamins in
intrinsically aged cells showed decline in LMNA/C from fetal to 18Y age and then
the protein levels remained constant in further age groups (Fig 5H). Contrary there
was a dramatic reduction of LMNB1 starting in the 18Y age group with a significant
loss at 65Y (Fig 5H and I). Diminishing levels of LMNB1 were correlated with the
reduction in EHMT2 protein with drastic loss upon depletion of EHMT1 protein in
65Y cells (Fig 5A-D). This is consistent with the data in Figure 3 where we found that
EHMT proteins directly regulate levels of the LMNB1 protein.
Next, we investigated whether diminishing perinuclear heterochromatin organization
in aging nuclei is a result of the loss of EHMT1, EHMT2 and LMNB1 interaction.
Towards this, we performed IP experiments using Fetal, 18Y and 65Y HDF nuclear
extracts. Our results revealed an association between EHMT2 and LMNB1 occurred
in fetal cells and was highly diminished in adult and aged cells (Supplementary Fig
2H). On the contrary, EHMT1 associated with LMNB1 in all the age groups and the
interaction was reduced gradually in age-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig 7I).
The complete absence of perinuclear heterochromatin in 65Y-aged nuclei
corresponded to over 80% reduction in the interaction between EHMT1 and LMNB1.
These data indicated that EHMT1 and LMNB1 association is involved in maintaining
peripheral heterochromatin in aging fibroblasts.
Further, we tested the status of LMNB1 methylation during the physiological aging
and found the reduced intensity of a methylated LMNB1 signal from Fetal to 31Y
with virtually no methylation in 65Y-aged cells (Fig 5J-L). Taken together our results
indicate that the loss of peripheral heterochromatin in EHMT depleted cells or aged
cells occur due to loss of H3K9 activity coupled with the loss of LMNB1, which are

critical determinants of peripheral heterochromatin anchorage.

Overexpression of EHMT proteins rescues peripheral heterochromatin defect in
aged cells
To test if depletion of EHMT proteins is indeed responsible for the loss of peripheral
heterochromatin in aged cells we transfected full-length V5 tagged EHMT1 or FlagEHMT2 (set domain) plasmids in 65Y HDFs. Immunostaining using V5 or Flag
antibodies confirmed the overexpression of EHMT1 and EHMT2 proteins (Fig 6A).
EHMT1 levels enhanced the expression of LMNB1 but the Flag-SET of EHMT2 had
no effect on LMNB1 levels (Fig 6A middle and lower panel and Supplementary Fig
8A and B).
We further examined H3K9me2 localization and organization of heterochromatin in
EHMT1 and EHMT2 overexpressing cells. In both the cases H3K9me2 was colocalized with LMNB1 at the NP (Fig 6B). Consistent with this, EM imaging revealed
peripherally organized heterochromatin upon EHMT1 and EHMT2 overexpression,
which was completely absent in untransfected aged cells (Fig 6C-E). These results
demonstrate that the reduction of EHMT proteins contributes to the loss of peripheral
heterochromatin organization during aging and this defect can be reversed upon reexpression of EHMT proteins.
To investigate the contribution of LMNB1 methylation in reversing peripheral
heterochromatin tethering in aged cells we co-expressed wild-type or mutant-LMNB1
with V5-EHMT1 or Flag-EHMT2. As expected Wt.LMNB1 localized with H3K9me2
at the NP in EHMT1 overexpressing cells (Supplementary Fig 8C, upper panel).
Instead, H3K9me2 showed aggregated staining in the nucleoplasm and did not

role for methylated LMNB1 in organizing heterochromatin to the NP.

Proliferation rate of HDFs correlate with EHMT expression
Previous reports have demonstrated that the reduction in LMNB1 expression results
in reduced proliferation and induction of premature senescence [28,29]. Therefore, we
tested if the reduction of LMNB1 expression upon loss of EHMTs leads to altered
proliferation. Interestingly, shEHMT1 & 2 showed a significant reduction in cell
number (Fig 7A and B). Cell-cycle analysis revealed a small fraction of EHMT2
transduced cells (8.4%), were in SubG1 phase compared to shCnt and shEHMT1
HDFs (Supplementary Fig 9A-C and Fig 7C), indicating a small but significant
apoptosis in shEHMT2 cultures. This observation is supported by transcriptome data
showing the upregulation of apoptotic genes upon knockdown of EHMT2
(Supplementary Table 2 and 3).

shRNA mediated loss of EHMT proteins also

induced senescence program. We observed higher number (approximately 15 fold) of
senescent cells in shEHMT1 in comparison to shEHMT2 (2 fold) (Fig 7D and E).
The telomerase enzyme prevents the replicative senescence in primary fibroblast.
Examining the levels of telomerase activity in shEHMT and aged cells identified a
correlation between the loss of EHMT proteins with reduced telomerase activity (Fig
7F and G). Overall our results demonstrated that the depletion of EHMT1 and
EHMT2 was correlated with reduced proliferation.

posttranslational modifications (PTMs) that are crucial for their localization to
regulate a variety of biological processes [32]. While uncovering the mechanism by
which EHMTs organize heterochromatin, we have identified lysine methylation as a
novel PTM on the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of LMNB1 that is critical for its
retention at the NP and maintaining NL stability. Interestingly, this NLS motif is
conserved in LMNA/C and is required for lamin-chromatin interactions [33]. High
resolution imaging of endogenous LMNA and LMNB1 demonstrated that individual
homopolymers exist in close contact with each other [28]. Our results showing that
aggregates of mutant-LMNB1 contain LMNA/C indicate the potential crosstalk
between the two proteins via PTMs, thereby opening new avenues to explore the role
of methylated LMNB1 towards the assembly of NL and its integrity. LMNA is
extensively studied with several known binding partners and disease causing
mutations [34]. However, patients with laminopathies rarely exhibit a defect in the
NLS sequence likely due to its lethality. In this regard, our study offers a new
perspective on the less studied LMNB1 in the context of normal physiology and
perhaps in laminopathies/disease.
Methylation of lysine residues facilitates a variety of functions including protein
stability [35–38]. Altogether our data demonstrated EHMT1 and EHMT2 as upstream
regulators of LMNB1 that influences its protein levels via PTMs. While EHMT2 is
known to methylate a variety of non-histone proteins [24], our study for the first time
demonstrates the competency of EHMT1 to methylate non-histone proteins and
utilizing it as a mechanism to attach heterochromatin to the NP during aging.
Structurally similar EHMT1/2 proteins form a heteromeric complex in mammalian
cells [23] and are known to fulfill both overlapping and unique physiological roles in
developing and adult animals [39]. In the quest to understand the individual

contributions of EHMT proteins in regulating peripheral heterochromatin, we
identified that both EHMTs regulate LMNB1. However, unique molecular changes
seen upon EHMT1 loss such as disruption of NE integrity coupled with the loss of
architectural proteins like HP1 and HMG that influence heterochromatin organization
requires further investigation. Nonetheless, our studies provide a broader role for
EHMTs by which it impacts the spatial distribution of the genome.
There are a number of studies demonstrating redistribution or loss of chromatin
modifiers and their implications in aging [40,41]. These studies mainly focused on the
consequence of the global loss of chromatin structure but none addressed the
mechanisms underlying the alteration of genome architecture. Our study not only
demonstrates the correlation between the expressions of EHMTs with peripheral
heterochromatin organization during aging but also provides a mechanism by which
EHMT regulates higher-order chromatin structure via stabilization of the NL and
architectural proteins. These results are supported by previous observations wherein
defects in the sophisticated assembly of nuclear lamins along with architectural
proteins results in disease or aging [41–45]. Reorganization of heterochromatin at the
NP by restoration of EHMT1 or EHMT2 in aged cells further reinforces the fact that
EHMT proteins are key determinants of higher-order chromatin organization.
Aging associated defects in chromatin organization exhibit a variety of functional
consequences such as misregulation of gene expression via alteration of the
epigenome, activation of repeat elements and susceptibility to DNA damage [46,47].
Additionally, loss of lamins leads to altered mechano-signaling [48]. Together, these
processes make aged cells stressed and also influence the stress response contributing
towards reduced proliferation and enhanced senescence. Our studies revealed a direct
correlation between loss of peripheral heterochromatin and reduced proliferation in

shEHMT and 65Y HDFs. Taken together, we conclude that the steady loss of EHMT
proteins drives normal aging in fibroblasts. It remains a mystery as to how EHMT
proteins are regulated. We propose that EHMT2 degradation leads to gradual
destabilization of EHMT1 in response to aging via currently unknown mechanisms. It
is important to note that these results are in cultured HDFs and yet to be established if
this extends in the context of tissue aging.

Protein Induction & purification from bacterial cells:
The plasmids containing the human EHMT1-SET domain, EHMT1 (2IGQ) and
EHMT2-SET domain, (Addgene plasmid # 25504 and Addgene plasmid # 25503
respectively) were expressed in Escherichia coli C43 (DE3) while LMNB1-CT was
expressed in Escherichia coli B834 (DE3) cultured in LB medium with 50 μg/mL of
kanamycin (Sigma). EHMT1 (2IGQ) (Addgene plasmid # 25504) and EHMT2
(Addgene plasmid # 25503) were a gift from Cheryl Arrowsmith. After induction,
cells were harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 25 mM Tris pH 8.0,
0.5 M NaCl, 2 mM L-Dithiothreitol (DTT, M109, Amresco), 5% glycerol, 0.05%
Nonidet P-40 Substitute (M158, Amresco); 3 µg/ml of deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I,
DN25, Sigma), 50 mM imidazole supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor
cocktail and 0.2 mM phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, 93482, Sigma). Cells
were lysed by sonication using Vibra Cell Sonicator (Sonics & Materials Inc.). The
crude extract was cleared and the supernatant was incubated overnight with 2 ml NiNTA Agarose resin pre-washed with the lysis buffer described above. The resin was
packed into Econo-Column (738-0014, Biorad). The column was washed and 6x His
tagged protein was eluted from the resin in protein elution buffer supplemented with
250 mM and 500 mM imidazole. The purity of protein was assessed by SDS–PAGE.
The purified protein was concentrated, buffer exchanged and protein dialysis was
performed using Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal concentrators (UFC801008, Millipore,)

mass-spectrometry analysis revealed a Mascot Score of 2354.46 for 6X His EHMT1SET.
Protein-protein interaction assays:
For interaction assays, Ni-NTA beads pre-washed with IP100 buffer (25 mM Tris pH
7.5, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% NP-40 and 200 µM PMSF)
were incubated with 300 to 500 ng of 6X His-EHMT1-SET. The beads were washed
twice with IP100 buffer followed by two washes with Flag buffer (20 mM HEPES,
150 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 15% glycerol, 0.1% NP-40 and
200 µM PMSF) both supplemented with 100 mM imidazole. The beads were then
incubated with LMNB1-GST (H00004001-P01, Novus Biologicals) or GST alone
(negative control) followed by washes with IP100 buffer and Flag buffer as
mentioned above. The bead bound proteins were eluted and subjected to western

Methyltransferase assay:
Detection by Western blot: LMNB1-CT and EHMT1-SET/ EHMT2-SET were
incubated along with 50 µM SAM in methyltransferase assay buffer in a 50 µl
reaction at RT for 1 h. 12 µl of 4x-SDS-PAGE loading dye was added to all the tubes
to stop the reaction, samples were heated at 95°C for 8 min and resolved by 10%
SDS-PAGE. The reaction was split into two, one was used for Western blot to probe
with Anti-Methyl-K antibody and the other half was used to stain with Coomassie
Blue stain (Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, Amresco).

Immunoprecipitation (IP):
For IP experiments, cell or nuclear lysates (400 ug) prepared from HEK293 or HDFs
to Dynabeads Protein A (10001D, Thermo Fisher Scientific) that were prebound with
2–3µg of indicated antibody and incubated overnight at 4°C. Beads were then washed
and eluted in 2X loading dye. Eluted proteins were subjected to western blotting with
indicated antibodies.

Sequential IP:
For sequential IP, nuclear extract was added to Dynabeads Protein A (10001D,
Thermo Fisher Scientific) pre-bound with 3-4 µg of EHMT1, EHMT2, LMNB1 and
Rabbit IgG antibodies overnight at 4oC. These beads were then washed with IP 100
and FLAG buffer. Primary IP elution was carried out with 0.1M glycine pH 2.5-3 for
10 min. The elution was stopped by Tris buffer pH 9.5. The elute from EHMT1,
EHMT2, LMNB1 and IgG were collected and incubated overnight at 4oC with
Dynabeads Protein A pre-bound with EHMT2, EHMT1, EHMT1 and IgG
respectively. The beads were subsequently washed with IP100 and FLAG buffer. The
elution for secondary IP was carried out in sample buffer at 95°C. Next, eluted
products were probed with respective antibodies in western blot as mentioned in the
Fig 1B.
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP):
ChIP was performed as described previously Brand et al 2008 [49] with some
modifications. In Brief, fetal HDFs were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde. Cells
were lysed in buffer N containing DTT, PMSF and 0.3% NP40. After isolation of

37oC for 10 min. Reaction was stopped using MNase stop buffer without proteinase
K. Simultaneously, antibodies against EHMT1, LMNB1 and Rabbit IgG were kept
for binding with Dynabeads for 2 h at RT. After equilibration of beads, chromatin
was added for pre-clearing. To antibody bound beads pre-cleared chromatin was
added and kept for IP at 40C overnight.
Next day, beads were washed and eluted at 65oC for 5 min. Eluted product was
subjected to reverse cross-linking along with input samples, first with RNAse A at
65oC overnight and then with proteinase K at 42oC for 2 h. After reverse crosslinking, DNA purification was performed using phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol
extraction method. The amount of DNA was quantitated using Qubit fluorometer

ChIP DNA was subjected to library preparation using TruSeq ChIP sample
preparation kit from Illumina (IP-202-1012). Briefly, ChIP samples were processed
for end repair to generate blunt ends using end repair mix. A single ‘A’ nucleotide
was added to the 3’ ends of the blunt fragments to prevent them from ligating to one
another during the adapter ligation reaction. In the next step, indexing adapters were
ligated to the ends of the DNA fragments. The ligated products were purified on a 2%
agarose gel and narrow 250-300bp size range of DNA fragments were selected for
ChIP library construction appropriate for cluster generation. In the last step, DNA
fragments with adapter molecules on both ends were enriched using PCR. To verify
the size and quality of library, QC was done on high sensitivity bioanalyzer chips
from Agilent and the concentration was measured using Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit
(Q32851, Thermo Fisher Scientific). After passing QC, samples were sequenced 75

Bengaluru, India, performed the sequencing.
ChIP-seq Analyses:
Alignment of ChIP-seq derived short reads to the human reference genome (UCSC
hg19) was done using Bowtie2 short read aligner [50] with default parameters.
Subsequently, aligned ChIP-seq reads from two replicates were merged. Peak calling
was done for each sample with their respective control using MACS 1.4 algorithm
[51]. The following parameters deviated from their default value: - effective genome
size = 2.70e+09, bandwidth = 300, model fold = 10, 30, p-value cutoff = 1.00e-03.
In order to identify regions enriched for EHMT1 and LMNB1, we employed a twostep approach, first total peak counts for EHMT1 and LMNB1 was calculated in 1MB
window for all the chromosomes. Next, ratio of total peak count over expected peak
count (total peaks from a chromosome divided by total 1 MB window for the same
chromosome) was calculated for each 1MB window. Raw data has been deposited in
NCBI {SRP110335 (PRJNA391761)}.
RNA-seq and data analysis
Fetal HDFs transduced with shEHMT1, shEHMT2 or shCnt were harvested and RNA
was extracted by Trizol method. RNA concentrations were estimated using Qubit
fluorometer and quality was assessed using Bioanalyzer. After passing the QC,
samples were subjected for library preparation and QC for the same. Samples were
sequenced at Genotypic Technology Pvt. LTD. Bengaluru, India.
We obtained ~30-45 million reads from EHMT1 and EHMT2 knockdown samples.
From the sequencing reads, adapters were trimmed using Trimmomatic program [52].
The reference based transcriptome assembly algorithms TopHat v2.1.0 [53], Cufflinks
v2.2.1 [54] pipeline were used to assemble the transcripts with hg19 genome/

Immunostaining:
Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA, P6148, Sigma) for 10 min
at room temperature (RT) and permeabilized with 0.5% triton X-100. The blocking
was done with 5% BSA for 1 h. Antibodies mentioned in the antibodies and inhibitors
section were used at desired dilution and imaging was carried out on FV3000
Confocal Microscope (Olympus). Image analysis and extraction of raw files was done
with the Fiji software [62].

with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% sucrose at RT for 1 h. Next, fixative was removed
and pellet was washed with 0.1M phosphate buffer pH7.4. The buffer was replaced
with 1% osmium tetraoxide and 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide and kept at 4oC for 75
min. Cell pellet was washed with 0.1M phosphate buffer as well as distilled water,
subsequently dehydrated with gradient of ethanol followed by two changes of
propylene oxide. Cell pellet was embedded gradually in Epoxy812 resin mixture
(13940, EMS). Resin embedded pellets were allowed to polymerize at 60oC for 72 h.
The blocks were trimmed; sections of 60nm size were collected and imaged with the
Tecnai G2 Spirit Bio-TWIN Transmission Electron Microscope at National Centre for
Biological Sciences (NCBS) EM facility.
Flow cytometry:
Cells were harvested and fixed in ice cold 70% ethanol for 30 min at 4°C. Post
fixation, cells were pelleted, washed twice in PBS and resuspended in 0.5ml PBS
containing 0.2mg/ml RNase A (EN0531, Thermo Fisher scientific) and incubated for
30 min at 37°C. To this Propidium Iodide (P3566, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a
concentration of 50μg/ml was added and incubated for 10 min at 37°C. The
percentage of cells in various phases of cell-cycle was assessed by flow cytometry
(BD FACSVerse) and analyzed using the FlowJo software.
Telomerase assay:
Telomerase activity was detected using the PCR-based Telomeric Repeat
Amplification Protocol (TRAP) assay kit (Millipore, S7700). Briefly, different age
groups HDFs or cells transduced with shEHMT1 and shEHMT2 were harvested and
resuspended in 1X CHAP Buffer provided with the kit. The protocol was followed as
per the manufacturer’s instructions.

For quantitation of fluorescence intensity in Fig 4A, Supplementary Figure 2E, 4E,
4M and Supplementary Fig 7A-D, MATLAB programming was used. Briefly,
centroid of nuclei was determined and 200-line scans from center to periphery of the
cells were drawn. Each line was further divided into 200 points. Average intensity
distribution was calculated for each nucleus by calculating mean of 200-line scans
from center to periphery. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was plotted for center vs.
periphery of nuclei. Mean intensity profile with standard deviation for all the
measured nuclei. The Script for MATLAB program is provided in Computer Code1.
