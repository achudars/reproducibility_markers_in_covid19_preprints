Abstract
Mutations in a gene encoding RNA-binding protein FUS was linked to familial forms of
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). C-terminal truncations of FUS are associated with aggressive
forms of ALS. However, motor neurons are able to tolerate permanent production of pathogenic
truncated form of FUS protein until its accumulation in the cytoplasm of neurones does not reach a
critical threshold.
In order to identify how the nervous system responds to pathogenic variants of FUS we produced
and characterised a mouse line, L-FUS[1-359], with a low level of neuronal expression of a highly
aggregation prone and pathogenic form of C-terminally truncated FUS. In contrast to mice with
substantially higher level of expression of the same FUS variant that develop severe early onset
motor neuron pathology, L-FUS[1-359] mice do not develop any sign of pathology even at old age.
Nevertheless, we detected substantial changes in the spinal cord transcriptome of these mice
comparing to the wild type littermates. We suggest that at least some of these changes reflect
activation of cellular mechanisms compensating to potentially damaging effect of pathogenic FUS
production. Further studies of these mechanism might reveal effective target for therapy of FUSALS and possibly, other forms of ALS.

Introduction
Mutations in the gene encoding FUS are among the most frequent causes of familial ALS
(fALS) and many of these mutations cause partial mislocalisation of this protein from the nucleus to
the cytoplasm of motor neurons where it aggregates with formation of large inclusions and
compromise various important cell functions

1-4

. Moreover, aggregation of FUS has been observed

in the cytoplasm of neurons in a subset of patients with sporadic form of ALS (sALS) as well as in
patients with certain variants of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-FUS) in the absence of
any mutations or polymorphisms of the gene encoding FUS 5-9.

Various invertebrate and vertebrate animal models of FUS malfunction, including several
transgenic FUS mouse lines have been produced and characterised in order to shed light on
molecular mechanisms of ALS-FUS and FTLD-FUS but the results of these studies were not
always consistent (reviewed in

10-12

). This might reflect a complex combination of intrinsic (e.g.

even subtle differences in genetic background) and environmental factors (e.g. type of animal diet)
that affect the manifestation of pathology in animals with genetic alterations of FUS structure of
expression. However, these are obvious similarities in how pathological changes develop in all
animal models. Motor neurons of transgenic mice expressing pathogenic variants of human FUS as
well as motor neurons of ALS patients carrying germ line mutations of FUS survive and function
normally for a relatively long period of time, suggesting that they successfully employ certain
intracellular mechanisms preventing damaging effects of the pathogenic protein when it present at
low levels. An ability to artificially boost these mechanisms activity, either directly or via
modulation of their regulatory pathways, can help counteracting pathogenic effects of FUS and
potentially, other ALS-linked proteins even when they accumulate in the neuronal cytoplasm
beyond a threshold that overload an intrinsic ability of the neuronal defence systems. Therefore, it is
important to identify how the nervous system responds to low levels of pathogenic variants of FUS
and prevents potentially damaging consequences of its permanent production.
Previously we have described production and characterisation of a transgenic mouse line FUS 1359 clone 19 (S-FUS[1-359]) with neurospecific expression of C-terminally truncated form of
human FUS (tr-hFUS) lacking its nuclear localisation signal and RGG domains

13

. This

modification recapitulates consequences of FUS gene mutations in certain forms of familial ALS 1417

typified by mislocalisation of modified FUS and aggressive disease with young onset and rapid

progression

18

. Although heterozygous mice of S-FUS[1-359] line express tr-hFUS at the lower

level than the level of expression of the endogenous mouse FUS, accumulation of tr-hFUS in the
cytoplasm of neurons leads to its aggregation and the development of FUS-proteinopathy
characterised by the presence of large inclusions, neuronal dysfunction and death. These

pathological changes are most pronounced in the motor neurons of the spinal cord, which causes the
development of severe and fast progressing motor neuron disease in young adult S-FUS[1-359]
mice and their death within one to three weeks from the onset of clinical signs 13.
Here we assessed changes in the spinal cord transcriptome of L-FUS[1-359] mice, another
transgenic mouse line produced along to S-FUS[1-359] line using the same transgenic construct.
Although these mice have substantially lower level of tr-hFUS expression in the spinal cord and do
not develop clinical signs of motor neuron pathology, we found a significant number of transcripts
that differentially regulated in the spinal cord of L-FUS[1-359] mice when compared to their wild
type littermate.

Results
Transgenic mice expressing low level of C-terminally truncated human FUS in their neurons do not
develop motor neuron pathology
A founder of L-FUS[1-359] transgenic mouse line was produced by pronucleus microinjection
of the same transgenic construct as was used for production of the previously described S-FUS[1359] line, namely a linear DNA fragment containing human FUS cDNA encoding amino acids 1 to
359 (tr-hFUS) under control of regulatory elements of mouse Thy-1 gene 13. The L-FUS[1-359] line
was established on a CD1 genetic background by serial backcrosses (>5) with the wild type CD1
mice. Intercrosses of heterozygous animals produced homozygous L-FUS[1-359] mice and their
wild type littermates that were used in some of experiments described below. Analysis of genomic
DNA revealed that L-FUS[1-359] mice carry the same number of tandemly arranged repeats of the
transgenic cassette as S-FUS[1-359] mice (Suppl. Fig. S1). However, the localisation on different
chromosomes (Suppl. Fig. S1) and presumably, different chromatin organisation around the
integration sites led to substantially different expression levels of the transgenic cassette in the
neural tissues of these two mouse lines. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the level of tr-hFUS
mRNA in the spinal cord of 9-week old L-FUS[1-359] mice is 20 times lower than in the spinal

cord of presymptomatic S-FUS[1-359] of the same age and maintained at the same CD1 genetic
background (Fig. 1a). Consistently, Western blot analysis with human FUS specific antibody
revealed substantially lower level of tr-hFUS protein in the spinal cords of L-FUS[1-359] mice
when compared to S-FUS[1-359] mice (Fig. 1b). While accumulation of tr-hFUS in the cytoplasm
of spinal motor neurons of S-FUS[1-359] mice leads to its aggregation with formation of large
cytoplasmic inclusions at the onset of clinical signs, i.e. at the age of 13 to 20 weeks (Fig. 1c and
13

), tr-hFUS remains diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm and also present in the nucleus of spinal

motor neurons of L-FUS[1-359] mice (Fig. 1c). The latter observation is consistent with only partial
cytoplasmic mislocalisation of FUS carrying point mutations in or completely lacking the NLS
reported in neurons of mice expressing low levels of these human FUS variants 38-40.
The low level of tr-hFUS expression is not sufficient for triggering motor neuron pathology or
any other obvious disease phenotypes even in homozygous L-FUS[1-359] mice (Fig. 2). The
lifespan of these animals was not different from the lifespan of their littermates (Suppl. Fig. S2) and
even in ageing animals no sign of spinal motor neuron loss was noted (Fig. 3).
Changes of spinal cord transcriptomes caused by expression of C-terminally truncated human FUS
To assess whether a low level of expression of a pathogenic variant of FUS affects gene
expression in the spinal cord of transgenic mice we employed RNA sequencing to compare spinal
cord transcriptomes of four 9-week old hemizygous L-FUS[1-359] mice and four of their wild type
littermates. As a result of deep-sequencing, we obtained from 13 to 17 million reads for each library
produced from an individual mouse thoracic spinal cord.
Our analysis of sequencing data revealed 272 DEGs with FDR < 0.05 that clearly distinguish
gene expression profiles of L-FUS[1-359] and WT mice on multidimensional scaling (Fig. 4a, b,
Supplementary table S1). In order to discriminate DEGs that are intrinsic for neurons and glial cells
we used the published datasets of purified microglia and laser-microdissected ventral horns of mice
spinal cord applying a 5-fold change cutoff of gene expression levels 30,31. As a result, we obtained
200 genes (> 73% of DEG, FDR < 0.05) that are more specific for spinal cord neurons than for

microglial cells and only 7 genes (< 3% of DEG, FDR < 0.05) that are intrinsic to microglia (Fig.
4c). Remaining 65 genes (~ 24% of DEG) were shared by both types of cells (Fig. 4c). Thus, the
observed gene expression changes in the spinal cord of L-FUS[1-359] mice take place
predominantly in neurons.
The gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of genes differentially expressed in L-FUS[1-359]
spinal cord revealed several groups of genes encoding proteins involved in biological processes
important for normal function of the nervous system. The largest group includes upregulated genes
for claudin 19 (Cldn19), tenascin XB (Tnxb), stabilin 1 (Stab1), basal cell adhesion molecule
(Bcam), collagens (Col14a1, Col15a1, Col18a1), collagen-binding proteins (Tgfbi, Nid2),
semaphorins (SEMA3G, SEMA4B and SEMA5A) and several other genes involved in cell adhesion
and organisation of extracellular matrix (green and yellow groups in Fig. 4d).
A significant number of genes involved in negative regulation of neuronal differentiation is also
upregulated in the spinal cord of L-FUS[1-359] mice, however genes encoding transcriptional
factor SOX2 and OLIG2 that play a central role in neuronal cell differentiation and spinal motor
neuron specification, respectively are significantly downregulated (red group in Fig. 4d).
The circadian rhythm related genes are highly represented between DEGs – all three paralogs of
the “core” clock activator gene period – Per1, Per2 and Per3, genes encoding the circadian
transcriptional repressors CIART and BHLHE40, and transcription factor DBP are upregulated in
the spinal cord neurons of L-FUS[1-359] mice, whereas genes encoding transcriptional activators
ARNTL and NPAS2, and transcriptional repressor NFIL3 are significantly downregulated (blue
group in Fig. 4d).
Expression of genes encoding the proteins assisting protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum
such as chaperones and chaperonins Hspa2, Hsp90b1, Dnajb11, Cryab, Mkks, protein disulfide
isomerases Pdia4, Pdia6 as well as calreticulin (Calr) are decreased in the spinal cord of L-FUS[1359] mice (lilac group in Fig. 4d).

We also observed the altered expression levels of genes encoding several actin-binding proteins
(Gas2l3, Flna, Coro6, Diaph and Ermn), a myosin (Myh11) and members of dynein family (Dnah5,
Dync1i1, Dynll1, Dnaic1, Dnah8) (Fig. 4d, Supplementary table S1).

Discussion
Familial forms of ALS with mutations in the FUS gene are characterised by a relatively early
onset and a fast progression of the disease (reviewed in

4,12,18

). Even so, despite a constant

production of a pathogenic variant of FUS, spinal motor neurons of FUS-ALS patients function
normally for decades (average age of FUS-ALS is ~43 years

12

). This suggest that by activating

certain compensatory mechanisms neurons are able to neutralise toxicity of pathogenic variants of
FUS until their accumulation, particularly when it is coupled with mislocalisation, reaches a critical
threshold or the cell defence machinery is compromised by an external or internal stress. Several
mouse models of ALS caused by modified expression of FUS display the same pattern of the
disease progression: animals are presymptomatic for a long period of their postnatal life (3-12
months, depending of the introduced genetic modification) but after the manifestation of first
clinical signs of pathology the disease progresses rapidly, mice develop severe motor dysfunction
and die within several days (reviewed in

10-12

). However, this phenotype is typical for mouse lines

expressing high levels or/and highly pathogenic variants of human FUS. In several recently
produced models a problem of artificially high levels of endogenous FUS expression was solved by
using knock-in techniques

40,41

, a relevant promoter

38

or selection of mouse lines with an

appropriate level of transgene expression 42. Although the common trend for later onset and longer
disease duration was observed, each model displayed distinct behavioural and histopathological
characteristics.
Expression of human FUS carrying point mutations in the NLS (either FUSR521C or FUSR521H) at
the level comparable with the level of expression of the endogenous mouse FUS caused progressive
motor dysfunction caused by the loss of muscle innervation, spinal motor neurons and their axons

in the absence of FUS mislocalisation to the cytoplasm and formation of inclusions 38. In the spinal
cord of ageing symptomatic transgenic mice in the absence of the endogenous mouse FUS the most
prominent changes revealed by RNA sequencing analysis were downregulation of mRNA encoding
proteins involved in protein synthesis and synaptic function, and upregulation of mRNA encoding
chaperons and proteins involved in RNA metabolism although no changes in a global splicing
pattern was observed.
In another recent study, human FUS lacking NLS was expressed under control of Thy-1
promoter in the nervous system of transgenic mice at the level of around 80% of the endogenous
mouse FUS expression. These mice developed a progressive motor impairment from the age of 12
weeks and significantly decreased lifespan. Cytoplasmic accumulation of deltaNLS FUS and
formation of large inclusions were observed in upper motor neurons before the onset of clinical
signs but in the spinal cord motor neurons, only at the age of one year. Neuroinflammation and the
loss of upper but not lower motor neurons was prominent in 1-year old mice. At the same age
cerebral cortex transcriptome analysis identified a large number of genes up- and downregulated as
the consequence of deltaNLS FUS expression but again, no notable changes of splicing pattern
were found.
To reveal changes in gene expression taking place in the nervous system of mice carrying ALSrelated modifications of FUS before they develop any clinical signs of pathology, Humphrey et al.
(2019) compared results of transcriptomic analysis of neural tissues from homozygous lategestation embryo (E17.5 spinal cord or E18.5 brain) of two independent FUS knock-in mouse lines
expressing FUS lacking nuclear localisation signal

40,41,43

. These data were compared to data

obtained in the same studies by RNA sequencing analysis of similar neural samples of FUS
knockout mice, which allowed to discriminate changes caused by the loss of FUS function and the
gain of function by FUS lacking NLS and therefore partially mislocalised to the cytoplasm. A
substantial overlap of DEGs in knockout and knock-in models suggested that at the presymptomatic
stage the effects of the substitution of endogenous FUS to deltaNLS FUS on gene expression is due

to the loss of function, i.e. an inadequate functionality of deltaNLS FUS that remains nuclear in
neurons of studied mice. Between identified DEGs, the most prominent changes common for
knockout and knock-in, as well as specific for homozygous knock-in mice were upregulation for
those that code for proteins involved in RNA metabolism and downregulation of those that code for
proteins involved in synaptic transmission. This is consistent with considerable changes of splicing
pattern identified in these studies and the growing body of evidence that defects of synaptic
transmission, particularly in the neuromuscular junctions, are very early events in the development
of pathology in animal models and FUS-ALS.
In our previously described model, S-FUS[1-359] transgenic mouse line, expression of highly
aggregation prone and pathogenic tr-hFUS protein caused a relatively early onset (at the age of ~1318 weeks), severe and fast progressing motor pathology despite its level in neural tissues at
presymptomatic stage was lower than the level of endogenous FUS 13. In the spinal cord of mice of
a new L-FUS[1-359] transgenic line described here the level of Thy-1 promoter-driven expression
of the same tr-hFUS protein was even lower than in the spinal cord of S-FUS[1-359] transgenic
line. Consequently, these animals did not develop motor deficiency, had the same lifespan as their
wild type littermates and were phenotypically indistinguishable from them. We suggested that when
the abundance of this pathogenic protein is low, neurons are able to neutralise any of its damaging
effects by adjusting certain intracellular mechanisms and pathways. In an attempt to identify these
adjustments, we analysed changes in the spinal cord transcriptomes of young adult L-FUS[1-359].
Importantly, in this model no pathology-driven changes in gene expression take place and therefore,
any observed expression changes should be linked to adaptation to production of tr-hFUS.
Substantial changes in the gene expression profile (272 of DEGs, FDR < 0.05) were found in the
spinal cord of L-FUS[1-359] mice although for most DEGs fold changes were relatively subtle
(average log2 fold change for upregulated DEGs was 0.8 and for downregulated DEGs – 0.6). The
majority of identified DEGs represented neuron-specific genes or genes expressed in neurons and
other types of cells, suggesting that gene expression changes is direct effect of tr-hFUS expression

in neurons. Minimal changes in expression of glia-specific genes is consistent with the absence of
neurodegenerative process and reactive gliosis in the spinal cord of L-FUS[1-359] mice. Due to the
deletion of RGG, Zn-finger and a part of RRM motifs, tr-hFUS lacks the ability to bind target
RNAs and therefore cannot directly affect RNA metabolism. Therefore, it was not surprising that
mRNA encoding proteins involved in RNA metabolism were barely represented in L-FUS[1-359]
DEGs in contrast to high representation of these mRNA in DEGs identified in studies of mouse
lines expressing low levels of FUS variants with intact RNA-binding domains 38,40 Humphrey et al.,
2019).
Between gene clusters identified in our analysis of RNA sequencing data, the most prominent
were upregulation of expression of genes encoding proteins involved in cell adhesion and structural
organisation of extracellular matrix. These proteins function as regulators of cell migration, axon
guidance and structuring of synaptic contacts, and therefore play important roles in the assembly
and function of neuronal networks. Despite being predominantly nuclear protein, FUS has
important functions in axonal and synaptic processes 44-49. It is feasible that the presence of tr-hFUS
in these neuronal compartments might have a dominant negative effect on these function of the
endogenous FUS. Increased production of proteins that can provide additional stabilisation of
neuronal networks might be a compensatory mechanism that efficiently prevents potentially
damaging effects of tr-hFUS. Consistently, we also found modified expression of several proteins
involved in organisation of actin cytoskeleton and motor proteins, indicating that the remodeling of
cytoskeletal structures and cellular transport take place in the spinal cord cell of L-FUS[1-359]
mice.
Unexpectedly, expression of tr-hFUS protein did not prompt upregulation of genes encoding
proteins involved in protein folding. Moreover, several chaperone or chaperonine encoding genes
appeared to be downregulated in the spinal cord cell of L-FUS[1-359] mice, although only slightly.
Probably at this level of expression tr-hFUS does not reach a concentration threshold required for
its efficient aggregation and therefore, activation of protein folding mechanisms is not required.

Further detailed studies are required to explain prominent changes in expression of several genes
encoding proteins involved in circadian rhythms because of different directions of these changes
and complex feedback loops regulating expression of these genes.
Overall, we found that the pattern of gene expression changes in the spinal cord of asymptomatic
mice expressing a low level of cytoplasmically mislocalised, aggregation prone and deficient in
RNA binding variant of human FUS is substantially different from patterns previously reported for
either symptomatic or presymptomatic mice expressing various human FUS variants at similarly
low levels. Observed changes reflects efficient adaptation of spinal motor neurons to expression of
a potentially pathogenic protein and therefore, molecular mechanisms and pathways affected by
these changes might be considered as valid targets for preventive therapy of FUS-ALS.

Materials and Methods
Animals
The L-FUS[1-359] mouse line was produced by pronuclear microinjection of a transgenic
cassette for expression of human FUS under control of regulatory elements of the mouse Thy-1
gene as described in our previous publications

13,19

. The cassette was identical to the cassette used

for production of S-FUS[1-359] mouse line and therefore, the same mouse genotyping protocol was
employed 13. Mice were maintained under 12/12 hour dark/light cycle with free access to food and
water. All animal work was carried out in accordance with the Rules of Good Laboratory Practice
in Russian Federation (2016). The Bioethics committee of Institute of Physiologically Active
Compounds, Russian Academy of Sciences provided full approval for this research (Approval No.
20 dated 23.06.2017).
Comparison of transgene copy number by quantitative PCR
Genomic DNA from ear biopsies was purified with Wizard® SV Genomic DNA Purification
System (Promega) and 0.1 µg was used for real-time qPCR amplification with primers 5’ –

human FUS in the transgenic cassette. Amplification of the GAPDH gene fragment with primers 5’
– CACTGAGCATCTCCCTCACA – 3’ and 5’ – GTGGGTGCAGCGAACTTTAT – 3’ was used
as a reference when the relative number of transgenic cassettes in DNA samples was assessed. The
CFX96 real-time PCR detection system (Biorad) and CYBR GreqPCR protocol were employed
with the cycle parameters: 10 min at 95°C followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and 60 s at 60°C.
Motor behaviour testing
Animal motor performance was assessed on the inverted grid and accelerating rotarod as
described previously 20,21.
A locomotor activity was monitored in a square 30 x 30 cm activity camera under 25 lux
illumination using the TRU SCAN Activity Monitoring System (Coulbourn Instruments, Whitehall,
PA, USA).
RNA extraction
Total RNA was extracted from thoracic spinal cord of 9-week old male mice using RNeasy Plus
Mini Kit with genomic DNA eliminator columns (Qiagen). For quantification and the quality
control of RNA samples Qubit fluorimetry and TapeStation analysis were employed.
Quantitative RT-PCR
1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed in the presence of random hexamer primers according
to manufacturer’s instructions (Eurogene, Russia) and resulting cDNA was used for qPCR reaction
with GAPDH as a reference gene as previously described 22,23. The same primers and amplification
protocol as for the genomic qPCR protocol above were used.
Protein extraction and Western blot analysis
Total proteins were extracted from the mouse spinal cords, separated by SDS-PAGE and
transferred to PVDF membrane by semidry blotting as described elsewhere

. Human FUS

protein was detected using rabbit polyclonal antibody 14080 (a kind gift from Don Cleveland)
specific to its N-terminal epitope, secondary anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated antibodies (GL

loading control membranes were re-probed with mouse monoclonal antibody against beta-actin
(clone AC-15, Sigma-Aldrich).
Histology and immunohistochemistry
The protocol for preparation of histological sections of the mouse spinal cord and
immunodetection of human FUS with antibody 14080 was described previously 13.
RNA sequencing
cDNA libraries for the dual indexed single-end sequence analysis were prepared from equal
amounts (270 ng) of each total RNA sample using Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA LT
Sample Prep Kit. Following libraries’ quality checks and normalisation, cDNA libraries were
sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 500 to generate single end 75 bp reads.
Sequencing data analysis
Processing of RNA sequencing raw data included the adapter, length and quality trimming by
Trimmomatic, mapping of reads to the mouse genome (release GRCm38) by STAR aligner,
counting the overlap of reads with genes by featureCounts, implemented in PPLine script

24-27

.

Differential gene expression analysis was performed with the edgeR package using a Fisher exact
test between experimental groups 28. We used the Benjamini-Hochberg method for multiple testing
FDR correction. The genes with expression level ≥ 1 Log10 CPM (counts per million) and FDR ≤
0.05 were taken into the account and considered as differentially expressed. Multidimensional
scaling between all experimental samples were performed with limma package, pairwise distances
were calculated using root-mean-square of Log2FoldChange values between experimental groups29.
Sorting of microglial and neuronal genes of the whole spinal cord samples were performed using
the published datasets of purified microglia and laser-microdissected ventral horns of mouse spinal
cord 30,31. We applied a 5-fold change cutoff of gene expression levels to discriminate neurons- and

Figure legends
Figure 1. Expression of tr-hFUS in the thoracic spinal cord of L-FUS[1-359] and S-FUS[1359] mice. a) Relative mRNA levels quantified by real-time qRT-PCR with primers specific for
human FUS mRNA. Total RNA samples from four 9-week old hemizygous male animals were
analysed in triplicates (*p<0.01, Mann-Whitney U-test). b) Western blot analysis of total protein
samples extracted from spinal cords of two hemizygous male L-FUS[1-359] , two hemizygous male
S-FUS[1-359] and two wild type mice (all 9-week old) with antibody specific for human FUS. For
loading control the same membrane was re-probed with anti-beta-actin antibody. Full-length blots
provided in Suppl. Fig. S3. c) Immunohistochemical staining of transverse section through the
spinal cord of 18-month old hemizygous male L-FUS[1-359] mouse and 4-month old early
symptomatic hemizygous male S-FUS[1-359] with antibody specific for human FUS. Note
accumulation of tr-hFUS in large cytoplasmic and small nuclear inclusions in an anterior horn
motor neuron of the S-FUS[1-359] mouse and diffuse distribution of tr-hFUS in the cytoplasm and
the nucleus of the L-FUS[1-359] mouse. Scale bars, 50 µm.

Figure 2. Animal performance in motor behaviour tests and their locomotor activity in
novel non-anxiogenic environment. Bar charts show means±SEM of values obtained by testing
one-year old homozygous male L-FUS[1-359] and wild type (WT) mice (10-12 per genotype). a)
The latency to fall from the accelerating rotarod. No significant difference between performance of
two groups of mice were found (p>0.05, Mann-Whitney U-test). b) The latency to fall from the
inverted grid. Note that all animals in each group successfully completed this 60-second test. c)
Total distance covered by an animal over the 5-minute test in the activity camera. No significant
difference between performance of two groups of mice were found (p>0.05, Mann-Whitney U-test).

its wild type littermate and 5-month old symptomatic hemizygous male S-FUS[1-359] mouse. Note
that while few motor neurons remained in the anterior horn of S-FUS[1-359] mice are either pale
stained or shrinked, the anterior horn of ageing L-FUS[1-359] mice have the same complement and
morphology of motor neurons as anterior horn of wild type animals.

Figure 4. Gene expression profile changes in the spinal cord of L-FUS(1-359) mice
compared to wild type littermates. a) Multidimensional scaling plot of RNA sequencing data for
L-FUS[1-359] mice (L, in purple) and wild type mice (WT, in green). b) Volcano plot
demonstrating an amount of DEGs in the spinal cord of L-FUS[1-359] mice compared to wild type
mice (FDR < 0.05). c) Distribution of DEGs between neuronal and microglial cells in the studied
samples. The sorting of genes to microglia and neurons was performed using a 5-fold change cutoff
of gene expression levels (FDR < 0.05). d) Gene ontology analysis of DEGs. The most enriched
GO terms of biological processes are present (p < 0.05) and sorted by their expression level
(Log2FC, FDR < 0.05) in L-FUS[1-359] mice in comparison to WT mice.
