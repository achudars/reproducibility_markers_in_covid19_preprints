It has long been thought that severe chronic pain conditions, such as Complex Regional
Pain Syndrome (CRPS), are not only associated with, but even maintained by a
reorganisation of the somatotopic representation of the affected limb in primary
somatosensory cortex (S1). This notion has driven treatments that aim to restore S1
representations, such as sensory discrimination training and mirror therapy. However,
this notion is based on both indirect and incomplete evidence obtained with imaging
methods with low spatial resolution. Here, we used functional MRI to characterize the S1
representation of the affected and unaffected hand in patients with unilateral CRPS. At
the group level, the cortical area, location, and geometry of the S1 representation of the
CRPS hand were largely comparable to those of the healthy hand and controls.
However, the area of the map of the affected hand was modulated by disease duration
(the smaller the map, the more chronic the CRPS), but not by pain intensity, pain
sensitivity and severity of the physical disability. Thus, if any map reorganization occurs,
it does not appear to be directly related to our pain measures. These findings compel us
to reconsider the cortical mechanisms underlying CRPS and the rationale for
interventions that aim to “restore” somatotopic representations to treat pain.

Significance statement
This study shows that the spatial map of the fingers in S1 is largely preserved in chronic
CRPS. Shrinkage of the area of the affected hand map can occur in the most chronic
stages of disease. Map shrinkage is related to CRPS duration rather than diagnosis, and
is unrelated to how much pain patients experience or to the severity of the physical
disability. These findings challenge the rationale for using sensory interventions to treat
pain by restoring somatotopic representations in CRPS patients.

Chronic pain is a highly common and debilitating disorder, that can be associated with
functional and morphological changes in the brain. For instance, it has long been
thought that some severe chronic pain conditions, such as Complex Regional Pain
Syndrome (CRPS), are not only associated with, but even maintained by, maladaptive
topographic changes in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) (Maihofner et al., 2003,
2004). Magneto- and electro-encephalography (MEG, EEG) studies have suggested that
the representation of the CRPS hand in S1 is abnormally smaller than the cortical
representation of the healthy hand (Juottonen et al., 2002; Maihofner et al., 2003; Pleger
et al., 2004; Vartiainen et al., 2008; Vartiainen et al., 2009). The notion of S1
reorganisation has been central to our understanding of the condition (Marinus et al.,
2011) and has driven physiotherapy interventions aimed at restoring sensorimotor
representations of CRPS limbs, such as mirror-visual feedback (McCabe et al., 2003;
Smart et al., 2016) and sensory discrimination training (Pleger et al., 2005; Moseley et
al., 2008a). Here, we revisit the notion of S1 reorganisation with the better tools that
modern functional MRI currently offers: high spatial resolution and phase encoded
methods that provide reliable and unbiased measures of the cortical somatotopy of the
hand (Mancini et al., 2012; Sanchez-Panchuelo et al., 2012; Kolasinski et al., 2016a).

In all previous studies on CRPS, the size of the hand map was estimated both indirectly
and incompletely: it was estimated by measuring the Euclidean distance between
activation loci of the thumb or index finger relative to that of the little finger. The
somatotopy of the full hand has never been characterized in CRPS patients. A more
reliable fMRI method for studying cortical topographic representations is based on
phase-encoded mapping, which reveals the spatial preference of cortical neural
populations (Sereno et al., 1995; Silver and Kastner, 2009; Sereno and Huang, 2014).
This method involves delivering a periodic sensory stimulus to different portions of the
receptive surface and evaluating which voxels selectively respond to the spatial
frequency of the stimulation. Voxels sensitive to the stimulus respond when the stimulus
passes through the preferred spatial location and decay as the stimulus moves away
(Chen et al., 2017). The response phase angle, extracted using a Fourier transform
(Mancini et al., 2012), indicates the location preference for each voxel—in other words,
the position of the receptive fields of the population of neurons sampled by the voxel.
Using phase-encoded mapping, we provide the first complete characterisation and
quantification of the representation of the fingers (i.e. with exclusion of the thumb) in
patients with chronic and unilateral CRPS to the upper limb. We tested whether the S1
representation of the fingertips of the affected hand was different from that of the healthy
hand of CRPS patients and from controls in terms of its spatial extent, location relative to
the central sulcus, and geometry (i.e. variability of the map gradients).

Participants. We recruited 20 adults with unilateral CRPS to the upper limb and 20
healthy controls (HC) matched for age, gender and handedness. Each participant gave
written informed consent to take part in the study. All experimental procedures were
carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by both the
Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of New South Wales (HC13214)
and by the Human Ethics Committee of the South Eastern Local Health District (HREC
10/051). Inclusion criteria for control participants were: (1) pain-free at that time of the
study; (2) no prior history of a significant chronic pain, psychiatric or medical disorder; (3)
no history of substance abuse. Inclusion criteria for CRPS patients were: (1) a diagnosis
of unilateral CRPS to the upper limb or hand according to the Budapest research criteria
(Harden et al., 2010); (2) CRPS duration greater than 3 months; (3) no history of
substance abuse and no psychiatric-comorbidities. Five of 40 participants were excluded
from the study due to the following problems: MRI scanner failure (subject #31) or
acquisition problems (#13, #15, #32) and a control participant reported pain to the wrist
on the day of scan (a median nerve compression was subsequently diagnosed, #42).
The demographic and clinical information of the remaining sample (Controls: n = 17;
CRPS to the left hand: n = 8; CRPS to the right hand: n = 10) is reported in Table 1.
Clinical evaluation. Patients were clinically evaluated according to the Budapest
research criteria (Harden et al., 2010) by a blinded assessor of the research team on the
first session of the study to confirm that the research criteria were met. As part of the
clinical and diagnostic assessment of CRPS, we assessed pressure pain thresholds
(PPT; kg/cm2) using a digital pressure algometer (Wagner instrument, Greenwich, USA)
on two sites of each hand: the thenar eminence and the third proximal interphalangeal
joint. Pain intensity was also rated using an 11-points Likert scale, where 0
corresponded to “no pain” and 10 indicated “the worst pain imaginable, like a red hot
poker through your eye”. The intensity of spontaneous pain in the upper limb was rated
in all patients immediately before, during and after the imaging session. Two control
participants reported discomfort and mild to moderate postural pain to the upper limb
during the scanning session (Table 1). Furthermore, the QuickDash (Disabilities of the
Arm, Shoulder and Hand) questionnaire was administered to all participants; the
QuickDash measures physical function and symptoms in people with musculoskeletal
disorders of the upper limb (Kennedy et al., 2011).
Stimuli. We used a customised stimulus (polypropylene probe with a rounded tip)
because CRPS skin physiology and symptoms (hand dystonia, pain) preclude the use of
conventional and automated mechanical stimulation for the prolonged time required
for phase-encoded mapping of the fingertips (approx. 40 minutes). For example, hand
dystonia makes it difficult to target the same skin regions with air-puffs throughout the
imaging session; this would have resulted in scan quality deterioration or early scan
termination. CRPS-related hyperhidrosis (i.e. excessive sweating) precludes the use of
electrical and vibrotactile stimulation for a long time.

All control participants reported the stimulus as being clearly detectable, neither painful
nor unpleasant, and similarly intense on the different fingers of the two hands. All
patients described the sensation that was elicited by stimulation of the unaffected
fingers, in similar terms to those used by the control participants. Patients described the
sensation that was elicited by stimulation of the affected fingers in a variety of ways;
“burning”, “tingling”, “pain”, “brushing like with a sharp object”, “horrible”, “itchy”,
“scraping”, “like a needle prick”, “electric shooting pain”. These terms are consistent with
the clinical phenomenon of allodynia.
Participants did not report systematic differences in stimulus perception across the
fingertips of the same hand. Pain intensity fluctuates over time in most chronic pain
conditions (including CRPS), even despite highly-controlled and reproducible stimulation
(Foss et al., 2006). However, such fluctuations are unlikely to confound our measures of
cortical somatotopy. Indeed, our analysis method allowed to dissect the magnitude of
the brain responses from their spatial organization. All our analyses did not focus on the
magnitude of the S1 responses, but on their spatial organisation, which is not
confounded by unavoidable fluctuations of perceived stimulus intensity in CRPS
patients.
Procedure. Each participant laid supine inside the scanner bore with both hands palm
upwards. Participant’s arms and hands were propped with cushions and pads to
minimise movements. The stimulus consisted of periodic stimulation of the fingertips of
both hands. In each stimulation cycle, the tips of the index, middle, ring, and little fingers
were successively stimulated using a customised probe (see below). Each fingertip was
stimulated for 6 s, and each cycle (four fingers x 6 s = 24 s) was interleaved by 6 s of
rest. Twelve cycles were administered in each of the four consecutive functional runs
(approx. 10 minutes each). Two trained experimenters stimulated the tips of homologous
fingers of the right and left hands simultaneously. The experimenters received auditory
cues through headphones, synchronising the location and timing of each stimulus. The
thumb was not stimulated to reduce scanning time and due to practical difficulties in
stimulating the thumb in succession to the other fingertips (patients could not keep the
hand open flat for prolonged periods of time).
Our choice of bilateral stimulation was motivated by the need to map the fingertips of
both hands in a single imaging session (several patients travelled from distant regions in
Australia). Importantly, our choice was grounded on neuroscientific evidence that there
are extremely limited trans-callosal connections between the hand representations of S1
in the primate brain (Jones and Hendry, 1980; Killackey et al., 1983). We note that some
studies have reported an inhibitory response to hand stimulation in ipsilateral S1
(Hlushchuk and Hari, 2006; Lipton et al., 2006; Klingner et al., 2011). The deactivation of
ipsilateral S1 is most likely mediated by an input that ascends the contralateral pathway
to a higher-order cortical area, crosses in the corpus callosum, and is then fed back to
area 3b in S1 (Lipton et al., 2006; Tommerdahl et al., 2006). Ipsilateral finger
representations are engaged in active movement, but not during somatosensory

processing (Berlot et al., 2018). Peripheral nerve injury can enhance activity in ipsilateral
S1 (Fornander et al., 2016), especially at the level of interneurons in laminae V and VI
(Pelled et al., 2009). Crucially, ipsilateral activations and deactivations in S1 are diffused
and not somatotopically specific (Helmich et al., 2005; Reed et al., 2011; Ann Stringer et
al., 2014; Geva et al., 2017). They can modulate the amplitude of the S1 response
(which is not of interest here), but there is no evidence that they affect the spatial
(somatotopic) organisation of the contralateral responses (Reed et al., 2011; Ann
Stringer et al., 2014; Geva et al., 2017). This is further confirmed by our preliminary
imaging data, in which we found that unilateral vs. bilateral fingertip mapping yielded
both greatly similar and highly reproducible fingertip maps in S1 (Figure 1). Therefore,
we considered bilateral finger stimulation as a resource-efficient method to map the S1
somatotopy of the fingers of both hands in a single imaging session, thus boosting
recruitment and compliance of CRPS patients.
MRI acquisition. Echoplanar images (1.5 mm3 isotropic resolution, 183 volumes/run, 32
axial slices, flip angle = 82°, TR = 2s) were collected in four runs on a Philips Achieva TX
3T
MRI
scanner
using
a
32-channel
head
coil.
FreeSurfer
(https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) was used to reconstruct the cortical surface for each
subject from a structural T1 image (0.727×0.727 mm2 in-plane, 0.75 mm thick slices, 250
slices, flip angle = 8°, TR = 6.318 ms). In four subjects (28, 29, 33, 34), structural T1
images were corrected for non-uniform intensity using the AFNI’s tool ‘3dUnifize’
(https://afni.nimh.nih.gov), before surface reconstruction, because these images
contained shading artefacts that could have affected segmentation.
First-level MRI analyses. All first-level analyses were performed by a researcher (FM)
blinded to the group condition (right CRPS, left CRPS, control). The first 3 volumes from
EPIs were discarded from all analyses. Functional series were aligned and motioncorrected using the AFNI program ‘3dvolreg’. Using this as a starting point, functional-tohigh resolution alignment was then refined using manual blink comparison using an
adaptation
of
Freesurfer’s
TkRegister
implemented
in
csurf
(http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/∼sereno/.tmp/dist/csurf). After linear trend removal, aligned
data from the four runs were raw-averaged, and then analysed using a fast Fourier
transform, computed for the time series at each voxel fraction (vertex): this resulted in
complex-valued signals with the phase angle and magnitude of the BOLD response at
each voxel. The phase angle is the measure of interest here, because it reflects the
spatial preference of a given voxel. Both Fourier and statistical analysis were performed
using csurf. No spatial smoothing was performed before statistical analyses. Very low
temporal frequencies and harmonics (< 0.005 Hz) were excluded because movement
artefacts dominate responses at these frequencies, a procedure virtually identical to
regressing out signals correlated with low frequency movements. High frequencies up to
the Nyquist limit were allowed (i.e. half the sampling rate); this corresponds to no use of
low pass filter. For display, a vector was generated whose amplitude is the square root
of the F-ratio calculated by comparing the signal amplitude at the stimulus frequency to
the signal at other noise frequencies and whose angle was the stimulus phase. To

minimize the effect of superficial veins on BOLD signal change, superficial points along
the surface normal to each vertex were disregarded (top 20% of the cortical thickness).
The F-ratio was subsequently corrected at p < 0.01 using a surface-based cluster
correction for multiple comparisons as implemented by surfclust and randsurfclust within
the csurf FreeSurfer framework (Hagler et al., 2006). The Fourier-transformed data were
then sampled onto the individual cortical surface. Using this statistical threshold, we cut
a label containing all vertices that showed a significant periodic response to finger
stimulation (see one example in Figure 7A) and was localised within S1 (i.e. within the
boundaries of areas 3a, 3b and 1, as estimated by the cortical parcellation tools
implemented in Freesurfer). This label, or region of interest (ROI), is used as the input
for the analyses described in the next sections. The phase-encoded stimulation
procedure that we used is designed to map the hand region across fingers, not within
fingers (Sanchez-Panchuelo et al., 2012). Therefore, we could not derive accurate ROIs
for each finger in isolation. This is because voxels that are activated by more than one
finger are masked out. Furthermore, we did not derive ROIs for the different subdivisions
of S1 because a precise and reliable parcellation of the cortical surface at single-subject
level would require microstructural imaging.
In a few cases, we could not identify any ROI with a response to fingertip stimulation (no
response to either fingertip stimulation), even at uncorrected p < 0.05: subject #3, right
hemisphere (patient with right CRPS); subject #20, left hemisphere (right CRPS); subject
#24, left hemisphere (right CRPS); subject #28, left hemisphere (left CRPS); subject
#29, right hemisphere (left CRPS). These cases were excluded from further analysis.
Evaluation of hand map area. We calculated the surface area of the left- and righthand maps, from each participant ROI. This was done after resampling the phase maps
onto the original average brain volume, to control for inter-individual variability in brain
size. In order to increase statistical power, we pooled data from the two CRPS groups
and compared map area in the affected vs unaffected sides with both a frequentist and a
Bayesian mixed-effects ANOVAs with a within-subject factor ‘side’ (2-levels: affected,
unaffected) and a between-subjects factor ‘group’ (2-levels: controls, CRPS). In the
CRPS group, we tested whether the area of the maps of the affected and unaffected
hands could be explained using Bayesian linear regression models by the following
variables: (1) CRPS duration; (2) the severity of upper limb disability as measured by the
QuickDash score; (3) pain intensity rating collected during the imaging session; (4) a
severity score derived from the difference of PPT thresholds in the two hands as follows:
(1)

PPseverity = [ (PPTunaffected hand – PPTaffected hand) / PPTunaffected hand ] 100
Evaluation of hand map location. We controlled for individual differences in brain
morphology as follows. We first inflated each participant’s cortical surface to a sphere
and then non-linearly morphed it into alignment with an average spherical cortical
surface using FreeSurfer’s tool mri_surf2surf (Fischl et al., 1999). This procedure

maximizes alignment between sulci (including the central sulcus), while minimizing
metric distortions across the surface. We resampled phase maps onto this average
spherical surface (Freesurfer’s fsaverage) and calculated the location of the centroid of
the map on this average surface. We investigated whether the map centroid was
different across sides and groups, in two ways.
First, we tested whether the distribution of spherical coordinates was different across
conditions (‘side’ and ‘group’). As a basis for this comparison, we used the Fisher
probability density function (Fisher, 1953), which is the spherical coordinate system
analogue of the Gaussian probability density function. This approach has been
commonly used in the field of paleomagnetism and has also been applied for the
analysis of direction data from diffusion tensor imaging (Hutchinson et al., 2012). We
calculated the F statistics for the null hypothesis that sample observations from two
groups are taken from the same population. The following equation was derived from
Watson (Watson, 1956; Hutchinson et al., 2012) and used to compare two groups with
N1 and N2 observed unit vectors and resultant vectors of length R1 and R2 respectively:

where N= N1 + N2 and R is the length of the resultant vector for the pooled direction
vector observations from both groups. The resultant vector sums of all observations, R 1,
R2, and R, are calculated as follows:

where xi, yi, zi are the coordinates of the map centroids for each participant.
We performed the following F contrasts, separately for each hemisphere: controls vs
patients with right CRPS and controls vs patients with left CRPS (four F tests in total).
The larger the value of F, the more different the two group mean directions. A p-value
was obtained using the appropriate degrees of freedom (2 and 2(N-2), respectively) and
critical probability level of 0.05. The F statistics for H0 (no difference) and H1 was used to
calculate the BF for each contrast, as follows (Held and Ott, 2018, equation 5):

concavity of the central sulcus (displayed in Figure 6C). Geodesic distances were
statistically compared using both a frequentist and a Bayesian mixed-effects ANOVA
with a within-subject factor ‘side’ (2-levels: affected, unaffected) and a between-subjects
factor ‘group’ (2-levels: controls, CRPS).
Note that we did not estimate the centroid of each finger representation because our
mapping method is not designed to reveal independent representations of individual
fingers, given that each finger is stimulated in succession. Future studies are required to
investigate finger-specific representations in CRPS.
Evaluation of hand map geometry. As a measure of the functional geometry of the
map, we measured the spatial arrangement (i.e. direction) of the spatial gradients of the
map. As illustrated in Figure 7A, the hand map exhibits a typical spatial gradient from
index finger to little finger. For each participant, we resampled the map ROIs from the
inflated cortical surface of each participant onto a flattened, two-dimensional, surface
patch. After sampling the complex-valued 3D phase-mapping data to the folded surface,
we displayed it on a small flattened, 2D surface patch, which minimizes deviations from
original geometry. We gently smoothed the complex values on the surface using a 1.5
mm kernel and then converted the complex-valued data (real, imaginary) to amplitude
and phase angle. The 2D gradient of the phase angle was computed after fitting a plane
to the data from the surrounding vertices (taking care to circularly subtract the angular
data). The amplitude of the gradient at each vertex was then normalized for display.
The mean direction of map gradients is not informative because each participant cortical
patch has an arbitrary direction. However, the spread (or variability) of map gradients is
informative, because it doesn’t depend on the orientation of the cortical surface patch;
higher variability of gradient directions indicates that the map phases are more spread
and less spatially organized. Therefore, we investigated whether the functional geometry
of the map is affected by CRPS, by testing whether the gradient directions of the map of
the affected hand were more variable than those of the unaffected hand and controls. As
a measure of map gradient variability, we calculated the circular variance of the gradient
angles of each ROI. We conducted a Harrison-Kanji test (Harrison and Kanji, 1988;
Berens, 2009) on the gradient variances to statistically compare the variability of map
gradients across groups and participants. This test allowed us to perform a two-factor
ANOVA for circular data, with a within-subject factor ‘side’ (2-levels: affected, unaffected)
and a between-subjects factor ‘group’ (2-levels: controls, CRPS). BFs for each contrast
were calculated as described by equation 4 (the probability level for H0 was 0.05).
We tested the hypothesis that there was a relation between map gradient variability and
disease duration, using the equation for circular-linear correlation (rcl) described in (Zar,
1999: equation 27.47). A p-value for rcl is computed by considering the test statistic N rcl ,
which follows a χ2 distribution with two degrees of freedom (Berens, 2009). BFs based
on the χ2 distribution were calculated following equation 4 (with 0.05 probability level for
H0).

Cross-subject average (for illustration). We averaged maps across subjects purely for
illustration. All statistical analyses were performed on measures derived from the
individual-subjects maps. We first inflated each participant’s cortical surface to a sphere,
and then non-linearly morphed it into alignment with an average spherical cortical
surface using FreeSurfer’s tool mri_surf2surf (Fischl et al., 1999). This procedure
maximizes alignment between sulci (including the central sulcus), while minimizing
metric distortions across the surface. Four steps of nearest-neighbour smoothing (<1.5
mm FWHM in 2D) were applied to the data after resampling on the spherical surface.
Complex-valued mapping signals were then combined across all subjects
(independently of whether the S1 map was detected or not) on a vertex-by-vertex basis
by vector averaging (Mancini et al., 2012). The amplitude was normalized to 1, which
prevented overrepresenting subjects with strong amplitudes. Finally, a scalar crosssubject F-ratio was calculated from the complex data and rendered back onto
‘fsaverage’ (uncorrected, p < 0.05).

Results
Demographics and sensitivity to pain
Table 1 reports the demographic and clinical information of the study sample (Healthy
controls: n = 17; CRPS to the left hand: n = 8; CRPS to the right hand: n = 10). Age was
similar in the control group (mean ± SD, 44.9 ± 12.0 years) and in the patients (44.2 ±
11.3; independent samples t-test: t33 = 0.19, p = 0.856, BF10 = 0.329). Handedness was
evaluated using the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory, which yields a laterality score that
ranges from -100 (left-hand dominant) to +100 (right-hand dominant) (Oldfield, 1971).
This laterality score was comparable in controls (73.6 ± 49.8) and patients (61.6 ± 58.1;
independent samples t-test: t33 = 0.65, p = 0.518, BF10 = 0.384). Age of patients was
similar to those found in the UK CRPS Registry (Shenker et al., 2015): mean age at
onset was 43 ± 12.7 years (n = 239), whereas mean pain duration was 2.9 years (n =
237) was slightly shorter in the UK CRPS registry.
As expected, CRPS patients were more sensitive to pressure, with lower average pain
pressure threshold (PPT) on their affected hand (3.4 ± 3.8) than on their unaffected hand
(7.6 ± 11.0; paired samples t-test: t17 = -2.21, p = 0.041, BF10 = 1.679). Confirming that
the CRPS was unilateral, PPTs on the unaffected hand of CRPS patients were similar to
those of controls (average left and right hand of controls ± SD, 10.7 ± 14.9; independent
samples t-test: t33 = 0.72, p = 0.476, BF10 = 0.398). Ratings of spontaneous pain did not

vary in a consistent fashion before and after the imaging session (mean difference ± SD,
0.6 ± 2.5; t16 = 0.96, p = 0.351, BF10 = 0.281).
Somatotopic representation of the hand in S1
We stimulated the tips of each finger in succession, as shown in Figure 2A, using a
mechanical probe. Mechanical stimulation to the fingertips elicited a periodic response in
the hand region of S1 (Figure 2B). A selection of single-subjects maps is shown in
Figure 3 and the average maps are displayed in Figure 4. The map phase angle
(indicating finger preference) is displayed using a continuous colour scale (red to green
to blue to yellow), the saturation of which is masked by the statistical threshold. All
analyses were performed on individual subject data (cluster-corrected at p < 0.01), but
uncorrected group maps (p < 0.05) are displayed in Figure 4 merely for illustration.
Phases corresponding to rest (no stimulation) have been truncated. The map showed a
clear spatial gradient of digit preference, progressing from d2 (index finger) to d3, d4 and
d5 (little finger). The arrangement and location of the map was qualitatively similar to
that reported in previous human fMRI studies (Sanchez-Panchuelo et al., 2010; Mancini
et al., 2012; Besle et al., 2013; Martuzzi et al., 2014; Kolasinski et al., 2016a).
We tested whether the area, location, and functional geometry of the map of the affected
hand was similar to those of the unaffected hand and controls. To do so, we defined
individual ROIs as clusters located in S1 that showed a significant periodic response at
the spatial frequency of stimulation (cluster-corrected, p < 0.01).
1. Map area
To control for inter-individual variability in brain size, we resampled the phase maps onto
the original average brain volume. We then calculated the surface area of the left- and
right-hand maps from each participant ROI. In order to increase statistical power, we
flipped the data from the right hand CRPS group so that the affected side became the
left hand/right hemisphere in all patients and then pooled these data. As evident in
Figure 5A, the map area was comparable among groups and sides. A mixed-effects
ANOVA with a within-subject factor ‘side’ (2-levels: affected, unaffected) and a betweensubjects factor ‘group’ (2-levels: controls, CRPS) did not provide evidence for any main
effect or interaction (‘side’: F1,28 = 0.281, p = 0.60, p 2 = 0.010; ‘group’: F1,28 = 1.555, p =
0.223, p 2 = 0.053; ‘side’ by ‘group’: F1,28 = 0.315, p = 0.579, p 2 = 0.011). A Bayesian
mixed-effects ANOVA provided the stronger evidence for the null model (BF10 = 1,
P(M|data) = 0.492) relative to models of ‘group’ (BF10 = 0.512, P(M|data) = 0.252), ‘side’
(BF10 = 0.305, P(M|data) = 0.150), ‘side+group’ (BF10 = 0.153, P(M|data) = 0.075),
‘side+group+interaction’ (BF10 = 0.126, P(M|data) = 0.030).

Relation with disease duration
We checked whether there was any relationship between map size and duration of
disease. As the distribution of disease duration values was skewed towards small
values, disease duration data were first transformed onto natural logarithms. The log-

transformed disease duration was normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk test = 0.94, p =
0.293; skewness = -0.002 ± 0.536). A Bayesian linear regression showed stronger
evidence for a model in which the area of the map covaried with (log-transformed)
disease duration BF10 = 3.016, P(M|data) = 0.030) than for the null model (BF10 = 1,
P(M|data) = 0.249): in participants that suffered from CRPS for a longer time had a
smaller map of the affected hand.
1.2.
Relation with upper limb disability
Disease duration did not correlate with the severity of disability of the CRPS limb, as
measured by the QuickDash score (Pearson’s r = 0.002, BF10 = 0.291). In patients, the
QuickDash score did not predict the area of the map of the affected hand in a Bayesian
linear regression analysis (null model: BF10 = 1, P(M|data) = 0.620; disability model: BF10
= 0.614, P(M|data) = 0.380).
1.3.
Relation with pain intensity
We found no evidence for a linear relation between the area of the map of the affected
hand and pain intensity ratings obtained during the imaging session (ratings for each
subject are reported in Table 1). The null model (BF10 = 1, P(M|data) = 0.685) won over
a model in which the area of the map of the affected hand linearly covaried with pain
intensity ratings (BF10 = 0.460, P(M|data) = 0.315). Moreover, there was no evidence for
a relation between the area of the map of the affected hand and a score of pain severity
derived from PPTs (PPseverity). A Bayesian linear regression showed that the null model
(BF10 = 1, P(M|data) = 0.510) and a model with PPseverity (BF10 = 0.960, P(M|data) =
0.490) were similarly likely. In our sample, disease duration did not correlate with either
pain intensity ratings collected during the imaging session (Pearson’s r = 0.249, BF 10 =
0.463) or with PPseverity (Pearson’s r = -0.108, BF10 = 0.317)
Finally, the area of the map of the unaffected hand was not explained by CRPS duration,
pain intensity rating, or PPseverity (all BF10 for null models = 1; all BF10 for alternative
models < 0.6).
In summary, these analyses do not provide support for the hypothesis that the map of
the CRPS hand was smaller than the map of the unaffected hand and that of healthy
controls, at group level. However, we found evidence that the map area of the CRPS
hand was modulated by disease duration, across participants. The more chronic was the
disease, the smaller was the map of the affected hand. Map area was not predicted by
various measures of pain severity and upper limb disability.
2. Map location
We calculated the centroid of the hand map, after resampling it onto an average
spherical surface (see “Evaluation of hand map location” for details). This was done to
control for individual differences in brain morphology and to obtain localisation measures
that were not confounded by gyrification. Figure 6A-B shows the distribution of map
centroids of each participant, resampled onto a canonical spherical cortical surface of an

average brain; the map centroid location was variable among participants of each group,
but visibly similar across groups. Indeed, the F-statistics based on the Fisher probability
density function (Fisher, 1953) did not provide evidence for any directional difference
between groups for either side (Table 2).
As a further comparison of the locations of map centroids across groups, we computed
the geodesic distance, in mm, between the map centroid and an arbitrary reference point
located within the concavity of the central sulcus (Figure 6C). Importantly, geodesic
distance measures calculated onto average spherical surfaces are not confounded by
gyrification and allow comparison of different subjects. This is a key advantage of our
approach over previous studies which measured Euclidean distances between two
finger representations. A mixed-effects ANOVA with a within-subject factor ‘side’ and a
between-subjects factor ‘group’ did not provide evidence for any main effect or
interaction (‘side’: F1,28 < 0.01, p = 0.999, p 2 < 0.001; ‘group’: F1,28 = 0.163, p = 0.689,
2
= 0.006; ‘side’ by ‘group’: F1,28 = 0.254, p = 0.619, p 2 = 0.009). In a Bayesian mixedp
effects ANOVA, the null model had stronger evidence (BF10 = 1, P(M|data) = 0.581)
relative to models of ‘group’ (BF10 = 0.340, P(M|data) = 0.198), ‘side’ (BF10 = 0.262,
P(M|data) = 0.152), ‘side+group’ (BF10 = 0.087, P(M|data) = 0.051),
‘side+group+interaction’ (BF10 = 0.032, P(M|data) = 0.019).
Altogether, these analyses indicate that the location of the hand map centroid was not
affected by CRPS.
3. Map geometry
Finally, we evaluated the variability of the geometry of the map of the affected hand in
CRPS patients. As illustrated in Figure 7A, the hand map exhibits a typical spatial
gradient from index finger to little finger. The spatial gradient (i.e. the direction) of the
map indicates the spatial progression of the map phases, providing a measure of the
map geometry. We investigated whether the gradient directions of the map of the
affected hand were more variable than those of the unaffected hand and controls. As a
measure of map gradient variability, we calculated the circular variance of the gradient
angles of each flattened, two-dimensional, surface ROI (see “Evaluation of hand map
geometry” for details).
The gradient directions of the map of the affected hand were not differently variable (i.e.
not differently spread) from those of the unaffected hand and controls (Figure 7B). A
Harrison-Kanji test with a within-subject factor ‘side’ and a between-subjects factor
‘group’ on the gradient variances provided evidence for a main effect of side (F1,59 =
4.813, p = 0.032, p 2 = 0.079, BF10 = 1.202) and no evidence for a main effect of group
(F1,59 = 2.243, p = 0.140, p 2 = 0.038, BF10 = 0.560). We found weak and inconclusive
evidence for an interaction between side and group (F1,59 = 3.889, p = 0.071, p 2 =
0.057, BF10 = 0.971). This suggests that the spread of map gradients, which is a
measure of functional organization, was largely similar across groups.

Lastly, we tested whether there was a circular-linear correlation (rcl) between map
gradient variability and disease duration. This analysis did not provide evidence for a
relation between the (log-transformed) disease duration and the gradient variability of
either the affected hand map (rcl = 0.395, p = 0.310, BF10 = 0.066) or the unaffected
hand map (rcl = 0.197, p = 0.734, BF10 = 0.034).

Discussion
We show that the cortical map of the fingertips of the CRPS hand in S1 is strikingly
comparable to the map of the unaffected hand and controls in terms of area, location,
orientation, and geometry. Although the area of the map of the affected hand was
comparable to that of the unaffected hand and controls, it was modulated by disease
duration, but not by pain intensity, pain sensitivity and upper limb disability: across
participants, the longer was the duration of CRPS, the smaller was the area of the map
of the CRPS hand. Our results do not exclude that other abnormalities may occur at S1
level, such as excitability changes (Lenz et al., 2011; Di Pietro et al., 2013),
morphological (Baliki et al., 2011; Pleger et al., 2014; cfr. van Velzen et al., 2016) and
connectivity changes (Geha et al., 2008). However, our findings challenge or, at the very
least, narrow the notion of S1 map reorganization in CRPS: if any map reorganization
occurs, it does not appear to be directly related to pain.
These findings urge us to reconsider the mechanisms that are proposed to underpin
CRPS (Marinus et al., 2011). They also compel us to revaluate the rationale for (and
mechanism of effect of) clinical interventions that aimed to reduce pain by “restoring”
somatotopic representations with sensory discrimination training (Moseley et al., 2008b;
Catley et al., 2014), or by correcting sensorimotor incongruences (which are thought to
be induced by S1 reorganisation) with mirror therapy (McCabe et al., 2003) (but see
Moseley and Gandevia, 2005; Moseley et al., 2008b). Although these interventions
appear to offer clinical benefit (O'Connell et al., 2013), they are unlikely to engender a
“restoration” of somatotopic representations in S1, which are largely comparable to
those of controls.
Revisiting previous evidence of somatotopic reorganisation in CRPS
Comparisons across different studies are inevitably challenging due to the complexity
and variety of CRPS symptomatology; in previous studies, patients varied greatly in
regard to the combination, severity and duration of their symptoms. Our study suggests
that map size is probably related with disease duration, although only a longitudinal
study could confirm a causal relationship.
There are also important methodological issues to consider. The notion of somatotopic
reorganisation in CRPS was mostly based on studies that used imaging methods
(EEG/MEG) with lower spatial resolution than fMRI (Juottonen et al., 2002; Maihofner et

al., 2003; Pleger et al., 2004; Vartiainen et al., 2008; Vartiainen et al., 2009). A more
recent study used fMRI and measured the cortical distance between d1 and d5
activation peaks (Di Pietro et al., 2015). This study partially confirmed former EEG/MEG
findings, reporting that the d1-d5 distance in S1 was smaller for the affected hand than it
was for the unaffected hand in CRPS patients. However, the representation of the
affected hand was comparable to that of healthy controls, in agreement with the current
results. Critically, the Di Pietro study (2015) found that the representation of the
unaffected hand in CRPS patients was larger than that of controls, thus challenging the
view that the representation of the affected hand is shrunk and suggesting that the
representation of the unaffected hand is actually enlarged. The current results do not
support either interpretation.
Three important limitations affect all previous studies, regardless of the imaging
approach used. First, the approach taken to estimate map size is both indirect and
incomplete, because it is based on the measurement of the Euclidean distance between
the activation maxima of two fingers (d1 and d5). Instead, the area of the map of all
fingers is a more direct and complete measure of map size. Second, Euclidean
measures of cortical distances can be inaccurate because they disregard that the
cortical surface is not flat, especially in the regions of the sulci. Third, Euclidean distance
measures can be affected by non-topographical, structural changes in SI, which can be
associated with CRPS (Baliki et al., 2011; Pleger et al., 2014). The latter two problems
can be overcome by morphing activation maps onto a reconstruction of the flattened
cortical surface (Makin et al., 2013a; Kikkert et al., 2016), but previous studies on CRPS
patients have not taken this approach. Altogether, these methodological issues can
affect both the accuracy and validity of previous measures of map extent.

Stability of cortical topographies
Recent fMRI studies (Makin et al., 2013a; Kikkert et al., 2016) suggest that finger
topographies in S1 are surprisingly persistent even in humans who suffered amputation
of the upper-limb. It was demonstrated that the area, location and functional organisation
of the S1 maps of the missing hand were similar, although noisier, to those observed in
controls during finger movements (Makin et al., 2013a; Kikkert et al., 2016). It has also
been shown that the deafferented territory in human S1 can respond to somatotopically
adjacent body regions (i.e. the lip for upper limb amputees) (Flor et al., 1995; Flor,
2008), or to body regions that the amputees overuse to supplement lost hand function
(e.g. the intact hand). This results in a highly idiosyncratic remapping which does not
necessarily involve adjacent representations in S1 (Makin et al., 2013b; Philip and Frey,
2014). Thus, cortical reorganisation in amputees is not dictated by cortical topographies,
but can depend on compensatory use of other body parts. Similarly, short-term shifts in
S1 maps can occur in healthy participants after surgical gluing of the index and middle
fingers for 24 hours. These changes are thought to depend on compensatory use of the
fourth and fifth fingers (Kolasinski et al., 2016b). These studies support the view that any

S1 change previously reported in CRPS patients might not directly related to pain, but it
remains to be determined why map shrinkage relates to disease duration. Could it be
related to hand use? We found no relation between map size and severity of the upper
limb disability.
Recent evidence from electrophysiological and inactivation studies in monkeys suggests
that the reorganisation following nerve transection originates, not in S1, but in the
brainstem. Indeed, inactivating the cuneate nucleus abolishes the neural activity in the
deafferented limb representation in S1 elicited by face stimulation (Kambi et al., 2014).
Hence, loss of input from a body region in adulthood may lead to the formation or
potentiation of lateral connections in the brainstem, which gives rise to a new pathway
from periphery to cortex. It is not clear whether this new pathway contributes to cortical
reorganisation, but the original pathway seems to be relatively spared even under the
extreme circumstance of limb amputation (Makin and Bensmaia, 2017).
Some resistance to change has also been described for visual retinotopic maps.
Although it has been shown that large lesions to the retina in adult mammals can induce
a reorganization of retinotopic cortical maps in primary visual cortex (Kaas et al., 1990),
more recent studies have reported that the topography of the macaque primary visual
cortex does not change (for at least seven months) following binocular retinal lesions
(Smirnakis et al., 2005). Similarly, severe eye diseases such as retinal degeneration do
not seem to affect retinotopic representations in the human early visual cortex (Xie et al.,
2012; Haak et al., 2016). Altogether, these findings suggest that cortical topography is
more stable and resistant to change than what it was initially thought.

Conclusion and future directions
Our study provides the most complete characterization, to date, of the S1 somatotopy of
the CRPS hand. We report that the S1 representation of the CRPS hand is comparable,
at the group level, to that of the healthy hand, in terms of cortical area, location and
geometry. The area of the S1 map of the CRPS hand is related to disease duration but
not to pain intensity, pain sensitivity and upper limb disability. Future longitudinal studies
are required to determine how the map changes over time and its effect on sensorimotor
function.

Figure 1. Preliminary results that guided the design of the finger mapping protocol. (A)
Comparable somatotopic representation in the contralateral S1 to unilateral and bilateral
finger stimulation, at within-subject level. The map of the fingertips (d2-d5) in
contralateral S1 was strikingly similar in a condition in which we stimulated the fingertips
of one hand at time and in another condition whereby we stroked homologous fingertips
of both hands simultaneously. (B) Bootstrapping validation. We validated the results
shown in panel A using a bootstrapping approach. Seven functional runs per condition

(unilateral stimulation, bilateral stimulation) were collected in a single participant, in
multiple scanning sessions. We selected, both recursively and randomly, 4 runs among
the 7 collected per condition and averaged results across these 4 runs to assess intraindividual map reproducibility. The maps of the fingertips were highly reproducible in
both unilateral and bilateral stimulation conditions. (C) Time course of activity in the left
hemisphere during unilateral fingertip stimulation. Panel C shows the percent modulation
of BOLD response in the left S1 induced by periodic stimulation of the fingertips of the
right hand and left hand. We did not observed a spatially-tuned activation of the left S1
induced by left-hand stimulation.
Figure 2. (A) Phase-encoded stimulation procedure. The tip of the index finger (red, d2),
middle finger (green, d3), ring finger (blue, d4), little finger (yellow, d5) were stimulated in
succession, in repeated cycles (12 cycles per run). To reduce scanning time, the
homologous fingers of the right and left hands were stimulated simultaneously. (B)
Illustrative phase-encoded response to periodic fingertip stimulation. The figure shows
the raw Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent (BOLD) response in four voxels of interest (thin
lines; data were motion-corrected and the linear trend removed). The locations of the
voxels are marked with a star on the cortical surface of the left primary somatosensory
cortex of one participant. The thicker lines represent the average of the raw BOLD
response across 12 cycles of stimulation. The transversal, dashed, white line is
displayed to facilitate the visualization of the shift of the phase of the BOLD response
across the four voxels. The F-statistics of the signal at different phases are rendered on
the inflated cortical surface and color-coded as in panel A (cluster-corrected p < 0.01).
Phases corresponding to rest have been truncated.
Figure 3. Phase maps of the hand in an illustrative control participant and three CRPS
patients. The color-coding scheme used is shown on the top of the figure and is the
same as in Figure 1: red = d2, green = d3, blue = d4, yellow = d5. Phases corresponding
to rest have been truncated. Statistical thresholding and cluster correction at p < 0.01
was applied to each individual-participant data. CS: central sulcus. The star symbol
denotates the map of the CRPS hand.
Figure 4. Surface-based average of phase maps in controls, patients with CRPS to the
right hand, and patients with CRPS to the left hand. The complex-valued mapping data
were averaged in a spherical surface coordinate system after morphing each subject's
data into alignment with an average spherical sulcal pattern, and the F-statistics were
rendered back onto an average unfolded cortical surface (Freesurfer’s fsaverage,
‘inflated_average’; uncorrected p < 0.05 only for illustration). The color-coding scheme
used is shown on the top of the figure and is the same as in Figures 1-2: red = d2, green
= d3, blue = d4, yellow = d5. Phases corresponding to rest have been truncated. CS:
central sulcus; PoCS: post-central sulcus.

CRPS) were pooled, after flipping the data from one group (right hand CRPS) so that the
affected side is the left hand/right hemisphere in all patients. (B) No relation between
map area and CRPS duration. The top plot shows the lack of relation between the S1
map of the healthy hand and CRPS duration, whereas the bottom plot shows the weak
(not significant) relation between the S1 map of the affected hand and disease duration.

hand map in each individual subject is displayed on an average spherical cortical
surface. An arbitrary reference point on the central sulcus is marked with a white cross.
(C) Geodesic distance (mm) between each map centroid and a reference point (‘+’) on
the central sulcus. To facilitate comparison, data from the two CRPS groups (right hand
CRPS, left hand CRPS) were pooled, after flipping the data from one group (right hand
CRPS) so that the affected side is the left hand/right hemisphere in all patients.
Figure 7. (A) Gradients of the hand map. Gradients of a single-subject phase map are
displayed as cyan arrows over a flattened (2D) cortical surface patch. The gradient
points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of the function (i.e. the direction of
the phase shift in the hand map). The color-coding scheme of the hand map is the same
as in Figures 1-3: red = d2, green = d3, blue = d4, yellow = d5. (B) Variability of hand
map gradients. The circular variance of map gradient directions is displayed for each
participant and condition (side: left hemisphere, right hemisphere; group: controls, CRPS
patients). The color-coding scheme for panel B is shown at the bottom of the figure. To
facilitate comparison, data from the two CRPS groups (right hand CRPS, left hand
CRPS) were pooled, after flipping the data from one group (right hand CRPS) so that the
affected side is the left hand/right hemisphere in all patients.

Table 1. Demographic and clinical information of the study sample.
Range of motion, motor weakness, tremor, allodynia: ‘-‘ indicates no abnormality, whereas ‘+’ indicates presence of a symptom. Intensity of
pain to the upper limb during scans were evaluated on a Likert scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). PPT indicates the Pressure
Pain threshold and is reported in kg/cm2 units. The laterality score is derived from the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory and ranges from -100
(left-hand dominant) to +100 (right-hand dominant).
