Abstract
Current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are losing efficacy against emerging variants and may
not protect against future novel coronavirus outbreaks, emphasizing the need for more
broadly protective vaccines. To inform the development of a pan-coronavirus vaccine,
we investigated the presence and specificity of cross-reactive antibodies against the
spike (S) proteins of human coronaviruses (hCoV) after SARS-CoV-2 infection and
vaccination. We found an 11 to 123-fold increase in antibodies binding to SARS-CoV
and MERS-CoV as well as a 2 to 4-fold difference in antibodies binding to seasonal
hCoVs in COVID-19 convalescent sera compared to pre-pandemic healthy donors,
with the S2 subdomain of the S protein being the main target for cross-reactivity. In
addition, we detected cross-reactive antibodies to all hCoV S proteins after SARSCoV-2 S protein immunization in macaques, with higher responses for hCoV more
closely related to SARS-CoV-2. These findings support the feasibility of and provide
guidance for development of a pan-coronavirus vaccine.

Introduction
One and a half year after the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID19), the pandemic is still a major global issue with unprecedented consequences on
healthcare systems and economies. Following the rapid initiation of many COVID-19
vaccine studies, the first vaccines are already FDA/EMA approved and mass
vaccination campaigns are rolled out to hopefully soon subdue this pandemic1–4.
However, these vaccines might have reduced efficacy against emerging SARS-CoV2 variants, as was already shown for several approved vaccines when tested for safety
and effectiveness against the B1.351 (501Y.V2) SARS-CoV-2 variant which is
currently dominating the epidemic in South Africa5,6,7. To anticipate emerging variants,
more broadly protective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are desirable. However, the ultimate
goal should be a pan-coronavirus vaccine, which would be able to induce broad
immunity and protection against multiple coronaviruses, thereby preparing us for
future outbreaks.
New coronaviruses that infect humans (hCoVs) emerge frequently and SARS-CoV-2
is the fifth to be discovered in less than two decades, bringing the total up to seven8.
These include the seasonal betacoronaviruses hCoV-OC43 and hCoV-HKU1 as well
as alphacoronaviruses hCoV-NL63 and hCoV-229E, which usually cause mild
respiratory symptoms and account for approximately 5-30% of common colds during
the winter season9,10. In contrast, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV
and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV are far more pathogenic and
led to epidemics in 2003 and 2013-2015, respectively11,12. The currently circulating
SARS-CoV-2 is less pathogenic compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, resulting
in mild flu-like symptoms in the majority of patients, while only a small group of patients
develop (bilateral) pneumonia which can rapidly deteriorate in severe acute respiratory
distress syndrome13. Despite the lower pathogenicity compared to SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV, the high infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 results in large numbers of
hospitalizations and deaths worldwide.
The majority of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are based on the Spike (S) glycoprotein, a
homotrimeric glycoprotein that is present on the surface of all coronaviruses and is the
main target of protective antibodies. The S protein plays a pivotal role in viral entry and

consists of an S1 subdomain including the receptor binding domain (RBD) and an S2
subdomain containing the fusion peptide14,15. The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is most
closely related to the S protein of SARS-CoV (~75% amino acid sequence identity),
shows less similarity to MERS-CoV S protein (~50% identity) and is more distinct from
the S proteins of the seasonal hCoVs (~25-30% identity)16,17. Although this sequence
identity is considered low from the perspective of eliciting cross-reactive antibodies by
vaccination, several studies observed cross-reactivity of COVID-19 sera against other
hCoVs18–22. In addition, the isolation and engineering of broader hCoV monoclonal
antibodies has been reported23–25.
In this study, we identify broad hCoV antibody responses following SARS-CoV-2
infection and vaccination. We identify the S2 subdomain as a prominent target for
cross-reactive antibodies and demonstrate that cynomolgus macaques vaccinated
with a SARS-CoV-2 S protein nanoparticle vaccine elicit detectable antibody
responses to other hCoVs. These results will guide the development of a pancoronavirus vaccine.
Results
Convalescent COVID-19 sera contain robust IgG responses to the SARS-CoV-2
S protein
Sera from 50 PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, aged 22 to 75 years, who
suffered from a range of COVID-19 disease severities were obtained 4-6 weeks after
symptom onset (Supplementary Table 1). A custom Luminex assay was used to
measure IgG antibody levels to the pre-fusion stabilized trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike
(S) protein in these convalescent COVID-19 sera and compared to pre-pandemic
healthy donor sera.

Sera from convalescent COVID-19 patients showed 990-fold higher antibody levels to
SARS-CoV-2 S protein compared to pre-pandemic healthy donor sera (median 3.8
log10 vs. 0.8 log10 Median Fluorescent Intensity (MFI), p<0.0001) (Fig. 1a). This is in
line with a positive serological response in all but one of the participants using the
commercially available WANTAI SARS-CoV-2 RBD total Immunoglobulin serum
ELISA (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). When subdividing the convalescent

patients based on admission status, 4-fold higher antibody levels were observed for
hospitalized patients compared to non-hospitalized patients (median 4.1 log10 vs. 3.5
log10 MFI, p<0.0001). SARS-CoV-2 neutralization capacity was also significantly
higher (5-fold) in hospitalized patients (3.6 log10 vs. 2.9 log10 MFI, p<0.0001) and
antibody levels and neutralization capacity were strongly correlated in all patients
(Spearman r = 0.735, p<0.0001) (Fig. 1b). An 8-fold higher antibody response to the
SARS-CoV-2 S protein was observed in the oldest age group of COVID-19 patients
(age > 60) compared to the youngest age group (age < 35) (4.1 log10 vs. 3.2 log10 MFI,
p<0.001), which is in line with age being a risk factor for severe COVID-19 (Fig. 1a)26.
No difference in antibody levels was observed between sex (p=0.71 Mann-Whitney U
test). These findings were confirmed with a principal component analysis, which
showed two distinct groups based on hospital admission status, and indicated age as
an important contributing variable (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 1). Overall, these
results are consistent with previous studies27,28,29.

Convalescent COVID-19 sera are cross-reactive with all hCoV S proteins
Next, we measured IgG binding to the S proteins of other hCoVs: SARS-CoV, MERSCoV, hCoV-OC43, hCoV-HKU1, hCoV-229E and hCoV-NL63. We found significantly
higher levels of antibodies binding to all hCoV S proteins in convalescent COVID-19
sera compared to pre-pandemic healthy donor sera, with the largest difference for
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S protein (123 and 11-fold difference between medians,
respectively) (Fig. 2a). For the circulating seasonal hCoVs, a 2 to 4-fold difference in
median levels of antibodies binding to the S proteins was observed; hCoV-OC43 (4.2fold, p<0.0001), hCoV-HKU1 (4.3-fold, p<0.0001), hCoV-229E (3.8-fold, p<0.0001)
and hCoV-NL63 (1.8-fold, p<0.01). No such difference was found for the control
protein Tetanus toxoid (0.8-fold, p=0.85) (Supplementary Fig. 2a).

To further explore the specificity of the cross-reactive antibodies in convalescent
COVID-19 sera, we performed a depletion with soluble SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Fig.
2b and Supplementary Fig. 3). Depletion of convalescent COVID-19 sera resulted in
a 92% reduction of antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. The reduction
of antibodies binding to the other hCoV S proteins was strongest for SARS-CoV (61%
mean reduction) and MERS-CoV (25%). A more modest reduction of signal was

observed for hCoV-OC43 (13% mean reduction) and hCoV-229E S protein (6%) and
we observed no depletion of antibodies binding to hCoV-HKU1 (2%) and hCoV-NL63
(-2%). On the individual level, some patients showed up to 72%, 70% and 34%
reduction of antibodies binding to hCoV-OC43, hCoV-229E and hCoV-HKU1 S protein
after depletion, respectively. No reduction in signal was observed for the control
protein Tetanus toxoid after SARS-CoV-2 S depletion (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig.
2b). Antibodies binding to other hCoV S proteins in pre-pandemic healthy donor sera
did not decrease after depletion (Supplementary Fig. 2c). These depletion
experiments corroborate the finding that convalescent COVID-19 sera contain crossreactive antibodies able to recognize other hCoV S proteins. We observed the highest
cross-reactivity for the more closely related hCoVs (Supplementary Table 3). Indeed,
the level of cross-reactivity expressed as the reduction of binding antibodies after
depletion by SARS-CoV-2 S protein was associated with the level of sequence identity
(Spearman r=0.83, p=0.06) (Supplementary Fig. 4).

To further explore the possible functionality of these cross-reactive antibodies, we
investigated the correlation between hCoV S protein binding antibodies and SARSCoV-2 neutralization titers. In addition to the observed correlation between SARSCoV-2 S protein antibody levels and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, we found a moderate
correlation between SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and antibodies binding to SARS-CoV
S protein (r = 0.545, P<0.0001), a weak correlation with antibodies that bind to MERSCoV, hCoV-HKU1 and hCoV-229E S protein (r = 0.324, 0.308, 0.320 respectively, all
p <0.05) and no correlation with antibodies binding to hCoV-OC43 and hCoV-NL63 S
protein (r = 0.188 and -0.095, p >0.05) (Supplementary Fig. 6). These correlations
suggest that cross-reactive antibodies form a minor component of the neutralizing
antibodies induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also investigated if there was an
association between cross-reactivity and disease severity with a principal component
analysis. Antibodies binding to other hCoV S proteins did not contribute to the
separation between patients based on admission status as clearly as was seen for
SARS-CoV-2 S protein antibody levels, suggesting a limited impact of cross-reactive
antibodies on disease severity (Supplementary Fig. 5).

Cross-reactive antibodies preferentially target the S2 subdomain

To determine the main target on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein for cross-reactive
antibodies, we performed a depletion experiment in which we compared the reduction
of IgG binding to hCoV S proteins after depleting the sera with soluble SARS-CoV-2
S1 or S2 subdomains. After depletion with the SARS-CoV-2 S2 subdomain, a 48%,
20% and 19% mean reduction of signal was observed for antibodies binding to SARSCoV, MERS-CoV, and hCoV-OC43 S protein, respectively, while no reduction was
observed after S1 depletion (Fig. 3). Absolute MFI values before and after depletion
are shown in Supplementary Fig. 7a. For some individuals, depletion rates reached
up to 83% for SARS-CoV, 75% for MERS-CoV and 80% for hCoV-OC43 S protein
while there were no individuals with substantial reduction of cross-reactive antibodies
after S1 depletion. We did not observe significant depletion of antibodies binding to
hCoV-HKU1 and hCoV-229E S proteins by S1 or S2 subdomains of SARS-CoV-2 at
the group level. However, in some individuals the signal was reduced by up to 59%
for hCoV-HKU1 and 71% for hCoV-229E S protein following depletion with the SARSCoV-2 S2 subdomain, while such effects were not observed after S1 subdomain
depletion. Changes in antibodies that bind to hCoV-NL63 S protein after depletion with
SARS-CoV-2 S1 and S2 subdomains were comparable to those observed with the
control protein Tetanus toxoid and to the reduction in signal for hCoV S in healthy
donors (Supplementary Fig. 3 and 7). SARS-CoV-2 S2 subdomain depletion was
significantly correlated with S2 sequence identity (r = 0.90, p = 0.03) while there was
no correlation for SARS-CoV-2 S1 subdomain depletion (r = 0.23, p = 0.67)
(Supplementary Fig. 4). These results indicate that S2-specific antibodies have a
greater contribution to cross-reactivity than S1-specific antibodies, which is in
accordance with the higher conservation of the S2 subdomain compared to the S1
subdomain (Supplementary Table 2)30.

SARS-CoV-2 S protein vaccination elicits hCoV cross-reactive antibodies in
macaques
The observed cross-reactive antibody response following natural infection with SARSCoV-2 does not reveal whether these might be de novo responses or the result of
cross-boosted pre-existing memory from previous hCoV infections. To investigate the
ability of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to induce de novo cross-reactive antibodies against
hCoVs, we investigated the serum of six cynomolgus macaques which were

vaccinated three times with pre-fusion stabilized trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S protein
coupled to I53-50 nanoparticles31. The vaccination response was studied by
comparing serum IgG binding to hCoV S proteins after three vaccinations (week 12)
to the pre-immunization baseline (week 0). We observed that all macaques developed
detectable antibodies that bind to all hCoV S proteins. Antibodies binding to SARSCoV, MERS-CoV and hCoV-OC43 S proteins were increased compared to baseline
by 3313-, 168-, and 106-fold, respectively (Fig. 4a). This cross-reactivity was already
detectable two weeks after the first immunization (Supplementary Fig. 8a). The
induction of antibodies that bind to hCoV-HKU1 and hCoV-229E S proteins was
relatively low with a 39- and 16-fold increase from baseline, respectively. Antibodies
binding to hCoV-NL63 S protein showed only a 6-fold increase from baseline and there
was no increase observed for Tetanus toxoid (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 8b and
c). All comparisons were statistically significant except for the Tetanus toxoid. Using
the SARS-CoV-2 S protein depletion assay, a 79%, 98% and 99% mean reduction of
antibodies binding to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and hCoV-OC43 S protein, respectively,
was observed (Fig. 4b). In addition, depletion also resulted in a mean reduction of
antibodies binding to proteins hCoV-229E S (92%), hCoV-HKU1 S (92%) and hCoVNL63 S (75%). Virtually no depletion (3%) was observed for the control protein
Tetanus toxoid (Supplementary Fig. 9). Together, these results demonstrate that the
SARS-CoV-2 S protein is capable of inducing cross-reactive antibodies to both alpha
and beta hCoVs, in macaques that we assume have no pre-existing hCoV immunity.

Discussion
As mass vaccination campaigns take place around the globe, there is optimism that
the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will be subdued. However, there will likely be future
challenges with emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as with entirely new hCoVs.

donors. We confirmed this cross-reactivity by showing that SARS-CoV-2 S protein
could partially deplete antibodies binding to all hCoV S proteins except hCoV-NL63 in
COVID-19 patient sera, while no effect of SARS-CoV-2 S protein depletion was
observed in healthy donor sera. Additionally, we see that the elevation of hCoV S
antibody levels and the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to deplete these antibodies
is highest for hCoV S proteins that share most sequence homology with the SARSCoV-2 S protein. Cross-reactive antibodies can be the result of de novo responses or
due to cross-boosting of pre-existing hCoV immunity. Others have shown crossreactive antibodies resulting from boosting of pre-existing immunity after natural
infection in COVID-19 patients22,35. We further explored the possibility to induce de
novo cross-reactive antibodies by vaccination in a cynomolgus macaque model.
These macaques are assumed naïve for hCoVs although infections of macaques have
been described36. Because of low baseline antibody levels, we expect no previous
exposure and therefore solely a de novo antibody response following vaccination. All
SARS-CoV-2 S protein nanoparticle immunized macaques showed detectable
antibodies binding to all hCoV S proteins which could also be depleted with SARSCoV-2 S protein. These responses after immunization with a vaccine containing a
similar pre-fusion stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S protein as many current COVID-19
vaccines, demonstrate that these narrow focused vaccines might already induce low
levels of cross-reactive antibodies. However, the strength of the response should be
an important consideration, as low levels of antibodies to viral antigens and/or the
presence of predominantly non-neutralizing antibodies could potentially lead to
Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE) of infection37. Currently, ADE has not been
reported widely for SARS-CoV-238 and for other hCoVs there is no consensus39. In
addition, it remains unclear in clinical studies if pre-existing immunity against other
hCoVs influence the severity of COVID-1918,20,35,40. In these 50 COVID-19 patients,
we did not find evidence of a clear association between the presence of cross-reactive
antibodies and COVID-19 disease severity.
As we show that most of the cross-reactivity is targeting the S2 subdomain of the S
protein, we propose that this subdomain should receive more attention in vaccine
design. Interestingly, although most neutralizing antibodies target the S1 subdomain
including the RBD, protective neutralizing antibodies targeting the S2 subdomain have
also been identified41. Furthermore, analogous to some influenza virus hemagglutinin

stem antibodies42, antibody effector functions might also contribute to protective
immunity by S2 antibodies43. Additional possibilities to improve breadth include the
use of consensus or mosaic vaccine designs similar to what has been done in HIV-1
vaccine research44,45, or the inclusion of an S2-based booster vaccine after SARSCoV-2 vaccination to amplify and broaden the response.
The results from this study on the presence and specificity of cross-reactive antibodies
to other hCoVs after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination, emphasize the feasibility
of broad coronavirus vaccines and may guide future vaccine designs.

Materials & methods
Study population
Sera of 50 SARS-CoV-2 infected adults were collected 4-6 weeks after symptom onset
through the cross-sectional COVID-19 Specific Antibodies (COSCA) study (NL
73281.018.20) as described previously46. In short, all participants had at least one
nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab positive for SARS-CoV-2 as determined by
qRT-PCR (Roche LightCycler480, targeting the Envelope-gene 113bp) and 49 of 50
participants were serological positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Wantai, WS-1096, total SARSCoV-2 RBD targeting antibodies). Patient demographics and medical history were
collected and used to score the maximum disease severity by using the WHO disease

conducted at the Amsterdam University Medical Centre, location AMC, the
Netherlands and approved by the local ethical committee (NL 73281.018.20). All
individuals provided written informed consent before participating.

Sera of 30 healthy donors were kindly provided by the Dutch Institute for Public Health
and Environment (RIVM). Sera donated in 2019 were used to exclude possible
exposure to SARS-CoV-2. No seasonal influence was observed when analyzing IgG
binding to the seasonal coronaviruses of control sera obtained at different calendar
months (data not shown).

Cynomolgus Macaques
Cynomolgus macaques (n = 6) received 50 µg of SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NP
adjuvanted with 500 µg of MPLA liposomes (Polymun Scientific, Klosterneuburg,
Austria) diluted in PBS by intramuscular route at weeks 0, 4 and 10. Blood samples
were taken at baseline and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 after vaccination. Additional
information is described by Brouwer et al. (2021)31.
Protein designs
A prefusion stabilized S protein ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV with a T4
trimerization domain and hexahistidine (His) tag were previously described46. A

prefusion stabilized S protein ectodomains construct of hCoV-HKU1 was designed as
described previously47. Specifically, a gene encoding amino acids 1-1276, in which the
furin cleavage site (amino acids 752-756) was replaced with a GGSGS sequence and
amino acids at position 1067 and 1068 were mutated to prolines, was ordered and
cloned into a pPPI4 plasmid containing a T4 trimerization domain followed by a
hexahistidine tag. The same procedure was used to generate prefusion stabilized S
proteins of MERS-CoV, hCoV-229E, hCoV-NL63, and hCoV-OC43. For the prefusion
stabilized S protein ectodomain of hCoV-229E, a gene encoding amino acids 1-1082,
with proline substitutions at positions 871 and 872, was ordered. The prefusion
stabilized S protein ectodomain construct of hCoV-NL63 consisted of amino acids 11263 and introduction of proline substitutions at positions 1052 and 1053. For MERSCoV, a gene encoding amino acids 1-1214 with proline substitutions at positions 1060
and 1061, and the furin cleavage site (amino acids 748-751) replaced with an ASVG
sequence. The prefusion stabilized S protein ectodomain construct of hCoV-OC43
was designed as described previously48. Specifically, this construct consisted of amino
acids 1-1263, which had the furin cleavage site replaced with a GGSGG sequence
and proline substitutions at positions 1070 and 1071. GenBank ID MN908947.3
(SARS-CoV-2) ABD72984.1 (SARS-CoV), AHI48550.1 (MERS-CoV), AAT84362.1

(hCoV-NL63) served as templates for the protein designs.
Protein expression and purification
The Tetanus toxoid protein was acquired from Creative Biolabs. SARS-CoV-2
Nucleocapsid protein was kindly provided by Gestur Vidarsson and Federica Linty of
Sanquin Research, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. All other proteins were produced in
HEK293F cells (Invitrogen) maintained in Freestyle medium (Life Technologies).
Transfections were performed using Polyethylenimine Hydrochloride (PEI) MAX
(Polysciences) at 1 mg/L and the expression plasmids at 312.5 µg/L in a 3:1 ratio in
50 mL OptiMEM (Gibco) per L. Supernatants were harvested seven days post
transfection by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 30 min followed by filtration of the
supernatant using 0.22 µM Steritop filter units (Merck Millipore). The His-tagged
proteins were purified from the clarified supernatant with affinity chromatography using
NiNTA agarose beads (Qiagen). Eluates were concentrated and buffer exchanged to
PBS using 100 kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) Vivaspin centrifugal

concentrators. Further purification to remove aggregated and monomeric protein
fractions was performed using Size Exclusion Chromatography on a Superose6
increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) using PBS as buffer. Trimeric S proteins
eluted at a volume of approximately 13 mL. Fractions containing trimeric protein were
pooled and concentrated using 100 kDa MWCO Vivaspin centrifugal concentrators.
Resulting protein concentrations were determined using a Nanodrop 2000
Spectrophotometer and proteins were stored at -80°C until needed.
Protein coupling to Luminex beads
Proteins were covalently coupled to Luminex Magplex beads using a two-step
carbodiimide reaction and a ratio of 75 µg protein to 12.5 million beads for SARS-CoV2 S protein. Other proteins were coupled equimolar to SARS-CoV-2 S protein.
Luminex Magplex beads (Luminex) were washed with 100 mM monobasic sodium
phosphate pH 6.2 and activated by addition of Sulfo-N-Hydroxysulfosuccinimide
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated for 30 min on a rotator at room temperature.
The activated beads were washed three times with 50 mM MES pH 5.0 and the
proteins were diluted in 50 mM MES pH 5.0 and added to the beads. The beads and
proteins were incubated for three h on a rotator at room temperature. Afterwards, the
beads were washed with PBS and blocked with PBS containing 2% BSA, 3% Fetal
calf serum and 0.02% Tween-20 at pH 7.0 for 30 min on a rotator at room temperature.
Finally, the beads were washed and stored at 4°C in PBS containing 0.05% Sodium
Azide and used within six months. Detection of the His tag on each S protein-coupled
bead was used to confirm the amount of protein on the beads.
Luminex assays
Optimization experiments determined the optimal concentration for detection of hCoV
S protein binding antibodies to be 1:10,000 dilution for COVID-19 patients, 1:50,000
for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 detection in cynomolgus macaques and 1:500 for
detection of binding antibodies to other hCoV S proteins in cynomolgus macaques. 50
µL of a working bead mixture containing 20 beads per µl of each region was incubated
overnight with 50 µl of diluted serum. Plates were sealed and incubated on a plate
shaker overnight at 4°C. The next day, plates were washed with TBS containing 0.05%
Tween-20 (TBST) using a hand-held magnetic separator. Beads were resuspended in

50 µl of Goat-anti-human IgG-PE (Southern Biotech) and incubated on a plate shaker
at room temperature for 2 h. Afterwards, the beads were washed with TBST and
resuspended in 70 µl Magpix drive fluid (Luminex). The beads were agitated for a few
min on a plate shaker at room temperature and then read-out was performed on a
Magpix (Luminex). Resulting MFI values are the median of approximately 50 beads
per well and were corrected by subtraction of MFI values from buffer and beads only
wells. A titration of serum of one convalescent COVID-19 patient as well as positive
and negative controls were included on each plate to confirm assay performance.
Assays were performed twice with similar results (Supplementary Fig. 9).
Depletion Luminex assay
Convalescent COVID-19 patient sera were diluted 1:10,000 with addition of 10 µg/mL
soluble recombinant SARS-CoV-2 pre-fusion stabilized S protein, S1 or S2 subdomain
(ABclonal Biotechnology) or without protein (as undepleted controls). Immunized
macaque sera were diluted 1:500 with addition of 30 µg/mL SARS-CoV-2 S protein.
Incubation was performed in uncoated 96-wells plates on a shaker at room
temperature for 1 h. Then, 50 µl of a working bead mixture containing 20 beads per µl
of each region was added and the plates were incubated 2 h on a shaker at room
temperature. After 2 h, the above described Luminex protocol was continued starting
with the TBST washes and the Goat-anti-human IgG-PE incubation.
SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay
The pseudovirus neutralization assay was performed as described previously31.
Briefly, HEK293T cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 were seeded in
poly-L-lysine coated 96-wells plates and the next day triplicate serial dilutions of heatinactivated serum samples were prepared, mixed 1:1 with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus,
incubated for 1 h at 37°C and then added in a 1:1 ratio to the cells. After 48 h, the cells
were lysed, transferred to half-area 96-wells white microplates (Greiner Bio-One) and
Luciferase activity was measured using the Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System
(Promega) with a Glomax system (Turner Biosystems). Relative luminescence units
were normalized to the units from cells infected with pseudovirus in absence of serum.
Neutralization titers (ID50) were the serum dilution at which infectivity was inhibited
50%.
