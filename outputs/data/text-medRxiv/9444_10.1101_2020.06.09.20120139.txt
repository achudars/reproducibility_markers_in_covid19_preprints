Abstract
Despite ample research on the prevalence of specific psychiatric disorders during COVID-19, we
know little about how the pandemic affects the general wellbeing of a wider population. The study
investigates the prevalence and predictors of general psychiatric disorders measured by the 12item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and frequency of loneliness during COVID-19 in
the United Kingdom, a country heavily hit by the pandemic. We analyzed 15,530 respondents of
the first large-scale, nationally representative survey of COVID-19 in a developed country, the
first wave of Understanding Society COVID-19 Study. Results show that 29.2% of the respondents
score 4 or more, the caseness threshold, on the general psychiatric disorder measure, and 35.86%
of the respondents sometimes or often feel lonely. Regression analyses show that those who have
or had COVID-19-related symptoms are more likely to develop general psychiatric disorders and
are lonelier. Women and people in their 20s have higher risks of general psychiatric disorders and
loneliness, while having a job and living with a partner are protective factors. This study showcases
the general psychiatric disorders and loneliness of broader members of the society during COVID19 and the underlying social disparities.

1. Introduction
As the outbreak of COVID-19 has become a global public health emergency, an increasing
number of people are affected psychologically, albeit in various forms and to different degrees
(Qiu et al., 2020). Despite ample research on the prevalence and predictors of specific types of
psychiatric disorders (Huang and Zhao, 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Voitsidis et al., 2020), little is
known about how a national population suffers general psychiatric disorders from the pandemic
and feel lonely as a result of such disease control measures as social distancing (Banerjee and Rai,
2020; Galea, Merchant, and Lurie, 2020; Venkatesh et al., 2020), lockdown (Kokou-Kpolou et al.,
2020; Tull et al., 2020), and quarantine (Reynolds et al., 2008). General psychiatric disorders and
loneliness are arguably more widespread than the specific psychiatric disorders in the past studies
(Hwang et al., 2020; Killgore et al., 2020), more likely to be prevalent in the developed countries
(Mushtaq et al., 2004), and more severely affecting the socioeconomically disadvantaged groups
(Armitage and Nellums, 2020; Berg-Weger and Morley, 2020). Thus, the aim of the study is to
explore the prevalence and predictors of general psychiatric disorders and loneliness in the United
Kingdom, using the first large-scale, nationally representative survey from a developed country
during the pandemic.
The negative impacts of COVID-19, among other infectious diseases, on mental health
have been widely documented (Holmes et al., 2020; Duan and Zhu, 2020). Research shows the
prevalence of generalized anxiety disorders (Huang and Zhao, 2020), depression (Elbay et al.,
2020), insomnia, (Kokou-Kpolou et al., 2020; Voitsidis et al., 2020) and posttraumatic stress
symptoms (Liu et al., 2020;) during the COVID-19 and identifies sex (Liu et al., 2020), age (Meng
et al., 2020), and neighborhood (Cao et al., 2020) as risk factors. Despite importance of these

findings, there is imminent need for a bigger picture of how COVID-19 affects mental health of a
wider population more generally.
First, although the widely adopted social distancing, lockdown and quarantine measures
may cause severe psychiatric disorders to some people (Galea, Merchant, and Lurie, 2020), much
more people bear the emotional burdens of loneliness (Banerjee and Rai, 2020; Hwang et al., 2020;
Killgore et al., 2020) and develop minor psychiatric disorders that cannot be fully captured by the
specific clinical measures in previous research (Lu et al., 2020). The study alternatively adopts the
12-item General Health Questionnaire that validly predicts a wider range of psychiatric disorders
(Goldberg and Williams, 1988) and measures the frequency of loneliness as a signature psychiatric
risk posed by the current pandemic (Killgore et al., 2020). It finds much higher prevalence rates,
around one-third of the population, on both measures.
Second, while most studies focus on China and developing countries, developed countries
are also deeply affected by COVID-19 (Jia et al., 2020). Despite better health care services, the
disruptions of social lives are abrupt in the countries where people have always been connected by
technologies (Mushtaq et al., 2014). Thus, the residents could have felt lonely and developed the
psychiatric disorders in minor yet non-negligible forms. These unique challenges have not been
addressed due to the paucity of real-time, large-scale, and nationally representative data. We use
the first wave of the Understanding Society COVID-19 Study, a recent, high-quality, nationally
representative survey (Institute for Social and Economic Research, 2020) to assess the COVID19’s impact on 15,530 respondents in the United Kingdom, a developed country heavily hit by the
pandemic (Jia et al., 2020).
Third, our knowledge of the psychiatric disorders and loneliness of COVID-19 patients is
limited. For example, the percentages of respondents who have been diagnosed with COVID-19

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.09.20120139; this version posted June 12, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

in the previous surveys are lower than the confirmed prevalence rates in those countries (Cao et
al., 2020; Huang and Zhao, 2020; Liu et al., 2020), which may result from sampling bias. These
rates would also be lower than the predicted prevalence rates after accounting for the difficulty in
testing. In some studies, the sample size is too small to draw a meaningful comparison between
the COVID-19 patients and the general population (Huang and Zhao, 2020; Liu et al., 2020). In
this study, respondents were identified before the pandemic by using the sample of an existing
nationally representative survey, and this could help attenuate the selection bias. We also use selfreported COVID-19 symptoms instead of diagnoses to address the problem of delayed testing.
Moreover, suspected patients deserve attention in their own rights who suffer stress regardless of
confirmation. We find that people who have or had COVID-19 symptoms are more likely to have
general psychiatric disorders and are lonelier.
Finally, previous research offers tentative evidence on the impact of COVID-19 on the
vulnerable populations such as women and the elderly (Liu et al., 2020; Meng et al., 2020), whose
burdens can be assessed with a larger and more representative sample. With a more comprehensive
survey, we are able to study other social determinants of psychiatric disorders such as employment
status and family structure (Cao et al., 2020; Kawohl and Nordt, 2020). We find that women and
people in their 20s are at higher risks of general psychiatric disorders and loneliness, while having
a job and living with a partner are protective factors, suggesting social disparities in psychiatric
disorders and loneliness.

2. Methods
2.1. Data. Data for this study come from the first wave of Understanding Society COVID19 Study, which was conducted from in April 2020 and publicly available on May 29, 2020.

Understanding Society COVID-19 Study a special wave of the UK Household Longitudinal Study
(UKHLS), which uses stratified and clustered sampling to provide high-quality and nationally
representative panel data of around 40,000 United Kingdom households. The survey procedures
were approved by the Ethics Committee of University of Essex. The survey consists of an online
questionnaire but those without internet access are interviewed through telephone by trained
professionals. A total of 17,450 respondents answered the current survey with an overall response
rate of 41.2%. After pair-wise deletion of a small number of missing cases (around 1%), we
obtained an analytic sample of 15,530 respondents. To adjust for complex survey design and
unequal non-response rates, we use weighting in all analyses (Institute for Social and Economic
Research, 2020).
2.2. Measures. Loneliness is measured by a question adapted from the English
Longitudinal Study on Ageing (ELSA). Respondents are asked “In the last 4 weeks, how often did
you feel lonely?” The 4-week period is when COVID-19 was widespread in the country. The
responses are divided into three categories: “hardly ever or never,” “some of the time,” and “often.”
General psychiatric disorders are measured using the 12 items from General Health
Questionnaire (GHQ), a validated scale widely used in the community or non-clinical settings
(Aalto et al., 2012; Goldberg and Williams, 1988). There are 12 questions about respondents’
depressive, anxiety symptoms, sleeping problems, confidence and overall happiness etc., which
were measured on a four-point scale (1 ‘less than usual’, 2 ‘no more than usual’, 3 ‘rather more
than usual’, and 4 ‘much more than usual’). Next, 1 and 2 were recoded to 0, and 3 and 4 were
recoded to 1. Finally, the values of the 12 questions were then summed, resulting in a scale ranging
from 0 (the least mentally distressed) to 12 (the most mentally distressed). GHQ-12 score equal to
4 or more indicates caseness of general psychiatric disorders (Goldberg and Williams, 1988).

Gender is a binary variable. Age is divided into 5 categories: 18-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60,
and over 65. Because the United Kingdom consist of four countries, we create a four-category
variable for country of residence: England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Respondents
are asked two questions on past and current COVID-19 symptoms, “Have you experienced
symptoms that could be caused by coronavirus (COVID-19)?” and “Are you currently
experiencing symptoms that could be caused by coronavirus?” The answers to the two questions
are “Yes” or “No.” Employment status and living with a partner are also binary variables answered
with “Yes” or “No.” For more details about distribution of each variable, see Table 1.
[Insert Table 1 Here]
2.3. Statistical analyses. First, we report the descriptive statistics of the sample. Second,
we conduct univariate analyses with T-tests, ANOVA F-tests and Chi-squared tests to explore the
differences in general psychiatric disorders and loneliness across different groups. Third, we run
multiple regressions to account for covariates. An ordinary-least square regression model was
specified for the continuous General Health Questionnaire score, and a logistic regression model
was specified to test the odds ratio of falling into the case category. An ordered logistic regression
model was specified for the three-category ordinal outcome of loneliness.

3. Results
Table 2 shows the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among the whole UK population and
sub-population groups, and reports results of T-tests, ANOVA F-tests and Chi-squared tests to
compare prevalence of psychiatric disorder across different population groups. First, we find that
the population average GHQ-12 score is 2.73 (SD = 3.26) and 29.20% of the population have
caseness of psychiatric disorders. However, there are no significant differences between different

UK regions in levels of psychiatric disorders. Next, we find that GHQ-12 psychiatric disorder
scores and caseness ratio differ significantly across different socio-demographic groups.
Specifically, people who ever had or currently have COVID-19-related symptoms tend to have
significantly lower GHQ-12 psychiatric disorder scores than those who never had these symptoms.
Similarly, 35.81% and 54.50% people who ever had or currently have COVID-19-related
symptoms tend to have caseness of psychiatric disorders as opposed to 27.99% of those without
COVID-19-related symptoms. In addition, people who are female and younger tend to have
significantly higher GHQ-12 psychiatric disorder scores and caseness ratio than their counterparts,
suggesting that both groups are particularly at risk of psychiatric disorders. Also, we find that those
who live with a partner and employed tend to have significantly lower GHQ-12 psychiatric
disorder scores and caseness ratio than those who live alone and unemployed, suggesting that
family support and employment may be a potential protective factor of psychiatric disorders.
[Insert Table 2 Here]
Table 3 reports results of Chi-squared tests to explore differences in frequency of loneliness
between different socio-demographic groups. Overall, we find that in the last 4 weeks 64.14% of
the population report that they have never felted lonely, and 28.63% have sometimes felt lonely
and 7.22% have often felt lonely. The frequency of loneliness does not significantly vary across
different UK regions. Moreover, we find that people who have experienced or currently have
COVID-19 related symptoms, especially the latter group, are significantly more likely feel lonely
than those without COVID-19 related symptoms. For example, 20.00% of those with current
COVID-19 related symptoms report that they have often felt lonely as opposed to 9.17% of those
with previous COVID-19 related symptoms and 6.19% of those without symptoms. In terms of
demographic disparities in loneliness, we find that females and younger people tend to have

significantly higher frequencies of loneliness than their counterparts, suggesting that both groups
are particularly at risk of loneliness during COVID-19. We also find that people who live with a
partner and employed tend to have significantly lower frequencies of loneliness than their
counterparts, suggesting that family support and employment may prevent people from suffering
loneliness.
[Insert Table 3 Here]
Table 4 uses multivariate regression analyses to explore the net effects of COVID-19
related symptoms and socio-demographic characteristics on psychiatric disorders and loneliness.
Model 1 uses OLS model to analyze metrical score of GHQ-12, Model 2 uses logistic regression
to analyze GHQ-12 caseness ratio, and Model 3 uses ordered logistic regression to analyze
loneliness frequency. Overall, consistent with the findings in Table 2 and 3, the results of
multivariate regression models show that there are no significant regional differences in
psychiatric disorders and loneliness. Importantly, we find that after controlling for a range of sociodemographic characteristics presence of COVID-19 related symptoms is an important predictor
for psychiatric disorders and loneliness with people with current or previous COVID-19 related
symptoms being at a greater risk of these mental health problems. Next, with other variables being
held constant, females and younger people are still more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders
and loneliness than males and older people, and people who live with a partner and are employed
tend to have significantly lower levels of psychiatric disorders and loneliness than those who live
alone and are unemployed. These results highlight the importance of COVID-19 related symptoms
and continued social disparities in mental health problems during COVID-19 in the UK.

4. Discussion
Despite ample research on the prevalence of specific psychiatric disorders during COVID19, we know little about how the pandemic could affect a wider population in broader ways. The
study examines the prevalence and predictors of general psychiatric disorders and loneliness in a
developed country. Using nationally representative survey data from 15,530 respondents in the
United Kingdom, the study documents the high prevalence rates of general psychiatric disorders
(29.2%) and loneliness (35.86%) during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also shows that people with
current or past COVID-19 symptoms or various disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds are at
significantly higher risks of general psychiatric disorders and loneliness. It contributes to the extent
literature and informs public health policies in five distinctive ways.
First, the high prevalence rate of general psychiatric disorders lends support to numerous
studies on the impact of COVID-19 on mental health (Qiu et al., 2020). It also extends previous
research on more specific and severe psychiatric disorders (Huang and Zhao, 2020; Liu et al., 2020;
Voitsidis et al., 2020) by showing that nearly one-third of the population are affected by COVID19 in various forms and to different degrees. Although the minor psychiatric disorders are often
less urgent concerns of the public health policies, they are not negligible given the large proportion
of the population that have been affected. Only focusing on specific disorders underestimates the
psychiatric burdens of the pandemic in more subtle forms and overlooks the needs for psychiatric
care of the people who have not been clinically diagnosed.
Second, the prevalence rate of loneliness, an example of minor psychological problem, is
high during COVID-19. Over one-third of the respondents sometimes or often feel lonely. This
could have arisen from such disease control measures as social distancing, lockdown and
quarantine (Tull et al., 2020). It has been repeatedly argued that social isolation during COVID-

19 increases loneliness (Killgore et al., 2020), for which the study offers empirical support using
a large-scale, nationally representative survey. Loneliness is linked to long-term health outcomes
including all-cause mortality (Steptoe et al., 2013), so public health policies need to be aware of
the (mental) health consequences of the disease control measures, especially in the developed
countries where disruption of social lives could be more abrupt (Jia et al., 2020).
Third, because the respondents were recruited before the pandemic and were asked about
COVID-19-related symptoms rather than diagnoses, we obtained a large enough sample size to
compare suspected patients with the general population. People with current or past symptoms of
COVID-19 are significantly more likely to develop general psychiatric disorders and feel lonelier,
evidencing the urgent psychiatric needs of suspected patients.
Fourth, risk factors for psychiatric disorders are examined during the pandemic. Consistent
with previous research, being female is a significant predictor of both general psychiatric disorders
and loneliness (Liu et al., 2020). Contrary to the popular belief (Armitage and Nellums, 2020;
Meng et al., 2020), compared to people in their 20s, older age groups are significantly less likely
to feel lonely or develop psychiatric disorders, perhaps because younger people’s economic and
social lives are more disrupted by a public health emergency (Cao et al., 2020).
Finally, the study identifies two social determinants of general psychiatric disorders and
loneliness during COVID-19. Having a job and living with a partner are both significant protective
factors for general psychiatric disorders and loneliness. Moving beyond individual demographics,
further studies could explore how social support from work and family buffer the psychological
impacts of a pandemic (Cao et al., 2020; Kawohl and Nordt, 2020).
In all, future research and public health policies need to move beyond specific psychiatric
disorders to attend to the general psychiatric disorders and loneliness of a larger proportion of the

population. They need to pay special attention to vulnerable populations including women, people
in their 20s, the unemployed, those not living with a partner, and those who have or had COVID19 symptoms. A pandemic like COVID-19 could exaggerate social disparities in mental health in
subtle ways, calling for research on effective interventions (Holmes et al., 2020; Duan and Zhu,
2020).
