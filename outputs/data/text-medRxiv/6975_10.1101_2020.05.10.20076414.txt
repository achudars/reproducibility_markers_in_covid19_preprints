Abstract

2

Background: The pandemic inflicted by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulted in

3

physical isolation measures in many parts of the world. In Australia, nationwide restrictions

4

included staying at home, unless seeking medical care, providing care, purchasing food,

5

undertaking exercise, or attending work in an essential service. All undergraduate university

6

classes transitioned to online, mostly home-based learning. This disruption to daily life may

7

have consequences for eating and physical activity patterns.

8

Methods: In this observational study, we examined the effect of isolation measures, during the

9

early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia (March/April), on diet (24-hour diet recall,

10

ASA-24) and physical activity (Active Australia Survey) patterns among third-year biomedical

11

students in Brisbane, Australia. Findings were compared to students enrolled in the same

12

course in the previous two years.

13

Results: In females, energy intake was ~20% greater in 2020 compared with 2018 and 2019,

14

and the frequency of snacking and energy density of consumed snacks were also increased. In

15

males, there was no difference in energy intake or snacking behaviour. Physical activity was

16

impacted for both sexes, whereby fewer students undertook any walking activity and, of those

17

that did, time spent doing so was less compared with 2018 and 2019. The proportion of students

18

reporting any vigorous activity was not different for males or females but, among males who

19

participated in this level of activity, the duration was less in 2020 compared with previous

20

years. The proportion of male and female students achieving ‘sufficient’ levels of activity,

21

defined by at least 150 mins over at least 5 sessions, was ~30% less in 2020. Indeed, the

22

majority of students reported as having undertaken less physical activity than usual.

23

Conclusions: Increased energy intake for females and reduced physical activity for males and

24

females demonstrate impacts of isolation measures that may have deleterious consequences for

Introduction

29

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, was declared a pandemic by

30

the World Health Organization on March 11th 2020. In the majority of cases, it is an acute

31

respiratory illness including fever, cough, and a sore throat but, in moderate to severe cases,

32

the disease progresses to breathing difficulties, respiratory distress and extra-respiratory

33

symptoms including heart and kidney injury and, in some cases, death (1). As of May 10th

34

2020, the virus has already infected ~4 million people and resulted in more than 270,000 deaths

35

globally (2).

36

Human-to-human transmission occurs primarily via respiratory droplets generated through

37

coughing, sneezing, and talking; and other contagion sources include contaminated biologicals

38

and surfaces (3, 4). Intense research efforts are in place for the identification of effective

39

therapies and vaccines but, in the meantime, to contain spread and prevent overburdening our

40

healthcare systems, the most effective strategy is contact tracing and physical isolation

41

measures.

42

The Australian Government, including individual States and Territories, announced gradual

43

‘lockdown’ measures in response to the growing number of cases that could not be adequately

44

traced. Community transmission become of major concern and, as at March 30th 2020, all but

45

essential services were shut down, and people only left their homes for work (in an essential

46

service), or to purchase food, receive or provide medical care, or exercise. Whilst the majority

47

of primary and secondary schools remained opened for the children of essential workers,

48

universities transitioned all undergraduate learning online by March 23rd 2020.

49

Whilst effective for containing outbreaks, disrupted habits involving strict isolation

50

measures can adversely affect both physical and mental health, with potentially exacerbated

51

effects among young adults who rely upon positive peer interactions for their general wellbeing

52

(5, 6). Likely consequences of home-isolation are changes to eating and physical activity

53

behaviours. It is reasonable to hypothesise that more time spent at home promotes hypercaloric

54

diets, including larger meal sizes and increased snack frequency and size. Alternatively, fewer

55

opportunities to travel outside the home may encourage more structured meal patterns and less

56

take-away foods that are typically energy-dense. For physical activity, the lockdown would be

57

anticipated to reduce both frequency and duration, not only for typically active persons who

58

are no longer able to access gyms and health clubs, but for those who achieve sufficient levels

59

of activity incidentally, through walking or cycling to work or study. This is particularly

60

pertinent to university students attending a major campus who typically walk between classes

61

numerous times a day. To this end, the impact of COVID-19-induced isolation measures on

62

diet and physical activity patterns in Australian undergraduate students was measured one week

63

after the transition to online learning and compared with data obtained in the previous two

64

years.

Methods

66

Study design and participants

67

This observational study was approved by The University of Queensland Human Research

68

Ethics Committee (Project Approval: 2016-02-066-PRE-3) and conducted in accordance with

69

the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research (Australia).

70

Participants were recruited from third-year biomedical practical classes from The University

71

of Queensland (Brisbane, Australia) in 2018, 2019 and 2020. In 2018 and 2019, students

72

physically attended the practical classes on campus. In 2020, all undergraduate classes

73

transitioned online by March 23rd. For each year, students who provided written informed

74

consent were given a unique code (and password for the online diet questionnaire). Inclusion

75

criteria was 19-27 years of age (214 males and 295 females).

76
77

Diet and physical activity questionnaires

78

The Automated Self-Administered Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA24-Australia-2016) was

79

used to guide participants through a 24-hour recall for the previous day (7). Participants were

80

asked to recall all foods, drinks, and supplements consumed from midnight-to-midnight.

81

Participants selected an eating occasion from a pre-determined list (e.g., ‘breakfast’ or ‘snack’)

82

and reported all foods and beverages consumed at that time. Foods and beverages were entered

83

by typing in specific search terms and selecting items from a returned list. Details of food types,

84

preparation methods, portion sizes, additions, eating location, and food source were then

85

queried by the system. Participants were prompted to recall frequently omitted and forgotten

86

foods, and to complete a final review of all items consumed. The 24-hour energy intake

87

included in this analysis includes all foods, drinks, and supplements. The main meals data

88

include anything reported as ‘breakfast/brunch’, ‘lunch’ and ‘dinner’. Snack data include

89

anything consumed during a ‘snack’, ‘drink’, and ‘supper’ occasion, which was before, after,

90

or between main meals. Plain water or zero calorie drinks on their own were not considered a

91

snack occasion. The distributions presented for eating location includes all occasions reported

92

for all participants. For all meals eaten at home, the food source for the majority of ingredients

93

reported for a given eating occasion is shown. For each year, the intake date used for the recall

94

was between: March 18-20 2018, March 24-26 2019, and March 28-April 2 2020.

95

The Active Australia Survey was used to estimate leisure-time physical activity (8).

96

Participants self-completed the survey following instruction. Sufficient activity was defined as

97

at least 150 minutes of activity over at least five sessions per week. Insufficient activity was

98

defined as undertaking some activity but not enough in total time or number of sessions to be

99

considered a health benefit. Sedentary was defined as no activity at all. Total time was

100

calculated by adding time spent in walking (continuously for at least 10 minutes), moderate

101

activity and vigorous activity (weighted by two). To distinguish vigorous versus moderate

102

activity, exercise intensity was estimated for each activity based on a metabolic equivalent

103

(MET) score of 3-6 for moderate or >6 for vigorous, where 1 MET was defined as the resting

104

metabolic rate, equivalent to oxygen uptake of 3.5 mL/kg/hour (9). A score for total sessions

105

was calculated by adding the number of sessions of walking (continuously for at least 10

106

minutes), moderate activity, and vigorous activity. The average time spent walking

107

(continuously for at least 10 minutes) or engaging in vigorous activity, for those who reported

108

participation in that activity, was also reported, according to the Survey guide (8). For all

109

calculations, any reported gardening or yard work was not included, as per survey guidelines.

110
111

Statistical analyses

112

All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism. Exploratory analyses were conducted,

113

separately for males and females, examining the distribution and summary statistics. Where

114

data did not follow a normal distribution, determined using the Shapiro-Wilk test, non-

115

parametric tests were used, and data reported as median and either inter-quartile range (IQR)

116

and/or range. Categorical variables were reported with frequencies and proportions.

117

Distributions for participant ethnicity and dietary recalls that fell on a weekend were compared

118

between years using the chi-square (X2) test. Due to non-normal data, a Kruskal-Wallis test

119

was used to determine differences in age, between class years, followed by Dunn’s multiple

120

comparisons test.

121

Due to non-normal data, a Kruskal-Wallis test was used to determine differences in total

122

24-hour energy intake (kJ), 24-hour energy intake and energy density attributed to main meals

123

or snacks, and the number of snacking occasions between class years, followed by Dunn’s

124

multiple comparisons test, where appropriate. As there were no statistical differences between

125

2018 and 2019, these years were combined and compared with class year 2020 for the same

126

dietary parameters using a Mann-Whitney test. The proportion of participants reporting any

127

alcohol consumption was compared between the years using the chi-square test. The location

128

of eating occasions was compared between class years, using the chi-square test. As differences

129

were found for both sexes, separate chi-square tests compared the ‘home’ location to all other

130

locations combined. Given no statistically significant differences were found between class

131

year 2018 and 2019, these years were combined and compared with 2020 using a further chi-

132

square test. For all eating occasions at ‘home’, the source of food was compared between years,

133

using the chi-square test.

134

To investigate differences in physical activity participation between class years, the

135

proportion of respondents reporting any amount of walking and/or vigorous activity was

136

examined. In order to meet the assumptions of the chi-square test, that all values are >1 and

137

that no more than 20% of values are <5, a systematic approach was taken. Class year 2018 was

138

compared to 2019 using the chi-square test and, given no statistically significant difference was

139

found, these class years were combined and compared to 2020 using a separate chi-square test.

Time spent in walking and vigorous activity was compared between class years using a

Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test, where appropriate.

142

Influence of class year on proportion of participants achieving ‘sufficient’ activity was also

143

examined. Class year 2018 was compared to 2019 using a chi-square test and, given no

144

statistically significant difference was found, these class years were combined. Sedentary and

145

insufficient activity were also combined, resulting in a separate chi-square test comparing

146

2018/19 to 2020 for sedentary/insufficient versus sufficient levels of physical activity.

Study participants

149

Table 1 shows the sample size for each outcome variable in males and females, and the

150

proportion of dietary recalls that fell on a weekend relative to a weekday. This differed for both

151

sexes between 2018 and 2019 due to differences in practical class scheduling (69% of students

152

in 2018 and 36% in 2019 were scheduled on a Monday and therefore reported on meals and

153

drinks consumed on Sunday; males: X2 (1) = 9.042, p < 0.01; females: X2 (1) = 31.72, p <

154

0.0001). In 2020, students did not attend campus and had the option to complete the virtual

155

practical class on any day within the specified week. In 2020, 31% of students reported

156

weekend intakes which was significantly less compared with students in 2018 (males: X2 (1) =

157

23.52, p < 0.0001; females: X2 (1) = 21.00, p < 0.0001) but not compared with 2019 (males: X2

158

(1) = 3.723, p = 0.054; females: X2 (1) = 0.7808, p = 0.377). There were no differences in

159

energy intake between weekday and weekend recalls for each year among males and females

160

(data not shown; Student’s unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney test, where appropriate).

Table 2 summarises the demographic characteristics by class year. A significant age

165

difference was found between class year for both males (H(2) = 27.37, p < 0.0001) and females

166

(H(2) = 22.79, p < 0.0001). For males, median age was significantly higher in year 2020

167

compared with 2019 (p < 0.01) and 2018 (p < 0.0001). Similarly, for females, median age was

168

significantly higher in class year 2020 compared with 2019 (p < 0.0001) and 2018 (p < 0.01).

169

There was no difference in age between 2018 and 2019 for males or females. A chi-square test

170

revealed no significant differences in ethnicity proportions between collection years for both

171

males (X2 (8) = 11.73, p = 0.164) and females (X2 (8) = 7.271, p = 0.508).

Dietary intake from ASA 24-hour recall

175

For male participants, total 24-hour energy intake was not different between class years (H(2)

176

= 0.992, p = 0.609; Figure 1A). For females, a significant difference was found (H(2) = 7.60,

177

p < 0.05), whereby total 24-hour energy intake during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 tended

178

to be higher compared with the year 2019 (+13.2%; p = 0.067) and was significantly higher

179

compared with the year 2018 (+24.3%; p < 0.05; Figure 1B). As there was no significant

180

difference between 2018 and 2019, these years were combined and compared with 2020.

181

Among males, there remained no difference (Figure 1C) and, among females, total 24-hour

182

energy intake was 19.5% higher in 2020 compared with 2018/19 combined (p < 0.01; Figure

183

1D).

184

Daily energy intake and energy density coming from main meals or from snacks were

185

compared between the class years. There were no significant differences between 2018 and

186

2019, and thus these years were combined and compared with 2020. Daily energy intake from

187

main meals was not different, but energy density tended to be less in male (-5.2%; p = 0.068),

188

but not female, participants in 2020 compared with 2018/19 (Figure 2A-D). Among males,

189

there was no difference in the number of snack occasions, energy intake attributed to snacks,

190

or the energy density of consumed snacks between 2020 and 2018/19 (Figure 2E, G, I).

191

However, in females, there was an increase to two snack occasions in 2020 compared with one

192

in 2018/19 (p < 0.05; Figure 2F). In addition, energy intake and energy density attributed to

193

snacks were increased in 2020 compared with 2018/19 among female students (+50%; p =

194

0.083 and +62%; p < 0.05, respectively; Figure 2H, J).

195

The proportion of participants who consumed any alcohol between the class years was not

196

different for males (19% average across all years, X2 (2) = 2.297, p = 0.317) or females (13%

197

average across all years, X2 (2) = 3.425, p = 0.180; data not shown).

198

The distribution of eating location by class year was significantly different for both males

199

(X2(8) = 71.27, p < 0.0001) and females (X2(8) = 86.53, p < 0.0001). Separate chi-square tests

comparing the ‘home’ location to all other locations revealed a significant difference, with the

201

vast majority of participants consuming food at home (males: 96.2% in 2020 and 73.8% in

202

2018/19 combined; X2(1) = 62.37, p < 0.0001; females: 95.8% in 2020 and 75.5% in 2018/19

203

combined; X2(1) = 78.33, p < 0.0001; Figure 3A-B). For all foods consumed at home, the food

204

source was not different between class years (males: X2(8) = 5.957, p = 0.652; females: X2(8)

205

= 14.12, p = 0.079; Figure 3C-D).

< 0.05) but no difference for vigorous activity (X2(1) = 1.287, p = 0.257; Figure 4A). A similar

212

result was seen for females with a significant reduction for walking participation in 2020

213

compared with 2018/19 (X2(1) = 6.299, p < 0.05) but no difference for vigorous activity (X2(1)

214

= 1.35, p = 0.245; Figure 4B).

215

Among those who reported any walking, a Kruskal-Wallis test revealed a significant

216

difference in the time spent in this activity for both males (H(2) = 19.11, p < 0.0001) and

217

females (H(2) = 8.964, p < 0.05). Post-hoc analysis for male participants revealed that time

218

spent walking was significantly less in year 2020 compared with 2019 (-52.5 min; p < 0.05)

219

and 2018 (-87.5 min; p < 0.0001; Figure 4C). Similarly, for females, time spent walking in

220

2020 was significantly less than 2019 (-30 min; p < 0.05) and non-significantly less than 2018

221

(-30 min; p = 0.068; Figure 4D). Time spent walking between class years 2018 and 2019 were

222

not different for either males or females. Time spent in vigorous activity was also found to be

223

significantly different for males (H(2) = 19.63, p < 0.0001), with class year 2020 spending

224

significantly less time in this activity compared with 2019 (-60 min; p < 0.05) and 2018 (-150

225

min; p < 0.0001; Figure 4E). There was no difference in time spent in vigorous activity between

226

males in year 2018 and 2019. Additionally, among females, no differences in time spent in

227

vigorous activity were seen between the class years (Figure 4F).

228

The proportion of participants achieving ‘sufficient’ activity, relative to insufficient and

229

sedentary levels can be seen in Figure 5A-B. A chi-square analysis comparing class year 2020

230

to 2018/19, revealed a significant difference for males (X2(1) = 13.36, p < 0.001; Figure 5A)

231

and females (X2(1) = 20.88, p < 0.0001; Figure 5B), whereby fewer participants achieved

232

‘sufficient’ levels of activity in 2020. Figure 5C-D demonstrates the proportion of participants

233

from class year 2020 reporting typical versus atypical amounts of physical activity during the

234

COVID-19 pandemic; the majority (56% for males and 61% for females) reported less than

235

usual physical activity levels.

Discussion

237

This is the first study to assess energy intake and physical activity levels in young adults during

238

the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study was conducted in a cohort of Australian university

239

undergraduate students within one week of government-imposed physical isolation measures

240

and the transition from face-to-face to online classes. These data were compared with students

241

enrolled in the same course over the preceding two years. The major findings are an increase

242

in total energy intake, snacking frequency, and energy density of consumed snacks in female

243

students, and a reduction in physical activity levels in both males and females.

244

Almost all (~96%) eating occasions during the pandemic were based at home compared

245

with only three-quarters in 2018/19. This was expected, given the ban on dining-in at food

246

venues that had remained open. Takeaway options remained available, but more than 90% of

247

all foods consumed in the home were sourced from grocery stores and/or fresh markets, which

248

was consistent with previous years. There was a small (~5%) reduction in the energy density

249

of main meals consumed by male students in 2020 and, while the location of meal preparation

250

was not examined in this study, this could reflect a reduction in foods prepared away from

251

home, which are typically more energy dense compared with home-prepared foods (10). Total

252

energy intake was unaffected, indicating a compensatory increase in main meal portion size.

253

Compared with the difference in males, the maintenance of main meal energy density in

254

females may reflect their higher consumption of home-prepared meals in general, pre-

255

pandemic (11). Our data suggest, however, that more time spent at home promoted a

256

hypercaloric diet in female students, which was attributed to increased frequency and energy

257

density of snacks. Foods consumed away from home, including self-prepared lunches and

258

snacks, are typically pre-portioned to a limited size. Thus, increased consumption at home may

259

result from increased food visibility and opportunities to snack, possibly exaggerated by ‘panic

260

buying’ and stockpiled food that coincided with national lockdown measures (12, 13).

261

Increased snacking in female, but not male, students while in home-isolation may reflect

262

differences in social influence and perceived norms (14). When in the presence of mixed-sex

263

peers, which is likely in the university setting, females have been shown to eat less than when

264

in same-sex groups (15). Eating behaviour is also known to be impacted by stress and anxiety

265

and, indeed, there has been a marked increase in telephone calls to youth mental health

266

organisations during the pandemic, the majority from young women aged 19-25 (16). Females

267

appear to be more likely to ‘stress-eat’ and consume hyperpalatable ‘comfort’ foods (17-19),

268

which, in line with the current study, are typically energy dense. The addictive properties of

269

energy-dense comfort foods can lead to long-lasting changes to eating behaviours (20).

270

As our reference control group, the median 24-hour energy intake in 2018/19 combined was

271

10,338 kJ for males and 6,776 kJ for females. This is slightly less than the latest data on energy

272

intake from the Australian Health Survey, which included a broader representation of

273

Australian residents (11,004 kJ in males and 7,863 kJ in females; means for 19-30 year age

274

group) (21). Lower energy intake in biomedical science students compared with the general

275

public may be due, in part, to greater health awareness and more balanced eating patterns.

276

Alternatively, albeit somewhat related, is the established inverse relationship between

277

education status and obesity in high-income nations (22). It should also be noted that the

278

national nutrition data was attained in 2011-12, which may confound comparisons with the

279

current data. Nevertheless, our data are consistent with a previous report in health science

280

students in Spain (-22% and -8% compared with national survey data in males and females,

281

respectively) (23), suggesting that university students consume less energy than age-matched

282

national averages.

283

Isolation measures also saw a substantial reduction in physical activity levels in both male

284

and female students, despite widespread recommendations to maintain physical activity during

285

the pandemic (24, 25). Specifically, in 2020, fewer students reported any amount of walking

286

(males 88%; females 93%) compared to 2018/19 (males 96%; 99% females), and of those that

287

did, less time was spent doing so. It is reasonable to attribute this finding to the loss of

288

incidental walking through commute, daily activities, or as part of one’s vocation, including

289

walking between classes on campus. Those choosing to participate in vigorous activity, which

290

was not different between the class years, are perhaps more ingrained in their prioritisation of

291

physical activity (26) and found ways to continue doing so during lockdown. Notably,

292

however, of those that did participate in vigorous activity, the time spent doing so in 2020 was

293

less for males compared with previous years. With males more likely to participate in vigorous

294

activity, as we and others have shown (27), and be motivated by mastery and competition (28),

295

the closure of recreational sport and community gyms was likely to impact their activity levels.

296

The positive health benefits of physical activity are well established, with unequivocal

297

evidence linking physical inactivity to non-communicable diseases (29). Many government

298

bodies have established physical activity guidelines, not only as a prevention strategy for

299

chronic diseases, but for psychological benefits (30-33). The most recent Australian Guidelines

300

recommend adults between 18-64 years achieve at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity

301

activity, on most days of the week, to achieve health benefits (34). In our population of

302

undergraduate biomedical students, over 80% of participants were deemed to be ‘sufficiently

303

active’ in the control years, which well-surpasses the age-controlled Australian average of 53%

304

(35). While university educated persons have been reported to be more physically active, and

305

have a reduced risk of being overweight (36), the reductions in sufficient activity seen during

306

the COVID-19 pandemic, to 62% and 55% for males and females, respectively, is less than

307

favourable. Specific targets have been set for ‘sufficient activity’ to achieve substantial health

308

benefits, but the Australian Guidelines also stipulate that “doing any physical activity is better

309

than doing none” (34). This is supported by research showing a dose-response relationship

310

between positive health effects and physical activity, with no obvious lower threshold for

311

benefit and a continuous risk reduction (37). Therefore, in this study, the increase in sedentary

312

behaviour and reduction in physical activity raises health concerns.

313

While several weeks, or even a few months, of physical inactivity is unlikely to result in an

314

abrupt onset of metabolic disease, sudden exercise cessation can decrease insulin sensitivity,

315

cause muscle and bone loss, and abolish many of the positive exercise-induced metabolic and

316

cardiovascular adaptations (38, 39). A further consequence is, undoubtedly, the loss of

317

psychological benefits associated with physical activity (40). This may be compounded by the

318

lack of social support during isolation periods, which is also important to maintain activity

319

(41). This impact of inactivity on psychological health is further linked to the, potential stress-

320

associated, increase in energy intake among female students. Arguably, the greatest risk to

321

mortality, however, is the lasting impact on behaviour, that any time in lockdown may trigger.

322

This is particularly true for those who are extrinsically motivated to participate in activity (i.e.,

323

to achieve outcome-based goals such as physical appearance) versus those who are intrinsically

324

motivated and genuinely enjoy taking part in physical activity (42). It is worth noting that a

325

hasty return to pre-pandemic activity levels, upon easing of isolation measures, can raise the

326

risk of injury, particularly with the return to vigorous activity (43).

327

While these findings are undesirable, it is possible that our data reflect short-term

328

consequences to an abrupt change in daily habits, and that over several weeks, participants

329

recalibrated their diet and physical activity behaviours upon a newly established routine. For

330

example, females may have started to consider the implications of increased snacking and both

331

males and females may have taken the time to establish ‘at-home’ workouts, gain access to

332

equipment, and/or incorporate a walk into their day. Indeed, in this study, 56% of males and

333

61% of females felt they had undertaken ‘less than typical’ physical activity levels during the

334

first week of isolation and the transition to online study, and such self-awareness may increase

335

the likelihood of positive behaviour adjustments.

336

Conclusions

337

The global outbreak of COVID-19 resulted in restrictive isolation measures in many parts of

338

the world. This was aimed at limiting transmission and hence reducing the burden on our

339

healthcare systems, i.e. ‘flattening the curve’. In our study, which was conducted during the

340

early phase of physical isolation and transition to online learning, energy intake in female

341

students was increased and physical activity levels in both males and females was reduced

342

compared with students in the previous two years. Undesirable changes to diet and physical

343

activity patterns have the potential to persist for some time, even after isolation measures are

344

eased. These changes, particularly if sustained, can have deleterious consequences for both

345

physical and mental wellbeing.

Figure 1. Total 24-hour energy intake in male and female students in class year 2020 (N=64
males, 82 females) compared with 2018 (N=65 males, 101 females) and 2019 (N=63 males,
96 females; A, B). No statistical differences were observed between 2018 and 2019 and
therefore these years were combined (N=128 males, 197 females) and compared with 2020 (C,
D). Data are presented as median ± IQR and range. * p < 0.05 between 2020 and 2018 by
Kruskal-Wallis test. ** p < 0.01 between 2020 and 2018/19 by Student’s unpaired t-test.

A-B, no statistical differences were observed between 2018 and 2019 and therefore, to meet
the assumptions of the chi-square test, these years were combined and compared with 2020;
*** p < 0.001 and **** p < 0.0001 between 2020 and 2018/19 for ‘sufficient’ vs.
