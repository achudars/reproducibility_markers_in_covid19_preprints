Abstract: Several epidemiological models are being used around the world to project the number
of infected individuals and the mortality rates of the COVID-19 outbreak. Advancing accurate
prediction models is of utmost importance to take proper actions. Due to a high level of uncertainty
or even lack of essential data, the standard epidemiological models have been challenged regarding
the delivery of higher accuracy for long-term prediction. As an alternative to the susceptibleinfected-resistant (SIR)-based models, this study proposes a hybrid machine learning approach to
predict the COVID-19 and we exemplify its potential using data from Hungary. The hybrid machine
learning methods of adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and multi-layered
perceptron-imperialist competitive algorithm (MLP-ICA) are used to predict time series of infected
individuals and mortality rate. The models predict that by late May, the outbreak and the total
morality will drop substantially. The validation is performed for nine days with promising results,
which confirms the model accuracy. It is expected that the model maintains its accuracy as long as
no significant interruption occurs. Based on the results reported here, and due to the complex nature
of the COVID-19 outbreak and variation in its behavior from nation-to-nation, this study suggests
machine learning as an effective tool to model the outbreak. This paper provides an initial
benchmarking to demonstrate the potential of machine learning for future research.

1. Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, also known as SARS-CoV-2, is reported as a
virus strain causing the respiratory disease of COVID-19 [1]. The World Health Organization (WHO)
and the global nations confirmed the coronavirus disease to be extremely contagious [2,3]. The
COVID-19 pandemic has been widely recognized as a public health emergency of international
concern [4]. To estimate the outbreak, identify the peak ahead of time, and also predict the mortality
rate the epidemiological models had been widely used by officials and media. Outbreak prediction
models have shown to be essential to communicate insights into the likely spread and consequences
of COVID-19. Furthermore, governments and other legislative bodies used the insights from
prediction models to suggest new policies and to assess the effectiveness of the enforced policies [5].
The COVID-19 pandemic has been reported to be extremely aggressive to spread [6]. Due to the
complex
nature of the COVID-19 outbreak and its irregularity in different countries, the standard

epidemiological models, i.e., susceptible-infected-resistant (SIR)-based models, had been challenged

for delivering higher performance in individual nations. Furthermore, as the COVID-19 outbreak
showed significant differences with other recent outbreaks, e.g., Ebola, Cholera, swine fever, H1N1
influenza, dengue fever, and Zika, advanced epidemiological models have been emerged to provide
higher accuracy [7]. Nevertheless, due to several unknown variables involved in the spread, the
complexity of population-wide behavior in various countries, and differences in containment
strategies model uncertainty has been reported inevitable [8-10]. Consequently, standard
epidemiological models face new challenges to deliver more reliable results.
The strategy standard SIR models is formed around the assumption of transmitting the
infectious disease through contacts, considering three different classes susceptible, infected, and
recovered [11]. The susceptible to infection (class S), infected (class I), and the removed population
(class R) build the foundation of the epidemiological modeling. Note that definition of various classes
of outbreak may vary. For instance, R is often referred to those that have recovered, developed
immunity, been isolated, or passed away. However, in some countries, R is susceptible to be infected
again and there exists uncertainties in allocating R a value. Advancing SIR-based models requires
several assumptions. It is assumed that the class I transmits the infection to class S where the number
of probable transmissions is proportional to the total number of contacts computed using basic
differential equations as follows [12-14].
𝑑𝑆
𝑑𝑡

(1)

= −𝛼𝑆𝐼

where 𝐼 , 𝑆 , and 𝛼 represent the infected population, the susceptible population, and the daily
reproduction rate, respectively. The value of 𝑆 in the time-series produced by the differential
equation gradually declines. At the early stage of the outbreak, it is assumed that 𝑆 ≈ 1 where

𝑑𝐼
𝑑𝑡

becomes linear. Eventually the class I can be stated as follows.
𝑑𝐼

= 𝛼𝑆𝐼 − 𝛽𝐼,
𝑑𝑡

𝑑𝑅
𝑑𝑡

= 𝛽𝐼

(2)

where 𝛽 regulates the daily rate of spread. Furthermore, the individuals excluded from the model is
computed as follows. Considering the above assumption, the outbreak modeling with SIR is finally
computed as follows:

𝐼 (𝑡) ≈ 𝐼0 𝑒𝑥𝑝{(𝛼 − 𝛽)}.

(3)

Furthermore, to evaluate the performance of the SIR-based models, the median success of the
outbreak prediction is used which is calculated as follows:

𝑓=

𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛
𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒

.

(4)

Several analytical solutions to the SIR models have been provided in literature [15,16]. As the
different nations take different actions toward slowing down the outbreak, the SIR-based model must
be adopted according to the local assumptions [17]. Inaccuracy of many SIR-based models in
predicting the outbreak and mortality rate have been evidenced during the COVID-19 in many
nations. The key success of an SIR-based model relies on choosing the right model according to the
context and the relevant assumptions. SIS, SIRD, MSIR, SEIR, SEIS, MSEIR, and MSEIRS models are
among the popular models used for predicting COVID-19 outbreaks worldwide. The more advanced
variation of SIR-d models carefully considers the vital dynamics and constant population [16]. For
instance, at the presence of the long-lasting immunity assumption when the immunity is not realized
upon recovery from infection, the susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model was suggested [18].
In contrast, the susceptible-infected-recovered-deceased-model (SIRD) is used when immunity is
assumed [19]. In the case of COVID-19 different nations took different approaches in this regard.
SEIR models have been reported among the most popular tools to predict the outbreak. SEIR
models through considering the significant incubation period of an infected person reported to
present relatively more accurate predictions. In the case of Varicella and Zika outbreaks the SEIR
models showed increased model accuracy [20,21]. SEIR models assume that the incubation period is
a random variable and similarly to the SIR model, there is a disease-free-equilibrium [22,23]. It should

be noted, however, that SEIR models can not fit well where the contact network are non-stationary
through time [24]. Social mixing as key factor of non-stationarity determines the reproductive
number 𝑅0 which is the number of susceptible individuals for infection. The value of 𝑅0 for COVID19 was estimated to be 4 which greatly trigged the pandemic [1]. The lockdown measures aimed at
reducing the 𝑅0 value down to 1. Nevertheless, the SEIR models are reported to be difficult to fit in
the case of COVID-19 due to the non-stationarity of mixing, caused by nudging intervention
measures. Therefore, to develop accurate SIR-based models an in-depth information about the social
movement and the quality of lockdown measures would be essential. Other drawback of SIR-based
models is the short lead-time. As the lead-time increases, the accuracy of the model declines. For
instance, for the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, the accuracy of the model reduces from 𝑓 = 1 for the
first five days to 𝑓 = 0.86 for day 6 [17]. Overall, the SIR-based models would be accurate if firstly
the status of social interactions is stable. Secondly, the class R can be computed precisely. To better
estimate the class R, several data sources can be integrated with SIR-based models, e.g., social media
and call data records (CDR), which of course a high degree of uncertainty and complexity still
remains [25-32]. Considering the above uncertainties involved in the advancement of SIR-based
models the generalization ability are yet to be improved to achieve scalable model with high
performance [33].
Due to the complexity and the large-scale nature of the problem in developing epidemiological
models, machine learning has recently gained attention for building outbreak prediction models. ML
has already shown promising results in contribution to advancing higher generalization ability and
greater prediction reliability for longer lead-times [34-38]. Machine learning has been already
recognized a computing technique with great potential in outbreak prediction. Application of ML in
outbreak prediction includes several algorithms, e.g., random forest for swine fever [39] [40], neural
network for H1N1 flu, dengue fever, and Oyster norovirus [41] [11] [42], genetic programming for
Oyster norovirus [43], classification and regression tree (CART) for Dengue [44], Bayesian Network
for Dengue and Aedes [45], LogitBoost for Dengue [46], multi-regression and Naïve Bayes for Dengue
outbreak prediction [47]. Although ML methods were used in modeling former pandemics (e.g.,
Ebola, Cholera, swine fever, H1N1 influenza, dengue fever, Zika, oyster norovirus [11,39-48]), there
is a gap in the literature for peer-reviewed papers dedicated to COVID-19. Nevertheless, machine
learning has been strongly proposed as a great potential for the fight against COVID-19 [49,50].
Machine learning delivered promising results in several aspects for mitigation and prevention and
have been endorsed in the scientific community for, e.g., case identifications [51], classification of
novel pathogens [52], modification of SIR-based models [53], diagnosis [54,55], survival prediction
[56], and ICU demand prediction [57]. Furthermore, the non-peer reviewed sources suggest
numerous potentials of machine learning to fight COVID-19. Among the applications of machine
learning improvement of the existing models of prediction, identifying vulnerable groups, early
diagnose, advancement of drugs delivery, evaluation of the probability of next pandemic,
advancement of the integrated systems for spatio-temporal prediction, evaluating the risk of
infection, advancing reliable biomedical knowledge graphs, and data mining the social networks are
being noted.
As stated in our former paper machine learning can be used for data preprocessing. Improving
the quality of data can particularly improve the quality of the SIR-based model. For instance, the
number of cases reported by Worldometer is not precisely the number of infected cases (E in the SEIR
model), or calculating the number of infectious people (I in SEIR) cannot be easily determined, as
many people who might be infectious may not turn up for testing. Although the number of people
who are admitted to hospital and deceased wont support R as most COVID-19 positive cases recover
without entering hospital. Considering this data problem, it is extremely difficult to fit SEIR models
satisfactorily. Considering such challenges, for future research, the ability of machine learning for
estimation of the missing information on the number of exposed E or infecteds can be evaluated.
Along with the prediction of the outbreak, prediction of the total mortality rate (n(deaths) /
n(infecteds)) is also essential to accurately estimate the number of potential patients with the in the
critical situation and the required beds in intensive care units. Although the research is in the very

early stage, the trend in outbreak prediction with machine learning can be classified in two directions.
Firstly, improvement of the SIR-based models, e.g., [53,58], and secondly time-series prediction
[59,60]. Consequently, the state-of-the-art machine learning methods for outbreak modeling suggest
two major research gaps for machine learning to address. Firstly, improvement of SIR-based models
and secondly advancement in outbreak time series. Considering the drawbacks of the SIR-based
models, machine learning should be able to contribute. This paper contributes to the advancement of
time-series modelling and prediction of COVID-19. Although ML has long been established as a
standard tool for modeling natural disasters and weather forecasting [61-65], its application in
modeling outbreak is still in the early stages. More sophisticated ML methods are yet to be explored.
A recent paper by Ardabili et al, [50], explored the potential of MLP and ANFIS in time series
prediction of COVID-19 in several countries. Contribution of the present paper is to improve the
quality of prediction through proposing a hybrid machine learning and compare the results with
ANFIS. In the present paper the time series of the total mortality is also included.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section two describes the methods and materials.
The results are given in section three. Sections four presents conclusions.

2.2 Methods and modeling strategy
In the present study, modeling is performed by machine learning methods. Training is the basis of
these methods as well as many artificial intelligence (AI) methods

[66,67]. According to some

psychologists, humans or living things interact with their surroundings by trial and error and achieve
the best performance to reach a goal. Based on this theory and using the ability of computers to repeat
a set of instructions, these conditions can be provided for computer programs to interact with the
environment by updating values and optimizing functions, according to the results of interaction
with the environment to solve a problem or achieve a specific goal. How to update values and
parameters in successive repetitions by a computer is called a training algorithm [68-70]. One of these
methods is Neural Networks (NN), according to which the modeling of the connection of neurons in
the human brain, software programs were designed to solve various problems. To solve these
problems, operational NN such as classification, clustering, or function approximation are performed
using appropriate learning methods [71,72]. The training of the algorithm is the initial and the
important step for developing a model [73,74]. Developing a predictive AI model requires a dataset
categorized into two sections i.e. input(s) (as independent variable(s)) and output(s) (as dependent
variable(s)) [75].
In the present study, time-series data have been considered as the independent variables for the
prediction of COVID-19 cases and mortality rate (as dependent variables). Time-series dataset was
prepared based on two scenarios as described in table 1. The first scenario categorizes the time-series
data into four inputs for the last four consequently odd days’ cases or mortality rate for the prediction
of xt as the next day’s case or mortality rate, and the second scenario categorizes the time-series data
into four inputs for the last four consequently even days’ cases or mortality rate for the prediction of
xt as the next day’s case or mortality rate.

In the present study the two robust hybrid methods of ANN algorithm i.e. MLP-ICA and ANFIS
have been employed for developing the required models. The dataset is devised into two parts. One
part is devoted to training and the second part, i.e., 20-28 April, is devoted to model validation.
2.2.1 Hybrid multi layered perceptron-imperialist competitive algorithm (MLP-ICA)
Multi-layered-perceptron (MLP) is the frequently used ANN method for the prediction and modeling
purposes. This technique as a single method provides an acceptable accuracy for prediction tasks in
simple and semi-complex dataset. But, in case of doing modeling tasks in complex dataset, there is a
need for more robust techniques [76,77]. For this reason, hybrid methods have been growing up
[76,77]. Hybrid methods contain a predictor and one or more optimizer [76,77]. The present study
develops a hybrid MLP-ICA method as a robust hybrid algorithm for developing a platform for
predicting the COVID-19 cases and mortality rate in Hungary. The ICA is a method in the field of
evolutionary calculations that seeks to find the optimal answer to various optimization problems.
This algorithm, by mathematical modeling, provides a socio-political evolutionary algorithm for
solving mathematical optimization problems [78]. Like the all algorithms in this category, the ICA
constitutes a primary set of possible answers. These answers are known as countries in the ICA. The
ICA gradually improves the initial responses (countries) and ultimately provides the appropriate
answer to the optimization problem [78,79].
The algorithms are based on the policy of assimilation, imperialist competition and revolution.
This algorithm, by imitating the process of social, economic, and political development of countries
and by mathematical modeling of parts of this process, provides operators in the form of a regular
algorithm that can help to solve complex optimization problems [78,80]. In fact, this algorithm looks
at the answers to the optimization problem in the form of countries and tries to gradually improve
these answers during a repetitive process and eventually reach the optimal answer to the problem
[78,80]. In the Nvar dimension optimization problem, a country is an array of Nvar × 1 length. This
array is defined as follows:
𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑦 = [𝑝1, 𝑝2, … , 𝑝𝑁𝑣𝑎𝑟].

(5)

To start the algorithm, the country number of the initial country is created (Ncountry). To select the
Nimp as the best members of the population (countries with the lowest amount of cost function) as
imperialists. The rest of the Ncol countries, form colonies belonging to an empire. To divide the early
colonies between the imperialists, imperialist owns number of colonies, the number of which is
proportional to its power [78,80]. The following figure symbolically shows how the colonies are
divided among the colonial powers.

Figure 3. The initial empires generation [78]
The integration of this model with the neural network causes the error in the network to be
defined as a cost function, and with the changes in weights and biases, the output of the network
improves and the resulting error decreases [81]. The most important factors in training an ANN-ICA
method are containing the number of countries, imperialists and decades and the number of neurons
in the hidden layer which can be defined by different ways. One of the common ways for defining
them is trial and error.
In the present study, inputs and outputs of each scenario where imported to the model. The
number of countries, imperialists and decades have been defined by trial and error. For developing
MLP model three architectures including 4-10-1, 4-14-1 and 4-18-1 (with 10, 14 and 18 neurons in the
hidden layer, respectively).

2.2.2 ANFIS
An adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is a type of artificial neural network based on the
Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy system [82,83]. This method was developed in the early 1990s. Since this system
integrates neural networks and concepts of fuzzy logic, it can take advantage of the capabilities of
both methods. It has nonlinear functions [82,83]. Figure 4 presents the architecture of the developed
ANFIS model.

Figure 4. the architecture of the developed ANFIS

As is clear from Figure 4, ANFIS has five main layers [84-86]. The first layer is the inputs layer
which takes the parameters and imports them to the model. This layer is also called as the input layer
of the fuzzy system. The outputs of the first layer imports to the second layer and carries prior values
of membership functions (MFs). Fuzzy rules are concluded from the nodes on second layer related
degree of activity. The third layer normalizes the degree of activity of any rules. The fourth layer
adopts the nodes and function and produces the outputs [87] and send them to the output layer. The
important factors for determining the accuracy of ANFIS is the number and type of MFs, the optimum
method and the output MF type [88-92].
ANFIS model was developed by ANFIS toolbox on MATLAB. Input parameters were
independent variables of each scenario and the output variable was the number of cases or mortality
rate. The ANFIS model was trained with three triangular, trapoizidal and gaussian MFs. This step
was performed in order to select the best MF. The output membership function type selected linear
type Because of its ability to further reduce of errors. Training of FIS was done with backpropagation
optimum method and 0 value of error tolerance.

2.2.3 Evaluation criteria
Evaluations were conducted by determination coefficient, root mean square error and mean
absolute percentage error values. These factors compare the target and output values and calculates a
score as an index for the performance and accuracy of the developed methods [93,94]. Table 2 presents
the evaluation criteria equations.

3. Results
The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using both training and validation data. The
training data are used to train the algorithm and define the best set of parameters to be used in ANFIS
and MLP-ICA. After that, the best setup for each algorithm is used to predict outbreaks on the
validation samples. Worth mentioning that due to the lack of adequate sample data to avoid the
overfitting, the training is used to evaluate the model with higher performance.
3.1 Training results
The training step for ANFIS was performed by employing three MF types as described in tables 3
and 4. Table 3 presents the training results of ANFIS for COVID-19 cases and Table 4 presents the
training results of ANFIS for COVID-19 mortality rate in Hungary. As is clear, results have been
compared using evaluation metrics of RMSE and MAPE. According to Table 3, Gaussian MF type
with MF number 3, BP optimum method and linear output MF provided the highest performance by
the lowest value of RMSE. On the other hand, as is clear scenario 1 provided the lowest RMSE in
comparison with scenario 2 for the selected MF. Therefore, it can be concluded that, scenario 1 is
suitable for modeling COVID-19 cases in comparison with scenario 2.

According to Table 4, it can be claimed that Gaussian MF provided the lowest error and highest
accuracy compared with other MF types for the prediction of mortality rate. Also it can be claimed
that, for the selected MF type, scenario 2 provides the highest performance compared with scenario
1 for the prediction of mortality rate.

Tables 5 and 6 presents results for the prediction of COVID-19 cases and mortality rate, respectively
by MLP-ICA. According to Table 5, MLP architecture with 10 neurons in the hidden layer provided
the highest accuracy for the prediction of COVID-19 cases in the presence of both scenarios. But,
Scenario 2 provided higher accuracy than scenario 1 according to the lowest RMSE value.

According to Table 6, neuron number 14 for scenario 1 and neuron number 18 for scenario 2 provided
the highest accuracy in integrating by ICA method in comparison with other architectures. By
comparing the evaluation criteria values, it can be concluded that, scenario 1 is more suitable than
scenario 2 for the prediction of mortality rate using MLP-ICA.

Figure 3 presents the plot diagram for the selected models according to Table 3 to 6. In these figures,
the vertical axis is “Target values” or in another word the actual values and the horizontal axis is the
“predicted values” or in another word the output value of the model. In these plots, the dash-line is
the 1:1 line. The distance of each point from the dash-line discusses the accuracy of the prediction.
Such that, points on dash-line have the minimum error and increases the determination coefficient
and points those that have distance from dash line increases the error and reduces the accuracy in
accordance with its distance and reduces the determination coefficient.
As is clear from Figure 5, ANN provides a higher determination coefficient (0.9963, 0.9963, 0.9987
and 0.9987, respectively for the prediction of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 mortality rate in the
presence of scenario 1 and scenario (see the Figure 5)) than ANFIS. Also, the ability of ANN in the
prediction of COVID-19 mortality rate is higher than that for the prediction of COVID-19 cases. But,
ANFIS provides a little difference behavior than ANN. Such that, in ANFIS scenario 1 provides the
highest determination coefficient for the prediction of COVID-19 cases but scenario 2 provides the
highest correlation coefficient for the prediction of mortality rate (0.9689, 0.934, 0.8909 and 0.9427,
respectively for the prediction of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 mortality rate in the presence of
scenario 1 and scenario (see the Figure 5)).

5. Discussions
This approach outperforms commonly used prediction tools in the case of Hungary. More work is
required if this technique is adequate in all cases and for different population types and sizes.
Nonetheless, the learning approach could overcome imperfect input data. Incomplete catalogs can
occur because infected persons are asymptotic, not tested, or not listed in databases. Tests in a closed
environment such as large aircraft carriers in France and the US have shown that up to 60% of the
infected personnel were asymptomatic. Of course, military personals are not representative of large
and mixed populations. Nonetheless, it shows that false negatives can be abundant. In emerging
countries, access to laboratory equipment required for testing is extremely limited. This will
introduce a bias in the counting. Finally, it is unclear if all the cases are registered. In the UK for
example, it took public pressure for the government to make the casualties in retirement hospices
known. And there is still doubt in the community that China produced complete data for political
reasons. At the same time, national governments and local administrations implemented
containment measures such as confinement and social distancing. These actions have a huge impact
on transmissions and thus on cases and casualties. Access to modern medical facilities is also a
parameter that mainly affects the number of casualties. All these aspects will affect traditional
estimation procedures whereas learning algorithms might be able to adapt, especially if multiple
datasets are available for a given region. Not only can our approach outperform the commonly used
SIR but it requires fewer input data to estimate the trends. While we provide successful results for
Hungarian data we need to further test these novel approaches on other databases. Nonetheless, the
presented results are promising and should incite the community to implement these new tools
rapidly.
4. Conclusions
Although SIR-based models been widely used for modeling the COVID-19 outbreak, they include
some degree of uncertainties. Several advancements are emerging to improve the quality of SIRbased models suitable to COVID-19 outbreak. As an alternative to the SIR-based models, this study
proposed machine learning as a new trend in advancing outbreak models. The machine learning
approach makes no assumption on the pandemic and spread of the infection. Instead it predicts the
time series of the infected cases as well as total mortality cases.
In this study the hybrid machine learning model of MLP-ICA and ANFIS are used to predict the
COVID-19 outbreak in Hungary. The models predict that by late May the outbreak and the total
morality will drop substantially. Based on the results reported here, and due to the complex nature
of the COVID-19 outbreak and variation in its behavior from nation-to-nation, this study suggests
machine learning as an effective tool to model the outbreak. Two scenarios were proposed. Scenario
1 considered sampling the odd days and Scenario 2 used even days for training the data. Training
the two machine learning models ANFIS and MLP-ICA were considered for the two scenarios. A
detailed investigation was also carried out to explore the most suitable number of neurons.
Furthermore, the performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using both training and
validation data. The training data are used to train the algorithm and define the best set of parameters
to be used in ANFIS and MLP-ICA. After that, the best setup for each algorithm is used to predict
outbreaks on the validation samples. The validation is performed for nine days with promising
results which confirms the model accuracy. In this study due to the lack of adequate sample data to
avoid the overfitting, the training is used to choose and evaluate the model with higher performance.
In the future research, as the COVID-19 progress in time and with the availability of more sample
data further testing and validation can be used to better evaluate the models.

Both models showed promising results in terms of predicting the time series without the
assumptions that epidemiological models require. Both machine learning models, as an alternative
to epidemiological models, showed potential in predicting COVID-19 outbreak as well as estimating
total mortality. Yet, MLP-ICA outperformed ANFIS with delivering accurate results on validation
samples. Considering the availability of a small amount of training data, further investigation would
be essential to explore the true capability of the proposed hybrid model. It is expected that the model
maintains its accuracy as long as no major interruption occurs. For instance, if other outbreaks would
initiate in the other cities, or the prevention regime changes, naturally the model will not maintain its
accuracy. For the future studies advancing the deep learning and deep reinforcement learning models
is strongly encouraged for comparative studies on various ML models for individual countries.
