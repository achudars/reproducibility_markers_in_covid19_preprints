ABSTRACT

21
22

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has presented new challenges to food manufacturers. In addition

23

to preventing the spread of microbial contamination of food, with SARS-CoV-2, there is an

24

additional focus on preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections in food plant personnel. During the early

25

phase of the pandemic, several large outbreaks of Covid-19 occurred in food manufacturing

26

plants resulting in deaths and economic loss. In March of 2020, we assisted in implementation

27

of environmental monitoring programs for SARS-CoV-2 in 116 food production facilities. All

28

participating facilities had already implemented measures to prevent symptomatic personnel

29

from coming to work. During the study period, from March 17, 2020 to September 3, 2020,

30

1.23% of the 22,643 environmental samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that

31

infected individuals are actively shedding virus. Virus contamination was commonly found on

32

frequently touched surfaces. Most plants managed to control their environmental contamination

33

when they became aware of the positive findings. Comparisons of the personnel test results to

34

environmental contamination in one plant showed a good correlation between the two. Our work

35

illustrates that environmental monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 can be used as a surrogate for

36

identifying the presence of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic personnel in workplaces and

37

may aid in controlling infection spread.

Introduction

46
47

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a highly infectious

48

novel coronavirus, which originated from a food market in Wuhan, China, in December 2019,

49

has caused a global pandemic (3). As of November 1st, 2020, there have been nearly 46 million

50

confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with 1.2 million deaths globally (12).

51
52

The transmission of COVID-19 is facilitated mainly through direct personal contact and

53

respiratory droplets (1). Additionally, contaminated surfaces were also reported as another

54

mode of transmission (5, 6). SARS-CoV-2 remains viable on surfaces for days (9). The virus is

55

reported to be stable on surfaces such as metal, glass and plastic for up to 9 days (4). Surface

56

disinfection with 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite can

57

efficiently inactive the virus within 1 minute (4).

58
59

During the early phase of the pandemic, high SARS-CoV-2 positive rates among

60

environmental surfaces were associated with a large number of COVID-19 cases in places such

61

as hospitals and living spaces (13). At one hospital in Italy, air and surfaces had the most

62

positives within the areas designated for patients (7). In a study of 112 surface samples taken

63

from the living quarters of 13 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, Wei et al. (11) found that

64

44 (39.3%) of the samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Research on built environments

65

emphasized the importance of proper disinfection of toilet areas, sanitization of surfaces, open

66

space, and window ventilation which can effectively limit the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 (6)

67
68
69

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA (CDC), of the
130,578 people employed in the food industry who were tested for COVID-19 in April, 3% tested

positive (2). In a more comprehensive analysis, the CDC analyzed Covid-19 infections in the

71

food industry in 30 states spanning a period from March to May of 2020. Results showed that

72

some food plants had infection rates as high as 43%. Most workers who were Covid-19 positive

73

were ethnic minorities (83.2%). The asymptomatic rate was about 15%, indicating that

74

screening for Covid-19 symptoms alone is not adequate to combat infection spread (10).

75

Although it is highly likely that airborne transmission substantially contributed to observed

76

infection outcomes in the CDC study, transmission could have additionally occurred through

77

SARS-CoV-2 contaminated surfaces (8). However, the extent of virus contamination in the food

78

industry has not been reported yet. Here we present the analysis of 22,643 surface samples

79

from food processing facilities in the USA, tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Such

80

data can help food manufacturing plants to evaluate their decontamination protocols and can be

81

used as a surveillance method for detecting viral shedding from asymptomatic/presymptomatic

82

infections among workers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

85
86

Environmental Sampling. IEH SARS-CoV-2 Surface Swab Kits (P/N: PS-S02;

87

Microbiologique Inc., Lake City Way NE, WA) were used for sampling environmental surfaces.

88

Sampling was performed according to the manufacturer’s instruction by plant personnel. The

89

sampling buffer impregnated swab was applied to designated areas, which were thoroughly

90

swabbed before the swab was transferred to a transport vial containing viral transport medium

91

(VTM). The vials were packed, labeled, and shipped to Molecular Epidemiology Inc. (Lake

92

Forest Park, WA, USA) for testing.

94

RNA Extraction. Total nucleic acids were extracted and purified from environmental

95

swabs using the IEH Nucleic Acid Extraction Reagent Kit (P/N: PM-23; Microbiologique Inc.,

96

Seattle, WA, USA) in an automated KingFisher-96 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA,

97

USA) nucleic acid purification system. MS2–RPP, an engineered MS2 phage particle

98

encapsulating an RNA fragment from the human ribonuclease P gene (RNase P), served as the

99

extraction control for RNA extraction and was processed with every set of samples.

100
101

RT-PCR. The IEH SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Test kit (P/N: PM-22; Microbiologique, Seattle,

102

WA, USA) was used for the detection of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 in environmental samples. This

103

test kit was derived from the SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test “CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-

104

nCoV) RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel”, developed by the CDC. This kit contains N1, N2 and RPP

105

primer/probe sets to detect the viral nucleocapsid gene and the human RNase P RNA (internal

106

control).

107
108

Clinical specimen analysis. Clinical specimens from Establishment E were processed

109

at the CLIA certified laboratory of Molecular Epidemiology Inc. (Lake Forest Park, WA, USA)

110

using the same RNA extraction method and the RT-PCR method and using N1/RPP and N2

111

primers/probes.

112
113

Data analysis. The cycle threshold (Ct) values from the RT-PCR results were used as

114

indicators of the copy number of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in environmental samples with lower cycle

115

threshold values corresponding to higher viral copy numbers. Descriptive statistical analyses

116

were performed for both environmental data and clinical data by using SigmaPlot 14.0 (Systat

117

Software, Inc).

RESULTS

120
121

A total of 22,643 environmental samples with source information were received between

122

March 17th, 2020 and September 3rd, 2020 from 116 food manufacturing plants. Of these, 278

123

environmental samples (1.23%) were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the study

124

period (Table 1). Samples were analyzed by grouping into workplace source and surface types.

125

Workplace sources were divided into three groups: welfare area, working area, and entrance.

126

The welfare area and working areas had swabs that came from distinctly different locations

127

based on usage and were thus subdivided. The welfare area was split into three categories,

128

which were bathrooms, lunchrooms, and locker rooms. The working area comprised of

129

office/conference rooms, training rooms, and receiving rooms. The entrance and other ingress

130

points had the highest occurrence of positive SARS-CoV-2 swabs among tested areas, with a

131

frequency of 1.57% (38/2439) (Table 1). There were 32 out of 2255 (1.42%) positive samples

132

reported in the working area group, with 25/1883 (1.33%) positive from office/conference rooms

133

and 1/265 (0.38%) positive from training rooms. The receiving room showed the highest

134

positivity rate of 5.61% (6/107). An overall total of 1.36% (139/10226) of samples were positive

135

in the welfare area, where bathrooms, lunchrooms, and locker rooms tested positive with

136

percentages of 1.17% (31/2640), 1.33% (70/5260), and 1.63% (38/2326), respectively.

137
138

We also analyzed what surface types were more abundant with the virus (summarized in

139

Table 2). Among the positive samples, 46 (16.55%) had no specified surface information, and

140

93 (33.45%) were found on doorknobs/handles, the surface with the highest positive frequency

141

rate. Other surfaces that frequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 included tables/counters

142

(21), computer devices (20), sanitizer-dispensers (17), switches (12), rails (12), chairs/benches

143

(11) and timeclocks (10). There were 36 positive samples found on other surfaces.

144
145

We next analyzed to what extent these 116 food processing plants were affected. Figure

146

2 shows the frequency distribution of the percentage of positive cases for each individual plant.

147

A total of 53% (62/116) of food plants had at least one positive sample through the

148

observational period. The positive rate of individual plants ranged from 0% to 30% with a

149

median level of 0.25%.

150
151

As the time progressed from the early phase of the pandemic in February, almost all

152

food manufacturing companies implemented a variety of safety measures such as vigorous

153

decontamination, mandatory personal protective equipment, symptom screening, and SARS-

154

CoV-2 screening. We therefore undertook a longitudinal observational study of five companies

155

for timeline data analysis to determine the outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 preventive measures

156

(Figure 2). During the study period (March 17th-September 3rd, 2020), 1477, 1577, 912, 867 and

157

433 surface specimens were received from establishments A, B, C, D and E, respectively. A

158

decreasing trend of daily positive rate was observed in establishments A, B and E after reaching

159

peaks on 5/9/2020, 5/19/2020 and 5/7/2020. The other two establishments continued to have

160

sporadic findings of environmental contamination with the virus.

161
162

Establishment E additionally submitted 1248 human nasopharyngeal specimens from

163

plant personnel for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis from May 4th to June 18th, 2020. Our results

164

indicated that 10.90% of human samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3). This

165

indicated that even with screening for symptomatic individuals and strict environmental

166

decontaminations, asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals presumably contaminated

167

their surroundings with the virus.

DISCUSSION

170
171

The goal of our study was to provide a tool for monitoring the presence of SARS-CoV-2

172

in food production facilities. Environmental monitoring for foodborne pathogens such as Listeria

173

and Salmonella are routinely conducted in food production facilities to document the sanitary

174

conditions under which food is produced. The environmental monitoring results provide a

175

constant feedback to the sanitation and food safety teams, based on which they can take

176

corrective actions. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has presented a new challenge to food

177

manufacturers. While food production is focused on preventing the spread of microbial

178

contamination of foods, with SARS-CoV-2, there is an additional focus on operating while

179

protecting personnel from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Early on, consensus were developed around

180

using personal protective equipment (face masks, face shields, gloves, plastic and Plexiglas

181

barriers), health monitoring of the personnel, reducing density in otherwise crowded areas,

182

frequent sanitation of surfaces, closing down or reducing the capacity in break rooms, contact

183

tracing, quarantine of exposed personnel, and testing.

184
185

Currently there is not much information available about the level of work-place

186

contamination due to asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic COVID-19 infections. In March of

187

2020 we assisted in implementation of environmental monitoring programs for SARS-CoV-2 in

188

several food production facilities. All facilities had implemented measures to prevent

189

symptomatic/pre-symptomatic personnel from coming to work. During the study period 278 of

190

the 22,643 samples (1.23%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. 62 of the 116 food production

191

facilities had at least one positive sample for SARS-CoV-2. Among the production facilities the

192

rate of positive samples ranged from 0-30%.

194

The data (Table 1 and 2) clearly show that all frequently touched areas can be expected

195

to have contamination. Door knobs/handles had the highest rate of contamination (33.5%),

196

followed by computers, desks/tables, sanitizer dispensers, hand rails, switches, chairs/benches,

197

and timeclocks. Figure 2 shows the course of contamination in five plants over the study period.

198

As environmental contamination with SARS-CoV-2 is a reflection of the infection among

199

personnel, it is to be expected that contamination would be detected sporadically over time. In

200

establishments A and B contamination was detected early on, and all subsequent samples were

201

negative for SARS-CoV-2 virus. While in the other establishments the viral contamination

202

appears and disappears over time. Although a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test of an

203

environmental sample does not necessarily mean that the sampling site is contaminated with

204

infectious viral particles, it is a clear indication of active shedding of the virus by infected

205

individuals. SARS-CoV-2 contamination occurred even with decontamination protocols

206

implemented in place, indicating that they were inadequate. During the course of this study, our

207

findings enabled all participating production facilities to fine-tune their COVID safety protocols

208

and helped them make decisions regarding personnel testing.

209
210

In Establishment E where we performed environmental testing, initial high positive rates

211

(~40%) prompted testing of personnel. Comparisons of the human and environmental samples

212

taken in the same facility at the same time showed that 10.90% of human and 8.54% of the

213

environmental samples were positive for the virus. This shows that in the absence of personnel

214

testing, environmental testing for SARS-CoV-2 could indicate active human infections.

215
216

Our results clearly show that monitoring for the SARS-CoV-19 in work places can be a

217

valuable tool in the control of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The limitation of the study is that

218

we were not able to determine the role of the environmental contamination in the spread of the
