Abstract

In this work, we use a classical SIR model to study COVID-19 pandemic. We aim to deal with
the SIR model tting to COVID-19 data by using dierent technics and tools. We particularly
use two ways: the rst one start by tting the total number of the conrmed cases and the
second use a parametric solver tool. Finally a comparative forecasting, machine learning tools,
is given.

Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has to get the attention of all scientists

around the world.

The COVID-19 appears in November 2019 in Wuhan, central China.

In

March 2020, the epidemic was reclassied as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in many other countries. Measures, limiting humanto-human contact (social distancing, barrier measures, connement), are taken to stem the spread,
causing a sudden slowdown in the world economy and a stock market crash on March 12, 2020. The
COVID-19 is contagious with human-to-human transmission. The incubation period is generally
between two and fourteen days, with an average of ve days.
Many researchers have used new or classical models of infectious diseases to describe, study or
predict the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic.
In this work, we aim to use the well known classical SIR model[Anderson and May, 1991], [Hethcote, 2000],
to t it to world data of COVID-19. We discuss and apply dierent methods and show numerical
results. The methods consist in rst to use the work in [Liu, Magal, Seydi and Webb, 2020] which
start by tting the total number of the conrmed cases and in second to use parametric solver.
SIR stands for Susceptible-Infected-Removed. If we consider that all removed individuals are the
recovered individuals, then we can say Susceptible-Infected-Recovered.
In this paper, we rst introduce the classical mathematical SIR models we use to t COVID-19
data. In the second we present dierent mechanisms we use to t the data. Then we show numerical
results. And nally, we show some prediction for Senegal of the SIR models we study compared
with forecasting using machine learning.

The classical SIR model is given as follow:

S(t), I(t), R(t) being respectively the number of susceptible individut and the number of recovered individuals
unknowns S(t), I(t), R(t) satisfy N = S(t) + I(t) + R(t). N is the total

with the dependent variables

als at time t, the number of infectious individuals at time
at time t. In addition, the
number of individuals.
The initial conditions are

S(0) = S0 â‰¥ 0, I(0) = I0 â‰¥ 0 and R(0) = R0 â‰¥ 0.
Î² is the contact rate, 1/Î³ is the average

Some parameters must be presented:

R0 = Î²/Î³

infectious period,

is the basic reproduction number.

The SIR model satises some properties:

R0
(Râˆž âˆ’ R0 )) as t â†’ âˆž.
N
R0
â€¢ The recovered function R(t) increases up to Râˆž = N âˆ’ S0 exp(âˆ’
(Râˆž âˆ’ R0 )) as t â†’ âˆž.
N
R0 S0 N
â€¢ If R0 > N/S0 , then I(t) increases up to a maximum value Imax = I0 +S0 âˆ’(1+ln(
))
.
N
R0
â€¢ If R0 < N/S0 , then I(t) decreases to 0.
â€¢

The susceptible function

S(t)

decreases to

Sâˆž = S0 exp(âˆ’

At the outset of an epidemic, nearly everyone (except the infected case) is susceptible.
So we can say that S0 â‰ˆ N and then we can replace N/S0 by 1.
Remark II.1.

It is also possible to couple the SIR model with other dierential equations like death equation
to study the number of death due the epidemic disease or economic model equations to study the
impact of the epidemic disease on the economy. To couple the SIR model with a death equation,
we consider the death rate

Methods

i. Fitting function to data
The starting point of the work is to nd a function that ts the data of total conrmed cases. As
in [Liu, Magal, Seydi and Webb, 2020], we set the total number of infectious cases by:

Z

t

T N I(t) =

I(s)ds.

(3)

t0

T N I(t) =
b exp(ct) âˆ’ a. Where a, b, c are parameters to estimate by using the least square method. Then
with T N I(t) we can obtain information on the unknown functional variables and parameters of the

The total number of infectious cases function, that t the data, can be written as

SIR model.
After calculation as in [Liu, Magal, Seydi and Webb, 2020], we obtain:

ln(a) âˆ’ ln(b)
.
c
â€¢ I(t) = I(t0 ) exp(c(t âˆ’ t0 )),
Î³(I(t) âˆ’ I0 )
.
â€¢ R(t) =
c
c+Î³
â€¢ Î²=N
.
S0
â€¢ t0 =

with

I(t0 ) = I0 = ac.

The simulation results are given in subsection i, gure 1a, 1b, 1c and 1d. Also the values of the
parameters

Î²

and

Î³

are given.

We consider now that at a time
connement.

T

some measures are taken like social distancing, half or full

It can be interpreted as the contact rate is reduced by some factor or at a time

point, the contact rate is close to

0.

Indeed in [Liu, Magal, Seydi and Webb, 2020], the authors

considered that the transmission of COVID-19 from infectious to susceptible individuals stopped
after strong measures has been taken in China.

Then they have xed the contact rate to

0.

In

[Lauro, Kiss and Miller, 2020], the authors considered that the contact rate is reduced by some
factor when a social distancing intervention is introduced with a certain duration. Then they have
replaced

Î²

by

(1 âˆ’ c)Î² .

It is also possible to consider that

Î²

will decrease depending on time like

in [Liu, Magal, Seydi and Webb, 2020], where authors has considered an exponential decreasing
function of time.
In this work, we consider that the contact rate decreases progressively to

0.

Then we choose

continuous function with a slow decrease to describe the contact rate starting at the date-time of
the measures.
We propose two types of function for

Î²

noted

Î²Ìƒ(t).

The rst one is :

(
Î²Ìƒ(t) =
where

Î´

and

p

Îº

and

q

t âˆˆ [t0 , T ]

T
Î²( )Î´/p

if

t > T,

are parameters to choose. The second one is:

and

We show the results

in subsection i.

1. The values of the parameters Î´ , p, Îº and q can be xed such that Î²Ìƒ(t) decreases slowly.

Remark III.1.

2. Since Î²Ìƒ depends on time, we must always consider values of t such that Î²Ìƒ remains positive.
3. Î²Ìƒ given by 4 is positive for all time while Î²Ìƒ given by 5 is positive only if t âˆˆ [0, T exp((Î²q)1/Îº )].

ii. Fit to data with scaling
When there is not enough data the t is generally dicult since the maximal values of the dependent
variables can be very huge. For example,
with

N

S0

depends on the total population and generally

S0 â‰ˆ N ,

the size of a chosen sample of the population. In SIR models, it is generally possible to

choose dierent population sizes with similar characteristics. If we have characteristic measures we
can make the model dimensionless so that the quality of the results is always good. Then we scale
the SIR model to the data by using scaling [Langtangen and Pedersen, 2016].

tc , Sc , Ic , Rc respectively of the time t,
I(t) and the recovered R(t). Then the dimensionless variables
Â¯ c , R = RÌ„Rc .
t = tÌ„tc , S = SÌ„Sc , I = II

Let us x the following constant characteristics size:

and

Î³Ìƒ2 = Î³

(8)

Ic t c
.
Rc

By choosing the characteristics such that Sc = Ic = Rc , we obtain Î²Ìƒ1 = Î²Ìƒ2 and

Î³Ìƒ1 = Î³Ìƒ2 . And then we get a new SIR model.

iii. Parametric solve
We estimate the parameters

Î²

and

Î³

by using parametric solver in Mathematica. With the para-

metric solver, we solve the SIR model (2) with solutions depending on the parameters we want
to estimate such that the model ts the data. Then plotting the parametric solution for dierent
values of

Î²

and

Î³ , nally, give a t.

Parametric solver typically solve dierential equations by going

through several dierent stages, depending on the type of equations.

iv. Machine learning
Machine learning is programming computers to optimize a performance criterion using example
data or past experience.

We have a model dened up to some parameters, and learning is the

execution of a computer program to optimize the parameters of the model using the training data
or past experience. The model may be predictive to make predictions in the future, or descriptive
to gain knowledge from data or both.
Machine learning uses the theory of statistics in building mathematical models because the core
task is making inferences from a sample.(See[Alpaydin, 2010]).
Then machine learning can be used for the estimation of parameters of an epidemic model. We can
go deep by doing data mining since we have massive world data. We can use machine learning to
learn about the worldwide data of pandemic COVID-19 and then to predict the future evolution of
the disease.
We can also try to learn on the spatial distribution and progression of the disease and predict the
location susceptible to be a high level of risk.
In this work, we just use a machine learning tool to learn on small data of Senegal's COVID-19
cases and then to predict the evolution in future days. We use it as a comparison with the other
forecasts based on the work we do in this paper.

respectively of Senegal, China and France. Data for Senegal is obtained from daily press releases on

v. Discussion
The SIR model is tted to the data. This allows us to note that the maximum number of infected
can go up to

900000

(gure 7d) in Senegal and

2700000

(gure 9d) in France. While in the scaling

the gures 6a shows that the maximum number of infected can go up to

320000.

However, this

analysis does not take into account the nationwide anti-pandemic measures.
Using the results shown in the gures 2c, 2e, 2d, 2f, 4a, 4b, 5a and 5b, we can see that the data
deviate from their rst exponential evolution to follow a new, slower trajectory which can still be
exponential. To understand the nature of this new trajectory, the way to manage the contact rate
is decisive and can lead to dierent analyzes. However, having considered a slow decrease over time
of the contact rate, we can see in the gures 2e, 2f, 4b and 5b that the updated data pass under the
new trajectory for Senegal while in France the data follow the new trajectory. This could, therefore,
be due to the eects of the measures taken by these countries.

Prediction

In this section, we plot some predictions for Senegal. The prediction does not concern the total
conrmed cases, but only the eective cases obtained by reduced from the total conrmed cases,
the recovered cases and the death cases.
We show the curve of eective infected cases given by
the curve of the tted infected

(4) and (5),

in gure 7c, and the curve obtained by using machine learning.

We plot these curves with additional dates until 2020, April 21.
We use machine learning, based only on data, to do forecasting.
Predict is a function of Automated Machine Learning in Wolfram Mathematica. It allows for
automatic training and data prediction. We can choose dierent method of regression algorithm:
RandomForest, LinearRegression, NeuralNetwork, GaussianProcess, NearestNeighbors, etc.
We use the NeuralNetwork regression algorithm which predicts using an articial neural network.
Let's recall that our forecasting use in a rst part the results of the works in subsection i,ii and iii
where we use a SIR model to t data. And in a second part, the forecasting using only data.
The forecasting show in gures 10a, 10c an optimistic situation for Senegal.

pandemic measures in Senegal. In addition, we have considered in gures 10a and 10b a contact
rate gradually reduced since the measures were taken and we see that the data come below the
path of the predicted curve.

Conclusion and Perspectives

In this paper, we have used the classical SIR model for tting data and then we have done forecasting. We have also estimated the contact rate, and the average infectious period parameters of
the SIR model to obtain t. Machine learning can help in epidemiology to understand the disease,
but also to study the impact or eectiveness of the anti-pandemic measures taken.
We can also study the ideal date for stopping the containment measures. Ideal in the sense that
even without the measures the disease can no longer spread. We can also study the possibility of
making periodic connements to reduce the economic impact of the measures. The economy may be
impacted by the evolution of the disease and measures. It would, therefore, be interesting to couple
economic models with epidemiological models. Since the impact can also be long-term, scaling can
be used to dimension the epidemiological-economic coupling.

The impact of the environment is

also to be taken into account in the models. This means studying the contamination due to the
environment (air, objects, etc).

i. Using function t in SIR model
From

T N I(t) = b exp(ct) âˆ’ a,

we have

T N I(t0 ) = b exp(ct0 ) âˆ’ a

and using (3), we obtain

b exp(ct0 ) âˆ’ a = 0.
We deduce

a = b exp(ct0 ),

then

t0 =

(9)

ln(a) âˆ’ ln(b)
.

Again from (3) we have

Ë™ I(t) = bc exp(ct).
I(t) = T N
Then

I(t0 ) = bc exp(ct0 ) = ac = I0

and

I(t)
= exp(c(t âˆ’ t0 )).
I(t0 )

I(t) = I(t0 ) exp(c(t âˆ’ t0 )),
then

Hence, we obtain

From the second equation in the SIR model (1), we obtain at

Using the third equation in the SIR model (1) yields

RÌ‡(t) = Î³I(t0 ) exp(c(t âˆ’ t0 )),
then integrating, we obtain

R(t) =

Î³
(I(t) âˆ’ I(t0 )).
