Abstract

33

Objectives: Italy has been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic,

34

becoming the nation with the third highest death toll in the world as of May 10th, 2020. We

35

analyzed the severity of COVID-19 pandemic across 20 Italian regions.

36

Method: We manually retrieved the daily cumulative numbers of laboratory-confirmed cases

37

and deaths attributed to COVID-19 across 20 Italian regions. For each region, we estimated

38

the crude case fatality ratio and time-delay adjusted case fatality ratio (aCFR). We then

39

assessed the association between aCFR and sociodemographic, health care and transmission

40

factors using multivariate regression analysis.

41

Results: The overall aCFR in Italy was estimated at 17.4%. Lombardia exhibited the highest

42

aCFR (24.7%) followed by Marche (19.3%), Emilia Romagna (17.7%) and Liguria (17.6%).

43

Our aCFR estimate was greater than 10% for 12 regions. Our aCFR estimates were

44

statistically associated with population density and cumulative morbidity rate in a

45

multivariate analysis.

46

Conclusion: Our aCFR estimates for overall Italy and for 7 out of 20 regions exceeded those

47

reported for the most affected region in China. Our findings highlight the importance of

48

social distancing to suppress incidence and reduce the death risk by preventing saturating the

49

health care system.

Introduction

54

Since the first COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, China, the virus rapidly spread throughout China,

55

and subsequently spread across all continents of the world. As of May 10, 2020 a total of

56

3,917,366 confirmed COVID-19 cases including 274,361 deaths have been recorded globally

57

with 215 countries/territories/areas reporting variable disease growth rates.1 Moreover, the

58

US has reported the highest number of cases (31.8%) and the highest death toll (27.5%).1

59
60

The severity impact of any pandemic situation like COVID-19 largely depends on the

61

transmission rate of the disease, the capacity of the health care system, and the spectrum of

62

clinical severity which is tied to socio-demographic factors (age, gender) and the underlying

63

prevalence of comorbidities in the population.2 A better understanding of the expected influx

64

of severe patients to the health care system during the coronavirus pandemic in different

65

areas of the world is key to anticipate medical resources such as ICU units and ventilators

66

which are critically needed to save the lives of severely ill patients.2-4

67
68

The case fatality ratio (CFR) is one of the most important epidemiological metrics to quantify

69

the clinical severity of emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19. 3, 5, 6 So far, several

70

studies have attempted to elucidate the CFR for different population segments and

71

geographic regions particularly based on epidemiological data from China.7-9 However, there

72

is still a scarcity of studies carefully estimating the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in

73

populations outside China. Accumulating epidemiological data indicates that the CFR varies

74

by geographical location, intensity of transmission, characteristics of patients such as age,

75

sex, and comorbidity status.8 For example, the time-delay adjusted CFR (aCFR) for Wuhan

76

was estimated at 12.2% compared to 4.2% for Hubei province excluding Wuhan and 0.9% in

77

China excluding Hubei province.6 While rough differences in severity of the pandemic in

78

different countries have been highlighted,9 there is a need to quantify spatial variability in

79

CFR and investigate how this variability is influenced by population factors and the

80

characteristics of the health care system.

81
82

At the time of writing, Italy was exhibiting an alarming effect of the COVID-19 pandemic

83

with the third highest death toll after the US and the UK1 but the estimates of the CFR that

84

carefully account for the delay from onset of symptoms to death are not yet available. In this

85

study we provide estimates of the COVID-19 CFR across 20 Italian regions by linking

86

statistical methods with publicly available daily series of confirmed cases and deaths. We

87

also investigated the association between aCFR and sociodemographic, health care and

88

transmission related factors using regression analysis.

Methods

90

Study setting

91

Italy is located in Southern Europe and there are 20 administrative regions in the country:

92

Lombardia, Emilia Romagna, Veneto, Piemonte, Marche, Toscana, Lazio, Campania,

93

Liguria, Friuli V.G., Sicilia, Puglia, Umbria, Molise, Trentino-Alto Adige, Abruzzo, Valle

94

d'Aosta, Sardegna, Calabria, Basilicata.10 For this study we have conducted a separate

95

analysis for Trento and Bolzano provinces within Trentino-Alto Adige region based on data

96

availability.

97
98

The first two confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy were reported on 31st January 2020 and

99

had a travel history to Wuhan, China. The third case was not confirmed until February 7 and

100

on February 22, the cumulative case count reached 9. Subsequently, the incidence trajectory

rapidly increased for about 8 weeks and then gradually started to decline11 with daily reported

102

incidence below 2000 cases since 30 April 2020.12

103

Data sources

104

We manually retrieved the daily cumulative numbers of laboratory confirmed COVID-19

105

cases and deaths stratified for 21 Italian regions from the daily released report of the Ministry

106

of Health of Italy from March 2 to May 10, 2020.12

107

For each region, we retrieved major socio-demographic and healthcare variables to explore

108

their influence on the estimated COVID-19 aCFR across areas. We also incorporated the total

109

number of tests, the total number of tests per population size and two transmission-related

110

metrics: the cumulative morbidity (cumulative cases) and the cumulative morbidity rate

111

calculated as the cumulative cases divided by the local population size. These variables are

112

summarized in Table S2.

113

Statistical analysis

114

The crude CFR (cCFR) is defined as the number of cumulative deaths divided by the number

115

of cumulative cases at a specific point in time. For the estimation of CFR in real time, we

116

employed the delay from hospitalization to death, hs, which is assumed to be given by hs =

117

H(s) – H(s-1) for s>0 where H(s) is a cumulative density function of the delay from

118

hospitalization to death and follows a gamma distribution with mean 10.1 days and SD 5.4

119

days, obtained from the previously published paper.6 Let πa,ti be the time-delay adjusted case

120

fatality ratio on reported day ti in area a, the likelihood function of the estimate πa,ti is

122

cumulative number of deaths until reported day ti in area a.13, 14 Among the cumulative cases

123

with reported day t in area a, Da,ti have died and the remainder have survived the infection.

124

The contribution of those who have died with biased death risk is shown in the middle

term. We assume that Da,ti is the result of the binomial sampling process with probability πa,ti.

127

We estimated model parameters using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) method in a

128

Bayesian framework. Posterior distributions of the model parameters were estimated by

129

sampling from the three Markov chains. Convergence of MCMC chains were evaluated using

130

the potential scale reduction statistic.15, 16 Estimates and 95% credibility intervals for these

131

estimates are based on the posterior probability distribution of each parameter and based on

132

the samples drawn from the posterior distributions.

We employed multiple linear regression models to evaluate the association between regional

As of May 10, a total of 219,070 cases and 30,560 deaths due to COVID-19 have been

141

reported in Italy. Moreover, the Lombardia region has reported the highest number of cases

142

at 81,507 (32.7%) and deaths at 14,986 (49.0%) followed by Emilia Romagna with 26796

143

(12.2%) cases and 3845 (12.6%) deaths, and Piemonte with 28665 (13.1%) cases and 3367

144

(11.0%) deaths.

deaths increased rapidly in the Lombardia, Emilia Romagna, and Pimonte regions.

153

Figure 3 and 4 illustrate observed and model based posterior estimates of the cCFR and aCFR

154

in different regions in Italy. Except for the initial days (first 5 days) our model based cCFR

155

fitted the observed data well. For the aCFR, our model based posterior estimates are higher

156

than the observed cCFR. Across most of the regions of Italy, the differences between cCRF

157

and aCFR are greater in the initial 3-4 weeks and then slowly declining difference in the later

158

stage of the epidemic. For the most affected Lombardia region, the aCFR was stable at

159

highest point (100%) during the first 7 days (considering March 1st as day 1) and rapidly

160

declined to 50% by day 15 and thereafter exhibited a gradual decline (about 25% by day 40).

161

We saw a similar trend for Emilia Romagna and for the national level. For other regions such

162

as Veneto, Marche the initial stable period was absent. For Toscana, Campania, Sicilia,

163

Umbria, Molise, and Basilicata, the cCFR and aCFR varied slightly during the initial phase of

164

epidemic. There was an overall downward trend of aCFR across all the regions of Italy.

A summary of the aCFR, range of median estimates and cCFR of COVID-19 across 20

167

regions of Italy are presented in Table 1. Lombardia had the highest aCFR of 24.7% (95%

168

credible interval: 24.4, 25.1] followed by Marche (19.3%) [95% CrI: 18.2, 20.5], Emilia

169

Romagna (17.7%) [95% CrI: 17.2, 18.3] and the Liguria (17.6%) [95% CrI: 16.8, 18.6]

170

(Table 1, figure 3). The Umbria region exhibited the lowest aCFR (5.2%) [95% CrI: 4.0, 6.4]

171

(Table 1).

172
173

Regions with higher population density and those with a higher cumulative morbidity rate

174

tended to exhibit higher aCFR estimates. These two predictors explained 58% variability

175

(Adjusted R2=0.58) in the severity of pandemic across the Italian regions (P<0.05) (Table

176

S1). Figure 7 displays the geographic distribution of the aCFR, population density per square

177

km, and the cumulative morbidity rate across 20 Italian regions. The scatter plots and the

178

correlation coefficients between aCFR and the variables included in the regression analysis

179

are shown in Figure S1. Figure S2 displays the scatter plot of cumulative cases per total tests

180

and cumulative morbidity rate for different regions of Italy. Because cumulative morbidity

181

per total number of tests was statistically associated with cumulative morbidity rate, it was

182

excluded due to multicollinearity (p value<0.00, r = 0.85) (Figure S2).

184

Discussion

185

In this paper, we have estimated the time delay adjusted case fatality ratio of COVID-19 for

186

20 regions of Italy. Our latest estimate of aCFR in Italy varied substantially across regions

187

with the highest value in the Lombardia region (24.7%) in the Northwest and the lowest in

188

the Umbria region (5.2%) in the Central Italy. The aCFR estimate for the national level was

189

17.4%. A total of 12 administrative regions had aCFR estimates greater than 10%. Our results

190

emphasize the need to generate real-time regional severity estimates to focus mitigation

191

efforts and allocate medical resources that help ameliorate the burden on strained or

192

overwhelmed health care infrastructures.

193
194

We found that the regions in Northern Italy were the most affected compared to regions in

195

Southern Italy including Islands. The aCFR estimates across 7 administrative regions:

196

Lombardia, Emilia Romagna, Piemonte, Marche, Liguria, Abruzzo, and Valle d’Aosta were

197

higher than the aCFR estimates for Wuhan (12.2%) (6) and Korea (1.4%).17

198
199

Results of the multivariate analysis indicate that population density and cumulative morbidity

200

rate are statistically associated with aCFR in Italy, which underscore the importance of social

201

distancing and the need to suppress the incidence curve in order to avoid saturating the health

202

care system and reduce the death risk. We found a statistically significant association of

203

cumulative morbidity per total number of tests and cumulative morbidity rate. This is likely

204

attributable to the different testing strategies implemented during the early transmission phase

205

and in the later phase of epidemic.18

206
207

When we compare the aCFR of the most affected regions in Italy and China, the estimate for

208

Italy is about twice the estimate for China (24.7% vs 12.2%).6 This difference may be partly

209

explained by the demographic structure of the two countries as suggested in a previous

210

study,18 namely Italy has an older population compared to China. In 2019, approximately

211

23% of the Italian population was 65 years and older18 compared to 12.6% in China.19 Other

212

factors behind the differences in the CFR estimates could be associated with the timing and

213

intensity of public health and social measures such as ‘lockdown’ measures. In Wuhan, China

214

aggressive lockdown measures were put in place for about 3 weeks after the report of first

215

COVID-19 case.20 In Italy, Northern provinces were put under lockdowns only 5 weeks after

216

the first recorded cases. Yet, the extent and guidelines of the lockdown were not clearly

217

defined.21 Similarly, different testing strategies may have also influenced differences in CFR.

218

Likewise, in the early phase of epidemic, there was an extensive testing strategy in Italy that

219

included both symptomatic cases and their asymptomatic contacts but later more strict testing

220

policies prioritized more severe suspected cases requiring hospitalization.18

221
222

In our study, as the epidemic progressed, we saw a downward trend in the aCFR for most of

223

the regions in Italy. For Lombardia, Emilia Romagna and for national level, there was also an

224

initial phase with steady high-level CFR which was relatively longer for Lombardia region

225

compared to Emilia Romagna. A previous study on COVID-19 using data from China has

226

also found the declining trend of aCFR for Hubei province excluding Wuhan.6 This trend was

227

also reported for the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea in which the risk of death was

228

significantly associated with older age and underlying health condition.22 In the early phase

229

of the outbreak of an emerging infectious disease like MERS and COVID-19, the detection

230

rate of mildly symptomatic cases is low and only patients who have serious conditions are

231

confirmed due to hospitalization as happened in Wuhan 23, 6 and South Korea.22 However the

232

downward trend of CFR in the later phase of epidemic suggests both an improvement in

233

epidemiologic surveillance and a decline in the proportion of vulnerable patients.6 Because of

234

the decline in the proportion of vulnerable patients and an increased detection of mildly

235

symptomatic cases, the epidemic might be prolonged unless strict social/physical distancing

236

measures are applied.6

237

Our findings underscore the utility of real-time severity estimates to guide the urgent

238

allocation medical resources in highly affected regions and the appropriate planning and

239

supplies procurement in the other regions of Italy with a focus on medical care delivery to the

240

most vulnerable populations with the highest risk of poorer disease outcomes due to COVID-

241

19 such as patients categorized as critical, the elderly, and those with multiple comorbidities

242

including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes.8 Similarly, social distancing

243

measures are critical to prevent the health care system from overloading to a breaking point.

244

After a lockdown that lasted for about two months throughout the country, Italy started to

245

ease movement restrictions on May 4, 2020. However, this should be conducted cautiously

246

by putting in place the necessary infrastructure for tracing, testing, isolation and treatment in

247

place to reduce the likelihood that the disease resurges.24

248
249

Our study is not exempted from limitations. The preferential ascertainment of severe cases

250

bias in COVID-19 may have spuriously increased our estimate of CFR,25 which is a frequent

251

caveat in this type of studies.26, 27 Similarly, for a disease like COVID-19 where transmission

252

is characterized by a rapid growth phase in case incidence, but the infection-death time is

253

long (ranges from 2 to 8 weeks),8 our CFR estimate could have been affected by delayed

254

reporting bias.25, 28 Similarly, our data on number of cases reflects the date of reporting and

255

not the date of onset of illness.

256
257

Conclusion

258

The risk of death due to COVID-19 in Italy was estimated at 17.4% with varying rates across

259

20 regions. Our estimates of time delay adjusted CFR was as high as 24.7% in Lombardia, in

260

Northwest Italy and as low as 5.2% in the Umbria region, located in Central Italy.

261

Importantly, 12 out of the 20 regions exhibited aCFR values greater than 10% and the

262

estimates for 7 regions exceeded previous estimates for the most affected regions in China

263

and Korea. Our findings underscore the importance of social distancing to mitigate the

significantly associated with the cumulative morbidity rates and population density.
