Learning Where to Look for COVID-19 Growth: Multivariate Analysis of COVID-19
Cases Over Time using Explainable Convolution-LSTM

Novanto Yudistira1*, Sutiman Bambang Sumitro2, Alberth Nahas3, Nelly
Florida Riama4

Abstract
Determinant factors which contribute to the prediction should take into account
multivariate analysis for capturing coarse-to-fine contextual information. From the
preliminary descriptive analysis, it shows that environmental factor such as UV
(ultraviolet) is one of the essential factors that should be considered to observe the
COVID-19 epidemic drivers, During summer, UV can inactivate viruses that live in the
air and on the surface of the objects especially at noon in tropical or subtropical
countries. However, it may not be significant in closed spaces like workspace and areas
with the intensive human-to-human transmission, especially in densely populated areas.
Different COVID-19 pandemic growth patterns in northern subtropical, southern
subtropical and tropical countries occur over time. Moreover, there are education,
government, morphological, health, economic, and behavioral factors contributing to the
growth of COVID-19. Multivariate analysis via visual attribution of explainable
Convolution- LSTM is utilized to see high contributing factors responsible for the growth
of daily COVID-19 cases. For future works, data to be analyzed should be more detailed

1. Introduction
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission first detected the 2019 Coronavirus
Disease (COVID-19) in Hubei Province, China, and early information about the
outbreak has been sent to the World Health Organization (WHO) [1] [2]. As the
number of people exposed to COVID-19 increases, the disease's ability to spread in
the community has rapidly improved. The rapid growth involves evidence of personto-person transmission, indicating that COVID-19 is highly contagious. COVID-19
can also live actively in the air and on the ground [3] [4]. Environmental factors are
affecting the success of airborne viruses spreading among susceptible hosts [5].
These forms of transmission may cause a pandemic. A pandemic can cause severe
activity and death in a wide geographic area [6]. To withstand the spread of COVID19, a natural factor that is rarely discussed is ultraviolet (UV). Many UV papers prove
that it can inactivate viruses [7] [8], especially ultraviolet rays from sunlight [9]. An
example of virus inactivation by ultraviolet light is ultraviolet-C radiation for virus
inactivation [8]. Even though ultraviolet rays can inactivate the virus, it will not be
evident if the pollution level is high [10]. Please note that smoke particles will
weaken ultraviolet light's ability to exist in the air [11]. Efforts to reduce the spread of
COVID-19 can also reduce carbon emissions by reducing the intensity of travel

worldwide [12], which is good for the environment. Moreover, vaccine development
is not sufficient, and it takes a long time to discover [13]. Therefore, urgent, largescale, and natural immunity is needed. Some technologies have been developed by
using UV light [14] [15]. Based on the above evidence, we investigate how UV rays
dynamically affect the spread of COVID-19 based on geographic location, pollution
levels, and human activities. Multivariate time series data analysis is a better choice
for analyzing the growth of the COVID-19 pandemic because it has interdependence
among multiple factors over time. The classification of multivariate time series is also
an emerging hot topic in machine learning [19]. Deep neural network (DNN) can
capture information from big data, thus it is the best candidate to perform
classification tasks [20] [21]. The ability of DNN to generate meaningful feature
representations in the learning process has attracted attention in the machine
learning and data science circles. In this study, we use interpretable DNN forecasts
to perform multivariate time series data analysis. This explanation helps to find
critical joint characteristics to predict daily cases of COVID-19 over a period of time.
One study using interpretable DNN is Roy Assaf et al.'s multivariate multi-factory PV
energy prediction, [24] which uses a two-stage convolutional neural network (CNN).

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Data sets
This multidimensional study uses 3 data sets of COVID-19 growth and its
attribution, UVs, and people mobility data. The time-series data was taken from 202003-22 until 2020-09-11. The selected countries are located in tropical, northern

subtropical, and southern subtropical regions. Data sets of worlds confirmed COVID-19,
UV index, pollution, and people mobility time series were taken from Ourworldindata[1],
Tropospheric Emission Monitoring Internet Service (TEMIS)[2] [16], and Google
Mobility[3], respectively. Specific data, like UV index and pollution in Jakarta, Indonesia,
were taken from IndonesiaMeteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency
(BMKG)[4]. Confirmed, recovered, and death cases of COVID-19 data in Jakarta have
been obtained from the Indonesia Ministry of Health[5].

Table 1 shows 59 factors used in this COVID-19 growth multivariate time-series
analysis ranging from environmental, social, government, economical to behavioral
factors. The clear-sky UV index (UVIEF) is a measure for the effective UV irradiance (1
unit equals 25 mW/m2) reaching the Earth's surface. The UV dose is the effective UV
irradiance (given in kJ/m2), reaching the Earth's surface integrated over the day and
taking the UV radiation's attenuation due to clouds. The cloud data is compiled from the
geostationary Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) observations. The UV dose is

computed for three different action spectra, i.e., for three other health effects: erythema
(sunburn) of the skin (UVDEF), vitamin-D production in the skin (UVDVF), and DNAdamage (UVDDF).
Government stringency is related to the measurement provided by the Oxford
COVID-19 Government Reaction Tracker [26]. The Tracker includes 100 Oxford
community individuals who have ceaselessly upgraded a database of 17 parameters of
government response. These parameters look at control approaches such as school
and working environment closings, open occasions, open transport, and stay-at-home
policies. The Stringency Record could be a number from 0 to 100 that reflects these
indicators. The higher score shows a better level of stringency. Stringency list gives a
picture of the policies at which any nation implemented its most grounded measures.
Some countries have had their deaths continue to flatten only as they have hit their
hardest stringency, such as Italy, Spain, or France. As China took harder than initial
stringency, its death curve was flattened.
The aforementioned data set references can be accessed to investigate the
detailed definition of each factor. There are 55 countries at various scales of
geographical area and population trained on DNNs to reveal its explanations. Note that
all factors are normalized into the 0-1 range before feeding into DNNs.

2.2. UV Index Dynamics as Environmental Factors
The UV index (UVIEF) is derived from the measured solar radiation in the UV
spectra that arrives on the surface. It is calculated by considering the proportional
contribution of UV-A and UV-B, two of the three-wavelength based types of UV

radiation. UV-A is characterized as the UV radiation of which the wavelength ranges
from 280-315 nm, while the wavelength of UV-B is between 315 nm and 400 nm. UV
spectra are captured by the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) station. In this study, the
daily mean UV index (0-17) and daily mean Ozone (Dobson Unit) are considered as
parameters involved in the correlation analysis. The depletion of the protective
stratospheric ozone layer due to chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons has increased
UV radiation. The UV index is measured under the assumption of a clear sky without
any barriers such as clouds. The trade-offs between 3 geographical locations (northern
subtropical, tropical, and southern subtropical areas) are investigated in terms of how
UV index and COVID-19 are related over time. The selected GAWs are located in
Argentina, Australia, Chile, Brazil (Sao Paulo) for southern subtropical countries. For
tropical countries, GAWs of India, Saudi Arabia, Thailand are selected as representative
countries. Finally, GAWs of Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Spain, Taiwan are selected
to represent northern subtropical countries. The duration UV index time series is from
2020/01/22 to 2020/07/20. The time-series data are then transformed into a weekly
mean series to capture the bigger picture of dynamics.

than the other, and vice versa. This dynamical pace happened between two adjacent
groups, either blue with green or green with red. Blue countries were starting to
converge, and conversely, red countries were starting to emerge both at the beginning
of May even though outlier countries exist. These phenomena possibly can be
explained in fig.1d where daily mean UV index in red countries were monotonically
decreasing as the winter comes and the opposite for blue countries. It can be suggested
that there is an indication that COVID-19 is a seasonal pandemic depending on
geographical locations.

2.3. Human Mobility Dynamics as Behavioural Factors
The key drivers to be used in human mobility analysis are community activities
dynamics during a pandemic depending on geographical locations (focusing on tropical
countries). After the first outbreak, human mobility has changed from before pandemic
due to lockdown or outdoor activity restriction from the government. To see the effect of
these restrictions, we investigate activities dynamics relative to COVID-19 growth. To
realize this, Google Mobility data that provide six different activities are utilized. Those
activities are grocery and pharmacy, workplaces, transit stations, retail and recreation,
residential, and parks percent change from baseline. To see the effect of reducing
activities intensity, we analyse the time-lagged correlation between activities dynamics
and COVID-19 growth. It means that the impact of activities reductions on COVID-19
growth patterns after several days is temporally investigated. The countries to be
investigated in this study are India, Brazil, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Thailand
(tropical countries).

percentage of change to baseline. The duration of low activities was around a month,
starting from the middle of April to May 2020. After May, the increasing activities were
recorded, revealing new normal life has been adapted. Fig. 2d shows weekly mean
confirmed cases in Malaysia that grew starting from the middle of March 2020.
However, starting from May 2020, the weekly mean confirmed cases were decreasing.
Note that the number of confirmed cases here has also been normalized across all
countries considered in this dataset. Fig. 2e shows that Indonesia’s human mobility
reached the lowest activities percent change to baseline in the middle of May 2020 and
then gradually increased its percentage of change to baseline.

The increasing

phenomena show that the new normal life has been adapted. Fig. 2f shows weekly
mean confirmed cases in Indonesia that grew exponentially since the end of March
2020 as the number of tests increased. Note that the number of confirmed cases here
also has been normalized across all countries considered in this dataset.
To answer the question of whether there is any correlation between the decreasing
activities before new normal and weekly mean confirmed cases after the new normal,
time-lagged cross correlation was carried out.

The Jakarta region investigation in Fig. 3 showed a strong positive correlation
when weekly mean confirmed cases time series are correlated with weekly mean
human activities with an o set of -2. The weekly mean confirmed cases strongly relate to
weekly mean human activities after around two weeks.

Based on the investigation in Fig. 4, we make a correlation test of all countries
between weekly mean confirmed, recovered, and death cases with weekly mean human
activities with an offset of -2 (2 weeks before). It can be concluded that weekly mean
confirmed cases are positively correlated to weekly mean workplaces and transit
stations percent change from baseline by 0.42 and 0.43 with correlation p-value of

0.003 and 0.002, respectively. Weekly mean confirmed cases are negatively correlated

to weekly mean residential percent change from baseline by -0.33 with a correlation pvalue of 0.03. It means that weekly mean confirmed cases correlate to weekly mean
workplaces, transit stations, and weekly mean residential percent change from baseline
with statistically significant (p < 0.05).

2.5. Multivariate Time Series Analysis via Explainable Deep Neural Network
In this research, multivariate time series data set of 59 factors from 55 countries
consists of 6 behavioral, 21 COVID-19, one government, two geographical, three
morphological, two economics, five health, two health facilities, one education, and 16
environmental categories. Each factor is captured daily, except environmental factors
(UVs) are represented by daily mean observations. A variant of DNNs then trains the
features called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) [22] to predict the outcome series of
daily 59 factors over 174 days (2020-03-22 to 2020-09-11). All features in the X dataset
are normalized feature-wise into Xscaled following this equation 1:

𝑋𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑑 =

𝑋 − 𝑋𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝑋𝑚𝑎𝑥 − 𝑋𝑚𝑖𝑛

To achieve explainable prediction of Spatio-temporal data, we develop a
Convolution-LSTM model that consists of 1 1D convolution layer and 2 LSTM layers
with 59 hidden states followed by a fully connected layer with Sigmoid activation (Figure
4). The whole of LSTM units contains the input gate, the forget gate, and the output
gate to capture Spatio-temporal correlation and dynamics of multivariate time-series

optimization via backpropagation is utilized from which attribution maps (saliency maps)

are generated. The visual attribution extracts attention to features that relevant to final

GradCAM [23] is used to create its attribution maps. Grad-Cam is applied to the last
hidden layer where its output activation is weighted with important weight associated

with time-series predictions followed by Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation.

final visual attribution is transformed into clean visualization using ReLU activation by
eliminating negative values.

3. Experimental Setup
We divide the dataset into training and validation, which are 55 and 4 countries,
respectively. The total time-series length for all features is 174 days, 2020-03-22 to
2020-09-11. We use three architectures, which are 1D CNN with one layer, LSTM 1
layer, and proposed Convolution-LSTM (Conv-LSTM), which are validated to test the
data set using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The number of epoch is set to 3000.
We use Adam optimizer to update weights for each iteration with a learning rate of
0.001. The best architecture based on best validation score is selected as a visual
explanation model.

Table 2 shows the (Root Mean Squared Error) RMSE to validate model
architectures to predict the time-series outcome of Italy, Sweden, Indonesia, and
Norway. The low RMSE indicates that the prediction accuracy of validation is high and

impacts reliable feature attribution. After predictions, Spatio-temporal feature attention
inside the Convolution-LSTM network can be visualized. High attention is represented
by red color and gradually becomes blue as the attention value is decreased. The range

of feature attention degrees is in the range of 0 to 1.

reconstruction is due to presumably Indonesia is a large country with heterogeneous
character and behavior. Compared to Sweden, Norway, or Italy, Indonesia is greater in
terms of population, and geographic area, leading to the need for more detailed and
complete data in terms of region and period. Another suggestion is by adding more
countries to be fed into the model; thus model can generalize well and reduce
overfitting. For future works, data to be analyzed should be more detailed in terms of the

region and the time-series sample period.

Figure 9 Actual and reconstruction of Sweden

Fig. 7, 8, and 9 show actual and reconstruction of new cases smoothed in
Norway, Italy, and Sweden, respectively. They have a similar time-series pattern
between actual and reconstruction and thus have a better outcome than Indonesia.
Coincidently, they are located in a similar geographical location of the northern
subtropical area, which differs from Indonesia. It can be concluded that more samples
are necessary to generalize countries that
that have a similar pattern to Indonesia's COVID-

19 case.

UVDDCerr at the beginning of time also influence the new cases over time. The number
of aged 70 people at the end of the time contributes to the pattern of new cases growth
over time. The number of hospital beds per thousand is linked over time by a network
which suggests an important factor to be considered. Factors that have been put high
attention at the beginning and the end of the time are the number of new deaths over
time and environmental factor of UVDDFerr. Over time new cases smoothed follows
environmental factor of UVDDFerr pattern which decreases at the beginning of time and
then increases again at the end of time. It indicates the influence of UV in affecting the
graph of COVID-19 cases, especially in open spaces (the parks percent change from
baseline influences new cases at the small amount at the beginning and the end of
time) as the dynamics of UV in northern subtropical countries.

Temporally, attention to behavioral factors only highlights workplaces change to
baseline over time. It regards open space as a park contributes to the COVID-19 daily
new cases. UV index and dose increase over time in the northern subtropical countries
toward summer. Correspondingly, the visual attribution also shows the degree of
attention on environmental factors. It indicates the influence of UV on daily new COVID19 cases, especially in open spaces like parks. The contribution of aged people is not
as intense as Italy and Norway revealing Sweden's success in separating aged people
and younger ones.

much attention as Sweden of contribution to daily new COVID-19 cases. It can be
understood since the Sweden government's treatment of society is not as strict as
Norway [25]. Visual attribution map also shows that government stringency is one of the
critical factors contributing to daily new COVID-19 cases. Consequently, as shown in
Fig. 7 and 9, Norway and Sweden have different new cases smoothed pattern overtime
where the former decreased and then increased while the latter is monotonically
increasing. Besides, the number of test units, total tests per thousand, and the number
of new tests initially affect the pattern of new cases smoothed over time.
The morphological factor of the number of aged 70 people at the end of time
contributes to new cases smoothed. Human index and health factors of cardiovascular
rate and number of hospital's bed are also factors that cannot be underestimated.
Environmental factors like UVIEFerr, UVDVFerr, and UVDDFerr contribute to the new
cases smoothed in Norway.

Low degree of attention on activity in parks, grocery, and retail and UVIEF
indicate that open spaces with low intensity of human-to-human interaction are helped
by environmental factors such as UV (UVDDFerr at the beginning of time and
UVDVFerr at the end of time). Indonesia’s daily new COVID-19 cases also depend
heavily on the number of tests performed across the country at the beginning of time
(number of new tests, total tests per thousand, and tests units). The big population also
contributes to the new cases, especially if the number of tests grows over time. The
number of hospital’s beds for the entire time is also an important factor contributing to
new cases smoothed.

4. Conclusion

While environmental factor correlates to the global spread of COVID-19
pandemic, we believe that it is not just a standalone factor. Some other factors, like
morphological and behavioral factors, influence the spread and growth of COVID-19
cases. Human activity also influences the spread and growth of COVID-19 cases via
human-to-human transmission, especially in workplaces, residential, and groceries
where direct human interaction is intense in closed spaces. Based on direct evidence,
even though there is an indication that COVID-19 is seasonal flu where there is
interchanging conditions between northern subtropical, tropical, and southern
subtropical locations, some other anticipation should be taken into account:
1. The new normal life is an inevitable thing in daily life where wearing a mask,
hand washing, increasing the hospital’s capacity, and minimizing the number of
activities that make up the crowd should be concerned.
2. Open space is safer than in a closed room with a crowd due to the UV light and
air circulation. Unfortunately, the victims mostly occur in closed spaces such as
groceries, residential, and workplaces.
3. For tropical countries, an abundance of UV light helps withstand the COVID-19
spread, especially in open space. There must be a good balance between
activities inside and outside rooms, especially at noon, where the level UV index
is high. In closed spaces like workplaces, it is suggested to expose UV rays in
the room before leaving the places when the work hour ends.

4. For subtropical country residents, wearing a mask is compulsory while living in
an open space and during the cold season. By the time of the summer season,
people in subtropical countries should take advantage of the high UV index level.
