migration data combined with officially reported data were used to estimate model
parameters, and then calculated the daily exported infected individuals by estimating the
daily infected ratio and daily susceptible population size. As of Jan 01, 2020, the estimated
initial number of latently infected individuals was 380.1 (95%-CI: 379.8~381.0). With 30 days of
substantial social distancing, the reproductive number in Wuhan and Hubei was reduced from
2.2 (95%-CI: 1.4~3.9) to 1.58 (95%-CI: 1.34~2.07), and in other provinces from 2.56 (95%-CI:
2.43~2.63) to 1.65 (95%-CI: 1.56~1.76). We found that earlier intervention of social distancing
could significantly limit the epidemic in mainland China. The number of infections could be
reduced up to 98.9%, and the number of deaths could be reduced by up to 99.3% as of Feb 23,
2020. However, earlier epicenter lockdown would partially neutralize this favorable effect.
Because it would cause in situ deteriorating, which overwhelms the improvement out of the
epicenter. To minimize the epidemic size and death, stepwise implementation of social
distancing in the epicenter city first, then in the province, and later the whole nation without
the epicenter lockdown would be practical and cost-effective.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), initially taken as “pneumonia of unknown
etiology”, emerged in December 2019, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The causative
pathogen was announced by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China
CDC) on Jan 08, 2020, to be a novel coronavirus [1], lately named severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)[2]. COVID-19 broke out in Wuhan in January 2020,
and spread to the whole Hubei Province, the rest of China and abroad with astonishing speed.

constitutes a "public health emergency of international concern". As of Feb 28, there were
7,8961 cases confirmed in China, and 4,691 cases confirmed in 51 other countries. On that day,
WHO increased the assessment of the risk of spread and risk of impact of COVID-19 to very
high at the global level[3].

epidemic prevention and control measures could affect the prevalence scale. Unfortunately,
the prevalence of COVID-19 encountered the Spring Festival Migration of China, the world’s
largest annual human migration as hundreds of millions of people rush home for family
reunions. In addition, the epicenter Wuhan is the capital of Hubei Province of China. It has a
population of more than 15 million, including resident and floating population, and it situates
at the transportation hub in the central China area. As of Jan 23, 2020, more than 5 million
people were migrating out of Wuhan according to official accounts [3]. Emergency monitoring
and close contact management in Wuhan was carried out since Jan 03, 2020; China CDC Level
2 emergency response activated on Jan 06, and Level 1 emergency response activated on Jan
15 [1]. On Jan 20, 2020, COVID-19 was included in the statutory report of Class B infectious
diseases, managed as Class A infectious diseases by the National Health Commission of China.
The Chinese government locked down the Wuhan city on Jan 23, and then locked down other
cities of Hubei Province immediately after. By Jan 25, 30 provincial governments in China
activated first-level public health emergency response. Hence, In addition to strict quarantine
management, substantial social distancing measures to limit population mobility and to
reduce within-population contact rates were executed almost in the whole country. For
example, public activities were canceled; communities adopted enclosed management; the
national holiday of Spring Festival and the winter vacation were extended so that work
resumption and school re-opening could be extensively postponed. In addition, people were
required to wear facemasks in public. However, with all those efforts, the prevalence of
COVID-19 was escalating.
Epidemic prevention and control strategies need to be re-examined. Vaccine and antiviral
drug development is the ultimate way to defeat a virus, but it is time-consuming.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions to interrupt transmission could be implemented
immediately, gaining time for pharmaceutical development. Briefly, there were three steps of
non-pharmaceutical interventions for reducing contact rates between susceptible individuals
and infected individuals. First, quarantine management, i.e. quarantining the infected, the
suspicious and their close contacts; second, social distancing to confine within-population
contact; third, locking down the epicenter to prevent further exportation of infected and
latently infected individuals to other regions.
Quarantine management is a fundamental measure ought to be taken once the
human-human transmission is confirmed. Theoretically, if substantial social distancing
and/or epicenter lockdown were implemented early enough, there would be no prevalence
or no spreading. But realistically, it takes time for preliminary investigation. Besides,
rigorous measures would bring about deep social influences and economic consequences. So,
it is challenging to choose the right response at the right scale in the right area at the right
time[4], especially when the transmission pattern and clinical characteristics were not fully
understood.
The importance of non-pharmaceutical control measures requires further research to

quantify their impact [3]. Mathematical models are useful to evaluate the possible effects on
epidemic dynamics of preventive measures, and to improve decision-making in global health
[5,6].

and respectively in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and 12 other provinces and municipalities.
Population migration data combined with officially reported data were used to estimate
model parameters, the number of the latently infected individuals, and daily exportation of
the infected and latently infected from Wuhan. Our work provided evidence for the
decision-making concerning prevention and control of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in
other countries and future infectious disease epidemic.

Data source and framework of the estimation model
In this study, SEIQR models were developed to simulate the COVID-19 epidemic in
China. We built three SEIQR models to simulate the epidemic in Wuhan, the rest of Hubei
Province, and other provinces and municipalities in China, respectively. Other provinces and
municipalities studied here include nine provinces (i.e. Zhejiang, Guangdong, Henan, Hunan,
Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Shangdong and Sichuan) and three municipalities (i.e. Chongqing,
Beijing and Shanghai) in China, which covered 90% infections in mainland China. For
convenience, “Hubei” represents the rest of Hubei Province excluding Wuhan, and “other

Figure 1 describes the framework of building estimation models. The reported confirmed,
recovered and death cases were used to build initial models for Wuhan, Hubei and other
provinces. Since there could be considerable under-reporting bias in the epicenter for lots of
reasons. We assumed that the cases reported by other provinces were more accurate.
Therefore, the model built on the cases reported by other provinces could estimate more
accurately the number of infections. The reproductive number, infectious period and mean
latent of models built for Wuhan and Hubei should be revised based on the latently infected
individuals. The number of latently infected individuals in Wuhan before Jan 23 was
estimated by the latently infected ratio and the daily population migration data from Wuhan
to the rest of China. In the revised models of Wuhan and Hubei, parameters involving social
distancing measures such as the removed rate, the decline factor of the reproductive number
and the isolating ratio of susceptible individuals inherited from the initial models. The daily
latent infected ratio is calculated based on the daily number of exposed individuals in Wuhan
and the daily susceptible population size. Through the daily latent infected ratio and the daily
number of individuals leaving Wuhan, the daily number of exposed individuals exported to
Hubei and other provinces can be estimated.
Wuhan has a population of around 15.39 million, including a resident population of 9
million, and nearly 6.39 million floating population exported before Jan 23 [7]. The population
exported from Wuhan is the main source of imported cases in the rest of China. The travelers
flowed from the rest of Hubei to other provinces, between two of the other provinces, and
heading to Wuhan were not considered in this study. We assumed that the population
exported from Wuhan was susceptible and exposed population. During the period of time
from Jan 01 to Jan 22, 2020, the number of exported population from Wuhan was derived from
two sources, a) domestic passenger number by air, train and road provided by Cao, Z., et al [7],
and b) international outbound passenger number by air departed from Tianhe Airport
(Wuhan, China) provided by a commercial APP named “Flight Steward”. Officially reported
case data by the National Health Commission were used to estimate the parameters of SEIQR
models.
As of Dec 31, 2019, there were 47 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan [1]. We took that
47 cases as the initial number of infected individuals in the model. From Jan 1 to 23, 2020, the
estimated latent infected ratio in Wuhan is 0.12% [7]. As of Jan 23, the accumulated number of
latently infected individuals in Wuhan and exported infected individuals estimated by the
latently infected ratio were 10800 and 7677.6, respectively.

Results
The estimated number of latently infected individuals by Jan 01, 2020 in Wuhan was
380.9 (95%-CI: 379.8~381.0). The estimated base population size of daily susceptible
individuals was 2*106. The base reproductive number r0 of Wuhan and Hubei was set to 2.2
(95%-CI: 1.4~3.9) referring to the study of Liu, Q., et al [1]. When the interventions continue
for 30 days, r0 was reduced to 1.58 (95%-CI: 1.34~2.07). In other provinces, the estimated
average base reproductive number r0 was 2.52 (95%-CI: 2.43~2.63), and with 30-day
interventions, r0 was reduced to 1.65 (95%-CI: 1.63~1.69). The estimated infectious period TI
was 2.26 days (95%-CI: 2.14~2.39) in Wuhan and Hubei, and was 3.75 days (95%-CI: 3.43~4.13)
in other provinces. The estimated mean latent was 10.1 days (95%-CI: 8.82~11.78) in Wuhan
and Hubei, and was 11.01 days (95%-CI: 9.51~13.06) in other provinces. The estimated
removed rate was 0.0125 (95%-CI: 0.008~0.017) in Wuhan, 0.0175 (95%-CI: 0.0126~0.0224) in

Hubei, and 0.0185 (95%-CI: 0.014~0.023) in other provinces. The initial ratio λ0 of isolating
susceptible individuals was 0.1108 (95%-CI: 0.0957~0.1254) in Wuhan, and 0.2326 (95%-CI:
0.2125~0.2538) in Hubei, both of which were much lower than 0.4113 (95%-CI: 0.3794~0.4432)
in other provinces.

distancing in other provinces, while activated on Jan 3 in Wuhan unchangingly, and on Jan 3, 6 and 15 in Hubei
respectively. (c) The impact of social distancing at different strength levels (i.e. λ= 0.00*λ0, 0.25*λ0, 0.50*λ0, 0.75*λ0 and
1.00*λ0) on the epidemic size. Current infection estimation: the estimated number of infection cases under current
strategies, i.e. social distancing implemented in Wuhan, Hubei and other provinces simultaneously on Jan 23.
SARS-China infection: the infection number of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in mainland China 2003,
that is 5,779. MERS- global infection: the global infection number of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) 2015,
that is 2,269. 0.25*λ0: 25% of the actual social distancing strength implemented in China. 0.50*λ0: 50% of actual
strength. 0.75*λ0: 75% of the actual strength. 1.00*λ0: the actual social distancing strength implemented in China.

We investigated the estimated epidemic size when social distancing activated on
different dates in different areas and at different strength levels in Figure 2. The results in
Figure 2 (a) demonstrated that earlier intervention of social distancing in Wuhan could reduce
the number of infections, but was not significant enough. Earlier intervention simultaneously
in Wuhan and Hubei could further reduce the epidemic size. Activating at earlies time in
Wuhan could allow Hubei activated later with an acceptable compromise. In Figure 2 (b),
earlier intervention in other provinces could reinforce the effect of earlier intervention in
Wuhan and Hubei. In order to control the epidemic size smaller than that of severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) in mainland China 2003 (5,779), social distancing should be
activated simultaneously in Wuhan and Hubei on Jan 03, and in other provinces before Jan 15,
or activated in Wuhan on Jan 03, in Hubei on Jan 6, and in other provinces before Jan 11.
However, it could not be controlled smaller than the global size of the Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic 2015 (2,269). Of note, if the social distancing in
Hubei lagged behind Wuhan for more than two weeks, the earlier intervention in other
provinces could barely affect the epidemic size in China. Figure 2 (c) showed that, without
social distancing (0*λ0), the infection number would be remarkably increased than the current
epidemic estimation. Earlier activation of social distancing at low strength level (0.25*λ0)
could be a bit better, but may eventually, maybe after Apr 1, enlarge the epidemic size. Earlier
activation of social distancing at a moderate level (0.50*λ0 and 0.75*λ0) would be effective.
Reasonably, earlier activating substantial social distancing at high-level (1*λ0), which is the
actual social distancing strength implemented in China, could lead to the best results.

other provinces. SARS-China infection: the infection number of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in
mainland China 2003, that is 5,779. MERS- global infection: the global infection number of Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome (MERS) 2015, that is 2,269. SARS-China death: the death number of SARS in mainland China 2003, that
is 829. MERS-global death: the global death number of MERS 2015, that is 431.

We next investigated the impact of earlier epidemic lockdown on the estimated epidemic
size and the number of deaths in Figure 3. The number of deaths was estimated by the
number of infections multiplied with the current death rate in Wuhan, Hubei and other
provinces (i.e. 4.43%, 3.09% and 0.835%). Unexpectedly, we found that the significant
decrease of the nationwide epidemic size and death number by earlier social distancing
would be partially neutralized by earlier epicenter lockdown (Figure 3a). With earlier social
distancing in three different timings, the later of the lockdown, the smaller of the nationwide
epidemic size and the less number of deaths there would be. This tendency is especially
remarkable when social distancing was activated at the earliest time. With most strategies
discussed here, the death number of COVID-19 could be controlled less than that of SARS in
mainland China (829). Earlier social distancing without earlier lockdown could control the
death number less than the global death number of MERS 2015 (431). Further investigation
suggested that earlier epicenter lockdown would increase the number of infections and
deaths in the epicenter Wuhan, while reducing the number of infections and deaths in the rest
of Hubei and other provinces.
To put it more intuitively, we illustrated the estimated epidemic size and number of
deaths in Wuhan, Hubei and other provinces with the optional strategies compared with the
current strategy in Figure 4. Figure 4 (a) showed the estimated epidemic controlled with two
of the theoretically best strategies in terms of minimizing the nationwide epidemic size and
death (left column, epidemic lockdown on Jan 23 while social distancing activated in the
whole nation simultaneously on Jan 03), and in terms of minimizing the epidemic outside the
epicenter (right column, epidemic lockdown on Jan 03 while social distancing activated in the
whole nation simultaneously on Jan 03). Figure 4 (b) showed the effects with two of the
practically optional strategies aiming to minimize the nationwide epidemic size and death
(left column, epidemic lockdown on Jan 23 while social distancing activated in Wuhan on Jan
03, in Hubei on Jan 06, in other provinces on Jan 11), and aiming to minimize the epidemic
outside the epicenter (right column, epidemic lockdown on Jan 03 while social distancing
activated in Wuhan on Jan 03, in Hubei on Jan 06, in other provinces on Jan 11). Figure 4 (c)
showed the estimated epidemic controlled with the current strategy (simultaneously
activated nationwide social distancing and epicenter lockdown on Jan 23) for comparison.

Discussion
To improve the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic, there are several
questions concerning the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions of social distancing and
epicenter lockdown need to be addressed. We developed a data-driven SEIQR model of the
COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and other provinces in China to investigate
these questions.
The first question to be addressed is the timing to implement social distancing in the
epicenter city, in other parts of the province, and the rest of the nation respectively. Our
results showed that early intervention of social distancing could reduce the epidemic size
significantly, especially synchronizing the intervention nation-widely at the possible earliest
time. However, in such a large country like China, nationwide implementation of rigorous
social distancing measures would bring profound socioeconomic influence. A stepwise
intervention of social distancing as early as possible in the epicenter city, then in the
province and later the whole nation would be more cost-effective.
The second question is the necessity to adopt social distancing to such a substantial
extent. The intervention of social distancing in China was implemented in an
all-of-Government and all-of-society manner. The specific measures were unprecedented
comprehensive and rigorous, including but not limited to canceling gatherings, reducing
public transportation, adopting enclosed community management, suspending work and
school classes. Meanwhile, the socioeconomic cost was tremendous. Besides, these measures
may be not universally practical in other countries. So we evaluated the impact of abolishing
or reducing the extent of social distancing on the epidemic size. We found that moderate
social distancing would remarkable attenuate its effect, while abolishing social distancing
would leading to epidemic escalating.
The effectiveness of social distancing on epidemic control is still under academic debate.
The results of virtual experiments vary. Some research suggested social distancing is effective,
under the condition of early activation and long-lasting implement of combined measures [8],
strict implement [6,9], and spontaneously adopted [10]; some concluded the effectiveness was
mild [11]; some argued that moderate social distancing can worsen the disease outcome, [6,9]
But real-world studies are rare. Here we quantified the impact of social distancing on the
epidemic size in the real world, providing evidence that social distancing is effective to
interrupt the transmission of the respiratory pathogen, especially with early implementation
and to a substantial extent. Activating social distancing at the possible earliest time in the
epicenter could gain time for the preparation of regions out of epicenter, and reduce wide
range socioeconomic impact.
The third question is the necessity and the timing of the epicenter lockdown.
Unexpectedly, our results showed that the significant decrease of the epidemic size by earlier
social distancing would be partially neutralized by earlier epicenter lockdown. Further
investigation suggested that the influences of epicenter lockdown on epidemic size and death
differed between Wuhan and non-Wuhan regions. Earlier lockdown of Wuhan would
deteriorate the situation in situ, but would largely lower the infection number in the rest of
Hubei province and other provinces. The reasons may be as follows. After lockdown, a
portion of the infected and the latently infected (the exposed in the model) would accumulate

in Wuhan instead of exporting outside. Theoretically, it would not change the total infection
or death number, but we found the conversion rate from the close contacts to the exposed is
much higher in Wuhan than in other provinces, as listed in table S1 of Supplement Material,
so is the death rate. Quickly surging infected patients in Wuhan exerted extraordinary
pressure on local healthcare systems, resulting in an acute shortage of medical resources and
healthcare workers. Then the fast-growing infection and resource shortage fueled each other
in a vicious cycle. Numerous close contacts could not be quarantined for medical observation.
Plentiful infected patients could not be hospitalized or quarantined for treatment. Then they
would contact more susceptible persons and infect more people. Besides, unhospitalised and
under-treated patients suffered a higher death rate. Taken together, the accumulation of
patients in Wuhan caused by epicenter lockdown would aggravate the vicious circle. On the
other hand, under the circumstances of nation-wide substantial social distancing, there were
no such intense pressures on the healthcare systems out of Wuhan, so the conversion rate and
death rate were much lower than those in Wuhan. Thus locking the epicenter down later, or
even abolishing the lockdown, could reduce the infection density and the pressure of
healthcare systems in the epicenter, and decrease the epidemic size and death to some extent.
The price is that the epidemic size in the rest of the nation would be relatively larger than
early lockdown, and the nationwide socioeconomic impact would be deepened. So it turns
out to be a controversial issue to determine which option should be taken. To minimize the
epidemic size and death, the epicenter city should not be locked down. To confine the
epidemic distribution and mitigate the impact on nationwide socio-economy, the epicenter
lockdown should be taken earlier.
There is little literature available concerning the impact of epicenter lockdown on the
epidemic dynamics. Our results suggested a heterogeneous effect of epicenter lockdown on
the epidemic size, death and localization. This founding could be partially evidenced by the
epidemic prevalence on the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship. After COVID-19 appeared on the
cruise ship, the whole ship was put on lockdown. A total of 3,711 passengers and crew were
quarantined on the ship for 16-28 days. As of Mar 03, 2020, there were 706 infections and 6
death reported. The infection rate is up to 19%, and the death rate of 0.16%. The ship
lockdown prevented epidemic spreading out, at the heavy price of within ship outbreak with
an astonishingly high infection rate. The question then arises which aim should take the
priority, minimizing the epidemic size and death, or better confining the prevalence to the
origin region from spreading out. In addition, epidemics do more than cause death and
debilitation. The regional socioeconomic damage after lockdown and the extensive
socioeconomic impact of a nationwide spreading epidemic will further complicate the
decision. This finding highlight the importance of careful evaluation and contemplation on
the impact of epicenter lockdown from all side.
Taken together, the theoretically best strategy to minimize epidemic size and death is
simultaneously activating nationwide substantial social distancing at the possible earliest
time while abolishing epicenter lockdown. Alternatively, the ideal strategy to confine the
epidemic within Hubei Province to the most extent is simultaneously activating both
nationwide social distancing and epicenter lockdown at the possible earliest time. Practically,
a stepwise implement of social distancing in Wuhan, Hubei and the rest of the nation would
be more cost-effective.

Several issues to be noted when interpreting our work.
One is about the comprehensiveness of the interventions. In addition to the mainly
discussed strategies of social distancing and epidemic lockdown, measures implemented in
China also included forceful medical supports to Wuhan, reinforced quarantine management,
and public health measures, e.g. requiring people to wear masks in public, raising public
awareness for hand hygiene. Although these measures were not specifically discussed, their
effectiveness has been illustrated by the adjustment of daily removed rate, and the decline of
the base productive number r0 in our model.
Another is about the time range of the interventions evaluated in this paper. We choose
Jan 3, 2020 as the earliest available time point to implement interventions of social distancing
and/or epicenter lockdown for two reasons. Practically, it is the date Wuhan started close
contact management [1], a kind of preliminary quarantine management. Taking the move
before this date could be better, but scarcely possible, so beyond the scope of our discussion.
Technically, the available population migration data [7] covers the period from Jan 01 to Jan
22, so the timing of Wuhan lockdown investigated in this study is confined within this period.
The effect of abolishing the epicenter lockdown was estimated under the assumption that the
scale of the population migrated out of Wuhan would keep stable. Normally, the great
migration departing big cities like Wuhan would pause around Jan 25, the day of Spring
Festival, then the migration would continue with a reverse direction back to cities. However,
under the circumstances of the epidemic prevailing, if the lockdown was abolished,
individuals trying to get away from Wuhan might increase, leading to more imported cases in
other regions than expected.
In addition, the application of our results should be tailored in a different situation. The
non-Hubei provinces we studied were the ten provinces with most infections besides Hubei,
plus the two municipalities of most importance in mainland China. These provincial regions
had a large inflow of people from Wuhan, and had a high local population density. So there
were more imported cases, and easy to trigger widespread local transmission. For those
regions with little people flow from the epicenter and with a population of low density, it
could be possible that reinforced quarantine management without stringent social distancing
could be effective enough to interrupt local transmission. An extreme example is that there
was only one COVID-19 case in Tibet Autonomous Region of China, and the one was an
imported case from Wuhan. He was timely quarantined for treatment and discharged after
recovery. 23 close contacts were quickly traced and quarantined for medical observation, and
then ruled out of infection. For other regions in and out of China, the specific measures may
be adjusted to the different social-political-economic environment.

Conclusion
Based on the epidemic of COVID-19 in mainland China, we developed data-driven
SEIQR models to investigate the impact of social distancing and epicenter lockdown on the
epidemic dynamics. Activating social distancing at the possible earliest time with
comprehensive and rigorous measures could significantly reduce the epidemic size of
COVID-19. A stepwise implementation of social distancing in the epicenter city first, then in
the province, and later the whole nation could be more practical and cost-effective. The

decision of epicenter lockdown depends on the primary goal of epidemic control. To
minimize the epidemic size and death, the epicenter city should not be locked down. To
better confine the epidemic to the origin region, and mitigate the impact on nationwide
socio-economy, the epicenter lockdown should be taken earlier.
Gratefully, the epidemic in mainland China has been declining steadily, especially in
non-Wuhan regions. However, the epidemic out of China may just begin. Several countries,
i.e. Korea, Italy, Iran, and Japan, etc. are confronted with an ongoing epidemic outbreak.
With caution, the COVID-19 epidemic may even evolve into a global pandemic. Besides,
other virulent infectious diseases may attack humans again in the future. We sincerely hope
that our work could help the decision-making of epidemic prevention and control strategy
for other countries in this COVID-19 epidemic and for future infectious disease epidemics.
Tailored and sustainable approaches should be adopted in a different situation, striking a
balance among the control of infection and death number, confining epidemic regions, and
maintaining socioeconomic vitality.
