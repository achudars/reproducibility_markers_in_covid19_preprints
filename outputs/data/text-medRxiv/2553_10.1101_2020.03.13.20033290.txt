Abstract
Background: So far, the psychological impact of COVID-19 epidemic among family
members of Health care workers (HCWs) in China has been neglected. The present
cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the mental health status and related factors
of families of HCWs in Designated Hospitals in Ningbo, China.
Method: Family members of HCWs working in five designated hospitals in Ningbo,
China were recruited between February 10th and 20th, 2020. Information on
demographic variables, the COVID-19-related events in the lives, knowledge of
COVID-19 and the working status of family members (that is, HCWs) was collected
using online self-administered questionnaires. The mental health status were assessed
using the Chinese version of Patient Health Questionnare-9 (PHQ-9) and Chinese
version of Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). Multivariable logistic regression
analyses were conducted to identify the main factors associated with the mental health
conditions.
Results: A total of 822 participants completed questionnaires correctly. (response rate
of 95.80% ). The overall prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms were 33.73%,
and 29.35%, respectively. More times (hours) to focus on the COVID-19 (Odd ratio
(OR)=1.215, 95% confidence interval (CI):1.061-1.391), family members (that is,
HCWs) directly contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients (OR=1.477,
95%CI:1.069-2.040) were risk factors for GAD, while higher participants
self-reported safety score for protective equipment of HCWs (OR=0.807,
95%CI:0.700-0.930) was a protective factor. More times (hours) to focus on the
COVID-19 (OR=1.215, 95%CI:1.061-1.391), longer average working times per week
for family members (that is, HCWs) (OR=1.017, 95%CI:1.005-1.029), being parents
and other next of kin of HCWs were risk factors for depressive symptoms (OR=3.526,
95%CI:1.609-7.728 and OR=1.639, 95%CI:1.096-2.451, respectively). In addition,
compared with participants who were HCWs, participants who were enterprise
workers and were more likely to develop depressive symptoms(OR=1.750,
95%CI:1.104-2.776), while who were government employees or institutions

Introduction
Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has
occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which has spread rapidly throughout
China and even the world1. As of March 8, 2020, a total of 80,695 COVID-19
confirmed cases with 3,097 deaths had been reported in mainland China and the
21,110 confirmed cases with 413 deaths had been reported outside of China. In total,
the global number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has surpassed 100,000 in 93
countries/territories/areas2,3.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Ningbo was reported on January 21 ,
20204. As of March 8, 2020, a total of 157 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in
Ningbo5. In order to prevent and control the epidemic of COVID-19, the local
government has set up fifteen designated-hospitals, of which five have treated for
confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients as of February 28, 20206.
Compelling evidence have suggested that infectious disease pandemics, including
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS)
and 2009 novel influenza A (H1N1), were associated with mental health problems
among the general population7-9, HCWs10-14, patients15-17and family members of
patients18.
The severe situation of COVID-19 is also causing HCWs’ mental health problems
such as stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms in China19. One of the most
important reasons is that many HCWs lacked contacting with families19. Meanwhile,
they may also experience fear of contagion and spreading the virus to their families20.
Based on the above research evidence, we have reason to speculate that families of
HCWs may also suffer from similar psychological problems to HCWs during
COVID-19 epidemic21-23. As a result, in the National Health Commission guidelines
for emergency psychological crisis intervention for people affected by COVID-19,
families of HCWs were ranked as the third priority group24.

To date, series of studies have explored the psychological impact of COVID-19
outbreak on HCWs19,20,26,27. However , epidemiological data on the psychological
impact among families of HCWs for COVID-19 epidemic have been limited.
Therefore, we performed a online-based cross-sectional study to investigate the
mental health status and its influencing factors among families of HCWs who directly
or indirectly contacted with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients in Ningbo,
China. We hope our study findings will provide data support for the targeted
interventions to this often unseen populations to cope with psychological problems
during COVID-19 epidemic28.

Methods
Study design and participants
A cross-sectional study was conducted in Ningbo in February 2020. To prevent the
spread of COVID-19 through droplets or contact, we used a online-based survey via
the WeChat-based survey programme Questionnaire Star to collected data. With the
help of five designated hospitals that have treated for confirmed or suspected
COVID-19 patients in Ningbo, a total of 882 family members of HCWs from these
five designated hospitals were invited to participate in this study. All participants
were informed of study procedure upon their recruitment.
The inclusion criteria of this study were (1) being the next of kin of HCWs from
designated-hospitals for medical treatment of COVID-19 in Ningbo; (2) having access
to the internet; Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) self-reported history of
neurological disorders, mental illness and other serious systemic disorders; (2)
self-reported substance abuse; Participants who passed the initial self-screening phase
were asked to complete the self-administrated questionnaires25.This study was
approved by the Ethical Committee of Ningbo First Hospital (approval number:
2020-R042) and registered with the registry website http://www.chictr.org
(registration number: ChiCTR2000030697). Signed informed consent was obtained
online from all participants .

The questionnaires consisted of demographics, the Chinese version of Patient
Health Questionnare-9 (PHQ-9) , the Chinese version of Generalized Anxiety
Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and questionnaires that were developed specifically for this
study, as there were no suitable scales available for measuring the factors related to
families of HCWs during COVID-19 outbreak. The self-developed questionnaires
included the working status of family members (that is, HCWs), the participants’
knowledge of COVID-19, and the COVID-19-related events in the lives of
participants.
Demographics
The demographic characteristics included age, gender, educational level,
occupation and the kinship with HCWs. Occupation included the following four types:
(1)HCWs; (2) enterprise workers; (3) government employees or institutions
employees; (4) students; (5) others, which consisted of freelancers, retirees, social
workers, and other relevant staffs. The kinship of HCWs included the following four
types:(1)spouses; (2)children; (3)parents; (4) other next of kin
Self-developed questionnaires

）

The working status of family members (that is, HCWs) included: (1 whether
HCWs directly contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients; (2) the
average working time (hours) per week for HCWs; (3) participants’ self-reported
safety score for protective equipment of HCWs (The safety scores ranging from 1 to 5,
with the higher score indicating a better protective effect); (4) the department of
HCWs, which was categorized into five items: a. front-line departments included
respiratory department, infection department, ICU, fever clinic and isolation ward; b.
medical technology department (imaging department and laboratory department, etc.);
c. nursing department; d. logistics department; e. other departments.
The participants’ knowledge of COVID-19 was assessed by answering five single
topic selection related to COVID-19: (1)which of the following symptoms is not a
common symptom of COVID-19, with possible response options being fever, stuffy
nose and runny nose, fatigue, and dry cough; (2) how many days do people returning

from Hubei province need to be quarantined and observed, with possible response
options being ten days, twelve days, fourteen days and fifteen days; (3) which of the
following masks can prevent COVID-19, with possible response options being
activated carbon mask, cotton mask, sponge mask and medical surgical mask; (4) the
known transmission routes of COVID-19 do not include which of the following, with
possible response options being contact transmission, droplet transmission, soil
transmission and aerosol transmission; (5)with regard to the disposal of discarded
masks, what is incorrect about the following statement, with possible response options
being throw it away at any time when you run out of it, masks worn by people with
fever need to be disinfected, sealed and discarded, wash your hands immediately after
handling the mask and discarded masks should be discarded into hazardous trash cans.
Of the above five questions, one point for each correct answer and no points for
incorrect answers. A total score was calculated by summing points for each of the five
questions, ranging from 0 to 5, with the higher score indicating a better knowledge of
COVID-19.
The COVID-19-related events in the lives of participants included: (1) whether
there had been confirmed COVID-19 cases in families or friends; (2) whether there
had been suspected COVID-19 cases in families or friends; (3) times to focus on
COVID-19, which was measured by the average hour spent focusing on the
COVID-19 information every day.
Patient Health Questionnare-9
We employed the Chinese version of PHQ-9 to assess the depressive symptoms of
families of HCWs. PHQ-9 is a self-report, 9-item measure to assess depression
severity. Participants rated each item in accordance with the frequency of symptoms
over the past two weeks, on a 4-point scale, from 0 (not at all ) to 3 (nearly every day).
Total scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicting greater severity of
depressive symptoms29. The PHQ-9 has been widely used in China30,31.The good
internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s alpha coefficients ranged from 0.84 to
0.86) of the Chinese version of PHQ-9 has been demonstrated32-34. In the present

study, Cronbach's α = 0.81. The depressive symptom was defined as a total score of

≥

5 points in the PHQ-9 according to the previous study during COVID-19 epidemic25.
Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7
We employed the Chinese version of GAD-7 to assess the GAD of families of HCWs.
GAD-7 is a self-report questionnaire that screening and measure severity of GAD.
Participants rated seven items according to the frequency of symptoms in the past two
weeks, on a 4-point scale , from 0 (not at all ) to 3 (nearly every day). Total scores
range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicting greater severity of GAD35. The
GAD-7 has also been widely used in China and the good internal consistency
reliability (Cronbach’s alpha coefficients ranged from 0.84 to 0.88) of the Chinese
version of GAD-7 has been confirmed36-40. In the present study, Cronbach's α = 0.84.
The presence of anxiety was defined as a total score of

≥5 points in the GAD-7

according to the previous study during COVID-19 epidemic25.

Statistical analysis
Categorical variables were described as percentages and were compared using
chi-square tests. Continuous variables were described as mean±SD and were
compared using ANOVA analyse. Variables with skewed distributions were
log-transformed to normal distribution. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to
assess the associations between the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 score and potential related
factors. Statistical analysis were performed using SPSS 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL,USA). Two-sided p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Demographic characteristics
Of the 882 participants who were recruited in this study, 845 completed the
questionnaires correctly (response rate of 95.80% ). Table 1 presents characteristics of
participants.
The mean age of participants was 37.98±9.39 years. Among these samples, 52.66%
were male, nearly a half (46.98%) were also HCWs, 65.44% were in a spousal

relationship with the HCWs, and most of participants (approximately 87.81%) had a
Junior college or bachelor or above education.
Only 0.36% and 8.28% of participants had confirmed and suspected COVID-19
cases in families or friends, respectively. 25.09% of participants focused on the
COVID-19 for 3 hours or more every day. The mean score of participants’ knowledge
of COVID-19 was 4.45±0.68. Almost one-sixth (15.5%) of participants’ family
members (that is, HCWs) worked in the Front-line departments, nearly a half (48.05%)
have to directly contact with confirmed or suspected VOVID-19 patients, the mean
working time per week for HCWs was 41.44±13.07 hours, and the mean points of
participants’ self-reported safety score for protective equipment of HCWs was
3.78±1.08.
Prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms among families of HCWs during
COVID-19 epidemic stratified by variables
The prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms among families of HCWs
stratified by all the variables were also shown in Table 1. The overall prevalence of
GAD and depressive symptoms were 33.73%, and 29.35%, respectively. There was
statistically significant difference in the prevalence of GAD by gender, age, times to
focus on COVID-19 per day (hours), whether HCWs directly contact with confirmed
or suspected VOVID-19 patients , the average working time per week for HCWs
(hours) , and self-reported safety score for protective equipment of HCWs . There was
statistically significant difference in the prevalence of depressive symptoms by gender,
age, occupation, kinship of HCWs, times to focus on COVID-19 per day (hours), and
the average working time per week for HCWs (hours).
Variables associated with GAD and depressive symptoms among families of
HCWs during COVID-19 epidemic
The associations of potential influence factors with GAD and depressive symptoms
among families of HCWs during COVID-19 epidemic were presented in Table 2.
Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the participants who spent more
times (hours) to focus on the COVID-19 (Odd ratio (OR)=1.215, 95% confidence
interval (CI):1.061-1.391) and whose family members (that is, HCWs) directly

(OR=1.477,

participants’ self-reported safety score for protective equipment of HCWs (OR=0.807,
95%CI:0.700-0.930) was a significantly protective factor for participants to suffer
GAD. In addition, female participants were marginally significantly more likely to
have GAD (OR=1.435, 95%CI:0.991-2.079) than males.
Multiple logistic regression analysis also demonstrated that more times (hours) to
focus on the COVID-19 (OR=1.215, 95%CI:1.061-1.391) and longer average
working times per week for HCWs (OR=1.017, 95%CI:1.005-1.029) were
significantly associated with higher risks of depressive symptoms among participants .
Compared to participants who were HCWs , enterprise workers were significantly
more likely to develop depressive symptoms (OR=1.750, 95%CI:1.104-2.776), while
government employees or institutions employees were significantly less likely to have
depressive symptoms (OR=0.529, 95%CI:0.286-0.977). Compared to participants
who being a spouse of HCWs, parents and other next of kin were significantly much
likely to develop depressive symptoms (OR=3.526, 95%CI:1.609-7.728 and
OR=1.639, 95%CI:1.096-2.451, respectively)

Discussion
This online-based cross-sectional study has provided evidence of a high prevalence
of GAD and depressive symptoms among family members of HCWs in designated
hospitals in Ningbo, China during COVID-19 epidemic. Therefore, as with HCWs,
the mental health status of their families needs urgent attention. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to explore the mental health problems and its related
factors among family members of HCWs during COVID-19 outbreak, and even the
first study to investigate this issue during any infectious epidemic.
We note that 33.73% and 29.35% of family members of HCWs reported GAD and
depressive symptoms, respectively. The prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms
were both much higher than the levels reported among general Chinese
populations41-44. In addition, The prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms were

both lower than levels reported for a total of 1563 medical staff in a previous study
using the same assessment instrument and cut-off score as this study (44.7% and
50.7%)26. It worth nothing that this study was conducted in the early phase of
COVID-19 epidemic when most of Chinese HCWs had been facing the most severe
situation, which is causing extreme psychological response19. Comparing our current
study data with similar studies conducted at the same designed-hospitals it was
interesting to note that, family members of HCWs were more likely to develop GAD
and depressive symptoms than HCWs (28.8% and 23.9%, respectively). Although one
needs to be cautious when comparing data from different studies using inconsistent
time frames and medical conditions, this finding does demonstrate, to some extent,
that an extreme psychological impact in association with COVID-19 epidemic, also in
family members of HCWs.
Previous studies have demonstrated that hospital-related transmission was
suspected to be the possible mechanism of infection for affected HCWs45. Thus, it is
easy to understand that family members (that is, HCWs) directly contact with
confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients was associated with higher risk for GAD
among participants, because they excessively concerned that
their families might be infected or even die. This is consistent with the results of a
previous study representing that family members of H1N1 patients suffer anxiety18.
Moreover, without proper personal protective equipment, COVID-19 may endanger
HCWs46.As a result, it is possibly understandable that participants who report a higher
safety score for protective equipment of HCWs would believe that their families were
better protected, and therefore they were less likely to develop GAD.
Our findings demonstrated that longer average working times per week for HCWs
was significantly associated with a higher risk of depressive symptoms among
participants. Longer working times means that HCWs have to spent more time on
contacting with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients, which may increase their
chances of being infected with COVID-1945, and thus have a impact of depressive
symptoms on their family members18. Longer working times would also occupy more
family times of HCWs, and therefore may cause work-family conflict between HCWs

and their family members, resulting in depression among both sides in the process of
coping with this conflict47.
It is interesting to note that, compared to participants who were HCWs, enterprise
workers

were

more

likely to

develop depressive symptoms

(OR=1.750,

95%CI:1.104-2.776). Most enterprise workers have no medical background, and thus
lack sufficient cognitive ability to raise awareness of COVID-19 outbreak. Their
psychological endurance is lacking during a pandemic, and therefore may develop
depressive symptom48. In addition, many enterprises were forced to shut down their
work and production during the epidemic in China, resulting in the loss of income for
their employees. However, income reduction was the predicting factor with the
highest correlation of depression among enterprise workers, according to the results of
a previous study during SARS in 200349. Government employees or institutions
employees were less likely to have depressive symptoms, which was less documented
in the literature. It is likely that these populations were more likely to have access to a
transparent announcement of epidemic information, so one possible explanation is
that they do not have to suffer a feeling of uncertainty, which is a known risk factor
for depression during a infectious epidemic51. Moreover, compared with HCWs who
always suffer depression during the infectious epidemic, including COVID-19
outbreak15,19,26,51, most of government employees or institutions employees stayed
away from confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients, and therefore have lower risk
of depressive symptoms than HCWs.
Meanwhile, similar to the results of a previous study during H1N1 in 2009, higher
depression was noted for those in non-spousal relationships with HCWs, i.e. in our
sample these were parents and other next of kin. Considering the majority of parents
of HCWs were already elderly, one possible explanation is that rapid transmission of
COVID-19 and high death rate have exacerbated the risk of mental health problems
and worsen existing psychiatric symptoms among older adults52. We also speculate
that most of parents and other next of kin of HCWs have no medical background, and
therefore have a more extreme psychological response to COVID-19 epidemic, as we
have discussed before48.

The only factor significantly associated with both GAD and depressive symptoms
was times focus on COVID-19, which is consistent with findings in the general
populations during COVID-19 outbreak51. Under this period of COVID-19 outbreak,
most of the general populations, including family members of HCWs, stayed at home
for isolation and faced with a great deal of information, as the government run
national messaging campaigns that constantly emphasizing the dangers of COVID-19,
especially on affected HCWs. Thus, family members of HCWs gained more time to
gather information of HCWs who treated for COVID-19 patients, through the Internet
and media53, for example on WeChat, which has spread the psychological influences,
such as GAD and depressive symptoms, among the public more widely20,54. Moreover,
the expression of this psychological reaction may be related to the normal protective
response of the human body to the pressure of the epidemic, which also occurred in
SARS outbreak in 200355.
In reviewing the results of this study, there is evidence that insufficient and
inadequate attention was paid to family members of HCWs during COVID-19
epidemic in China. Several appropriate interventions to alleviate GAD and depressive
symptoms among this vulnerable population are recommended as follows: First,
health policy makers and stakeholders should collaborate to provide high-quality,
timely crisis psychological services to families of HCWs. Online psychological
self-help intervention systems, including online cognitive behavioural therapy for
depression and anxiety (eg, on WeChat), would be appropriate for families of
HCWs25,54. Second, providing suitable protective equipment, work schedule, and
accommodation to HCWs would benefit family members who were concerned about
HCWs being infected. Third, according to the findings of previous studies21,27, social
support appeared as a protective effect on mental health problems between HCWs and
their families. Thus, we strongly recommend both sides to take the initiative to
communicate with each other to show their support. Last but not least, government’s
propaganda strategies should be well-organized and effective56. The provision of
reliable and transparent epidemic information to family members of HCWs is

essential to enhance their sense of control and self-efficacy, and therefore enable them
to cope with the psychological impact of COVID-19 outbreaks58.
This study has several limitations. First, because we performed a cross-sectional
study, our results do not show a causal relationship. Second, in order to prevent
potential COVID-19 infection, a web-based survey was conducted, and therefore the
sampling of our study was voluntary, resulting in possible selection bias. Third, our
sample is not highly representative as the respondents were all from Ningbo city.

Conclusion
The present study provided evidence of a major mental health burden of family
members of HCWs worked in designated hospitals during COVID-19 epidemic in
Ningbo, China, particularly in participants with more times to focus on COVID-19,
family members (that is, HCWs) directly contact with confirmed or suspected
COVID-19 patients, family members (that is, HCWs) have longer average working
times per week, and who were in non-spousal relationships with HCWs. On the
contrary, participants’ higher self-reported safety score for protective equipment of
HCWs was a protective factor against psychological problems. Compared with
participants who were HCWs, those who were enterprise workers were more likely to
develop mental health problems, while who were government employees or
institutions employees were less likely to report psychological response. In summary,
we suggest that more attention should be paid on the mental health status of this
vulnerable but often unseen populations in a infectious disease outbreak. In addition,
our findings are important in enabling government to allocate health resources and
offer appropriate treatments for family members of HCWs who suffer mental health
problems during COVID-19 epidemic and any of the infectious disease outbreak in
the future.
