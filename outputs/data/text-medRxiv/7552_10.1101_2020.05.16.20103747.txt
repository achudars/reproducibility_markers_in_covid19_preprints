Abstract
The United States has the highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the world. The
early hot spot states were New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. The workforce in these states
was required to work from home except for essential services. It was necessary to evaluate an
appropriate date for resumption of business since the premature reopening of the economy would
lead to a broader spread of COVID-19, while the opposite situation would cause greater loss of
economy. To reflect the real-time risk of the spread of COVID-19, it was crucial to evaluate the
population of infected individuals before or never being confirmed due to the pre-symptomatic
and asymptomatic transmissions of COVID-19. To this end, we proposed an epidemic model
and applied it to evaluate the real-time risk of epidemic for the states of New York, New Jersey,
and Connecticut. We used California as the benchmark state because California began a phased
reopening on May 8, 2020. The dates on which the estimated numbers of unidentified infectious
individuals per 100,000 for states of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut were close to those
in California on May 8, 2020, were June 1, 22, and 22, 2020, respectively. By the practice in
California, New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut might consider reopening their business.
Meanwhile, according to our simulation models, to prevent the resurgence of infections after
reopening the economy, it would be crucial to maintain sufficient measures to limit the social
distance after the resumption of businesses. This precaution turned out to be critical as the
situation in California quickly deteriorated after our analysis was completed and its interventions
after the reopening of business were not as effective as those in New York, New Jersey, and
Connecticut.

Introduction

The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread over 200 countries since December 2019 (National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China, 2020). It is unprecedented to have over 7 million cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide at the
beginning of June, 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020c). The “battle” against COVID-19

in China has provided experience and likely outcomes of certain interventions to the ongoing
hard-hit areas. As a novel and acute infectious disease, the transmission mechanisms of COVID19 were unknown at the early stage of the epidemic, and the Chinese government implemented
relatively strict non-pharmaceutical interventions in the hot spot areas, where the public transportation was suspended within and outside of the cities in Hubei province since January 23, 2020
(Chinese Center for disease control and prevention, 2020). All nationwide residents were recommended to stay at home except for essential needs. The holiday season of the Chinese Spring
Festival had been prolonged until late February when essential services were recommenced operating gradually outside Hubei province (The State Council, The People’s Republic of China,
2020b). In April 2020, a comprehensive resumption of business started in China (The State Council, The People’s Republic of China, 2020a).
In late January 2020, the United States began reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19
(Holshue et al., 2020). There were over 1,000 cumulative confirmed cases on March 13, 2020
(World Health Organization, 2020a), when the White House declared a national emergency concerning COVID-19 outbreak (The White House, 2020b) and issued a “call to action” coronavirus
guidelines on March 16, 2020 (The White House, 2020a). The United States has become the
most severe country of COVID-19 with 366,346, 154,154, 40,468, and 94,743 cumulative confirmed cases in the states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and California by May 24,
2020 (The Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University,
2020), respectively. Making things worse, New York and California are the top two states that
contribute to the real gross domestic product (GDP) in the United States (Figure 1) (The United States Census Bureau, 2020).
The state of New York reported the first confirmed case of COVID-19 on March 1, 2020, and
proclaimed an executive order on March 16, 2020, including reducing half of the local government
workforce, allowing the statewide nonessential workforce to work from home starting on March
17, 2020, and closing all schools starting on March 18, 2020 (State of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, 2020g). Due to the rapidly increasing number of additional cases of COVID-19
in the state, the governor announced an aggressive policy of “New York State on PAUSE” on
March 20, 2020 (State of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, 2020c), and required all people
in the state to wear masks or face covering in public since April 15, 2020 (State of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, 2020f). On May 1, 2020, all statewide K-12 schools and college

facilities continued to close for the remaining academic year (State of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, 2020a). The guide of the “NY Forward Reopening” Plan was available on May 11,
2020, and three regions reopened businesses for phase one on May 15, 2020 (State of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, 2020b). By May 24, 2020, seven regions reopened for businesses
(State of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, 2020e).
The state of New Jersey reported the first positive case of COVID-19 on March 4, 2020
(State of New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, 2020a). The governor of New Jersey recommended the cancellation of statewide public gatherings over 250 individuals from March 12, 2020,
suspended visiting state prisons and statewide halfway houses effective on March 14, 2020, and
closed restaurants, bars, movie theaters, gyms, casinos from March 16, 2020 (State of New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, 2020e). The governor announced an order including the statewide
stay at home and closure of statewide non-essential retail industries on March 21, 2020 (State of New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, 2020c). State parks and golf courses reopened on
May 2, 2020 (State of New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, 2020g). Among other activities,
construction and non-essential retail provisions were allowed to resume on May 18, 2020 (State of New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, 2020f). In-person sales were authorized to reopen at
the car, motorcycle, and boat dealerships and bike shops by appointment only and with social
distancing measure on May 20,2020 (State of New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, 2020b).
The state of Connecticut reported the first positive case on March 8, 2020 (State of Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont, 2020c). New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut announced
measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 throughout the tri-state area on March 16, 2020 (State of Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont, 2020f). The governor signed an executive order for
businesses and residents “stay safe, stay home” on March 20, 2020 (State of Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont, 2020e). Statewide K-12 schools were announced to remain closed for the rest
of the academic year on May 5, 2020 (State of Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont, 2020b). The
restaurants, offices, retail stores, outdoor museum, and zoos were authorized to reopen as the
first phase on May 20, 2020 (State of Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont, 2020d) and hair salons
and barbershops were aligned to reopen in early June (State of Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont, 2020a). New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut signed a multi-state agreement on the
reopening of beaches on May 22, 2020 (State of New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, 2020d).
The state of California reported two positive cases of COVID-19 on January 26, 2020 (Office of Public Affairs, 2020d). One month later, there was the first possible case of local transmission of COIVD-19 in California (Office of Public Affairs, 2020a). The “stay home except for
essential needs” order was issued on March 19, 2020, where all individuals were required to stay
at home except for the workforce in 16 critical infrastructure sectors (Office of Public Affairs,
2020b). On May 7, 2020, the state public health officer determined that the entire state gradually
moved to Stage 2 of California’s Pandemic Resilience Roadmap, i.e., reopening the lower-risk
workplaces and other spaces (Office of Public Affairs, 2020c). Therefore, California state had
begun a phased reopening on May 8, 2020.
Due to the epidemic of COVID-19, the entire social system was slowed down and the unemployment in total nonfarm dramatically increased (Figure 8 in the supplement). The unemployment rates were 14.7% and 13.3% in April and May 2020 (U.S. Department of Labor, 2020).
Thus, the time to restore the economy in the United States, especially for the states of New
York, New Jersey, Connecticut, had been the most significant and consequential decision for the
president of the United States and the governors of the states. For people to return to work,
safety is a key concern. On April 13, 2020, seven states, including the states of New York, New
Jersey, and Connecticut, joined an effort to form a multi-state council to reopen the economy

Methods
Data collection

This work began in April and initially completed in May 2020 when there were no widespread
pretests of social injustice in the United States (Minnesota Daily, 2020). To emphasize the
effectiveness of our model for evaluating the real-time risk of the epidemic, we chose to focus
on the data before June 2020. This strategy also allowed us the opportunity to contrast our
prediction and recommendations to what took place after June 2020.
We collected the epidemic data from March 13, 2020 when the national emergency concerning COVID-19 was proclaimed to May 24, 2020 in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and
California. The data were made available by the New York Times (The New York Times, 2020).

2.2

Bayesian modelling of epidemic

Based on a WHO report, the transmission of COVID-19 could be caused by the individuals infected with the virus before significant symptoms developed (World Health Organization, 2020b),
or even the carriers who did not develop symptoms. Pre-symptomatic transmission and asymptomatic transmission interfere with our ability to understand the real magnitude of COVID-19
because of the lag from the time of catching the virus to the time of being confirmed by testing.
To overcome this issue, we divided a concerned population into four compartments: susceptible

• The susceptible (S) individuals have no immunity to the disease and are the majority of the
population at an early stage of the epidemic.
• Unidentified infectious (I) individuals are infectious but not confirmed individuals, and can
be divided into two groups: those who would eventually develop symptoms and the others
who would not develop symptoms called asymptomatic carriers. We assumed that individuals
in compartment I would move into either group H or C eventually.
• Self-healing individuals without being confirmed (H) are assumed to be no longer infectious
and resistant to COVID-19.
• Confirmed cases (C) include two groups of individuals: patients in the hospital and asymptomatic carriers who are supposed to stay at home, and unable to transmit the disease.
We introduced Susceptible (S)-Unidentified infectious (I)-Self-healing without being confirmed (H)-Confirmed cases (C) (SIHC) model to accommodate the four compartments above.
Figure 3 presents the flowchart among them.
We assumed the following dynamic system in terms of the numbers of individuals in compartments S, I, H, and C at time t, denoted by S(t), I(t), H(t), and C(t), respectively,

from catching the virus to self-healing without being confirmed; DC is the average duration from
catching the virus to be confirmed by testing; and N is the total number of population.
Let α(t) = ρθ(t). θ(t) can be controlled by policy interventions. Typically, it is a constant
at an early stage of the epidemic and decreases as the interventions are implemented until the
interventions take full effect when it reaches or nears the lowest level. Based on this point of
view, we further assumed that α(t) was a monotonically decreasing curve (Tan et al., 2020) with
four parameters α0 , d, m, and η:

α(t) = α0

where α0 denotes the maximum of α(t) at an early stage of the outbreak, d is the time that takes
for the control measures to start their effects and for α(t) to start declining, (1 − η) is the ratio
of α0 to the minimum of α(t), which is α0 (1 − η). vm was chosen as 2 log(99)
so that α(t) first

Ct , It , Ht , Ct ) and parameters Θ. Pois(·|λ) is the mass of a multi-dimensional independent Poisson distribution with mean vector λ. Similarly, we defined It+1 (Zt , Θ), Ct+1 (Zt , Θ),
Ht+1 (Zt , Θ) as the components of Zt+1 (Zt , Θ). Since N, St  It , Ht , Ct , the conditional independent Poisson likelihood of (It+1 , Ht+1 , Ct+1 ) is the Poisson approximation for the multinomial
likelihood of (St+1 , It+1 , Ht+1 , Ct+1 ), whose incident rate is (1 − (It+1 (Zt , Θ) + Ht+1 (Zt , Θ) +
Ct+1 (Zt , Θ)/N, Zt+1 (Zt , Θ)) and the total number is N (Tan et al., 2020). Notice that Zt+1 (Zt , Θ)
has no closed form, we used ode() function implemented by R package deSolve (Soetaert et al.,
2010) to solve the given system of ordinary differential equations.
Given the observable data C1:T and N , where T was the time period of observation, we set
H1 = 0, which was reasonable for the early stage of the outbreak. The numbers of individuals in
compartments I1:T and H2:T were treated as the latent variables. For simplicity, we assumed that
α(t) ≡ α(k), if k ≤ t < k + 1. Moreover, we assumed that Ht+1 = Ht+1 (Zt , Θ) a.s.; namely, Ht+1
depended completely on It , Ht and DH . In fact, our empirical observation suggested that this
simplification did not substantially alter the results, while assuming Ht+1 ∼ Pois(Ht+1 (Zt , Θ))
would have substantially increased the computational burden for the sampling procedure. We
employed a Bayesian procedure in our parameter estimation and future prediction.The posterior
distribution of the parameters was (Bolstad and Curran, 2016):
π(Ω, I1:T , H2:T | C1:T , N, d, DH , H1 )
i
h
−1
Pois(It+1 |It+1 (Zt , Θ)) Pois(Ct+1 |Ct+1 (Zt , Θ)) I(Ht+1 = Ht+1 (Zt , Θ)) ,
∝ π(Ω) ΠTt=1
where π(·) represents the prior distribution of corresponding parameter and π(· | ∗) represents
the posterior distribution of corresponding parameter given the observed data “∗”. Similarly, we
can use the posterior distribution of Zs : π(Zs |C1:T , N, d, DH , H1 ) (s > T ), to predict the spread
of infectious disease.
For prior distributions, notice that DC was governed by the mean of the incubation period.
Based on the related literature on the incubation period of COVID-19 (Lauer et al., 2020), we
chose an informative prior: the log-normal distribution with the log-mean of log(5.1) as the
prior distribution of DC . Similarly, we chose the log-normal distribution with the log-mean of
log(30) as the prior distribution of m. In other words, the interventions were assumed to take
the full effect after one month. To enhance the influence of prior information, we assumed the
log-standard deviation for both DC and m is log(1.05). The priors of the remaining parameters
were chosen to be non-informative or flat priors, i.e., π(α0 ), π(η) ∝ 1.
For the fixed parameters d, and DH , recall that d was the waiting time for interventions to
begin. We chose d as the start of implementing certain interventions, i.e, d = 8 for New York
(see “New York State on PAUSE” in Figure 2), d = 9 for New Jersey (see “statewide stay at
home” in Figure 2), d = 8 for Connecticut (see “stay safe, stay home” in Figure 2), and d = 7 for
California (see “stay home except for essential needs” in Figure 2). DH was assumed to be 9.5
according to the clinical study of asymptomatic cases (Hu et al., 2020).
Since π(Ω, I1:T , H2:T |C1:T , N, d, DH , H1 ) has no closed form, we used Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) (Ghosh et al., 2006; Andrieu et al., 2003; Chib and Greenberg, 1995; Soubeyrand,
2016) to approximate posterior distributions of parameters Ω and latent numbers of I and H at
each iteration. The Supplement provides the details of the sampling algorithm. The data and the
R files relevant to the analysis in this study are available at https://github.com/tingT0929/
Resumption-of-business. The point estimates of Ω, I1:T , H2:T and the prediction of spread
were the medians of the posterior distribution while 95% credible intervals were constructed with
2.5% and 97.5% quantiles.

Data analysis

3.1

Model estimation

We used publicly available data to simulate the possible outcomes of the outbreak of COVID-19
by varying the dates when the business reopens. Table 1 presented the parameter estimates.
These estimates were then used in our simulation models for potential second waves of COVID19 while we assessed the risk for people to return to work. The data after our models were built
and used to assess the validity of our simulation models.

32.38% with 95% CI (31.36%, 33.09%), 34.95% with 95% CI (33.04%, 36.32%), 37.74% with 95%
CI (35.72%, 38.53%), respectively, in the four states. It had been reported that the numbers of
tests per 100,000 in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and California on May 24, 2020, were
9312, 7434, 6321, and 4396, respectively (Jin, 2020). It appeared that the rate of testing was
inversely proportional to the rate of unidentified infected.
To visualize the importance of the unobserved number of unidentified infected individuals
(N − St ), rather than the observed confirmed cases (Ct ), for the assessment of epidemic risk,
we displayed the comparison between the estimated number of new daily infected individuals
and observed new daily confirmed cases in Figure 5. Note that there were gaps between the
number of new daily confirmed cases and new infected individuals in Figure 5 as a result of
the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmissions of COVID-19. This phenomenon was the
lagging effect for new daily confirmed cases, reflecting the time interval from catching the virus
to being confirmed by testing. Figure 5 indicated that we cannot ignore the lagging effect at an
early stage of the epidemic, although it seemed to disappear over time.

Evaluate the risk for reopening the economy

To appreciate the potential risk of COVID-19, we considered the estimated numbers of the only
transmissible compartment It per 100,000 for New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and California;
see Figure 6. This figure indicated that the peak of unidentified infectious individuals in New
York, New Jersey, and Connecticut had passed. So far, this remained to be the case.
California reopened the lower-risk workplaces as Stage 2 on May 8, 2020. This decision
of California was used as a reference in our consideration of resuming the business in New
York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Compared with California, the numbers of unidentified
infected individuals (It ) in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut were higher before May 8,
2020, but on clearly descending trajectories. However, while the number was low, the steady
upward trajectory in California was concerning. This upward trajectory coupled with insufficient
interventions might be the major cause for the resurgence of COVID-19 in California after the
reopening.

Figure 6: The trend of the numbers of unidentified infectious individuals per 100,000 for states
of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and California from March 13 to July 20, 2020. The
corresponding 95% credible intervals were represented in each state.
To balance the risk of epidemic versus resuming business, we considered a few choices of
Mondays in June 2020 as possible dates of reopening. We used our simulation models to predict
the numbers of unidentified infectious individuals (It ) per 100,000 for New York, New Jersey,
Connecticut, and California on June 1, June 8, June 15, June 22 and June 29, 2020. The results
were given in Table 2. Common wisdom is that the risk is regarded as reasonably low for a
population when the number of unidentified infectious persons per 100,000 is closed to 20. This
guideline was used to form cross-state travel guidelines in the United States. This was then used
as a rationale for a safe resumption of business.

To appreciate the potential risk of resuming business on different Mondays, we simulated
the possible second wave of infection after people returned to work. Unlike the first attack, we
assumed that stringent interventions would be re-enforced one week after the business was reopened. We used the estimated α̂(t) in Table 1 under “reopening” operation (6) in the Supplement
as the parameters underlying the COVID-19 transmission.

The simulated results are given in Figure 7. Brief, for New York, the simulated numbers
of cumulative confirmed cases per 100,000 on July 20 after the business was resumed on June
1, June 8, June 15, June 22 and June 29 were, respectively, 20.26%, 14.76%, 10.37%, 6.98%,
and 4.37% higher than those if the business was not resumed. For New Jersey, the simulated
numbers of cumulative confirmed cases per 100,000 on July 20 after the business was resumed
on June 1, June 8, June 15, June 22 and June 29 were, respectively, 43.91%, 33.07%, 24.15%,
16.72% and 10.70% higher than those if the business was not resumed. For Connecticut, the
simulated numbers of cumulative confirmed cases per 100,000 on July 20 after the business was
resumed on June 1, June 8, June 15, June 22 and June 29 were, respectively, 37.18%, 28.08%,
20.45%, 14.29%, and 9.12%, higher than those if the business was not resumed.

Discussion

The decision for the resumption of business is not only a public health issue but also an economic issue. What we focused on was the epidemiological feasibility of returning to work at
an early date. There were obviously many other factors to consider (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). To analyze the epidemic data of COVID-19 in New York, New
Jersey, and Connecticut, we proposed an epidemic model by considering pre-symptomatic and
asymptomatic transmissions of COVID-19. This model provided estimates for the numbers of
new daily infected individuals and new confirmed cases. The higher number of unidentified infectious individuals, the higher risk for the resumption of business was expected. From Figure 7,
we concluded that there were certain risks for the resumption of businesses on June 1, 2020, for
New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. If the governors of those states delayed the resumption

of businesses for one week or more, the simulated magnitude of the second wave of the infection
was much lower. However, the added benefit of delaying the reopening appeared less beyond one
week and even more so after.
Because California began the process of reopening economy on May 8, 2020, we used the data
in California at that time as a reference for reopening New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.
The dates when the estimated numbers of unidentified infectious individuals per 100,000 for states
of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut were close to those in California on May 8, 2020 were
June 1, 22, and 22, 2020, respectively. By following the practice in California, New York, New
Jersey, and Connecticut might consider reopening their business on June 1, 22, and 22, 2020,
respectively. Moreover, we noted that the trajectory in California was clearly in a wrong direction
as opposed to the descending trajectories New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. While the
three east coast states have become the lowest risk states, California has been suffering from a
resurgence, underscoring the importance of maintaining public health practice after reopening
business.

Moreover, there are two strategies to sample I2:T and H2:T : sequential sampling (sequentially
sample from It and Ht in each Metropolis-Hastings step or from the combined sample I2:T ) and
group sampling (sample from H2:T , and accept the samples in one Metropolis-Hastings step). The
group sampling is high dimensional if T is large. Hence, moving from one iteration of MetropolisHastings algorithm to the next is computationally intensive. The sequential sampling requires
more time for Markov chain to converge. We utilized the mixture of MCMC kernels Andrieu et al.
(2003) to combine these two sampling strategies to balance the trade-off between the acceptance
rate and the convergence time of MCMC.

Evaluation the risk of resumption of business

Figure 9: The state-specific trends of simulated confirmed cases (C) and unidentified infected
(I) per 100,000 from March 13 to June 6, 2020. The points represent the observed cumulative
confirmed cases.
For simulation of the second wave of the infection, we defined a “reopening” operation Rh
on α(t):

α(t),
t<h

Rh
α0 ,
h≤t≤h+6
α (t) =
(6)

α0 (1 − η), t ≥ h + 7
which implies the stringent interventions would be re-enforced one week after the business was
reopened at time h.
