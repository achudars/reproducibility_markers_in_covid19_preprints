Abstract – A study is presented on the use of real-time information about symptomatic
infectious individuals to adjust restrictions of human contacts at two basic levels, the stricter
being on the symptomatic infectious group. Explicit analytical formulas as well as numerical
results are presented to rapidly elucidate what-if questions on averting resurgence of the
coronavirus epidemic after the first wave wanes. Implementation of related ideas would rely
on a mix of several factors, including personal initiative and sophisticated technology for
monitoring and testing. For robust decision making on the subject, detailed multidisciplinary
studies remain indispensable.

1. Introduction

In the absence of a vaccine, restrictions on social distancing
have been used widely in recent efforts to avert an inordinately
large number of fatalities from potentially uncontrolled spread
of COVID-19.1-3 Underlying these efforts are fundamental
constraints emerging from the dynamics of infectious disease
spreading, as captured in the most elementary form by the
standard SIR model:4-7 The coronavirus basic reproductive
ratio, 𝑅𝑅0 , naturally between 2 and 3 (Figure 1)8 should be

required during an individual’s pre-symptomatic period,
although such testing would certainly be beneficial, as that
pre-symptomatic individual would be infective immediately
upon infection.16 Restrictions may be self-imposed and
assisted by telecommunications technology, a practice already
implemented in Asian countries and under consideration in the
US.17
In the rest of the paper, the basic analytical results are
derived and illustrated by numerical simulations.

where 𝛽𝛽 is the infection spread rate; 0 ≤ 𝜙𝜙 < 1 is a factor
producing a reduced spread rate, 𝜙𝜙𝜙𝜙, between susceptible and
symptomatic infectious; 𝛼𝛼, 𝛾𝛾 are the removal rates from the
pre-symptomatic and symptomatic infectious groups,
respectively; and 𝑅𝑅0 ≝ 𝛽𝛽/𝛾𝛾 is the basic reproductive ratio.
The fourth fraction, 𝑟𝑟 = 1 − 𝑠𝑠 − 𝑝𝑝 − 𝑖𝑖, refers to individuals
removed from the infectious group, by either recovery or
death. Clearly, then,

2. Containing virus spread by monitoring symptoms

𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑

The SPIR model structure (Figure 2) comprises population
fractions susceptible to the virus, 𝑠𝑠; pre-symptomatic
infectious, 𝑝𝑝; symptomatic infectious, 𝑖𝑖; and removed from
the infectious pool, 𝑟𝑟, by recovery or death. A distinction
between the SPIR model structure and other fourcompartment structures, such as the classic SEIR,4-7,18 is that
individuals with coronavirus infection entering the P group
can infect before symptoms appear. Therefore, it is practically
formidable to monitor those infecting during the presymptomatic period, as this would require inordinately
massive testing or widespread tracking of contacts to guide
selective testing. On the other hand, monitoring individuals
with symptoms is more reasonable, as symptoms are fairly
characteristic of the infection and testing for confirmation of
the infection can be highly targeted.19 This type of interaction
between the S, I, and P compartments is captured in the model
structure shown in Figure 2. This structure indicates dynamics
by separately adjustable feedback from the I group, in addition
to feedback from the P group typically considered.

Based on eqns. (1)-(4) it can be easily shown (Appendix A)

assuming 𝛼𝛼 and 𝛾𝛾 are of the same order of magnitude.20 In the
extreme, if unrealistic, case of perfect detection and full
quarantine for the symptomatic infectious (𝜙𝜙 = 0),
restrictions on the rest of the population would be about half
the size of equivalent uniform restrictions on the entire
population (𝜙𝜙 = 1).
It should be noted that eqns. (1)-(4) suggest that even
perfect restriction of virus transmission from the symptomatic
infectious alone cannot yield adequate results, as the presymptomatic infectious would be enough to infect the
population at numbers not lower enough than those without
any restrictions. Indeed, it can be shown (Appendix B) that the
total fraction of the population infected by the end of the
epidemic, 𝑟𝑟(∞), satisfies the equation

coordinated reduction of both 𝜙𝜙 and 𝛽𝛽 (restrictions both for
the symptomatic infectious and for the rest of the population,
respectively) would be required for desirable results.

the effect of corresponding policies on the resulting 𝛽𝛽,9,23 the

4. Discussion

A study was presented on the use of real-time information
about symptomatic infectious individuals to adjust restrictions
of human contacts in areas affected by coronavirus infections.
To the extent that measures can be taken to effectively
implement such restrictions, they could help effective
containment of the epidemic, particularly if combined with
ideas tailoring measures to account for risk stratification. As
already pointed out, successful implementation would hinge
on a mix of several factors, including personal initiative and
sophisticated technology for monitoring and testing. The
simple formulas and graphs presented here, based on widely
available background, will hopefully help provide guidelines
for rapidly addressing what-if questions in a transparent way.
For robust decision making detailed multidisciplinary studies
remain indispensable.24
