ABSTRACT
Despite the potential relevance to clinical outcome, intra-host dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 are
unclear. Here, we quantify and characterize intra-host variation in SARS-CoV-2 raw sequence
data uploaded to SRA as of 14 April 2020, and compare results between two sequencing
methods (amplicon and RNA-Seq). Raw fastq files were quality filtered and trimmed using
Trimmomatic, mapped to the WuhanHu1 reference genome using Bowtie2, and variants called
with bcftools mpileup. To ensure sufficient coverage, we only included samples with 10X
coverage for >90% of the genome (n=406 samples), and only variants with a depth >=10.
Derived (i.e. non-reference) alleles were found at 408 sites. The number of polymorphic sites
(i.e. sites with multiple alleles) within samples ranged from 0-13, with 72% of samples (295/406)
having at least one polymorphic site. Correlation between number of polymorphic sites and
coverage was very low for both sequencing methods (R2 < 0.1, p < 0.05). Polymorphisms were
observed >1 sample at 66 sites (range: 2-38 samples). The minor allele frequency (MAF) at
each shared polymorphic site was 0.03% - 48.5%. 33/66 sites occurred in ORF1a1b, and 37/66
changes were non-synonymous. At 10/66 sites, derived alleles were found in samples
sequenced using both methods. Polymorphic amplicon samples were found at 10/10 positions,
while polymorphic RNA-Seq samples were found at 7/10 positions. In conclusion, our results
suggest that intra-host variation is prevalent among clinical samples. While mutations resulting
from amplification and/or sequencing errors cannot be excluded, the observation of shared
polymorphic sites with high MAF across multiple samples and sequencing methods is consistent
with true underlying variation. Further investigation into intra-host evolutionary dynamics,
particularly with longitudinal sampling, is critical for broader understanding of disease
progression.

MAIN TEXT
Researchers worldwide have engaged in a remarkable effort to generate and share genomic
sequences of SARS-CoV-2, in particular to the GISAID database (gisaid.org), resulting in nearly
10,000 temporal and geo-located whole genomes available in mid-April 2020 [1]. These data,
and sophisticated methods, have enabled a robust estimation of a relatively slow population
evolutionary rate (~0.8 × 10- 3 substitutions per site per year, [2]). As additional genomes are
uploaded each day, viral dynamics on a population level can be refined in real-time.
On the other hand, a similarly thorough investigation of the intra-host evolutionary rate has yet
to be published, resulting in part from the scarcity of patient longitudinal samples. In addition,
analyzing published datasets of raw sequence data is much more time-consuming than using
consensus genomes, and the lack of a common sequencing protocol and analytical pipeline
renders comparisons among samples difficult. Finally, much less raw data have been made
available: for example, as of 14 April 2020, <1,000 raw sequence files were available from the
Short Read Archive (SRA) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).
Despite these challenges, evidence from numerous angles suggests a potentially important role
of intra-host variation. For example, a few studies have demonstrated the presence of intra-host
variation of SARS on a population level, and more intriguingly, variation occurring at the same
position in multiple individuals [3, 4]. These observations suggest that either that patients are
becoming infected with a similarly diverse viral population, or that the virus is following a similar
evolutionary trajectory in multiple patients, both of which may have clinical implications.
Furthermore, the evolution of shared variants has a well-established impact on viral replication
and tropism in both human viruses (e.g. HIV-1) and other coronaviruses (e.g. feline).
Our goal in this study was to quantify and characterize intra-host variation in all SARS-CoV-2
raw sequence data available in SRA as of 14 April 2020, and compare results between two

sequencing methods (amplicon and RNA-Seq).. A search for “SARS-CoV-2” resulted in a total
of 1173 samples. We downloaded all samples that were classified as “Wuhan seafood market
pneumonia virus” or “Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2”; host = Homo sapiens;
derived from a primary isolate; sequenced using an Illumina platform, and downloaded
successfully, resulting in a total of 441 samples (Supplemental File 1).
Raw fastq files were quality filtered and trimmed using Trimmomatic and mapped to the
WuhanHu1 reference genome (NC_045512.2) using Bowtie2. Since the reference sequence
was one of the earliest samples from geographic origin of the current pandemic, this was
considered the ancestral sequence. Bam files were sorted and indexed with samtools, and
variants called with bcftools mpileup. Only variants with a depth >=10 were retained. Individual
vcf files were merged, and allele frequencies were extracted using the vcfR package in R. The
complete commands are available in Supplemental File 2.
While all raw data was generated using the Illumina short read technology, numerous
experimental variables differed among studies, (e.g. assay type, library construction kit,
instrument, etc). We sorted the dataset into two general groups based on their sequencing
approach: those which sequenced just PCR amplicons of SARS-CoV-2 vs. those that used a
general RNA-Seq metagenomic method which typically sequences all the RNA isolated from a
sample unless specific RNA classes are excluded i.e. rRNA depletion, or enriched i.e. mRNA
selection.

Since an accurate estimation of intra-host variation requires sufficient genomic

coverage, we first investigated sample quality by visualizing mapping metrics for all samples.
In general, coverage was higher for the amplicon data compared with the RNA-Seq data
(Supplemental Figure 1). The interquartile range of mean coverage was 239 – 246 for the
amplicon data, and 9-231 for the RNA-Seq data. The percent of the genome covered at 1x was
high for both (amplicon IQR: 0.997 – 0.998; RNA-Seq IQR: 0.916 – 0.999). However, while the

percent of the genome covered at 10x and 25x remained high with the amplicon data (10x IQR:
0.987 – 0.997; 25x IQR: 0.980 – 0.997), the range was much broader for the RNA-Seq data
(10x IQR: 0.240 – 0.997; 25x IQR: 0.024 – 0.993). This suggests that, particularly for studies
investigating intra-host variation, amplicon-based sequencing may be preferable.
To ensure sufficient coverage, we excluded samples with 10X coverage for <90% of the
genome (11/41 RNA-Seq samples and 21/400 amplicon samples), resulting in a retained total of
406 samples (Supplemental File 3). Among these 406 samples, derived (i.e. non-reference)
alleles were found at 408 positions across the genome (Supplemental File 4). The number of
sites with the derived allele per sample ranged from 0-15. The number of polymorphic sites (i.e.
sites with multiple alleles) within samples ranged from 0-13, with 72% of samples (295/406)
having at least one variable site. Correlation between number of polymorphic sites and
mean/10x coverage was very low for both sequencing methods (R2 < 0.1, p < 0.05 for all cases,
Supplemental Figure 2).
We then assessed how polymorphic sites were distributed among samples. 294/406 positions
were polymorphic in at least one sample, while 66 positions were polymorphic in >1 sample. For
each site, the percentage of polymorphic samples ranged from 9.3% (38/408) for position 17747
to 0.05% (4/408) for 27 different positions (Figure 1A). Across all 66 positions, the weighted
proportion of polymorphic samples compared to all samples with the derived allele was 0.43.
Interestingly, position 17747 had both the highest number of polymorphic samples (38/408) as
well as the highest proportion of polymorphic samples (0.80).
Next we looked the minor allele frequency (MAF) in each sample for all of the 66 shared
polymorphic sites (Figure 1B). MAF per site/per sample ranged from 0.03% to 48.5%. The
combined MAF for all polymorphic samples per site ranged from 0.08% to 604%. There was a
moderate correlation between combined MAF and the number of polymorphic samples (R2 =

0.43; Figure 1B). However, two sites in particular were notable for high MAFs among multiple
samples: 8782 and 17747. When these sites were removed, the correlation was reduced (R2 =
0.23).
Of the 66 shared polymorphic positions, 50% occurred in ORF1a1b, including the two sites with
the highest MAFs (8782 and 17747). The remaining positions broke down as follows: ORF S:
n=8; ORF 3a: n=6; ORF M: n=3; ORF6: n=1; ORF8: n=2; ORF N: n=9 (Figure 1B;
Supplemental File 5). Five positions occurred in either the 5’ or 3’ UTRs. Of the 61 polymorphic
positions occurring in translated region, 59 were single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of
which 37 were non-synonymous (including position 17747), and 22 were synonymous (including
positions 8782). Two derived alleles at polymorphic positions were deletions, one of which
retained the reading frame, while the other did not.
Finally, to determine the potential effect of sequencing method on intra-sample variation, we
plotted the MAF and the number of samples with a derived variant for each of the 66 shared
polymorphic sites (Supplemental Figure 3). The majority of polymorphic sites included
samples which were sequenced using the amplicon methodology, reflecting the much more
common use of amplicon sequencing in this dataset. At 10 sites, derived alleles were found in
samples sequenced using both methods (241, 8782, 14408, 14805, 17747, 17858, 18060,
23403, 26144, and 28144). Polymorphic amplicon samples were found at all 10 positions, while
RNA-Seq processed samples were found at 7/10 positions. At the two positions with the highest
MAFs (8782 and 17757), polymorphic samples were found in both methods, although clearly
higher among the amplicon processed samples.
In conclusion, our results suggest that intra-host variation is prevalent among clinical samples,
most of which is masked when constructing consensus genomes. While this variation could be
due to amplification and/or sequencing errors, evidence supporting real virus variation includes

nonrandom distribution of polymorphic sites, shared polymorphic sites among up to 38 samples;
MAF up to 50%; and detection of polymorphisms at the same site using two very different
sequencing methods. The high number of mutations that change the amino acid suggest a
potential functional relevance. Further investigation into intra-host evolutionary dynamics,
particularly with longitudinal sampling, is critical for broader understanding of disease
progression.
