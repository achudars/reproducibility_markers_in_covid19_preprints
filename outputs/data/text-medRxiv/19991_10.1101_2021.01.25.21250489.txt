Summary
Background: Childhood immunisation services have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
WHO recommends considering outbreak risk using epidemiological criteria when deciding whether
to conduct preventive vaccination campaigns during the pandemic.
Methods: We used 2-3 models per infection to estimate the health impact of 50% reduced routine
vaccination coverage in 2020 and delay of campaign vaccination from 2020 to 2021 for measles
vaccination in Bangladesh, Chad, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Sudan, for meningococcal A
vaccination in Burkina Faso, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria, and for yellow fever vaccination in the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, and Nigeria. Our counterfactual comparative scenario was
sustaining immunisation services at coverage projections made prior to COVID-19 (i.e. without any
disruption).
Findings: Reduced routine vaccination coverage in 2020 without catch-up vaccination may lead to an
increase in measles and yellow fever disease burden in the modelled countries. Delaying planned
campaigns in Ethiopia and Nigeria by a year may significantly increased the risk of measles outbreaks
(both countries did complete their SIAS planned for 2020). For yellow fever vaccination, delay in
campaigns leads to a potential disease burden rise of >1 death per 100,000 people until the
campaigns are implemented. For meningococcal A vaccination, short term disruptions in 2020 are
unlikely to have a significant impact due to the persistence of direct and indirect benefits from past
introductory campaigns of the 1 to 29-year-old population, bolstered by inclusion of the vaccine into
the routine immunisation schedule accompanied by further catch-up campaigns.
Interpretation: The impact of COVID-19-related disruption to vaccination programs varies between
infections and countries. Planning and implementation of campaigns should consider country and
infection-specific epidemiological factors and local immunity gaps worsened by the COVID-19
pandemic when prioritising vaccines and strategies for catch-up vaccination.

Research in context
Evidence before the study
We searched PubMed for (COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (child health intervention
OR vaccin* or immuni*) AND (disruption OR suspension OR reduction) AND (indirect effect OR
health impact) on January 14, 2021, with no language restrictions. We found 178 articles of which 13
articles were relevant. Six articles reported some empirical data on immunization disruption in
Bangladesh, Japan, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain and Italy, and a survey
study focussed on immunization disruption in low and middle-income countries. One article
proposed using the WHO health systems framework to assess the effects of COVID-19 on
immunisation programmes in South Africa, another study on leveraging systems thinking and
implementation science to improve immunization system performance in Africa, and two studies
were review articles. One modelling study focused on the indirect effects, including reduction in
routine immunisation services, of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal and child mortality in lowincome and middle-income countries. Another modelling study focused on a benefit-risk analysis of
routine childhood immunisation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa. We also found one other
study in the grey literature that analysed the impact on SARS-CoV-2 infections as a result of fixedpost and door-to-door vaccination campaigns targeted at children under five years of age in an
Ethiopia-like setting.
Added value of this study
We estimated the increase in cases and deaths caused by the disruption to immunisation services
leading to outbreaks for measles, meningococcal A and yellow fever in 10 countries. The reduction in
routine immunisation coverage among under-immunised cohorts of children has enhanced the risk
of outbreaks which cannot be averted without catch-up vaccination. This can lead to an increase of
9.89% (0.91 additional deaths per 100,000 individuals, or 48,000 in total) across the three diseases
from 2020 to 2030 in the countries considered. Results vary by infection and country, but generally
most excess deaths are due to measles. Postponing campaign immunisation may not have a
detrimental short-term health impact if campaign immunisation is implemented ahead of future
outbreaks caused by these immunity gaps.
Implications of the available evidence
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions to routine services and vaccination
campaigns and resulted in immunity gaps with potential to cause outbreaks in the affected
populations. The short-term and long-term health impact differ between measles, meningococcal A
and yellow fever vaccination and by countries based on the local epidemiological situation. Thereby,
catch-up vaccination should be planned by considering the heterogeneity in population susceptibility
across different countries to measles, meningococcal A and yellow fever outbreaks and
implemented in time to prevent these outbreaks. The study findings can inform risk-benefit trade-off
discussions around the timing of campaigns.

Introduction
Childhood immunisation services have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic in at least 68
countries during 2020 with around 80 million under one-year-old children being affected.1–4 This has
occurred for several reasons – the diversion of health care staff, facilities, and finances to deal with
COVID-19 treatment and response; reluctance of individuals to bring children to be vaccinated due
to fear of infection; barriers to travel due to local physical distancing measures; disruptions in
vaccine supply chains; lack of personal protective equipment; and decisions to stop or postpone
vaccination campaigns to reduce the risk of transmission during such campaigns.
The World Health Organization (WHO) issued guidance in March 2020 on immunisation activities
during the COVID-19 pandemic.5 The guidance recommended a temporary suspension of mass
vaccination campaigns, but continuation of routine immunisation services by the health systems
while maintaining physical distancing and infection prevention and control measures for COVID-19.
Routine immunisation was one of the most disrupted services relative to other essential health
services based on a WHO pulse survey in May and June 2020 that was focused on continuity of
essential health services during the COVID-19 pandemic.6 WHO, UNICEF, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance,
and their partners also conducted two pulse polls in April and June 2020 to understand COVID-19related disruptions to immunisation services.7 Based on respondents from 82 countries, pulse polls
indicated that there was widespread disruption to routine immunisation services in addition to the
suspension of mass vaccination campaigns. The main reasons reported for this disruption were low
availability of personal protection equipment for healthcare workers, low availability of health
workers, and travel restrictions.
Disruptions to routine health care due to the COVID-19 pandemic are projected to increase child and
maternal deaths in low-income and middle-income countries.8 No country has made a policy
decision to stop routine immunisation during a COVID-19 epidemic. Risk-benefit analysis of countries
in Africa shows routine immunisation to have far greater benefits than risks even in the context of
the COVID-19 pandemic.9 Nevertheless, routine immunisation coverage has dropped in most
countries.7
Evidence on the health impact of suspending vaccination campaigns during the COVID-19 pandemic
is limited. Modelling indicates that both fixed post and door-to-door campaigns targeting under 5year-old children may cause temporary minor increases in total SARS-CoV-2 infections.10 However,
avoiding campaigns during the local peak of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is key to reducing the effect
size, and SARS-CoV-2 transmission during campaigns can be minimised with good personal
protective equipment and limiting movement of vaccinators.10 The WHO recommends that countries
consider the risk of outbreaks using epidemiological criteria when deciding whether to conduct
preventive vaccination campaigns during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the guidance was not based
on any quantitative assessment of transmission risk for either COVID-19 or existing vaccinepreventable diseases.11

Hence, countries need to assess the health impact of postponing vaccination campaigns, which can
inform the epidemiological risk assessment for outbreaks due to campaign delays and prioritise
which vaccines to use in campaigns.12 The need for such assessments is greatest in low- and lower
middle-income countries which generally have greater risks of vaccine-preventable disease
outbreaks and limited health care resources to deal with COVID-19 epidemics. It is difficult to
quantify the impact of different scenarios using only observational data, which does not give the
counterfactual to what actually happened in 2020. To address this, we used transmission dynamic
models to project alternative scenarios about postponing vaccination campaigns alongside
disruption of routine immunisation, for three antigens with high outbreak potential and for which
mass vaccination campaigns are a key delivery mode alongside routine immunisation – measles,
meningococcal A, and yellow fever.

Methods
Deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to measles, meningococcal A and yellow fever
under different routine and campaign vaccination scenarios were projected in a subset of 10 lowand lower middle-income countries over the years 2020-2030. Projections were made using
previously validated transmission dynamic models; we used three models for measles, two models
for meningococcal A, and two models for yellow fever. The results of the models were averaged
using the arithmetic mean of their predictions for deaths and DALYs. Guidance used by the different
models for DALY calculations are publicly accessible.13
The chosen countries were low- and lower-middle-income countries that had planned vaccination
campaigns in 2020 and were selected following consultations with partners in WHO, UNICEF, CDC
and other organisations. Thereby, the selected countries differ between infections – Bangladesh,
Chad, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Sudan for measles; Burkina Faso, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria
for meningococcal A; Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, and Nigeria for yellow fever.
Models used routine and campaign vaccination coverage from WUENIC and post campaign surveys
for 2000-2019,14 and future projections of routine coverage based on assumptions agreed with
disease and immunisation programme experts at the global, regional, and national levels (see Table
S11). We explored four scenarios that assumed different levels of disruption in the year 2020 to
routine immunisation and postponement of campaigns projected in the scenarios, due to COVID-19
(see Table 2). The disruption scenarios are based on 50% reduction in routine immunisation and/or
suspension of campaign vaccination in 2020 and postponement to 2021. These disruption scenarios
aimed to approximate plausible drops in routine coverage levels and plausible delays to campaigns
due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We estimated the health impact of these disruption scenarios in comparison to the counterfactual
scenario of no disruption (BAU – business-as-usual scenario) for measles, meningococcal A, and
yellow fever during 2020-2030. We estimated the health impact of routine and campaign
immunisation disruption through projections of total deaths (and DALYs) per 100,000 population,
excess deaths (and DALYs) per 100,000 population, and excess deaths (and DALYs) during 20202030 which were scaled relative to the maximum number of excess deaths (or DALYs) across all
scenarios. We did not assume any changes to case-fatality risks as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic.

Results
The health impact varies across the disruption scenarios for the three infections in the different
countries. Figure 1 shows the average model predicted total deaths per 100,000 population per year
during 2020-2030 (see Figure S1 for similar projections for DALYs impact, Tables 3 and S1 for
scenario averages over the entire time period, and Table S3-S11 for absolute numbers of deaths).
In the case of measles, Bangladesh initially postponed its campaign by a few months; models suggest
that this does not lead to increased risk of outbreaks but a reduction in routine immunisation
coverage in 2020 leads to increased risk of outbreaks during 2028-2030. This leads to an average
increase in deaths per 100,000 of 0.015 for 2020 - 2030 when the campaign is delayed, but an
average increase of 0.16 if routine coverage drops. For Ethiopia, the postponement of immunisation
campaigns from 2020 to 2021 would have led to increased risk of outbreaks in 2020 while a
reduction in routine immunisation coverage in 2020 would not lead to increased risk of outbreaks in
2020. Overall this equates to an average increase of 2.26 deaths per 100,000 in 2030-2030 for a drop
in routine coverage and an increase of 1.78 if the campaign is delayed. The Ethiopian campaign was
eventually reinstated only three months later than scheduled, following consideration of these
findings. For Kenya, the disruption to routine and campaign immunisation would not lead to
increased risk of outbreaks, due to high coverage of the first dose of measles vaccine and better
optimally-timed campaigns in preventing outbreaks during 2020-2030 though coverage of the
second-dose of measles vaccine is sub-optimal.
For Nigeria, the postponement of immunisation campaigns from 2020 to 2021 would not impact the
risk of the next projected outbreak in 2025, while a reduction in routine immunisation coverage in
2020 brings forward the risk of the next projected outbreak from 2025 to 2023. Over 2020 - 2030
this leads to an increase in deaths per 100,000 of 0.23 when routine coverage drops and 0.10 when
campaigns are delayed. For South Sudan, the postponement of immunisation campaigns from 2020
to 2021 would be beneficial in averting a potential outbreak in 2022 leading to a reduction in deaths
per 100,000 of 3.84 over 2020-2030. For Chad, the postponement of immunisation campaigns from
2020 to 2021 would lead to increased risk of outbreaks in 2020 while a reduction in routine
immunisation coverage in 2020 without catch-up may bring forward the risk of the next projected
outbreak from 2023 to 2022. However, overall the average deaths per 100,000 may increase by 1.24
from 2020-2030 if routine coverage drops and decreases by 1.01 if a campaign is delayed. Modelspecific estimates of measles deaths per 100,000 per country are provided in Table S2 with absolute
numbers for all countries per model given in Table S11.
In the case of meningococcal A (MenA), the short-term disruption to routine immunisation in
Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria and Chad, as well as the short-term disruption of immunisation
campaigns in Nigeria and Chad would not have a significant impact on the disease incidence, see
Table S4 for model-specific estimates by country. These four countries conducted mass preventive
campaigns targeting 1-29-year-old populations between 2010 and 2014, and introduced the vaccine

into their routine immunization schedules between 2016 and 2019. Niger and Burkina Faso
completed catch-up campaigns concomitantly with the introduction into routine, and Chad and
Nigeria have started but not completed their catch-up campaigns. A maximum of a 4% increase in
MenA deaths over the long term is projected and with minimal change in the short term of within 5
years. This is because of the persistence of protection against MenA due to the vaccination strategy
combining mass vaccination campaign and routine introduction, which led to a lasting interruption
of transmission, in particular from the direct and indirect effects of the initial mass campaigns of the
1-29-year-old population in 2010-2014.
In the case of yellow fever, for the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria, the postponement of
immunisation campaigns from 2020 to 2021 was predicted to cause a short-term increase in burden
but when campaigns were implemented, the overall burden was reduced for the time period. A
reduction in routine immunization during 2020 was predicted to increase burden over the same
period 2020-2030. . For Ghana, the postponement of immunisation campaigns from 2020 to 2021
does not increase the yellow fever burden in the short-term, whereas a reduction in routine
immunization in 2020 increases the yellow fever burden by, on average, 0.2 deaths per 100,000
between 2020 and 2030. Model-specific estimates of excess deaths by country from 2020 to 2030
are shown in Table S6. Neither model was designed to specifically capture yellow fever outbreak
dynamics. Therefore, although the delay of immunisation campaigns was predicted to reduce the
burden of yellow fever for 2020-2030 in select settings by a small (less than 1%) amount, the
increased risk of an outbreak is not accounted for in the models and this could outweigh the
predicted long-term benefits.
Figure 2 shows the average model predicted excess deaths per 100,000 population per year for
routine and campaign immunisation disruption scenarios in comparison to no disruption scenario for
measles, meningococcal A, and yellow fever. The excess deaths are summed over 2020-2030 (see
Figure S2 for similar projections for DALYs impact). The scale of excess mortality due to the
immunisation service disruptions are higher for measles vaccination in comparison to meningococcal
A and yellow fever vaccination; indeed excess mortality is minimal for meningococcal A.
Figure S3 shows the normalised average model predicted excess deaths per year and country for
routine and campaign immunisation disruption scenarios in comparison to no disruption scenario for
measles, meningococcal A, and yellow fever, and the excess deaths are summed and normalised
over 2020-2030 (see Figure S4 for similar projections for DALYs impact). For measles, a 50%
reduction in routine immunisation is projected to increase the excess deaths the most in comparison
to scenarios involving the postponement of immunisation campaigns from 2020 to 2021 for
Bangladesh, Chad and South Sudan and (with a delay to campaigns) in Nigeria. For MenA, a 50%
reduction in routine immunisation and the postponement of immunisation campaigns from 2020 to
2021 is projected to increase the excess deaths the most for Chad, though the scale of absolute
impact is minimal (see Figure 2). For yellow fever, a reduction in routine immunisation is projected
to increase the excess deaths the most (either in conjunction with campaign delay or not). Whilst

the postponement of immunisation campaigns from 2020 to 2021 appears to have a beneficial
impact of lower deaths in comparison to immunisation campaigns in 2020 for the Democratic
Republic of the Congo in Figure S3, this does not capture the short-term increase in burden due to
the missed campaign. The beneficial effect is due solely to the proportionally larger campaign
implemented in 2021, that is a campaign with the same coverage leads to more fully vaccinated
persons as the population grows.

Discussion
The health impact of routine immunisation service disruptions and mass vaccination campaign
suspensions due to the COVID-19 pandemic differs widely between infections and countries, so
decision-makers need to consider their local epidemiological situation. For meningococcal A and
yellow fever, we predict that postponing campaigns has a minimal short-term effect because both
pathogens have a low effective reproduction number and strong existing herd immunity from recent
campaigns in the countries modelled (see Table S17). However, this is influenced by the model
structures and their propensity to capture outbreak dynamics, which particularly affects the
predictions for yellow fever. For measles, in some countries such as Ethiopia and Nigeria, even a
one-year postponement of immunisation campaigns could have led to large outbreaks, but both
countries were able to implement planned SIAs in 2020 after a few months’ delay. In other countries
with high routine immunisation coverage and/or recent campaigns, SIAs may be postponed by a year
without causing large outbreaks.
In some of our modelled scenarios, postponement of immunisation campaigns does not appear to
increase overall cases, if the delay time-period is less than the interval to the next outbreak. Such a
scenario is inferred in the immunisation disruption scenarios for postponement of measles
campaigns for South Sudan. This does not imply that a postponement is preferred, as we do not take
into account other contextual or programmatic factors; rather it reflects the effectiveness of
campaigns in closing the immunity gaps and the demographic effect of including more children in
delayed campaigns. In instances with very low routine immunisation coverage, there is possibility
that the vaccination campaign is the main opportunity for missed children to be vaccinated. Thus for
the same proportion of the same age group targeted by campaigns, more children will be vaccinated
for the same coverage levels in countries with birth rates increasing over time. While these results
may be useful in the COVID-19 context, there is also considerable uncertainty around both model
findings and data inputs such as incidence and vaccine coverage that prohibits further general
comment on the optimal timing of campaigns.
The measles immunisation campaigns for 2020 in Nigeria were specifically targeted at Kogi and Niger
states that were originally scheduled for inclusion in the campaigns for 2019 across northern Nigeria
but were delayed for other reasons. These campaigns were implemented in October 2020. Given
the localised nature of susceptibility and targeted campaigns specifically to these two states to
address the low routine immunisation coverage and the long window between campaigns, there is a
high risk of localised outbreaks in these two states in 2021. In general, for countries where routine
immunization coverage was low even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the build-up of the susceptible
population from low routine immunisation coverage over two to three years between campaigns
enhances the risk of outbreaks more than recent and temporary disruptions to routine
immunisation. Further, our models did not include the possibility that COVID-19 restrictions may
have temporarily reduced measles transmissibility and the risk of measles outbreaks due to reduced
chance of introduction of infection into populations with immunity gaps. This risk rises again rapidly

once travel restrictions and physical distancing are relaxed, thereby underlying the significance of
implementing postponed immunisation campaigns at the earliest to prevent measles outbreaks as
COVID-19 restrictions are lifted.15
While the degree of health impact of service disruptions varies, the average models show that
reductions in routine immunization coverage have a far greater impact on predicted excess deaths
over the next decade for all infections modeled than postponement of campaigns. This has
significant implications for countries planning catch-up strategies and highlights the need for
increased emphasis on the importance of implementing catch-up as an ongoing part of routine
immunization.12
The disease burden averted by measles and meningococcal A vaccination are primarily among
under-5-year-old and under-10-year-old children respectively, and disease burden averted by yellow
fever vaccination are among younger age-group individuals. Since children and younger age-group
individuals are at relatively lower risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 in comparison to
elderly population, the health benefits of sustaining measles, meningococcal A, and yellow fever
immunisation programmes during the COVID-19 pandemic outweighs the excess SARS-CoV-2
infection risk associated with vaccination service delivery points. Thereby, the delivery of measles,
meningococcal A, and yellow fever immunisation services should continue, as logistically as possible,
by adapting service delivery in a COVID-secure manner with implementation of SARS-CoV-2 infection
prevention and control measures.
Our study has limitations and we have not considered logistical constraints posed by the COVID-19
prevention and control measures on vaccine supply, demand for vaccination, access, and health
workforce. Future introduction of COVID-19 vaccination may also divert the workforce normally
conducting campaigns for other vaccines. Our models do not reflect geographical heterogeneity subnationally, whereas in reality this is a key feature. Nor do we incorporate known seasonality of
infections, which may affect the window of opportunity for catching up. The models used in this
analysis, in particular for yellow fever, are best suited to capture long-term changes in disease
burden due to vaccination and cannot capture outbreak dynamics that may arise in the short-term.
A key strength of our analysis is that we used 2-3 models for each infection, which allowed
investigation of whether projections were sensitive to model structure and assumptions. We did
indeed find quantitative differences between models of the same infection, but most models agreed
on the countries in which disruptions had the largest effect on disease burden.
We conducted our health impact assessment to align with the WHO framework for decision making
using an evidence-based approach to assist in prioritisation of vaccines and strategies for catch-up
vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic.12 The framework highlights three main steps, with the
primary step being an epidemiological risk assessment for each disease based on the burden of
disease and population immunity, as well as the risk factors associated with the immunisation
service disruptions. The second step focuses on the amenability of delivery strategies and

operational factors for each vaccine, and the third step on the assessment of contextual factors and
competing needs.
Our health impact assessment addresses in part the primary step of an epidemiological risk
assessment by estimating the disease burden for different immunisation scenarios, but does not
include the health impact assessment of excess COVID-19 disease burden attributable to these
immunisation scenarios. While we have assessed the immunity gaps caused by immunisation service
disruptions for measles, meningococcal A, and yellow fever vaccination in 10 low- and lower middleincome countries, sustaining routine immunisation and resuming immunisation campaigns during
the COVID-19 pandemic requires adaptations to service delivery with additional safety measures to
protect the health workers and the community from SARS-CoV-2 infection.16 Infection prevention
and control measures include personal protective equipment for health workers and children to be
vaccinated and their parents or caregivers, additional prevention and control measures against
SARS-CoV-2 infection at vaccination sites, physical distancing, and symptomatic screening and
triaging.11 COVID-19 transmission may be further mitigated by delivering several vaccines during a
single campaign (such as measles and polio vaccines), or even combining vaccines with other agerelevant interventions such as nutritional supplements. Further, social mobilisation is needed to
address the rumours, misinformation, and fear among the community to access vaccination safely
during the COVID-19 pandemic.17 Therefore, our health impact assessment needs to be followed up
by planning and implementation of catch-up vaccination to close the immunity gaps using a mixture
of locally-appropriate strategies to strengthen immunisation,18 alongside access to additional
operating costs to conduct routine and campaign immunisation services safely in COVID-secure
environments while considering contextual factors and competing needs.

Year

Year of vaccination

Age from

Minimum age (in years) of the target population

Age to

Maximum age (in years) of the target population

Age range verbatim

Age of the target population, as provided by WHO or other coverage
source

Coverage (national level)

Percentage of the target population vaccinated, specified at a national
level.

Target (national level)

Number of people in the target age range, in the entire country.

Subnational campaign

Campaigns which took place sub-nationally, rather than across the whole
country.

Number vaccinated

Number of individuals vaccinated in a campaign. Where necessary, a
demographic cap was applied to constrain the number vaccinated to be no
higher than UNWPP records of the total number in the target age group.
(UNWPP: United Nations World Population Prospects, 2019 Revision).

Affected by COVID-19

Values are shown for 2020 campaigns only. FALSE: 2020 campaigns
unaffected by COVID-19, e.g. campaigns which took place in early 2020.
These campaigns are retained in all disruption scenarios.

Model descriptions (appendix)
Measles Model - PSU
The Penn State model is a measles transmission and vaccination model developed at Pennsylvania
State University. It is an age-structured compartmental transmission dynamic model with
compartments for susceptible, infected, recovered (due to infection or vaccination) subpopulations.
A proportion of infected people will die depending on their age and country characteristics,1 as per
the LSHTM model. The model projects the total number of infections and deaths in 1-year age
cohorts, up to age 100 years, in each year according to an annual attack rate that is modeled as a
logistic function of the annualized proportion of the population that is susceptible. The slope and
intercept of this logistic function, which governs the proportion of available susceptibles that are
infected in each year, is fitted independently for each country to observed annual case reporting and
vaccination coverage (routine and supplemental campaigns) for each country between 1980-2017;
for details on the fitting methods see Eilertson et al.2 Historical annual surveillance data is not
available for all countries and thus these parameters cannot be estimated; specifically, for Palestine
and Kosovo we use the average of parameter values for all other countries, for South Sudan, we use
the parameter estimates for Sudan. Vaccine efficacy for routine immunization is assumed to depend
on the age at first dose (9m or 12m) as described in Simons et al.3 The second routine dose is
assumed to be preferentially delivered to those children who received the first dose and SIA doses
are assumed to be independent of receipt of the first routine dose.
Measles Model - DynaMICE
DynaMICE (DYNAmic Measles Immunisation Calculation Engine) is a measles transmission and
vaccination model developed by LSHTM with input from Harvard University and the University of
Montreal. It is an age-structured compartmental transmission dynamic model with compartments
for maternal immune, susceptible, infected, recovered, and vaccinated subpopulations. A proportion
of infected people will die depending on their age and country characteristics.1 The population is
also stratified by age with weekly age classes up to age 3 years, and annual age classes thereafter up
to 100 years. The force of infection is calculated by combining an age-dependent social contact
matrix from the POLYMOD study,4 demographic distribution for each country, and an estimated
probability of transmission per contact. The probability of transmission per contact is then estimated
from the basic reproduction number of measles using the principal eigenvalue method. Vaccination
is incorporated as a pulse function and can be delivered to any age or range of ages and in either
routine or campaign delivery. Vaccine efficacy is dependent on age and the number of doses
received.5 The model has been previously described in detail.6,7
Measles Model - IDM
The IDM model for Nigeria was built using EMOD8 – an agent-based stochastic disease transmission
model. The EMOD software is open-source, and the model and documentation of the EMOD

software are available at the IDM website.9 The model presented here is a discrete-time (daily time
steps), an individual-based form of an MSEIR (maternally protected-susceptible-exposed-infectiousrecovered) model. A specific prior application of the EMOD model to measles in Nigeria is described
in Zimmermann et al10; the model employed here is similar but is structured at a finer spatial scale.
The transmission dynamics include seasonality, age-stratified heterogeneous transmission, and
spatial metapopulations coupled by migration, the parameters of which have been calibrated to
reproduce the seasonality, age-distribution, and spatial correlation of measles cases in Nigeria.
Routine vaccination with a first dose is delivered to covered individuals at 9 months of age; the
second dose at 12 months; and SIA vaccination is distributed to covered individuals in the target age
range in a pulse over the course of 2 weeks; no correlation between the two routine doses or
between the routine and SIA doses is assumed.
Men A Model - Cambridge
The University of Cambridge MenA model is a compartmental transmission dynamic model of
Neisseria meningitidis group A (NmA) carriage and disease to investigate the impact of immunisation
with a group A meningococcal conjugate vaccine, known as MenAfriVac, as published by Karachaliou
et al.11 The model is age-structured (1-year age groups up to age 100) with continuous ageing
between groups. Model parameters were based on the available literature and African data
wherever possible, with the model calibrated on an ad-hoc basis as described below.
The population is divided into four states, which represent their status with respect to the meningitis
infection. Individuals may be susceptible, carriers, ill or recovered, and in each of these states be
vaccinated or unvaccinated, with vaccinated individuals having lower risks of infection (carriage
acquisition) and disease (rate of invasion). We assume that both carriers and ill individuals are
infectious and can transmit the bacteria to susceptible individuals. The model captures the key
features of meningococcal epidemiology, including seasonality, which is implemented by forcing the
transmission rate, the extent of which varies stochastically every year.
Since only a small proportion of infected individuals develop the invasive disease, disease-induced
deaths are not included in the model. From each compartment, there is a natural death rate from all
causes. Carriage prevalence and disease incidence vary with age, and the model parameterised
these distributions using a dataset from Niger;12 the case:carrier ratio consequently varies with age.
The duration of 'natural immunity' is an important driver of disease dynamics in the absence of
vaccination but good data on this parameter is lacking; instead, prior estimates are used.13
The model assumes that mass vaccination campaigns occur as discrete events whereas routine
immunisation takes place continuously. We allowed the duration of protection to vary uniformly
between 5 years and 20 years for the 0-4-year-olds and 10-20 years for over 5-year-olds. For the 200
runs, we selected pairs of values for these two parameters so that duration of protection for the
older age group is not shorter than the duration of protection for 0-4-year-olds.14,15 Vaccine efficacy
against carriage and disease is 90%.

Disease surveillance is not comprehensive across the meningitis belt, so the disease burden is
uncertain in several countries. Therefore, the model classifies the countries into three categories,
based on the incidence levels using historical data. This classification defines the transmission
dynamic parameters. The model generates estimates of case incidence, to which a 10% case-fatality
ratio is applied to estimate mortality.16 To estimate DALYs it is assumed that 7·2% of survivors have
major disabling sequelae with a disability weight of 0·26.17
Countries were stratified into high and medium risk, and different infection risks applied based on
this stratification. As there was insufficient information to define infection risk on a country-bycountry basis, the approach/stratification was agreed upon with experts in the WHO meningitis
team. For countries only partly within the meningitis belt, only the (subnational) area at risk was
included.
To produce estimates on the impact of vaccination, 200 simulation runs were generated by
stochastically varying the baseline transmission rate to reflect between-year climactic or another
external variability. Although each individual simulation reflects the reality of irregular and periodic
epidemics, as visually compared to time series from Chad and Burkina Faso and analysis of interepidemic periods, the resulting averaged estimates give a stable expected burden of disease over
time. Uncertainty in other model parameters is currently not quantified.
Men A Model - KP
The KP model for serogroup A Neisseria meningitidis (MenA) was developed at Kaiser Permanente
Washington in partnership with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Burkina
Faso Ministry of Health.18,19 It is a dynamic, age-structured, stochastic compartmental transmission
model, with compartments to represent MenA colonization, disease, and immunity. Natural
infection with MenA is assumed to lead to resistance to future colonization and disease, and
repeated infections further reduce risk, although protection wanes over time. The age-dependent
force of infection (“who acquires infection from whom”) matrix varies seasonally to account for
differential MenA transmission between dry and rainy seasons. Model parameters, including the
force of infection, were estimated using approximate Bayesian calculation, with prior distributions
informed by the literature. Mass campaigns occur among persons aged 1-29 years (possibly with
catch-up campaigns at the initiation of routine immunization), in which immunization is assumed to
occur in the first week of the month during which a campaign is scheduled. Routine immunization is
assumed to occur during the first week of the month in which a child reaches 9 months of age.
Yellow Fever Model - Imperial College London
The Imperial College London yellow fever model is a static transmission model assuming a constant
force of infection (FOI) for each country at risk of YF. It is estimated from YF occurrence data as well
as serological data where available. The model also uses environmental covariates, information on
vaccination activities, and demographic projections to estimate relative risk and thus transmission

intensity for YF. The original framework was developed by Garske et al20 and was subsequently
extended by Jean et al21 and Gaythorpe et al22. The full model description is given in Gaythorpe et
al.22
Yellow Fever Model - University of Notre Dame
The University of Notre Dame yellow fever (YFV) model is a static transmission model that assumes a
constant force of infection (FOI) for each endemic country.23 Yellow fever infections in the human
population are thus modeled as spillover events from non-human primates, so human-to-human
transmission observed in urban outbreaks is not considered. Accordingly, our model is intended to
capture long-term changes in YFV burden on account of changes in vaccination coverage rather than
to realistically capture interannual variability due to YFV epizootics in non-human primates and
occasional outbreaks in humans.
We calibrated our YFV transmission model to multiple sources of epidemiological data collected in
sub-Saharan Africa at the first administrative level subnationally. First, we quantified past exposure
to YFV by estimating the force of infection in 23 administrative units using data collected in
serological surveys. We then related the predicted number of YFV infections at each of the 23
administrative units to the corresponding reported outbreak data collated by Garske et al20 to
quantify the extent of underreporting. We then obtained estimates of the total number of infections
at each administrative unit in sub-Saharan Africa by relating our estimates of underreporting to the
total number of reported cases and deaths in each administrative unit. This allowed us to estimate a
posterior distribution of a single FOI for each administrative unit in sub-Saharan Africa. Because the
FOIs that we estimated are sensitive to the number of reported cases and deaths, we smoothed
across our estimates by performing a regression analysis with spatial covariates. We considered
multiple regression models and generated an ensemble prediction by weighting the predicted FOI
from each regression model based on performance in ten-fold cross-validation at the country level.
National-level FOI estimates were obtained by weighting the ensemble spatial prediction of FOI
according to WorldPop 2015 population density estimates at the first administrative level and then
summing to obtain national FOIs.24
To project the number of yellow fever cases and deaths in each country under a given vaccination
coverage scenario, we first scaled the national-level FOI by the proportion of the population that is
unvaccinated. We then used the scaled FOI estimate to project the annual number of YFV infections
and multiplied this quantity by the probabilities of disease and death reported by Johansson et al25
to obtain estimates of the annual number of YFV cases and deaths. We assume a 0.975 probability of
protection from infection among those who are vaccinated based on Jean et al,26 with this level of
protection assumed to be lifelong based on a single dose. In the event of campaigns, we assume that
individuals are vaccinated randomly and irrespective of prior vaccination through another campaign
or routine vaccination.
