We leverage powerful time-series data from a national longitudinal sample measured before
the COVID-19 pandemic and during the world’s eighth most stringent COVID-19 lockdown
(New Zealand, March-April 2020, N = 940) and apply Bayesian multilevel mediation models
to rigorously test five theories of pandemic distress. Findings: (1) during lockdown, rest diminished distress; without rest psychological distress would have been ∼ 1.74 times greater; (2)
an elevated sense of community reduced distress, a little, but elevated government satisfaction
was inert. Thus, the psychological benefits of lockdown extended to political discontents; (3)
most lockdown distress arose from dissatisfaction from personal relationships. Social captivity, more than isolation, proved challenging; (4-5) Health and business satisfaction were
stable; were they challenged substantially more distress would have ensued. Thus, lockdown
benefited psychological health by affording safety, yet only because income remained secure.
These national longitudinal findings clarify the mental health effects of stringent infectious
disease containment.

Studies from Australia, China, Italy, Japan, and the United
States find substantially elevated psychological distress during the early COVID-19 pandemic (Biddle et al., 2020;
McGinty et al., 2020; Moccia et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2020;
Twenge & Joiner, 2020; Yamamoto et al., 2020). These studies propose three mechanisms to explain pandemic distress.
m1 Distress elevation from SARS-CoV-2 health risks (Qiu
et al., 2020; Twenge & Joiner, 2020);
m2 Distress elevation from economic downturn (Twenge
& Joiner, 2020);
m3 Distress elevation from social isolation (Van Bavel et
al., 2020).
Early into the pandemic, New Zealanders also reported increased psychological distress, although at much lower lev-

els (Sibley, Greaves, et al., 2020). Such a muted distress
response is surprising because, at the time, New Zealanders
faced health and economic uncertainties resembling those in
countries that experienced severe distress (Appendix C). Additionally, New Zealand’s March/April lockdown was independently rated as the world’s 8th most stringent. It required
sheltering-in-place with domestic cohabitants, and resulted
in a sudden loss of ordinary business and social routines (Appendix C). Importantly, the effectiveness, duration, and economic consequences of New Zealand’s "go-hard, go-early"
pandemic lockdown were unknown at the time, and presently
remain unknown.
In their study of social attitudes and well-being during New
Zealand’s early COVID-19 lockdown, Sibley, Greaves, et

BULBULIA, PIVEN . . . SIBLEY ET AL.

al. (2020) propose two mechanisms for mitigating pandemic
distress:
m4 Distress buffering from greater institutional trust;
m5 Distress buffering from an elevated sense of civic community.
This proposal was based on the observation that institutional
trust and civic attitudes were elevated during New Zealand’s
early COVID-19 lockdown, as well as orthogonal evidence
that positive public and civic attitudes affect mental health
(Sibley, Greaves, et al., 2020).
Presently, a systematic quantitative understanding of psychological distress production and mitigation at the outset of a
pandemic – one that uses longitudinal data within participants from pre-pandemic baselines to infer mechanisms of
distress elevation and buffering – remains elusive. However,
to the extent that mental health forms part of a government’s
public health strategy, such a causal understanding is important wherever lethal infectious disease containment improves from repeated or prolonged lockdowns (Van Bavel et
al., 2020).
Here, we leverage longitudinal data from a national probability sample of New Zealanders who responded to the New
Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) during the
first 18 days of New Zealand’s stringent COVID-19 lockdown from 26th March – 12th April 2020. We systematically
quantify changes in psychological distress within the same
individuals using their previous year’s responses as baseline.
This approach affords a powerful tool for inference because:
1. The NZAVS has multiple indicators for parameters
theorised to affect pandemic distress in five domains
of current interest: (m1) personal health: health satisfaction, subjective health, rumination, and fatigue;
(m2) economic concerns: satisfaction with the econ-

satisfaction; (m3) social relationships: social support,
social belonging, and satisfaction with personal relationships; (m4) institutional trust: satisfaction with
the government, trust in politicians, willingness to engage with the police, and trust in the police; (m5) civic
attitudes: satisfaction with social conditions, national
identification, patriotism, and sense of neighbourhood
community;
2. To measure psychological distress, the NZAVS uses
the Kessler-6 scale, a diagnostically reliable measure
used in clinical screening of anxiety and depression
in many countries, including New Zealand (Kessler et
al., 2002; Kessler et al., 2010; Krynen et al., 2013;
Prochaska et al., 2012);
3. The NZAVS lockdown sample is demographically diverse and exhibits varied responses across the spectrum of theoretically relevant parameters.
4. Longitudinal mediation models quantify the extent to
which changes in psychological distress were caused
by changes in the availability and abundance of theoretically postulated pandemic distress parameters
within the same individuals pre/during the pandemic
lockdown. This affords systematic tests for many theories of pandemic distress. For example, if elevated
health concerns were responsible for greater lockdown distress, as has been theorised, we would expect
those who became more concerned about their health
to present greater distress during lockdown compared
with the previous year. If relationship dissatisfaction
were to cause distress in the absence of economic and
health concerns, we would infer that it was the effect
of sheltering-in-place on relationship satisfaction that
caused psychological distress, rather than the effects
of health and economic uncertainties on relationship
satisfaction that caused the psychological distress. (Indeed, this is what we observe).
5. Longitudinal mediation models quantitatively clarify
theoretically important counterfactuals about the magnitudes of distress people would have experienced had
distress-related parameters changed during lockdown.
For example, although we observe that social belonging and satisfaction with future security were not elevated during lockdown, our statistical models indicate
how much extra distress would have been caused had
these parameters been compromised. Such clarity is
important for policy-making during pandemics in the
same way that surveying unknown waters is important
for navigating ships: to avoid hazards we need to chart
them.

NATIONAL LOCKDOWN DISTRESS MECHANISMS

Method
Sample
The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) is a
national panel study that has been tracking social attitudes,
personality, and health outcomes within the same individuals
since 2009 (Ns = 6,441–47,951). Here, we conduct a novel
analysis of the rolling NZAVS 2020 data-frame first used by
Sibley, Greaves, et al. (2020) (pre-registration of that study:
Sibley, Greaves, et al., 2020). The pre/post pandemic onset panel is composed of 940 participants who responded to
both Wave 10 (2018) and Wave 11 (2020) of the NZAVS,
which were taken respectively before and during the first
eighteen days of New Zealand’s first COVID-19 lockdown
(March 26th to April 12th ). The Time 10 (2018) NZAVS contained responses from 47,951 participants (18,010 retained
from one or more previous waves). A full comparison of
the lockdown sample and full NZAVS pre-COVID-19 baseline reveals that the lockdown panel was similar to the full
NZAVS national probability sample, showing good demographic coverage of the country’s population (see: Appendix
E). We report sample descriptive statistics in Table D1.
Mediators of Pandemic Distress
The five areas encompassing the indicators we used to investigate mediation (or "indirect") effects on psychological
distress are: (m1) personal health, (m2) economic concerns,
(m3) social relationships, (m4) institutional trust, and (m5)
civic attitudes. All indicators were obtained from Sibley,
Greaves, et al. (2020)’s preregistered study describing overall changes in attitudes and well-being during New Zealand’s
March/April 2020 lockdown: https://osf.io/e765a/. We used
only those indicators identified in the preregistered study for
which there was longitudinal information (the preregistered
study took a propensity-score matching approach, and some
indicators used in that study were not available in the previous NZAVS wave). We measured psychological distress
using the Kessler-6 scale (Kessler et al., 2002), which exhibits strong diagnostic concordance for moderate and severe
psychological distress (Kessler et al., 2010; Prochaska et al.,
2012). We present full sample descriptive statistics for these
indicators in Appendix D.
Statistical models
We estimated multilevel mediation models using the bmlm
package in R (Vuorre, 2017). Using standard mediation
model notation:
1. a is the regression slope of the lockdown on a mediator
(X→M)
2. b is the regression slope of the mediator on distress
(M→Y )

3. c0 is the regression slope of the lockdown on distress
(X→Y, the direct effect)
4. (me) is the mediated effect (a*b + σa j b j )
5. c is the total effect of X on Y (c= c0 + me).
In the mediation graphs, we report coefficients for the population means, with 95% Bayesian credible intervals in adjacent brackets. We also report coefficients for individuallevel variation for all paths (τa , τb , τc 0 ) (see: Tables G1–
G19), these are indicated by "SD" coefficients on the directed
graphs in Figures F1–F19. Though reporting individual-level
variation in not common in population health studies, identifying patterns of psychological distress in sub-populations is
relevant to public mental health because there may be numerically many instances of mental health challenge at the margins of a population, which are not evident in the expected
population means. Consider an analogy to infectious disease.
The SARS-CoV2 virus causes mortality in less than 1% of
infectious cases; it is lethal only at the population margin,
yet capable of overwhelming a country’s health resources.
Though less apparent than a piling up of corpses in hospital
corridors, strong challenges to mental health among minority
segments of a population during and following a pandemic
must be documented and explained (on the 1918 influenza
see: Menninger, 1920; Supplement A discusses individual
differences). For a detailed description of our statistical models see Appendix D. The R scripts for this study are available
at https://osf.io/5gza8/.
Results
Health mediators of lockdown distress
We do not find a reliable effect of the lockdown on health
satisfaction (a = -0.07, [-0.17, 0.04], τa = 0.15, [0.01, 0.42]),
and so there was not a mediation effect of the lockdown on
distress through health satisfaction (me = 0.01,[-0.03, 0.04]).
However, we find health satisfaction reliably predicted lower
psychological distress (b = -0.16, [-0.26, -0.06], τb = 0.27,
[0.17, 0.38]). Thus, had health satisfaction been compromised during the lockdown, people would have experienced
greater psychological distress (see: Figure F1 and Table G1).
The lockdown did not reliably affect subjective health ratings (a = 0.04, [-0.02, 0.09], τa = 0.07, [0.00, 0.21]), and so
there was not a mediation effect of the lockdown on distress
through subjective health ratings (me = -0.02, [-0.06, 0.03]).
However, subjective health ratings predicted lower psychological distress (b = -0.48, [-0.68, -0.28], τb = 0.69, [0.45,
0.92]). Thus, had subjective health ratings been compromised during the lockdown, people would have experienced
greater psychological distress (see: Figure F2 and Table G2).
Similarly, at the population-level average, the lockdown did
not reliably affect rumination (a = -0.03, [-0.08, 0.02], τa =
0.12, [0.02, 0.27]), and so there was not a mediation effect

of the lockdown on distress through rumination (me = -0.06,
[-0.16, 0.03]). However, elevated rumination strongly predicted psychological distress (b = 1.53, [1.33, 1.72], τb =
1.00, [0.81, 1.19]). Thus, had rumination increased during
the lockdown, people would have experienced greater psychological distress (see: Figure F3 and Table G3).
At the population-level average, we find that the lockdown
reduced fatigue (a = -0.21, [-0.26, -0.16], τa = 0.11, [0.01,
0.29]), and that this reduction in fatigue indirectly reduced
psychological distress (me = -0.19, [-0.27, -0.11]). Without
such a reduction in fatigue, observed psychological distress
(the total effect: c0 = 0.44, [0.27, 0.60], τc0 = 0.22, [0.02,
0.57]) would have been substantially greater (c = 0.25, [0.08,
0.42]). Thus, rest during the lockdown was a powerful buffer
against psychological distress. Figure F4 presents mediation
results for fatigue (see: Table G4).
Economic mediators of lockdown distress
We do not find a reliable effect of the lockdown on satisfaction with the economy (a = 0.06, [-0.07, 0.19], τa = 0.24,
[0.03, 0.54]), and so there was not a mediation effect of the
lockdown on distress through satisfaction with the economy
(me = 0.01, [-0.02, 0.05]). This is because satisfaction with
the economy did not reliably predict psychological distress
(b = -0.05, [-0.13, 0.02], τb = 0.19, [0.08, 0.31]) (see: Figure
F5 and Table G5).
There was not a reliable effect of the lockdown on satisfaction with standard of living (a = 0.01, [-0.08, 0.10], τa = 0.17,
[0.01, 0.42]), and so there was not a mediation effect of the
lockdown on distress through satisfaction with standard of
living (me = 0.01, [-0.03, 0.05]). However, satisfaction with
standard of living predicted lower psychological distress (b =
-0.13, [-0.24, -0.01], τb = 0.30, [0.15, 0.45]). Thus, had satisfaction with standard of living been compromised during
the lockdown, people would have experienced greater psychological distress (see: Figure F6 and Table G6).
There was not a reliable effect of the lockdown on satisfaction with future security (a = -0.10, [-0.22, 0.03], τa = 0.32,
[0.07, 0.61]), and so there was not a mediation effect of the
lockdown on distress through satisfaction with future security (me = 0.01, [-0.06, 0.08]). However, satisfaction with future security reliably predicted lower psychological distress
(b = -0.11, [-0.20, -0.02], τb = 0.40, [0.28, 0.51]). Thus, had
satisfaction with future security been compromised during
the lockdown, people would have experienced greater psychological distress (see: Figure F7 and Table G7).
We find a reliable effect of the lockdown on business satisfaction (a = -0.32, [-0.44, -0.20], τa = 0.69, [0.50, 0.93]);
however, there was not a reliable mediation effect of the lockdown on distress through business satisfaction (me = -0.01, [0.07, 0.06]). This is because business satisfaction did not re-

liably predict psychological distress (b = -0.04, [-0.14, 0.05],
τb = 0.16, [0.02, 0.31]). However, we caution that substantial declines in business satisfaction are evident in about a
quarter of the population (see: Section A). Thus, although at
the population-level average business satisfaction did not reliably predict psychological distress, we find signals of augmented distress among a sizable subgroup who fell in business satisfaction (see: Figure F8 and Table G8).
We do not find a reliable effect of the lockdown on social support (a = 0.03, [-0.03, 0.08], τa = 0.10, [0.01, 0.26]), and so
there was not a mediation effect of the lockdown on distress
through social support (me = 0.00, [-0.05, 0.07]). However,
social support reliably buffered people from psychological
distress (b = -0.49, [-0.70, -0.27], τb = 0.76, [0.48, 1.03]).
Thus, had social support been compromised during the lockdown, people would have experienced greater psychological
distress (see: Figure F9 and Table G9).
We do not find a reliable effect of the lockdown on social
belonging (a = -0.03, [-0.08, 0.01], τa = 0.07, [0.00, 0.18]),
and so there was not a mediation effect for the lockdown on
distress through social belonging (me = 0.02, [-0.02, 0.07]).
However, social belonging reliably predicted lower psychological distress (b = -0.56, [-0.77, -0.36], τb = 0.71, [0.50,
0.92]). Thus, had social belonging been compromised during
the lockdown, people would have experienced more distress
(see: Figure F10 and Table G10).
We find that the lockdown decreased satisfaction with personal relationships (a = -1.18, [-1.33, -1.03], τa = 0.61,
[0.34, 0.89]), and that satisfaction with personal relationships reliably predicted lower psychological distress (b = 0.16, [-0.24, -0.07], τb = 0.27, [0.16, 0.38]); hence, there
was a reliable mediation effect of the lockdown on distress
through (dis)satisfaction with personal relationships (me =
0.20, [0.09, 0.32], (c = 0.25, [0.08, 0.42]). Indeed, the mediation effect here rendered the direct effect of lockdown on
distress unreliable (c0 = 0.05, [-0.15, 0.24], τ0c = 1.30, [0.75,
2.15]). Thus, relationship dissatisfaction during the lockdown was a powerful instigator of psychological distress.
Figure F11 presents mediation results for satisfaction with
personal relationships (see: Table G11).
Institutional trust mediators of lockdown distress
We find a reliable effect of the lockdown on satisfaction with
the performance of government (a = 1.48, [1.36, 1.60], τa
= 0.27, [0.03, 0.62]), but not a mediation effect of the lockdown on distress through satisfaction with the performance
of government (me = 0.10, [-0.03, 0.23]). This is because
satisfaction with the performance of government did not reliably predict psychological distress (b = 0.07, [-0.01, 0.16],
τb = 0.16, [0.02, 0.34]) (see: Figure F12 and Table G12).

cians (a = 0.39, [0.32, 0.47], τa = 0.11, [0.01, 0.29]), but not
a mediation effect of the lockdown on distress through trust
in politicians (me = 0.01, [-0.05, 0.08]). This is because trust
in politicians did not reliably predict psychological distress
(b = 0.02, [-0.11, 0.16], τb = 0.50, [0.30, 0.69]) (see: Figure
F13 and Table G13).
We find a reliable effect of the lockdown on willingness to
engage with the police (a = -0.16, [-0.21, -0.10], τa = 0.24,
[0.12, 0.41]), but not a mediation effect of the lockdown on
distress through willingness to engage with the police (me =
-0.03, [-0.10, 0.04]). This is because willingness to engage
with the police did not reliably predict psychological distress
(b = 0.00, [-0.21, 0.21], τb = 0.63, [0.34, 0.89]) (see: Figure
F14 and Table G14).
We find a reliable effect of the lockdown on trust in the police (a = 0.27, [0.21, 0.32], τa = 0.13, [0.01, 0.32]), but not a
mediation effect of the lockdown on distress through trust in
the police (me = -0.05, [-0.11, 0.01]). This is because trust in
the police did not reliably predict psychological distress (b =
-0.18, [-0.37, 0.02], τb = 0.23, [0.03, 0.47]) (see: Figure F15
and Table G15).
Civic and community mediators of lockdown distress
We find a reliable effect of the lockdown on satisfaction with
social conditions (a = 0.14, [0.02, 0.27], τa = 0.26, [0.03,
0.56]), but not a mediation effect of the lockdown on distress through satisfaction with social conditions (me = 0.00,
[-0.03, 0.04]). This is because satisfaction with social conditions did not reliably predict psychological distress (b =
-0.03, [-0.12, 0.05], τb = 0.13, [0.01, 0.28]) (see: Figure F16
and Table G16).
We find a reliable effect of the lockdown on national identity
(a = 0.09, [0.05, 0.13], τa = 0.21, [0.10, 0.38]), but not a mediation effect of the lockdown on distress through national
identity (me = 0.01, [-0.04, 0.07]). This is because national
identity did not reliably predict psychological distress (b =
0.21, [-0.08, 0.54], τb = 0.54, [0.13, 0.92]) (see: Figure F17
and Table G17).

(me = -0.05, [-0.11, 0.00]). Because sense of neighbourhood
community reliably predicts lower psychological distress (b
= -0.13, [-0.26, -0.01], τb = 0.28, [0.12, 0.45]), the increase
in a sense of neighbourhood community during the lockdown
helped to buffer people from greater psychological distress.
Figure F19 presents mediation results for sense of neighbourhood community (see: Table G19).
Discussion
(1) Rest during the lockdown diminished psychological
distress
Fatigue reduction powerfully mitigated psychological
distress during New Zealand’s stringent lockdown in
March/April 2020. To clarify the mechanism of this effect,
we graph the relationship between the fitted values of the
model for the ’a’ path (X→M) in Figure 1.i. Here, we find
an expected reduction in fatigue across the population during
the lockdown. We next graph the relationship between the
fitted values of the model for the ’b’ path (M→Y) in Figure
1.ii. Here, we find expected increases in psychological
distress for increasing levels of fatigue. Although not all
New Zealanders were afforded relief from fatigue during
lockdown, such as essential workers and parents with
children (Twenge & Joiner, 2020), were it not for a general
reduction in fatigue across most of the population, we
estimate that psychological distress during the lockdown
would have been 1.74 times greater (Fatigue c = 0.25 [0.08,
0.42], Fatigue cp = 0.44 [0.27, 0.60]).
Figure 1
Panel (i) presents the fitted values for the ’a’ path X→M, indicating that the lockdown caused people to feel less fatigue.
Panel (ii) presents the fitted values for the ’b’ path (M→Y),
indicating that psychological distress is strongly sensitive to
levels of fatigue. The model indicates that psychological distress would have been 1.74 times greater had lockdown not
reduced fatigue.

We find a reliable effect of the lockdown on patriotism (a =
0.24, [0.20, 0.28], τa = 0.18, [0.07, 0.33]), but not a mediation effect of the lockdown on distress through patriotism (me
= 0.08, [-0.01, 0.19]). However, interestingly, patriotism predicted greater psychological distress (b = 0.27, [0.00, 0.54],
τb = 0.99, [0.37, 1.36]), though with substantial individuallevel variability (τb = 0.99, [0.37, 1.36], see Section A) (see:
Figure F18 and Table G18).
We find a reliable effect of the lockdown on sense of neighbourhood community (a = 0.25, [0.18, 0.33], τa = 0.18,
[0.02, 0.43]), and a reliable mediation effect of the lockdown
on distress through a sense of neighbourhood community

The association between fatigue and psychological distress has long been observed (Pawlikowska et al., 1994;

Thorndike, 1900); however, longitudinal dynamics of fatigue
and mental health across a population remain poorly understood. The powerful psychological distress buffering that we
observe from reduced fatigue suggests the systematic study
of rest is likely important for pandemic mental health research, and for public mental health more generally. (On
measures, see: Dittner et al., 2004).

(2) Stable health satisfaction during the lockdown spared
psychological distress
Despite the pandemic health uncertainties confronting New
Zealand during the March/April 2020 lockdown, health satisfaction and subjective health ratings did not decline, and
levels of rumination were not elevated. Statistical models reveal that had health satisfaction and subjective health
declined, and rumination elevated, psychological distress
would have risen (see: Figure B1). These results indicate
that New Zealand’s initial sheltering-in-place lockdown sustained mental health because it afforded physical health security. Generalising, our findings add credibility to Qiu et
al. (2020)’s and Twenge and Joiner (2020)’s speculation that
health concerns drove psychological distress during the early
COVID-19 pandemic in settings where personal infectious
disease risks were high.

(3) Stable standards of living during the lockdown spared
psychological distress

(4) The lockdown strained personal relationships and this
strain accounts for most of the psychological distress that
people experienced
Despite requirements for sheltering-in-place, social support
and social belonging were conserved during New Zealand’s
stringent March/April pandemic lockdown. We quantitatively demonstrate that were these parameters not conserved
at pre-pandemic levels during the lockdown, psychological
distress would have been substantially worse (see: Figure
B3). This result supports Van Bavel et al. (2020)’s theory
that maintaining social connection when physically distancing protects mental health.
However, New Zealand’s shelter-in-place lockdown exacted
a toll on satisfaction with personal relationships. Indeed,
the psychological distress that New Zealanders experienced
during lockdown mostly arose from dissatisfaction with personal relationships (see: Figure 3).
Figure 2
Panel (i) presents the fitted values for the ’a’ path (X→M),
indicating that the lockdown caused people to feel less satisfaction with their personal relationships. Panel (ii) presents
the fitted values for the ’b’ path (M→Y), indicating that lower
satisfaction with personal relationships increases psychological distress. Indeed, the mediation effect of relationship
dissatisfaction (me = 0.20, [0.09, 0.32]) was strong enough
to render the direct effect of the lockdown on psychological
distress unreliable (c0 = 0.05, [-0.15, 0.24]). This finding
implies that relationship dissatisfaction was a powerful engine of psychological distress during New Zealand’s early
COVID-19 lockdown.

Levels of business satisfaction dropped from pre-pandemic
levels during New Zealand’s March/April lockdown. That
business satisfaction declined is, on reflection, not surprising,
considering all non-essential businesses were closed to the
public for an indefinite period. Among a sizeable subgroup
of the population this drop in business satisfaction provoked
psychological distress.
Importantly, however, satisfaction with standard of living and
future security were maintained at pre-pandemic levels. This
stability is both surprising and important. It reveals that even
in a setting of pervasive pandemic economic uncertainties
and forced business closures, maintaining satisfaction with
standard of living and a sense of future security is possible.
Moreover, the strong sensitivity of psychological distress to
economic security implies that had economic concerns become elevated, psychological distress during the lockdown
would also have become more elevated (see: Figure B2). We
infer that New Zealand’s rapid and robust administration of
economic relief to citizens benefited mental health during the
lockdown because it afforded economic security.

The lockdown could have challenged personal relationships
in a number of ways. One possibility is that the lockdown
hindered close connections with friends and family outside
of the home (Van Bavel et al., 2020). Yet, if this were

the primary reason for the declines in satisfaction with personal relationships then the same negative effects would have
emerged with social support and belonging.
Pietromonaco and Overall (2020) theorise that confinement
in the home not only reduced people’s ability to control personal space, but required them to share the increased difficulties in balancing work, childcare and household labour. By
narrowing personal networks, lockdown also amplified the
risk of stress contagion and the burden of support for those
in the home. All of these pressures are established risks to
psychological health (Pietromonaco & Overall, 2020).

Figure 3
Panel (i) presents the fitted values for the ’a’ path (X→M),
indicating that the lockdown caused people to feel greater
satisfaction with the New Zealand government. However,
panel (ii) presents the fitted values for the ’b’ path (M→Y),
indicating that in New Zealand psychological distress is not
generally sensitive to levels of satisfaction with the government’s performance. In a setting such as New Zealand’s, it
is not necessary to shift a population’s satisfaction with the
government to prevent elevation in pandemic distress.

Our finding supports Pietromonaco and Overall (2020)’s theory that a stringent pandemic lockdown strains personal relationships, and furthermore reveals that such strains led to
greater psychological distress. However, the present dataset
does not allow us to infer which features of romantic relationship strain caused psychological distress to increase during
lockdown, a matter for future investigations.
(5) Greater satisfaction with the performance of the government did not reduce psychological distress
Despite a strong increase in satisfaction with the government,
we do not observe a mediation effect of satisfaction with the
government on psychological distress. This is because satisfaction with the government is not causally related to psychological distress. In New Zealand’s democracy, where 50–
60% of the population differ in their attitudes to major political parties, it is unsurprising that satisfaction with the government’s performance does not predict psychological distress.
We cannot infer whether this finding generalises to countries
where levels of satisfaction with the performance of the government are much lower.
(6) During the lockdown an elevated sense of neighbourhood community reduced psychological distress
Consistent with Sibley, Greaves, et al. (2020)’s theory, we
observe that an elevated sense of neighbourhood community
contributed to reducing pandemic distress (see: Figure 4).
Notably, the relationship between civic sensibilities and distress is weaker for abstract national orientations than it is for
neighbourhood orientations.
(7) Key inference: at the onset of a lethal pandemic, the
public health benefits of infectious disease containment
extend to mental health
The late onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand
gave the country’s public health response a head start (see
Appendix C). A cross-sectional study of Italy’s lockdown
of April 10th –13th 2020 reveals substantial population-level
distress (Moccia et al., 2020); however, the pandemic struck

Panel (i) presents the fitted values for the ’a’ path (X→M),
indicating that the lockdown caused people to feel a greater
sense of neighbourhood community. Panel (ii) presents the
fitted values for the ’b’ path (M→Y), indicating elevated
neighbourhood community predicts lower psychological distress. This result suggests that in a setting such as New
Zealand’s, improving a sense of neighbourhood community
reduces pandemic psychological distress.

Italy early and with tragically high mortality. From the vantage point of early disease containment, it is relative timing
that counts. Our national longitudinal study of pandemic distress dynamics leverages pre-pandemic responses to quantitatively demonstrate that there is a parallel benefit of infectious disease containment for psychological health. Why
was distress only moderately elevated during New Zealand’s
early pandemic in March/April? The answer is that New
Zealand was in a strict and economically supportive pandemic lockdown. We find that New Zealand’s public health
response tended to maintain New Zealanders’ sense of health
and financial security, as well as their sense of social support
and belonging. Additionally, we find that had these parameters been compromised, psychological distress would have
been much worse (see: Figure B1). Moreover, we observe
that an elevated sense of community played a small role in
preserving residents mental health, and that a reduction in fatigue – rest – played a considerable role (see: Figure 1). The
causal effects of fatigue and rest on psychological distress
is an important horizon at the boundary of psychological
science and public health. Importantly, sheltering-in-place
strained personal relationships, and it was this strain that accounted for much of the distress that New Zealanders experienced during the country’s sheltering-in-place pandemic
lockdown in March/April 2020.
Overall, New Zealand’s avoidance of the greater psychological distress found in other countries during the early COVID19 pandemic reveals that the emergence of a new and lethal
infectious disease need not fate a society to severe mental
health burdens. Whether these benefits extend to subsequent pandemic lockdowns, and whether lockdowns generally sustain mental health over the long-term is presently unclear. Long-term mental health trajectories rely on an interplay of long-term social, health, and economic trajectories.
These are questions of contemporary speculation and debate
which we cannot resolve here (see: McKibbin and Fernando,
2020; Wang and Tang, 2020). On the other hand, it has
long been understood that strict infectious disease containment benefits public health (Soper, 1919). Our findings are
important to current and future pandemic planning because
they quantitatively clarify fundamental psychological mechanisms through which stringent infectious disease containment strategies sustain mental health when lethal pandemics
first strike.
Future Research
The limitations of our study suggest following opportunities
for future research.
1. Pandemic distress mechanisms are potentially dynamic, cumulative, and nonlinear. Here, however,
we restrict inferences about mechanisms of mental
health to the onset of a lethal pandemic. We use

data originally collected for Sibley, Greaves, et al.
(2020)’s matched propensity-score investigation of attitudes and well-being during the first 18 days of New
Zealand’s pandemic. These data cannot clarify longterm pandemic distress dynamics. As longer windows
of data become available, future research should investigate these dynamics.
2. The present study takes the form of a natural experiment, with the control condition consisting of
within-participant baselines obtained from the previous year. However, clearly, the random assignment
of New Zealanders to pandemic conditions resembling
Wuhan, Lombardy, New York City, or elsewhere is
neither possible nor desirable. Our statistical models are able to quantitatively predict how much worse
distress would have been had parameters important to
mental health been compromised (see: Figures B1–
B5). Additionally, these models allow disentangling
the effects of the pandemic lockdown from the effects
of health and economic uncertainties owing to the pandemic more generally. For example, because relationship dissatisfaction occurred in the absence of health
and business concerns, we were able to infer that distress from relationship dissatisfaction arose from the
demands of sheltering-in-place. However, we cannot
estimate how much the mediation parameters themselves would have changed had the early pandemic
taken a different form. Such an inference would rely
on comparative panel data which is not presently available.
3. Relatedly, fundamental questions about the mechanisms of psychological distress in other countries require additional assumptions that our data cannot directly address. We cannot, for example, infer that
people in other countries would have responded similarly to New Zealanders had they experienced New
Zealand’s "go-hard, go-early" pandemic response.
To address these limitations, we recommend that national
longitudinal health studies include indicators of psychological distress (we recommend the Kessler-6), as well as locally
validated indicators for subjective health concerns, economic
concerns, personal relationships, institutional trust, and civic
sensibilities.

NATIONAL LOCKDOWN DISTRESS MECHANISMS

Appendix A
Investigation of Individual Differences in Psychological Distress
Individual differences in health mediators
The coefficients for the four health dimensions are graphed in Figure A1a.i–A1d.i. In addition to the population-level
coefficients, we include individual-level estimates for a, b, and me parameters in Figure A1 (rows ii-iv); these individual-level
estimates afford a window into patterns of individual difference. There is more uncertainty in estimates of the lockdown’s
direct effect on health satisfaction (τa = 0.15, [0.01, 0.42], see: Figure A1a.ii and Figure F1), than its effect on subjective health
ratings (i.e., short form health) (τa = 0.07, [0.00, 0.21], see: Figure A1b.ii and Figure F2).
There were comparable magnitudes of individual-level variation in the lockdown’s effect on rumination (τa = 0.12,
[0.02, 0.27], see: Figure A1c.ii and Figure F3). Furthermore, we observe structured variation at the individual-level mediation
estimates for rumination, where 6% were expected to be lower than -0.25 points in distress response (τme = -0.06 [-0.44,
0.28]). The relief from diminished rumination at the lower end of distress is evident in Figure A1c.iv.
This pattern we observe for the effect of diminished rumination on distress reduction is consistent with the pattern
we observe for the effect of diminished fatigue on distress reduction; however, as noted, mediation effects for fatigue were
reliable (me = -0.19, [-0.27, -0.11]). Similar to rumination, the mediation effect for fatigue exhibited a downward pull at the
lower end of the distress response spectrum (τme = -0.19 [-0.55, 0.12], see: Figure A1d.ii and Figure F4).
Individual differences in economic mediators
In Figure A2 we present the results for the four economic dimensions; to clarify individual differences we also include
individual-level estimates for the mediation parameters.
We observe individual-level variation in the effects of lockdown on future security τa = 0.32, [0.07, 0.61]). Here,
15.2% of the individual-level variances in future security were estimated to have fallen by more than 0.25 points, and 0.1%
lower than 0.5 points, a rare but steep decline. We estimated substantial increases in distress greater than 0.25 points to arise
from loss of future security in 0.3% of the population (see: Figure A2c.iv.). Though such effects were rare, they are not trivial.
We observe substantial individual-level variation in the effects of lockdown on business satisfaction τa = 0.69, [0.50,
0.93]), presented in Figure A2d.ii. The minor elevation of business satisfaction in a minority of the population masked greater
declines in business satisfaction, that were particularly severe at the lower end. Whereas only 0.002% of the individual-level
variance in τa for business satisfaction increased by greater than 0.25 points, 57.2% of the individual-level variances were
dropped by more than 0.25 points, and 32.1% dropped by more than 0.5 points in business satisfaction (see: Figure A2d.ii).
While there is uncertainty at the margins of the business satisfaction mediation effect, only 0.002% of the individual-level
variances exhibited declines of more than 0.2 points, and 1% exhibited increases in excess of 0.2 points (see: Figure A2d.iv).
However, business satisfaction does not strongly or reliably affect psychological distress, which suggests business satisfaction
would constrain the mediation effect even if lockdown were to have had a stronger effect on business satisfaction (b = -0.04,
[-0.14, 0.05]).
Individual differences in social relationship mediators
In Figure A3 we present the results for the three social relationship parameters; to clarify individual differences we
also include individual-level estimates for the mediation parameters (rows ii–iv).
We observe strong sensitivity of distress to both social support τb = 0.76, [0.48, 1.03]), and social belonging (τb =
0.71, [0.50, 0.92], see: Figure A3a.iii and A3b.iii), yet little movement in these parameters during lockdown (social support,
τa = 0.10, [0.01, 0.26]; social belonging, τa = 0.07, [0.00, 0.18]). Thus, consistent with speculation in Van Bavel et al. (2020),
these results suggest that had social support or social belonging suffered, New Zealanders would have experienced stronger
challenges to mental health across the population.
At the individual-level, we observe substantial variation in the effect of lockdown on relationship (dis)satisfaction
(τa = 0.61 [0.34, 0.89]). As evident in Figure A3d.ii, such variation was greater at the low end of the distress response
spectrum, with 16.9% of individual-level estimates falling by more than 1.5 points, and 2% falling by more than 2 points. As
evident in Figure A3d.iv, there were strong mediation effects at the high end of the distress response spectrum, where 8.2%
of the individual-level estimates exceeded a 0.5 point expected increase in psychological distress, and 1% exceeded a 1 point

expected increase. Given the relative stability of health and economic concerns that we previously observed, we infer that
the increase in relationship dissatisfaction arose from the requirement to shelter-in-place with domestic cohabitants. Though
people felt safe in their health, future security, and standard of living, their personal relationships suffered.
Individual differences in institutional trust mediators
In Figure A4 we present the results for the four institutional trust dimensions; to clarify individual differences we also
include individual-level estimates for the mediation parameters (rows ii–iv).
We observe substantial individual variation in the relationship between trust of politicians on psychological distress τb
= 0.50, [0.30, 0.69], and willingness to engage with the police on psychological distress (τb = 0.63, [0.34, 0.89], see: Figure
A4b.iii and c.iii). New Zealanders, then, differ in how these two dimensions of institutional distrust affect psychological
distress; understanding these differences is a matter for future investigations.
Individual differences in civic community mediators
In Figure A5 we present the results for the four civic community dimensions; to clarify individual differences parameters, we also include individual-level estimates (rows ii–iv).
We observe substantial and structured individual variability in the relationship between lockdown and both national
identity and patriotism (national identity τa = 0.21, [0.10, 0.38]; patriotism τa = 0.18, [0.07, 0.33], see: Figures A5b.ii and
A5c.ii). We also find substantial variability in the relationship of these two parameters to psychological distress (national
identity, τb = 0.54, [0.13, 0.92]; patriotism τb = 0.99 [0.37, 1.36], see: Figures A5b.iii and A5c.iii), corresponding to variability in the individual-level mediation effects for these parameters, see Figure A5b.iv and A5c.iv. In the case of patriotism,
whereas 1% of individual-level estimates were lower than -0.25 points in psychological distress, 6% were greater than 0.25
points in psychological distress. Why the increase in patriotism from lockdown should increase psychological distress for that
segment of the New Zealand population is a matter for future investigation. By contrast, the expected benefits of increased
neighbourhood community were consistent with predictions.

NATIONAL LOCKDOWN DISTRESS MECHANISMS

Appendix C
Background
As New Zealand entered its first national COVID-19 lockdown at midnight on 25th March, the country confronted
three pandemic challenges to mental health. First, the lockdown occurred in a setting of nationwide health uncertainty.
On 25th February, the New Zealand Ministry of Health indicated that ICU beds across regional DHBs totalled 176
(“COVID-19 (novel coronavirus) update - 25 February,”
2020), less than 3.5 beds for every 100,000 residents. On 28th
February, the country declared its first COVID-19 case, and
on 5th March, the country reported its first case of person-toperson transmission. On 19th March, New Zealand closed
its borders to residents and non-citizens. On 20th March,
New Zealand announced its 4-level COVID-19 Alert System, which described a series of progressively restrictive
state-mandated physical distancing restrictions (“Alert system overview,” 2020). That same day, the country moved to
Alert Level 2. On 23rd March, the Ministry of Health reported its first case of suspected community transmission,
and that day moved to Alert Level 3; all public gatherings, including funerals and religious worship, were prohibited by the government on the same day. When the country moved into Alert Level 4 (nationwide lockdown), New
Zealand’s COVID-19 infection rates were taking off exponentially. New Zealand’s disease modellers predicted that
without stringent physical distancing measures, the surge of
severe COVID-19 infections would overwhelm the country’s
healthcare system by June (James et al., 2020). On 1st April,
61 new cases were reported; On 2nd April, there were 89
new cases; On April 3rd , there were 71 new cases; On April
4th , there were 82 new cases. By April 12th , New Zealand
had already reported its second death. Despite high levels of public compliance with restrictive lockdown measures
(Google, 2020; “HorizonPoll - Horizon Research NZ online
poll,” 2020), a geometric growth in mortality soon followed.
Epidemiological models predicted that even a reduction of
the virus transmission rate to R0 = 1.2 would eventually result in the deaths of 1.58% of the country’s population (James
et al., 2020). At the same time, images of Wuhan, Lombardy,
and New York City were flooding the country.
Second, New Zealand’s severe economic and social March/April 2020 lockdown occurred in a setting of
pervasive economic uncertainty. By 3rd February, the New
Zealand Government restricted entry for those travelling
from mainland China, closing a key tourism market. By
early March, local and global financial markets were spiralling downward. On 16th March, the Government halted
share trading and the New Zealand Reserve Bank announced
emergency cuts to its lending rate. On 17th March, the New
Zealand government announced an emergency economic
support package for businesses and workers valued at 4% of

25

national GDP (NZD $12.1B)(Strongman, 2020). Financial
forecasters were predicting declines in New Zealand’s GDP
of at least 5% and at least a doubling of the country’s unemployment rate (“Budget Economic and Fiscal Update 2020,”
2020).
Third, New Zealand’s Alert Level 4 restrictions during March/April 2020 were amongst the most severe in the
world, resulting in a sudden loss of ordinary economic and
social routines for most of the population. Specifically, New
Zealand’s Alert Level 4 lockdown mandated: (1) homebased isolation and limiting of contact to households; (2)
restrictions on recreational activity: some forms of isolated
recreational activity were permitted, but only in one’s local
area; (3) limiting travel to essential activities or services; (4)
cancellations of all gatherings, including funerals, and closure of all public venues; (5) closure of all businesses except for essential services (supermarkets, pharmacies, clinics, petrol stations and lifeline utilities); (6) closure of all
educational facilities; (7) rationing of supplies and, where
needed, the requisitioning of facilities for managed isolation and COVID-19 testing; and (8), the re-prioritisation
of healthcare services to manage COVID-19 disease progression (“Alert system overview,” 2020). An independent
stringency test ranked New Zealand the 8th most restrictive country, scoring 96.30 out of a possible 100 severity
points (“COVID-19: Government Response Stringency Index,” 2020).
Despite suffering the health and economic uncertainties that other countries witnessed early in their COVID19 pandemics, New Zealand’s stringent Alert Level 4 restrictions in March/April 2020 also occurred in a setting of
widespread government confidence (Sibley, Greaves, et al.,
2020). For example, each day of New Zealand’s COVID19 lockdown, New Zealand’s Ministry of Health, often with
New Zealand’s Prime Minister as spokes-person, reassured
the nation about the availability of essential supplies, provided transparent updates about COVID-19 case histories,
and described details of New Zealand’s pandemic health and
economic planning, with explicit clarity about areas of pandemic uncertainty, such as the duration of the lockdown. In
the second week of New Zealand’s Alert Level 4, the government launched a dedicated COVID-19 WhatsApp channel for case updates and health information and encouraged
residents to share their personal stories using the #BeKind
hashtag. That same week, the Ministry of Education announced the development of distance learning infrastructure
at all levels of public education in response to student learning and wellbeing needs during the lockdown. The initiative included the delivery of learning materials and digital devices to students, online resources for parents, professional development options for teachers, and the aim to
connect more New Zealand residences to the Internet. In

addition, initiatives for transitioning from Alert Level 4 to
Alert Level 3 were announced by Prime Minister Jacinda
Arden on Day 15 of COVID-19 lockdown, providing clarity
on how the transition to less restrictive economic and social
pandemic regimes would eventually occur. Additionally, although lockdown measures were strict, Google mobility data
for March 29th shows steeply declining mobility trends suggesting New Zealanders were compliant with the measures
(Google, 2020), an observation concurrent with poll results
from Horizon Research NZ indicating 95% of New Zealand
adults reported complying with lockdown measures between
April 7th and 12th (“HorizonPoll - Horizon Research NZ online poll,” 2020).
Though New Zealand resembled other countries in
its confrontation with stark economic and health uncertainties, pandemic lockdown occurred in a context of high institutional confidence, early government pandemic action, and
effective policy and science communication. These benefits were lacking in other countries. High public confidence
minimises potentially confounding distress caused from dissatisfaction with the government response, enabling greater
clarity about specific distress mechanisms during pandemic
lockdown.

Extended Method
Ethics
The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study was
approved by The University of Auckland Human Participants
Ethics Committee on 03-June-2015 until 03-June-2018, and
renewed on 05-September-2017 until 03-June-2021. Reference Number: 014889. Our previous ethics approval
statement for the 2009-2015 period is: The New Zealand
Attitudes and Values Study was approved by The University of Auckland Human Participants Ethics Committee on
09-September-2009 until 09-September-2012, and renewed
on 17-February-2012 until 09-September-2015. Reference
Number: 6171. All participants granted informed written
consent and The University of Auckland Human Participants
Ethics Committee approved all procedures.
Participants
Demographics
Age. The mean age of our sample was 50.7 (S D =
13.3) in 2018 and 51.9 (S D = 13.3) in 2020.
Male. Gender is assessed in the NZAVS by asking participants to respond using an open-ended question:
“What is your gender?” Those who responded as “Male”
were coded as “1” and “Not Male” were coded as “0.”
Deprivation. We measure the socioeconomic status of participants’ immediate (small area) neighborhood us-

ing the 2013 New Zealand Deprivation Index, which uses
aggregate census information about the residents of small
neighborhood-type units to assign a decile-rank index from 1
(least deprived) to 10 (most deprived) (Atkinson et al., 2014).
The index is based on a Principal Components Analysis of
the following nine variables (in weighted order): proportion of adults who received a means-tested benefit, household income, proportion not owning own home, proportion
single-parent families, proportion unemployed, proportion
lacking qualifications, proportion household crowding, proportion no telephone access, and proportion no car access.
Thus, the index reflects the average level of deprivation for
small neighborhood-type units (or small community areas of
approximately 80–90 people each) across the entire country.
Education. Education level was measured using
an 11-point rating developed by the New Zealand government known as the New Zealand Qualification Framework
(NZQF; 0 = no qualification, 10 = doctoral degree). Sample
demographic statistics are reported in TableD1.
European. Ethnicity was assessed using two basic categories: (1) New Zealand European/Pākehā coded as
“1” and (2) others coded as “0.”
Religious. To assess religiousness, we asked people: “Do you identify with a religion and/or spiritual group?”
(yes or no). We coded “yes” as “1” and “no” as “0.”
We report sample descriptive statistics for sample
demographic statistics in Table D1.

as well as the frequency of health states associated with psychological distress: rumination and feelings of exhaustion
(fatigue).
Fatigue. We measure participants’ subjective fatigue by asking, "During the last 30 days, how often did...you
feel exhausted?". Responses to this item were rated on an
ordinal scale ranging from none of the time (0) to all of the
time (4).
Rumination. We measure rumination using an
item adapted from Nolen-Hoeksema and Morrow (1993),
"During the last 30 days, how often did...you have negative
thoughts that repeated over and over?". Responses to this
item were rated on an ordinal scale ranging from none of the
time (0) to all of the time (4).
Satisfaction with Health. The link between
health satisfaction and psychological distress is firmly established (Cockerham et al., 1988; Han et al., 2015; G. Williams
et al., 2017). A recent study identified fear of COVID-19 as a
reliable predictor of positive behavioral change and compliance with public health measures (Harper et al., 2020). Another study noted that public perception of health risks plays
a key role in the adoption of mitigation measures (Motta
Zanin et al., 2020). We measure health satisfaction using
an item taken from the Australian Unity Wellbeing Index
(Cummins et al., 2017). Participants rated their satisfaction
with “Your health” on a 10-point Likert scale ranging from
completely dissatisfied (1) to completely satisfied (10).
Short-Form Health. We measure subjective
health using three items taken from the MOS 36-item shortform health survey (Ware Jr & Sherbourne, 1992):
1. "In general, would you say your health is...";
2. "I seem to get sick a little easier than most people";
3. "I expect my health to get worse."
Responses to these items were rated on a 7-point Likert scale
ranging from poor (1) to excellent (7) (reverse coded subscales 2, 3).
We report sample descriptive statistics for indicators of health in Table D2.
Economic Concerns
Future Security. We measure satisfaction with
future security using an item taken from the Australian Unity
Wellbeing Index (Cummins et al., 2017). Participants rated
their level of satisfaction with "Your future security" on a 10point Likert scale ranging from completely dissatisfied (1) to
completely satisfied (10).
Satisfaction with Business. Previous research
finds that economic concerns affect distress (McKee-Ryan
et al., 2005), which may play a role in COVID-19 distress
dynamics (Collie et al., 2020). We measure business satisfaction using an item taken from the National Wellbeing Index

2. "There is no one I can turn to for guidance in times of

3. "I know there are people I can turn to when I need
help."
Responses to this item were rated on a 7-point Likert scale
ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7) (reverse coded subscale 2).
Social Belonging. Previous research finds a
strong relationship between social belonging and distress
(Haslam et al., 2012; Holt-Lunstad et al., 2015). Belonging,
or the lack thereof, is a direct predictor of depression (Choenarom et al., 2005; Hagerty & Williams, 1999). We measure
social belonging using three items adapted from the Sense of
Belonging Instrument (Hagerty & Patusky, 1995):
1. “Know that people in my life accept and value me”;
2. “Feel like an outsider”;
3. “Know that people around me share my attitudes and
beliefs.”
Responses to this item were rated on a 7-point Likert scale
ranging from very inaccurate (1) to very accurate (7) (reverse
coded subscale 2). This indicator was centered and standardised.
Satisfaction with Personal Relationships. We
measure satisfaction with personal relationships using an
item taken from the Australian Unity Wellbeing Index (Cummins et al., 2017). Participants rated their satisfaction with
"Your personal relationships" on a 10-point Likert scale ranging from completely dissatisfied (1) to completely satisfied
(10).
We report sample descriptive statistics for indicators of personal relationships in Table D4.

Satisfaction with the Government. In New
Zealand, government confidence rose markedly during
COVID-19 lockdown and Sibley, Greaves, et al. (2020)
speculate that confidence in government helped to mitigate
COVID-19 related distress. Here, we assess government
confidence using an item adapted from the National Wellbeing Index (Tiliouine et al., 2006). Participants evaluated
“The performance of the current New Zealand Government”
on a 10-point Likert scale ranging from completely dissatisfied (1) to completely satisfied (10). This indicator was
centered and standardised.
Trust in Politicians. We measure trust in politicians by asking participants to rate their agreement with the
statement: "Politicians in New Zealand can generally be
trusted". Responses to this item were rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree
(7).
Engagement with Police. We measure engagement with police using two items taken from Tyler (2005).
1. "I would always report dangerous or suspicious activities occurring in my neighbourhood to the police";
2. "I would always provide information to the police to
help them find someone suspected of committing a
crime."
Responses to these items were rated on a 7-point Likert scale
ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7).
Trust in Police. We measure institutional trust in
police using three items taken from Tyler (2005).
1. "People’s basic rights are well protected by the New
Zealand Police";
2. "There are many things about the New Zealand Police
and its policies that need to be changed";
3. "The New Zealand Police care about the well-being of
everyone they deal with."
Responses to these items were rated on a 7-point Likert scale
ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7) (reverse coded subscale 2).
We report sample descriptive statistics for indicators of institutional trust in Table D5.
Civic Community
Satisfaction with Social Conditions. We measure satisfaction with social conditions in New Zealand using
an item taken from the National Wellbeing Index (Tiliouine
et al., 2006). Participants rated their level of satisfaction with
"The social conditions in New Zealand" on a 10-point Likert
scale ranging from completely dissatisfied (1) to completely
satisfied (10).

National Identity. We measure identification
with New Zealand using a single-item measure of social
identification taken from Postmes et al. (2013). Participants
evaluated "I identify with New Zealand" on a 7-point Likert
scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7).
Patriotism. We measure patriotism using two
items adapted from Kosterman and Feshbach (1989).
1. "I feel a great pride in the land that is our New
Zealand";
2. "Although at time I may not agree with the government, my commitment to New Zealand always remains strong."
Responses to these items were rated on a 7-point Likert scale
ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7).
Sense of Neighbourhood Community. We
postulate that community sensibilities may buffer mental
distress during mass crises (Sibley, Greaves, et al., 2020,
see also: Drury, 2012). We measure a sense of community
by asking participants to rate their agreement with the
statement: "I feel a sense of community with others in my
local neighbourhood." Responses to this item were rated
on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree
(1) to strongly agree (7). This indicator was centered and
standardised.

We measure psychological distress using the
Kessler-6 scale (Kessler et al., 2002), which exhibits strong
diagnostic concordance for moderate and severe psychological distress in large, cross-cultural samples (Kessler et al.,
2010; Prochaska et al., 2012). Participants rated during the
past 30 days, how often did... (a) “. . . you feel hopeless”;
(b) “. . . you feel so depressed that nothing could cheer you
up”; (c) “. . . you feel restless or fidgety”; (d)“. . . you feel that
everything was an effort”; (e) “. . . you feel worthless”; (f)
“. . . you feel nervous?” Ordinal response alternatives for the
Kessler-6 are: “None of the time”; “A little of the time”;
“Some of the time”; “Most of the time”; “All of the time.”
We report sample descriptive statistics for indicators of personal Kessler-6 distress in Table D7.

Missingness
99.6% of the dataset was complete. The columns
with the highest rates of missingness were willingness to engage the police (2.02% missing), trust in politicians (.96%
missing), identify with New Zealand (1.17%), satisfied with
the New Zealand economy (.8% missing), and satisfied with
business conditions in New Zelaand (.48%) missing. Though
rates of overall missingness were low, to avoid biasing estimates, we multiply imputed missing values using the Amelia
package in R(Honaker et al., 2011). We passed the individual
id column indicator to Amelia a the clustering indicator, and
other columns in the dataset were multiply imputed under
a missing at random (MAR) assumption (i.e. random conditional on the information contained within all variables in the
dataset).
Statistical models
We fit a series of Bayesian multilevel mediation
models using the bmlm package in RVuorre, 2017. Estimation of direct and mediation (or "indirect") effects in
a Bayesian setting is straightforward (Yuan & MacKinnon,
2009). We simultaneously fit an outcome model in which
K6 summed scores were regressed on the time interval
(pre/during lockdown, the direct effect) and the mediator, and

These priors were only weakly informative; we also used the
default bmlm priors for the three models in which mediation effects were detected. Minor differences were within the
region of MCMC error, with no difference to inferences in
this article. We infer that all the information in these models
came from the data with no influence from the priors.

σY ∼ HalfCauchy(0, 1)

In Bayesian estimation, the direct effect, ’c0 ’, is the
mean value of posterior samples from treatment on the outcome (X→Y), the mediator effect, ’b’, is the mean value of
posterior samples from the mediator on the outcome (X→Y);
the meditation effect (or the indirect effect) is the mean value
of the multiplication of the posterior samples from the mediator of the outcome model and the posterior samples from
treatment of the mediation model (a * b) plus the individual
level covariances of these slopes (σa j σb j ). Hence, the mediation effect (or indirect effect) is the product of the posterior
distributions for the slope of the direct effect (lockdown) on
the mediator, the ’a’ path (X→M), and the slope of the mediator effect on the outcome (psychological distress), the ’b’
path (M→Y), plus the covariance of σa j and σab , which are
the individual level variances of the a and b paths:
me = ab + σa j σb j

Appendix E
Sampling Procedure
The NZAVS is a national longitudinal panel study that has
been tracking social attitudes, personality, and health outcomes within individuals since 2009 (Ns = 6,441-47,951).
Here, we conduct a novel analysis of the rolling 2020 dataframe first used by Sibley, Greaves, et al. (2020). The longitudinal sample is composed of 940 participants who responded to both Wave 10 (2018) and Wave 11 (2020) of the
NZAVS, which were taken respectively before and during
the early stages of New Zealand’s first COVID-19 lockdown
in March/April 2020. The Time 10 (2018) NZAVS contained responses from 47,951 participants (18,010 retained
from one or more previous waves). The sample retained
2,964 participants from the Time 1 (2009) sample (a retention rate of 45.5%). The sample retained 14,049 participants
from Time 9 (2017; a retention rate of 82.3% from the previous year). Participants who provided an email address were
first emailed and invited to complete an online version if
they preferred. Participants who did not complete the online version (or did not provide an email) were then posted
a copy of the questionnaire, with a second postal follow-up
two months later. We staggered the time of contact, so that
participants who had completed the previous wave were contacted approximately one year after they last completed the
questionnaire. We offered a prize draw for participation (five
draws each for $1000 grocery vouchers, a prize pool total of
$5000). All participants were posted a Season’s Greetings
card from the NZAVS research team and informed that they
had been automatically entered into a bonus seasonal grocery
voucher prize draw. Participants were also emailed an eightpage newsletter about the study.
To boost sample size and increase sample diversity
for subsequent waves, a booster sample was conducted by selecting people from the New Zealand electoral roll. As with
previous booster samples, sampling was conducted without
replacement (i.e., people included in previous sample frames
were identified and removed from the 2018 roll). Booster
samples completed over the first decade of the study mean
that the NZAVS has been drawn from random electoral roll
samples, stratified electoral roll samples, and random electoral roll samples with upper age limits. Wave-on-wave retention has generally been high, usually upwards of 80%. As
such, all the participants analysed in this paper have completed at least one other survey, providing assurance that
there is nothing about the current sample in terms of sudden
opting-in during the pandemic or lockdown. A detailed description of the sampling procedure for the NZAVS is available in Sibley, Greaves, et al. (2020).
The NZAVS 2018 sample frame consisted of
325,000 people aged from 18-65 randomly selected from the
2018 New Zealand Electoral Roll, who were currently resid-

ing in New Zealand (one can be registered to vote in New
Zealand but living overseas). The electoral roll contained
3,250,000 registered voters. The New Zealand Electoral Roll
contains participants’ date of birth (within a one-year window), and we limited our frame to people who are 65 or
younger, due to our aim of retaining participants longitudinally. We concurrently advertised the survey on Facebook
via a $5000 paid promotion of a link to a YouTube video
describing the NZAVS and the large booster sample we were
conducting. The advertisement ran for 14 days and targeted
men and women aged 18-65+ who lived in New Zealand.
This paid promotion reached 147,296 people, with 4,721 link
clicks (i.e., clicking to watch the video), according to Facebook. The goal of the paid promotion was twofold: (a) to
increase name recognition of the NZAVS during the period
in which questionnaires were being posted, and (b) to help
improve retention by potentially reaching previous participants who happened to see the advertisement. A total of
29,293 participants who were contained in our sample frame
completed the questionnaire (response rate = 9.2% when adjusting for the 98.2% accuracy of the 2018 electoral roll).
A further 648 participants completed the questionnaire, but
were unable to be matched to our sample frame (for example,
due to a lack of contact information) or were unsolicited optins. Informal analysis indicates that unsolicited opt-ins were
often the partners of existing participants.
The longitudinal data used in the study were collected for a complementary analysis in Sibley, Greaves, et
al. (2020) to provide a within-person comparison for the
pre-registered propensity-score matched analysis. In Sibley, Greaves, et al. (2020) we report the results of paired
sample t-tests for the within-subjects comparisons and find
these largely match the separate propensity-score matched
analysis. Specifically, we observe: “Sense of community increased (p < .001, Cohen’s d = .17), as did mental distress
(p = .027, Cohen’s d = .06).” Apart from this paired sample t-test of average population-level distress before and during lockdown in our follow-up within-subjects analyses, we
do not conduct any further analysis of psychological distress
using the panel sample in Sibley, Greaves, et al. (2020).
Sample Comparison
To assess systematic biases in the online-only New
Zealand Attitudes and Values responses, we compared the
lockdown sample at baselines in 2018/19 with the full
2018/2019 sample baselines. These comparisons are reported in Tables E1, E2, E4, E5, and E6.
Compared with the full 2018 sample, in 2018
the lockdown sample was slightly older (M f ullsample:2018 =
48.5 (13.9), M(pre)lockdown:2018 = 50.7 (13.5), p < .001), more
educated (M f ullsample:2018 = 5.3 (2.7), M(pre)lockdown:2018 =
5.7 (2.6), p < .001), more European ( f ullsample:2018 =

88.5%, (pre)lockdown:2018 = 92.3%), had slightly worse health
as measured by the Short Form Health scale M f ullsample:2018 =
5.0 (1.2), M(pre)lockdown:2018 = 4.9 (1.2), p < .001), and were
slightly more trusting of the police M f ullsample:2018 = 4.4(1.2),
M(pre)lockdown:2018 = 4.5 (1.2), p < .001). In other respects the
lockdown panel sample at the pre-COVID-19 baseline was
not reliably different from the full 2018/19 NZAVS panel.

At the population-level average, the lockdown did not reduce
satisfaction with health; had it done so, psychological distress would have been worse.

Figure F2
At the population-level average, the lockdown did not reduce
short form health scores (i.e., subjective health); had it done
so, psychological distress would have been worse.

Figure F3
At the population-level average, the lockdown did not increase rumination; had it done so, psychological distress
would have been worse.

Figure F4
At the population-level average, the lockdown reduced fatigue; moreover, such fatigue reduction buffered people from
greater psychological distress.

Figure F5
At the population-level average, the lockdown did not reliably affect satisfaction with the economy, and satisfaction
with the economy did not reliably predict psychological distress.

NATIONAL LOCKDOWN DISTRESS MECHANISMS

Figure F6
At the population-level average, the lockdown did not reliably affect satisfaction with standard of living; had it done
so, psychological distress would have been worse.

Figure F7
At the population-level average, the lockdown did not reliably affect satisfaction with future security; had it done so,
psychological distress would have been worse. Individuallevel variation reveals elevated distress in a sub-population
who experienced loss of future security.

Figure F8
At the population-level average, the lockdown reliably decreased business satisfaction; however, business satisfaction
did not reliably predict psychological distress. Nevertheless,
there was substantial individual-level variability in the relationship between lockdown and business satisfaction.

Figure F9
At the population-level average, the lockdown did not reliably affect perceived social support; had it done so, psychological distress would have been worse.

Figure F10
At the population-level average, the lockdown did not reliably affect perceived social belonging; had it done so, psychological distress would have been worse.

Figure F11
At the population-level average, the lockdown reduced satisfaction with personal relationships; moreover, dissatisfaction with personal relationships resulting from lockdown
fully mediated observed psychological distress.

Figure F14
At the population-level average, the lockdown decreased
willingness to engage with the police; however, willingness
to engage with the police did not reliably predict psychological distress.

Figure F12
At the population-level average, the lockdown strongly increased satisfaction with the performance of government;
however, satisfaction with government did not reliably predict psychological distress.

Figure F15
At the population-level average, the lockdown increased trust
in the police; however, trust in the police did not reliably predict psychological distress.

Figure F13
At the population-level average, the lockdown increased trust
in politicians; however, trust in politicians did not reliably
predict psychological distress.

Figure F16
At the population-level average, the lockdown reliably increased satisfaction with social conditions; however, satisfaction with social conditions did not reliably predict psychological distress.

NATIONAL LOCKDOWN DISTRESS MECHANISMS

Figure F17
At the population-level average, the lockdown reliably increased feelings of national identity; however, national identity did not reliably predict distress.

Figure F18
At the population-level average, the lockdown substantially
increased patriotism; however, patriotism did not reliably
predict distress.

Figure F19
At the population-level average, the lockdown substantially
increased a sense of neighbourhood community; moreover, a
sense of neighbourhood community reliably buffered people
from greater psychological distress.
