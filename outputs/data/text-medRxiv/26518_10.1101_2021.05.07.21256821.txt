Summary
mRNA-based vaccines effectively induce protective neutralizing antibody responses
against SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. The specific compositional
patterns of these responses remain largely unknown. We found that SARS-CoV-2-naïve
individuals receiving the first dose of an mRNA vaccine developed a SARS-CoV-2specific antibody response with a subclass profile comparable to that induced by the
natural infection, except IgA2, which did not increase. SARS-CoV-2-naïve subjects also
mounted a robust virus-specific recall response after receiving the second dose. This
response increased all IgG subclasses, but boosted neither IgM nor IgA1 and IgA2
subclasses. In contrast, individuals recovered from COVID-19 mounted peak virusspecific antibody responses upon primary immunization and did not further augment
such responses following secondary immunization. Remarkably, compared to SARSCoV-2-naïve subjects, individuals with pre-existing immunity showed increased levels of
all virus-specific antibodies but IgG3 following primary vaccination. By dissecting the
heterogeneity of mRNA vaccine-induced humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2, our
findings indicate that the induction of optimal immune protection may require the
development of personalized vaccination programs.

Introduction
Vaccination against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
is the leading option to achieve protection against the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID19) pandemic1. SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines, such as the
“mRNA-1273” from Moderna or the “BNT162b2” from Pfizer-BioNTech have been
reported to be safe and highly effective in preventing severe COVID-19 disease in clinical
trials2,3. Hence, they have been recently approved for emergency use and are currently
being administrated to millions of individuals in numerous Western countries. BNT162b2
and mRNA-1273 vaccines encode for the full-length spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2,
which is essential for viral pathogenicity, and are applied in a two-dose immunization
regimen, administered 21 days or 28 days apart, respectively.
Earlier phase III trials and more recent studies have demonstrated that both mRNAbased vaccines induce a strong anti-S IgG humoral response and promote the
generation of S-specific memory T and B cells after the two-dose regimen2–8. Among the
different antibodies induced upon vaccination, the ones that specifically recognize the
receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral S protein are particularly relevant as they
mirror the neutralizing capacity of the sera9,10 and are considered a principal surrogate
of immune protection and vaccine efficacy.
Interestingly, recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals and
individuals with prior history of infection have distinct immune responses upon mRNA
vaccination. Following the first vaccine dose, COVID-19 recovered individuals show
significantly higher S- and RBD-specific IgG titers, superior serum neutralization
activity7,11–13, even against SARS-CoV-2 variants8,14,15, and increased S protein-specific
memory T and B cell responses than naïve individuals4–6,14. This enhanced response is
consistent with the persistence of humoral and cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in
convalescent individuals, as previously reported16–20. Because a recall immunization
does not seem to provide any quantitative benefit in subjects with pre-existing immunity
to SARS-CoV-26,7,13, it has been proposed that COVID-19 recovered people may only
require a single vaccine dose to achieve optimal immune protection6,7,13.
These studies have highlighted the importance of understanding the immunological
history of an individual to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
However, to date, the analysis of humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has
exclusively focused on measuring S protein-specific total IgG responses. The
contribution of virus-specific IgG subclasses and antibody classes different from IgG to
vaccine-induced humoral responses remains elusive.

In humans, IgG consists of IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 subclasses, which differ in terms
of structure, effector functions and serum half-life21. IgG1 and IgG3 are the most
abundant antibodies produced upon viral infection and are required for anti-viral
immunity. These IgG subclasses activate the complement cascade, mediate antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity, and stimulate phagocytic cells via powerful receptors
termed Fcγ receptor I (FcγRI) and FcγRIII. In contrast, IgG2 and IgG4 subclasses neither
activate complement nor signal through FcγRI and FcγRIII and are poorly induced upon
viral infection22.
Recent studies, including ours10,16,23, have shown that IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses are
indeed strongly induced soon after SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas IgG2 and IgG4
subclasses are induced to a much lesser extent. In recovered individuals, humoral and
B cell memory responses appeared to be IgG1-dominated16,19. SARS-CoV-2 infection
also induces virus-specific IgM, IgA1 and, to a lesser extent, IgA2, which all wane during
convalescence16.
How RBD-specific IgG and IgA subclasses are differentially induced upon administration
of mRNA vaccines in SARS-CoV-2 naïve and recovered individuals is unknown. The
characterization of vaccine-induced RBD-specific antibody profiles with subclass
resolution may enhance our knowledge of humoral correlates of protection.
Here we characterized serum RBD-specific antibody classes and subclasses, including
IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgM, IgA1 and IgA2 in a longitudinal cohort of SARS-CoV-2
naïve and COVID-19 recovered individuals who received and mRNA-based vaccine. Our
analysis revealed striking differences in the quantity and quality of antibody responses
to the vaccine based on the prior history of infection. Our findings may offer new insights
into the development of personalized vaccine strategies for the induction of optimal
immune protection.

Results
For this study, we recruited 48 healthy individuals who received SARS-CoV-2 mRNA
vaccines (Moderna mRNA-1273 or Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2) at Parc Salut Mar
(Barcelona, Spain). Of this cohort, 20 individuals had previous SARS-CoV-2 infection
(mean age = 41; 75% female) and 28 were SARS-CoV-2 naïve (mean age = 37, 68%
female) (Fig. 1A). Sera were collected at three time points: pre-vaccine baseline (B), 2/3
weeks post the first dose (PFD), and one month post the second dose (PSD) (Fig. 1B).
To elucidate whether SARS-CoV-2 naïve and recovered individuals can mount
comparable humoral responses to mRNA vaccines, we used a previously described23,24
two-step enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that determines antibody
responses to the RBD of the S protein from SARS-CoV-2. To quantitate antibodies, we
performed serial dilutions of the serum samples and used the optical density (OD) values
to determine the area under the curve (AUC).
First, we evaluated the induction of RBD-specific IgG subclasses upon mRNA
vaccination in SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals and individuals with prior history of SARSCoV-2 infection. The administration of the first dose of the mRNA vaccine in naïve
individuals induced a significant increase of all RBD-specific IgG subclasses, which
further increased following the second dose. As expected, the highest increase was
observed for RBD-specific IgG1 and to a lesser extent, RBD-specific IgG3, whereas
RBD-specific IgG2 and IgG4 showed much lower increases (Fig. 1C). In subjects with
pre-existing immunity, we also observed a significant increase of all RBD-specific IgG
subclasses after the first dose of the mRNA vaccine; however, in these individuals the
booster dose did not induce a further increase of any IgG subclasses (Fig. 1D).
We then compared the levels of anti-RBD IgG1, IgG3, IgG2 and IgG4 at baseline, after
the first dose, and one month after the second dose between SARS-CoV-2 naïve and
recovered individuals (Fig. 1 E). At baseline, study participants with prior history of
infection showed significantly higher levels of RBD-specific IgG1 compared to SARSCoV-2 naïve individuals. In contrast, no significant differences were observed between
these two groups with respect to other IgG subclasses. After the first dose of an mRNA
vaccine, RBD-specific IgG1, IgG2 and IgG4 titers in recovered individuals were
significantly higher than in vaccinees with no pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, after primary immunization, the amount of RBD-specific IgG3 was similar
in SARS-CoV-2 naïve and COVID-19 recovered individuals. Following the second dose
of the vaccine, the concentrations of RBD-specific IgG1 and IgG4 were similar between
the two groups of vaccinees, whereas RBD-specific IgG2 levels were still more elevated

in recovered individuals compared to SARS-CoV-2 naïve subjects. Remarkably, one
month after the reboost, individuals with no prior history of SARS-CoV-2 infection
showed slightly more RBD-specific IgG3 compared to recovered individuals (Fig. 1E).
Of note, we did not observe any relationship between sex and RBD-specific IgG
subclasses at baseline, after the first immunization and after the recall immunization (Fig.
S1A).
Recent studies reported that mRNA vaccination induced S-specific IgA and IgM along
with S-specific IgG in fully vaccinated individuals12. Moreover, circulating plasmablasts
producing IgA anti-S were detected one week after the second dose of mRNA vaccine25.
Yet, how S-specific IgM as well as IgA1 and IgA2 subclasses are differentially
induced upon vaccination in SARS-CoV-2 naïve and COVID-19 recovered individuals
remains unclear. Our analysis revealed that RBD-specific IgM increased after primary
vaccination, but it did not further augment upon reboost in both groups of vaccinees (Fig.
2A, B). We further evaluated the level of RBD-specific IgA1 and IgA2 subclasses. While
IgA1 induction occurs in both mucosal and systemic compartments, IgA2 production is
largely confined to the intestinal compartment26. Similarly to RBD-specific IgM, RBDspecific IgA1 was induced upon the first dose of vaccine in SARS-CoV-2 naïve and
recovered individuals, but its serum concentration no longer augmented one month
following the second dose (Fig. 2A, B). RBD-specific IgA2 titers were below the
threshold at baseline and after the first and second dose of mRNA vaccine in SARSCoV-2 naïve individuals (Fig. 2A), whereas a small but significant induction was
observed in individuals with pre-existing immunity after primary but not secondary
vaccination (Fig. 2B). When we compared the levels of RBD-specific IgM, IgA1 and IgA2
in SARS-CoV-2 naïve and recovered individuals, we observed no significant differences
at baseline, being most of AUC values below the threshold. However, after the first and
second dose, individuals with prior history of SARS-CoV-2 infection showed significantly
higher levels of RBD-specific IgM, IgA1 and IgA2 compared to SARS-CoV-2 naïve
individuals (Fig. 2C). Again, no association was observed between sex and RBD-specific
IgM or IgA subclasses at any time points (Fig. S1B).

Discussion
Here, we showed that mRNA vaccination induced distinct profiles of subclass-specific
antibody responses in SARS-CoV-2 naïve compared to COVID-19 recovered
individuals. Our findings highlight both the complexity and heterogeneity of antibody
responses to mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 in individuals with a different
exposure history.
Prior to vaccination, only RBD-specific IgG1 was significantly higher in COVID-19
recovered individuals compared to SARS-CoV-2 naïve subjects, which is consistent with
the predominance of virus-specific IgG1 and memory B cell responses observed in
COVID-19 convalescent individuals16,19. Following primary immunization, individuals with
pre-existing immunity showed increased titers of all RBD-specific antibodies, except
IgG3, when compared to SARS-CoV-2 naïve subjects. This was consistent with the
presence of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-specific class-switched and unswitched memory
B cells in COVID-19 recovered subjects16,17,19,20. In line with our results, a recent report
showed a strong correlation between the frequency of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B
cells at baseline and post-vaccination antibody levels6. Moreover, the lack of superior
RBD-specific IgG3 responses in COVID-19 recovered individuals is in agreement with
earlier findings indicating that very few SARS-CoV-2 memory B cells express IgG3 in
COVID-19 convalescent individuals19.
Our analysis clearly shows that primary vaccination of SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals
induces a broad spectrum of virus-reactive antibodies responses, which include RBDspecific IgM, IgA1 as well as IgG1, IgG3 and, to a lesser extent, IgG2 and IgG4. Keeping
in mind the largely mucosal nature of IgA223,26, it was not surprising to detect virtually no
RBD-specific IgA2 induction in individuals with no prior history of infection. Thus, except
for the lack of IgA2 induction, the general pattern of subclass-specific antibody responses
induced by primary immunization with mRNA vaccines of SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals
was comparable to that seen after natural infection16. The small but significant induction
of RBD-specific IgA2 in recovered individuals upon the first dose of mRNA vaccine
echoes earlier studies that describe IgA2-expressing memory B cells targeting the S
protein of SARS-CoV-2 in a subset of COVID-19 recovered patients27,28. Remarkably,
we previously detected RBD-dominant IgA2 responses mostly in COVID-19 patients
experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms23. Future studies should evaluate whether there
is a relationship between COVID-19 disease-related symptoms and SARS-CoV-2specific antibody profiles after vaccination in recovered subjects.

Remarkably, differences in vaccine-induced antibody responses among SARS-CoV-2
naïve subjects and COVID-19 recovered individuals were also observed after recall
immunization. In contrast to individuals with prior history of infection, SARS-CoV-2 naïve
subjects showed a vigorous boosting of RBD-specific IgG responses upon the second
dose of mRNA vaccination, which involved all IgG subclasses. Interestingly, after the
second injection, RBD-specific IgG2 titers in SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals were still
significantly lower compared to those of recovered subjects, whereas IgG3 titers were
significantly higher. The increased levels of RBD-specific IgG3 in SARS-CoV-2 naïve
individuals could be due to the induction of increased number of IgG3 expressing
memory B cells after primary vaccination or differences in the kinetics of humoral
responses. Contrarily, no reboost effect was observed for RBD-specific IgM and IgA
subclasses in both vaccinee groups, and the titers of these antibodies were consistently
lower in fully vaccinated naïve subjects compared to recovered individuals. The lack of
increased antibody response following recall vaccination in individuals with pre-existing
immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is intriguing and could relate to the reduced antigen availability
resulting from the elevated vaccine-specific IgG responses triggered by the primary
immunization. However, it could also be due to differences in the kinetics of germinal
center or extra follicular B cell responses to viral antigens as well as differences in the
antigen-presenting cell priming. Such differences may influence the generation of
secretory memory, including the generation of long-lived plasma cells in the bone
marrow. Further studies are required to address these questions. In summary, our
findings highlight the heterogeneity of mRNA vaccine-induced humoral responses to
SARS-CoV-2. They also indicate that prior viral exposure may be the major determinant
of this heterogeneity. Finally, they suggest that the induction of optimal immune
protection may require the development of personalized vaccination programs.

Limitations of the study
This study has the following limitations. First, the size of the studied cohort was small
(n=48) and it only included SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals who had experienced
mild COVID-19 symptoms. Hence, our results should be confirmed in future larger-scale
studies encompassing COVID-19 recovered individuals with more severe disease. In
addition, all the participants of our study were below 65 years of age (mean = 39). Older
SARS-CoV-2 naïve and COVID-19recovered individuals should be studied in the future
to fully address the vaccine efficacy in this specific population. Finally, to fully investigate
the protection offered by mRNA vaccines overtime, additional serologic measurements
should be performed at later time points.

Experimental Model and Subject Details
Study Cohort
48 healthy individuals provided written consent and were enrolled in the study. All
procedures followed were approved by the Ethical Committee for Clinical Investigation
of the Institut Hospital del Mar d’Investigacions Mèdiques (Number 2020/9621/I).
Subjects were stratified in two groups: SARS-CoV-2 naïve (n = 20) and SARS-CoV-2
recovered (n = 28), based on self reported or laboratory evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2
infection. Of the self-reported naïve subjects, one individual was found to have positive
SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein-specific antibodies at baseline and was retroactively
classified as SARS-CoV-2 recovered. All participants classified as SARS-CoV-2
recovered had mild COVID-19 course and symptoms during infection. Mean age were
38 ([24-64]) years old for SARS-CoV-2 naïve group and 41 ([22-62]) years old for SARSCoV-2 recovered group. From all the participants, 29% were male and 71% were female.
Detailed information of groups and patients were summarized in Fig. 1. All study
participants received either Moderna (mRNA-1273, n = 46) or Pfizer (BNT162b2, n = 2)
mRNA vaccine at Parc Salut Mar (Barcelona, Spain). Blood samples were collected at 3
time points: pre-vaccine baseline (B), 2/3 weeks post first vaccine dose (PFD) and 4
weeks post-second vaccine dose (PSD).
Production of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins
The pCAGGS RBD construct, encoding for the receptor-binding domain of the SARSCoV-2 Spike protein (amino acids 319-541 of the Spike protein) along with the signal
peptide plus a hexahistidine tag was provided by Dr Krammer (Mount Sinai School of
Medicine, NY USA). RBD proteins were expressed in-house in Expi293F human cells
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) by transfection of the cells with purified DNA and
polyethylenimine (PEI). Cells were harvested 3 days post transfection and RBDcontaining supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 13000rpm for 15min. RBD
proteins were purified in Hitrap-ni Columns in an automated Fast Protein Liquid
Chromatography (FPLC; Äkta avant), concentrated through 10 kDa Amicon centrifugal
filter units (EMD Millipore) and resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS).
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

Sera were collected from whole blood in silica-treated tubes where the blood was
incubated for 30 min without movement to trigger coagulation. Next, samples were
centrifuged for 10 min at 1300 g at room temperature (RT), heat-inactivated at 56ºC for
1 hour and stored at -20ºC prior to use. ELISAs performed in this study were adapted
from previously established protocols23,24. 96-well half-area flat bottom high-bind
microplates (Corning) were coated overnight at 4ºC with SARS-CoV-2 RBD recombinant
viral protein at 2 µg/ml in PBS (30 µl per well). Plates were washed with PBS 0.05%
Tween 20 (PBS-T) and blocked with blocking buffer (PBS containing 1.5% Bovine serum
albumin, BSA) for 2 hours at RT. Serum samples were serially diluted in PBS
supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% BSA and added to the viral protein- or PBScoated plates for 2 hours at RT. After washing, plates were incubated with horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-human Ig secondary antibodies diluted in PBS
containing 0.05% Tween 20 1% BSA for 45 min at RT. Plates were washed 5 times with
PBS-T and developed with TMB substrate reagent set (BD bioscience) with development
reaction stopped with 1M H2SO4. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm on a microplate
reader (Infinite 200 PRO, Tecan). To detect RBD-specific IgM, HRP-conjugated antihuman IgM (Southern Biotech) were used at a 1:4000 dilution. To analyze RBD-specific
IgG antibody subclasses, HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4
(Southern Biotech) were used at a 1:3000 dilutions. To detect SARS-CoV-2-specific
IgA1 and IgA2, HRP-conjugated anti-human IgA1 or IgA2 (Southern Biotech) were used
at a dilution of 1:2000 and 1:4000, respectively. To quantitate the level of each viral
antigen-specific antibody class or subclasses optical density (OD) values were
measured and the area under the curve (AUC) derived from optical density
measurements of four serial dilutions was determined using Prism 8 (GraphPad).
Negative threshold values were set for each immunoglobulin using naïve baseline AUC
levels plus 2 times the standard deviations of the mean. Values below the background
levels were replaced by the OD value of the blank.
Data analysis and visualization
GraphPad Prism (version 8.0) was used to conduct statistical analyses. For each
experiment, the type of statistical test, summary statistics and levels of significance were
specified in the figures and corresponding legends. All tests were performed two-sided
with a nominal significance threshold of p < 0.05. For comparisons between time points,
paired tests were used.

Figure legends
Fig. 1. mRNA vaccination induces different pattern of RBD-specific IgG subclass
responses in SARS-CoV-2 naïve and recovered individuals. (A) Schematic diagram
of the cohort characteristics. (B) Schematic diagram of the study timeline. Sera were
collected at 3 time points: pre-vaccine baseline (B), 2/3 weeks following first dose (PFD)
and 1 month following the second dose (PSD). Range of days per time point is indicated
with a box. (C) Area under the curve (AUC) for each of the RBD-specific IgG subclasses
analyzed from SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals overtime. (D) AUC for each of the RBDspecific IgG subclasses analyzed from SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals overtime. (E)
AUC for each of the RBD-specific IgG subclasses analyzed from SARS-CoV-2 naïve
and recovered individuals overtime depicted in the same graph. Sera from SARS-CoV2 naïve individuals at baseline were used to establish negative threshold values defined
as the naïve AUC mean plus 2 times the standard deviation of the mean. Dashed line
indicates negative threshold. Data are presented as individual dots. Two-tailed MannWhitney U test was performed to compare time points. Wilcoxon matched pairs test was
performed to compare SARS-CoV-2 naïve and recovered individuals (*P < 0.05, **P <
0.01, and ***P < 0.001). SARS-CoV-2 Naïve, n=28; SARS CoV-2 recovered, n=20.
