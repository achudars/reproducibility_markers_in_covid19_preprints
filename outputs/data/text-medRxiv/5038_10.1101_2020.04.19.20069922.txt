Summary:

Time is of the essence in evaluating potential drugs and biologics for the treatment and prevention of

COVID-19. There are currently over 400 clinical trials (phase 2 and 3) of treatments for COVID-19 registered on
clinicaltrials.gov. Covariate adjustment is a statistical analysis method with potential to improve precision and reduce
the required sample size for a substantial number of these trials. Though covariate adjustment is recommended by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, it is underutilized, especially for the
types of outcomes (binary, ordinal and time-to-event) that are common in COVID-19 trials. To demonstrate the
potential value added by covariate adjustment in this context, we simulated two-arm, randomized trials comparing a
hypothetical COVID-19 treatment versus standard of care, where the primary outcome is binary, ordinal, or time-toevent. Our simulated distributions are derived from two sources: longitudinal data on over 500 patients hospitalized
at Weill Cornell Medicine New York Presbyterian Hospital, and a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
preliminary description of 2449 cases. We found substantial precision gains from using covariate adjustment–equivalent
to 9-21% reductions in the required sample size to achieve a desired power–for a variety of estimands (targets of
inference) when the trial sample size was at least 200. We provide an R package and practical recommendations for
implementing covariate adjustment. The estimators that we consider are robust to model misspecification.

Improving Precision for COVID-19 Treatment Trials

1. Introduction
This paper builds on our report (Benkeser et al., 2020) written in response to a request
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for statistical analysis recommendations
for COVID-19 treatment trials. We aim to help inform the choice of estimand (i.e., target
of inference) and analysis method to be used in future and ongoing COVID-19 treatment
trials. To this end, we describe treatment e↵ect estimands whose interpretability does not
rely on correct specification of models and that may be of particular interest in COVID-19
treatment trials involving binary, ordinal, or time-to-event outcomes. For binary outcomes,
we consider the risk di↵erence, relative risk, and odds ratio. For ordinal outcomes, we consider
the di↵erence in means, the Mann-Whitney (rank–based) estimand, and the average of the
cumulative log odds ratios over levels of the outcome. For time-to-event outcomes, we consider the di↵erence in restricted mean survival times, the di↵erence in survival probabilities,
and the ratio of survival probabilities. For each estimand, we present covariate adjusted
estimators of these quantities that leverage information in baseline variables to improve
precision and reduce the required sample size to achieve a desired power. In the case of
ordinal outcomes, we propose novel covariate adjusted estimators.
To evaluate the performance of covariate adjusted estimators, we simulated two-arm,
randomized trials comparing a hypothetical COVID-19 treatment versus standard of care,
where the primary outcome is binary, ordinal, or time-to-event. Our simulated distributions
are derived from two sources: longitudinal data on over 500 patients hospitalized at Weill
Cornell Medicine New York Presbyterian Hospital prior to March 28, 2020, and a preliminary
description of 2449 cases reported to the CDC from February 12 to March 16, 2020. We
focused on hospitalized, COVID-19 positive patients and considered the following outcomes:
intensive care unit (ICU) admission, intubation with ventilation, and death. We conducted
simulations using all three estimands when the outcome is ordinal, but only evaluated the

risk di↵erence when the outcome is binary and the restricted mean survival time and risk
di↵erence when the outcome is time-to-event.
In our simulations of trials with at least 200 participants, the precision gains due to
covariate adjustment were often substantial, equivalent to requiring 9-21% fewer participants
to achieve the same power as a trial that uses an unadjusted estimator. In our simulated
trials with 100 participants, covariate adjustment still o↵ered improvements in precision,
equivalent to requiring 4-18% fewer participants to achieve the same power as a trial that
uses an unadjusted estimator. From these simulations, we conclude that covariate adjustment
is a low-risk, high-reward approach to streamlining COVID-19 treatment trials.
After our aforementioned report (which contains the simulation results described above for
ordinal and time-to-event outcomes), the FDA released a guidance for industry on COVID-19
treatment and prevention trials (FDA, 2020). The guidance contains the following statement,
which is similar to our key recommendation regarding covariate adjustment: “To improve
the precision of treatment e↵ect estimation and inference, sponsors should consider adjusting
for prespecified prognostic baseline covariates (e.g., age, baseline severity, comorbidities) in
the primary efficacy analysis and should propose methods of covariate adjustment.”
There is already an extensive literature on the statistical theory and practice of covariate
adjustment (e.g., Zhang et al. (2008); Jiang et al. (2019); Austin et al. (2010). However,
covariate adjustment is underutilized, particularly for trials with a binary, ordinal, or timeto-event outcome. Since many COVID-19 treatment trials focus on exactly these types of
outcomes, our goal with this work is to demonstrate, using real data, the potential benefits
of covariate adjustment in these contexts.
The remainder is organized as follows. A background on covariate adjustment in randomized trials is provided in Section 2. Section 3 describes estimands and estimation strategies
when the outcome is binary, ordinal, or a time-to-event. Section 4 describes the methods

underlying the simulation study and Section 5 presents the simulation study results. Section 6
presents our recommendations for the estimands and primary efficacy analysis methods for
future COVID-19 treatment trials. A brief discussion is given in Section 7.

2. Background on Covariate Adjustment in Randomized Trials
The ICH E9 Guidance on Statistical Methods for Analyzing Clinical Trials (FDA and
EMA, 1998) states that “Pretrial deliberations should identify those covariates and factors
expected to have an important influence on the primary variable(s), and should consider
how to account for these in the analysis to improve precision and to compensate for any lack
of balance between treatment groups.” The term “covariates” refers to baseline variables.
Adjusting for pre-specified, prognostic baseline variables (i.e., variables that are correlated
with the outcome) is called covariate adjustment.
Though there appears to be a general agreement among regulators (EMA, 2015; FDA,
2019) that when the outcome is continuous, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) may be used
to appropriately adjust for baseline variables, there is a dearth of specific guidance for ordinal
and time-to-event, which are of keen interest in COVID-19 treatment trials. Moreover, even
for binary outcomes, for which one possible adjustment method (Ge et al., 2011) was cited
in the recent FDA guidance (FDA, 2020), there has not been any study showing how much
precision gain is to be expected by using covariate adjusted, rather than unadjusted, methods
in the context of COVID-19 treatment trials. In this work, we evaluate the performance of
covariate adjusted estimators (hence, simply adjusted estimators) for binary, ordinal, and
time-to-event outcomes.
To understand the idea, imagine repeating a trial many times with consideration of age as a
key prognostic baseline variable. Due to chance, some trials will have more older participants
assigned to treatment than control, and some will have more younger participants assigned
to treatment than control. While the distribution of unadjusted estimates over these many

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.19.20069922; this version posted June 11, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

trials will be centered at the true e↵ect, it will be a mixture of under- and over- estimates.
The variability of the estimates can be ascribed to the variability of the outcome within each
age group as well as the variability in the balance of age between treatment and control.
To understand this latter point, consider a setting where older adults are at higher risk for
a negative outcome. In this situation, the trials where more older participants are assigned
to the treatment, the treatment will tend to look worse than in trials where more younger
participants were assigned to the treatment. Unadjusted estimates ignore the important
information about imbalances with respect to age leading to greater variability. Adjusted
estimates seek to minimize this source of variability in the estimation procedure thereby
improving their efficiency relative to the unadjusted estimator (Jiang et al., 2019).
To make these ideas more precise, consider a randomized trial involving a single, binaryvalued baseline variable (e.g., age over 85), two study arms (e.g., drug A vs. B), a binary
outcome (e.g., death by 30 days after hospitalization), and the estimand being the risk
di↵erence (probability of death under assignment to treatment minus probability of death
under assignment to control). The unadjusted estimator of the risk di↵erence is the di↵erence
between arms in the sample proportion of patients who die. The adjusted estimator of the
risk di↵erence is constructed by first computing, separately for those > 85 and 6 85, the
di↵erence between arms in the sample proportions of patients who die; next, these stratumspecific treatment e↵ect estimates are combined into an average treatment e↵ect estimate
by taking their weighted sum with weights set to the study-wide (pooling across arms)
proportions of those > 85 and 6 85. Provided the sample size is large enough, the adjusted
estimator will have greater precision compared to the unadjusted estimator if age > 85
is correlated with death (which is likely for COVID-19 positive patients). In general, the
adjusted estimator can be interpreted as correcting for empirical confounding by baseline
variables (Moore et al., 2011).

To clarify how the adjusted estimator gains information compared to the unadjusted
estimator, consider the same setup as the previous paragraph except where the goal is even
simpler: to estimate the probability of death under assignment to the treatment arm. The
unadjusted estimator is the sample proportion of dead patients in the treatment arm. It can
be equivalently represented as the weighted sum of stratum-specific sample proportions of
dead patients with weights set to the proportions of those > 85 and 6 85 in the treatment
arm. The adjusted estimator is the weighted sum of stratum-specific sample proportions of
dead patients in the treatment arm with weights set to the study-wide (pooling across arms)
proportions of those > 85 and 6 85. The only di↵erence between the estimators is in the
italicized text; the adjusted estimator uses a more precise estimate of the proportions in each
stratum, which propagates into a more precise estimate of the probability of death under
assignment to the treatment arm. A similar mechanism underlies the precision gains due
to covariate adjustment when estimating the risk di↵erence and the other estimands in this
paper.

3. Estimands and Analysis Methods
Throughout, we assume that treatment is randomly assigned independently of baseline
covariates. The described methods can be adapted to handle the case where treatment
assignment depends on (a subset of) the measured baseline covariates, as is the case when
stratified randomization is used. All estimands are intention-to-treat (ITT) in that they
are contrasts between outcome distributions under assignment to treatment and under
assignment to control. We let A denote study arm assignment, taking on the value 0 for
control group and 1 for treatment group. We let Y denote the outcome of interest and X
denote a vector of baseline covariates.

3.1 Binary Outcomes
We consider three estimands, though our simulation studies only involve the first. All probabilities below are marginal (as opposed to conditional on baseline variables). The outcome
is coded as “good” (1) or “bad” (0).
Estimand 1: Risk Di↵erence. Di↵erence between probability of bad outcome comparing
treatment to control arms.
Estimand 2: Relative Risk. Ratio of probability of bad outcome comparing treatment
to control arms.
Estimand 3: Odds Ratio. Ratio of odds of bad outcome, comparing treatment to control
arms.
Estimators of each estimand 1–3 above can be constructed from estimators of the probability of a bad outcome for each study arm; e.g., the risk di↵erence can be estimated by the
di↵erence between the arm-specific estimators. The unadjusted estimator of the probability
of a bad outcome under assignment to each study arm a is just the sample proportion of
bad outcomes among patients assigned to arm A = a. A covariate adjusted estimator of this
quantity can be based on the standardization approach of Ge et al. (2011), as indicated in the
FDA COVID-19 guidance (FDA, 2020). This estimator is identical to that of Moore and van
der Laan (2009) and for the risk di↵erence it is a special case of estimators from Scharfstein
et al. (1999). First, a logistic regression model is fit for the probability of bad outcome given
study arm and baseline variables. Next, for each participant (from both arms), a predicted
probability of bad outcome is obtained under each possible arm assignment a 2 {0, 1} by
plugging in the participant’s baseline variables and setting arm assignment A = 0 and A = 1,
respectively, in the logistic regression model fit. Lastly, the covariate adjusted estimator of
the bad outcome probability in arm a 2 {0, 1} is the sample mean over all participants
(pooling across arms) of the predicted outcome setting A = a.

3.2 Ordinal Outcomes
We consider three estimands when the outcome is ordinal, with levels 1, . . . , K. Without
loss of generality, we assume that higher values of the ordinal outcome are preferable.
We comment on these estimands briefly here, and refer the reader to Appendix A of the
Supplementary Material for analytic expressions for these quantities.
Estimand 1: Di↵erence in means of a prespecified transformation of the ordinal
outcome (DIM). In most settings, this transformation will be monotone increasing so that
larger values of the ordinal outcome will result in larger, and therefore preferable, transformed
outcomes. Transformations could incorporate, e.g., utilities assigned to each level, as has been
done in some stroke trials (Chaisinanunkul et al., 2015; Nogueira et al., 2018).
Estimand 2: Mann-Whitney (MW) estimand. This estimand reports the probability
that a random individual assigned to treatment will have a better outcome than a random
individual assigned to control, with ties broken at random.
Estimand 3: Log-odds ratio (LOR). We consider a nonparametric extension of the logodds ratio (LOR) (Dı́az et al., 2016) defined as the average of the cumulative log odds ratios
over levels 1 to K

1 of the outcome. In the case that the distribution of the outcome

given study arm is accurately described by a proportional odds model of the outcome
against treatment (McCullagh, 1980), this estimand is equal to the coefficient associated
with treatment.
As is shown in Appendix A of the Supplementary Material, all of the above estimands can
be written as smooth summaries of the treatment-specific cumulative distribution functions
(CDFs) of the ordinal outcome. To estimate these quantities, it suffices to estimate these
two CDFs and then to evaluate the summaries. This results in so-called plug-in estimators.
The unadjusted estimator of the CDF in each arm is the empirical distribution in that arm.
The resulting plug-in estimator for the DIM corresponds precisely to taking the di↵erence of

sample means of the transformed outcomes between the two arms. Also, the resulting plug-in
estimator (denoted M ) for the MW estimand is closely related to the usual Mann-Whitney
U-statistic U = n0 n1 M , where n0 and n1 are the total sample sizes in the two study arms.
The covariate adjusted estimator of the CDF in each arm leverages prognostic information
in baseline variables. It uses working models, i.e., models that are fit in the process of
computing the estimator but which we do not assume to be correctly specified (and for which
consistency and asymptotic normality still hold under arbitrary model misspecification).
Specifically, the adjusted estimator of the CDF for each study arm is based on an armspecific, proportional odds working model for the cumulative probability of the outcome
given the baseline variables. This working model posits that, conditioned on arm A = a
and a linear combination of the baseline variables, the odds of Y 6 j is proportional to the
odds of Y 6 j + 1, where the proportionality constant depends on j but not on the baseline
variables. Formally, the model for arm A = a is logit {P (Y 6 j|A = a, X)} = ↵j +
each j = 1, . . . , K

X, for

and ; the model for the other study

arm is the same but with a separate set of parameters. Each model is fit using data from the
corresponding study arm, yielding two working covariate-conditional CDFs (one per arm).
For each arm, the estimated marginal CDF is then obtained by averaging the corresponding
conditional CDF across the empirical distribution of baseline covariates pooled across the
two study arms. This is analogous to standardizing arm-specific mean outcomes based on
pooling baseline variables across arms as explained in the last paragraph of Section 2. The
above methods are implemented in an accompanying R package, drord, available on GitHub
at https://github.com/benkeser/drord.
The validity (i.e., consistency and asymptotic normality) of the adjusted CDF estimator
given above in no way relies on correct specification of the aforementioned working model.
The fact that our adjusted CDF estimator is robust to misspecification of the outcome

working model is reminiscent of the fact that ANCOVA can be robustly used for covariate
adjustment when the estimand is the di↵erence in means between arms (Yang and Tsiatis,
2001; Tsiatis et al., 2008). Other model-robust, covariate adjusted estimators are available
for estimation of the MW estimand, e.g., Vermeulen et al. (2015), and for the LOR estimand,
e.g., Dı́az et al. (2016).
3.3 Time-to-Event Outcomes
We consider three treatment e↵ect estimands in the time-to-event setting, all of which are
interpretable under violations of a proportional hazards assumption. We refer the reader to
Appendix B of the Supplementary Material for analytic expressions for these quantities.
Estimand 1: Di↵erence in restricted mean survival times (RMSTs). The RMST is
the expected value of a survival time that is truncated at a specified time (Chen and Tsiatis,
2001; Royston and Parmar, 2011). Equivalently, the RMST can be expressed as the area
under the survival curve up to the truncation time.
Estimand 2: Survival probability di↵erence (also called risk di↵erence, RD).
Di↵erence between arm-specific probabilities of survival to a specified time.
Estimand 3: Relative risk (RR). Ratio of the arm-specific probabilities of survival to
a specified time.
Analogous to the ordinal outcome case, estimators of these parameters can be constructed
from estimators of the survival function at each time point. One approach to constructing
adjusted estimators, used here, involves discretizing time and then: (i) estimating the timespecific hazard conditional on baseline variables, (ii) transforming to survival probabilities
using the product-limit formula, and (iii) marginalizing using the estimated covariate distribution (pooled across arms). The adjusted approach as implemented here (and elsewhere–see
references below) has two key benefits relative to unadjusted alternatives such as using the
unadjusted Kaplan-Meier estimator (Kaplan and Meier, 1958). First, in large samples and

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.19.20069922; this version posted June 11, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

under regularity conditions, the adjusted estimator is at least as precise as the unadjusted
estimator. Second, the adjusted estimator’s consistency depends on an assumption of censoring being independent of the outcome given study arm and baseline covariates, rather than
an assumption of censoring in each arm being independent of the outcome marginally; see
Appendix B of the Supplementary Material for details. The former may be a more plausible
assumption.
We implemented the covariate adjusted estimator of the RMST (specifically, the targeted
minimum loss-based estimator of the RMST) from Dı́az et al. (2019), which is implemented in
the R package survtmlerct available on GitHub at https://github.com/idiazst/survtmlerct.
Time was discretized as the day level. Similar covariate adjusted estimators for the RD and
RR are also available (Moore and van der Laan, 2009; Benkeser et al., 2018, 2019). Both
Dı́az et al. (2019) and Benkeser et al. (2018) provide approaches that can be used to develop
Wald-type confidence intervals and corresponding tests of the null hypothesis of no treatment
e↵ect.
Some examples of other covariate adjusted estimators for time-to-event outcomes include
Stitelman et al. (2011); Brooks et al. (2013); Lu and Tsiatis (2011); Zhang (2014) and Parast
et al. (2014). Dı́az et al. (2019) compare the properties of these estimators.

4. Simulation Methods
4.1 Sample sizes and number of simulated trials
In each setting, we simulated trials with 1:1 randomization to the two arms and total
enrollment of n = 100, 200, 500, and 1000. In each case, 1000 trials were simulated.

4.2 Data-Generating Distributions
4.2.1 Binary outcomes. The data generating distributions are the same as for ordinal
outcomes (below), except that we dichotomized the outcome into “bad” (ICU admission or
death) and “good” (neither ICU admission nor death).
4.2.2 Ordinal outcomes.

We generated data based on (CDC COVID-19 Response Team,

2020), which reported outcomes for hospitalized and non-hospitalized individuals with COVID19. We focus on hospitalized patients and place additional results pertaining to the nonhospitalized population in Appendix C of the Supplementary Material. There were three
levels of the ordinal outcome, with level 1 representing death, level 2 representing survival
with ICU admission, and level 3 representing survival without ICU admission. The following
patient age categories define the single baseline variable (which is used for adjustment):
0–19, 20–44, 45–54, 55–64, 65–74, 75–84, and >85. Lower and upper estimates were given
for probabilities of outcomes in each age group in (CDC COVID-19 Response Team, 2020);
we used the mean of these within each age group to define our data generating distributions.
For the hospitalized COVID-19 positive population, the resulting outcome probabilities for
each age group are listed in Table 1.
[Table 1 about here.]
We separately considered two types of treatment e↵ects in our data generating distributions: no treatment e↵ect and an e↵ective treatment. For the former, we randomly sampled n
age–outcome pairs according to the distribution in Table 1 and then independently assigned
study arm with probability 1/2 for each arm.
For the latter case (e↵ective treatment), we randomly generated control arm participants
as in the previous paragraph. We randomly generated treatment arm participants using a
modified version of Table 1 where the probabilities P(ICU admission and survived | age) in
column 4 were proportionally reduced; then each corresponding probability in column 5, i.e.,

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.19.20069922; this version posted June 11, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

12

P(No ICU admission and survived | age), was increased by an equal amount. The probabilities
of death given age in column 3 were not changed. This modified table corresponds to the
treatment having no e↵ect on the probability of death but decreasing the odds of ICU
admission among those who survive by the same relative amount in each age category. This
relative reduction (and the resulting treatment e↵ect) was separately selected for each sample
size n = 100, 200, 500, 1000.
In our simulations, we used the adjusted estimator described in Section 3.2, where age is
coded using the categories in Table 1. Specifically, these age categories are included as the
main terms in the linear parts of the proportional odds working models.
For simplicity, for binary and ordinal outcomes we simulated trials with no censoring.
However, the methods we used can adjust for dropout (right censoring) as described in
Appendix A of the Supplementary Material.

4.2.3 Time-to-event outcomes. In order to mimic key predictive features of clinical outcomes in COVID patients, our simulation data generating mechanism is based on the over
500 patients hospitalized at Weill Cornell Medicine New York Presbyterian Hospital prior to
March 28, 2020. The event of interest in this simulation is time from hospitalization to the
first of intubation or death, and the predictive variables used are sex, age, whether the patient
required supplemental oxygen at ED presentation, dyspnea, hypertension, and the presence
of bilateral infiltrates on the chest x-ray. We focus on the RMST 14 days after hospitalization,
and the RD of remaining intubation-free and alive 7 days after hospitalization.
Patient data was re-sampled with replacement to generate 1000 datasets of each of the
sizes n = 100, 200, 500, and 1000. For each dataset, a hypothetical treatment variable was
drawn from a Bernoulli distribution with probability 0.5 independently of all other variables.
A positive treatment e↵ect was simulated by adding an independent random draw from a

distribution with 4 degrees of freedom to each participant’s outcome in the treatment

arm. This corresponds to a di↵erence in RMST of 1.06 at 14 days, and an RD of 8.7% at
seven days. Five percent of the patients were selected at random to be censored, and their
censoring time was drawn from a uniform distribution on {1, . . . , 14}.
We compare the performance of the unadjusted, Kaplan-Meier-based estimator to the
covariate adjusted estimator defined in Sections 4 and 6 of (Dı́az et al., 2019), respectively,
and implemented in the R package survtmlerct. Wald-type confidence intervals and corresponding tests of the null hypothesis of no e↵ect are reported.

4.3 Performance Criteria
We compare the type I error and power of tests of the null hypothesis H0 of no treatment
e↵ect based on unadjusted and adjusted estimators, both within and across estimands. For
each estimand, we also compare the bias, variance, and mean squared error of the unadjusted
and the adjusted estimators. We report the relative efficiency of the unadjusted relative to
the adjusted estimator (ratio of variance of adjusted estimator to variance of unadjusted
estimator). One minus this relative efficiency is approximately the proportion reduction in
sample size needed for a covariate adjusted estimator to achieve the same power as the
unadjusted estimator, asymptotically (van der Vaart, 1998, pp. 110–111).

5. Simulation Results
For binary and ordinal outcomes, we present results that use the nonparametric BCa bootstrap (Efron and Tibshirani, 1994) for confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. We used 1000
replicates for each BCa bootstrap confidence interval. While we recommend 10,000 replicates
in practice, the associated computational time was too demanding for our simulation study.
Nonetheless, we expect similar or slightly better performance with an increased number of
bootstrap samples. Results that use closed-form, Wald-based inference methods are presented
in Appendix C of the Supplementary Material.

For time-to-event outcomes, we used Wald-based confidence intervals since these made the
computations faster compared to the BCa bootstrap method. For all outcome types and
estimands, the relative efficiency of the unadjusted estimator to the adjusted estimator is
approximated by the ratio of the mean squared error of the latter to the mean squared error
of the former.

5.1 Binary Outcomes
Table 2 compares the performance of the unadjusted and adjusted estimators when the
outcome is ICU admission or death, and the estimand is the risk di↵erence. Type I error
of the covariate adjusted method was comparable to that of the unadjusted method. The
covariate adjusted method achieved higher power across all settings. Absolute gains in power
varied from 5% to 12%.
The relative efficiency of unadjusted method relative to the adjusted method varied from
0.90 to 0.84. This is roughly equivalent to needing 10-16% smaller sample size when using
the adjusted estimator compared to the unadjusted estimator, to achieve the same power.
[Table 2 about here.]

5.2 Ordinal outcomes
Tables 3, 4, and 5 display results for the di↵erence in means (DIM), Mann-Whitney (MW),
and log odds ratio (LOR) estimands, respectively. Type I error control of the covariate
adjusted methods was comparable to that of the unadjusted methods. The covariate adjusted
methods achieved higher power across all settings. Absolute gains in power varied from 3%
to 8% for the DIM, 1% to 6% for the MW estimand, and 3% to 6% for the LOR.
The relative efficiency of the unadjusted methods relative to adjusted methods varied
from 0.89 to 0.82 for the DIM, 0.91 to 0.82 for the MW estimand, and 0.88 to 0.82 for
the LOR. This is roughly equivalent to needing 11-18% (DIM), 9-18% (MW), and 12-18%

(LOR) smaller sample sizes, respectively, when using the adjusted estimator compared to
the unadjusted estimator, to achieve the same power.
[Table 3 about here.]
[Table 4 about here.]
[Table 5 about here.]

5.3 Time-to-event outcomes
Table 6 displays the results for RMST estimators, where the baseline variables adjusted for
include age and sex along with the four other variables described in Section 4.2.3. Type I
error control of the covariate adjusted method was comparable to that of the unadjusted
method. The covariate adjusted methods achieved higher power across all settings, with
absolute gains varying from 3% to 8%. The value added by covariate adjustment in terms of
relative efficiency increased monotonically as a function of sample size, from approximately
0.95 (roughly equivalent to needing 5% smaller sample size) when n = 100 to approximately
0.79 (roughly equivalent to needing 21% smaller sample size) when n = 1000 for the case
of no treatment e↵ect; the results were similar for the positive treatment e↵ect case, except
with slightly smaller precision gains.
To evaluate the importance of adjusting for multiple baseline variables, we also evaluated an adjusted RMST estimator that only adjusts for age and sex in Appendix C of
the Supplementary Material. The gains of the covariate adjusted methods relative to the
unadjusted methods were more modest, with absolute gains in power of approximately 0%–
1% and relative efficiency ranging from 0.96 to 1.00. These results suggest that there can be
a meaningful benefit from adjusting for prognostic covariates beyond just age and sex.
We also considered the risk di↵erence (RD) estimand in Appendix C of the Supplementary
Material. The results (when adjusting for age and sex along with the four other variables

described in Section 4.2.3) are qualitatively similar, except with slightly smaller precision
gains, to those for the RMST in Table 6.
[Table 6 about here.]

6. Recommendations for Target of Inference and Primary Efficacy Analysis
(1) Estimand when the outcome is ordinal. If a utility function can be agreed upon to
transform the outcome to a score with a clinically meaningful scale, then we recommend
using the di↵erence between the transformed means in the treatment and control arms.
Otherwise, we recommend using the unweighted di↵erence between means or the MannWhitney estimand. We recommend against estimating log odds ratios, since these are
difficult to interpret and the corresponding estimators (even unadjusted ones) can be
unstable at small sample sizes; this instability occurrred in additional simulation studies
that we describe in Appendix C of the Supplementary Material.
(2) Covariate adjustment. Adjust for prognostic baseline variables to improve precision
and power. We expect improvements to be substantial since there are already several
known prognostic baseline variables, e.g., age and co-morbidities. The baseline variables
should be specified before the trial is started (or should be selected using only blinded
data from the trial using a prespecified algorithm). The number of variables adjusted
for should be no more than (roughly) the total sample size divided by 20, as a rule of
thumb to avoid model overfit.
(3) Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. We recommend that the nonparametric bootstrap (BCa method) be used with 10000 replicates for constructing a confidence
interval. The entire estimation procedure, including any model fitting, should be repeated
in each replicate data set. Hypothesis tests can be conducted either by inverting the
confidence interval or by permutation methods — the latter can be especially useful in

smaller sample size trials in order to achieve the desired Type I error rate. Vermeulen
et al. (2015) present such a permutation-based test for the MW estimand based on a
di↵erent covariate adjusted estimator than presented here.

(4) Early stopping for efficacy or futility. Rules for early stopping such as O’BrienFleming boundaries can be directly applied, where z-statistics are constructed using the
covariate adjusted estimator described above and the covariance between statistics at
di↵erent analysis times is estimated using nonparametric bootstrap as described above.
The timing of analyses (including the final analysis) can be based on the information
accrued defined as the reciprocal of the adjusted estimator’s variance. In this way,
precision gains from covariate adjustment translate into faster information accrual and
shorter trial duration, even in trials with no treatment e↵ect.

(5) Plotting the CDF and the probability mass function (PMF) when the outcome is ordinal. Regardless of which treatment e↵ect definition is used in the primary
efficacy analysis, we recommend that the covariate adjusted estimate of the PMF and/or
CDF of the primary outcome be plotted for each study arm when the outcome is ordinal.
Pointwise and simultaneous confidence intervals should be displayed (where the latter
account for multiple comparisons). This is analogous to plotting Kaplan-Meier curves
for time-to-event outcomes, which can help in interpreting the trial results. For example,
Figure 1 shows covariate adjusted estimates of the CDF and PMF for a data set from
our simulation study. From the plots, it is evident that the e↵ect of the treatment on
the ordinal outcome is primarily through preventing ICU admission, with no impact on
probability of death.

(6) Missing covariates. We recommend handling missing covariates by imputing them
based only on data from those covariates that were observed. Importantly, to ensure

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.19.20069922; this version posted June 11, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

18

that treatment assignment is randomized conditionally on the imputed covariates, no
treatment or outcome information should be used in this imputation.
(7) Missing ordinal outcomes. We recommend handling missing ordinal outcomes using
doubly robust methods whose validity relies on the outcomes being missing at random
conditional on the covariates and study arm assignment. One such doubly robust approach can be evaluated by applying the methods described in Appendix A.2 of the
Supplementary Material.
(8) Loss to follow up with time-to-event outcomes. We recommend accounting for
loss-to-follow-up using doubly robust methods such as those described in Benkeser et al.
(2018); Dı́az et al. (2019). These methods rely on a potentially more plausible condition
on the censoring distribution than do unadjusted methods. The covariate adjusted
estimator for the restricted mean survival time in the time-to-event setting is double
robust under censoring being independent of the outcome given baseline variables and
arm assignment.

7. Discussion
Alleviating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will likely require the development
of e↵ective interventions for treatments, as well as a preventive vaccine. In both cases,
there is a pressing need to bring products to market as quickly as possible without
sacrificing the validity of the analysis of trials used to evaluate therapeutics. Covariate
adjustment represents a straightforward means of significantly improving the conduct
of these trials, by more efficiently using data that are already routinely collected in the
course of randomized trials. This in turn will allow e↵ective treatments to be discovered
with greater power and also end trials of ine↵ective treatments sooner, so that resources
can be appropriately reallocated.

als.gov, there are currently 190 with target sample size above 200 (the sample size above
which substantial precision gains were consistently observed in our simulation studies).
Covariate adjustment may add value in these and future trials. Whether covariate
adjustment is useful depends on how prognostic the baseline variables are for the primary
outcome. Based on the moderate to strong correlations that drove the precision gains
in our simulation studies, we expect that many COVID-19 trials will gain precision by
adjusting for baseline variables.
Adjusting for baseline variables beyond just age and sex led to substantial improvements
in precision in our simulations involving time-to-event outcomes. Specifically, for the simulated time-to-event intubation or death outcome among hospitalized patients at Weill
Cornell Medicine, we saw meaningful gains from additionally adjusting for hypertension,
dyspnea, whether the patient required supplemental oxygen at ED presentation, and the
presence of bilateral infiltrates on the chest x-ray. For the other outcome types, i.e.,
binary and ordinal, our data generating distributions only had one baseline variable,
age; this is all that was available in the CDC data, so we were not able to investigate
the value added by adjusting for more variables.
Vermeulen et al. (2015) derived an adjusted estimator that is directly targeted at maximizing precision for the MW estimand. In contrast, our adjusted estimators for ordinal
outcomes target the entire treatment-specific CDFs. It is an open research question to
compare our methods to those of Vermeulen et al. (2015).

Summary:

The Web Supplement is organized as follows. Appendix A introduces the estimands and estimators for

ordinal outcomes. Appendix B introduces the estimands and assumptions on censoring that we make for time-to-event
outcomes. Appendix C presents additional simulation studies, including for non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Appendix C.1 presents the data-generating distributions for non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Appendix C.2
presents the results of simulation studies for the case that the outcome is binary. Appendix C.3 presents additional
simulation results for ordinal outcomes, namely the results for Wald-style inference and for the non-hospitalized
population. Appendix C.4 presents additional simulation results for time-to-event outcomes, namely when a restricted
set of covariates (age and sex) were used for adjustment and for the di↵erence of survival probabilities in the

All three estimands are smooth summaries of the cumulative distribution functions Fa (·) :=
P (Y 6 · |A = a) for a 2 {0, 1}. To see that this is the case, let fa (j) := Fa (j)

Fa (j

A.2 Covariate adjusted estimator
Consider a setting in which we observe n independent copies of (X, A, Y ), where X represents
a d-dimensional vector of baseline covariates, A represents treatment, and Y represents
outcome. We assume that A ?
? X. We use the subscript i to denote data specific to individual
i. We now derive an estimator for the CDF that is closely related to an estimator presented
in Scharfstein et al. (1999) and to targeted minimum loss-based estimators (van der Laan
and Rubin, 2006; van der Laan and Rose, 2011).

We will consider the treatment-stratified proportional odds working model for P {Y 6 j|A =

and (↵1 ,

such that P {Y 6 j|A = a, X = x} =

m↵a , a (j, x) for all j, x, a. Importantly, we do not rely on this model being correct.
In addition to the above working model, we consider a treatment-assignment propensity
score working model. It is used to define inverse-probability weights that are used when
fitting the aforementioned proportional odds working models. Let ⇡ˆ (a|x) be an estimate of
P (A = a|X = x), e.g., using a logistic regression model. In the clinical trial setting that
we considered in our simulation studies, we used a logistic regression model with just an
intercept, i.e., we ignored baseline variables. This is equivalent to using no weights (i.e.,
all weights equal to a constant) when fitting the proportional odds models. At the end of
this subsection, we describe alternative approaches for estimating P (A = a|X = x) and the
implications of doing so.
Suppose that, for a 2 {0, 1}, ↵
ˆ (a) and ˆ(a) are chosen to minimize the following weighted
empirical risk in (↵, ):

Each of these a-specific optimizations can be solved by running a weighted logistic regression on a repeated measures dataset of size n ⇥ (K

1). Alternatively, they can be fit

using software for a proportional odds model that allows for weights. For both levels of the
treatment a, it can be shown that ↵
ˆ (a)1 6 ↵
ˆ (a)2 6 . . . 6 ↵
ˆ (a)K 1 , and so, for any covariate

Our covariate adjusted estimate of the CDF

ˆ
Because m↵(a),
ˆ(a) (·, Xi ) is monotone nondecreasing for all i = 1, . . . , n, a (·) is also monotone
ˆ
nondecreasing. The above estimator also satisfies the known constraint that ˆa (j) 2 [0, 1].
It can also be shown that ˆa (j) is (i) doubly robust and (ii) efficient if both the treatment
mechanism (P (A = a|X)) working model and the stratified proportional odds working model
are correctly specified. To show this, we now establish that ˆa (j) is in fact an augmented
inverse probability weighted estimator. First, note that minimizing (1) to find ↵
ˆ a and ˆa
implies that the following first-order condition is satisfied for all j 2 {1, . . . , K

m↵ˆ a , ˆa (j, Xi ) = 0.

Next, note that adding this to the right-hand side of (2) shows that

ˆa (j) = 1
I{Yi 6 j}
ˆ (Ai |Xi )
n i=1 ⇡

The above shows that ˆa (j) is an augmented inverse probability weighted estimator (see
Section 7 of Robins et al., 1994) for ˆa (j), with the estimate of the outcome regression
x 7! P {Y 6 j|A = a, X = x} given by x 7! m↵(a),
ˆ(a) (j, x).
ˆ
We next discuss our estimation of the treatment probability P (A = a|X = x). Though this
quantity can always be estimated by the empirical treatment probability in our randomized
trial setting, there are generally advantages to estimating this quantity within a richer model.
For example, a logistic regression of treatment on covariates (main e↵ects only) could be used
— in a randomized trial setting, this model is correctly specified provided that it includes
an intercept term. The advantage of estimating known treatment probabilities via correctly
specified parametric models has been discussed elsewhere – see, for example, Williamson
et al. (2014) or, for a general treatment, Section 2.3.7 in van der Laan et al. (2003).

We recommend handling missing ordinal outcomes using doubly robust methods whose
validity relies on the outcomes being missing at random conditional on the covariates and
treatment assignment. To implement this approach, one can apply the methods described
above, but with study arm recoded as 0 to indicate that a patient was both randomized to
study arm 0 (control) and had their outcome measured, 1 to indicate that a patient was both
randomized to study arm 1 (treatment) and had their outcome measured, and -1 to indicate
that the outcome is missing. When study arm is recoded in this way and the outcome is
not missing completely at random but is missing at random conditional on covariates, it is
important that the model used for ⇡
ˆ described above conditions on the baseline covariates,
since this recoded treatment is not fully randomized.

B. Estimands and censoring assumptions for time-to-event outcomes
Let T be a time-to-event outcome, C be a right-censoring time, A be a treatment indicator,
and X be a collection of baseline covariates. Let ⌧ be an investigator-specified truncation
time that will be used to define the RMST, and let t⇤ be an investigator-specified time at
which a comparison between the arm-specific survival probabilities is of interest.
The three estimands are defined as
RMST: E[min{T, ⌧ }|A = 1]
RD: P (T 6 t⇤ |A = 1)
RR:

E[min{T, ⌧ }|A = 0],
P (T 6 t⇤ |A = 0) ,

P (T 6 t⇤ |A = 1)
.
P (T 6 t⇤ |A = 0)

Unadjusted methods assume that

which may be more plausible than (3).

C. Additional simulation studies
C.1 Data generating distributions for non-hospitalized, COVID-19 patients
We also conducted simulations to mimic a population of non-hospitalized individuals who test
positive for COVID-19 and where the primary outcome is ordinal (1=death, 2=hospitalized
and survived, 3=not hospitalized and survived) and the baseline covariate is age category. We
set the control arm probabilities of being in each age group and of hospitalization and death
as in Table 1, which was extracted from CDC COVID-19 Response Team (2020) analogous
to how this was done in Section 4.2.2 for the hospitalized population; the treatment arm
distribution was constructed similarly as in Section 4.2.2.
Analogous to the hospitalized population data generating distributions, we assumed that
a treatment would have no e↵ect on the probability of death but would decrease the odds of
hospital admission (hospitalization) by the same relative amount in each age category. For
ordinal outcome scenarios with smaller sample sizes, there were sometimes data sets that
had no participants in the lowest or highest outcome category in at least one study arm.
For these data sets, the log-odds ratio estimators are undefined. As such, we omitted these
sample sizes from our evaluations.
[Table 1 about here.]
C.2 Additional simulation studies for binary outcomes
We repeated the simulation studies in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients for ordinal
outcomes, but collapsing the death and ICU admission outcomes (hospitalized setting) and
the death and hospitalized outcomes (non-hospitalized setting) to make a binary composite
outcome. The binary outcome in the non-hospitalized population is defined as death or
hospitalization (Y = 0) or survived and no hospitalization (Y = 1). The binary outcome for

the hospitalized population is as defined in Section 4.2.1 of the main paper. We compared
covariate-adjusted vs. unadjusted estimates of the risk di↵erence of the binary outcome
in terms of mean squared error, bias, and variance. We also compared the probability of
rejecting the null hypothesis of 0 risk di↵erence using a test based on our covariate-adjusted
estimator versus a traditional Chi-squared test. Results are shown in Tables 2-4. When
considering the same population and estimand, the only di↵erence between tables that use
BCa nonparametric bootstrap-based inference versus tables that use Wald-style inference is
in the P(Reject H0 ) column.
[Table 2 about here.]
[Table 3 about here.]
[Table 4 about here.]

C.3 Additional simulation studies for ordinal outcomes
We first present simulation results when using Wald-style inference for the population of
hospitalized patients, in Tables 5-7 for the three ordinal estimands. Results were largely
similar to those that used BCa nonparametric bootstrap-based inference as presented in the
main text.
[Table 5 about here.]
[Table 6 about here.]
[Table 7 about here.]
We also noted considerable numerical instabilities in implementations of the proportional
odds model included in the MASS package (function polr), which led to our using the more
stable implementation in the ordinal package (function clm) throughout. The latter function
is the default in the drord package.

C.4 Additional simulation studies for time-to-event outcomes
We present results for the di↵erence in restricted mean survival times (RMST) at 14 days
estimand in the hospitalized population, when the adjusted estimator uses only age and sex
(Table 14). Results are also presented for the di↵erence of survival probabilities (RD) at
7 days estimand in the hospitalized population (when the adjusted estimator uses all six
baseline variables from Section 4.2.3) in Table 15.

D. Code availability
D.1 Simulation code
All code needed to reproduce the simulations for ordinal and binary data is available on
GitHub (https://github.com/mrosenblum/COVID-19-RCT-STAT-TOOLS). The code for the
survival simulations is also included in that repository. However, because the simulation is
based on private data from Weill Cornell Medicine, the results of the simulation reported

in the manuscript are not reproducible based on the available code. We provide a simulated
dataset (not based on real data) with the same structure of the real dataset. This dataset
can be used to run the simulation code.

D.2 R packages
The drord package (available at https://github.com/benkeser/drord) implements the
proposed estimators for ordinal outcomes and can also be used for analyzing binary outcomes.
The package vignette (https://benkeser.github.io/drord/articles/using_drord.html)
describes implementation of the estimators and all available options in the package. In
particular, the package includes: bootstrap-based and closed-form inference for all estimands
described here-in, as well as for the treatment-specific PMFs and CDFs; a fully nonparametric
covariate-adjusted estimator that uses stratification to estimate the covariate-conditional
PMF and estimators; and a plotting method for visualizing covariate-adjusted estimates
of the treatment-specific PMFs and CDFs that includes pointwise confidence intervals and
simultaneous confidence bands.
The survtmlerct package, available at https://github.com/idiazst/survtmlerct, implements the targeted minimum loss based estimator for the RMST of Dı́az et al. (2019).
The package also implements an analogous estimator for the risk di↵erence RD, as well as
unadjusted counterparts for both the RMST and the RD. Standard errors are computed using
the influence function of the estimators, and Wald-type confidence intervals are implemented.
The functions in the package can incorporate any user-provided, preliminary estimates of
the outcome and hazard functions, including parametric and data-adaptive estimates that
use model selection. The help command applied to the specific functions of the package gives
examples of the estimators.

Table 5
Results for the ordinal outcome and di↵erence in means (DIM) estimand in the hospitalized
population. Wald-style inference is used for confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. “E↵ect” denotes the true
estimand value; “MSE” denotes mean squared error; “Rel. E↵.” denotes relative efficiency which we approximate as
the ratio of the MSE of the estimator under consideration to the MSE of the unadjusted estimator. In each block of
four rows, the first two rows involve no treatment e↵ect and the last two rows involve a benefit from treatment.

Table 12
Results for the ordinal outcome and log-odds ratio (LOR) estimand in the non-hospitalized population.
BCa bootstrap is used for confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. “E↵ect” denotes the true estimand value;
“MSE” denotes mean squared error; “Rel. E↵.” denotes relative efficiency which we approximate as the ratio of the
MSE of the estimator under consideration to the MSE of the unadjusted estimator. In each block of four rows, the
first two rows involve no treatment e↵ect and the last two rows involve a benefit from treatment.
