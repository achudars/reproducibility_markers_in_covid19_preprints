ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE
To study the neurological manifestations of patients with coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19).
DESIGN
Retrospective case series
SETTING
Three designated COVID-19 care hospitals of the Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China.
PARTICIPANTS
Two hundred fourteen hospitalized patients with laboratory confirmed diagnosis of
severe acute respiratory syndrome from coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Data
were collected from 16 January 2020 to 19 February 2020.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records and reviewed by a
trained team of physicians. Neurological symptoms fall into three categories: central
nervous system (CNS) symptoms or diseases (headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness, ataxia, acute cerebrovascular disease, and epilepsy), peripheral nervous
system (PNS) symptoms (hypogeusia, hyposmia, hypopsia, and neuralgia), and skeletal muscular symptoms. Data of all neurological symptoms were checked by two
trained neurologists.
RESULTS
Of 214 patients studied, 88 (41.1%) were severe and 126 (58.9%) were non-severe
patients. Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were older (58.7 ± 15.0
years vs 48.9 ± 14.7 years), had more underlying disorders (42 [47.7%] vs 41

[32.5%]), especially hypertension (32 [36.4%] vs 19 [15.1%]), and showed less typical symptoms such as fever (40 [45.5%] vs 92 [73%]) and cough (30 [34.1%] vs 77
[61.1%]). Seventy-eight (36.4%) patients had neurologic manifestations. More severe
patients were likely to have neurologic symptoms (40 [45.5%] vs 38 [30.2%]), such
as acute cerebrovascular diseases (5 [5.7%] vs 1 [0.8%]), impaired consciousness (13
[14.8%] vs 3 [2.4%]) and skeletal muscle injury (17 [19.3%] vs 6 [4.8%]).
CONCLUSION
Compared with non-severe patients with COVID-19, severe patients commonly had
neurologic symptoms manifested as acute cerebrovascular diseases, consciousness
impairment and skeletal muscle symptoms.

Introduction
In December 2019, many unexplained pneumonia cases occurred in Wuhan, China,
and has rapidly spread to other parts of China, then to Europe, North America and
Asia. This outbreak was confirmed to be caused by a novel coronavirus (2019 novel
coronavirus, 2019-nCoV) [1]. 2019-nCov was reported to have symptoms resembled
that of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 [2]. Both
shared the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [3]. Therefore,
this virus was named SARS-CoV-2, and recently WHO named it coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19). Until February 21th 2020, there were 75569 confirmed cases of
COVID-19 and 2239 deaths in China [4].
Coronaviruses can cause multiple systemic infections or injuries in various animals
[5]. However, some of them can adapt fast and cross the species barrier, such as in the
cases of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV), causing epidemics or pandemics. Infection in human often leads to severe clinical symptoms and high mortality [6]. As for COVID-19, several studies have described clinical
manifestations including respiratory symptoms, myalgia and fatigue. COVID-19 also
has characteristic laboratory findings and lung CT abnormalities [7]. However, it has
not been reported that patients with COVID-19 had any neurological manifestations.
Here, we would like to report the characteristic neurological manifestation of SARSCoV-2 infection in 78 of 214 patients with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of
COVID-19 and treated at our hospitals, which are located in the epicenter of Wuhan.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
This was a retrospective study. Data was reviewed on all patients with COVID-19
from January 16 to February 19, 2020 at three designated COVID-19 care hospitals of

Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. All patients with
COVID-19 enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to the WHO interim
guideline [8]. Only those cases confirmed by a positive result to real-time reversetranscriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay from throat swab specimens
were included in the analysis [9]. Union Hospital, located in the endemic areas of
COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, is one of the major tertiary healthcare system
and teaching hospitals responsible for the treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection as
designated by the government. The study was performed in accordance to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. Verbal consent was obtained from patients before the enrollment.
Data Collection
The demographic characteristics, medical history, symptoms, clinical signs, laboratory findings, chest computed tomographic (CT) scan findings were extracted from
electronic medical records. The data were reviewed by a trained team of physicians.
Neurological symptoms were categorized into three main areas: central nervous system (CNS) symptoms or disease, peripheral nervous system (PNS) symptoms and
muscular symptoms. Acute cerebrovascular disease included ischemic stroke and cerebral hemorrhage diagnosed by head CT. Muscle injury was defined when a patient
had myalgia and elevated serum creatine kinase level above 200 U/L [7]. All neurological symptoms were reviewed and confirmed by two trained neurologists. The date
of disease onset was defined as the day when the symptom was noticed. The severity
of COVID-19 was defined by the international guidelines for community-acquired
pneumonia [10].

Throat swab samples were collected and placed into a collection tube containing
preservation solution for the virus [9]. SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by real-time RTPCR assay using a SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Shanghai bio-germ Medical Technology Co Ltd).
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables were described as means and standard deviations, or medians
and interquartile range (IQR) values. Categorical variables were expressed as counts
and percentages. Continuous variables were compared by using the unpaired Wilcox
rank-sum test. Proportions for categorical variables were compared using the χ2 test.
All statistical analyses were performed using R (version 3.3.0) software. The significance threshold was set at a P<0.05.
Results
Demographic and clinical characteristics
A total of 214 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the present analysis. Their demographic and clinical characteristics were
shown in Table 1. Their average age was 52.7 ± 15.5 years, and 127 (59.3%) were females. Of these patients, 83 (38.8%) had at least one of the following underlying disorders: hypertension (51 [23.8%]), diabetes (30 [14.0%]), cardiovascular disease (15
[7.0%]), and malignancy (13 [6.1%]). The most common symptoms at onset of illness
were fever (132 [61.7%]), dry cough (107 [50.0%]) and anorexia (68 [31.8%]). Seventy-eight (36.4%) patients had nervons system symptoms: CNS (53 [24.8%]), PNS
(19 [8.9%]) and skeletal muscles (23 [10.7%]). In patients with CNS symptoms, the
most common complaints were dizziness (36 [16.8%] and headache (28 [13.1%]). In
patients with PNS symptoms, the most common complaints were hypogeusia (12
[5.6%]) and hyposmia (11 [5.1%]).

According to the diagnostic criteria, 88 (41.1%) patients were severe and 126
(58.9%) patients were non-severe, respectively. The patients with severe infection
were significantly older (58.2 ± 15.0 years vs 48.9 ± 14.7 years; P<0.001) and more
likely to have other underlying disorders (42 [47.7%] vs 41 [32.5%], P<0.05), especially hypertension (32 [36.4%] vs 19 [15.1%], P<0.001), and had less typical symptoms such as fever (40 [45.5%] vs 92 [73%], P<0.001) and dry cough (30 [34.1%] vs
77 [61.1%], P<0.001). Moreover, nervous system symptoms were significantly more
common in severe cases as compared with non-severe cases (40 [45.5%] vs. 38
[30.2%], P<0.05). They included acute cerebrovascular disease (5 [5.7%] (4 patients
with ischemic stroke and 1 with cerebral hemorrhage who died later from respiratory
failure) vs. 1 [0.8%] (1 patient with ischemic stroke), P<0.05), impaired consciousness (13 [14.8%] vs. 3 [2.4%], P<0.001) and muscle injury (17 [19.3%] vs. 6 [4.8%],
P<0.001).
Laboratory findings in severe patients and non-severe patients
Table 2 showed the laboratory findings in severe and non-severe subgroups. Severe
patients had more increased inflammatory response, including higher white blood
cell, neutrophil counts, lower lymphocyte counts and more increased C-reaction protein levels compared with those in non-severe patients (white blood cell: median, 5.4
[IQR, 0.1-20.4] vs 4.5 [IQR, 1.8-14.0], P<0.01; neutrophil: median, 3.8 [IQR, 0.018.7] vs 2.6 [IQR, 0.7-11.8], P<0.001; lymphocyte: median, 0.9 [IQR, 0.1-2.6] vs 1.3
[IQR, 0.4-2.6], P<0.001; C-reaction protein: median, 37.1 [IQR, 0.1-212.0] vs 9.4
[IQR, 0.2-126.0], P<0.001). The severe patients had higher D-dimer levels than nonsevere patients (median, 0.9 [IQR, 0.1-20.0] vs 0.4 [IQR, 0.2-8.7], P<0.001), which
was indicative of consumptive coagulation system. In addition, severe patients had
multiple organ involvement, such as serious liver (increased lactate dehydrogenase,

alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels), kidney (increased
blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels) and muscle damage (increased creatinine
kinase levels).
Laboratory findings in patients with and without CNS symptoms
Table 3 showed the laboratory findings of patients with and without CNS symptoms.
We found that patients with CNS symptoms had lower lymphocyte, platelet counts
and higher blood urea nitrogen levels compared with those without CNS symptoms
(lymphocyte: median, 1.0 [IQR, 0.1-2.3] vs 1.2 [IQR, 0.2-2.6], P<0.05; platelet: median, 180.0 [IQR, 18.0-564.0] vs 227.0 [IQR, 42.0-583.0], P<0.01; blood urea nitrogen: median, 4.5 [IQR, 1.6-48.1] vs 4.1 [IQR, 1.5-19.1], P<0.05). For the severe subgroup, patients with CNS symptoms also had lower lymphocyte, platelet counts and
higher blood urea nitrogen levels compared with those without CNS symptoms (lymphocyte: median, 0.7 [IQR, 0.1-1.6] vs 0.9 [IQR, 0.2-2.6], P<0.01; platelet: median,
169.0 [IQR, 18.0-564.0] vs 220.0 [IQR, 109.0-576.0], P<0.05; blood urea nitrogen:
median, 5.0 [IQR, 2.3-48.1] vs 4.4 [IQR, 1.5-19.1], P<0.05). For non-severe subgroup, there were no significant differences in laboratory findings of patients with and
without CNS symptoms.
Laboratory findings in patients with and without PNS symptoms
Table 4 showed the laboratory findings of patients with and without PNS symptoms.
We found that there were no significant differences in laboratory findings of patients
with PNS and those without PNS. Similar results were also found in the severe subgroup and non-severe subgroup, respectively.
Laboratory findings in patients with and without muscle injury
Table 5 showed the laboratory findings of patients with and without muscle injury.
Compared with the patients without muscle injury, patients with muscle injury had

higher neutrophil counts, lower lymphocyte counts and higher C-reactive protein levels, D-dimer levels (neutrophil: median, 4.3 [IQR, 0.9-18.7] vs 2.9 [IQR, 0.0-13.0],
P<0.05; lymphocyte: median, 0.9 [IQR, 0.1-2.6] vs 1.2 [IQR, 0.1-2.6], P<0.01; C-reaction protein: median, 56.0 [IQR, 0.1-212.0] vs 11.1 [IQR, 0.1-204.5], P<0.001; Ddimer: median, 1.3 [IQR, 0.2-20.0] vs 0.5 [IQR, 0.1-20.0]). The abnormalities were
manifestation of increased inflammatory response and blood coagulation function. In
addition, we found that patients with muscle injury had multi-organ damage including
more serious liver (increased lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase and
aspartate aminotransferase levels), and kidney (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels) abnormalities.
For the severe subgroup, patients with muscle injury had increased inflammatory response (decreased lymphocyte counts and increased C-reactive protein levels), and
more serious liver (increased lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels), kidney (increased creatinine levels) and muscle damage (increased creatinine kinase levels). For non-severe subgroup, patients with muscle injury only had higher C-reactive protein and creatinine kinase levels compared
with those without muscle injury.
Discussion
This is the first report on detailed neurologic manifestations of the hospitalized
patients with COVID-19. As of February 19, 2020, of 214 patients included in this
study, 88 (41.1%) were severe and 126 (58.9%) were non-severe. Of these, 78
(36.4%) had various neurologic manifestations involved CNS, PNS and skeletal
muscles. Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were older and had more
hypertension but less with typical symptoms such as fever and cough. Severe patients
were more likely to develop neurological symptoms, especially acute cerebrovascular

disease, conscious disturbance and muscle injury. Therefore, for patients with
COVID-19, we need to pay close attention to their neurologic manifestations,
especially for those with severe infectons, which may have contributed to their demise. Moreover, during the epidemic period of COVID-19, when seeing patients with
these neurologic manifestations, doctors should consider SARS-CoV-2 infection as a
differential diagnosis so to avoid delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis and prevention of
transmission.
Recently, ACE2 is identified as the functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 [3], which
is present in multiple human organs, including nervous system and skeletal muscle
[11]. The expression and distribution of ACE2 remind us that the SARS-CoV-2 may
cause some neurological symptoms through direct or indirect mechanisms.
Neurological injury has been confirmed in the infection of other coronavirus such as
in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The researchers detected SARS-CoV nucleic acid in
the cerebrospinal fluid of those patients and also in their brain tissue on autopsy [1213].
CNS symptoms were the main form of neurological injury in patients with COVID19 in this study. The pathological mechanism may be from the CNS invasion of
SARS-CoV-2, similar to SARS and MERS virus. Like other respiratory viruses,
SARS-COV-2 may enter the CNS through the hematogenous or retrograde neuronal
route. The latter can be supported by the fact that some patients in this study had
hyposmia. We also found that the lymphocyte counts were lower for patients with
CNS symptoms than without CNS symptoms. This phenomenon may be indicative of
the immunosuppression in COVID-19 patients with CNS symptoms, especially in the
severe subgroup. Moreover, we found severe patients had higher D-dimer levels than

that of non-severe patients. This may be the reason why severe patients are more
likely to develop cerebrovascular disease.
Consistent with the previous studies [7] muscle symptom was also common in our
study. We speculate that the symptom was due to skeletal muscle injury, as confirmed
by elevated creatine kinase levels. We found that patients with muscle symptoms had
higher creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels than those without muscle
symptoms. Furthermore, creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels in severe
patients were much higher than those of none-severe patients. This injure could be
related to ACE2 in skeletal muscle [14]. However, SARS-CoV, using the same
receptor, was not detected in skeletal muscle by post-mortem examination [15].
Therefore, whether SARS-CoV-2 infects skeletal muscle cells by binding with ACE2
requires to be further studied. One other reason was the infection-mediated harmful
immune response that caused the nervous system abnormalities. Significantly
elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum may cause muscle damage.
This study has several limitations. First, only 214 patients were studied, which
could cause biases in clinical observation. It would be better to include more patients
from Wuhan, other cities in China, and even other countries. Second, all data were
abstracted from the electronic medical records, certain patients with neurological
problem might not be captured if their neurological symptoms were too mild, such as
with hypogeusia and hyposmia . Third, because most patients were still hospitalized
and information regarding clinical outcomes was unavailable at the time of analysis, it
was difficult to assess the effect of these neurologic manifestations on their outcome,
and continued observations of the natural history of disease are needed.
In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 may infect nervous system, skeletal muscle as well as
respiratory tract. In those with severe infection, neurological involvement is more

likely, which includes acute cerebrovascular diseases, conscious disturbance and
skeletal muscle injury. Involvement of the nervous system carries a poor prognosis.
Their clinical conditions may worsen and patients may die soon. Therefore, for
patient with COVID19, physicians should pay close attention to any neurologic
manifestations in addition to the symptoms of respiratory system.
