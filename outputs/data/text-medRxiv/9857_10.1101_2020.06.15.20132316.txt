Abstract

Background: As of June 18, 2020, Iwate is the only one of 47 prefectures in Japan with
no confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. Serological survey for
COVID-19 antibodies is crucial in area with low prevalence as well as epidemic area
when addressing health and social issues caused by COVID-19. Methods: Serum
samples from healthcare workers (n = 1,000, mean 40 ± 11 years) of Iwate Prefectural
Central Hospital, Iwate, Japan were tested for the prevalence of the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies. Two laboratory-based
quantitative tests (Abbott’s and Roche’s immunoassays) and one point-of-care (POC)
qualitative test performed simultaneously. Sensitivity and specificity were 100%, 99.6%
in Abbott’s immunoassay; 100%, 99.8% in Roche’s immunoassay; 97.8%, 94.6% in
Alfa POC test, respectively. Results: The laboratory-based quantitative tests showed
positive in 4 of 1,000 samples (0.4%) (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.79): 4/1,000 (0.4%) (95% CI:
0.01 to 0.79) in Abbott; 0/1,000 (0%) in Roche. Positive samples were not detected for
both Abbott’s and Roche’s immunoassays. The POC qualitative test showed positive in
33 of 1,000 samples (3.3%) (95% CI: 2.19 to 4.41). There were no samples with
simultaneous positive reaction for two quantitative tests and a POC test. Conclusions:

Infected COVID-2 cases were not confirmed by a retrospective serological study in
healthcare workers of our hospital. The POC qualitative tests with lower specificity
have the potential for higher false positive reactions than the laboratory-based
quantitative tests in areas with very low prevalence of COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1,2 has spread rapidly all over the world and consequently
COVID-19 pandemic has seriously affected human health and social life.3 In Japan, the
first case was confirmed on January 20204 and infected cases have been growing in
number across the country. As of May 30, 2020, the cumulative number of them reached
16,650 persons,4 but fortunately there have been no officially confirmed cases in Iwate
Prefecture.5 Because of limited number of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests to diagnose COVID-19, the accurate prevalence of
SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear in this area.
Serological survey with SARS-Co-2 antibodies [immunoglobins (Ig) M and/or
IgG] would be potentially helpful for understanding of infection status in both
individuals and society. Many available point-of-care (POC) antibody tests have been
developed and they can be reliable as using in areas with high prevalence of
COVID-19.6 Although they have the potential for poorly accuracy as using in area with
low prevalence, the availability of them in non-epidemic area has not been well studied.
Our primary endpoint was to examine the prevalence of COVID-19 of healthcare

workers in our hospital in Iwate Prefecture (northeastern area of Japan) where no
infected cases have been officially observed. Secondary endpoint was to evaluate the
accuracy of the POC antibody tests as compared to the quantitative COVID-19 antibody
tests.

METHODS
Study design
This was a retrospective study evaluating the prevalence of COVID-19 antibodies in
healthcare workers in Iwate Prefecture Central Hospital using currently available
immunoassays for detection of antibodies specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Iwate
Prefecture with around 1.3 million residents, on the Pacific coast of northeastern Japan,
is one of the 47 prefectures in Japan. Iwate Prefecture Central Hospital is located in the
city of Morioka, which is located in the center of the prefecture (Fig. 1). Informed
consent was obtained from all participants. The study protocol was approved by the
ethics committee of the Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital (Approval Number. 343), and
carried out according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

A total of 1,302 healthcare workers (physicians, nurses, pharmacists, radiographers,
laboratory technicians, and medical office workers) in Iwate Prefectural Central
Hospital underwent annual health checkups from May 18 to May 29, 2020, and sera
were stored at -20°C until the test in our laboratory. Serum samples (n = 1,000) were
analyzed for detection of antibodies to SARS-Co-2 by laboratory-based quantitative and
POC qualitative tests. The laboratory-based quantitative tests were performed using
Abbott ARCHITECT® SARS-CoV-2 IgG Assay (chemiluminescence microparticle
immunoassay; sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 99.6%) (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park,
IL);7 Roche Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 RUO Assay (electro chemiluminescence
immunoassay; sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 99.8%) (Roche Diagnostics, Basel,
Switzerland).7 The POC qualitative test was performed using Instant-view® plus
COVID-19 Test (lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay; sensitivity: 97.8%,
specificity: 94.6%) (Alfa Scientic Designs, Gregg Street Poway, CA). The results were
read visually after 10 min. Weak signals for IgM and IgG, together or separate, were
considered positive. All tests were conducted at room temperature according to each
manufacturer’s instruction.
In this study, a serum sample showing positive for both Abbott’s and Roche’s
quantitative immunoassays was considered an infected COVID-19 case. A serum

sample showing positive for either Abbott’s or Roche’s immunoassay was a
non-infected case. The prevalence of COVID-19 was determined by the number of
infected cases divided by the number of measured samples. Continuous variables are
expressed as mean ± SD, and categorical variables as numbers and percentages. The
95% CIs for positive rates for the tests were presented in this study.

RESULTS
Overall, serum samples from 1,000 employees (264 men, 736 women; mean age 40 ±
11 years) were analyzed in this study. Positive reactions were found in 4 of 1,000
(0.4%) (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.79) using Abbott’s quantitative immunoassay; 0 of 1,000
(0%) using Roche’s quantitative immunoassay (Table 1). Presence of COVID-19 cases,
which were defined as both positive reaction to SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody tests using
Abbott’s and Roche’s quantitative immunoassays, was not confirmed. The POC
qualitative test showed positive in 33 of 1,000 samples (3.3%) (95% CI: 2.19 to 4.41),
showing higher rates than those of the laboratory-based quantitative immunoassays.
There were no samples with simultaneous positive reactions for two quantitative tests
and a POC test (Table 1).

DISCUSSION

This is the first study to evaluate the positive rate of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in
officially unidentified epidemic region, Iwate Prefecture in Japan. We qualitatively or
quantitatively measured them using three different types of tests, and the results of this
study can be summarized as follows. First, serum samples showing positive for both
Abbott’s and Roche’s quantitative immunoassays were not detectable. Second, all
samples showing positive for the POC qualitative test were considered as false positive
reactions without positive responses for Roche’s immunoassay. These results suggest
that it seems to be early to judge the accuracy of COCID-2 prevalence using the
antibody tests with low specificity even with high sensitivity in the area with very low
prevalence
The COVID-19 epidemic of Japan has reached a peak on April 11, 2020 as
assessed by daily infected cases, with the number of 714 cases.4 After the peak, the
number of COVID-19 cases gradually decreased and returned to the early onset levels
in January. As of May 30, the total number of confirmed cases was 16,650, and 891
peoples have died,4 however infectious cases of Japan are recognized to be relatively
small as compared with those of other developed countries. With flattening of epidemic

curve as a result of the nation adhering to staying at home and social distancing, the
focus has been shifted to widespread testing for COVID-19 antibodies from the RT-PCR
test for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Serological tests to detect antibodies
against the SARS-CoV-2 are crucial not only for assessment of the immunity of
individuals but also for the monitoring the spread of virus and social immunity. In the
epicenter showing explosive growth of infected cases such as New York State, the
prevalence of COVID-19 has been reported to be as high rate as 10% to 15%,8 whereas
in the areas where the spread of infection has been minimized such as Santa Clara
County, California, US, it has shown to be a lower rate (<1% to 3%).9 In Japan, the
positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies was 3.3% in 1,000 outpatients
visited Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital, Kobe;10 5.9% in 202 blood samples
obtained from two community clinics in Tokyo.11 According to the Ministry of Health,
labor and Welfare, in order to examine the performance of five commercially available
test kits, antibody tests were conducted with donated blood collected in Tohoku region
in late April, and showed that COVID-19 antibodies were detected in 2 of 500 samples,
with a positive rate of 0.4%.4 These data and our results are highly suggestive of low
prevalence of COVID-19 in Tohoku district compared with that in Tokyo, Osaka, and
Kobe city. Our results were also compatible with the results of a nationwide COVID-19

antibodies survey conducted by Ministry of Health and Labor of Japan, showing only
0.03% (1/3,009) positive rate in Miyagi Prefecture next to Iwate.4
Iwate Prefecture has been alone among the 47 prefectures in Japan with no
reporting COVID-19 cases since Japan has officially recorded its first case on January
2020.5 It seems that such situation with no infected cases have never been reported for
state-sized regions in other major countries. As of May 30, more than 6,000 inquiries for
RT-PCR tests had been made to a local hotline for residents with possible COVID-19
symptoms, however Iwate had conducted only 730 (11.9%) tests which were the lowest
level in Japan.5 While RT-PCR tests have generally limited to symptomatic patients or
patients with known exposure, Iwate had added another hurdle, requiring the tests to be
approved by some medical experts until the end of April. Even though it is unclear the
reason why Iwate has been skirted SARS-CoV-2, the hospitalized patients with
COVID-19 symptoms including coronavirus-infected pneumonia have never been
observed so far. COVID-19 cases in neighboring prefectures like Miyagi and Aomori
Prefecture4 suggest that Iwate may actually harbor SARS-CoV-2 cases but has not
detected them due to a low level of tests. Our hospital is located in Morioka, the capital
city in the center of Iwate Prefecture, and has given high-quality medical research and
service for the people who live in this region. By means of connecting with all other

clinics and hospitals by a medical network system, our hospital has played a central role
for disease treatment and prevention. On April 7, the state of emergency was declared
by the prime minister of Japan,12 and the residents in Iwate were required to stay in their
home. Because of difficulties in taking a blood sample as part of random sampling from
residents in Iwate, we determined the COVID-19 prevalence of healthcare workers in
our hospital. Moreover, it would be essential for an assessment of nosocomial infection
and provide the underlying data to prevent the spread of infection, potentially leading to
a second wave of COVID-19, even though infected cases have never been found in our
hospital. We believe that our study will provide the data for informing epidemic models
and making public policy decisions.
Recently, several commercial SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays have been
developed and available for assessing the immune condition of individuals. They are
also essential for control of epidemic infection and making decisions of public policy. In
an infectious disease model with very low prevalence, it is recommended to use an
antibody test with a very high specificity (perhaps ≥ 99.5%) resulting a high positive
predictive value.13 In this study, two laboratory-based quantitative tests with a
specificity of 99.5% or more (99.6% in Abbott’s assay; 99.8% in Roche’s assay) were
used, and positive results were detected in 4 (0.4%) samples in the former while no

positive results in the later. As was expected, there were relatively more false positive
COVID-19 antibody results in the POC qualitative test, which specificity was relatively
low (94.6%). To determine the prevalence of COVID-19 in a given populations,
antibody tests with high accuracy and consistent performance are needed not only in
Iwate Prefecture but also in other areas in current Japan.
This study has several limitations. First, it was a survey from a single medical
institution with a relatively small blood samples. Moreover, the participants in this study
were limited to healthcare workers in our hospital, so younger or older people were not
enrolled. Second, positive and negative control tests are significant for the full
validation of COVID-19 antibodies and the assessment of non-specific binding. In this
study, attempts to use the positive or negative control test have presented difficulties
because of no identified infected cases and the stay-at-home order. Third, there is still a
problem in reliability of antibody tests for COVID-19 and development of accurate tests
should be needed. However, they are essential as an epidemiologic tool even in a given
population with low prevalence to track progression towards herd immunity for a long
time
In conclusion, the positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in healthcare
workers of our hospital was 0%. Our results suggest the presence of no COVID-19
