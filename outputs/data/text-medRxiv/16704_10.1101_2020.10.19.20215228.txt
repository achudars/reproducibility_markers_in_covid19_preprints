Abstract

18

Background: Dried blood spot samples (DBS) provide an alternative sample type to

19

venous blood samples for antibody testing. DBS are used by NHS for diagnosing HCV and

20

by PHE for large scale HIV and Hepatitis C serosurveillance; the applicability of DBS based

21

approaches to SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection is uncertain.

22

Objective: To compare antibody detection in dried blood spot eluates using the Roche

23

Elecsys ® immunoassay (index test) with antibody detection in paired plasma samples,

24

using the same assay (reference test).

25

Setting: One Police and one Fire & Rescue facility in England.

26

Participants: 195 participants within a larger sample COVID-19 serodiagnostics study of

27

keyworkers, EDSAB-HOME.

28

Outcome Measures: Sensitivity and specificity of DBS (the index test) relative to plasma

29

(the reference test), at an experimental cut-off; quality of DBS sample collected; estimates of

30

relative sensitivity of DBS vs. plasma immunoassay in a larger population.

31

Results: 18/195 (9.2%) participants tested positive using plasma samples. DBS sample

32

quality varied markedly by phlebotomist, and low sample volume significantly reduced

33

immunoassay signals. Using a cut-off of ten median absolute deviations above the

34

immunoassay result with negative samples, sensitivity and specificity of DBS were 89.0%

35

(95% CI 67.2, 96.9%) and 100.0% (95% CI 97.9, 100%) respectively compared with using

36

plasma. The limit of detection for DBS is about 30 times higher than for plasma.

37

Conclusion: DBS use for SARS-CoV-2 serology, though feasible, is insensitive relative to

38

immunoassays on plasma. Sample quality impacts on assay performance. Alternatives,

39

including the collection of capillary blood samples, should be considered for screening

40

programs.

Introduction

42

Testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is important to understand how the infection has spread

43

in the population. However, extensive population testing is not feasible using the currently

44

available, highly sensitive immunoassays, due to the need to take venous blood samples. As

45

such, serosurveillance using home sampling is currently limited to the use of lateral flow

46

immunoassays (LFIAs), which often have limited sensitivity1.

47

Dried blood spot (DBS) samples provide an alternative sample type to venous blood

48

samples for antibody testing, and have been used extensively in screening for other viruses

49

including Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV2. Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility

50

of using DBS for home blood collection for SARS-CoV-2 antibody screening, with or without

51

virtual supervision5. Small scale feasibility studies have evaluated DBS samples for SARS-

52

CoV-2 antibody detection in high risk populations, using plate based enzyme

53

immunoassays, with promising results 6,7. Field studies indicate the DBS approach is likely to

54

be acceptable8.

55

Recently, laboratories, including those in the United Kingdom (UK)’s National Health Service

56

(NHS), have put in place high-throughput immunoassays for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, which

57

have to date used venous blood samples9. However, when considering population

58

screening or individual risk assessment using antibody tests, an approach offering the

59

potential advantages of easy and safe collection10 without the need for phlebotomy training

60

and with the possibility for self-collection of samples11, stability of the sample at ambient

61

temperature once dried12 and simple transport to the testing laboratory exempt from UN

62

3373 transport regulations13 would be attractive. The taking and transporting of DBS

63

samples has proved successful in screening for other viruses14, and combined with testing

64

on high throughput automated instrumentation could allow wider access to SARS-CoV-2

65

serology.

66

Here we describe a pilot study evaluating the potential for using DBS for SARS-CoV-2

67

antibody testing using the Roche Elecsys ® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay. We chose

68

this platform because it is widely available across the UK’s NHS, and has one of the best

69

performance characteristics of existing assays, as evidenced by a large-scale study 15. The

70

protocol used is an adaptation of that currently used by the PHE Manchester virology

71

laboratory for high-throughput screening of Hepatitis C.

Methods

73

Participants studied

74

Samples were collected from volunteers attending two study locations over 2 days (4th and

75

5th June 2020): Site 1 - Lancashire Police Headquarters and Site 2 - Lancashire Fire and

76

Rescue Service. This recruitment was part of a larger study of UK key workers, EDSAB-

77

HOME, whose characteristics have been described elsewhere 16. Volunteers were key

78

workers working on site during the pandemic, who were neither experiencing any COVID-19

79

compatible symptoms, currently or within the former seven. Eligibility was unaffected by any

80

prior COVID-19 compatible symptoms or SARS-CoV-2 nasal and throat swabs, or antibody

81

tests. The overall approach, study protocol, details of ethical approvals, and analysis for

82

EDSAB-HOME are pre-specified in the study protocol, available at

83

http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN56609224.

84

All EDSAB-HOME participants consented to provide a venous blood sample. All of those

85

who attended a study clinic at Site 1 or 2 on the 4th or 5th June were asked whether they

86

would like to provide an additional DBS sample; as such, they form a convenience sample.

87

Sample collection was performed by 7 different phlebotomists, 5 at Site 1 and 2 at Site 2.

88

The phlebotomists were experienced in the collection of venous blood samples but had no

89

prior training in the collection of DBS samples, and a short on-site training session was

90

provided.

91

DBS collection system

92

High flow BD Microtainer® lancets were used for puncturing fingertip skin. We aimed to

93

collect 4 full size spots onto a custom designed collection card. The card comprised

94

PerkinElmer 226 grade collection paper and circle outlines for the collection of 5 separate

95

25μL blood spots, 4 of which are on a strip of paper attached with a perforated edge to

96

enable removal using a disposable set of tweezers; each sample took ~25-30 seconds to

process. Samples were stored at room temperature in ziplock bags containing a dessicant

98

pack, and returned to PHE Manchester virology laboratory overnight. Samples were

99

processed for elution on the 11th and 12th June, and tested on 18th June. Between elution

100

and storage, they were stored at -80°C.

101

Venous blood analysis (reference test)

102

Venous bloods were collected in 6ml volumes in EDTA Vacutainer® tubes (Beckton

103

Dickinson) at the same time and sent to the PHE Seroepidemiology unit (SEU) Manchester.

104

Plasma samples were separated from the EDTA blood after centrifugation at 1200 g for 15

105

minutes before sending to the PHE Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory (RIPL) Porton

106

Down for testing. All plasma samples were tested with the Roche Elecsys ® Anti-SARS-

107

CoV-2 immunoassay run on the Roche cobas e 801 analytical unit, following the

108

manufacturer’s instructions (COI ≥ 1.0 was considered positive). Results from the venous

109

blood analysis were treated as the reference standard in this study, chosen as this assay is

110

currently the most sensitive and specific approach available for SARS-CoV-2 serological

111

testing at PHE 15. Samples were sent from Public Health Laboratory Manchester on 17th

112

June 2020; due to limited availability of the Roche machines, samples were analysed at PHE

113

Porton Down between 29th June and 3rd June (as part of a large batch of EDSAB-HOME

114

study samples). Between receipt and analysis, all samples were stored at 4°C.

115

Dried blood spot analysis (index test)

116

The size of the 4 spots collected on the card were assessed and recorded. A full-size spot

117

filling the entire collection circle represents a DBS spot of 25μl in size. Samples were rated

118

as “good” if 4 full size spots were collected on the card, see Figure 2a. Spots were

119

considered “small” if they filled only 50% or more of the collection area, and “very small” if

120

they filled less than 50%, see Figure 2b. A paper strip containing the 4 blood spots, the

121

edges of which are pre-perforated, was removed using single use sterile forceps and placed

122

in a 50ml skirted centrifuge tube (Eppendorff) containing 1 mL of PBS/Tween 0.05% (Sigma)

123

elution buffer. Tubes were placed flat on an orbital shaker for overnight elution at room

124

temperature. Eluates were aspirated and transferred to false bottom tubes (Roche

125

Diagnostics) and 12 μL tested with the Roche Elecsys ® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody

126

immunoassay run on the Roche e801 analyzer. Apart from using eluate instead of plasma,

127

the protocol followed that was recommended by the manufacturer.

128

All reference tests were performed before the index tests. Those performing the index tests

129

were blind to the reference test results. No clinical information on the samples was available

130

to those performing either the index or reference test.

131

Statistical Analysis

132

We described the quality of DBS samples overall, and by each individual phlebotomist.

133

Quantitative results from index and reference assays were depicted graphically. Among

134

cases positive on the reference test, linear models were fitted using the R glm function

135

modelling log10(y) ~ log10(x) + c + error, where y is the Roche immunoassay signal in the

136

DBS eluate, x is the Roche immunoassay signal in the paired plasma sample, and c is a

137

categorical variable representing spot size, which is either 0 (if the spot size is ‘good’) vs. 1 if

138

it is small or very small.

139

For the index test, we derived an experimental cut-off, which is ten median absolute

140

deviations about the median in samples negative by the reference test. An estimated limit of

141

detection was computed from the regression model above as the most likely reference test

142

value at which the index test values were at the experimental cut-off.

143

Sensitivity and specificity were computed by comparing the results of the dichotomised index

144

test, using the experimental cut-off, relative to the dichotomised reference test result, using

145

the manufacturer’s cut-off. All computations used R version 4.02. Receiver operating

146

characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed using the pROC17 package, linear modelling

used the glm function, and confidence intervals around proportions were computed using

148

Wilson’s method with the Hmisc package binconf function.

149

In a separate analysis, we examined the distribution of the reference test (Roche Elecsys ®

150

assay on plasma) in 2,652 samples from the EDSAB-HOME study, computing the

151

immunoassay cumulative frequency distribution, and comparing it with the predicted limit of

152

detection of DBS samples.

Results

154

Participants

155

We planned to recruit 200 individuals with paired venous and DBS samples from participants

156

on 03 and 04 June 2020. Of the 475 individuals attending EDSAB-HOME study on those

157

dates, 195 samples were collected, of which 18 were positive using the reference assay

158

(Figure 1). Reasons for not collecting samples included subject or phlebotomist electing not

159

to do so (which was permitted under the protocol). The demographics of those providing

160

DBS samples were similar to those who did not (Table 1).

161

Quality of DBS samples

162

Overall, around two thirds of the DBS samples were rated as “good” (n = 121, 62.1%); 42

163

(21.6%) were “small” and 32 (16.3%) were “very small” (Figure 2). The quality of sample

164

collected varied by phlebotomist collecting the samples (Figure 3) ranging from 27/27

165

samples rates as “good” size to 0/21 rated as a “good” size.

166

Accuracy of the test applied to DBS samples relative to plasma samples

167

When we applied the manufacturer’s cutoff value, optimised for plasma, to the DBS eluates,

168

the sensitivity relative to plasma was poor (44%, 95% CI 24.5, 66.2) (Table 2). We therefore

169

considered whether the cutoff used for plasma was appropriate for our DBS eluates.

170

The relationship between the immunoassay ratio from venous plasma vs. DBS is shown for

171

the 195 samples in Figure 4A. Although samples with negative reference tests gave very

172

similar immunoassay ratios in both index and reference tests (black dots), positive samples

173

generated lower results (median 0.7 vs. 18 units). Linear modelling showed that among

174

positive samples, for every unit increase in antibody ratio in the reference test, index test

175

ratio increased by a similar amount (Table 3). However, the index test (DBS) is much less

176

sensitive: the limit of detection of the index (DBS) test was estimated as corresponding to

177

5.9 antibody index units in tests on plasma (Figure 4A). By contrast, the comparable figure

178

limit of detection for the reference test , computed in the same way as the cut-off for the

179

index test, and is 0.17, or about 33 fold lower. It is important to note that this estimate of limit

180

of detection is based on “good” quality spots. Since index test ratios were 45% (95% CI 23,

181

82%) smaller in those with smaller spots vs. the 62% of “good” spots (Table 3), the test will

182

be even less sensitive if smaller spots are present.

183

Nevertheless, in this data set, the high correlation between tests results (Fig. 4A), and the

184

small number of test results with low reference test results, and a predominance of “good”

185

size spots, generates a high area-under-curve in ROC analysis (c= 0.985, Fig. 4B). Using

186

the experimental cut-off derived above, of 18 positive samples using the reference test, 16

187

were positive in the index test giving a sensitivity estimate of 89.0% (95% CI 67.2, 96.9%),

188

while maintaining a specificity of 100% (95% CI 97.9, 100%) (Table 2).

189

To understand whether this sensitivity is likely to be applicable to other samples, we

190

examined the reference test (Roche Elecsys ® assay on plasma) in 2,652 samples from the

191

EDSAB-HOME study (Fig. 1); there is no overlap between these samples and those on

192

whom DBS samples were taken. Of these, 595 (22%) were positive on the reference assay,

193

of which 62/595 (10.4%) were below the predicted limit of detection of DBS assays (Fig. 4C).

195

Discussion

196

In this study, we showed that the DBS based approach used is an insensitive approach

197

relative to assays on venous plasma, with the limit of detection of the assay estimated to be

198

about 30 times lower with DBS samples. This is not unexpected, because the DBS eluate is

199

at best 10% plasma. In reality, elution will be incomplete, and (as we showed) smaller spots

200

result in lower concentrations of antibody. Nevertheless, in the small sample tested, the

201

sensitivity of DBS at our experimental cut-off relative to the reference test was 89%, with

202

wide confidence intervals due to the small study size. This is compatible with an

203

observation, in a much larger independent cohort of 595 seropositive individuals, that about

204

10% of the population studied have antibody concentrations which we estimate would not be

205

detectable by DBS.

206

This study has several important limitations. Firstly, DBS has only been tested on a

207

relatively small sample set, only 18 of which were positive on the reference standard, and

208

none of whom had a previous positive PCR test. Secondly, sensitivity and specificity

209

estimates of the index test were based on cut-offs derived from the data, and so should be

210

considered exploratory. Thirdly, the sensitivity of the test depends on the distribution of

211

antibody concentrations in the target population; here, we only studied one population of key

212

workers. If other cohorts are studied in which antibody concentrations have declined

213

compared with the one we studied, DBS will perform worse than we observe here. Fourthly,

214

we assessed samples taken by trained phlebotomist. Variation in performance was

215

observed between phlebotomists (and presumably would also occur between self-taken

216

samples); as such, usability studies to quantify the extent of this variation would be essential

217

to understand how the tests perform when self-administered by the target population.

218

The key problem we have identified is lack of sensitivity. However, in populations with large

219

amounts of antibody, such as individuals with more severe disease, or when very sensitivity

220

assays are used, the different limits of detection of DBS vs. plasma samples may not

221

translate into lower sensitivity. This may have occurred in the case of Morley et al, who

222

report DBS performance to be comparable to matched serum samples, with a sensitivity of

223

98.1% and specificity of 100%, when compared to an in-house ELISA which detects Spike

224

glycoprotein antibodies (using 87 samples from 80 volunteers, 37 who had had a previous

225

PCR positive result)18.

226

When considering large-scale DBS testing programmes, additional factors which might

227

impact on programme success include the more complex processing of DBS samples

228

relative to plasma samples upon arrival in the testing laboratory. Nevertheless, this work

229

indicates that for serosurveillance studies using the Roche Elecsys ® Nucleoprotein

230

antibody assay, DBS based SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay workflows are feasible, subject to

231

re-adjustment of cut-offs (as done in this study) and at the expense of sensitivity.

plasma (reference text, x-axis) vs. paired dried blood spots (index test, y-axis). Samples positive in
the plasma immunoassay are in red. Solid blue line: manufacturer’s cutoff for plasma samples (1).
Red dotted line: experimental cutoff ten median absolute deviations above the reference test
negative median for DBS (index test) samples (n=177). Blue dotted line: experimental cutoff ten
median absolute deviations above the reference test negative median for plasma (reference test)
samples. Solid black line: regression of index test immunoassay ratios on reference test
immunoassay ratios. Arrow: estimate of limit of detection. (B) Receiver operator curve, showing
