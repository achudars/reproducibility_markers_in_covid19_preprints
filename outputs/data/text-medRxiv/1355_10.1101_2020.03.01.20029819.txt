Summary
Background In December 2019, pneumonia infected with a novel coronavirus burst in
Wuhan, China. Now the situation is almost controlled in China but is worse outside
China. We aimed to build a mathematical model to capture the global trend of epidemics
outside China.
Methods In this retrospective, outside-China diagnosis number reported from Jan 21
to Feb 28, 2020 was downloaded from WHO website. We develop a simple regression
model on these numbers:
𝑙𝑜𝑔!" (𝑁# + 34) = 0 · 0515 × 𝑡 + 2 · 075
where Nt is the total diagnosed patient till the ith day, t=1 at Feb 1.
Findings Based on this model, we estimate that there have been about 34 unobserved
founder patients at the beginning of spread outside China. The global trend is
approximately exponential, with the rate of 10 folds every 19 days.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
In December 2019, pneumonia infected with a novel coronavirus burst in Wuhan,
China. Now the situation is almost controlled in China but is worse outside China.
Now there are 4,691 patients across 51 countries and territories outside China. We
searched PubMed and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database for
articles published up to Feb 28, 2020, using the keywords “COVID”, “novel
coronavirus”, “2019-nCoV” or “2019 novel coronavirus”. No published work
about the global trend of epidemics outside China could be identified.
Added value of this study
We built a simple “log-plus” linear model to capture the global trend of epidemics
outside China. We estimate that there have been about 34 unobserved founder
patients at the beginning of spread outside China. The global trend is approximately
exponential, with the rate of 10 folds every 19 days.
Implications of all the available evidence
With the limited number of data points and the complexity of the real situation, a
straightforward model is expected to work better. Our model suggests that the
COVID-19 disease follows an approximate exponential growth model stably at the
very beginning. We predict that the number of confirmed patients outside China
will increase ten folds in every 19 days without strong intervention by applying our
model. Powerful actions on public health should be taken to combat this epidemic
all over the world.

Introduction
In early December of 2019, pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan, the
capital of Hubei province, China.1 A novel coronavirus (now named as COVID-19) was
verified and identified as the seventh member of enveloped RNA coronavirus (subgenus
sarbecovirus, Orthocoronavirinae subfamily) through high-throughput sequencing.2-4
Human-to-human transmission in hospital and family settings had been accumulating
5-7
and has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019 based on
evidence from early transmission dynamics.8 According to WHO statistics, the
accumulating number of diagnosed patients in China was 78,961 in Feb 28, 2020.9
COVID-19 raised intension not only within China but internationally. Since the first
case of pneumonia caused by COVID-19 was reported from Wuhan, COVID-19
patients had rapidly been diagnosed in other cities of China and the neighboring
countries including Thailand, South Korea, Japan, and even to a few Western
countries.10-12 On January13 2020, the Ministry of Public Health of Thailand reported
the first imported case of lab-confirmed novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 13 As of Feb28
2020, cases had been reported in 52 countries and territories. The number of confirmed
COVID-19 cases had reached 4,691 outside China, 9 and the number is still increasing.
South Korea, the worst affected country outside China, has reported another jump. The
571 new cases brought South Korea’s total confirmed cases to 2,337. A surge in cases
of COVID-19 in Italy, Japan and Iran also heightened fears that the world is on the
brink of a pandemic.14 In Feb 28, WHO increased the assessment of the risk of spread
and risk of impact of COVID-19 to very high at the global level.
Recently, many researchers devoted to more details about the analysis of the spread
of epidemic.14,15 Some paralleled results have shown that the reproductive number R0
estimated of COVID-19 is bigger than that of SARS based on different models. 16-18
With the limited number of data points and the complexity of the real situation, a
straightforward model is expected to work better (see Discussion). In this study, we
propose a “log-plus” model for the situation prediction which only requires daily
number of total diagnosis outside China. This model assumes that there were some
unobserved founder patients at the beginning of spread outside China and exponential
growth later. Despite the simplicity of our model, it fits the data well (R2=0.991). The
prediction is expected to provide practical significance on social application and
evidence for enhancing public health interventions to avoid severe outbreaks.
Methods
Data
Daily diagnosis number of countries outside China is download from WHO situation
reports (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situationreports). The data in this analysis starts from Jan 21 and currently it ends at Feb 28.
Model
We first explored the data by plotting log transformed daily number. We observed a
good linear trend recently, but a relatively poor fit at the beginning of spread. We
therefore consider that there are some unobserved founder patients at the beginning.
Based on exploratory data analysis and mathematical intuition we proposed the
following model:
𝑙𝑜𝑔!" (𝑁# + 𝑢) = 𝑎 × 𝑡 + 𝑏

where Nt is the number of diagnosed patients outside China according to WHO at the
tth day, t=1 at Feb 1; u is the number of unobserved founder patients at the beginning
of spread outside China; a and b are simple linear regression parameters. We
enumerated u from 0 to 100 with step size 1. For each u, we calculated Pearson’s
correlation R2 between t and 𝑙𝑜𝑔!" (𝑁# + 𝑢) . We selected the 𝑢7 that maximize R2
and estimate corresponding 𝑎7 and 𝑏8 using a simple linear regression between t and
𝑙𝑜𝑔!" (𝑁# + 𝑢7).

Figure 2: The Exponential Growth of COVID-19 Infection Outside China
Future Number Prediction
Currently the number of diagnoses at Febuary 28 is 4,691. We predict that the number
of diagnoses outside China will expand exponentially with the rate of 10 folds every 19
days without strong intervention.
Conclusion
Based on this model, we estimated that there have been about 34 unobserved founder
patients at the beginning of spread outside China. Our model suggests that the COVID19 disease follows an approximate exponential growth model stably at the very
beginning. The situation is dangerous as we expect 10 folds increases of patients every
19 days without strong intervention. We call on world-wide strong actions on public
health referring to experiences learnt from China and Singapore.
Discussion
In this report, we only analyzed the total number of diagnoses outside China. The
country scale data is available but is not as complete as total number. Here, we limited
this analysis to capture the global trend.
This model is a minimal extension of the ‘default’ exponential growth model with
the estimation of 34 unobserved founder patients outside China. An almost perfect
model fitting (R2=0·991) indicates that the spread of disease does follow our model.
A simple and straightforward linear model inherits with some advantages: (1) it
works on small sample size due to limited observation or somewhat unperfect data. (2)
it is relatively robust in complex situations. The virus spreading pattern is complex and
yet varies across the world. A simple model simplified the situation and provides
coarse-grained trend estimation. (3) A linear model has nice extrapolation ability
comparing to complex models (e.g. Neural network).
The existent of 34 unobserved founder patients is not surprising. They may have mild
symptoms thus did not went to the hospitals. However, we did not preclude the
