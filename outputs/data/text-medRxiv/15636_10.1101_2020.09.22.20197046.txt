Performance Assessment of First-Generation Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Serological Assays
ABSTRACT
The clinical and epidemiological use of SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays is under debate with
urgent need to validate and verify the performance of SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays. We aim to
assess the clinical and analytical performance of three commercial serological assays of SARSCoV-2, comparing three anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG ELISA and identifying the seroconversion and
seroprevalence in our population.
A cross sectional study conducted from April 2020 to July 2020 at National Institute of Blood
disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation Karachi, Pakistan with sample size of 404, enrolled
consecutively. Participants were categorized into four groups’ namely convalescent
plasmadonors (CPDs n=239), health care professionals (HCPs n=44), healthy blood donors
(HBDs n=70) and from community (n=51).
We evaluated the performance of Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 electrochemiluminescence (ECLIA)
assay on Cobas-e411 by Roche,

three qualitative anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG enzyme linked

imunosorbant assay (ELISA) by (Generic assays, Euroimmun & Omega diagnostics) ,one
quantitative ELISA assay by AESKU Diagnostics and two immune chromatography(ICT) kits
namely InstaTestTM by CORTEZ and TEST IT by TURKLAB.
From total 404 subjects, 322 (83.5%) were males. Mean age was 36.79±11.95 years. Among 239
in CPDs group, 202(84.5%) showed positive antibodies by ECLIA. The qualitative anti-SARSCoV-2 IgG ELISA was positive in 174 (72.8%) and quantitative IgG in 180(75.3%) with mean
titer of 56.7 +39.7 U/ml. Sensitivity and specificity of ECLIA were 97.44& 99%, ELISA by
Generic assays were 67.85% and 89.9%; Euroimmun had 90.38% and 94.9%; Omega
Diagnostics 96.4% and 95% and the AESKULISA 93.75% and 100% respectively.

Seroconversion was found to be 53.8% and 77.77% within 7 -8 days and 12 to 14 days post onset
of symptoms respectively. ICT had more specificity but less sensitivity. Seroprevalence was
found to be 84.5%, 40.9% and 21.4% in CPDs, HCPs and HBDs respectively.
The Roche ECLIA, qualitative ELISA by Omega Diagnostics & Euroimmun showed higher
sensitivity as well as higher specificity. Quantitative ELISA has higher specificity and relatively
high sensitivity. Significant numbers of COVID patients do not have detectable antibodies by all
assays.

INTRODUCTION:
The global pandemic of COVID-19 caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona virus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) affected Pakistan in mid-March1 and till mid-July 2020, a total of 254,000
cases were diagnosed and 5,500 (2.1%) deaths reported2. According to the Center of Disease
Control (CDC), the recommended method for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is to detect the RNA
of SARS-CoV-2 by real time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) with
samples collected from nasopharynx and / or oropharynx3, 4.Commercial manufacturers
developed serological testing kits using different methodologies5.FDA gave approval for the use
of these kits as Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)6. Verification and validation of these
assays is required to achieve the clinical accuracy of test results7, 8.
There are several advantages of serological testing. Pre analytical and analytical parts of
serological assays have comparatively easy sample collection, simple to analyzeand requires less
technical expertise as compared to nucleic acid detection. Serological testing can be performed in
basic and small clinical laboratory settings8,9. Post analytical important uses of antibody testing
include; to determine the exposure of this disease among tested population, to assess the immune
response against this virus and to identify the actual number of people who had acquired this
virus but were asymptomatic therefore they didn’t get tested on RT-PCR. The results of this
testing will be significant for epidemiological studies, disease surveillance and later in
monitoring of response to the vaccine9, 10. It plays vital role for identification of convalescent
plasma donors for therapeutic use in treating moderate to severely ill COVID-19 patients10.
There are several methodologies available for the antibody testing which include immune
chromatographytechnique(ICT),electrochemiluminescenceimmunoassay(ECLIA),chemiluminee
(CLIA) and enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA)8,11 etc. To-date very little data

MATERIAL &METHOD:
Study Design: A cross sectional study conducted from April 2020 to June 2020 in Karachi,
Pakistan after the approval from institution’s ethical review committee. Informed written consent
was taken from all study subjects.Non-probability consecutive sampling technique was used for
sampling. Three milliliter (ml) blood was collected in gel vacutainer from all subjects or
serological testing and nasopharyngeal swab was taken for anti-SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing.
We divided our subjectsin following four groups shown in Table no 1. The anti-SARS-CoV-2
antibodies were tested by ECLIA, ICT and by ELISA. The ECLIA and ICT were qualitative
while ELISA was performed on both qualitative as well as quantitative kits.

Analytical Performance Methodology:
For analytical performance, repeatabilitydone using known negative samples, pre-pandemic
samples collected from blood bank archive, and known positive patient samples. Intra-assay
precision was assessed by 20 times single run. Inter-assay precision was assessed by running
these samples 20 times on separate runs on each method. Sensitivity of ECLIA was calculated on
COVID-19 RT-PCR positive patients tested after 2-5 days of onset of symptoms. They were
closely followed up; 13 individuals were tested for antibody presence on 7 - 8 days post onset of
symptoms and 18 study subjects were checked after 12- 14 days after symptoms. Sensitivity at
more than 28 days post symptoms was checked in CPDs’ samples. The sensitivity of qualitative
and quantitative ELISA and ICTwas checked on CPDs’samples.The number of participants in
each group is shown in Table no 2.

RESULTS
Total 404 subjects were recruited in the study. Out of these, 342 (84.6%) were males.Mean age
of the subjects was 36.79±11.95 years. There were 239 CPDs; of them, 202 (84.5%) had a
positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 by ECLIA.The qualitative ELISA performed in 174/239 CP donors,
found to be positive in 142/174(82%) with a mean serum dilution of >1:160 (Range >1:80 to
>1:320 serum dilution).Quantitative IgG by ELISA performed on total 252 subjects, of these
239(94.8%) were CPDs; 180 of these 239 (75.3%) were positive for IgG and their mean antiSAR-CoV-2IgG level was 56.7±39.7U/ml. Seroprevalence was found to be 84.5% in CPDs at 21
days post onset of symptoms.
A total of 44 HCPs were recruited, their RT-PCR performed 3 to 5 days after the onset of
symptoms. Their anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels were tested by ECLIAon 7-8days and 12-14
days;seven of 13(53.8%) developed anti-SAR-CoV-2 within 10 days while 14 of the 18
(77.77%) developed antibodies by the end of second week of symptoms. Seroprevalence was
found to be 40.9% in HCPs at 21 days post onset of symptoms.
Of the 70 HBDs screened, 15(21.4%) developed this antibody. These 15were also analyzed by
quantitative IgGELISA and 14(93.3%) of them showed an antibody level of 27.2 ±19.95 U/ml.
Seroprevalence was found to be 21.4% in asymptomatic HBDs.
In community group 12 patients were PCR positive and out of these 12, three patients had
antibodies positive on ECLIA. Seroprevalence could not be calculated in this group since these
patients were lost to follow up.

DISCUSSON:

We evaluated the performance of three different serological assays infourdifferentgroups. This
study included convalescent plasma donors’whorecovered from COVID-19 infection.The
performance characteristics of different kits e.g., sensitivity claimed by their manufacturers, fell
short since our calculated sensitivities were below thatofthe manufacturers’ claim. This finding is
in accordance with an Australian report published on 29th April 2020 that assessed post-market
validation of three serological assays for COVID-19 where they tested the serological assays on
CPDs and found out their own diagnostic performance for each kit14.
Out of the three methodologies, ECLIA assay had sensitivity 97.44%, qualitative ELISA by
Omega diagnostics had 96.4% while other two qualitative ELISA had lower sensitivity. This
may be due to the fact that electrochemiluminescence assay detects total antibodies (including
IgG) against SARS-CoV-2 while ELISA is only IgG specific.
Mei San Tang et al compared Abbott Chemiluminescenceassay and ELISA within 5 days of
onset of symptoms, none of the immunoassays was able to detect the antibodies9. This leads to
an important observation that when to test for the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2
antibodies in our population.The samples which were taken from HCPs and community within 3
to 5 days post the onset of symptoms did not show antibody positivity on either assay. This
finding is in contrast with the manufacturer’s claim that for ECLIA by Roche which showed
65.5% (CI 56%-74%) sensitivity when tested within 6 days PCR confirmation. None the less,
gold standard for the diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection is RT-PCR and we will need
larger cohorts of patients to identify correct time for using serological assays in our population.
We found important and interesting finding in our study, out of 239 CPDs the 37 (15.5%) did not
develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virusbyany of the testing method i.e. ECLIA,

quantitative and qualitative ELISA.Cellular immunity might have been developed in these
seronegative CP donors. This remains to be tested in our cohort. Shane et al in June2020 detected
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in 100% and 70% of convalescent COVID patients; they further
discovered that T cell responses are not only on spike (S) but also on M, N, and other ORFs of
SARS-CoV-215.
The two rapid testing devices using ICT methodology showed the sensitivity for IgM/IgG tests
ranging from 23.53% to 90.4%. The specificity of both the devices on IgM and IgG tests was
found to be 95% to 100%. The results of sensitivity are, however in contrast with the findings of
Z.Zainol Rashid et al. They used nine rapid devices based on the principle of colloidal goldlabeled immunochromatography. Their sensitivity for both IgM and IgG tests ranges between
72.7% and 100%, while specificity ranges between 98.7% to 100%16.
The heathyblood donors had no symptoms of COVID-19 infection, they were healthy and
active;a quarter of them seroconverted against COVID-19. This is a significant finding as it
highlights the prevalence of this disease in general population. This observation has not been
reported until now. We have also correlated the results of ECLIA and ELISA in our groups of
CP donors and healthy blood donors which is showing positive correlation between these two
assays.
Limitation of study was that we could not perform RT-PCR of healthy blood donors and ELISA
of health care professionals and people from community due to cost limitation.
The strength of the study was that weincluded 239 convalescent plasma donors who recovered
from COVID-19 infection that is by far the largest number of convalescent plasma donors
recruited in any study.Wedid quantitative ELISA in the CPDs’ sample; this is the largest number
of CPDs tested on quantitative ELISA till today in Pakistan.

CONCLUSION:
In conclusion, the Roche ECLIA assay has higher sensitivity then ELISA and ICT methods in
our study. ECLIA and ELISA are not to be used for the acute diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2
infection since these assays have poor sensitivity when tested within 7 days post onset of
symptoms. Serological assays are important in determining the prevalence of this disease. In our
study, all the commercially available serological assays are detecting antibodies against
nucleocapsid protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. New serological assays should also be evaluated
for the detection of antibodies against receptor binding domain of spike protein that is said to be
neutralizing antibody17. Serial monitoring of IgG titers among patients for the collection of CP as
well as pooled human IVIG is also an important query for the future of treatment of COVID-19.
Measuring immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is essential for vaccinedevelopment, T cell responses are
not only on spike but also on M, N, and other ORFs. These newer methods are being available
for measure the T-Cell response, need of validate these assays is highly recommended.
