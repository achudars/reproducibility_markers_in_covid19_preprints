Abstract
Since the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic various generic variants have
been described. Of specific interest is a new variant, which was observed in England
during December 2020 and is now termed B.1.1.7. This variant is now associated with
increased infectivity and therefore its spread within the community is of great
importance. The Israeli government established three noteworthy programs namely,
mass PCR testing, focused protection of the elderly and more recently an unparalleled
prioritized vaccination program. In this study we analyzed primary data of >300,000
RT-PCR samples collected throughout December 6th 2020 until February 10th 2021
in the general community and nursing homes. We identified that within a period of six
weeks, the B.1.1.7 variant was capable of out competing the wildtype SARS-CoV-2
strain to become the main strain. Furthermore, we show that the transmission of
B.1.1.7 in the 60+ population reached a near complete halt, due to an ongoing
surveillance testing program in nursing homes and the vaccination program of Israel.
Thus, proactive protection programs such as routine surveillance and monitoring of
populations at risk combined with prioritized vaccination, is achievable and will result
in a reduction of severe illness and subsequent death.

Introduction
In December 2020, a distinct phylogenetically cluster of SARS-CoV-2 was identified
in London as well as in Southeast and East of England1. Since the emergence of this
variant (now termed variant B.1.1.7), it has been sequenced and has shown to display
a number of mutations. These mutations may affect its infectivity and thus spread in
the community2. Variant B.1.1.7 is defined by 17 mutations, among which several are
located in the spike protein that mediates SARS-CoV-2 attachment and entry into

human epithelial cells3. At least two mutations were suggested to have biological
significance. Mutation N501Y has been shown to enhance binding affinity to human
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)3, while mutation P681H, was suggested to
affect infection and transmission due to its location4,5. In support of this, preliminary
evidence from epidemiological studies estimated that B.1.1.7 is 43-82% more
transmissible6 and thus associated with an increase in the effective reproduction
number 𝑹𝒕 by a factor of 1.4-1.87.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Israel has established three noteworthy programs.
The first, is a high throughput national RT-PCR testing program that is based on large
laboratories, capable of assessing up to 9,200 tests/million inhabitants per day. The
second, an ongoing surveillance testing program in nursing homes (also termed
“Protector of Fathers and Mothers” program) (https://corona.health.gov.il/en/magenisrael/). Thirdly, an unparalleled pro-active national vaccination program (using the
Pfizer vaccine), that reached a coverage of 80% for the first dose in elderly >60 within
38 days8. To explore the transmission dynamics of the variant B.1.1.7 and to estimate
the success of the above operations to mitigate the risk in the general population and
in the elderly, we analyzed primary data of >300,000 RT-PCR samples collected
throughout December 6th 2020 until February 10th 2021 in the general community and
nursing homes. This timely data provides an ideal setting to shed light on future policy
making of governments in light of the possibility spread of the B.1.1.7 variant or even
future ones.

Results
Rapid transmission of the B.1.1.7 variant in the Israeli Population
The B.1.1.7 variant poses a deletion of two amino acids at positions 69-70 (D69-70),
which is associated with the inability of the Thermo Fisher TaqPath COVID-19 assay
probe to detect the Spike gene (S gene). Indeed, S gene target failures (SGTF) were
recently shown to be primarily due to the new variant9, and molecular studies have
used this “Flat S” phenomenon to assess the transmission data of the B.1.1.7 variant9.
Using SGTF data from available ~300,000 individual tests, which were analyzed
throughout December 6th 2020 until February 10th 2021 we were able to monitor the
spread of B.1.1.7 variant and assess the impact of Israel programs to reduce
transmission. Until December 22, the B.1.1.7 variant was undetectable within the pool
of positive cases in Israel. Strikingly, within a period of four weeks, the B.1.1.7 variant
became the dominant strain (January 21st), reaching to 92% following two more weeks
(Figure 1A). Specifically, we calculated the effective reproduction number, 𝑹𝒕 which
is the expected number of new infections at time 𝑡 caused by an infectious individual.
To evaluate the daily 𝑅% , we used the methodology previously introduced by Cori et
al.10,11 that was also considered in our previous work12,13. This data-driven approach
suggests that 𝑅% is the ratio between 𝐼% , the number of new infections generated at
day t and ∑%()
*+, 𝐼%(* 𝑤* , the sum of infection incidence up to time step t − 1 weighted by
the infectivity function 𝑤* . For 𝑤* , we considered 10 days truncated gamma distribution
with a mean of 3.96 days (95% CI: 3.53-4.39 days), an SD 4.75 days (4.46-5.07
days)14. We used our data to evaluate the reproductive number for both the SARSCOV-2 wild type and the B.1.1.7 variant. For an accurate representation of Israel, we
scaled our data with the age-stratified incidence data published daily by the Israeli
ministry of health (MOH) (https://datadashboard.health.gov.il/COVID-19/). Finally, we

shifted the data by 3.5 days, which corresponded to the average time between
exposure until obtaining the test outcome. Prior the impact of the national lockdown
the 𝑅% of the B.1.1.7 variant was as high as 1.71 (95% CI: 1.59-1.85) compared to 1.12
(95% CI: 1.10-1.15) observed for the wildtype (Figure 1B, December 30, 2021).
Furthermore, we found that during the entire period the variant was 45% more
transmissive then the wildtype.

Assessment of the distribution of the B.1.1.7 variant in different age groups revealed
a clear increase in the numbers of B.1.1.7positive individuals from age groups 0-19 and
20-59. While a modest increase was observed in the 60+ aged group until January 14,
2021, the incidence of B.1.1.7positive individuals aged 60+ plateaued and eventually
declined (Figure 1C). In support of this, pearson correlation analysis of the rise in
incidence among the different age groups revealed that between December 24, 2020
and January 14, 2021 the rise in the incidence of B.1.1.7 was highly correlated among
all age groups (r>0.99, Figure 1C). Following January 14, 2021, a striking decline was
observed in the correlation coefficient only in the 60+ age group (r= -0.35 and -0.28,
60+ vs. 0-19 or 20-59 age, respectively, Figure 1C). Notably, this phenomenon was
associated with the fact that by that time point, 50% of the 60+ aged population was
two weeks post the 1st dose of vaccination.

To assess the ongoing surveillance testing program in nursing homes, we compared
the Ct threshold values in 60+ age groups in the general community versus nursing
homes. Ct threshold values were used as predictive markers for viral load where a
higher Ct indicates lower mucosal viral titers. This analysis revealed significantly lower
Ct values, in both viral tested genes, in the community in comparison with nursing

homes with matching age groups (t-test, p<0.001) (Figure 1D). Collectively, as viral
load drives transmission15,16 these data underscores the important role of random
surveillance testing in nursing homes.

Discussion
Using data collected through RT-PCR testing at the Electra-TAU lab we investigated
the dynamics and spread of the B.1.1.7 variant. We identified that within a period of
six weeks, the B.1.1.7 variant was capable of out competing the wildtype SARS-CoV2 strain to become the main strain (more than 90% of positive tests). We found that
the B.1.1.7 variant is 45% more transmissible than the wildtype strain (95% CI: 2060%). This is within the range of previous estimates, which suggested a 1.56 increase
in England9. These similar estimates were observed despite the substantial
differences between the countries in terms of demographic characteristics including
age distribution, household size, the density of living areas, as well as key settings
that impact transmission including lockdowns and vaccination coverage.

Increased viral transmission may have substantial implications on the ability to protect
SARS-CoV-2 susceptible populations. Thus, it is important to examine governmental
policies such as vaccination programs and focused protection interventions.
Comparative age-based analysis demonstrated that transmission and spread of the
B.1.1.7 variant among the majority of the population at risk (as define by being over
the age of 60) was significantly reduced in comparison with other age groups. Of even
greater interest, we show that while the transmission of B.1.1.7 continued to rise
dramatically in the population aged 0-59 with similar kinetics, the rise in the 60+
population reached a near complete halt. This is likely due to impact of the Israeli

vaccination program, which was initiated in the 60+ age group. Consequently, a clear
containment of B.1.1.7 variant was shown in 60+ age group after January 14. In this
regard, by this date in which the B.1.1.7 variant already gained transmission
dominance, ~50% of the elderly population were two weeks post their 1st vaccination
dose. This interpretation is highly reasonable given the relative rise in B.1.1.7
transmission in ages 0-59 during that same time and the fact that no other
measurements were introduced.

Our data confirmed that pro-active surveillance programs of populations at risk such
as those found in nursing homes were capable of early detection, which likely enabled
containment of further viral spread within this housing community. This is observed by
the significant difference in Ct threshold levels, which were higher in nursing homes in
comparison with the general population. Thus, proactive protection programs such as
routine surveillance and monitoring of populations at risk combined with prioritized
vaccination, is achievable and will result in a reduction of severe illness and
subsequent death.
