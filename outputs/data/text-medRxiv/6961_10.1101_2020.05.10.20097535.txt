Abstract
Background: Accurate serological assays can improve the early diagnosis of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, but few studies have compared performance
characteristics between assays in symptomatic and recovered patients.
Methods: We recruited 32 patients who had 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19; 18 hospitalized and
actively symptomatic, 14 recovered mild cases), and measured levels of IgM (against the full-length S1 or
the highly homologous SARS-CoV E protein) and IgG (against S1 receptor binding domain [RBD]). We
performed the same analysis in 103 pre-2020 healthy adult control (HC) participants and 13 participants
who had negative molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2.
Results: Anti-S1-RBD IgG levels were very elevated within days of symptom onset for hospitalized
patients (median 2.04 optical density [OD], vs. 0.12 in HC). People who recovered from milder COVID19 only reached similar IgG levels 28 days after symptom onset. IgM levels were elevated early in both
groups (median 1.91 and 2.12 vs. 1.14 OD in HC for anti-S1 IgM, 2.23 and 2.26 vs 1.52 in HC for anti-E
IgM), with downward trends in hospitalized cases having longer disease duration. The combination of
the two IgM levels showed similar sensitivity for COVID-19 as IgG but greater specificity, and identified
4/10 people (vs. 3/10 by IgG) with prior symptoms and negative molecular testing to have had COVID19.
Conclusions: Disease severity and timing both influence levels of IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2,
with IgG better for early detection of severe cases but IgM more suited for early detection of milder cases.

Introduction
The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic began in December 2019,1,2 and over 3
million people around the world have contracted the disease as of May 2020. Among both symptomatic
and asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2, real time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction (rRT-PCR) remains the major confirmatory test. In the U.S., widespread rRT-PCR testing
remains limited despite improvements. Moreover, rRT-PCR testing among clinical COVID-19 patients
in China showed suboptimal sensitivity (positive in 72 of 104 sputum, 5 of 8 nasal swabs, 126 of 392
pharyngeal swabs).3 This is in keeping with previously identified challenges in the molecular diagnosis
of the related SARS-CoV, including low viral count at onset, insufficient autopsy or neutralization tests as
gold standard, and non-identical genetic strains.4,5 Several serological tests have been developed to detect
immunoglobulins (IgG & IgM) against viral proteins,6,7 but serological tests face usual challenges of
delayed positivity,5 host immune function8 and cross-reactivity to other coronaviruses.9,10 Design of
epidemiological surveys and treatment trials can therefore be greatly hindered by the absence of a
consensus laboratory diagnostic algorithm.

Similar to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is composed of four structures: envelope, membrane,
nucleocapsid, and spike.2,11-13 The majority of amino acids unique to SARS-CoV-2 are located in the
receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit,14 and S1 as well as the RBD domain have been used in
serological assays for COVID-19.6 Previous work on SARS-CoV found increased envelope (E) protein
levels during viral replication,15 and E proteins from the two beta coronaviruses only differ by four amino
acids.2 S1 and E are therefore reasonable antigenic targets for serological assay development. Herein, we
performed novel IgM (against the full-length SARS-CoV-2 S1 and highly homologous SARS-CoV E
protein) assays and a commercially available IgG (against the S1-RBD) assay in hospitalized and
recovered COVID-19 patients, and compared their serological profiles with pre-2020 healthy control
(HC) participants and people with negative SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR results (previously symptomatic or
never-symptomatic).

Materials and Methods
Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents
This study was approved by Emory University Institutional Review Board. Written consents
were obtained from all participants or their legally authorized representatives (when appropriate).

Study Participants
Four groups of subjects were included in the study: 1) Hospitalized symptomatic patients with
moderate-to-severe influenza-like illness (ILI) in keeping with COVID-19 confirmed by rRTPCR (n=18, with 14 requiring artificial ventilation; samples collected during hospitalization a
median of 10.5 days after symptom-onset, range 4-24 days); 2) people who recovered from mild
self-limited COVID-19 (n=14; nine with (+)rRT-PCR, four with ILI following direct contact
with confirmed COVID-19 cases but not eligible for rRT-PCR, and one with ILI following direct
contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases but did not seek rRT-PCR; samples collected a median
of 18.5 days after initial symptom onset, range 9-33); 3) pre-2020 HC (n=103) recruited through
inflammation studies targeting the young (PI: WTH),16 middle-aged (PI: WW),17 or older (PI:
WTH) adults; and 4) people who had (-)rRT-PCR results in 2020 (n=13; two symptomatic at
time of draw, eight recovered from mild self-limited ILI, and three never had any symptoms;
none had follow-up rRT-PCR). Sample size was calculated based on one previous study6 when
the current study began using a more conservative effect size (0.8 vs. >1), with an estimated
disease prevalence of 5%-20%. Plasma was collected from five hospitalized participants, nine
mild participants, and all pre-2020 HC and those with (-)rRT-PCR. Serum was collected from
the remaining 13 hospitalized participants and five mild participants.

Serological Assays
A commercial anti-S1 receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG indirect ELISA assay (GenScript,
Piscataway, NJ) was purchased and performed per manufacturer’s protocol, except two plasma
dilutions (1:16 and 1:64) were selected from a range of 1:8 – 1:256 performed in a subgroup of
COVID-19 and pre-2020 HC subjects.

For IgM, we developed two novel assays. Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 S1 (230-01101-100,
produced from E. coli) and SARS-related E (228-11400-2, produced from E. coli) proteins were
purchased from RayBiotech (Peachtree Corners, GA). For IgM, 100 μL of 2.5 μg/mL antigen in
PBS was applied to standard 96-well plate at 4oC overnight. Six (out of 96) wells were coated
only with 5% albumin without S1/E. Plates were washed with PBS before blocking at room
temperature for 1 hr with 4% non-fat dried milk (nfdm). Diluted plasma samples (1:64, 1:64,
1:256, 1:1024 in PBS containing 2% nfdm and 0.1% Tween20) were loaded into blocked wells
for 1 hr. Wells were then washed three times with PBS, and 50 μL of 1:20,000 goat anti-human
IgM fc (09-035-043, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) was added to
each dilution condition for 30 min. Wells were treated with strepavidin-HRP (1:200, 50 μL per
well) for 20 min in the dark, washed, incubated with substrate mix for 20 min in the dark, and
treated with reaction stop solution. Plates were then read at 450 nm (Molecular Devices,
SpectraMax-M2) followed by background (570 nm) subtraction.

Statistical Analyses

All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 26 (IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY) except for
curve-fitting. Differences in optical densities (OD) were calculated at 1:16 dilution for the
commercial IgG assay and 1:128 dilutions for all IgM assays. Chi-squared or Fisher’s exact test
was used to analyze differences between symptomatic and recovered COVID-19 patients, and
Student’s T-test was used to analyze differences between these two groups’ age, anti-S1 and
anti-E IgM levels, and log10-transformed anti-S1-RBD IgG due to its non-normal distribution.
Duration of disease was available for 8/14 (57%) of mild patients, and only available values were
used for descriptive analysis.

Curve-fitting for relationships between antibody levels and time since symptom onset was
performed in GraphPad Prism 8.4.2 (San Diego, CA). For each antibody, linear regression was
compared against other higher order models (second- or third-order polynomial, and exponential
growth for anti-S1-SBD IgG in recovered cases) based on Akaike Information Criteria. Except
for anti-S1 IgM in hospitalized participants, linear functions provided better fit than more
complex models.

Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was first used to determine each
serological test’s ability to distinguish between symptomatic COVID-19 cases and 78 randomly
selected pre-2020 HC. Threshold values from these ROC curve analyses were tested in the
recovered cohort against 25 pre-2020 HC subjects. Given differences in the symptomatic and
recovered groups, we further performed 100-fold ROC curve analysis using either anti-S1-RBD
IgG or the product of anti-S1 and anti-E IgM. For each run, COVID-19 cases were randomly
assigned to the training or test set at 1:1 ratio, and pre-2020 HC cases were randomly assigned to

the training or test set at 2:1 ratio. Thresholds were automatically determined in the training set
to maximize accuracy while maintaining balance between sensitivity and specificity, and applied
to the test set to determine outcome sensitivity and specificity. Median threshold values from the
100-fold ROC curve analysis were used in the group of people with negative molecular testing.

Given the expected effect sizes, Bonferroni correction was used to adjust for multiple
comparisons.

Results
Compared to hospitalized cases, mild cases were younger (median age 31.5 vs. 61.5 years,
t(28)=3.593, p=0.001) and did not have any African Americans (0 vs. 72%, p<0.001). Compared
to pre-2020 HC participants, hospitalized cases had greater anti-S1-RBD IgG (log10 transformed
due to non-normal distribution, t(31.7)=10.816, p<0.001, Fig 1a), anti-S1 IgM (t(119)=5.129,
p<0.001, Fig 1b), and anti-E IgM (t(119)=4.121, p<0.001, Fig 1c). The same was true among
mild cases for anti-S1-RBD IgG (t(115)=4.042, p=0.001, Fig 1a), anti-S1 IgM (t(117)=6.967,
p<0.001, Fig 1b), and anti-E IgM (t(115)=3.872, p<0.001, Fig 1c) compared to pre-2020 HC
cases. Regression analysis showed women to have higher anti-S1 (F(1,128)=6.22, p=0.014) and
anti-E (F(1, 128)=7.08, p=0.009) IgM levels independent of COVID-19 status, but sex did not
influence IgG levels.

Using these hospitalized cases and 78 pre-2020 HC, ROC analysis showed anti-S1 IgG to have
AUC of 0.942 (95% CI 0.883-1.000; Fig 2a), with a cut-off of 0.89 OD associated with 88.9%
sensitivity and 92.3% specificity. However, this cut-off identified only four of 14 (28.6%) mild

participants, with the mild cases having much lower levels than hospitalized cases (0.71 vs. 1.77,
t(30)=4.261, p=0.0002, Fig 1a). Linear regression analysis (which better fit data than higher
order polynomials) of the cross-sectional cohorts showed the mild cases’ IgG levels to rise at the
same rate (slope 0.042, 95% CI: 0.009-0.075) as in the hospitalized cohort (slope 0.059, 95% CI:
0.008-0.110) but lagged the latter by 28 days. In contrast, neither anti-S1 IgM (t(30)=1.703,
p=0.099) nor anti-E IgM (t(30)=0.190, p=0.850) differed between mild and hospitalized cases,
although IgM levels had a downward trend with longer disease duration in the hospitalized cases.
Extrapolating the linear IgG (OD=1.04+0.059*days) and the second-order anti-S1 IgM
(OD=2.16-0.00348 * (days-12.2)-0.00699*(days-12.2)2) curves among hospitalized participants
showed a pre-symptomatic incubation period of 16 days vs. 5.6 days.

ROC analysis of anti-S1 IgM (AUC=0.852, 95% CI of 0.739-0.965) with a cut-off of 1.37 OD
was associated with sensitivity of 94.4%, specificity of 69.2%, and detection of 13/14 (92.8%)
mild participants; anti-E IgM (AUC=0.807, 95% CI of 0.707-0.907) with a cut-off of 2.00 OD
was associated with sensitivity of 66.7%, specificity of 79.5%, and detection of 9/14 (64.2%)
mild participants. Because anti-S1 IgM is more sensitive while anti-E IgM is more specific, we
multiplied the two IgM levels to achieve a balance between sensitivity and specificity (Table 2).

As an alternative to using a training cohort consisting of entirely hospitalized cases, we
performed 100-fold simulation using a training cohort of randomly selected COVID-19 and pre2020 HC participants (1:1 and 2:1 distribution between the training and test groups, Fig 2b).
This analysis showed – in the test groups – a median sensitivity and specificity of 82.1% and
86.0% for anti-S1 x anti-E IgM, vs. 82.4% and 76.5% for anti-S1-RBD IgG. The combined IgM

was more specific than IgG (t(189.95)=8.393, p<0.0001), but the two assays had similar
sensitivity (t(198)=0.669, p=0.504). Median thresholds of 3.58 OD2 and 0.31 OD identified
seven and six of the 13 (-) rRT-PCR participants as having positive serology, with four having
elevated levels of both. Taking into account days from symptom onset among those who
reported ILI symptoms (n=10), four had elevated IgM product and three of the four also had
elevated IgG levels.

Discussion
The diagnosis and sero-surveillance of COVID-19 can be challenging. While small numbers of
(+)rRT-PCR patients had high antibody titers against the S1 protein,6 patients who recovered –
the focus of any sero-survey – have not been systemically investigated. Here we show that a
serological assay with reactivity against the most commonly targeted antigen (S1-RBD) had high
sensitivity and specificity among hospitalized participants, but its sensitivity dramatically
diminished in participants with mild COVID-19 during the first month after symptom onset. The
lower anti-S1-RBD IgG levels may be related to milder severity, shorter disease duration, or
both. In contrast, IgM levels were more comparable between symptomatic and recovered
patients, although only more severe cases showed lower IgM levels with greater disease
duration. Because of the time-dependent variability in these antibody levels, the combined IgM
levels had greater specificity than IgG in detecting hospitalized and mild participants without
loss in sensitivity during the first month. Early IgM and IgG profiles should be tested for their
predictive value in distinguishing between severe (elevated IgM and IgG) and mild (elevated
IgM, normal IgG) outcomes in a prospective cohort.

A diagnostic algorithm using IgG levels trained on our hospitalized participants performed
poorly to detect those who had mild COVID-19. This is generally in keeping with results from
China showing low or medium-low neutralizing antibody titers in 47% of patients who recovered
from mild COVID-19,18 although it is difficult to interpret whether the neutralizing antibodies
identified represented IgM, IgG, or both. The slow rise in IgG levels has also been reported by
the UK National COVID Testing Scientific Advisory Panel using a novel assay against the
SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein,7 and was previously observed in SARS-CoV cases.19 The
longer persistence of IgM may then be a corollary of the slow IgG increases, with long-lived
antigen-induced plasma cells20 implicated in similar IgM persistence in other viral21,22 and nonviral23 infections. Questions remain regarding whether the hospitalized severe cases have a long
pre-symptomatic incubation period with slopes similar to their IgM and IgG profiles during the
symptomatic phase, with the extrapolated incubation period (5.6 days) from the IgM curve more
in keeping with current knowledge than the extrapolated value (14 days) from IgG. It also
remains to be seen whether mild cases’ IgM and IgG profiles would follow those of severe cases
months out from their symptomatic phase. Finally but importantly, the expected heterogeneity in
anti-S1-RBD IgG within hospitalized and mild cases needs detailed investigation as it may
account for differences in neutralization potential, total IgG levels, and disease severity.
Altogether, the two divergent temporal profiles of IgM and IgG suggested by our cross-sectional
studies need further confirmation from longitudinal within-individual studies whose results will
have significant implications in viral surveillance, post-exposure immunity, and vaccine
development.

These studies also highlight the importance of harmonizing serological testing methods and
findings among COVID-19 cohorts according to symptom onset and severity. Hospitalized
cohorts are often used for assay development because they had the greatest access to rRT-PCR
testing and, conversely, were most accessible to clinical researchers. The choice of serological
test can therefore underestimate past exposure to SARS-CoV-2, over-estimate immunity for
convalescent plasma,24 or influence the choice of point-of-care lateral flow assays in large serosurveillance studies.7 Until a gold standard better than rRT-PCR is confirmed, rapid
development of a standardized cohort (including clinically suspected COVID-19 with and
without rRT-PCR confirmation of various severity at multiple time points) with adequate
reference biofluid samples is urgently needed to empirically assess the performance of novel as
well as marketed serological tests.

While our study included repeated samples only in a few individuals and the overall cohort size
is limited, the broad cross-sectional inclusion both symptomatic and recovered patients provide
an overview of IgM and IgG profiles in COVID-19 relative to time since symptom onset. The
over-representation of African Americans in the more severely ill cohort may mediate some
differences in antibody profiles.25 Further work is also necessary to determine antibody levels, if
measured early in disease course, can adequately predict severity of disease. However, IgG
clearly has a role in confirming severe COVID-19 cases, and a commercially available option
such as the one we used can accelerate broad diagnostic testing independent of, or in addition to,
single-center efforts which are more difficult to standardize. Levels of IgM and IgG – against
multiple viral proteins or different configurations of the same protein – should also be routinely
measured during in vitro neutralization experiments and convalescent plasma trials. Finally,

because we found a complex relationship between antibody levels, disease severity, and time
since symptom onset, we urge extreme caution in using point-of-care or a single serologic assay
to inform public policies.

Figure Legends
Figure 1. Serological assay results of COVID-19 participants. Anti-S1-RBD IgG (a), anti-S1
IgM (b), and anti-E IgM (c) levels were analyzed in pre-2020 HC participants (gray circles),
hospitalized symptomatic COVID-19 participants with severe (black circles) or mild-tomoderate (red circles) disease, and COVID-19 participants who had recovered from mild selflimited disease (blue circles). Antibody levels for COVID-19 were plotted according to selfreported symptom onset. Thin lines between represent serial sampling from the same subject,
and thick lines with 95% confidence intervals represent best fit lines.

Figure 2. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis showing performance differences
between hospitalized and mild participants (a). 100-fold ROC curve analysis showed similar
sensitivity between anti-S1-RBD IgG and the combination IgM (product of anti-S1 and anti-E
IgM), but the latter has greater specificity (p<0.0001).
