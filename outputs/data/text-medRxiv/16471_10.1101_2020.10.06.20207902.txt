Abstract

diagnostics. Alternative sampling procedures that are less invasive and do not require a

healthcare professional would be

more preferable for patients and health professionals.

Saliva collection has been proposed as such a possible alternative sampling procedure. We

evaluated the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 testing on two different saliva collection devices

(spitting versus swabbing) compared to nasopharyngeal swabs in over 2500 individuals that

were either symptomatic or had high-risk contacts with infected individuals. We observed an

overall poor sensitivity in saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection (30.8% and 22.4% for spitting and

swabbing, respectively). However, when focusing on individuals with medium to high viral

Organization and (American and European) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with

nasopharyngeal swabs being considered the standard collection procedure. While extremely

sensitive, this sampling method is not patient-friendly and requires a healthcare professional

with personal protective equipment to collect. Before the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, several

studies have reported

on

the utility of saliva

for testing respiratory viruses

, these

studies suffer from one or more limitations, i.e. non-paired study design, small cohorts,

testing in biased populations such as previously confirmed positive cases and/or hospitalized

patients. Here, we set out to prospectively evaluate the utility of saliva for diagnostic testing

of SARS-CoV-2

using a

large

population of more than 2,500 individuals,

including pauci-

symptomatic and a-symptomatic participants, in triage centers in Belgium with matched

nasopharyngeal and saliva collection at the same moment. We evaluated 2 types of saliva

collection devices and all samples were analyzed by 2 independent laboratories.

The majority of study participants, 2289 individuals, was sampled with a nasopharyngeal

with a nasopharyngeal swab and the saliva swabbing device or spitting device, respectively.

While saliva sampling was generally perceived as more comfortable than nasopharyngeal

sampling (Supplemental Figure 2A), study participants scored the ease of use of the saliva

Saliva sampling identifies individuals with medium to high viral load
Out of 2884 nasopharyngeal swab samples analyzed by test lab 1, 117 (4.0%) were SARS-

CoV-2 positive. There were 107/117 nasopharyngeal positive samples for which a matching

saliva spitting sample was available, and 107/117 nasopharyngeal positive samples for which

a matching saliva swabbing sample was available. We observed 33/107 (sensitivity = 30.8%;

CI= 22.5%-40.6%) saliva spitting samples and 24/107 (sensitivity = 22.4%; CI=15.2%-31.7%)

Individuals with an E-gene Cq > 24.5 in the nasopharyngeal sample (corresponding to 56 000

copies/ml viral transport medium as determined by digital PCR and further referred to as

low viral load, see Materials and Methods) almost always presented with a negative saliva

sample (sensitivity = 1.4%; CI=0.07%-8.3% and sensitivity = 1.3%; CI=0.07%-8.0% in the saliva

spitting and saliva swabbing sample, respectively) (Figure 2). In contrast, for individuals with

a high viral load (E-gene Cq < 24.5 in the nasopharyngeal sample), concordance between the

nasopharyngeal and matching saliva sample improved dramatically, especially for the saliva

spitting device resulting in high sensitivity in this subgroup (sensitivity = 97.0%; CI=82.4%-

99.8%

and

sensitivity

76.7%;

between E-gene Cq-values in the nasopharyngeal and saliva samples for those individuals

with high viral load (spitting device: r = 0.53, p = 0.001; swabbing device: r = 0.54, p = 0.006;

Pearson). Notably, similar findings were observed in test lab 2 (Supplemental Figure 4).

To assess whether the poor sensitivity in saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection could be due to

sampling issues during saliva collection, we quantified the human gene RPS18 using RT-qPCR

on a representative set of RNA samples used for SARS-CoV-2 detection. No differences in

RPS18 levels were observed between saliva positive and negative samples for any of the

saliva sampling devices, suggesting that sampling issues do not explain the false negative

saliva samples (Supplemental Figure 5A-B).

We then evaluated whether there were study participants for whom the nasopharyngeal

sample was negative and at least one of the saliva samples positive. Test lab 1 identified 12

such cases while test lab 2 identified 8 cases (Supplemental Table 2 and 3). These cases were

mainly found among the saliva spitting samples (FPR, defined as the % saliva-positive that

are negative on the NP specimen = 26.7%; CI=15.1%-42.2% and FPR = 7.7%; CI=1.3%-26.6%

for saliva spitting and swabbing samples, respectively) and typically presented with very low

viral

loads (mean E-gene Cq saliva

spitting samples = 32.6). Of note, only 2 cases were

commonly identified by both test labs and these two cases were the only ones that were

positive for both the spitting and swabbing saliva device. To assess whether the negative

result in the nasopharyngeal sample was due to sampling issues, we also quantified RPS18

on a subset of these samples. Out of 4 SARS-CoV-2 negative nasopharyngeal samples (that

had a matching positive saliva sample), 1 showed extremely low levels of RPS18 (Cq > 35)

while the

3 had RPS18 Cq-values similar to

SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva is dependent of symptomatic status
For 2172 study participants, we were able to register presence or absence of symptoms for

COVID-19 (see Materials and Methods for clinical definition). From these, 1412 (65.0%) were

symptomatic, 705 (32.5%) were asymptomatic and 55 (2.5%) indicated they experienced

symptoms in the 2 weeks preceding the test. The latter group was excluded from further

analyses because of the limited number of subjects.

The fraction of subjects that were SARS-CoV-2 positive in the nasopharyngeal sample was

similar in the symptomatic and asymptomatic group, 4.67% and 4.96% respectively, however

the symptomatic group was enriched for cases with high viral load (E-gene Cq <24.5, p =

0.042, Fisher’s exact test). As a result, sensitivity in saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection was

higher

asymptomatic cases (sensitivity = 13.3%; CI=4.4%-31.6% for both the spitting and swabbing

device)

(Figure

Nevertheless,

(saliva spitting device: sensitivity = 100%; CI=78.1%-100% in symptomatic cases, sensitivity =

CI=51.9%-92.6% in symptomatic cases, sensitivity = 100%; CI=39.6%-100% in asymptomatic

cases).

include symptomatic patients (whether or not hospitalized) that are more likely to have a

were asked to first swab, then spit) could impact these results remains to be investigated.

Finally, other co-variates, including time of sampling and stage of infection at sampling may

also impact results. Additional studies are required in order to further investigate the impact

of these factors.

single problematic test batch.

Our study suggests that saliva sampling cannot replace the standard nasopharyngeal swab

for COVID-19 diagnostics. Nevertheless, because of its ease of use and compatibility with

self-sampling, saliva sampling could play a role in systematic screening campaigns that aim

to identify asymptomatic cases with medium to high viral loads. However, based on results

presented here, such screening campaigns would fail to identify low positives. Whether, and

Materials and Methods
Patient samples

Nasopharyngeal swabs were taken by a healthcare professional as a diagnostic test for SARS-

CoV-2, as part of the Belgian national testing platform. The individuals were tested in triage

centers, between June 2020 and July 2020. In parallel, saliva samples were collected using

Norgen Biotek’s Saliva RNA Collection and Preservation Device Dx #53800 (for collection of 2

ml of saliva through spitting), DNA Genotek’s ORAcollect RNA device # ORE-100 (for saliva

collection through swabbing), or both. Participants in the study were asked not to eat, drink,

smoke or use chewing gum in the last 30 minutes preceding saliva sampling. After sample

collection, a short survey was completed to enquire about age group, ease of use of both

saliva devices, comfort of saliva sampling versus nasopharyngeal sampling and symptomatic

status. To enquire about symptomatic status, we applied the case definition of Sciensano,

Power calculation

The sample size was computed for assessment of a hypothesis on non-inferior SARS-CoV-2

positivity on saliva compared to on nasopharyngeal specimen in paired testing as proposed

by Tang

13

, using target values from a systematic review

12

. We accepted a confidence of 95%,

a power of 80%, a sensitivity of the test in NP samples of 95%, a proportion of saliva-/NP+

samples 5% and 0.90 as benchmark for the relative positivity rate (saliva/NP), which yielded

84 SARS-CoV-2+ subjects needed.

These could be found in a study population of 841 to 8410

subjects assuming a prevalence of 1% to 10%.

Given the substantially larger contrast in test

positivity between saliva and NP specimens, study enrolment was stopped when reaching

2884 inclusions.

SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test lab 1

RNA extraction was performed using the Total RNA Purification Kit (Norgen Biotek #24300)

according to the manufacturer’s instructions using 200 µl viral transport medium (for the

nasopharyngeal swab, i.e. Zymo Research’s DNA/RNA Shield # R1100-250) or 200 µl saliva,

200 µl lysis buffer and 200 µl ethanol, with processing using a centrifuge (5810R with rotor

Six µl of RNA eluate was used as input for a 20 µl duplex RT-qPCR reaction in a CFX384 qPCR

instrument using 10 µl iTaq one-step RT-qPCR mastermix (Bio-Rad #1725141) according to

the manufacturer’s instructions, using 250 nM final concentration of primers and 400 nM of

were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies

using clean-room GMP production. For detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the Charité E gene

assay was used (FAM)

14

; for the internal control, a proprietary hydrolysis probe assay (HEX)

was used. Cq values were generated using the FastFinder software v3.300.5 (UgenTec). Only

batches were approved with a clean negative control and a positive control in the expected

range. Proper RNA extraction and RT-qPCR was confirmed by observing spike-in RNA signal

in each sample well in the expected range.

corresponds to 1500 copies per 6 µl RNA input. With an effective RNA elution volume of 45

µl and 200 µl transport medium used for RNA extraction, the low viral load Cq cut-off value

of 24.5 in test lab 1 roughly corresponds to 56 000 copies/ml viral transport medium.

Analytical platform compatibility testing

To validate compatibility of the workflows applied by test lab 1 and test lab 2, we created a

saliva validation panel by collecting saliva from 3 different healthy donors using both saliva

sampling devices. Donors did not eat or drink, smoke or use chewing gum for 30 minutes

prior to saliva collection. For each collection device, saliva samples from all three donors

were pooled and spiked with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus stock. More specifically, 50 µl of a

2.4-fold, 76.8-fold and 2457.6-fold dilution was added to 1950 µl of pooled saliva. A negative

control saliva sample was generated by adding 50 µl of water. Saliva samples were aliquoted

and processed by both test labs.
