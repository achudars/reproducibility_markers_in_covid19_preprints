Abstract. We describe a time dependent stochastic dynamic model in discrete time for
the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in various states of USA. The proposed multicompartment model is expressed through a system of difference equations that describe
their temporal dynamics. Various compartments in our model is connected to the social
distancing measures and diagnostic testing rates. A nonparametric estimation strategy is employed for obtaining estimates of interpretable temporally static and dynamic
epidemiological rate parameters. The confidence bands of the parameters are obtained
using a residual bootstrap procedure. A key feature of the methodology is its ability to
estimate latent compartments such as the trajectory of the number of asymptomatic but
infected individuals which are the key vectors of COVID-19 spread. The nature of the
disease dynamics is further quantified by the proposed epidemiological markers, which
use estimates of such key latent compartments.

INFERENCE ON COVID-19 DYNAMICS

1. Introduction

The novel coronavirus has been ravaging the world since early 2020. First identified
in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, the epidemic has since spread to every corner of the
world. As of January 25, 2021 [1], more than 99 million people have been infected, out
of which more than 2.1 million have died of the disease. The World Health Organization
declared the situation a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Since then various parts of the world
have gone through multiple waves surges in the number of new infections. The pandemic
has severely affected the world economy. Repeated lockdowns, travel restrictions, and
other measures of containment have severely impacted the economy of many countries,
stretched healthcare systems to the extreme, and caused mental health crisis for large
chunks of the populations.
The new pathogen (SARS-CoV-2) which causes the disease [2] is mostly unknown in
terms of its infectivity and clinical profile. It is well-known that the infection primarily
spreads through infected but asymptomatic people. The number of such people remains
unknown. The reported number is based on symptomatic or positively tested persons,
which grossly underestimates of the true value. Because of the undetermined denominator effect, important epidemiological markers like the death rate, hospitalisation rate etc
remains non-determinable from the observed data. Various estimates [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] of these
markers have been postulated by many authors. Mathematical modelling and quantification of the epidemiological parameters [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] of the pandemic have been
crucial in understanding and interpreting the transmission dynamics from the perspective
of public health researchers and policymakers around the globe [14, 15, 16, 17].
A number of popular compartmental epidemiological models e.g. SIR, SEIR, SIRD etc.
have been employed to describe the dynamics of COVID-19 [18, 19, 20, 21]. Such models
yield estimates of epidemilogical markers such as the basic reproduction number (R0 ), and

various doubling and case fatality rates that are indicators of the disease growth pattern

[22, 23]. Prediction of epidemiological characteristics and transmission patterns in this
context have also attracted major attention [24, 25, 26, 27]. Advanced statistical methods
have been employed in forecasting the number of cases worldwide [28] or quantifying the
effects of prevention mechanisms like social distancing [29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34], public
gathering, and travel restrictions [35, 36, 37] for various countries. Due to the difference
in analytical methods and assumptions, the parameter estimates describing COVID-19
dynamics vary widely. This variability is also reflected in the estimates of the effectiveness
of public health interventions implemented worldwide. Most epidemiological models of
disease transmission are simplistic and use time-invariant transmission rates. However,
in reality, due to mitigation efforts and the evolving nature of the infection mechanism,
such rates become temporally dynamic. Furthermore, most SIER-type models exclude
the effects of testing and subsequent quarantining, and occasionally, even hospitalization.
Such practices fail to adequately account for the size of the susceptible population and
therefore tend to provide unreliable estimates of the number of asymptomatic persons
infected by COVID-19 in the population.
We propose a detailed discrete time semiparametric stochastic dynamic model for
COVID-19 spread. The model is expressed through a system of difference equations
connecting various interpretable compartments in the disease dynamics such as individuals who are susceptible, asymptomatic but infected, quarantined, hospitalized, dead and
have recovered from the disease. We introduce interpretable time-varying parameters to
reflect various temporally dynamic rates. Our model also includes available information
on the number of tests. On the other hand, the proposed model does not make restrictive
and often untestable distributional assumptions about compartments or parameters that
are commonplace in various probablistic models for the epidemiological dynamics.

INFERENCE ON COVID-19 DYNAMICS

We employ nonlinear nonparametric regression techniques through a profiling based es-

timation procedure to estimate the model parameters and the number of people in different
compartments. Using residual bootstrap based techniques, we also provide point-wise confidence intervals (bands) for the time-invariant (time-varying) parameters. The proposed
model and estimation procedure relies on linear kernel weighting and fairly low dimensional optimization, thus avoiding Markov Chain Monte Carlo and other computationally
expensive methods employed by Bayesian inference schemes for standard epidemiological
models. Therefore, the estimates can be obtained almost instantaneously. Another key
feature of our method is the ability of identifying and estimating unobservable quantities
such as the actual number of asymptomatic but infected people at any given time. The
estimated trajectory of the infected but asymptomatic population over time, its doubling
rate, the true case fatality rate, and an analogue of the basic reproduction rate are crucial
in interpreting the time-dynamics of the pandemic. They have important implications for
policy decisions regarding appropriate mitigation strategies.

2. A Multi-compartment Model for Disease Spread
We consider a closed population without emmigration or immigration and propose a
model for the Covid-19 pandemic spread in terms of various observable and partially or
totally unobservable compartments.
Suppose at time t, Ct , Dt , Tt , respectively, denote the number of confirmed cases,
number of deaths due to the disease and the number of tests performed up to time t.
These variables are non-decreasing cumulative counts and are generally fully observed.
The number of hospitalised persons due to Covid-19 infection at time t (denoted Ht ) is
also generally observed (see Section 3.2 for more detail). Furthermore, we observe Qt , the

number of asymptomatic individuals who are in quarantine at time t. These individuals
have been tested positive, but show no significant symptoms requiring hospitalisation.
The most crucial unobserved compartment is At , i.e. the number of infected but asymptomatic individuals at time t. It is well known that the people in this group are primary
spreaders of the disease. Furthermore, due to under-reporting, the number of confirmed

cases would be a fraction of At . Since we do not observe how many in the population are
currently infected, the number of susceptible individuals at time t, (denoted St ) is also
unobserved.
The number of recovered individuals (denoted Rt ) up to time t can be partially observed. To understand this, note that the recoveries from quarantine centres and hospitals, (denoted RtQ and RtH respectively) are reported, though not necessarily separately
(see Supplement Section S2., for the case when RtQ and RtH are reported separately).
But since At is unobserved, the number of asymptomatic but infected people who recover
without being quarantined or hospitalised (denoted RtA ) cannot be observed. That is,
even though Rtreported = RtQ + RtH is available from the data, the total recovery Rt is not.
The proposed disease propagation model are based of the following assumptions:

A1 Only an asymptomatic individual who is not either in quarantine or in hospital
can transmit the disease to a susceptible individual.
A2 People who recover from the disease are immune from subsequent infection.
A3 False positive rate for the test is negligible, so that if somebody is confirmed to be
positive, then he/she is assumed to be infected.
A4 Anybody who shows significant symptoms, whether being in quarantine or not, is
immediately hospitalized, and is tested to be positive.

A5 There is no effective treatment regime for the asymptomatic individuals, and so
they recover or turn symptomatic at the same rate regardless of whether they are
tested positive (and hence quarantined) or not.
A graphical representation of the proposed disease propagation model is presented in

Figure 1 below. The assumptions A1-A5 are quite general and concur to the observed
dynamics of Covid-19 pandemic so far, even though a relatively tiny fraction of people
do get infected by prolonged exposure to symptomatic patients, typically in hospitals.
However, this small violation of assumption A1 is unlikely to have a significant influence
on the overall dynamics, and in any case, the requisite data to account for this violation
is practically unavailable. The number of reported reinfection after recovery is negligible,
so are the false positive rates of both RTPCR and antigen tests (estimated to be less
than 5% [38, 39, 40, 41]). If necessary, the assumptions A2 and A3 can be generalised
by adding a fraction of the recovered people in the susceptible category. Assumption A5
implies that the rate of transfer from compartment At to RtA is same as that of transfer
from the compartments Qt to RtQ and the rate of transfer from the compartments At and
Qt to Ht are equal.

2.1. Disease Propagation Model. We assume an underlying Poisson process model
for describing the disease dynamics. Let ∆Ct = Ct+1 − Ct be the increments in the
number of observed confirmed cases in day t + 1. The increments ∆At , etc. are defined
similarly. Under our model, conditionally on the current values of different compartments
(collectively denoted by Ft ), the above increments follow Poisson distributions with their
mean depending on Ft and a set of rate parameter. Based on our assumptions, the
evolution model are expressed as follows:

INFERENCE ON COVID-19 DYNAMICS

A schematic diagram of the proposed model can be found in Figure 1. All parameters

in the proposed model are nonnegative. The parameter α is the baseline infection rate, in
the absence of any social distancing. This means, α is the average number of susceptible
individuals who may be infected on any given day by an asymptomatic but infected
individual. The rate of daily recovery directly from the asymptomatic compartment is
denoted by ρA . By assumption A5, this is also the daily rate at which a quarantined
individual directly recovers. We use γ to describe the rate at which an asymptomatic
individual may become symptomatic on a given day. By assumption A5, this rate is
the same whether the individual is free or in quarantine. The symbols, ρH (t) and δ(t),
respectively, denote is the rate at which people recover and die from the hospitalized
compartment. We assume both these rates to be time-varying to reflect the changing levels
of effectiveness of treatment regimes over time. We emphasize that Poisson distributions
for the increments of various compartments is only a working assumption which guides
our estimation strategy (e.g., by formulating appropriate transformations of variables).
In Supplement Sections S6. and S7., we carry out a detailed numerical simulation under
the Poisson model to validate the statistical performance of the proposed estimation
procedure.
Information about daily tests is included in the model using the function θ(t). We call
it the confirmed fraction (CF), i.e. the fraction of currently asymptomatic individuals
who are detected through testing. Parameter θ(t) would depend on the daily number
of tests, as well as the efficiency of the testing strategy in identifying the infected and
asymptomatic individuals. The contact tracing strategies were introduced by many states
[42, 43] with varying success. In many parts of the world, people in close contact of
hospitalised patients are routinely tested. This strategy is closely connected to cluster
sampling, where a cluster is defined by the contacts of a hospitalised person.

Guided by the above consideration, we reformulate the parameter θ(t) by expressing it
as follows:
(8)

θ(t) = φ(t)

∆Tt
,
Ht

where φ(t) is interpreted as the testing efficiency (TE) since it measures the fraction of
confirmed asymptomatic cases per test, per (currently) hospitalized patient. In Section 5
we estimate φ(t) by minimising certain loss function, from which θ(t) is subsequently
estimated.
In addition, our model (see (1)) depends on a variable κt , which is the current state
of the level of interaction among individuals. Expressed as a fraction, taking value 1 for
normal activity, and 0 for complete lockdown, this variable measures the prevalent social
distancing in the population. In general κt is not observable. However, often a surrogate
variable based on data collected by internet service providers such as Google from the
usage of smartphones [44] can be used [45, 46, 47].
From (1) the variable ακ2t approximately measures the daily rate at which a susceptible
individual turns asymptomatic-infected. In the early stage of the epidemic, the fraction
St /(St +At +Rt ) ≈ 1. Furthermore, rather than waiting for herd immunity to be achieved,
mitigation measures are implemented in most affected places or countries to contain the
spread of the disease. As a consequence, at any given time, the number of non-susceptible
people is much lower as compared to the susceptible population. So St /(St + At + Rt ) has
remained quite close to 1 for almost the duration of the pandemic until this point, due to
the absence of mass-scale vaccination.
Notice that (5), provides a connection between the daily reported confirmed cases
∆Ct and the number of asymptomatic-infected individuals At in the population. In our
model, an asymptomatic-infected person can be discovered either through a positive test

and subsequent quarantining, or through hospitalisation upon showing severe symptoms.
Therefore, once the estimates of θ(t) and γ are available, equation(5) allows us to estimate
the unknown At from the observed Ct . It is also clear that, due to unavoidable severe
under-reporting, ∆Ct will only be a fraction of the number of total infected individuals
at any time point.

2.2. Some relevant epidemiological markers. The proposed model is more realistic
than the traditional SIR, SEIR etc. models and allows us to estimate different epidemiological markers which can measure the dynamics of disease spread. Our focus here is on
estimating epidemiological markers related to the number of asymptomatic but infected
persons (i.e. At ) in the population. It is well-known that the disease is mostly spread
through persons in that group. Thus the proposed epidemiological markers reveal more
fundamental trends of disease dynamics, than what can be obtained only by the confirmed
case counts. In particular, we define the following epidemiological markers:

2.2.1. Relative Change in Confirmed Fraction (RCCF). The relative change in confirmed
fraction measures the change in the fraction of currently asymptomatic-infected individuals who are caught in the quarantine net through testing relative to the total fraction
of currently infected individuals are either quarantined or hospitalised. From Section 2.1
we get:
(9)

RCCF (t) =

∆θ(t)
.
θ(t) + γ

The marker RCCF (t) measures the dynamics of the efficacy of the testing regime to
isolate the asymptomatic but infected individuals from the population into quarantine.
From (8), this marker is directly controlled by the prevalent testing strategy and efficiency.

2.2.2. Crude infection rate (CIR) and Net Infection Rate (NIR). The crude infection rate
is defined as the fraction of change in the daily confirmed cases on a day to the number
of confirmed cases on that day. In our notation, it follows that:
(10)

CIR(t) =

∆2 Ct
.
∆Ct

Since CIR suffers from the under-representation inherent in the reported number of confirmed cases, we define a model-based estimate for the infection rate, denoted Net Infection
Rate (NIR), which is the ratio of the daily change in the number of asymptomatic-infected
persons to the number of the asymptomatic-infected persons. In our notation:
(11)

N IR(t) =

∆At
CIR(t) − RCCF (t)
=
.
At
1 + RCCF (t)

2.2.3. Daily New Infections (NI). From our model and assumptions, the daily number of
new infections are given by the number of susceptible population who turn asymptomaticinfected on that day. From (1) we define this marker as:
(12)

N I(t) =

ακ2t



St
St + At + Rt


At .

The cumulative number of new infections up to time t can be defined as CN I(t) =
Pt
i=1 N I(i).

2.2.4. Doubling Times and Rates: The doubling time at time t, denoted td (t) measures
how much longer it would take for the number of infected upto time t to double. The
˜ is given by the inverse of the doubling time. A higher doubling
doubling rate at time t, ξ(t)
rate reflects the faster spread of infection. This rate is often used to measure the effect of
social distancing campaigns, improved hygiene and case tracking.

similarly.

2.2.5. Crude and Net Case Fatality Rates. In general a case fatality rate at time t is given
by the ratio of the total death count and the total case count at that time. Depending on
whether the reported case counts or the actual case counts are used, we can define two
different case fatality rates. The crude case fatality rate (CFR) is defined as:
(13)

CF R(t) =

2.2.6. The Basic Reproduction Rate. In the conventional SIR or SIER models, basic reproduction rate (R0 ), which measures the expected number of cases directly generated by
one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection [48] is used to
determine the nature and rate of growth of the pandemic. Unlike these models, our model
is more detailed and allows for time varying parameters and as a result, the conventional
R0 cannot be directly estimated from our model. The closest epidemiological quantity we
can observe is the background infection rate, α, measuring the average number of susceptible individuals who may be infected on any given day by an asymptomatic but infected
individual. However, by following the next generation method [49, 50] an analogue of the
basic reproduction rate for the compartment At can be computed.

By focusing on the compartment At , under our assumptions from (2) new infections
arrive at the compartment at the rate of ακ2t St /(St + At + Rt ) and leave at the rate of
(θ(t) + γ + ρA ). There is no other pathway for disease spread. Thus we can define an
analogue of the basic reproduction rate as:
(15)

ακ2t
R̃0 (t) =
θ(t) + γ + ρA



St
St + At + Rt


.

Note that, the proposed R̃0 (t) can be interpreted in the same way as the conventional basic
reproduction rate. By construction R̃0 (t) < 1 indicates negative growth of the number of
asymptomatic-infected persons, whereas R̃0 (t) > 1 indicates its positive growth. However,
temporal variation of R̃0 (t) is more complex. Assuming that, St /(St +At +Rt ) ≈ 1, R̃0 can
decrease with time either due to reduction in κt , that is the current state of interaction
among individuals, or due to an increase in the confirmed fraction θ(t). That is, the
proposed R̃0 (t) is directly influenced by the mitigation efforts such as social distancing,
adherence to use of masks, increased testing and subsequent quarantining, hospitalisation
of symptomatic patients etc.
Most epidemiological models such as SIR, SIER etc., assume fixed doubling rate parameters. In reality, however, the doubling time is a dynamic quantity, which changes continuously due to mitigation efforts and the inherently changing nature of virus-spreading
mechanisms. It is then vital that policymakers and researchers have access to frequent and
up-to-date estimates of doubling time [51]. For example, [52] provided early, fixed-in-time
estimates of epidemic parameters of COVID-19 (e.g. growth rate, doubling time, basic
reproduction number, case detection rate) during the first 50 days of onset in China. In
recent work [53, 54] the basic reproduction number and doubling time have been studied
in a dynamic manner by considering a varying coefficient model with daily new cases

3. Results : Application to COVID-19 data from the USA
3.1. Data Preparation. We consider the dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 in various states of USA for a tentative time window of late April to mid December. The
proposed model is based on the observed state-wise daily counts of confirmed infections, deaths, hospitalisations and reported recoveries from the hospitals and quarantining facilities.

Daily counts of the confirmed COVID-19 cases in various states

were obtained from the COVID-19 Data Repository maintained by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. This is publicly
available at https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 and was accessed on December 15, 2020. The state-wise daily counts of positive and negative COVID-19 test
results, current hospitalization, and recovery per day and state, were obtained from
the CDC data repository -the COVID Tracking Project and are publicly available at
https://COVIDtracking.com/ (accessed on December 15, 2020.)
The collected noisy data used is pre-processed and cleaned, removing the irregularities present in the recording and maintenance of the data repositories. Any missing or
evidently wrong (e.g. negative counts) observations were replaced by the average of the
data from adjacent five days. Inherent noise present in the daily counts was removed by
pre-smoothing the trajectories using a Lowess method [56, 57, 58, 59] with bandwidth
1/16.
3.2. Results. Unfortunately, a continuous record on hospitalization and recovery information were not available for many states. For example, most counties in California are
not reporting recovery information. Data on Hospitalization is found to be updated once

the hospitalization information only after the initial surge of the pandemic was over for
the state. In our analysis we only consider the states for which daily observations on Ct ,
Dt , Rtreported , Qt , and Ht are available throughout the time window under consideration.
Any missing/negative values are replaced by the average of the adjacent five days’ data.
For a few states e.g. Alabama, the available data turned out to be too unreliable. We
present results for fifteen states in US which demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
model and the estimation methods. For succinct representation, the results from only one
state i.e. Utah is presented in details below. The results for other fourteen states can be
found in the Supplement Section S9.

window between 7th May, 2020 to 4th December, 2020. The time interval includes the
Thanksgiving weekend (27th -28th November, 2020), when due to the long holiday, the
reported data may be unreliable. In Figure 2 plots of various time-varying compartments
and epidemiological markers defined in Section 2.2. The plots of the parameters with
their residual bootstrap confidence intervals can be found in Figure 4. Due to unreliable
reporting around the Thanksgiving holiday, the estimates values after 21st November,
2020 should be interpreted with caution.
The curves in Figure 2(a) compare the observed and the fitted number of daily number
of people in the hospitals. It can be seen that, the fitted values obtained from the model
closely follow the observed values. This validates our proposed model and the estimation
procedure. From the data and the fit two waves of infection can be identified. It seems
the first wave starts at the end of May, 2020 stabilises and begins to die down around 7th
August, 2020. The daily number of people in hospitals starts increasing again around the
end of August, 2020.

The estimated number of infected asymptomatic people (Figure 2(d)) shows a similar
pattern. From a high point around the beginning of August it dips to a low value at
the end of August. The number remains stable for a few weeks and starts growing again
at the end of September. The two waves can also be clearly observed from the plot
of the proposed analogue of the basic reproduction rate R̃0 in Figure 2(i). In the time
period under consideration, the estimated R̃0 was larger than one in two sub-intervals,
namely from middle May to middle of July and then from end of August to beginning
of November. The plot of the number of daily new and daily reported infections (Figure
2(e)) shows a local maxima near the middle of November. However, we cannot rule out
the boundary effect as its cause.
The plots of CIR and NIR seem to be similar (Figure 2(f)). In fact, the observed
doubling rate obtained from Ct and that estimated from CN I seems to be very close in
the second wave of the pandemic (see Figure 2(h)). This implies that in the second wave
the reporting kept pace with the spread of the disease. Figure 2(g) shows the crude and
net fatality rates. Due to the denominator effect, naturally the crude fatality rate is much
faster than the net fatality rate. However, our estimate of NFR is mostly below 0.25%,
which complies with widely held beliefs [60, 24, 61, 62].

The estimate of δ(t) in Figure 4(d) seems to remain stable throughout the time period

under consideration. The ρc
H (t) shows an overall increasing trend. On the other hand,
The estimate of θ(t) decreases to a near zero value at the end of the first wave (7th
August, 2020) it then increases to its maximum value at the end of September and starts
to decrease again. The parameters (γ, ρA ) are estimated based on minimization of the
profile loss using a grid search algorithm with grid size 0.0001. In Figures 4(a) and 4(b)
the estimates from residual bootstrap samples take discrete values, resulting in a discrete
histogram counts.
The daily number of tests and its effect in quarantining asymptomatic but infected
people can be judged from the Figures 2(b) and 2(c). The state of Utah increased its
testing capacity by public-private partnership. Empirical comparison of the Figures 2(a)
and 2(b) seems to reveal that although the number of daily tests could keep pace with
daily number of hospitalised patients up to the third week of September, but growing
number of hospitalised people ultimately outpaced the number of daily tests. Note that,
estimated θ(t) increases at the onset of the second wave (see Figure 4(c) between 7th,
August and 21st, September), however, from figure 2(d), Ât remains more or less constant.
Thus, growth in the number of new infections could be due to the increase in κt , that is
due to more interaction among individuals and less social distancing.

0.1 in Delaware, Tennessee and Utah. It is lowest in Texas. This can be associated with
better estimates obtained for these states due to the availability of more reliable data,
whereas for Idaho, South Dakota, and Texas, a lower value of there epi-markers tend to
give evidence for a more relaxed testing paradigm. More testing is required for isolating
the confirmed cases to contain the disease faster, which can be reflected in the numbers
for these states. The detailed results and bootstrap confidence regions for these additional
states can be found in the Supplement Section S9.
Among the states not included in Table 2, many, such as California did not report all
the required compartments. For many states such Alabama, Colorado, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Carolina etc. the reported data produced monotone profile likelihoods
which yielded unreliable boundary estimates. This could be due to the change in definition
of many compartments over time, which violated our assumptions. Furthermore, for some
states such as New York, New Jersey, Michigan etc., the pandemic started quite early and
ran its course even before a proper testing protocol and other mitigation measures could

be introduced. Thus the data from these states is contaminated with an inherent bias, the

number of people in quarantine or symptomatic states are to too low to produce reliable
estimates.

4. Discussion
We introduce a multi-compartment model for COVID-19 dynamics which can incorporate data from compartments like quarantine, hospitalisation etc. Unlike the conventional
SIR and similar models, the proposed model is based on interpretable time-varying parameters, which are more suitable for describing the disease dynamics in the presence of
mitigating procedures. It also incorporates the information about testing and subsequent
quarantining. We estimate the model parameters using profile likelihood and nonparametric regression. This provides a much faster alternative to Markov Chain Monte Carlo
based Bayesian models which are commonly used in estimating SIR parameters. Using
the proposed detailed and robust model one can estimate the daily number of asymptomatic but infected individuals, who are universally regarded as the key agent for the
COVID-19 spread. We define several epidemiological markers which uses the number of
asymptomatic-infected individuals and therefore reveal the true underlying dynamics of
the pandemic.
Our model only uses information on the number of confirmed infected, hospitalised,
deaths and total reported recoveries from hospitals and the quarantine. We don’t require
those numbers separately. However, such numbers are often available. In such a case, the
loss function in (21) can be simplified a bit. The details can be found in the Supplement
in Section S2.
The model parameters have been estimated assuming that no information about the
mobility within the population is available. Such information identifies the parameters

κt and α in our model. Reliable data on the compliance to social distancing, mask
wearing etc. are difficult to get. Various aspects of the mobility data available from
Google can be one potential surrogate for κt [63, 64]. However, such data only look into
the fraction of people going to workplace or recreation and so on, and does not collect
information on the people who are the super spreaders or not wearing masks. Thus, it
does not necessarily reflect the the social mobility index κt , as incorporated in our model.
In the Supplement (see Sections S3. and S9.), we present results by using the Google
mobility data as a surrogate to κt . In particular, information on the change in the mobility
patterns, as the percentage decrease (increase) from the baseline, in different areas such
as parks, residential locations, retail locations, among others during the pandemic from
the Google mobility database were obtained. The publicly available data was sourced
from https://www.google.com/COVID19/mobility/ (accessed on December 15, 2020).
When information on κt is available, the parameter α, which is the average number
of susceptible individuals who may be infected in a day by an asymptomatic-infected
individual is identifiable and can be estimated. The details can be found in the Supplement
Section S3.
The proposed method and estimation procedure do not explicitly use the underlying
assumption of a Poisson process. In the Supplement (see Section S6.− S8.), however, we
use an ensemble of independent Poisson processes to simulate data from the proposed
model. These aggregated data sets are then used to accurately estimate various parameters, which validate our estimation procedure. The aggregation has the effect of increasing
the number of observations in the compartments and thereby improving estimation accuracy. If the number of individuals in the symptomatic or quarantined compartments are
low, e.g. at the onset of the pandemic, inherent biases are introduced in the estimated
trajectories. A bigger sample size is required to correct such contaminants.

Inference on COVID-19 dynamics

It should be noted that COVID-19 analyses based on published case and death counts,
including those conducted here, are subject to the same biases which affect the accuracy
of the data, primarily due to under-reporting [65] or mis-recording of the data, the degree
of which varies by country [66]. The reasons for such under-reporting are many, including

insufficient testing materials, political incentives, and administrative delays. Furthermore,
our model assumes a closed population. It ignores migration between cities, states or
countries which play an essential role in the propagation of the disease. We only count
the deaths solely due to Covid-19 infections and as such completely ignore any competing
causes of morbidity, as well as increase in population due to new births.
With this caveat in mind, the study of available data presented in this article nevertheless provides useful insights into the COVID-19 propagation and ways to control it. It
clearly follows that in order to break the chain of transmission and “flatten the curve”,
we need extensive testing and adhere to strict social distancing protocols.

5. Methods : Parameter and compartment Estimation
The core of our estimation strategy is to utilize (1)–(7) to formulate appropriate regression problems. Our estimation procedure is based on the availability of the compartments
Ct , Dt , Ht , Qt , Tt and Rtreported only. We do not assume that data on the social distancing
factor κt is available. Described crudely, the proposed estimation method uses local regression (linear or nonlinear) methods for estimating the time-varying parameters, while
profiling over the time-independent ones.
In the absence of data on κt , the parameter α in (1) is not identifiable. We first describe
how the product ακ2t can be estimated. Notice that, ignoring the stochasticity, we may
rewrite (5) as
(16)

∆Ct = (θ(t) + γ)At .

Defining η(t) = θ(t) + γ, and applying the difference operator on both sides of (16), and
finally dividing both sides by ∆Ct , we obtain

Now, ignoring the second order factor (∆η(t)∆At )/(η(t)At ), from (2), at the onset of the
epidemic (i.e. St /(St + At + Rt ) ≈ 1), we have the approximate relationship:
(18)

∆2 Ct

≈

Note that (18) establishes an approximate linear relationship, between the observable
quantity ∆2 Ct /∆Ct and the product ακ2t . Below we show that, the other parameters in
(18) can be estimated, from the available data. These estimates can be plugged in to get
an estimate of ακ2t .

5.1. Point Estimates. Broadly speaking, the estimation strategy consists of separating
the time-dependent and time-independent parameters, into vectors βt = (φ(t), ρH (t), δ(t))
and ζ = (γ, ρA ) respectively. First the vector ζ is kept fixed and for each t the time
dependent parameter βt is estimated (denoted βbth (ζ)) by minimizing the “conditional”
eht (βt |ζ) (described below) with respect to βt , subject to appropriate
local loss function L
constraints on the parameters (non-negativity as well as certain upper bounds). The
optimal local conditional loss is then combined across different time points to obtain the
profile loss function for ζ, which is given by
(19)

In order to define the conditional loss function, let K(·) be a nonnegative kernel inte-

Note that the RHS of (21) only uses the observed data. The first addendum originates
from equations (4), (5) and (6). The second and the third term use equations (6) and
(4) respectively. The square-root transformation of the responses are used as a variance
stabilising transformation, which is driven by the assumed Poissonian characteristics of
the responses. Also by construction, the estimate of δ(t) does not depend on ζ.
Estimated values of the parameters readily yields estimates of the key compartments
of the model. In particular, from the definition of θ(t), (16) and (17) we get:

The rest of the compartments can be estimated by plugging in the appropriate parameter
or compartment estimates in equations (1) - (7) (see the Supplement Sections S1. and
S3.).
The tuning parameter h in (20) is obtained by minimising a standardised L1 distance
between the fitted and model based estimates of various compartments through a crossvalidation strategy. The actual minimisation is achieved by a grid-search. Details can be
found in the Supplement Sections S1. and S2.
5.2. Confidence Intervals. We employ residual bootstrap [67, 68, 69] to compute the
confidence intervals for our parameter and compartment estimates. Briefly put, the technique adds resampled residuals to the fitted values to create several “resampled” datasets.
The point estimation technique described above is applied to each of these resampled
datasets to create a new set of parameter and compartment estimates. The empirical
distribution of these estimates are then used to construct the confidence interval. The
details of the algorithm can be found in the Supplement Section S5. The theoretical
validity of the residual bootstrap method is well justified in existing literature [70, 71].
