ABSTRACT

21

Viral pathogen can rapidly evolve, adapt to novel hosts and evade human immunity. The

22

early detection of emerging viral pathogens through biosurveillance coupled with rapid and

23

accurate diagnostics are required to mitigate global pandemics. However, RNA viruses can mutate

24

rapidly, hampering biosurveillance and diagnostic efforts. Here, we present a novel computational

25

approach called FEVER (Fast Evaluation of Viral Emerging Risks) to design assays that

26

simultaneously accomplish: 1) broad-coverage biosurveillance of an entire class of viruses, 2)

27

accurate diagnosis of an outbreak strain, and 3) mutation typing to detect variants of public health

28

importance. We demonstrate the application of FEVER to generate assays to simultaneously 1)

29

detect sarbecoviruses for biosurveillance; 2) diagnose infections specifically caused by severe

30

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); and 3) perform rapid mutation typing

31

of the D614G SARS-CoV-2 spike variant associated with increased pathogen transmissibility.

32

These FEVER assays had a high in silico recall (predicted positive) up to 99.7% of 525,708 SARS-

33

CoV-2 sequences analyzed and displayed sensitivities and specificities as high as 92.4% and 100%

34

respectively when validated in 100 clinical samples. The D614G SARS-CoV-2 spike mutation

35

PCR test was able to identify the single nucleotide identity at position 23,403 in the viral genome

36

of 96.6% SARS-CoV-2 positive samples without the need for sequencing. This study demonstrates

37

the utility of FEVER to design assays for biosurveillance, diagnostics, and mutation typing to

38

rapidly detect, track, and mitigate future outbreaks and pandemics caused by emerging viruses.

INTRODUCTION

40

In the last decade, several RNA viruses have emerged from animal reservoirs to threaten

41

global public health (1). These viruses include influenza A in 2009 (2), Ebola in 2013 (3),

42

Chikungunya in 2014 (4), Zika in 2015 (5), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

43

(SARS-CoV-2) most recently in 2019 (6, 7). Outbreaks and pandemics often occur when a

44

zoonotic viral strain evolves and escapes human immunity (8, 9). The early detection of these

45

pathogens is required to minimize outbreaks and prevent pandemics by guiding early interventions

46

(10). However, RNA viruses mutate rapidly, so biosurveillance tools must be able to detect groups

47

of viral pathogens with diverse genome sequences and emerging variants, often requiring time-

48

consuming and expensive procedures performed by trained personnel that are not easily accessible

49

in all regions of the world (11, 12). Once spillover occurs and a viral isolate enters human

50

circulation, a rapid and accurate diagnostic test is required to circumvent its spread (13-16).

51

However, development of accurate diagnostics at the onset of an outbreak can be challenging due

52

to limited data availability depending on the location of the outbreak, and the process for validation

53

and implementation of a new test can also be time-consuming (17). Having a broadly applicable

54

computational approach to assay design that can accommodate pathogen emergence and variant

55

evolution would help alleviate some of these challenges.

56

Coronaviruses are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses and a leading cause of the

57

common cold (18). However, several recent coronavirus outbreaks, including SARS-CoV in 2002-

58

2003, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, were associated

59

with significant morbidity and mortality (8, 19, 20). In December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 emerged in

60

humans and spread rapidly, resulting in the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) global

61

pandemic (21-23). SARS-CoV-2, along with SARS-CoV and SARS-like viruses, belong to the

62

subgenus Sarbecovirus (24). Effective diagnostic and biosurveillance assays are critical to control

63

the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and prevent future Sarbecovirus pandemics.

64

Real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) is considered the gold standard for

65

COVID-19 diagnostics (25) with assays developed by the United States Centers for Disease

66

Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC) (26), China CDC (27), Hong Kong University (28), and

67

Charité Institute of Virology (29), along with commercial products (30). Traditionally, RT-PCR

68

probe and primer design involved selecting a target from a specific gene, often a virulence factor

69

(31). In contrast, modern probe and primer design involves multiple sequence alignments and

70

algorithms to determine conserved signatures for detection (32-34). However, if assays are not

71

updated periodically to account for variants, genome mutations can emerge at the primer or probe

72

binding site and limit assay utility (35, 36). The U.S. CDC initially designed a pan-Sarbecovirus

73

assay targeting the nucleocapsid gene (2019-nCoV_N3) with broad coverage, however it

74

eliminated this assay from its diagnostic panel to simplify the testing process (37) and because of

75

cross-reactivity (38) and false-negative results on clinical samples (39). Also, mutations at either

76

a primer or probe binding site (not specified because of proprietary components) yielded false-

77

negative results for the Roche cobas envelope gene pan-Sarbecovirus assay (36). Finally,

78

mutations have made SARS-CoV-2 more transmissible (40, 41) and potentially more resistant to

79

immunity induced by vaccination (42). The current practice of independently introducing

80

biosurveillance efforts, targeted diagnostics and mutation tracking has hampered our ability to

81

adapt and respond to the dynamic challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. The

82

development of a synchronous approach to integrate these data streams can help mitigate the

83

challenges posed by emerging viral pathogens and support rapid decision making to help combat

84

future outbreaks and pandemics.

85

There is a critical need for tools that can be used in biosurveillance and diagnostic

86

applications to respond rapidly to emerging pathogens and mitigate their global impact (43). To

87

this end, we have developed FEVER (Fast Evaluation of Viral Emerging Risks), a computational

88

approach that can generate both high-coverage or strain-specific diagnostic assays so that the same

89

detection platform can be used for both broad-based biosurveillance and targeted diagnostic

90

applications. Here, we demonstrate the applicability of FEVER for simultaneous biosurveillance

91

of pan-Sarbecoviruses and targeted diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 100 human patients.

92

We also demonstrate mutation typing of the D614G SARS-CoV-2 spike variant using this

93

approach as an example of a rapid method for tailored surveillance of pathogen evolution and

94

emergence.

Ethics. This study was designed in alignment with DOE, NIH, and universal HIPAA

97

guidelines. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Los

98

Alamos National Laboratory (LANL#000473), per DOE guidelines and policies, and by the

99

Presbyterian Institutional Review Board (PHS IRB#1608836).

FEVER surveillance and diagnostic probe and primer design. For the surveillance and

102

diagnostics FEVER assays, four sets of primers and probes were generated (Table 1). Two sets of

103

primers and probes were developed for universal detection of all sarbecoviruses, with one targeting

104

the 5’ untranslated region (UTR) termed FEVER_5’UTR and another targeting the envelope gene

105

termed FEVER_Env. Another two sets of primers and probes were developed for specific

106

detection of SARS-CoV-2, with one targeting the ORF1ab region termed FEVER_ORF1ab and

107

one targeting the spike gene called FEVER_Spike. After the FEVER probes were designed,

108

primers flanking the probes were created by the PrimerDesign-M tool (44, 45) using an alignment

109

of SARS-CoV-2 sequences.

Sequence data. As of March 10, 2020 the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data

112

(GISAID) database (https://www.epicov.org

or https://www.gisaid.org/) had acquired 338

113

complete, or near-complete, high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. After aligning the

114

sequences and eliminating all but one of each set of sequences which were 100% identical to each

115

other to reduce redundancy, our data set consisted of 19 unique sequences of SARS-CoV-2. We

116

also collected all coronaviruses from GenBank that were in the “Sarbecovirus clade” of the beta

117

coronaviruses, using BLAST searches rather than GenBank taxonomy because many

118

sarbecoviruses were listed as “unclassified coronavirus” in the taxonomy table. Again, we reduced

119

redundancy be eliminating identical sequences (primarily many dozens of SARS sequences from

120

the 2003-2004 outbreak), and retained a set of 67 genome sequences. It was these 86 Sarbecovirus

121

genomes that were used to design our assays.

122

FEVER algorithm. The FEVER algorithm does not require sequence alignments prior to

123

probe design. Instead, our probe design goal was to produce a short nucleotide sequence (called a

124

“k-mer”, e.g., a short DNA sequence, k base pairs long) that binds to SARS-CoV-2 without binding

125

to background material that may be present in a sample that is being tested. Specific desirable

126

properties of the probe included maintaining a high GC-content and reducing the hairpin

127

propensity (i.e., the tendency of the probe string to fold over on itself) by ensuring that any self-

128

complementary pairs of sub-strings in the probe are sufficiently short. The mathematical

129

formalization of the problem was expressed in terms of a constrained optimization, with minimum

130

GC-content and the maximum length of self-complementary sub-strings taken as constraints while

131

maximizing coverage. A probe is said to "cover" a SARS-CoV-2 sequence if the probe’s k-mer

132

appears as a sub-sequence of that sequence. Thus, coverage is defined as the number of sequences

133

in the database covered by the probe. "Exact" coverage corresponds to an exact match of probe

134

and sub-sequence. Hamming distance between two strings is defined as the number of characters

135

that would have to be changed in one string to agree with the other string. Given a database of

136

SARS-CoV-2 sequences, the single probe design problem is to find a string of length k, subject to

137

the constraints of GC-content and hairpin aversion, that covers as many SARS-CoV-2 sequences

138

as possible. For the multi-probe design problem, we seek n probes instead of just one, and a n-

139

probe design is said to cover a SARS-CoV-2 sequence if any one of the probes covers it. The

140

selection of k=31 was used because of practical considerations for molecular beacon synthesis

141

allowing for a 12 bp stem region (6 bp on each side of the k-mer). Also, k=31 was long enough to

142

bind to target sequences in the SARS-CoV-2 database without accidentally covering potential

143

background sequences.

144

Our FEVER algorithm works by extracting all k-mers from each of the sequences in the

145

database and then restricting consideration to those that exhibit a minimal GC-content and hairpin

146

aversion. For every one of these k-mers, we counted how many viral sequences were covered,

147

being careful not to count a sequence twice even if the k-mer appears twice in it. Finally, we

148

selected the k-mer with the largest count. To ensure that our probes were not susceptible to viral

149

mutation, a multi-probe design approach was applied. The first probe was designed using a naïve

150

approach by producing the optimal probe with highest coverage of the queried sequence

151

database. The next probe is designed by eliminating the viral sequences covered by the first probe

152

and using this truncated database to find the single probe that best covers the remaining viral

153

sequences. This process is repeated until 100% of the database is covered. For both pan-

154

Sarbecovirus sequences and SARS-CoV-2 sequences it only took 2 probes to obtain 100%

155

coverage of the sequence database at the time of design.

FEVER mutation typing probe and primer design. A variant carrying the amino acid

160

change D614G spike mutation became globally dominant, and the G614 variant has been

161

demonstrated to have a fitness advantage associated with higher viral loads (40). A custom

162

TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay was designed (Thermo Fisher, 4332075) to detect this single

163

nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in SARS-CoV-2 using Thermo Fisher Scientific’s Custom Assay

Design Tool. Probe and primer sequences are presented in Table 1.

166

Analysis of primer and probe coverage. The FEVER biosurveillance and diagnostics

167

assays were computationally characterized using two complementary methods. First, the

168

frequency of SARS-CoV-2 variants in the amplified region of the FEVER and U.S. CDC assays

169

were assessed visually using the Variant Visualizer, which is under development and will be

170

available at https://cov.lanl.gov. Second, we used an in silico validation tool (46) to assess the

171

inclusivity of the FEVER assays compared with the U.S. CDC N1 and N2 assays (26). Each assay

172

(forward primer, reverse primer and TaqMan probe) was evaluated against each SARS-CoV-2

173

sequence from GISAID (47) public database that was greater than 29 kb (n = 525,708) to ensure

174

only complete genomes were assessed. The GISAID sequence data used in this analysis was

175

accessed on February 15, 2021. Results are presented in Table 2. For this analysis, a false-negative

176

was assigned if one or more assay oligonucleotides satisfied any of the following conditions: (i)

177

three or more mismatches to a target sequence, (ii) a predicted melting temperature less than 40°C

178

between the oligonucleotide and a target sequence, or (iii) when primer/target mismatches

more in the cycle threshold (CT) value (as defined previously (48)). True-positives were assigned

for any assay/target sequence pairing that did not result in a false negative. Results are also reported

as the number of genome sequences that contained perfect matches, single mismatches, two

mismatches, or three or more mismatches for a given assay.

RT-PCR protocol. Samples were tested using our FEVER and U.S. CDC 2019-novel

200

coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RT-PCR diagnostic panel (termed U.S. CDC assays) (26). For the U.S.

201

CDC N1 (2019-nCoV_N1) and N2 (2019-nCoV_N2) assays, each 20 µL reaction consisted of 8.5

202

µL of water, 1.5 µL of combined primer and probe mix (IDT, 500 nM primer and 125 nM probe,

203

final concentrations), 5 µL of TaqPath 1-step RT-qPCR master mix (Thermo Fisher), and 5 µL of

204

the template. For the FEVER assays (FEVER_5’UTR, FEVER_Env, FEVER_ORF1ab, and

205

FEVER_Spike), each 20 µL reaction consisted of 8 µL of water, 2 µL of combined primer and

206

probe mix (IDT, 500 nM primer and 250 nM probe, final concentrations), 5 µL of TaqPath 1-step

207

RT-qPCR master mix, and 5 µL of the template. The thermocycling conditions were the same for

208

all assays. Thermocycling conditions using an ABI StepOnePlus or 7500 Fast Dx were 25°C for 2

209

min, 50°C for 15 min, 95°C for 2 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 3 s and 55°C for 30 s.

210

For RT-PCR assays, samples were considered positive when the CT value ≤40. Patient clinical

211

samples were considered positive for SARS-CoV-2 when the two U.S. CDC assays N1 and N2

212

both had a CT value ≤40, and negative when both targets had a CT value >40 according to CDC

213

guidelines (37). If only one N1 or N2 result was positive, the result was considered inconclusive

214

and the sample was re-run. If the re-test results were also inconclusive, the final result was reported

215

as inconclusive.

resources. We tested 5 µL of undiluted genomic RNA preparation from SARS-CoV Urbani (NR-

220

52346), avian coronavirus Massachusetts (NR-49096), alphacoronavirus Purdue P115 (NR-

221

48571), porcine respiratory coronavirus ISU-1 (NR-48572), two influenza A viruses (NR-20080

222

and NR-20081), and two influenza B viruses (NR-45848 and NR-45849). RNA from heat-

223

inactivated SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 (BEI Resources, NR-52347) was a positive

224

assay control, and water was a negative assay control.

225
226

Analytical sensitivity. The analytical sensitivity of each assay was determined by spiking

227

inactivated SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain (BEI resources, NR-52286) at 104 copies/µL,

228

and 10-fold serial dilutions were performed in an NP swab matrix. NP swabs from a single human

229

donor (Lee Biosolutions, #991-31-NC-COVID-N) were suspended in 0.45% saline and confirmed

230

SARS-CoV-2 negative by the supplier. Each concentration was tested using three biological

231

replicates.

232
233

Assessment of NP swab samples. The 100 NP swab samples were transported to the

234

laboratory for RNA extraction and testing. After RNA extraction, samples were stored at –80°C.

235

Samples were tested by our FEVER and U.S. CDC assays for SARS-CoV-2. For the U.S. CDC

236

assays, the 2019-Ncov plasmid (IDT) containing the nucleocapsid gene was used as a positive

237

control, and water was used as a negative control. For the FEVER assays, RNA from heat-

238

inactivated SARS-CoV-2, isolate USA-WA1/2020 (BEI Resources, NR-52347) was used as a

239

positive control, and water was used as a negative control. The RNase P assay described by the

240

U.S. CDC assays (26) was used as an extraction control for each sample.

Mutation typing of SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. Extracted RNA (10 µL) from SARS-CoV-2

243

positive patient samples was reverse transcribed in a 20 µL reaction using the High Capacity cDNA

244

Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher, 4368814) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

245

Each 20 µL SNP genotyping PCR reaction consisted of 5 µL of cDNA as the template, 4.5 µL of

246

water, 0.5 µL of 40× SNP genotyping mix (900 nM primer and 200 nM probe final concentrations),

247

and 10 µL of 2× TaqMan Genotyping Master Mix (Thermo Fisher, 4371353). Amplification was

248

performed using an ABI StepOnePlus RT-PCR machine under the following conditions: 10 min

249

at 95°C and 45 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and 60 s at 60°C in a 96-well plate. The PCR CT values

250

corresponding with the wild type (VIC) and mutant (FAM) forms were compared, and the lower

251

value (≤45) of the two was determined to be the SNP sequence. Samples were considered

252

undetermined when both reactions had a CT value >45. Control RNA from Heat-Inactivated

253

SARS-CoV-2, isolate USA-WA1/2020 (BEI Resources, NR-52347) was used as a positive

254

control, diluted to 104 copies/µL, and run with each batch of cDNA synthesis and PCR. Isolate

255

USA-WA1/2020 contains the wild-type spike sequence, and all results with this control showed

256

that the wild-type CT was lower than the mutant CT value (data not shown).

257

A total of 17 NP swab samples had sufficient sample volume to be used in sequencing to

258

confirm the D614G mutation. The spike gene was amplified using the 23403F_seq and

262

0.5 µL of 10 mM dNTPs, 1.25 µL of each primer (0.5 µM final concentration), and 0.25 µL of Q5

263

hot start high-fidelity DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs). PCR was performed on a

264

RESULTS

274

FEVER Computational Tool. FEVER combines probes and primers generated to 1)

275

broadly identify an entire class of virus; 2) specifically detect a strain of interest; and 3) detect

276

SNPs of importance to public health. The computational approach starts with a curated multiple

277

sequence alignment. The FEVER algorithm does not however require sequences to be aligned in

278

order to generate assays. The alignment was performed to avoid overrepresentation of any single

279

isolate and ensure broad coverage of the pathogen of interest. In March of 2020, we developed two

280

alignments using the sequences available in GISAID: one with SARS-CoV-2 sequences and one

281

with Sarbecovirus sequences. Of note our FEVER assays were developed within one month of the

282

U.S. CDC assays (41) and also used viral sequence information obtained from GenBank. Next,

283

our FEVER algorithm was applied to design probes using the Sarbecovirus alignment for

284

biosurveillance and the SARS-CoV-2 alignment for diagnostics while also screening the results

285

using parameters set for GC-content, hairpin propensity, and match recall to achieve high coverage

286

as well as reagent manufacturing and performance compatibility. The FEVER algorithm identifies

287

sets of probes that cover 100% of each multiple sequence alignment. Two pan-Sarbecoviruses

288

(FEVER_5’UTR and FEVER_Env) and two SARS-CoV-2 (FEVER_ORF1ab and FEVER_Spike)

289

specific probes were needed to detect all input sequences. After the FEVER probes were designed,

290

primers flanking the probe sites were designed using the PrimerDesign-M tool (44, 45) for use in

291

RT-PCR assays (Table 1). Few variants were visually detected in the region of amplification of

292

these primers and probes (Fig. S1). Further, we designed TaqMan SNP Genotyping PCR probes

293

and primers to detect the previously identified A23403G (D614G amino acid change) mutation in

294

the spike gene (40) (Table 1). Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome conferring a fitness

295

advantage have been reported (40). However, rapid methods to characterize SARS-CoV-2

296

mutations are lacking. Together, the primers and probes for all three components (biosurveillance,

297

diagnostics, and mutation typing) are referred to collectively as the FEVER assays.

298
299

In silico inclusivity test. We evaluated our FEVER assays using a public web-based

300

validation tool against 525,708 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 (46). The in silico evaluation only

301

included complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences that were at least 29 kb long. In general, a

302

low number of predicted failures (false-negatives) was observed in comparison with the number

303

of successes or true-positives (total of perfect matches, single mismatch, and double mismatches)

304

(Table 2). Recall (true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives) was used

305

to assess relative assay performance. Of the FEVER and U.S. CDC assays, the SARS-CoV-2

306

specific FEVER probe targeting ORF1ab had the best-predicted performance with a recall of

307

99.7%. The pan-Sarbecovirus probe targeting the 5’ UTR and envelope gene were also predicted

308

to be highly inclusive for SARS-CoV-2 with recalls of 96.4% and 98.6%, respectively. In contrast,

309

the SARS-CoV-2 specific probe targeting the spike gene had a 90.5% recall, suggesting that the

310

spike gene is a suboptimal target due to its high genetic variability (40, 49). For instance, the U.S.

311

CDC N1 assay had a recall of 99.0% and the U.S. CDC N2 assay had a 99.2% recall. Compared

312

with the U.S. CDC assays, the FEVER_ORF1ab assay had a ~1% higher recall, FEVER_Env had

313

a similar recall, and the FEVER_5’UTR and FEVER_Spike assays had lower recall values.

314
315

Analytical specificity. Cross-reactivity of primers and probes with other microorganisms

316

can reduce the efficacy of RT-PCR (50). For analysis of specificity, SARS-CoV-2 was the only

317

target virus for the SARS-CoV-2 specific assays, and all sarbecoviruses were considered the

318

targets for the pan-Sarbecovirus probes. We initially evaluated cross-reactivity in silico and then

319

experimentally with non-target viruses. The specificity of each primer and probe set was tested in

320

silico using BLAST, which yielded matches to SARS-CoV-2 only for the assay oligonucleotides

321

specific to SARS-CoV-2 (FEVER_ORF1ab and FEVER_Spike) and matches to sarbecoviruses

322

for the pan-Sarbecovirus assay oligonucleotides (FEVER_5’UTR and FEVER_Env). No hits to

323

human DNA or other respiratory viruses were found.

324

For experimental evaluation of specificity, the FEVER assays were tested against three

325

animal coronavirus strains (alphacoronavirus 1 strain Purdue P115, avian coronavirus strain

326

Massachusetts, and porcine respiratory coronavirus strain ISU-1), four influenza virus strains

327

(A/Brisbane/59/2007, A/Brisbane/10/2007, B/Nevada/03/2011, and B/Texas/06/2011), and a

328

single strain of SARS-CoV (Urbani, isolated in 2003). The SARS-CoV-2 strain USA-WA1/2020

329

was used as a positive control. The three animal coronavirus and four influenza virus strains all

330

tested negative (Table 3). Excluding SARS-CoV-2, the SARS-CoV Urbani strain was the only

331

commercially available genomic RNA from a Sarbecovirus available at the time of testing. The

332

SARS-CoV Urbani strain was correctly tested negative by the U.S. CDC assays (N1 and N2),

333

FEVER_ORF1ab, and FEVER_Spike targets. The SARS-CoV strain Urbani tested positive by the

Analytical sensitivity in a NP swab matrix. The analytical sensitivity and reproducibility

340

of each assay was tested using standard curves generated by three biological replicates of 10-fold

341

serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 spiked into human NP swab samples. The standard curves for RT-

342

PCR in NP swab samples had correlation coefficients (efficiency values) of 0.98 (100.9%) for

343

FEVER_5’UTR, 0.99 (93.7%) for FEVER_Env, 0.99 (96.5%) for FEVER_ORF1ab, 0.99 (98.0%)

for FEVER_Spike, 0.99 (103.2%) for N1, and 0.99 (99.1%) for N2, respectively (Fig. 1). We

swabs currently remain the reference sample type and support sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-

353

2 (55). Nasopharyngeal swabs from 100 COVID-19 patients were collected in New Mexico, U.S.

354

All assays were run under the same thermocycling conditions as per the U.S. CDC protocol (26).

355

All samples tested positive for the human RNase P gene used as a control to ensure success of the

356

RNA extraction ad associated sample collection methods (Table S1). Of the 100 NP swab samples,

357

66% (66/100) were considered positive according to the U.S. CDC assays and testing criteria (37),

358

22 were negative and 12 samples yielded inconclusive results (Table 4). Samples that initially

359

produced an inconclusive result were re-tested and the 12 that remained inconclusive following

360

the second test were removed from the analysis of agreement, sensitivity, and specificity. We

361

compared the four FEVER assays to the results obtained with the U.S. CDC assays and found that

362

all four FEVER assays displayed 100% specificity (no false positives were detected) and varying

363

sensitivities ranging from 74.2% to 92.4% (Table 4, Table S1). However, the U.S. CDC assays

364

were performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory,

while the FEVER assay was performed in a separate facility on a different thermocycler for

368

To directly compare the performance of the FEVER and U.S. CDC assays, 10 samples that

369

contained sufficient remaining RNA were analyzed using both groups of assays on the same ABI

370

StepOnePlus thermocycler in the same laboratory to avoid inter-instrument and inter-laboratory

371

variability. The CT values of the FEVER assays were plotted against those from the U.S. CDC

372

assay (Fig. 2). In general, a broad range of CT values from 13 to 39 was observed. Interestingly,

373

one sample that originally tested positive for the U.S. CDC assay (N2) with a CT value of 34 on

374

the ABI 7500 Fast Dx, tested negative on the ABI StepOnePlus. There was a significant (P <

375

0.001), correlation between the CT values of all four FEVER assays compared with each of the

376

U.S. CDC N1 and N2 assays indicating that when run on the same instrument the FEVER and U.S.

377

CDC assays yield highly similar CT values (Fig. 2). It is unfortunate that this finding occurred after

378

most of the patient samples were exhausted and so not all could be re-tested using the same

379

instrument. These results highlight the importance of using the same instrument when comparing

380

CT values for assay validation.

D614G mutation typing. High-throughput tracking of SARS-CoV-2 mutations in patient

samples may be essential for monitoring the spread of vaccine escape mutants (42). Sequencing

384

can identify novel variants but is too expensive and time-consuming for high-throughput screening

385

of patient samples to track the spread and movement of these variants on a global scale (40). To

386

facilitate a rapid and high-throughput method for monitoring the spread of SNPs of interest, we

387

have incorporated a SNP Genotyping PCR assay. For this mutation typing test, we are detecting

388

the A23403G (D614G amino acid change) mutation in the spike gene, which is associated with

389

greater infectivity (40) (Table 1). Control RNA from isolate USA-WA1/2020 (BEI Resources,

390

for D614 (data not shown). Of the 59 SARS-CoV-2 positive patient samples (according to the

392

FEVER assays), we determined the SNP at position 23,403 for 57 (96.6%) samples. The G23403

393

variant was found in 57 samples and 2 samples were undetermined with a CT cutoff of 45 (Table

394

S2). A fragment of the spike gene was amplified, and the A23403G SNP was confirmed in a subset

395

of samples (n=17) by sequencing (Table S3). These results indicate that most (57/59) patient

396

isolates contained the mutated G614 form of SARS-CoV-2 that became prevalent globally in April

397

2020 (40).

DISCUSSION

400

Early detection of emerging pathogens is required to mitigate outbreaks and prevent

401

pandemics (10). Assays used for diagnosing infections are often used for biosurveillance; however,

402

due to their high specificity, they are not usually suited for broad-spectrum surveillance

403

applications or capable of identifying pathogen mutations (43, 56). Therefore, the user must often

404

decide between either obtaining diagnostics or biosurveillance information but not both. FEVER

405

(Fast Evaluation of Viral Emerging Risks) is a computational approach designed to simultaneously

406

facilitate broad-spectrum biosurveillance, pathogen-specific diagnostics, and SNP variant tracking

407

for pandemic response to any viral pathogen of interest. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the

408

application of FEVER to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as an initial proof-of-concept. As a

409

proof of concept, we present FEVER assays to detect all sarbecoviruses for future biosurveillance,

410

SARS-CoV-2 for strain-specific diagnostics, and the D614G spike variant SNP mutation

411

associated with increased transmissibility.

412

Here, we used an RT-PCR format to evaluate the performance of the FEVER assays as

413

compared to the U.S. CDC assays. The success of RT-PCR as a diagnostic approach relies heavily

414

on the design quality of the primers and probes (57-59) as well as factors such as probe format,

415

the ability to incorporate degenerate nucleotides, the number of target genomes that can be

416

included in the design process to account for genetic diversity, and the ability to avoid cross-

417

reactivity with near-neighbor genomes (60). In the case of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, it is also

418

important that assays are able to differentiate infections caused by other common coronaviruses,

419

in which case a false positive could result in unnecessary and costly mitigation procedures (61).

420

For this reason, the U.S. CDC designed its N3 pan-Sarbecovirus assay; however, it was

421

unfortunately removed from their assay in March of 2020 in order to expedite reagent

422

manufacturing, consequently removing the biosurveillance component of the U.S. CDC COVID-

423

19 assay (35, 37). This situation highlights the urgent need for a computational approach that can

424

develop both biosurveillance and diagnostics assays that are screened for potential design issues

425

that may potentially affect their performance and manufacturing.

426

Current probe design methods are also limited by over-representing single isolates in a

427

sequence database as indicated by high coverage in silico but assay failure when novel variants

428

emerge (31). In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the high number of false-negative results reported

429

highlights the need for screening and updating assay designs as sequences become available (62-

430

64), which has been a primary goal of https://cov.lanl.gov. Mutations in the probe or primer

431

binding sites are particularly problematics since these can lead to false-negative results and

432

infected individuals may continue to spread the disease (65). Pandemic preparedness requires a

433

balanced approach combining targeted diagnostics assays designed to detect a specific outbreak

434

strain with high-coverage biosurveillance assays that can account for pathogen mutation, and

435

ideally this approach can be utilized to detect a variety of viral pathogens including those that are

436

highly mutagenic. FEVER was designed to fill this void. In the case of SARS CoV-2, our assays

437

were developed within a month of the U.S. CDC assays also using publicly available sequence

438

data, but with a different computational approach in mind. The U.S. CDC designed highly specific

439

diagnostics assays by pre-selecting a single genomic target, the viral nucleocapsid gene, aligned a

440

reference SARS-CoV-2 sequence (GenBank accession no. MN908947), and selected probe/primer

441

sets with low similarity to other coronavirus sequences in GenBank (37). This method has yielded

442

two SARS-CoV-2 specific assays that have contributed to combatting the current pandemic,

443

however it is unclear how useful these assays will be in detecting the next coronavirus outbreak.

444

FEVER takes a more comprehensive approach to design robust multi-purpose assays to

445

detect circulating viral strains and track their mutations but also to detect entire classes of viral

446

pathogens in order to monitor emerging threats. The FEVER algorithm scans the entire viral

447

genome to identify conserved regions and identifies the lowest possible number of probes

448

necessary to cover all sequences scanned. The diagnostics probe FEVER_ORF1ab displayed the

449

highest coverage of SARS-CoV-2 sequences in this study with a predicted recall of 99.7%. It was

450

predicted to detect all but 1,454 SARS-CoV-2 sequences out of 525,708 deposited in GISAID as

451

of February 15, 2021. In comparison, the U.S. CDC N2 probe displayed 99.17% coverage and was

452

predicted to fail in 4,353 sequences, which is nearly a 3-fold increase in false-negative results.

453

In addition to optimized sequence analysis, FEVER incorporates physical constraints set

454

by the user to include GC-content, hairpin propensity, sequence length, and even mismatch

455

tolerance. This ensures that probes selected for testing are thermodynamically compatible for

456

increased assay performance as well as future multiplexing. It is critical that assay sensitivity is

457

optimized as a 10-fold increase in the limit of detection for SARS-CoV-2 has shown to result in

458

an increase in the false-negative rate by 13% (66). Here, the limit of detection for both the FEVER

459

and U.S. CDC assays in NP swab samples was 1 copy/µL which matches previously published

460

findings (26). Additionally, FEVER assay design features can be used to ensure that probes and

461

primers are suitable for large-scale manufacturing and can be tailored to a variety of biosensing

462

platforms, including but not limited to RT-PCR. There is a clear need for the development of rapid

463

and accurate point-of-care diagnostic tools to detect viral infections (67), and a variety of nucleic

464

acid-based viral biosensors are in development for this purpose (43).

465

FEVER also includes a method for rapid mutation typing to track viral variants of public

466

health importance. SARS-CoV-2 has proofreading mechanisms (68) and therefore relatively lower

467

genetic diversity than other respiratory viruses such as influenza (69). For SARS-CoV-2, the

468

predicted evolutionary rate is approximately 8×10-4 nucleotide substitution per site per year (69).

469

The spike gene is under immune selective pressure as neutralizing antibodies against the protein

470

product can inhibit viral entry into host cells (40, 70). SARS-CoV-2 acquired the D614G mutation

471

in the spike protein early in the pandemic, and this mutation confers greater infectivity (71-73).

472

Previously, the detection of this mutation has been based solely on viral sequencing, which is time-

473

consuming and cost-prohibitive in many resource limited regions of the world (40, 61, 74, 75).

474

FEVER incorporates a rapid PCR-based method for identifying the D614G mutation directly in

475

patient samples. Similarly, mutation typing probes and primers can be designed in the future to

476

track other variants of interest including the U.K. (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351), and Brazil

477

(P.1) variants (41, 76, 77) to provide insight and real-time biosurveillance data on the circulation

478

of potential vaccine escape variants.

479

In summary, the FEVER computational approach provides a novel tool to combat emerging

480

viral pathogens. FEVER can be used for simultaneous biosurveillance of viruses, diagnostics of

481

outbreak or pandemic isolates, and mutation typing to rapidly track the spread of variants

482

impacting public health. In addition to PCR, FEVER can generate probes that are compatible with

483

a wide variety of nucleic acid sensing techniques which may be more suitable to point-of-care

484

testing than RT-PCR (43). Here we show that the FEVER assays are comparable to those designed

485

by the U.S. CDC for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 while simultaneously developing pan-

486

Sarbecovirus assays for future biosurveillance applications. Additionally, FEVER mutation typing

487

assays provide a rapid means for monitoring the spread of potential vaccine escape variants that

488

may significantly impact a population. Future work will focus on applying FEVER towards the

489

development of assays for the detection of other upper respiratory pathogens including influenza

490

as well as testing FEVER probes in ultra-sensitive amplification-free nucleic acid biosensing

491

platforms. FEVER provides a holistic computational approach to combine biosurveillance and

492

diagnostics in order to better combat emerging viral pathogens.
