Abstract
Background
There has been great concern amongst clinicians and patients that immunomodulatory treatments
for IBD may increase risk of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility or progression to severe disease.
Methods
Sera from 640 patients attending for maintenance infliximab or vedolizumab infusions between April and
June 2020 at the John Radcliffe Hospital (Oxford, UK) and Royal London Hospital (London, UK) were
tested using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. Demographic and clinical data were collated from
electronic patient records and research databases.
Results
Seropositivity rates of 3.0% (12/404), 7.2% (13/180), and 12.5% (7/56) were found in the Oxford and
London adult IBD cohorts and London paediatric IBD cohorts respectively. Seroprevalence rates in the
Oxford adult IBD cohort were lower than that seen in non-patient facing health-care workers within the
same hospital (7.2%). Seroprevalence rates of the London paediatric IBD cohort were comparable to a
contemporary healthy cohort collected at the same hospital (54/396, 13.6%).

Conclusions
SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity rates are not elevated in patients with IBD receiving maintenance infliximab or
vedolizumab infusions. There is no rationale based on these data for elective interruption of maintenance
therapy, and we recommend continuation of maintenance therapy. These data do not address the
efficacy of vaccination in these patients.

Introduction
The management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients treated with biological therapies
targeting the immune system has been a key concern throughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Early
guidance from the UK government on self-isolation (“shielding”) to patients who were
immunocompromised through disease or therapy, was based on expert opinion rather than evidence(1).
Elective withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy was not advised due to the associated risks of IBD
relapse.
Evidence is now emerging to clarify this issue, defining the risk of immunomodulatory treatments on
SARS-CoV-2 acquisition and disease course(2). Outcomes in patients with IBD who acquire COVID-19 have
been reported by the SECURE-IBD registry(3). These data suggest relative safety of anti-cytokine
monotherapy and complement seroprevalence data from Germany which reached provocative
conclusions suggesting that patients on anti-cytokine therapy might have reduced susceptibility to SARSCoV-2(4). In this study, we analyse the SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence in patients with IBD receiving
systemic anti-TNF therapy (infliximab) or gut-selective immunomodulation with vedolizumab in two UK
tertiary IBD centres during the first wave of incidence.

Methods
Patient recruitment: In total, 640 patients with IBD receiving maintenance infliximab or vedolizumab
infusions at the John Radcliffe Hospital (Oxford) and Royal London Hospital, RLH (London) between 20th
April - 26th June 2020 were included. Adult (180) and paediatric (56) patients were included from
London. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from electronic patient records and IBD databases
(Supplementary Table 1). Key differences between the Oxford and London adult cohorts included
ethnicity, smoking, comorbidities, disease type, concomitant thiopurines and biologic; in our dataset,
London had significantly greater evidence for deprivation than Oxford (Deprivation score 4(3-6.3) vs. 8(69.3),p<0.001).
SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection: Sera from all patients were tested using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay
and Architect i2000SR system, by staff in Oxford. Samples were interpreted as positive according to the
manufacturer’s cut off value of ≥1.4(5).
Statistical analyses: Analysis was performed in R (v3.6). Univariable analysis was performed with Fisher’s
exact test for binary variables, and logistic regression for all other variables. Uncorrected P values are
given. Odds ratios for univariable logistic regression are given with calculated CIs. Seroprevalence data
were compared with available data from healthy healthcare workers (HCW) in Oxford(6) and from a PHE
seroprevalence study in unselected paediatric patients at RLH.

Results
No increase in overall SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in patients with IBD on biologics compared to controls:
12/404(3.0%) patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Oxford. A higher seroprevalence rate
was reported from London patients, 13/180 (7.2%) for adults p≤0.0001 and 7/56(12.5%) for children
(Table 1). Seroprevalence rates in IBD cohorts were lower than their local healthy controls.
Seroprevalence in all Oxford Health Care Workers (HCW , 11.2%) and in non-patient facing HCW (7.2%)(6)
were higher (p<0.0001 and p<0.0017 respectively). Seroprevalence rates of the London paediatric control
group were comparable at 13.6% (54/396, median age 13.0 yrs.(8.1-16.0), male sex 49%).
We also analysed clinical and demographic characteristics of the entire cohort in order to identify any
associations of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. There were no associations with baseline characteristics,

including ethnicity, or deprivation status. In Oxford, a trend toward lower seropositivity was observed in
patients on infliximab vs. vedolizumab (1.1% vs. 4.4%); only 2 anti-TNF treated patients were seropositive
(Table 1). These trends were not observed in adults or children in London. Concomitant budesonide or 5ASA use were associated with higher seropositivity rates, although statistical significance was not
reached.

Discussion
We present the results of the first UK data on SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in patients with IBD on
biologics at the height of the UK pandemic. We report an overall adult seroprevalence of 3.0% and 7.2%
in Oxford and London respectively. We also present the first data on a UK paediatric IBD cohort, with a
seroprevalence of 12.5%. The differences between centres are consistent with published adult
seroprevalence data at the time of our study. The UK Biobank SARS-CoV-2 Serology Study reported a
seroprevalence of 6.6% (5.6-7.6%) in the South East (Oxfordshire) and 10.4% (9.6%-11.2%) in London.
Coupled with our local control data (7.2%-Oxford, 13.6%-London (Paediatric)), we demonstrate no
increase in seropositivity of patients with IBD on biologics in either centre. Furthermore, when compared
to both patient-facing and administrative staff in hospital, seroprevalence rates were lower in IBD.
We observed the lowest rate of seropositivity in Oxford patients with IBD on infliximab. Whilst this was
not replicated in the more highly exposed London cohort, it is consistent with the observation and
hypothesis of Simon and colleagues(4). The SECURE-IBD data reported, in unadjusted analyses,
vedolizumab patients had a higher proportion of severe COVID-19 compared with those on anti-TNFs
(7.2% vs. 2.2%,p=0.007)(2). It has been postulated that anti-cytokine therapies may ameliorate or
abrogate the ‘cytokine storm’ associated with severe COVID-19(7).
The seropositivity rates with 5-ASA use in Oxford are also noteworthy in the context of the hypotheses
generated by SECURE-IBD data, where 5-ASA use was associated with severe COVID-19 (OR 1.47,95%CI
1.05–2.07)(2). These finding may be artefactual however, reflecting rather the hypothesised potential
protective effect of biologics.
Strengths of this study include its deprivation data and two-centre design, with inclusion of both adult
and paediatric IBD populations. All samples, including control data, were collected in the same time
period and utilised the same assay for analysis. We recognise limitations of our study; including limited
power, incomplete exposure history and the presence of confounders with control data comparisons.
Whilst the impact of shielding and social distancing practices observed by patients must be considered
when interpreting these seroprevalence rates, we consider these findings to be informative, providing
evidence to support the continuation of biologics in the COVID-19 era, especially considering the
emerging data of deleterious IBD outcomes in those who have discontinued IBD medications during the
pandemic(8).
We cannot comment on the durability of response with a single timepoint or whether seropositive
patients are protected from re-infection, and therefore we highlight the need for larger, multicentre,
prospective, longitudinal studies such as the ICARUS and CLARITY studies, in order to answer the
questions of durability and strength of serological response, immunomodulation on SARS-CoV-2 course
and risk stratification. These studies also have potential implications in the prioritisation of vaccine
delivery in IBD cohorts.
