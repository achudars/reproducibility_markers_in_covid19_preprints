Abstract
Background As of April 2, 2020, the global reported number of COVID-19 cases has crossed

over 1 million with more than 55,000 deaths. The household transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, the
causative pathogen, remains elusive.
Methods Based on a comprehensive contact-tracing dataset from Guangzhou, we estimated

both the population-level effective reproductive number and individual-level secondary attack
rate (SAR) in the household setting. We assessed age effects on transmissibility and the
infectivity of COVID-19 cases during their incubation period.
A total of 195 unrelated clusters with 212 primary cases, 137 nonprimary (secondary
or tertiary) cases and 1938 uninfected close contacts were traced. We estimated the household
SAR to be 13.8% (95% CI: 11.1-17.0%) if household contacts are defined as all close relatives
and 19.3% (95% CI: 15.5-23.9%) if household contacts only include those at the same residential
address as the cases, assuming a mean incubation period of 4 days and a maximum infectious
period of 13 days. The odds of infection among children (<20 years old) was only 0.26 (95% CI:
0.13-0.54) times of that among the elderly (≥60 years old). There was no gender difference in
the risk of infection. COVID-19 cases were at least as infectious during their incubation period
as during their illness. On average, a COVID-19 case infected 0.48 (95% CI: 0.39-0.58) close
contacts. Had isolation not been implemented, this number increases to 0.62 (95% CI: 0.510.75). The effective reproductive number in Guangzhou dropped from above 1 to below 0.5 in
about 1 week.
Results

Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible in households than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and

the elderly ≥60 years old are the most vulnerable to household transmission. Case finding and
isolation alone may be inadequate to contain the pandemic and need to be used in conjunction
with heightened restriction of human movement as implemented in Guangzhou.

Introduction
The ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel
coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has now affected 181 countries worldwide. As of April 2, 2020, there
were more than 1 million reported cases and over 55,000 deaths.1 The elderly and individuals
with chronic conditions such as diabetes and cardiopulmonary disease are most vulnerable to
severe disease and death. Efficient transmission via droplets and fomites is potentially
supplemented by other transmission routes such as aerosol and fecal contamination.2,3
Evidence is emerging that pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic carriers can transmit the virus.5,6
It is suspected that within-household transmission might have contributed substantially to the
continued rise in cases in China even after the introduction of nationally enforced restrictions
on human movement.7,8 Home isolation/quarantine of people with an exposure history or mild
symptoms is frequently recommended as a disease control measure in countries with COVID-19
outbreaks, but such restrictions likely have limited or no effect on family transmission.
Thus far, transmissibility of the disease has primarily been assessed either at the population
level using mathematical models or at the individual level in synthetic populations using agentbased models.9-11 Transmissibility within households or through other types of close contact
remains under-investigated, despite the importance of these social interactions in shaping the
overall dynamics of disease spread and in determining the effectiveness of mitigation
strategies.12 Obtained via tracing, contact data provide the most accurate information about
human-to-human transmissibility of any infectious pathogen, because transmissibility can be
assessed conditioning on exposure. Currently available estimates for the secondary attack rate
(SAR) of SARS-CoV-2 were based on contact-tracing data of hundreds of cases in Shenzhen and
Guangzhou, Guangdong Province in southern China as well as 10 cases in the United States.13-15
These estimate are proportions of confirmed infections among all traced contacts, not
accounting for heterogeneity in exposure level, possibility of transmission among contacts
themselves and infection risks from untraced contact or fomites. We refer to these proportions
as the non-primary attack rate rather than SAR, as the infections among contacts are not
necessarily secondary.

Applying a statistical transmission model to the contact-tracing data from Guangzhou, we
estimated the SAR of SARS-CoV-2 among household and non-household close contacts. We
assessed the effects of age and gender on the infectiousness of COVID-19 cases and
susceptibility of their close contacts. In addition, we evaluated the relative infectiousness of
COVID-19 cases during the incubation period compared to the period of illness.

Methods
Case definition Case definitions (Appendix Sec. 1.1) are in accordance with the Control and

Prevention Plan for the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Disease (v5) issued by the Chinese
Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). Briefly, a suspected COVID-19 case is
defined as a patient meeting ≥1 epidemiological criteria and ≥2 clinical criteria as outlined in
the appendix. A confirmed case is defined as a suspected case with positive detection of SARSCoV-2 nucleic acid by real-time RT-PCR or viral genes that are highly homologous to SARS-CoV-2
by sequencing using respiratory or blood specimens. An asymptomatic infection is an individual
with laboratory confirmation but without clinical signs, mainly found by outbreak investigation
and contact tracing.
Epidemiological investigations were
conducted by county-level CDC offices within 24 hours after a suspected or confirmed case or
an asymptomatic infection was reported. For each suspected or confirmed case, demographic,
clinical, diagnostic and occupational data, baseline health conditions, clinical samples and
laboratory test results, and exposure history in the 14 days prior to symptom onset were
recorded using a standardized investigation form. Typically, a suspected case would be changed
to a confirmed case or removed from the surveillance system when laboratory test results
became available. A close contact is defined as an individual who had unprotected close
contact (within 1 meter) with a confirmed case or an asymptomatic infection within 2 days
before their symptom onset or sample collection, including but not limited to household
members, care givers and individuals in the same workplace, classroom, ward or transportation
vehicle. Close contacts were quarantined at an observatory place or at home and followed for
Epidemiological investigation and contact-tracing

14 days, according to the Temporary Guidelines for Investigation and Management of Close
Contacts of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Patients issued by China CDC.
In our analyses, individuals who are linked by contact tracing are considered as a cluster. Given
a cluster, we define cases with symptom onset on either the earliest onset day or the following
day as primary cases. If a cluster had only asymptomatic infections, primary cases are
determined by specimen collection dates. Individuals who are either family members, or close
relatives, such as parents and parents-in-law, or live in the same residential address are
considered as household contacts of each other. In sensitivity analyses, we also restrict
household contacts to individuals living at the same address.
Statistical Analysis Standard nonparametric tests such as Fisher’s exact test were used to

compare characteristics between demographic groups in R.16 The spatial distribution of clusters
was mapped at the community level using ArcGIS (Environmental Systems Research Institute,
Redlands, California), with a directed graph indicating potential transmission chains. We
estimated effective reproductive numbers ( ௧ ) based on the contact tracing data (Appendix Sec.
1.2). Due to the uncertainty in the transmission relationship, we explore three scenarios
defined by the following assumptions: (1) all imported cases (with travel or living history in
Wuhan or Hubei Province 14 days before symptom onset) were primary cases, and all
nonprimary cases were infected by primary cases in the same cluster; (2) in addition to (1), local
primary cases might have been infected by earlier primary cases in other clusters; and (3) in
addition to (2), imported non-primary cases were not considered as primary cases.
A chain-binomial statistical model was used to estimate SAR and local reproductive number
(Appendix Sec. 1.3).17 Only confirmed infections (symptomatic or asymptomatic) and their
contacts were included in the analysis. the Expectation and maximization (EM) approach was
used to account for uncertainty in the infection time of asymptomatic infections (Appendix Sec.
1.3). Possible distributions of the incubation period and the infectious period were derived
from the literature and our previous work on a separate contact-tracing database (Appendix
Sec. 1.4).18-20

Briefly, this model estimates the probabilities, denoted by ଵ and ଶ , of viral transmission from
an infectious household contact and from an infectious non-household contact (e.g., friends,
co-workers, passengers, etc.), respectively, to a susceptible person per daily contact. In addition,
each susceptible person is subject to a constant daily probability, , of being infected by an
unspecified external source, which accounts for untraced contacts and fomites. Suppose that
the infectivity of a COVID-19 case differs between the incubation period and the post-illnessonset period (referred to as the illness period hereinafter). We use (௠௜௡ , ௠௔௫ ) to represent
the whole infectious period with the symptom onset day set as day 0. We then model the
effective daily transmission probability as ௞‫   כ‬௞ on days ௠௜௡  0 (incubation period)

Results
By February 17, 2020, a total of 349 lab-confirmed cases were reported to Guangzhou
Municipal CDC, forming 195 unrelated clusters with 212 primary cases and 137 nonprimary
(secondary or tertiary) cases. The size of clusters ranges from 1 to 274, with a median size of 6
and an inter-quartile range (IQR) of (4, 10). The majority (65%) of clusters had no secondary
cases.
The majority of cases were adults aged 20-59 years (Table 1). The majority of primary cases
(171, 81%) and more than half of non-primary cases (77, 56%) had recent travel or living history
outside Guangzhou (referred to as imported cases hereinafter), and 89% of these imported
cases were related to Hubei Province. Among the 155 imported primary cases with known
arrival dates, 123 (79%) arrived at Guangzhou on or before the complete lockdown of Wuhan
(Jan. 24). The overall non-primary attack rates are 12.6% and 3.06% among household and nonhousehold contacts, respectively. Within households, the non-primary attack rate was much
lower in contacts <20 years group, 5.26% (95% CI 2.43, 9.76%), as compared to 13.72% (95% CI
10.68, 17.24%) and 17.69% (95% CI: 11.89, 24.83%) in 20-59 year olds and ≥60 year olds,
respectively (p-values <0.005). A similar age trend was observed among non-household
contacts, but the differences were not of statistical significance. There was no gender
difference in the non-primary attack rates, for both inside and outside the household.

Most cases were found in the densely populated districts (56% of the total population in
Guangzhou) including Yuexiu, Liwan, Haizhu, Tianhe and Baiyun (Figure 1). Three clusters with
5 or more secondary cases (not counting tertiary or further generations) were observed, one in
each of Yuexiu, Haizhu and Baiyun districts, and all primary cases in these clusters were
imported (Figure 1A-B). The longest transmission chain had three subsequent generations from
the primary case, which occurred in Panyu district (Figure 1C). Five other clusters had two
subsequent generations (Figure 1A-B). The reported residential locations of primary and nonprimary cases within the same clusters are mostly identical, but non-household non-primary
cases might live far from the primary cases. Most transmissions occurred between household
members (Appendix Figure S1).
Figure 2 shows the temporal trend of the COVID-19 epidemic in Guangzhou. The first imported
primary case had symptom onset on Jan. 7, 2020, and this case arrived in Guangzhou on Jan. 13.
The earliest local primary case had symptom onset on Jan. 16, by which time there were
already at least 2 imported cases in Guangzhou. The number of imported cases peaked
together with the epidemic in Guangzhou around Jan. 27, 4 days after the lockdown in Wuhan.
After that, both case importation and the epidemic itself waned fast, and only sporadic cases
were reported by the middle of February. The ௧ started relatively high at the early phase,
reaching 1.3 in scenario (3), barely 1.1 in scenarios (2) and only 0.7 in scenario (1). ௧ quickly
declined after the peak to below 0.5 by Jan. 27 for all scenarios, likely reflecting the tightening
of control measures in Guangzhou.
After excluding 12 clusters with only primary cases but no contact, we included in the
transmission analysis 183 clusters with a total of 335 cases (329 symptomatic and 6
asymptomatic) and 1938 noninfected contacts. We estimated the household and nonhousehold SARs for the combinations of mean incubation period of 4-7 days and maximum
infectious period of 13, 16 and 19 days. Assessment of the goodness-of-fit for these settings
suggests that all models fits the data reasonably well, with model predicted infection numbers
falling largely in line with the observed values. A mean incubation period of 4 days and a
maximum infectious period of 13 days yielded the smallest difference between observed and

model-fitted numbers (Appendix Figure S3). Consequently, we reported the estimates associate
with this setting as the primary results.
When household contact is defined based on close relatives, we estimate the household SAR as
13.8% (95% CI: 11.1-17.0%) and the non-household SAR as 7.1% (95% CI: 4.7-10.6%), had there
been no case isolation. A longer incubation periods is associated with a slightly lower, whereas
a longer infectious period is associated with a slightly higher, SAR estimate (Table 2; Appendix
Table S3). The household SAR varies from 12% to 17%, and the non-household SAR varied from
6% to 9%. The local R based on observed contact frequencies of primary cases was estimated to
be 0.48 (0.39, 0.58), which is insensitive to the setting for the incubation and infectious periods.
In other words, a typical case infected 0.48 individuals on average in Guangzhou, implying an
inefficient transmission of the disease under the control measures. The projected local R, had
there been no quarantine of cases, was estimated as 0.62 (0.51-0.75). High estimates of
projected local R were associated with short incubation and longer infectious periods (Appendix
Table S3). The daily transmission probability during the incubation period tends to be similar to
that during the illness period (Table 3), with an estimated odds ratio (OR) of 1.13 (0.59-2.18);
however, the difference is much wider when longer incubation periods were assumed (Table3;
Appendix Table S4-S5).
Individuals ≥60 years old were the most susceptible group to COVID-19 (Table 4). In comparison
to the elderly group (≥60 years old), the odds of infection is 0.27 (0.13-0.55) in the youngest
group (<20 years old) and 0.8 (95% CI: 0.54-1.20) in the younger adult group (20-59 years old).
These age effects on susceptibility are insensitive to the assumptions about the natural history
of disease. Cases <60 years old were slightly less infectious than those ≥60 years old, with ORs
varying in the range of 0.73- 0.79 but not significantly different from 1 (Table 4; Appendix Table
S6). The ORs for the relative infectivity of the incubation vs. illness periods are similar to the
model not adjusted for age group. The estimated daily transmission probabilities in the ageadjusted model are for the elderly and therefore higher than the estimates unadjusted for age
(Appendix Table S4).

Restricting household contacts to those who were living at the same address as the primary
case led to higher SAR estimates among household contacts, 16.4-23.4%, but lower SAR
estimates among the non-household contacts under the various settings of the natural history
of disease (Table 2; Appendix Table S3). Under the setting of the shortest incubation and
infectious periods, the SAR was estimated as 19.3% (95% CI: 15.51-23.86%). The age effects and
the relative infectivity of the illness period vs. the incubation period remained qualitatively
similar (Table 4; Appendix Table S6).

Discussion
We characterized the spatial and temporal epidemiology of the COVID-19 epidemic in
Guangzhou, the most populated city in southern China. We assessed several aspects of the
transmissibility of the disease, such as the time-varying effective reproductive number at the
population level, household and non-household SARs, and local reproductive number among
close contacts. In addition, we assessed the relative infectivity of the incubation period in
comparison to the illness period of COVID-19 cases, and explored the role of age in
susceptibility and infectivity. We found that COVID-19 patients in their incubation period were
at least as infectious as during their illness period, and that that elderly people are the most
susceptible to infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, not just severe disease.
When household contact is defined by living at the same address, our model-based household
SAR estimate for the Guangzhou contact-tracing data is 19.3%, which is higher than the nonmodel-based estimates 14.9% for the Shenzhen and 10.2% for Guangzhou.13,14 These nonmodel-based estimates are non-primary attack rates rather than the actual household SARs. In
general, a non-primary attack rate is higher than an SAR as the former does not exclude tertiary
transmission and untraced exposure. However, these non-primary attack rate estimates reflect
transmissibility under control measures such as case isolation, whereas our SAR estimate
assumes exposure of a susceptible to the full infectious period of an infector, which is more
epidemiologically relevant and generalizable.

Model-based household SAR estimates for the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or the Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERSCoV) are not available, but a few studies have reported non-primary attack rates in the
household or comparable settings. For SARS-CoV, the non-primary attack rate was estimated to
be 4.6% (95%CI: 2.3-8.9%) in Beijing, 8% (95% CI: 6.9-9.1%) in Hong Kong, 6.2% (95% CI: 3.98.6%) in Singapore, and 10.2% (95%CI: 6.7-23.5%) in Toronto.21-23 Information on household
transmissibility of MERS-CoV is less clear. A multi-city household study in Saudi Arabia found
the non-primary attack rate to be 4% (95% CI:2-7%).24 In an outbreak among female workers
who lived in expatriate dormitory consisting of 24 villas in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, 19 out of 828
were infected. If each villa (24-50 inhabitants) is considered a household, we estimated the
non-primary attack rate to be 5.1%.25 We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible than
both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in households.
We are the first to quantify the infectivity of COVID-19 patients during their incubation period
using contact-tracing data, but qualitative evidence has been noted before. Transmission to
secondary cases during the incubation period of the primary case has been noted in both
Germany and China.6, 26 In our unpublished analysis of a separate dataset of case clusters in
China, the mean serial interval (time between symptom onsets of a primary and a secondary
case) was shorter than the mean incubation period, suggesting that infectivity during the
incubation period is not trivial.27 In contrast, shedding of SARS-CoV peaks 6-11 days after illness
onset, and asymptomatic and mild MERS-CoV cases were thought to transmit inefficiently,
indicating the key role of symptoms in the transmission of these two coronaviruses.28-30 This
finding has a profound implication on prevention and control strategies, e.g., the necessity of
testing asymptomatic close contacts of COVID-19 cases, and the importance of wearing facial
mask regardless of symptoms in order to curb the pandemic.
We estimated the local reproductive number to be relatively low, around 0.48 (Table 3), which
is consistent with the average level of ௧ (Figure 2). We projected that, without isolation of
cases and their contacts, the local reproductive number would have been about 30% higher to
reach 0.62 in our primary analysis setting. This moderate effect of isolation is partly due to high
infectivity during the incubation period, that is, many secondary cases had been infected before

or shortly after the symptom onset of the primary cases before the primary cases were
identified and isolated. This observation also implies that the low reproductive number in
Guangzhou possibly resulted more from policies restricting human movement, limiting the
number of contacts of COVID-19 cases during their entire infectious period including the
incubation period, than from the detection and isolation of cases and close contacts.
Our analysis has several limitations. When the mean incubation period is assumed relatively
long, the model suggests that the incubation period could be much more infectious than the
illness period, which differs from our experience with most respiratory pathogens. This effect
could be due to the fact that exposure of close contacts to cases was mostly truncated soon
after symptom onset of cases, a consequence of efficient case-finding and isolation of both
cases and close contacts all over China after Wuhan’s lockdown. When few transmissions
occurred during the illness period, a large bias could happen by chance, as a long incubation
period in the model would attribute more transmissions to the incubation period. In addition,
we were not able to reliably quantify the infectivity of asymptomatic infections given the
limited number of asymptomatic infections, 0.9% and 2.9% among primary and non-primary
cases, and our assumption that asymptomatic infections share the same infectivity as the
symptomatic cases during their incubation period may not be realistic.
The infectiousness of COVID-19 patients during their incubation period is alarming. This
potential of “silent” transmission substantially increased the difficulty in curbing the ongoing
pandemic. More and more countries now have realized that active case finding, testing and
isolation alone may be inadequate and should be used in conjunction with general human
movement restrictions such as stay-at-home policies. On the other hand, the efficient
household transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 should be given full consideration when stay-at-home
is ordered. It is crucial to advocate self-monitoring of symptoms and timely self-isolation from
other household members when either symptoms emerge or potential exposure occurs.
Providing comfortable facilities for exposed contacts to quarantine or for mild cases to isolate

Figure 1. Spatial distribution of COVID-19 case clusters based on contact-tracing data from
Guangzhou through February 17, 2020. The upper-left panel shows the overall distribution in
Guangzhou, and panels A-F show the distribution in the sub-regions defined in the upper-left
panel. Cases are considered as primary (triangles) if their symptom onset dates are the earliest
or one day after the earliest in the cluster and as non-primary (circles) otherwise. Infected
household contacts are represented by dotted circles. Non-infected contacts are not shown.
Cases imported from outside Guangzhou are colored in red and local cases are colored in blue.
Darker (lighter) color indicates symptom onset on or before (after) Jan. 23, 2002. Each arrow
indicates potential transmission direction from a case with an earlier symptom onset to an
infected contact with a later symptom onset. Co-primary cases are linked by unidirectional
dashed lines. The displayed location of each case is jittered away from the actual residential
address. Population densities at the township level are shown as the background.

Jan. 6 to Feb. 18, 2020. Cases are stratified by imported vs. local and primary vs. secondary and
shaded correspondingly. Here all non-primary cases are considered as secondary cases.
Estimated effective reproductive numbers

are shown for three scenarios corresponding to

assumptions about the transmission relationship between different types of cases (see
methods, statistical analysis).
