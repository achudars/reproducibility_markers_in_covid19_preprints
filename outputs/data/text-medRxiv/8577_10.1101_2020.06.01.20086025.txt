ABSTRACT
Objectives To determine the age-specific clinical presentations and incidence of
adverse outcomes among patients with COVID-19 in Jiangsu, China.
Design and setting This is a retrospective, multi-center cohort study performed at
twenty-four hospitals in Jiangsu, China.
Participants From January 10 to March 15, 2020, 625 patients with COVID-19 were
involved.
Results Of the 625 patients (median age, 46 years; 329 [52.6%] males), 37 (5.9%)
were children (18 years or less), 261 (40%) young adults (19-44 years), 248 (39.7%)
middle-aged adults (45-64 years), and 79 (12.6%) elderly (65 years or more). The
incidence of hypertension, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, and diabetes comorbidities increased with age (trend test, P < .0001, P =
0.0003, P < .0001, and P < .0001 respectively). Fever, cough, and shortness of breath
occurred more commonly among older patients, especially the elderly, compared to
children (Chi-square test, P = 0.0008, 0.0146, and 0.0282, respectively). The quadrant
score and pulmonary opacity score increased with age (trend test, both P < .0001).
Older patients had significantly more abnormal values in many laboratory parameters
than younger patients. Elderly patients contributed the highest proportion of severe or
critically-ill cases (33.0%, Chi-square test P < 0.001), intensive care unit (ICU)
(35.4%, Chi-square test P < 0.001), and respiratory failure (31.6%, Chi-square test P
= 0.0266), and longest hospital stay (21 days, ANOVA-test P < 0.001).
Conclusions Elderly (≥65) patients with COVID-19 had the highest risk of severe or
critical illness, intensive care use, respiratory failure, and the longest hospital stay,
which may be due partly to that they had higher incidence of comorbidities and poor
immune responses to COVID-19.

Strengths and limitations of this study
The cohort consists of almost all COVID-19 patients in Jiangsu province with a
population over 80 million and its results should be representative of the patient
population in the whole province and with a wide range of disease severity, therefore
the results are subject to less selection bias.
The study includes imported and local cases and could study patients with different
types of exposures.
The relative short follow-up time and a very small proportion of patients who
remained in hospital after the 14-day follow-up period yield incomplete estimates for
disease severity and clinical outcomes.

Introduction
COVID-19 infection causes a wide spectrum of diseases which may lead to
respiratory failure and death. Most of the available studies prior to the COVID-19
pandemic found that people of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection but
noted higher positive rates in real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) assays and hospitalization burden in older people.1-3 Similar to
SARS, deaths and adverse clinical outcomes have been found to be more common in
the elderly with known comorbidities for patients with COVID-19.4-6 Evidence
suggests that asymptomatic carriers were more common among middle-aged people
in close contact with infected family members.7 One study found that elderly patients
with COVID-19 had some different clinical features from younger patients.8 Because
age is a host factor that leads to a higher risk of severe COVID-19 and worse
prognosis, it is important to better understand age-related susceptibility and
pathology. However, published data on age differences in clinical features and clinical
outcomes associated with COVID-19 are still scarce. This study aimed to investigate
differences in clinical characteristics, disease severity, and clinical outcome burden in
different age groups.
Methods
Study design and participants
This retrospective cohort study included all patients who met the patient’s inclusion
and exclusion criteria, so no sample size calculations were conducted a priori. The
inclusion criteria as of March 15, 2020, were all patients diagnosed with COVID-19
in Jiangsu Province according to the “Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel
Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7)” released by the National Health
Commission & National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of China;9
admitted to designated hospitals for COVID-19 treatment in Jiangsu . The exclusion
criterion for patients was limited to those with no available medical records. The
discharge standard imposed was that body temperature returns to normal for more
than 3 days, symptoms resolve (if there were symptoms), and RT-PCR assays (throat
swab samples, at least 1 day for sampling interval) show 2 consecutive negative
results.
Data collection and definition of variables
The epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic parameters on admission;
disease severity (asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, and critically ill); and clinical
outcomes data were extracted from medical records. Data on disease severity were
available at days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 14 after admission, except for those who were
discharged, and data on mortality and hospitalization status were available until
March 15, 2020. Asymptomatic infection was defined as the absence of clinical
symptoms but a positive nucleic acid test result. Mild disease was defined as having
mild clinical symptoms and the absence of imaging manifestations of pneumonia in
computer tomography (CT) scans. Moderate disease was defined as the presence of
fever, respiratory tract symptoms or other symptoms and imaging manifestations of
pneumonia. Severe disease was defined as the presence of at least one of the
following items: respiratory distress, respiratory rate ≥ 30 beats / min; oxygen
saturation in resting state (SpO2) ≤ 93%; or arterial blood oxygen partial pressure
(PaO2) / fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ≤ 300 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133kPa).
Critically ill was defined as having respiratory failure requiring mechanical

ventilation, shock or combined organ failure requiring intensive care unit (ICU)
monitoring and treatment. We categorized the population into four age groups:
children (18 years or less), young adults (19-44 years), middle-aged adults (45-64
years), and elderly (65 years or more).
All of the patients in Jiangsu had a high-resolution CT thorax examination which
reflects lung lesions. CT images were assessed visually by two radiologists who had
more than 5 years working experience in chest imaging. The radiologists were blinded
to the patients’ information. Quadrant scores were the sum of the number of quadrants
containing pulmonary opacities extending from the proximal to the distal end of the
chest, with a score ranging between 0 and 4. For pulmonary opacity, bilateral lungs
were scored manually and assigned an estimated percentage of pulmonary opacity
relative to the whole lung, rounded to the nearest 5%.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were reported as means ± standard deviation (SD) or median
(interquartile range [IQR]) by groups and compared using ANOVA-test or Kruskal–
Wallis test depending on their distributions. Categorical variables were summarized
using frequency and percentage and compared using Chi-squared/Fisher exact test. To
assess the linear trend effect of age on demographic and clinical variables and clinical
outcomes, generalised linear models were employed with age (year) as the only
predictor. Normal distribution and identity link function were used for continuous
variables whereas binomial distribution and logit link function were used for binary
variables. Analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute), and a two-sided P
< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Patient and public involvement
Patients or the public were not involved in the design, or conduct, or reporting, or
dissemination plans of our research.
Results
Of the 721 suspected cases with possible COVID-19 during the study period, 631
patients were found to be RT-PCR positive for COVID-19. Only 625 patients were
included in the study with complete data (Figure 1). The median age was 46 years
(IQR, 32-57; range, 0.75-96 years), and 329 (52.6%) were men (Table 1). Thirty
seven (5.9%) were children, 261 (40%) young adults of 19-44 years, 248 (39.7%)
middle-aged of 45-64 years, and 79 (12.6%) elderly of 65 years or over.
There was no significant difference in the proportion of men and women in each age
group (Table 1). A significantly higher proportion of young patients aged 18 years
and below were cluster onset. The comorbidities incidence of hypertension, coronary
heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes comorbidities
increased with age (trend test, P < .0001, P = 0.0003, P < .0001, and P < .0001
respectively). Fever, cough, and shortness of breath occurred significantly more
commonly among young adult, middle-aged, and elderly patients compared to
children (67.8%, 68.5%, 65.8% vs 35.1%, P = 0.0008; 57.9%, 56%, 54.4%, vs 29.7%,
P = 0.0146; 1.9%, 3.2%, 8.9%, vs 0%, P = 0.0282, respectively). The frequencies of
these symptoms were similar among different age groups of adults except for
shortness of breath which was dramatically more common (8.9%) in elderly adult
patients of 65 years or over. Compared to children and younger adult patients, the

incidence of smoking and drinking alcohol was significantly (twice the rate) higher
among middle-aged and elderly patients. Three vital sign parameters on admission:
SBP (mmHg), DBP (mmHg) and SpO2 (%), increased linearly with age (P<.0001 for
three trend tests), with child patients having the lowest mean value. The quadrant
score and pulmonary opacity score increased with age (trend tests, both P < .0001).
Significant differences were observed in some laboratory test results (Table 2). Older
patients tended to have lower PaO2 (mmHg), PaCO2 (mmHg), and bicarbonate
(mmol/L) in blood gas analysis. In blood tests they had lower white blood cell (WBC)
(109/L), lymphocyte (109/L), hemoglobin (g/L), and platelets (109/L). In organ
function tests these patients had higher alanine aminotransferase (U/L) and creatinine
(umol/L), and lower albumin (g/L). In coagulation function tests they had higher Creactive protein (mg/L) in inflammatory factor tests; lower activated partial
thromboplastin time (s), and higher fibrinogen (g/L) and d-dimer (mg/L).
The proportion of patients who received supportive treatment and antiviral and
antibiotic therapy increased significantly with patients’ age, except for the very rare
procedure of continuous renal replacement therapy and extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation treatment, and the very common use of interferon among different age
groups (see supplementary Table S1).
The proportion of patients with severe or critical illness was 33% among elderly
patients, compared with 13% among middle-aged patients, 2.3% among young adult
patients, and 0% among children (P < .0001) (Table 3).
By the end of the study, none of the patients had died and all 625 patients had been
discharged. The ICU rate (trend test, P < 0.001), respiratory failure rate (trend test, P
< 0.001), and hospital stays (trend test, P < 0.001) increased with age (Table 4). The
proportion of patients requiring ICU care (P < 0.001) and developing respiratory
failure (P < 0.001) among elderly patients was 35.4% and 31.6% respectively,
compared to 14.5% and 12.5% among middle-aged patients, 2.3% and 1.9% among
young adult patients, and none among children, respectively. Elderly patients also had
longer hospital stays (median [IQR], 21.0 [14.0-26.0] days) than all other age groups
(15.0 [11.0-21.0] for children, 14.0 [11.0-19.0] for young adults, and 17.0 [13.0-22.0]
for middle-aged adults, P < .0001).
Discussion
We describe, to our knowledge, the largest cohort to date of 625 patients, to assess
age differences in clinical features and clinical outcomes associated with COVID-19.
We observed that most COVID-19 cases were among young adult patients of 19-44
years and middle-aged patients of 45-64 years, approximately 40% of each, with 5.9%
children of 18 years or under, and 12.6% elderly patients of 65 years or over. This is
consistent with a previous study from Korea reporting 6.3% of cases with COVID-19
were children under 19 years old as of March 20, which was considered to have tested
the broadest and hence the most representative population.10
Our study showed that compared to adults, children were more likely to get infected
through cluster gatherings. A previous study reported that COVID-19 in children was
mainly caused by family transmission.11
Our study showed in Jiangsu, no patient had died and all patients had been
discharged. Elderly patients were more than twice as likely to have a severe or critical

illness compared with middle-aged patients, while young adult patients had a smaller
proportion of severe symptoms, and child patients exhibited none. The ICU and
respiratory failure rate, and hospital stay increased with age. Many case studies have
shown that older patients are refractory (not yielding to treatment or not significantly
improved after treatment) and likely to be at higher risk of more severe disease
including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, and
death,12-19 while children are more likely to have mild or moderate type of COVID19.11,20 This is similar to SARS characteristics that, compared to adults and
adolescents, disease appears to be less severe in younger children.6
We found that initial symptoms including fever, cough, and shortness of breath
occurred more frequently among adult patients than child patients and shortness of
breath was dramatically more common in elderly adult patients of 65 years or over.
This is consistent with the previous study showing the older group (≥60y) had a
higher rate of shortness of breath than the younger group (<60y).21 We also found
another study focused on age difference whose sample size (56 patients) was too
small to draw a conclusion and only found 4 patients in total with symptoms of chest
tightness or difficulty breathing.8 These symptoms may be the early signs of more
severe illness and poorer outcomes in older patients. The frequency of these
symptoms among adult patients in different age groups were similar except for
shortness of breath, which was dramatically more common in elderly patients than
younger age groups. This is different from the characteristics of influenza, where the
initial clinical manifestations of frail elderly patients are usually subtle compared to
young patients.22,23 In our study, the difference in vital sign of MAP on admission for
different age groups were statistically significant (increasing with age) but may not be
clinical significant.
Although early reports in Wuhan show that more men than women have severe
COVID-19, later studies have reported a similar ratio of men and women in ICU.24-26
Although the inherent gender-immunity differences caused by chromosomes and
hormones,27 as well as possible gender differences in smoking, drinking, and
comorbidities, may have an impact on severity, the reason why earlier reports
included more male patients, is probably that early patients were mainly males
exposed in markets and congregation sites, and at higher risk for occupational
infections.26 Our study shows that the proportion of men and women were similar for
each age group, which may indicate that gender differences disappeared with the
generalization of the study population.
Our study showed the age differences in clinical outcomes likely also resulted
partially from the increased incidence of comorbidities with age including
hypertension, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and
diabetes, which may have increased the susceptibility of virus infection; such
comorbidities are identified as a risk factor of more severe disease including
respiratory failure and death in patients with COVID-19.13,17-19,28 Other explanations
about why older people suffer poorer outcomes may be due to the higher prevalence
of smoking and alcohol drinking in older patients with COVID-19 in Jiangsu. Our
study showed seniors drank more than twice as often as young patients. History of
smoking has been identified as a factor contributing to the progression of COVID-19
pneumonia.29

Our study demonstrated that the quadrant score and pulmonary opacity score
increased with age, suggesting more severe abnormal imaging manifestation on
admission among these older patients. This is consistent with the finding that the
proportion of multiple lobe involvement in older patients was higher than in younger
cases.8 Previous reports have also found some imaging differences by age groups; for
example, primarily elderly patients were reported to have atypical imaging findings
of consolidative opacities superimposed on ground-glass opacification,30 while
paediatric patients showed more modest pulmonary involvement and less commonly
reported consolidation complicated peripheral halo signs, compared with adults.31-33
Abnormal values in laboratory parameters in older patients may also be an early sign
of, and a contribution to, severe illness and poor outcomes. This is consistent with a
previous study showing the proportion of lymphocytes in the older cases was
significantly lower and the C-reactive protein was higher than that in the younger
patients.8 Studies showed albumin and C-reactive protein were associated with the
progression of COVID-19 pneumonia,29 greater d-dimer on admission increases risk
of in-hospital death,14 organ and coagulation dysfunction (eg, higher d-dimer)
contributing to the development of ARDS and progression from ARDS to death.16
Our study indicated that lymphopenia (normal range: 0.3-3.0*109/L) was shown in all
age groups, but white blood cell and lymphocytes counts were lower in the older
patients, indicating that live SARS-COV-2 virus stimulated poorer responses in the
older patients. The mechanism in old patients with a severe COVID-19 illness may be
that older patients have a diminished immune response to the novel SARS-COV2 virus which is a defence mechanism against respiratory viruses and contributes to
virus clearance. The thymic involution in older patients causes age-related reduction
of T cell repertoire diversity and defects in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell function and hence
significantly reduces immune function (known as immunosenescence).34,35
Immunosenescence makes many viral infections worse in older patients.36 But further
research is necessary to investigate whether age differences in disease severity and
outcomes of COVID-19 result from aging of the immune system and reduced
responsiveness. This is because some respiratory viruses could escape antiviral
mechanisms and immune responses.37 For example, a study of H1N1pdm (respiratory
viruses) on ferrets found no significant difference in viral clearance between young
and adult subjects.38 However, studies found that the pulmonary pathology improved
earlier in young ferrets, regulatory interleukin-10 (which is mainly produced
by monocytes and lymphocytes) and interferon responses were more robust in young
ferrets.38-40 Also H1N1pdm infection triggered formation of lung structures that
resembled inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissues (iBALTs) in young ferrets
which contributes to pulmonary immune responses and were not seen in the adult
ferrets with severe disease.38-40 Some other studies demonstrated aged ferrets infected
with influenza viruses had reduced antibody production and delayed peripheral blood
T-cell responses compared to adult comterparts.34,35,41 Another study reported that
except for immunosenescence in aged people, age-related increases in levels of
phospholipase could also result in a delay of immune response and poor outcomes
after SARS-CoV infection.36 Overall, research focused on innate immune-related
mechanisms and viral clearance in patients with COVID-19 of different age groups
may help determine the underlying mechanisms of disease severity.
Some other reasonable mechanisms of mild presentation in children include
qualitatively different response to SARS-CoV2, or different expression of

angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptors required for SARS-CoV2
infection, or different virus-to-virus interaction and competition from other viruses
limiting SARS-CoV2 growth.10
A larger proportion of older patients in this study received supportive treatment and
antiviral and antibiotic therapies which was due in part to the increasing proportion of
severely or critically illness in older adults. A previous study similarly showed that
treatment was statistically different by age group.8
We believe that the findings of this study are generalizable to populations in similar
settings (e.g. outside the initial pandemic center) for three reasons: (1) we included all
patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria during the study period; (2) the
study population consisted of cases confirmed by laboratory tests, by screening
suspected cases especially those who had a contact of pandemic center, or a contact of
people who had been to pandemic center or who had confirmed diagnoses of COVID19; and (3) after the end of study, no new cases was confirmed with COVID-19
because of the effective and timely public health interventions including isolation of
suspected and confirmed cases and lockdown of the whole country.
Our study has several limitations. First, the relative short follow-up time and a very
small proportion of patients who remained in hospital after the 14-day follow-up
period yield incomplete estimates for disease severity and clinical outcomes, making
it difficult to fully assess age differences in the burden associated with COVID-19.
However, this impact is minor and may not strongly affect the study results because
we included analyses of outcomes at the end of study, and only a small number of
patients were still in hospital at the end of the study. Second, we were unable to
perform multiple regression analysis to control for possible bias in the observed age
impact in clinical features and outcomes. As a result, the observed age differences
may still be subject to possible confounding factors.
Conclusions
Older patients in this setting in China tended to have relatively severe clinical
infections and poor clinical outcomes associated with COVID-19 compared to
younger patients. Elderly patients aged 65 and over were at a much higher risk of
developing severe or critical illness than other age groups. The ICU and respiratory
failure rate, and hospital stay increased with age. Older patients have worse clinical
outcomes, in part due to comorbidities in older people, and higher rates of smoking
and drinking habits, and immune, organ, and coagulation dysfunction on admission.
In studying the pathogenesis and developing management strategies of COVID-19,
the age factor is confirmed as a critical factor in severity of infection.
