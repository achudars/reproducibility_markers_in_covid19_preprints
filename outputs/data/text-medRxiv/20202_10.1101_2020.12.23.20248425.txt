Abstract

37
38

Understanding the pathology of COVID-19 is a global research priority. Early evidence

39

suggests that the microbiome may be playing a role in disease progression, yet current

40

studies report contradictory results. Here, we examine potential confounders in

41

COVID-19 microbiome studies by analyzing the upper (n=58) and lower (n=35)

42

respiratory tract microbiome in well-phenotyped COVID-19 patients and controls

43

combining microbiome sequencing, viral load determination, and immunoprofiling. We

44

found that time in the intensive care unit and the type of oxygen support explained

45

the most variation within the upper respiratory tract microbiome, dwarfing (non-

46

significant) effects from viral load, disease severity, and immune status. Specifically,

47

mechanical ventilation was linked to altered community structure, lower species- and

48

higher strain-level diversity, and significant shifts in oral taxa previously associated

49

with COVID-19. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the lower respiratory tract of

50

ventilated COVID-19 patients identified increased oral microbiota compared to

51

controls. These oral microbiota were found physically associated with proinflammatory

52

immune cells, which showed higher levels of inflammatory markers. Overall, our

53

findings suggest confounders are driving contradictory results in current COVID-19

54

microbiome studies and careful attention needs to be paid to ICU stay and type of

55

oxygen support, as bacteria favored in these conditions may contribute to the

56

inflammatory phenotypes observed in severe COVID-19 patients.

Introduction

59
60

COVID-19, a novel coronavirus disease classified as a pandemic by the World Health

61

Organization, has caused over 40 million reported cases and 1 million deaths

62

worldwide to date. Infection by its causative agent, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2,

63

results in a wide range of clinical manifestations: it is estimated that around 80% of

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.23.20248425; this version posted February 7, 2021. The copyright holder for this

64

infected individuals are asymptomatic or present only mild respiratory and/or

65

gastrointestinal symptoms, while the remaining 20% develop acute respiratory distress

66

syndrome requiring hospitalization and oxygen support and, of those, 25% of cases

67

necessitate critical care. Despite a concerted global research effort, many questions

68

remain about the full spectrum of the disease severity. Independent studies from

69

different countries, however, agree that age and sex are the major risk factors for

70

disease severity and patient death1–3, as well as type 2 diabetes and obesity 4,5. Other

71

risk factors for critical condition and death are viral load of the patient upon hospital

72

admission6–8 and the specific immune response to infection, with manifestation of a

73

“cytokine storm” in critical patients characterized by increased levels of pro-

74

inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, sustaining a disproportionate immune

75

response that may ultimately cause organ failure9–11.

76
77

Despite its close interplay with the immune system and its known associations with

78

host health, little is known about the role of the respiratory microbiota in modulating

79

COVID-19 disease severity, or its potential as a prognostic marker12. Previous studies

80

exploring other pulmonary disorders have shown that lung microbiota may exacerbate

81

their symptoms and contribute to their severity13, potentially through direct crosstalk

82

with the immune system and/or due to bacteremia and secondary infections14. Few

83

studies of the respiratory microbiome in COVID-19 have revealed elevated levels of

84

opportunistic pathogenic bacteria15–17. However, reports on bacterial diversity are

85

contradictory. While some studies report a low microbial diversity in COVID-19

86

patients15,18 that rebounds following recovery16, others show an increased diversity in

87

the COVID-19 associated microbiota17. These conflicting results could be due to

88

differences in sampling location (upper or lower respiratory tract), severity of the

89

patients, disease stage, or other confounders. While these early findings already

90

suggest that the lung microbiome could be exacerbating or mitigating COVID-19

91

progression, exact mechanisms are yet to be elucidated. Therefore, an urgent need

92

exists for studies identifying and tackling confounders in order to discern true signals

93

from noise.

95

To identify potential associations between COVID-19 severity and evolution and the

96

upper and lower respiratory tract microbiota, we used nasopharyngeal swabs and

97

bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples, respectively. For the upper respiratory tract, we

98

longitudinally profiled the nasopharyngeal microbiome of 58 COVID-19 patients during

99

intensive care unit (ICU) treatment and after discharge to a classical hospital ward

100

following clinical improvement, in conjunction with viral load determination and

101

nCounter immune profiling. For the lower respiratory tract, we analyzed microbial

102

signals in cross-sectional single-cell RNA-seq data from of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)

103

samples of 22 COVID-19 patients and 13 pneumonitis controls with negative COVID-19

104

qRT-PCR, obtained from the same hospital. The integration of these data enabled us to

105

(1) identify potential confounders of COVID-19 microbiome associations, (2) explore

106

how microbial diversity evolves throughout hospitalization, (3) study microbe-host cell

107

interaction and (4) substantiate a link between the respiratory microbiome and SARS-

108

CoV-2 viral load as well as COVID-19 disease severity. Altogether, our results directly

109

point to specific interactions between the microbiota and the immune cells, likely

110

driven by clinical ventilation practices, which could potentially influence COVID-19

111

disease progression and resolution.

The upper respiratory microbiota of COVID-19 patients

116
117

We longitudinally profiled the upper respiratory microbiota of 58 patients diagnosed

118

with COVID-19 based on a positive qRT-PCR test or a negative test with high clinical

119

suspicion based on symptomatology and a chest CT-scan showing alveolar damage. All

120

these patients were admitted and treated at UZ Leuven hospital. Patient demographics

121

for this cohort are shown in Table 1.

122
123

In total, 112 nasopharyngeal swabs from these patients were processed (Figure 1a):

124

the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene amplified on extracted DNA using 515F and 806R

125

primers, and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform (see Methods). From the same

126

swabs, RNA was extracted to determine SARS-CoV-2 viral loads and to estimate

127

immune cell populations of the host using nCounter (Methods). Of the 112 samples

128

processed and sequenced, 101 yielded over 10,000 amplicon reads that could be

129

assigned to bacteria at the genus level (Figure 1b; Methods). The microbiome of the

130

entire cohort was dominated by the gram-positive genera Staphylococcus and

131

Corynebacterium, typical from the nasal cavity and nasopharynx19.

132
133

Bacterial alpha diversity is strongly associated with ICU stay length

134
135

First, we determined genus-level alpha-diversity for the 101 samples with more than

136

10,000 assigned reads, using Shannon Diversity index (see Methods; Supplementary

137

Table 1). We observed that alpha diversity was not significantly correlated to SARS-

138

CoV-2 viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs (Figure 1c). In contrast, we found the

139

Shannon index to be significantly affected by the sampling moment (Kruskal-Wallis

140

test, p-value = 0.0076; Figure 1d), with significant differences between swabs procured

141

upon patient admission and later timepoints, suggesting an important effect of disease

142

progression and/or treatment (i.e. due to antibiotics administered throughout ICU

143

stay). We explored these differences further, and observed that Shannon Diversity

144

index correlated negatively with the number of days spent in ICU at the moment of

145

sampling, with longer ICU stays leading to a lower diversity (Supplementary Figure 1a;

146

r=-0.55, p-value=4.4·10-9). Furthermore, the observed decrease in diversity occurred

147

mostly over the first 2 weeks in ICU (Supplementary Figure 1a). Other severity

148

indicators, such as the patient clinical status (i.e. a qualitative metric used to classify

149

patients into different levels of disease severity) or the type of oxygen support

150

required at the moment of sampling, showed no association with the genus-level

151

Shannon index (Supplementary Figure 1b,c). Therefore, the differences in diversity

152

observed across samples were likely driven by the time spent in ICU, and not

153

specifically by disease progression as other severity indicators were unaffected.

154
155

Since time in ICU had a major effect in alpha diversity, we explored whether it might

156

be masking any effects of viral load, as SARS-CoV-2 load was not associated with the

157

length of the ICU stay (Supplementary Figure 1d). When controlling for the time in ICU

158

(see Methods), we observed that viral load was negatively associated with the

159

Shannon diversity index (r=-0.26, p-value=0.0089; Supplementary Figure 1e). Other

160

severity indicators such as the clinical status and the type of oxygen support were not

161

correlated to diversity even after controlling for the confounding effect of ICU stay

162

(Kruskal-Wallis test, p-value>0.05).

163
164

Microbiome composition variation is driven by the type of respiratory support

165
166

We next explored potential associations between the upper respiratory genus-level

167

microbiota composition and the extensive metadata collected in the study. In total, 70

168

covariates related to patient anthropometrics, medication and clinical variables

169

measured in the hospital and host cytokine expression measured in the swabs were

170

tested (Supplementary Table 2). Individually, 19 of these covariates showed a

171

significant correlation to microbiota composition (dbRDA, p-value<0.05;FDR<0.05;

172

Figure 2a). These significant covariates were related to disease and measures of its

173

severity, such as the clinical evaluation of the patient, the total length of the ICU stay,

174

the number of days in ICU at the time of sampling, or the type of oxygen support

175

needed by the patient. Surprisingly, the total SARS-CoV-2 viral load detected in the

176

swabs was not significantly associated to microbiome composition variation

177

(Supplementary Table 2).

178
179

Of the 19 significant covariates, only 2 accounted for 48.7% non-redundant variation in

180

this dataset, with the rest holding redundant information. These were the patient ID,

181

included due to the longitudinal sampling of patients, and confirming that intra-

182

individual variation over time is smaller than patient inter-individual variation20, and

183

the type of oxygen support received at the time of sampling (Figure 2a,b). Notably, the

184

type of oxygen support discriminated samples based on ventilation type, with non-

185

invasive ventilation samples (groups 1, 2 and 3) separating from samples from

186

intubated patients (groups 4 to 7; PERMANOVA test, R2=0.0642, p-value=0.001).

187
188

To determine if oxygen support also impacted the microbiome at finer taxonomic

189

resolution, we revisited alpha-diversity at species- and strain-level. We defined species

190

as 97% identity 16S OTUs and strains per species as the clustered 16S sequences

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.23.20248425; this version posted February 7, 2021. The copyright holder for this

191

within each OTU. The species and strain-level diversity per sample were calculated as

192

the number of OTUs and as the mean of the number of strains from five randomly

193

sampled OTU species sampled 1,000 times, respectively. Our analyses revealed both

194

species- and strain-level diversity change with ventilation, even with non-invasive

195

ventilation (e.g. BIPAP, CPAP). Across all samples we observed high species- and low

196

strain-level diversity pre-ventilation, which reversed following any form of ventilation

197

(Figure 2c; Wilcoxon test; p-values<0.05, with the exception of type 7), with the

198

exception of ventilation with inhaled nitric oxide. Further, Species- and strain-level

199

diversity showed a strong inverse correlation (Figure 2d; Pearson’s correlation, R2 = -

200

0.92, p-value = 0.0035).

201
202

Therefore, we evaluated which specific taxa were differentially abundant between

203

samples from intubated and non-intubated patients. In total, 30 genera were more

204

abundant in intubated samples, while 2 genera were more abundant in non-invasively

205

ventilated patients (p-value<0.05;FDR<0.05; Figure 2e, Supplementary Figure 2;

206

Supplementary Table 3). Some of these taxa are common oral microbiome

207

commensals or opportunistic pathogens that had been repeatedly reported as more

208

abundant in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls, such as Prevotella, Veillonella,

209

Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas or Lactobacillus15–17. Here, we reported higher

210

abundance of these genera in intubated COVID-19 patients as compared to non-

211

mechanically ventilated patients. This points at mechanical ventilation as a potential

212

confounder of previous COVID-19 studies. Additionally, we found other taxa not

213

previously reported in previous COVID-19 microbiome studies, such as Mycoplasma or

214

Megasphaera (Figure 2e, Supplementary Figure 2), but previously associated to risk of

215

ventilator-associated pneumonia21.

216
217

By extracting the amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) corresponding to these

218

differentially abundant genera (see Methods), some of these taxa could be narrowed

219

down to the species level, confirming their origin as typically oral bacteria: for

220

instance, Prevotella species included P. oris, P. salivae, P. denticola, P. buccalis and P.

221

oralis. Within the Mycoplasma genus, ASVs were assigned to Mycoplasma salivarium

222

among other species, an oral bacterium which has been previously associated to the

223

incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia21. When controlling for ventilation type,

224

no taxa were found associated to SARS-CoV-2 viral loads. These results show that

225

further research with larger cohorts and controlling for the relevant confounders

226

highlighted here, such as ventilation type or length of stay in ICU, will be needed to

227

study the specific effect of the viral infection.

228
229

Single-cell RNA-seq identifies oral commensals and opportunist pathogens in the

230

lower respiratory tract

231
232

Next, we explored what the functional consequences of (ventilation-driven) lung

233

microbiome disturbances could be. To do so, we screened single-cell RNA-seq data

234

generated on BAL samples of 35 patients22 to identify microbial reads. All patients in

235

this cross-sectional cohort had clinical symptoms of pneumonia, 22 of them being

236

diagnosed with COVID-19. The other 13 patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia were

237

hereafter referred to as controls (Table 1). Microbiome read screening of these

238

samples revealed an average of 7,295.3 microbial reads per sample (ranging from 0 to

239

74,226 reads, with only a single sample yielding zero microbial reads; Supplementary

240

Figure 3).

241
242

Among the top taxa encountered in these patients, we found some similarities with

243

the data obtained in nasopharyngeal swabs. The top 15 species detected include

244

Mycoplasma salivarium as the dominating taxon in 5 COVID-19 patients in ICU, as well

245

as different Prevotella members. Non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients in ward (i.e. non-

246

intubated) harbored different microbes: 2 patients had a microbiome dominated by

247

Porphyromonas gingivalis, while a single patient had a microbiome dominated by the

248

fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii, a known pathogen causing pneumonia23.

249

Supplementary table 4 shows associations between organism abundances and specific

250

patient metadata: disease, hospital stay and ventilation type. Multiple links with

251

COVID-19 diagnosis were identified (Wilcoxon test, (noncorrected) p-value<0.05; see

252

Methods) but due to the low sample number, none was significant after multiple-test

253

correction. Additionally, as hospital stay (ICU or ward), type of oxygen support

254

(invasive or non-invasive ventilation) and disease (COVID-19 or controls) were highly

255

correlated (Chi-squared test, p-value < 0.0001 for all three pairwise correlations), the

256

effect of these three variables could not be disentangled.

257
258

Bacteria in the lower respiratory tract associate to host cells from the innate immune

259

system in COVID-19 patients

260
261

Next, we took advantage of the single-cell barcoding and questioned whether the

262

microbial cells that we identified were found in association with host cells, or

263

contrarily, had unique barcodes suggesting a free-living state. In total, 29,886 unique

264

barcodes were identified that matched a total of 46,151 microbial UMIs. The

265

distribution of UMIs per barcode was asymmetrical, ranging from 1 to 201 and with

266

88% of the barcodes having a single UMI. Additionally, 26,572 barcodes (89%) were

267

associated to a single microbial species, the rest being associated to 2 species (8.8%) or

268

more (2.2%).

269
270

Out of the total 29,886 microbial barcodes, only 2,108 were also assigned to host cells,

271

suggesting that the bulk of bacteria found in BAL samples exist as free-living organisms

272

or in bacterial biofilms. However, for those associated to host cells, the distribution

273

across disease types was not random. We found that while 2.3% of the non-COVID-19

274

patient cells were associated to bacterial cells, almost the double (4%) could be

275

observed in COVID-19 patients (Figure 3a; Chi-squared test; p-value < 2.2·10-16).

276

However, because COVID-19 diagnosis is highly correlated with intubation in this

277

cohort, this effect could be due to higher intubation rates in COVID-19 patients. Within

278

COVID-19 patients, we also evaluated the overlap between bacteria-associated host

279

cells and cells with detected SARS-CoV-2 reads (Supplementary Table 5). Out of 1033

280

host cells associated with bacteria in these patients and 343 cells with detected SARS-

281

CoV-2 reads, only one cell was positive for both. A binomial test for independence of

282

virus and bacteria detection in the same host cell, showed that the observed co-

283

occurrence in one cell only was highly unlikely (p-value=5.7·10-4), therefore suggesting

284

mutual exclusion of microbiome members and viruses in the same host immune cells.

285

286

We also explored whether host-associated bacterial reads would preferentially be

287

linked with specific cell types, taking into account the varying frequencies of cell types

288

in COVID-19 patients and controls (see Methods). Such a preferential association

289

would suggest that these observations are biologically relevant and not an artifact of

290

the single-cell sample and library preparation. Among control patients, cell types were

291

similarly distributed in both groups (i.e. with and without bacteria), with only a

292

preferential association of microbial cells with neutrophils (p-value = 3.61·10-12; Figure

293

3b; Supplementary Figure 4). However, in COVID-19 patients, three cell types were

294

significantly associated with bacteria: neutrophils (p-value < 2.2·10-16), monocytes ((p-

295

value = 4.82·10-5) and monocyte-derived macrophages (p-value < 2.2·10-16; Figure 3b;

296

Supplementary Figure 4). We also found that different bacteria associate with distinct

297

host cells. For instance, in COVID-19 patients, bacteria from the Mycoplasma genus

298

preferentially associated to monocyte-derived macrophages (p-value = 2.28·10-7),

299

while Rothia (p-value = 8.21·10-4), Enterobacter (p-value = 2.59·10-5), or Klebsiella (p-

300

value = 3.12·10-9) are enriched in monocytes (Figure 3c).

301
302

Last, we investigated whether the associations of bacteria to host cells are linked to

303

host cell expression. To do so, we assessed whether expression based cell subtype

304

classification22 for neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages showed non-random

305

associations with bacteria across all samples in this cohort. Among the neutrophils, a

306

subtype of inflammatory neutrophils characterized by expression of the calgranulin

307

S100A12 was enriched in bacteria-associated cells (p-value 7.18·10-6; Figure 3d,e). This

308

subset of cells was also found to be enriched in SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid gene reads22,

309

suggesting that the same cell type responsible for defense against the virus would be

310

responding to potentially invasive bacteria in the lung. This subgroup is characterized

311

by the expression of the calprotectin subunits S100A8 and S100A9. It is known that

312

S100A8/A9 heterodimer secretion is increased in infection-induced inflammation and

313

has some antibacterial effects mediated by secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines,

314

release of reactive oxygen species and recruitment of other inflammatory cells, as well

315

as chelation of Zn2+ necessary for bacterial enzymatic activity24. These mechanisms are

316

mediated by binding of the S100A8/A9 dimer to TLR4 receptors to trigger the release

317

of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-a, and thus may contribute to

318

sustain or exacerbate inflammation25. Therefore, the association with bacteria could,

319

at least in part, explain the inflammatory phenotype of this neutrophil subset. To

320

further examine this hypothesis, we explored differential gene expression between

321

bacteria-associated and non-associated S100A12hi neutrophils (Supplementary Table

322

6). Because association of these cells with SARS-CoV-2 and with bacteria was mutually

323

exclusive, we also compared these changes with the ones triggered by the virus in

324

neutrophils22. Within this subset, neutrophils with co-occurring bacteria showed

325

significantly higher expression (Bonferroni-corrected p-value < 0.05) of pro-

326

inflammatory genes, including the cytokine IL1B and some of its target genes (PTSG2),

327

the transcription factors FOS and JUN, and several genes involved in degranulation

328

(S100A9, FOLR3, HSPA1A, HSP90AA1, FCGR3B), (Supplementary Table 6). Among

329

these, FOLR3, a gene encoding for a folate receptor, is found in neutrophil secretory

330

granules and has antibacterial functions, by binding folates and thus depriving bacteria

331

of these essential metabolites26. This response differed to that of virus-engulfing

332

neutrophils in that IFN response genes are not distinctively upregulated by bacteria.

333
334

Regarding myeloid cells, both inflammatory IL1Bhi monocytes (p-value = 2·10-16) as well

335

as a mixed group of CCL2-expressing macrophages (p-value = 5.38·10-10) are enriched

336

in bacteria-associated cells (Figure 3f). These inflammatory monocytes are believed to

337

have an important role in the cytokine storm occurring in severe COVID-19 patients. In

338

this case, further gene expression patterns were detected, specific for bacteria-

339

associated cells: for CCL2hi macrophages, cells with co-occurring bacteria expressed

340

higher levels of MHC genes of type I and II, suggesting a more active role of these cells

341

in antigen presentation (Bonferroni-corrected p-value < 0.05; Figure 3f; Supplementary

342

Table 6). A similar increase was also observed in monocytes, yet not significant

343

(Supplementary Table 6), possibly due to the lower monocyte abundances in this

344

dataset. Additionally, bacteria-associated macrophages express significantly higher

345

levels of the calprotectin subunits S100A8/A9, similarly to neutrophils, as well as pro-

346

inflammatory chemokines (such as CCL4, CXCL10 and CXCL1).

348

Altogether, our results suggest that the bacteria detected in these cell subsets via

349

scRNA-seq analyses may be contributing to the inflammatory response observed in the

350

host.

Discussion

353
354

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a massive global effort by the scientific

355

community was undertaken to understand physiopathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection

356

and risk factors affecting disease outcome. In this study, we explored the respiratory

357

microbiota as a potential risk factor for disease severity, and we evaluated the upper

358

and lower respiratory tract microbiota in COVID-19 patients throughout their

359

hospitalization. We linked this data to viral load measurements and immunoprofiling

360

results from nCounter and single-cell RNA sequencing data. To assess robustness of

361

previously reported signals, we investigated the effect of potential confounders based

362

on a broad panel of patient metadata variables.

363
364

We found that in the upper respiratory tract, while SARS-CoV-2 viral load has a weak

365

negative association with bacterial biodiversity, a strong effect of severity indicators

366

such as ICU stay was observed, with diversity decreasing throughout the length of the

367

ICU period, a pattern reminiscent of that seen in other pulmonary conditions27,28.

368

This effect of ICU and/or ventilation on microbiome alpha diversity could potentially

369

explain why previous studies on the microbiota of COVID-19 patients show conflicting

370

results regarding diversity: some studies reported lower diversity in sputum or throat

371

swab samples of COVID-19 patients15,16,18 while others focusing on the lower

372

respiratory microbiome using bronchoalveolar fluid samples, showed higher bacterial

373

diversity in COVID-19 patients than in controls17. To further complicate matters, it

374

cannot be excluded that sampling site or processing could also be potential

375

confounders in these studies and/or reflect the different pathologies in the different

376

areas of the respiratory tract.

377
378

We further found that between patient microbiome variation (as measured by genus-

379

level microbial beta-diversity) was also affected by different severity indicators such as

380

the clinical status of the patient, or more importantly the type of oxygen support

381

received, with intubated patients harboring a different microbiota than non-intubated

382

patients. The impact of oxygen support was also reflected at the species- and strain-

383

levels, with intubation causing a significant decrease and increase, respectively, in

384

diversity. We hypothesize that the introduction of forced oxygen may drive the fast

385

extinction of certain microbial species enabling the diversification of existing or newly

386

colonizing species into new strains. Our results suggest that non-invasive ventilation

387

(e.g. BIPAP, CPAP) can have microbial effects indicating that any form of ventilation

388

may be a tipping point for microbial community differences.

389
390

Importantly, several of the taxa reported to change between intubated and non-

391

intubated patients were reported to be linked to diagnosis in previous COVID-19

392

microbiome studies15–17. In our study, no taxa were specifically linked to SARS-CoV-2

393

viral load after controlling for intubation. This result strongly points at the possibility

394

that intubation and mechanical ventilation are confounding previous results. Indeed,

395

one study comparing COVID-19 patients with patients diagnosed of community-

396

acquired pneumonia found no differences in respiratory microbiome composition

397

between both groups of patients, but both groups did differ from healthy controls29.

398

Together, these results indicate that patient intubation or even non-invasive

399

ventilation are to be considered as important confounders when studying the upper

400

respiratory microbiome, and we strongly suggest future COVID-19 microbiome studies

401

should foresee and include strategies to account for this covariate. A recent study

402

found a single ASV corresponding to the genus Rothia that was specific for SARS-CoV-2

403

patients after controlling for ICU-related confounders30.

404
405

To better understand the potential functional consequences of these procedures and

406

linked microbial shifts, we also profiled the microbiome of the lower respiratory tract

407

using single-cell data obtained from a cross-sectional cohort of patients derived from

408

the same hospital. Our results show that ‘standard’ single-cell RNA-seq, even though

409

not optimized for microbial detection and profiling, can identify bacteria alone or in

410

association with specific human cells. Unfortunately, the low numbers of microbial

411

reads obtained in this cohort, together with the fact that ICU stay, COVID-19 diagnosis

412

and intubation are highly correlated in this set of patients, only allow for a descriptive

413

analysis of the results. In this cohort, we identified different oral commensals and

414

opportunistic pathogens previously linked to COVID-19 patients in both groups of

415

samples, thus pointing again at a potential ventilation-linked origin. More interestingly,

416

we identified a subset of bacteria associated with host cells, more specifically with

417

neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages. This enrichment shows that these bacteria

418

are likely not random contaminants, from which an even distribution across cell types

419

(i.e. considering cell type abundances) would be expected. The identity of these host

420

cells suggests that bacteria could have been phagocyted by these innate immune

421

system cells, rather than be attached to the host cell surface. To the best of our

422

knowledge, this is the first study linking interacting host cells and lung microbiome via

423

high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq.

424
425

We find that host cells associated with bacteria, most of which are of oral origin,

426

exhibit pro-inflammatory phenotypes as well as higher levels of MHC for antigen

427

presentation. In this single-cell cohort it was observed that critical COVID-19 patients

428

are characterized by an impaired monocyte to macrophage differentiation, resulting in

429

an excess of pro-inflammatory monocytes, as well as by prolonged neutrophil

430

inflammation22. Given that only these cell types are enriched in bacteria, we

431

hypothesize that the respiratory (or ventilation-linked) microbiome may be playing a

432

role in exacerbating COVID-19 progression in the lower respiratory tract. We verified

433

that this response would likely be driven by bacteria and not SARS-CoV-2, which is also

434

detected mostly in these cell types, as there is almost no overlap in detection of both

435

virus and bacteria in the same cells. However, it must be noted that lack of detection

436

does not completely rule out presence of virus and bacteria within these cells.

437

Therefore, further research is required in order to confirm a causative role of the

438

microbiota in this immune impairment characteristic of critical disease, and to reveal

439

the specific mechanisms involved.

440
441

The presence of oral taxa in the lung microbiota is not unique of disease conditions. It

442

is known that microaspiration, or the aspiration of aerosol droplets originated in the

443

oral cavity, occurs in healthy individuals and can serve as a route for lung colonization

444

of oral commensals31. Such an increase of oral bacteria in the lower respiratory tract

445

could be facilitated when critically ill patients –including but not limited to COVID-19–

446

get intubated. Indeed, oral bacteria have been linked to ventilator-associated

447

pneumonia32,33. It is yet to be elucidated whether COVID-19 physiopathology favors

448

lung colonization by oral bacteria or if, in contrast, a lung microbiome previously

449

colonized by oral microbes could also contribute to the disease. What is known is that

450

an increase of oral bacteria in the lower respiratory tract can result in an increased

451

inflammatory phenotype, even in healthy subjects34

452
453

Conclusion

454
455

Overall, this study provides a systematic analysis of potential confounders in COVID-19

456

microbiome studies. We identified that ICU hospitalization and type of oxygen support

457

had large impacts on the upper respiratory tract microbiome and have the potential to

458

confound clinical microbiome studies. Among the different types of oxygen support we

459

reported the largest shifts in microbial community structure between intubated and

460

non-intubated patients. We found that oral microbiota was strongly enriched in the

461

upper and lower respiratory tracts of intubated COVID-19 patients. Further, in the

462

lower respiratory tract, microbes were strongly associated with specific pro-

463

inflammatory immune cells. This information contributes to a collective body of

464

literature on the pathology of COVID-19 and suggests that careful attention be paid to

465

ICU stay and type of oxygen support when evaluating the role of the lung microbiome

466

on COVID-19 disease progression.

All experimental protocols and data analyses were approved by the Ethics Commission

from the UZ Leuven Hospital, under the COntAGIouS observational clinical trial (study

474

number S63381). The study design is compliant with all relevant ethical regulations,

475

including the Declaration of Helsinki and in the GDPR. All participants gave their

476

informed consent to participate in the study.

477
478

A total of 58 patients from the COntAGIouS observational trial were included as our

479

upper respiratory tract cohort. All patients were admitted to the UZ Leuven hospital

480

with a diagnostic of COVID-19. The disease was diagnosed based on a) a positive qRT-

481

PCR test, performed on admission or previously on other hospitals, when patients

482

were transferred from other medical facilities; or b) a chest CT-scan showing alveolar

483

damage and clinical symptoms of the disease. All patients included in the study were

484

admitted to ICU for a variable amount of time. Nasopharyngeal swabs were taken from

485

these patients at different timepoints throughout ICU stay and after ICU discharge,

486

during recovery in ward. A total of 112 swabs were processed for upper respiratory

487

microbiome characterization (Figure 1a).

488
489

To extend our findings from the upper respiratory tract, we also profiled the lower

490

respiratory tract microbiota in a different cohort22 of 35 patients belonging to the

491

same observational trial and also recruited at UZ Leuven hospital. This cross-sectional

492

cohort is composed by 22 COVID-19 patients and 13 pneumonitis controls with

493

negative qRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, with varying disease severity. Previous data from

494

single-cell RNA-sequencing had been collected for this cohort22. We reanalyzed this

495

single-cell dataset to profile the lower respiratory tract microbiota in these patients.

RNA/DNA extraction and sequencing

499
500

Nucleic acid extraction from the swab samples was performed with AllPrep

501

DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal kit (QIAGEN, catnr. 80224). Briefly, swabs from the

502

potentially infectious samples were inactivated by adding 600µL RLT-plus lysis buffer.

503

To increase bacterial cell lysis efficiency, glass beads and DX reagent (Pathogen Lysis

504

Tubes, QIAGEN, catnr. 19091) were added to the lysis buffer, and samples were

505

disrupted in a FastPrep-24TM instrument with the following program: 1-minute beating

506

at 6.5m/sec, 1-minute incubation at 4°C, 1-minute beating at 6.5m/sec, 1-minute

507

incubation at 4°C. After lysis, the remaining extraction steps followed the

508

recommended protocol from the manufacturer. DNA was eluted in 50µL EB buffer.

509

Amplification of the V4 region of the 16S gene was done with primers 515F and 806R,

510

using single multiplex identifiers and adaptors as previously described35. RNA was

511

eluted in 30µL of nuclease-free water and used for SARS-CoV-2 viral load

512

determination in the swabs as well as to measure inflammatory markers and cytokines

513

and to estimate host cell populations via marker gene expression using nCounter. In

514

brief, raw nCounter data were processed using nSolver 4.0 software (Nanostring),

515

sequentially correcting three factors for each individual sample: technical variation

516

between samples (using spiked positive control RNA), background correction (using

517

spiked negative control RNA) and RNA content variation (using 15 housekeeping

518

genes). We have previously validated nCounter digital transcriptomics for

519

simultaneous quantification of host immune and viral transcripts36, including

520

respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirates, even with low RNA yield37–39.

521
522

DNA sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq instrument, generating paired-

523

end reads of 250 base pairs.

524
525

For quality control, reads were demultiplexed with LotuS v1.56540 and processed

526

following the DADA2 microbiome pipeline using the R packages DADA241 and

527

phyloseq42. Briefly, reads were filtered and trimmed using the parameters truncQ=11,

528

truncLen=c(130,200), and trimLeft=c(30, 30) and then denoised. After removing

529

chimeras, amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) table was constructed and taxonomy was

530

assigned using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier implemented in DADA2

531

(RDP trainset 16/release 11.5). The abundance table was then corrected for copy

532

number, rarefied to even sampling depth, and decontaminated. For decontamination,

533

we used the prevalence-based contaminant identification method in the R package

534

decontam43.

16S statistical analysis

538

All the analyses were performed using R v3.6.0 and the packages vegan44, phyloseq42,

539

CoDaSeq45, DESeq246, Biostrings47, rstatix48 and DECIPHER49.

540
541

To analyze the 16S amplicon data, technical replicates were pooled and counts from

542

technical replicates were added. For all the analyses using genus-level agglomerated

543

data, only samples containing more than 10,000 reads assigned at the genus level

544

were used (101 samples in total). Alpha-diversity was analyzed using Shannon’s

545

Diversity Index. Comparison of the alpha diversity values across different groups was

546

performed using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for 2-group comparisons, and Kruskal-

547

Wallis tests for comparisons across multiple groups. In the latter case, pairwise

548

comparisons (when applicable) were performed using Dunn post-hoc tests. To de-

549

confound for the effect of the ICU length, we fitted a quadratic model between the

550

days spent at ICU and the Shannon index using the lm function in R. The residuals of

551

this model were used to test the association with the SARS-CoV-2 viral load.

552
553

Beta diversity analyses were performed using distance-based redundancy analyses

554

(RDA), using Euclidean distances on CLR-transformed data. RDA analyses were

555

performed using the capscale function from vegan. Non-redundant contribution to

556

variation was calculated using the ordiR2step function from vegan, using only the

557

variables that were significant individually in the RDA, and a null model without any

558

explanatory variables. For these analyses, taxa with prevalence lower than 10% were

559

excluded. Metadata variables containing dates, as well as non-informative metadata

560

(containing a single non-NA value or unique for only one patient) were also excluded.

561
562

Differential taxa abundance analyses were performed using DESeq2’s likelihood ratio

563

tests and controlling for potential confounders when indicated, including them in the

564

null model. All statistical tests are two-sided, and when multiple tests were applied to

565

the different features (e.g. the differential taxa abundances across two conditions) p-

566

values were corrected for multiple testing using Benjamini-Hochberg’s method.

567
568

In order to explore species-level and strain-level diversity, 16S sequences were first

569

clustered into 97% nucleotide diversity operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using the R

570

packages Biostrings and DECIPHER. These OTUs were used to represents the species-

571

level. The number of unique 16S sequences clustered within each OTU were used to

572

represent the number of detectable strains per species. To calculate strain-level

573

diversity per sample, the number of strains of 5 detected OTU species were randomly

574

selected and averaged. This was repeated 1,000x and the average of the all 1,000

575

subsamplings was used as the final strain-level diversity value for each sample, as

576

previously described50. To account for uneven sampling assessing diversity differences

577

based on different parameters, we randomly selected and averaged the species- and

578

strain-level diversity of 5 samples per parameter. This was repeated 100x and the

579

subsamplings were used to assess the significant differences between species- and

580

strain-level diversity across the parameters. The average was of all 100 subsamplings

581

was used to as the input for a Pearson’s correlation between species- and strain-level

582

diversity.

584

Identification of microbial reads in BAL scRNA-seq data

585
586

Single-cell data was processed with an in-house pipeline to identify microbial reads.

587

Only read 2, containing the information on the cDNA, was used. Trimmomatic51 (v0.38)

588

was used to remove trim low quality bases and discard short reads. Additionally,

589

Prinseq++52 (v1.2) was used to discard reads with low-complexity stretches. Following

590

quality control, reads from human and potential sequencing artifacts (phage phiX174)

591

were mapped with STAR53 (v2.7.1) and discarded. The remaining reads were mapped

592

against bacterial genomes using a 2-step approach: first, we scanned the reads using

593

mash screen54 (v2.0) against a custom database of 11685 microbial reference genomes

594

including bacteria, archaea, fungi and viruses. Genomes likely to be present in the

595

analyzed sample (selected using a threshold of at least two shared hashes from mash

596

screen) were selected and reads were pseudoaligned to this subset of genomes using

597

kallisto55 (v0.44.0). To remove potential artifacts, two additional filters were applied:

598

first, if less than 10 different functions were expressed from a given species, the

599

species was discarded. Second, if one function accounted for more than 95% of the

600

mapped reads of a given species, it was also discarded. These filters were aimed at

601

removing potential artifacts caused by contamination or errors in the genome

602

assemblies used in our database.

603
604

Differences in lower respiratory tract microbial taxa between COVID-19 patients and

605

controls, ICU and ward patients, and invasive and non-invasive ventilation types were

606

calculated using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests on centered-log-ratio (CLR)-transformed

607

data. Prior to CLR data transformation, we filtered the data using the CoDaSeq.filter

608

function, to keep samples with more than 1,000 reads and taxa with a relative

609

abundance above 0.1%. Zeros were imputed using the minimum proportional

610

abundance detected for each taxon. This more lenient approach than the one used for

611

16S data was chosen due to the low number of samples available and the reduced

612

number of bacterial reads identified per sample.

613
614

Bacterial reads were assigned their specific barcodes and UMIs as follows: IDs from the

615

mapped microbial reads were retrieved from the kallisto pseudobam output, and used

616

to retrieve their specific barcodes and UMIs using the raw data files from read 1,

617

assigning each barcode and UMI univocally to a microbial species and function.

Direct associations between bacteria and host cells

Host single-cell transcriptomics data was obtained from the Seurat56 object after

preprocessing and integrating the samples of the single-cell cohort, as described

623

previously22. From the Seurat object, the metadata was extracted, including the

624

information on patient group (COVID-19 or control) and severity of the disease

625

(moderate or critical) as well as cell type and subtype annotation corresponding to

626

each barcode. Enrichment of bacteria detected in patient groups or cell types was

627

calculated using chi-squared tests, with effect sizes determined via the standardized

628

residuals. Significance was assessed via post-hoc tests using the R package

629

chisq.posthoc.test57.

630
631

For cell types showing an enrichment in associated bacteria, a new Seurat object was

632

created by subsetting the specific cell type. Chi-squared tests were also used to

633

determine enrichment of bacteria-associated cell subtypes. Previous annotations of

634

cell subtypes22 were used to generate new clusters manually and identify marker

635

genes for these subtypes, using the function findAllMarkers from Seurat. This function

636

was also used to find differentially expressed genes between bacteria-associated and

637

not-bacteria-associated host cells of each subtype. When using this function, reported

638

adjusted p-values are calculated using Bonferroni correction by default.
