Abstract
Background: Various levels of lockdown implemented to contain the rapid spread of COVID-19 are not
long-term solutions due to socioeconomic implications.
Methods: To inform safe reopening, we used an augmented SEIR model to project the impact of 1)
interventions and potential new epidemic trajectories arising from super spreader (SS) events and/or
international travel and 2) re-introducing strong behavioural interventions on resurgence trajectories.
Results: Our model suggests that 50% behaviour intervention effectiveness (BIE) (from enforced social
distancing during lockdown, early in the epidemic), along with 50% isolation intervention effectiveness
(IIE) (from increased testing and isolating infected individuals) was achieved during lockdown, which
curbed COVID-19 transmission in Malaysia. Post-lockdown, BIE plays a minimal role if IIE reaches or
exceeds 46.9% when other variables are held constant. At IIE of 30% and BIE of 21.3%, SS events of
5,000 active cases risks COVID-19 resurgence, with 4-year projected 12.9mn cumulative cases and
1.1mn deaths. Earlier action to increase BIE to 50% on day 98 compared to day 111, prevented an
additional 21,401 recovered cases and 257 deaths.
Conclusion: Until a safe and effective vaccine is widely available, the risk of COVID-19 resurgence from
large SS events warrants caution in decisions to allow for mass gatherings and regular international travel.

1. Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020
[1]. The COVID-19 case fatality rate (CFR)—ranges from 0.47% to over 13% [2], and varies
significantly by demographics, geographic location, and testing and healthcare capacity [3]. Compared to
earlier coronavirus diseases, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the SARS outbreak in
2003-2004, COVID-19 is highly contagious [4,5]. Despite only emerging late in 2019, as of 22 October
2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has reached over 200 countries and territories, and over 41 million cases
have been diagnosed [2].
In Malaysia, the first COVID-19 cases occurred between 24 January 2020 and 27 February 2020
amounting to 23 cases, mainly due to infected individuals arriving from overseas [6]. Community
transmission of COVID-19 began on 27 February 2020, and after a number of individuals who attended
an international gathering of more than 16,000 people at the Seri Petaling mosque were confirmed with
COVID-19 [7], the potential scale of the epidemic in Malaysia became apparent, and the government
announced a 'movement control order' (MCO), which for the purposes of this article is termed as a
'lockdown'. Different iterations and phases of the lockdown have been implemented since 18 March 2020
[8], and currently the recovery phase (due to last until 31 December 2020) has significant ease in
restrictions such as opening of all businesses that can adhere to social distancing and resumption of
interstate travel.
Previous studies by the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research (MIER) and JP Morgan, independently
estimated that Malaysia would reach a peak number of 5,070 and 6,300 active cases by mid-April,
respectively [9], while another study using three different modelling methods suggested peak numbers of
up to 22,000 active cases for Malaysia’s COVID-19 epidemic may be reached between mid-April and
end-May [10]. In reality, Malaysia recorded a lower peak of 2,596 active cases on 5 April 2020 [2,11].
Despite the unprecedented sudden disruptions in travel, economy, education and daily life for billions of
people [12], the drastic social distancing measures appears to have avoided overwhelming the healthcare
system and arguably, averted many preventable deaths.
Despite loosened restrictions, and reopening of domestic businesses from 13 May 2020 [8], Malaysia
maintained relatively low rates of COVID-19 transmission. At the time of writing, Malaysia is
experiencing a resurgence of cases, primarily within state prisons and communities in some states in the
country [13]. As Malaysia and other countries continue to consider removing further restrictions,

particularly regarding mass gatherings and international travel, modelling exercises can be useful to
manage uncertainty and inform decisions while the pandemic continues to unfold without the availability
of an effective vaccine. Thus, this study presents an augmented SEIR model to outline COVID-19
transmission trends calibrated on Malaysian data, aimed at 1) projecting transmission trends postlockdown, to gauge potential new epidemic trajectories arising from super spreaders and/or international
travel and 2) assessing the impact of re-introducing strong behavioural measures on trajectories of any
subsequent epidemic waves.

2. Methods
2.1. Parameters
The model is constructed with static parameters, which are kept constant, and dynamic
parameters with values that are varied throughout the period of the modelling exercise (Figure 1). Static
parameters represent variables whose values do not change with time, but is based on population specific
features. These include basic reproduction number (R0), incubation duration, symptomatic infection
duration, and presymptomatic transmission, which were obtained based on literature review. In addition,
other static parameters such as initial susceptible population, number of imported cases, isolation reaction
time, fraction of COVID-19 patients needing intensive care (ICU), untreated CFR, recovery duration and
duration before death; were obtained and/or estimated based on existing publicly available information.
Dynamic parameters include treated CFR, testing capacity (as opposed to testing rate) (Figure S1), critical
care capacity (Figure S2), and super spreaders, which were based on reports from government agencies
and secondary sources, and behaviour intervention effectiveness (BIE), and isolation intervention
effectiveness (IIE), which were determined by authors for scenario projection purposes (Table S1).
Specifically, we attempt to model the scale of change arising from interventions and SS events on
population transmission dynamics. For the purpose of this analysis, BIE reflects the effect of practices
such as social/physical distancing (with the strictest version of distancing observed under lockdown),
wearing masks, and frequent hand washing; IIE reflects testing, contact tracing and isolation of infected
persons. Both parameters of effectiveness are constructed using a proportional effectiveness scale of 0%
(least effective) to 100% (fully effective). Additionally, although various definitions exist for the term
super spreader(s) cluster/event/episode [14], here we define ‘super spreaders (SS)’ as a typically large
cluster of active cases within one to two infection generations that unpredictably arise due to various
biological, host and environmental factors such as large congregations or from imported cases i.e.

international arrivals who test positive for COVID-19 within quarantine period [15]. We also do not
model the transmission dynamics within SS clusters or events themselves.

2.2 Model features and key assumptions
This study uses an SEIR model (Figure 1), built using System Dynamics on Vensim by Ventana Systems,
adopted from a basic model built by Tom Fiddaman of Ventana Systems [16]. The model was augmented
to include presymptomatic transmission, SS events, testing capacity, a scaling up of critical care beds,
BIE and IIE set at different levels pre- and post-lockdown, and BIE set at different levels to allow for
simulating earlier and later action (Figure S3). In addition, the density of social networks was removed
due to data limitations while the impact of seasons was removed, as Malaysia is a tropical country.

Figure 2. Compartments of augmented SEIR model.
Key assumptions of the model include: 1) homogeneous mixing, whereby all individuals have equal
characteristics, and equal susceptibility to infection, morbidity and mortality, despite the fact that agestructure, comorbidity prevalence, and differences due to social structures or geographies in the
population are known to influence disease spread and outcomes [3]; 2) all active cases are isolated
through hospitalization, and there are no COVID-19 re-infections or waning immunity, despite some
reports suggesting reinfections are possible [17]; 3) asymptomatic (as opposed to presymptomatic) cases
do not influence transmission, as it remains unclear to what extent they contribute to the spread of the
disease [18–20]; 4) R0 is 3.9, based on average Malaysian household size of 3.9 [21,22]; 5) hospital strain
is defined as the fraction of severe cases requiring care at the intensive care unit (ICU), estimated by the
number of ICU beds in COVID-19 admitting public hospitals and used to determine CFR, whereby when
ICU capacity is exceeded, the CFR would converge at a higher level where ICU treatment becomes
unavailable as was seen in countries like Italy and Spain [2] and 6) effectiveness of interventions,
specifically BIE from implementation of and adherence to the lockdown was constant over specific
periods of time (i.e. during and post- strict lockdown), although in reality there were different levels of
movement restriction and compliance at different times.

2.3 Model testing and projections of super spreader events
Sensitivity analysis was conducted on the final model to assess robustness and identify parameters and
parameter values that have the highest impact on model trends. The baseline model was then
benchmarked against publicly available data from the Ministry of Health (MOH) Malaysia [2,11].
To project scenarios of potential resurgence, the model was seeded with various sizes of SS events on day
77 since community transmission began (13 May 2020, post-strict lockdown), while alternating IIE and
BIE at different levels, to observe the impact on COVID-19 trajectories over a 4-year period.
Then, to observe the impact of strong interventions such as lockdowns on a subsequent COVID-19 wave,
the model was seeded with various sizes of SS events on day 89 since community transmission began (25
May 2020). Day 89 was chosen for this analysis because this was when Malaysia experienced an uptick in
cases due to immigration detention depot clusters, thus providing a counterfactual to our model results. A
higher BIE (lasting for 14 days) was then introduced at an earlier timepoint (day 98) and a later timepoint
(day 111) post-lockdown.

3. Results and Discussion

3.1 Model calibration to Malaysian COVID-19 epidemic curve suggests effectiveness of behaviour
intervention
After calibration, the trend of active cases and deaths projected by the augmented SEIR model was
comparable to Malaysia's epidemic curve, with minor exceptions. The model’s projected peak was 2,630
isolated cases on 29 March 2020 and cumulative number of deaths at 166 cases, while Malaysia recorded
a peak of 2,596 active cases on 5 April 2020 and cumulative number of deaths at 125 cases as of 17
August 2020 (Figure 3a). The data suggests that the implementation of behaviour interventions,
specifically the lockdown, had a significant impact in reducing the peak and increasing the rate of
declining cases. This appears in line with the effect of lockdowns to suppress the initial wave of COVID19 community transmissions taken by countries such as China [23,24], and even on subsequent waves
such as in Victoria, Australia [25], specifically international travel restrictions and workplace closure,
which appears to reduce the R0 [26], rapidly bringing down the number of new and active cases of
COVID-19, and reducing mortality [27].

Figure 3. a) Calibration of model at baseline compared to Malaysian MOH data on active cases and total
deaths; b) Projected daily active cases and deaths over 4-years at threshold, and below threshold IIE when
BIE is at 0%. Note: *Some states had started to ease restrictions as early as 1 May 2020.

The calibration of the baseline model to the data further suggest that isolation and behaviour interventions
likely achieved up to 50% effectiveness during the lockdown. However, these numbers do not reflect
specific interventions, and they are not comparable numeric measurements of effectiveness. Instead IIE
and BIE represent the summative effect of various actions that reduce the risk of infected persons from
spreading the disease, and uninfected persons from being exposed to the disease, respectively.
Furthermore, the model suggests that when IIE exceeds 46.9%, the number of deaths converge sublinearly at the treated CFR of 1.7% (Figure 3b), and at higher levels of IIE, changes to the BIE has
minimal influence on projections of active cases or deaths. Conversely, reducing IIE below 46.9% while
holding the BIE at 0% appears to push the model into different dynamics where a majority of the
population become infected with COVID-19, and the trend of active, recovered and deaths scale superlinearly at the untreated CFR. This underscores the idea that testing and isolation should remain the key
strategies in controlling COVID-19.

Additionally, maintaining sufficiently high levels of IIE reduces risk of resurgence post-lockdown even at
minimum BIE. This perhaps reflects the ability of countries such as South Korea and Taiwan which have
been able to control COVID-19 primarily through ramping up early testing, contact tracing and isolation
relative to the size of its outbreak, without undergoing a full lockdown [28,29]. However, the importance
of strong behavioural interventions early in the epidemic to flatten the curve cannot be discounted as the
enforcement of strict border controls and lockdown early are known to have played a crucial role in
controlling transmissions as seen in China and a number of countries across sub-Saharan Africa [30–32].
One caveat, however, is the fact that IIE and BIE are treated as separate parameters in the model. This
neglects the reality that restrictions in civilian movement likely influence the effectiveness of contact
tracing and isolation. Additionally, although BIE was likely not constant, we deduced it reached 50%
once compliance to lockdown was reportedly 95%, based on model calibration exercises [33], and was
maintained at 50% until the end of strict lockdown. And although IIE was likely not constant and much
lower than 50% at the beginning of lockdown compared to its end, we tried to account for this by having
testing capacity scaled over time to reach max capacity from 6,210 tests – 36,812 tests.
Highlighting a clear limitation of the homogeneity assumption in SEIR modelling, the model was unable
to sufficiently project the effects of a second lower peak on 6 June 2020, which arose from outbreaks
among mainly undocumented foreign workers at a number of immigration detention depots in the
country. As the outbreaks occurred in populations that were significantly isolated from the larger
community, it is likely that the rapid rise in new transmissions was able to be controlled much faster using
intensified targeted approaches, resulting in the rapid drop to less than 1000 active cases by 14 June 2020
[34]. Additionally, the model was unable to account for a change in patient discharge criteria, based on an
updated WHO recommendation to release patients from isolation without requiring re-testing published
on 27 May 2020 [35], which resulted in a rapid decline in active cases after 12 June 2020 [36].

3.2 At minimum isolation and behaviour intervention effectiveness, a super spreader cluster above 2,000
cases risks COVID-19 resurgence and overwhelming the healthcare system
The second peak due to outbreaks across immigration detention depots highlighted the potential for new
clusters or super spreaders that may occur to drive new waves of COVID-19 in the country, particularly
with further ease in restrictions and changes to policies on mass gatherings, and policies on international
travel and/or on quarantine of overseas travellers. Additionally, several studies increasingly highlight the
role of SS events, particularly those arising from social settings, in driving the bulk of transmissions
[37,38]. Hence, we attempted to model these potential super spreaders of varying sizes, under scenarios of

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.29.20222224; this version posted October 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

varying levels of BIE (with IIE held constant at 30%), and their potential to cause a subsequent wave that
may warrant strong measures to avoid overwhelming the health system.
Based on this analysis, SS events of up to 2,000 new active cases may still be manageable by the current
health system, with the 4-year projected number of recovered (cumulative number of infected patients
who survived) varying from 19,425 to 273,953 people and deaths varying from 243 to 3,301 people,
assuming that BIE is between 40% and 21.3%. Beyond these numbers, a SS event size of 5,000 or
26,000, assuming that BIE at the time ranged from 21.3% to 40%, results in 136,342 recovered and 1,648
death cases or 12,924,200 recovered and 1,097,860 death cases, respectively (Table 1). Above the
threshold SS event size or above 2,000 cases under Malaysia's current scenario, the BIE has significant
influence on the long-term COVID-19 trajectory. Specifically, at BIE of 40%, a super spreader cluster
size of 26,000 cases results in a CFR of 1.2%, while at BIE of 21.3%, a SS event size of 5,000 cases
results in a higher CFR of 7.8%.
Given the socioeconomic costs of lockdowns and difficulty to maintain compliance with social distancing
and required self-isolation over longer periods of time [39], countries may prevent resurgence by avoiding
situations that enable surpassing the threshold super spreader numbers, which may arise from large
gatherings and/or imported cases. To date, policies in managing the risk of imported cases, which include
mandatory quarantine at government approved lodging and screening tests appear to be effective in
managing the spread of the disease from import cases. Thus far other countries that have maintained strict
border control and/or strict quarantine such as Singapore, New Zealand, South Korea and Hong Kong
have avoided significant resurgence in cases, while other countries such as the UK, Spain and Germany
with less rigorous testing and control of influx of international travellers appear to be having rapid
increase in cases post-lockdown [40]. That said, such measures are likely insufficient to address border
entries through undocumented channels, which is compounded with difficulty to detect infected
individuals until an outbreak becomes more apparent as is the case with Malaysia.
Similarly, large conferences, and other mass gatherings including regular religious and community events
such as congregational prayers and weddings that may garner up to 1,000 to tens of thousands of
attendees, pose significant risk for resurgence. In particular, large events that host international and/or
interstate participants increases mixing of previously separated people carrying different strains of the
virus [41], raising the risk of sparking SS events and dispersing new clusters, which may spark another
large COVID-19 wave that may overwhelm the health system. Such risks are heightened by the
possibility of presymptomatic transmissions from COVID-19 infected persons as early as 3 days before
the appearance of symptoms [20,42,43], and the increasing burden and decreasing effectiveness in tracing
very large groups of contacts [29,44].

Conversely, the model also suggests that the threshold super spreader cluster size that remains
manageable by the health system can be as high as 26,000 cases, depending on what is viewed as an
acceptable range of recovered and death cases, what is the presumed BIE level (perhaps due to strict
observance of physical distancing and mask wearing) at a particular period, and whether the number of
critical care beds could be increased. Regardless, until an effective vaccine becomes available, mass
gatherings, international travel and re-opening of borders require careful deliberation and targeted
policies.

3.3. Impact of strong and earlier action on trajectories in the event of COVID-19 resurgence
Many countries imposed lockdowns to 'flatten the curve', i.e. to prevent a large number of new infections
and spread them over a longer period of time to allow healthcare systems to cope with influx of COVID19 patients, and prevent fatalities that would otherwise occur due to an overwhelmed healthcare system.

However, while the baseline model calibrated to Malaysian COVID-19 data shows the positive impact of
the lockdown on reducing COVID-19 transmission, the restrictions imposed have significant
socioeconomic costs [45,46] and ramifications on mental health and wellbeing for societies at large [47].
Thus, although governments may be cautious to re-introduce a lockdown after reopening and achieving
low rates of COVID-19 transmission, this modelling exercise reaffirms the need for implementing strong
actions such as lockdowns and doing so earlier rather than later should a subsequent COVID-19 wave
arise from large super spreaders.
In the event of a COVID-19 resurgence, whereby BIE is assumed to be 21.3%, implementing the
lockdown reduces cumulative cases by 13.5 million people, and deaths by 1.1 million people across a 4year period (Table 2), with projections varying according to BIE.
However, a key issue in implementing a lockdown is the level of enforcement and timing, and early
strong action has been argued to have more significant impact compared to delayed or ineffective action
[48]. In this model, we assume that early strong action equals to imposing a strict lockdown 9.2 days after
index case in a super spreader event is determined, while delayed action equals to 22.2 days, or 13 days
later. Delay in taking strong actions may cost between 5,084 and 27,629 additional COVID-19 cases and
an additional 60 to 328 deaths, depending on the size of the super spreader and assumed levels of BIE.
While there appears to be discrepancy of numbers of active/isolated cases and deaths projected for earlier
versus later lockdown implementation compared to the numbers of active/isolated cases and deaths
projected for lockdown versus no lockdown, the former may be a more reliable projection. Modelling
scenarios of a lockdown versus no lockdown does not consider timepoint of action, and only looks at the
cumulative impact in four years, which is arguably more susceptible to various unpredictable factors over
time, and unlikely to be observed given that governments are likely to take mitigatory action. Comparing
earlier versus later implementation of a lockdown relative to timepoint along the epidemic curve, may be
more useful as it illustrates when the decision to intervene may change trajectories, and to what extent.
Nevertheless, the purpose of this exercise is not to predict or estimate numbers of cases, particularly on
the difference observed when projections made at behaviour intervention effectiveness of 21.3% (~13mn)
and or 40% (~17k). Instead, we aim to show the scale of change on the trajectories depending on the time
of the decision point to enforce strong actions such as lockdowns. While we explored the impact of
timing of strong actions to mitigate resurgence post-lockdown, our findings also reiterate the point that
earlier action may have played an even bigger role earlier in the epidemic. This is because enforcing
lockdown early enough in the epidemic to increase BIE, provides the opportunity for IIE to increase
(which requires time to accumulate sufficient knowledge, resources and capacity). Because COVID-19 is

now known to be highly overdispersed, in which a small fraction of infected people could be responsible
for approximately 80% of transmissions [38], high IIE post-lockdown halts infected persons with high
potential for sparking super spreader clusters and controls the epidemic more effectively compared to
BIE. This also enables countries to reduce restrictions on general population behaviour, allowing the
resumption of domestic mobility and socioeconomic activities without necessarily causing a subsequent
COVID-19 wave, as long as effective testing and isolation strategies are maintained, and situations that
exceed the threshold cluster sizes are avoided.
That said the model is limited in its ability to capture the potential influence of changing trajectories of
COVID-19 on both BIE and IIE. For example, while there may be a scenario where transmissions post
26,000-case super spreaders remains within SEIR dynamics at IIE of 30% and BIE of 40%, arguably at
such high levels of community transmission, the effectiveness of these interventions will likely be
reduced. Active case numbers post-lockdown in the model is much lower than what is recorded by the
Malaysian MOH, which would affect the impact of the IIE and BIE values on scenario projections. These
caveats necessitate more conservative interpretations and framing discussions on trends of COVID-19
arising from super spreaders and consequent actions taken to mitigate these based on the projections of
additional positive and death cases at the lower bound of 21.3% BIE.
Other key limitations in this modelling exercise include 1) heterogeneity factors such as age,
comorbidities, and social structure and geographies, and economic implications of interventions, were not
included in the model; 2) whether the index case in an SS event is from local transmission or an imported
case (potentially carrying different strains of the virus with different virulence and transmission capability
[41] is not directly considered. In particular, the variation in propensity for different individuals to spread
and disperse disease or spark new clusters, and poor characterisation of the role of typically asymptomatic
children in transmitting disease [3], are significant limitations in projecting longer-term disease trends.
Ultimately, the model could be improved with more granular information on the local dynamics of the
disease, transmission, and healthcare system.

4. Conclusions
This study attempted to model the longer-term impact of COVID-19 super spreaders that may potentially
arise from mass congregations and international travel, and the value of strong early action, such as
imposing lockdown, on changing epidemic trajectories. While the model presented here has been
contextualized to the Malaysian COVID-19 epidemic, our analysis is well-aligned with others that have
previously reported the pivotal role of testing and isolation strategies and the importance of maintaining

high levels of their effectiveness. The recent resurgence of COVID-19 in several cities that had previously
contained the spread of the virus reiterates the importance of managing potential sizes of super spreaders
that may result in subsequent epidemic waves, and the value of early action. As countries continue to
consider safe strategies of re-opening and easing restrictions in the absence of accessible, safe and
effective vaccines, the findings of this study argue for maintaining caution in decisions pertaining to mass
gatherings and/or regular international travel to avoid enabling large super spreader clusters of COVID-19
cases to arise, which may necessitate re-imposition of stronger and socioeconomically costly action such
as lockdowns.
