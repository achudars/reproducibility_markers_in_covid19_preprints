Background:
While considerable clinical and epidemiological data have been published during the 2019 novel coronavirus
disease (COVID-19) pandemic,1 public health policies determining the duration quarantine and return to work for
confirmed patients are still hampered by a lack of evidence. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) of upper respiratory specimens remains the primary detection method for COVID-19.2–4 Initial
studies have reported a median duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA positivity ranging 9.5-20 days from symptom
onset5–7 and a median duration of two days in seven asymptomatic patients.6 An additional study found that 90% of
patients with mild disease achieved viral clearance by ten days from symptom onset.3 We report our findings
regarding viral RNA positivity duration among a cohort of young patients with mild disease.

Materials and Methods
Study Population
Between March 20th, 2020, and May 10th, 2020, 219 soldiers were admitted to the Israel Defense Forces Medical
Corps (IDF-MC) COVID-19 rehabilitation center following a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, acquired
from an oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swab. Recovery was defined as two sequential negative RT-PCR results,
after which soldiers were discharged. We retrospectively reviewed patient clinical records and RT-PCR results to
determine the duration of SARS-CoV-2 positivity, defined as the period between symptom onset and the first of two
consecutive negative RT-PCR tests. For this study, we included recovered patients who presented mild symptoms
and excluded patients who were asymptomatic, developed moderate disease or were lost to follow-up (Criteria
available in the Supplementary Appendix).
Data Collection

The medical staff at the rehabilitation center made telephone contact with patients upon receiving the
initial positive RT-PCR results. Patient demographics, epidemiology, medical history, and symptoms
were gathered upon initial contact and documented in the IDF Computerized Patient Records (CPR), and
a separate database created for monitoring admitted patients. Upon admission to the rehabilitation center,
patients filled an additional online questionnaire detailing demographic data along with current symptoms

and vitals. During their stay at the rehabilitation center, monitoring physicians performed and documented
daily telephone follow-up in an attempt to investigate symptom progression identify patients requiring
further care. Patients who developed complications or experienced significant disease progression were
referred to local tertiary hospitals for further care (Supplementary index).
Specimen Collection and Viral RNA Detection of SARS-CoV-2

Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained by specially trained IDF medics, paramedics or
medical school students. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained within 48 hours of
being asymptomatic. In the case of a negative result, an additional swab was obtained within 48 hours. If
a positive result followed a negative one, additional swabs were obtained until two consecutive negative
results were received.
Definitions

Recovery was defined as two sequential negative RT-PCR results, after which admitted soldiers were
discharged. The primary outcome of time to viral RNA clearance was defined as the time period between
symptom onset and the first of two consecutive negative RT-PCR tests. This duration was then
calculated with stratification for age, sex, and reported symptoms.
Statistical Analysis

Continuous variables are described as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) or means with standard
deviations as deemed appropriate. Dichotomous variables such as the presence of symptoms are
expressed as percentages. The date was aggregated in a dedicated spreadsheet and deidentified for the
purpose of statistical analysis. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 positivity was assessed using Kaplan-Meier
curves. The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 25.0 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp).

Ethical Considerations

The study was approved by the IDF-MC institutional ethics committee, which waived the requirement for
informed consent.

Results
Between March 20th, 2020 and May 10th, 2020, 119 symptomatic patients with two consecutive negative swabs were
admitted to the IDF COVID-19 rehabilitation center, 84 (70.6%) males, 35 (29.4%) females with a median age of 21
(IQR 19-25). Symptoms reported upon admission included cough (75 [63.0%]), loss of smell (61 [51.3%]),
headache (48 [40.3%]), loss of taste (47 [39.5%]) and fever (45 [37.8%]). 67 patients (56.36%) did not have any
notable medical history (Supplementary Appendix). The clinical characteristics of the study population are detailed
in Table 1.
The median time for SARS-CoV-2 positivity in nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs in the study population was
21 days (IQR 15-27) from symptom onset, with a range of 4 to 45 days (Figure 1). The median time for viral RNA
clearance stratified according to presenting symptom is detailed in Table 1.

Discussion
Determining the viral dynamics and natural history of SARS-CoV-2 in different populations is crucial towards
instituting public health policies and granting clearance for infected patients. The results of this study suggest that in
young and healthy adult patients with COVID-19, the median duration of viral positivity is around three weeks. This
duration is higher than previous reports of a median between 9.5 and 20 days.5–7 These differences may arise from
differing study populations, test kits, and procedures. We postulate that the settings in the rehabilitation center,
which allowed for patients with mild symptoms to dwell in close quarters with other confirmed patients, may have
brought about daily re-exposure and prolonged viral positivity durations.
Our study adds to the current knowledge concerning the COVID-19 outbreak and sheds light on the duration of RTPCR positivity in young patients with mild symptoms. Seeing as young and healthy adults comprise much of the
population workforce, the results of this study may assist in determining the isolation period for symptomatic adults
and confirmed COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms.
Furthermore, we believe that achieving serial RT-PCR testing for all confirmed patients or outpatients with mild
symptoms would require vast resource consumption. Therefore, achieving a further understanding of viral dynamics
could help determine the correct temporality of testing for confirmed patients experiencing recovery.
It should be noted that negative RT-PCR testing does not necessarily dictate full clearance as both false-negative
results2,4,8 and persistence of radiological abnormalities9 have been described. Additionally, the detection of SARSCoV-2 in bodily fluids does not necessarily render an individual contagious.
Our study is limited by its small sample size and needs to be replicated on a mass scale to shed implications on the
general population. It should also be noted that all patients in our cohort were symptomatic, and population
screening efforts are required to determine the rate of disease and spread by asymptomatic individuals.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the median time for SARS-CoV-2 clearance is around three weeks in
young adults with mild symptoms. These findings may provide evidence for instituting quarantine and return to
work policies in settings primarily composed of young and healthy adults such as higher education institutions, highschools and the military.
