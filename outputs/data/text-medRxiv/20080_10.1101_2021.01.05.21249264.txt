Abstract: There are very few estimates of the age-specific infection fatality rate (IFR) of SARSCoV-2 in low- and middle-income countries. India reports the second highest number of SARSCoV-2 infections in the world. We estimate age-specific IFR using data from seroprevalence
surveys in Mumbai (population 12 million) and Karnataka (population 61 million), and a random
sample of economically distressed migrants in Bihar with mortality followup. Among men aged
50–89, IFR is 0.12% in Karnataka (95% C.I. 0.09%–0.15%), 0.53% in Mumbai (0.52%–0.54%),
and 5.64% among migrants in Bihar (0–11.16%). IFR in India is approximately twice as high for
men as for women, is heterogeneous across contexts, and rises much less at older ages than in
comparable studies from high income countries.

Measurement of the infection fatality rate (IFR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been a major objective for researchers since the beginning of
the global pandemic (1, 2). Reliable estimates of the IFR are essential for policy decisions
around non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccine allocation plans (1, 3). In this paper, we
estimate age-specific IFRs in three locations in India.
A range of estimates for age-specific SARS-CoV-2 IFRs now exists, the majority of
which are based on data from high-income countries (3–6). Meta-analyses that estimate agespecific IFR in low- and middle-income countries (7, 8) rely on the assumption that crucial
epidemiological characteristics (e.g. transmission dynamics, age-specific death rates) from highincome countries are generalizable to low-income settings.
Seroprevalence studies in low- and middle-income countries have given rise to several
population-representative estimates of overall IFR (9–14). Ioannidis (15) additionally estimates
IFR in several developing countries by combining population-representative seroprevalence
surveys (16–18), and subpopulation-specific surveys (e.g. blood donors) (13, 19–23) with
reported deaths. However, to date we are aware of only two studies in any LMIC that estimate
age-specific IFRs, and these are limited to small or non-representative samples. The sample in
Picon et al. (24) is representative for one city in Brazil; the sample in Verity et al. (25) is limited
to repatriated international residents leaving Wuhan Province (China) in a two-day span. Thus,
this paper is the first to provide representative age- and sex-specific IFR estimates for a large
population (the combined population of Mumbai and Karnataka is 73 million) in a low- or
middle-income setting.
Early models of lower-income settings assumed that age-specific infection mortality rates
would be higher due to worse baseline population health and under-resourced healthcare systems
(8, 26, 27). Other researchers observed low case fatality rates (CFR) in Sub-Saharan Africa and
proposed that vaccination, past infection history, and effective mitigation strategies might have
reduced mortality (28–30). The age pattern of deaths in lower-income countries has skewed
younger than in high-income countries, more so than can be explained by age distribution alone,
but the explanation for this fact is not known (31–33).
Estimating infection fatality rates requires accurate measurement of the number of
infections and of deaths in the population due to COVID-19. Widely reported CFRs rely on the
number of infections measured by positive tests undertaken largely for clinical purposes. CFRs

may dramatically overestimate IFRs, especially in low-income settings where testing capacity is
limited (34) and therefore tests are reserved for symptomatic patients who are more likely to be
infected. IFR estimates almost universally rely upon large-scale seroprevalence samples drawn
from the larger population, matched to administrative data on deaths. There have been very few
seroprevalence studies (listed above) that can be matched to mortality counts in lower-income
settings and none with sufficient sample size to calculate age-specific IFRs with any granularity
(24). But IFRs that are not age-specific are difficult to compare across contexts, because the age
pattern of infection may vary and aggregate IFRs will be larger in places where older people
have a larger share of infections.
We use three data sources from India that are uniquely well-suited to calculating agespecific IFRs. We first use population-representative seroprevalence surveys in the city of
Mumbai (N~=7000) and in the state of Karnataka (N~=1200). By matching results from these
surveys to age-specific administrative data on deaths at the time of seroprevalence surveillance,
we can calculate IFR without relying on non-representative testing data. Karnataka and
Maharashtra (the state of Mumbai) are among the states of India with higher quality
epidemiological surveillance and death registration (35). The third data source is a survey of
COVID-19 prevalence among randomly sampled short-term outmigrants (mostly working-age
men) returning home to the state of Bihar, with mortality followup. Because these migrants were
randomly sampled and tracked until recovery or death, the death rate among those who tested
positive in this group is interpretable as an IFR.
Our objective was to calculate age-specific IFRs in all three locations and to compare
them to international estimates, which are based mostly on high-income countries. We further
examined heterogeneity of mortality rates across the three sample locations, and by age.
Methods. In Mumbai and Karnataka, we matched representative seroprevalence surveys
to administrative reports of COVID-19 deaths. In Mumbai, seroprevalence surveys were
conducted for two weeks in July 2020 on representative samples of three wards, one from each
of the city’s three zones, stratified by age, gender and slum/non-slum dwellers (10). The sample
consisted of 6,904 participants (4,202 from slums and 2,702 from non-slums), tested for IgG
antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 N-protein using the Abbott Diagnostics Architect™ test. After
adjusting for test sensitivity, we calculated aggregate seroprevalence for each ward and
multiplied by ward population to obtain a count of the number of people infected. We estimated

infection counts to non-sampled wards by assuming a constant rate of government underreporting in wards in the same zone, an approach that was supported by the finding of very
similar case-to-seroprevalence ratios in the three wards with seroprevalence data. Age- and sexspecific infection shares were based on the seroprevalence survey. Data on cumulative deaths
was collected from daily reports on COVID-19 from the municipal governing body
(Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, henceforth BMC). We matched seroprevalence-based
infection counts to deaths under the assumption that the delay between infection and
seroconversion is on average two days shorter than the delay between infection and death (36,
37). To implement this, we calculated the IFR as the cumulative number of deaths reported as of
two days after the end of seroprevalence testing, divided by the number of infections calculated
as above. Sensitivity tests, described in the supplement, were run with alternate assumptions
about timing and test sensitivity.
In Karnataka, seroprevalence surveys were conducted from June 15 to August 29, 2020,
in representative samples of urban and rural areas in 20 out of Karnakata’s 30 districts, stratified
to generalize to five homogenous regions that span all districts of the state (38). 1,196
participants were tested with the ELISA test for antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD)
of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, developed by Translational Health Science and Technology Institute
in India. We adjusted for test sensitivity and specificity and used census population counts to
aggregate seroprevalence to state-level infection counts, reweighting to match regional age and
gender distributions. We collected district-level death data from the Government of Karnataka
Department of Health and Family Welfare bulletins. The infection count was matched to the
number of deaths reported two days after the last day of seroprevalence surveillance in each
region, as above. IFR was calculated as the number of deaths divided by the number of cases
identified by seroprevalence surveys. Date matching is described in more detail in the
supplement, along with sensitivity tests for results under alternate date assumptions. In
particular, because the seroprevalence survey period in Bangalore spanned two months
(compared with less than three weeks in the other regions), we show results excluding
Bangalore, where deaths may have been overestimated due to the longer survey period.
In Bihar, the state government began COVID-19 testing among returning out-of-state
migrants soon after the first positive case was identified in a migrant on March 22. Beginning on
May 4, Bihar began to randomly select migrants for testing. Random testing continued until July

21, though for a brief window (May 22–31) only migrants returning on trains from seven major
cities were sampled for testing. We isolated the subsample of migrants who were randomly
selected for testing, yielding 4,362 individuals with positive tests. Tests were conducted with
TrueNat machines manufactured by MolBio Diagnostics in Goa, with positive tests confirmed by
real-time PCR kits (39). Bihar attempted to track all migrants, obtaining positive tests until they
eventually recovered or died. 1,530 infected individuals (35%) could not be tracked. In main
estimates, we assumed that their fatality rates were the same as successfully tracked individuals;
in the sensitivity analysis, we considered the possibility that all survived. High attrition is
common in studies of migrant workers (40), with followup in this case complicated by the
ongoing crisis. The vast majority of short-term migrants are working-age men; we limited our
analytic sample to 3,921 randomly-sampled male migrants, 2,536 for whom outcomes are
known.
Representative seroprevalence surveys matched to administrative death data are the
primary source of IFR measurement everywhere in the world (3–7). The surveys in Mumbai and
Karnataka thus give us credible and comparable estimates of age-specific fatality rates in those
regions. In Bihar, because migrants were randomly sampled, there is no selection on
symptomatic or severe cases, and mortality rates among positive cases can be interpreted as
IFRs. We found supporting evidence that the sampling was indeed random in that the
symptomatic rate among randomly tested migrants was similar to that among those testing
positive in the seroprevalence surveys. As we note in the discussion, short-term migrants from
Bihar are economically marginalized; their IFRs can be understood as representative of the
migrant population, but not necessarily the general population.
We calculated IFRs in 10-year age bins in all locations, as well as for individuals
aged 10–49 and 50–89. We used two large-scale meta-analyses (3, 7) of age-specific SARSCoV-2 IFRs as reference groups. Both Levin et al. (3) and O’Driscoll et al. (7) draw almost
exclusively from seroprevalence samples in high-income areas in Europe and the United States.
The application of these seroprevalence samples to mortality in LMICs (as in O’Driscoll et al.
(7)) requires the as-yet untested assumption that multiple epidemiological factors (e.g.,
transmission dynamics, infection attack rate) are uniform across HICs and LMICs. Levin et al.
(3) do not report IFRs separately for men and women; we estimated gender-specific IFRs from
Levin et al. by assuming the same relative IFR for men as was reported in O’Driscoll et al. For

the larger age bins, we weighted sample populations and meta-analysis age-specific IFR
estimates by the Indian national population distribution, to ensure that differences across
contexts were driven by differences in age-specific IFRs rather than different distributions of
ages within each bin.
We calculated the slope of natural log of the IFR as a function of age, by fitting a linear
function to the most granular age-specific IFR data that could be obtained in each location.
Additional details on the underlying samples and the methodology can be found in the
Supplementary Materials.
Results. We plotted age-specific IFR for each location on a log scale, to enable
comparison at all ages in spite of the exponential increases in mortality at higher ages found in
all countries (Figures 1a and 1b). For both men and women, there is substantial variation in IFRs
across the three locations in India. In Karnataka, age-specific mortality rates are an order of
magnitude lower than those reported in the meta-analyses, especially over age 70. In Mumbai,
estimates were close to the lower of the two meta-analyses at younger ages, but then
considerably lower in Mumbai at ages above 60. For 60–69-year-old men, for example, we
measured an IFR of 0.17% [95% CI: 0.092, 0.240] in Karnataka and 0.62% [95% CI: 0.591,
0.647] in Mumbai (Table 1); the meta-analyses reported male IFR of 1.02% and 1.86% in this
age group, respectively.
In contrast, mortality among male migrants returning to Bihar is an order of magnitude
higher. Mortality among men aged 60–69 was extremely high but measured imprecisely due to
the small sample of older men (4.0% [95% CI: 0, 9.4%]). The larger age bins allowed a more
precise measure of IFR in Bihar (Table 2). In both the 10–49 and 50–89 age bins, mortality in
Bihar was an order of magnitude higher than the other Indian locations and both meta-analyses,
after weighting to the Indian age distribution to ensure age-specific comparability. For the 50–89
age group, the estimates were not precise enough to rule out equality between Bihar and the
other groups. For the 10–49 age group, we can rule out equality (p < 0.01).
To the extent that an IFR advantage exists in India, it was found among the old more than
among the young. In all three regions, the overall increase in IFR with age was considerably less
steep than in the reference meta-analyses (Figure 1), particularly at older ages. The metaanalyses suggest that an 80-year-old has about 100x the IFR of a 40-year-old; in Mumbai, the
increase in risk factor is 40x and in Bihar it is only 10x. Specifically, male IFR increased on

average by 4.7%, 9.7%, and 10.3% with each year of age in Bihar, Mumbai, and Karnataka
respectively. We calculated comparable figures in the meta-analyses as 11.4% (7) and 12.3% (3).
The differences between the Indian and the reference groups were similar among women.
The main estimates are replicated in the supplementary materials under a range of
different scenarios and assumptions; the ordering of IFRs across regions and with respect to the
reference groups is highly robust (Figures 2a-d).
Discussion. Our results suggest that there is substantial heterogeneity in age-specific IFR
from COVID-19 in India. In Mumbai and Karnataka, IFRs were lower than those measured in
richer countries, particularly at the ages where most deaths occur. In Bihar, IFR estimates were
an order of magnitude higher than the other two locations and the international reference groups.
Migrants to Bihar may have had higher IFRs because they were among the most
socioeconomically distressed people in the country. Short-term migrants were on average very
poor even before the pandemic, often working in cities in marginal conditions without security of
tenure (40). The sudden lockdown left them out of work, short of wages, and desperate to return
home (41). They may even have worse outcomes than slum residents on average (42) because
they self-selected to leave slums. With transportation options shut down, the return journey was
arduous for many (43). Migrant workers have worse health than the general population at
baseline (44); the circumstances at the beginning of the pandemic may have made this group
exceptionally vulnerable to adverse health events following viral infection.
Our study also revealed a weaker increase in IFR over age than seen in other countries. It
has already been noted that the pattern of mortality in low- and middle-income countries skews
younger than would be predicted from age distribution (33, 45, 46). Our study suggests that a
flatter age profile in mortality could be a major factor driving this difference.
Like all population estimates connected to COVID-19, our estimates are only as good as
the underlying data. The largest potential source of bias in this study was the use of official
reports of COVID-19 deaths, which are likely to undercount the true number of deaths (35, 47).
Misreporting of deaths would have to be substantial, however, to change our conclusions.
Focusing on the 50+ age group, in Mumbai, a doubling of COVID-19 deaths would be required
to put the IFR in the range of the meta-analyses. It is at least plausible that deaths in Mumbai
were undercounted by a factor of 2; from March to July, Mumbai recorded 6,600 excess deaths
in addition to the 6,400 COVID-19 deaths used for the estimation in this study (48). In

Karnataka, COVID-19 deaths would have to be under-reported by a factor of 5 to bring IFR in
line with the international estimates. We cannot rule out this kind of death misreporting;
however, we calculated IFR using a standard methodology used in many cross-national settings,
many of which are also characterized by under-reporting of COVID-19 deaths. Finally, official
misreporting of COVID-19 deaths would not bias our IFR estimates in Bihar, due to the
mortality followup methodology underlying these estimates. For our Bihar estimates to match
the range of meta-analyses, deaths would need to have been overcounted by a factor of 2 for ages
50–89 and a factor 10 for ages 10–49.
It is also possible that our estimates could overestimate IFR. Antibodies fade over time,
so seroprevalence tests provide an upper bound on the cumulative infection rate (49, 50). If the
number of infected patients carrying few antibodies at the time of testing is high, then
seroprevalence-based IFR estimates will be biased upward.
In Bihar, we cannot rule out that the government did not adhere to its stated random
sampling protocol, and may have sampled individuals who were more likely to fall seriously ill
and die. However, we found the same symptomatic rate in positive patients in Bihar as was
found in the random seroprevalence test samples, suggesting sampling in Bihar was indeed
random. Finally, we do not know the base rate of migrant death in the absence of COVID-19,
given the hardships faced by returning migrants. If migrant deaths would be high regardless of
COVID-19, we may overstate the mortality attributable to COVID-19 in this group.
At the time of writing, these estimates are the best available in a lower-income setting.
Improved epidemiological surveillance and accounting of SARS-CoV-2 are critical investments
that would improve our ability to understand the fatality risk of the virus in lower-income
settings.

Materials and Methods
Bihar
Data We made use of data on all positive cases in the state of Bihar found during random testing
of incoming migrants during an early phase of the pandemic. The data was provided by the Health
Department of the Government of Bihar. The data contained a sample of 4,954 active infections
and their outcomes, reported between March 22 (the date on which the first positive case in Bihar
was detected) and July 21, 2020. The vast majority of the sample (over 99%) consisted of migrants
travelling from within India into Bihar, most on designated trains. Migrants were more likely to
be sampled if they presented symptoms between March 22 and May 3. State policy beginning
May 4 during the sample collection period mandated that travellers from within or outside India
(mainly migrant workers returning home due to travel restrictions) be randomly sampled and tested
for COVID-19 infection from March 20 to May 22, and after May 31. Between May 22–31, only
migrants from seven high-infection cities (National Capital Region, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Pune,
Surat, Kolkata, and Bangalore) in India were randomly sampled. We isolated the subsample of
migrants who were randomly selected for testing, yielding 4,362 cases.
During the sample period, migrants were tested with TrueNat machines manufactured by MolBio
Diagnostics in Goa (India), and positive tests were confirmed with real-time reverse polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) kits (53). Importantly, all infected migrants were tracked by the monitoring
team, to determine whether they eventually recovered or died. Among randomly sampled male
migrants, 1,385 infected individuals (35.3%), whom we call “lost”, could not be tracked and thus
their final outcome is uncertain. The high level of attrition is common in studies of migrant workers,
whose frequent movement complicates administrative registration and tracking, particularly during
a crisis (40). We considered several approaches to adjusting for attrition, described below. The
migrant sample, reflecting typical labor migration patterns in India, was overwhelmingly male (90%).
Thus we limited our final analytical sample to 3,921 randomly sampled male migrants, for 2,536
of whom outcomes (recovery or death) are known.

Because everyone in the sample had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, IFRs were estimated as
the share of deaths among non-lost individuals in each age group. To account for potential biases
due to attrition and delays between infection and recovery/death/reporting, we estimated IFRs
using three separate methods, and report estimates from all three.
In age group a, denote the number of lost cases as na,lost, the number of recovered cases as
na,recovered, and the number of cases ending in death as na,died.
Method 1 (main estimation): In our main estimation, we assumed that lost cases had the same
IFR as successfully tracked cases, within each age group. This assumption was implemented by
excluding lost individuals from the IFR calculation. Method 1 provided a midline IFR estimate:

IF R1a =

na,died
na,died +na,recovered

Method 2:In this estimation, we assumed that all lost cases eventually recovered. Thus Method
2 provided a lower bound IFR estimate:

IF R2a =

na,died
na,died +na,recovered +na,lost

Method 3: The share of cases with successful followup declined in late July as the volume of

and non-slum populations in three of twenty-four wards of Mumbai (see Malani et al. (10) for full
survey design). Sample collection lasted two weeks and ended on July 14th in slums and July 19th
in non-slums. The three wards were selected to represent the city’s three broad zones (city, eastern
suburbs, western suburbs); choice of sampled ward within each zone was by convenience. The sample
consists of 6,904 participants (4,202 from slums and 2,702 from non-slums), who were tested for IgG
antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 N-protein using the Abbott Diagnostics ArchitectT M N-protein based
test. The samples were stratified by four age groups, gender, ward, and slum/non-slum residence.
Data on reported infections and deaths by ward and age distribution of deaths were provided
in reports released by the municipal governing body (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, hereafter BMC). Data on ward population in slums and non-slums came from the 2011 Population
Census. Data on shares of population by age and gender in each ward-slum came from the 2012
Socio-Economic and Caste Census.
Estimating IFR
Estimating number of infections. The seroprevalence survey reported seropositivity in four age
groups (12–24, 25–39, 40–60, 61+), called “coarse bins”. To generate infection counts that could
be compared with city death statistics (which are reported in 10-year age bins), seropositivity by
10-year age bin was interpolated by fitting a non-linear function over seropositivity in the coarse
bins. For the main estimation, we interpolated seropositivity in 10-year bins, using the inverse
distance-weighted mean of non-missing values (using the Stata package mipolate), weighting with
the squared inverse of distance. In each coarse bin, the median age of residents in Mumbai City was
used as the non-missing value for age. Figure S1 shows the observed and interpolated values. As a
sensitivity analysis, we report IFR estimates using a piecewise cubic Hermite (“pchip”) interpolation
for seropositivity (see Figure S2 for visual). Interpolation predicted seroprevalence for the midoint of
each 10-year age bin, separately by gender, ward, and slum status.
The estimated sensitivity of the chemiluminiscence immunoassay ranges from 90% (95% CI:
74.4%–96.5%) (56) to 96.9% (95% CI: 89.5%–99.5%) (52) while specificity in those studies was 100%
(95% CI: 95.4%–100%) and 99.90%, respectively. We estimated seroprevalence from seropositivity

using the Rogan-Gladen correction ((54) to account for imperfect accuracy of tests. In the main
results, we used the midpoint of mean sensitivity estimates (93.45%) and the midpoint of corresponding specificities (99.5%). As a sensitivity analysis, we replicated results with an upper bound
for seroprevalence based on the Abbott test’s lower bound of sensitivity (90.0%) and upper bound
of specificity (100%) (52) (Figure S7).

where SPag,s is the estimated seroprevalence rate, and popag,s is population.
Estimating the number of infections in non-sampled wards.
BMC death data reported the ward of death, but not the ward of residence. Discussion with
government officials and review of the data indicated that the ward of death was not a reliable
indicator of ward of residence. This implied that calculating IFR by dividing the number of ward-level
deaths by the number of ward-level infections would overestimate deaths in wards with large hospitals
and underestimate them elsewhere. Instead, we used the seroprevalence surveys to generate estimates
of city-wide infection counts.
To estimate true number of infections in non-sampled wards, we drew on administrative ward-level
infection counts (which were universally available from city reports), and assumed that they were proportional to actual infections at similar rates in different wards of the city. Effectively, this amounts to
assuming that the BMC underestimated the true population infection count at the same rate in sampled and non-sampled wards within the same zone. This assumption is supported by Table S1, which
shows that in the three wards where we obtained seroprevalence data, case multipliers were very similar.
Thus, in each zone z, we calculated a case multiplier based on sampled ward s:
PPd
a
g inf ag,s
γz =
BMC-reported casess
The multiplier indicates the under-reporting rate in each zone z. The numerator of the expression
is calculated from the seroprevalence surveys as above, and the denominator is taken from the BMC
reports. BMC-reported cases were measured as of July 19, the last day of seroprevalence sample

collection. We then multiplied the BMC’s reported number of positive cases in non-sampled ward
n in zone z by γz . That is,

dn,z =γz ×BMC-reported casesn
inf
The benefit of this approach is that it allows pandemic intensity to vary across wards, a realistic
assumption given significant ward-level variation in reported cases per capita and in the number
of containment zones.
This approach also implicitly assumes that the BMC under-reports cases in slums and non-slums
at the same rate, i.e. a ward’s case multiplier does not depend on share of population living in slums.
This assumption is also supported by the consistent multipliers reported in Supplement Table S1,
across three wards with different slum shares.
Estimating the number of infections in each age-gender group in non-sampled wards. We did
not observe the age and gender distribution of infections outside of the sampled wards, so it was
necessary to assume that non-sampled wards had the same age and gender distribution of infections
of sample wards. This was supported by similar age and gender distributions of infections in the three
wards with seroprevalence surveys. Figure S3 shows the calculated age and gender distribution of
infections; note that the distribution of infections measured with seroprevalence skews younger than
the number of reported positive cases, which we presume omits many infected but asymptomatic
young people. This approach would cause error if the age distribution varied substantially across
wards, but it is overall quite similar; even the median age gap between slums and non-slums was less
than one year.

time between infection and seroprevalence are needed. The literature suggests a distribution of delay
between symptom onset and death (36) that is wider than that between onset and seroconversion
(37) Linton et al. estimated a median time delay of 13 days (17 days with right truncation) between
illness onset to death. Stringhini et al. estimated a mean delay of 11.2 days between symptom onset
and seroconversion. Based on these estimates, we assumed that the delay between infection and death
is on average two days longer than the delay between infection and seroconversion. In the main results,
the number of deaths was therefore measured as the cumulative deaths reported in each Mumbai ward
as of July 21. This is likely to slightly overstate the IFR, since some deaths may have been associated
with individuals who contracted the virus after testing negative in the seroprevalence surveys.
However, this upward bias is partially balanced out by the fact that the time between seroconversion
and death is not uniform and is likely to be longer than 2 days for a non-trivial share of cases.
Rather than model non-uniform delays between infection and death, we bounded our IFR estimates
from above by choosing more conservative death dates. In sensitivity analyses reported below (Figure
S6), we replicated IFR estimates using deaths from one week (July 28) and two weeks (August
4) after the end of seroprevalence surveying, both of which plausibly overestimated the number of
deaths related to the seroprevalence surveys, given the context of steadily increasing case counts
in Mumbai from June to August.
The assumption that deaths measured 1 and 2 weeks later will lead to upward biased IFRs is
further strengthened by recent evidence from roughly 125,000 cases in two other Indian states, which
found that delays between case report and death were significantly shorter than delays found in
China (45) and the United States (57).
We used the age distribution of deaths as reported by the BMC up to the date used for measuring
deaths, and the gender distribution (65% male, 35% female) up to August 3 (51) (the gender
distribution of deaths was not included in earlier reports). This yields the estimated number of

Karnataka
Data
Data on seroprevalence were obtained from the Karnataka Seroprevalence Survey (hereafter KSS)
a state-wide representative sample of urban and rural areas in 20 out of 30 districts in Karnataka,
representing 5 broader regions (see Mohanan et al. (38) for a detailed survey description). The
sample was collected from June 15 to August 29, 2020. Collection times within individual regions
were significantly shorter. The study sample was drawn from an existing representative sample
of a panel survey—the Consumer Pyramids Household Survey (CPHS)—collected by the Center
for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). Our analytical subsample consists of 1,196 tests for IgG
antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus using an ELISA test
developed by Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, India. The sample was not
stratified by age and gender, an issue addressed below.
Data on confirmed COVID-19 deaths by district were drawn from Government of Karnataka
Department of Health and Family Welfare bulletins, which are released several times per week.
Data on the age distribution of total COVID-19 deaths were given by public reports from the state
COVID-19 task force. Data on the gender distribution of deaths by age group were obtained from an
individual-level dataset of confirmed COVID-19 deaths which was updated through July. The caselevel death data were parsed from covid19india.org. Age- and gender-disaggregated population
for districts and regions was drawn from the 2012 Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC).

We then corrected for the sensitivity (84.7%) and specificity (100%) of the ELISA imunoassay (55)

number of infections inf
ag
Estimating the number of deaths. The seroprevalence samples were collected at different times
in different regions, with the survey period spanning roughly two months (Table S2). To estimate an
IFR, we need to match the timing of deaths to the timing of seroprevalence surveying in each region.
Choice of dates for measuring deaths. As in Mumbai, we worked from an assumption that the
average time difference between seroconversion and death was two days, while testing sensitivity
to alternate assumptions (Figure S8). We therefore matched the estimated number of infections
calculated in each region to the number of deaths recorded in administrative data two days after the
last date of seroprevalence surveying. As in Mumbai, if the two-day delay between seroconversion
and death was uniform, this approach would overestimate the IFR, because it counts the deaths of
some people who may have been infected after recording negative seroprevalence tests.
In all regions except Bangalore, seroprevalence surveying was conducted over a three week period
or less, making it straightforward to match test data to death data. In Bangalore, surveying was
begun in mid-June but was interrupted by a lockdown. Survey teams returned to finish sampling in
the last week of August. Matching Bangalore deaths to the last date of seroprevalence surveying is
therefore likely to overestimate the IFR, because a number of those deaths may have been associated
with individuals contracting SARS-CoV-2 after testing negative. It was not possible to disaggregate
the early and late surveys because death reporting was at the district level, and the early and late
survey groups were not representative in and of themselves. To adjust for increased uncertainty
regarding the number of infections in Bangalore, we therefore report a sensitivity analysis for all
of Karnataka excluding Bangalore (Figure S9).
On some days, official deaths were not reported; in those cases, we used deaths from the following

day.1
Estimating the number of deaths in each demographic group:
The Karnataka state government released total death counts on a daily basis, but only intermittently published the age distribution of state-wide deaths. To attribute daily deaths to age and
gender groups, we used the age distribution of deaths from the nearest date that was available. The
largest period between the date used for deaths and the date used for age-shares was 13 days.
Government reports provided age shares of deaths in 10-year bins in the form (e.g.) 51-60, while
the seroprevalence surveys provided age bins in the form (e.g.) 50-59. To harmonize the age groups,
we use the medians of the provided bins (e.g. median of 51-60 is 55.5) to interpolate death data
to match the age bins in the seroprevalence data, using an inverse distance weighted average method
via the mipolate Stata package. Because the target age bins were very close to the available age
bins, the risk of error here is small. The fit of the interpolation is displayed in Figure S4). As a
sensitivity test, we replicated IFRs using piecewise cubic Hermite interpolation (see Figure S5 for
the interpolation and Figure S10 for IFR estimates under the cubic interpolation. For more details,
see the discussion on interpolation in Mumbai.
In the absence of death data disaggregated by age and gender on most dates, we assumed that,
within age group, the gender distribution of deaths was uniform across regions and equal to the
state-wide gender distribution of deaths reported between April and July. This assumption is
supported by the finding that IFRs among men were approximately double those among women,
consistent with reports from other countries.
Standard errors of IFRs reflect propagation of design-based standard errors of the age- and
gender-specific seroprevalence estimates with a normal approximation.

In Belgaum, the target date was July 27th; we used July 28. In the sensitivity test, we used August 11 instead

Pooled age bins
Graphs by gender

IFRs in main specification are calculated by pooling seroprevalence and death estimates from all five sampled
regions of Karnataka. IFRs excluding Bangalore pool from the four remaining regions. Graphs by gender with 95%
confidence intervals. Standard errors reflect propagation of error from design-based uncertainty of seroprevalence
estimates. Confidence intervals are not reported for Bangalore due to small sample size, and age-specific estimated
IFRs in Bangalore should not be interpreted as conclusive. IFRs are calculated in age bins 0-9, ... 60-69, and 70+.

Pooled age bins
Graphs by gender

Government reports provide age-shares of deaths in age bins of the form 11-20, 21-30, etc. To match seroprevalence
estimates, we interpolate age-shares of deaths in the form 10-19, 20-29, etc. Main specification uses the inverse distance
weighted average (IDW) to interpolate age shares. sensitivity analysis uses piecewise cubic Hermite interpolation.
Interpolation was done with Stata package mipolate. Graphs by gender with 95% confidence intervals. Standard
errors reflect propagation of error from design-based uncertainty of seroprevalence estimates. Confidence intervals are
not reported for Bangalore due to small sample size, and age-specific estimated IFRs in Bangalore should not be
interpreted as conclusive. IFRs are calculated in age bins 0-9, ... 60-69, and 70+.

“Number of infections, main SP” refers to the estimated seroprevalence ( using the midpoint estimated sensitivity of
the antibody test) multiplied by population in each sampled ward. “Number of infections, high SP” uses lowest
bound sensitivity of the antibody test. Case multiplier “γz , main SP” (Column 6) was calculated by dividing Column
4 by Column 3. “γz , high SP” (Column 7) was calculated by dividing Column 5 by Column 3. Main SP indicates
seroprevalence estimated from midpoint of two published estimates of sensitivity of the antibody test. High SP
indicates seroprevalence was estimated using the minimum sensitivity and maximum specificity of the antibody test,
generating a upper-bound estimate.
