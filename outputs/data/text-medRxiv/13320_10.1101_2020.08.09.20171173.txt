Abstract

24

Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) and other essential workers are at risk for

25

occupational infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several infection control

26

strategies have been implemented. Particularly, evidence shows that universal

27

masking can mitigate COVID-19 infection, though existing research is limited by

28

secular trend bias.

29

Aims: To investigate the effect of hospital universal masking on COVID-19 incidence

30

among HCWs compared to the general community population.

31

Methods: We compared the 7-day averaged incidence rates between a Massachusetts

32

(USA) healthcare system and Massachusetts residents statewide. The study period

33

was from March 17 (the date of first incident case in the healthcare system) to May 6

34

(the date Massachusetts implemented public masking). The healthcare system

35

implemented universal masking on March 26, we allotted a 5-day lag for effect onset,

36

and peak COVID-19 incidence in Massachusetts was April 20. Thus, we categorized

37

March 17-31 as the pre-intervention phase, April 1-20 the intervention phase, and

38

April 21-May 6 the post-intervention phase. Temporal incidence trends (i.e. 7-day

39

average slopes) were compared using standardized coefficients from linear regression

40

models.

41

Results: The standardized coefficients were similar between the healthcare system

42

and the state in both the pre- and post-intervention phases. During the intervention

43

phase, the healthcare system’s epidemic slope became negative (standardized β: -0.68,

44

95% CI: -1.06 – -0.31), while Massachusetts’ slope remained positive (standardized β:

45

0.99, 95% CI: 0.94 – 1.05).

46

Conclusions: Universal masking at the healthcare system was associated with

47

flattening the COVID-19 curve among HCWs, while the infection rate continued to

48

rise in the surrounding community.

Introduction
COVID-19 is an occupational risk for all essential workers, including healthcare

55

workers (HCWs) who are essential to maintain health and hospital systems [1].

56

Evidence has shown HCWs are at risk for infection due to direct exposure to

57

co-workers, patients and contaminated environments [2]. Accumulating research

58

suggests that optimal infection control strategies, including the use of personal

59

protective equipment, can minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to HCWs

60

[3, 4]. Among now established hospital mitigation measures, universal masking is

61

thought to be one of the most effective means to protect HCWs. However, existing

62

evidence of universal masking efficacy is largely based on self-comparison results (i.e.

63

comparing pre- and post-masking phases) [5] instead of comparing HCWs with a

64

reference population, and thus cannot be free from secular trend bias. Therefore, we

65

conducted this study to investigate the effect of universal masking policy in a

66

Massachusetts (USA) healthcare system, using the surrounding statewide population

67

as a comparison group.

70

This time-series study examined the daily changes in COVID-19 incidence

71

among 1) the Massachusetts statewide population and 2) the HCWs of a

72

Massachusetts community healthcare system, which has been testing symptomatic

73

employees since the initial outbreak. The statewide data were derived from

74

Massachusetts Department of Public Health [6]. The HCW cohort of the healthcare

75

system and related ethical statement are described in our previous paper [7]. We

76

calculated 7-day moving averaged COVID-19 incidence to account for daily

77

fluctuation. The date of an incident case was defined as the date when a HCW called

78

the occupational health “hotline” for triage, and its’ reported date for the state.

79

We defined the study period to be from March 17, 2020, when the first case of

80

the healthcare system was identified, to May 6, 2020. The study period was divided

81

into three phases of interest: pre-intervention phase (March 17-31), intervention phase

82

(April 1-20), and post-intervention phase (April 21-May 6). The phases’ date cut-offs

83

were determined as follows. First, the healthcare system implemented universal

84

masking on March 26 and we allowed five more days for the policy to take effect.

85

The policy included securing N95s for all direct care staff managing confirmed or

86

suspect COVID-19 patients, and providing procedure masks to all other staff. Second,

87

April 20 is the day when Massachusetts reached the peak of COVID-19 incidence

88

(Figure). Finally, Massachusetts implemented a statewide masking policy on May 6.

89

We built linear regression models to investigate the temporal trends for each

90

cohort’s 7-day averaged incidence within each of the three phases. Standardized beta

91

coefficients were calculated and presented to account for the difference in scale

92

between the healthcare system and the state. We further obtained the standard errors

93

and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of the standardized coefficients. The

94

analyses were performed using R software (version 3.6.3) and SAS software (version

95

9.4, SAS Institute).

Results
During the study period, incident cases in the healthcare system and the state
were 142 and 75,493, respectively. In the pre-intervention phase, both the healthcare

100

system and the state had strong increasing trends in the 7-day averaged COVID-19

101

incidence (Figure and Table) with overlapping slopes (0.96 (0.80– 1.13) and 0.99

102

(0.92– 1.07), respectively). While the temporal trend among Massachusetts residents

103

kept increasing with a similar slope in the second phase (the intervention phase) (0.99

104

(0.94– 1.05)), that of the healthcare system decreased (-0.68 (-1.06– -0.31). In the

105

post-intervention phase, following the epidemic peak, incidence among both

106

populations showed overlapping negative slopes (-0.90 (-1.19– -0.60) and -0.99

107

(-1.07– -0.92)) (Figure and Table).

Discussion
Our present study provides additional, independent evidence of the protective

111

effect of universal masking in healthcare settings. The healthcare system’s epidemic

112

curve was flattened, and in fact, demonstrated a decreasing daily incidence trend after

113

implementing the masking policy, while the statewide infection rate continued to

114

increase during the same time period. The findings are in agreement with a recently

115

published study using HCW self-comparison [5]. In that study, the authors found a

116

significant decrement in the SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate after the implementation of

117

universal masking. We further confirm this effect by including a comparison group,

118

eliminating potential secular trend bias that limits before- and after- time-series

119

studies.

120

Evidence has shown that the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) can

121

prevent HCWs from being infected [8]. Two epidemiological studies conducted in

122

Wuhan, China investigated 278 and 420 frontline HCWs with optimal PPE protection

123

from different healthcare systems, respectively, and reported none infected [3, 9]. On

124

the other hand, in the one study, 10 out of 213 HCWs without appropriate masking

125

protection sustained nosocomial infection [9]. Furthermore, a Singaporean research

126

team examined the surfaces of used PPE from HCWs who took care of a symptomatic

127

COVID-19 patient and failed to detect SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19)

128

from the collected samples [10]. In accordance with the existing evidence, our results

129

further support masking’s protective effects from the perspective of hospital infection

130

prevention.

131

The current study has several strengths such as the use of a comparable reference

132

group, a validated outcome measurement, and a distinct intervention being

133

implemented. Nonetheless, there are also some limitations. First, the current study is

134

limited by small sample size of HCWs, the short intervention period and individual

135

HCW compliance with the masking policy was not measured. Larger-scale studies are

136

warranted. Second, the five-day interval assumed for the policy to take effect was

137

somewhat arbitrary, but reasonable since most people develop symptoms within five

138

days of infection. Finally, there could be unmeasured confounding, such as improved

139

practices regarding social distancing, hand hygiene, and isolation of COVID-19

140

patients. However, our results show significant differences between the estimates,

141

with a drastic change from positive to negative slope shortly after the masking

142

policy’s implementation, which are unlikely to be entirely biased.

143

In conclusion, our results suggest a significant mitigation effect of universal

144

masking on COVID-19 incidence when implemented in the healthcare setting, which

145

may be applicable to other essential workers and indoor businesses.
