Abstract
Background: Based on the current status of the COVID-19 global pandemic, there is an urgent
need to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of wearing masks to protect public health
from COVID-19 infection.

Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness
of using face masks to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Relevant articles were retrieved
from PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, and Chinese National
Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP (Chinese) database. There were no language
restrictions. This study was registered with PROSPERO under the number CRD42020211862.

Results: A total of 6 case-control studies were included. In general, wearing a mask was
associated with a significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 infection (OR = 0.38, 95% CI =
0.21-0.69, I2 = 54.1%). Heterogeneity modifiers were investigated by subgroup analysis. For
healthcare workers group, masks were shown to have a reduce risk of infection by nearly 70%.
Studies in China showed a higher protective effect than other countries. Adjusted estimates
and subgroup analyses showed similar findings.

Conclusions: The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis support the conclusion
that wearing a mask could reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic that has become a major
public health burden worldwide. It has many potential long-term effects due to already fragile
healthcare systems(1). Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is
transmitted through close contact and person-to-person transmission and causes COVID-19.
To date, viral RNA has been found in air sampling in several studies(2, 3). For the current
foreseeable future, until a safe and effective vaccine or treatment is available, COVID-19
prevention will continue to rely on non-pharmacological interventions, including mitigation of
pandemics in community settings. Therefore, evaluation of personal protective equipment
(PPE), such as masks or respirators, is critical to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
There are different standards of masks, and qualified masks can help to protect users
from a large number of respiratory droplets(4, 5). They vary in thickness and permeability.
N95 respirators are specifically designed to protect users from small airborne particles,
including aerosols. Asadi et al. found that surgical masks and unventilated KN95 respirators
reduced the emission rate of outward particles by an average of 90% and 74% during talking
and coughing, respectively(6). In the prevention and control of COVID-19, the correct use of
personal protective equipment is one of the most important measures to effectively interrupt
the spread of the SARS-CoV-2, and to protect the safety of healthcare workers and other
non-healthcare populations.
Recommendations regarding the effect of wearing a mask on the prevention of

respiratory virus transmission (RVI) have been confirmed by many studies. A meta-analysis
found reduced spread of Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (OR = 0.32; 95% CI
0.25–0.40)(7). Another meta-analysis recently found that mask use by healthcare and
non-healthcare workers reduced the risk of laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infection by
80% (95% CI = 0.11-0.37) and 47% (95% CI = 0.36-0.79), respectively(8).
Compared with other respiratory virus infections, the protective effect of masks on
COVID-19 still lacks relevant comprehensive evidence. Therefore, we performed a
systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of masks to
prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Methods
Identification and selection of studies
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)
statement was consulted to report this systematic review. We prospectively submitted the
systematic review protocol for registration on PROSPERO (CRD42020211862).
Regarding this meta-analysis, a comprehensive searching strategy was carefully designed
to select eligible studies from multiple electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of
Science, Cochrane Library, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP
(Chinese) database. All included studies were published before October 2020. The following
combined search terms were used in the search: (“mask” OR “face mask” OR “respirators”
OR “N95” OR “*mask”) AND (“severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” OR
“2019-nCoV” OR “COVID-19” OR “SARS-CoV-2”). Relevant Chinese technical terms for

the Chinese databases were used to search for published articles.
Furthermore, references of all relevant articles and reviews were retrieved to search for
additional eligible studies. Articles providing abstracts only were excluded. After deleting
duplicates, all abstracts and titles were filtered independently by two reviewers to remove the
irrelevant articles. We downloaded and read the full text of the potential research related to the
selection criteria to incorporate systematic reviews. Reviewers compared and discussed the
results. If a discussion by the two reviewers did not result in an agreement, then the third party
was called upon to create consensus.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The studies meeting the following criteria were included: (1) concerning the relationship
between the face mask and preventing COVID-19; (2) diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 must have
laboratory evidence; (3) providing complete data of cases and controls for calculating an odds
ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI); (4) study design is correct and appropriate; (5)
no language restrictions applied. The exclusive criteria were as follows: (1) insufficient data
to ascertain the adjusted ORs; (2) conferences/meetings abstracts, case reports, editorials, and
review articles; (3) duplicate publication or overlapping studies.

Study quality assessment
The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to evaluate the quality of the case-control
study: study ratings of seven to nine stars corresponded to high-quality, five to six stars to
moderate quality, and four stars or less to low quality (9). Three members of the review team

completed assessments independently. The disagreements were resolved by discussion.

Statistical analysis
The association of mask use with subsequent COVID-19 was assessed with odds ratios
(ORs) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Adjusted and unadjusted pooled estimates were
calculated separately. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Considering the potential for between-study heterogeneity, subgroup analyzes were carried
out based on stratification by HCWs, countries, and types of masks. Sensitivity analysis was
performed by omitting individual studies to assess the stability of the meta-analysis. The
heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. The heterogeneity was considered
insignificance when P > 0.10 and I2 < 50%. If the study lacked heterogeneity, the pooled OR
estimate was calculated using the fixed-effects model, otherwise the random-effects model
was used(10). Begg’s and Egger’s test were performed to quantitatively analyze the potential
publication bias. The P values of Begg’s and Egger’s test more than 0.05 implied no obvious
publication bias in this meta-analysis(11, 12). The meta-analysis was performed using by
Stata (version 14.0; Stata Corp, College Station, TX) software.

Results
Characteristics of eligible studies
A flow diagram of the literature search and related screening process is shown in Figure
1. A total of 6 studies met our inclusion criteria(13-18), all studies included were case-control
studies (Table 1). Among them, studies were conducted in China, the USA, Thailand, and

Bangladesh. All patients had laboratory evidence. The study by Doung-ngern et al.
investigated non-professional populations, and other studies focused on healthcare workers.

Quality of studies
Inter-rater agreement of the quality of included studies was strong. Table 2 summarizes
the quality evaluations of the included studies. Funnel plots assessing the risk of publication
bias are included in figure 2. Neither Begg’s test (z=0.75, p=0.452) nor Egger’s test (t=-1.44,
p=0.224) manifested any distinct evidence of the publication bias. The sensitivity analyses did
not substantially alter the pooled ORs by excluding one-by-one study, indicating that the
meta-analysis was generally robust.

Masks and risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection
The 6 studies reporting on the effectiveness of wearing masks included 1,233
participants. In general, face masks were effective in preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
After wearing a mask, the risk of contracting COVID-19 was significantly reduced, with the
pooled OR of 0.38 and 95% CI=0.21-0.69 (I2=54.1%, M-H Random-effect model) (Figure 3).
In the subgroup of HCWs only, the protective effect was more obvious, with the pooled
OR of 0.29 (95% CI=0.18-0.44, I2=11%) (Figure 4).
Only Doung-ngern et al. (14) investigating non-HCW, and no protective effect was found
in the subgroup analysis (OR= 0.72, 95% CI=0.46-1.12). It should be noted that, the estimate
after adjusted possible confounding variables was 0.23 (95% CI = 0.09-0.59) in this study,
and the protection of masks was still statistically significant (adjustment variables including

sex, age, contact place, shortest distance of contact, duration of contact, sharing dishes or
cigarettes and handwashing) (Table 3).
By geographic locations, beneficial protective effects of wearing masks were found in
China (OR=0.21, 95% CI=0.09-0.53, I2=26.1%), and other countries (OR=0.55, 95%
CI=0.32-0.95, I2=39.3%). Face mask could significantly reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2
infection (OR=0.44, 95% CI=0.21-0.93, I2=52.0%). And no significant protective effect was
shown in N95 respirator group (OR=0.17, 95% CI=0.02-1.69, I2=94.6%). However, the N95
respirator showed a significant protective effect in the adjusted estimation subgroup analysis
(OR=0.19, 95% CI=0.09-0.38, I2=0.0%) (Table 3).

Discussion
This meta-analysis of all available articles provides the most current evidence to date on
the efficacy of face masks in preventing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which causes
COVID-19 in 2019. It spread quickly after being discovered from Wuhan, China at the end of
2019, eventually leading to a global pandemic(19). Experimental studies have grown live
viruses from aerosols and surfaces several hours after implantation(20). A large amount of
pathological evidence shows that aerosol transmission is the predominate route of
transmission(21). Proximity and ventilation are also determinants of transmission risk(22).
Wearing a mask can prevent the inhalation of large droplets and sprays(23). Research
evidence shows that masks can filter sub-micron dust particles(24). The previous
meta-analysis concluded that after wearing a mask, the risk of respiratory viral infections
including influenza, SARS, and H1N1 was significantly reduced with the pooled OR was of

0.35. This result is similar to the result of our meta-analysis that wearing a mask is also very
effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19 (OR=0.38, 95% CI=0. 21-0.69).
The WHO started recommending wearing masks as part of a comprehensive approach to
reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in June, 2020(25). This is consistent with the
recommendations made by the Chinese health department at the beginning of the
epidemic(26). In our results, the use of face masks reduced the risk of COVID-19 infection by
70% for health care workers. However, we only included one study on the general population.
In this study, the adjusted OR value was also statistically significant. Besides s, a cohort study
in Beijing found that the use of masks in index patients was independently associated with a
reduction in the risk of household infection(27). Investigation of the outbreak on USS
Theodore Roosevelt found that low infection risk was related to self-reports of face coverings
and wearing masks(28). This evidence suggests the protective effect of masks on the general
population.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention specifies that the mask
recommendation should not include medical masks(29). Because these masks should be
reserved for healthcare workers. Regarding the types of masks, both N95 masks and general
masks have been found effective in this study. This is consistent with the conclusions of
previous studies. The Cochrane system review of Jefferson et al. showed that both N95 and
surgical masks can effectively prevent the spread of respiratory viruses(7). And Long et al.
indicated a protective effect of N95 respirators against laboratory-confirmed bacterial
colonization (RR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.43-0.78)(8). However, the current available evidence has
not yet confirmed the difference in protective effectiveness between N95 masks and medical

surgical masks (30), although when tested in the laboratory, it was found that N95 respirators
were generally more effective than surgical masks and have better facial sealing
characteristics(7, 31). As face seal is critical for the N95 respirator to provide its protective
effect at maximal capacity, improperly donning and doffing, or adjusting of the N95 respirator
could lead to inadvertent contamination and air leak around the edge of N95 respirator, thus
negating the potential protective benefit(7, 31).
This investigation also had several limitations. First, all the included studies were
case-control studies and lacked adequately designed and high-quality randomized controlled
studies. This may reduce the overall strength of the results. Second, because more research is
currently focused on the treatment and pathology of COVID-19, the total sample size of
studies on the effectiveness of PPE is still relatively small. We will continue to focus on the
progress of relevant population-based studies. Third, the available studies that provided data
for some subgroup analyses were limited, thus the statistical power was relatively low and the
results should be interpreted with caution. Fourth, this study performed meta-analysis on the
unadjusted and adjusted data to calculate the corresponding results, however, the included
original studies did not make the same adjustments for possible confounding factors, such as
gender, age, vaccination, hand hygiene, age, gender and cultural difference, and thus, the
heterogeneity of the final results may be affected.

Conclusion
This meta-analysis aims to provide comprehensive evidence to identify the risk of
SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with mask wearing. This could help healthcare workers,

public health professionals, and policy makers to identify risk factors and develop strategies
to reduce COVID-19 infection. The results show that the mask has a significant protective
effect against COVID-19. However, more evidence is still needed to better define the
protective effect of the mask on the wider population, and more large practical trials are
needed to evaluate the efficacy of the mask on the face to prevent transmission of
SARS-CoV-2.
