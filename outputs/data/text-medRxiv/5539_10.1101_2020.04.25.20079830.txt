ABSTRACT

17
18

Several studies have demonstrated the advantages of environmental surveillance through the

19

monitoring of sewer systems for the assessment of viruses circulating in a given community

20

(wastewater-based epidemiology, WBE).

21

During the COVID-19 public health emergency, many reports have described the presence of

22

SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stools from COVID-19 patients, and a few studies reported the occurrence of

23

SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters worldwide. Italy is among the world's worst-affected countries in the

24

COVID-19 pandemic, but so far there are no studies assessing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in

25

Italian wastewaters. To this aim, twelve influent sewage samples, collected between February and

26

April 2020 from Wastewater Treatment Plants in Milan and Rome, were tested adapting, for

27

concentration, the standard WHO procedure for Poliovirus surveillance. Molecular analysis was

28

undertaken with three nested protocols, including a newly designed SARS-CoV-2 specific primer

29

set.

30

SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection occurred in volumes of 250 mL of wastewaters collected in both areas

31

at high (Milan) and low (Rome) epidemic circulation, according to clinical data. Overall, 6 out of

32

12 samples were positive. One of the positive results was obtained in a Milan wastewater sample

33

collected a few days after the first notified Italian case of autochthonous SARS-CoV-2.

34

The study shows that WBE has the potential to be applied to SARS-CoV-2 as a sensitive tool to

35

study spatial and temporal trends of virus circulation in the population.

INTRODUCTION

38
39

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the

40

coronavirus disease COVID-19, a public health emergency worldwide. On March 11 2020, the

41

World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Italy is among the world's most

42

affected countries in the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, after entering Italy, COVID-19 has been

43

spreading fast. As of April 20th 2020, the total number of cases reported by the authorities reached

44

181,228, with 108,237 active cases (Dipartimento della Protezione Civile, Bulletin 20.04.2020),

45

mainly located in Northern Italy (Lombardy, and its neighbouring regions of Emilia-Romagna and

46

Piedmont).

47

Presymptomatic and paucisymptomatic carriers, mostly undetected in clinical and laboratory

48

surveillance systems, contribute to the spread of the disease (Bay et al., 2020; Nicastri et al., 2020;

49

Rothe et al., 2020; WHO, 2020) and hamper the efforts made to assess the extent of SARS-CoV-2

50

circulation in the population and to control efficiently virus transmission. Analytical regular

51

investigation of wastewaters provides valuable information to measure viral circulation in the

52

population as Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs), collecting and concentrating human excreta,

53

are useful sampling points receiving discharges from the entire community.

54

Environmental microbiologists have studied pathogens in sewage for decades (La Rosa & Muscillo,

55

2012; Sinclair et al., 2008). The screening of wastewater, as a public health surveillance tool,

56

defined as wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), is currently well recognized (Xagoraraki &

57

O'Brien, 2020). In the recent years, scientists have applied WBE to a wide range of waterborne,

58

foodborne and fecal-oral viruses, which infected individuals usually excrete in high concentration

59

with faeces (Katayama et al., 2008; Iaconelli et al., 2017; Bisseaux et al., 2018). However, the

60

concept of WBE can also be applied to viruses beyond those commonly associated with the faecal-

61

oral route (i.e. enteric viruses), since viral shedding may involve different body fluids ultimately

62

discharged into urban sewage.

63

Some studies have reported the presence of virus RNA in the stools of COVID-19 patients in

64

percentages ranging from 16.5% to 100% at a concentration up to 6.8 log10 genome copies/g of

65

stool (Chen et al., 200; Lo et al., 2000; Han et al., 2000; Lescure et al., 2000). Furthermore,

66

preliminary studies have reported the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater in The

67

Netherlands (Medema et al., 2020), France (Wurtzer et al., 2020), USA (Wu et al., 2020), and

68

Australia (Ashmed et al., 2020). To date, no study has yet provided insights into the presence of

69

SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters in Italy.

70

Herein we report the results of the screening for SARS-CoV-2 presence in sewage samples

71

collected between the end of February and the beginning of April 2020 from WWTPs in Milan

72

(Northern Italy) and Rome (Central Italy).

76

MATERIAL AND METHODS

77
78

Twelve raw sewage samples were collected between the 3rd of February and the 2nd of April 2020

79

from three WWTPs, located in Milan (two distinct plants, reported as A and B) and in Rome (one

80

plant receiving two different pipelines, C1 and C2, from different districts of the town),

81

respectively. The samples (24-hour composites) were collected from the WWTP influent,

82

immediately stored at -20 °C, and dispatched frozen to the National Institute of Health for analysis.

83

Before viral concentration, samples underwent a 30 min treatment at 57 °C to increase the safety of

84

the analytical protocol for the laboratory personnel and environment, as Pastorino et al. (2020)

85

reported these conditions to reduce the virulence of the virus by over 5 log.

86

Sample concentration took place using a two-phase (PEG-dextran method) separation as detailed in

87

the 2003 WHO Guidelines for Environmental Surveillance of Poliovirus protocol (WHO, 2003),

88

with modifications to adapt the protocol to enveloped viruses. In brief, the wastewater sample (250

89

mL) was centrifuged to pellet the wastewater solids, retaining the pellet for further processing. The

90

clarified wastewater was mixed with dextran and polyethylene glycol (PEG), and the mixture was

91

left to stand overnight at 4 °C in a separation funnel. The bottom layer and the interphase were then

92

collected drop-wise, and this concentrate was added to the pellet from the initial centrifugation. The

93

chloroform treatment that the WHO protocol envisages at this stage was omitted; this preserved the

94

integrity of the enveloped viruses object of this study. The viral nucleic acids extraction foresaw the

95

use of the NucliSENS miniMAG semi-automated extraction system with magnetic silica carried out

96

following manufacturer’s instructions (bioMerieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France) with however slight

97

modifications. The lysis phase was prolonged to 20 minutes, and brief centrifugation (2000 × g, 1

98

min) was used to pellet the sediment; subsequently, magnetic silica beads were added to the cleaned

99

supernatant. Before molecular tests, the extracted nucleic acids were further purified by PCR

100

inhibitors using the OneStep PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit (Zymo Research, CA, USA).

101

In the absence of a standardized method for SARS-CoV-2 detection in environmental samples,

102

RNAs were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using three different PCR assays (Table 1 and

103

Figure 1):

104

a) a broad range of PCR for Coronavirus detection targeting the ORF1ab (Ar Gouilh et al.,

105

2018). Primers were previously designed targeting a highly conserved region (nsp12)

106

among all Coronavirinae sequences to detect a broad range of coronaviruses by a semi-

107

nested PCR producing a fragment of 218 bp.

108

b) a newly designed primer set specific for SARS-CoV-2. Novel nested primers, amplifying a

109

332 bp fragment of ORF1ab, were designed using prime3 software (http://primer3.ut.ee/).

110

For the assays a) and b) first-strand cDNA was synthesized using Super Script IV Reverse

111

Transcriptase (ThermoFisher Scientific) with the reverse primer. PCR reaction was

112

performed using 2.5 µl of cDNA in a final volume of 25 µl (Kit Platinum™ SuperFi™

113

Green PCR Master Mix, Thermo), using 1 µl of primers (10 µM). The PCR conditions were

114

as follows: 98 °C for 30 sec; 35 cycles of 98 °C for 10 sec, 50 °C and 54 °C for 10 sec for

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.25.20079830; this version posted May 7, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

115

assay a) and b) respectively, and 72 °C for 30 sec; final extension 72 °C for 5 min. After the

116

first round PCR, nested PCR was performed using 2 µl of first PCR product and under the

117

same reaction composition and thermal profile conditions. A synthetic DNA (Biofab

118

Research) including the PCR target region, was used to set up PCR conditions before

119

experiments with study samples, but was not amplified along with samples to avoid risks of

120

PCR contamination . Molecular grade water was used as the negative control.

121

c) a published nested RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 targeting the spike region (Nao et al., 2020).

122

cDNA was synthesized from 5 μl of sample RNA, using SuperScript III Reverse

123

Transcriptase (ThermoFisher Scientific), 0.5 μM of the reverse primer (WuhanCoV-spk2-r,

124

Table 1) and a 50 min reaction at 50 °C (20 μl final volume). First PCR reaction was

125

performed by adding the reaction mix (Dream Taq polymerase and buffer from

126

ThermoFisher Scientific, 0.4 μM of primers WuhanCoV-spk2-r and WuhanCoV-spk1-f)

127

directly to the whole volume of synthesized cDNA. The used PCR conditions were as

128

follows: 95°C for 1 min; 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 sec, 56 °C for 30 sec, and 72 °C for 40

129

sec; final extension 72 °C for 5 min. Nested PCR (primers NIID_WH-1_F24381 and

130

NIID_WH-1_R24873) was performed in a total volume of 50 µl using 5 µl of first PCR

131

product, with the same conditions applied for the first PCR and 45 cycles.

132

All positive samples were retested for confirmation of results. The PCR products were revealed by

133

electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels and were purified using a Montage PCRm96 Microwell Filter

134

Plate (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and then direct sequenced on both strands (BioFab Research,

135

Rome, Italy). Sequences were identified in terms of the closest homology sequence using BLAST

136

https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi. All Italian SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences available at the

137

time of analysis were retrieved from Gisaid (https://www.gisaid.org/) for comparison with study

138

sequences, using the MEGA X software (Kumar et al., 2018)..

139

Sequences were submitted to NCBI GenBank with the accession numbers: [GenBank submission

140

ID 2337138 and 2337168].

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

143
144

The 50% (6/12) of the wastewater samples showed positive results for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Table

145

2). Both the published and newly designed SARS-CoV-2 specific primer sets detected bands of the

146

expected size and were confirmed by the sequencing. In contrast, only aspecific products were

147

detected with a broad range assay for coronavirus. Upon comparison of broad range primers with

148

SARS-CoV-2 genome, we noted that they showed only 77.1 to 91.3 % nt identity, which explain

149

why these were not able to amplify the novel coronavirus.

150

SARS-CoV-2 RNA was first detected with a weak amplification signal in an influent sample from

151

Milan WWTPs (Lombardy, North Italy) collected on February 24th from the plant A with the

152

ORF1ab assay. A positive result for SARS-CoV-2 was also detected this time with a strong

153

amplification signal, on February 28th from the plant B, with both the ORF1ab and the Spike

154

regions. In the influent samples taken from the WWTP in Rome (Latium, Central Italy), SARS-

155

CoV-2 was detected in both the sampling dates (31st of March and 2nd of April) and both the

156

pipelines, C1 and C2, using the newly designed primer sets specific for SARS-CoV-2. The analyzed

157

sequences showed, for both ORF1ab and S partial gene regions, 100% identity with the first SARS-

158

CoV-2 sequence detected in Italy (MT066156), isolated on 30th January 2020 from a Chinese tourist

159

by the Institute “Lazzaro Spallanzani” (INMI, Rome). Given the high level of conservation of the

160

two analysed regions, 100% identity was also detected with several sequences in GenBank and with

161

all the other Italian SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited in Gisaid.

162

Significantly, on February 24th and 28th, when the samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 were collected

163

in Milan, COVID-19 infections were still limited in Italy, the first Italian autochthonous SARS-

164

CoV-2 positive case having been reported only a few days earlier, on February 21st. On February

165

28th, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients reported in all Italy was only 888,with 531

166

(57%) in Lombardy, the most affected region in the country. However, at that time, the vast

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.25.20079830; this version posted May 7, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

167

majority of cases in Lombardy were recorded in the provinces of Lodi, Cremona and Bergamo

168

(182, 123, and 103 cases, respectively). In comparison, in the province of Milan (an even larger

169

area compared to the metropolitan area served by the selected WWTPs) only 29 cases had been

170

reported (Dipartimento della Protezione Civile, Bulletin 28.02.2020).

171

These results provide evidence of the sensitivity of environmental surveillance for the detection of

172

ongoing outbreaks in the population. Virus detection in sewage, despite the low incidence of

173

reported human infections, may be associated with the ability of environmental surveillance to

174

detect mild, subclinical, or asymptomatic cases. These infected individuals shed viruses into local

175

sewage systems and contribute to virus circulation while remaining substantially undetectable by

176

clinical surveillance, a phenomenon known as the “surveillance pyramid” (Martinez Wassaf et al.,

177

2014). Clinical surveillance, indeed, only captures the tip of the iceberg of viral diseases

178

(hospitalized patients or laboratory diagnosed cases). In contrast, monitoring of urban wastewaters

179

makes it possible to capture the full extent of the diseases at a community level.

180

As regards to the influent samples collected in Rome, SARS-CoV-2 detection was obtained on

181

March 31, when the epidemic had spread considerably in Italy. In that date, a total of 77.635 SARS-

182

CoV-2 infections had been reported in Italy, of which 3.095 in Latium Region and 2.186 in the

183

province of Rome (Dipartimento della Protezione Civile, Bulletin 31.03.2020), with about 85% of

184

them being active cases (Assessorato alla Sanità e all’Integrazione Socio Sanitaria della Regione

185

Lazio; Ministero della Salute, Bulletin 31.03.2020). Given this diffusion of the virus, with such

186

several excreting patients (symptomatic and asymptomatic), the detection of the viral RNA in the

187

tested samples is not surprising and, consistently, the samples taken two days later, on the 2nd April,

188

at the same WWTP were still positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

189

Following this investigation on the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage, the production of

190

quantitative data on virus concentration in raw sewage will be undertaken. This approach will allow

191

obtaining a rough estimation of the total number of subjects excreting the virus, by integrating - as

192

done by Wu and co-workers in samples taken in the United States (Wu et al., 2020) - the available

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.25.20079830; this version posted May 7, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

193

information on viral shedding rates, WWTPs loads, and virus concentration in wastewaters.

194

Moreover, the environmental surveillance will be extended to the collection of wastewater samples

195

available in the Department of Environment and Health of the Italian National Health Institute, that

196

were collected throughout Italy in the framework of different projects on enteric viruses. Such

197

monitoring will provide a picture of the SARS-CoV-2 circulation across the different regions of

198

Italy and over time, to better understand the virus circulation, as provided by wastewater-based

199

epidemiology (WBE) and compare it to the clinical data. Samples collected before the reporting of

200

the first known Italian case on February 21 will also be tested, to possibly infer when SARS-CoV-2

201

first appeared in Italy. In a previous study, indeed, wastewater monitoring provided evidence that a

202

novel variant of Norovirus GII.17 (termed Kawasaki 2014) had been circulating in the Italian

203

population before its first appearance and identification in clinical cases, later becoming one of the

204

prevalent variants in the population (Suffredini et al., 2018).

205

Also and most important, environmental monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in sewages will continue

206

when the emergency phase is over, and its circulation in the population will be considered limited.

207

Indeed, sewage surveillance could also serve for the early detection of a possible re-emergence of

208

COVID-19 in urban areas. WHO recommends environmental surveillance for poliovirus as an early

209

warning system. As an example, during 2013, Israel observed the silent reintroduction and

210

transmission of wild poliovirus type 1, detected through routine environmental surveillance

211

performed on sewage samples (https://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_09_20_polio/en/) without the

212

reporting of any clinical cases. Environmental monitoring, therefore, appears to be an effective

213

measure for proving early warning against pathogen reintroduction.

214

In conclusions, the main findings of this study are:

215

1) first detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments in sewage in Italy;

216

2) demonstration of the suitability of the WHO protocol for sewage treatment to enveloped

217

viruses after appropriate modifications;

3) design of a novel nested PCR assay specific for SARS-CoV-2, useful for screening
purposes.

Further research will clarify the applicability of WBE to SARS-CoV-2 for prompt detection, the

221

study, and the assessment of viral outbreaks.
