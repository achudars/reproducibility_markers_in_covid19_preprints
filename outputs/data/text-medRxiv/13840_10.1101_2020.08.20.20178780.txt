Abstract
Due to the global shortage of PPE caused by increasing number of COVID-19 patients in recent
months, many hospitals have had difficulty procuring adequate PPE for the clinicians who care
for these patients. Faced with a shortage, hospitals have had to implement new PPE conservation
policies. In this paper, we describe a tool to help hospitals better project PPE needs under various
conservation policies. Though this tool is built on top of projections of the number of
hospitalized COVID-19 patients, it is agnostic as to which model—of which many are
available—provides these projections. The tool combines COVID-19 patient census projections
with information like staffing ratios and frequency of patient contact to provide projections of the
number of items of key types of PPE needed under three built-in conservation scenarios:
standard, contingency, and crisis. Users are also able to customize the tool to the specifics of
their hospital and design custom conservation policies.

Introduction
Substantial shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) exist throughout the world due to
the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that has caused unprecedented surges in
PPE demand. At the time of publication, several emergency measures have already been
implemented to rapidly increase PPE supply and reduce the rate of its consumption. 3 4 7 Yet,
accurately forecasting how much PPE will be needed has been challenging, given the challenges
in projecting how many patients will be hospitalized in different regions of the country.
During normal hospital operations, PPE procurement is a routine exercise of obtaining supplies
at a fair price from reliable suppliers.1 Not much forecasting is needed – hospital administrators
simply place replenishment orders for the materials they have consumed in the recent past. This
creates a “pull” or “just-in-time” system in which the consumption of materials triggers orders
for replacements.
Such pull systems may be optimal in normal conditions, as they allow hospitals facing
significant cost pressures to be “lean” by operating with low inventory levels, but they do not
support operations efficiently in exceptional situations such as a pandemic.1 Hospitals as well as
local, state, and federal governments have created buffers in the form of “strategic stockpiles”
that can help absorb unexpected spikes in demand resulting from such public health emergencies.
However, forecasting the “right” PPE ordering quantities prior to the outbreak of a pandemic is
practically impossible given the high variability in the number of people infected in different
pandemics. The number of patients infected in past pandemics has ranged from thousands to
millions during the SARS outbreak and the 1918 Flu pandemic, respectively.2 6
As a pandemic unfolds, more information about the pathogenicity of the virus as well as
infection rates from other regions impacted earlier becomes available and can be used to inform
epidemiological models forecasting infections, hospitalizations, and mortality rates. In the case
of COVID-19, such epidemiological models include, among others, the COVID-19 Hospital
Impact Model for Epidemics (CHIME) model from Penn Medicinei, the Institute for Health

Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) Model from the University of Washingtonii, and a model
developed by a team at the University of Basel, Switzerlandiii.
Though such hospitalization forecasting models are valuable for planning the need for beds and
ventilators, they do not directly determine the demand for PPE. Limited data, variation in
clinician behavior, and reduced, heterogeneous consumption in anticipation of PPE shortages
make it challenging to translate patient volumes into forecasts of PPE demand.
In this case study, we discuss the development and application of a tool for forecasting
consumption of a set of PPE critical for the care of COVID-19 patients based on predicted
patient admission and hospital census information. Our tool is publicly available to download at
https://penn-chime.phl.io/. Our tool allows hospitals and health systems to make projections
using three pre-populated scenarios. These scenarios—standard, contingency, and crisis—
correspond to projections for PPE use by bedside clinicians (physicians, nurses, respiratory
therapists) under increasingly strict PPE conservation policies. These scenarios were developed
in consultation with clinicians across several different clinical departments and system-level
leaders to ensure they capture realistic assumptions about how PPE materials are used in
standard care within a hospital and what would constitute reasonable PPE conservation strategies
in cases of PPE shortages. Our tool also provides users with the option to input their own custom
scenarios, tailored to specific situations relevant to their hospital or health system. With the help
of our forecasts, hospitals and health systems can update their PPE procurement decisions and
adjust their consumption behavior by switching between the three scenarios or developing their
own.
Translating Patient Projections into PPE Demand Projections
Our forecasting tool requires daily forecasts for the expected number of COVID-19 patients who
are hospitalized, the number in the ICU, and the number of new admissions. We then model the
number of daily patients arriving in the ED as a multiple of daily new admissions. Our tool is
flexible with respect to the source of these forecasts as long as their numerical values can be
entered into an Excel Spreadsheet. The previously mentioned epidemiological models all allow
for exporting this information and we are in ongoing discussions of directly integrating our tool
with these models. A comparison of the three previously mentioned epidemiological models,
including their methodology, key assumptions, and early predictive accuracy, can be found in
Cotner et al.4
As we translate patient census into PPE demand, we need to explicitly model the clinical drivers
of PPE consumption. Towards that goal, we found it helpful to distinguish between two types of
PPE consumption: contact-based consumption and staffing based consumption. Contact-based
consumption refers to PPE usage in which the number of items utilized is a direct function of the
number of contacts staff members have with COVID-19 patients.

In contrast, staff-based consumption refers to PPE usage in which the number of items consumed
only depends on the number of staff in a shift and not on the number of their contacts with
patients. For example, masks in short supply are often now being used by a clinician for a shift,
several days, or longer irrespective of the number of patient contacts unless the mask becomes
visibly soiled or deformed. The number of masks needed therefore does not depend on the
number of patient contacts but only on the number of staff on a shift. In contrast, clinicians
typically change gloves when moving from one patient to another and a safe reuse of gloves is
practically infeasible. Since every contact with a patient requires a new pair of gloves, we model
them as contact-based consumption.
Modeling Contact-based Consumption
Depending on the PPE item and the scenario, an item might be used only once (this practice is
typical of the “standard” scenario) or might be reused multiple times (especially in scenarios of
PPE shortage, such as “contingency” or “crisis”) before being discarded.
The projected number of a particular PPE item (e.g., a pair of gloves) needed for a particular day
(e.g., April 18) can be computed as:


#            

 

Our mathematical appendix provides a concise mathematical summary of all calculations. To
illustrate, consider the number of pairs of gloves needed per day in an ICU with a census of 25
patients, assuming each patient is contacted by one clinician every hour, gloves are used at every
contact, and gloves cannot be reused:
Gloves needed per day

 600

  ! / 

This formula does not require that the PPE be used for every patient contact. For example, if
gloves were only used every other contact on average, then the denominator would be two
patient contacts per pair of gloves because, on average, the patient would be contacted twice
before a single pair of gloves is discarded. The total PPE demand for the hospital for a given
item on a given day can be found by summing the demand across all portions of the hospital.
While these calculations by themselves are simple, obtaining the necessary data is not. In order
to produce realistic values for the number of contacts with a patient, we relied on two different
sources of information. One source was based on records of the number of times a nurse enters a
patient’s room per day which we could calculate using badge tracking data. From this, we were
able to extract the typical number of patient contacts per day for registered nurses (RNs) in some
units. The second source of information was interviews with clinicians in the ICUs, regular
medical floors, and Emergency Department to solicit information on how many times per day a
typical patient is contacted by clinical personnel (RNs, residents, attendings, and respiratory
therapists (RTs)).
The information we compiled from these sources was used to populate the assumptions in
creating a “standard scenario.” To create values for the contingency and crisis scenarios, we

asked clinicians to estimate the degree to which patient contacts could be reduced if PPE
utilization needed to be mildly or sharply constrained (Table 1). These values do not represent a
direct average across data sources, but rather a carefully considered weighing of different inputs.
In order to produce realistic values for how PPE can be conserved through re-use (i.e., how many
patients can be contacted using the same PPE item), we also surveyed clinicians, asking how
often a piece of equipment is typically used under normal circumstances (standard scenario) and
how many re-uses would be reasonable if resources were to become somewhat constrained
(contingency) or extremely constrained (crisis). For equipment that is not used at every contact
(e.g. either a surgical mask or a N95 is used) we relied on historical use data to find the relative
frequency of use of such substitute items. The number of contacts before disposing of each
equipment type under the different scenarios are shown in Table 2. Although we elicited values
for all scenarios for all equipment, the staffing-based approach will be more appropriate for
select equipment types (e.g., N95 masks).
Modeling Staff-based Consumption
In the case of staff-based consumption, rather than specifying that the clinician discard PPE after
a given number of patient contacts, we instead specify that the equipment be (re)used for a
certain number of shifts. For PPE items that are consumed based on staffing (as opposed to based
on contacts), we can project the number of items of a particular PPE (e.g., a N95 mask) for a
particular day (e.g., April 20) as:

#!   # $  


#     !   #      
Staff-based calculations must be done separately for the multiple clinical roles (nurse, resident,
RT), since staffing ratios vary across roles. To illustrate, consider the number of N95 masks
needed per day in an ICU for nurses with a census of 20 patients. Assuming a patient-to-nurse
staffing ratio of 2:1 and clinicians using a mask for five shifts before it is discarded:
Average # new N95 masks needed per day

This calculation assumes that clinicians will be re-using the same mask from previous shifts. The
total PPE demand for the hospital can be found by summing the demand across all clinical units
and clinical roles. Tables 3-5 summarizes the values we used for each scenario in our
calculations. Users also have the option to input custom values for each variable should the
defaults not apply to their setting.
As can be seen in the table, the values for staffing ratios, the levels of reuse, and even shift
durations vary across the three scenarios. All values were obtained through discussions with
system-level decision-makers as well as clinicians, where feasibility of re-use, patient and
clinician safety, and equipment availability were considered.

Scenario-dependent calculation bases
The consumption of some PPE items might be best modeled as contact-based in the standard
scenario but as staff-based in cases of shortages (i.e., the contingency or the crisis scenario). For
example, in our surveys, N95 masks in typical times are consumed based on the number of
patient contacts. However, in light of supply shortages, many hospitals have switched utilization
policies to a contingency mode limiting each staff member to one mask per shift, thus
corresponding to a staff-based consumption. Table 6 describes how items are consumed either
based on contact or based on staff across the three scenarios.
Model usage
We see multiple usages for this type of model. The most important during the pandemic would
be for hospitals to assess needs for currently admitted patients and tie projections of hospitalized,
ICU, and COVID-19 patients directly to the projected amount of PPE required to care for them.
These predictions can be done using ‘standard usage’ assumptions.
A large number of COVID patients under standard assumptions would require a significant
amount of PPE. For example, imagine a hospital will have 100 COVID ICU patients per day
over ten weeks. During that time, for an item that requires contact-based use such as a pair of
gloves, the hospital would need approximately 100 x 70 days x 24 contacts/day = 168,000 pairs
of gloves just for the COVID ICU patients alone.
Estimates using standard assumptions can be adjusted based on existing or available inventory to
contingency or crisis scenarios. If obtaining 168,000 gloves for the ICU (plus more for the
regular floors, ED, and outpatient settings for COVID and non-COVID patients) seems
infeasible, hospitals can estimate how many they would need under alternative scenarios so that
utilization behavior can be adjusted before the shortage is critical, given that additional supplies
may not be available at a later time.
As hospitals (and cities and states) may need to navigate through multiple waves of this
epidemic, this tool can also be used to project future use for strategic stockpiling before potential
future waves of the epidemic.
Limitations
The biggest uncertainty of these projections comes from the epidemiological models that we use
as our input. As we show in Cotner et al.4, these patient predictions vary widely and thus
introduce noise into our PPE forecasts. Projections are more accurate within a 2-3 week horizon
than further into the future, given the inherent uncertainty of predicting the exact course of the
epidemic in different geographic regions.
We collected data and triangulated our estimates on actual PPE utilization through discussions
with many clinicians within a single institution (Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania,
Philadelphia, PA). Actual utilization patterns may differ at other hospitals or among other
clinicians. Nevertheless, our model is flexible and allows for custom inputs based on utilization
patterns at other facilities.

Norms about what constitutes “standard” utilization have been shifting due to widespread PPE
shortages. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, it was standard to use a N95 mask in a wide range of
clinical encounters. Due to shortages of N95 masks, their use in many health care settings is
restricted to procedures that are likely to generate aerosols such as intubation, with surgical
masks being recommended as the alternative for regular patient contact. Our assumptions on N95
versus surgical mask utilization were based on CDC recommendations and institutional policies
at the University of Pennsylvania Health System. In addition, assumptions on reuse of N95 and
surgical masks were based on surveys with clinicians on the feasibility of re-using each mask
type (i.e., N95s are more durable than surgical masks) and the potential adoption of
decontamination procedures (e.g., UV radiation) to prolong the mask’s useful product life.
Currently our model accounts for utilization in inpatient settings but does not include outpatient
care or home health. Our model currently does not account for PPE use by non-clinical staff,
such as cleaning staff. We also do not model needs for PPE in non-COVID patients since the
PPE-use assumptions are focused exclusively on PPE-use for COVID patients. Health care
systems using this tool should be careful to make sure that they account for regular utilization for
non-COVID patients, for outpatient, and for other non-clinical roles that require PPE.
Discussion
“Buffer or suffer” is an old saying among purchasing managers. Facing uncertainty, decision
makers either have to be willing to hold what often appears to be unnecessary inventory or suffer
severe shortages in cases of exceptionally high demand. In the case of PPE procurement, the
uncertainty results from the unknown number of patients in the hospital as well as the
heterogeneous consumption behavior of the staff in the hospital. Epidemiological models can
help reduce the former uncertainty by modeling the arrival, admission, and census of patients in
the hospital. The novelty of our approach is that it estimates the consumption of PPE as a
function of the number of hospitalized COVID patients.
Though we developed our tool in the midst of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, we
believe this will have utility throughout the course of this pandemic. In addition, our model can
be used in preparation for future public health emergencies and informing the strategic
stockpiling decisions made by government officials. It can help identify expected shortages of
particular PPE items that then can be mitigated by either increasing inventory reserves, prenegotiating delivery agreements with PPE vendors, or changing utilization patterns among
clinicians well in advance of critical shortages.
Another use of our tool is to gain a better understanding of likely PPE consumption in the
hospital over time. Though the procurement costs for PPE are not a major cost driver for clinical
operations, they can easily add up to millions of dollars for a large hospital.
In normal times, procurement of PPE is fairly routine and can rely on ‘just in time’ delivery.
During a pandemic planning ahead and using projections to estimate future needs is critical in
mitigating risk to providers and patients by always having adequate stores of PPE on hand.
