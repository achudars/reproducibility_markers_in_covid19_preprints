ABSTRACT (247 WORDS)

23

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on older adults. Mexico's

24

population is younger, yet COVID-19’s impact on older adults is comparable to countries with

25

older population structures. Here, we aim to identify health and structural determinants that

26

increase susceptibility to COVID-19 in older Mexican adults beyond chronological aging.

27

METHODS: We analyzed confirmed COVID-19 cases in older adults using data from the

28

General Directorate of Epidemiology of Mexican Ministry of Health. We modeled risk factors

29

for increased COVID-19 severity and mortality, using mixed models to incorporate multilevel

30

data concerning healthcare access and marginalization. We also evaluated structural factors

31

and comorbidity profiles compared to chronological age for improving COVID-19 mortality

32

risk prediction.

33

RESULTS: We analyzed 7,029 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in adults aged ≥60 years. Male

34

sex, smoking, diabetes, and obesity were associated with pneumonia, hospitalization and ICU

35

admission in older adults, CKD and COPD were associated with hospitalization. High social

36

lag indexes and access to private care were predictors of COVID-19 severity and mortality.

37

Age was not a predictor of COVID-19 severity in individuals without comorbidities and

38

structural factors and comorbidities were better predictors of COVID-19 lethality and severity

39

compared to chronological age. COVID-19 baseline lethality hazards were heterogeneously

40

distributed across Mexican municipalities, particularly when comparing urban and rural areas.

41

CONCLUSIONS: Structural factors and comorbidity explain excess risk for COVID-19

42

severity and mortality over chronological age in older Mexican adults. Clinical decision-

43

making related to COVID-19 should focus away from chronological aging onto more a

44

comprehensive geriatric care approach.

INTRODUCTION

47

The novel SARS-CoV-2 has disproportionately affected older adults. Notably, the impact of

48

the COVID-19 pandemic has had larger repercussions in countries with older population

49

structures; data from large outbreaks in China, Italy and, most recently, the United States has

50

shown a remarkable impact of SARS-CoV-2 infections on older patients, with increased

51

disease severity, adverse outcomes and increased mortality [1–3]. This susceptibility has been

52

suggested to be attributable to deleterious features of aging, particularly in those with cardio-

53

metabolic and respiratory comorbidities. Tissue-specific expression of the ACE2 gene, which

54

encodes the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, has been linked to specific immune signatures in males

55

and older adults and its expression have been shown to be age-dependent [4,5]; moreover,

56

immunosenescence and increased inflammatory responses related to the aging process might

57

lead to increased infection risk and dysregulated immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in older

58

adults [6]. Given these mechanisms which may increase susceptibility in older individuals, the

59

role of comorbidities and social inequities, which condition an increased burden on

60

functionality and dependence, has often been overlooked over chronological aging as

61

significant predictors of COVID-19 severity and lethality. In Mexico, COVID-19 has shown

62

similar patterns on its impact on older adults, despite an apparent demographic dividend by

63

having, on average, a younger population [7]. Mexico’s younger population structure

64

compared to European countries is nonetheless affected by increased rates of cardio-metabolic

65

diseases, particularly type 2 diabetes, obesity and the metabolic syndrome, with most

66

individuals reaching older age with a significant number of comorbidities [8,9]. Recent shifts

67

on aging structures within Mexico have resulted in an increased number of older adults who

68

continue working into old age, most of whom live in poverty, do not have adequate healthcare

69

access, and are dependent on the working-age population [7]. The combination of unequal

70

structural factors, an aging population with increased risk for chronic diseases, and the co-

71

existence of infectious diseases position Mexican older adults as a particularly susceptible

72

population during the COVID-19 pandemic [10]. Given that most studies have linked an

73

increased risk of COVID-19 with chronological age, many resource allocation decisions have

74

been made purely on this basis, which represents an issue for geriatric care in the patient

75

population facing the highest disease burden [11]. To address these gaps, we investigated

76

health and structural determinants which could contribute to increased COVID-19 severity and

77

lethality beyond chronological age in older Mexican adults to better characterize the impact of

78

COVID-19 in older populations.

79

METHODS

80

Data sources

81

We analyzed data collected by the General Directorate of Epidemiology of the Mexican

82

Ministry of Health, which is an open-source dataset comprising daily updated suspected

83

COVID-19 cases that have been tested for SARS-CoV-2 and were certified by the National

84

Institute for Diagnosis and Epidemiological Referral [12]. Data to estimate population rates at

85

different ages and population density was extracted from 2020 population projections obtained

86

by the Mexican National Population Council (CONAPO). The 2015 social lag index, which is

87

a composite of several factors which are measured to estimate social disadvantage and

88

structural inequality based on population census data, was obtained from the Mexican

89

National Evaluation Council (CONEVAL); the social lag index is a principal component score

90

which comprises percentages of literacy, access to basic education, healthcare services, living

91

conditions including drainage, dirt floor, access to water, electricity and electrical appliances

92

for each Mexican municipality [13]. Data on available hospital beds at the end of 2019 were

93

extracted from the Mexican Ministry of Health and were standardized to projected 2020

94

population figures from CONAPO [14]. For this work we considered all SARS-CoV-2

95

positive cases and, particularly, cases in individuals aged ≥60 years.

96

Definitions of COVID-19 cases, predictors, and outcomes

97

Suspected COVID-19 cases were defined as an individual of any age whom in the last 7 days

98

has presented ≥2 of the following: cough, fever, or headache, accompanied by either dyspnea,

99

arthralgias, myalgias, sore throat, rhinorrhea, conjunctivitis or chest pain. Amongst suspected

100

cases, the Ministry of Health establishes two protocols for case confirmation: 1) SARS-CoV-2

101

testing is done widespread for suspected COVID-19 cases with severe acute respiratory

102

infection and signs of breathing difficulty or deaths with suspected COVID-19, 2) for all other

103

cases, a sentinel surveillance model is being utilized, whereby 475 health facilities which

104

comprise a nationally representative sample evaluate ~10% of mild outpatient cases to provide

105

estimates of confirmed mild cases [15]. Demographic and health data are collected and

106

uploaded to the epidemiologic surveillance database by personnel from each corresponding

107

healthcare facility. Available variables include age, sex, nationality, state and municipality

108

where the case was detected, immigration status as well as identification of individuals who

109

speak indigenous languages from Mexico. Health information includes the status of diabetes,

110

obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), immunosuppression, pregnancy,

111

arterial hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and asthma. Date

112

of symptom onset, hospital admission, and death are available for all cases as an outpatient or

113

hospitalized status, information regarding the diagnosis of pneumonia, ICU admission, and

114

whether the patient required invasive mechanical ventilation.

117

We estimated age-specific incidence and mortality rates by standardizing cases per 1-year

118

increment to the corresponding projected population sizes and normalized it to reflect a rate

119

per 100,000 inhabitants. Incidence and mortality rates were plotted against age and smoothed

120

splines were fitted to model trends according to age profiles. Categorical variables were

121

compared using the chi-squared statistic and stratified according to age.

122

COVID-19 outcome models

123

Given the large structural inequalities in healthcare access across Mexico, we fitted mixed-

124

effects models which considered municipality of case occurrence as a random effect to control

125

for potential inequalities in healthcare access, aging structures, and unequal regional evolution

126

of the epidemic across regions. These models would also allow to include multilevel data, to

127

increase the precision of outcome estimates considering structural factors for each

128

municipality. Models were fitted using mixed-effects logistic regression using the

129

municipality of case occurrence as a random effect; p-values and confidence intervals were

130

estimated using the Laplace approximation within the lme4 and lmerTest R packages.

131

Risk of COVID-19 lethality in older adults

132

To model COVID-19 mortality risk in older adults we fitted Cox proportional hazard

133

regression models stratified by sex, including frailty penalties to accommodate multilevel data

134

and random effects for the municipality of case occurrence, approximating iterations using the

135

Newton-Raphson algorithm. Random effect estimates were exponentiated to calculate baseline

136

mortality hazards across municipalities to represent geographical heterogeneity. Models were

137

selected based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and performance was assessed

138

using Harrel’s c-statistic. To visualize increases in lethality risk for continuous variables and

139

quantify uncertainty for estimations, we performed post-estimation simulations using

bootstrapping with the simPH package. Proportional hazard assumptions were verified using

141

Schoenfeld residuals.

142

Impact of age, structural determinants, and comorbidities on mortality risk

143

To investigate the role of age in predicting mortality compared to structural factors and

144

comorbidities, we fitted sequential Cox proportional hazard models compared to only COVID-

145

19 pneumonia as a predictor and introduced either age, structural factors (i.e. social lag index,

146

private care), or increasing number of comorbidities as blocks. We compared models using

147

changes in the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC); the better models were those which

148

either minimized or had large changes in BIC. We also separately analyzed outcomes and

149

mortality for older adults without comorbidities to examine the role of structural factors

150

compared to age in relation to disease severity and COVID-19 lethality. A p-value <0.05 was

151

considered as the statistical significance threshold. All analyses were performed using R

152

version 4.0.0.

153

RESULTS

154

COVID-19 in Mexican adults ≥60 years

155

As of May 9th, 2020, we observed 7,029 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in adults aged ≥60

156

years, representing 21.0% of all confirmed COVID-19 cases (n= 33,460). Overall, the rate of

157

positivity in this population has been 35.1% which represents a ratio of 1.43:1 in positivity

158

amongst all evaluated cases. Despite the higher positivity rate, mortality rates are

159

disproportionally higher in this population segment. Amongst all 3,353 confirmed lethal cases,

160

1,626 have been recorded in older adults, indicating significantly higher lethality (6.53% vs.

161

23.13%). When standardizing incidence rates to population estimates per each 1-year increase,

162

the highest incidence rates occur between 55-65 years with a decrease in those aged >65 years;

163

regardless, mortality remains steadily higher for adults aged ≥60 years (Figure 1A, 1B).

164

Similarly, higher disease severity as assessed by hospitalization and ICU admission rates, as

165

well as requirements for invasive ventilation, were more frequent in older adults. Furthermore,

166

most comorbidities were clustered in older individuals and the rates of individuals having 2 or

167

more comorbidities were markedly higher for older adults (25.5% vs. 12.7%, p<0.001, Figure

168

1C, 1D).

169

COVID-19 outcomes and disease severity in older adults

170

We hypothesized that COVID-19 outcomes would be geographically heterogeneous;

171

therefore, we fitted mixed effect models considering the municipality of case occurrence as a

172

random effect. We identified that increasing age, male sex, smoking, diabetes, and obesity

173

were associated with increased pneumonia risk; similarly, for hospitalization we identified an

174

increased risk for older adults with CKD, COPD, diabetes, increasing age, and male sex.

175

Notably, both pneumonia and hospitalization risk were higher for older adults living in

176

municipalities with high social lag indexes, indicating an effect of structural inequalities

177

besides the aforementioned comorbidities in further increasing COVID-19 severity (Figure 2).

178

When assessing ICU admission risk factors, we identified increased likelihood with obesity

179

(OR 1.37, 95%CI 1.07-1.74); similarly, the risk for invasive ventilation was higher for older

180

adults with obesity (OR 1.45, 95%CI 1.16-1.81) and municipalities with high social lag index

181

(OR 1.35, 95%CI 1.09-1.67). Notably, in older adults without comorbidities (n=1,900), age

182

was not a significant predictor of pneumonia, the requirement for invasive ventilation, ICU or

183

hospital admission. We only observed a significant role for age in predicting pneumonia when

184

modeling an interaction effect with the social lag index (OR 1.034, 95%CI 1.002-1.067);

185

moreover, the social lag index alone was associated with increased risk of hospitalization (OR

186

2.060, 95%CI 1.459-2.909) and requirements for invasive ventilation (OR 1.582, 95%CI

187

1.045-2.780).

188

Health and structural determinants of COVID-19 mortality in older adults

189

Besides comorbidities, we identified that the social lag index was a predictor of COVID-19

190

lethality adjusted for age and sex (HR 1.327, 95%CI 1.174-1.500); the number of hospital

191

beds per 1,000 individuals was a protective factor for mortality (HR 0.983, 95%CI 0.973-

192

0.994) as was treatment received within a private healthcare facility (HR 0.403, 95%CI 0.288-

193

0.563). In multivariable analyses, we identified a higher mortality risk associated with age,

194

comorbid diabetes, obesity, immunosuppression, CKD, and pneumonia. Being treated in a

195

public care facility and increased values of the social lag index were also predictors of

196

COVID-19 lethality (Figure 3A).

197

Role of structural determinants, comorbidities, and age on COVID-19 severity and lethality

198

To assess improvements in model performance, we examined the effect of age, structural

199

factors, and comorbidities in improving prediction of COVID-19 lethality. Overall,

200

comorbidities offered the larger changes in predictive improvement for mortality, followed by

201

structural factors; models that included age had markedly smaller changes in BIC. Similarly,

202

the combination of comorbidities and structural factors showed lower BIC values compared to

203

the combination of either of them with age (Figure 3B). The better model, which included

204

age, structural factors, and comorbidities did not show marked improvements in predictive

205

ability compared to the model which excluded age (c-statistics 0.728 vs. 0.722, respectively).

206

To isolate the effect of age, we analyzed older adults without comorbidities; in these

207

individuals, the social lag index was a risk factor (HR 1.338, 95%CI 1.083-1.652) and

208

treatment in private care facilities a protective factor (HR 0.266, 95%CI 0.117-0.604) for

209

mortality in addition to pneumonia (c-statistic=0.758). Addition of age, despite offering

210

decreases in BIC, decreased the overall predictive capacity of the model (c-statistic=0.754).

211

Overall, in individuals without comorbidities, structural factors were better predictors of

212

mortality compared to age alone. Similarly, obesity remained as a significant predictor of

213

mortality even in individuals without other comorbidities (HR 1.373, 95%CI 1.045-1.804) and

214

was instead a predictor of increased risk of pneumonia (OR 1.948, 95%CI 1.473-2.576),

215

hospitalization risk (OR 1.706, 95%CI 1.256-1.317) and requirement of invasive ventilation

216

(OR 1.605, 95%CI 1.019-2.528), over chronological age. These latter findings suggest that the

217

obesity paradox observed in other acute respiratory infections is not present in older

218

individuals [16].

219

Post-estimation simulation of mortality risk prediction for continuous variables

220

When running post-estimation simulations in the model with all three categories, we identified

221

that compared to median age amongst older adults (72 years), those younger than the median

222

had lower mortality risk compared to those above. However, despite age being a predictor of

223

mortality, we did not observe significantly higher risk in individuals aged >80 compared to

224

individuals aged 70-80 years. Similarly, an increasing number of comorbidities and living in

225

municipalities with increasing social lag index were also related to monotonic increases in

226

mortality risk (Figures 3C-E). When considering baseline mortality hazard for older adults

227

with COVID-19 across Mexican municipalities, we identified significant disparities; notably,

228

higher risk areas were related to municipalities with higher social lag indexes which were

229

mostly nearby metropolitan areas (Figure 4A). Furthermore, when plotting baseline hazard

230

ratios using the number of hospital beds available per 1,000 inhabitants, we observed that

231

higher risk occurred in municipalities with five or fewer beds per 1,000 inhabitants. Since the

232

distribution of cases has not been homogeneous and most high-risk areas were near

233

metropolitan areas, we performed a sub-analysis restricted to those locations (n=5377, 1122

234

deaths). Interestingly, the social lag index was not a significant predictor of mortality in

235

metropolitan areas (HR 1.087, 95%CI 0.782-1.511), but being treated in a private care facility

was (HR 0.489, 95%CI 0.331-0.725), suggesting a rural-urban dissociation on the factors

237

which impact lethality.

238

DISCUSSION

239

Here, we demonstrate the role of health and structural socio-economic determinants in

240

increasing COVID-19 lethality and disease severity independent of age in older Mexican

241

adults. Notably, we observed that whilst age is a significant predictor of COVID-19 lethality,

242

comorbidities, and structural health determinants likely play a larger role in increasing disease

243

severity and conditioning risk of COVID-19 lethality in older patients. In older adults without

244

comorbidities, age was not a predictor of disease severity with structural factors playing a

245

larger role; in addition, mortality prediction in individuals without comorbidities did not

246

significantly improve when considering age added to structural factors. We therefore

247

confirmed a preoccupying association of increased COVID-19 lethality with increasing values

248

of the social lag index, which considers deficiencies or unequal access to education,

249

healthcare, living conditions, and basic services; furthermore, being treated in private facilities

250

also decreases the risk of COVID-19 lethality, suggesting a significant gap between care

251

received in public compared to private facilities for older adults or better accessibility for

252

private care. These results demonstrate that the consequences of large socio-economic

253

inequalities within Mexico, which represent added burdens to multimorbidity in older adults,

254

both of which are better predictors of mortality compared to chronological age, and must be

255

addressed as the pandemic transitions to more rural areas where limited access to health

256

services and older population structures with adverse multimorbidity profiles increase

257

mortality risk.

258

Data from countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic have reported higher mortality rates

259

in older adults, particularly in those with an increasing number of comorbidities [17]. These

260

observations have led to distinct problems concerning healthcare decisions in the face of

261

COVID-19. Given the overwhelming effect of COVID-19 on healthcare burden for countries

262

with older population structures, many systems have opted for health resources to be allocated

263

based mainly on chronological age [18,19]. Whilst evidence of an age-dependent increase in

264

the expression of the ACE2 gene has been reported and an increasing number of comorbidities

265

are readily observed in older adults with COVID-19, data which demonstrates biological

266

effects of chronological aging over multimorbidity and health disparities on outcomes has not

267

been reported [5,20]. Instead, additional effort should be carried out to reduce disparities in

268

healthcare access, reduce socio-economic inequalities and improve care in older adults with

269

multimorbidity to reduce its effect on increasing COVID-19 severity, given their predominant

270

effects over chronological age in increasing COVID-19 severity and lethality [21,22]. A

271

previous analysis by our group which considered COVID-19 cases in Mexico highlighted how

272

the cardio-metabolic burden in younger patients approximated mortality risk to those observed

273

in older COVID-19 patients without comorbidity [23]. Our results in this present study show

274

that chronological age only offer modest improvements in mortality risk predicction and does

275

not predict disease severity in older adults without comorbidities. This evidence advocates for

276

bioethical decisions on resource allocation in overwhelmed healthcare systems to not be based

277

on chronogical age as an exclusive criteria, but rather to integrally consider comorbidity

278

profiles and establish a framework which works towardws ameliorating the impact of socio-

279

economic inequalities on COVID-19 outcomes for older adults as the pandemic progresses.

280

The response of Mexican authorities to promote social distancing amongst older adults has

281

thus far been consistent. A nation-wide stipend was established by the current administrtation

282

to support older adults throughout Mexico and advanced payments were released to reduce the

283

financial burden of COVID-19 [24]. Despite these policies, our data shows that older adults

284

who live in highly marginalized municipalities remain at higher risk of COVID-19 severity

285

and mortality, which might likely indicate unaddressed gaps that must be considered to reduce

286

the impact of COVID-19 on older adults, particularly from highly marginalized communities

287

and ethnic groups within Mexico [25]. Inequalities which might arise once social distancing is

288

lifted must also be addressed to facilitate reincorporation of older adults into daily life and

289

geriatric care must be secured to reduce the impact of social distancing on the general health

290

of older adults, particularly those living in isolation and with multimorbidity [26].

291

Obstacles for healthcare access in older adults have been consistently associated with

292

worsened outcomes and increased all-cause mortality, particularly for those facing social

293

inequalities [27]. Previous research has shown that negative self-perceived aging influences

294

healthcare-seeking behavior, particularly in settings of limited healthcare access [28,29]. Our

295

results suggest that reduced healthcare access, as measured by increases in the social lag

296

index, and lesser number of available hospital beds are associated with increased COVID-19

297

severity and lethality in older adults, likely reflecting the effect of structural inequalities across

298

Mexican municipalities. When exploring the interaction of this index with increasing age, we

299

observed a non-significant increased trend for mortality risk (HR 1.006, 95%CI 0.996-1.016,

300

p=0.053), suggesting that these deficits may have larger impacts in the oldest old. A recent

301

geroscience approach to the COVID-19 pandemic in the US, Italy, and China demonstrated an

302

exponential increase in COVID-19 lethality with age and similarly observed male-biased

303

mortality as in the Mexican data, potentially implicating aging mechanisms into COVID-19

304

lethality in older adults [30]. However, as shown by our results, in older adults without

305

comorbidities the effect of age was not a predictor of disease severity; furthermore, structural

306

factors and comorbidities were better predictors of mortality compared to chronological age.

307

These findings of individual and structural factors relating the individual with its environment

308

are in line with the multidimensional concept encapsulated by intrinsic capacity, which is a

309

composite of physical and mental capacities which define and individual’s functional ability.

310

These deficits might be

311

adults. Intrinsic capacity should be evaluated as a risk factor for COVID-19 and other

312

infectious diseases in older adults in future studies to better understand it as a predictor of

313

mortality over chronological aging [31,32].

314

Ageism and self-perceived aging might impact healthcare-seeking decisions in older adults,

315

particularly under a widespread perception of increased healthcare burden during the COVID-

316

19 pandemic [11,33]. An additional factor to consider in this setting is the fact that awareness

317

of COVID-19 symptoms is directed towards typical disease presentations and might not

318

account for atypical symptoms and presentations which are more likely to occur in older

319

patients [34,35]. Overall, given the significant impact of COVID-19 on older adults, our

320

findings call for more integral approaches to spread awareness of COVID-19 in older adults in

321

Mexico and other countries, addressing information gaps which might reduce healthcare-

322

seeking behavior and reducing ageism as a criteria for bioethical decision-making. Moreover,

323

evidence regarding atypical COVID-19 presentations and identifying factors that decrease

324

mortality in older adults to increase awareness and promote healthcare-seeking behavior in

325

high-risk remain as a relevant unaddressed gap which must be undertaken by future studies

326

Our approach is robust given that it considers national data on all confirmed COVID-19 cases

327

in older adults with significant representation of most regions within Mexico. Inclusion of

328

multilevel data allowed us to identify structural factors related to COVID-19 lethality and

329

outcomes and to contrast the role of these factors and comorbidities as predictors of COVID-

330

19 severity and mortality, highlighting areas of opportunity to address these and future

331

affections which will likely also impact older adults. A potential limitation of our study is the

responsible for the increased COVID-19 risk observed in older

332

lack of symptom-specific data which could be helpful to characterize atypical presentations of

333

COVID-19 in older adults and identify early predictors of disease severity and potential

334

recovery as has been seen in some series, and which remains to be addressed in future studies

335

to better characterize the course of COVID-19 in older adults [36]. Finally, an additional

336

limitation of our work could be related to underreporting of mild cases in marginalized areas

337

due to a lack of widespread testing, which might inflate mortality estimates for those regions,

338

but which also would indicate a significant challenge for handling the COVID-19 epidemic in

339

marginalized communities moving forward. Our findings could inform public policy related to

340

ethical decision making for older adults by prompting consideration of factors beyond

341

chronological age and promote further studies in older populations, which remains imperative

342

to address aging in populations undergoing an epidemiological transition with increased

343

morbidity burden, such as Mexico.

344

In conclusion, we characterized predictors of COVID-19 outcomes in older Mexican adults,

345

including potential predictors related to structural inequalities which increase COVID-19

346

severity and lethality risk. We demonstrated that comorbidity profiles and structural factors

347

are better predictors of COVID-19 severity and mortality compared to chronological age.

348

Overall, baseline COVID-19 mortality hazards are unequally distributed for older adults in

349

Mexico. Special attention should be given to underprivileged older populations to ameliorate

350

the impact of these factors which increase lethality in older adults with multimorbidity. These

351

findings could aid in shifting the current clinical and ethical decision-making focus away from

352

chronological aging and onto a more integral and comprehensive geriatric care approaches.
