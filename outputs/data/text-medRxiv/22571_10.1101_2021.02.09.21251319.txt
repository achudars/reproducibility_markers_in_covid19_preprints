Abstract
The effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on response to mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is not
well-described. We assessed longitudinal SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses pre- and
post-vaccination among individuals with and without prior infection. The antibody response to
the first vaccine dose was almost two-fold higher in individuals who were seropositive before
vaccination compared to those who were seronegative, suggesting that prior infection primes
the immune response to the first dose of mRNA-based vaccine.

The impact of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection on antibody response to mRNA-based vaccines has
not yet been well-characterized. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
recently suggested that individuals with documented immunity might defer vaccination for 90
days to expedite access for those without immunity, but data supporting these guidelines are
limited.1 Specifically, there are few studies describing the response to vaccination among
previously infected individuals. Early reports suggest that prior infection may prime the immune
response to the first vaccine dose, but these reports did not assess longitudinal changes in
antibody levels before vaccination.2–4 This information is important as the timing of natural
infection and fluctuations in immunity over time may impact the vaccine response.5,6 Here, we
examined longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses among healthcare personnel (HCP)
with and without evidence of prior infection to examine the effect of natural infection on
vaccination response.
We conducted a longitudinal observational cohort study of HCP at a large academic medical
center, which began enrolling in July 2020. Its purpose was to examine risk factors for infection
and identify changes in antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 over time.7 The study was approved by the
University of North Carolina Institutional Review Board (20-0942), and informed consent was
obtained from all participants. Enrolled individuals provided blood samples every two weeks for
the first 12 weeks and monthly thereafter. mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations (PfizerBioNTech [BNT162b2] and Moderna [mRNA-1273]) were available to HCP from the insitution
starting in mid-December 2020 or earlier through vaccine trials. For all pre- and post-vaccination
samples, we measured total immunoglobulin antibodies specific to the receptor binding domain
of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by ELISA as previously described.8 We used a positive to
negative ratio (P/N) cut-off of 2.57 to ensure 99.5% specificity per CDC recommendations for
SARS-CoV-2 serology assays.9 Exact Wilcoxon rank sum tests with corresponding 95%
confidence intervals (CI)10 were used to compare median P/N levels between seropositive and
seronegative participants and change in P/N for those with paired pre- and post-vaccination
measurements.
As of February 17, 2021, the study has enrolled 213 HCP with 194 (91%) providing at least one
blood sample. One individual was excluded from this analysis due to co-enrollment in a SARSCoV-2 treatment trial. Table 1 presents the cohort demographics. Five participants (3%) had
antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at their baseline study visit, herein “prevalent seropositive” (Figure
1a). Notably, one demonstrated persistent seropositivity for over six months, while another
remained seropositive for more than three months before reverting to seronegative one month
prior to vaccination. Five participants (3%) became seropositive during the study, herein
“incident seropositive” (Figure 1a); four of those five individuals (80%) reported COVID-19
symptoms prior to seroconversion.
Most participants (97%, 187/193) received at least one dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-based
vaccine as part of the institution’s vaccination program or through a vaccine trial. Antibody
measurements after at least one vaccine dose were available for 60% (6/10) of seropositive and
48% (87/183) of seronegative participants. One individual tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by
PCR shortly after the second vaccine dose (V2); post-V2 results were excluded for this
participant. We compared antibody responses to the first vaccine dose between participants
who were seropositive (at any point) and those who were seronegative prior to vaccination
(Figure 1b). Figure 1b shows that seropositive individuals developed an almost two-fold higher
antibody response to their first vaccine dose (median P/N=13.8) compared to those who were
seronegative (median P/N= 7.6; difference estimate 6.53 (95% CI: 1.6-10.4), Wilcoxon test
statistic (W) = 227, p=0.014). Additionally, the post-V1 antibody response in seropositive
participants was of similar magnitude to the post-V2 response among seronegative participants

(post-V1 seropositive median P/N 13.8 vs. post-V2 seronegative 12.2; difference estimate 1.68
(95% CI: -3.3-6.0), W=202, p=0.462). The absolute magnitude of the increase in antibody levels
from pre-vaccination to post-V1 was greater for seropositive than seronegative participants
(median change in P/N from pre to post-V1 seropositive 10.5 vs. seronegative 6.4; difference
estimate 2.66 (95% CI: -1.6-5.8), W=181, p=0.22).
Our findings provide preliminary evidence that prior SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact the
immune response to the first dose of mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Specifically, we
observed that the response to one vaccine dose among seropositive individuals was almost
two-fold higher than that of seronegative individuals and of similar magnitude to the response to
two vaccine doses among seronegative individuals.
Our study is limited by a relatively smaller sample size of seropositive compared to seronegative
participants and should therefore be replicated by future work. However, we noted a significant
difference in response to the first vaccination despite the small sample size, and our results
corroborate recent non-peer-reviewed findings.2–4 We also extend previous work by
demonstrating that the observed immune respone to vaccination among seropositive individuals
is robust across varying patterns of antibody responses over time and regardless of timing of
past infection, which ranged from 1 to 6 months prior to vaccination.
In conclusion, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to prime the immune response to the first
dose of mRNA-based vaccine. Further research on the durability of the response to the first
dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine among previously infected individuals could help guide the
allocation of the limited supply of mRNA-based vaccines. As 27 million Americans have been
infected with SARS-CoV-2 to date,11 the potential for some individuals to forgo a second
vaccination may have substantial impact on vaccine distribution strategies.

Figure 1. Antibody levels of healthcare personnel over time (a) and in response to
vaccination (b). Panel (a) demonstrates antibody levels over time in SARS-CoV-2 seronegative
(triangles) and seropositive individuals, including those who were seropositive at enrollment
(prevalent seropositive, circles) and those who became seropositive during follow-up (incident
seropositive, squares). The dotted line is a P/N ratio of 2.57, the cut-off associated with 99.5%
specificity (SARS-CoV-2 Ig-positive above the line, Ig-negative below). The x-axis represents
weeks to first vaccine dose; values post-vaccine 1 are shaded. Panel (b) shows box plots with
the medians and interquartile ranges of P/N ratios pre-vaccination, post-vaccine 1, and postvaccine 2 by serostatus (seronegative: n(-), seropositive: n(+)).The upper and lower whiskers
extend to the largest and smallest values no further than 1.5 times IQR from the hinge,
respectively. Data beyond the end of the whiskers are outliers. For the pre-vaccine time point,
the most recent antibody level prior to vaccination (for those who were vaccinated) or most
recent antibody level overall (for those who were not vaccinated) is shown. For the post-vaccine
time points, the first measurement after 5 days post-vaccination is included. The black numbers
next to the circles indicate the number of days between vaccination and sample collection for
seropositive individuals (V1: median 9, range 6-20; V2: median 17.5, range 6-25; Supplemental
Figure 1). For seronegative participants, the median time between the first vaccine dose and
sample collection was 16 days (range 6 to 34 days); between the second vaccine dose and
sample collection it was 17 days (range 6 to 33; Supplemental Figure 1).
