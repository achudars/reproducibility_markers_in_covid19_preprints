Abstract

Objective: To assess potential methods of reducing visible aerosol generation during

clear corneal phacoemulsification surgery in the era of Covid-19.

Methods: Aerosol generation during phacoemulsification was assessed using a

model comprising a human cadaveric corneoscleral rim mounted on an artificial

anterior chamber. Typical phacoemulsification settings were used and visible aerosol

production was recorded using high speed 4K camera. Aerosolisation was evaluated

under various experimental settings: Two different phacoemulsification tip sizes

(2.2mm, 2.75mm), varying levels of corneal moisture, the use of suction and blowing

air in the surgical field, the use of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) coating of

the cornea with a static and moving tip.

Results: This model demonstrates visible aerosol generation during

phacoemulsification with a 2.75mm phacoemulsification tip. No visible aerosol was

noted with a 2.2mm tip. The presence of visible aerosol is unrelated to corneal

wetting. Suction in close proximity to the aerosol plume did not impact on its

dispersion. Blowing air redirected the aerosol plume towards the ocular surface.

NOTE: This preprint reports new research that has not been certified by peer review and should not be used to guide clinical practice.

Visible aerosol production was abolished when HPMC was used to coat the cornea.

This effect lasted for an average of 67±8 seconds in the static model. Visible aerosol

generation was discerned during movement of the 2.2mm tip towards the corneal

wound.

Conclusions: We demonstrate visible aerosol production in the setting of a model of

a clear cornea phacoemulsification. Visible aerosol can be reduced using a 2.2mm

phacoemulsification tip and reapplying HPMC every minute during

phacoemulsification.

Introduction

Covid-19 is a pandemic disease with presentations that range from asymptomatic

cases, to mild respiratory infection, to severe acute respiratory syndrome with

associated mortality (1). The causative organism (coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) is

transmitted via fomites, droplets and aerosols carrying infective particles usually

originating from an infected person’s respiratory tract (2–4). There is concern that

healthcare workers may contract Covid-19 during aerosol generating procedures

(AGP) performed on patients carrying the disease (5). This has been shown to be of

particular importance in bronchoscopy, endotracheal intubation and extubation (3).

Phacoemulsification surgery is one of the most common operations performed

worldwide (6). Some ophthalmologists have concerns that it may be an AGP based

on the high-speed oscillations used to generate ultrasonic energy and the aerosol or

‘vapour’ plume that is sometimes observed during energy delivery. The detection of

SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in conjunctival swabs in a small proportion of affected

patients has raised the possibility of transmission of Covid-19 disease by this aerosol

(7,8). It is unknown how long it will take for the pandemic to be controlled, whether

and when effective vaccinations or treatments will be developed, and how routine

medical care may be performed in a manner that is safe for patients and healthcare

workers. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate different methods of reducing

visible aerosol generation during phacoemulsification surgery.

Setting

This study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. A fresh

human cadaveric corneoscleral rim was obtained from the NHS Blood and Transplant

for the training and research purposes. The rim was fitted on a Coronet™ artificial

anterior chamber (AAC) (Network Medical, Ripon, UK) and inflated with balanced

salt solution (BSS; Balanced salt solution; Beaver-Visitec International, Oxford, UK).

This was mounted within a model head used for cataract training (Phillips Studio,

Bristol, UK). A triplanar clear cornea incision was performed for use with sleeved 45-

degree angled Kelman phacoemulsification tips (Centurion Vision System; Alcon,

Camberley, UK). Typical phacoemulsification settings were used (continuous

torsional energy (90%), intra-ocular pressure 60 mmHg, vacuum 475mmHg,

aspiration flow 33cc/min, continuous irrigation on). Aerosol generation was assessed

using high speed 4K camera (Canon 5D mark IV, 100mm prime macro lens; Canon,

Tokyo, Japan) and lighting (Rotolight Neo II; Rotolight, Iver Heath, UK) under various

experimental settings:

A. Different sizes of phacoemulsification tips

Two phacoemulsification tips (2.2mm 0.9mm Intrepid FMS, 2.75mm 0.9mm ABS;

Alcon, Camberley, Surrey) were used with matching clear corneal wounds (ClearCut;

Alcon, Camberley, Surrey).

B. Dry/wet status of the cornea

The cornea was wetted by application of BSS on the surface. Drying of the corneal

surface was achieved using cellulose eye spears (Weck-Cel, Beaver-Visitec

International, Oxford, UK).

C. Suction and blowing air

Suction was achieved using a standard Yankauer suction tip at maximal suction and a

Bair Hugger™ (3M, Minnesota, USA) was used to blow ambient-temperature air in

the vicinity of the surgical field.

D. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 2% on the corneal surface

The use of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 2% (HPMC) (Aurovisc; Aurolab, Madurai,

India & Beaver-Visitec International, Oxford, UK) on the corneal surface was

compared to BSS. The duration between the reduction in aerosolisation with the

application of HPMC and the observation of aerosol was measured 6 sequential

times. Copious BSS irrigation was used to clear the residual HPMC between each

trial.

E. Static/dynamic setting

The static setting was achieved by mounting the phacoemulsification probe on a

vertical stand for fixation and the tip was introduced 2.5mm (using a reference mark

on the sleeve) towards the centre of the AAC reproducing standard orientation (Fig.

1). In the dynamic trial, the surgeon handled the phacoemulsification probe to move

the tip inside the AAC to simulate nuclear sculpting, longitudinally along its axis.

Results

This model used a human cadaveric corneoscleral rim and an artificial anterior

chamber to demonstrate aerosol production during phacoemulsification.

Phacoemulsification was performed using a standard 2.75mm phacoemulsification

tip with typical ultrasound and phacofluidic settings (Fig. 2, Video 1). No visible

aerosol was identified when using the 2.2mm tip with identical ultrasound and

phacofluidic settings (Fig. 3, Video 2).

The aerosol produced by the 2.75mm tip did not vary depending on corneal wetting.

This aerosol was still evident when the corneal surface was dried (Video 3). Attempts

to aspirate the aerosol plume generated by negative pressure or suction using

Yankauer suction were unsuccessful (Fig.4a, Video 4). Downward positive air

pressure using forced air at ambient temperature altered the morphology of the

plume generated, redirecting the upward aerosol plume downwards and then

laterally along the ocular surface (Fig.4b, Video 5).

Coating the corneal surface with HPMC resulted in a prominent change: no visible

aerosol production was demonstrated during phacoemulsification in the static

model where the handpiece was fixed within the AAC (Fig.5, Video 6). This effect

lasted for an average of 67±8 seconds (range 63-72s) of continuous

phacoemulsification in the static model (Video 7).

When continuous phacoemulsification was performed in a dynamic fashion, with the

2.2mm tip mimicking the longitudinal action of nuclear sculpting, no visible aerosol

generation was discerned during the majority of the movement. The exception was

noted when the tip was just proximal to the corneal wound when the aerosol plume

was clearly visualised (Video 8).

Discussion

Since the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic, the risk to healthcare workers

contracting the disease from potentially infectious droplets and aerosol during

aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) has been explored by several studies analysing

the pattern of droplet spread during simulated medical interventions (9,10).

Simulations published online have attempted to model aerosol generation during

phacoemulsification using video recording and application of the ultrasound energy

at either an air-fluid interface or using model eyes (11). The former is not

representative of the closed system that is required for effective and safe

phacoemulsification. Similarly, plastic model eyes have different structural

properties to the human eye and due to this, it is challenging to extrapolate any

meaningful conclusions using these models. Currently, there are no published

reports of similar studies in the peer-reviewed literature.

Artificial anterior chambers (AACs) are utilised in corneal graft surgery for donor

tissue preparation (12). Once the human corneoscleral rim is mounted on the AAC, a

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.14.20102301; this version posted May 18, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

single leak-free chamber is formed allowing the maintenance of ‘intraocular

pressure’. This model allows simulated surgery for lamellar graft procedures using

human cadaveric tissue and addresses the above limitations of other experimental

models.

We utilised a novel application of this model to consistently demonstrate the aerosol

or ‘vapour’ plume that is observed in the real world setting during

phacoemulsification with a 2.75mm tip. The plume appears to originate from the

corneal wound. This may be due to vibration transmitted from the

phacoemulsification probe to the lip of the corneal wound.

It is impossible to

determine whether the aerosol generation seen with this experimental set up is due

to agitation of moisture on the surface of the cornea or small amounts of BSS that

can egress through the corneal wound around the probe. Visible aerosol following

emulsification with a dry cornea supports the latter. The reduction in visible aerosol

seen with the 2.2mm tip may be explained by less wound leakage. This was noted in

an ex vivo study comparing wound leakage in an ex vivo comparison of 2.2mm and

2.75mm tips (13).

Following this, we evaluated different methods of attenuating this aerosol plume

and demonstrate two potential approaches. The first approach involves forced air

directed at the microsurgical field to disperse the aerosol downwards and laterally.

In a operating theatre, this set up would be challenging as the air would have to be

filtered and humidified to prevent infection and corneal drying respectively with the

setup of the microsurgical field to incorporate a suitable air flow device potentially

being problematic. Portable surgical laminar flow systems used for cataract surgery

may be configured to drive any aerosol produced away from healthcare workers,

allowing precipitation onto surgical drapes and subsequent disposal.

Suction did not influence the plume despite close proximity of the Yankauer suction

tip to its source and maximum suction. This is likely to be due to a limitation in the

instrument used, as custom devices have been developed to effectively remove

vapour during corneal ablation using excimer laser (14).

The second approach uses hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 2% (HPMC) to coat the

corneal surface during phacoemulsification. HPMC is a low-viscosity and moderate

viscoelasticity material commonly used to coat the cornea to improve intraocular

visualisation during surgery and has proven safety (15).

Analysis of video recordings highlight that visible aerosol generation is abolished

when HPMC is applied to the corneal wound. This effect lasted for approximately

one minute. It is possible that when HPMC coats the corneal wound and

phacoemulsification probe, it acts as a barrier to either aerosol formation or

dispersion. Its higher molecular weight and elasticity may also act as a damper to the

ultrasonic energy preventing agitation and consequent aerosolisation. This effect

was consistent using two different brands of HPMC and may apply to other types of

viscoelastic materials.

Efforts to reproduce the longitudinal action of nuclear sculpting showed that, in

contrast to the static model, visible aerosol was only produced when continuous

phacoemulsification was performed close to the corneal wound despite HPMC

coating. The close proximity of the ultrasound energy to the cornea may generate

aerosol by either agitating the HPMC coat off the cornea or directly diminishing

HPMC’s barrier function. The reduced aerosol production at other points during the

dynamic experiment may be due to less deformation of the corneal wound by the

surgeon despite efforts to minimise this when using the static model and represents

a limitation of this study. This study only analysed aerosol production using

continuous torsional phacoemulsification and may not be representative of other

modes of ultrasound energy delivery.

This study investigated visible aerosol generation from phacoemulsification using a

clear corneal wound and may not represent aerosol produced from a limbal corneal

wound. As this study focused on visible aerosol generation only, it is impossible to

comment on generation of invisible aerosol particles that are not discernable by this

experimental setup. There is uncertainty about whether these particles can form in

the absence of visible aerosol generation and if so, whether these particles pose a

risk of transmitting Covid-19 disease to healthcare workers.

The first part of this study aimed to reproduce the ‘vapour’ plumes observed in real

world cataract surgery. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first in peer-

reviewed published literature to demonstrate visible aerosol generation during

phacoemulsification.

We cannot comment on the risk of transmission from an infected patient to

healthcare workers by the visible aerosol generated. Currently, it is unknown

whether viable SARS-CoV-2 particles can be aerosolised in sufficient quantities to

form an effective inoculum for transmission to healthcare workers. The following

should be considered when estimating this risk: is there an effective SARS-CoV-2 viral

load present in or on the ocular tissues of an asymptomatic or undiagnosed patient

undergoing cataract surgery, and is the visible aerosol plume formed during cataract

surgery is composed of BSS or intraocular fluids. We offer suggestions to deal with

these uncertainties.

Topical povidone-iodine is virucidal with in vitro testing of 0.23% povidone-iodine

producing a 10,000-fold reduction in the viral load of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV

within 15 seconds (16-18). Topical povidone-iodine is widely used in ophthalmic

surgery for surgical antisepsis and would destroy any viable SARS-CoV-2 particles

present on the ocular surface.

There may be concern that the aerosol generated by phacoemulsification could

contain virus-infected intraocular fluid. The majority of this intraocular fluid is visco-

expressed before capsulorrhexis. The concern about any remaining infected

intraocular fluid should be alleviated by applying statistical and mathematical

principles. The mean volume of the anterior chamber measured with optical

coherence tomography is 0.17±0.04 ml (19). If the volume of the anterior chamber is

normally distributed, three standard deviations would 99.7% of the population

would have an anterior chamber volume of less than 0.29 ml.

Phacoemulsification cataract surgery occurs in a closed system and

irrigating/aspirating BSS through the anterior chamber with the phacoemulsification

probe results in a dilution of intraocular fluid that obeys first order decay: for every

0.29 ml of BSS that passes through, the concentration of the original intraocular fluid

is decreased by 50%. When 2.03 ml of BSS has circulated in the anterior chamber,

the concentration is reduced to less than 1% of the original concentration. Using

conventional aspiration rates ranging from 20-40 cc/min, this will take at most 3 to 6

seconds in 99.7% of the population. Performing this irrigation/aspiration step for a

aspiration rate-dependent duration prior to phacoemulsification will significantly

decrease the proportion of any remaining intraocular fluid (and consequently any

theoretical virus load) in any aerosol produced.

We then investigated methods of mitigating of any potential risk from the aerosol

produced by phacoemulsification, with the prospect of aiding the resumption of

elective cataract surgery as we navigate through this pandemic. Findings from the

study show that use of a 2.2mm phacoemulsification tip where possible and copious

administration of HPMC every minute during phacoemulsification reduces visible

aerosol generation.
