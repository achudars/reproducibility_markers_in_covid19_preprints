Background: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID19), the novel respiratory illness caused by severe

22

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with severe morbidity

23

and mortality. The rollout of diagnostic testing in the United States was slow, leading to

24

numerous cases that were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 in February and March 2020,

25

necessitating the use of serological testing to determine past infections.

26

Methods: We evaluated the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG

27

antibodies by testing 3 distinct patient populations.

28

Results: We tested 1,020 serum specimens collected prior to SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the

29

United States and found one false positive, indicating a specificity of 99.90%. We tested 125

30

patients who tested RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 for which 689 excess serum specimens

31

were available and found sensitivity reached 100% at day 17 after symptom onset and day 13

32

after PCR positivity. Alternative index value thresholds for positivity resulted in 100% sensitivity

33

and 100% specificity in this cohort. We tested 4,856 individuals from Boise, Idaho collected over

34

one week in April 2020 as part of the Crush the Curve initiative and detected 87 positives for a

35

positivity rate of 1.79%.

36

Conclusions: These data demonstrate excellent analytical performance of the Abbott SARS-

37

CoV-2 IgG test as well as the limited circulation of the virus in the western United States. We

38

expect the availability of high-quality serological testing will be a key tool in the fight against

39

SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

43

Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID19) is a novel respiratory illness caused by Severe acute

44

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel Sarbecovirus that recently emerged

45

from Wuhan, China in late 2019 (1). COVID-19 often progresses to lower respiratory tract

46

illness and can be associated with severe morbidity and mortality (2).

47

Serological testing can detect past cases of SARS-CoV-2 for which RT-PCR testing was

48

either not performed or for which nasopharyngeal swab sampling resulted in false negatives.

49

Serological tests require exceptional sensitivity and specificity, especially when seroprevalence

50

is low, in order to have adequate positive predictive value (3). To date, most SARS-CoV-2

51

serological tests on the market have inadequate performance characteristics to perform

52

widespread population or clinical testing (4). Here, we evaluated the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG

53

test for use on the Abbott Architect platform. This assay detects IgG antibodies against the

54

SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein.

55
56

Methods

57

Patient Cohorts

58

Specificity samples were derived from de-identified excess serum specimens sent to our clinical

59

virology laboratory in 2018 and 2019. Sensitivity specimens were derived from excess serum

60

specimens sent for clinical testing from persons who tested RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2

61

during March and April 2020. With the exception of the studies of biologic precision, for

62

patients with an IgG result on more than 1 aliquot on a specific date following onset of

63

symptoms or PCR positivity, only the mean index value for that patient-day was included in the

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.27.20082362; this version posted May 2, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

64

data set to minimize the bias from individual patient seroconversion and variable numbers of

65

samples per patient. For the calculations of sensitivity and specificity at the patient level using

66

the manufacturer’s recommended index value cutoff of 1.40 (Figure 1), patients were assumed

67

to be seronegative for each day preceding the most recent negative IgG result and to be

68

seropositive for each day following an initial positive result. Serum specimens sent from the

69

Boise, Idaho metropolitan area were collected over a one-week period in late April 2020 as part

70

of the Crush the Curve initiative. This work was approved under a consent waiver by the

71

University of Washington IRB.

72
73

IgG Testing

74

Serum samples were run on the Abbott Architect instrument using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG

75

assay after FDA notification following manufacturer’s instructions. The assay is a

76

chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay for qualitative detection of IgG in human serum

77

or plasma against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein. The Architect requires a minimum of 100µL of

78

serum or plasma. Qualitative results and index values reported by the instrument were used in

79

analysis.

80
81

Data analysis and visualization

82

Patient demographic information (sex and age) was extracted alongside laboratory order and

83

result data (including index value) from the laboratory information system (Sunquest

84

Laboratory, Tuscon, AZ). Partial AUC analysis and data visualization were performed using the R

85

packages pROC, ggplot2, and cowplot (5, 6).

Results

88

Sensitivity and Specificity of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG Assay

89

To determine assay specificity, we used 1,020 deidentified serum specimens from 1,010

90

different individuals sent to our laboratory for HSV Western blot serology in 2018 and 2019,

91

before SARS-CoV-2 was thought to be circulating in Washington State and the United States (7).

92

One serum specimen from this set tested positive with an initial index value of 1.41 and

93

repeated at 1.49, above the Abbott-determined positivity cutoff of 1.40 (Figure 1A). All other

94

specimens tested negative, leading to an assay specificity of 99.90% in pre-COVID-19 serum.

95

To determine assay sensitivity, we used a series of 125 patients who tested RT-PCR

96

positive for SARS-CoV-2 for which 689 excess serum specimens comprising 415 unique patient

97

follow-up days were available. The vast majority of these patients were hospitalized at the

98

University of Washington Medical Center-Northwest Campus in Seattle, WA between March

99

and April 2020. Fifty-eight percent of patients were male and 42% female. The age distribution

100

by decade of life was: 20-29: 2.4%, 30-39: 4.8%, 40-49: 9.6%, 50-59: 17.6%, 60-69: 17.6%, 70-

101

79: 24.0%, 80-89: 16.0%, >= 90: 8.0%.

102

The sensitivity of the assay from the estimated day of symptom onset for the 125

103

patients included in our chart-review study was 53.1% (95%CI 39.4%-66.3%) at 7 days, 82.4%

104

(51.0-76.4%) at 10 days, 96.9% (89.5-99.5%) at 14 days, and 100% (95.1%-100%) at day 17 using

105

the manufacturer’s recommended cutoff of 1.4. The sensitivity from the date of PCR positivity

106

was: 88.7% (78.5-94.4%) at 7 days, 97.2% (90.4-99.5%) at 10 days, 100.0% at 14 days (95.4-

107

100.0%), and 100.0% (95.5-100.0%) at 17 days using the manufacturer’s recommended cutoff

108

of 1.4. Intriguingly, 22 of 88 individuals (25%) for which serum was available on the first day of

109

PCR positivity had simultaneous detection of serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and nasopharyngeal

110

SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Figure 1B).

111

We next used our SARS-CoV-2 IgG index values over 415 unique patient-days to assess

112

the change in index value over time, from the date of symptom onset (Figure 1C) and first

113

positive PCR result (Figure 1D). For these patients early in the course of their infections, index

114

values consistently increased over time, both on the review of individual patients with multiple

115

IgG results over time and aggregate summary data.

116

Based on our data suggesting consistent seroconversion and the low false positive rate

117

in our specificity study, we next asked what optimal index value cutoffs were for different days

118

after onset of symptoms or PCR positivity. Partial AUC analysis was performed setting the

119

minimum specificity between 99.0% and 99.9% (Tables 1-2), to minimize false positives given

120

the low seroprevalence to SARS-CoV-2 expected in our population and to identify the optimal

121

index thresholds for different potential uses of the test. These analyses indicated that optimal

122

thresholds for the serologic diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 was 1.42-1.49 at ≥ 17 days from symptom

123

onset (sensitivity and specificity 100%); 0.7 at ≥ 14 days from onset (Sens 97.9%, Spec 99.6%);

124

0.7 at ≥ 10 days from onset (Sens 94.4%, Spec 99.6%); and 0.7 at ≥ 7 days from onset (Sens

125

88.0%, Spec 99.6%) (Figure 2).

126

Given our large unique data set, we next assessed the biologic variation of the antibody

127

results in PCR positive patients by examining all test results where at least 3 remnant serum or

128

plasma samples were available from the same day for the same patient. The coefficient of

129

variation was calculated for each of 75 available patient-days and plotted against the index

130

value (Figure 3A). The reproducibility of the measurable anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG response was

131

robust across the index value range except for 2 situations: 1) higher CV’s associated with very

132

low index values <0.1 related to analytical ‘noise’; and 2) higher CVs related to the rapid change

133

in antibody levels associated with active seroconversion. The CV was < 10% for all included

134

patient-days above an index value of 0.4 except for 4 data points representing 3 different

135

patients in the process of seroconversion. For 3 of these 4 patient-days with CVs >10%, samples

136

had been drawn several hours apart. To further examine the process of seroconversion in

137

individual patients, we identified 7 patients that had IgG results available on at least 5 different

138

patient-days and in whom we captured the process of seroconversion, plus 1 patient that

139

appeared to be in the process of seroconverting, but did not cross positivity threshold (Figure

140

3B). In addition to assessment of the biologic variation, traditional analytic precision was

141

determined: the same remnant sample was analyzed 5-10 times on each of 3 Abbott Architect

142

instruments, yielding individuals CVs of between 1.4% and 2.5% and a cumulative CV of 2.6%

143

(cumulative mean 2.26).

SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Survey in Boise, Idaho

We tested 4,856 individuals from Boise, Idaho sampled over one week in late April 2020

148

as part of the Crush the Curve initiative to determine anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in this

149

community. The age distribution of this cohort was: 0-19: 4.9%, 20-29: 6.2%, 30-39: 17.1%, 40-

150

49: 22.7%, 50-59: 23.5%, 60-69: 18.3%, 70-79: 6.7%, 80+: 0.5% (Table 3). The cohort had a

151

greater representation from female individuals with 54.2% female, 41.9% male with 3.9%

152

unknown. We detected 87 positive specimens in this cohort corresponding to a seroprevalence

153

of 1.79%, using the manufacturer’s index value threshold of 1.40. Seroprevalence was higher

154

among males at 2.1% than it was among females at 1.6%. Those without a reported gender had

155

a seropositivity of 2.6%. Seroprevalence was highest among those over 80 years (4%), 60-69

156

year-olds (2.5%), and 20-29 year-olds (2.3%), and was lowest among those under 19 years of

157

age (0.4%).

Discussion
Here we report the performance characteristics of the recently available Abbott SARS-

161

CoV-2 IgG assay. Using the manufacturer’s recommended index value cutoff of 1.40 for

162

determining positivity, we report an assay specificity of 99.9% from 1,020 pre-COVID-19 serum

163

specimens and sensitivity of 100% at 17 days after symptom onset and 13 days after PCR

164

positivity. Our results mirror that of the assay package insert, which details a 99.6% specificity

165

from 1,000 SARS-CoV-2 specimens and 100% sensitivity by day 14 after specimens.

166

In our own cohort, we found increasing the threshold would have resulted in a 100%

167

specificity and 100% sensitivity at 17 days post-symptom onset. However, the optimal

168

threshold may depend on the intended clinical use of the test and the characteristics of the

169

target population. Given limitations of clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing for various

170

sample types, IgG serology with an applied low threshold may be a useful adjunctive diagnostic

171

for patients with negative PCR results who have been symptomatic for ≥ 7 days with a clinical

172

presentation consistent with COVID-19 disease. In contrast, a higher threshold might be

173

considered for PCR-negative asymptomatic patients for assessing previous undiagnosed

174

infection. For laboratories reporting a single diagnostic result for both populations, it may be

175

useful to report an inconclusive range corresponding to an OD ratio of roughly 0.8-1.5 with a

176

recommendation for repeat testing to minimize false negative results associated with

177

seroconversion. At this time, repeat serology may be preferable to a diagnostic algorithm using

178

a secondary assay, as no specific confirmatory assay with sufficient sensitivity and specificity

179

exists at this time.

180

Our serological validation was chiefly limited by use of excess serum specimens from a

181

mostly hospitalized population known to be very recently infected with SARS-CoV-2. This

182

convenience sample meant that PCR and serology data were not available for each day since

183

symptom onset, requiring us to censor follow-up days accordingly (e.g. days before if the first

184

longitudinal serological result was positive or days afterward if the last serological result was

185

negative). The majority of patients in this study were elderly individuals – 65.6% were older

186

than 60 years of age – many of whom also had altered mental status at time of presentation,

187

complicating our ability to accurately ascertain symptom onset. The elderly, hospitalized

188

population used in our sensitivity cohort could account for the delayed time to positivity seen in

189

our cohort versus the Abbott package insert (17 vs 14 days post-symptom onset), as declining

190

immune responses are associated with advanced age (8). It is unclear what the prevalence of

191

antibody is in individuals with subclinical or asymptomatic infections. We were also restricted

192

to limited descriptive epidemiological information on the serological survey conducted within

193

the Boise, Idaho metropolitan area. The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test is also limited in that it only

194

detects IgG antibodies directed against nucleocapsid and cannot be used for recombinant spike

195

protein vaccine studies.

196

Overall, our data demonstrate excellent performance of the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-

197

2 IgG Assay and a high level of consistency with the package insert. Our data reinforce the

198

limited circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in the Pacific Northwest during early 2020. We expect high-

199

quality serological testing will be an important component of the diagnostic approach to SARS-

200

CoV-2.

Figure 1 – Performance characteristics of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test. A) Specificity was

251

determined using 1,020 serum specimens taken before circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in the United

252

States. Index values by sample are shown in rank order, and sample with index values greater

253

than 0.7 are labeled. B) Sensitivity by day since symptom onset and PCR positivity is depicted

254

for 689 excess serum specimens comprising 415 unique patient follow-up days from 125 unique

255

patients, using the manufacturer’s recommended positivity index value cutoff of 1.40. Index

256

values are depicted by day since symptom onset (C) or PCR positivity (D). Index values were

257

averaged for patients with multiple specimens from the same day. The index value threshold of

258

1.40 for positivity is depicted in the red horizontal dashed line.

Minimum specificity was set to 99.5%.

Figure 3 – Variation among biological replicates is explained by seroconversion. A) Coefficient of

265

variation versus index value is depicted for biological serum replicates from individuals who had

266

more than 3 serum or plasma draws from the same calendar day. Specimens taken from

267

individuals who were seroconverting during the repeat sampling period are shown in red. B)

268

Index value over time since symptom onset is shown for seven individuals who seroconverted

269

and one who failed to meet the positivity threshold during the sampling period. Each individual
