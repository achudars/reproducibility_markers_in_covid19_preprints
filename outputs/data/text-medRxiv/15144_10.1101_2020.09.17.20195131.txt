Abstract
Background
To identify blood donors eligible to donate Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) Convalescent Plasma
(CCP), a large blood center began testing for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19.
We report the seroprevalence of total immunoglobulin directed against the S1 spike protein of SARSCoV-2 in US blood donors.
Methods
Unique non-CCP donor sera from June 1–July 31, 2020 were tested with the Ortho VITROS Anti-SARSCoV-2 total immunoglobulin assay (positive: signal-to-cutoff (S/C) ≥1). Donor age, sex, race/ethnicity,
ABO/RhD, education, and experience were compared to June and July 2019. Multivariate regressions
were conducted to identify demographics associated with the presence of antibodies and with S/C
values.
Results
Unique donors (n=252,882) showed an overall seroprevalence of 1.83% in June (1.37%) and July (2.26%),
with the highest prevalence in northern New Jersey (7.3%). In a subset of donors with demographic
information (n=189,565), higher odds of antibody reactivity were associated with non-Hispanic Native
American/Alaskan (NH-NAA/A) and Black (NH-B), and Hispanic (H) race/ethnicity, age 18-64, middle
school or lesser education, blood Group A, and never or non-recent donor status. In positive donors
(n=2,831), antibody signal was associated with male sex, race/ethnicity (NH-NAA/A, NH-B and H) and
geographic location.
Conclusions
Seroprevalence remains low in US blood donors but varies significantly by region. Temporal trends in
reactivity may be used to gauge the effectiveness of public health measures. Before generalizing these
data from healthy donors to the general population however, rates must be corrected for false positive
test results among low prevalence test subjects and adjusted to match the wider demography.

Introduction
Convalescent plasma is an investigational treatment for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) that was recently granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).1 Most people develop neutralizing
antibodies to its etiologic agent, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) during
recovery from symptomatic illness. Historically, passive immune therapy has shown utility in other
respiratory diseases (SARS-1, MERS, H1N1 and Spanish influenza).2 As such, antibody-containing COVID19 convalescent plasma (CCP) from recovered donors has been transfused to those at risk for
progressive disease in hopes of preventing life-threatening COVID-19. In a meta-regression analysis of
seven small matched-control and randomized, controlled trials assessing the efficacy of CCP, a 57% odds
reduction in mortality was observed in CCP recipients (absolute risk reduction 12%).3 In a study of
>35,000 CCP recipients, significant reductions in 7- and 30-day mortality were correlated with earlier
transfusion and higher immunoglobulin unit content.4 Accordingly, there is a need to identify and recruit
individuals for CCP donation who have sufficient levels of circulating neutralizing antibodies against
SARS-CoV-2 to meet rising demand and prepare a strategic reserve against successive waves of
infection.

Recruiting individuals for CCP donation is challenging. Most programs began with hospitals referring
recovered COVID-19 patients to blood collection establishments.5 The need for CCP has been publicized
by governmental agencies, blood banking organizations, hospitals and blood collectors. Despite ample
news outlet coverage, shortages of CCP occurred at program inception and again with case resurgence
after relaxation of pandemic control restrictions. Eligibility criteria for CCP donation have evolved since
the March 2020 FDA announcement of an emergency Investigational New Drug (IND) pathway for CCP
administration. On April 3, 2020, FDA announced an expanded access program collecting open-label
safety data, which just recently closed after FDA issued its EUA on August 23.4,5 To be effective, it is
believed that CCP should contain adequate amounts of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Since
laborious tissue culture techniques are required for this assay, clinical criteria and binding antibody tests
have been proposed as surrogates. Donation criteria have included allogeneic plasma-eligibility with
evidence of COVID-19 documented by laboratory testing, with complete resolution of symptoms for at
least 14 days and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers, if available. Throughout successive iterations
of FDA Guidance, CCP donor eligibility criteria have remained the same.5

SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections are not believed to represent a significant risk to blood
safety.6,7 Screening blood donations for SARS-CoV-2 virus appears unwarranted. However, screening
blood donors by serological methods to identify individuals with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could serve
other purposes. Surveillance studies document significantly higher numbers of infections than those
defined by reported cases.8 This reflects individuals with asymptomatic illness, those with milder
symptoms who did not seek medical care, and those who could not undergo testing. Because of the
reduced positive predictive value of antibody testing in low prevalence groups, orthogonal testing and
statistical adjustments must occur to assist in interpretation and generalize data to larger populations.
Unadjusted serial sampling for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can assess community viral spread in relation to
containment measures or their relaxation. Antibody studies can also determine demographic risk
factors, allow assessment of the durability of the immune response, and potentially detect reinfection
when signal strength intensifies. Most important, high-throughput semi-quantitative binding antibody
assays correlating with defined titers of neutralizing antibodies may identify and qualify donors for CCP
donation while also identifying units with higher antibody titers.

Global efforts are ongoing to determine the country-specific prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.
However, in the vast majority, less than 10% of the population has been exposed to the virus, far below
the 40-60% thought necessary for herd immunity.9,10 We describe the first two months’ results of
serologic testing of healthy blood donors using a single total binding antibody assay conducted by the
largest independent US blood center and its affiliate to help identify donors eligible to provide CCP.

Despite the best performance in a study of four high-throughput tests commonly available in the US, the
S/C ratio in the Ortho VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total Ig test (CoV2TIg),
which we used to screen donors, does not precisely correlate with neutralization titers.11,12 S/C ratios on
this platform do however, correlate with the presence of binding antibody across the test’s high
dynamic range. Ratios have been reported to be higher in those recovering from more-severe COVID19.13 We thus also sought to characterize the signal strength of positive samples.

Methods
Donor Testing
Vitalant began testing all allogeneic whole blood and apheresis donors for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on
June 1, 2020 to identify individuals potentially eligible to donate CCP. LifeStream, a Vitalant affiliate,

commenced testing on June 8, 2020. Donors are asked to refrain from donating within 28 days of
COVID-19 symptoms or diagnosis. They are informed about antibody testing and give consent for the
research use of anonymized information, blood and blood samples. Test results are reported to donors
using a secure portal for information and recruitment purposes.

Serum is tested using sample tubes collected with successful donations and routinely sent to Creative
Testing Solutions (CTS - Bedford, TX ; St. Louis, MO; Tampa, FL; Tempe, AZ). SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing
uses the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total Reagent Pack (CoV2TIg, Ortho
Clinical Diagnostics, Rochester, NY) on VITROS XT 7600 and 3600 instruments. The test has been FDAauthorized under an Emergency Use Authorization as an aid in identifying individuals with an adaptive
immune response to the virus. CoV2TIg is a chemiluminescent immunometric test qualitatively
measuring total antibody (IgG, IgM and IgA) to SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike antigen. Results with signal-to-cutoff
(S/C) ratios ≥1 are reported as positive.

CTS transmits test results and S/C ratios to centers’ blood establishment computer systems (BECS). A
data warehouse extract (excluding CCP donations) was performed for all donations from June 1 to July
31, 2020 in our six BECS instances which included anonymized, encoded donation numbers and donor
identifiers along with test results. Unique donor results were used to characterize the rate of COVID-19
antibody reactivity within geographic collection regions. Anonymized donor demographics were
available for the largest BECS instance (eProgesa, MAK-SYSTEM, Paris, France) comprising ~75% of
tested collections. This subset database included:
• Donor demographics: age, sex, race/ethnicity, ABO/RhD, highest education level, and experience
(first-time, active [prior presentation within 2 years], or reengaged [prior presentation >2 years
ago])
• Donation information: date, Vitalant regional collection center, drive type (fixed site or mobile), and
antibody test S/C result.
First-donation data were used if there was more than one tested donation in the analyzed time periods.

Statistics
Donor demographic data for non-CCP donations from June 1 to July 31, 2020 were compared with the
those from successful donations obtained on the same dates in 2019 for a subset of donors from the

eProgesa BECS which contains information about donor race/ethnicity and highest education level.
These proportions were compared using chi-square tests.

This subset database was also used to conduct an analysis of donor demographics associated with the
presence of antibodies and with S/C ratios. An unadjusted logistic regression was initially performed to
assess the crude association of each category with a positive antibody test. Multivariate logistic analysis
was then performed to calculate the adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) (Stata
15.1, Stata Corp., LLC, College Station, TX, USA). The final model included all donor and donation
characteristics. The log10-transformed S/C from donors with positive CoV2TIg test results were
regressed against seven donor demographic characteristics and blood type using general estimating
equations for main effects (Proc Mixed, SAS v9.4, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Main effects with p<0.05 were
retained in the final model. The log10 S/C ± 2SE was estimated from the final model, then converted back
to linear S/C (estimated geometric mean ± 2SE). Estimated differences between categories were
assessed using the model.

Results
From June 1 through July 31, 2020, 254,499 unique donors completed a whole blood or non-CCP
apheresis donation of which 99.4% yielded tubes tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Table 1). Figure 1
shows the changing rate of antibody reactivity across the geographies in which Vitalant and its affiliate
collect blood. There was a demonstrable increase in overall seroprevalence from 1.37% in June to 2.26%
in July. Of the 16,383 individuals donating more than once during this time period, 35 donors (0.2%)
seroconverted between their first and a later donation within the 2-month time period.

Comparison data from the large subset of donors for which expanded demographic information was
available revealed significant differences in donor composition between the same time periods in 2019
and 2020 (Table 2), in addition to greater overall turnout (Table 1). COVID-19 public gathering
restrictions resulted in a 19% reduction in mobile collections, while fixed site donations rose by 59%. Of
individuals successfully donating, increases were seen in the fraction of females, non-Hispanic Whites,
those with post-high school degrees and people aged 30 and over. Greater numbers of first-time and
reengaged donors also chose to donate. Unpublished data from April and May 2020, before donor
testing was offered, showed demographic shifts similar to those observed in June and July 2020.

Univariate comparisons of antibody positivity by sex, race/ethnicity, age, education, blood group, donor
experience, collection site type and region are presented in Table 2. Results of the multivariate analysis
for factors associated with positive antibody test results by donor and donation characteristics is
presented in Figure 2. While no significant differences were observed for sex and RhD, there were
differences by age, race/ethnicity, education, ABO blood group, donation experience, collection site
type and region. Compared with non-Hispanic White donors, those who are non-Hispanic Native
Americans/Alaskans and Blacks, or Hispanic donors were significantly more likely to have a positive test
result. Individuals aged 18-29 had the highest odds of a positive result, but those 30-64 were also
significantly more likely than those under 18 or over 64 to be positive. Compared with individuals with a
high-school degree, those with no high-school experience were much more likely to test positive.
Donors with graduate degrees were slightly less likely to have a positive test result. A small but
statistically-significant increase was seen in blood Group A donors compared with Group O individuals.
First-time and reengaged donors also had a higher risk for antibody-positive results. Donors at the
reduced number of mobile drives had a slightly lower risk for antibody positivity. Figure 2B shows the
adjusted geographical differences in seroprevalence, expected on the basis of reported variations in
community COVID-19 incidence over time.

The distribution of donor S/C values is shown in Figure 3. In June and July 2020, 2,948 reactive donors
had a CoV2TIg S/C ≥ 1. The first donor visit S/C was available for analysis for 2,831 donors (median
68.8, IQR 17.0-177, geometric mean 48.2, maximum 961). Log10 transformation demonstrates a leftskewed distribution (Figure 3B). Supplemental Table 1 outlines the log10 and back-transformed S/C data
in 2,831 donors with positive antibody test results.
We further examined the association of donor and donation site characteristics with S/C in CoV2TIgpositive donors. The association of 7 donor demographic characteristics and blood type was explored
with the log10-transformed S/C in a multivariate regression model of these main effects (Table 3).
Highest education level, collection site type, and ABO-RhD interaction were found to have insignificant
contributions and were removed from the model. Main independent variables with significant effects on
the S/C were donor sex, race/ethnicity, donor experience, and regional center. Variable subcategories
are shown in Figure 4 and the fully-adjusted model-estimated S/C ± 2SE compared to the overall modelestimated geometric mean (45.2). Females had small, but significantly lower S/Cs than males; nonHispanic Native American/Alaskan, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic groups’ values were significantly

higher than the average; and the Denver Region had the highest adjusted S/C of all 19 examined. The
overall effect of donor experience was significant. Although not significantly different from the model
mean (p>0.05), first-time donors’ S/Cs are an estimated 1.3 units higher than active donors’ (p=0.0004).

Discussion
We present seroprevalence data from a large cohort of geographically-diverse healthy blood donors
over the first two months of SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing on the CoV2TIg platform. The overall
seropositive rate was 1.83% amongst 252,882 unique donors tested. The rate in the second month of
testing was higher than the first month. In multivariable analysis, higher reactivity rates were associated
with middle school or lesser education (unadjusted point estimate, 14.8% positive), age (highest result
[3.0%] in those 18 to 29 years old), race/ethnicity (highest point estimate in non-Hispanic Blacks [2.9%]),
and first-time donors (2.7% compared with 1.2% in active donors). There was a small, but statisticallysignificant increase in reactivity seen in blood Group A donors, and a lower risk in donors attending the
declining number of mobile collections. Significant regional differences were observed, with June/July
unadjusted positive rates highest at 7.3% in the Newark, NJ area and the lowest rate (0.4%) south/east
of Rapid City, SD.

SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance studies are beginning to appear in the literature. As data are compared, it
is important to consider the characteristics of the population studied, geographic location, dates of
testing, and screening laboratory methods. A 13.7% prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was reported
in 40,329 healthcare personnel in the New York City area, tested from April to June 2020.14 This study
employed 7 different assays of spike- and nucleocapsid-directed IgG and total antibody. Two relatively
small reports in Canadian blood donors using the Abbott Architect IgG assay revealed low rates: 2.23%
of 7,691 donors in Quebec tested over a 6-week period and <1% of 10,000 blood donors in one month
of testing from all other provinces.15

Demographic associations of test positivity in blood donors have not yet been reported. Compared with
a similar period in the preceding year, the demography of blood donors significantly changed with the
enactment of COVID-19 safety requirements. Contributors to shifting donor demographics included the
replacement of cancelled mobile drives with more-limited geography fixed site appointments, ongoing
needs messaging via public service announcements and perhaps, the announcement of testing in June.
This observed demographic shift was similar to other, shorter-lived post-disaster responses.16 Donors

responding to messaging about the need for blood increased the year-over-year number of summer
donations. Female donors, non-Hispanic Whites, those with post-high school degrees and donors over
age 29 disproportionately responded to appeals. A greater proportion of first-time and former blood
donors answered the call. As noted, this was not clearly linked with the initiation of SARS-CoV-2
antibody testing as these demographic shifts were present in April and May 2020 before CCP-eligible
donor screening began. Greater fractions of antibody reactivity in new and reengaged donors does
however, suggest some effect from the announcement of antibody testing.

SARS-CoV-2 binding Total Ig antibodies appear to be stable over months for individuals with previous
infection and are thus suited for surveillance studies.11,17 While well suited for surveillance, these results
do not correlate as closely with neutralizing antibody titer, which may be an important direct or proxy
measure of CCP potency. Other assays in which antibody reactivity wanes over time are less suited to
detect previously-infected individuals but tend to correlate more closely with neutralizing antibody
titer.18 In our study, higher S/C values for spike Total Ig were associated with male sex, non-Hispanic
Native American/Alaskan and Black race/ethnicity, and Hispanic ethnicity. Whether this correlates with
the severity of infection or indicates a more vigorous immunologic response remains to be determined.
First-time donors and individuals in geographies with a higher prevalence of antibody reactivity also had
higher S/C values.

FDA recently defined a “high” neutralizing antibody titer cutoff in a specific assay associated with a 21%
reduction in 7-day mortality amongst non-intubated patients compared with recipients of lower-titer
CCP units in the Mayo expanded access program.19 FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research
(CBER) has stated its intention to review the acceptability of alternative binding antibody tests to be
used to designate high- versus low-titer CCP, which must be labeled as such beginning December 1,
2020.20 Identifying donors more likely to have higher antibody titers is thus a meaningful exercise.

This study has several limitations. First, this is an initial report on the first two months of screening blood
donors for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2; continued reporting is necessary to define trends as public health
measures are enacted and relaxed. Second, there is a lack of donor clinical information
(symptomatology and laboratory confirmation of infection by PCR) and no orthogonal supplemental
testing has been conducted to weed out false-positive test results in this low-prevalence population.
These limit the ability to correlate antibody reactivity and S/C strength with the presence or severity of

symptoms. Last, blood donors are a significantly healthier population than the general public, with
substantially different demography than the general population. Generalization of data from this group
of tested individuals to the population at large must be corrected for potential false positive test results
and adjusted to reflect the demography of the general population before estimates of pathogen
exposure are valid. Trends over time however, are valuable in the evaluation of imposition or relaxation
of efforts to limit spread of the disease. While longitudinal studies are under way to better characterize
pathogen exposure, data like ours also provide a rapid estimate of regional differences in the number of
infected individuals as we progress through substantial morbidity and mortality toward herd immunity.10

As commonly seen in the setting of traumatic events, blood donor demographics changed during the
COVID-19 pandemic. We reported on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and the correlates
influencing reactivity. Our report complements the growing number of surveillance studies in various
populational groups.

Figure 4: Positive-Antibody Donor S/C Multivariate Model Estimates – The classification variables of donor sex, race/ethnicity, and collection region had a
significant effect on the S/C estimate (p<0.015). Shown are estimated geometric means [± 2SE] for subcategories within classification variables.
Estimated overall geometric mean was 45.2 [23.5-86.6]. The overall effect of donor experience was significant. Although not significantly different
from the model mean (p>0.05), first-time donors’ S/Cs are an estimated 1.3 units higher than active donors’ (p=0.0004). (X: reference category, □:
estimate statistically-significantly different from reference; : estimate NOT significantly different from reference)
