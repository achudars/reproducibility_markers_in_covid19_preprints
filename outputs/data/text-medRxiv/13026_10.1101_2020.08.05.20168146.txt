ABSTRACT
Background: Northwell Health (Northwell), an integrated health system in New York, treated
more than 15000 inpatients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) at the US epicenter of the
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. We describe the
demographic characteristics of COVID-19 mortalities, observation of frequent rapid response
teams (RRT)/cardiac arrest (CA) calls for non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and factors that
contributed to RRT/CA calls.
Methods: A team of registered nurses reviewed medical records of inpatients who tested
positive for SARS-CoV-2 via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) before or on admission and died
between March 13 (first Northwell inpatient expiration) and April 30, 2020 at 15 Northwell
hospitals. Findings for these patients were abstracted into a database and statistically analyzed.
Findings: Of 2634 COVID-19 mortalities, 56.1% had oxygen saturation levels greater than or
equal to 90% on presentation and required no respiratory support. At least one RRT/CA was
called on 42.2% of patients at a non-ICU level of care. Before the RRT/CA call, the most recent
oxygen saturation levels for 76.6% of non-ICU patients were at least 90%. At the time RRT/CA
was called, 43.1% had an oxygen saturation less than 80%.
Interpretation: This study represents one of the largest cohorts of reviewed mortalities that also
captures data in non-structured fields. Approximately 50% of deaths occurred at a non-ICU level
of care, despite admission to the appropriate care setting with normal staffing. The data imply a
sudden, unexpected deterioration in respiratory status requiring RRT/CA in a large number of
non-ICU patients. Patients admitted to a non-ICU level of care suffer rapid clinical deterioration,
often with a sudden decrease in oxygen saturation. These patients could benefit from additional
monitoring (eg, continuous central oxygenation saturation), although this approach warrants
further study.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
Evidence before the study
The world first learned of SARS-CoV-2 through a landmark study published by the Lancet in
January 2020. Early evidence was limited due to the novel nature of the virus, clinician
inexperience in treating COVID-19, small sample size of primarily hospital inpatients in early
observational studies, use of structured datasets for data collection, and early and evolving
treatment guidelines. We collected evidence from leading medical journals from January 2020
through June 2020 that primarily describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 (eg, patient
age, sex, and comorbidities) as well as the different approaches to treatment that were being
used. Our search consisted of real-time publications as they became available. Analyzing the
characteristics of patients who died can help to define the clinical nature of COVID-19 and
potentially suggest new care protocols.
Added value of this study
Unlike prior research, our study represents one of the largest cohorts of COVID-19 mortalities
abstracted from both structured and unstructured fields in the medical record using data collected
during the surge of infections in the New York metropolitan area in March through April 2020.
Our study identified an unusual pattern of respiratory decompensation in patients who presented
to the hospital with acceptable oxygen saturation levels and were therefore admitted to a nonICU setting for care. Through our unique analysis, we identified a cohort of patients who
experienced a rapid response team/cardiac arrest call after a sudden and unexpected decrease in
their oxygenation saturation levels.

Implications of available evidence
Our findings, based on over 2600 inpatient mortalities, suggest that there is a subpopulation of
patients who are admitted to a non-ICU setting where continuous oxygenation saturation
monitoring is not a standard, but may be warranted. Further research is needed to understand
which patients are at highest risk for mortality, due to age and comorbidities, and the
implications of continuous monitoring on mortality rates. This finding is relevant to a wide
audience of national and international health care providers.

INTRODUCTION
Downstate New York was the first epicenter of the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in the United States.1-2 Northwell Health (Northwell), an
integrated health system, treated more than 15000 inpatients with coronavirus disease (COVID19). Comprehensively analyzing the characteristics of those who died can help define the clinical
nature of COVID-19 infection and potentially suggest new care protocols. For 7 years, Northwell
has used a centralized mortality review process with data validated through rigorous internal
review and inter-rater reliability (92% to 96%). This robust process used a customized database
to review all 2634 COVID-19 mortalities in Northwell’s adult acute care hospitals between
March and April 2020. During this overwhelming surge, documentation was in various notes, as
well as in structured fields in the electronic health record (EHR) systems. This study describes
the demographic characteristics of COVID-19 mortalities and the observation of frequent calls
for rapid response teams (RRT)/cardiac arrest (CA) in patients not in the intensive care unit
(ICU). It also discusses factors that contributed to the RRT/CA calls, which may be a significant
element in planning for a pandemic resurgence.

METHODS
Northwell is New York State’s largest health care provider and private employer. With 23
hospitals (including specialty hospitals) and nearly 800 outpatient practice sites, the organization
cares for over 2 million people in greater metropolitan New York. A team of registered nurses in
the corporate quality department retrospectively reviewed medical records from 15 acute care
hospitals. This team routinely conducts clinical reviews of all adult acute inpatient mortalitiesapproximately 5000 per year. A physician advisor was available to the team to consult on clinical
questions.
Database elements were based on Northwell’s experience with treating COVID-19 patients,
literature review from countries that had early experience in treating patients, and clinical trials
being conducted at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research. Also, the data were captured in
the database established under the direction of critical care intensivists at the epicenter of the
pandemic, other subject matter experts, and quality leadership. During data abstraction,
modifications and enhancements were made to the database based on trends and emerging
information. Demographics, comorbidities, clinical findings, and management of COVID-19
patients who died were analyzed.
Analyzed cases included inpatients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) before or on admission and then died between March 13 (first Northwell
inpatient death) and April 30, 2020. Emergency department (ED) mortalities were excluded.
Demographic data and comorbidities were abstracted from the medical record on admitted
patients. Initially data were collected on ten patient comorbidities that were deemed important
and then narrowed down to six comorbidities for inclusion based on our initial analysis.
Transfers from one in-system hospital to another were merged and considered as a single visit.
One patient outcome measured was a call for RRT/CA.

RESULTS
Baseline characteristics of 2634 COVID-19 mortalities are described in table 1. The age range
was 21 to 107 years in the following categories: 21 to 39 (49; 1.86%), 40 to 59 (351; 13.3%), 60
to 79 (1241; 47.1%), and 80 and older (993; 37.7%). There were 1664 (63.2%) male and 970
(36.8%) female patients. Of all patients, 1256 (47.7%) were white, 463 (17.6%) black, 230
(8.7%) Asian, and 685 (26.0%) other/unknown. Insurance was Medicare for the majority of
patients (1839; 69.8%). The most common comorbidities among those collected were
hypertension (1719; 65.3%), diabetes mellitus (1043; 39.6%), and dementia (431; 16.4%). Fewer
patients had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (385; 14.6%), heart failure (291;
11.1%), and end stage renal disease (166; 6.3%). Of these six comorbidities, more than 50% of
patients had 2 or more comorbidities and 16.9% had 0 comorbidities. The majority of patients

with a known body mass index (BMI) of 25 or more were categorized as follows: 25 to 29.99
(732; 27.8%), 30 to 34.99 (401; 15.2%), 35 to 39.99 (190; 7.2%), and 40 or higher (147; 5.6%).
Most patients were admitted from home (1895; 71.9%). Of the remaining patients, 411 (15.6%)
were admitted from a skilled nursing facility (SNF), 201 (7.6%) from an acute care facility, and
127 (4.8%) from rehabilitation. The number of patients with a prior ED visit within 7 days of
admission was 125 (4.8%), and within 48 hours of admission was 51 (1.9%). The number of
patients readmitted within 30 days was 194 (7.4%), within 7 days was 75 (2.9%), and within 24
hours was 20 (0.8%). On presentation, most (1478; 56.1%) patients had an oxygen saturation
level greater than or equal to 90%, and 1397 (53.0%) required no respiratory support. Others
required nasal cannula (363; 13.8%), non-rebreather (742; 28.2%), and mechanical ventilation
(24; 0.9%). More than half of the patients who died (1403; 53.2%) required mechanical
ventilation during their clinical course. Of those patients, 1332 (94.9%) had increasing oxygen
requirements before intubation, 1259 (89.7%) were on traditional ventilators, 142 (10.1%) were
on converted BiPAP machines, and 2 (0.1%) were on anesthesia machines. The length of time on
mechanical ventilation was from 0 to 7 days for 851 (60.7%) patients and was 8 days or more for
552 (39.3%) patients.
Prone positioning was documented for 756 patients (28.7%), and 270 (10.3%) patients were
terminally weaned. Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders were complete for 1631 (50.2%) patients.
A palliative care consult was provided to 1014 (38.5%) patients. At the time of death, the level of
care was the ICU for 1299 (49.3%) patients and non-ICU for 1335 (50.7%) patients.
A total of 1112 (42.2%) patients had a RRT/CA call at a non-ICU level of care versus 1522
(57.8%) who did not. As shown in table 2 and table 3, the RRT/CA group was significantly
different from the non-RRT/CA group in terms of age, race, and comorbidities. There were 618
patients (55.6%) between 60 and 79 years old in the RRT/CA group compared to 623 patients
(40.9%) in the non-RRT/CA group. In terms of race, white was significantly lower in the

RRT/CA group (36.3% versus 55.9%; p<0.0001). The RRT/CA cohort had a significantly higher
rate of diabetes mellitus (44.2% versus 36.3%, p<0.0001). Patients in the RRT/CA cohort were
more likely to be admitted from home (926; 83.3%) versus the non-RRT/CA cohort (969;
63.7%). The RRT/CA cohort versus the non-RRT/CA cohort was more likely to be admitted to a
medical/surgical unit [(576; 51.8%) versus (654; 42.9%)] or telemetry/step-down unit [(455;
40.9%) versus (408; 26.8%)], and to die at an ICU level of care [(671; 60.3%) versus (628;
41.3%)]. An overall length of stay (LOS) of 8 days or more was higher for the RRT/CA cohort
(645; 58.0%) than the non-RRT/CA cohort (569; 37.4%), as was an ICU LOS of 0 to 7 days
[(472; 42.0%) versus (400; 26.3%)] and 8 days or more [(271; 24.4%) versus (303; 19.9%)].
After adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics, oxygen saturation levels at
presentation were significant for the RRT/CA cohort at oxygen saturation levels of 80% to 89%
[odds ratio (OR)=1.988; 95% CI: 1.511, 2.616] and of 90% or higher (OR=2.517; 95% CI:
1.962, 3.230). See logistic regression results (table 4).

DISCUSSION
This study represents a review of one of the largest cohorts of COVID-19 mortality that includes
data documented in non-structured fields within the EHR. The experienced team of registered
nurses was able to extract detailed information from the medical record that is typically not
included in a structured dataset analysis. The demographics of the patients who died is similar to
other published studies: age predominately over 69, male majority, payor mix [reflecting age and
Medicare, along with a low number of self-pay (41; 1.6%)], and multiple comorbidities.3-12
This study provides a detailed clinical picture of the circumstances that precede the sudden
deterioration in non-ICU patients reported by clinicians, but not fully examined in the literature.
A striking feature of COVID-19 that has been reported is the rapid progression of of respiratory
failure soon after the the onset of dyspnea and hypoxemia.13 The National Institutes for Health

(NIH) has reported that hypoxemia is common in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and that
the criteria for hospital admission, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mechanical
ventilation differ between countries.14 In some hospitals in the United States, >25% of
hospitalized patients require ICU care, mostly due to acute respiratory failure.
Recommendations from the NIH are close monitoring for worsening respiratory status for adults
with COVID-19 who are receiving supplemental oxygen. These recommendations are aligned
with our findings in the non-ICU patient population.
Approximately 50% of deaths occurred at a non-ICU level of care, despite admission to the
appropriate care setting with normal staffing. Our analysis of 1112 patients who experienced at
least one RRT/CA at a non-ICU level of care revealed that 64.4% required an escalation in level
of care. Of the 1112 RRT/CA patients, 664 (59.7%) presented to the hospital with oxygen
saturation levels greater than or equal to 90%. In addition, 687 patients (61.8%) had no oxygen
support. Of the RTT/CA patients 1031 (92.7%) were admitted to a non-ICU level of care with
normal staffing levels which was appropriate based on their care needs. At presentation to the
ED, the oxygen saturation levels for these patients were significantly higher than those for
patients admitted to the ICU. Before the RRT/CA, the most recent oxygen saturation levels
recorded for the non-ICU patients remained high at greater than or equal to 90% for 852 patients
(76.7%). Oxygen saturations were documented within two hours of the RRT/CA in 454 (40.9%)
patients in the RRT/CA cohort. When the RRT/CA was called, 479 patients (43.1%) had an
oxygen saturation less than 80%, and 868 patients (78.1%) were on a non-rebreather/nonrebreather with nasal cannula. These data imply a sudden, unexpected deterioration in respiratory
status requiring an RRT/CA call in a large number of non-ICU patients.

LIMITATIONS
This study includes the following limitations. First, the study focuses on the demographic and
clinical characteristics of in-hospital COVID-19 patients who died between March 13, 2020 and
April 30, 2020; it does not provide a comparison group of similar patients who survived during
the same time period. Second, data were obtained from the EHR and manually abstracted from
medical records through retrospective review, but some routine documentation was less detailed
due to the volume of patients being treated. Third, race was documented as other/unknown in
685 patients (26%); therefore, conclusions about race could not be drawn. Fourth, missing BMI
data were included in the category of “Unknown” BMI. Finally, the study does not recognize a
specific trigger that can distinguish which non-ICU patients in the cohort should be monitored.

CONCLUSION
Patients admitted to a non-ICU level of care appear to suffer a rapid clinical deterioration, often
with the hallmark of a sudden decrease in oxygen saturation. This finding suggests non-ICU
patients could benefit from additional monitoring, such as continuous central oxygenation
saturation. The availability of wireless patch monitoring should be considered, along with other
methods, such as carbon dioxide and/or cardiac monitoring. Although this approach does not
ensure reduced mortality, the number of RRT/CA calls infers this area warrants further study.
