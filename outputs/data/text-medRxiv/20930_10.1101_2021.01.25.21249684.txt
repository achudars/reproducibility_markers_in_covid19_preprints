Abstract
Background:
Covid-19 is a triphasic disorder characterized by a viral phase lasting 7-10 days from onset of
symptoms. In approximately 20% it is followed by a second stage heralded by elevation of proinflammatory markers such as ferritin, IL-6, CRP, LDH and D-dimers. We hypothesized that those
with few abnormalities would have a low risk for progression to respiratory insufficiency and
hence could be monitored at home without treatment.

Methods:

Inclusion criteria included Covid infection, age >21, Oxygen saturation >90%. To be observed
without treatment, patients could have no more than 1 of the following: CRP > 10 mg/dL, high
LDH, ferritin > 500 ng/ml, D-dimer > 1 mg/L, IL-6 > 10 pg/ml, absolute lymphocyte count
<1,000, Oxygen saturation <94%, or CT chest evidence of pneumonia. Primary endpoint was
progression to respiratory failure and secondary endpoints was 28-day survival.

Results:

Of 208 entered, 132 were low-risk and hence were monitored without therapy. None progressed to
respiratory failure or died.

Conclusions:

We have shown that our approach can identify cases who can safely be observed without
treatment, thus avoiding expensive, potentially toxic therapies, and circumventing unnecessary,

costly hospitalizations. These results support our hypothesis that applying our criteria, 64% of
Covid-19 cases can be monitored as outpatients without therapy.

What is already known about this subject:
•

COVID-19 is a triphasic disorder first typified by an infectious or viral phase that lasts
from the first onset of symptoms until 7-10 days later. This is followed by a second phase
considered as the inflammatory stage, characterized initially by the appearance of lung
infiltrates which is followed in some cases by hypoxemia.

•

Approximately 80% of patients never proceed to the second phase but currently there is no
reliable and objective method to accurately predict those that are cured spontaneously
without any treatment and who could be managed at home.

What this study adds:
•

We have developed an approach, based essentially on blood-based inflammatory markers
which identifies low-risk cases that do not require therapy and can be managed at home.
This method showed an excellent correlation with clinical outcome and has encouraging
financial and psychological effects.

•

Of 208 patients, 132, fulfilled criteria for low-risk disease that justified monitoring at
home without therapy and none of these developed respiratory failure or any other
significant complication.

•

Included in this low-risk group were many cases with comorbidities, with COVID-19
pneumonia, as well as patients older than 65 and with more than two symptoms at
presentation. These characteristics would usually portend an unfavourable prognosis, yet
all these patients had an excellent outcome.

Introduction
COVID-19 is a triphasic disorder first typified by an infectious or viral phase that lasts from
the first onset of symptoms until 7-10 days later. This is followed by a second phase
considered as the inflammatory stage, characterized initially by the appearance of lung
infiltrates which is followed in some cases by hypoxemia [1,2]. This second phase is usually
heralded by an elevation of serologic inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP),
ferritin, Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and LDH, as well as D-dimers [3-5]. In a smaller subset of cases
this is followed by a third phase characterized by hyperinflammation, leading to the cytokine
release syndrome or cytokine storm, that causes Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome
(ARDS) [1,2].
Approximately 80% of patients never proceed to the second phase. They are spontaneously
cured after the first stage [3,6]. This proportion is a crude estimate that can vary according to
several prognostic factors [3-5]. Currently there is no reliable and objective method to
accurately predict the 80% that are cured spontaneously without any treatment, vis-à-vis those
who develop severe illness. There is consensus that those presenting with severe illness
characterized by hypoxemia, should be managed in the inpatient setting, but there are no
rigorous, objective criteria to decide when non-hypoxemic patients with mild to moderate
illness should be hospitalized. Traditionally, they are admitted to the hospital if they present
with evidence of pneumonia or dyspnoea .
New drugs have recently become available for treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19
infections. These include remdesivir, and monoclonal antibodies such as bamlanivimab,
casirivimab and imdevimab. These new agents have the potential of reducing the number of

hospitalizations if applied early during the infectious process, however their cost can be quite
high, particularly in countries with fewer resources. Their overuse could be avoided if we had
a method to identify cases who do not require any therapy and who could be safely monitored
outside of the hospital setting.
Furthermore, excessive hospitalizations can overwhelm healthcare systems. A method to
identify cases that can be safely managed on an ambulatory setting could relieve this burden.
Finally, knowledge regarding the factors that predict the likelihood of disease progression
could help physicians decide who can be managed safely at primary care facilities and who
needs to be transferred to a tertiary care centre.
We hereby report on the results of the application of the risk-stratification stage of this phase
II clinical trial designed with two goals in mind:
1- To identify early during their illness low-risk patients who can be safely monitored at
home without treatment.
2- To identify patients with COVID-19 at high-risk of progressing to hypoxemic
respiratory failure, so they can be treated prophylactically with steroids early during
their clinical course to prevent them from developing ARDS or cytokine release
syndrome.
We prospectively classified COVID-19 patients by ranking them into high and low-risk,
according to blood-based biomarkers of inflammation, as well as other clinical features. We
hereby analyse the clinical outcome of those considered as low-risk. The current manuscript
exclusively describes the outcome of low-risk cases. The results related to the management of
high-risk cases will be the subject of a separate report.

Materials and Methods
Investigational plan:
The study was registered in clinicaltrials.gov as NCT04355247 and registered as such with the
local Institutional Review Board. Informed consent was obtained from each patient.
The original plan was to enter a total of 100 patients with the expectation that at least 20
would-be high-risk cases eligible for therapy with methylprednisolone and 80 would be
low-risk, eligible for monitoring without therapy. This expectation was based on the
available literature data [3,6] which describes a 20% chance for patients with COVID-19
to develop severe disease associated with respiratory failure. We later decided to expand
this pilot study to include at least 200 patients.
When the CALL score method was published [8], we amended the protocol to apply it
with the purpose of allowing us to more precisely predict the expected number of cases
that would develop respiratory failure. Using this prediction, we could then calculate the
expected number of cases and compare it with our therapeutic results using our riskassessment method. This CALL Score method considers the presence of comorbidities,
age, LDH level and lymphopenia to assign a prognostic score. The higher the score, the
worse the prognosis. A nomogram which is part of the CALL score, was used to predict
the risk of progression to respiratory failure [8].
Eligibility: Eligible patients for this protocol had to be over 21 years old with a diagnosis
of COVID-19 established by means of either the PCR molecular test (97% of cases) or
with the rapid serologic test in the context of typical symptoms and/or ground glass
infiltrates in the chest CT (3% of cases). There was no top age limit for entry. Excluded

from entry were those who already were in acute respiratory failure defined as
oxygen saturation <91%.

Definition of low-risk cases: For patients to be classified as low-risk, they could have only
one or none of the following abnormalities between days 7-10 after their first symptom: IL-6
> 10 pg/ml, Ferritin> 500 ng/ml, D-dimer > 1 mg/L (1,000 ng/ml), CRP > 10 mg/dL (100
mg/L), LDH above normal, lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count <1,000), oxygen
saturation between 91-94%, or CT chest with evidence of ground glass infiltrates. These
markers were selected based on published data which have shown a strong correlation with a
poor outcome [10 -15]. We also analysed the symptomatology at presentation to determine if
low-risk patients could be identified by the number of symptoms at diagnosis or by the type of
presenting symptoms.

Management: Patients classified as low-risk were monitored at home without treatment. They
were asked to check their oxygen saturation three times per day by means of pulse oximetry
and to report any value less than 94% during the first two weeks after entry. They were also
instructed to immediately report any unexpected change in their clinical condition. Patients
were also called daily for at least 28 days to inquire about their condition.

Statistical analysis: Medians and interquartile ranges (IQR’s) were used to describe
distributions of continuous variables, and proportions to describe distributions of categorical
variables. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used for testing hypotheses about the

difference between distributions of continuous variables, and the chi-square test for
categorical variables [16].

Results
We initially enrolled 213 patients, 5 of which were not evaluable because consent was
withdrawn (N=3), lost to follow up after suicidal attempt (N=1), and negative PCR for Covid19 (N=1). Of the remaining 208 patients, 132 (63.5%) fulfilled criteria for low-risk, hence
they met conditions for monitoring at home without therapy, while the remaining 76 were
classified as high-risk and treated with methylprednisolone.
The median follow-up time was 84 days (range 31-263) for a total of 10,956 person-days of
follow up with interquartile range of 44. At the time of diagnosis, 97 (73.4%) of the low-risk
cases, were polysymptomatic, presenting with 2 or more of the following symptoms: fever,
cough, myalgia, diarrhoea, anosmia, dyspnoea, or headache. Only 15 of the low-risk cases
were either asymptomatic (11 cases) or minimally symptomatic (4 cases) with nasal
congestion and sore throat, suggesting that low-risk cases, as defined by our criteria, cannot be
accurately identified by using the number or types of symptoms at presentation. In addition,
there were 48 cases who had a chest CT done at time of diagnosis and of these, 17 presented
with typical ground-glass infiltrates.
Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics of all 208 cases including low as well as highrisk cases. High-risk patients were significantly older than low-risk. Similarly, the number of
comorbidities was significantly greater in the high-risk cases compared to low-risk cases. The
CALL score correlated well with the risk assignment. Most commonly, the low-risk cases
corresponded to the favourable CALL score “Class A group”, and only 2% were unfavourable

“Class C group”. As expected, high-risk cases presented more commonly than low-risk cases
with CALL score “Class C” as well as with lower oxygen saturation. There were 3 cases in the
low-risk category for which there was missing information because their CBC was reported
without a differential count, necessary for the calculation of the CALL score. Since these three
cases had no other high-risk criteria, they were assigned to the low-risk group.
Fever and dyspnoea were more commonly seen in high-risk cases. Three cases in the low-risk
category had missing information because their CBC was reported without a differential
count, necessary for the calculation of the CALL score. Since these three cases had no other
high-risk criteria, they were assigned to the low-risk group.
The presence of dyspnoea and pneumonia are frequently used as criteria to decide on
inpatient management. Forty-eight of these low-risk patients had a chest CT done and 17 of
these had typical findings of ground-glass infiltrates that would traditionally have required
hospitalization. An additional 9 cases had a negative chest CT but complained of dyspnoea.
Another four had dyspnoea without hypoxemia, hence a CT chest was not done. In summary,
30 cases met traditional conditions for admission, yet were managed as outpatients in view of
their low-risk features.

Clinical Outcomes:
None of the 132 low-risk cases developed respiratory failure and none developed any type of
complication that required admission to the hospital during follow up. None of them died.
Four (1.9%) of the 208 patients developed what appeared to be a reinfection. All four were
either asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic at time of first diagnosis. After applying our
criteria, all four were classified as low-risk cases. They had been positive by PCR at time of

first diagnosis but subsequently turned PCR negative several days later to again become
positive at the time they developed new symptoms suggestive of reinfection.
The first case of reinfection was a female in her fifties diagnosed after being exposed to a
patient with COVID-19. She was asymptomatic at time of diagnosis. Her first PCR was
positive but 7 days later it turned negative. At time of diagnosis her serological studies were
negative for IgG and IgM. She remained asymptomatic until 4 months later when she
suddenly developed fever, dyspnoea, cough, anosmia, and myalgia and her PCR then turned
positive. Based on inflammatory markers and CT chest, she met criteria for treatment.
The second reinfected case is a female in her fifties who had been exposed to a co-worker who
had been diagnosed with COVID-19. She was asymptomatic but on day 7 post exposure, her
PCR test was positive. She did not fulfil high-risk criteria, so she was monitored without
therapy. Ten days after the positive PCR test, IgM and IgG antibody tests were both negative.
Two weeks after the first PCR test, it was repeated and became negative. She remained well
until 20 days after the first PCR, when she developed fever, diarrhoea, cough, anosmia, and
myalgia. Her PCR was repeated and was now found to be positive. A confirmatory PCR was
ordered 18 days later and again was positive. Nine days after her second infection, antibody
tests for IgM and IgG both turned positive. This time, based on inflammatory markers, she
met criteria for treatment with methylprednisolone and she was started on therapy according
to protocol. She responded clinically and her symptoms resolved promptly.
The third case of reinfection was a male in his twenties, who developed nasal congestion and a
positive PCR test. Eight days after this PCR, his IgG and IgM antibodies were negative, and a
follow up PCR test converted to negative. He fulfilled criteria for low-risk disease, so he was
observed without therapy. He did well until four months later when he was exposed to several

family members infected with COVID-19 and shortly after, he developed typical symptoms of
COVID-19 consisting of fever, myalgia, anosmia, headache, and diarrhoea. One week later his
PCR turned positive. His IgG and IgM also turned positive 8 days after this last PCR. By the
time we received the PCR result, patient was already recovering from his symptoms, so we
decided not to treat him.
The fourth case of reinfection is a male in his thirties who had a routine PCR ordered at his
workplace. He was essentially asymptomatic except for diarrhoea which he had first noticed
two days earlier. The PCR was positive. Eight days after his first symptom, his IgG and IgM
antibodies were negative. Six weeks after his first symptom, PCR converted to negative. He
fulfilled criteria for low-risk disease, so he was observed without therapy. He remained well
until six months later when he again developed diarrhoea but this time, he also had cough,
fever, myalgia, fatigue, and headache. PCR was positive. On day 8 from his first symptoms of
reinfection, IgG was positive and IgM negative. He did not meet criteria for treatment with
methylprednisolone and thus was monitored without therapy.

Discussion
This manuscript focuses exclusively on 132 low-risk cases. The remaining 76 cases will be the
subject of another report. Our management approach, based essentially on blood-based
inflammatory markers, had an excellent correlation with clinical outcome. Of 208 patients,
132 or 63.5%, fulfilled criteria for low-risk disease that justified monitoring at home without
therapy. None of these low-risk cases developed respiratory failure and none developed any
significant complication or required admission to the hospital. Included in this low-risk group
as defined by our criteria, were 68 cases with comorbidities, 17 with COVID-19 pneumonia,

as well as with other adverse features, including 15 cases older than 65 and 96 with more than
two symptoms at presentation. These characteristics would usually portend an unfavourable
prognosis according to traditional standards, yet all these patients had an excellent outcome.
The management of mild to moderate COVID-19 infections has traditionally been conservative.
Patients with either COVID-19 pneumonia or with dyspnoea, are often admitted to the hospital [1]
Otherwise, treatment has consisted of observation at home provided there is no evidence of
hypoxemia. Applying these traditional criteria to decide on hospitalization, 26 of our 48 low-risk
patients who had a chest CT, would have been managed as inpatients because 17 had typical
findings of ground-glass infiltrates that would traditionally have been hospitalized and an
additional 9 cases had a negative chest CT but complained of dyspnoea. Another 4 cases (20%)
had dyspnoea without hypoxemia and hence a chest CT scan was not done. This adds up to a total
of 30 who traditionally would have been managed as in-patients. By applying our novel criteria to
identify low-risk cases, we were able to safely manage all these 30 patients at home without
separating them from their families. Furthermore, assuming an average of 10 days of
hospitalization per patient, it allowed us to save an average of 300 days of hospitalization. At an
average cost of hospitalization of $3,949 per day, this adds up to a total of $1,184,700 US dollars
saved. In addition, these 30 patients were prevented from being exposed to nosocomial infections.
Dexamethasone has been utilized to treat hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Those who are
ventilator-dependent or who are receiving oxygen have benefitted from that treatment, while those
who are oxygen-independent fail to do so and might even be adversely affected since their
mortality rate tends to be higher when treated with dexamethasone [9]. It is conceivable that some
patients are unnecessarily being treated with this medication, and our proposed method should be
able to identify them.

After the first week of illness, 20% of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 might suddenly
deteriorate and develop respiratory failure [3,6]. This includes those who initially present with
mild symptomatology. Consequently, being able to prospectively segregate those cases who will
have an uncomplicated clinical course from those who are more likely to develop respiratory
failure and who could potentially benefit from pre-emptive immunosuppressive therapy is
advantageous.
Although there were statistically significant differences between low-risk and high-risk cases
regarding their clinical presentation and symptoms (Table 1), there was not a single factor or
factors in their clinical presentation that could reliably be used to classify them into either the
low-risk or high-risk groups. The frequency of symptoms would intuitively be expected to be
less in the low-risk cases. However, contrary to our expectations, the majority (73%) of lowrisk cases presented with two or more symptoms at diagnosis, indicating that they cannot be
identified based on symptomatology alone. The CALL Score is an exceptionally useful
method. It assigns a risk score which can be used to determine the probability of a given
patient to progress to respiratory failure. It is based on quite simple and straightforward
clinical features. Nonetheless, neither the CALL score nor any other system that we are aware
of, was able to identify the low-risk cases detected by our novel criteria.
It is interesting that of the four cases that were possibly reinfected, all four presented with
mild disease at the time of diagnosis. It is well known that patients with mild COVID-19
infections produce little or no antibodies [16] so it should not be surprising that all our four
cases with possible reinfection had mild or no symptomatology at the time of initial diagnosis.
Our results suggest that by applying our novel criteria, low-risk cases can be reliably
monitored at home without treatment, rather than immediately embarking on admission to a

hospital or with outpatient treatment. Aside from the positive financial and psychological
aspects of home-based management, the ability to identify low-risk cases at diagnosis has
several other advantages, including the possibility of circumventing the use of expensive or
potentially toxic agents.
Although the data generated by this prospective trial appear convincing, it is important to keep
in mind that this is a pilot study and confirmation of these findings in another cohort or in an
independent study would be highly desirable.
