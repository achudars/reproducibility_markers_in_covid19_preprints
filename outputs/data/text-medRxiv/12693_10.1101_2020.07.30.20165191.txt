Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), with the fatality rate in elder (60 years old or more) being
much higher than young (60 years old or less) patients, was declared a pandemic by the World
Health Organization on March 11, 2020. Taking into account this age-dependent fatality rate,
a mathematical model considering young and elder subpopulations was formulated based on
the natural history of covid-19 to study the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. This model
can be applied to study the epidemiological scenario resulting from the adoption of isolation or
lockdown in many countries to control the rapid propagation of covid-19. We chose as examples
the isolation adopted in São Paulo State (Brazil) in the early phase but not at the beginning
of the epidemic, and the lockdown implemented in Spain when the number of severe covid-19
cases was increasing rapidly. Based on the data collected from São Paulo State and Spain, the
model parameters were evaluated and we obtained higher estimation for the basic reproduction
number R0 (9.24 for São Paulo State, and 8 for Spain) compared to the currently accepted
estimation of R0 around 3. The model allowed to explain the flattening of the epidemic curves
by isolation in São Paulo State and lockdown in Spain when associated with the protective
measures (face mask and social distancing) adopted by the population. However, a simplified
mathematical model providing lower estimation for R0 did not explain the flattening of the
epidemic curves. The implementation of the isolation in São Paulo State before the rapidly
increasing phase of the epidemic enlarged the period of the first wave of the epidemic and
delayed its peak, which are the desirable results of isolation to avoid the overloading in the
health care system.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is a strain of the RNA-based SARS-CoV-1. This SARS-CoV-2 (new
coronavirus) can be transmitted by droplets that escape the lungs through coughing or sneezing
and infect humans (direct transmission), or they are deposited in surfaces and infect humans
when in contact with this contaminated surface (indirect transmission) [1] [2]. These routes
of transmission resulted in a rapid spreading of this virus, and the World Health Organization
(WHO) declared covid-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
This virus enters into susceptible persons through the nose, mouth, or eyes, and infects cells
in the respiratory tract. Covid-19 in mild form presents fever, dry cough, chills, malaise, muscle
pain, and sore throat, in moderate form presents fever, respiratory symptoms, and radiographic
characteristics, and in severe form manifests dyspnea, low oxygen saturation, and may evolve

to respiratory failure, and multiple organ failure. In general, the fatality rate in elder patients
(60 years or more) is much higher than those with 60 years or less [3].
Currently, there is not a vaccine, neither an effective treatment. Hence, at the beginning
of covid-19 outbreaks, isolation was the main way of controlling the dissemination of the new
coronavirus in a population [4]. However, there is evidence that individual (protection of mouth
and nose using face mask and protection of eyes, and washing hands with alcohol and gel) and
collective (social distancing) protective measures diminish the transmission of covid-19 [5]. The
decrease in the incidence of covid-19 by isolation, known as flattening the curve of an epidemic,
can be quantified by mathematical modeling.
Initially, computational models (especially, agent-based model) to describe influenza epidemics were adapted and applied to estimate the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. Koo et al. [6]
used such a model to study the propagation of the new coronavirus in Singapore, assuming
that the basic reproduction number, denoted by R0 , was around 2. The same approach was
done by Ferguson et al. [7] to investigate the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (isolation of susceptible persons) named mitigation and suppression. Briefly, mitigation reduces
the basic reproduction number R0 , but not lower than one, while suppression reduces the basic
reproduction number lower than one. They simulated their model assuming R0 around 2.5,
and predicted the numbers of severe cases and deaths due to covid-19 without interventions
and compared them with those numbers when isolation (mitigation or suppression) was implemented in a population. However, instead of assuming a certain value for R0 , Li et al. [8]
performed a stochastic simulation of SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model incorporating the rapid dissemination of new coronavirus due to undocumented infections, and
estimated the effective reproduction number Ref around 2.4. The basic and effective reproduction numbers R0 and Ref must be retrieved from the model, and they are defined in Materials
and Methods.
The herd immunity jumps down Ref by the vaccination [9], as the isolation of the susceptible persons (non-pharmaceutical interventions [7]) jumps it down. Hence, we name as “herd
protection” the protection conferred to susceptible persons by isolation, and the adoption of individual (face mask and constant hygiene by washing hands with alcohol and gel) and collective
(social distancing) protective measures by the non-isolated (circulating) population.
Mathematical models based on a well documented natural history of the disease allow us to
understand the progression of viral infection and provide mathematical expression to estimate
R0 , which is related to the magnitude of efforts to eradicate an infection [9]. When a simple
SIR model is considered to describe the covid-19 epidemic, it is expected to estimate R0 around
3. Fortunately, the knowledge about the natural history of covid-19 is being improved every

day as the epidemic evolves, and, as a consequence, mathematical modeling can be benefited
by incorporating novel aspects of this epidemic. In [10], a mathematical model encompassing
two subpopulations based on the different fatality rates in young (60 years old or less) and
elder (60 years old or more) subpopulations was developed aiming to study the impacts of
the isolation and further release on the epidemic of covid-19. That model was applied to São
Paulo State (Brazil) to describe the epidemiological scenario considering intermittent pulses in
isolation and release. We improved that model allowing the transmission of the infection by
persons presenting mild covid-19 symptoms, and incorporating the protective measures that
reduce the transmission of the virus.
The model proposed here is applied to evaluate the impacts of herd protection on the epidemics in São Paulo State and Spain. The widespread of covid-19 in Spain led to the adoption of
lockdown, which is an extreme measure to control the quick increase of an epidemic. São Paulo
State, however, implemented the isolation in the population to avoid critical epidemiological
scenarios occurring in Spain and Italy. Based on the data collection of severe covid-19 cases
and deaths from São Paulo State and Spain, we estimate the model parameters, the proportion
of the population in isolation/lockdown, and the reduction in the transmission rates by the
adoption of the protective measures. The relatively early adoption of the isolation in São Paulo
State resulted in the enlarging of the period of the first wave of the epidemic and delaying its
peak. Based on the description of the epidemic under herd protection, the model can provide
epidemiological scenarios of the strategies of release that can help guide public health policies
by decision-makers.

Results and Discussion
In Materials and Methods, we present a mathematical model to describe the transmission of
SARS-CoV-2, the description of collections of data from São Paulo State and Spain, and the
values assigned to the model parameters. This model is applied to describe the epidemiological
scenarios of isolation in São Paulo State and lockdown in Spain, and we obtained the basic
reproduction number R0 and also the effective reproduction number Ref .
From Materials and Methods, we observed three distinct trends in the accumulated covid-19
data. These three periods in São Paulo State describe the epidemic occurring naturally, with
isolation, and isolation with protective measures (herd protection). In Spain, the three periods
represent the natural epidemic, the epidemic during the transition from natural to lockdown,
and the epidemic occurring in lockdown. Taking into account these three trends shown by the
covid-19 data, we evaluate the model parameters βy , βo , k, ε, and ω. However, the additional

mortality rates αy and αo are evaluated considering all three periods. We then assess the effects
of herd protection (non-pharmaceutical interventions) on the flattening of epidemic curves in
São Paulo State and Spain.
The first period of data corresponding to the natural epidemics of covid-19 in São Paulo State
and Spain is a unique opportunity to estimate the basic reproduction number R0 . Based on this
estimation, all subsequent interventions applied to control epidemics can be explained. Indeed,
the magnitude of the jump down in the effective reproduction number Ref is proportional to the
control intervention. The similitude between mass vaccination and isolation is the proportion
of susceptible individuals being protected from infection, which results in the jump down of
Ref .

Covid-19 in São Paulo State – Isolation
São Paulo State has 44.6 million inhabitants with 15.3% of elder population (60 years old or
more) [11], and the demographic density is 177/km2 [12]. The first confirmed case of covid19 occurred on February 26, the first death due to covid-19 on March 16, and on March 24,
São Paulo State implemented the isolation of people in non-essential activities. The lockdown
implemented in Spain and Italy due to their critical epidemiological scenarios led to the adoption
of isolation in São Paulo State. We evaluate the model parameters using daily collected data
(see Figures 17 and 18), and describe the epidemiological scenario with isolation.
Parameters evaluation
Using data collected in São Paulo State from February 26 to May 7, we evaluate the transmission rates (βy and βo ), the proportion in the isolated population (k), reduction in the
transmission rates due to the protective measures adopted by the circulating population (ε),
and the additional mortality rates (αy and αo ).
Natural epidemic – Evaluating the transmission rates The effects of isolation implemented on March 24 are expected to appear later on the daily registered cases of severe covid-19
(the sum of incubation and pre-diseased infection periods (see Table 2) is 9.8 days). Hence, the
data from February 26 to April 3 of severe covid-19 cases portray the natural epidemic, that
is, the transmission of infection is occurring without any kind of intervention. This epidemiological scenario fulfills the definition of the basic reproduction number R0 (entire population is
susceptible in the absence of constraints), allowing its estimation.
We evaluate the transmission rates taking into account the confirmed cases from February
26 (t1 ) to April 3 (t38 ), and using equation (33). The evaluated values are βy = 0.78 and

βo = 0.90 (both in days−1 ), where ψ = 1.15, resulting in the basic reproduction number
R0 = 9.24 (partials R0y = 7.73 and R0o = 1.51), according to equation (30).
Figure 1(a) shows the estimated curve of Ω and the observed data, plus two curves with
lower transmission rates: βy = 0.59 and βo = 0.68 (both in days−1 ), with R0 = 6.99 (partials
R0y = 5.84 and R0o = 1.16); and βy = 0.43 and βo = 0.50 (both in days−1 ), with R0 = 5.09
(partials R0y = 4.26 and R0o = 0.84). Figure 1(b) shows the extended curves of Ω, from
equation (14), which approach asymptotes (or plateaus) indicating the end of the first wave of
the epidemic. For R0 = 9.24, 6.99, and 5.09, the curves Ω reach values with little difference
on September 13, respectively, 946, 400, 945, 700, and 941, 500. For R0 = 9.24, the curves for
young (Ωy ) and elder (Ωo ) persons approach on September 13 values, respectively, 605, 300 and
341, 100.

Figure 1: The estimated curve of the accumulated number of severe covid-19 cases Ω in natural
epidemic and observed data in São Paulo State, plus two curves with lower transmission rates:
βy = 0.59 and βo = 0.68 (days−1 ), with R0 = 6.99, and βy = 0.43 and βo = 0.50 (days−1 ), with
R0 = 5.09 (a), and extended curves of Ω (b).
We stress the fact that, if the observed data are fitted without caution about interventions,
that is, using all data indistinctly, someone could estimate the basic reproduction number to
be R0 = 5.09 or less (notice that near the horizontal axis of Figure 1(b), the observed data do
not approach the curve of R0 = 5.09, rather lower R0 ).
It is accepted that SARS-CoV-2 is an airborne infection [2]. For instance, for the rubella
infection, using seroprevalence data [13] and dealing with the SEIR model in the steady-state,
the estimation was R0 = 6.71 [14]. That estimation was done before the mass vaccination
against rubella infection, which was the reason to assume that the estimation was the basic
reproduction number. However, the rubella virus was circulating probably not in a steady6

state, then the estimation would not be R0 , but the effective reproduction number Ref , given
by equation (29), and the actual value of R0 must be higher than 6.71. Moreover, Caieiras City
in São Paulo State had 30, 000 inhabitants with a demographic density of 264/km2 in 1990,
which indicates that R0 = 6.71 is under-estimation for rubella transmission in São Paulo State.
As we pointed out in Materials and Methods, we have only two moments during the epidemic
when R0 can be estimated from data: At the beginning without any kind of constraints (during
the natural epidemic), and when the steady-state is reached, which in general occurs after a
long time [14].
In Discussion, we present more arguments to demonstrate that the currently accepted lower
R0 (around 3) does not explain the covid-19 epidemic.
Epidemic with isolation – Evaluating the proportion of the population in isolation
Isolation was introduced on March 24 (t1 ), and we evaluate the proportion in isolation taking
into account the confirmed cases of covid-19 until April 12 (t20 ), and using equation (33).
To evaluate the proportion of the population in isolation, we fix the transmission rates
βy = 0.78 and βo = 0.90 (both in days−1 ), and vary k = 0, 0.4, 0.53, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8, where
kmean = 0.53 is the average proportion of persons in isolation from March 24 to May 3 (see
Figure 18). We observe that k = 0.4 and 0.6 fit part of the observed data, while k = 0.7 does
not. Hence, we chose k = kmean = 0.53 as the value that explains the isolation in São Paulo
State. Figure 2 shows the curves of Ω for different proportions in isolation in São Paulo State
and the observed data (a), and the extended curves of Ω (b).

From Figure 2(b), the curves Ω approach plateau, and the values on September 13 for k = 0,
0.4, 0.53, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 are, respectively, 964, 600, 567, 600 (60%), 444, 000 (47%), 372, 500
(40%), 268, 200 (28%), and 146, 000 (15%). The percentage between parentheses is the ratio
Ω(k)/Ω(0). For k = kmean , the values for Ωy and Ωo are, respectively, 283, 600 and 160, 400.
As we have pointed out in the description of the data (Materials and Methods), the observed
proportion in isolation delayed by approximately 9 days indeed affected the daily incidence of
covid-19. Moreover, the chosen proportion kmean is the average proportion of isolation in São
Paulo State. The number of accumulated cases Ω decreases as k increases, showing that the
isolation of the population decreases the transmission of covid-19, flattening the epidemic curve.
This decrease can be assessed also by equation (31), which is the reduction in the effective
reproduction number by isolation Rr .
When isolation is implemented during the epidemic, those who are harboring the virus can
be found in the isolated population. At the time of the beginning of isolation in São Paulo
State on March 24, we have

with Q1y = Q1o = Q3y = Q3o = 0 and I = 10, 032. When 53% (k = 0.53) of the infectious
persons in each class is transferred to the isolated classes, the total number of isolated persons
harboring virus 43, 490 can trigger a new epidemic in the population in isolation. However,
if the transmission rate is low in the isolated population [15], the number of severe covid-19
cases is around 1% compared with the peak 67, 140 shown below. Hence, we assume that
SARS-CoV-2 is not transmitting in the isolated population, and we do not evaluate ω.
Epidemic with isolation and protective measures – Evaluating the reduction in the
transmission rates On April 13, 20 days after the beginning of isolation, we observe the
first point leaving completely the curve. This new trend can not be explained by an increased
proportion of isolation (see Figure 18). To take into account this new tendency of data, in [10]
we hypothesized that the using of face mask (protection of mouth and nose), protection of eyes,
constant hygiene (washing hands with alcohol and gel) and social distancing may decrease the
transmission of infection [5] [16]. Differently to isolation, these protective measures reduce the
transmission rates as can be seen in equation (3).
We consider that on April 4, 9 days before the observed points leaving consistently the

estimated curve of the epidemic with isolation, the protective measures were adopted by population, which reduced the transmission rates from βy and βo to βy0 = εβy and βo0 = εβo . We
fix the transmission rates βy = 0.78 and βo = 0.90 (both in days−1 ), and the proportion in
isolation k = 0.53 to evaluate the protective factor ε taking into account data from April 4 (t1 )
to May 7 (t34 ), and using equation (33).
We vary ε = 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, and 0.4, and the value ε = 0.5 is chosen to represent the
protective measures adopted in São Paulo State. Figure 3 shows the curves of Ω for ε = 1,
0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, and 0.4 plus natural epidemic (k = 0) and the observed data (a), and the
extended curves of Ω for ε = 1, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, and 0.4 (b). The curves Ω approach plateau,
and on November 2, the values for ε = 1, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5 and 0.4 are, respectively, 444, 000,

as intervention.

0.7, 0.6, 0.5 and 0.4 (b).
The number of accumulated cases Ω decreases as ε decreases (1−ε is the effectiveness of protective measures), showing that the protective measures adopted by the population decreased
the transmission of covid-19, flattening the epidemic curve. This decrease can be assessed also
by equation (32), which is the reduction in the effective reproduction number by protective
measures Rp .

Evaluating the additional mortality rates We estimate the additional mortality rates
αy = Γα0 and αo taking into account confirmed deaths from March 16 (t1 ) to May 20 (t66 ),
and using equation (34). We fix the previously estimated transmission rates βy = 0.78 and
βo = 0.90 (both in days−1 ), the proportion in isolated population k = 0.53, and the protective
factor ε = 0.5, to evaluate α0 . As we pointed out in Materials and Methods, we fix ∆ = 15 days
and let Γ = 0.26 in São Paulo State (74% of deaths are occurring in elder persons with severe
covid-19 [17]). The evaluated additional mortality rates are αy = 0.00185 and αo = 0.0071
(both in days−1 ).
Figure 4 shows the estimated curve of Π, from equation (16), and the observed death data
(a), and the extended curves of the number of covid-19 deaths for young Πy , elder Πo , and
total Π = Πy + Πo persons (b). The estimated curves Πy , Πo , and Π reach plateaus, and on
November 2 the values are, respectively, 5, 280 (2.2%), 18, 500 (13%), and 23, 780 (6.0%). The
percentage between parentheses is the severe covid-19 case fatality rate Π/Ω, Ω being given in
Figure 3(b).

Epidemiological scenario with isolation
We present the epidemiological scenario with isolation using all previously estimated parameters: The transmission rates βy = 0.78 and βo = 0.90 (both in days−1 ), giving R0 = 9.24;
the additional mortality rates αy = 0.00185 and αo = 0.0071 (both in days−1 ); the proportion
in isolation of susceptible persons k = 0.53; and the protective factor ε = 0.5 reducing the
transmission rates to βy0 = 0.39 and βo0 = 0.45 (both in days−1 ), giving R0 = 4.62.
In Figure 5, we show the effects of interventions on the dynamics of the new coronavirus.
As interventions are added (isolation followed by protective measures), we observe decreasing
in the peaks of severe covid-19 D2 , which move to the right. Figure 5(a) shows the curves of the
natural epidemic, epidemic considering only isolation, and epidemic occurring with isolation and
protective measures. In Figure 5(b), we show the number of immune persons I corresponding
to the three cases shown in Figure 5(a). The curves have sigmoid-shape.

22, and 21. Considering isolation and protective measures (k = 0, 53 and ε = 0.5), the peaks
for young, elder and total persons are, respectively, 36, 010 (16%), 31, 160 (19%), and 67, 140

Due to isolation and protective measures, so many people remain as susceptible. In Figure
6 we show circulating susceptible persons Sy , So and S = Sy + So (a), and circulating plus
isolated susceptible persons Sytot , Sotot and S tot = Sytot + Sotot (b), using equation (12). Remember
that Sytot differs from Sy just after the introduction of isolation (March 24).

At the end of the first wave of the epidemic, the numbers of susceptible persons Sy , So , and
S = Sy + So without any interventions (k = 0 and ε = 1) are, respectively, 37, 000, 210 and
37, 210, and the numbers of susceptible persons with interventions (isolation and protective measures) are 8.15 million (22, 027%), 1.3 million (619, 047%), and 9.5 million (25, 531%), for young,
elder and total persons, respectively. For Sytot , Sotot and S tot = Sytot + Sotot , we have, respectively,
28 million (75, 676%), 4.9 million (2, 333, 333%), and 33 million (88, 686%). The percentage
between parentheses is the ratio between with and without interventions S(k, ε)/S(0, 1). Observe that, on June 15, the sum of the susceptible persons in circulation and those in isolation
is such that there are more than 750-time and 23, 000-time, respectively, susceptible young and
elder persons in comparison with epidemic without any intervention. Hence, if all persons are
released without planning, the second wave will be intense, infecting much more elder persons.

SARS-CoV-2 must be continued for a long time to avoid the rebounding of the epidemic or a
second wave.
It is important to estimate the basic reproduction number, which portrays the beginning and
ending phases of an epidemic [18]. During the epidemic, however, the effective reproduction
number determines the intensity of transmission of the infection. We use the approximate
effective reproduction number Ref , given by equation (29), to follow the trend of the epidemic,
remembering that Ref > 1 implies epidemic in expansion, while Ref < 1, in contraction. Figure
7 illustrates the effective reproduction number Ref and D2 during the epidemic, with (a) and
without (b) intervention. To be fitted together in the same frame with Ref , the curve of D2 is
divided by 7, 000 (a) and 40, 000 (b). The curve of Ref follows the shape of susceptible persons
as shown in Figure 6, as expected. At the peak of the epidemic, the effective reproduction
number is lower than one, hence we have Ref = 1 occurring on June 14 (a) and April 6 (b).

Figure 7: The effective reproduction number Ref for epidemic with isolation and protective
measures (a), and natural epidemic (b) in São Paulo State. The number of severe covid-19
cases D2 must be multiplied by 7, 000 (a) and 40, 000 (b).
As the epidemic evolves, the effective reproduction number varies as shown in Figure 7(a).
At the beginning of the epidemic, on February 26, we have Ref = R0 = 9.24, on March 24,
a jump down occurred to Ref = 4.35 due to the isolation, and a new jump down occurs to
Ref = 2.15 on April 4 when protective measures were adopted. On June 15, when the release
will begin, we have Ref = 0.98, but in the ascending phase of the epidemic. The knowledge of
Ref could help public health authorities to plan the strategies of release.
We used the accumulated data shown in Figure 17(b) and Ω given by equation (14) to
estimate the transmission rates βy and βo , the proportion in isolation k, and the protective
factor ε. The curve labeled ε = 0.5 in Figure 3(b) is the estimated curve Ω, from which the

Figure 8(b), we show the initial part of the estimated curve Ω with observed data Ωob , the

On June 12, the peak of the daily cases of covid-19 predicted by the model reaches 5, 286.
On June 23, the peak of D2 estimated by the model is 67, 140, and the number of accumulated
cases Ω is 243, 000, which is 362% of the peak of D2 , and 63% of cases when the first wave of
epidemic ends (386, 700). These values provided by the model correspond to the epidemic with
isolation without release.

Covid-19 in Spain – Lockdown
Spain has 47.4 million inhabitants [19] with 25.8% of elder population [20], and the demographic
density is 92.3/km2 [12]. In Spain, the first confirmed case of covid-19 occurred on January 31,
2020. However, the daily registering of covid-19 began on February 20 (3 cases), the first 28
deaths were registered on March 8 when reached 1, 535 cases, and on March 16 lockdown was
implemented. We evaluate the model parameters using daily collected data (see Figure 19) and
describe the epidemiological scenario with the lockdown.

Parameters evaluation
Using data from January 31 to May 20 collected from Spain, we evaluate the transmission (βy
and βo ) rates, the proportion in the isolated populations (k), reduction in the transmission rates
by protective measures adopted by population (ε) and social distancing (ω), and the additional
mortality rates (αy and αo )
Natural epidemic – Evaluating the transmission rates We evaluate the transmission
rates during the natural epidemic taking into account the confirmed cases from January 31 (t1 )
to March 21 (t51 ), and using equation (33). The evaluated values are βy = 0.67 and βo = 0.74
(both in days−1 ), where ψ = 1.1, resulting in the basic reproduction number R0 = 8.0 (partials
R0y = 5.81 and R0o = 2.19), according to equation (30). Figure 9 shows the estimated curve
of Ω and the observed data (a), and the extended curves for young Ωy , elder Ωo , and total
Ω persons (b). On June 30, the accumulated cases for young Ωy elder Ωo persons approach
plateaus, assuming, respectively, 564, 000, 611, 000, and 1, 175, 000.

The estimated basic reproduction number R0 in Spain is lower than São Paulo State. The
inhabitants in Spain is 6% higher, but the demographic density is 48% lower than those in São
Paulo State. This decrease by almost half in the demographic density may explain the 13%
lower in the basic reproduction number. The elder population in Spain is 40% higher than São
Paulo State, and the evaluated ψ is 4.4% lower than that estimated for São Paulo State.

Transition epidemic – Evaluating the reduction in the transmission rates in circulating and locked-down populations On March 16, the lockdown was implemented in
Spain. But the data described in Materials and Methods showed a period (from March 22 to
28) of transition from natural epidemic to lockdown effectively reducing the epidemic. Hence,
we must consider covid-19 transmission in circulating and locked-down populations.
Initially, following the procedure adopted in São Paulo State, we vary the proportion of
the population in lockdown, k = 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9, and evaluate the epidemic in the
circulating population. Notice that the epidemic occurring in the circulating population must
be lower than the observed cases of severe covid-19 if the infection is also occurring in the lockeddown population. Figure 10(a) below shows that, for the proportions 0.8 and 0.9 in lockdown,
the occurrence of infections in the circulating population is lower than the observed data in
Spain, but k = 0.7 shows the number of cases provided by the model following sigmoid-shape
and increasing beyond the observed data.
Hence, we chose k = 0.9 to represent the lockdown in Spain, instead of 80%, and evaluate the
epidemic in circulating and locked-down populations by fixing the transmission rates βy = 0.67
and βo = 0.74 (both in days−1 ). We consider that during the transition of the epidemic, the
populations in circulation (k = 0.1) and lockdown (k = 0.9) did not adopt any protective
measure (ε = 1), but the population in lockdown has restricted contact (ω > 1). Hence, taking
into account the confirmed cases from March 22 (t1 ) to 28 (t7 ) and using equation (33), the
evaluated decreasing factor in the population in lockdown is ω = 1.5, resulting in βy0 = 0.45
and βo0 = 0.49 (both in days−1 ). Figure 10 shows the curves of Ω for k = 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and
0.9 and the observed data (a), and the curves of Ω for the natural epidemic and epidemic in
the transition phase (b).
When a lockdown is implemented during the epidemic, those who are harboring the virus
can be found in the isolated population. At the time of the beginning of lockdown on March
16, we have

harboring virus 134, 240 can trigger a new epidemic in the population in lockdown with an
elevated number of susceptible persons. When a new epidemic begins in the population in

Epidemic with lockdown – Evaluating the proportion of the population in lockdown
and reduction in the transmission rates Lockdown was implemented on March 16, but
the actual effects began after the transition period. We fix the previously estimated transmission
rates βy = 0.67 and βo = 0.74 (both in days−1 ) in the natural epidemic, and the reduction in
the transmission rate ω = 1.5 in the population in lockdown (k = 0.9) in the epidemic in the
transition period. The parameters ε and ω corresponding to the third period of the epidemic
are evaluated taking into account the confirmed cases from March 24 (t1 ) to May 20 (t57 ), and
using equation (33).
We evaluate the changes in the protective measures (ε) in the circulating population and
the decrease in the transmission rates (ω) in the locked-down population. In the circulating
population, the evaluated protective factor is ε = 0.5, resulting in βy0 = 0.34 and βo0 = 0.391
(both in days−1 ), while in the population in lockdown, the evaluated decreasing factor is ω =
11.5, resulting in βy0 = 0.059 and βo0 = 0.068 (both in days−1 ). Figure 11 shows the estimated
curves of Ω and the observed data (a), and the illustration of the curves of D2 occurring in
circulating (continuous) and locked-down (dashed) populations (b). The estimated curves Ωy ,
Ωo , and Ω = Ωy +Ωo approach plateaus, and on October 7, the values are, respectively, 147, 100,
173, 100, and 320, 200.
For k = 0.8, better evaluations in ε and ω were obtained considering the effectiveness
of lockdown appearing on March 25, which is exactly 9 days after March 16. The estimated

protective factor in the circulating population is ε = 0.45, resulting in βy0 = 0.306 and βo0 = 0.352
(both in days−1 ), and for the locked-down population, the decreasing factor in the transmission
rates is ω = 12.3, resulting in βy0 = 0.055 and βo0 = 0.064 (both in days−1 ).
Evaluating the additional mortality rates Taking into account confirmed deaths from
March 8 (t1 ) to May 20 (t73 ) and using equation (34), we evaluate the additional mortality rates
αy = Γα0 and αo . To evaluate the mortality rates, we fix the previously estimated transmission
rates βy = 0.67 and βo = 0.74 (both in days−1 ) in the natural epidemic, the reduction in the
transmission rate ω = 1.5 in the population in lockdown (k = 0.9) in the epidemic during
the transition, and when lockdown effectively affects epidemic, protection factor ε = 0.5 in
the population in circulation and reduction in the transmission ω = 11.5 in the locked-down
population.
We consider ∆ = 15 days and let Γ = 0.05 in Spain (95.5% of deaths are occurring in
the elder persons with severe covid-19 [21]), and the evaluated additional mortality rates are
αy = 0.00273 and αo = 0.0105 (both in days−1 ). Figure 12 shows the estimated curve of Π,
from equation (16), and the observed death data (a), and the extended curves of the number

Epidemiological scenario with lockdown
In Figure 13, we show the effects of interventions on the dynamic of the new coronavirus.
During the three phases of the epidemic (natural, in transition, and effective lockdown), we
observe decreasing in the peaks of severe covid-19 D2 , which move to the right. Figure 13(a)
shows the curves representing the natural epidemic, epidemic in transition, and epidemic in
effective lockdown. In Figure 13(b), we show the number of immune persons I corresponding
to the three cases shown in Figure 13(a). The curves follow a sigmoid-shape.
In the natural epidemic, the numbers of immune persons Iy , Io , and I increase from zero to,
respectively, 35 million, 12 million, and 47 million on June 15. In the epidemic with lockdown,
the numbers are, on June 15, 8.37 million (24%), 3.09 million (25.75%), and 11.46 million
(24.38%). Figure 13(b) shows only I with and without interventions. The percentage between
parentheses is the ratio between with and without interventions I(k, ε)/I(0, 1) on June 15.
Let us compare the peak of D2 . The peaks for young, elder and total persons in the

For 90% of the population in lockdown in Spain, the basic reproduction number R0 = 8.0
decreased to Ref = 0.771 and Ref = 5.14, respectively, in circulating and locked-down populations on March 16. During a short period of transition from natural to lockdown epidemic,
the high effective reproduction number in the 90% in the lockdown resulted in a high number
of infections (see Figure 11(b), practically all cases are originated in locked-down population),
and the daily covid-19 cases increased, reaching the peak on March 27. On March 24, when
the effectiveness of lockdown is observed, we observe another reduction in the effective reproduction number to Ref = 0.382 and Ref = 0.59, respectively, in circulating and locked-down
populations. Although Ref < 1, the number of new cases of covid-19 does not decrease quickly
due to the high number of susceptible individuals. Hence, the example of Spain demonstrated
that it is not enough to decrease the effective reproduction number below unity if the number
of susceptible individuals is higher. On May 4 (phase 0 of release in Spain [22]) and June 8
(phase 3 of release) the effective reproduction number assumes, respectively, 0.53 and 0.51.

peak of observed daily cases. Hence, 90% of the population in lockdown explains better the
daily observed data in Spain than 80%.

Comparing covid-19 epidemics in São Paulo State and Spain
The widespread epidemic of covid-19 led Spain to implement lockdown, and the number of
asymptomatic persons was higher as shown in equation (2), while São Paulo State isolated
population earlier, and the number of asymptomatic persons was not so high as shown in
equation (1). In the population in lockdown in Spain, the numbers of infectious and susceptible
persons are, respectively, 3 and 1.8-time more than those found in the isolation in São Paulo
State. The number of new cases of infection is proportional to the product of the numbers
of infectious and susceptible persons, hence the population in lockdown in Spain has 5.4-time
more risk of an outbreak of the epidemic than in São Paulo State. For this reason, we neglected
covid-19 transmission in the isolated population in São Paulo State, however, to explain the
observed data in Spain, we allowed a low transmission (through restricted contact occurring
in the household and/or neighborhood) in the locked-down population. Indeed, the model
provided that almost all cases of severe covid-19 cases were originated from the locked-down
population in Spain, although Ref = 0.59. However, the epidemic of covid-19 in São Paulo
State occurred in the circulating population, with the effective reproduction number jumping
down to Ref = 4.35 when the isolation in 53% of the population was implemented on March
24, which decreased more to Ref = 2.1 with the adoption of protective measures on April 4.
According to the definition in [7], São Paulo State is an example of mitigation, while Spain,
suppression.
The elapsed time from the first case to the adoption of lockdown in Spain was 45 days,
while isolation in São Paulo State, 27 days, a difference of 18 days. The value of Ref , from
the beginning of the epidemic to the implementation of lockdown/isolation, decreased by 0.29
(with 8, 122 cases of severe covid-19) and 0.02 (with 397 cases), respectively, in Spain and São
Paulo State. Moreover, the peak of severe covid-19 cases occurred on April 6 (66 days after
the beginning of the epidemic) with 80, 750 cases in Spain, which is 17% of 474, 900 cases in
the natural epidemic. In São Paulo State, the estimated peak of severe cases will occur on
June 23 (118 days after the beginning of the epidemic) with 67, 140 cases (83% of Spain),
which is 18% of 386, 400 cases in the natural epidemic. The 52 days gained by São Paulo State
were extremely valuable to avoid the overloading in the health system, sowing that the early
adoption of isolation or lockdown is essential to control the epidemic.
The estimated R0 for covid-19 in Spain is 87% of that in São Paulo State, although the peak

and the accumulated cases at the end of the first wave of the natural epidemic are, respectively,
123% and 124% of those in São Paulo State. This finding can be understood by analyzing the
partial reproduction numbers R0y for young and R0o for elder subpopulations. We estimated,
for São Paulo State, R0y = 7.73 and R0o = 1.51. From the model, the fractions of young and
elder susceptible persons reach, in the long-term epidemic, respectively, sis∗
= 1/R0y = 0.13
y
is∗
and so = 1/R0o = 0.66. However, when young and elder subpopulations are not separated,
but are interacting in the circulating population, we obtained s∗y = 0.1034 and s∗o = 0.0017.
∗
Notice that the difference sis∗
j − sj , j = y, o, is the additional proportion of susceptible persons
infected due to interaction, being 2.7% for young and 66% for elder persons, showing that
elder persons are 24-time more risk than young persons when they interact. For Spain, we
estimated R0y = 5.81 and R0o = 2.19, which are 75% and 145% of those estimated in São
Paulo State. For the number of accumulated cases, Spain has 93% (young) and 179% (elder)
of severe covid-19 cases of those in São Paulo State. For the number of cases at the peak of
the epidemic, Spain has 90% (young) and 168% (elder) of those in São Paulo State. Finally,
in Spain, the majority of infections were occurring in 90% of the locked-down population with
25.8% of the elder population, while in São Paulo State, the infections were occurring in 47%
of the isolated population with 15.3% of the elder population. Therefore, the higher number of
cases with lower R0 in Spain can be explained epidemiologically by lockdown, which allowed a
higher number of elder persons in close contact with young persons, increasing the infection in
the vulnerable elder subpopulation.
Both estimated curve of Ω and the observed data in Spain after the implementation of
lockdown follow the shape of Ref lower than 1 (Figures 11(a) and 19(b)), while the curve
of Ω and observed data after the adoption of isolation in São Paulo follow the shape of Ref
higher than 1 (Figures 3(a) and 17(b)). Briefly, during the epidemic, the shape of the curve of
accumulated cases of severe covid-19 Ω is sigmoid, that is, presents a quick increase in the first
phase (Ref > 1, upward concavity) followed by a slow increase (Ref < 1, downward concavity).
At the end of the first wave of the epidemic, the accumulated severe covid-19 cases in Spain is
320, 200, and in São Paulo State, 386, 600 (121% of the cases in Spain), although the peak of
the epidemic in Spain is higher. As a consequence, the lockdown implemented in Spain reduced
the number of covid-19 cases (27% of the natural epidemic) more than isolation adopted in São
Paulo State (41% of the natural epidemic), which impacts on the number of immune persons.
The number of young and elder immune persons are, respectively, 15.14 million (99%) and 2.82
million (97%) for São Paulo State, and 9.13 million (99%) and 3.41 million (98%) for Spain.
The percentage between parentheses is the ratio of the numbers of immune persons and new
cases of covid-19 I/Φ. In São Paulo State, the total number of immune persons at the end of

the first wave of the epidemic is 40% of the population, while in Spain, 26.5%. On June 15,
the proportion of the immune person in São Paulo State is 16.7%. In Spain, on May 4, June
8 and 15, the proportions of the immune persons are, respectively, 18%, 23.5%, and 24.4%,
showing that on June 8 Spain is close to the end of the first wave of the epidemic. However,
if lockdown/isolation and protective measures are relaxed or abandoned, Spain and São Paulo
State will be under higher risk to trigger a second wave of the epidemic due to a high number
of susceptible persons and a low number of immune persons at the end of the first wave of the
epidemic.
At the end of the first wave of the epidemic, the estimated number of deaths in Spain is
32, 150 (10% of total cases), while in São Paulo State is 23, 780 (6% of total cases), which is
74% of the total deaths in Spain. The severity case fatality rate in São Paulo State is 3.7-time
higher in young, and 1.4-time lower in elder in comparison with Spain. Both severity case and
infection fatality rates for Spain for young and elder persons are, respectively, around 30% and
138% of the rates obtained for São Paulo State. These rates in elder subpopulation could be
explained by the life expectancy (in São Paulo State is 78.4 years and in Spain, 83.4 years),
because 59.7% of deaths occurred in elder persons with 80 years old or more in Spain [20].
However, a higher proportion of uncontrolled comorbidity in the young subpopulation in São
Paulo State could increase the number of deaths [23].
On May 20, the number of deaths was around 12% of severe covid-19 cases in Spain, while
in São Paulo State, it was around 7%. The number of deaths is closely related to the number of
severe covid-19 cases. As we pointed out, the close interaction between locked-down young and
elder subpopulations (the presence of infectious young individuals increases the risk of infection
among elders [15]) increased the epidemic in the elder subpopulation, increasing deaths. Moreover, the quick increase in the number of severe covid-19 in Spain overloaded hospitals and,
hence, may have contributed to an increase in the death of untreated patients, especially elders.
The current relatively low number of deaths in São Paulo State compared with that observed
in Spain indicate that the health care system must be prepared to avoid the overloading in
hospitals.
The lockdown adopted in Spain was an extreme measure imposed by the critical epidemiological situation. To avoid the peak of the forthcoming epidemic, São Paulo State cogitated to
adopt lockdown besides the isolation already implemented. The implementation of lockdown in
an ascending phase of the epidemic will transfer an elevated number of asymptomatic persons
to isolation, permitting close contact with the population already in isolation (see [15]). Hence,
the adoption of lockdown in a population already in isolation may trigger a new epidemic,
especially in the case of the SARS-CoV-2 with high transmissibility (higher R0 ). As we pointed

out, Spain showed that the combination of higher numbers of infectious and susceptible persons
in the locked-down population allowed a persistent low transmission even when Ref is lower
than one.

Remarks
In the literature, the usually assumed basic reproduction number R0 is around 3, see for instance
[6] and [7]. However, Li et al. [8] explicitly cited that, by using data from January 10 to February
8, 2020, they estimated the effective reproduction number Ref , arguing that the most recent
common ancestor could have occurred on November 17, 2019. The time elapsed from November
17, 2019 (the first case) to January 10, 2020 (the first day in the estimation) is 54 days. On
January 23, 2020, Wuhan and other cities of Hubei province imposed lockdown. As we pointed
out in Figure 1(b), taking into account the entire data, or restricting the interval of data around
the implementation of isolation in São Paulo State, the estimated Ref must be lower than 5.09.
From Figures 7 and 14, the effective reproduction number Ref for São Paulo State, 54 days
after the beginning of the epidemic, is 2.1 (April 20), while for Spain, Ref = 0.6 (March 25).
In other words, using covid-19 data beginning from April 20 (São Paulo State) or March 25
(Spain), probably the estimated effective reproduction number will be close to those retrieved
from Figures 7 and 14. On the other hand, if we estimate the basic reproduction number using
SIR model with different infective persons at t = 0, we obtain, using data collected from São
Paulo State, R0 = 3.22 (for I(0) = 10), or R0 = 2.66 (for I(0) = 25), or R0 = 2.38 (for
I(0) = 50), with other initial conditions being S(0) = 44.6 million, and R(0) = 0.
The reliable estimation of R0 is important because this number determines the magnitude
of effort to eradicate infection. For instance, the efforts of vaccination to eradicate an infection
must be vaccinating a fraction equal or greater than 1 − 1/R0 of susceptibles [9]. In [14],
analyzing vaccination as a control mechanism, if R0 is reduced by the vaccine to value lower than
one, the number of cases decreased following exponential-type decay, as we observed in Figure
14 describing the lockdown in Spain. Hence, instead of a vaccine, let us consider lockdown to
control covid-19 transmission. If R0 = 3, we must isolate at least 67% of the population, while
for R0 = 8, at least 87% of the population. As we have pointed out, 70% of the population in
lockdown does not explain the covid-19 data in Spain, but 90% of the population in lockdown
explained better the observed data. Hence, our estimations of R0 for São Paulo State (9.24) and
Spain (8.0) using the first period of covid-19 data represent the natural epidemic. Moreover,
the estimation of R0 based on the first period is in concordance with the definition of the basic
reproduction number: Completely susceptible population without constraints (interventions)
[9].

In [24] and [10] we estimated the additional mortality rates based on the observed data
and concluded that their values fitted well at the beginning of epidemic but did not provide
reliable fitting in the long-term epidemic. For instance, that method of estimation pairing
the numbers of new cases and deaths at the registering time resulted in deaths of 30% up to
80% of severe covid-19 cases at the end of the first wave of the epidemic. For this reason,
we had adopted a second method of estimation considering that the accumulated deaths in
the elder subpopulation at the end of the first wave of the epidemic must be around 10%,
underestimating the number of deaths at the beginning of the epidemic. Here, we improved
the estimation method by pairing the numbers of new cases and deaths not at the registering
time, but delayed in 15 days, which is suggested by comparing daily registered data of new
cases and deaths, see Figure 17. Figures 4 and 12 showed that this novel method of estimation
fits relatively well during the three periods of the epidemic with ∆ = 15 days. However, we
can vary ∆ according to the period of the epidemic to obtain a better fitting. For instance, in
Figure 12, the accumulated data of deaths corresponding to the natural epidemic is well fitted
using ∆ = 7 days.
The concept of herd immunity is associated with the protection provided by immunized
persons to a specific subpopulation under a higher risk of death caused by a syndrome or comorbidity. For instance, in the rubella infection, mass vaccination was planned to diminish the
infection among pregnant women to reduce the number of congenital rubella syndrome [25].
The misunderstanding of the concept of herd immunity, and the rapid dissemination of underestimated R0 around 3, may have led to misconducting public health policies. For instance, the
United Kingdom (at the beginning of epidemic) and Sweden adopted the idea of immunization
by natural infection, believing that the “herd immunity” would protect susceptible, especially
elder subpopulation. However, the concept of herd immunity must not be understood as immunization by the circulating virus with high lethality but by the vaccine, which decreases
the effective reproduction number Ref . The jump down in Figures 7 and 14 can be applied to
vaccinating k proportion of the susceptible persons. However, when the isolation and protective
measures are implemented in a population, the effective reproduction number Ref jumps down,
but this reduction in Ref is temporary and lasts whenever the population maintains adherence
to lockdown/isolation and protective measures. These non-pharmaceutical interventions can
be understood as transitory herd protection, such as the herd immunity by vaccination (when
available) protects especially the elder subpopulation under higher risk of infection and death.

Conclusion
In the absence of effective treatment and vaccine, the adoption of lockdown at the very beginning
of the epidemic is recommended to control the SARS-CoV-2 with high transmissibility and
lethality. The second strategy is the implementation of isolating as São Paulo State did. In
this case, in the circulating population, the epidemic curve is flattened to avoid the overloading
in hospitals, and the immunization by the natural epidemic is increased. Unfortunately, the
number of deaths due to covid-19 increases. The third strategy, the adoption of lockdown, is
recommended when the epidemic is out of control, and Spain is an example.
In the second and third strategies to control the covid-19 epidemic, the severe covid-19
data before the adoption of isolation or lockdown are used to estimate the basic reproduction
number. However, when the lockdown is implemented immediately after the outbreak of the
epidemic, the estimation of the basic reproduction number may not be done directly from the
observed data of severe covid-19 cases.
Isolation as well as lockdown are valuable measures to control an epidemic with high lethality. Due to the critical situation of the health care system, Spain imposed a rigid lockdown,
which impacted the fast ascending phase of the epidemic by reducing Ref below one. This
reduction resulted in a peak of 80, 750 cases occurring 20 days after the implementation of
lockdown (on March 16, Ωob = 14, 011 from the observed data). Convinced by the epidemiological situation in Spain, São Paulo State implemented isolation, as result, the peak of 67, 140
cases will occur after 91 days since isolation (on March 24, Ωob = 810 from the observed data).
The relatively early implementation of the isolation in São Paulo State in somehow avoided the
overloading in the health care system by flattening the epidemic curve.
The proportion of the immune persons at the end of the first wave of epidemic is 40% of the
population in São Paulo State, and 26% of the population in Spain. On June 8 (phase 3 of the
release in Spain [22]), the effective reproduction number was 0.51 and 23.5% of the population
was immune, showing that Spain was close to the end of the first wave of the epidemic. This
relatively safe epidemiological scenario was favorable to implement a carefully planned release.
However, on June 15, the effective reproduction number was 0.98 but in the ascending phase
of the epidemic, and 16.7% of the population was immune, showing that São Paulo State
was far from the end of the epidemic. If the isolated persons are released in this unfavorable
epidemiological scenario, the already intense transmission of SARS-CoV-2 may be enhanced.
All these findings will help to plan strategies of release, which is left to further work.

Materials and Methods
We present a mathematical model from which we obtain the basic reproduction number R0 and
the effective reproduction number Ref , we describe the data of severe covid-19 cases and deaths
collected from São Paulo State and Spain, and we obtain values for the model parameters.

Mathematical model – Retrieving R0 and Ref
We present a mathematical model to describe the covid-19 epidemic and the calculation of the
basic and effective reproduction numbers R0 and Ref . The model aims to assess the effects of
isolation and lockdown on the epidemic of covid-19.
Formulation of the model
In a community where SARS-CoV-2 is circulating, the risk of infection is greater in elder than
young persons, as well as elder persons are under an increased probability of being symptomatic
and higher covid-19 induced mortality. Hence, the community is divided into two groups,
composed of young (60 years old or less, denoted by subscript y), and elder (60 years old or
more, denoted by subscript o) persons. The vital dynamic of this community is described by
the per-capita rates of birth (φ) and mortality (µ).
For each subpopulation j (j = y, o), all persons are divided into nine classes: susceptible
Sj , susceptible persons who are isolated Qj , exposed and incubating Ej , asymptomatic Aj ,
symptomatic persons in the initial phase of covid-19 (or pre-diseased) D1j , pre-diseased persons
caught by test and then isolated Q1j , symptomatic persons with severe covid-19 D2j , mild covid19 Q2j , and mild covid-19 persons isolating themselves by educational campaign Q3j . However,
all young and elder persons in classes Aj , Q1j , Q2j , Q3j , and D2j enter into the same immune
class I (this is the 10th class, but common to both subpopulations).
The natural history of new coronavirus infection is the same for young (j = y) and elder
(j = o) subpopulations. We assume that persons in the asymptomatic (Aj ), pre-diseased (D1j ),
and a fraction zj of mild covid-19 (Q2j ) classes are transmitting the virus, and other infected
classes (Q1j , (1 − zj ) Q2j and D2j ) are under voluntary or forced isolation. Susceptible persons
are infected according to λj Sj (known as the mass action law [9]) and enter into class Ej , where
λj is the per-capita incidence rate (or force of infection) defined by λj = λ (δjy + ψδjo ), with λ
being

transmission rates, that is, the rates at which a virus encounters a susceptible people and infects
him/her. The parameters ε ≤ 1, and ω ≥ 1 diminish the transmission rates. The protection
factor ε decreases the transmission of infection by individual (face mask, hygiene, etc.) and
collective (social distancing) protective measures, while the reduction factor ω decreases the
transmission by the contact being restricted in the population in isolation (household and/or
neighborhood contacts). After an average period 1/σj in class Ej , where σj is the incubation
rate, exposed persons enter into the asymptomatic class Aj (with probability pj ) or pre-diseased
class D1j (with probability 1 − pj ). After an average period 1/γj in class Aj , where γj is the
recovery rate of asymptomatic persons, symptomatic persons acquire immunity (recovered) and
enter into immune class I. Possibly asymptomatic persons can manifest symptoms at the end
of this period, and a fraction 1 − χj enters into mild covid-19 class Q2j . Another route of exit
from class Aj is being caught by a test at a rate ηj and enter into class I (we assume that this
person indeed adopts isolation, which is the reason to enter into class I at a rate of testing).
For symptomatic persons, after an average period 1/γ1j in class D1j , where γ1j is the infection
rate of pre-diseased persons, pre-diseased persons enter into severe covid-19 class D2j (with
probability 1 − mj ) or class Q2j (with probability mj ), or they are caught by test at a rate η1j
and enter into class Q1j . Persons in class D2 acquire immunity after period 1/γ2j , where γ2j
is the recovery rate of severe covid-19, and enter into class I or die under the disease-induced
(additional) mortality rate αj . Another route of exiting class D2j is by treatment, described
by the treatment rate θj . Class Q1j is composed of mild and severe covid-19 persons who came
from class D1j caught by test, hence they enter into class D2j (with the rate (1 − mj ) γ1j ) or
class I (with the rate mj γ1j +γ2j , assuming adherence to isolation). Persons in class Q2j acquire
immunity after period 1/γ3j , where γ3j is the recovery rate of mild covid-19, and enter into
immune class I. Another route of exit from class Q2j are being caught by a test at a rate η2j
and enter into class I (assumption of adherence to isolation), or enter to class Q3y convinced by
an education campaign at a rate $j , which is temporary, hence ξj is the rate of abandonment
of protective measures [26].
In the model, we consider pulse isolation and intermittent (series of pulses) release of persons. We assume that there is a unique pulse in isolation at time t = τjis , described by

P
kj Sj δ t − τjis , but there are m intermittent releases described by m
i=1 lij Qj δ (t − ti ), where
Pi
is
ti = τj + w=1 τwj , j = y, o, and δ (x) is Dirac delta function, that is, δ (x) = ∞, if x = 0,
R∞
otherwise, δ (x) = 0, with 0 δ (x) dx = 1. The fraction of persons in isolation is kj , and lij ,
i = 1, 2, · · · , m, is the fraction of i-th release of isolated persons, with τwj being the period
between successive releases.
Figure 16 shows the flowchart of the new coronavirus transmission model.

(8), the initial conditions (at t = 0) are, for j = y, o,
Sj (0) = N0j , Xj (0) = nXj , where Xj = Qj , Ej , Aj , D1j , Q1j , Q2j , Q3j , D2j , I,

(9)

and nXj is a non-negative number. For instance, nEy = nEo = 0 means that there is not any
exposed person (young and elder) at the beginning of the epidemic.
We do not deal with the release of the isolated population (left to further work), hence here
we let lij = 0, with j = y, o, and i = 1, 2, · · · , m. The isolation implemented at t = τ is is
described by the boundary conditions
Sj (τ is+ ) = Sj (τ is− ) (1 − kj ) and Qj (τ is+ ) = Qj (τ is− ) + Sj (τ is− ) kj ,

where we have τ is− = limt→τ is t (for t < τ is ), and τ is+ = limτ is ←t t (for t > τ is ). If isolation is
applied to a completely susceptible population at t = 0, there are not any infectious persons,
so S(0) = N0 . If isolation is done at t = τjis without a screening of persons harboring the virus,
then many of the asymptomatic persons could be isolated with susceptible persons.
Table 2 summarizes the model parameters. The description of the assigned values (for elder
classes, values are between parentheses) can be found below.
From the solution of the system of equations (5), (6) and (8), we can derive some epidemiological parameters: number of susceptible persons, the number of new cases of covid019,
accumulated and daily cases of severe covid-19, and number of deaths due to covid-19. All
initial conditions below are determined by the initial conditions (9) supplied to the system of

We can estimate the severity case fatality rate as the quotient Π/Ω, and the infection fatality
rate as Π/Φ.
The basic reproduction number R0 – Trivial equilibrium point and its stability
The basic reproduction number R0 is obtained by the analysis of the trivial equilibrium point

is autonomous (we let kj = lij = 0, j = y, o), but the population N varies. For this reason,

The spectral radius ρ (F V −1 ) is the biggest solution of a third degree polynomial, which is not
easy to evaluate. The procedure proposed in [28] allows us to obtain the threshold Rc as the
sum of coefficients of the characteristic equation, where Rc is the reduced reproduction number
given by
(
Rc = Rcy + Rco , where

Rcy = Ry s0y ,
Rco = Ro s0o ,

(
with

Ry =
Ro =

ω
ε
ω

(R1y + R2y ) ,
(R1o + R2o ) .

(25)

Hence, the trivial equilibrium point P 0 is locally asymptotically stable if Rc < 1.
The basic reproduction number R0 is given by
(
R0 = R0y + R0o , where

R0y = Ry s0y ,
R0o = Ro s0o ,

(
with

Ry = R1y + R2y ,
Ro = R1o + R2o ,

(26)

where R1y , R2y , R1o , and R2o are obtained from equation (24) letting ε = ω = 1 (absence of
protective measures), ηj = η1j = η2j = 0 (absence of test), and $o = 0 (absence of educational
campaign), for j = y, o. All these control actions to decrease the epidemic are absent at the
beginning of the epidemic, and the definition of the basic reproduction number is fulfilled.
The basic reproduction number R0 is the secondary cases produced by one infectious person
(could be anyone in one of the classes harboring virus) in a completely susceptible young and
elder populations without constraints [9]. Let us understand R1j and R2j , j = y, o, stressing
that the interpretation is the same for both subpopulations, hence we drop out subscript j. To
facilitate the interpretation, we consider this infectious person in exposed class E. This person
enters into one of the infectious classes composed of asymptomatic (A), pre-diseased (D1 ), and
a fraction of mild covid-19 (Q2 ).

1. R1 takes into account the transmission by one person in asymptomatic A or pre-diseased
D1 class. We interpret for asymptomatic person transmitting (between parentheses, for
pre-diseased person) infection. One infectious person survives during the incubation period with probability σ/ (σ + φ) and enters into asymptomatic class with probability
p (pre-diseased, with 1 − p) and generates, during the time 1/ (γ + φ) (pre-diseased,
1/ (γ1 + φ)) staying in this class, on average β1 / (γ + φ) (pre-diseased, β2 / (γ1 + φ)) secondary cases.
2. R2 takes into account the transmission by a mild covid-19 person. An infectious person has
two routes to reach Q2 : passing through A or D1 (this case is given between parentheses).
One infectious person survives during the incubation period with probability σ/ (σ + φ)
and enters into asymptomatic (pre-diseased) class with probability p (pre-diseased, with
1 − p); survives in this class and also is not caught by a test with probability γ/ (γ + φ)
(pre-diseased, γ1 / (γ1 + φ)) and enters into mild covid-19 class Q2 with probability 1 − χ
(pre-diseased, m); and generates, during the time 1/ (γ3 + φ) staying in this class, on
average zβ3 / (γ3 + φ) secondary cases.
Hence, R0 = R0y s0y + R0o s0o is the overall number of secondary cases generated form one
primary case introduced into a completely susceptible young and elder subpopulations. The
model parameters are not accurate, and it is expected that R0 be influenced by the inaccuracy
of those values. The variation of R0 with uncertainties in the parameters can be assessed by
the sensitivity analysis [30].
The model given by the system of equations (5), (6) and (8) is non-autonomous and nonconstant deterministic model. To obtain the basic reproduction number, we dropped out the
pulses in isolation and release in the model and transformed into fractions to obtain R0 . This
deterministic model provides an overall view of the epidemic. However, some particular/specific
features of the epidemic can be dealt with.
In our model, we can incorporate the mobility especially of infectious individuals, and apply
the technique of finding traveling waves. By doing this, the geographic expansion of SARSCoV-2 by calculating the velocity of the front of the wave can be achieved. For instance, the
dengue expansion in São Paulo State [31] and West Nile Virus in American Continent [32] were
evaluated by the method of finding traveling waves.
We did not consider uncertainties in our model parameters, which can be introduced considering the stochastic version. For instance, the transmission rate βdt can be written as
β̄dt ± σβ̄ dB(t), where σβ̄ is the standard deviation of average β̄ and B is the Brownian motion.
Gray et al. [33] analyzed the SIS model to determine the standard deviation σβ̄ and performed
computational simulations.

Instead of continuously varying the number of individuals in each class, our model can
be simulated allowing integer variation in the population. For instance, Freitas [34] used
a continuous-time stochastic version of the SEIRV (V stands for vaccinated subpopulation)
model with integer-valued states. The simulations were done applying the Gillespie algorithm,
considering that the transitions between compartments occur randomly according to a Markov
chain with transition rates equal to the deterministic rates. A more complex stochastic process
can also be applied considering all classes in our model as stochastic variables. For instance,
the stochastic process was applied to schistosomiasis transmission [35].
Computational modelings can be formulated. There are innumerous methods, being the
agent-based model (ABM) the most widespread. ABM is derived from cellular automata letting
each cell carrying on much information. For instance, Ferreira et al. [36] applied cellular
automata approach to evaluate the suitability of sterile insect technique to control Aedes aegipty
when breeding sites are homogeneously and heterogeneously distributed.
However, in computational models, after obtaining thousands of trajectories, the mean-field
is calculated [36] as well as in the stochastic simulation. However, in the stochastic process, the
average values can be calculated for the stochastic variables and, in some cases, these averaged
variables follow the corresponding deterministic model [35].
The effective reproduction number Ref – Non-trivial equilibrium point
The effective reproduction number Ref is defined by one of the equations of the dynamic
system at the non-trivial equilibrium point P ∗ . For instance, for the SEIR model, the equation
relating susceptible persons must obey at the equilibrium, R0 s = 1, from which Ref is defined
by Ref = R0 s, where s varies with time. Notice that at the beginning of the epidemic (t = 0)
we have s = 1, and Ref = R0 , and at the steady-state (t → ∞), s = s∗ and obeys Ref = 1,
resulting in s∗ = 1/R0 . In the preceding section we showed that R0 is given by equation (26),
but we did not proved that s∗ = 1/R0 due to the complexity of the new system of equations
(17), (18) and (19), and it is not an easy task to determine the non-trivial (endemic) equilibrium
point P ∗ .
However, when zy = zo = 0, we can show that the inverse of the basic reproduction number
R0 is the fraction of susceptible persons in the steady-state [10]. However, we have young
and elder subpopulations, hence the fraction of susceptible individuals at endemic equilibrium
s∗ = s∗y + s∗o is related generically as

and the effective reproduction number Ref [37], which varies with time, can not be defined
neither by Ref = R0 (sy + so ), nor Ref = R0y sy + R0o so . For instance, for dengue transmission
model, f (s∗1 , s∗2 ) = s∗1 × s∗2 , where s∗1 and s∗2 are the fractions at equilibrium of, respectively,
humans and mosquitoes [38]. For tuberculosis model considering drug-sensitive and resistant
strains, s∗ is solution of a second degree polynomial [18]. For this reason, we define the approximated effective reproduction number Ref as
Ref = Ry sy + Ro so ,

(28)

which depends on time, and when attains steady-state (Ref = 1), we have s∗ = 1/R0 .
The basic reproduction number R0 obtained from mathematical modelings provides two
useful information: At the beginning of the epidemic (t = 0), R0 gives the magnitude of control
efforts, and when epidemic reaches the steady-state (after many waves of the epidemic, that is,
t → ∞), R0 measures its severity providing the fraction of susceptible individuals, in general,
s∗ = 1/R0 [18]. Between these two extremes, the effective reproduction number Ref dictates
the course of an epidemic, which follows decaying oscillations around Ref = 1 [14].
The effective reproduction number Ref , given by equation (28), can be applied directly to
the system of equations (5), (6) and (8) by substituting sy and so by Sy /N and So /N , that is,
Ref

(29)

where Sy , So , and N vary with time (remember that the fractions Sy /N and So /N approach
steady-state). We describe the variation of Ref during the epidemic.
1. Natural epidemic. The population, initially, did not adopt any protection measures
against the covid-19 epidemic, and at t = 0 we have Ref (0) = R0 , where the basic
reproduction number is obtained by substituting s0y and s0o by N0y /N0 and N0o /N0 in
equation (20), resulting in
R0 = Ry

where Ry and Ro are given by equation (26). For t > 0, Ref decreases as susceptible
populations decrease.
2. Isolation. At t = τ is a pulse in isolation is introduced, decreasing the number of susceptible persons, from Sy (τ is− ) and So (τ is− ) to Sy (τ is+ ) and So (τ is+ ), see equations (10)
and (11). The decrease in the susceptible populations at τ is results in Ref (τ is− ) jumping

where R1y , R2y , R1o , and R2o are given by equation (26). For t > τ is , Ref decreases as
susceptible populations decrease.
3. Adopting protective measures. The protective measures are incorporated in the modeling
by the factor ε in the circulating population and the restricted contact by ω in the isolated
population. At the time of introducing these measures T , the effective reproduction
number just before the time of the adoption of protective measures Ref (T − ) jumps down
to Ref (T + ) = Rp by factor ε/ω, that is,

where R1y , R2y , R1o , and R2o are given by equation (26). For t > T , Ref decreases as
susceptible populations decrease.
Therefore, the importance of a mathematical model is the capability of providing the basic
and effective reproduction numbers, which give information about the risk of infection during
the epidemic. Our model is complex, but we could obtain R0 , which was not an easy task.
However, a more complex model can be formulated incorporating novel findings of the covid-19
epidemic, but we must be aware that the basic reproduction number must be obtained from
the model.

Description of data collection from São Paulo State and Spain
We first present a detailed description of the data collected from São Paulo State, and briefly
the data collected from Spain.
Data from São Paulo State
Figure 17 shows the daily (a) and accumulated (b) severe covid-19 cases, and daily (c) and
accumulated (d) deaths collected from São Paulo State [17].
Figure 18 shows the proportion in the population in isolation (a), and daily cases plus the
proportion in isolation moved 9 days to the right (b). The horizontal line in Figure 18(a)
corresponds to the mean value kmean = 0.53, around which daily proportions vary impacting
on the transmission [39].

We discuss roughly the collected covid-19 cases shown in Figure 17. Interestingly, Figure
17(a) shows that the daily data present weekly seasonality, with lower cases at the weekend [17],
due to the procedure of registering the day at which occurred the confirmation by laboratory
testing, not the beginning of symptoms.

reach peak 2 weeks later (around 4, 000 cases in the 13th week, March 22-28). After this

day earlier, only 66 cases, and around 180 cases per day in the 13th week). Figure 17(b)
shows this jump up on March 31. This increased number of cases should be explained
by more testing among SARS to identify covid-19, or by the exponential-like increasing
of the epidemic in the beginning, or probably by both. Figure 17(a) shows an unusual
jump up when comparing 13th week and 14th week (March 29 - April 4), which is not
observed in the next weeks, suggesting that the isolation decreased the force of infection.
Indeed, the isolation was introduced on March 24, but after 10 days, on April 3, there
is a change in the exponential-like trend, becoming less abrupt. Figure 17(b) shows an
increasing trend in blocks of week affected by weekly seasonality shown in Figure 17(a)
depending on the proportion in isolation that occurred 9 or 10 days earlier.
(B) Let us compare severe covid-19 cases and proportion in isolation week by week, Figure
17(b). Notice that there is a jump up from the 13th to 14th week, showing an exponentiallike increase. However, there is not jump in the 15th week (April 5-11), possibly showing
the effects of isolation. In the 16th week (April 12-18) there were strong variations in the
covid-19 cases, maybe due to huge variation in the proportions in isolation 9 days earlier.
In the 17th week (April 19-25), the increased number of cases corresponds to decreased
proportions in isolation including weekend (on April 25, Sunday, there was the highest
number of cases). This increasing trend continued in the next 18th week (April 26 - May
2), when the proportions in isolation fluctuated, but a relatively small number of cases
were registered during the extended holiday (May 1-3). The behavior observed in the 17th
and 18th weeks may be the effects of manifestation against isolation occurred on April

18: the peak on April 25 and the high number of cases lasting until April 30, that is, 7
to 12 days after the manifestation is the interval with median 9.5 and variation 2.5 (sum
of incubation and pre-diseased periods is 9.8).
(C) From Figure 17(b), the accumulated covid-19 cases show three periods with different
trends. The first period from February 26 to April 3 corresponds to the natural epidemic.
The second period, from April 4 to April 12, corresponds to the isolation effectively
decreasing the epidemic, and the last period, since April 13, the additional reduction in
the transmission of covid-19 occurs due to the protective measures.
From the daily registered deaths due to covid-19 shown in Figure 17, we observe a correspondence between the number of deaths, Figure 17(c), and the number of covid-19 cases,
Figure 17(a), occurred around 15 days ago. For instance, on May 18, São Paulo State registered
41 deaths, and on May 19, 324. However, on May 3 and 4, 15 and 14 days before May 18,
there were registered, respectively, 598 and 415 covid-19 cases, while on May 5 and 6, 14 and 13
days before May 19, 1, 866 and 3, 800 covid-19 cases were registered. Hence, we can infer that
the number of deaths corresponds to cases of covid-19 occurred around 14 to 15 days earlier.
For instance, on May 13, 14, 15, and 16, the daily registered covid-19 cases were, respectively,
3, 378, 3, 189, 4, 092, and 2, 805, and it is expected an elevated number of deaths after 15 days.
Data from Spain
Figure 19 shows the daily (a) and accumulated (b) severe covid-19 cases, and daily (c) and
accumulated (d) deaths collected from Spain, from January 31 to May 20 [21].
Analyzing the data collected from Spain, we observe three trends. The first period, from
January 31 to March 21, had an exponential-like increase, which is followed by the second
period with less increase from March 22 to 28, and the last period with a slow increase since
March 29. The effects of lockdown implemented on March 16 are expected to appear 9 days
later [15], on March 25. The intermediate period from March 22 to 28 is centered on March
25 with 3 days of variation, called the transition period from natural to lockdown epidemic.
Hence, we divide the epidemiological scenarios of Spain into three stages, and we estimate
the transmission rates βy and βo , the protection factor ε, and the decreasing factor ω. The
additional mortality rates αy and αo are also estimated.

Values for the model parameters
The values assigned in Table 2 are obtained from the estimation of covid-19 cases and deaths,
or they are calculated.

this estimation method of parameters is extremely complex, and considering observed data
only in one variable of the dynamic system is not appropriate (see [42]). For this reason, we

evaluate the sum of squared differences by varying model parameters. This simplified method
of parameter evaluation does not provide uncertainties associated with the parameters.
To evaluate the transmission rates in the natural epidemic (there are not any interventions
at the beginning of the epidemic, then ε = ω = 1), we assume that all rates in young persons
are equal, as well as in elder persons letting
βy = β1y = β2y = β3y = β1o = β2o = β3o ,

and

βo = ψβy ,

and the forces of infection are λy = (Ay + D1y + zy Q2y + Ao + D1o + zo Q2o ) βy /N and λo = ψλ.
The reason to include a factor ψ is the reduced capacity of a defense mechanism by elder persons
(physical barrier, innate and adaptive immune responses, etc.). Another fact is the expression
of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in the nasal epithelium, the receptor that SARS-CoV-2
uses for host entry, which increases with age [43]. The force of infection takes into account all
virus released by infectious individuals (Ay , D1y , Q2y , Ao , D1o and Q2o ), the rate of encounter
with susceptible persons (many factors, especially demographic density and closeness), and the
capacity to infect them (see [44] [45]). Additionally, the amount inhaled by susceptible persons
can be determinant in the chance of infection and the prognosis of covid-19 [46]. We also
assume that the proportions in the isolated young and elder subpopulations are equal, that is,
k = ky = ko .
Currently, there is not a sufficient number of kits to detect infection by the new coronavirus.
For this reason, test to confirm infection by this virus is done only in hospitalized persons, and
also in persons who died manifesting symptoms of covid-19. Hence, we have only data of
accumulated severe covid-19 cases (Ω = Ωy + Ωo ) and those who died (Π = Πy + Πo ).
To evaluate the parameters βy and βo = ψβy , the proportions in the isolated population k,
and reduction in the transmission rates due to protective measures adopted by population ε
and decreased contact ω, we calculate

ratio of deaths occurring in young and elder subpopulations. We fix the previously estimated

the data from São Paulo State.

σo = 1/5.8 days−1 . We use for the infectious rates of pre-diseased persons, γ1 = γ1y = γ1o = 1/4
days−1 [49], which is indirectly confirmed by the delay observed in 9 days between low isolation
and increase in covid-19 cases. It was observed approximately 2 weeks for the duration of mild
disease, then we use γo = 1/14 and γy = 1/12 (both in days−1 ), and critical disease lasts 2-6
weeks, then we use γ2o = 1/21 and γ2y = 1/12 (both in days−1 ) [3].
Li et al. [8] observed that 86% of all infections were undocumented, and assuming that
the ratio between asymptomatic and symptomatic young and elder persons are equal, we let
p = py = po = 4/5 = 0.8. Additionally, Pan et al. [50] observed that in a family of three, one
had clinical symptoms, and the other two members were both asymptomatic. From São Paulo
State, 76% of deaths due to covid-19 are 60 years old or more, then the ratio of death is 1 : 3 to
young persons [17]. However, the ratio may be lower in severe covid-19 cases, then we assume
2 : 3 (in São Bernardo de Campo City, São Paulo State, the ratio of hospitalized young and
elder persons is 2 : 3.3). From the observation that 81% are mild and can recover at home [51],
we consider a lowered ratio between mild and severe covid-19 among elder persons 3 : 1, hence
mo = 3/4 = 0.75. To have ratio 2 : 3 between young and elder in hospitalized persons, we must
have approximately 10 : 1 in the ratio between asymptomatic and symptomatic among young
persons. Gathering the above information, we calculate approximately
c=

1−b 1 2
× × ,
b
4 3

where the term (1 − b) /b is the populational ratio between young and elder persons, 1/4 is
the proportion of severe covid-19 cases among elder persons, and 2/3 is the ratio between

hospitalized young and elder persons. Using b = 0.153, we have c = 0.92. Hence, the ratio
asymptomatic:symptomatic of young persons is approximately 12 : 1, which results in my =
12/13 = 0.92, for py = po .
The dynamic of the new coronavirus propagation is obtained by evaluating the system
of equations (5), (6) and (8) numerically using the 4th order Runge-Kutta method. Let us
determine the initial conditions supplied to this system. In São Paulo State, the number of
inhabitants is N (0) = N0 = 44.6 million [11]. The value of parameter ϕ given in Table 1
was calculated by rewriting the equation (20) as ϕ = bφ/ (1 − b), where b is the proportion of
elder persons. Using b = 0.153 in São Paulo State [11], we obtained ϕ = 6.7 × 10−6 days−1 ,
hence, Ny (0) = N0y = 37.8 million (s0y = N0y /N0 = 0.848) and No (0) = N0o = 6.8 million
(s0o = N0o /N0 = 0.153). Hence, the initial conditions for susceptible persons are Sy (0) = N0y
and So (0) = N0o for São Paulo State. Following the same idea, the initial conditions for Spain
are Sy (0) = 35.17 million and So (0) = 12.23 million.
The initial conditions for other variables are calculated based on Table 2. Using py = po =
0.8, the ratio asymptomatic:symptomatic is 4 : 1 for young and elder persons; using mo = 0.75,
the ratio mild:severe covid-19 is 3 : 1 for elder persons, and for young persons, the ratio is
12 : 1 from my = 0.92. Hence, for elder subpopulation, if we assume that there is one person
in D2o (the first confirmed case), then there are 3 persons in Q2o ; the sum (4) is the number of
persons in D1o , implying that there are 16 in Ao , hence, the sum (20) is the number of persons
in Eo . Notice that, if there is 1 person in D2y , then there must be 12 persons in Q2y . For young
subpopulation, we assume that there is not any person in D2y , but 6 persons in Q2y , then the
sum (6) is the number of persons in D1y , implying that there are 24 in Ay , hence, the sum
(30) is the number of persons in Ey . Finally, we suppose that no one is isolated or tested, and
immunized.
Therefore, the initial conditions supplied to the dynamic system (5), (6) and (8) are, for
young and elder subpopulations,

