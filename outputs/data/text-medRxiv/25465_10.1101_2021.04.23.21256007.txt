Abstract
Introduction. The COVID-19 pandemic focused attention on city parks as important public
resources. However, it is unknown how city park use in 2020 compared to prior years and
whether COVID-19 may have exacerbated racial/ethnic inequities in access. Moreover,
traditional methods of measuring park use present major drawbacks. Methods. We analyzed
monthly mobility data derived from a large panel of smartphone devices, cross-referenced with
a database of parks locations sourced from local agencies. We assessed park use trends in 44
of the 50 most populous U.S. cities from January 2018 to November 2020 using interrupted time
series regressions. We also compared parks to other city amenities (e.g., gyms and libraries).
Results. Based on a sample of 5,559 city parks, park visits declined by 14.6% (95% CI [9.2,
19.7], p < 0.001) from March through November 2020, compared to prior levels and trends.
When we segmented the COVID-19 period by time of widespread closures (March-April) and
partial-to-full reopenings (May-November), we estimated a larger reduction during closures
(35.7% reduction, 95% CI [33.5, 37.8], p < 0.001) compared to the reduction during reopenings
(8.0% reduction, 95% CI [1.9, 13.7], p = 0.001). Reductions for other amenities were more
prolonged. In park service areas where a greater proportion of residents were White, reopening
was associated with more visits, suggesting that racial privilege influenced access.
Conclusions. Smartphone mobility data can address a data availability gap for monitoring park
use. Park use only declined modestly in 2020. Opportunities exist to make access more racially
equitable.

Significance statement
Parks are public resources that promote health. Little is known about how parks have been
used during the COVID-19 pandemic, when parks have become particularly important public
spaces. This study introduces an approach to monitor park use over time, using location data
from smartphones. This approach enabled the authors to evaluate trends in park use during the
pandemic, including major gaps in visits to parks according to whether they mostly served White
residents or residents of color. This big data approach offers advantages over traditional
methods for monitoring park use and can help city officials to identify and address inequities in
park access.

Introduction
Parks are public resources that promote health by providing spaces for exercise and play,
access to nature, protection from heat, and opportunities to socialize and build community
cohesion. These functions may be particularly valuable in large cities, where higher residential
density increases the value of access to outdoor greenspace. During the COVID-19 pandemic,
indoor social gatherings and other recreational activities carried serious risk of disease
transmission in most communities. Additionally, other amenities for sports and leisure were
forced to close. Parks represented comparatively low-risk alternatives. As a result, park use is
reported to have boomed in 2020.1 On the other hand, we might expect increases in city park
use associated with changing exercise and leisure patterns to be offset by drops associated
with restrictions on organized sports, the cancellation of concerts and other large gatherings,
and closures of schools and playgrounds. This article introduces an application of smartphone
data to describe and analyze park use in 2020, compared with previous, non-pandemic years.
In particular, we are interested in disaggregating those data by race: did Black, Latinx, and other
residents of color use parks at the same rates as non-Hispanic White residents in 2020? People
of color (“POCs”) have experienced a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 infection and
mortality,2 which may have increased their caregiving demands3,4 or influenced their perceptions
of safety in public spaces.5 Since U.S. communities are characterized by high rates of
residential racial segregation, public spaces in majority-POC communities may indeed have
carried elevated COVID-19 transmission risk.6 Moreover, POCs are disproportionately
represented among essential workers and less able to work from home, which may reduce their
time available for recreation.
Racial and ethnic disparities in parks access existed prior to COVID-19. POCs have reported
barriers to park use including a relative lack of leisure time,7,8 lack of social support to use parks
for exercise,8,9 and lack of programs that suit needs of the community such as afterschool
programs or fitness programs outside of traditional workday hours.9,10 Although urban-dwelling
POCs typically live in areas with higher concentrations of parks within walking distance (i.e., 0.5
miles, or approximately a 10-minute walk for an able-bodied resident) compared with nonHispanic white residents,11–15 they report walking routes that are unsafe or poorly
maintained.12,13,15,16
Little empirical research has measured changes in park use during COVID-19. We conducted
empirical tests of these hypotheses: (1) Park use in U.S. cities increased in 2020, compared to
prior years, and (2) Trends in city park use differed in 2020 by race. Traditional approaches for
measuring park use would severely limit our ability to test these hypotheses. Systematic
observation of parks10,17would rely on the availability of pre-COVID observations and pose
difficulties in conducting in-person data collection on a large scale. Population surveys,
assuming they could be compared to pre-COVID results, would be limited in their utility by selfreport.

Digital methods may offer the most suitable combination of objectivity and scalability. Some
prior work has captured park use based on geolocation data from cohorts using wearable
trackers16,18–20 or from geotagged social media posts.14. For this study, we use parks visit data
generated from the locations of a sample of smartphone devices equal to approximately 10% of
the U.S. population. While these mobility data have been used extensively to examine COVID
transmission dynamics,21–24 their application to understanding other health behaviors has been
limited. Prior work using smartphone mobility data found that U.S. park visits declined
substantially during the initial weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic.23 Another study found that
park use rebounded considerably after that initial drop, but since the authors used data indexed
to the initial weeks of 2020, they were unable to assess whether the rebound was atypical
compared to ordinary seasonal trends in park use.25
Here, we employ monthly panel data from SafeGraph on visits to a large sample of city parks,
drawn from 44 large U.S. cities, with observations from January 2018 through November 2020.
Since raw SafeGraph data pose challenges for analyzing longitudinal trends in place visits,
particularly for parks, we propose methods for matching SafeGraph parks to validated parks
data and generating longitudinal comparisons of park use. We use these methods to estimate
changes that occurred in 2020, beginning with the initial wave of shutdown measures in March.
Beyond testing the hypotheses about increases park use and differences in use according to
race, we explore the potential of the data and methods used to monitor the use of local
amenities in real time and disaggregate in meaningful ways that can inform city policies.
Methods
Data
Our primary data source for this study was monthly park visit panel data provided by
SafeGraph, a company that aggregates data on smartphone device locations from users whose
settings allow their location data to be collected anonymously by 3rd party applications. The data
we used is aggregated by points of interest (“POI”), each of which represents a spatial location
(e.g., a coffee shop at a particular address) where a device could be located when it issues a
“ping” to SafeGraph. Although SafeGraph maintains a database of visits to over 4 million POIs,
these locations are predominantly commercial locations. In principle, measuring foot traffic at
parks is not more challenging than measuring foot traffic at retail stores; however, there may be
limited incentives for for-profit data companies like SafeGraph to maintain park visitation data
that are as complete and accurate as retail locations data. A 2020 analysis found that the
SafeGraph parks data for Philadelphia corresponded to roughly half of the city’s parks acreage
and that the polygons SafeGraph used to represent parks boundaries sometimes overlapped
only partially with the actual park boundaries.26

To address these shortcomings, we cross-referenced the SafeGraph park locations with park
locations assembled by the Trust for Public Land (TPL). TPL includes publicly-accessible parks,
trails, and open space in its database.27 The TPL park database is based on city-, town- and
community-provided parks data or, when no data was provided, park data was created based
on available resources such as park information from municipal websites, spatial data available
from counties and states, and satellite imagery. We considered a SafeGraph park to have
matched a TPL park if the SafeGraph park centroid intersected a TPL polygon and the area of
the SafeGraph polygon was within 0.5 to 1.5 times the area of the TPL polygon. SafeGraph
parks that matched TPL parks (hereafter, the “SafeGraph sample”) were included in the study.
This process was designed to omit SafeGraph parks with poorly-drawn polygons or which
corresponded to places (e.g., outdoor museums) that local agencies do not consider to be
parks. Also, we included only parks that have appeared in the SafeGraph dataset every month
since January 2018, omitting a substantial proportion (approximately 1/3) that were added in
mid-2020, and securing a full panel across the study duration. We conducted data processing
and analyses in R. Additional technical details and replication code are included in the
Appendix. We applied this technique using all parks in each dataset within the geographical
boundaries of each of the 50 most populous U.S. cities, discarding observations from 5 cities
that did not provide geographical boundary data online and 1 city (Colorado Springs, CO) where
fewer than 25 SafeGraph parks matched TPL parks. The resulting dataset included park visits
from 44 cities, ranging in population from over 8 million (New York City, NY) to approximately
400,000 (Arlington, TX).
We also obtained area-based estimates of the characteristics of residents living within a 10minute (or 0.5 mile) walk of each park, or within service areas delineated within TPL’s
ParkServe database. These estimates were calculated by creating a 10-minute walkable service
area using a nationwide walkable road network dataset provided by Esri, and using these
service areas to generate overall access statistics for each park, place, and urban area included
in the database, and then further disaggregating by race/ethnicity, age, and household income.
A 10-minute walking distance is frequently cited as the service area of city parks. We used
these data to assess the representativeness of parks included in the SafeGraph sample and
calculate sampling weights equal to the inverse of the probability that each park would be
included in the SafeGraph sample, given its service area characteristics and the city where it
was located.
Our outcomes were the total number of monthly visits to each park in the SafeGraph sample,
from January 2018 through November 2020. Following recommendations from SafeGraph, we
adjusted these raw visit totals to account for changes in the size of the panel of smartphone
devices in each city from month to month. For the cities we analyzed, the total panel size
ranged from approximately 4.5 million to approximately 10.2 million over the months we studied.
Although SafeGraph recommends removing outlying observations, we manually reviewed the
highest-visit observations and believed these counts to be plausible. For example, the farthest
outliers were visits to Balboa Park in San Diego during the month that the city hosted the

ComicCon convention close to the park. We accounted for the statistical influence of outliers
using our regression technique (see below). Finally, over time, recorded visits to POIs tend to
increase because SafeGraph’s systems improve at recording these visits, rather than any
underlying change in device behaviors; we account for this exogenous effect using model
parameters.
To contextualize our park use findings, we obtained SafeGraph data on visits to other public
amenities used for exercise (gyms) and social connection (places of worship) and which
represent considerable public investments (libraries and transit stations). For these comparator
locations, we followed the same data preparation procedures as for park visits, except we
assumed that all points of interest were correctly bounded and classified, omitting the crossreferencing step.
Statistical analysis
Our unit of analysis was monthly observations for each park in the sample. Our main model was
an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression with calendar-month fixed effects, to account for
seasonality. To remove bias from increased recording of POI visits (as discussed above), we
included calendar-year fixed effects. Since the visit counts were distributed approximately lognormal, we modeled the natural log of our outcome variable, which also limited the influence of
outliers. We applied sampling weights, described above, to each model. We report our results
as changes in the rates of park visits. Since intraclass correlation (in our case, observations that
might be correlated within cities, e.g. due to weather patterns or local transmission dynamics)
can bias standard errors, we clustered our standard errors by city.
We used an interrupted time series framework to examine how societal changes during COVID19 influenced park visits, compared to prior trends. The vast majority of U.S. jurisdictions
implemented some closure measures in March 2020 and some reopening measures in May
2020.28 No U.S. city was COVID-free by the end of November 2020. While the specific timing of
closures had only modest effects on population mobility,29 changes in daily activity patterns
roughly tracked the timing of different policy measures. Conceptually, we hypothesized that
COVID-related effects would function as shocks that changed the level of visits without
changing the month-to-month slope, which otherwise would be governed by seasonal trends.
We tested the impact of three sets of exposures: (1) all COVID-related effects, as measured by
a binary indicator that switched on from March 2020 through November 2020; (2) separate
closure-related effects (March-April 2020) and reopening effects (May-November 2020), using
binary indicators; and (3) the moderating effect of racial privilege on parks access, as measured
by the interaction of the closure and reopening indicators with a continuous variable
representing the proportion of residents in the service area population of each park who were
White (Hispanic or non-Hispanic). We did not observe closures or reopenings of specific parks
in our sample, but rather assigned indicators for closure and reopening time periods based on

the national trends in public policy and population mobility that prior work has identified. We
used likelihood ratio tests to assess the change in fit as we added terms to each model.
We recalculated the first model (i.e., COVID-related effects) separately for each city to
characterize city-level variation. We also recalculated the second model (i.e., closure vs.
reopening effects without moderation) using comparator location visits as the outcome variable.
All input parameters were the same except for model weights, which were used to give equal
weight to each amenity category (i.e., gyms, places of worship, libraries, transit stations), since
these categories varied widely in the number of points of interest available in the SafeGraph
data.
Results
Of the 19,115 parks in the Trust for Public Land database that fell within city boundaries, 5,630
(29%) matched a park in the SafeGraph data. Table 1 displays the sample characteristics.
Matched parks displayed higher acreage and served a larger population that comprised a larger
proportion of White residents compared to all parks within city boundaries. The proportion of
older residents and low-income households in the service area for matched parks were similar
to those of other city parks.
Figure 1 depicts trends in park visits after accounting for sampling probability, changes in the
size of the SafeGraph panel, and between-year differences in visit recording. When we
examined the effects of COVID-19 from March through November, we found a 14.6% reduction
in park visits (95% CI [9.2, 19.7], p < 0.001) compared to prior trends. Table 2. Most cities
displayed point-estimated reductions between 10% and 30%, as displayed in Supplemental
Figure 1.
When we segmented the COVID-related effects in the full sample, we found a 35.7% reduction
associated with closures (95% CI [33.5, 37.8], p < 0.001) and an 8.0% reduction associated with
reopenings (95% CI [1.9, 13.7], p = 0.001). This modification improved the model fit (p < 0.001).
Figure 2 compares trends in park visits to other public amenities. In our models, visits to
comparator locations declined by a slightly larger margin during closures than park visits did
(43.1% reduction, 95% CI [41.5, 44.7], p < 0.001), but unlike park visits, they displayed virtually
no increase in visits during reopenings compared to prior years (41.8% reduction, 95% CI [38.7,
44.8], p < 0.001). See Table 2.
Figure 3 compares trends in visits at parks serving majority-POC and majority-White
populations. In the model that tested the moderating effect of White population served, we found
that White population did not moderate closure effects but moderated reopening effects
considerably. A 1-unit change in the moderator (i.e., from a 0% White to a 100% White service
area) was associated with 42.7% greater park visits (95% CI [22.3, 66.6], p < 0.001) postreopening. See Table 2. Consequently, at the highest levels of White population served, the

model estimated that visits in the reopening period were greater than in the same time period in
prior years. Supplemental figure 2 displays these marginal effects. The moderated exposure
model improved fit compared to the previous model (p < 0.001).

Discussion
Using data from a large sample of city parks in major U.S. cities, we found that total park use
during COVID-19 was lower than the levels observed in 2018 and 2019. It appears that this
reduction was larger during the months in which most public spaces were closed; after
jurisdictions began reopening, the reduction in park visits was statistically significant but fairly
modest. This pattern contrasted with visits to other public amenities, which did not rebound
substantially after jurisdictions began reopening. However, for parks, the effect of reopening
varied substantially according to the racial composition of the population living within walking
distance. Where the proportion of White residents was higher, reopening entailed a larger
rebound in park visits, including an overall increase in visits, compared to 2018 and 2019, in
predominantly White service areas.
These findings highlight, first, the valuable function that city parks occupied during the COVID19 pandemic. During a period when other public amenities were underutilized and population
mobility declined substantially, city park use was reasonably steady following the March-April
drops. Despite parks’ apparent value to city residents, the economic fallout caused by the
pandemic poses fundamental challenges to city parks departments: in 2020, 38% of U.S.
mayors reported that they expect “dramatic financial cuts” to parks and recreation budgets in
their cities because the fiscal crisis forces cities to cut spending.30
Second, our analysis suggests that structural racial inequities shaped city residents’ ability to
visit parks during COVID-19. During a period when parks represented comparatively safe
venues for exercise, recreation, and outdoor gatherings, parks that served predominantly White
populations were well-utilized compared to their baseline levels. This finding is consistent with
media reports on high rates of park use during COVID-19, potentially underscoring how media
narratives center White experiences.1,31
By contrast, we found a relatively small rebound in park visits, after initial closures, in parks
serving a larger proportion of residents of color. Our study design does not enable us to
evaluate the possible causes of these patterns. Possible causes include disparities in COVID-19
infection and mortality, disparities in perceived risk to self or others, disparities in economic
distress, or disparities in access to parks. Moreover, 2020 was marked with highly visible
instances of interpersonal and structural racism, including the police killings of Breonna Taylor,
George Floyd, and other unarmed Black people, which might have influenced how residents of
color perceived their safety in public spaces, including parks. These questions are important

topics for future research and for local policymakers.
Finally, we demonstrated the utility of smartphone mobility data for tracking time trends in city
park use. This application of a novel data source addresses a major gap for city officials,
researchers, and other stakeholders attempting to monitor park use over time. This approach
enabled us to assess time trends across dozens of cities, with high temporal resolution, using a
sample of parks that was hundreds of times larger than traditional observational methods have
used. We have made the longitudinal trends from a subset of cities in this sample available at
[LINK]. More granularized methods, which others have advanced,32 could potentially allow local
actors to estimate actual park visits in close to real time, enhancing their ability to identify
barriers to access and evaluate program effectiveness. Moreover, SafeGraph has provided
these data to researchers and public officials at no cost; even at standard pricing, the data
would likely remain highly cost-effective compared to in-person data collection.
Limitations
SafeGraph park use data have not been validated against traditional data sources for park use,
such as systematic observation. However, prior work has shown that SafeGraph park use data
track closely with Google Community Mobility Reports for park use, which are derived from
smartphone locations using different data collection methods.23 SafeGraph device visits are
difficult to interpret in terms of real-world visitors, particularly after adjusting for changes in the
size of the SafeGraph panel. Therefore, our analyses here focus solely on time trends. In other
words, we do not attempt to compare the absolute levels of park use by population served, but
only how the time trends differed according to population served.
Moreover, we were not able to assess the manner in which city parks were used, or the
characteristics of the persons using them. Because we could not observe directly the
racial/ethnic identity of park users, we assigned these characteristics at the park level based on
the demographics of the population living within a 0.5 mile walk. Park users might travel
substantially farther than this distance,33 but prior work also suggests that park users are likely
to seek out venues in neighborhoods where the demographic composition is comparable to their
own.34 Therefore, we considered nearby demographics to be a suitable proxy for park user
characteristics. Still, as noted above, we do not draw conclusions about the precise cause of our
findings relating to the use of majority-White serving parks, which could conceivably include
people of color choosing more often to visit parks in majority-White areas (though we have not
found evidence to support this proposition). Future research could examine this question.
Moreover, since our racial composition indicators did not include mutually exclusive
Hispanic/non-Hispanic categories, we were unable to disaggregate how effects varied
depending on White Hispanic and White non-Hispanic populations served.
While we have treated COVID-19-related changes as the exposures in this study, we are unable
to assess which causal mechanisms related to COVID-19 may explain the patterns we have

observed. We refer to “closure” and “reopening” periods based on the general trends in public
policy and population mobility that occurred during certain monthly of 2020, rather than policies
that closed or reopened specific parks in our sample, which we did not observe. Future work
could extend our methodology to distinguish among the effects on park use from differences in
state and local policy, parks characteristics, COVID transmission patterns, and other possible
influences.
Conclusions
The COVID-19 pandemic sharpened focus on city parks as important public resources.
However, cities lack adequate tools to monitor and evaluate the use of parks. Our analysis
shows that, despite some limitations, smartphone data can be used to learn how park use
varies over time and between geographies, and how changes in park visits compare to visits to
other amenities. Finally, the data can help identify racial inequities in park access.
As cities are grappling with fiscal challenges in the wake of the pandemic and the subsequent
economic fall-out, they need to make difficult decisions regarding allocation of resources. The
approach to studying park use developed in this study can contribute to the discussions and
decisions about investments in parks. Efforts to enhance community participation,35,36 secure
sustainable funding streams,37,38 and monitor equity39 can assist in this endeavor.
In 2020, many cities also began to reckon more deeply with longstanding racial injustice. This
study has also demonstrated how cell phone data can be used to identify racial disparities in
park use and park access. Additional research is needed to identify the sources and
consequences of racial inequities in park visits. While we propose methods that may enable
cities to quantify changes in park utilization over time, participatory and qualitative methods are
necessary to investigate the causes and chart the path forward. In combination, these strategies
could make city parks programming and other parks investments more effective, efficient, and
equitable.

*Beta coefficients expressed as percent change in visits rate. Log-linear OLS model also included fixed effects
for calendar months and calendar years. Models were weighted by inverse sampling probability. Standard
errors are clustered by city. Control location visits were modeled separately from park visits, using the same
specifications except for the sampling weights, which were selected to assign equal weight to each category of
amenity (gyms, places of worship, libraries, transit stations).
