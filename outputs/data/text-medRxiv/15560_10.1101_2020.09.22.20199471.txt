Abstract

2
3

In COVID-19, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases have emerged as major risk

4

factors for critical disease progression. Concurrently, the impact of the main anti-

5

hypertensive therapies, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and

6

angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), on COVID-19 severity is controversially

7

discussed. By combining clinical data, single-cell sequencing data of airway samples

8

and in vitro experiments, we assessed the cellular and pathophysiological changes in

9

COVID-19 driven by cardiovascular disease and its treatment options. Anti-

10

hypertensive ACEi or ARB therapy, was not associated with an altered expression of

11

SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells and thus

12

presumably does not change susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, we

13

observed a more critical progress in COVID-19 patients with hypertension associated

14

with a distinct inflammatory predisposition of immune cells. While ACEi treatment was

15

associated with dampened COVID-19-related hyperinflammation and intrinsic anti-viral

16

responses, under ARB treatment enhanced epithelial-immune cell interactions were

17

observed. Macrophages and neutrophils of COVID-19 patients with hypertension and

18

cardiovascular comorbidities, in particular under ARB treatment, exhibited higher

19

expression of CCL3, CCL4, and its receptor CCR1, which associated with critical

20

COVID-19 progression. Overall, these results provide a potential explanation for the

21

adverse COVID-19 course in patients with cardiovascular disease, i.e. an augmented

22

immune response in critical cells for the disease course, and might suggest a beneficial

23

effect of clinical ACEi treatment in hypertensive COVID-19 patients.

Introduction

2

The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the severe

3

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Among patients hospitalized

4

for COVID-19 males and those of older age emerged as having a higher risk for critical

5

COVID-191, 2. Hypertension, highly prevalent in adults worldwide3, has been identified

6

as a major risk factor for COVID-19 severity4, 5. Hypertensive COVID-19 patients are

7

more likely to develop severe pneumonia or organ damage than non-hypertensive

8

patients. In addition, these patients exhibit exacerbated inflammatory responses and

9

have a higher risk of dying from COVID-19 than non-hypertensive patients4, 6.

10

SARS-CoV-2 exploits the ACE2 receptor, expressed on epithelial cells in the

11

respiratory system, for cellular attachment and entry7. ACE2 is a membrane-bound

12

aminopeptidase and is part of the non-canonical arm of the renin-angiotensin-

13

aldosterone system (RAAS), which regulates blood pressure homeostasis and

14

vascular repair responses. It has been speculated that antihypertensive treatment by

15

angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers

16

(ARBs) might modulate ACE2 expression and thereby alter susceptibility for SARS-

17

CoV-2 infection. In the classical RAAS pathway, angiotensin II binds to the

18

angiotensin-II-receptor-subtyp-1 (AT1R), which promotes vasoconstriction and pro-

19

inflammation. ACE2, on the other hand, cleaves angiotensin II into angiotensin 1-7,

20

which mediates vasodilatatory and anti-inflammatory effects8, 9.

21

Data from animal studies demonstrated that ACEi and ARB can up-regulate ACE2

22

expression10. This raised intense discussions on a potential increase in availability of

23

SARS-CoV-2 receptors in ACEi or ARB treated patients11,

24

potentially more susceptibility to viral infection and spread. To date there is no

25

evidence from observational studies that ACEi- or ARB-treatment could increase the

26

infectivity for SARS-CoV-25, 13.

Hypertension is associated with the activation of inflammatory processes14, 15. As a

2

hyperinflammatory phenotype in the respiratory system has been described to

3

enhance severity of COVID-1916, 17, we assessed whether a potential pro-inflammatory

4

predisposition of hypertensive patients before SARS-CoV-2 infection may contribute

5

to an exacerbated disease severity.

6

To this end we evaluated the impact of coexisting cardiovascular illnesses, in particular

7

of hypertension and anti-hypertensive treatment, on COVID-19 pathology and viral

8

clearance based on two German prospective cohorts. By analyzing the single-cell

9

transcriptome landscape of the airways of COVID-19 patients and SARS-CoV-2

10

negative controls we provide insights into the differential COVID-19 pathology in

11

ACEi/ARB-treated patients compared to those without cardiovascular diseases or

12

different anti-hypertensive treatment.

Results

15

ACEi/ARB treatment was associated with a lower hypertension-related risk for

16

critical COVID-19

17

We first assessed the impact of hypertension (HT+) and other cardiovascular diseases

18

(CVD+) with anti-hypertensive treatment on COVID-19 severity (Figure 1a). Both

19

medical conditions have been associated with a worse outcome in COVID-195, 11-13, 18-

20

20

21

COVID-19 in the different patient groups of the Pa-COVID-19 cohort21 (see

22

Supplementary Table 1 for clinical characteristics). The proportion of patients with a

23

critical outcome was significantly increased for HT+/CVD± patients (n=90) compared

24

to HT-/CVD- COVID-19 patients (n=54, p-value=0.007). For HT+ patients, the risk for

25

critical COVID-19 was highest without ACEi- or ARB-treatment (see Supplementary

26

Table 2): almost 75% of HT+/CDV-patients and about two thirds of HT+/CVD+ patients

. Accordingly, we compared the proportion of critical cases to all other severities of

showed critical COVID-19. In contrast, ACEi- and ARB-treatment were associated with

2

a decreased proportion of critical COVID-19 in both groups (HT+/CVD- and

3

HT+CVD+), but ACEi treatment showed a more profound difference as compared to

4

ARB treatment. ACEi treated HT+/CVD± patients showed almost the same risk for

5

critical COVID-19 as HT-/CVD- patients (Supplementary Table 2).

6

To exclude the impact of other risk factors for an adverse COVID-19 clinical course,

7

we performed logistic regression analyses adjusted for known confounding factors

8

such as age, sex, and BMI. This analysis confirmed a higher risk for developing critical

9

COVID-19 for HT+/CVD- over HT-/CVD- (adjOR=2.38, 95%CI:1.09-5.21, p-

10

value=0.028). Even after adjustment for confounders ARB-treatment showed an

11

increased risk for critical COVID-19 (HT+/CVD- /ARB+, adjOR=3.85, 95%CI:1.01-

12

14.68, p-value=0.044), which was lower than for HT+/CVD- patients without ACEi or

13

ARB treatment (adjOR=4.94, 95%CI:1.46-16.79, p-value=0.009). The logistic

14

regression analysis revealed no significant increase for critical COVID-19 by ACEi

15

treatment compared to HT-/CVD-.

16

Our results showed that patients with hypertensive disease had an increased risk for

17

critical COVID-19. This risk was decreased by ACEi/ARB treatment. ACEi treatment

18

almost entirely abolished the additional risk, whereas ARB treatment only reduced the

19

hypertension-associated risk.

20
21

ARB but not ACEi treatment was associated with delayed SARS-CoV-2 clearance

22

We investigated the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 clearance in patients included in the

23

Pa-COVID-19 cohort. During hospitalization, COVID-19 patients were tested

24

longitudinally for SARS-CoV-2 by qPCR of the viral genome. Using an adjusted

25

repeated measurement mixed model, we studied the changes of the viral load over

26

time, comparing ACEi+ (n=21) or ARB+ (n=26) COVID-19 patients with HT-/CVD6

1

COVID-19 patients (n=46). All three groups showed the same initial viral load while

2

ACEi+ treatment did not change viral clearance up to 16 days after the first positive

3

test compared to HT-/CVD-, ARB-treatment was associated with a significantly slower

4

viral clearance over time compared to HT-/CVD- (p-value=0.031) or ACEi+ (p-value=

5

0.026, Figure 1b), respectively. This finding was supported by the time-dependent

6

slope of viral load between the different patient groups. ARB+ patients tended to have

7

a flatter slope compared to HT-/CVD- (p-value=0.07, Extended Data Figure 1a). The

8

same was observed for HT+/ CVD± patients who showed a tendency of slower viral

9

clearance compared to HT-/CVD- patients (p-value=0.08, Extended Data Figure 1b).

10

Taken together, we showed that viral clearance in HT+/CVD± patients under ACEi

11

treatment was similar to that in COVID-19 patients without a coexisting cardiovascular

12

disease, while viral clearance may have been delayed in patients undergoing

13

hypertensive ARB treatment.

14
15

Cardiovascular disease and SARS-CoV-2 infection affect cell type distribution

16

To investigate the cellular and molecular impact of cardiovascular co-morbidities and

17

anti-hypertensive treatment on COVID-19 severity, we performed extensive single-cell

18

transcriptome profiling of nasopharyngeal samples from COVID-19 patients with or

19

without hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases (see Supplementary Table 3

20

for clinical characteristics). To disentangle the effect of HT and CVD on SARS-CoV-2

21

infection, we studied a mirror cohort of SARS-CoV-2 negative patients with and without

22

HT/CVD under ARB/ACEi treatment (Figure 2a). In total, we assessed the

23

transcriptomes of 114,761 individual cells obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs of 32

24

COVID-19 patients (n=25 with HT+/CVD±; n=10 ACEi+ and n=15 ARB+) and 16

25

SARS-CoV-2-negative controls (n=10 with HT+/CVD±; n=6 ACEi+ and n=4 ARB+).

1

Only individuals diagnosed with severe to critical COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2-negative

2

controls were eligible for inclusion in this part of the study (Supplementary Table 3).

3

We identified nine immune and 12 epithelial cell populations (Figure 2b, Extended Data

4

Figure 2 and 3). While the relative abundance of the individual epithelial cell types

5

seemed largely unchanged (Extended Data Figure 3b) the immune cell population

6

upon infection was characterized by a massive increase of neutrophils (Neu, p-value

7

< 2.66e-10) and resident macrophages (rMa, p-value < 5.78e-11, Figure 2c) upon

8

infection. In HT+/CVD± COVID-19 patients, non-resident macrophages (nrMa, p-value

9

<2.10e-14) and monocyte-derived macrophages (moMa, p-value<4.83e-10) were

10

expanded compared to HT-/CVD- patients, independent of their anti-hypertensive

11

treatment (Figure 2c, Extended Data Figure 3b).

12
13

Anti-hypertensive treatment is not associated with altered expression of the

14

SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2

15

SARS-CoV-2 enters the human cell via the receptor ACE2 and with the help of the

16

protease TMPRSS2. It has been speculated that ARB and ACEi as RAAS-modulating

17

agents might change ACE2 expression and thereby the infectivity for SARS-CoV-2.

18

Since the expression of ACE2 is generally low in human airways22, we quantified total

19

ACE2 expression per sample. In line with previous studies23, 24, we found an overall

20

increased expression of both ACE2 (p=0.0025, Extended Data Figure 4a) and

21

TMPRSS2 (p-value= 0.0002, Extended Data Figure 4b) upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.

22

However, anti-hypertensive treatment did not alter ACE2 expression, neither in SARS-

23

CoV-2-positive nor -negative patients.

24

We conclude that entry factor expression did not predispose ACEi or ARB treated

25

patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This finding is in accordance with observational

4

ARB-treated COVID-19 patients have a reduced cell-intrinsic anti-viral response

5

We next assessed potential molecular mechanisms that may be involved in the

6

delayed viral clearance of ARB-treated patients within the Pa-COVID-19 cohort

7

described above. Pathway enrichment analysis based on the top 100 genes that were

8

significantly differentially expressed (log fold-change > 0.25, FDR < 0.05, expression

9

in > 10% of cells in one group) in either of the anti-hypertensive treatment groups

10

compared to the HT-/CVD- group showed an activation of genes involved in stress and

11

inflammatory response and antigen processing in ciliated cells of ARB+/HT+/CVD±

12

COVID-19 patients (Figure 3a, Extended Data Figure 5a, Supplementary Table 4). For

13

ACEi+/HT+/CVD± COVID-19 patients’ pathways related to defense response and

14

regulation of viral genome replication were enriched in ciliated cells. Among those

15

genes involved in regulation of viral genome replication, we found a number of

16

statistically significantly upregulated type I interferon (IFN)-induced genes (e.g., IFI6,

17

IFI27, ISG15; Figure 3a-b) in both treatment groups.

18

In secretory cells, ACEi treatment resulted in upregulation of genes negatively

19

regulating immune system response to virus. Interestingly, ARB treatment led to a

20

strong induction of genes involved in chemotaxis and inflammatory response in

21

secretory cells (Figure 3a, Extended Data Figure 5a, Supplementary Table 4),

22

including CXCL1, CXCL6, and IL-8, which recruit and activate neutrophils, and

23

CXCL17 which is a chemoattractant for monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells

24

(Figure 3a,c).

25

Next, we sought to disentangle cell-intrinsic responses triggered by viral infection and

26

cell-extrinsic responses induced by signaling through type I/III IFNs. In an in vitro

setting using A549 cells, we studied the extrinsic and intrinsic transcriptional response

2

supposedly induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cells were stimulated by either a highly

3

specific RIG-I ligand triggering prototypical antiviral signaling through IRF3 or by a

4

combination of IFNb and INFl inducing prototypical IFN signaling through ISGF3

5

(Figure 3d). Although the major pattern recognition receptor for SARS-CoV-2 remains

6

elusive, all potential antiviral pathways converged on the transcription factors

7

IRF3/IRF7 and NFkB25, eliciting a similar transcriptional response (Supplementary

8

Table 4).

9

By overlapping the specific intrinsic and extrinsic antiviral response gene sets identified

10

in the in vitro experiment with the differentially expressed genes in secretory and

11

ciliated cells of COVID-19 patients (for enrichment see Methods), we observed that

12

overall ACEi but not ARB treatment was associated with a strong cell intrinsic anti-viral

13

response in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (Figure 3e-f). Of note, already in SARS-

14

CoV-2-negative patients, anti-hypertensive treatment by ACEi/ARB led to the induction

15

of genes involved in the cell-intrinsic antiviral response in secretory but not in ciliated

16

cells (Figure 3e-f). In secretory cells, pre-activation of the intrinsic antiviral response

17

was further enhanced by ACEi-treatment of HT+/CVD± COVID-19 patients (Figure 3e).

18

Surprisingly, intrinsic viral response was abolished in ARB+ treated HT+/CVD±

19

COVID-19 patients. Extrinsic antiviral response genes were not pre-activated in SARS-

20

CoV-2-negative patients treated by ACEi or ARBs. Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, a

21

robust extrinsic antiviral response was induced in both ciliated and secretory cells of

22

HT+/CVD± COVID-19 patients treated by ACEi or ARBs (Figure 3e-f). A transcription

23

factor binding motif analysis for genes differentially regulated in secretory cells

24

confirmed the notion that the classical cell-intrinsic antiviral signaling through

25

transcription factors such as IRF3, IRF1, and ISGF3 (ISRE) was enriched in ACEi+

26

treated HT+/CVD± COVID-19 patients (Extended Data Figure 5b). Instead, ARB+

treated patients showed a strong bias towards genes controlled by NFkB, a hallmark

2

transcription factor for inflammatory conditions26-28.

3

Taken together, we observed a distinct difference in the balance between cell-intrinsic

4

and extrinsic antiviral responses of ARB vs. ACEi treatment of HT+/CVD± COVID-19

5

patients. The identified dampened intrinsic antiviral response in secretory and ciliated

6

cells of ARB-treated HT+/CVD± COVID-19 patients may have contributed to the above

7

described delay in SARS-CoV-2 clearance in those patients.

9

Crosstalk between epithelial and immune cells is associated with anti-

10

hypertensive treatment in COVID-19 patients

11

The above described differential gene expression by ACEi/ARB revealed a distinct

12

induction of inflammatory and chemoattractant genes. Hence, we inferred all possible

13

intercellular interactions of all cell types and states across the different conditions using

14

CellPhoneDB29 (Figure 4). Basal, secretory, ciliated, non-resident macrophages

15

(nrMa), resident macrophages (rMa), neutrophils (Neu), and cytotoxic T cells (CTLs)

16

had the highest number of interactions within the nasopharyngeal mucosa of COVID-

17

19 patients (Figure 4a-b). A pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidity correlated with an

18

increased number of cell-cell interactions with most of the previously mentioned cell

19

types, gaining about 500 additional interactions upon SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure

20

4a, Extended Data Figure 6a).

21

In SARS-CoV-2 negative patients, interactions in ACEi+ and ARB+ were very similar

22

in number and type (Extended Data Figure 6a-b). In contrast, for COVID-19 patients,

23

ACEi treatment was concomitant with a reduction of interactions, while interactions in

24

ARB treatment remained almost unchanged compared to HT+/CVD± patients.

compartment interactions (Extended Data Figure 6c). In general, regardless of SARS-

2

CoV-2 infection status, epithelial cells exhibited more potential interactions with

3

themselves while immune cells had more inter-compartment interactions with epithelial

4

cells. When comparing interactions in SARS-CoV-2-negative and -positive patients,

5

we generally observed a loss of intra-compartment interactions for epithelial cells and

6

a gain in inter-compartment interactions with immune cells among all conditions. Both

7

inter- and intra-compartment interactions of immune cells tended to be increasen in

8

HT+/CVD± compared to HT-/CVD- COVID-19 patients (Extended Data Figure 6c,

9

Supplementary Table 5). Accordingly, intra-compartment interactions upon SARS-

10

CoV-2 infection were exclusively statistically significantly increased in immune cell

11

types, but decreased in epithelial cells (Supplementary Table 5).

12

Notably, this finding was mostly impacted by ARB-treated patients showing an overall

increase in immune cell interactions, while ACEi-treated patients were similar to HT-

14

/CVD- COVID-19 patients (Extended Data Figure 6c; Supplementary Table 5). In

15

particular chemokine/chemokine receptor interactions mediated by nrMa (Figure 4c)

patients.

interaction pattern, while in ACEi+ there was a reduced enrichment of interactions

19

between CCL3/CCL4 and CCR5, and between CCR5 and CCL7, respectively (Figure

20

4c). In line with the pronounced chemokine/chemokine receptor interaction, the

21

expression of CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL7, and CCL18 was upregulated in ARB+

22

concomitant with the expression of their receptors, e.g., CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5,

23

suggesting a higher interactivity of nrMa under ARB compared to ACEi treatment

(Extended Data Figure 6d).

Hypertension-related inflammatory priming of immune cells is less pronounced

2

in ACEi treated patients

3

To elucidate the deleterious contribution of hypertension on COVID-19, we evaluated

4

the transcriptional profile of the key immune cell types orchestrating the antiviral

5

response, namely T-cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. We and others showed that

6

macrophages, in particular nrMa, are key mediators of hyperinflammation in severe

7

COVID-19. High expression of genes coding for immune cell-recruiting chemokines,

8

such

9

IL1B and IL8, are hallmarks of nrMa in COVID-1916, 17. Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection,

10

HT+/CVD± patients showed a significantly increased expression of these inflammatory

11

mediators not only in macrophages but also in Neu compared to HT-/CVD- patients

12

(Figure 5a, Extended Data Figure 7a). This hyperinflammatory phenotype was not only

13

present in the upper airways but also in bronchial lavage (BL), as reflected by a

14

stronger activation of BL-nrMa and BL-Neu of a hypertensive COVID-19 patient (BIH-

15

SCV2-30) compared to a HT-/CVD- patient (BIH-SCV2-25, Extended Data Figure 7c).

16

Anti-hypertensive treatment by ACEi apparently decreased hypertension-related

17

hyperinflammation of COVID-19, while ARB was less effective in this regard (Figure

18

5a-c, Extended Data Figure 7b). In all macrophage subtypes, CCL3 and CCL4

19

expression among others was elevated in HT+/CVD±/ARB+ compared to HT+/

20

CVD±/ACEi+. In line, Neu showed a pro-inflammatory characteristic (IL8, CXCL2) and

21

infiltrative potential (ITGAM, ICAM1) in ARB+ and to a much lesser extent in ACEi+,

22

when compared to HT-/CVD- patients (Figure 5c).

23

Notably, in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection HT+/CVD- and HT+/CVD+ were

24

characterized by inflammatory priming predominantly in nrMA and Neu (Figure 5a left

25

panel, Figure 5c) - but not in rMa (Extended Data Figure 7b). In contrast to what we

26

observed in COVID-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2-negative patients (HT+/CVD±/ACEi+

CCL3

and

CCL4,

1

and HT+/ CVD±/ARB+) showed a similar chemokine fingerprint as reflected by an

2

increased expression of e.g. CCL3 and CCL4 (Figure 5a right panel, Figure 5c).

3

In agreement with the previously observed aggravated cytotoxic capacity of CTLs in

4

critical COVID-19 patients16, hypertensive patients treated with ARB or ACEi

5

expressed cytotoxic mediators like PRF1 or GZMK to a larger extend than HT-/CVD-

6

patients upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 5d). As expected, in the absence of

7

SARS-CoV-2 infection, CTLs were not activated and no apparent difference between

8

HT+/CVD±/ACEi+ or HT+/CVD±/ARB+ and HT-/CVD- patients was observed (Figure

9

5d).

10

In contrast, in NKT cells cytotoxic markers (e.g. KLRD1, GZMB) in addition to

11

monocyte-attractants (e.g. CCL3, CCL4) were already significantly elevated in SARS-

12

CoV-2 negative hypertensive patients (Extended Data Figure 7a) independent of the

13

type of anti-hypertensive treatment (Figure 5d). Upon infection, only in the ARB+ group

14

apoptotic mediators (e.g. GZMB) and different chemokines (e.g. CCL3, CCL4) were

15

significantly increased compared to HT-/CVD-.

16

Overall, we observed an increased expression of genes coding for pro-inflammatory

17

and cytotoxic mediators in immune cells of hypertensive patients, already present

18

before infection. ACEi but not ARB treatment apparently alleviated the hypertension-

19

related inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

20
21

Exacerbated expression of CCL3 and CCL4 observed in ARB-treated

22

hypertensive patients correlates with disease severity

23

We next evaluated whether the hypertension-related inflammatory predisposition of

24

nrMa, and Neu might contribute to an increased risk for critical COVID-19. CCL3 and

25

CCL4 in nrMa and Neu, which were induced in HT+/CVD+/- compared to HT-/CVD-

26

(Figure 5a-c), were statistically significantly elevated with the highest fold change in

critical COVID-19 patients (n= 23 severe vs. 9 critical, cut-off: average fold change

2

≥0.25, and p-value≤0.05, Figure 5e). Using a logistic regression model considering

3

age, gender, days post onset of symptoms and study center as potential confounding

4

factors we confirmed a significant relationship between increased expression of CCL4

5

derived from either nrMa (adj.OR/95% CI=1.04/1.00-1.07, p-value=0.027) or Neu

6

(adj.OR/95% CI=1.06/1.00-1.12, p-value=0.044) and CCL3 expressed by Neu

7

(adj.OR/95% CI=1.13/1.01-1.27, p-value=0.02) and an increased risk for critical

8

COVID-19. Notably, expression of CCR1, the receptor bound by CCL3 and CCL4,

9

increased in nrMa and Neu with COVID-19 severity supporting the potential of CCR1

10

as a therapeutic target16 (Extended Data Figure 7d). Antihypertensive treatment

11

increased CCL3 and CCL4 expression in immune cells of SARS-CoV-2 negative

12

patients, but in COVID-19 only ARB-treatment significantly elevated CCL3/CCL4

13

expression compared to HT-/CVD- COVID-19 (Figure 5f).

14

In summary, we could show that treatment with ACEi resulted in a more favorable

15

immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection, while ARB therapy did not sufficiently

16

alleviate the hypertension-related hyperinflammation especially in nrMa and Neu,

17

possibly contributing to critical COVID-19 course (Figure 5g).

Discussion

21

This study identified potential novel molecular mechanisms underlying the finding from

22

observational studies that COVID-19 patients with hypertension or coronary artery

23

disease revealed higher morbidity and mortality rates4,

24

hypertensive medication includes modulators of RAAS interfering with the pathway

25

employed by SARS-CoV-2 for cellular entry it has been debated whether ACEi or ARB

1

that the hypertension-associated additional risk for critical disease progression can be

2

reduced by ARB treatment and is almost abolished by ACEi treatment. This is

3

corroborated by previous reports observing higher mortality rates in hypertensive

4

COVID-19 patients in the absence of ACEi/ARB treatment32.

5

Several clinical studies are now available comparing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity rates

6

among patients with and without ACEi/ARB treatment13, 33. Their findings support the

7

notion that testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 is not associated with treatment by

8

ACEi/ARB13, 34. In line, we observe no difference in ACE2 expression and initial viral

9

concentration between patient groups. Also, induction of ACE2 expression after SARS-

10

CoV-2-infection was not altered by ACEi/ARB treatment. However, viral clearance was

11

delayed by ARB treatment. While reduced viral clearance can be a result of defects in

12

immunity for example of an impaired T cell activity, as it has already been reported for

13

cardiovascular diseases35, our data suggest that the altered anti-viral-response of

14

ciliated and secretory epithelial cells plays a crucial role. Intrinsic anti-viral response

15

was dampened in ARB-treated patients, while patients under ACEi treatment showed

16

similar viral clearance as normotensive patients together with an elevated intrinsic

17

antiviral response.

18

We identified hypertension-associated elevated immunological activity as the

19

prominent factor contributing to the increased risk of hypertensive patients for COVID-

20

19 severity. Hypertensive patients showed an inflammatory predisposition of different

21

immune cell subtypes observed already before SARS-CoV-2 infection irrespective of

22

anti-hypertensive treatment. Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, ARB-treated patients

23

showed an exaggerated hyperinflammatory response, which was alleviated in ACEi

24

treated patients. This distinct inflammatory response of COVID-19 patients under

25

different anti-hypertensive treatment may also give rise to the here described less

26

pronounced risk reduction for disease severity under ARB compared to ACEi therapy.

Interestingly, a recent study showed enhanced plasma ACE2-activity along with a

2

significant increase in Ang(1-7) concentrations in ACEi treated COVID-19 patients

3

compared to COVID-19 patients under ARB therapy, suggesting a higher anti-

4

inflammatory capacity in ACEi compared to ARB treated COVID-1936.

5

The present study demonstrated an immune activation in hypertensive patients that is

6

largely augmented under COVID-19 and may provide a novel explanation for the

7

adverse course of the disease in these patients related to a hyperinflammatory

8

response. Our data are in line with the general guideline recommendations

9

discouraging discontinuation of ACEi or ARB treatment. On the contrary, our results

10

may suggest that ACEi could be the more beneficial antihypertensive treatment during

11

COVID-19. A randomized control trial is required to assess the clinical impact of ACEi

12

vs. ARB treatment in COVID-19 patients and several trials are under way.

Patient Recruitment and Ethics Approval

4

Patients were enrolled between March 6th and June 7th 2020 in either the prospective

5

observational cohort study Pa-COVID-1921 at Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin or

6

the SC2-study at the University Hospital Leipzig. Written informed consent was given

7

by all patients or their legal representatives. The study was approved by the respective

8

Institutional Review boards of the Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin (EA2/066/20) or

9

the University Hospital Leipzig (123/20-ek) and conducted in accordance with the

10

Declaration of Helsinki.

12

Pa-COVID-19 cohort

13

Between March–May 2020, 162 COVID-19-positive patients were recruited at Charité

14

– Universitätsmedizin Berlin in the Pa-COVID-19 study. In the here presented study,

15

we excluded those patients who had their positive SARS-CoV-2 test exclusively

16

outside the Charité (n=12) and those with missing information on ACEi/ARB treatment

17

(n=6). For the remaining 144 COVID-19 patients, we assessed differences in COVID-

18

19 severity related to pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (CVD+), such as

19

hypertension (HT+/CVD-) or HT and an additional cardiovascular disease (coronary

20

artery diseaseand/or heart failure, HT+/CVD+) in the different treatment groups

21

(ACEi+, ARB+, ACEi-/ARB-) compared to patients without HT-/CVD-. HT was defined

22

according to ESC/ESH guidelines as office blood pressure ≥ 140mm Hg systolic or ≥

23

90 mm Hg diastolic37. The characteristics of this cohort are summarized in

We collected nasopharyngeal swabs for single-cell RNA transcriptome analyses

2

(scRNA-seq) of 32 confirmed COVID-19 patients (23 males and nine females; median

3

age: 67; range: 32–91 years of age) and 16 controls without any COVID-19 related

symptoms (nine males, seven females; median age: 53; range: 24-79). Relevant

5

patient characteristics are given in Supplementary Table 3.

6

Of the COVID-19 patients, 23 patients were classified as having severe, and nine as

having critical disease according to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines38.

Hospital mortality of these patients was 1/33 (3.0%).

Baseline CVD were prevalent in 25 of the COVID-19 patients. They either suffered

10

from HT only (n=16, 64%), CVD with HT (n=7, 28%), or CVD with heart failure and HT

(n=2, 8%). Patients with HT only were classified as HT+, while all patients suffering

from HT and CVD (and possibly additionally heart failure) were classified as

13

HT+/CVD+. Concomitant treatment of HT+/CVD± included treatment with either ACEi

14

(n=10) or ARB (n=15). Seven of the COVID-19 patients had no known CVD (21.2%).

15

Note that patient BIH-SCV2-14 was included in all analysis regarding ACEi/ARB

16

treatment but not in the CVD analysis (this patient suffered from HT and heart failure).

17

Of the symptom-free SARS-CoV-2-negative patients, six had HT only (37.5%), and

18

four had additional CVD (25%). Six of these patients received ACEi (37.5%) and four

19

were treated with ARB (25%). The remaining six patients had no known CVD and

20

therefore, were neither treated with ACEi nor ARB (37.5%).

DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco, 11039) and 500 μL of 13mM DTT (AppliChem, A2948)

2

were added to each sample. Cells were released by gently pipetting the solution onto

3

the swab, followed by dipping the swab 20 times into the medium. Subsequently, the

4

samples were incubated on a thermomixer at 37°C, 500 rpm for 10 minutes, followed

5

by centrifugation at 350xG at 4°C for 5 minutes. While carefully removing the

6

supernatant, the pellet was visually examined for any traces of blood. If it contained

7

red blood cells (RBC), the pellet was resuspended in 500 μL 1x PBS (Sigma-Aldrich,

8

D8537) and 1 mL of RBC Lysis Buffer (Roche, 11814389001), incubated at 25°C for

9

10 minutes, and subsequently centrifuged at 350xG at 4°C for 5 minutes. A single cell

10

suspension was achieved by resuspending the cell pellet in 500 μL Accutase (Thermo

11

Fisher, 00-4555-56), followed by incubation at room temperature for 10 minutes with

12

gently mixing the cells after 5 minutes by pipetting. Subsequently, 500 μL DMEM/F12

13

supplemented with 10% FBS was added to the cells. After centrifugation at 350xG at

14

4°C for 5 minutes and removal of the supernatant, the cell pellet was resuspended in

15

100-500 μL 1x PBS (depending on the size of the cell pellet). Cell debris was removed

16

by using a 35 μm cell strainer (Falcon, 352235) before cell counting was performed

17

using a disposable Neubauer chamber (NanoEnTek, DHC-N01). The cell suspension

18

was loaded into the 10x Chromium Controller using the 10x Genomics Single Cell 3’

2

(Illumina, paired-end, single-indexing).

3

All samples were processed under biosafety S3 within one hour after procurement.

4

Note that samples not immediately used for library preparation were resuspended in

5

cryopreservation medium [20% FBS (Gibco, 10500), 10% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich,

6

D8418), 70% DMEM/F12] and stored at -80°C. Frozen cells were thawed quickly at

7

37°C, pelleted at 350xG at 4°C for 5 minutes, and proceeded with normal processing.

8

Single-cell datasets were processed using cellranger 3.0.1. All transcripts were aligned

9

to a customized human hg19 reference genome (10x genomics, version 3.1.0) plus

10

the

SARS-CoV-2

genome (Refseq-ID:

NC_045512) added

as

an additional

11

chromosome. Following alignment, ambient RNA was removed using SoupX39 using

12

MUC1, MUC5AC, and MUC5B as marker genes. Where ambient RNA levels seemed

13

plausible (5-15%), filtered expression matrices were used for downstream analyses.

14

Further processing was performed using Seurat 3.1.4. Genes were retained if they

15

were present in at least three cells in a sample. Cells with more than or equal to 15%

16

mitochondrial reads or less than 200 genes expressed were removed from the

17

analysis. For the number of UMIs, an upper cutoff was chosen manually per sample

18

based on outliers in a UMI counts vs. gene counts plot and was typically in the range

19

of 75,000 to 150,000. After normalizing to 10,000 reads per cell, samples were

20

integrated using stepwise CCA on smaller subsets using 90 components and 2,000

21

variable genes identified by SelectIntegrationFeatures. On the integrated dataset, PCA

22

was run using 90 principal components, followed by UMAP and clustering with a

23

resolution of 2.1, both using all components. NKT, CTL, and p-NKT cells were

24

subsetted for further analysis. Scaling, dimensional reduction by PCA and the UMAP

25

was calculated separately for this subset.

Cell types were then refined manually by assessing the expression of known cell type

2

markers. Cell types from epithelial22, 40, 41 and immune42 cell populations were identified

3

according to the expression levels of different marker genes (Extended Data Figure

(Extended Data Figure 1b) were identified by gene set enrichment analysis using

clusterProfiler version 3.12.0 and the output of “FindClusters()” function from Seurat

as input (https://yulab-smu.github.io/clusterProfiler-book/index.html)43.

8

For cell-cell interactions, which are based on the expression of known ligand-receptor

9

pairs in different identified cell types, CellPhoneDB21 version 2.1.2 was used

10

(https://github.com/Teichlab/cellphonedb). circlize 0.4.10 was used to generate the

11

circos plots to display the cell-cell interactions44.

Shifts of interactions across the different conditions were tested for significance using

13

a logistic regression based on a binomial distribution (Supplementary Table 5).

Viral load measurement

18

SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results and SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations were obtained

19

by using respiratory samples taken for routine testing and by using two different test

20

systems. First, by using an assay targeting the SARS-CoV-2 E-gene as published

21

before47 and the Roche LC480 instrument. Second, by using the cobas® SARS-CoV-

22

2 test on the cobas® 6800/ 8800 system. In cases of the LC480 system, RNA was

23

extracted by using the MagNA Pure 96 DNA and Viral NA Small Volume Kit on a Roche

24

MagNA Pure 96 system. We quantified SARS-CoV-2 RNA by applying external

calibration curves and quantified in vitro transcribed RNA, derived from the E-gene

Viral load assessment by regression analysis

5

Data on positive viral mRNA measurements were available for 144 patients of the Pa-

6

COVID-19 cohort. To smooth the longitudinal viral mRNA data of each patient, the

7

values were binned in three-day intervals with respect to the time of the first test result.

8

The maximal value in each bin was considered. In case a patient had a negative test

9

for SARS-CoV-2 between two positive measurements, the negative result was

10

disregarded. Patients for which only one negative test result was available or had

11

missing confounder information were excluded from the analysis. A linear repeated

12

measurement mixed model assuming a heterogeneous first-order autoregressive

13

structure of the covariance matrix was applied considering ACEi or ARB treatment in

14

measurements up to the fifths consecutive viral test were included in the model that

Identification of RIG-I and type I/III interferon responsive gene sets

5

A549 cells were electrotransfected with 400bp long in vitro transcribed dsRNA48 and

6

lysed at 2, 4, 6, 8, 16 and 24h after transfection, or mock electrotransfected and lysed

7

at 2 and 24h. Alternatively, A549 cells were treated with a mix of 100 IU/ml interferon

8

beta (8499-IF-010/CF, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and 2.5 ng/ml interferon

9

lamba-1 (300-02L-100, Peprotech, Hamburg, Germany) for 2, 8 or 24h and then lysed.

10

Total RNA was extracted from cell lysates using the NucleoSpin RNA Plus kit

11

(Macherey Nagel, Düren, Germany) and the RNA was subjected to microarray

12

analyses using the Illumina Human HT-12 Expression Beadchip platform at the

13

genomic and proteomics core facility at DKFZ. Expression data was quantile

14

normalized, genes with no significant expression at any condition / time point were

15

excluded and gene regulation at different treatment time points vs. the 0h control was

16

determined using the limma package (Bioconductor). Data were then filtered according

17

to the following criteria to define gene sets.

18

The gene set “Cell-intrinsic antiviral (RIG-I-like receptor, RLR) signaling” comprises

19

genes that were exclusively or predominantly upregulated upon dsRNA transfection

20

(RLR stimulation) but not upon IFN treatment; while for the sake of specificity a very

21

specific RIG-I stimulation was applied, the transcriptional response likely is similar for

22

any antiviral stimulus (e.g. through MDA5, STING, TLRs) that activates the IRF3

23

transcription factor. The Cut-offs were as follows: maximum (at any time point) log2-

24

fold change in dsRNA transfected samples (maxLog2FC-RNA) > 2.0 and maximum

25

log2-fold change in IFN treated samples (maxLog2FC-IFN) <1.0; genes were excluded

26

as electrotransfection artifacts if maximum log2-fold change in mock transfection

1

(maxLog2FC-mock) > 0.5*(maxLog2FC-RNA – maxLog2FC-IFN) (11 genes). This

2

procedure yielded a list of 238 genes, comprising expected genes such as the IRF3-

3

dependent type I and III IFN genes themselves (IFNB1, IFNL1,2,3) and classical NFkB

4

targets such as TNFAIP3 (previously A20) and the IkB genes NFKBIA, NFKBIB,

5

NFKBIZ.

6

The gene set “Extrinsic / paracrine type I / III IFN signaling” comprises genes that were

7

strongly upregulated by extrinsic IFN beta / IFN lambda treatment while less so by cell-

8

intrinsic RLR induction. Note that the majority of IFN-induced genes were upregulated

9

by RLR signaling as well, putatively due to the above noted IFN production upon RLR

10

stimulation. We enriched this gene set for genes with a bias towards IFN and against

11

RLR signaling by applying the below described filters. Notably, a few genes, such as

12

LY6E, described to possess antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-249, were induced

13

only upon IFN treatment but not at all by RLR signaling. In general, we found less

14

profound gene induction in IFN-treated than in dsRNA transfected conditions, likely

15

due to the moderate dose of IFN used; we therefore used less stringent cut-offs for this

16

gene set: maxLog2FC-IFN > 0.8 and (maxLog2FC-IFN - maxLog2FC-RNA) > -0.5.

17

The latter filter removed roughly 50% of the genes, selecting for those with a relative

18

bias of IFN-treatment over dsRNA transfection. Filtering yielded 95 genes, including

19

many of the well-known ISGF3-driven IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), including the MX-

20

family genes, IFIT1, IFITM2/3 and ISG15.

2

as hypergeometric tail probabilities. Differences in CPM were calculated using an

3

ANOVA followed by Tukey's honest significance of differences test after assessing

4

homoskedasticity using Bartlett's test. When multiple tests were performed, p-values

5

were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Total CPM values were

6

extracted from the filtered and raw matrices output by CellRanger. Motif enrichment p-

7

values were calculated using HOMER 4.10.050. To analyze the potential contribution

8

of HT/CVD and its treatment on COVID-19 severity in the PaCOVID-19 cohort we

9

conducted chi-square tests with Yates’ correction and logistic regression models

10

adjusted for gender, BMI smoking and insulin treatment. Age showed collinearity with

11

ACEi or ARB treatment. Therefore, age was omitted as a confounder in models where

12

ACEi or ARB treatment was used as an independent variable. Viral clearance was

13

assessed based on similarly adjusted linear regression models as described above.

(a) Comparison of COVID-19 severity based on WHO-classification in patients without

9

cardiovascular comorbidities (HT-/CVD-, n=54) and those with arterial hypertension

10

and cardiovascular disease (HT+/CVD±, n=90). CVD patients were separated in those

11

with HT only (HT+/CVD-, n=63) and those with additional cardiovascular diseases

12

(HT+/CVD+, n=27) and are depicted dependent on their treatment with ARB (ARB+),

13

ACEi (ACEi+) or other medications (ACEi-/ARB-). *p-value <0.05 based on a Yates-

14

corrected chi-square comparison of critical vs. all other WHO categories. (b) Viral

15

clearance over time shown for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients without a pre-existing

16

cardiovascular disease (CVD-/HT-, n=46) in comparison to ARB+ (n=25) or ACEi+

17

(n=21) HT+/CVD± COVID-19 patients. Depicted are mean +/- SD of qPCR data binned

18

in 3-day intervals, only the maximal value of each patient in this interval was

19

considered. Adjusted regression analysis (confounder: BMI, gender, smoking, insulin-

20

treatment, days post onset of symptoms, n=92) showed a significantly higher viral load

21

for ARB+/ HT+/CVD±, compared to ACEi+/ HT+/CVD± and HT-/CVD- patients.

(SARS-CoV-2-/+) = 6/15) compared to HT-/CVD- patients (n (SARS-CoV-2-/+) =

6

hypertensive patients treated either with ARB+ (n (SARS-CoV-2-/+) = 4/15),

7

or ACEi+ (n (SARS-CoV-2-/+) = 6/10) in comparison to HT-/CVD- patients (n (SARS-

SARS-CoV-2 negative (n=11 Neu, n=13 nrMa), severe COVID-19 (n=23), and critical

COVID-19 patients (n=9). (f) Dot plots show average gene expression level of the

11

MIP-1 encoding genes CCL3 and CCL4 across all immune cell types comparing

12

ACEi+ and ARB+. (g) Left panel illustrates the immune cell priming of SARS-CoV-2

13

negative patients towards a pre-inflamed phenotype by HT independent of an ACEi or

14

ARB treatment. Listed are all genes that are upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 negative

15

patients with HT+, HT+/CVD+, ACEi+, and ARB+ in comparison to HT-/CVD-. As

16

depicted in the right panel, upon infection, these genes are less activated during the

17

anti-viral immune response against SARS-CoV-2 in ACEi+ (n=10) compared to ARB+

18

(n=15) treated patients. Shown are all pre-activated genes that are up-regulated in

19

ARB+ (dark blue colored genes) and ACEi+ (light blue colored genes) compared to

20

ACEi and ARB+, respectively. Black genes are not differentially expressed between

21

ARB+ vs. ACEi+ treatment. The hypertension related exacerbated expression

22

of CCL3, CCL4, and their receptor CCR1 in Neu, and of CCL4 in nrMa is associated

23

with an increased risk for a critical clinical course of COVID-19 (genes depicted in dark

Extended Data Figure 2: Cell type characteristics of the scRNAseq cohort.
(a) Dotplot depicting marker genes used to identify immune cell types. (b) Dotplot
depicting marker genes of epithelial cell types. For dotplots, expression levels are
color-coded and the percentage of cells expressing a respective gene is size-coded.
(c) GO-term enrichment for differentially expressed genes in the ciliated and squamous
ViralResp cell cluster. Number of genes observed per term are depicted, colour
indicates adjusted p-values.

Extended Data Figure 3: Cell type distribution in the scRNA-seq cohort.
(a) UMAPs depicting distribution of cell types and states in SARS-CoV-2 negative and
positive patients. UMAPs are presented separately for controls (HT-/CVD-), patients
with a pre-existing cardiac disease (HT+/CVD±) and the treatment thereof (ACEi+ and
ARB+, respectively). Pct. Exp. = percentage of cells expressing the gene; Rel. Exp. =
relative gene expression. (b) Distribution of immune and epithelial cell types/states in
SARS-CoV-2 negative and positive patients separated by HT-/CVD-, HT+/CVD± or
ARB/ACEi-treatment. Given are percentages related to the total number of immune or
epithelial cells respectively. *sign. compared to HT-/CVD-, #sign. compared to SARSCoV-2 neg.

Extended Data Figure 4: ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression.
Violin plots showing the total ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression per sample in counts
per million, split by treatment and infection group. Tukey’s p-values for individual
comparisons are shown. The patient numbers for the different sets were: SARS-CoV2- HT-/CVD-: 6; SARS-CoV-2- ACEi+: 6; SARS-CoV-2- ARB+: 4; SARS-CoV-2+ HT/CVD-: 8; SARS-CoV-2+ ACEi+: 10; SARS-CoV-2+ ARB+: 15.

Extended Data Figure 5: Pathway and transcription factor binding motif
enrichment analysis.
(a) Pathway enrichment analysis of gene sets (compare Figure 3a) specific to the
condition indicated to the right of each panel in ciliated (two upper panels) and
secretory cells (two lower panels) in COVID-19 patients. (b) Heatmap showing the pvalues of a motif-enrichment analysis for the gene sets upregulated in secretory cells
of ACEi+ or ARB+ vs. HT-/CVD- COVID-19 patients. Linear p-values are indicated as
labels, log10 p-values are used for color-coding. The patient numbers for deriving the
different sets were: SARS-CoV-2+ HT-/CVD-: 8; SARS-CoV-2+ ACEi+: 10; SARSCoV-2+ ARB+: 15.

per cell type categorized as inter-/intra-compartment interactions for SARS-CoV-2
positive and negative cohorts. Log2 scaling of the number of identified interactions. (d)
Dotplot showing the expression profile of the different immune modulatory factors by
the highly interactive cells. Expression levels are color coded; the percentage of cells
expressing the respective gene is size coded. Significantly altered expression
(Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted two-tailed, negative-binomial P < 0.05) in ACEi+
versus HT-/CVD- (circles around ACEi+) and ARB+ versus HT-/CVD- (circles around
ARB+) is marked by a red circle. Ave. Exp. = average expression, Pct. Exp. =
percentage of cells expressing the gene. The patient numbers for deriving the different
sets were: SARS-CoV-2- HT-/CVD-: 6; SARS-CoV-2- ACEi+: 6; SARS-CoV-2- ARB+:
4; SARS-CoV-2- HT+/CVD±: 10; SARS-CoV-2+ HT-/CVD-: 7; SARS-CoV-2+ ACEi+:
10; SARS-CoV-2+ ARB+: 15; SARS-CoV-2+ HT+/CVD±: 25.

Extended Data Figure 7: Altered immune response in COVID-19 by ACEi/ARB
treatment in relation to disease severity.
(a) Dotplot depicts significant gene expression changes of pro-inflammatory mediators,
and receptors in rMa, Neu, and NKT of hypertensive patients with (HT+/CVD+, n
(SARS-CoV-2-/+) = 4/4) or without an additional CVD (HT+/CVD-, n (SARS-CoV-2-/+)
= 6/6) compared to HT-/CVD- patients (n (SARS-CoV-2-/+) = 6/6). Red circles indicate
Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted two-tailed negative binominal p-value<0.05. Samples
with no contributing cells per cell type were excluded from analysis. (b) Alterations of
gene expression in rMa of hypertensive patients treated either with ARB+ (n (SARSCoV-2-/+) = 4/15), or ACEi+ (n (SARS-CoV-2-/+) = 6/10) in comparison to HT-/CVDpatients (n (SARS-CoV-2-/+) = 6/6).
