Abstract

21

We identified imported cases of a novel D614A mutation in the spike glycoprotein of SARS-

22

CoV-2 in the South Korea. SARS-CoV-2 harboring the novel mutation was isolated from

23

returning travelers from Uzbekistan. These results emphasized the possibility that new

24

mutations have emerged in that area.

25
26

Since a new novel beta-coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was first reported in December 2019,

27

there has been ongoing explosive spread of this virus throughout the world, severely

28

threatening human health (1). South Korea was one of the first countries to report a

29

significant Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) outbreak; however, the epidemic curve has

30

been quickly flattened due to the outstanding response of the Korean government (2).

31

Currently, community spread of Covid-19 has slowed in the South Korea. On the other hand,

32

more than half of confirmed cases were related to travel (2). The Korea Centers for Disease

33

Control and Prevention (KCDC) has begun to conduct whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of

34

COVID-19 isolated from travelers to obtain real-time genomic epidemiology data, rapidly

35

monitor how the virus mutates and investigate sequence variations.

36

On July, 2020, a man who entered Korea from Uzbekistan (Uzbekistan nationality) and had

37

symptoms of cough, fever, and headache was diagnosed with COVID-19 (3). For WGS, total

38

RNA was extracted, and cDNA was amplified using primer pools (https://artic.network/ncov-

39

2019). Libraries were prepared using the Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep Kit (Illumina,

40

USA), and sequencing was performed on a MiSeq instrument with 2 x 75 base pairs using a

41

MiSeq reagent kit V3 (Illumina, USA). The reads were mapped to the reference genome

42

MN908947.3 using CLC Genomics Workbench version 20.0.3 (CLC Bio, Denmark). A total

43

of 663,666 (98.50%) out of a total of 673,800 reads mapped to the reference genome. We

44

obtained 99.72% genome coverage at the median genome coverage depth of 1554×

45

(Supplementary Table 1). The genomic sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 strain were deposited

46

in GISAID (Accession no. EPI_ISL_516783, EPI_ISL_516784, EPI_ISL_516785). Using the

47

reference genome, single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were called using the BioNumerics

48

version 7.6 SARS-CoV-2 plugin (Applied Maths, Belgium).

49

We identified 14 polymorphic sites in the genome, which corresponded to all SNVs (Table 1).

50

In total, 13 appeared within the gene-coding regions. Of note, we identified a GAT GCT

51

(A23403C) nucleotide change, which leads to a nonsynonymous change (D614A) in the

52

spike (S) glycoprotein. Based on 77,577 viral genomes downloaded on August 5, 2020, from

53

the GISAID database (4), the DNA sequences corresponding to the S protein of each genome

54

were extracted and aligned to the mutated S protein (D614A) (Table 1). The alignment results

55

indicated that the D614A mutation of the S protein identified in this study was a novel

56

mutation that has not been identified previously.

57

In addition, two travelers who visited Uzbekistan and returned to Korea were diagnosed with

58

COVID-19 immediately after entering Korea. They arrived in the South Korea on July after

59

short-term travel (Supplementary Table 1). The WGS results of the above two isolates also

60

indicated that they had D614A mutations (Table 1). Due to the lack of WGS data on isolates

61

from Uzbekistan in GISAID, we were unable to compare our mutation results to those from

62

Uzbekistan. However, the identification of D614A in the S protein from three individuals

63

who traveled Uzbekistan in recent days emphasized that new types of mutations might be

64

emerging and spreading in that area.

65

The significance of the D614G mutation of the S protein for SARS-CoV-2 infection was

elucidated in a recent report by Korver et al. (5). Korver et al. suggested that an association

67

exists between the G614 variant and higher levels of viral nucleic acid in the upper

68

respiratory tract in patients, which make it more infectious than D614 and has allowed the

69

rapid spread of G614 throughout the world. Additionally, this higher level of infection might

70

require a higher level of antibody, which is correlated with vaccines or antibody-based

71

therapeutic agents. From a structural perspective, the D614G mutation destabilizes the

72

interaction between the S1 and S2 units, resulting in the promotion of S1 shedding.

73

Additionally, this mutation induces the conformational change of the receptor-binding

74

domain (RBD) of the S protein allosterically to promote the binding of angiotensin-

75

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (6). Additionally, the D614G mutation may modify the

76

secondary structure of the furin cleavage site to facilitate the cleavage of S1 and S2 (7).

77

Considering that the D614G mutation is expected to have significant effects on the spread of

78

SARS-CoV-2, it will be necessary to study and characterize the D614A mutation to evaluate

79

its phenotypes.

80

In this study, we identified novel D614A mutations in SARS-CoV-2 isolated from travelers

81

returning to Korea from Uzbekistan in recent days. The results of this study emphasized the

82

need for enhanced surveillance, which will be essential to combat COVID-19, especially

83

where genetic epidemiology data are scarce.
