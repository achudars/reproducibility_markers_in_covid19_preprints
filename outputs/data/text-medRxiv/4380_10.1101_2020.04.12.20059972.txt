Abstract
The unconstrained growth rate of COVID-19 is crucial for measuring the impact of
interventions, assessing worst-case scenarios, and calibrating mathematical models for policy
planning. However, robust estimates are limited, with scientific focus on the time-insensitive
basic reproduction number R0. Using multiple countries, data streams and methods, we
consistently estimate that European COVID-19 cases doubled every three days when
unconstrained, with the impact of physical distancing interventions typically seen about nine
days after implementation, during which time cases grew eight-fold. The combination of fast
growth and long detection delays explains the struggle in countries’ response better than large
values of R0 alone, and warns against relaxing physical distancing measures too quickly.
Testing and tracing are fundamental in shortening such delays, thus preventing cases from
escalating unnoticed.

1. Introduction
In December 2019, a cluster of unexplained pneumonia cases in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei
province in the People's Republic of China, rapidly progressed into a large-scale outbreak,
and a global pandemic by 11 March 2020, as declared by the World Health Organisation (1).
The disease caused by this highly contagious infection has since been named COVID-19, and
is caused by a single-stranded RNA coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) similar to the pathogen
responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory
syndrome (MERS).
Planning interventions, in particular physical distancing, usually relies on estimates of the
basic reproduction number R0. This is defined as the average number of new infections
generated by a single infected person in a fully susceptible population without control in
place, and determines the portion of transmission that needs to be prevented to avoid spread
(2). The impact of interventions is often quantified by the difference between R0 and the
effective reproduction number Re (sometimes denoted Rt, or simply R), R0’s counterpart in the
presence of control measures and/or population acquired immunity.
Early published estimates of COVID-19 R0 were extremely variable, ranging from 1.4 to 6.49
(3, 4), with most official sources reporting values in the range of 2-3 (5-8). However, these
latter values mostly derive from early studies of the epidemic in Wuhan (9-12) or the
Diamond Princess Cruise ship (13), and so are subject to important limitations, including
small amounts of data, arbitrary assumptions on epidemiological parameters (for instance,
assumed serial/generation intervals from SARS and MERS), uncertain or biased reporting of
early cases, and the uniqueness of the specific settings in which they occurred. For these
limitations, continuous effort should be devoted to understanding the discrepancies in
published values, and official ranges of R0 should be continuously updated with refined
estimates both from China (14, 15), and other nations (16-19).
Nevertheless, over-reliance on R0 should be avoided. First, R0 lacks temporal information
related to the speed of epidemic growth, and hence the optimal timing of interventions (20,
21). Second, estimates of R0 can vary considerably – and in particular do so for COVID-19 –
as a reflection of both genuine differences in geography and settings, but also how it is
calculated: R0 is typically indirectly derived through mathematical models, with values
varying depending on model structure and estimates of (or assumptions on) parameter values,
even when the same data are used for model fits.
We argue that the real-time growth rate and the delay between infection and case detection are
often more informative than precise estimates of R0 for initiating interventions (22, 23): since
doubling times and delays can be inferred directly from incidence and line-list data,
sophisticated models are not required to infer when action is urgent. Similarly, as
interventions are lifted, the growth rate can offer a more direct indicator of the current trend in
cases than Re, whilst understanding delays in detection is vital to inform the appropriate
intervals between subsequent relaxations.
While numerous estimates of R0 for COVID-19 exist, real-time growth rates are much less
prominent in the literature and, where published, lack robustness or are restricted to singlecountry analyses on a single dataset (16, 24). Even with interventions in place, estimates of
unconstrained growth remain essential for pandemic response, in particular to calibrate the
dynamics of mathematical models which are then used to assess the impact of interventions,
plan worst-case scenarios and explore short- and long-term forecasts.

2. Results
Here, we provide robust estimates of the initial growth rate in multiple European countries,
obtained with different methods. We then estimate the incubation period and the distribution
of times from symptom onset to hospitalisation under multiple scenarios and in different
settings, and compare them with other results from the literature. Our results show that, in an
unconstrained epidemic, cases can grow 8-fold before the effect of any intervention becomes
visible. Observation of the initial outbreak in the UK and Italy provides further support to the
highlighted delays from infection to detection.
To estimate the growth rate, we focussed on the number of confirmed cases in the most
affected European countries (Figure 1A), as reported by the WHO (25) on 31 March 2020.
The analysis accounts for changes in reporting by day of the week. To avoid relying only on
case confirmation, which could be affected by numerous biases, we also estimated the growth
rate from hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) bed occupancy and deaths in Italy (Figure 1B;
26). To ensure generalisability of results, we performed another analysis on a larger set of
European countries (Figure 2). With the exception of a few countries that are known to have
changed the testing policy over time or whose data appear visibly noisy, we consistently
found doubling times of about 3 days, that appear to be sustained before mitigation
interventions are put in place. These values are significantly shorter than early estimates from
China (9, 12). For robustness, we have used two different methods: semi-parametric and
generalised linear (details in Materials and Methods). Unsurprisingly, the results differ in
terms of their confidence intervals, but the conclusions are similar.
Although our results are robust to the method used, they might still be misleading if there are
biases in the data. This issue is particularly critical as lags in reporting of cases can create
discrepancies between national and international official sources (25-27) for case counts.
However, these are unlikely to affect our conclusions owing to the following considerations:
1. The fast growth and high numbers likely make small biases negligible.
2. Any multiplicative correction, such as constant underreporting, does not affect the
observed trend.
3. Exponential growth can easily be underestimated, e.g. if reporting rates decline over
time, but is harder to consistently overestimate; aggressive swabbing of asymptomatic
individuals (e.g. early on in the Italian locked-down towns), and changes in case
definition, might introduce such a bias in the data, but are unlikely to affect
observations for longer than a few days or consistently across different countries.
4. Hospital and ICU prevalence, which in the Italian data grow consistently with the
number of confirmed cases (Figure 1B), are less affected by reporting issues. The
observed faster increase in death rates may be explained by clustered outbreaks among
vulnerable groups (e.g. care home residents), coupled with quicker progression to
death among these groups, or possibly local hospital saturation.
Although each data stream individually has limitations, the evidence for fast exponential
growth in the absence of intervention that emerges from their combination is compelling.
Because non-pharmaceutical interventions, with unknown adherence, cannot be evaluated
until their effects emerge in the data, the delay between infection and case detection is crucial
in determining how long cases have been growing (or, when lifting interventions, can grow)
unobserved. Pre-symptomatic detection is not possible in the absence of full contact tracing
and testing of asymptomatic individuals; detecting cases at symptom onset is potentially more

feasible, but depends on the case-finding strategy, and frequently cases are not identified until
hospital visit.
We estimated the incubation period and the delay between symptom onset and hospitalisation
from UK line-list data provided by Public Health England (unfortunately not publicly
available) and a publicly available line-list which collates worldwide data (28). Our results are
more robust than previous published estimates, as we account for both truncated observations
and exponential growth in the number of infected cases (see Materials and Methods), but
nonetheless are consistent with the existing literature (Table 1). Our results also highlight
geographical heterogeneity, such as shorter onset-to-hospitalisation intervals in Hong Kong
and Singapore compared to the UK. With the exception of Singapore, the sum of the mean
incubation period and mean onset-to-hospitalisation interval is never shorter than 9 days.
Figure 3 illustrates the delays between infection and detection in early interventions in the UK
and Italy. For both countries, after a control measure is implemented, the number of daily
confirmed cases sustains the pre-intervention exponential growth for about 9 days, before
deviating from the predicted trajectory.
Since R0 remains the mainstay of most epidemiological analyses, we determined values of R0
consistent with a range of growth rates and modelling assumptions. For a growth rate of
0.25/day and our estimates of the incubation period (Table 1), we obtained values ranging
from 2 to 5 (Table S1A). This variability in R0 values at fixed growth rate is due to extreme
sensitivity to modelling assumptions and parameters, in particular the extent of presymptomatic transmission (and hence of the generation time distribution), for which estimates
in the literature vary widely (29). Conversely, the same R0 can be derived from different
growth rates, if different generation times are assumed. For this reason, R0 values can be
misleading if quoted in isolation: early estimates from China, which in the absence of reliable
information were derived from relatively long SARS-based generation times, may be close to
later estimates informed by shorter generation times, while hiding considerable differences in
growth rates.
Moreover, with substantial pre-symptomatic transmission, the magnitude of R0 can correlate
poorly with the feasibility of infection control (30). For example, if R0 = 4 and all
transmission occurs after symptoms onset, self-isolation when symptomatic can achieve the
required 75% fall in transmissions. Conversely, if R0 = 2 but most transmission is presymptomatic, the required 50% drop in transmissions can only be achieved through highly
disruptive interventions, such as mass quarantine, unless a solid infrastructure is in place to
rapidly detect and isolate pre-symptomatic individuals. Ultimately, neither R0 nor the growth
rate can predict the precise impact of changes in physical distancing. However, unlike R0,
growth rate and delays to detection can provide key guidance on how early action should be
taken to successfully manage the risk that initial interventions, planned under significant
uncertainty (e.g. in R0 values and expected levels of adherence), may later prove inadequate
for halting growth.
3. Discussion
Our estimates of unconstrained doubling times from Europe provide rigorous reference values
that can be used to remedy the paucity of these numbers in official sources. These values,
which are twice as short as early estimates, are essential to plan worst-case scenarios and for
calibrating models guiding the relaxation phase. Providing robust values for doubling time,
delays, and R0, is vital to avoid reliance on outdated and potentially misleading estimates, and

to avoid citation cascades which give them further prominence. For example, early figures
from China still dominate the literature and government reports (31-34).
The combination of short doubling times and long delays between infection and case
detection provides a powerful explanation for the pattern of countries initially
underestimating the significance of a small number of observed cases but then, in the attempt
to avoid the health-care system being overwhelmed, rapidly escalating interventions as each
appears to have no effect. At unconstrained growth, even doubling local hospital capacity
only buys three days of reprieve before bed capacity is breached. Moreover, even with
immediate, severe interventions halting all community transmission, within-household
transmission continues to occur, creating an additional delay between the beginning of
interventions and their effect (35). Further delays in case-confirmations, hospitalisations,
potential ICU admissions and deaths mean the latter figures continue growing well after
transmission control has been achieved. By the end of March our early estimates were being
used to advocate urgent action in countries still at the beginning of their epidemics (36).
Today, they can support governments’ decisions for swift initial action and implementation of
early and socially disruptive interventions, even when initial numbers appeared relatively low.
Recognition of both the growth rate and delays in case detection are fundamental to plan the
successful easing of strong interventions. Growth rates provide a directly observable measure
of current epidemic trends, whereas Re needs to be estimated indirectly. Understanding of
detection delays can avoid overconfidence in epidemic control: although likely not 8-fold as
in the early phase, new infections might build up unnoticed for several days while detected
cases appear consistently decreasing. Therefore, intervals between subsequent relaxations
should be long enough to allow proper assessment of their impact and avoid the social
challenges associated with re-introduction of stricter physical distancing. Significant levels of
testing, coupled with standard and/or technology-based contact tracing, are essential to
prevent transmission and shorten detection delays.

Materials and Methods
Data Sources
We consider four sources for our epidemiological data: the WHO (25 ), line-list data provided by Public Health
England (PHE), line-list data from (28 ) and the Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità (26 ). Of these datasets, three
are publicly available. The line-list from PHE is unfortunately not publicly available. From these sources, we
extract epidemiological data concerning case counts, incidence, hospitalisation, and delays between infection and
symptom onset, and onset of symptoms and hospitalisation.
These data sources and the code used to carry out our data analysis can be found at:
https://github.com/thomasallanhouse/covid19-growth.
Fitting the growth rate
Typically, an infection spread from person to person will grow exponentially in the early phase of epidemic.
This exponential growth can be measured through the real time growth rate r so that, loosely speaking, the
incidence of infection is y(t) = y0 ert + noise. A natural mathematical model to derive the estimate of r is a Poisson
family generalised linear model (GLM) with a log link.
The growth rate r is more intuitively reported as a doubling time (the time taken to double case numbers),
defined as tD = ln(2)/r. If r < 0, then tD < 0 and it is often interpreted as halving time, tH = −tD . The
log-linear analysis from a Poisson GLM defined formally below is restricted to datasets (or time windows) with
clear exponential growth.
To allow, in semi-parametric manner, time variation in growth rates, we adapt a generalised additive model
(GAM) where y(t) ∝ es(t) for some smoother s(t). Given the over-dispersed noise inherent in both disease dynamics
and surveillance data, a quasi-Poisson family is considered here. A canonical link and a thin-plate spline is used
as implemented in the R package mgcv (43, 44 ). The instantaneous local growth rate is then the time derivative
of the smoother, rs = ṡ(t), and the instantaneous doubling time is calculated as tD = ln(2)/ṡ(t). Asymptotic
confidence intervals are derived for rs which are only indicative of uncertainty on tD , especially as rs approaches
zero and variance is relatively large.
Potential issues with the GAM approach include that extrapolation outside of the data range (and hence
forecasting epidemic trend) is not sensible, and that there may be boundary effects from the choice of smoother.
However, this approach has the major advantage that it allows for time-varying estimates of doubling time and
thereby implicitly allows for missing explanatory information. We also include as additional explanatory variables
a week day effect due to reduced case reporting at weekends, followed by a back-log of cases at the start of the
week. Thus, denoting by y(t) the random number of new cases on day t, the expected value is
E[y(t)] = exp(dj + s(t)) ,

(S1)

where dj takes a different value for each day of the week (j = 1, 2, . . . , 7) corresponding to time t.
Unlike the semi-parametric GAM approach, the parametric GLM approach lacks the ability to capture time
variation, but allows for extrapolation and epidemiological interpretation. To capture over-dispersion we use a
quasi-Poisson family for the noise model. Explicitly, the Negative Binomial probability mass function (pmf) is

(S3)

Let the number of new cases on day t be y(t). We assume that this is generated by an exponentially growing
mean,
E[y(t)] = y0 ert = exp(ln(y0 ) + rt) ,
(S4)
which is then combined with the negative binomial pmf to give likelihood function for observations over a set of
times T of
Y
L(y|y0 , r, θ) =
NB(y(t)|n(y0 exp(rt)), θ), p(θ)) ,
(S5)
t∈T

where y = (y(t))t∈T . This can then be viewed as a GLM with time as a continuous covariate, intercept ln(y0 ), slope
r, exponential link function and negative binomial noise model (45 ). We can perform inference through numerical
maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and calculate confidence intervals using the Laplace approximation (46 ).
Figure S1 shows the GAM fit on the number of daily confirmed cases reported by WHO (25 ) between 25
February and 31 March 2020 for all the 18 European countries that had reached 1000 cumulative confirmed cases
by 27 March (the day Italy first overtook China). Data reported on day t + 1 are plotted against day t, assuming
it takes one day for each country to report numbers to WHO, as is the case for Italy. For each country, the left

panel shows the instantaneous growth rate from GAM (left axis) and the doubling time (right axis) with 95% CIs.
The horizontal blue line shows a null growth rate, at which point the doubling time is infinitely long and below
which the doubling time becomes negative. The right panel shows the output of the model fit and the data. For
Belgium, the GAM selects as most parsimonious a model with no change in growth rate during the entire time
interval. The apparently noisy data of Germany are explained well by a consistent day-of-the-week variability.
Conversely, visible oscillations in the growth rate of Denmark, Norway and Sweden suggest this is not the case
and reflect a more complex pattern in the data, likely due to wide variations in testing. This is also reflected in
Figure S2, where the challenges in fitting a simple exponential growth are clearly visible.
Estimating delay distributions
Delay distributions describe the time delay between two events. To understand how long until the impact of
an intervention may be observed, we need to understand the delay between infection and symptom onset (the
incubation period), and the delay from onset to visiting hospital (or healthcare setting), since this is where cases
are likely to be identified. A difficulty with estimating delay distributions during an outbreak is that events are
only observed if they occur before the final sampling date. Since delay distributions depend on the time between
two events, if the first event occurs near to the end of the sampling window, it will only be observed if the delay to
the second event is short. This causes an over-expression of short delays towards the end of the sampling window,
which is exacerbated by the exponential growth of the epidemic. Therefore, we need to account for this growth
and truncation within our model.
To fit the data we use maximum likelihood estimation. However, we do not observe the delay directly, but
rather the time of the two events. Therefore, we need to construct a likelihood function for observing these events.
Following (47 ), we construct the conditional density function for observing the second event given the time of the
first event and given that the second event occurs before date T . That is, we are interested in the conditional
density function
L(X2 ∈ x2 , X1 ∈ x1 , X2 ≤ T )
,
(S6)
L(X2 ∈ x2 |X1 ∈ x1 , X2 ≤ T ) =
L(X1 ∈ x1 , X2 ≤ T )
where x1 and x2 can be exactly observed or interval censored.
In the UK, the first healthcare visit is hospitalisation, as patients are encouraged not to seek in-person appointments with a general practitioner (GP) when showing flu-like symptoms. Therefore, we estimate the delay from
onset to hospitalisation. This is estimated using FF100 data provided by Public Health England (unfortunately
not publicly available), which contains data on the first few hundred infected individuals in the UK. These data
incorporated the time of symptom onset and time of hospitalisation. Cases who were hospitalised before their
onset date have been removed from the dataset, since they do not provide insight into the delay. Additionally,
some cases have no symptom onset, so these have also been removed from the data. For cases where symptom
onset and hospitalisation occur on the same day, we add half a day to the hospitalisation day, since the delay
is unlikely to be instantaneous. After processing the data, this left 106 cases from which to infer the onset to
hospitalisation delay. The dates in the line list are recorded exactly, so the likelihood function becomes
g(o)f (h − o)
f (h − o)
L(H = h|O = o, H ≤ T ) = R T −o
= R T −o
,
g(o)f (x)dx
f (x)dx

(S7)

where f is the density of the onset to hospitalisation delay and g is the density of the onset time. Using this
truncation corrected method and a gamma distribution to fit the delay distribution, we get a mean delay of 5.14
with standard deviation 4.20. To compare different regions, we also use data from Hong Kong and Singapore to
estimate the local onset to healthcare visit delays. These data are taken from an open access line-list (28 ), and
the filtered datasets are provided with the codes. Using the method above, for Hong Kong the mean delay is 4.41
days, with standard deviation 4.63, and for Singapore the mean delay is 2.62 with standard deviation 2.38. The
mean delay is much shorter for Singapore because many of these healthcare visits occur in a clinic rather than
hospital. Patients with mild symptoms attend a clinic, only going to hospital a few days later if their symptoms
become significantly worse. Therefore, infected individuals will be identified faster, suggesting Singapore has a
shorter observation delay. Hong-Kong data mostly refer to hospital admission, so the delay is similar to the UK.
For the incubation period, we use data from Wuhan during the early stages of the outbreak. These data were
extracted from an open access line-list (28 ), containing dates when individuals were in Wuhan and when they
developed symptoms (among other information). Since these data are from the early stages of the epidemic, the
majority of cases were in Wuhan. Therefore, it is likely that these individuals were infected in Wuhan, so the
time spent in Wuhan provides a potential exposure window during which infection occurred. For individuals with
symptom onset date before leaving Wuhan or the same day they left Wuhan, the upper bound on the exposure
window was adjusted to half a day before symptom onset. Using the data as of 21 February 2020, we have 162
cases from which to infer the incubation period. This infection date is interval censored, so we obtain the likelihood
function

where f is the incubation period density function and g is the density function of the infection date. We assume
g is proportional to the force of infection of the outbreak. Early estimates of the force of infection in Wuhan
suggested a growth rate of around 0.1 (9, 12). However, these estimates were biased by stochasticity (high levels
of noise in the dataset) in early identified cases before active case-finding was deployed, and the lack of testing
and diagnosis guidelines at the time. More accurate estimates suggest that the early growth rate could be closer
to 0.3 (38) or 0.4 (48). Based on our analysis of the European data and observations worldwide, the growth
rate in the absence of interventions seems consistently between 0.2 and 0.3. Therefore, we assume the force of
infection in Wuhan follows exponential growth with rate parameter 0.25 day−1 . Using a gamma distribution to
describe the incubation period, we obtain a mean incubation period of 4.84 days with standard deviation 2.79.
Reducing the assumed force of infection to the early estimates (growth rate of 0.1 day−1 ) gives a mean incubation
period of 5.92 with standard deviation 3.11. Therefore, although more accurate, using the growth rate of 0.25
does not substantially change the observation delay. Using the higher growth rate will more accurately capture
the minimum length of the observation delay, which is what is important for the analysis in the main text.
Estimation of R0
The relationship between the growth rate r and the basic reproduction number R0 in a simple homogeneously
mixing model is provided by the Lotka-Euler equation:
Z ∞
1
=
ω(τ )e−rτ dτ ,
(S9)
R0
0
where τ represents the time since the infection of an individual and ω(τ ) is the infectious contact interval distribution, defined as the probability density function (pdf) of the times (since infection) at which an infectious contact
is made. An infectious contact is a contact that results in an infection if the contactee is susceptible, and early on
in the epidemic any randomly selected contactee is almost surely susceptible.
Equation (S9) assumes all individuals have the same infectious contact interval distribution. However, if we
assume random variability between individuals, there will be a set S of curves Ω(τ ). However, equation (S9) still
applies, with ω(τ ) being the time-point average of all curves in S (49 ); see Figure S3.
The generation time Tg is defined as the mean of the infectious contact interval distribution ω:
Z ∞
Tg =
τ ω(τ )dτ .
(S10)
0

The same definition extends to a random infectivity profile of which ω is the time-point average.
For the incubation period we use our estimates from Table 1 (mean 4.84, standard deviation 2.79), which
are anyway similar to those estimated by others. However, information about any form of pre-symptomatic
transmission is hard to obtain but crucial for R0 estimates (29 ). Furthermore, there is also limited information
concerning how infectivity changes over time. Therefore, Table S1 reports the estimates we obtain assuming the
infectious period starts at the onset of symptoms, one, two or three days earlier, and assuming a Gamma-shaped
infectivity with mean 2 or 3 days. In both cases, the standard deviation is assumed to be 1.5 and the infectivity
is truncated after 7 days (see Figure S3).
We conclude that the estimates of R0 are highly sensitive to small variations in quantities that are challenging
to estimate. However, for a growth rate of 0.25 day−1 , close to what is observed in Italy and the UK, are also
generally larger, and possibly much larger, than early official estimates (5-8 ). Smaller values in this range are
associated with significant amounts of pre-symptomatic transmission, leading to a generation time compatible with
some of the shortest estimates of the serial interval seen in the literature (50 ), and with a front-loaded infectivity
curve (i.e. having mean 2, rather than 3).
We tested further assumptions. A simple SEIR model, with exponentially distributed incubation and infectious periods (with the same means as above but constant infectivity) leads to much smaller values of R0 than
our estimates, as it favours very short incubation periods (Table S1B, left). Estimates, instead, do not change
significantly if high variability in total infectiousness between individuals, in line with what observed for SARS, is
assumed (Table S1B, right) or if 50% of cases are assumed to be fully asymptomatic and transmit at half the rate
as those with symptoms (not shown).
These simple estimates are obtained under the assumption of mass-action mixing. The explicit presence of a
social structure (e.g. age-stratification, household/network structure, etc.), which in principle could affect them, is
likely negligible in such a high R0 and growth rate regime (51 ). The effect of the social structure on transmission
is expected to grow in importance (especially the household structure, since isolation and quarantine facilitate
within-household transmission) as the growth rate approaches zero.

Fig. S2: Linear y-axis version of Figure 2: daily confirmed cases (red dots) and estimated growth rate (solid) and
95% CIs (dashed black lines) for all European countries with more than a thousand cumulative confirmed cases
by 27 March, obtained using a Generalised Linear Model in the 9-day data period after a cumulative incidence of
20 is reached (shaded area). The only exceptions are Romania, where the fit starts 7 days later to exclude a phase
dominated by imported cases, and Denmark, where the fit starts 2 days earlier to capture the growth before the
change in testing strategy.

Fig. S3: Example of random variability in the generation time distribution. The model assumes a Gammadistributed latent period with estimates from Table 1, transmission starting 1 day before symptoms, a Gammashaped infectivity profile with mean 2 and standard deviation 1.5, and all individuals equally infectious. Ten
profiles are drawn (thin coloured lines), out of the 10000 of which the thick black line is the time-point average.
