Abstract
Background Increased inflammation is a hallmark of COVID-19, with pulmonary and systemic
inflammation identified in multiple cohorts of patients. Definitive cellular and molecular
pathways driving severe forms of this disease remain uncertain. Neutrophils, the most numerous
leukocytes in blood circulation, can contribute to immunopathology in infections, inflammatory
diseases and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a primary cause of morbidity and
mortality in COVID-19. Changes in multiple neutrophil functions and circulating cytokine levels
over time during COVID-19 may help define disease severity and guide care and decision
making.
Methods Blood was obtained serially from critically ill COVID-19 patients for 11 days.
Neutrophil oxidative burst, neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis), phagocytosis and
cytokine levels were assessed ex vivo. Lung tissue was obtained immediately post-mortem for
immunostaining.
Results Elevations in neutrophil-associated cytokines IL-8 and IL-6, and general inflammatory
cytokines IP-10, GM-CSF, IL-1b, IL-10 and TNF, were identified in COVID-19 plasma both at
the first measurement and at multiple timepoints across hospitalization (p < 0.0001). Neutrophils
had exaggerated oxidative burst (p < 0.0001), NETosis (p < 0.0001) and phagocytosis (p <
0.0001) relative to controls. Increased NETosis correlated with both leukocytosis and
neutrophilia. Neutrophils and NETs were identified within airways and alveoli in the lung
parenchyma of 40% of SARS-CoV-2 infected lungs. While elevations in IL-8 and ANC
correlated to COVID-19 disease severity, plasma IL-8 levels alone correlated with death.

increased oxidative burst, NETosis and phagocytosis. Readily accessible and dynamic, plasma

Introduction
Since the appearance of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China in December 2019, to the moment that
the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11th, 2020 and
beyond, there has been an imperative to understand better disease pathogenesis to develop
effective treatments and vaccines. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and systemic
inflammation characterize severe forms of the disease. Similar to SARS, pulmonary failure in
SARS-CoV-2 infection is due to both viral and host factors, including exacerbated inflammation
[1, 2].

Detrimental host immune responses to infections (immunopathology) are widely recognized and
studied in respiratory infections and inflammatory diseases [3-5]. Immunopathology in the context
of respiratory viral infections involves increased activity of innate immune cells, including natural
killer (NK), NK T-cells (NKT), innate lymphoid cells (ILC), inflammatory monocytes,
macrophages and neutrophils [4]. Among these cells, neutrophils are potent early mediators of
innate immune responses during infection available to clear pathogens but sometimes at a cost of
collateral inflammatory tissue damage [4, 6]. Neutrophil recruitment and their robust activation
increase lung tissue damage [6-8]. Recently, neutrophils have been proposed to play a role in acute
lung injury (ALI) and ARDS related to COVID-19 [9-11], based on the concept that local
neutrophil recruitment and activation leads to hypoxemic respiratory failure [12]. While several
groups have highlighted this potential detrimental effect of neutrophil activation in COVID-19
disease pathology [9-11, 13], no in-depth functional assessments of neutrophils isolated from
COVID-19 patients exist.

Neutrophils target invading pathogens through various intracellular and extracellular mechanisms,
with phagocytosis, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and release of neutrophil
extracellular traps (NETosis) representing three of the most important mechanisms in their
antimicrobial arsenal [14]. Neutrophils produce cytokines and chemokines that contribute to the
inflammatory milieu during active infections, and ROS and NETosis have been implicated in
mediating the damage to surrounding tissue [6, 15, 16]. In COVID-19, two recent studies
associated severe disease with circulating neutrophilia [17, 18], and COVID-19 patient neutrophils
showed higher activation marker expression than those of healthy controls [18]. Elevated levels of
NET components including myeloperoxidase (MPO), citrullinated histone H3, and DNA are seen
in COVID-19 patient sera [18, 19]. While treatment of naïve neutrophils from healthy donors with
serum from COVID-19 patients stimulated NETosis [19], and NETs are seen in lung tissue of
COVID-19 patients [20], assays have not been on neutrophils isolated from COVID-19 patients to
define their functional capacity and association with disease severity.

We sought to define carefully the functional state of neutrophils freshly isolated from the
circulation of critically ill COVID-19 patients. By obtaining neutrophils and cytokine profiles from
on multiple days over the course of illness, our studies had robust power to detect corresponding
changes in neutrophil function and systemic inflammation in this novel disease. Consequently,
correlations between circulating leukocytes, neutrophil numbers, plasma IL-8 levels, neutrophil
function and disease severity were identified.

The research protocol was approved by the UCSD, VASDHS and Rady Children’s Hospital
institutional review boards (IRBs) and all participants or designated family member gave written
informed consent. Critically ill COVID-19 patients hospitalized at UCSD and Rady Children’s
Hospital were recruited for these studies. After informed consent, blood was drawn on days 1, 3,
5, 7, 9, 1, most commonly between 8-10 am, and immediately prior to discharge. On days where
11 ml of blood or greater was obtained, neutrophils were isolated for functional studies. Healthy
controls were recruited from VASDHS and UCSD staff members. All healthy control subjects
underwent informed consent, passed COVID-19 screening protocols on each blood draw day, and
donated blood once a week for four weeks. Rapid autopsy for donation of tissue for research was
conducted under a waiver from the UCSD IRB.

Subjects
Data from all 16 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with neutrophil data obtained on multiple days
were included. Data from an additional 4 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were also used for the
cytokine studies. APACHE (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) II scores were
calculated using clinical data within 24 h of blood draws for neutrophil functional assays derived
by chart review. Other scores were also considered – SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure
Assessment) was excluded due to a lack of variable diversity and small range of values. APACHE
III and IV are more complex scores with additional variables, but yielded no additional sensitivity
to detecting changes in disease severity in this patient population. APACHE II is known to have
consistent calibration compared to III and IV, and more subjects globally are assessed with the
APACHE II. COVID-19 patients had APACHE II scores ranging from 7 to 27 on ICU admission.
Healthy controls were attributed an APACHE score of 0. White blood cell count (WBC), absolute

neutrophil count (ANC) and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratios were captured from the clinical data of
SARs-CoV-2 positive patients throughout their hospital and were closely matched to the timing of
blood draws for neutrophil assays. Lung tissue was obtained within 2 h postmortem from a 67
year-old male COVID-19 patient, intubated for 17 days prior to death in July 2020.

Cytokine quantification
The Human Anti-Virus Response Panel (13-plex; BioLegend Inc) was used to assess human
plasma cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNFα, GM-CSF and IP-10) from plasma samples
obtained across multiple timepoints and stored at -80ºC until ready for use. On the day of the assay,
plasma was thawed at room temperature, centrifuged at 1,000 g for 5 min, and run at a 2-fold
dilution in Assay Buffer using the recommended 96-well filter plate method precisely per the
manufacturer’s protocol. Samples were acquired on a Canto II flow cytometer (BD) using a high
throughput sampler and run in duplicate unless plasma volume was inadequate with corresponding
standards on all plates. Cell signaling technology (CST) was run prior to all flow cytometry runs
to ensure low detector CVs and set laser delay. LEGENDplex Data Analysis Software
(BioLegend) was used for analysis.

Neutrophil cell isolation and functional assays
Neutrophil isolation: On multiple days across the hospital stay for COVID-19 subjects, and once
a week for control subjects, blood was drawn into lithium heparin tubes (BD Vacutainer) with an
average gap of 2.5 h to transfer time prior to neutrophil isolation —this gap was mimicked for
neutrophil isolation from healthy controls. Neutrophils were isolated using PolymorphprepTM
(PROGEN) per manufacturer’s instructions as previously described [21]. Briefly, whole blood was

layered on 20 ml of PolymorphprepTM in a 50 ml conical tube and centrifuged at 500 x g for 30
min at 20°C, sans brake. The granulocyte layer was collected and washed with HBSS with no
calcium, no magnesium (HBSS-/-) and centrifuged at 400 x g for 10 min at 20°C. The cell pellet
was resuspended in 1 ml HBSS-/-, 10 uL was cytospun and Giemsa Wright stained, and cells were
counted using light microscopy and a hemocytometer. Average neutrophil purity across samples
was 90%. Cells were resuspended at 2x106 cells/ml for functional assays.

NET staining within lung tissue
Lung tissue obtained by rapid bedside autopsy was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h then
processed for PBS washing and paraffin embedding. After deparaffinization and rehydration,
tissue slides were subjected to antigen retrieval in high PH buffer (Tris-EDTA with 0.05%
Tween20, Ph 9.0) at 100℃ for 12 min. After blocking with goat or donkey serum, primary
antibodies were incubated overnight at 4℃ . Incubation of secondary antibodies for 1 h at room
temperature was followed by treatment with TrueBlack (Biotium) to reduce autofluorescence.
Images were acquired by Zeiss fluorescence microscope (ZEISS Axio Imager 2). Primary
antibodies used for immunofluorescence were: CD66b (1:100, 392902, Biolegend), citrullinated
H3 (H3-cit) (1:100, ab5103, Abcam), myeloperoxidase (MPO) (1:100, AF3667, R&D), and
histone-2B (H2B) (1:100, 606302, Biolegend). 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used
for nucleic acid staining. Haemotoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining was conducted by using the
standard protocol.

Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism Version 8.4.3 (San Diego). Patient
demographics were compared using the t-test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. Plasma
cytokine levels and NETosis in controls and COVID-19 subjects were compared with the MannWhitney test. ROS production and phagocytosis assays were analyzed using mixed-effects models
with Geisser-Greenhouse correction and Sidak’s multiple comparisons test for each timepoint.
Correlation of NETosis with WBC, ANC and APACHE score were done with linear regression.
Analyses of APACHE score correlation with ANC and IL-8 were performed with linear
regression. Comparison of IL-8 levels between controls and patients with APACHE score groups
was performed with ANOVA with Sidak’s correction for multiple comparisons. Two-sided tests
and α level of 0.05 were used to determine significance.

Results
Characteristics of the COVID-19 patients and healthy controls
Mean age was 57.5 years for COVID-19 patients and 40 years for controls (p = 0.008; Table 1).
The COVID-19 cohort included equal numbers of female and male subjects. All COVID-19
patients had pre-existing conditions, with hypertension being the most prevalent (50%), followed
by diabetes mellitus (25%), COPD (25%), congestive heart failure (12.5%), ischemic stroke (6%)
and asthma (6%).

Fifteen out of 16 COVID-19 patients were admitted to the ICU (94%) with average APACHE II
score 16.5 (range of 7-27). Patients averaged 6 days from first symptom to ICU admission and
remained in the ICU for an average of 14 days (range 4-32). The mortality rate for this cohort was
19% (n = 3). All ICU patients required vasopressors and 88% required invasive mechanical

ventilation. Ventilated patients had an average Murray score of 2.6 and an average P/F ratio of 128
prior to intubation and 206 at extubation. The average PEEP requirement at intubation was 11 and
peak PEEP was 13. Only three patients received steroids. A wide variety of antimicrobials and
antivirals were given, with vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, azithromycin and ceftriaxone the
most common. Micafungin and acyclovir were used once, and remdesivir was used in 5 patients
as part of clinical trials (Supplementary Table 1).

Increased neutrophil and general inflammatory cytokines in COVID-19
Plasma cytokine profiles and complete blood counts of our COVID-19 patient cohort demonstrated
similarities to published cohorts [22-25], with elevations in IL-8, IL-6, IP-10, and of the
neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (mean 9.3). Profiling of specific cytokines relevant to neutrophil
activity showed broad elevations across IP-10, IL-6, IL-8, GM-CSF, IL-1β, IL-10 and TNFα in
the circulation of critically ill COVID-19 patients both early in their hospitalization (Fig. 1A) and
were persistently elevated across their hospitalization, assessed at multiple time points (Fig. 1B).

Circulating neutrophils from COVID-19 patients have higher rates of NETosis than healthy
individuals
Circulating neutrophils receive inflammatory signals prior to entering tissues that impact their
potential detrimental activity once in the tissue. There is mounting evidence of the role of NETs
in systemic and pulmonary inflammation in COVID-19 [20, 26]. We investigated NET production
by circulating neutrophils ex vivo by relative fluorescence of released dsDNA that may parallel
exacerbated inflammation in the lungs. Neutrophils isolated from COVID-19 patients produced
more NETs in steady state (without stimulation) than neutrophils from healthy individuals, and

10

such differences were consistent even upon stimulation with different concentrations of PMA (Fig.
2A). We observed the same trend when using fluorescence microscopy staining for
myeloperoxidase, a major protein component of NETs (Fig. 2B). These data show that circulating
neutrophils from COVID-19 patients are more prone to produce NETs than neutrophils from
healthy individuals, and thus may be primed to cause significant NET-mediated tissue injury once
they enter into lung tissue.

Neutrophils and NETs present in terminal bronchioles and alveoli of COVID-19 lung tissue.
Beside their antimicrobial function, release of NETs has been associated with collateral host tissue
damage, including the lungs [10, 15]. Deterioration of lung function due to cellular damage and
inflammation with subsequent hypoxemia is a hallmark feature of severe COVID-19, although the
underlying mechanisms remain unknown [27]. To investigate the presence of neutrophils and
NETs in COVID-19 lung tissue, we performed rapid autopsies on five deceased patients, plus
additional non-COVID controls, which demonstrated a multitude of neutrophils across airways
and alveoli by H&E staining of lung tissue in two of the five patients (Figure 3A). Specifically,
alveolar lung parenchyma showed extensive organizing pneumonia with areas of interstitial
fibrosis, consistent with prior diffuse alveolar damage, with the majority of neutrophils within the
terminal/respiratory bronchioles with focal areas with neutrophils within the alveolar lung
parenchyma (Figure 3A). Bronchiolar metaplasia was also seen. Positive staining for citrullinated
Histone H3, CD66b, and DAPI confirmed the presence of neutrophils and NETs within
bronchioles, alveoli and lung parenchyma (Figure 3B); NETs were furthermore positive for MPO
(Supplemental Figure 1). In the two SARS-CoV-2 infected lungs found to have NETs, the majority

of NETs were found within terminal respiratory bronchioles, with focal areas within the alveolar
lung parenchyma.

Circulating neutrophils from COVID-19 patients have increased production of reactive
oxygen species and increased phagocytosis
ROS production is an antimicrobial mechanism mechanistically linked to NETosis and known to
cause tissue damage [28]. Mirroring the NETosis phenotype, ROS production was increased in
COVID-19 patients as compared to healthy controls at steady state over time (no stimulation; Fig.
4A), and functional capacity increased upon stimulation with PMA at 2.5 nM (Fig. 4B), 25 nM
(Fig. 4C) and 250 nM (Fig. 4D). Circulating neutrophils from COVID-19 patients also
demonstrated increased phagocytosis of S. aureus bioparticles (Fig. 4E), suggesting that multiple
key innate antimicrobial and inflammatory functions of circulating neutrophils patients are
significantly increased in COVID-19 patients.

Increased NETosis is associated with leukocytosis and neutrophilia, and leukocytosis,
neutrophilia and plasma IL-8 correlate with COVID-19 disease severity
To assess absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and leukocytosis as potential biomarkers for disease
severity in COVID-19, we assessed the relationship between WBC and ANC with our ex vivo data
for NETosis at steady state (without stimulation) while controlling for neutrophil numbers in our
experiments. We found a positive correlation of WBC to NETosis (Fig. 5A). Patients with
leukocytosis (WBC greater than 11x103 cells/mm3) produced more NETs per neutrophil than
patients without leukocytosis (r2 = 0.48, p <0.0001; Fig. 5B). Similarly, we found a positive
correlation of ANC to NETosis (r2 = 0.53, p <0.0001; Fig. 5C) and patients with neutrophilia (ANC

greater than 8x103 cells/mm3) produced more NETs per neutrophil than patients without
neutrophilia (Fig. 5D). Higher levels of neutrophils correlated with disease severity, as measured
by APACHE II (r2 = 0.24, p = 0.005; Fig. 5E), while lymphocyte counts fell as disease severity
increased (r2 = 0.19, p < 0.001; Fig 5F). These data demonstrate that COVID-19 patients with
leukocytosis, neutrophilia and lymphopenia are highly likely to have increased inflammatory and
antimicrobial functions, including NETosis.

We also explored a potential direct relationship between NETosis and disease severity, using the
APACHE II score as an indicator for illness severity, but found no such correlation (r2 = 0.10, p =
0.07; Fig. 5G). To be thorough, we also assessed the relationship of NETosis with SOFA and
COVID-GRAM scores, and found no associations. However, plasma levels of IL-8 significantly
correlated with higher APACHE II scores, both across hospitalization (Fig. 5H) and on the first
check (Fig. 5I). All other elevated cytokines were also assessed for a disease severity correlation,
but none was found. The neutrophil-associated cytokine was highest in the plasma of the most
critically ill patients as compared to healthy controls and those less severely ill (Fig. 5J), and IL-8
was significantly higher in those who succumbed to the disease (Fig. 5K).

Discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic has struck the world affecting many aspects of life, and we are
undoubtedly in a race against time to find effective treatments and vaccines against SARS-CoV2. Our work focused on examining the role of neutrophil activity in COVID-19 patients, due to the
many roles of these cells in lung and systemic tissue damage in the context of infectious and non-

infectious challenges [29]. The serial measurements (with pairing of clinical state with neutrophil
function and cytokine levels on the same day) allowed more in-depth assessment of the immune
state in COVID-19, and allowed for assessment of the roles of many clinical factors in neutrophil
function. We particularly looked at medications used and treatment modalities applied and did not
find any that were significantly associated with neutrophil functional changes. We confirmed the
presence of neutrophils and NETs within alveoli and airways within lung tissue from two deceased
COVID-19 patients, which complements recent data whole tissue transcriptomic analysis of lung
tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) that found upregulation of genes associated with
NETosis [17], and recent data on the presence of NETs within lung tissue of COVID-19 patients
[20]. However, the absence of NETs within lung parenchyma in three deceased COVID-19
patients suggests that there is heterogeneity in the patterns of immunopathology in this disease.
This fits well with the current concept of different subtypes of ARDS [30], and confirms that not
all COVID-19 ARDS is the same [31].

By assessing ex vivo key functional neutrophil activities, we show that circulating neutrophils in
COVID-19 have multiple functional changes, including increased oxidative burst, NETosis and
phagocytosis. These findings are in alignment with a recent study showing that neutrophils from
COVID-19 patients have higher expression of CD66b and decreased CD62L [18], consistent with
an enhanced neutrophil activation phenotype. Healthy neutrophils exposed to serum from COVID19 patients have increased NETosis as compared to neutrophils treated with serum from healthy
individuals [19], other studies found NET components in serum and/or plasma of COVID-19
patients, including cell free-DNA [18, 19], MPO-DNA [18, 19], NE-DNA [18] and citrullinated

histone H3 [18, 19], and Veras et al. demonstrated increased NETosis in COVID-19 neutrophils
[26].

The link between neutrophils and COVID-19 pathogenesis continues to grow stronger, with
several reports addressing the potential relevance of these cells and their activities in disease
progression [10, 11, 13, 16, 32]. COVID-19 patients have increased frequencies or total numbers
of circulating neutrophils compared to healthy individuals [17, 18], and we confirm the
leukocytosis and neutrophilia in severe COVID-19, while further showing that both indices are
associated with an ability of circulating neutrophils to produce higher amounts of NETs ex vivo in
steady state and following stimulation. We had hypothesized that neutrophil function might be a
potential biomarker in COVID-19, but found a stronger correlation with the neutrophil cytokine
IL-8.

While “cytokine storm” has been characteristic of severe forms of COVID-19 [33], plasma IL-6,
IL-8 or TNF-α levels at the time of hospitalization have not proven to be strong and independent
predictors of patient survival [34]. In our cohort, we confirmed elevated levels of IL-8, IL-6, and
IP-10 in the plasma of COVID-19 patients as compared to healthy controls, with IL-8 alone
positively correlated with increased severity of disease (assessed by APACHE II scores). These
data support the idea of IL-8, the most powerful neutrophil chemokine which also activates
oxidative burst in neutrophils, as a potential dynamic biomarker in this novel disease. Moreover,
other cytokines were elevated in COVID-19 patients and merit further investigation in the future
such as IP-10, GM-CSF, IL-1β and IL-10. While all cytokines were elevated in COVID-19
subjects across their hospitalizations, longitudinally, each cytokine was also significantly elevated

at the first check. These data suggest that cytokine profiling upon admission may help detect
patients at higher risk for severe disease.

Our study has limitations. Our control subjects were younger, had higher numbers of Asian
ancestry and fewer of Hispanic heritage than our COVID-19 patients. This situation is primarily
due to the limitation to conduct human subjects research during the COVID-19 pandemic, such
that we were limited to recruiting from employees at the VA San Diego Healthcare System.
These control subjects were primarily to define the range of normal for neutrophil functional
assays, run on different days, as there is significant day to day variability in these assays.
Studying neutrophils from these control subjects on multiple days proved that it is feasible to
define the activation state of neutrophils at a single timepoint as well as over time. It is unknown
whether hypertension, cardiac disease, and ancestry impact neutrophil function. Diabetes and
increasing age are associated with diminished neutrophil function [35-37]; thus, we do not
believe that the increased neutrophil function in the COVID cohort is due to higher levels of
these comorbidities. Another limitation is the size of our cohort, but by obtaining neutrophils,
plasma and clinical data at multiple points over time, this approach increased the power of our
study to detect clinically significant changes.

The role of neutrophils in COVID-19 immunopathology is gaining interest rapidly. In aggregate,
ours is the first study to report broad functional assessments of circulating neutrophils isolated
from critically ill COVID-19 patients, and to put these findings in context of plasma cytokine
levels, disease severity, and neutrophil counts. We confirm the presence of NETs within the lungs
of COVID-19 patients, and support a prior report of NETs within the terminal bronchioles and

alveoli. Our data show overall enhanced NET production, ROS production and phagocytic activity,
and correlations of WBC, ANC and IL-8 levels with severity of disease, highlighting the potential
detrimental contribution of hyperactivates neutrophils during COVID-19. These data support the
ongoing efforts to therapeutically target neutrophil-related mechanisms and propose neutrophilcentric biomarkers to utilize in the continuing battle against this devastating disease.

(r2 = 0.53, p <0.0001). D) Patients with neutrophilia produced significantly more NETs than
patients with ANC levels under 8x103/mm3. E) Scatter plot showing that severity of COVID-19
positively correlated with neutrophilia (r2 = 0.24, p = 0.005). F) Decreasing lymphocyte counts
were found as COVID-19 severity rose. G) NETosis was not found to correlate with severity of
disease (r2 = 0.11, p = 0.069). H) Severity of COVID-19 correlated with IL-8 levels quantified on
multiple days across hospitalization (r2 = 0.403, p = 0.006). I) IL-8 levels at the first time point, on
entry to the study, also correlated with disease severity (r2 = 0.449, p = 0.034). J) Plasma IL-8
levels were highest in COVID-19 patients with the greatest disease severity (APACHE II >15). K)
Patients who succumbed to their disease had greater IL-8 plasma levels than those who survived.
Error bars represent 95% CI. ****p < 0.0001.
