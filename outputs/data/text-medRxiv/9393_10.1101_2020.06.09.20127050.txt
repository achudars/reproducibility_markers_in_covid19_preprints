Abstract
High throughput serological tests that can establish the presence and functional activity of antiSARS-COV2 antibodies are urgently needed. Here we present microsphere-based Flow
Cytometry assays that quantify both anti-spike IgGs in plasma, and the ability of plasma to
inhibit the binding of spike protein to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). First, we
detected anti-spike-trimer IgGs in 22/24 and anti-spike-receptor-binding-domain (RBD) IgGs in
21/24 COVID+ subjects at a median of 36 (range 14-73) days following documented SARSCoV-2 RNA (+) secretions. Next, we find that plasma from all 22/24 subjects with anti-trimer
IgGs inhibited ACE2-trimer binding to a greater degree than controls, and that the degree of
inhibition correlated with anti-trimer IgG levels. Depletion of trimer-reactive Igs from plasma
reduced ACE2-trimer inhibitory capacity to a greater degree than depletion of RBD-reactive Igs,
suggesting that inhibitory antibodies act by binding both within and outside of the RBD. Amongst
the 24 subjects, presence of fever was associated with higher levels of anti-trimer IgG and
inhibition of binding to human ACE2. This inhibition assay may be broadly useful to quantify the
functional antibody response of recovered COVID19 patients or vaccine recipients in a cell-free
assay system.

Introduction
In late 2019 a novel SARS-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China1. It rapidly
spread across the globe, and the disease it causes, COVID19, was declared a pandemic by the
WHO in March 20202. The cryo-EM structure of the spike glycoprotein, a viral surface protein
that mediates cell entry of corona viruses, was solved by two groups3,4, revealing a trimeric
structure with either none or one of three receptor binding domains (RBDs) in the “up” state,
capable of binding to its target. Similar to the 2003 SARS-CoV-1 virus, angiotensin converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as the receptor necessary and sufficient for infection of the target
cell3–7.
Nearly all patients who recover from SARS-CoV-2 infection produce IgM and IgG
antibodies against the spike protein7–9, and a large number of serologic tests have been
produced and marketed. However, it is unclear how effective the detected antibodies are at
neutralizing viral activity. The percentage of people who show functional responses using cellor protein-based neutralizing assays varies depending upon the analytical strategy used; for
example a study measuring in vitro inhibition of ACE2-RBD binding in an ELISA-style assay
showed only 3 of 26 (11.5%) recovered patients strongly inhibited binding7, while a larger study
using pseudotyped lentivirus showed significant inhibition of infectivity in 165 of 175 (94.3%)
recovered patients9. Indeed, human monoclonal antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2
infectivity have been show to bind epitopes both within7 and outside of the RBD10, so it is
unclear if RBD-based measurements capture the full repertoire of inhibition of viral infectivity.
While pseudoviruses that use the native spike protein to infect cells appear to at identify
antibodies that neutralize viral entry9, these assays are technically demanding, require
specialized biosafety facilities, and may be difficult to scale up for population-level testing.
Here, we describe a novel, overnight, cell-free assay to quantify a plasma sample’s
ability to inhibit the binding of ACE2 to the recombinant trimeric spike protein3. The assay is
based on immunoprecipitation detected by flow cytometry (IP-FCM) technology, a highly

sensitive and reagent efficient method for detecting protein-protein interactions using minimal
amounts of biomaterial11,12. We find that while only a minority of persons who have recovered
from symptoms of COVID-19 produce antibodies that inhibit the RBD domain binding to ACE2
in vitro, almost all (22/24) produce antibodies that potently inhibit the full trimer binding to ACE2.
Our results provide a new, relatively rapid and high-throughput method to quantify circulating
levels of functional anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and suggest that the entire spike protein as
opposed to the RBD should be used when characterizing SARS-CoV-2 immunity.

Results
IgG Detection
We designed and optimized IP-FCM assays to detect the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2
spike antibodies in human serological samples by covalently coupling either the recombinant
RBD fragment13 or a spike trimer construct3 to carboxy-modified polystyrene latex (CML, data
shown in supplemental figures) or to Luminex MagPlex microspheres. Coupled beads were then
incubated with increasing dilutions of plasma specimens, and then with anti-human IgG
antibodies conjugated to phycoerythrin (PE) (Figure 1A). Plasma specimens were obtained from
participants with SARS-CoV-2 RNA (+) nasopharyngeal secretions detected by rt-PCR at ≥14+
days post-symptom onset. These participants include COVID19+ subjects, confirmed by
RTPCR, enrolled into the Seattle Children’s SARS2 Recovered Cohort on/by 6/1/2020.
Additionally, de-identified banked plasmas from healthy individuals collected before 2019 were
used as negative controls. A plasma-dilution experiment using specimens from three SARSCoV-2 RNA (+) and two pre-2019 samples detected high levels of anti-human IgG in the
positive samples, and non-specific background reactivity in the controls that decreased to near
0 at higher dilutions (Figure S1A,B). Note that when using IP-FCM, lower median fluorescent
intensity (MFI) values at high concentrations of analyte can occur, resulting the U-shaped curve
shown in Figure S1A. We chose 1:1000 as an optimal plasma dilution, and separately identified

2 hours at room temperature (22-24oC) as the incubation conditions that resulted in the best
signal-to-noise ratio (data not shown).
Using MFI from the 30 control specimens, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were stringently
defined as “positive” at an MFI greater than the highest control value plus 5 standard deviations
of the control values (dashed lines in Figure 1B,C). Using this definition, 22/24 (91.6%) COVID+
samples were classified as ‘seropositive’ for trimer reactivity, and 21/24 (87.5%) for RBD. There
was a moderate correlation between RBD and trimer immunoreactivity (Figure 1D, r2 = 0.64).
Experiments performed using CML microspheres during assay development using a subset of
the total plasma samples showed similar results (Figure S1), and there was correlation between
trimer (r2 = 0.85) and RBD (r2 = 0.75) values for the 12 samples that were measured using both
microsphere types (Figure S1F, G).

Inhibition of ACE2 binding
To determine if the presence of plasma IgG might correlate with inhibition of the virus
binding to its receptor, we designed an IP-FCM assay to quantify the binding of ACE2 and
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We coupled human ACE2 protein to CML (Figure S2) or MagPlex
(Figure 2) microspheres and incubated with biotinylated RBD or trimer, followed by incubation
with Streptavidin-PE (Figure 2A). Both trimer and RBD demonstrated strong binding to ACE2
(Figure 2B,C), and the EC50 was used to determine the dilution of spike proteins added to the
binding inhibition assay. As a specificity control, unlabeled human ACE2 inhibited binding of
both RBD and trimer by >90% (Figure 2D,E). After optimizing the plasma dilution (Figure
S2C,D,), we evaluated the same 24 COVID19+ and 30 pre-COVID patient plasma samples for
their ability to inhibit the ACE2-Spike interaction. Analyzed as a group, the median fluorescent
intensity (MFI) of control plasma was not significantly different than no-plasma controls in the
trimer or RBD assays (Figure 2F or H, respectively), while COVID+ samples significantly
inhibited binding (trimer ANOVA F(2,57)=52.4, p<0.0001, COVID+ vs. no plasma and pre-COVID

p<0.0001 by Tukey post-hoc test; RBD ANOVA F(2,57)=5.538, p=0.006, COVID+ vs. pre-COVID
p = 0.004 by Tukey post-hoc test). Similarly, when data were expressed as percent inhibition,
COVID+ samples produced greater inhibition than pre-COVID for both trimer and RBD
(p<0.0001 and p=0.0024, respectively, by 2-tailed t-test, Figure 2 G,I).
However, when data were examined by individual, important differences emerge
between the trimer and RBD-based assays. For the trimer inhibition assay, all 22 plasma
samples that tested positive for anti-trimer IgG (as defined above) showed greater inhibition
than any of the negative control samples (Figure 2J). Conversely, in the RBD assay, only 9/24
samples showed greater inhibition than the highest negative control, despite 21/24 samples
being sero-positive (Figure 2K). Moreover, in the trimer assay there was a strong correlation
between the amount of anti-trimer IgG and the percent inhibition among COVID+ (r2 = 0.79) but
not negative control (r2 = 0.04) samples (Figure 2J). There was no such correlation in the RBD
assay (COVID+ r2 = 0.047, negative control r2 = 0.034, Figure 2K). There was also no
correlation between the percent inhibition of plasma samples in the RBD and trimer assays
(Figure 2L, COVID+ r2 = 0.036, pre-COVID r2 = 0.011). For the two Trimer-negative samples,
follow-up testing using the commercial Cellex platform as well as laboratory-developed ELISAs
using spike and nucleoprotein (n=3 different labs) failed to detected anti-SARS2 antibodies.
Experiments performed using CML microspheres during assay development using a
subset of the total plasma showed similar results (Figure S2). There was good correlation
between trimer values for the 12 samples that were measured using both microsphere types (r2
= 0.85, Figure S2K), and MagPlex microspheres were more effective at distributing the
population across the dynamic range of the assay. For the RBD assay, there was poor
correlation between values measured using both microsphere types (r2 = 0.15, Figure S2L), but
samples that were more effective at inhibition appeared to show a trend toward a linear
relationship. Overall our data suggest that the majority of participants produces anti-trimer

antibodies that efficiently disrupt ACE2-trimer binding; but while most participants also produce
anti-RBD antibodies, less than half also disrupt ACE2-RBD binding.

Antibody depletion assay
We next depleted the plasma of one negative control and three COVID+ samples by
incubating plasmas with large numbers of trimer- or RBD-conjugated CML beads for three
consecutive overnight incubations until the levels of IgG detected in the plasma plateaued
(Figure 3A, B). We then ran the trimer-ACE2 inhibition assay on the depleted plasma to
determine if inhibition of binding was caused by antibodies binding within or outside of the RBD.
Prior to depletion, the COVID+ samples showed varying levels of ACE2-trimer binding inhibition
(41-75%). Inhibition was reduced by partially (although non-significantly) reduced by RBD
depletion, and was reduced to a greater degree by trimer depletion (Figure 3C, ANOVA
F(2,6)=8.51, p=0.018, Not depleted vs. RBD depleted p = 0.11, Not depleted vs. trimer depleted p
= 0.015, RBD depleted vs. trimer depleted = 0.30 by Tukey post-hoc test). Thus, even though
RBD depletion was more efficient than trimer depletion in terms of reduction in detectable IgG
(RBD: X%, trimer Y%, Fig 3A,B), trimer depletion was more at removing the neutralizing
capacity of the plasma. These data suggest that spike trimer neutralizing antibodies bind both
within and outside of the RBD.

Correlations between COVID+ subject characteristics and serology results
Participants (n=24) were between 28 and 63 years of age (median 42 years of age) and were
71% (17/24) female. The day of sample collection ranged from 14 to 73 days from symptom
onset, with a median of 36 days. All SARS-CoV-2 infections were symptomatic, ranging from
very mild to moderate illness; no subjects required hospitalization or supplemental oxygen.
12/24 subjects experienced fever and 16/24 experienced cough. Age was associated with a
trend toward increased anti-trimer IgG and inhibition (per year MFI difference: 3,816, p=0.09;

inhibition difference: 1%, p=0.07), although this may have been driven by the two subjects with
negative IgG, who were both relatively young (28, 41). Sex, days since symptom onset, and
cough were not associated with anti-trimer IgG or inhibition. In contrast, fever was strongly
associated with both anti-trimer IgG and inhibition in both unadjusted (MFI difference: 103,982,
p=0.007; inhibition difference: 20%, p=0.04) and adjusted models that accounted for subject
age, sex, and days from symptom onset (adjusted MFI difference: 103,530, p=0.01; adjusted
inhibition difference: 20%, p=0.03). Both IgG-negative subjects had very mild disease without
fever.

Discussion
The acquisition of antiviral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 will be a critical prerequisite for a
return to normalcy from the current pandemic. As of this writing, it is still unclear if infection or
vaccination will lead to robust, long-lasting immunity14. While some early data suggested
ineffective immune responses, such as low levels of ACE2-RBD inhibition by convalescent
serum in an ELISA-style binding assay7 or the detection of viral RNA in recovered patients15,
more recent data suggest effective anti-viral antibody activity in the majority of patients. For
example, serum from 94% of recovered patients effectively inhibited pseudotyped lentiviral
infection of susceptible cells9, similar to our rates; four Rhesus Macaques experimentally
infected with SARS-CoV-2 were resistant to re-infection16; and a recent report suggests that the
viral RNA detected in recovered patients is not associated with an active infection or the ability
to transmit COVID1917. Our data, demonstrating in vitro neutralization of ACE2-trimer binding in
92% of recovered patients, adds to this growing literature that collectively suggest that infection
with SARS-CoV-2 results robust immunity, at least in the short-term.
While we identified robust trimer-ACE2 inhibition in IgG-positive post-convalescent
plasma, only weak inhibition of RDB-ACE2 binding was detectable, and only in the minority of
samples. Moreover, there was no correlation between anti-RBD levels and inhibition of ACE2-

RBD binding, suggesting that some people may mount an antibody response to the RBD that
fails to inhibit binding of the RBD construct to recombinant, bead-bound ACE2. However, this
failure may be related to the relative affinity of the RBD construct to ACE2 vs. the affinity of
plasma antibodies to the RBD, and thus not be relevant to in vivo immunity. Indeed, depletion
of anti-RBD antibodies reduced the trimer-inhibitory activity of plasma, suggesting that at least
some trimer-inhibitory antibodies bind within the RDB. This is consistent with published studies
of monoclonal antibodies, which have been found to bind both within7 and outside of10 the RBD.
Regardless of mechanism, we report that for practical purposes, the trimer construct provides a
reliable, quantitative readout of immunity while the RBD construct is less useful.
Our cohort was comprised of relatively young, healthy subjects, none of whom were
hospitalized or required supplemental oxygen. Amongst these individuals, the levels of antitrimer IgG and inhibition were higher in those that experienced fever versus no fever. Findings
regarding correlation between antibody levels and clinical severity have been mixed18,19, with
one study describing higher antibody levels in severe versus moderate COVID19 cases, all of
whom were hospitalized8. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of a
correlation between illness severity and antibody levels in a community cohort. Our findings may
suggest that systemic illness or an inflammatory response lead to higher antibody titer;
alternatively, both the presence of fever and antibody titers may reflect host intrinsic differences.
There are several limitations to our study that should be noted. First, our cases were all
relatively mild (none requiring hospitalization or ventilation), and predominantly middle-aged
females. Future studies comparing the responses of older or more severely ill subjects would be
informative. Secondly, our study focuses solely on binding of ACE2 to the spike protein and
ignores other potential antigens or other immune mechanisms such as inhibition of protease
cleavage that might prevent viral entry into the cell. The results of our bead-based assay should
be confirmed using a pseudovirus assay, or ideally using live SARS-CoV-2 virus. Third, it is
unclear what level of inhibition would correlate with functional resistance to re-infection. Follow-

up studies tracking inhibition in our assay over time while simultaneously monitoring subjects for
re-infection will be necessary, given the ethical impossibility of experimental human inoculation.
Finally, our SARS-CoV-2 PCR+, antibody negative samples leave many questions. For
example, did they clear the virus through mechanisms beyond our detection, such as antibodies
targeted to alternative viral proteins or non-B-cell dependent mechanisms? Or were their rtPCR
results false positives? Most importantly, are they susceptible to future infections? Follow-up
with these or similar individuals will be important.
In conclusion, the trimer inhibition assay presented here could be broadly useful in the
settings of routine clinical evaluation of functional immunity in recovered patients, selecting the
most potent post-convalescent plasma for use as therapy, and evaluating the functionality of
antibodies produced in response to experimental vaccines currently under development. In light
of our results, we propose that future studies should use trimer-style constructs for serological
assays.

Methods
Human Samples: Negative controls consisted of banked samples collected from healthy
controls prior to January 2020. Samples from negative controls ranged in age from 19 to 66
years of age (median 37 ) and 18/30 were female (60%). Samples from participants recovered
from COVID19 came from the Seattle Children’s SARS2 Recovered Cohort. All subjects
reported testing PCR+ for SARS-CoV-2. All parent studies were IRB approved through Fred
Hutchison Cancer Research Center or Seattle Children’s Hospital.

Protein purification: The RBD construct (AA 319-541; UniProt P0DTC2) was cloned into the
pCDNA3.4 protein expression vector with an 8XHIS-tag and tandem aviTag. The SARS-CoV-2
trimer3 and Ace2 constructs were generously provided by Dr. Jason McLellan (University of
Texas at Austin) and Dr. Barney Graham (National Institutes of Health)3. Proteins were

expressed in 293F cells in antibiotic free, serum free media as previously described20. Briefly,
DNA was transfected using PEI Max and grown for 5 days at 37C, 5% CO2. The recombinant
proteins were purified by NiNTA affinity chromatography and polished by SEC for size on a
Superdex 200 16/600.

CML Bead Coupling: To couple RBD, ACE2 and Trimer proteins to flow cytometry-compatible
beads, we followed a previously published protocol12. Briefly, 50 μL of carboxylate modified
latex (CML) beads (Invitrogen #C37255, USA) were washed 3 times with 500 μL of room
temperature MES (50 mM MES (2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid), pH 6.0, 1 mM EDTA, in
ddH20, stored at 4˚C, used at RT) by spinning beads down for 1 minute at 13,000 x g at 4 °C
and discarding the supernatant each wash. The CML beads were then resuspended in 50uL of
MES and activated with 20 μL of 50mg/mL EDAC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)
carbodiimide HCl; Pierce, USA), freshly dissolved in MES from powder stored at -20 ˚C. This 70
μL of CML bead, MES, and EDAC was mixed for 15 minutes by gentle, continuous pipetting at
room temperature. The beads were washed three times with 0.5 mL of PBS. After the 3rd wash
the activated bead pellet was resuspended in a 100 μL solution containing 25 μg of either RBD,
Trimer or ACE2 protein in PBS and gently mixed for 3 hours at room temperature at 1400 rpm
on a pulsing vortexer. The coupled beads were then washed 3 times in 0.5 mL of PBS and
stored in 100 μL of Blocking Storage Solution (1% BSA in PBS, 0.01% Sodium Azide) at 4˚C
until use. Successful coupling was confirmed by staining ~0.5 μL coupled beads with PEconjugated anti-HIS tag antibodies (Santa Cruz, CAT #8036, USA) and compared to positive
and negative controls by flow cytometry.

Magnetic Bead Coupling: MagPlex Microspheres (Luminex #MC100XX-01, USA, where XX
encodes the bead region; all regions are compatible) were coupled as previously described21.
Briefly, 250ul of MagBeads were magnetically separated using a magnetic tube rack (New

England Biolabs, Cat# S1506S) for 60 seconds and washed three times with 250ul of MES.
MagBeads were resuspended 200ul of MES and 25ul of freshly-prepared 50mg/ml Sulfo-NHS
(ThermoScientific, #24510, USA) in MES was added to the beads and briefly vortexed. Then,
25ul of 50mg/ml freshly-made EDAC in MES was added and the tube quickly vortexed. The
tube was covered to protect from light and shaken at 1000 RPM for 20 minutes at room
temperature on a pulsing vortexer. Beads were then washed twice in PBS, and incubated with
of 25ug of Ace2, Trimer or RBD protein in 250ul of PBS, on a 1000 RPM vortexer for 2 hours at
room temperature protected from light. Beads were then washed in PBS and quenched in 750
μl of Blocking Storage Solution for 30 minutes at room temperature, 1000 RPM protected from
light. Finally, beads were stored in 100 μl of Blocking Storage Solution at 4C until use.

IgG Detection with IP-FCM: IP-FCM was performed as previously described11,12. Patient
plasma was obtained from the Seattle Children’s SARS2 Recovered Cohort. Plasma from both
SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients was heated to 56 °C for 1 hour, then spun at
13,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4 °C. The supernatant plasma was then diluted (1:1000 unless
otherwise indicated) in cold Fly-P Buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1% bovine serum
albumin, and 0.01% sodium azide) and distributed into wells of a 96-well plate at a volume of 50
μL per well, in duplicate. To each well, approximately 5 x 104 RBD- or Trimer-conjugated CML
beads, or 2.5 x 103 MagBeads were added. The wells of the 96-well plate were then capped,
and the plate left to rotate at RT for 2 hours. For CML beads, the plate was spun at 3500 RPM
to pellet the CML beads, the supernatant was discarded and the beads were washed twice with
125 μl of cold Fly-P Buffer per well. For MagBeads, a magnetic plate washer was used to wash
the beads three times (Bio-Plex Pro™ Wash Station, BioRad, USA). The washed beads were
incubated with 50 μL of 1:200 anti-Human IgG-PE (Jackson ImmunoResearch, #709-116-149,
lot 145536, USA) in Fly-P Buffer protected from light for 30 minutes at room temperature. The
plate was washed as above, and samples were resuspended in 50 μL of cold Fly-P Buffer. All

plasma samples were also run in parallel using BSA-coupled CML or MagBeads to determine
the baseline nonspecific signal generated from each sample. For CML beads, this background
varied greatly between individuals from 103-105 MFI units, but was consistent for each
individual. MagBeads gave much lower background levels and BSA beads were not used in
later experiments. Beads were then read on an Acea Novocyte flow cytometer with the following
gating strategy: gate beads using FSC-H vs SSC-H, eliminate doublets using FSC-H vs FSC-A,
and detect PE fluorescence using FL2 (488nm excitation, 572/28nm detection). Backgroundsubtracted median fluorescent intensity (MFI) was calculated for each individual by subtracting
the BSA-coupled bead MFI from the RBD- or trimer-coupled bead MFI.

ACE2-Spike binding assay: RBD or trimer protein was biotinylated by adding 1ul of freshlydissolved sulfo-NHS-Biotin (ThermoScientific, #21217, USA ) for 30 minutes on ice. The
reaction was quenched with 100mM Tris-HCL and excess biotin was removed by three washes
in a 10K MWCO Amicon Ultra spin filter (Millipore, USA). Biotinylated RBD or Trimer protein
was added to 5 x 104 ACE2-coupled CML or MagBeads in a total volume of 50 μL, in duplicate.
For inhibition assays, soluble unlabeled ACE2 or diluted plasma samples prepared as above
were added to each well, maintaining a final reaction volume of 50uL. Plasma was diluted 1:50
in FlyP buffer unless otherwise indicated. Each well of the plate was capped mixed end-overend at 4 °C overnight. The next day the plate was washed as above and incubated with 50 μL of
1:200 Streptavidin conjugated-PE (BioLegend, #405204, USA) in Fly-P Buffer protected from
light for 30 minutes at room temperature. The plate was washed again as above and samples
were resuspended in 50 μL of cold Fly-P Buffer for detection on the flow cytometer with gating
as above. Data were expressed either as MFI or as percent inhibition, calculated as 1- [MFI of

Patient plasma was diluted 1:50 in Fly-P Buffer and incubated with 2ul of RBD- or trimercoupled CML beads overnight at 4C. The next day, the beads were pelleted at 13,000 RPM for
1 minute, removed and discarded. A 2ul aliquot of plasma was reserved, and 2ul of new, RBDor trimer-coupled CML beads were added. This process was repeated for a total of 3 overnight
depletions. On the 4th day, 25ul of the RBD- or trimer-depleted plasma was run on the ACE2trimer binding assay, as described above.

Statistical Analyses.
Technical replicates were averaged and data were imported to Prism 8.0 (GraphPad).
Comparisons between two groups were made using two-tailed t-tests, and among three groups
with one-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc tests comparing all columns, corrected for multiple
comparisons by the Tukey method. Correlations and EC50 values were determined using
simple linear regressions or 4-parameter logistic regressions with default settings, and r2 values
were reported.

Ethics Statement
All parent protocols were approved by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center or Seattle
Children’s IRBs. This study was conducted under a protocol approved by the Seattle Children’s
Research Institute’s IRB STUDY00002514 (SEPS). All participants signed informed consent
forms.

(C,D) Plasma from 3 COVID+ samples (red) and two controls (black) was serially diluted, and
inhibition of Ace2 binding was measured using the trimer (C) or RBD (D) inhibition assay. E)
Compared to a no-plasma control (blue), pre-COVID control plasma significantly inhibited
Trimer-ACE2 binding (p<0.05), but COVID+ plasma inhibited binding to a much greater degree
(P<0.001 vs control plasma and no plasma). F) Same data as in A expressed as % inhibition vs.
the no-plasma control average. An arbitrary cut-off of 85% inhibition captures all IgG-positive
COVID samples. P<0.001. G) Compared to a no-plasma control (blue), pre-COVID control
plasma slightly and non-significantly inhibited RBD-ACE2 binding. COVID+ plasma inhibited in
some samples, such that the group mean was significantly different from both pre-COVID and
no plasma controls (P<0.005 vs control plasma and p<0.01 vs no plasma). However, the
population appeared to bifurcate into a responder and non-responder population (dotted line at
MFI = 20,000). H) Same data as in C expressed as % inhibition vs the no-plasma control
average. P<0.005. I) Trimer MFI plotted vs. % inhibition on the Trimer-Ace2 inhibition assay for
all COVID+ samples. J) RBD MFI plotted vs. % inhibition on the RBD-Ace2 inhibition assay for
