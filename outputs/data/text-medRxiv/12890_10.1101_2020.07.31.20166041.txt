ABSTRACT

36

Background. Rapid point-of-care tests (POCTs) for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies vary in

37

performance. A critical need exists to perform head-to-head comparison of these assays.

38

Methods. Performance of fifteen different lateral flow POCTs for the detection of SARS-CoV-

39

2-specific antibodies was performed on a well characterized set of 100 samples. Of these, 40

40

samples from known SARS-CoV-2-infected, convalescent individuals (average of 45 days post

41

symptom onset) were used to assess sensitivity. Sixty samples from the pre-pandemic era

42

(negative control), that were known to have been infected with other respiratory viruses

43

(rhinoviruses A, B, C and/or coronavirus 229E, HKU1, NL63 OC43) were used to assess

44

specificity. The timing of seroconversion was assessed on five POCTs on a panel of 272

45

longitudinal samples from 47 patients of known time since symptom onset.

46

Results. For the assays that were evaluated, the sensitivity and specificity for any reactive band

47

ranged from 55%-97% and 78%-100%, respectively. When assessing the performance of the

48

IgM and the IgG bands alone, sensitivity and specificity ranged from 0%-88% and 80%-100%

49

for IgM and 25%-95% and 90%-100% for IgG. Longitudinal testing revealed that median time

50

post symptom onset to a positive result was 7 days (IQR 5.4, 9.8) for IgM and 8.2 days (IQR 6.3

51

to 11.3).

52

Conclusion. The testing performance varied widely among POCTs with most variation related to

53

the sensitivity of the assays.

54

samples. The appearance of IgM and IgG bands occurred almost simultaneously.

The IgM band was most likely to misclassify pre-pandemic

Introduction

57

The respiratory illness Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute

58

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral infection.[1] The COVID-19 pandemic

59

has challenged the diagnostic testing capacity of the global healthcare industry. Though the

60

initial burden of disease was most pronounced in high-income countries, the pandemic has since

61

spread to middle- and low-income countries that lack substantial laboratory infrastructure.

62

Despite major efforts to contain and slow down the viral spread, the limited testing capability of

63

hospitals, public health laboratories, and government agencies remains a major challenge.

64

Accurate serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection are used to estimate the numbers of

65

individuals who have been infected and have developed a humoral immune response

66

(seroconvert). Understanding seroprevalence is important to determine the spread of the disease

67

and to identify populations with a high burden of infection.[2] Furthermore, if previous infection

68

provides immunity to the disease, these assays could be used to determine those who would be

69

vulnerable or protected from infection.

70

Broadly, there are two types of assay formats to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2

71

infection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and serologic lateral flow assays

72

(LFA). ELISAs, with or without a chemiluminescent signal, offer high throughput testing, but

73

require substantial laboratory infrastructure and trained personnel for operation.[3] LFAs that

74

detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are easy to use, rapid, portable and often qualify as point

75

of care tests (POCT) that can be used outside of a centralized laboratory facility. [4] POCT can

76

be used at home or in a doctor’s office and take minutes to complete. Unfortunately there is a

77

great deal of variation on the performance of these POCT assays for the accurate detection of

78

antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 infection.[5] Serologic LFAs can have wide ranging performance

79

based on the viral antigens used and how they were elaborated, and the construction of the

80

cassette.

81

Lack of standardization makes performance comparison of serological assays

82

challenging. Structurally, SARS-CoV-2 possesses four main structural proteins: spike

83

glycoprotein (S), envelope glycoprotein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M), and nucleocapsid

84

protein (N).[6,7] These proteins are immunogens capable of inducing the generation of the IgA,

85

IgG, and/or IgM antibodies targeted by LFAs. Unstandardized iterations in the antigen/antibody

86

combination used by LFAs is a key contributor for performance variation among platforms. Poor

87

understanding of immunological response kinetics to SARS-CoV-2 infection further complicates

88

evaluation. The impact of these variables was evident upon initiating comparison of different

89

LFAs for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection. [8–11] Initial reports are mixed: some report LFAs

90

as being unsuitable for use, while others profess their potential for rapid screening of patients for

91

acute infection.[9–11] Many of these studies were constrained by small sample sizes, failure to

92

evaluate for cross-reactivity and failure to assess sensitivity of the assays by stage of infection,

93

all of which could influence the findings.

94

Many LFAs were released into the market quickly due to US Food and Drug

95

Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization (EUA) as a response to the COVID-19

96

pandemic without a comprehensive assessment of performance. Since then, stricter criteria for

97

approval have been in place due to greater US FDA oversight of the antibody testing EUA

98

process. [12] These include evaluation of cross-reactivity (specificity >95% to other

99

coronaviruses), specificity approaching 100%, high positive/negative predictive agreement

100

(≥90%). Regardless of EUA approval, assessing the performance characteristics of LFAs is

101

necessary for understanding the longitudinal thresholds for sensitivity and specificity, and

102

potential cross-reactivity with other non-SARS-CoV-2 viruses.

103

For SARS-CoV-2, antibody reactivity or presence is generally measured as time from

104

symptom onset.[13] While consensus on the optimal time to perform the POCT is lacking, the

105

majority of reports suggest that the tests are best undertaken >14 days post-symptom onset.[14–

106

19] Furthermore, studies on samples from convalescent plasma donors, who had a documented

107

positive RT-PCR test, demonstrate that some individuals have undetectable antibody

108

responses.[20] In terms of specificity, false positive results may occur for a variety of reasons,

109

particularly due to cross reactivity to other coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, and

110

OC43).[9,12-22]

111

Despite increasing reports on the performance of individual POCTs to detect SARS-

112

CoV-2 antibodies, the overall performance of all the commercially available POCTs is still

113

unclear. To further expand POCT evaluation, we compared the performance of multiple POCTs

114

for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection. To this end we used the same set of samples from known

115

infected and uninfected individuals to perform a head-to-head analysis of 15 POCT assays. We

116

further evaluated seven of these assays to assess the time window between onset of symptoms

117

and detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Overall, the goal of our work is

118

highlighting the performance characteristics of a series of LFAs to further expand general

119

understanding of LFA utility and serve as an informative reference for potential deployment

120

efforts.

Characteristics of Individuals Studied

124

Ethics statement: The parent studies were approved by The Johns Hopkins University School of

125

Medicine Institutional Review Board (IRB00247886, IRB00250798 and IRB00091667). All

126

samples were de-identified prior to testing. The parent studies were conducted according to the

127

ethical standards of the Helsinki Declaration of the World Medical Association. This report

128

includes an analysis of stored samples and data from those studies. No additional samples were

129

collected for the current study.

130

Convalescent SARS-CoV-2 samples: The sensitivity of the POCTs was performed on 40 samples

131

from convalescent plasma donors.[22] These individuals had to have been RT-PCR positive for

132

SARS-CoV-2, and asymptomatic for at least 28 days.

133

symptom onset and the sample drawn for this study was 45 days (SD ± 7.5 days). All subjects

134

were HIV and HCV negative. (Table 1 and Table S1).

The time interval between date of

135
136

Pre Pandemic challenge samples: Specificity of assays was assessed with 60 samples from pre-

137

pandemic timepoints of individuals known to be uninfected by SARS-CoV-2. These samples

138

came from a study of patients presenting to the Johns Hopkins Hospital Emergency Department

139

with symptoms of an acute respiratory tract infection between 2016-20 as part of the Johns

140

Hopkins Center for Influenza Research and Surveillance study.[26] At the time of illness

141

nasopharyngeal swabs and sera were obtained at the same time. Nasopharyngeal swabs were

142

tested for influenza A/B viruses utilizing the Cepheid GeneXpert Xpress Flu A/B/RSV assay

143

(Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA), and were subsequently tested for respiratory viral and bacterial co-

144

infections as well as non-influenza respiratory viruses and bacterial pathogens utilizing the

145

Genmark ePlex RP RUO cartridges (Genmark, Carlsbad, CA). The sera from these time points

146

was tested with the VirScan assay, as previously described,[27,28] to identify samples with IgG

147

reactivity to other coronaviruses. For the analysis performed in this paper only data related to

148

coronaviruses 229E, HKU1, NL63 and OC43 was analyzed. Any sample that was reactive to any

149

peptide for these viruses was considered to have antibodies present against these viruses (Table

150

1, Table S1 and Fig. S1).

151

Longitudinal study samples: To determine the sensitivity of antibody testing by duration of

152

infection, plasma specimens obtained from individuals with known date of symptom onset who

153

had serial specimens were tested. Samples (n=272) came from 47 hospitalized SARS-CoV-2

154

RT-PCR confirmed patients and were used to determine the sensitivity by duration of infection

155

for a subset SARS-CoV-2 point of care antibody test kits evaluated. (Table 1).

156
157

Serology testing for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 infection

158

All POCTs were performed according to the manufacturers’ protocol. (Table S2). Any

159

detectable band was considered a positive result. Results were considered invalid when the

160

control band was not visible (Figure 1). Samples were also tested using the Euroimmun Anti-

161

SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (Mountain Lakes, NJ) with values e and the Epitope Diagnostic IgM

162

ELISA (San Diego, CA) per manufacturer’s protocol. The ELISA data served as a control.

Analysis

165

Sensitivity: This calculation was performed for both the samples from convalescent individuals

166

(n=40) and the longitudinally followed individuals. For the longitudinal samples, sensitivity was

167

calculated at four different time intervals, 0-5, 6-10, 11-15, and 16-20 days post symptom onset.

168

Sensitivity was calculated for IgM and IgG separately, and for IgM or IgG using the following

169

equation:

170

Sensitivity (%) = 100 x [Positive/ (Positive + False Negative)].

171

Specificity: This calculation was performed for the pre-pandemic sample set (n=60). The impact

172

of sero-reactivity to other coronaviruses was assessed. Specificity was calculated for IgM and

173

IgG separately, and for IgM or IgG using the following equation:

174

Specificity (%) = 100 x [Negative / (Negative + False Positive)].

175

Percent Agreement: This calculation was performed with the samples from both the convalescent

176

samples and the pre-pandemic era samples. The following equation was used to calculate the

177

percent agreement:

178

Agreement (%) = 100 x (n agree / total n)

179

Results

180

Sensitivity and specificity of IgM and IgG vary by SARS-CoV-2 antibody-based assays.

181

Performance results varied across the different assays (Figure 2). Considering the detection of

182

IgM, IgG, or either as a positive result, sensitivity of the assays ranged from 55% (95% CI 38-

183

71%) to 97% (95% CI 87-100%) and specificity from 80% (95% CI 67-89%) to 100% (95% CI

184

97-100%). Of the assays tested, Premier Biotech and Clarity exhibited the highest sensitivity

185

(97%; 95% CI 87-100%), while for specificity, CoronaChek, Premier Biotech and Sensing Self

186

were the best performers (100%; 95% CI 94-100%). Lowest sensitivity was obtained from

187

Wondfo (55%; 95% CI 38-71%), followed by Zeus (57.5%; 95% CI 41-73%), while the lowest

188

specificity was obtained from DNA Link (80%; 95% CI 67.2-89.0%) and Nirmidas (85%; 95%

189

CI 73-93%). In general the IgM band had a lower sensitivity among the samples from

190

convalescent individuals (0% to 87.5%) compared to the IgG band (25.0% to 95.0%). Only for

191

the Clarity and Smart Screen assay was sensitivity reversed. Overall, the specificity was much

192

lower for the IgM band than the IgG band (p<0.05).

193

Of the fifteen assays evaluated, CoronaChek, Premier Biotech, and Sensing Self were the

194

only tests without false-positive results when testing the designated negative SARS-CoV-2

195

samples (Figure 3a). Fourteen out of sixty samples generated false-positive results on more than

196

one POCT assay. Most of the specimens that generated a false-positive result, did so in four

197

different tests. Similarly, false-negative results were obtained when testing samples from patients

198

known to be RT-PCR positive. Twenty-eight out of forty samples generated a false-negative

199

result on more than one POCT. Of note, one specimen generated a false-negative result for all

200

but two of the tests.

201
202

Crossreactivity with other viral infections. To further evaluate the specificity of the different

203

assays, a set of challenge specimens were tested. These specimens comprised pre-pandemic

204

samples obtained between 2016 and 2019 from patients known to be infected with other non-

205

SARS-CoV-2 viruses. False-positive results were obtained with all the viral-specific antibodies

206

tested (Fig. S1). Crossreactivity was more pronounced with sera from patients infected with

207

different strains of coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43); little cross-reactivity was

208

observed from sera from patients known to have influenza A, B, or C and parainfluenza.

209
210

Agreement between assays. Agreement among the evaluated POCTs ranged from 53% to 100%

211

(Figure 3b). The majority of the assays’ results agreed between 75% and 100%, but four assays

212

(Covisure, Smart Screen, Wondfo, and Zeus) had lower agreement (53% to 82%). Lowest

213

aggreement was obtained between Wondfo and Ready Result (53%), while the highest percent

214

agreement was obtained between Premier Biotech and Clarity (100%), All Test and Safe Care

215

(98%), Safe Care and Clarity (98%), CoronaChek and Clarity (98%), and TBG with DNA Link

216

(98%). IgM results had lower percent agreement than those for IgG results (Fig. S2a and S2b).

217

Two ELISA-based tests, EDI IgM and the Euroimmun IgG, were used as a comparison to the

218

POCT-based assays (Figure 3a). The EDI IgM ELISA had thirty-five negative results out of the

219

40 convalecent plasma samples tested. Euroimmun ELISA testing resulted in one false-negative

220

result (sample 39), which was IgG negative by all POCTs evaluated. Both ELISAs generated one

221

false-positive result when testing the pre-pandemic camples (negative control), and both of these

222

were obtained for different samples. When evaluating the percent agreement between the POCTs

223

and ELISAs (Figure 3b), the percent agreement ranged from 13%-54% and 13%-100% for EDI

224

and Euroimmun, respectively.

225

Comparison of IgM and IgG ELISA values with the POCT results provided further insight on

226

each POCTs performance. EDI IgM ELISA ODn values between positive and negative POCT

227

results had little variation (Fig. S3), which underscores the poor agreement between EDI and the

228

POCTs. Euroimmun IgG S/C values had a stronger correlation with POCT results (Fig. S4).

229

However, for a subset of asssays, samples with high positive ELISA values had a negative POCT

230

result, suggesting POCT false-negative results.

231
232

Sensitivity by duration of infection. The sensitivity of IgM, IgG or any reactivity increased

233

with duration of infection. The performance of five POCTs (CoronaChek, DNA Link, Nirmidas,

234

Sensing Self, and TBG) and three ELISAs (Euroimmun, and both the IgM and IgG by EDI) was

235

evaluated using longitudinal samples from 47 hospitalized patients from day 0 to day 20 post-

236

onset of symptoms. The sensitivity for both IgM and IgG increased over time up to 20 days post-

237

symptom onset (Figure 4). The median time to sero-reactivity shorter for IgM was 7 days

238

(interquartile range [IQR] 5.4, 9.8) and 8.2 days (IQR 6.3, 11.3) for IgG. However, it was not

239

always true that IgM band appeared before the IgG band. For 13 patients the IgG bands

240

appeared earlier or on the same date as the IgM bands. For two of these patients, only IgG was

241

detected regardless of the time of testing. Four others did not obtain a positive result either by

242

POCT or ELISA for the time points evaluated.

243
244

Discussion

245

POCTs for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing are appealing given their low cost, ease of

246

distribution, and clinical use. However, the performance and reliability of these tests to detect

247

IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 at different stages of COVID-19 remain unclear, and

248

information about cross-reactivity of these assays towards other viral antibodies is lacking. It is

249

unknown if this is a problem with the antigen being used or the formulation of the assay itself.

250

Using 15 commercially available POCTs, we demonstrate variation in test performance of these

251

assays as well as cross-reactivity with other viral antibodies. Using longitudinal samples from

252

patients with documented COVID-19, the findings indicate optimal sensitivity approximately

253

three weeks following onset of symptoms.

254

The panel of POCTs evaluated had a combined sensitivity and specificity for IgM and IgG

255

between 55%-97% and 80%-100%, respectively. AllTest, Premier Biotech and Wondfo have

256

been previously evaluated.[21,25,29–31] Our performance results are similar to these previously

257

reported values, except for Wondfo, which had a lower sensitivity and specificity [55% (95% CI

258

38%-71%) and 96% (95% CI 91%-100%), respectively]. It is unclear as to why the values

259

differed.

260

Of the tests evaluated, only the CoronaChek, Premier Biotech, and Sensing Self assays did

261

not generate a false positive response on our panel of 60 samples from individuals known to have

262

been infected with other respiratory infections. Our data demonstrated that samples from patients

263

infected with other coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43) are more prone to cross-

264

reactivity than those infected with influenza A, B, or C, parainfluenza, HIV, rhinovirus and

265

enterovirus. Cross-reactivity with other viral antibodies has been reported for other SARS-CoV-

266

2-specific IgM and IgG antibody immunoassays.[21,25] Whitman and coworkers performed

267

cross-reactivity controls with 10 POCTs by testing samples from individuals that tested negative

268

for SARS-CoV-2 and/or had other viral and inflammatory illnesses.[21] The evaluated POCTs

269

were prone to cross-react against viruses other than SARS-CoV-2, but no consistent pattern was

270

identified.

271

The immunologic response to SARS-CoV-2 infection begins as early as a couple of days

272

273

COVID-19, seroconversion occurred in 64% of individuals by 14 days, similar to previous

investigations.[13,24,32–34] After seroconversion, IgM levels have been shown to decline and

275

are almost undetectable by the seventh week post-onset symptoms, while IgG levels persist past

276

the seventh week.[13,35] In our study, we also observed an increase in IgM and IgG detection in

277

the first two weeks post-onset of symptoms, and less seroreactivity to IgM among convalescent

278

plasma donors whose samples were tested approximately a month and a half after symptom

279

onset. We did observe a sample from a convalescent donor that was IgG negative for all assays

280

evaluated (15 POCTs and Euroimmun ELISA), highlighting that not all infected individuals

281

generate detectable antibody responses.

282

The limitations to our study included the lack of early infection samples from non-

283

hospitalized patients. Additionally, specificity analysis needs to be performed on hundreds if not

284

thousands of samples to determine factors associated with misclassification and to give better

285

precision of the point estimate. Furthermore, the samples evaluated were from the Baltimore-

286

Washington region of the United States and may not reflect performance of these assays in

287

different parts of the world. Future studies should include samples from different regions of the

288

world, where the underlying host genetics and common viral infections vary to determine the

289

robustness of POCT performance.

290

different assays in combination, which test different target antigens of the virus should be

291

evaluated, as such methodology has proven highly effective for testing other infections such as

292

HIV.

Additionally, studies using testing algorithms applying

293

The current “gold standard” test for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is RT-PCR. RT-PCR has

294

disadvantages, including cost, lengthy turn-around-times, and preanalytical variability.

295

Additionally, the sensitivity of this method declines past the first week after onset of

296

symptoms.[33,36] POCTs could be used in parallel with RT-PCR testing as a supplemental

297

diagnostic tool in patients suspected to have infection who are RT-PCR negative who are more

298

than 14 days from onset of symptoms. Serologic assays also facilitate population level

299

monitoring of COVID-19 exposure. Of note, POCTs should be considered supplemental

300

diagnostic tools, not confirmatory tests.

301

Overall, antibody-based testing shows great promise as an easy and rapid screening method

302

for determining SARS-CoV-2 exposure. However, comprehensive evaluation of these tests

303

should be performed prior to their clinical implementation. If antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 do

304

provide long-term immunological protection, then POCTs could play a pivotal role in the

305

evaluation of protective immunity. In summary, our study provides insight into the performance

306

of a series of POCTs and some of the factors capable of influencing their performance. With

307

appropriate use, these tests have the potential to broaden the reach of testing, and maximize the

308

detection of asymptomatic infected individuals.
