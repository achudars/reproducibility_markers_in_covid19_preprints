Key Points
Question: How variable are the binding-sites of primers/probes used for COVID-19 diagnosis?
Findings: We investigated nucleotide variations in primer-binding sites used for COVID-19
diagnosis, in 93,143 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, and found primer sets targeting regions of
increasingly nucleotide variance over time, such as the Chinese_CDC|2019-nCoV-NP. The
frequency of these variations is higher in Clade-GR whose frequency is increasing worldwide.
Paris_nCoV-IP2, IP4 and WHO|E_Sarbeco performed best.
Meaning: We suggest the use of some sets to be halted and reinforce the importance of a
continuous surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variations to prompt the use of the best primers.
Abstract
Importance: SARS-CoV-2 genomic variants impacts the overall sensitivity of COVID-19
diagnosis, leading to false-negative diagnosis and the continued spread of the virus. Objective:
To evaluate how nucleotide variability in target primer binding sites of the SARS-CoV-2
genomes may impact diagnosis using different recommended primer/probe sets, as well as to
suggest the best primer/probes for diagnosis. Design: We downloaded 105,118 public SARSCoV-2 genomes from GISAID (Sept, 25th, 2020), removed genomes of apparent worst quality
(genome length <29kb and/or >5% ambiguous bases) and missing metadata, and performed an
analysis of complementarity for the 13 most used diagnostic primers/probe sets for RT-PCR
detection. We calculated the N rate and % of genome recovery, with all primer/probe-sets
considering viral origin and clade. Results: Our findings indicate that currently, the Paris_nCoV-

IP2, -IP4 and WHO|E_Sarbeco primer/probe sets for COVID-19, to perform the best
diagnostically worldwide, recovering >99.5% of the good quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes from
GISAID, with no mismatches. The Chinese_CDC|2019-nCoV-NP primer/probe set, among the
first to be designed during the pandemic, was the most susceptible to currently most abundant
SARS-CoV-2 variants. Mismatches encompassing the binding sites for this set are more frequent
in Clade-GR and are highly prevalent in over 30 countries globally, including Brazil and India,
two of the hardest hit countries. Conclusions: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in patients may be
hampered by significant variability in parts of the viral genome that are targeted by some
widely used primer sets. The geographic distribution of different viral clades indicates that
continuous assessment of primer sets via sequencing-based surveillance and viral evolutionary
analysis is critical to accurate diagnostics. This study highlights sequence variance in target
regions that may reduce the efficiency of primer:target hybridization that in turn may lead to
the undetected spread of the virus. As such, due to this variance, the Chinese_CDC|2019-nCoVNP-set should be used with caution, or avoided, especially in countries with high prevalence of
the GR clade.
Introduction
The current COVID-19 pandemic that resulted from the global spreading of SARS-CoV-2 has
shown the importance of fast access to reliable viral detection methods. Indeed, viral
containment measures can only be effective through the fast, broad, and accurate
identification of subjects who carry active infection and may be actively spreading SARS-CoV2. In this sense, the identification and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 cases is one of the most effective
means by which to halt the viral spread and to reduce the number of new cases of COVID-19
(1,2).
RT-qPCR using primer (and probe) sets that target selected regions of the viral genome is the
current gold standard and most common diagnostic tool for SARS-CoV-2. Hence, for high
specificity and to avoid false-negatives, genomic variants need to be taken into consideration
for the primer/probe designs, such that they can avoid target variations that would restrict or
inhibit primer-template interaction during amplification. Due to continuous evolutionary
selection by targeting sites of the viral genome, as well as viral genome drift, the primers and
probes used for SARS-CoV-2 detection, as well as for other related methods like Loop-mediated
isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays or other similar approaches -- should be constantly
revisited in light of emerging genetic variation and fixation.
Here we evaluated the binding sites of the primers/probes most commonly used for COVID-19
diagnosis, among SARS-CoV-2 genomes downloaded from the GISAID database
(www.gisaid.org - as of Sept., 25th, 2020 - deposited since Dec. 2019). This enabled the
investigation of viral genome evolution, diversity and variant-spreading during the COVID-19
pandemics. Our data suggests that the continued emergence of genomic variants in SARS_CoV2 may increase false-negative rates and lead us to recommend that: i) the use of
Chinese_CDC|2019-nCoV-NP-set should be immediately discontinued; ii) more than one
primer/probe-set should be used to reduce the frequency of false-negatives; iii) SARS-CoV-2

genomic variability should be continuously assessed by sequencing as a means of constant
monitoring variations that may affect diagnosis.
Results
We investigated the capability of 13 of the most used primer/probe sets for COVID-19 diagnosis
(Table S1), to recover SARS-CoV-2 genomes from GISAID considering first no mismatches and
also a maximum of two mismatches. After the exclusion of poor quality genomes (<29Kb and/or
>5% of ambiguous ‘N’ bases) or missing metadata, 93,143 genomes remained (88.6%) (Fig. S1).
The places of origin and clades of these viral genomes were also considered and, in some cases,
genomes from distinct locations were clustered (e.g. England and Scotland, merged as the
United Kingdom). Also, only countries/clusters with at least 10 viral genomes available were
evaluated.
The Chinese_CDC|2019-nCoV-NP set displayed acceptable recovery rates in a few countries
from Asia (Fig. 1a and Table S2). Despite this, this set performs poorly in recovering most SARSCoV-2 genomes from GISAID. When no mismatches are allowed, recovery rates below 60%
were obtained for >30 countries on three different continents (South America, Europe and
Asia), including countries with significant burden such as India and Brazil (Fig. 1a). Assuming
that that two mismatches would still allow sensitive amplification, the picture is still worrisome
for most regions of the world (Fig.1b), a finding that reflects expectant evolutionary changes in
this region of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We observe that the variants in the binding site of the
Chinese_CDC|2019-nCoV-NP set are more frequent in the clade GR, allowing recovery rates
(no mismatches) from 80.8% in North America to 33.9% in Oceania (Table S2). Clade O appears
to concentrate variants in binding sites of US_CDC|2019-nCoV_N1 and US_CDC|2019nCoV_N3 sets (Fig. 1a, 1c).
Other primer/probe sets also showed low recovery rates for specific regions, such as HKU-N for
Brazil (total 6 variant positions distributed in primers F, R and the probe); US_CDC|2019nCoV_N1 for Malaysia and Singapore (3 variant positions located in primer F and the probe);
and US_CDC|2019-nCoV_N3 for Bahrain and Kazakhstan (7 variants for primers F, R and the
probe) (Table S3). Caution should be used as the numbers of viral genomes in GISAID are
tremendously biased towards Europe and the US, and the minimum of 10 genomes used here
may not reflect actual viral diversity present in some countries.

for typos and errors in published primer-sequences.
Next, we investigated the temporal prevalence of each clade since the start of the pandemic.
We charted significant fluctuations in clade prevalence and found SARS-CoV-2 clades G, GH and
GR to have increased significantly relative to others, suggestive of positive selection of these
variants (Figure 2). These results however, can also be explained by reduced diagnostic
accuracy as a consequence of the mismatched evolving target sites. Accordingly, genomic
variations should be considered when primers/probes sets are to be selected.
When considering the top-three countries in the world in terms of number of COVID-19 cases
(USA, India and Brazil - Fig. S2) we see that - despite the reduced number of genomes from
Brazil - the proportion of viral clades varies significantly for all these 3 countries. This result
highlights the importance of considering regional and temporal clade structures for selecting
primer/probe sets for diagnosis.

from New York City. Again, most mismatches were seen for the Chinese_CDC|2019-nCoV-NP
set, but we have also observed variations in the binding sites for the reverse primers of the
US_CDC|2019-nCoV_N2 and N3 sets as well as WH_NIC sets (Fig. S3). The most frequent SARSCoV-2 genomic alteration affecting the Chinese_CDC|2019-nCoV-NP corresponds to the 5’-end
of the binding site of the forward primer (3) - a continuous stretch of three nucleotide
substitutions (GGG→AAC). Viral genomes with this variation corresponded to ~13% of the
available SARS-CoV-2 genomes as of 22 March 2020 (3) but have now reached ~64% of GISAID
sequences. This variation found in 88% of a SARS-CoV-2 genome cohort comprised of 640
sequences from Indian patients and in all of 40 recently confirmed cases in São Paulo, Brazil.
These findings provide multiple lines of evidence of these variations and their significant
frequency in patient-derived samples. Whereas a scenario of high/medium viral load may not
lead to false-negatives after diagnosis with this set (as the most frequent variant would affect
the 5’ end of the F-primer), one possibility is that in cases of low viral loads or less efficient
swabbing, Ct values may be shifted above the detection threshold, leading to false-negatives
and a consequent spreading of this variant. While Vogels et al. 2020 (3), argue that the precise
location of this mismatched sequence may not impact COVID-19 diagnosis, the hypothesis
remains to be tested.
The continued evolution of the virus may result in more variants in these binding sites and other
genome regions and, in this case, the continued use of the Chinese_CDC|2019-nCoV-NP
primer-set may increase false-negatives rates. As can be seen from Table S3 other variants in
the binding sites of F and R primers of the Chinese_CDC|2019-nCoV-NP set have also been
detected in our analysis. Furthermore, it is relevant to document that 2/40 cases sequenced in
Brazil showed two additional substitutions, one detected at the 7th nt from the 5’end (C>A) and
the other at the 4th nt from the 3’end (G>T). These changes, which may have stronger impacts
on primer efficacy – especially if combined with the more upstream mismatches, indicate that
nucleotide substitutions continue to accumulate in this genome region. Importantly, none of
these two extra variations have been described in this GISAID-version, further reinforcing the
need to a continuous effort on cataloguing viral genome sequences.
As the identification of subjects carrying SARS-CoV-2 is in itself an important barrier to the
propagation of the virus, we speculate that the increased global spread of viruses carrying this
variant may be a consequence of using primer/probe sets that fail to properly identify positive
cases. It is worth mentioning the early use of the Chinese_CDC|2019-nCoV-NP primer set in
earlier manuscripts (4-7). While mass screening is needed to control the spread of the disease,
the lack of proper detection of viruses carrying some variants will not only result in problems
at individual/community level as well as on a global scale. Moreover, such missed diagnoses
could contribute to the ongoing spread of the virus, increasing the number of new cases and
deaths from COVID-19, and lead to continued pandemic spread due to misdiagnoses.
The variations seen here may impact COVID-19 diagnosis by RT-PCR, but may also impact other
diagnostic approaches such as LAMP (8) and the Ion AmpliSeq™ SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel.
There we observe that a synonymous variation (c.14143C>T; p.Leu4715Leu; orf1ab) in the
binding site of the ORF1AB primer resulted in decreased coverage of this amplicon by 1-2 orders

of magnitude (16/25 samples from a Polish clinical cohort). An analysis of GISAID genomes
showed this variant to be present in 10% of Polish sequences and in about 17% of sequences
from other European countries as well as other continents (Fig. S4)
Conversely, our study also revealed primers that can currently be used with confidence. Using
current data, we found that Paris_nCoV-IP2 and -IP4, and WHO|E_Sarbeco have shown the
best performance in terms of full match to SARS-CoV-2 genomes worldwide, all capturing above
99.5% of the good quality SARS-CoV-2 viruses (Table S4). Importantly, geographic variations
need to be considered and monitored overtime, despite the good performance of these
primers at this time.
Although the currently observed genome variations would not always impact SARS-CoV-2
detection, since partial amplification can still occur, we propose: i) the use of more than one
primer/probe set to minimize false-negative rates; ii) the use of the Chinese_CDC|2019-nCoVNP set to be discontinued; iii) the permanent sequencing surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 genome
around the world, especially from non-primer-biased, environmental samples - allowing viral
genome variant monitoring and the careful selection of the best primers/probes as a means to
reduce false-negatives and disease spreading.

Supplementary Information
Supplementary Note
The WHO_RdRP_R primer contains an error in a degenerate base at position 12 (instead of S C/G – it is certainly a T; see (S1), leading to zero-recovery in our analysis (Fig. 1a). The correction
of this mistake would allow for recovery of 91.19% of GISAID genomes (Fig. S-MCB.1 & S-MCB.2;
see online material for detailed analysis). Extra attention should be given to this as the wrong
primer sequence is still widely found in the literature.
The NIID_2019-nCOV_N_R2 primer appears to have an error/typo even in the erratum where
it is indicated that “The reverse primer (NIID_2019-nCOV_N_R2) sequence should be replaced
with TGGCAGCTGTGTAGGTCAAC. The corrected nucleotide is bold and underlined.” However,
our analysis suggests there to be another typo and the correct primer sequence should be
TGGCACCTGTGTAGGTCAAC (with the previously wrong base marked in bold and underlined).
In order to highlight this discrepancy we performed our searches according to the erratum (S2).
Bioinformatics
Genomes, primers and probes evaluation analyses were performed by running in-house
pipelines. We first downloaded all SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequences (N=105,118) available at GISAID
as of September 25th. After removal of Ns from up and downstream of each virus genome
sequence, only genome sequences with at least 29Kb and a maximum of 5% of N (ambiguous
bases) were used for the alignment of primers and probes. These sequences (N=13
primer/probe sets) were matched against the filtered genomic sequences with the software
bowtie2 (v2.3.5.1) (S3); command line options: --end-to-end --very-sensitive -a ) in paired-end
alignment mode. After, probes sequence from each pair of primers were mapped to each virus
sequence by bowtie2 and then merged with the primer alignments results. Exact proper pair
alignments allowing up to 2 mismatches outside of the last 5bps of the 3’ end of each primer
were considered for further analyses.

Fig. S3

Legend Fig. S3 -Presence of variations in primer-probe regions found from nasopharyngeal (NP)
swab data from New York-Presbyterian and Weill Cornell Medicine patients. Total RNA was
sequenced and viral reads were isolated and assembled from 926 NP swabs (see Butler et al.,
submitted 2020). Eleven variant alleles across binding sites for 13 primer/probe-sets were
detected in viral genomes isolated from patient samples, including patients who exhibited
variants in the coordinates corresponding to binding sites of the Chinese_CDC|2019-nCoV-NP
set including the 3bp stretch of the forward primer (pos 28881-28883) and other variations
along the binding site of this same forward primer (28896) as well as its reverse primer (28968
and 28969), along with variants in the binding sites for reverse primers of US_CDC|2019nCoV_N2 (29218), US_CDC|2019-nCoV_N3 (pos 28747), WH-NIC-N (28373) and the vicinity of
other primers/probes. Color shades correspond to depth of sequencing at each site (low
coverage indicates <= 10 reads covering that site).
