Abstract

22

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may be the main cause of death in patients with

23

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Herein, we retrospect clinical features, outcomes and

24

ARDS characteristics of 75 intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19 in Chongqing,

25

China. We found a 5.3% case fatality rate of the ICU patients in Chongqing. 93% patients

26

developed ARDS during the intensive care, and more than half were moderate. However, most

27

of the patients (55%) supported with high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy, but not

28

mechanical ventilation. Nearly one third of patients with ARDS got an early improvement

29

(eiARDS), and the rate is much higher than the other causes of ARDS in a previous study.

30

Patients with eiARDS had a higher survival rate and lower length of ICU stay. The age (< 55

31

years) is an independent predictor for the eiARDS, and stratification of COVID-19 patients by

32

age is recommended.

Introduction

35

On December 2019, Wuhan (Hubei province, China) reported a cluster cases of unknow cause of

36

pneumonia, which were later identified as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)(1). This

37

contagious disease was caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-

38

2), and was declared to be a worldwide pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) on

39

March11, 2020(2). As of 23 May 2020, a total of more than 5 000 000 cases and 330 000 deaths

40

had been reported worldwide(3).

41

The leading cause of COVID-19 death may be the severe respiratory failure caused by acute

42

respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)(4). Because according to some autopsy results, the lesions

43

are primarily in the lungs, characterized by diffuse alveolar damage. Other organs, such as the

44

heart tissue, have no obvious histological changes(5–7). Previous studies reported that about

45

48.6% of patients with COVID-19 had ARDS, among which 29% patients had died, and the

46

mortality rate increased with the severity of ARDS(8,9). Therefore, it is needed to fully

47

understand the features of ARDS in patients with COVID-19.

48

In this study, we described epidemiology, clinical features, laboratory findings, treatments, and

49

outcomes of intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19 in Chongqing, China, the

50

adjoining areas of Hubei province. And we identified a subphenotype of ARDS – early

51

improvement of ARDS, which occurred in about one third patients, and would predict a

52

favorable clinical outcome.

53

Methods

54

Study design and participants

55

This retrospective cohort study included two cohorts of ICU patients from Chongqing public

56

health medical center and Chongqing three gorges central hospital (Chongqing, China), both of

57

which are designated hospital to treat patients with COVID-19 in Chongqing. Patients who

58

admitted to ICU between Jan 21, 2020 (time of the first patient admitted) and March 15, 2020

59

(time of the last patient discharged in the first wave), were enrolled in our study.

60

Patients with COVID-19 were confirmed by the positive real-time reverse transcriptase–

61

polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens according

62

to the WHO guidance. The severity of COVID-19 was judged according to the Fifth Revised

63

Trial Version of the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Guidance of

64

China(10). Those who met the any following criteria were defined as severe-type: (1) respiratory

65

distress with a respiratory rate over 30 breaths per minute, (2) oxygen saturation ≤93% in the

66

resting state, and (3) arterial blood oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) /oxygen concentration (FiO2)

67

≤300 mm Hg. Those who met one of the following criteria were defined as critically ill-type: (1)

68

mechanical ventilation needed for respiratory failure, (2) shock, and (3) intensive care needed

69

owing to other organ failure.

70

The study was approved by the Research Ethics Commission of the second affiliated hospital of

71

Chongqing medical university, Chongqing public health medical center and Chongqing three

72

gorges central hospital. Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission of the

73

designated hospital for emerging infectious disease.

74

Data collection

75

Both of the two designated hospitals are Grade A hospitals in China, and all the case data can be

76

found in the electronic case system. Epidemiological, demographic, symptoms, underlying

77

diseases, comorbidities, treatments, clinical course and outcome data of the patients were

78

recorded in a spreadsheet. The signs, arterial blood gas analysis, laboratory data, acute

79

physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) and sequential organ failure

80

assessment (SOFA) score were collected at the certain time (Day0: admission in hospital, Day1:

81

admission in ICU, Day3, Day7 and Day14) for each patient. If there was no question about the

82

case data, the doctor in charge was promptly inquired. As the data collection was completed,

83

another doctor was responsible for checking and integrating. The proportion of pneumonia

84

volume was calculated according to the pulmonary infection assisted diagnosis system (V1.7.0.1)

85

based on the Computed Tomography image.

Definition

87

ARDS was diagnosed according to the Berlin Definition(11). Liver injury was diagnosed

88

according to the following criteria: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 3 upperlimit of normal

89

(ULN) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 3ULN or Total bilirubin (TBIL) > 2ULN,

90

regardless of chronic liver disease(12). Acute kidney injury was diagnosed on the basis of serum

91

creatinine(13). Cardiac injury was diagnosed if the serum concentration of hypersensitive cardiac

92

troponin T (hsTNT) was above the upper limit of the reference range (>14 pg/mL). Time of viral

93

shedding was defined as when two consecutive SARS-CoV-2 PCR assays at least 24 h apart

94

were negative.

95

Statistical analysis

96

SPSS26.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics, IBM Corporation) was used as the statistical analysis tool. The

97

continuous variables that met the normal distribution are presented as mean ± standard deviation,

98

and the independent student’s t test was used for comparison between two groups. The

99

continuous variables that do not meet the normal distribution are presented as the median

100

(interquartile ranges, IQR), and the Mann-Whitney U test was used between two groups.

101

Categorical variables are summarized by using frequencies and percentages, and the

102

the Fisher exact test was used among two or more groups; We performed bivariate analyses to

103

identify the predictors for early improvement of ARDS, variables with a P value < 0.05 in the

104

univariate analysis were entered into multivariate logistic regression analysis. All tests were two-

105

sided and p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

108

From 21 January to 15 March 2020, Chongqing reported 576 new cases of COVID-19, with 6

109

deaths. 75 ICU patients from two hospitals were included in this study, with 48 severe and 27

110

critically ill patients, and 4 death.

111

The comparison of clinical characteristics between these two groups is shown in Table 1. The

112

median age of the 75 patients was 57 years (IQR 25-75), and no bias in the sex ratio. Smoking

113

was more prevalent in critically ill patients (30%) than the severe ones (2%, p = 0.002). 16 (21%)

114

patients had a history of exposure to Hubei province, 24 (32%) patients contacted with patients

115

from Hubei, 17 (23%) patients contacted with confirmed patients in Chongqing, and 18 (24%)

116

patients had no definite epidemiological link. The most frequent chronic medical illnesses were

117

diabetes (27%) and hypertension (19%). The most common symptoms were cough (83%), fever

118

(68%) and dyspnea (57%). 2 (3%) patients were under asymptomatic period before

119

hospitalization, and appeared dyspnea without fever during the stay in hospital.

120

ARDS was developed in most of the patients (93%), and more than half were moderate (Table

121

1). However, most of the patients (55%) supported with high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen

122

therapy, 26 (35%) patients received non-invasive ventilation, and 7 (9%) patients received

123

invasive ventilation. Other supportive treatments included: prone position ventilation in 7 (9%)

124

patients, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in 3 (4%), renal replacement therapy in 3 (4%),

125

and vasoconstrictive agents in 7 (9%). Although bacterial pneumonia was identified by

126

microbiological culture of sputum or alveolar lavage fluid in only 4 (5%) patients, the

127

antibacterial agents were administered to 62 (83%) patients, and antifungal agents in 12 (16%)

128

patients. Liver (25%) was the most commonly injured extrapulmonary organ, followed by

129

cardiac (19%) and kidney (11%). Lymphopenia was a very noteworthy feature in these patients

130

(95%), and lower incidence of leukopenia (25%) and thrombocytopenia (27%) relatively. Anti-

131

viral agents were used in all patients (100%), the combination of Aluvia (Lopinavir and

132

Ritonavir Tablets) and interferon alpha was the most commonly used. Traditional Chinese

133

medicine was used in 65 (87%) patients owing to potential anti-viral and anti-inflammation

134

activity. Glucocorticoids was given to 46 (61%) patients, immunoglobulin to 30 (40%), and

135

thymopeptides to 63 (84%).

136

Clinical course and outcomes

137

The clinical course and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in Chongqing are shown in Table

138

2. Chongqing reported 6 deaths of COVID-19 up to 15 March 2020, with 1.04% mortality in all

139

576 patients. Because 2 patients were died in the emergency department, only 4 dead patients

140

with clinical data were included in our study, with 5.3% 28-Day case fatality rate and 1.3% 28-

141

Day mechanical ventilation dependency in ICU patients. The duration from any initial symptoms

142

to diagnose confirmed by PCR test was 5 days (IQR 2-7), to hospital admission 7 days (IQR 4-

143

8), to ARDS 7 days (IQR 6-10), to ICU admission 8 days (IQR 6-11), to ventilation 10 days

144

(IQR 7-14), to viral shedding 20 days (IQR 16-26), and to death 16 days (min 15, max 28). The

145

length of ICU stay was 13 days (IQR 9-19) and hospital stay 22 days (IQR 16-34).

146

Early improvement of ARDS

147

Learned from the clinical practice, we found a large group of ARDS patients would be improved

148

in one week, we defined these patients as early improvement of ARDS (eiARDS). 56 patients

149

who had ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 < 300mmHg) on the first day of ICU admission (Day 1) were

150

included for analysis. We defined two groups based on the severity of illness on Day 7 (Fig. 1A):

151

“eiARDS” patients PaO2/FiO2 ≥ 300mmHg, “Non-eiARDS” patients PaO2/FiO2 < 300mmHg.

152

18 patients got an eiARDS, accounted for nearly one third of the 56 ARDS patients. There are

153

not significantly differences between the two groups in the PaO2/FiO2 on Day 1 (Fig. 1B), the

154

proportion of pneumonia volume on Day 1(Fig. 1C), and the rate of ventilator usage (2 = 2.46, p

155

= 0.117). Predictably and regrettably, all of the 4 dead patients did not get an early improvement

156

of ARDS. What’s more, patients of “eiARDS” stayed shorter in ICU than the “Non-eiARDS”,

157

with 10.5 days (IQR 8, 16) and 18 days (IQR 13, 22) respectively (p = 0.001) (Fig. 1D).

158

In order to determine the factors associated with eiARDS, we performed a bivariate analysis. As

159

shown in Table 3, 3 variables (Age, Temperature and hsCRP) with p < 0.05 in the univariate

160

analysis were chosen for multivariable analysis. Age (< 55 years) was the only variable

161

independently associated with eiARDS, with an odds ratio of 7.4 (95%CI: 1.80-31.08).

162

Indicating that patients younger than 55 years old are 7.4 times more likely to get an early

163

improvement of ARDS than older ones.

164

Discussion

165

In the present study, we found that the mortality of COVID-19 in Chongqing was 1.04%, and the

166

28-Day case fatality rate of ICU patients was 5.3%. ARDS was developed in 93% ICU patients,

167

and the HFNC was the most commonly used oxygen therapy. An early improvement of ARDS

168

was occurred in about one third patients, and patients younger than 55 years old would be more

169

likely to do this.

170

Mortality of COVID-19 varies widely in different periods and areas. In the early stage of

171

outbreak, Wuhan reported 4.3% mortality in hospitalized patients(14), and 61.5% in critically ill

172

patients(15). However, the mortality of ICU patients gradually decreased to 32.5-38.5% as time

173

elapsed(16,17). This happened to be 26% in Lombardy Region, Italy(18) and 50% in Seattle

174

Region, America(19). In the present study, we found that only 5.3% case fatality rate of ICU

175

patients was occurred in Chongqing. The big differences of the mortality probably due to

176

whether the medical resources can be timely supplied, including heath workers and hospital

177

beds(20). As a matter of fact, a huge number of health workers from other provinces have been

178

aided to Hubei province, with consecutively increased acute care beds(20). Similar to the model

179

of Hubei, as the first cluster cases of COVID-19 was detected in Chongqing, 4 designated

180

hospitals were arranged and prepared for patients with COVID-19 only, and also the medical

181

experts from different hospitals in Chongqing. The centralized dispatcher of medical resources is

182

the key experience of treating COVID-19 in China.

183

ARDS is the key factor to affect the mortality. According to the Berlin definition, stages of mild,

184

moderate, and severe ARDS were associated with increased mortality (27%, 32% and 45%

185

respectively)(11). Studies have shown that ARDS was one of the risk factors of death in patients

186

with COVID-19(15,21). Many efforts have been attempted to treat ARDS. However, only

187

mechanical ventilation was showed to be effective therapeutics(22). Interestingly, in our present

188

study, although 93% patients had ever suffered ARDS, only 35% patients received non-invasive

189

ventilation, and 9% patients received invasive ventilation. The most commonly used oxygen

190

therapy was HFNC, which counted for 55% (despite patients may receive both HFNC and

191

ventilation), seemly meaning that HFNC is effective for COVID-19-induced ARDS. Similar

192

conclusions can be observed in a previous review(4). The authors hold that HFNC is suitable for

193

COVID-19 patients with mild ARDS, and even safe for moderate and severe patients, which is

194

clearly inconsistently with the stratified treatment strategies of ARDS caused by other factors(4).

195

In our present study, we found nearly one third patients with ARDS recovered in one week,

196

which we defined as an early improvement of ARDS (eiARDS). However, this eiARDS can be

197

found in only 18% patients with mild ARDS caused by other factors, with 36% patients

198

persisting and 46% worsened in the first week after ARDS onset(23). It is worth mentioning that,

199

why so many patients with COVID-19 got an eiARDS and why HFNC oxygen therapy was so

200

effectual for these patients? There is a voice should be considered. Gattinoni et al.(24) proposed

201

two types of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia: “non-ARDS,” type 1, and ARDS, type 2.

202

Although both types of patients meet the ARDS Berlin definition, but the severe hypoxemia in

203

type 1 patients is associated with nearly normal respiratory system compliance, which can lead to

204

ventilation/perfusion mismatch(24). Assuming that type 1 pneumonia would improve quicker

205

than the type 2, it appears to be able to explain the above problems. In addition, Gattinoni et al

206

proposed that the gas volume and percentage of non-aerated tissue can be clearly distinguished

207

by CT scan between type 1 and type 2 pneumonia. However, there was not any differences in the

208

proportion of pneumonia volume between “eiARDS” and “Non-eiARDS” in our study.

209

Regardless of the reasons why the proportion of eiARDS was so high, paying attention to

210

eiARDS itself is clinically meaningful. Early or rapidly improving ARDS always associated with

211

a better surviving or outcomes(23,25). For COVID-19 patients, early improvement in

212

oxygenation was associated with being discharged alive from the ICU(21). We found that

213

patients with eiARDS had a higher survival rate and lower length of ICU stay than the “Non-

214

eiARDS”. Dynamic observation of ARDS in the short term is very worthwhile for the prognosis

215

of COVID-19, and patients whose ARDS did not improve in one week should be given more

216

attention.

217

One might point out that whether it is because most patients had mild ARDS at baseline, so it is

218

easier to reach eiARDS. But the fact is that, in the baseline, 38.8% patients were under moderate

219

ARDS, and no significantly differences were shown between “eiARDS” and “Non-eiARDS. In

220

other words, the initial PaO2/FiO2 was independently associated with eiARDS. Indeed, multiple

221

studies have shown that older age (> 65 years) is one of the risk factors of death in patients with

222

COVID-19(15,26–28), and establishing risk stratification through age (> 60 years) maybe

223

helpful to clinicians(29). Similar underlying mechanisms may be found in regard to the effect of

224

age to death and the development of ARDS. Nevertheless, age should be given high attention

225

during the management of COVID-19 patients.

226

Limitations

227

This study has several limitations. First, based on the retrospective study design, the laboratory

228

tests (except arterial blood gas analysis, which performed each day) may not be performed in all

229

patients at a specific time, and the missing data was replaced by the values within latest 2 days.

230

Second, although the treatment strategies of the two hospitals followed the guidelines issued by

231

the Chinese National Health Commission, some of the treatments are different, such as the

232

composition of traditional Chinese medicine, which may cause different clinical outcomes.

233

Third, the sample size is relatively small, part of the conclusions needs to be verified by multiple

234

centers and larger sample size.

235

Conclusions:

236

In the present study, we described the epidemiology, clinical features, laboratory data,

237

treatments, and outcomes of ICU patients in Chongqing, China. We found that the case fatality

238

rate of ICU patients in this region was only 5.3%, and the timely supplement of medical

239

resources and oxygen therapy based on HFNC may be the reasons for this low fatality rate. In

240

addition, we identified a new subphenotype of ARDS – the early (in one week) improvement of

241

ARDS (eiARDS), which occurred in about one third of ARDS patients with COVID-19,

anticipating a favorable clinical outcome. The age (< 55 years) is an independent predictor for

243

the eiARDS, and stratification of COVID-19 patients by age is recommended.
