On 31st December 2019, a pneumonia case of unknown etiology from Wuhan City, Hubei
Province, China was reported to the World Health Organization (WHO), which was later
confirmed as a novel coronavirus and named ‘2019-nCoV’ [1] (renamed as ‘COVID-19’ after
one month [2]). As of 11th February 2020, 44,653 confirmed cases and 1,113 deaths have
been reported in China, and approximately 75% of (33,366) confirmed cases and >95%
(1,068) of deaths were from Hubei province [3]. Preliminary studies have suggested that
2019-nCoV is much more infectious but less deadly [4,5] than the Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). 2019-nCoV is
capable of human-to-human transmission even during its asymptomatic incubation period (37 days [6]). On 23rd January, the Chinese government initiated an unprecedented public
health measure to confine the epidemic by locking down 13 cities in Hubei province,
preventing movement of its population by terminating most forms of transportation [7,8]. We
provide a brief analysis of the population impact of the lockdown on the 2019-nCoV
epidemic by investigating various scenarios of ‘delayed’ or ‘no lockdown’ based on a
mathematical model (Appendix).

Overall, the lockdown may partially halt the spread of the epidemic in Hubei province. In the
status quo, as the lockdown remains effective when this article is written, we assume the
lockdown will last for three weeks based on the official schedule of the working day. The
lockdown has effectively shut down most forms of transportation, both public and private, we
estimate the number of person-to-person contacts per day among its residents has reduced
from thirteen to ten. The percentage of facial mask usage in public space has also drastically
increased to almost 100% in Hubei province during the lockdown. However, the increase
may be due to people’s perception of the severity of the epidemic, rather than the lockdown
itself. After the lockdown period of 21 days, we assumed the person-to-person contact rate
will return to normal but mask usage will retain. With these assumptions, we forecast that the
number of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases will reach its peak of 12,143 (5,872-19,852)
individuals at 27 (23-36) days (i.e., 17 Feb [14-27 Feb]) after the lockdown initiation (Figure
1c). The trend will then gradually decline and the cumulative number of infections and death
cases in Hubei province will reach 128,960 (39,362-218,560) and 4,381 (1,667-7,095) at the
end of the epidemic (Figure 1a), corresponding to a fatality rate of 3.44% (3.19-3.70%). On
contrast, if the lockdown has been delayed for seven days, we may observe a larger number
of confirmed cases at peak (18,095 [8,618-28,274]), the total infections (169,030 [53,238284,820]) and deaths (5,905 [2,254-9,556]). Further, if the delay has been 14 days, the

epidemic will peak at 25,194 (11,634-39,667) confirmed cases and the total infections and
deaths will reach 210,400 (66,785-354,020) and 7,451 (2,784-12,118), respectively. In the
case where no lockdown was in place, the epidemic will peak at 36,544 (13,919-61,243)
confirmed cases and the total infections and death cases will reach 348,750 (84,140-613,360)
and 11,076 (3,408-18,744), respectively. This suggests that the current lockdown strategy
may eventually prevent 219,790 (44,773-394,800) 2019-nCoV infections and 6,695 (1,74111,650) deaths, that is, 62.53% (59.98-65.08%) of infections and 59.91% (56.87-62.95%)
deaths, compared with no lockdown. We observed a small re-bounce in the number of latent
individuals when the 21-day lockdown is lifted (Figure 1b). However, this re-bounce does not
fully account for the return influx of the ‘travel rush’ and cannot determine if a second
epidemic will follow.
We present a timely evaluation of the impact of ‘lockdown’ on the 2019-nCov epidemic in
Hubei province, China. The implementation appears to be effective in reducing about 60% of
new infections and deaths, and its effect also appears to be sustainable even after its removal.
Delaying its implementation reduces its effectiveness. However, the direct economic cost of
such a lockdown remains to be seen and whether the model is replicable in other Chinese
regions remains a matter of further investigation.
