Abstract
We have undertaken a piece of rapid analysis of the most recent COVID-19 weekly
rates to examine commonalities across areas with rates exceeding twice the national
average. Our preliminary findings point towards an association between higher case
rates and deprivation with implications for health inequalities. Furthermore, we also
observed an association between higher case rates and lower rates of vaccination.
More analysis is needed to further explore these linkages and help fuel what should
be an urgent narrative around the need to tackle health inequalities in the COVID
era.

Introduction:
It is promising and positive news that funding is being provided to local areas to
reduce vaccine inequalities (1). This is a welcome step for attempting to reduce
some of the health inequalities associated with COVID-19. However, vaccination
rates are not the only variable associated with the variation in COVID-19 rates
across local authority areas in England.
We have undertaken some rapid analysis of the latest weekly COVID-19 rates (4
March 2021) at lower tier authority level (2). Our aim was to explore some of the
commonalities across areas that have more than twice the average overall
population COVID19 rate in England or twice the rate for over 65s which were 103
cases per 100,000 and 69 cases per 100,000 respectively.
Findings
We have used the latest population data (mid-2019) (3) to estimate the proportion of
the population currently vaccinated with at least one dose across lower tier authority
areas. We must insert a caveat here – these percentages are based on mid-2019
data, which will clearly be out of date. However, if we assume steady population
growth, it is still valuable to use these rates for comparative purposes.
It appears that there are differences in vaccination rates between areas with higher
and lower numbers of cases (4). On average, in areas with COVID-19 rates ≥206 per
100,000, the population vaccination rate is 30.3%. Across all other lower tier
authorities, the average is 31.85%. We also looked at the corresponding statistics for
over-65s. In areas with COVID-19 rates of ≥139 per 100,000 in over-60s (over twice
the case rate for England for over-60s), on average 92.27% of the population aged
over 65 has been vaccinated. Across all other areas, the average is 93.46%.
However, when it comes to comparative deprivation, the results are starker.
In order to compare COVID-19 rates with deprivation rates in lower tier areas, we
used the most recent (2019) Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) data, which contains
a subset looking of domains relating to health deprivation and disability (5). In areas
with COVID-19 rates ≥206 per 100,000, the average IMD score is 24, while in the

remaining areas* the average score is 20 (4). The difference is more remarkable
when it comes to those areas with higher rates of COVID-19 in the over-60s. In
areas with COVID-19 rates of ≥139 per 100,000 in over-60s, the average IMD score
is 28, while the average for all other areas is 19.
The same disparity can be seen when we only look at those IMD domains that relate
to health deprivation and disability. The scale for this runs from – 2.63 in the Isles of
Scilly (the best scoring area) up to 1.64 in Blackpool (the worst scoring area) (5).
Across areas with rates ≥206 per 100,000, the average score is 0.35. Across all
other areas, the average score is -0.14. Again, the difference is more noticeable
when we examine the disparity between areas with higher and lower rates in the
over-60s age group. In areas with COVID-19 rates of ≥139 per 100,000 in over, the
average IMD score for health, deprivation and disability is 0.45. Across all other
areas, the average is -0.15.
We examined test rates as a potential alternative explanation for differences in
COVID-19 rates across areas and found that there are differences between the
average number of tests in higher and lower case rate areas (6). In areas with
COVID-19 rates ≥206 per 100,000, the average number of tests per 100,000
population is 396; in the remainder of areas, it is 369.
However, this pattern is not reflected when we look at areas with higher case rates in
the over 60s. In those areas, the average number of individuals tested per 100,000
people is 363, vs 369 across the other areas. Additionally, none of the areas we
looked at (the highest case rate areas for the whole population or the over 60s) fell
into the list of top 25 areas for testing rate per 100,000 people.
Furthermore, there seems to be something of a north-south divide. Out of the eight
areas with rates ≥206 per 100,000, 75% of these are in the Midlands (4 in the East
Midlands, 2 in the West Midlands) with the remaining two areas situated in the East
of England. None are in London, which is interesting and unexpected given that
London is such a large urban centre with complex transport systems and plenty of
potential for transmission. Of the 11 areas with rates of ≥139 per 100,000 in over60s, 63% (7) are in the Midlands and 27% (3) are in the North (North West and
Yorkshire). Again, none are in London, although one area is in the South East

(Slough). The latest data available show that between 22nd – 28th February 2021,
COVID-19 admissions to hospital and diagnoses in hospital were highest in the
Midlands (1,368), the North East and Yorkshire (1,126) and the North West (857) (7).
Discussion
Our findings carry a worrying message around health inequalities. The BBC has
recently highlighted that there is a risk that COVID-19 will become a ‘disease of the
poor’ (8). Their report highlights that people in poorer areas are less likely to have
the vaccine, and that there is a higher death rate from COVID-19 in poorer areas of
England. In this report, the Director of Public Health for Lancashire stated that the
combination of lower vaccine uptake and higher infection levels in poorer areas
could result in inequalities perpetuating for years to come. Furthermore, the recently
published Marmot COVID Review (9) focused on COVID-19 concluded that there is
a high mortality rate in Black, Asian, and ethnic minority groups because of structural
racism in society leading to adverse social and economic conditions for these
groups.
When considering disparity in COVID-19 rates across areas, we must not fail to
recognise that there are structural societal inequalities operating here. Work is
needed to tackle these deep-seated health inequalities that perpetuate with each
intergenerational cycle. We note with interest that the Association of Directors of
Public Health (ADPH) has recently drawn attention to the need to address health
inequalities as part of the new Health and Care Bill (10). As the UK exits the
pandemic and move into the endemic phase and the public health system gets back
to ‘business as usual’, a renewed focus on health inequalities would be a positive
and energising starting point.
*Buckinghamshire has been removed from the analysis as there are no IMD data.
Furthermore, some areas for which IMD data are provided have no corresponding
COVID-19 data (Aylesbury Vale, Chiltern, Wycombe, and South Bucks).
