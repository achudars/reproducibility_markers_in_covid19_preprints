Abstract

COVID-19

pandemic

resulted

in

considerable

morbidity

and

mortality.

We

analyzed

345

Electrocardiograms of 100 COVID-19 patients admitted to our tertiary care center in Detroit, during the
initial month of Covid-19.

Findings were correlated with mortality, cardiac injury and inflammatory

markers. Our cohort included 61% males and 77% African Americans. The median age and BMI were 66
years (57-74) and 31

kg/m² (26.1-39), respectively.

We

observed

atrial arrhythmias in 29%

of the

patients (17% new onset), First degree heart block in 12%, ST-T segment changes in 17%, S1Q3T3
pattern in 19%, premature ventricular complexes in 23%, premature atrial complexes in 13%, Q waves in
27%, T wave inversion in 42% of the cases. While presence of premature atrial complexes or left atrial
abnormality correlated with mortality (P = 0.02 & 0.03, respectively), other

findings did not show

significant correlation in this small cohort of patients.

COVID-19

pandemic

resulted

in

considerable

morbidity

and

mortality

(1).

We

analyzed

345

Electrocardiograms of 100 COVID-19 patients admitted to our tertiary care center in Detroit, during the
initial month of Covid-19.

Findings were correlated with mortality, cardiac injury and inflammatory

markers (Tables 1, 2S &3S supplementary index).

For our analysis, categorical and continuous variables were reported as frequency or percentage and
mean ± standard error (SE) or median ± interquartile range, based on the normality of the data. Baseline
demographics

and

comorbidities

between

groups

were

compared

using

the

Pearson

χ²

test

for

categorical variables and one-way linear regression for continuous variables (Table 4S supplementary
index)

Our cohort included 61% males and 77% African Americans. The median age and BMI were 66 years (5774) and 31 kg/m² (26.1-39), respectively. History of Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus, Cancer and lung
disease was present in 71%, 40%, 15% and 26% of the patients, respectively. 12% had coronary artery
disease, 10% had Systolic heart failure and 12% had history of atrial arrhythmias at baseline. The median
hospital stay was 10.4 days (6.7-16) with 48% mortality.

We observed atrial arrhythmias in 29% of the patients ( 17%

new onset ), First degree heart block in

12% (6% were transient) , ST-T segment changes in 17% , S1Q3T3 pattern in 19%, Premature ventricular
complexes (PVCs) in 23% , premature atrial complexes( PACs) in 13%, Q waves in 27%, T wave inversion
in 42% of the cases . Long QTc (> 470 in males, >480 in females) was noted in 37 cases, of whom 20
patients were on Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin. There was no correlation between long QTc
and mortality (P = 0.5).

Myocardial injury due to hypoxia and direct viral tissue invasion, sympathetic hyperactivity secondary to
the cytokine storm and drug induced QTc prolongation are postulated mechanism of arrhythmias in
COVID-19 cases (2)

Transient complete heart block was previously reported (3, 4).In our cohort, only first degree heart block
was present without higher grade block.

S1Q3T3 pattern, possibly due to cor pulmonale, was reported in 2 Covid-19 cases (4). It was noted in
19% of patients in our cohort and did not correlate with mortality (P = 0.4)

ST elevation without obstructive coronary artery disease was reported in COVID-19 patients (5). We
noted 8 cases of ST elevation, of which 5 were transient and 8 cases of ST depression. None of these
patients underwent coronary angiogram during hospitalization. ST segment changes did not correlate
with mortality (P = 0.5)

Premature

complexes

are

possibly

explained

by

the

higher

sympathetic

tone,

vasopressors

use,

electrolyte abnormalities and myocarditis. Right ventricular outflow tract was the most common site of
origin (47% of cases).

While PACs correlated with mortality (P = 0.02), PVCs correlation didn’t reach

and can be a helpful diagnostic tool for underlying cardiac pathologies.
