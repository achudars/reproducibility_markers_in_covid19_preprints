Abstract: Reproduction number is an epidemiologic indicator that reflects the contagiousness
and transmissibility of infectious agents. This paper aims to estimate the reproduction number of
in the early phase of COVID-19 outbreak in Vietnam.
Keywords: Reproduction number, COVID-19, Vietnam
Introduction
Reproduction number is an epidemiologic indicator that reflects the contagiousness and
transmissibility of infectious agents. Understanding the reproduction number is crucial for
predicting the transmission of an infectious diseases and evaluating the effectiveness of control
measures.
There are several ways to estimate the reproduction number, including mathematical modeling
of compartment models or through the serial interval of the infection chain [1,2]. The estimation
of reproduction number by compartment models is heavily based on several assumptions, such
as a homogeneous mixing of the fixed population [3]. The parameters, including incubation
period, and infectious period are often not available with novel infectious disease line COVID19. Alternatively, estimation of reproduction number by the mean and standard deviation of
serial interval, which is the range between primary and secondary symptom onset dates is an
uncomplicated approach.
Methods:
We collected data on confirmed Covid-19 cases in Vietnam from multiple sources. The master
list of Covid-19 cases was compiled from the official new releases of Ministry of Health
(available on the website http://ncov.moh.ncov.vn). The first two Covid-19 cases were described

by Lan et al. [4]. Latterly, 11 confirmed cases from one northern Vietnam province were
published [5]. Epidemiologic history from data was combined with the master list.
We construct a network and make plausible cases of infectors and infectees, and there by
estimate the discrete distribution of serial interval from the chain of infections. We assumed that
the serial interval follows the discrete gamma distribution. The reproduction number was
estimate by the growth rate of the epidemiological curve and the mean and standard deviation
(SD) of the gamma distribution. We used R 3.6.4 software [5] for data analysis and modeling.
Package incidence [6] was used to create incidence object. The serial interval distribution and
early reproduction number was estimated by package earlyR [7].
Results
From 20 Jan 2020 to 24 March 2020, there was 123 cases confirmed with positive SARS-CoV-2
was reported in Vietnam. The epidemiologic trend of Covid-19 relatively divided into two periods
Figure 1. The first period started from 17 Jan 20 to 11 Feb 2020. In this period, 9 of 16
confirmed cases were imported. The network of these 16 cases and chain of infections was
constructed (Table 1). We estimated the mean of discrete gamma distribution of serial interval
was 5.83 and SD was 3.58.

The mean estimated reproduction number of Covid-19 in Vietnam until 05 Apr Mar 2020 was 1.1 (median
1.11, 95%CI 0.98 – 1.26, 1000 bootstraps) (Figure 2)

Discussion
Using publicly reported data, we applied a simple model to estimate the reproduction number of
early stage of COVID-19 outbreak in Vietnam. The mean estimated reproduction number of
Covid-19 in Vietnam until 05 Apr 2020 was 1.11. With the early response and active control
measures of Vietnamese government, including mandatory isolating patients and suspected
cases, the reproduction number of COVID-19 in Vietnam is considerable lower than reported in
other countries [2].

It is worth noting that the epidemiologic data, including date of onset, date of positive-confirmed
and contact tracing of first 16 COVID-19 cases in Vietnam were more detailed than latter cases.
The fitted distribution of serial interval of this study is lower than described by Li el al. [9], which
was also used by Zhang et al. to estimate the reproduction number on the Diamond Princess
cruise ship [10].
Nevertheless, the analysis may shed lights on the reproduction number of COVID-19 outbreaks
in Vietnam. The same methods can be applied with more detailed data on the chains of
infection, and get better results and help policy makers monitor and evaluate the effectiveness
of control measures.
