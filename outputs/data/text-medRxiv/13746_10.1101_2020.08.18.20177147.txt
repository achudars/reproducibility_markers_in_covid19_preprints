ABSTRACT
Oxford COVID-19 Database (OxCOVID19 Database) is a comprehensive source of information related to the COVID-19
pandemic. This relational database contains time-series data on epidemiology, government responses, mobility, weather
and more across time and space for all countries at the national level, and for more than 50 countries at the regional level.
It is curated from a variety of (wherever available) official sources. Its purpose is to facilitate the analysis of the spread of
SARS-CoV-2 virus and to assess the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce the impact of the pandemic. Our
database is a freely available, daily updated tool that provides unified and granular information across geographical regions.

Background & Summary
Characterising the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and understanding the efficacy of policy interventions requires a
comprehensive, well-formatted and easily accessible database. The World Health Organisation and the European Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control collect daily statistics about cases and deaths from governmental sources. These aggregated
databases are widely used in research but they lack granularity and context. In addition, several academic institutions have
curated high quality data sets aiming at capturing variables not included in the aforementioned databases: the Coronavirus
Resource Center at John Hopkins University1 , the Real-time Case Tracker2 , The Economist’s Tracker for COVID-19 Excess
Deaths3 and the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker4 . In constrained research contexts related to the pandemic,
these databases prove to be immensely useful to researchers and policy-makers seeking to understand both the causes of the

spread and the efficacy of public health interventions. Linking such heterogeneous data is vital to understanding the context
which gave rise to the observations and to making inferences at a finer spatial resolution. However, the process of linking
relevant data across these sources is complex and requires great care.
The OxCOVID19 Database aims to link different modalities of data, reported at the national and regional level, including
epidemiological information on COVID-19 (confirmed, deaths, recovered, hospitalised, etc.), government response (school
closing, economic measures, etc.), mobility (e.g., change in mobility trends of humans in various places), weather (e.g.,
temperature, humidity, precipitation, etc.), socioeconomic statistics and value surveys (Figure 1). The database uses an
established spatial index GID5 , which spans several administrative levels. Wherever possible, the OxCOVID19 Database
draws upon official government sources, work by university-based or government research groups and data from peer-reviewed
scientific papers. The data are provided with the different granular spatial level thereby facilitating a better understanding
of how regional characteristics inform the spread of the disease. Well-linked and granular data of this type can enable the
construction of more accurate models of the pandemic by allowing reliable estimation of the required parameters for relatively
small regions, avoiding the process of averaging them on a country level. They also increase our understanding of the efficacy
of various interventions at the state and regional levels. Thus, we hope this resource in combination with mathematical
modelling and machine learning for data analytics will enhance our understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic and facilitate
the development of strategies to reduce the impact on society. Some of the key questions which the OxCOVID19 Database
can help to answer include the assessment of the effectiveness of different types of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as
government lockdowns, mobility restrictions, and social distancing in reducing the spread of infections6 .

Methods
Data Sources
All the data available in the OxCOVID19 Database are collected from publicly available sources including scientific reports7 ,
government press releases, briefings, and similar. For the epidemiological data we relied mostly on official government
sources including websites and repositories from Ministries of Health, regional Public Health Authorities, university research
groups and official social media accounts. Government response data comes from the Coronavirus Response Tracker as2/14

sembled by researchers from the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford4 . For mobility data, we used
Community Mobility Reports by Google8 and Mobility Trends Reports by Apple9 . The meteorological data (available from
January 1, 2020 onwards) have been made available by the UK Met Office Global Weather Data for COVID-19 Analysis10 .
The socioeconomic statistics and demographics data come from various sources generously made available by the World
Values Survey11 , European Values Study12 , and the World Bank13 . A full and updated list of data sources is maintained on
https://github.com/covid19db/data.
Unifying the data across geographical regions
The OxCOVID19 Database links multimodal data for different levels of administrative division. The largest administrative
subdivision of a country will be called the “first-level administrative division”, “first administrative level”, or “Level-1” (e.g.,
“states” in the USA or “voivodeships” in Poland). The next smaller regions will be described as the “second-level administrative
division”, “second administrative level” or “Level-2” (e.g., “counties” in the USA, “powiaty” in Poland); similarly “third-level
administrative division”, “third administrative level” or “Level-3” (e.g., “gminy” in Poland). Not every country has a third level
(e.g., the USA), some countries do not even have a second level, but we include these where available.
We link data from multiple sources and various levels of administrative subdivision into one relational database using the
GID from the Global Administrative Areas (GADM) database as a geographical identifier5 . The goal of the GADM database is
to “map the administrative areas of all countries, at all levels of sub-division”. It is freely available for non-commercial use as is
the case here. The GID identifies a geographic area with an alphanumeric string. For example, the string ’CHN.16.4_1’ can be
decoded as follows: the first three letters are the ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code for Mainland China; the ’16’ indicates the
Level-1 subdivision, here the province of Jiangxi; the ’4’ represents the Level-2 division, here Jingdezhen City; finally, the
’_1’ indicates a version number for the GID, which only changes in the event of major internal reorganisation and allows for
backwards compatibility. To each GID a polygon is associated giving the boundaries of the geographical area to an extremely
fine resolution. A dedicated table named ADMINISTRATIVE_DIVISIONS contains the GIDs together with their place names
and locations, expressed both as a single point and as a polygon. The resolution of the polygon is reduced from that given in
GADM in order to conserve space.
Every record, insofar as possible, is matched to a GID or a list of GIDs. This allows the user to match different modalities
of data together using GIDs, including across hierarchies. While GID could potentially be used as the main geographical key in
our database, we have chosen to introduce some redundancy and use names (as standardised in GADM5 ) of the regions along
with their GIDs for ease of use as well as to permit the exceptional absence of GIDs.
Typically, assigning a GID to the region referred to in a record is a straightforward matter. Slight inconsistencies with
spelling variations, prefixes, and suffixes can sometimes be an obstacle to carrying out a direct text match, but this requires
only limited and obvious manual adjustment. Some records lack the geographical specificity needed to assign a GID, such as
where the administrative subdivision is listed as “Unknown”. There are, however, more challenging situations, often relating to
administrative reorganisations which have taken place since the release of GADM 3.6. These are best demonstrated by means
of example.
Handling of boundary changes – some examples

(i) In UK-England, some local authorities (Level-2 units) have undergone boundary changes, with Level-3 units being moved
between or promoted to Level-2 units. Each local authority is therefore easily expressed as a list of Level-2 or Level-3 units.
(ii) A similar situation has occurred in Colombia: The Level-1 Department of Cundinamarca (COL.14_1) contains the
Capital District, Bogotá, known in GADM as Santafé de Bogotá (COL.14.79_1). However, Bogotá in fact has the status of
an independent department. We can still express both Bogotá and Cundinamarca excluding Bogotá by lists of Level-2 GIDs.
Unfortunately, Cundinamarca excluding Bogotá contains 114 Level-2 regions. But, we still express it accurately since any
alternative would involve a geographical overlap in reporting and possible ambiguity.
(iii) Norway: A reorganisation of counties (Level-1 units) in Norway resulted in several mergers. However, there were also

some minor boundary changes. It is possible, as with Colombia, to express all units as lists of Level-2 GIDs. However, it would
be extremely cumbersome, and unlike the case of Colombia it is not necessary to avoid geographical overlap, and would result
in little gain in accuracy. For simplicity, lists of Level-1 units are used.
New organisational schemes – some examples

Where there has been wholesale reorganisation or reporting takes place according to an organisational schema which is not
composed of administrative divisions, the situation is less easily handled.
(iv) UK-Scotland: The reporting regions in Scotland are local health boards, which are not compatible with the administrative
units, which are local authorities with Level-2 GIDs. We have endeavoured to represent the health boards as accurately as
possible with GIDs.
(v) Latvia: The reorganisation of regions in Latvia resulted in much smaller regions which are not included in GADM. The
cities and municipalities of Latvia cannot be associated to GIDs.
Epidemiology
While our goal is to collect epidemiological data on the regional level for as many countries as possible, we initially sought to
prioritise countries to include. To determine priority levels we incorporated three criteria: total population, air traffic volume,
and number of COVID-19 related deaths. All countries were ordered according to each of the three criteria on 5 May 2020 and
the ranks of countries with respect to each criterion are added to give the priority score (ie, we used a Borda count).
The top 20 countries according to this rank at the time of prioritisation were: United States, China, India, Brazil, United
Kingdom, Indonesia, Germany, Turkey, Japan, Spain, Ireland, Russian Federation, France, Italy, Mexico, Pakistan, Belgium,
Canada, Iran, Nigeria. We have successfully included regional data for all but Turkey and Iran in the database. At the time of
writing, 41 countries have been included at level-1, of which 6 countries are present at level-2, with the United Kingdom at
level-3.
Aggregation of weather variables
The WEATHER table is composed of 47 meteorological variables obtained from the UK Met Office10 . The variables provide
information about temperature, sunshine, humidity and precipitation. This information is sampled daily and reported on a 12
km × 12 km uniform latitude-longitude grid.
To provide these data in a manner which permits linking with the other tables, we report the mean value for each variable
across all grid points contained in Level-1 and Level-2 GADM subdivisions, along with the standard deviation and the number
of grid points in the region. We report on a daily basis starting from 1 January 2020.
This level of subdivision was chosen on the basis that almost all Level-2 regions contain a grid point. Where the region
contains no grid point, no record is created. This, however, happens in fewer than 0.5% of the cases. Using Level-3 instead
of Level-2 would result in a large number of missing records, while using Level-1 would be overly coarse leading to high
standard deviations and reduced explanatory power. Further, values for larger geographical units can be obtained by the user by
averaging over the smaller subdivisions taking into account the number of points in each region.
World Bank data

The World Bank Development Indicators dataset13 are an easily accessible set of country-level indicators including economic characteristics (like GDP), quality of healthcare and other metrics. Each record includes an alpha-3 country code
(equivalent to GID) allowing them to be linked to our database. Naturally, not all time series are complete for all countries. For ease of use we provide the latest reported values for all indicators. For the full list of available indicators see
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/.
Value surveys

We have extracted a number of indicators from the World Values Survey11 and European Values Study12 including information
on the values and beliefs of people; their trust in government, healthcare and scientific institutions; level of poverty; and similar

socioeconomic, political, and demographic indicators.
The statistics are aggregated and equipped with the appropriate GID both at the country level and at a regional level where
possible. These regions are generally larger than GADM Level-1 and included only for the same 20 countries which were
prioritised for epidemiological data.
Our Integrated Values Surveys dataset is obtained by merging together all fully released waves of the World Values Survey
and the European Values Study. There is no official release of this integrated dataset – we merged it following the official
guidelines14 making appropriate adjustments where the guidance has not provided the correct matching.
For each survey question, we report the frequency of each answer. Because each possible answer generates a column,
the resulting table has more than 15,000 columns. To reduce the size of the table we instead stored all the statistics for each
country/region in a nested dictionary, placed in the column "properties” in the SURVEYS table.

Data Records

cumulative number of deaths through time with two time points (corresponding to 1st of April and 1st of June) indicated by
dashed lines. Panel B: the intervention stringency, which is further stratified by the precise type of non-pharmaceutical
interventions (see [Hal2020]). Panel C: the relative mobility for workplace activity from Google, the dashed line corresponds to
parity with historical values. Panel D: the spatial distribution of the cumulative number of deaths across Italy on the April 1 and
June 1, 2020, which corresponds to the dashed lines in Panel A.

database in CSV format as of 31-07-2020 has been stored under the https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12746150.
Common columns for joining tables
The following columns are used to uniquely identify each record and query the database in order to combine different modalities
of information: (K1) source - an abbreviation indicating the data source; (K2) date - ISO 8601 date (YYYY-MM-DD) of the
record under consideration; (K3) GID; (K4) country - English name for a country as it appears in the GADM database, (K5)
countrycode - ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country codes, (K6) adm_area_1 - specifying first-level administrative country subdivision,
(K7) adm_area_2 - specifying second-level administrative country subdivision, (K8) adm_area_3 - specifying third-level
administrative country subdivision. Note that although (K1)-(K3) uniquely identifies each record the additional columns such
as country, countrycode or different levels of administrative division permit more user friendly means to query groups or
aggregates of the data as necessary. (K6)-(K8) are strings in the Latin alphabet given as they appear in the GADM database
unless the region is not associated with a single GID. In most such cases, it is reported as in the original source. In the case of
an Upper Tier Local Authority of England, such as the Boroughs of Greater London, for the sake of ease of use, divisions are
listed with their names under adm_area_2, with adm_area_3 being NULL.
Administrative Divisions
The ADMINISTRATIVE_DIVISIONS table (see Table 1) contains the geographic features and information associated with
each GID, extracted from GADM5 . It includes six linking columns (K3)-(K8), followed by countrycode_alpha2, the ISO
3166-1 alpha-2 country code, adm_level, specifying which level of division it is, adm_area_1_code, adm_area_2_code and
adm_area_3_code, providing the GID for each higher level administrative division, properties, which includes alternative
names and identification codes and three geometric features: latitude and longitude, specifying the centroid of the region, and
geometry, specifying the simplified boundaries of the region (shapefiles) for mapping purposes.
Epidemiological data
The EPIDEMIOLOGY table includes all eight linking columns, (K1)-(K8), followed by tested - number of tests; confirmed number of confirmed cases; dead - number of deaths; recovered - number of individuals recovered; hospitalised - number
of individuals hospitalised; hospitalised_icu - number of individuals in Intensive Care Units; quarantined - number of
individuals quarantined (see Table 2).
Government response data
The GOVERNMENT_RESPONSE table includes all eight linking columns, (K1)-(K8), followed by a number of indicators
(see Table 3), prepared and curated by researchers from the Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford4 . These
indicators are grouped into the following categories: containment and closure, economic response and health systems, and
miscellaneous policy announcements that do not fit anywhere else.
Mobility data
The MOBILITY table (see Table 4) includes all eight linking columns, (K1)-(K8), followed by a number of indicators of human
mobility as reported by Google8 . These data are derived from aggregated movements of Android phone users and are stratified
by the location of the user: place of work, outdoor parks, recreation areas, grocery markets etc. This table also contains the
change in traffic volume reported by Apple9 from aggregated tracking of iPhone users of people walking, driving or taking
public transit in their communities.
Google measures mobility on any day relative to the median value for each of the five days falling on the same day of the
week in the period January 3 – February 6, 2020, while Apple measures all data relative to January 13, 2020. The data only
describe mobility within particular locations for particular activities. They do not indicate the amount of travel between regions
nor do they contain individual-level data.

Weather data
The WEATHER table (See Table 5) includes all eight linking columns (K1)-(K8) followed by 47 variables including temperature,
sunshine, precipitation, air temperature, wind speed etc.
World Bank
The WORLD_BANK table (see Table 7) includes seven of the eight linking columns (K1), (K3)-(K8) followed by the
indicator_name, indicator_code, value and year. Each indicator name and the corresponding code relate to one of the 1431
features listed at https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/. The original source provides a series of values from 1960 to 2019.
However, here we report only the most recent available value with its year.
Surveys
The SURVEYS table (see Table 6) includes seven of the eight linking columns (K1), (K3)-(K8) followed by samplesize
indicating the number of people taking part in the survey for the region under consideration, properties, which is a dictionary
containing the region/country statistics and wave, specifying the particular survey being reported.

Technical Validation
The code used to build the OxCOVID19 Database was developed collaboratively. Working across several GitHub repositories
(https://github.com/covid19db) allowed us to share documentation and keep code organised and up to date. We encourage the
research community to report any issues they find. Figure 3 shows the system architecture that is being used to collect, unify,
store and share the data. We operate more than 70 fetchers to periodically obtain raw data from our sources. This automated
process ensures that we collect the most recent data and reduces potential error due to manual entry. The “Unification” step
ensures that the names in different tables in the OxCOVID19 Database are consistent across geographical regions. In the
“Validation” step a check for consistency is performed. During the storing step, the last timestamp in input data is compared
with the current time and if the inserted data are older than 14 days relevant warnings are generated as that may indicate the
change in format of the fetched data or some other problem that needs to be fixed. The fetching process is triggered twice a
day at 02:00 and 14:00 BST. The sharing process, namely publishing existing data sources to CSV files hosted on GitHub, is
triggered four times a day.
