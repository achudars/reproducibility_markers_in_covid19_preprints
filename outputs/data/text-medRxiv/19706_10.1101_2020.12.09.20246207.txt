Summary

61

disadvantaged population groups. Here we characterise the differential risk of

62

hospitalisation and death in São Paulo state, Brazil and show how vulnerability to

63

COVID-19 is shaped by socioeconomic inequalities.

64

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study using hospitalised severe acute

65

respiratory infections (SARI) notified from March to August 2020, in the Sistema de

66

Monitoramento Inteligente de São Paulo (SIMI-SP) database. We examined the risk

67

of hospitalisation and death by race and socioeconomic status using multiple datasets

68

for individual-level and spatio-temporal analyses. We explained these inequalities

69

according to differences in daily mobility from mobile phone data, teleworking

70

behaviour, and comorbidities.

71

Findings: Throughout the study period, patients living in the 40% poorest areas were

72

more likely to die when compared to patients living in the 5% wealthiest areas (OR:

73

1·60, 95% CI: 1·48 – 1·74) and were more likely to be hospitalised between April and

74

July, 2020 (OR: 1·08, 95% CI: 1·04 – 1·12). Black and Pardo individuals were more

75

likely to be hospitalised when compared to White individuals (OR: 1·37, 95% CI: 1·32

76

– 1·41; OR: 1·23, 95% CI: 1·21 – 1·25, respectively), and were more likely to die (OR:

77

1·14, 95% CI: 1·07 – 1·21; 1·09, 95% CI: 1·05 – 1·13, respectively).

78

Interpretation: Low-income and Black and Pardo communities are more likely to die

79

with COVID-19. This is associated with differential access to healthcare, adherence

80

to social distancing, and the higher prevalence of comorbidities.

Introduction

89

The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the effects of social inequalities on exposure

90

and death in low socioeconomic groups 1, particularly in Brazil, where it has caused

91

significant mortality 2. Few studies have addressed the uneven impact of COVID-19

92

by socioeconomic status and race 3–5, especially in low and middle-income countries,

93

in part because national surveillance systems seldom collect or report this information

ethnicity) Brazilians 7. Nonetheless, there is still little information on how the differential

96

health outcomes of COVID-19 are shaped by broader social inequalities that

97

determine the capacity to adhere to social distancing and non-pharmaceutical

98

interventions (NPIs).

99

It is paramount to understand the potential social drivers of COVID-19 morbidity and

100

mortality, particularly in countries with high inequality such as Brazil 8. The first COVID-

101

19 cases in Brazil were detected in São Paulo 9, the most populous state and home

102

to diverse racial groups. In the Brazilian context of politically polarised public health

103

responses

104

testing has been limited for low-income populations

105

resolution data sources, we conducted a multi-scale analysis to investigate the risk of

106

hospitalisation and death from severe acute respiratory infections (SARI),

107

predominantly caused by COVID-19 12, by race and socioeconomic status in the state

108

of São Paulo. We examined potential drivers of these inequalities by evaluating local

109

levels of population adherence to social distancing, access to teleworking, and

110

prevalence of comorbidities

In Brazil, higher risk of COVID-19 death has been found for Black and Pardo (mixed

Data Sources

113

Severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and patient information

Patient-level

116

Secretariat SARI hospitalisations database (SIMI-SP)

117

SARS-CoV-2 and is defined by the Brazilian Ministry of Health as flu-like syndrome

118

plus one of the following: dyspnoea, persistent chest pain, or hypoxia. All SARI cases

119

and deaths are notified in the SIMI-SP database, regardless of hospitalisation.

120

We included all SARI related hospitalisations and deaths notified in São Paulo state

121

between March 15 and August 29, 2020. Given that recent data is incomplete due to

122

reporting delays

123

symptoms onset between these dates (epidemiological weeks 10 – 35) (figure 1B).

124

We also included SARI cases with unknown aetiology, as those are likely related to

125

COVID-19 but not lab-confirmed due to low rates of COVID-19 testing in Brazil 15 and

126

socioeconomic bias in testing 12.

127

Zip code information was only available for cases reported in São Paulo state. Data

128

was geocoded using the patient’s self-reported home address or postal code with

129

Galileo (www.img.com.br) and Google API. Information on the health facility where

130

each case was notified was linked to the National Registry of Health Facilities (CNES),

131

which includes information on the mode of health care provision (public and private).

132

The race of patients was partially self-declared and partially identified by a health

133

professional. Race was categorised as either “White”, “Black”, “Asian” (East or

134

Southeast Asian), “Pardo” (mixed ethnic ancestries with diverse skin colours)16 or

135

Indigenous. Race information was missing for 53 480 (23·9%) of retrieved SARI

136

cases, and were imputed using the racial distribution of the census tract of residence

139

were recorded, they were not considered in our analysis.

140

Socioeconomic data

141

We obtained data on municipality-level socioeconomic factors from the latest

142

population census (2010) compiled by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and

143

Statistics (IBGE). We selected household income per capita, population density, and

144

income inequality (Gini Index). We also determined the proportion of residents with a

145

primary education or lower, employment-to-population ratio, and the proportion of the

146

working population without a formal labour market contract or social security. The road

147

network distance from the centroid of each census tract to the nearest healthcare

148

facility was computed considering all facilities that hospitalised SARI patients via the

149

public healthcare system (SUS). Information on employment status and comorbidities

150

during the epidemic was retrieved from the National Household Sample Survey

151

(PNAD COVID-19), a national telephone survey conducted by IBGE with over 1 888

152

560 interviews between May and September 2020. Details are described in

153

Supplementary Appendix A.

154

Daily mobility and non-pharmaceutical interventions

155

To assess local-level adherence to social distancing, we used daily mobile phone data

156

provided

157

Metropolitana de São Paulo (greater metropolitan area of São Paulo: RMSP). This

158

data was aggregated using a hexagonal grid based on the global H3 index at

159

resolution 8. Each cell has an edge of approximately 460 meters and an area of 0·74

160

km2 (https://h3geo.org/docs/core-library/restable). For each H3 cell, the social

161

isolation index was measured as the number of people who did not leave their cell of

162

residence during the day, divided by the number of residents in that cell. Each mobile

163

phone was assigned to an H3 cell based on the owner’s location of residence during

164

the evening and their previous travel history. The racial composition and income level

165

of each cell were determined using dasymetric interpolation (Supplementary Appendix

166

A).

167

We also used municipality and state-level data on NPIs from a continuous survey

168

conducted between May 13 and July 31, 2020 19. The survey had 13 questions related

169

to the implementation and easing of social distancing measures, and responses were

170

obtained from 612 mayors in São Paulo (94·8% of the total).

171

Data analysis

172

Probability of hospitalisation and death

173

We conducted an individual-level analysis to estimate the probability of reporting a

174

SARI hospitalisation given a patient’s race and average income level in their census

175

tract of residence. Census tracts were grouped by quantiles of income per capita into

176

six categories as presented in the results. Similarly, we determined the probability of

177

death from SARI given a patient’s race, income, and administrative type of the health

178

facility where the patient was hospitalised (public or private). Both probabilities were

179

standardised by age and sex to account for demographic differences between groups.

180

They were calculated for every month between March and August 2020. Probabilities

181

for each age-sex group were estimated empirically using relative frequencies. Odds

182

ratios using White patients and the highest income level as reference groups were

183

computed. Confidence intervals were calculated using bootstrapping. Details are in

184

Supplementary Appendix A.

185

Seroprevalence by socioeconomic status

186

To assess the broader risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection beyond hospitalisation, we

187

analysed seroprevalence data collected as part of the national Covid-IgG study 20 from

188

blood donors aged 16 – 69 living in São Paulo city

189

We calculated the proportion of individuals by education and race category with

190

detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies between February and October 2020.

191

Socioeconomic drivers and hospitalisation risk

192

An ecological spatio-temporal regression analysis was conducted at the municipality

193

level for São Paulo state (n = 645 municipalities) to assess the monthly risk of

(Supplementary Appendix A).

194

hospitalisation and its association with socioeconomic factors between March 1 and

195

August 29, 2020. To further understand the association between socioeconomic

196

conditions and COVID-19 risk, we conducted the same analysis at the census tract

197

level (n= 30 815) for the RMSP, where the majority of cases were concentrated. The

198

relative risk of hospitalisation was estimated using a hierarchical Bayesian model

199

composed of a generalised log-linear model with spatially structured and unstructured

200

random effects to account for spatial autocorrelation and time-varying random effect.

201

The spatial structure is characterised by population movement between municipalities

202

from March 1 to August 15, 2020 defined by In-Loco mobile geo-location data

203

summarised elsewhere

204

covariates, and diagnostics can be found in Supplementary Appendix A.

205

Social adherence response to NPIs

206

We used an event study design

207

changed their daily mobility levels in response to the introduction and relaxation of

208

NPIs in the RMSP. We compared changes in mobility patterns of the population living

209

in H3 cells with predominantly White versus predominantly Black or Pardo residents,

210

as well as of the population living in areas of the wealthiest and poorest income

211

quintiles. The daily social distancing index from hexagons were regressed on a set of

212

relative time dummies that indicated the number of days before and after the first NPI

213

introduction in São Paulo state. Hexagon-fixed effects controlled for unobserved time-

214

invariant determinants of social distancing, while day-fixed effects controlled for

215

temporal shocks common to all hexagons. We further included an additional time-

216

varying control variable, representing the number of days relative to the first confirmed

217

SARI case in each hexagon, and a dummy variable indicating the period of NPI

218

relaxation in each municipality. Sensitivity analyses were performed and discussed in

219

Supplementary Appendix A.

220

We employed a multinomial logistic regression to estimate the probability that

221

employed individuals would be working face-to-face, teleworking, or taking paid or

224

employment occupations listed in the PNAD COVID-19 survey were aggregated to

225

226

Organisation. We further disaggregated health professionals and health technicians

(Supplementary Appendix A – Table A2).

228

Comorbidities

229

PNAD COVID-19 data was used to conduct a binomial logistic regression to estimate

230

the odds ratio of having at least one comorbidity, by race and education attainment

231

(pre-primary, primary, secondary, and tertiary), while controlling for age and sex for

232

São Paulo state. The comorbidities considered were chronic obstructive pulmonary

233

disease (COPD), diabetes, hypertension, or cardiovascular disease such as

234

myocardial infarction, angina or heart failure. Confidence intervals for the odds ratios

235

were calculated taking into account PNAD’s complex sample design.

236
237

Results

238

Between March 1 and August 29, 2020, São Paulo state had the highest number of

239

SARI hospitalisations per 100 000 habitants compared to all states in Brazil (figure

240

1A). A time series illustrating the number of SARI hospitalisations is presented in

241

figure 1B. During this time, 232 540 patients were notified in the SIMI-SP database

242

(figure 1C), from which 230 794 (99·2%) had a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis or were

243

diagnosed with SARI of unknown or missing aetiology. From these, 223 455 were

244

hospitalised (98·4%) or died without hospitalisation (1·6%). From the non-hospitalised

245

cases, we only selected deaths; 54 108 patients died, of which 52·5% were White,

246

20·2% were Pardo, 6·13% were Black, 1·96% were Asian, 0·052% were Indigenous

247

and 19·6% did not have race information. We geocoded 178 345 (79·8%) of all SARI

248

cases considered in our analyses with high accuracy at either street address, route,

249

or neighbourhood level without compromising personal privacy.

250

During the first month of the COVID-19 epidemic (March) in Brazil, hospitalised

251

patients were more likely to be White or Asian and come from census tracts with higher

252

income per capita (figure 2A and 2B). During this period, people living in low-income

253

areas, compared to high-income areas, were less likely (OR: 0·44, 95% CI: 0·42 –

254

0·46) to be hospitalised with SARI. This coincides with the early establishment of

255

COVID-19 and its first cases in higher-income travellers returning from overseas 9,12.

263

As the epidemic progressed from April onwards, patients were also more likely to be

264

from low-income census tracts (April to July, OR: 1·08, 95% CI: 1·04 – 1·12), except

265

for August, when patients were less likely to be from low-income census tracts (OR:

266

0·95, 95% CI: 0·91 – 1·00). Similarly, Black Brazilians and Pardos became more likely

267

to be hospitalised with SARI than Whites (OR: 1·37, 95% CI: 1·32 – 1·41; OR: 1·23,

268

95% CI: 1·21 – 1·25, respectively), while Asians became the least likely to be

Once hospitalised, Black and Pardo patients were more likely to die from SARI than

279

White patients (OR: 1·14, 95% CI: 1·07 – 1·21; 1·09, 95% CI: 1·05 – 1·13,

280

respectively) (figure 2C). This difference was more pronounced in March and was

281

reduced over time. We found that patients living in the poorest census tracts were

more likely to die from SARI compared to patients from the wealthiest tracts (OR: 1·60,

283

95% CI: 1·48 – 1·74) (figure 2D). Likewise, patients treated in public hospitals were

284

more likely to die than patients treated in private hospitals throughout the epidemic

285

(OR: 1·40, 95% CI: 1·34-1·46) (figure 2E). Racial differences in the probability of death

286

decreased when considering only patients hospitalised at public health facilities but

287

persisted among patients in private facilities (Supplementary Appendix B – figure S2).

288

To understand the geographical variation in SARI hospitalisation, we predicted and

289

mapped the relative risk of SARI hospitalisation for São Paulo state by month via a

290

model with a spatial structure defined by human movement fluxes derived from

291

anonymised mobile phone data (figure 3A) and covariates related to socioeconomic

292

status (figure 3B). This is shown in figure 3C. We found a lower risk of hospitalisation

293

in municipalities with high income per capita (fixed effect = -0·93, 95% CI: -1·17 – -

294

0·69) and high proportion of adult residents with a primary education or lower (-0·80,

295

95% CI: -1·0 – -0·60). Municipalities with fewer nearby public health facilities were

296

also found to have lower risk of hospitalisation (-0·24, 95% CI: -0·45 – -0·03). We also

297

found a higher risk of SARI hospitalisation in municipalities with higher population

298

density (0·24, 95% credible interval: 0·04 – 0·44).

305
306

We found that over time, the risk of SARI hospitalisation increased particularly in

307

municipalities near and within the RMSP, where 70% of the SARI cases reported for

308

the state are concentrated (figure 4A). By mapping risk at the census tract level for

309

the RMSP, we detected increasing risk starting from São Paulo city (central region).

310

By June, almost all of the census tracts in and near the city centre were found to have

311

high relative risk, but this risk decreased by August.

312
313

Differential risk to SARI in the RMSP was also associated with daily mobility levels by

314

disadvantaged groups. Before the implementation of NPIs on March 13, mobility levels

315

were similar across all socioeconomic groups (figures 4B and 4C). However, 14 days

316

after the introduction of NPIs, isolation levels were 8·2% (95% CI: 7·2% – 9·2%) higher

317

in predominantly White areas compared to predominantly Black areas. Similarly, 27

318

days after the introduction of state-level NPIs, isolation levels were 11·2% (95% CI:

319

10·6% – 11·9%) higher in the wealthiest than in the poorest areas. Overall, we

320

detected a decreasing trend in isolation levels over time, and the magnitude of the

321

differences in social isolation levels between areas with predominantly White and

322

Black populations decreased to only 4·4% (95% CI: 3·3% – 5·5%) 151 days after the

323

introduction of the NPIs (figure 4D).

Finally, we investigated the differential risk to SARI based on workers’ position in the

336

labour market using data from the PNAD COVID-19 survey. After the introduction of

337

NPIs, workers employed in low-skilled jobs or essential services were more likely to

338

keep working face-to-face than workers in professional or managerial positions

(Supplementary Appendix B - figure S3). Workers with pre-primary education were

340

more likely to work in occupations that require in-person contact than workers with

341

tertiary education (Probability: 0·89, 95% CI: 0·87 – 0·90 compared to PR: 0·58, 95%

CI: 0·57 – 0·60) and less likely to work in occupations that allow teleworking (PR:

344

(figure 5A). When controlling for education and formal or informal employment, we

345

found no substantial difference between racial groups in the probability of working

346

face-to-face or teleworking (figure 5B).

347

We found that population groups at risk of death from SARI were also more likely to

348

have comorbidities. Compared to the population with tertiary education in São Paulo

349

state, individuals with primary education or lower are more likely to have one or more

350

comorbidities (OR: 1·36, 95% CI: 1·27 – 1·45) (figure 5C). Similarly, Black individuals

351

were also more likely to have one or more comorbidities than White individuals (OR:

352

1·29, 95% CI: 1·19 – 1·39) (figure 5D). Odds ratio estimates for each health condition

are summarised in Supplementary Appendix B – figure S4.

Discussion

363

Our study shows that disadvantaged hospitalised groups are disproportionately more

364

likely to die from SARI. We find that the differential health outcomes can be explained

365

by structural inequities linked to the incidence of comorbidities and to socioeconomic

366

status, which limit the ability of these groups to socially isolate and reduce their access

367

to optimal health services.

368
369

Social and racial inequalities shape the risk of SARI hospitalisation and death. After

370

the initial phase of international imports in Brazil 12, Black or Pardo Brazilians residing

371

in low-income areas were more likely to be hospitalised and die with SARI compared

372

to White individuals, which aligns with recent findings 7. Our assessment of anti-SARS-

373

CoV-2 antibodies in blood donors categorised by demographic background further

374

confirms that Black Brazilians and those with lower socioeconomic status are

375

disproportionately exposed to COVID-19. While patients hospitalised in public health

376

facilities were more likely to die than those in private health facilities, racial inequalities

377

in death probability are attenuated when only considering patients within hospitals of

378

the same type, either public or private. Potential factors influencing this inequality

379

include higher comorbidities among poor Black patients and the lower access to

380

private care among low-income individuals that are disproportionately Black.

381
382

We found higher hospitalisation risk for those living in municipalities with low income

383

per capita and high population density compared to the rest of São Paulo state. These

384

populations mainly reside in the RMSP, which contains nearly half of the population

385

in São Paulo state and where bias in testing is evident in regions of lower

386

socioeconomic status

387

hospitalisation is particularly elevated in São Paulo city, where seroprevalence

388

estimates from blood donors show that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were highest in

389

older Black Brazilians and those with lower educational attainment.

(Supplementary Appendix B – figure S5). The risk of SARI

390
391

We show that inequalities in the risk of SARI hospitalisation were partially explained

392

by differential mobility responses to social distancing guidelines, similar to the US

393

In wealthier and predominantly White neighbourhoods, people were able to isolate

394

faster and sustain isolation for long periods of time. Among the working population,

395

low-income and Black workers were less likely to receive a furlough from work or

396

telework. Due to systemic inequalities in education and the labour market, these

groups are disproportionately employed in precarious job positions with no social

398

security and dependent on day-to-day income

limiting their ability to reduce

402
403

Our study has limitations that may have underestimated the level of inequality. Firstly,

404

geocoding cases may have discarded patients from poor census tracts where

405

accuracy is limited

406

levels has inherent limitations due to ecological fallacy and the modifiable areal unit

407

problem 25. Finally, the 2010 Brazilian population census and PNAD COVID-19 survey

408

may have limited the capture of socioeconomic changes in the last decade and

409

inclusion of extremely wealthy individuals

410

be underrepresented in health administrative records because of their lower access

411

to healthcare. Given that São Paulo is the wealthiest state and has the most robust

412

healthcare system in Brazil

413

severe in other states.

24.

Secondly, using data aggregated for various administrative

27,

26.

Additionally, disadvantaged groups can

it is possible that the impact of inequalities is more

414
415

Our findings on the difference in risk of SARI death reveal stark inequalities in access

416

to healthcare. Only 25% of Brazilians have access to private healthcare via health

417

insurance, reflecting how inequality in access to quality healthcare is largely driven by

418

income

419

underfunded public healthcare system, which highlights that disadvantaged

420

populations are more likely to be infected and deprived of care. Strengthening

421

healthcare access and its capacity will be critical for reducing health inequities during

422

this and forthcoming public health emergencies 29.

28.

This leaves 75% of the population solely reliant on a chronically

424

Our findings on socioeconomic risk factors could help guide vaccine allocation in

425

diverse settings to achieve equitable access. Ensuring that disadvantaged groups,

426

especially those that have in-person occupations and live in crowded and deprived

427

areas receive vaccination will help prevent and slow down community transmission.

428

While race is not a risk factor in itself, it is critical to consider systemic inequalities that

429

lead Black and Pardo communities to be overrepresented among low socioeconomic

430

groups, to have higher rates of severe COVID-19 infection, and comorbidities that

431

exacerbate their risk of death. Therefore, including disadvantaged populations among

432

priority groups for vaccination could help reduce health inequities instead of

433

exacerbating them 30.

434
435

Our study highlights the need for additional research to comprehend the effects of

436

social and health inequalities during pandemics. Firstly, an assessment of the

437

inequality in access to quality care within public and private health facilities and its risk

438

factors is needed to better understand mortality in different hospital settings. Secondly,

439

our study shows that population response to NPIs can vary significantly based on

440

social circumstances, suggesting that future studies should also consider

441

socioeconomic aspects when evaluating the effectiveness of NPIs. Thirdly, more data

442

is needed on whether social safety net programs that are guaranteeing income for

443

disadvantaged groups during the pandemic (e.g., Brazil’s emergency cash payment),

444

may have enabled people to reduce their mobility. Nevertheless, our study has shown

445

the impact of social inequities on COVID-19 hospitalisation and death, thus informing

446

future research and policies related to the health impacts of COVID-19 in Latin

447

America.
