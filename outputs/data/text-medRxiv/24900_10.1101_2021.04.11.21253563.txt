Introduction
The Ongoing infections of COVID-19 have created a global health burden and public health
problems in many countries .1 COVID-19 was announced as a global pandemic on March 11,
2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). COVID-19 is a highly contagious virus
causes mild to severe respiratory tract infections.2 In the United Arab Emirates (UAE),
changes in the health care system have been adapted to the public health needs caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, health care providers are making remarkable efforts to
control additional outbreaks of the disease .1 Health care providers are the frontline during
COVID-19 with higher risk of exposure to and acquiring COVID-19 infection, this may
exposed them to mental distress causing anxiety, depression and emotional stress.
Providing direct care to patients with COVID-19, or being required to undergo quarantine or
isolation, may lead to psychological distress in health care providers .3 Qualitative data in
UAE frontline staff showed Covid-19 related stress, arising from working in hazard
environment and the trauma from amount of death initially.4Infectious disease outbreaks are
likely to affect the psychological health of healthcare workers (HCWs) practicing in the front
lines of the pandemic .5Initial evidence that a considerable proportion of HCWs experienced
mood and sleep disturbances during the outbreak, justifies the recommendation to establish
methods to mitigate mental health risks and adjust interventions under the conditions of the
pandemic.6Health care workers contributed significantly to controlling the infectious disease,
in this context psychologist support, mental counselling, and helpline support were provided
to the health care team in United Arab Emirates .The aim of the current study was to examine
the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on the manifestation of depression and anxiety in
HCWs

Methods
Study design, setting, and population
A cross-sectional study was conducted in the United Arab Emirates, among health care
providers from primary health care centers and inpatient hospitals in private and public
sectors. The study was conducted between 11 April to 23 July. Due to the convenient online
distribution of the survey, the heath care provider in Abu Dhabi Healthcare Servies (Seha)
was determined, calculating a margin of error of 5%, and a confidence interval (CI) of 95%.

Survey design
Data was collected using an anonymous online self-administered questionnaire, written in
English. The survey was designed to collect information regarding demographic data of the
participants, including age, sex, occupation, specialty, years of experience, the city and
setting of their practice.
Depression screening was accomplished using the Nine-Item Patient Health
Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 includes nine items, each requiring four responses. Each
response is scored according to the following: not at all=0, several days=1, more than half a
day=2, almost every day=3. The total depression score may range from 0–27. A total score of
0–4 indicates minimal depression, with a score of 5–9 signifying mild depression. A total
score of 10–14 indicates moderate depression, with scores of 15–19, and 20–27,
demonstrating moderately severe and severe depression, respectively.
The Generalized Anxiety Disorder scoring system (GAD7) includes a 7-item
questionnaire. Each item requires four responses, and each response is scored as follows: not
at all=0, several days=1, more than half a day=2, almost every day=3. The total depression
score may range from 0–21. A total score of 0–4 indicates minimal anxiety, with a total score

of 5–9 demonstrating mild anxiety. Total scores of 10–14, and 15–21 indicate moderate and
severe anxiety, respectively.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21 Software program, Descriptive statistics such as
mean, standard deviation (SD) were computed for quantitative variables and frequencies, and
percentages were calculated for categorical variables. Linear and logistic regression analysis
was conducted to determine the determinants. Significant level of p value ≤0.5 was used.
Ethics and confidentiality
All study participants were completely informed about the purpose, methods, time frame, and
their role in the study. Online consent for participation was established prior to enrolment.
The study was approved by the Ambulatory Health care services human ethics committee and
the Abu Dhabi health care service central human Ethics Committee.
The study was conducted in accordance with the Ethics Committee’s guidelines. The
questioner was anonymous to the participants and did not record any identifiers or personal
information of the participants. Confidentiality of the study participants was maintained.
Results
A total of 1,268 healthcare providers responded to the survey, 47.7% of whom (605) were
working in in-patient hospitals, 19.6 % (249) in primary health care practices, and 15.9 %
(202 ) were working in emergency and ICU care settings. This excellent response rate was
achieved during the COVID-19 pandemic, between April 11th and July 23rd, 2020. Majority
of the participants (88.6 % [1,124]) were from SEHA, and only 144 originated from outside
SEHA. Participants derived a mean age of 40.26 years and were mostly female (74.5%).
Nurses constituted 61.9% of the respondents, and 18.4% were consulting physicians,
specialists, and residents. Technicians comprised 14.7% and only 4.9% were pharmacists.
Physicians who enrolled represented various specialties, including family medicine (6.2 %),

internal medicine (7.9 %), Obstetrics and gynecology (8.3 %), Pediatrics (1.1 %), Psychiatry
(1.7%), and Surgeons (9.5 %). Most participants originated from Abu Dhabi and Al Ain (62.5
%, 26.1 % respectively), and 9.9 % of participants hailed from the western region. The mean
work experience was 14.3 years. (Table 1)
Anxiety scores were measured for each of the 1,268 participants of healthcare
providers. Generalized anxiety scores were measured using Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7.
More than half of the participants (51.5%), reported symptoms of anxiety, and almost half of
them (48.48 %) scored in the minimal anxiety category. Mild anxiety was reported in 28.8%
of all healthcare providers, and 12.68 % respondents revealed moderate anxiety scores, with
9.95 % reporting severe anxiety.
Mild and moderate anxiety (22.6%, 9.9%) were noted among female healthcare
providers. Slightly higher severe anxiety (6.8%) was noted among male healthcare providers
although this was not significant.
It was noted that anxiety scores decreased with additional years of experience. Only
3.6% of healthcare providers with more than 30 years of experience reported severe anxiety,
while 16% of HCP with less than 5 years of experience had scores indicating severe anxiety.
Age groups were correlated with anxiety scores among healthcare providers. Scores
indicating more severe anxiety among healthcare provider of less than 30 years of age
(14.5%). Mild anxiety was primarily observed among healthcare provider between 41–50
years of age (31.3%), while moderate anxiety was noted among healthcare providers who
were beyond 50 years of age (16.2%).
Anxiety scores were significantly associated with occupation, p = 0.02. Mild anxiety
affected more than 30% of the Nursing (30.2%), specialist, (32.5%), and resident (36.1%)
occupations. Moderate anxiety was mostly noted among consultants (15.6%), and severe
anxiety was significantly noted among residents (19.4%).

Anxiety scores were significantly associated with specialties, and p value was 0.029.
Mild anxiety affected more than 30% of the Psychiatry (30%) Family medicine (30.4%),
Pediatrics (31.9%), Obstetrics and gynecology, (35.6%) and Internal medicine (36.4%)
specialties. Moderate anxiety was mostly noted among Obstetrics and gynecology (18.3%).
Severe anxiety scores were the highest among Internal medicine (16.2%) specialists (See
Table 2).
Depression scores were measured for each of 1,268 participating healthcare providers.
Depression symptoms were reported in 38.3% of respondents. Most of participants revealed
minimal depression scores (60.3%). Moderately severe depression (4.3%) and severe
depression (2.7%) were both less than 5%. HCPs reported 22.5% and 8.8 % in mild and
moderate depression, respectively
Mild and moderate depression (23.5% and 9.1 %) respectively, were observed more
frequently among females. Moderately severe (6.6%) and severe depression rates (3.5%)
were higher among male healthcare providers. P value was not significant for depression
severity in correlation with healthcare providers’ gender.
Mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression were mostly noted among
healthcare providers aged less than 30 (23.9%, 13.2%, 4.4% and 4.4%). High rates of
moderately severe depression equivalence to that found among younger healthcare providers
(less than 30 years) were also discovered among healthcare providers aged 30–40 (5%), and
41–50 (45%). Mild depression was found in more than 20 % of all age groups included in the
study.
Findings were not significant based on years of experience. Mild depression was the
highest (25.4%) among healthcare providers with 11–20 years of experience. Moderately
severe depression was also the highest (5.5%) among the same group. Severe depression
(5.1%) was mostly noted among healthcare providers with less than 5 years of experience.

For occupation, residents scored the highest in mild, moderate, and severe depression
at 33.3%, 13.9 %, and 5.6% respectively. Moderately severe depression was mostly reported
among Pharmacists and nurses at 4.9% and 4.8%, respectively.
Among different specialties, psychiatry scored the highest in both moderately severe
(10%) and severe (5%) depression categories. For moderate depression, pediatricians
exhibited the highest rate (13.7%) compared to other specialties. Internal medicine and
Obstetrics and gynecology were subspecialties that most reported mild depression and with
similar rates (26.5% and 26.5%). P value was not significant.
Among various practice health care providers working in inpatient based care,
specialists scored highest in the mild , moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression
categories (12% , 4.7%, 1.8 % and 1.1%, respectively). P value was 0.05 (See Table 3).

Linear regression for anxiety score showed it negatively associated with age and
working in primary health care P value of (0.002), (0.005 ) respectively and B= (-0.89) ,(0.08) respectively . Linear regression for depression score showed it negatively associated
with age, p = .000 and B= -0.125. For other sociodemographic variables, no significant
associations were found. (Table 4)
Comparing the anxiety mean score among different resident specialties showed the
obstetrics and gynecology residents exhibited the highest mean score for anxiety ( 20 )
followed by internal medicine 9.8. While family medicine and pediatric had lower score
(3.7).
Similar findings for mean depression score were found to be highest among obstetrics
and gynecology residents (21), followed by internal medicine (8.1). While family medicine,
surgery and pediatric were (3.4, 4.5, 3.5) respectively.

Discussion
The prevalence of depression and anxiety among healthcare professionals in SEHA is high
during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic (38.3 %, 51.5 %) respectively. Results of this
study are supported by systemic review and met analysis, which relieved a pooled prevalence
of anxiety is 23.2%, and a depression prevalence rate of 22.8% although this study revealed
higher anxiety prevalence .6 Similar presence of sever anxiety was detected in another study
conduct in UAE during pandemic , however milder and moderated cases were more in this
study . this can be attributed to different scales used.4 Que J, et al., demonstrated that
prevalence of anxiety and other psychological problems were higher among frontline
healthcare workers, compared with healthcare worker who did not participate in frontline
work .7 This was further demonstrated in the present study, with severe anxiety noted among
healthcare providers within the internal medicine specialty. Additionally, health care workers
in inpatient settings revealed more depression among medical professionals than other
settings.
Males registered more moderately severe and severe depression than females, though
findings do not support the indication that female healthcare and nursing staff reported higher
rates of anxiety and depression than other workers .6
Among respondents, residents experienced the highest rates of severe anxiety and
severe depression, while obstetricians and gynecologists achieved the highest mean score for
depression and anxiety. Psychological support and training are necessary for residents, to
ensure their wellbeing, and intervention is required for obstetrics and gynecology residents.
Initiative-taking measures and mental health support are needed to ensure
psychological wellbeing among healthcare providers.8Although healthcare providers in Abu
Dhabi were supported by numerous measures, including the provision of psychological

counseling, mental health support helplines, psychological motivational online webinar
frontline specialties should receive special attention regarding this matter. Coping with stress
and establishing strategies for resilience, are imperative for health care providers. Abu Dhabi
was rated among the best performing cities in the world with regards to preparedness and
supportive measures among them, the healthcare system. Nevertheless, the mental health of
the healthcare workers seems an area worth investing at with the high depression and anxiety
found. In interventional studies conducted in the United Kingdom (UK), the provision of an
e-package for healthcare workers that includes evidence-based guidance, support and
signposting related to psychological wellbeing was mandated for healthcare employees. 9
This study can be the first step in preparing action plan to support the healthcare workers
mental health, but designing any intervention will need a qualitative study to ensure
successful outcome. Vital component of the disaster management of infectious pandemics is
to address the psychological effects in health care provider.10
Conclusion
HCP experienced a high prevalence of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic,
suggesting that mental health intervention and support are necessary for HCP to ensure the
psychological wellbeing of health care providers.

Limitations of the study
The participants in this study primarily originated from Abu Dhabi city and represent Abu
Dhabi healthcare population. This, therefore, limited the generalizability of the study
findings, although the respondents originated from both, public and private sectors. Social
desirability bias may have occurred, because the questionnaire was self-administered.
However, the anonymity of the questionnaires was maintained. Despite limitations, the study
provides a reasonable source of information. Follow up studies to assess the progression of
the psychological impact of COVID -19 pandemic is needed. No medically recorded review
