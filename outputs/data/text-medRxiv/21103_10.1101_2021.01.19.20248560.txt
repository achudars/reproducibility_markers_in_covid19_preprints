Abstract
Pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are important elements in
the Covid-19 pandemic, and until vaccines are made widely available there remains a
reliance on testing to manage the spread of the disease, alongside non-pharmaceutical
interventions such as measures to reduce close social interactions. In the UK, many
universities opened for blended learning for the 2020-2021 academic year, with a mixture of
face to face and online teaching. In this study we present a simulation framework to
evaluate the effectiveness of different asymptomatic testing strategies within a university
setting, across a range of transmission scenarios. We show that when positive cases are
clustered by known social structures, such as student households, the pooling of samples by
these social structures can substantially reduce the total cost of conducting RT-qPCR tests.
We also note that routine recording of quantitative RT-qPCR results would facilitate future
modelling studies.

quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test has been in widespread use globally

6

for the detection of viral RNA taken from saliva or nasal and throat swabs . One strategy to
reduce the financial cost of regular mass testing is to pool samples

7

- a single test is

performed on a group of individuals, which can optionally be converted into Dorfman’s
algorithm in that if the group tests positive, follow up tests are performed on the individuals

8

in the group to identify those infected . Another benefit of this approach is that pooling
reduces test reagent use, the supply of which may be outstripped by demand. More
complex pooled testing algorithms have been proposed that could offer higher efficiencies

9

but are difficult in practice to implement .

There have been several studies evaluating pooling approaches for RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2
in order to identify cases that may be asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic
programme for pooled testing within universities is now underway

11

9,10

, and a pilot

. In this analysis we

explore the key decisions needed to design an effective test pooling strategy.

Size of the pool
There exists a tension between reducing the cost by pooling samples versus the potential
adverse impact of pooled samples on the sensitivity of the test. In the context of RT-qPCR, if
only one infected individual is present amongst the samples in a pool, the samples from the
uninfected individuals will dilute the viral load within, potentially increasing false negative
rates. The trade off between cost and sensitivity when using Dorfman’s algorithm is strongly
related to prevalence. When prevalence is low, few pools will contain infected samples, and
so the number of pools that require follow-up tests will be low. Hence it will be beneficial to
have pools with relatively large numbers of individuals in this scenario. By contrast, when
prevalence is high, we might expect larger pool sizes to frequently test positive, and so the
number of follow up tests required to identify specific individuals who are infected will be
large. This dynamic can inform optimal pool sizes. A more complex follow up strategy that
starts with large pools and iteratively creates sub pools to minimise testing numbers will
have the disadvantage of a longer lead time between sample collection and test result,
which has practical consequences because informing the infected individual swiftly is of
importance in limiting spread

12

.

Household or contact-based pooling
Another consideration is who is pooled with whom as it is likely advantageous for the test
sensitivity to pool individuals who are close contacts and therefore liable to be all infected
or all uninfected at the same time. In the university setting, a method for reducing social
contacts is to assign students to small ‘living circles’ (e.g. five people per living circle).
Because transmission often occurs in households, we might expect clustering of cases within
living circles. Testing by living circle could improve test sensitivity under the assumption that
if one person is infected then others are likely to be also, thus the dilution of the viral load is
minimised. This pooling strategy could also reduce costs because fewer pools will be
detected as positive than under random pooling, and therefore fewer pools will require
follow up tests to identify infected individuals.

Follow up testing
A third consideration is how follow up of positive pooled samples, to determine which
individuals are specifically infected, impacts overall performance. In the UK this is currently

mandated for positive pooled tests but deserves exploration. If tests are performed by living
circle, then the follow up tests may be rendered largely moot if everyone within a living
circle is expected to self-isolate when any one member of the living circle is tested positive.
However, the impact on behaviour change if only returning pool-level test results to
individuals needs to be quantified, such as whether individuals assume they have been
infected and are immune.

Additional to pooling of samples in RT-qPCR assays, other low-cost screening methods are
emerging. The lateral flow device operates by detecting viral antigens directly
it has been reported to have lower sensitivity compared to RT-qPCR

14,15

13

, and though

it may still be cost

effective, and of sufficiently high overall sensitivity if the test is administered twice over
three days

11

.

At the University of Bristol students within halls of residence are divided into living circles –
groups within which individuals are permitted to mix as if in a household. Here we analyse
the sensitivity and cost of pooling samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing by RT-qPCR within a
university setting to represent a universal testing strategy that would identify asymptomatic
infection. We use data on the sizes of living circles to simulate clustering of infections,
allowing for varying levels of social contacts within and between living circles. We explore
the effects of pool size and living-circle based pooling, follow up testing strategy, and
heterogeneity of viral load between individuals.

Methods
Modelling overview
Our objective is to simulate performing RT-qPCR for presence of SARS-CoV-2 in samples
from all individuals under different disease transmission scenarios. There are four main
components to the model – viral load sampling, disease transmission between students,
pooling allocation of collected samples, and testing performance. We compare different
aspects of testing performance across three strategies – per-individual testing, pooled
testing, or pooled testing with per-individual follow-up in positive pools.

Data
The samples generated in these simulations are allocated into living circles and halls of
residence that match the distributions from undergraduate students at the University of
Bristol. In total there are 8,477 students allocated to 1,529 living circles, divided across 37
halls of residence. The median number of students per living circle is 5, and the maximum is
44. The distribution of students per living circle is shown in

Supplementary Figure 1.

Heterogeneity of viral load and RT-qPCR detection

model based on RT-qPCR mechanics whereby each individual

Transmission model
To generate clustering of cases according to social structures amongst the students, such as
living circles and halls of residence, we use a single time-step agent-based transmission
model to capture transmission that can occur within a week – approximately the serial
interval for COVID-19. At time step 0, a random set of individuals from the total population
is selected to be infected according to some initial prevalence

/0

. The individual

reproduction number, or the number of people each individual goes on to infect is set as

4  /5 6654
Where

4

is the reproduction number. We allow the

4

value to vary across simulation

scenarios. The individuals who are infected are determined by contact patterns and the
level of containment assumed for a particular simulation scenario. We assume that
transmission can occur in one of two contexts: within the same living circle, or anywhere
else. Hence, at time step 1, a new set of individuals will be infected, leading to an updated
prevalence

.

Table 1 lays out the probability that a transmission event occurs in each

context, based on different data sources or assumptions. For the base case analysis, we use
the transmission event probabilities based on the CON-QUEST survey

, and present

Supplementary figure 3.

Testing pool allocation
We adopted two strategies to assign individuals to testing pools. First, we allowed
assignment to be random. Second, we attempted to maximise grouping within test pools
given living circles. The living circle sizes within the University of Bristol vary from 1 to 44,
with a median of 5. However, within each simulation scenario the pool size is fixed (though
we try different pool sizes between simulation scenarios). To maximise grouping of living
circle members within a testing pool we used a simple bin packing algorithm,

binPack from

, which uses a greedy algorithm to maximise pool

occupancy whilst minimising distribution of living circle members across multiple pools.

Note that we assume that the reaction efficiency of the pooled sample is equal to the
lowest efficiency amongst the

samples contributing to the pool, in part to be conservative

in evaluating the efficacy of pooling, and in part on the assumption that efficiency is
adversely impacted by sample impurities.

We assume a diagnostic specificity of 99.5% for a single RT-qPCR test, and therefore the
pool+followup results will have a false positive rate of

0.005

".

The cost of testing was estimated based on consumable costs alone, assuming that
overhead or facility costs would be the same for any model of testing, and that each
laboratory would have sufficient capacity and equipment (nucleic acid extraction and qPCR
instruments, and storage freezers) to conduct the tests. We determined the cost of sample
collection to be £3.47 (comprising of saliva sampling funnel (£1.86; Isohelix), collection tube
(£1.42; Isohelix), storage tube, and pipette tip (£0.19)) and the cost of a PCR test to be
£12.46 (based on 1 extraction using QIAsymphony® (QIAGEN) kits at £4.46 per sample, and
one PCR reaction using the Altona SARS-CoV-2 RealStar RT-PCR Kit 1.0 at £8.00 per sample.

Lateral flow device
For the lateral flow device tests (LFD) we assume specificity of 99.68% and a sensitivity that
is a function of viral load,

We explore the performance of pooling strategies under the following simulation scenarios

Pool sizes are chosen to be 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30, and individuals are allocated to
pools according to their living circles or at random. This results in 486 simulation scenarios,
each of which is repeated 100 times.

Results
Pooled testing volume depends on epidemiological context
A major motivation for a pooled testing strategy is to reduce the financial cost by reducing
the number of assays that need to be performed. In a simple pooling approach that does
not follow-up positive pooled samples to determine the specific individuals infected, this
reduction in costs will be related to the number of samples included in the pool, but results
in all individuals in the pool behaving as if they are infected. However, as is well established,
if positive pools are to be followed up then the total number of tests could drastically

Figure 1), particularly when pool sizes are larger. For

increase when prevalence is high (

example, when initial prevalence is at 5% and the R value is high, a strategy of pool size of
20 comprising random samples will require as many tests as a simpler approach of testing
everybody, if positive pools are followed up for individual testing. However, if we pool
based on living circle in this context where most cases are clustered, then fewer pools will
contain positive individuals, and the number of tests could be attenuated by 15%.

Test sensitivity
The rate at which infected individuals are tested positive varies across the various
simulation scenarios. Pooling samples reduces test sensitivity as expected, but how the
performance depends substantially on the loss is related to clustering of cases, pooling
strategy and prevalence (

Figure 2). Higher clustering of cases reduces loss of sensitivity as

pool size increases, because the dilution of nucleotides is reduced when clustered cases are
pooled together. A similar amelioration of the impact of dilution occurs as the prevalence
increases. The improvement in sensitivity achieved by pooling by living circle is particularly
pronounced when disease transmission is largely restricted to be within living circles, as this
minimises isolated positive cases within pools. The sensitivity of LFD improves substantially
when it is applied twice; however, in most scenarios pooling approaches will outperform the
sensitivity of LFD.

Cost effectiveness of testing strategies
We based the cost effectiveness of a particular strategy on its positive predictive value
(PPV), defined as the probability, given a positive test result, that an individual really has the
disease. PPV is a function of prevalence, sensitivity and specificity.

Figure 3 shows that the

strategy that maximises the PPV to cost ratio varies substantially by prevalence. When
prevalence is low then pooled tests are likely to reduce the proportion of false positives and
therefore can improve on individual based tests. When prevalence is high, the sensitivity is
relatively similar across all strategies, the false positive rate is a small fraction of total
positives, and so the low cost of LFD appears favourable.

Estimating prevalence
Large scale testing can also be valuable as a surveillance tool. We evaluated the accuracy
prevalence estimates for different testing strategies (

Figure 4) and found that individual

tests and pooled tests with follow ups offered good estimates of the prevalence. However, if

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.19.20248560; this version posted January 20, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

pooled tests without follow up were to be used to estimate the prevalence then
assumptions would need to be made about the proportion of samples within a test that are
likely to be positive in order for that to be a cost-effective way of estimating prevalence
accurately.

Discussion
A regular testing regimen across the student body may demand test pooling as the only
viable strategy that financial and reagent resource limits permit. We present a framework
which can be adapted to accommodate changes in estimates of viral load and RT-qPCR
operating parameters, such as efficiency and sensitivity, as these estimates emerge and
evolve. This study illustrates that there are trade-offs to be made in using this approach,
which may require ethical arguments to inform decision making. In particular, reducing
testing costs will incur a modest reduction in sensitivity, and some of the lowest cost
pooling approaches have low specificity which could lead to large numbers of students selfisolating whilst not actually being infected. We note that the current pilot project for
voluntary pooled testing in UK university students places students in pool sizes of up to 5
individuals in a household and follows up any positive pooled samples

11

. This strategy

appears to be the most cost effective across scenarios in our simulations, including when
compared against the LFD.

Pooling samples in a way that is informed by social contacts appears to be an effective
strategy to improve pooling performance but does come at a cost of higher management
and organisational cost at the levels of sample collection and laboratory systems. Clustered
samples may however fall into the same pools without a management layer required, for
example if samples from the same classroom or hall of residence are collected together. In
these simulations we used living circle as a predictor of case clustering, and note that
though it is an imperfect predictor it improves performance over random pooling. Any
management scenario that is able to group individuals into test pools based on shared
exposures (or shared lack of exposures) will likely improve pooling performance above the
random case.

A key limitation of the costing analysis is that the logistics and time required to pool samples
using maximal bin packing was not considered. It’s likely that the most realistic way to
achieve pooling by living circle would be for samples to be submitted together and grouped
within the lab according to when they are submitted. The true cost per PPV of pooling is
therefore likely to be affected by the limitations of implementing pooling. Similarly, practical
considerations within the laboratory infrastructure do place limitations on the complexity of
the sample grouping strategies.

Per-individual follow-up testing within positive pools improves the specificity of test results
but can become costly as prevalence increases. Outbreaks have been seen to be controlled
within university settings (e.g.

27

) which suggests that structural measures are effective and

5

it is unlikely that prevalence will ever be particularly high at any given point . Given that
close contacts of positive cases are advised to self-isolate regardless of their test status,
follow-up testing of positive pools may provide unactionable information when then pools
are composed of social contacts. However, the value of testing the contacts of infected

28

, where it was suggested that

testing of contacts is likely to identify substantially more true negatives than false negatives.

Changes in the ratio of cost of sampling compared to cost of PCR test will affect the
difference in costs between pooling sizes, and if PCR test costs are reduced then the
advantages of pooling will be limited. However, if reagent supply is limited, this may drive
up the cost of PCR tests while also providing further incentive to pool samples.

Our simulations indicate that the LFD has sensitivity and specificity profiles comparable to
those of higher order pooling strategies. Emerging evidence does appear to contradict this
finding, in which it has been suggested that LFD has substantially worse sensitivity than RTqPCR

29

. There are three ways in which our simulations could be over-estimating the

sensitivity of LFD. First, if in practice LFD is routinely performed using self-administered
swabs and RT-qPCR is performed by a trained technician then this will have an adverse
consequence on the sensitivity of LFD. Second, if the viral distribution follows a different
shape to that which we assume, in particular with a large mass in the range of

35,

30 B 

B

then this is the range in which LFD has been suggested to have a substantial drop off in

sensitivity

13

. Third, the relationship between LFD sensitivity and RT-qPCR

biased upwards in reference

13,30

values may be

.

There are a number of limitations to this study. First, we do not have data on the true
heterogeneity of viral load amongst infected students, and higher heterogeneity could have
unpredictable effects on the efficacy of pooling by living circle. If individuals with higher viral
load are more infectious then the pooling of close contacts with those individuals will
potentially increase sensitivity. Second, we used a theoretical framework to infer the RTqPCR sensitivity beyond 10x dilution, and therefore the most reliable pool size within these
simulations is at 10x dilution. However, we note that the projected sensitivity of the test
beyond 10x dilution is in line with sensitivity estimates from experiments published
previously

31

. Third, we only used a simple 2-time-step model to simulate clustering. The

intention behind this approach was to simply obtain different levels of clustering of cases,
but the true extent of clustering is not known. We show that the improvements in
performance of pooling by living circle is attenuated when cases are less clustered
(

Supplementary figure 3), and will tend towards the random pooling values. Additionally, if

tests were performed regularly then one might expect that there will not be enough time
for tertiary infections to occur before infected cases are discovered. Fourth, alternative
viable approaches in addition to RT-qPCR and LFD such as reverse transcription loopmediated isothermal amplification

32,33

have not been modelled here.

In this study our simulation is predicated on the detection of infected individuals. However,
for the purposes of controlling the spread of the disease whilst limiting unnecessary
quarantines, those who have very low viral load are much more likely to be post-infectious
or non-infectious than they are to be pre-infectious

34

. Therefore, approaches such as LFD or

large pool sizes may not lead to substantially higher transmission and yet they could be
substantially cheaper. On the comparison between LFD and pooling RT-qPCR, LFD has the
advantage of being substantially faster, but operationally its sensitivity appears to be lower
than initial laboratory testing indicated

35

. By contrast, pooling of samples in practice may in

fact exceed the sensitivity performance that we assumed in these simulations

31

It is also of note that the new Variant of Concern 202012/01 (VOC), which is thought to have
originated in the UK in late Summer or early Autumn 2020, and which has spread rapidly in
the UK since then (even during the November lockdown), is estimated to be between 1.4
and 1.8 times more transmissible than the original (wild-type) SARS-CoV-2

36

. Early results

suggest that this new variant is associated with significantly higher viral loads in the upper
respiratory tract, than was the case with wild-type SARS-CoV-2

37

. If a higher viral load is

maintained across the infection course, then all tests will gain in sensitivity, and adopting
pooling approaches (or the LFD) will have a reduced adverse impact on sensitivity when
compared against the single RT-qPCR test.

Overall, we show that RT-qPCR pooling strategies are likely to be improved if individuals can
be pooled based on likelihood of joint infection, and this could be achieved by pooling
within known living or contact circles. Though we used student living circles as a basis for
the simulations, the results could extend to households in general. An adaptive strategy,
whereby different pooling schemes are used depending on the estimated prevalence and R
values (e.g. from local authority reporting), could be optimal.
