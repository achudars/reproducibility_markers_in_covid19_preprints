The molecular pathology of multi-organ injuries in COVID-19 patients remains
unclear, preventing effective therapeutics development. Here, we report an in-depth
multi-organ proteomic landscape of COVID-19 patient autopsy samples. By
integrative analysis of proteomes of seven organs, namely lung, spleen, liver, heart,
kidney, thyroid and testis, we characterized 11,394 proteins, in which 5336 were
perturbed in COVID-19 patients compared to controls. Our data showed that CTSL,
rather than ACE2, was significantly upregulated in the lung from COVID-19 patients.
Dysregulation of protein translation, glucose metabolism, fatty acid metabolism was
detected in multiple organs. Our data suggested upon SARS-CoV-2 infection,
hyperinflammation might be triggered which in turn induces damage of gas exchange
barrier in the lung, leading to hypoxia, angiogenesis, coagulation and fibrosis in the
lung, kidney, spleen, liver, heart and thyroid. Evidence for testicular injuries included
reduced Leydig cells, suppressed cholesterol biosynthesis and sperm mobility. In
summary, this study depicts the multi-organ proteomic landscape of COVID-19
autopsies, and uncovered dysregulated proteins and biological processes, offering
novel therapeutic clues.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to more than 20 million infected individuals
and over 700,000 deaths by the middle of August 2020. Morphological
characterization of autopsies, mainly focused on the pulmonary lesions, has greatly
advanced our understanding of COVID-19-caused deaths (Carsana et al., 2020; Su et
al., 2020a; Wichmann et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020).
Mechanistic studies of SARS-CoV-2 infected cell line models (Bojkova et al., 2020;
Bouhaddou et al., 2020; Gordon et al., 2020) offer new insights into virus-perturbed
biochemical processes of COVID-19 and suggest potentially novel therapies. SARSCoV-2 infected mouse models (Bao et al., 2020; Hassan et al., 2020; Jiang et al.,
2020) and rhesus macaque models (Chandrashekar et al., 2020; Deng et al., 2020)
generated by adenovirus transduction of human ACE2 have been established for
preclinical selection of antiviral therapeutic agents and vaccines as well as for
investigating pathogenesis. Few studies have characterized host responses at
molecular level from clinical specimens. We and others have studied the host
responses by proteomic and metabolomic analysis of patient sera (Messner et al.,
2020; Shen et al., 2020a), but molecular changes in infected tissues and
consequentially affected organs remain elusive. To date, little knowledge has been
obtained concerning how SARS-CoV-2 virus induces injuries in multiple organs
(Bian, 2020; Tian et al., 2020; Wichmann et al., 2020) including lung, kidney (Kudose
et al., 2020), liver, heart, spleen, thyroid and testis (Yang et al., 2020), and how to
prevent and revert them.

from COVID-19 patients and reported intussusceptive angiogenesis which may be
induced by hypoxemia (Ackermann et al., 2020). Latest advances of proteomics
technologies allow effective and robust analysis of formalin-fixed tissue samples (Gao
et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2019). Comparative analysis of mRNA and protein expression
in tissue samples showed that proteins measured by mass spectrometry was much
more stable than transcripts (Shao et al., 2019). Here, we report a multi-organ
proteomic profiling of 144 autopsy tissue samples collected from the lung, spleen,
liver, heart, kidney, thyroid and testis of 19 patients died from COVID-19 and 74
control tissue samples from 56 non-COVID-19 patients. Using TMT-based shotgun
proteomics, we quantified 11,394 proteins, out of which 5336 were significantly
dysregulated proteins in at least one organ in COVID-19 patients. This data resource
offers a unique channel to understand multi-organ injuries in the COVID-19 patients,
and nominates potential therapeutics.

We first performed proteomic profiling of 144 autopsy tissue samples from seven
types of organs, namely lung (N=15, n=30; N represents the patient number, n
represents sample number), spleen (N=9 , n=9 from white pulp and N=8, n=8 from
red pulp), liver (N=10, n=24), kidney (N=10, n=18 from renal cortex and N=9, n=16
from renal medulla), heart (N=9, n=19), testis (N=5, n=5) and thyroid (N=15, n=15).
The samples were from 19 COVID-19 cases, ten of which have been described
previously (Wu et al., 2020), compared with 74 control samples from 56 non-COVID19 cases with other diseases via surgeries (Figure 1A, Tables S1,2). All 19 COVID-19
patients died from SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia or respiratory failure, among whom
seven also developed terminal multi-organ failure. Detailed information of patients
including medication history during hospitalization, laboratory test data, pathological
changes, and cause of death are summarized in Tables S1, 5 and Figure S1, 2.
Altogether we quantified 11,394 proteins from the above samples with a false
discovery rate (FDR) less than 1% at both peptide and protein levels (Table S3, Figure
1A). The number of identified proteins ranged from 5828 (heart) to 9544 (kidney)
across seven types of organs. We included 37 technical replicates of randomly
selected tissue samples, as well as 18 pooled controls for each TMT batch (Figure
S3A, Table S2). Proteins quantified in these technical replicates and control samples
showed relatively low median coefficient of variance (CV) of 6.88% and 2.47%,
respectively (Figure S3B, C). A total of 5336 dysregulated proteins were characterized
from the seven types of organs between COVID-19 and control groups (Benjamini &
Hochberg (B-H) adjusted p value < 0.05 and |log2(fold change)| > log2(1.2), Table S4,
Figure 1A). Splenic red pulp samples were excluded from downstream analysis since
they did not show statistically significant proteomic regulations changes (Figure 1A).
Hierarchical clustering of the differentially expressed proteins from each organ type
(Figure S3D) showed that these proteins well separated COVID-19 samples and
controls. The t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding shows that dysregulated

proteomes of each organ type clustered tightly apart from each other (Figure S3E),
consolidating that these selected proteins well resolved different tissue types. Except
testis, the other six tissue types shared only 27 dysregulated proteins, suggesting
different organs responded via diverse pathways. Among them, the acute
inflammatory protein, C-reactive protein (CRP), and the M2 type macrophage highly
expressed marker (Etzerodt and Moestrup, 2013), scavenger receptor cysteine-rich
type 1 protein M130 (CD163) were the most upregulated proteins (Figure 1B),
probably reflecting both the hyperinflammatory and repairing state in patients died
from COVID-19.

We then focused on six clusters of proteins including viral receptors and
proteases, transcription factors (TFs), cytokines (and their receptors), coagulation
system, angiogenesis associated proteins, and fibrosis markers due to their relevance
to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 2A, B). After cellular entry mediated by receptors
and proteases, SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the host translation machinery and induces host
inflammatory response via TFs, leading to hyper-inflammatory state, which might be
associated with the clinically observed blood hypercoagulability as measured by
blood tests (Figure S2), fibrosis and microthrombosis as examined by pathologists
(Figure S1), and enhanced angiogenesis as reported by morphologic and gene
expression examination in the lung of COVID-19 (Ackermann et al., 2020).
Our data showed substantial regulation of TFs in COVID-19 autopsies. 395 out
of 1117 quantified TFs were altered in at least one tissue type (Table S5, Figure S4A),
and they were significantly enriched in spliceosome, viral carcinogenesis, among
others as shown in Figure S4B. By matching the experiential fold-change with the
predicted activation state in IPA, ten of these dysregulated TFs shown the same
change trend, which participate in the hyperinflammation, hypoxia state and tissue
injury in COVID-19 patients (Figure S4A, Supplementary Discussion).
Among the 242 quantified cytokines, 112 were significantly dysregulated and
mapped to angiogenesis, response to growth factor and other pathways (Figure S4C,
D, Table S5 and Supplementary Discussion). Nicotinamide phosphoribosyl
transferase (NAMPT), glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) and interferon-gamma
receptor 1 (IFNGR1) were dysregulated cytokines in most organs. NAMPT, which
participates in multiple signaling pathways, such as IL6-STAT3 and NF-κB (Garten et
al., 2015), was upregulated in the six organs except for testis. NR3C1, which is
involved in the anti-inflammatory process(Baschant and Tuckermann, 2010), was
downregulated in the five organs except for testis and thyroid. IFNGR1, which
triggers host immune responses upon viral infection(Xia et al., 2018), was upregulated
in the five organs except for testis and thyroid.

Pick C1(NPC1)(Cote et al., 2011), carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion
molecule 1 (CEACAM1)(Tsai et al., 2003) and cathepsin L1 (CTSL)(Liu et al.,
2020b). ACE2, the known receptor mediating SARS-CoV-2 entry, did not show
significant regulation in lungs, but was downregulated in both kidney and heart in
COVID-19 patients (Figure 2C). This observation is supported by the modulatory
roles of ACE2 on angiotensin II, including inflammation, vasoconstriction and
thrombosis(Liu et al., 2020a). Interestingly, our results showed CTSL, the serine
protease of SARS-CoV-2 in the endosomal pathway, was significantly upregulated in
the lung (Figure 2C), nominating it as a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19. In
the SARS-CoV infection cell model, the inhibitor of CTSL has been proven to be
effective for blocking the virus entry (Simmons et al., 2005).

Our data suggested systematic dysregulation of coagulation, angiogenesis and
fibrosis in COVID-19 patients, as shown in Figure 3 and Table S5. Microthrombi in
the COVID-19 patients were observed in the lungs and kidneys of COVID-19 patients
(Figure S1), in agreement with laboratory markers, such as D-dimer (Figure S2),
indicating a prothrombotic state. Based on our analysis, the dysregulated proteins
participating in coagulation, anticoagulation and fibrinolytic system could contribute
to the coagulation disorders in COVID-19 (Figure 3A, Table S5, Supplementary
Discussion). Besides, angiogenesis has also been reported in the lung (Ackermann et
al., 2020). In our study, a total of 139 angiogenesis-related proteins from the nCounter
PanCancer Progression Panel (NanoSring Technologies) were significantly
dysregulated (Table S5, Figure 3B). Based on our data, multi-organ abnormal
angiogenesis (not only in the lung) may have developed due to disordered
coagulation, tissue hypoxia and excessive stimulation by cytokines in COVID-19
(Supplementary Discussion).
As fibrosis has been observed in the lungs of COVID-19 patients (Figure S1,
Table S1), we analyzed 29 fibrosis associated proteins in our dataset by matching with
the reported potential fibrosis markers (Figure 3C, Table S5, Supplementary
Discussion). Serpin family E member 1 (SERPINE1) and Chitinase 3 Like 1
(CHI3L1) were upregulated in the most organs of COVID-19 patients (Figure 3C). In
the COVID-19 samples, we characterized 179 dysregulated proteins involved in the
four stages of fibrosis, namely initiation, inflammation, proliferation and
modification, according to nCounter Fibrosis Panel (NanoSring Technologies). These
proteins formed 447 interactions according to String (Szklarczyk et al., 2019) and
Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003) in the studied tissue types (Figure S5, Table S5,
Supplementary Discussion). The dysregulated proteins associated with the fibrosis
process are mostly in the lung, which is consistent with the pathological observation
(Figure S1). Along with the fibrosis process, fewer proteins were dysregulated at the
modification step compared with the other three stages, suggesting that chronic
inflammation and fibrosis process may initiate at the molecular level without obvious
pathological changes (Supplementary Discussion). The above observation may be
instructive clinically to monitor COVID-19 patients after recovery for delayed

To obtain a systematic understanding of biological processes represented by
5336 dysregulated proteins, we performed pathway enrichment in each tissue type
using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Comparisons of the most enriched or dysregulated
pathways (-log10 (p value) > 10 or ratio > 0.35 or absolute (Z-score) > 5) among seven
organ types are shown in Figure 4A and Table S6. EIF2 signaling is involved in the
regulation of mRNA translation (Roux and Topisirovic, 2018), which has been
reported to be affected by virus infection (Bojkova et al., 2020). The lung, liver and
thyroid shared a similar pattern of mRNA translation (Figure 4A), though there was
little evidence of direct virus infection in the liver or thyroid. Most dysregulated
proteins specific to the lung belonged to L13a-mediated translational silencing of
ceruloplasmin expression (Figures 4B, 6A), which has been reported as an innate
immune mechanism after the virus infection (Mazumder et al., 2014). We observed
suppression of multiple metabolic processes including glycogenolysis, galactose
degradation and glycolysis (Figure 4A, Table S6). In contrast, fatty acid β oxidation
(FAO) and oxidative phosphorylation were activated in most organs, suggesting a
switch to high-efficiency energy production mode to support virus replication in the
lung and mRNA translation in the liver (Heaton and Randall, 2011). In addition,
dysregulated FAO and oxidative phosphorylation also led to excessive generation of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and release of proapoptotic proteins, which induced
liver necrosis (Figure S1). In the kidney, FAO was inhibited, which is thought to be a
contributor to acute kidney injury (AKI) induced renal fibrogenesis (Kang et al.,
2015). Indeed, AKI has been observed in most COVID-19 patients in our study (Table
S1).

We next investigated inter-organ crosstalk in COVID-19 patients based on our
proteomics data (Figures 5, 6, Figures S7, Supplementary Discussion). The lung is the
major target attacked by SARS-CoV-2. In our data, COVID-19 lung proteome showed
unique enrichment of pathways which are known to be associated with virus
infection, including mRNA decay and translation shutoff (Tanaka et al., 2012) (Figure
4C). Further, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and uncapped mRNA of the virus act as
viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) which trigger the innate
immune response through recognition by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in the
cytoplasm (Lin and Cao, 2020). By comparing with the SARS-CoV-2 protein
interaction map (Gordon et al., 2020), 12 virus-host interacting proteins were
dysregulated only in the lung, including stress granule-related factor G3BP1,
mitochondrial protein TIM10, transcription regulator eIF4H, RING-type E3 ubiquitin
ligase MIB1, pro-inflammatory cytokine receptor IL17RA, and member of Cullin
RING E3 ligase 2 complex ZYG11B (Figure 4D). These proteins have been reported
to promote virus replication, inhibit host mRNA expression, mediate the delivery of
viral DNA through viral nuclear pore complex, participate in pulmonary fibrosis and
degrade virus restriction factors (Gordon et al., 2020). G3BP1 was reported to interact

with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein, which could be sequestered by viruses to
promote their replication (Gordon et al., 2020). Mitochondrial proteins known to be
targeted by viruses to enhance their replication (Williamson et al., 2012). The
interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 and eIF4H may indicate the inhibition of host
mRNA expression (Gordon et al., 2020). The interaction between Nsp9 and MIB1
may mediate the delivery of viral DNA through nuclear pore complex (Gordon et al.,
2020). IL17RA is associated with elevation of collagen and pulmonary fibrosis, and
its inhibitor has been reported to reduce fibrosis in SARS infection (Mi et al., 2011).
The interaction between Orf10 and ZYG11B may be hijacked for degradation of virus
restriction factors or be blocked to protect itself from degradation (Gordon et al.,
2020).
We found that spleen and lung exhibited similar immune response patterns. T
cell exhaustion and upregulation of monocytes biomarkers in the spleen (Figures 5A,
6B) suggested hyperinflammatory, which may have damaged the integrity of the gas
exchange barrier and induced hypoxia. The hypoxia state would further stimulate the
inflammatory responses (Eltzschig and Carmeliet, 2011). We further checked multiple
markers for various immune cells in the spleen samples using immunohistochemistry
(IHC) and found that the number of T and B lymphocytes were significantly reduced
by IHC staining of CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD20, especially in the white pulp of
COVID-19 patients, while the number of macrophages, M2 macrophages increased in
the red pulp of COVID-19 patients by IHC staining of CD68 and CD163 respectively.
These findings agreed with our proteomic data (Figure S6). Besides, the cytokines and
immune cells in the blood cycling could induce acute phase response and NF-κB
signaling in the liver (Figure 5B) (Alonzi et al., 2001; Israel, 2010), which
sequentially leads to vascular hyperpermeability (Nagy et al., 2008) and vasogenic
edema in the heart (Figures S1, S7A). In the thyroid and kidney, inflammatory
infiltration and activated inflammation associated signals and proteins were also
identified (Figures S7B, C, D).

Compared with the other organ types, the number of differentially expressed
proteins in testes was negligible. Only ten proteins were downregulated (Figure 7A).
Insulin like factor 3 (INSL3), the most abundantly expressed proteins in Leydig cells
(Uhlen et al., 2015), was the most dramatically decreased protein in COVID-19
testicular tissue (Figures 7A, D), suggesting impaired Leydig cell functions or a
reduced Leydig cell population. Indeed, the histological examination revealed a
reduction of Leydig cells (Figures 7B, C), in consistent with our previous pathological
report (Yang et al., 2020). We also found five down-regulated proteins related to
cholesterol biosynthesis (Figures 7A, D). All steroid hormones, including
testosterone, are derived from cholesterol. Downregulation of dynein regulatory
complex subunit 7 (DRC7), a sperm motility factor, suggested impaired sperm
mobility (Morohoshi et al., 2020) (Figures 7A, D).

In summary, we have quantified 11,394 proteins in seven types of tissue from
patients died from COVID-19, and identified 5336 significantly dysregulated proteins
compared to non-COVID-19 patients. This proteomic atlas uncovered multiple
biological and pathological processes regulated in COVID-19, including immune
response, protein translation, coagulation disorder, angiogenesis and profibrotic
process. Crosstalk among multiple organs further linked the aforementioned processes
by the hyperinflammatory environment with tissue hypoxia after SARS-CoV-2
infection. This systematic proteomic investigation provides a rich resource for
improving our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2
infection, and offers clues for therapeutics. This study is limited by the sample size. In
addition, future in-depth investigation of the perturbed pathways and the nominated
therapeutics is needed.

Clinical specimens and histological analysis
This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Union Hospital
affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and
Technology (No.2020-0043-1) and Medical Ethical Committee of Westlake
University (No.20200329GTN001).
All COVID-19 patients were from the Union Hospital affiliated to Tongji
Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology and met the
diagnostic criteria by the National Health Commission of China. With the consent by
the fatal COVID-19 patients’ families, ultrasound-guided percutaneous multi-point
postmortem core biopsies were performed within two hours after death in a negative
pressure isolation ward, from February to April 2020. Ultrasound examinations were
performed using an ultrasound scanner (EPIQ 7C, Philips Medical Systems, Andover,
MA, USA) equipped with an L12-5/S5-1 probe, or a China Mindray portable
Ultrasound M9 GD equipped with an L10-3 probe. All autopsies were performed
using the large core (14-guage) needle by the multitask team consisting of
pathologists, thoracic surgeons, and ultrasound doctors. Procured tissues were
preserved in the 10% neutral formalin immediately after the procedure and fixed for
over 24 hours, and then routinely processed for paraffin blocks. Histological slices
were prepared using a microtome and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) as
described previously (Su et al., 2020b).Immunohistochemical stains (IHC) were
performed for CD3 (Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark), CD4 (Dako), CD8 (Dako), CD20
(Roche, Tucson, AZ, USA), CD68 (Dako) and CD163(Cell Margue) according to the
manufacturers’ protocols on a Dako Link 48 automated stainer (for CD3, CD4, CD8,
CD68 and CD163) or a Roche Benchmark XT Ultra system (for CD20). All slides
were examined by at least two senior pathologists independently. A total of 144
microscopy-guided dissection samples were analyzed from 73 specimens, including
heart (9 specimens), lung (15 specimens), liver (10 specimens), kidney (10
specimens), spleen (9 specimens), testis (5 specimens), and thyroid (15 specimens),
see Tables S1, S2. We also collected 74 control samples from archived blocks of 56
non-COVID-19 patients before December, 2019 (Tables S1, S2).
Proteomics data acquisition
Around 1-1.5mg FFPE tissue samples were processed to generate peptide
samples using accelerated pressure cycling technology (PCT) assisted sample
preparation method as described previously(Gao et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2019).
Briefly, the samples were dewaxed by heptane and rehydrated by ethanol solution of
different concentrations; then undergone acidic hydrolysis by 0.1% formic acid, and
basic hydrolysis by 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 10.0); followed by tissue lysis by 6 M
urea/2M thiourea (Sigma) buffer, reduction by Tris(2 carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP,
Sigma) and alkylation by iodoacetamide (IAA, Sigma) in PCT. Then the lysates were
digested using PCT by a mix of LysC and trypsin (Hualishi Tech. Ltd, Beijing, China)
and the digestion was quenched by trifluoroacetic acid. After C18 cleaning, 7 μg of

peptides from each of the 218 tissue samples, and 37 technical replicates, 34 pooling
samples including common pooled samples and tissue specific pooled samples (Table
S2) were taken for the following TMTpro 16plex labeling based proteomics analysis.
The common pooled samples were prepared by mixing equal amount of peptide from
6 different human organs including testis, lung, kidney, spleen, heart and liver. The
tissue specific pooled samples were prepared by mixing equal amount of peptides
from all samples of a specific organ) were labeled with TMTpro 16plex reagent
(Thermo Fisher Scientific™, San Jose, USA)(Li et al., 2020). After quenching the
labeling reaction by hydroxylamine, 16 TMT-labeled peptide samples were combined
and cleaned by C18 columns (Waters, Sep-Pak Vac tC18 1cc, 50mg). Fractionation
was performed on Thermo Ultimate Dinex 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific™, San
Jose, USA) with an XBridge Peptide BEH C18 column (300Å, 5 μm × 4.6 mm × 250
mm) (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The sample was separated using a 60 min LC
gradient from 5% to 35% acetonitrile (ACN) in 10 mM ammonia (pH=10.0) at a flow
rate of 1 mL/min to 60 fractions. The fractions were combined using the following
strategy: 1) combine the 1st to 12th, 59th and 60th fraction; 2) combine the 13rd, 20th and
52nd fraction; 3) combine the 14th, 19th 54th and 55th fraction; 4) combine the 15th, 18th
and 58th fraction; 5) combine the 16th, 22nd and 53rd fraction; 6) combine the 17th, 21st,
56th and 57th fraction; 7) combine the 23rd and 50th fraction; 8) combine the 24th and
48th fraction; 9) combine the 25th and 47th fraction; 10) combine the 26th and 49th
fraction; 11) combine the 27th and 51st fraction; 12) no combination for 28th to 46th
fraction. Together, we got 30 combinations of fractionates and dried them in vacuum.
Dried peptides were re-dissolved in 2% ACN/0.1% formic acid and then analyzed
with QE HFX or QE HF with the same LC-MS/MS settings as described in Shen et al
(Shen et al., 2020b). The MS raw data were analyzed by Proteome Discoverer
(Version 2.4.1.15, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a combination of the FASTA files
of 20,365 reviewed Homo sapiens proteins downloaded from UniProt website on 14
April, 2020 and the SARS-CoV-2 virus FASTA of 10 SARS-CoV-2 proteins
downloaded from NCBI (version MN908947.3). Precursor ion mass tolerance was set
to 10 ppm, and product ion mass tolerance was set to 0.02 Da. Other parameters in
Proteome Discoverer analysis are identical to our previous study(Shen et al., 2020b).
The grouped abundance ratio of 15 tissue samples to the pooled sample in the same
batch was selected as the value of proteins in the protein matrix for the statistical
analysis. As for the lung, spleen, liver, heart, kidney and testis samples, the pooled
sample for ratio calculation was chosen as the common pooled sample in the
corresponding batch. As for the thyroid samples, the pooled sample for ratio
calculation was chosen as the tissue specific pooled sample in the corresponding
batch.
Quality control of proteomics data
The quality control (QC) of proteomics data was similar as described in Shen et
al(Shen et al., 2020b). We performed QC in the following levels: i) As to the batch
design, one plex of TMTpro 16plex was set as a pooled sample for batch alignment
and quantitative accuracy (as calculated in the grouped abundance ratio); ii) During

the MS acquisition, we analyzed mouse liver protein digests for MS instrument
performance evaluation every two batches, and analyzed MS buffer A (2%
ACN/0.1% formic acid) as blanks every six LC-MS/MS injections; iii) We random
distributed the peptide samples from every organ of COVID-19 patients and nonCOVID-19 patients into each batch; iv) For data analysis, we calculated the median
coefficient of variation (CV) of the proteomics data for reproducibility. As for the
pooled controls, we calculated the CV by the log2(abundance) of quantified proteins
in the pooled controls of each organ (Figure S3B). The pooled samples for CV
calculation was the same as the ones for grouped ratio calculation. As for the technical
replicates, we calculated the CV by expression ratio of quantified proteins in the
technical replicates of each sample (Figure S3C). Besides, unsupervised clustering for
the proteomics data were performed, including heatmapand tSNE (Figures S3D, E).
After the selection of differentially expressed proteins (adjusted p value by B-H
correction < 0.05 and |log2(FC)| > log2(1.2)), the heatmap of each organ by the
dysregulated proteins was performed and the few samples that couldn’t be grouped
correctly were excluded for further statistical analysis, probably due to unknown preanalytical reasons.
Statistical analysis
Log2 fold-change (FC) was calculated by the mean of proteins expression ratio in
a specific tissue between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patient groups. Student’s t
test was performed for each pair of comparing groups. Adjusted p values were
calculated using B-H correction. The criteria for significantly dysregulated proteins
selection was that the adjusted p value should be less than 0.05 and |log2FC| should be
larger than log2(1.2). Statistical analysis was performed using R (version 3.6.3).
Pathway/network analysis
The pathway enrichment was analyzed by either ingenuine pathway analysis
(IPA)(Kramer et al., 2014) (with p value < 0.05, Z score > 0 or < 0), or Metascape
web-based platform(Zhou et al., 2019) (with p-value < 0.05), or string web-based
platform(Szklarczyk et al., 2019). The immunological proteins were mapped against
GSEA-immunologic gene sets in Metascape platform with our differentially
expressed proteins and then the enriched pathways were distinguished by IPA
analysis.

Figure 1. Multi-organ proteomic landscape of COVID-19 autopsies. A. The
quantified and dysregulated proteins across multiple organs. The outermost (first) ring
represents the type of samples. The number of samples and patients (n/N) are labeled
respectively. The second ring (in blue) refers to the missing/undetected proteins for
each organ. The numbers in black represent the quantified protein number in the
specific organ. The third ring (in light green) refers to unregulated proteins for each
type of organ. The numbers in white represent the significantly dysregulated protein
number in specific organ type (B-H adjusted p value < 0.05; fold change (FC):
comparing COVID-19 with non-COVID-19 patients; |log2(FC)| > log2(1.2)). The
innermost ring refers to the significantly dysregulated proteins for each organ (pink:
upregulated; dark green: downregulated). The length of the radius represents the
protein number. B. Proteins expression of CRP and CD163 across six organs (except
testis). The y-axis stands for the protein expression ratio by TMT-based quantitative
proteomics. Pair-wise comparison of each protein between COVID-19 patients and
non-COVID-19 control groups was performed with student’s t test. Note: The cutoff
of dysregulated proteins has been set at B-H adjusted p value < 0.05 and |log2(FC)| >
log2(1.2). *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001.
Figure 2. Six functional clusters of dysregulated proteins from seven organs
between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. A. Counts of dysregulated
proteins in six clusters of molecules, including potential virus receptors, fibrosis
markers, cytokines (or its receptors), transcription factors (TF), coagulation system
and angiogenesis associated proteins, were shown in a bar chart. Each column along
y-axis represents a type of organ. The number of proteins is shown in x-axis. B.
Landscape of 5336 significantly dysregulated proteins in seven organs. The
dysregulated proteins in the six clusters are labeled as circles (solid: upregulated
proteins; hollow: downregulated proteins). The size of circle indicates |log2(FC)|.
Proteins discussed in Supplementary Discussion are labeled. C. Protein expression of
potential virus receptors across multiple organs. The y-axis stands for the protein
expression ratio by TMT-based quantitative proteomics. Pair-wise comparison of each
protein between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patient groups was performed using
student’s t test. Note: The cutoff of dysregulated proteins has been set at B-H adjusted
p value < 0.05 and |log2(FC)| > log2(1.2). *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001.
Figure 3. Coagulation, angiogenesis associated proteins and fibrosis markers
regulated in multiple organs. Chord diagrams shows dysregulated and shared
proteins in coagulation system (A), angiogenesis associated proteins (B), potential
fibrosis markers (C) between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients across multiple
organs. The cutoff of dysregulated proteins has been set at B-H adjusted p value <
0.05 and |log2(FC)| > log2(1.2). The length of the brick for each protein corresponds to
the sum of |log2(FC)| in multiple organs. The length of the brick for each organ
corresponds to the sum of |log2(FC)| in one or more proteins.

Figure 4. Dysregulated pathways in multiple organs. A. The top pathways
dysregulated across multiple organs. Pathway analysis was performed using all
dysregulated proteins in the specific organ using IPA. The top enriched pathways
among seven organ types were selected by cutoff of either -log10(P) > 10, or ratio >
0.35, or absolute (Z-score) > 5. The size of circle represents the -log10(p value) and
the color represent the Z score by IPA. B. Translation-associated pathway comparison
across multiple organs. The size of circle represents the -log10(p) and the color
represent the Z score by IPA. C. The pathways enriched by Metascape for translation
initiation relating proteins that differentially expressed only in lung or liver
respectively. D. Heatmap of SARS-CoV-2 interacting proteins dysregulated in the
lung. The significance (‘Sig.’ as the short term in figures) was calculated using
Student’s t test (p value: *, <0.05, **, <0.01; *** <0.001). Note: The cutoff of
dysregulated proteins has been set at B-H adjusted p value < 0.05 and |log2(FC)| >

Figure 6. Dysregulated proteins and networks in six organs. A. Significantly
enriched networks from the dysregulated proteins in the six organs. Each protein is
depicted with radar chart for the six organs. Different organs are labeled with different
colors. The shadow areas covering the circles indicate the FC values for each protein.
B. A hypothetical systems view of the multiple organs’ responses to SARS-CoV-2
infection. In the lung, the virus and its released RNA could induce immune response
and hijack the host translation mechanism. The innate and adaptive immune cells in
the spleen and the cytokine induced acute phase proteins secreted by hepatic cells
respond to antiviral defense. Such hyperinflammatory status across the whole body
through circulatory system led to multi-organ injuries. More details are discussed in
Supplementary information. Red box: upregulated proteins/pathways; green box:
downregulated proteins/pathways; blue box, pathology of the organ.

our study. 288 peptide samples containing 37 technique replicates, 16 common pooled
controls and 17 tissue specific pooled controls were distributed into 18 batches and
analyzed by TMT 16-plex labeling based proteomic strategy. FFPE, formalin-fixed
and paraffin-embedded; PCT, pressure cycling technology; RP-LC, reversed phase
liquid chromatography; LC-MS, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. B. The
median CV of the proteomics data is calculated by the log2(abundance) of quantified
proteins in the pooled controls of each organ. C. The median CV of the proteomics
data is calculated by expression ratio of quantified proteins in the technique replicates
of each organ. D. Heatmap of organ-specific dysregulated proteins for lung (37
samples * 1606 proteins), splenic white pulp (17 samples * 1726 proteins), liver (36
samples * 1969 proteins), heart (40 samples * 919 proteins), renal cortex (32 samples
* 1585 proteins), renal medulla (29 samples * 642 proteins) and thyroid (29 samples *
1297 proteins) between COVID-19 patients and control groups were shown. E. The tdistributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) visualization of significantly
dysregulated proteins in multi-organ proteomes of COVID-19 (triangle) and nonCOVID-19 (circle) patients. The color of triangle or circle represents the organ type.
Note: The cutoff of dysregulated proteins has been set at B-H adjusted p value < 0.05
and |log2(FC)| > log2(1.2).
Figure S4. Transcription factors and cytokines dysregulated in multiple organs.
A. Circular heatmap of dysregulated transcription factors. The selected transcription
factors with FC larger than 1.5 from dysregulated proteins are shown. Some of the
transcription factors in specific tissue with the same trend of changes, and
distinguished out by upstream analysis are highlighted in red frame with red and bold
font. B. Pathway enrichment analysis of dysregulated transcription factors between
COVID-19 patients and control groups. Reactome pathways were enriched by String.
FC: fold change; FDR: false discovery rate. C. The chord diagram shows the shared
cytokines (or their receptors) dysregulated between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19
patient groups across multiple organs. D. Pathway enrichment analysis of the
dysregulated cytokines. Gene ontology (GO) pathways were enriched by Metascape.
The cutoff of dysregulated proteins has been set at B-H adjusted p value < 0.05 and
|log2(FC)| > log2(1.2). The color of protein represents the upregulation or
downregulation pattern. The length of the brick for each protein corresponds to the
sum of |log2(FC)| in multiple organs. The length of the brick for each organ
corresponds to the sum of |log2(FC)| in one or more proteins.
Figure S5. The network of fibrosis associated proteins over four fibrosis stages in
multiple organs. The network shows the interactions among 179 stage-specific
dysregulated proteins between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patient groups in each
organ over the four fibrosis stages: initiation (green), inflammation (blue),
proliferation (orange), and modification (red). The network analysis was performed
using String and Cytoscape. The size of the dot represents the value of |log2(FC)|.
Note: The cutoff of dysregulated proteins has been set at B-H adjusted p value < 0.05
and |log2(FC)| > log2(1.2).

To investigate the virus induced pathologic features at the protein level, we first focused on
the lung proteome. As the entry of the virus, the known ACE2 receptor and cathepsin L1 (CTSL)
for SARS-CoV-21, known C-type lectin domain family 4 member L(CD209) and member M
(CLEC4M) receptors for SARS2,3 were identified in the lung proteome in this study. Interestingly,
ACE2, CD209 and CLEC4M were not significantly dysregulated in the lung compared with other
organs (Figure 2C). This might be associated with the multiple functions of these receptors. ACE2
is not only the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, but also regulate the inflammation response. It could
directly mediate the macrophage inflammatory function and its angiotensin converting activity
may protect the lung from injury by controlling excess inflammation4,5. In this study, no difference
of ACE2 in the lung between COVID-19 patients and control groups has been found, indicating
that ACE2 inhibitors might not be an ideal therapy in the treatment for COVID-196. On the other
hand, we found that the ACE2 was downregulated in the kidney and heart of COVID-19 patients
(Figure 2C), which might be associated with its catalytic activity in the local renin-angiotensin
system (RAS) in these two organs7. CLEC4M is a highly expressed dendritic cell (DC) specific
adhesion receptor in the liver, and it recognizes T cells to promote immune response8. CLEC4M
was found to be downregulated in the liver of COVID-19 patients in this study (Figure 2C). It has
been reported that the hepatocyte specific expression of CLEC4M could promote clearance of Von
Willebrand factor (vWF) in mouse model9, which might be associated with hypercoagulability.
CD209, in the same family with CLEC4M, however, showed no differential expression in neither
organ. CD209 and CLEC4M are all associated with HCV infection10. On the contrary, CTSL was
upregulated in the lung, spleen and renal medulla of COVID-19 patients, which has been reported
to promote the SARS-CoV-2 entry and its inhibitor could suppress virus entry effectively11. The
inhibitor of CTSL might be an effective drug for COVID-19 treatment. The above examples
indicate that our data might complement the protein interaction data. The proteins which interact
directly with virus could also be dysregulated at protein level, which might be potential targets for
treatments.

Other receptors
To search for other potential targets for COVID-19, we reviewed validated virus entry
associated receptors and proteases12 and checked their abundance among the seven organs.
Intracellular cholesterol transporter 1 (NPC1) binds to the glycoprotein of Ebola and its inhibitor
has been recognized as a potential target for the treatment of Ebola13. NPC1 is significantly
upregulated in most organs of COVID-19 patients, including the lung, white pulp of spleen, heart

and thyroid (Figure 2C). Considering the critical need for lipid and its metabolism during viral
replication14, NPC1 might be a potential drug target for the COVID-19. The carcinoembryonic
antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), which is the major receptor for murine
coronavirus on its host cells15, was significantly upregulated in the lung, liver, kidney, and thyroid
(Figure 2C). Its dimerization with the immune checkpoint TIM3 would further suppress adaptive
immunity16, so the inhibitor of CEACAM1 might be a potential target for COVID-19 treatment. In
the hepatocytes, CEACAM1 could respond to insulin17, which may be associated with the
hyperglycemia in the COVID-19 patient. In summary, this study might indicate the SARS-CoV-2
infection or potential drug target by the differential expression across eight organs between
COVID-19 patients and the control group.

Remarkably, we identified 1,107 transcription factors (TFs) among seven organs and 396 of
them were differentially expressed between COVID-19 and control groups (B-H adjusted p value
< 0.05 and |log2(fold-change, FC)| > log2(1.2), Table S5). By matching the experiential FC with
the predicted activation state in upstream regulator analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
(IPA), we found ten transcription factors expressed with the same trend, including nine
upregulated proteins and one downregulated protein (SI Figure 1, Table S5).
Among the ten upregulated TFs (SI Figure 1), seven of them were involved in the
inflammatory response, such as the acute phase response and NF-κB signaling, reflecting the
extensive inflammatory infiltration in these tissues in COVID-19 patients. NF-κB subunit 2
(NFKB2) is expressed in various cell types and plays a key role in proinflammation18. It functions
mainly through Toll-like receptor signaling pathway19 and NF-κB signaling pathway20.
Transcription factor p65 (RELA) is a proto-oncogene and also encodes an NF-κB subunit protein.
The heterodimeric RELA-NFKB1 complex has been reported to be the most abundant form of
NF-κB, and plays a key role in immune, inflammatory and acute phase responses and affect cell
proliferation and apoptosis21. In this study, RELA was upregulated in the thyroid and NFKB2 was
elevated in the lung, kidney and thyroid (SI Figure 1), indicating a strong immune reaction in
these three organs. CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPB) is a transcription enhancing
protein, which plays an important role in liver regeneration22, immune and inflammatory
responses22. NF-IL6 is a member of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family and it
is essential to induce G-CSF in macrophages and fibroblasts23. Upregulation of C/EBPB was
detected in the lung, spleen, liver, heart and kidney (SI Figure 1), indicating potential immune
dysregulation or liver damage. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and 3 (STAT1/3)
encode proteins of the STAT protein family. STAT is regulated and controlled by some cytokines
and growth factors24 and then transmit the signal to downstream pathways such as cell growth and
apoptosis25,26. STAT3 can contribute to the inflammation activation in tumors by NF-κB and IL-6GP130-JAK pathways27. Upregulation of STAT3 was observed in the spleen, liver, heart and
kidney, while STAT1 was only observed to be upregulated in the kidney (SI Figure 1). This may
indicate potential dysregulation of immune state of COVID-19 patients. Transcription factor jun-B
(JUNB) is a proto-oncogene encoding a transcription factor protein. It belongs to activate protein
1 (AP-1), which is regulated by varied physiological or pathological stimuli, such as cytokines,
growth factors and infections28. It acts as a negative regulator of proliferation by modulating cellcycle regulators29. Upregulation of JUNB was observed across over the lung, spleen, liver, heart,

Other transcription factors either reflect the tissue injury or hypoxia state in COVID-19
patients in this study. The RB transcriptional corepressor 1 (RB1) was upregulated in the liver and
kidney (SI Figure 1), which may negatively modulate the cell cycle30 and induce a higher degree
of mitochondria permeabilization and apoptosis31. The La-related protein 1 (LARP1) was
upregulated in the lung, spleen, liver, kidney and thyroid (SI Figure 1). LARP1 can regulate
mRNA translation and is associated with mTOR signaling32, and it has been reported to interact
with SARS-CoV-233. The hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1A) was upregulated in renal
cortex (SI Figure 1) and was also predicted active in the lung, liver, renal cortex and medulla by
upstream regulator analysis, reflecting the systemic hypoxia state34. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4
alpha (HNF4A) can modulate gene transcription of lipid and bile acid synthesis, gluconeogenesis,
and cytokines35. This function may be associated with the hepatic steatosis in COVID-19 patients
because HNF4A was downregulated in the liver in this study (SI Figure 1).

Blood coagulation occurred in most patients died from COVID-19 in our study with clotting
in lower extremity vein (Table S1), which resulted from the induced coagulation cascade and the
imbalance between coagulation, anticoagulation system and the impaired fibrinolytic system36.
The activities of inflammatory cells and cytokines following virus infection would result in
endothelial injury and the secretion of tissue factors, which could initiate the coagulation
cascade37,38. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) could inhibit the activated factor Xa (F10a),
tissue factor catalytic complex and then inhibit the subsequent coagulation cascade39. In COVID19 patients, TFPI was upregulated in the white pulp of the spleen and liver (SI Figure 2), which
may occur with coagulation. Meanwhile, some coagulation factors were dysregulated in COVID19 patients. For example, coagulation factor XII (F12) was downregulated in the heart, renal
cortex and thyroid, coagulation factor XI (F11) was decreased in the lung, renal cortex and
medulla while plasma kallikrein (KLKB1) was decreased in the lung, renal cortex and thyroid (SI
Figure 2). F12 has been reported to be activated by KLKB1 and the activated F12 could catalyze
F11. The activated F11 could activate factor IX (F9), which will lead to thrombosis and the
formation of fibrin40. In COVID-19 patients, F12 was decreased in the heart, renal cortex and
thyroid. Coagulation factor XIIIa (F13a) is activated in the last step of coagulation, which would
induce hemostasis. In addition, it would stabilize the fibrin clot to avoid fibrinolysis41. It was
increased in the renal cortex and thyroid, which could contribute to the formation of blood
clotting. vWF is a glycoprotein, which could bind to the factor VIII (F8) and protect F8 from
degradation by Vitamin K-dependent protein C (PROC). Besides, it could mediate the platelet
aggregation following the vascular injury42. The VWF was increased in the white pulp of the
spleen and renal cortex, which indicates the high risk of thrombosis risk. In contrast, it was
decreased in the heart and lung of the COVID-19 patients Von Willebrand factor (VWF).
Fibrinogen alpha chain, gamma chain and beta chain (FGA, FGG and FGB), which could be
cleaved to fibrin and generate the blood clots 43, were all increased in the lung and all decreased in
the thyroid, while FGA was only increased in the renal cortex (SI Figure 2). The prothrombin (F2)
was decreased in the heart (SI Figure 2).
The Vitamin K-dependent protein S (PROS1) and PROC belong to the protein C
anticoagulant system. PROS1 is the cofactor of PROC, which could degrade factor VIIIa (F8a),
factor Va (F5a) and protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) once activated44. Alpha-1-antitrypsin
(SERPINA1) is an inhibitor of PROC45. Plasma serine protease inhibitor (SERPINA5) is also a
serine proteinase inhibitor and acts as an inhibitor of protein C and other coagulation enzymes46.
In the COVID-19 patients, PROC was decreased in the heart and PROS1 was decreased in the
kidney (SI Figure 2), which may contribute to the thrombosis. SERPINA1 is also decreased in the
heart and thyroid. SERPINA5 is decreased in the liver, heart, renal cortex and thyroid.
Antithrombin Ⅲ (SERPINC1) inhibits thrombin and several serine proteases, such as factors IXa
(F9a), Xa (F10a), XIa(F11a), XIIa (F12a), plasmin and kallikrein. It would consume rapidly
during disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)47. In the COVID-19 patients, SERPINC1 was
decreased in the heart, renal medulla and thyroid (SI Figure 2). Thrombomodulin (THBD) is also
an anticoagulant protein, which could inhibit fibrinogen clotting and FV activation48. It is
increased in the white pulp of spleen, heart and renal cortex (SI Figure 2). Heparin cofactor 2
(SERPIND1) is a serine proteinase inhibitor, which acts as the inhibitor of thrombin49 and the
cofactor for heparin. In the COVID-19 patients, SERPIND1 significantly decreased in the liver,

heart, renal cortex, medulla and thyroid (SI Figure 2), which could lead to the generation of
thrombin or the procoagulant state in the body.
In the fibrinolytic system, plasminogen (PLG), the zymogen, could convert into serine
proteinase plasmin by two serine peptidases, the tissue plasminogen activator (PLAT) and
urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)50. Then the plasmin could breakdown the blood clotting. In
this study, PLG was downregulated in the heart and thyroid while PLTA was upregulated in the
liver of the COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 2). Alpha-2-antiplasmin (SERPINF2) was
downregulated in the heart, renal medulla and thyroid of the COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 2),
which may indicate the increased fibrinolysis51. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (SERPINE1) is
a serine proteinase inhibitor and acts as a major inhibitor of plasminogen activators. In the
COVID-19 patients, SERPINE1 significantly upregulated in the lung, liver, heart, renal cortex and
medulla (SI Figure 2), which could increase the risk of thrombosis and fibrosis52. Alpha-2macroglobulin (A2M) could bind to varied proteinases, such as plasmin and kallikrein, and
inactive them. And in sepsis, it would decrease because of the formation of complex53. Here, we
found A2M was decreased in lung, heart, renal medulla and thyroid (SI Figure 2).

When the SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the lung mediated by ACE2 or other receptors through
the superior respiratory system, it induces the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and transmits
the information from lesions to the whole body through the circulatory system. Then the
inflammation cells are attracted to the infection sites. Meanwhile, the hyperinflammatory state
harms the alveolar cells and influences multiple organs. The damage of the integrity of the gas
exchange barrier may induce hypoxia, which strengthens inflammation response54 in the whole
body. The following paragraphs described the significantly dysregulated protein associated with
cytokines.
Our data showed that nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) was upregulated in
the six organs (except for testis) of COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 3). NAMPT is involved in the
resistance of cells to oxidative stress and may help immunity cells’ survival under stress such as
inflammation55. Extracellular NAMPT (eNAMPT) was identified as the pre-B cell colony
enhancing factor56 and an essential factor in granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor-(G-CSF)induced myeloid differentiation57, which also could promote B cell maturation and inhibit
neutrophil apoptosis58. The overexpression of NAMPT in various organs may indicate that the
COVID-19 patients are under activated immune response.
Glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) was significantly downregulated in five organs (except for
testis and thyroid) in our study (SI Figure 3). NR3C1 usually exists in the cytoplasm and would be
translocated to the nucleus after binding to its ligand. It could upregulate the anti-inflammatory
protein or inhibit the expression of pro-inflammatory protein in the nucleus59. The significant
downregulation of NR3C1 in the five organs may indicate an increased inflammatory response of
various organs after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Our data indicated that interleukin-6 receptor subunit beta (IL6ST) was significantly
upregulated in COVID-19 patients’ thyroid (SI Figure 3). IL6ST is involved in the signal
transduction of IL-6-type cytokines. After binding to its receptor, IL6ST is driven to form a
complex by IL6, then activating Janus kinases (JAKs) and STAT3 and participating in acute phase
response, T cell differentiation, antibody production and proliferation60,61. IL6 is a key proinflammatory factor in the early stage of infection and is associated with prognosis60. It has also
been reported to be overexpressed in the serum of severe COVID-19 patients 62.
The abundance of angiopoietin like 6 (ANGPTL6) in the thyroid tissue of COVID-19
patients was significantly downregulated (SI Figure 3). ANGPTL6 plays a role in angiogenesis,
lipid metabolism and glucose metabolism63. It has been reported that in the ANGPTL6 deficient
mouse model, obesity, lipid accumulation and insulin resistance were developed. In contrast, the
mouse would be more sensitive to insulin by activating the ANGPTL6, which indicates that
ANGPTL6 is related to insulin resistance64. The downregulation of ANGPTL6 in the thyroid of
COVID-19 patients indicates a potential insulin resistance status in COVID-19 patients.
Our data showed that the expression of natriuretic peptides A (NPPA) in the heart tissue of
COVID-19 patients was significantly downregulated (SI Figure 3). NPPA belongs to the
natriuretic peptide family, which regulates the extracellular electrolyte homeostasis. The cardiac

natriuretic peptide, also known as vasodilation, is mainly produced, stored, and secreted by atrial
cardiomyocytes. When the blood volume increases and the heart or blood vessel wall is stimulated
to release atrial natriuretic peptide by a large stretch which causes powerful natriuretic and diuretic
effects. The knockout of NPPA receptor (NPR1) in the heart of mice exhibited cardiac
hypertrophy65 and the knockout of NPPA could cause heart failure and hypertension66. The
downregulation of NPPA implies potential heart damage in COVID-19 patients.
Downregulation of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) was detected in the liver of COVID-19
patients (SI Figure 3). FGF2 is a growth factor that belongs to the heparin-binding (fibroblast)
growth factor family. FGF2 can induce angiogenesis by promoting endothelial cell proliferation
and transferring its physical organization67 and is involved in the regulation of many other
important biological processes such as cell survival and cell differentiation68. The decrease of
FGF2 may contribute to the liver fibrosis of COVID-19 patients.
Fibroblast growth factor 17 (FGF17) was significantly overexpressed in the heart of COVID19 (SI Figure 3). FGF17 belongs to the family of fibroblast growth factor (FGF), which
participates in a variety of biological processes, including cell proliferation, cell migration during
embryonic development, wound healing immune responses, cell differentiation and angiogenesis
67
. The upregulation of FGF17 may indicate a repair status of heart damage in the patients.
In the renal medulla of COVID-19 patients, IL13RA1 was significantly upregulated (SI
Figure 3). IL13RA1 is a subunit of the interleukin 13 receptor, which mainly mediates IL-4 signal
transduction. IL-4 and IL-13 both belongs to the profibrogenic cytokines69. It has been reported to
protect the lung from bleomycin induced injury70.
Interferon-gamma receptor 1 (IFNGR1) was overexpressed in multiple kinds of organs
except for the thyroid and testis (SI Figure 3). IFNGR1 is a ligand-binding chain of heterodimeric
gamma interferon receptors on macrophages and is a functional receptor for interferon-gamma71,
which triggers host immunity to virus infection72, such as induction of phagocyte oxidase system,
NO production and lysosomal enzymes for microbe destruction in macrophages73. The
overexpression status of IFNGR1 implies the systemic immune response activated by SARS-CoV2.
Interleukin 1 receptor-like 1 (IL1RL1) was found to be upregulated in the kidney cortex of
COVID-19 patients in this study (SI Figure 3). IL1RL1 belongs to the interleukin 1 receptor
family, which is a receptor for interleukin-33 (IL-33) 65. IL-33 signal transduction could lead to the
activation of NF-κB, MAP kinase and induction of Th2 cytokines66. It has been reported that
IL1RL1 was overexpressed in aged SARS-CoV infected animals, and the overexpression of
IL1RL1 indicates that older macaques have a stronger host response upon viral infections than
young macaques74. This may indicate that a pro-inflammatory status in COVID-19 patients.
Eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (RNASE2) was found to be downregulated in the COVID-19
patient’s kidney cortex (SI Figure 3). RNASE2 is derived from eosinophils and has antiviral
activity and selective chemotactic properties to dendritic cells75. It can reduce the activity of
single-stranded RNA virus through ribonucleolytic enzyme activity and interaction with the
extracellular virus by its unique structure 76. The downregulation of RNASE2 in the renal cortex
of COVID-19 patients may indicate dysregulation of the immune system or may be a result of
consuming itself to binding with and inhibit extracellular virus in COVID-19 patients.
Syndecan-4 (SDC4) was upregulated in the liver of the COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 3).
SDC4 is a membrane proteoglycan. It can support exosome biogenesis and engagement of FGF

with its receptor, which plays a role in angiogenesis, inflammation and infection77.
C-X-C motif chemokine 13 (CXCL13) was observed to be upregulated in the spleen of
CVOID-19 patients (SI Figure 3). CXCL13 is a member of the CXC chemokine family, which
interacts with the chemokine receptor CXCR5 to selectively chemotactic for B cells78.
CXCL13/CXCR5 enhances antigen encounter and BCR-mediated B-cell activation through
regulation of actin cytoskeleton and activity of motor protein79. The upregulation of CXCL13 may
indicate the elevated humoral immune response in the spleen of COVID-19 patients.
Cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides (CAMP), an antimicrobial peptide family member, was
downregulated in the spleen of the COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 3). When mammals encounter a
large number of bacterial invasions, it plays a role in the innate immune defense by inducing
leukocyte chemotaxis, degranulation, the response of macrophages and stimulating wound
healing80. The downregulation of CAMP may indicate the dysregulation of innate immunity in
COVID-19 patients.
Retinoic acid receptor RXR-alpha (RXRA) was detected to be downregulated in the lung of
the COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 3). RXRA is a nuclear receptor for retinoic acid 81 and regulates
lipid metabolism and inflammation in macrophages82. In response to viral infections, it plays a
role in weakening the innate immune system. It has been reported that the downregulation of
RXRA would induce the production of type I IFN and antiviral response83. Downregulation of
RXRA may indicate a proinflammatory state in the lung of COVID-19 patients.

Angiogenesis is the forming of new blood vessels from existing vessels by sprouting and
splitting. Both types are discovered in almost all the organs in human bodies84. The normal
regulation of angiogenesis is governed by a fine balance between factors that induce the formation
of blood vessels, such as pro-angiogenic factors and those that halt or inhibit the process.
Generally, cells activated by hypoxia would release pro-angiogenic molecules, such as hypoxiainducible factors (HIF) 85, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 86 and angiotensin (Ang)87.
In response to the pro-angiogenic factors, the endothelial cells would proliferate to form the
neighboring blood vessels and secret matrix metalloproteases (MMP) to digest the blood vessel

walls for migration. Several protein fragments are produced by the digestion of the blood vessel
walls, which would intensify the proliferative and migratory activity of endothelial cells and then
form a capillary tube by altering the arrangement of their adherence membrane proteins, such as
vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) and integrin88. Finally, new blood vessels become
mature and stabilized by Ang, PDGF (platelet derived growth factor) and transforming growth
factor beta (TGFB), resulting in a continuous blood flow 89.
It is known that hyperbaric oxygen therapy increases the expression of HIF and actives
VEGF production 90. Thereby, we can speculate that severe COVID patients with ARDS after
ventilator treatment would be pro-angiogenesis. However, the angiogenesis may not be specific to
COVID cases. Recently, a study which compared tissues from seven lung samples obtained from
patients who died from COVID-19, tissues from 7 lungs obtained from ARDS secondary to
influenza A(H1N1) infected corpses and tissues from 10 age-matched uninfected lungs found that
the amount of new vessel generated by intussusceptive angiogenesis was 2.7 times as high as that
in the lungs from patients with influenza 91. These results support a more profound evidence of
pro-angiogenesis in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that 139 proteins involved in seven organs are related to angiogenesis by
our proteomic data analysis. It implies that the angiogenesis process has differences between
COVID-19 patients and healthy controls.
As a supplement to that study, our multi-organ data found a multi-organ angiogenesis
process, not merely in the lung. The vascular endothelial growth factors A (VEGFA) was
upregulated in the thyroid, and the VCAM1 was upregulated in the kidney (cortex as well as
medulla) of COVID-19 (SI Figure 4). The MMP protein 14 were found upregulated in the spleen,
lung and thyroid, and the MMP2 were induced in thyroid, lung and renal cortex in COVID-19
cases (SI Figure 4). We also quantified transforming growth factor beta related proteins (TGFBI)
and angiogenin (ANG) in our proteomics data, while it was not upregulated in all of these COVID
organs (SI Figure 4).
Besides the proteins that directly participate in angiogenesis, we also detected some potential
regulatory ones. Firstly, the upstream hypoxia inducible factor 1 subunit alpha (H1F1A) was
found to be increased in the kidney of COVID-19 cases, which actives VEGF production and
angiogenesis. In addition, the integrin proteins (ITGA5, ITGB1, and ITGB3) are found upregulated in the lung, heart, liver or renal cortex (SI Figure 4). Many molecules participate in the
processes of angiogenesis, endothelial cells proliferation and invasive signal. Integrins are the
principle adhesion receptors in forming extracellular microenvironment, and integrin-mediated
interactions mainly regulate cell proliferation, migration, and survival 92. The chemokine CX3CL1
could induce the monocytes accumulation and angiogenesis during inflammation93. Our data also
found the overexpression of CX3CL1 in COVID-19 patients’ thyroid (SI Figure 4), which may
indicate the angiogenesis potential in thyroid. It is found that SERPIN family is anti-angiogenesis.
In the rat, blockage of SERPIN family would mediate the process of angiogenesis by interleukin 8
(IL-8) and VEGF. In assays of cellular events in angiogenesis, SERPIN family blocked the
processes of invasion, migration and tube formation 94. Our results showed a downregulation
pattern of SERPIN family proteins in multiple organs of COVID-19 cases. The SERPINA1,
SERPINF1, and SERPING1 are significantly reduced in heart (SI Figure 4). Besides, SERPINA1
was also found downregulated in the thyroid, and SERPING1 are found downregulated in the
renal medulla and liver (SI Figure 4). Transmembrane Protein 100 (TEME100) is an intracellular

transmembrane protein. It is involved in the differentiation of arterial endothelium and vascular
morphogenesis, which can be activated by AKT1 receptor95. In addition, TEME100 plays a vital
role in maintaining vascular integrity and vascular genesis96. In our proteomic data, TEME100
were downregulated in the lung of COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 4). It hints that the blood vessels
of the lung in COVID patients might have poor stability, resulting in increased risk of
angiogenesis in the lung under weak vascular integrity.
In conclusion, we suspected that the balance of angiogenesis is dysregulated in COVID-19
patients, which results in pathological angiogenesis and causes an increased blood-vessel
formation.

Fibrosis markers
The fibrosis process is associated with the overexpressed extracellular matrix, collagen
proteins and proliferation of fibroblasts97. COL1A1 and COL1A2 are pro-alpha1 and 2 chains of
type I collagen, and COL3A1 is collagen type III alpha 1 chain. All of them belong to fibrilforming collagens, which are produced by fibroblasts and act as the essential components of the
myocardial interstitial matrix. These three proteins were downregulated in heart tissue samples
from COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 5). It is reported that an increased expression of collagen type
I and III are believed to be related to fibrosis 98,99. Our control samples of heart were collected
from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), in which interstitial fibrosis is one of the major
characteristics 100. It is also reported that collagen type I and III were both elevated in patients with
DCM 101. Due to the potential fibrosis status in our control groups, minor heart fibrosis can be
missed even if it exists in COVID-19 patients.
LAMB1, LAMB2 and LAMC1 are laminin subunits. Laminins are found in basement
membrane as ECM associated glycoproteins. It is reported that laminins are good prognostic
markers for liver fibrosis102,103. Though no significant change of expression level of laminins was
observed in the liver, we noticed upregulated LAMB1 and LAMC1 in the white pulp of spleen,
and downregulated LAMB2 and LAMC1 in renal medulla (SI Figure 5). It is reported that
increased matrix metalloproteinase 7 and 9 (MMP7 and MMP9) are closely related to the
development of fibrotic kidneys, and laminins are the substrate of MMP7 104 and MMP9105 .
Although we didn’t find significant upregulation of MMP7 and MMP9, the downregulation of
LAMB2 and LAMC1 may indirectly indicate renal fibrosis.
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and metalloproteinase inhibitors (TIMPs) maintain the
balance of fibrogenesis and fibrosis 106,107. In our dataset, we identified MMP2, MMP9, MMP14,
IMMP2L, MMP28, TIMP1,2 and 3. They are all identified upregulated over the different organs
(SI Figure 5). Fibrosis in pathological was only found in the lung, in which two kinds of inhibitors
were upregulated. It might indicate a positive feedback loop between MMPs and TIMPs.
The pulmonary fibrosis, which is associated with fibrous exudation, hyaline membrane
formation and alveolar space collapsed. We have identified the upregulation of lung fibrosis
biomarkers including Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1) 108 and pulmonary surfactant associated
protein B (SFTPB) (SI Figure 5). CHI3L1 was upregulated in the widest distributed among five
tissues including the lung, heart, liver, and kidney (SI Figure 5). SFTPB promotes the secreted
alveolar surfactant and sustains alveolar structure109. The SFTPB was upregulated in the lung of
COVID-19 patients. FABP family is similar to the surfactant 110. We found FABP3, FABP1 and
FABP5 were downregulated based in our dataset (SI Figure 5). The downregulated FABPs
indicated the potential of fibrosis.
Lipid metabolism is also associated with fibrosis. The fibrosis influenced by lipid metabolism
is the transformation between lipofibroblast and myofibroblast. TGF-beta can induce
lipofibroblast differentiation to myofibroblast which is the process of fibrosis generation 111. The
markers of lipofibroblast can be the potential markers for fibrosis, such as perilipin-2 (PLIN2). In
COVID-19 patients, PLIN2 upregulated in the lung, liver, heart, and spleen (SI Figure 5).

Fibrosis could be divided into four stages69. At the initiation stage, the cell and organ damage
would initiate a cascade of stress and immune responses. In response to the initial stress, multiple
inflammatory signaling pathways were activated, such as the chemokine signaling, complement
system, macrophage activation, NF-κB signaling, interferon, platelet and neutrophil degranulation.
Thirdly, chronic inflammation would drive the differentiation or proliferation of fibroblasts and
wound-healing response. Fourthly, the extracellular matrix of immune cells and fibroblast cells
would be further modified. Here we compared the dysregulated proteins in our studies with
proteins in these pathways of the fibrosis and selected the top 20% dysregulated proteins with the
highest fold changes in a specific organ for discussion.

Stage 1: Initiation
In COVID-19 patients, alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (ADH1B) was downregulated in the
lung and liver, while it was upregulated in the white pulp of spleen, heart and thyroid. Alcohol
dehydrogenase 6 (ADH6) was downregulated in the lung and renal cortex. Aldehyde
dehydrogenase family 3 member A2 (ALDH3A2) was downregulated of in the liver, heart,
and renal cortex. Alcohol dehydrogenase 1C (ADH1C) was downregulated in the liver.
Alcohol dehydrogenase 4 (ADH4) was downregulated in the liver while it was upregulated in
the heart (SI Figure 6). They all belong to the alcohol dehydrogenase family and are involved
in the metabolic process of multiple substrates, such as ethanol, hydroxysteroids, and lipid
peroxidation products. It has been reported that lipid metabolism dysregulation can induce
hepatofibrosis in mouse model 112. The downregulation of these proteins in the liver of
COVID-19 patients might indicate the potential hepatic fibrosis. Moreover, the
downregulated ALDH3A2 in COVID-19 patients, may lead to the accumulation of lipid
precursors in the liver 113. Besides, ADH1B, ADH6 are downregulated in the lung and kidney
of the COVID-19 patient, respectively.
In COVID-19 patients, fatty acid synthase (FASN) was upregulated in the lung, renal cortex
and thyroid, while it was downregulated in the liver and testis (SI Figure 6). It is a key lipogenic
enzyme in de novo biogenesis of fatty acids 114 and FASN is required for profibrotic TGF-β
signaling115, which is a master regulator of fibrosis116. Compared with non-COVID-19 controls,
the upregulation of FASN in the lung, kidney and thyroid and the downregulation of FASN in the
liver and testis in COVID-19 patients suggest the initiation of fibrosis in lung, kidney and thyroid
along with the impairment of the fatty acid synthesis process in the liver and testis in COVID-19
patients.
Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) was downregulated in the white pulp of spleen, liver and
renal cortex in COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 6). It is a tumor-suppressive function gene, which
encodes a rate-limiting gluconeogenic enzyme. Reduced expression of FBP1 was observed by
both quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction(qRT-PCR) and Western Blot with increased
liver fibrosis score in mouse117. More dramatic fibrosis can be histologically detected in FBP1deficient liver118. The downregulation of FBP1 in spleen, liver and kidney of COVID-19 patients
compared with non-COVID-19 controls suggests dysfunction of glucose metabolism and fibrosis
potential in these tissues.

Lysosomal acid lipase (LIPA) was upregulated in the heart of COVID-19 patients (SI Figure
6). It is located in the lysosome to catalyze the hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides.
The deficiency of LIPA will lead to the accumulation of fat and cause cholesterol ester storage
disease (CESD). The accumulation of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in hepatocytes result in
hepatomegaly with progressive fibrosis and liver cirrhosis119. Our data showed no significant
difference in LIPA expression in the liver but upregulation in the heart, which might indicate the
fibrosis initiation in the heart.
Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) was upregulated in the liver of COVID-19 patients (SI
Figure 6). It is responsible for lipid transfer and it can transfer phospholipids from triglyceriderich lipoprotein to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and regulate lipid metabolism120. The liver is
one of the main sites for the production and degradation of lipoprotein and the expression of
PLTP. Studies have shown that PLTP can amplify the pro-inflammatory effect of
lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In the mouse model, overexpression of PLTP can induce
atherosclerosis 121. The overexpression of PLTP in COVID-19 liver tissue may be associated with
potential liver injury.
Acyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) was upregulated in the lung of COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 6).
It exists in the endoplasmic reticulum and is mainly involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. SCD is
involved in inflammation and stress regulation of different cell types, including adipocytes,
macrophages, endothelial cells, and muscle cells122. Upregulated SCD expression in the mouse
model promotes hepatic fibrosis through Wnt/β-catenin signal and the lipid metabolism123. Here,
the upregulated SCD in the lung tissue of COVID-19 patients may affect the pulmonary fibrosis
process by regulating metabolism reprogramming.
Protein transport protein Sec61 subunit beta (SEC61B) was upregulated in the lung, white
pulp of spleen and kidney of COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 6). It is one of the two subunits of
SEC61 complex which is the core component of the protein transport device in the endoplasmic
reticulum and is responsible for the transport of polypeptides across the endoplasmic reticulum.
SEC61B is associated with the cytosolic fibrosis through dysregulation of endoplasmic
reticulum124. The upregulated SEC61B might indicate the fibrosis initiation in multiple COVID-19
organs.
Transforming Growth Factor Beta Receptor 2 (TGFBR2) was downregulated in the lung,
while it was upregulated in the heart of COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 6). It can form a
heterodimer with TGF- receptor type 1 and bind TGF to participate in the transcriptional
regulation of genes related to cell cycle, wound healing, immune suppression, and tumor
formation. TGF signaling mediates fibrosis after the inflammatory damage in the heart, kidney,
and intestines 125. TGFBR2 is also a potential target for inhibition of pulmonary fibrosis 126.

Stage 2: Inflammation
Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10) was upregulated in the renal
cortex of COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 7). It belongs to AKR family 1 subfamily B
(AKR1B)127. Recent studies have shown that AKR1B10 is secreted into the stroma from liver
cells by binding to heat shock protein 90 and maybe a useful serum biomarker for advanced
fibrosis in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)127,128. The upregulation of AKR1B10 might
indicate the potential fibrosis in the renal cortex.
Delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) was downregulated in the lung, white
pulp of spleen, liver, renal cortex and thyroid of COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 7). It is the
principal lead binding protein in erythrocytes, which carry over 99% of the lead in blood129. It
is involved in the biosynthesis of heme130. Heme is a functional group of many heme proteins,
including cytochromes and hemoglobin (Hb), so it is essential for many different cellular
processes 131. Excess free heme has been shown to exacerbate the pathogenesis of various
inflammatory diseases, such as sepsis, malaria, sickle cell disease, kidney disease, and

multiple organ failure131-134. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients show
increased cell-free Hb, correlating with disease severity135. However, we identified ALAD
was significantly downregulated in the multiple organs of COVID-19 patients.
Apolipoprotein was downregulated in COVID-19 patients compared with non-COVID-19
controls, mainly in liver, heart, kidney and thyroid (SI Figure 7). Based on the ability of
apolipoprotein to inhibit inflammation, oxidative stress, and tissue remodeling, as well as to
promote adaptive immunity and host defense, the emerging role of apolipoprotein in the
pathogenesis and treatment of lung diseases is increasingly recognized136. Apolipoprotein A-I
(ApoA-I), apolipoprotein A-II (ApoA-II), and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) are important components
of lipoprotein particles that facilitate the transport of cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids
between plasma and cells137. Studies showed that an ApoA-I/ABCA1-dependent pathway
inhibited experimental ovalbumin-induced neutrophilic airway inflammation by reducing colonystimulating factor (G-CSF) production138. ApoA-I was first proposed to play a role in the
pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Based on proteomic analysis of
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), the ApoA-I levels are reduced compared to healthy
subjects, while the treatment with ApoA-I would help to decrease the bleomycin-induced
inflammatory cells and collagen deposition, which reflects the negative correlation between
apolipoproteins and fibrosis139. Based on our analysis, apolipoproteins were significantly
decreased in six tissues except for the testis to certain degrees, indicating a pro-fibrosis potential in
different organs in patients with COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, Apolipoprotein C-II (ApoCII) is a small exchangeable apolipoprotein found in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL), such as
chylomicrons (CM), very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), and in high-density lipoproteins
(HDL)140,141. ApoC-II plays a critical role in TRL metabolism by acting as a cofactor of
lipoprotein lipase (LPL), the main enzyme that hydrolyzes plasma triglycerides (TG) on TRL142.
The reduction of ApoC-II based on our analysis further indicated the reduced metabolic level of
triglycerides-rich lipoproteins in patients with COVID-19 infection.
Antioxidant 1 (ATOX1) was downregulated in the white pulp of spleen, renal cortex and
thyroid of COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 7). It plays a crucial role as a copper chaperone143-145. It
is worth mentioning that ATOX1 was found to have a pivotal role in inflammation via inhibition
of inflammatory responses. The decrease of ATOX1 suggested the occurrence of prophase
inflammation145, which might indicate an inflammation stage before fibrosis in these organs.
Complement component 3 (C3) was downregulated in the lung, heart and thyroid in COVID19 patients, but it was upregulated in the white pulp of spleen (SI Figure 7). The complement
system is a crucial part of the immune system that is involved in the pathogenesis of various
inflammatory lung conditions, including infectious disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease146-149. Complement component 3 (C3) plays a central role in the activation of the
complement system149-151. Additionally, C3-targeted intervention may provide broader therapeutic
control of complement-mediated inflammatory damage in COVID-19 patients152.
Catalase (CAT) was downregulated in the lung, white pulp of spleen, liver and renal
cortex of COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 7). It is an important antioxidant enzyme in the
process of defense against oxidative stress153. It is preferentially expressed in the alveolar
epithelial cells. The downregulated CAT has been reported in the fibrotic lungs of human,
which may be associated with the protective role of CAT against inflammation and
subsequent fibrosis associated processes, such as TGF-β expression and collagen content154.

The downregulated CAT may trigger the proinflammation state and contribute to the fibrosis
process in these organs.
Monocyte differentiation antigen (CD14) was upregulated in the white pulp of spleen and
renal cortex of COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 7). It is a surface antigen and preferentially
expressed on monocytes or macrophages, which plays multiple pivotal biological roles, such as
innate immune response to binding bacterial lipopolysaccharide155. Additionally, it has been found
that CD14 was highly expressed in the lung, liver, spleen, and its expression was dynamically
changed in the course of inflammation156. Another study showed that systematic inhibition of
CD14 could reduce organ inflammation, which was tested in lung, liver, spleen, and kidneys.
They also reported that ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were significantly inhibited in the kidneys by
inhibiting CD14157.
Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1) was upregulated in the lung, liver, heart, renal
cortex and medulla of COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 7). It is a member of chitinase family158
and is highly expressed in the liver159. In arthritic articular cartilage, CHI3L1 functions as a
growth-factor for fibroblasts160. In the bleomycin-treated mice, it would decrease transiently
due to its protective role in the injury. Then it would increase and play a profibrotic role in
activating macrophages and inducing the fibroblast and matrix deposition108. The upregulated
CHI3L1 in multiple organs of COVID-19 patients may indicate a profibrotic state.
C-reactive protein (CRP) was upregulated in six organs (except testis) of COVID-19
patients (SI Figure 7). Fibrosis is caused by scar tissue formation in internal organs. Two
closely related human serum proteins, serum amyloid P (SAP), and C-reactive protein (CRP),
strongly affect fibrosis 161. In multiple animal models, and even Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical
trials, CRP indicates the potential of fibrosis162,163. It's worth noting that CRP was significantly
upregulated in almost all of organs based on our analysis. This prompts us that the follow of
CRP levels could potentially indicate the fibrogenesis status of COVID-19 patients.
FGB and FGG were upregulated in the lung but downregulated in the thyroid of
COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 7). They are both blood-borne glycoproteins and components
of fibrinogen, which play a role in vascular injury and dysregulated in thrombophilia164, as
well as a proinflammatory role under several pathologic conditions including pulmonary and
kidney fibrosis165. Fibrinogen was substantially higher in COVID-19 patients than those in
healthy controls166. Meanwhile, in the process of acute phase response, interleukin-6 (IL-6)
could induce upregulation of the three fibrinogens, FGA, FGB and FGG, in liver and lung
epithelium167. Consistent with fibrosis observed in the lung of COVID-19, FGB and FGG
were evaluated in lung but decreased in thyroid.
Glutathione Peroxidase 2 (GPX2) was found to be elevated in the liver of COVID-19
patients (SI Figure 7). GPX2 is a glutathione peroxidase, which catalyzes the reduction of
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by glutathione. Oxidative stress initiates epithelial cell injury and
fibrogenesis. Hence decreasing of glutathione results in hepatic fibrosis 168 and pulmonary
fibrosis169. Elevated GPX2 in the liver predicts fibrogenesis in the liver of COVID-19 patients.
Intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 was upregulated in the spleen, liver, heart, kidney
and thyroid of COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 7). ICAM1 is a member of the immunoglobulin
(Ig) superfamily expressed on fibroblasts and epithelial cells. ICAM deficiency suppresses
cytokine production, white cell infiltration and attenuates fibrogenesis170. The upregulation of
ICAM1 indicates the occurrence of inflammation and fibrosis.

Protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 1 (PTPN1) was upregulated in five organs
(except the heart and testis) of COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 7). It is the founding member of
the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. PTP1B was upregulated in the fibrotic liver, which
may be induced by TGF-β1171. Based on our analysis, the elevated level of PTPN1 can be
observed in the lung, spleen, liver, kidney and thyroid, indicating a potential fibrosis status in
these organs.
Serum Amyloid A1(SAA1) was found to be significantly upregulated in the lung, liver, heart
and kidney of COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 7). SAA1 is a major acute phase protein that is
highly expressed in response to inflammation and tissue injury172. Significant upregulation of
SAA1 may indicate an inflammation status in these organs, which may contribute to fibrosis in the
end.
Superoxide dismutase 1(SOD1) was found to be down-regulated in the spleen, heart, kidney
and thyroid of COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 7). SOD1, a copper and zinc binding protein is an
enzyme for cleaning free superoxide radicals. Superoxide dismutase can act as a potential antifibrotic drug for Hepatitis C related fibrosis173. In our proteomics data, the downregulation of
SOD1 indicates a potential fibrosis status in these organs.
Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1(VCAM1) was upregulated in the kidney of COVID-19
patients (SI Figure 7). It is a cell surface sialoglycoprotein expressed by cytokine-activated
endothelium. VCAM1 is upregulated in IPF, which is responsive to TGF- β1174. The upregulation
of VCAM1 in the kidney may indicate the fibrosis potential in COVID-19.

process. The y-axis stands for the protein expression ratio by TMT-based quantitative proteomics.
Pair-wise comparison of each protein between COVID-19 patients and control groups was

Stage 3: Proliferation
β-arrestin1 (ARRB1) was downregulated in the lung, white pulp of spleen, liver and renal
medulla of COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 8). It has been demonstrated to function as a
molecular scaffold that regulates cellular function by interacting with other partner proteins, and
involved in multiple physiological processes including immune response, tumorigenesis and
inflammation175. The β-arrestins are universally expressed, but the neural and immune systems
have a much higher expression level. Previous studies have reported that ARRB1 specifically
regulates the survival and homeostasis of CD4+ T cells and thus affects the adaptive immune
responses176. The downregulation of ARRB1 in lung, spleen, liver and kidney in COVID-19
patients further suggests an end-stage immune response in COVID-19 patients. In addition,
ARRB1 has been reported to stimulate several signaling pathways involved in fibrosis, such as
TGF-β pathway. These pathways would affect cell growth, extracellular matrix deposition and
activation of inflammation177. The dysregulated ARRB1 may participate in the fibrosis process in
COVID-19.
Cadherin 2 (CDH2) was downregulated in the renal cortex of COVID-19 patients (SI Figure
8). It can mediate the adhesion between homotypic cells by binding to the CDH2 chain on another
cell’s membrane. In the process of IPF, CDH2 was transformed into CDH11, leading to the
aggravation of pulmonary fibrosis178. Our data show that the expression of CDH2 in the kidney of
COVID-19 patients is decreased. However, the reduction of CDH2 in the renal cortex may be due
to the conversion of CDH2 to CDH11, which needs further investigation.
Stromal cell-derived factor 1 (CXCL12) was upregulated in the thyroid of COVID-19
patients (SI Figure 8). It has been reported as a pre-B cell growth factor and would contribute to
lymphopoiesis and embryogenesis homeostatic processes via regulating the migration of cells 179.
Moreover, exogenous CXCL12 would promote the migration and proliferation of human lung
fibroblasts and CXCR4/CXCL12 plays an important role in IPF180. The upregulated CXCL12 in
the thyroid may be an underlying factor for fibrosis.
Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) was upregulated in the renal cortex of COVID-19
patients (SI Figure 8). It regulates genes and processes in response to hypoxia. It was upregulated
in chronic kidney disease and could promote fibrogenesis 181. The upregulated HIF1A protein in
COVID-19 patients may be an early fibrosis maker.
Insulin receptor (INSR) was upregulated in the white pulp of spleen, liver and thyroid of
COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 8). It binds with insulin or other ligands to activate the insulin
signaling pathway. In C57BL/6 mice, when insulin receptor (InsR) are haploinsufficient, the mice
showed impaired hepatic insulin signaling and promoted liver fibrosis accumulation, which
correlated with the induction of matrix stabilization protein Lysyl oxidase like 2 (Loxl2)182. The
upregulated INSR may indicate the activated insulin signal and a more stabilized matrix.
Integrin alpha-1(ITGA1) was downregulated in the lung of COVID-19 patients (SI Figure
8). It belongs to a subunit of integrin protein family. Together with the beta 1 subunit, ITGA1 is
the receptor for laminin and collagen. Integrins are involved in communicating with the
extracellular matrix, inflammatory cells, fibroblasts and parenchymal cells. Hence, they are

intimately involved in the processes of initiation and maintenance and resolution of tissue fibrosis.
Fibrosis models of multiple organs have demonstrated that integrins have profound effects in
fibrotic process. It is now known that integrins modulate the fibrotic process through activating
TGF-β183. Our results found a declined ITGA1 in the lung, suggesting a potential downregulated
activity of integrin in the lung.
Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) was downregulated in the lung and liver of
COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 8). It is expressed by hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and involves in
the liver fibrosis in mice by silencing the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma
(PPARgamma) 184. However, our data found downregulation of MECP2 in the liver.
Periostin (POSTN) was downregulated in the liver and heart of COVID-19 patients (SI
Figure 8). It is a secreted protein that exists in the extracellular matrix and could promote tissue
remodeling 185. Overexpression of POSTN was reported in the lungs of patients with IPF and
deficiency of POSTN would protect the lung from fibrogenesis induced by bleomycin 186. It was
upregulated after stimulation by TGF-β and would promote extracellular matrix deposition and
mesenchymal cell proliferation. The dysregulated POSTN may participate in the fibrosis process
in COVID-19.
Protein S100-A4 (S100A4) was downregulated in the spleen of COVID-19 patients (SI
Figure 8). It is a fibroblast specific protein and contains two EF-hand calcium-binding domains,
belonging to the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins. It has been studied in many kinds of
fibrosis187.
Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (SERPINE1) was upregulated in the lung, liver, heart renal
cortex and medulla of COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 8). It inhibits the activities of urokinasetype/tissue-type plasminogen activator (uPA/PLTA), plasmin and plasmin-dependent MMP188,
which are all involved in the proteolytic degradation. In the fibrosis tissue, SERPINE1 is
significantly upregulated. Based on our analysis, elevated SERPINE1 may indicate a potential
fibrinolysis inhibition in these organs and result in fibrosis.
Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was upregulated in the white pulp
of spleen, liver, heart and renal cortex of COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 8). It is an important
regulator of inflammation which is the primary step of fibrosis. It is activated in the inflammatory
stage of tissue fibrosis and promotes fibrosis by inducing ECM189. Based on our analysis,
overexpression of STAT3 may induce fibrosis in COVID-19 patients.
Thrombospondin 1(THBS1) was upregulated in the liver, heart and kidney of COVID-19
patients (SI Figure 8). It is a glycoprotein that is released by platelet α-granules and mediates cellto-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions. THBS1 involves the fibrosis in TGF-β-dependent or independent mechanisms and its antagonist could reduce the fibrosis190. The elevated level of
THBS1 in the liver, heart and kidney may suggest potential fibrosis in COVID-19 patients.
Tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein beta (YWHAB)
was downregulated in the white pulp of spleen, heart and renal cortex of COVID-19 patients (SI
Figure 8). It is a member of the 14-3-3 protein family, which mediates signal transduction by
binding to phosphoserine protein and participates in metabolism, apoptosis and cell cycle
regulation191.

Stage 4: Modification
Tyrosine-protein kinase receptor UFO (AXL) was downregulated in the white pulp of spleen
while it was upregulated in the thyroid of COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 9). It belongs to the
Tyro3-Axl-Mer (TAM) receptor tyrosine kinase subfamily. TAM recognizes growth factors and
transduces extracellular signals into the cell, participating in cell survival and proliferation,
migration, and differentiation. Studies on liver fibrosis indicate that the activation of AXL and
ligand Gas6 is a necessary condition for hepatic stellate cell differentiation and targeting AXL can
inhibit liver fibrosis levels192. Studies have shown that in the model of liver injury induced by

lipopolysaccharide, AXL binds to the ligand Gas6, activates macrophage autophagy, and inhibits
inflammasomes193. These studies indicate that AXL is involved in multiple stages of the fibrosis
process after liver injury. However, there was no difference in the liver of COVID-19 patients. The
upregulated AXL in the thyroid tissue of COVID-19 patients may participate in the fibrosis
process.
BCL2 associated X (BAX) was downregulated in the white pulp of spleen, heart, renal
medulla and thyroid of COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 9). It is a member of BCL2 apoptosis
regulatory protein family. It can promote the release of Cytochrome C, the activation of caspase-3,
and then apoptosis. TGF-β induced inflammation and fibrosis is BAX dependent and null
mutation of BAX can influence the TGF-β stimulated TIMP and MMP expression194.
Fibrosis is the accumulation of ECM components, or simply called collagen, in given
tissues195. Four types of collagens were dysregulated in COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 9).
Collagen alpha-1(I) chain (COL1A1) was downregulated in the heart. It was identified as a
potential biomarker for heart failure progression, and its upregulation was related to the
percentage of heart fibrosis196. The downregulation of COL1A1 may be associated with
myocardial hypertrophy in control groups. Collagen alpha-1(IV) chain (COL4A1) was found
upregulated in the spleen of COVID-19 patients. COL5A1 was found upregulated in the liver and
heart of COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 9). COLV is a minor component of the total hepatic
collagen (10–16%), but it could proliferate rapidly in active fibrogenesis in response to liver
injury197. COLV binds TGF-β1 in the ECM, thus controlling the availability of the pro-fibrotic
cytokine, which mediates fibrogenesis of neighboring cells. TGF-β1 could stimulate COL5A1
mRNA expression in mouse HSC culture, which is followed by deposition of COLV in the culture
matrix with resultant COLI and III fibrillar assembly in the matrix198. The upregulated COL5A1
may suggest damage and fibrogenesis in the liver and heart. COL6A3 was found upregulated in
the spleen and downregulated in the liver, heart and kidney of COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 9).
COL6, along with its derivatives are well-known biomarkers for hepatic fibrosis199,200.
Cathepsin L (CTSL) was upregulated in the lung, white pulp of spleen and thyroid of
COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 9). Cathepsin D (CTSD) was observed upregulated in the lung,
liver, heart and thyroid of COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 9). Cathepsin is a lysosomal cysteine
proteinase that participates in a role of intracellular protein catabolism and has been implicated in
myofibril necrosis in myopathies and myocardial ischemia, and the renal tubular response to
proteinuria201. CTSL was reported as a potential fibrosis marker in the liver, which would regulate
the extracellular matrix degradation and tissue remodeling202. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are
responsible for extensive synthesis and deposition of ECM during liver fibrosis. CTSD has
important functions outside lysosomes including degradation of ECM components when secreted
to the extracellular space203. CTSD was observed upregulated during the activation of rat HSCs
and liver fibrogenesis204. It was reported that CTSD can drive HSCs proliferation and promote
their fibrosis potential in an in vivo mice model205. The upregulated CTSD in COVID-19 patients
may indicate the fibrosis process.
Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 6 (FAS) was upregulated in the lung,
white pulp of spleen and thyroid of COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 9). It is a key member of the
TNF-receptor superfamily as a receptor of TNFSF6/FASLG206. It has been reported that it played
a central role in the programmed cell death, and has been implicated in the diseases of immune
system leading to inflammation 207. The elevated FAS was known in cystic fibrosis lungs208 as

well induced inflammation and fibrosis in the liver by Hepatitis C virus 209. The increased FAS
may indicate inflammation and fibrosis in fatal patients.
Kallikrein B (KLKB1) was downregulated in the lung, renal cortex and thyroid of COVID-19
patients (SI Figure 9). It is a plasma glycoprotein that participates in the surface-dependent
activation of blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, kinin generation and inflammation. The plasma
kallikrein has been reported to activate the TGF-β1 signaling by depredating the latencyassociated protein and is associated with liver fibrosis in patients210. The declined KLKB1 may be
associated with dysregulated blood coagulation.
The transcription factor farnesoid X receptor (NR1H4) was upregulated in the renal cortex of
COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 9). It is ligand-activated and highly expressed in liver, kidney,
intestine and adrenal glands. NR1H4 can reduce liver cell damage and fibrosis by upregulating
small heterodimer companion (SHP), thereby inhibiting the production of Type I collagen and
TGF-β signaling211. The elevated expression of NR1H4 in COVID-19 patients may participate in
the fibrosis process.
Plasminogen (PLG) was downregulated in the heart and thyroid of COVID-19 patients (SI
Figure 9). Its main function is to degrade fibrin clots then bind and activate on fibrin clots. The
function of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) is to regulate micro-environmental
homeostasis and wound healing by inhibiting plasmin-mediated MMP activation212. Plasminogen
is dramatically increased in adults with ARDS. It is reported that additional plasminogen may be
effective in the treatment of lung lesions and hypoxemia during COVID-19 infections213.
Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2(PTGS2) was upregulated in the liver of COVID-19
patients (SI Figure 9). It converts arachidonate to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), a fundamental step in
prostanoid synthesis214,215. Upregulation of PTGS2 results in an increased level of COX-2, which
potentially reduces Th2 immune responses and promotes neutrophil recruitment in hepatic
ischemia/reperfusion injury216. The injury may be related to fibrogenesis217. PTGS2 is
overexpressed in the bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, which was MMP-19 dependent218.
The elevated PTGS2 may indicate that COVID-19 patients are suffering from liver fibrogenesis
by the activated immune system.
Metallopeptidase inhibitor 1(TIMP1) was upregulated in the lung, liver, renal medulla and
thyroid of COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 9). It is a natural inhibitor of the matrix
metalloproteinases. TIMP-1 is related to the deposition of ECM, leading to fibrosis, which is
elevated in the profibrotic environments219. While there is no difference in fibrosis severity
between wild type and Timp1-/- mice, which may be due to the inhibition of inflammation by

The lung is the primary and the only positive organ of virus infection (Table S1). To
investigate the virus induced pathological features, we first focused on the lung proteome. The
most significant pathologic injury in the lung of COVID-19 patients is fibrosis, accompanying
with fibrosis associated fibrous exudation, hyaline membrane formation and alveolar space
collapsed 220 (Figure S1).
As discussed above (Cluster1: Receptor), the expression of ACE2, the known receptor of
SARS-CoV-2, and the expression of CD209 and CLEC4M, two receptors of SARS, shown no
significant changes in COVID-19 patients (Figure 2C). However, a couple of proteins acting as
the cellular entry of other viruses, such as CTSL, CEACAM1 and NPC1, were found upregulated
in the COVID-19 patients (Figure 2C).
During virus replication, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and uncapped mRNA of virus,
known as viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), could trigger the innate immune
response once recognized by the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in the cytoplasm221.
According to the PRRs list221, we found CGAS was upregulated in the lung of COVID-19 patients
(Figure 5A, SI Figure 10a). The upregulation of CGAS further induces downstream response
including Type I interferon secretion and the release of several other cytokines222.
During the transcription and replication of coronavirus, host gene expression could be
blocked by mRNA suppression and translation shutoff. For example, the N protein has been
adapted to protect viral mRNA from degradation223. The lung is the only organ where SARS-CoV2 viral RNA was tested to be positive in our study. Therefore, we compared the virus associated
pathways in the lung with the ones in other organs (Figure 4C). The trend of EIF2 signaling and
tRNA charging showed a similar trend in the lung and liver (Figure 4A). We found an inhibition of
ARE-mediated mRNA degradation pathway in the lung and an activation trend in all the other
organs (Figure 4C). Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (EIF4E) as the cap-binding protein
in the host cell only increased in the lung of COVID-19 patients (Figure 5A, SI Figure 10a), which
could be a potential target for human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E)224.
Once virus infected the host, viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as
dsRNA, would trigger host immune cells for defense. The major pathology in immune is hyper
inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) increasing and lymphopenia in the peripheral
blood and spleen of these patients (Figures S1,2). The white pulp of spleen consists of T and B
lymphocytes while the marginal zone of white pulp and red pulp contains the APCs.
Pathologically, we observed that white pulp was atrophic while no pathological changes were
observed in the red pulp (Figure 1), the latter of which is consistent with our proteome data (Table
S4).
In the lung of COVID-19 patients, high affinity immunoglobulin gamma Fc receptor Ⅰ
(FCGR1A) and low affinity immunoglobulin gamma Fc receptor Ⅱ-a (FCGR2A) was upregulated
(Figure 5A). While in the spleen, high affinity immunoglobulin epsilon receptor subunit gamma
(FCER1G), FCGR1A and FCGR2A were all upregulated (Figure 5A). These receptors expressed
on the monocytes surface for antigen presentation. TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) was

upregulated in the spleen of COVID-19 patients, which plays a role in dendritic cell maturation
and stimulation of naïve T cell225. TYRO protein tyrosine kinase-binding protein (TYROBP) was
upregulated in the lung and spleen of COVID-19 patients, which is involved in NK cell anti-viral
function and inflammatory reactions226. All these proteins participating innate cell activity indicate
the activated antigen presenting process or anti-viral functions.
The activation of NK cells might also be negative feedback for the decreasing T-, Blymphocytes. Consistently, the adaptive immune associated pathways including B cell receptors
signaling, NFAT in regulation of the immune response were all inhibited (SI Figure 10b).
Tyrosine-protein kinase (LCK), which actives CD8 T cell combined with LR2R227, was
downregulated (Figure 5A). CEACAM1 as a negative regulator of adaptive immune also
upregulated (Figure 5A) which indicated the immunosuppression state in the COVID-19 patients
and might strengthen the proinflammatory cytokine secreted.
Except for the above proteins, a well-known immunosuppression molecular, CD274 (PD-L1),
is upregulated significantly (Figure 5A) and PD-1, PD-L1 pathway was activated (SI figure 10c)
in the spleen of COVID-19 patients. When mapping our data with an immune checkpoint database
including 21 immune checkpoint proteins 228, we found three dysregulated proteins, including
CEACAM1, CD276 and CD274 (Figure 5A). Upregulation CEACAM1 and CD276 appeared in
the lung and upregulation of CD274 was in the spleen. The upregulation of these checkpoint
proteins may indicate the suppression of adaptive immune function.
The proinflammatory state including the excess cytokines would induce tissue injury. M2
macrophages mainly participate in the wound healing and tissue repair process. Sterol 26hydroxylase (CYP27A1) was upregulated in the COVID-19 patients (Figure 5A), which promotes
M2 conversion through increasing 27HC synthesis 229. In addition, the maker of M2, CD163, was
upregulated in six organs (except testis), indicating that the wound healing and tissue repair have
been induced in the COVID-19 patients. Due to the excess export of lymphocytes to other injury
organs and increased apoptosis, exhausted lymphocytes and the white pulp may atrophy 230.
In summary, these dysregulated proteins and enriched pathways suggest that the innate
immune was activated, the APCs were activated and increased with simultaneous wound healing,
while the adaptive immune was inhibited, which indicates the hyper inflammation state in the
COVID-19. To further validate the immune state in COVID-19, we performed the
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for immune cells in the spleen and found that total T cell
(CD3), T helper cells (CD4), cytotoxicity T cells (CD8), and B cells (CD20) all decreased in the
spleen (Figure S6). On the contrary, macrophage (CD68), especially M2 (CD163) all increased
(Figure S6). These hyper inflammation state might further induce tissue over-repair and fibrosis.

In the COVID-19 group, the main pathological changes in the liver are the steatosis and
coagulative necrosis (Figure S1). Pathway analysis of 1,969 significant dysregulated proteins in
the liver shown the acute phase response signaling, eIF2 signaling, fatty acid α and β-oxidation,
necroptosis signaling pathway, apoptosis signaling and stearate biosynthesis were activated while
the xenobiotic metabolism was inhibited (SI Figure 11a). Several key proteins related to
necroptosis were shown in SI Figure 11b. The steatosis and necrosis processes are always
accompanied by inflammation 231,232. Thereby, we mapped our differentially expressed proteins in
the liver with the immunological proteins from GSEA-immunologic gene sets and then employed
IPA for pathway analysis for the overlapping proteins (SI Figure 11c). The key proteins
participating in these pathways are shown in Figure 5B. The proinflammatory state in the liver
was reflected with activated IL-6, IL-8 signaling and NF-κB signaling. Remarkably, we found that
hepatic fibrosis signaling (SI Figure 11c) was activated and hepatic fibrosis markers including
metalloproteinase inhibitor 1 (TIMP1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (SERPINE1)233 were
upregulated (SI Figure 11b). These dysregulated proteins might indicate that the chronic
inflammation and fibrosis process have initiated at molecular level though no obvious pathological
changes were observed. This phenomenon might be clinically meaningful for patients who have
recovered to take special care for the potential to develop fibrosis.
We hence propose a hypothetical model in the liver of COVID-19 patients according to the
main pathological changes and the enriched pathways (SI Figure 11d). Firstly, the inflammation
biomarkers, such as C reactive protein (CRP), serum ferritin, IL-6 were significantly elevated in
COVID-19 patients (Figure S2), which might be stimulated by the inflammatory response derived
from the lung through cytokines and immune cells. The upstream regulator, STAT3, and pathway
analysis, NF-κB signaling pathways were enriched, which were induced by cycling IL-1, IL-6 and
IL-8. As a result, the acute phase response was activated and the expression of CRP
upregulated234. Due to the activated NF-κB signaling, the two related catalytic subunits of IKK
kinase complex and its regulatory subunit, IKBKG, NEMO and IKKG, were all upregulated. The
IKK kinase complex induced the degradation of IκB inhibitory molecules and lead to the nuclear
translocation of the NF-κB dimers, which would activate transcription of genes participating in the
immune and inflammatory response235. Besides, the NF-κB could also activate IL-8 signaling and
TNF signaling, which may contribute to hepatic fibrosis process236,237.
Secondly, among the significantly dysregulated transcription factors (Table S5), we noticed
the downregulated hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-alpha (HNF4A) (SI Figure 11b), which regulates
lipid homeostasis in the liver238. The hypoxia state and upregulated STAT3 would reduce the
expression of HNF4A239,240. Following its downregulation, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)
mediated lipids exporting was reduced by downregulated microsomal triglyceride transfer protein
large subunit (MTTP) and apolipoprotein B-100 (ApoB). Meanwhile, the hepatic uptake of fatty
acids was enhanced by upregulated scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SCARB1) (SI Figure
11b). Both reduced lipids exporting and enhanced fatty acids uptake would contribute to the
hepatic steatosis241.
The hepatic steatosis is always associated with insulin resistance, which may be induced by
excess ROS leakage by upregulated fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction242. In
COVID-19 patients, the enzymes and transporters involved in fatty acid oxidation, such as
ACSL3, CPT2, SLC27A4, TMLHE, ECI1, HADHA/B, IVD and SCP2, were significantly

upregulated, leading to the generation of reduced NADH. Moreover, the upregulated ATP synthase
(ATP5F1A/B/C/D/E, ATP5MC1/E/F/B/D/F/O), NADH dehydrogenase and its oxidase involving
oxidative phosphorylation catalyze more energy production, which is benefit for the translation of
acute phase proteins and coagulation factors. Besides, it would lead to the excess generation of
reactive oxygen species (ROS), which induce necrosis243 and insulin resistance. Moreover, the
upregulated voltage-dependent anion-selective channel proteins (VDAC1/2/3), mitochondrial
import receptor (TOMM22/40/40L/5/70) and mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase
(TIMM9) induced the mitochondrial membrane permeabilization244, could all lead to the release
of proapoptotic proteins such as DIABLO, AIFM1 and CYCS and activate apoptosis243.
Thirdly, the xenobiotic metabolism-PXR signaling pathway was downregulated in the liver of
COVID-19 patients. The downregulation of its related enzymes, such as Cytochrome P450 2C9
(CYP2C9), Glutathione S-transferase A1 (GSTA1), UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B7 (UGT2B7),
S-formylglutathione hydrolase (ESD) and Sulfotransferase 1E1 (SULT1E1), could be reasoned by
antibiotics, antivirals and steroids treatment, the widely used therapies of COVID-19245.
In summary, we speculate the pathological damage in the liver of COVID-19 patients is
mainly caused by the severe inflammatory response and the hypoxia status by the viral infection in
the lung, as well as the drug-induced hepatotoxicity during therapy (SI Figure 11d).

Two kinds of pathological changes were observed in the heart of COVID-19 patients. One is
vasogenic edema with mild infiltration of inflammatory cells, and the other is myocardial cell
edema (Figure S1).
Vasogenic edema is mainly caused by the change of vascular permeability, which induces the
serum fluids to flow into interstitium. The increase of vascular permeability is usually caused by
inflammation246,247. Several inflammatory mediators were elevated in the heart tissue of COVID19 patients, including matrix metalloproteinases 9 (MMP9), C5a anaphylatoxin chemotactic
receptor 1(C5AR1), interferon gamma receptor 1 (IFNGR1) and several other cytokines (Fiugre
S7A, SI Figure 12a). Importantly, histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT), which catabolizes
histamine, was significantly downregulated and may lead to histamine accumulation and vascular
hyperpermeability247. The accumulation of inflammatory mediators, such as C5a and histamine,
could induce the P-selectin expression and result in leukocyte extravasation248 (SI Figure 12b).
The above findings were also supported by the upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule 1
(ICAM-1), which involves in leukocyte adhesion and trans-endothelial migration249 and MMP9,
which facilitates matrix degradation and is believed to contributes to inflammatory cell
invasion250. Physiologically consistent, we observed inflammatory cell infiltration by
hematoxylin-eosin staining sections (Figure S1).
Myocardial cell edema is caused by the movement of osmotically active molecules from the
extracellular to the intracellular space including sodium, chloride and water. One of the underlying
pathological mechanisms was the reduced ATP availability in the mitochondria due to dysfunction
of sodium (Na+), potassium (K+) ATPase 251 under hypoxia, inflammation and other conditions252.
These observations strongly indicated a hypoxia situation in COVID-19 patients, and we also
observed consistent molecular changes under hypoxia (SI Figure 12 c). Under aerobic conditions,
the hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) can be ubiquitinated by ubiquitin-activating
enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes E2 (E2), and a substrate-specific ubiquitin-protein
ligase (E3) and then degraded by hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha inhibitor (HIF1AN) 253. In
COVID-19 patients, we identified a decreased expression of HIF1AN, ubiquitin-conjugating
enzyme E2 G1 (UBE2G1) and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 H (UBE2H) (Fiugre S7A),
suggesting the stabilization of HIF-1α under hypoxic conditions. Besides, the heme protein
myoglobin (Mb) specializing in oxygen transport and storage was downregulated. These
observations strongly indicated a hypoxia situation in COVID-19 patients. What’s more,
thioredoxin-2 (TXN2), a redox protein, which is essential for mitochondrial reactive oxygen
species (ROS) homeostasis, is downregulated in our analysis. It is reported that TXN2 deficiency
could lead to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and impaired mitochondrial
function254,255.
In conclusion, the molecular changes in the heart of COVID-19 patients were consistent with
the HE staining result of vasogenic edema and cytotoxic edema. It’s worth noting that the control
samples were collected from dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients. Therefore, the molecular
changes involved in DCM patients, such as pathways related to ATP generation256 should be
considered carefully.

All COVID-19 patients in our study showed a varying degree of acute kidney injury (AKI)
(Table S1). Diffuse proximal tubule injury, brush border lost and microthrombus were observed in
the pathological sections of the cortex, while occasional cellular swelling and atrophy were also
observed in the medulla (Fiugre S1). Generally, more damage was observed in pathological
sections in the renal cortex than in the renal medulla.
Notably, according to the 2016 Third International Consensus Definition for Sepsis and
Septic Shock257 (Table S1), sepsis was observed in the most COVID-19 patients as a complication
(Table S1), with a decrease of platelet, an increase of D-dimer and neutrophil (Figure S2, Table
S1). At the molecular level, we identified a total of 9,544 proteins in the kidney with 1,585
dysregulated proteins in the renal cortex and 642 in the renal medulla (Figure 1). By IPA analysis,
the LPS/IL-1 mediated inhibition of RXR function, acute phase response, IL-8 signaling,
necroptosis and neuroinflammation signaling pathways were found to be upregulated in both
cortex and medulla (SI Figure 13a). Meanwhile, the activated status of the enriched pathways in
the renal cortex are more drastic than in the renal medulla (SI Figure 13a). Besides, the
upregulated pathways including signaling by Rho Family GTPase, Toll−like receptor signaling,
IL-6 signaling and NF -κB signaling and the downregulation pathways including fatty acid
beta−oxidation I, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis were also specifically enriched in the renal
cortex. Thus, at both pathological and molecular levels, SARS-COV-2 has a greater impact on the
cortex than the medulla (SI Figure 13a, Figure S1).

(IL1R1) and vWF were upregulated in renal cortex (Figure S2). LBP could bind to the pathogen
lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and enhance CD14 and Toll-like receptors, which may be the cause of
pathogenic infection and sepsis in these COVID-19 patients258. Another inflammatory cytokine,
Interleukin-1 (IL1) could also induce sepsis259. The IL1R1 was found to be upregulated in
COVID-19 patients, as well as sepsis259,260. Upregulation of the downstream NF-κB complexes
and CCAAT enhancer binding protein beta (CEBPB) were also observed, leading to activation of
IL-6, IL-8, iNOS and TNFR1 signaling pathways261. Besides, activated signal transducer and
activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 1 (RIPK1)
could play a role in apoptosis and tissue damage262-264.
In addition to inflammatory and infection-related proteins, we also detected the upregulation
of hypoxia inducible factor 1 subunit alpha (HIF1A) in the cortex, which could promote TRL2,
vWF overexpression and nitric oxide (NO) generation. These could lead to insulin resistance265 .
Furthermore, HIF1A could suppress energy metabolism-related pathways including fatty acid βoxidation and gluconeogenesis to exacerbate insulin resistance266. As the main ATP provider in the
renal proximal tubular cells, the inhibition of fatty acid β-oxidation would block energy supply
and lead to aggravate kidney injury266. Interestingly, among seven organs, kidney is the only one
in which ACE2 was downregulated (Figure 2C), ACE2 not only acts as the receptor of SARSCoV-2 but could also catalyze the cleavage of angiotensin II (Ang II) into vasodilator angiotensin
1-7 (Ang 1-7). The downregulation of ACE2 could mediate Ang II accumulation and induce the
upregulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1)267, a marker for sepsis and kidney
injury268,269. Likewise, Ang II regulates RhoGTPase via G Protein-Coupled Receptor (GPCR),
indeed the Gα, Gβ and RhoGTPase including RHO and CDC42 were all upregulated in COVID19 patients. ROCK1, a downstream molecular of RHO, was upregulated as well, which could lead
to renal tubular injury, inflammation and fibrogenesis270,271. CDC42 induced CDC42EP4 is an
upstream regulator of SEPTIN family and the upregulated SEPTIN6, SEPTIN7, SEPTIN8 and
SEPTIN9 could induce fibrogenesis in kidney as well, which means SARS-CoV2 infection may
cause chronic injury and affect prognosis in COVID-19 patients272. Meanwhile, the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and β-lactam antibiotics are also possible precipitating factors of
kidney injury273 (Table S1).
In conclusion, renal tissue damage is more severe in renal cortex than in the medulla of
COVID-19 patients, and the AKI may be caused by the combinational effects of hypoxia, bacterial
infection, sepsis induced cytokine storm and drug-induced nephrotoxicity.

Lymphoid infiltration was found in some interfollicular regions in the thyroid of COVID-19.
In our study, 1,297 proteins in the thyroid were dysregulated ((Figure 1) and the top ten pathways
are enriched for these proteins (SI Figure 14a).
Among these enriched pathways, eIF2 and mTOR upregulation might be associated with
protein synthesis and indicate the dysregulation of thyroid function at molecular level. IL-8 and
NF-κB signaling are associated with inflammatory response physically. The pathology associated
pathways including angiogenesis (VEGF signaling), coagulation and thrombin signaling, cardiac
hypertrophy signaling and renin-angiotensin signaling were also enriched (SI Figure 14A). The
key dysregulated proteins in these pathways are listed in the Figure S7D. We proposed a
hypothetical model for thyroid pathology by these key proteins and pathways (SI Figure 14B).
The thyroid is adjacent to the superior respiratory system, thereby would be easily influenced by
the inflammation. Some cytokines and their receptors, such as CXCL12, IL1R1 and IL6ST, were
dysregulated, which could stimulate the NF-κB or mTOR signaling and then induce a series of
downstream cascade reactions. CXCL12 is involved in promoting cell growth and angiogenesis274,
which is associated with mTOR signaling275. In thyroid of COVID-19 patients, mTOR and
CXCL12 were both upregulated (Figure S7D). IL-1 and IL-6 are associated with a variety of

chronic inflammatory response, such as coagulation276 and insulin resistance277 , through
activating NF-κB signaling.
In the thyroid of COVID-19 patients, Cell division control protein 42 (CDC42) and G protein
subunit alpha Q (GNAQ) were both upregulated. CDC42 belongs to GTPase family involved in
the thrombin formulation process278 and GNAQ also belongs to G proteins and is involved in
thrombin signaling279. The upregulated CDC42 and GNAQ may indicate the coagulation response
in the thyroid. Besides, two kinds of coagulation associated protease inhibitors, serine protease
inhibitors (SERPINs) family280 and alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M), were all downregulated in the
thyroid of COVID-19 patients (Figure S7D), which could suppress plasmin and kallikrein53.
Kininogen-1 (KNG1), an alpha-2-thiol protease inhibitor, was also downregulated in the thyroid
of COVID-19 patients (Figure S7D), which could disturb kinin-kallikrein system281.
Neuroendocrine convertase 2 (PCSK2), insulin receptor (INSR) and carboxypeptidase E
(CPE) all participate the insulin processing and their secretion is regulated by mTOR in insulin
resistance282, which also matched with our data (Figure S7D).
Altogether, the thyroid is mainly affected by the inflammatory response after virus infection,
in which the activated NF-κB and mTOR signaling could have an association with coagulation,
insulin resistance and VEGF involved angiogenesis.

sterol reductase TM7SF2 (TM7SF2).
Although those proteins are unrelated to the virus directly, the cholesterol synthesis is
associated with steroid hormones such as testosterone. The low intracellular concentration of
sterols would induce the cleavage of membrane bound sterol response element-binding protein
(SREBP) by SREBP cleavage-activation protein (SCAP), then cleaved SREBP in the cytosol
would enter the nucleus to activate expression of proteins participated in cholesterol biosynthesis
and uptake process283.
Delta (14)-sterol reductase is encoded by TM7SF2, which can be activated in response to low
cell sterol levels mediated by SREBP2284. TM7SF2 is detected in Leydig cells specifically by
antibody staining285, the decrease of which suggested impaired Leydig cell population or function.
We also found a Leydig cell biomarker, INSL3, was decreased (SI Figure 15). INSL3 was first
isolated from the boar testis cDNA library and is expressed uniquely in fetal and postnatal Leydig
cell286. INSL3 is mainly produced in gonadal tissues in male and female287 and is known to be
associated with testicular descent288,289. Three independent studies reported the association of
INSL3 gene mutation with human cryptorchidism, which is a common congenital abnormality in
testis290-292. INSL3 seems to function within the testis as an important supplementary downstream
effector of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis287. Free from acute regulation of HPG
axis, it can reflect the differentiation status and the number of the Leydig cells present293. The
unique INSL3 receptor, RXFP2, has been identified at mRNA and protein levels on both Leydig
cells themselves294 and also on germ cells within the seminiferous compartment295. The most
significantly decreased proteins in the testis is INSL3, which indicates Leydig cell reduction and
might associates with diabetes296 as well.
The hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis comprises of pulsatile GnRH from the
hypothalamus. It will impact on the anterior pituitary to induce expression and release of both LH
and FSH into the circulation. These will, in turn, stimulate receptors on testicular Leydig and
Sertoli cells, respectively, to promote steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis. Both Leydig and
Sertoli cells exhibit negative feedback to the pituitary and/or hypothalamus via their products
testosterone and inhibin B, respectively, thereby allowing tight regulation of the HPG axis. In
particular, LH exerts both acute control on Leydig cells by influencing steroidogenic enzyme
activity, as well as chronic control by impacting on Leydig cell differentiation and gene
expression287.
Significantly decreased INSL3 indicates the decreased number of mature Leydig cells in the
patients with COVID-19, which is consistent with the HE staining images (Figure 7B, C).
Interestingly, Ma et al observed significantly elevated serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and
dramatically decrease in the ratio of testosterone (T) to LH and the ratio of follicle stimulating
hormone (FSH) to LH, while no statistical difference in serum T (p=0.0945) or FSH
(p=0.5783)297. We inferred the change on LH might be caused by the reduced number of mature
Leydig cells, which would cause the decreased serum T. Weakened negative feedback from
Leydig cells might promote the secretion of LH.
FASN, ACLY, SQLE and FDFT1 all participate in lipid synthesis directly. Fatty acid synthase
is a key enzyme in de novo lipogenesis. FASN is markedly inactivated under conditions of insulin
resistance and is a potential biomarker for insulin resistance298. Reduced FASN suggested the
progression of insulin resistance in COVID-19 patients. This protein has been discussed in the
fibrosis process associated proteins.

ACLY is the enzyme primarily responsible for the production of extramitochondrial acetylCoA and is thus strategically positioned at the intersection of glycolytic and lipidic metabolism299,
which make it a potential target for lipid lowing300. FDFT1 and SQLE play an important role in
the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, and both of them are effective targets in the treatment of
hypercholesterolemia301,302. ACLY, SQLE and FDFT1 were observed downregulated in the testis
tissue of COVID-19 patients compared with non-COVID-19 controls (SI Figure 15), which was
consistent with a previous study discovering lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
and total cholesterol levels in COVID-19 patients as compared with normal subjects303.
There are two dysregulated proteins associated with sperm generation. RNF216 is essential
for spermatogenesis and male fertility304. The deletion of Drc7 leads to aberrant tail formation in
mouse spermatozoa that phenocopies patients with multiple morphological abnormalities of the
sperm flagella (MMAF)305. These two proteins were reduced in COVID-19 patients (SI Figure
15), suggesting the impairment of spermatogenesis and sperm motility caused by SARS-CoV-2
infection.
Store-operated calcium entry-associated regulatory factor (SARAF) was downregulated in
the testis of COVID-19 patients (SI Figure 15), which inactivates the store operated calcium entry
machinery to prevent excess calcium refilling306.
In conclusion, reduced INSL3 and five cholesterol biosynthesis related proteins suggests
damage to Leydig cells and their steroidogenic functions (Figure 7D). Decrease of DRC7 indicates
impaired sperm mobility. Future investigations of Leydig cell functions and sperm mobility of
alive COVID-19 patients are needed since our observations are based on autopsies.
