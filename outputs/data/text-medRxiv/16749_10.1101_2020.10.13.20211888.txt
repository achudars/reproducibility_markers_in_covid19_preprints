Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly transmissible illness that spreads rapidly
through human-to-human transmission. To assess the knowledge and practices of Palestinians
towards COVID-19 after the ease of movement restrictions, we collected data from Palestinian
adults between June 15th and June 30th 2020. The participants’ pool represented a stratified
sample of 1355 adults from Palestinian households across 11 governorates in the West Bank.
The questionnaire included 7 demographic questions, 13 questions about participants’
knowledge and awareness of COVID–19, and 4 questions regarding the participants’ safety
measures that had been taken in the last three months. Based on the results of this study, we
conclude that the majority of participants have a good knowledge about COVID-19, but were not
adequately committed to the infection control measures necessary to protect themselves and
others. The findings may provide valuable feedback to lawmakers and health administrators to
prevent the spread of the epidemic.
Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019, known as COVID-19, is an infectious respiratory disease caused by
novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 [1] and is spread through human-to-human transmission by
body fluid droplets from the mouth or nose, which can spread when a COVID-19 patients talk,
coughs or sneezes. The virus can also spread through indirect contact with contaminated surfaces
[2][3]. The common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, dry coughing, and fatigue and may
lead to more serious symptoms such as difficulty in breathing and chest pain [4].
Since its emergence in Wuhan, China in December 2019 [5], SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly
around the globe and was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a global
pandemic [6], [7].
Daily, new cases and deaths are being reported worldwide[8]. Many countries have imposed
lockdown and movement control. The effectiveness of these mitigation measures is highly
dependent on cooperation and compliance of all members of society. Adherence to mandated
protective measures is essential in stopping the spread of the virus but is also dependent on the
population’s overall knowledge, attitudes and awareness, according to KAP theories[9]–[11].
Studies conducted during the SARS outbreak in 2003 suggest that knowledge, attitudes and
practices towards viruses are associated with emotions among populations and can play an
integral role in determining a society’s readiness to accept behavioral change measures from
health authorities, especially that a gap still exists in the knowledge of the epidemiology,
prevalence and clinical spectrum of Covis-19 [12]–[15].
A first round cross-sectional survey was conducted between April 19th and May 1st 2020, data
was collected through Computer Assisted Phone Interviewing (CATI) using resident phone
numbers available through the Reach Calling Center [16]. Here, we conducted a second round
cross-sectional survey between June 15th and June 30th 2020, designed to assess the knowledge
and practices towards COVID-19 among Palestinians after the ease of restrictions.

Materials and Methods
Participants
This cross-sectional study was conducted between June 15th and June 30th 2020.
The study involved 1355 participants from 11 governorates, including 112 localities
(supplementary table 1). 1395 households were selected using 3-stage cluster sampling. The
cluster of households or census track is considered to be a geographic location that is comprised
of approximately 100 households. The process for conducting cluster sampling was carried as
follows: (1) Selecting a cluster of households (2) Selecting 10 households randomly from each
cluster and (3) Selecting a person at random from the selected household. The clusters were
selected using probability proportional to size (PPS) sampling (Table 1).
To select the number of clusters within each population location: (1) we calculated the sampling
interval which equals the total number of households divided by the total number of clusters
need to be selected by the sample say for example (m). The sampling interval SI= N/m, where N
is the total number of households. (2) We selected a random number R0 between 0 and SI. (3)
calculated Ri as R0+i*SI, a cluster is selected in Li if Ri belongs to the interval [ Ci-1, Ci].
Field work was carried out between 15thth June 2020 and 30th June 2020 by a team of registered
nurses, laboratory technicians, nursing students and laboratory technician students from the Arab
American University following standardized health protocols (World Health, 2020).
Approval from National ethical committee was obtained (PHRC/HC/718/20). Written informed
consents were obtained from the 1355 study participants.
Measures
The questionnaire included 13 questions about participants’ knowledge and awareness of
COVID–19 (Table 1). Since all questions were dichotomies (Yes/No) style, a correct answer was
assigned 100 points and an incorrect answer was assigned 0 points. ANOVA test was used to
calculate the significance.
The questionnaire also included 4 questions about the practices (Table 2). 100 points was
assigned to full compliance and 0 points was given to lack of compliance within a given
dimension.

Data Analysis
Data analysis was conducted using the statistical software (IBM SPSS 23.0) to produce a
preliminary cross-tabulation of the study variables with the background indicators. This
statistical report is comprised of cross-tabulations of all the study variables representing
knowledge and practice as well as the demographic characteristics of respondents.
Knowledge Score was calculated as (SQ3_1+SQ3_2+…+SQ3_12+SQ3_13)/13 based on the
dimensions given in table 1 and Practice score was calculated as
(SQ4_1+SQ4_2+SQ4_3+SQ4_4)/4 based on the dimensions given in Table (2).

Results
A total of 1355 participants from 1395 households across 11 governorates, including 112
localities (supplementary table 1). The sample included 26% in age group (15-24), 23% in age
group (25-34), 28% in age group (35-49) and 23% tests in age group (50+). In total, the sample
included 1218 males and 137 females.
We used ANOVA to test the bivariate relationship between knowledge score (dependent
variable) and educational level as independent variable. The study showed an average
knowledge score of 62 points out of 100 points. Our results show a statistically significant
difference in knowledge between respondents who completed lower education vs those who
completed higher education (P-value=0.048) (Table 3.A), and a statistically significant
correlation between knowledge and age (p-value=0.008). The highest knowledge score (68
points) was reported among Palestinians with age category 50 – 59 years of age, while the lowest
score (63 points) was among those with ages less than 39 years (Table 3.B). No significant
difference was observed in females compared to males (P-value=0.53) (Table 3.C).

Discussion
This is a second round cross-sectional survey done in Palestine to examine the knowledge and
practices towards COVID-19 among Palestinians.

In our study, we found that the majority of participants had a good base of knowledge about
COVID-19, which is consistent with other studies conducted worldwide [14], [17] and with our
first round study [16]. However, there was a low practice of health measurements among the
participants.
Our results indicate that participants with higher educational level are more knowledgeable and
apply better practices than those with lower educational level. This is consistent with a study
conducted in Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait which reported high education level as an
important predictor of greater COVID-19 knowledge scores (p<0.01) [18].
The differences between the two scores were statistically significant with P-value=0.048, 0.000
respectively. On another note, Our study also shows a statistically significant correlation between
knowledge and age as well as good practice and age (p-value=0.008, p-value=0.037,
respectively). The lowest knowledge score was among those with ages less than 39 years and
practice score was among age group 15 – 29 years old. This result implies that efforts should be
put to draw target groups and implement COVID-19 education on people with lower educational
level and age groups less than 39 years old. These findings clearly indicate the importance of
drawing target groups and implementing COVID-19 knowledge of targets via health education
and media as this may both improve their outlook, motivate individuals to make appropriate
decisions and result in safer personal practices, especially that good practice of hand hygiene,
regular use of masks and gloves, social and physical distancing and self-quarantine have proven
to limit prevalence of many infectious diseases and reducing the widespread infections [19],
[20].
Our data shows that even though there is no significant difference between females and males in
terms of their knowledge about COVID-19, practices score among Palestinians females is higher
than that among Palestinian (P-value=0.004). This may be a consequence of females
experiencing higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression [21]. A survey conducted by KFF
found that women are more likely than men to worry about the negative consequences of the
pandemic and to report mental health effects from worrying about coronavirus. The study
reported that women stay at home instead of going to work, school, or other regular activities
[22]. In this respect, women tend to maintain social distancing and play an essential role in
public health management [23].
Lastly, our study shows that the first two practices dimensions which address the avoidance of
crowded places compliance with wearing face masks got low knowledge scores, indicating the
need to educate a promote Palestinians to adhere to social distancing measures in order to stop
the spread of COVID-19.
In conclusion, our study provides valuable feedback to lawmakers working to stop the spread of
the virus. Conducting cross sectional surveys on a regular basis is important to facilitate the
implementation of effective policy by enabling health officials to better understand the
knowledge and practices of the Palestinian population towards COVID-19.
