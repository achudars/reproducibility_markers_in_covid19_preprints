Abstract:

2

Background. Serosurveys are essential to understand SARS-CoV-2 exposure and enable population-level

3

surveillance, but currently available tests need further in-depth evaluation. We aimed to identify testing-strategies

4

by comparing seven seroassays in a population-based cohort.

5

Methods. We analysed 6,658 samples consisting of true-positives (n=193), true-negatives (n=1,091), and

6

specimens of unknown status (n=5,374). For primary testing, we used Euroimmun-Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA-IgA/IgG

7

and Roche-Elecsys-Anti-SARS-CoV-2; and virus-neutralisation, GeneScript®cPassTM, VIRAMED-SARS-CoV-2-

8

ViraChip®, and Mikrogen-recomLine-SARS-CoV-2-IgG, including common-cold CoVs, for confirmatory testing.

9

Statistical modelling generated optimised assay cut-off-thresholds.

10

Findings. Sensitivity of Euroimmun-anti-S1-IgA was 64.8%, specificity 93.3%; for Euroimmun-anti-S1-IgG,

11

sensitivity was 77.2/79.8% (manufacturer’s/optimised cut-offs), specificity 98.0/97.8%; Roche-anti-N sensitivity

12

was 85.5/88.6%, specificity 99.8/99.7%. In true-positives, mean and median titres remained stable for at least 90-

13

120 days after RT-PCR-positivity. Of true-positives with positive RT-PCR (<30 days), 6.7% did not mount detectable

14

seroresponses. Virus-neutralisation was 73.8% sensitive, 100.0% specific (1:10 dilution). Neutralisation surrogate

15

tests (GeneScript®cPassTM, Mikrogen-recomLine-RBD) were >94.9% sensitive, >98.1% specific. Seasonality had

16

limited effects; cross-reactivity with common-cold CoVs 229E and NL63 in SARS-CoV-2 true-positives was

17

significant.

18

Conclusion. Optimised cut-offs improved test performances of several tests. Non-reactive serology in true-

19

positives was uncommon. For epidemiological purposes, confirmatory testing with virus-neutralisation may be

20

replaced with GeneScript®cPassTM or recomLine-RBD. Head-to-head comparisons given here aim to contribute to

21

the refinement of testing-strategies for individual and public health use.

Introduction

26

In December 2019, a cluster of atypical pneumonia of unknown origin was described in the region of Wuhan,

27

Hubei province, China. Subsequently, a novel coronavirus was identified as the causative pathogen: SARS-CoV-2

28

(Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2).(1) As the virus spread rapidly across the globe, the Corona

29

Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic on March 12th, 2020.

30

Direct detection of viral nucleic acids or the virus itself in bodily fluids is considered the reference standard of

31

acute infection; primarily identified through the use of nasopharyngeal swabs or other respiratory probes.(2)

32

Additionally, serodiagnostics are valuable in order firstly to identify past infections, asymptomatic or symptomatic,

33

and secondly to elucidate transmission dynamics within the population; both being highly relevant to inform

34

evidence-based political decision making.(3, 4)

35

Several serological test systems have been introduced since the beginning of the pandemic.(5) Most target one of

36

two specific viral structures: parts of the trimeric CoV spike (S1-2) complex or the nucleocapsid (N) envelope

37

protein.(6) While the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S1 folds out to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme

38

2 (ACE2) receptor, the N-protein is involved in viral assembly and replication.(7) To select the most suitable system

39

for different applications, independent evaluations and comparisons of their sensitivities and specificities on

40

different cohorts are of utmost importance; yet, as Cheng et al. state, validations of these tests are often poorly

41

described and evaluations show several shortcomings.(7) Firstly, as most validation studies have been performed

42

with severely sick subjects, proposed cut-off values are ambiguous.(4, 8) Those individuals will likely have higher

43

titres than asymptomatic subjects,(6, 9-12) possibly resulting in a less reliable performance of the test system, or

44

the potential need for different cut-off values in these populations.(13) Secondly, it remains unclear whether the

45

antibodies are serocorrelates of protection, highlighting the gap in knowledge of the underlying biology.(3, 7) And

46

lastly, cross-reactivity with other CoVs has been reported, but its effects on the test readouts remain

47

uncertain.(14-16)

48

Here we present the serological testing systems applied within the Representative COVID-19 Cohort Munich

49

(KoCo19), a prospective sero-incidence study initiated in Munich, Germany, in April 2020.(17, 18) Three

50

independent primary tests (Euroimmun Anti-S1-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA-IgA & -IgG and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Roche

51

N pan−Ig) and a number of confirmatory tests (direct viral neutralisation, GeneScript®cPassTM , Mikrogen-

52

recomLine-RBD IgG line immunoassay, VIRAMED-SARS-CoV-2-ViraChip® microarray) were assessed in a head-to-

53

head cross-comparison. The tests were conducted on samples from (i.) RT-PCR positive individuals (true-positives),

54

(ii.) blood donors from the pre-COVID-19 era (true-negatives), and (iii.) subjects with unknown disease status

55

(unknown). Thus, we were able to generate reliable performance estimates for both primary and confirmatory

56

tests by using true-positive and true-negative individuals from the aforementioned cohorts and to subsequently

57

derive optimised cut-offs for our cohort.

Methods

59

Study design and participants. In total, we included 6,658 samples, derived from a set of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR

60

positives (“true-positives”, n=193), individuals from historical cohorts, blood donors without any indication of

61

SARS-CoV-2 infection (“true-negatives”, n=1,091), and specimen of unknown status (n=5,374); details on the

62

cohort characteristics, including collection-timepoints, can be found in the appendix (p.1; p.4 supplemental table

63

1).

64

The study was approved by the Ethics Commission of the Faculty of Medicine at LMU Munich (20-275-V) and the

65

protocol is available online (www.koco19.de ).17

66
67

Laboratory Assays. All described analyses were performed using EDTA-plasma samples (appendix pp.1 for further

68

details on assays performed, and p.7 supplemental table 3 for details on platforms and units applied).

69

Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA anti-S1 IgA/IgG (hereafter called EI-S1-IgG, EI-S1-IgA; Euroimmun, Lübeck,

70

Germany) test kits were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Measurement values were obtained

71

using the quotient of the optical density measurement provided by the manufacturer’s software. We evaluated

72

Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Roche anti-N pan-Ig (hereafter called Ro-N-Ig; Roche, Mannheim, Germany) in

73

accordance with the manufacturer’s guidelines. Values reported are the Cut-Off-Index (COI) of the individual

74

samples. Operative replicates of the same samples were performed to assess reliability of primary assay

75

performance.

76

For confirmatory testing, we conducted micro-virus neutralisation assays (NT) as described previously,(19) with

77

the exception that confluent cells were incubated instead of adding cells following neutralisation reaction

78

(appendix pp.1). We classified samples with a titre <1:10 as "NT-negative" and samples with a titre ≥1:10 as "NT-

79

positive". The dilution steps indicated are <10, 10, 20, 40, and >80.

80

SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus neutralisation test (GS-cPass; GenScript®, Piscataway, New Jersey, USA) was used to

81

measure binding inhibition, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The inhibition was calculated in

82

percentages, ranging from -30 to 100.

83

For SARS-CoV-2 ViraChip® microarray (VIRAMED Biotech AG, Planegg, Germany; hereafter named VC-N-

84

IgA/IgM/IgG; VC-S1-IgA/IgM/IgG; VC-S2-IgA/IgM/IgG) execution followed the manufacturer’s instructions. We

85

obtained measurement values by the automated ELISA-processor in arbitrary units.

86

As outlined by the manufacturer, we conducted the recomLine SARS-CoV-2 IgG line immunoassay (MG-S1, MG-N,

87

MG-RBD; Mikrogen, Neuried, Germany), values below the cut-off of 1 were categorized “negative” without

88

quantitative information. Common-cold CoV-2 targets of 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 were included in the

89

aforementioned assay.

91

Statistical Analysis. Prior to analysis, we cleaned and locked the data. For the analyses and visualisation, we used

92

the software R, version 4.0.2. Only one sample per individual was included in the statistical analyses; in case of

93

individuals with multiple blood samples, we only considered the sample with the most complete dataset. For

94

multiple measurements with complete datasets, we only included the first measurement; for operational

95

replicates we used the latest. We subsequently carried out sensitivity and specificity analyses for true-negative

96

and true-positive samples over all the tests performed.

97

We report square roots R of coefficients of determination for association among continuous variables. For paired

98

sample comparisons, we applied Wilcoxon-sign-rank tests, whereas for multiple group comparisons we applied

99

Kruskal-Wallis tests, followed by post-hoc Dunn tests using the Benjamini-Yekutieli adjustment for pairwise

100

comparisons.(20)

101

Using true-positives and true-negatives, we determined optimised cut-off thresholds and their confidence

102

intervals by a nonparametric bootstrap. In a similar way, we trained random forest and support vector machine

103

classifiers. We calculated estimates for sensitivities, specificities, and overall prediction accuracies for all

104

considered cut-off values and classifiers. This calculation was done on out-of-sample observations to avoid

105

overfitting and thus overoptimistic performance measures. Details on the algorithms are outlined in the appendix

106

(pp.2).

Results

117

We assessed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a total of 6,658 independent samples using EI-S1-IgA (n=6,657), EI-S1-IgG

118

(n=6,658), and Ro-N-Ig (n=6,636) (figure 1, appendix p.4 supplemental table 1). Supplemental table 2 presents an

119

overview of all tests performed (appendix p.5); table 1 outlines sensitivity and specificity of both primary and

120

confirmatory tests by applying both manufacturers’ and optimised cut-offs.

121
122

Performance of Primary Tests. When we applied optimised cut-offs to the true-positive and true-negative

123

samples, EI-S1-IgA had a sensitivity of 64.8% and a specificity of 92.6%, while EI-S1-IgG had a sensitivity of 79.8%

124

and a specificity of 97.8% (table 1). The measurement value distribution of the EI-assays is depicted in figure 2A.

125

In the second half of the study period, a decrease in overall IgA-positivity was observed, while overall IgG-positivity

126

remained stable. Subsequent retesting of biobanked samples of the first weeks of sampling with kits of later

127

batches demonstrated overall lower IgA-positivity rates than in the first measurements. This was likely caused by

128

a batch effect, as retesting of samples from the second half of the sampling period did not reproduce these

129

findings; for the first period, it led to changes in classification from positive to negative in the operational replicates

130

(depicted as “positive-negative” in figure 2B and appendix p.8 supplemental figure 1A).

131

The sensitivity and specificity of Ro-N-Ig with optimised cut-offs were 88.6% and 99.7%, respectively (table 1). Re-

132

testing measurement values confirmed a correlation of R=1 for the quantitative measurement values without a

133

single classification change (0/423) (figure 2B, appendix p.8 supplemental figure 1B). For all three assays, few

134

samples tested false-negative (appendix p.26, supplemental figure 8).

135

For evaluation of primary test concordance, we excluded EI-S1-IgA due to inferior performance in sensitivity and

136

specificity. The concordance between EI-S1-IgG and Ro-N-Ig was 98.5% (6,538/6,636), where 4.0% (264/6,636) of

137

the samples were classified as positive and 94.5% (6,274/6,636) as negative unanimously. Of the remaining

138

samples (1.5%; 98/6,636), 56.1% (55/98) were classified as positive by El-S1-IgG and negative by Ro-N-Ig (figure

139

4A), while the remaining 43.9% (43/98) were negative for EI-S1-IgG and positive for Ro-N-Ig. To clarify their true

140

serostatus, confirmatory testing was performed where possible (appendix p.26 supplemental figure 8).

141

To assess the dependence of result read-out on sampling timepoints, we considered the temporal distribution of

142

baseline titres over the sampling period (appendix pp.11 supplemental figure 2). Here, we considered the mean

143

and median sample values above and below cut-off separately and found them to be comparable over the whole

144

sampling period. Samples from blood donors were available from two distinct sample timepoints (before and after

145

the common cold season). We noticed discrete baseline titre increases in spring without significant changes in

146

overall positivity rate (appendix p.14 supplemental figure 3).

147

To assess the dynamics of the antibody levels in RT-PCR positive subjects, we analysed the measurement values

148

between the RT-PCR test and blood sampling for three time intervals: <30 days, 30-90 days, and >90 days. Across

149

the whole cohort, we did not observe an initial rise of EI-S1-IgA and EI-S1-IgG but found that EI-S1-IgA decreased

150

at later time points (p=0.02), while the distribution of EI-S1-IgG remained steady (figure 3). For Ro-N-Ig COI we

151

detected an increase in antibody levels (p<0.001), most notably between <30 and 30-90 days (p=0.02).

152
153

Performance of confirmatory tests. A sample subset (n=362; figure 1) underwent confirmatory testing. The

154

overall confirmatory test performance is presented in figure 5 and table 1. The sensitivity was 73.8% for direct NT

155

(1:10 dilution), 96.3% for GS-cPass, and 94.9% for MG-RBD. All three tests had a specificity close to 100% (figure

156

5).

157

NT-titres in our cohort were low – mostly 1:10 – and few had high neutralisation titres of 1:80 or above (figure

158

5A). Measurement values for MG-S1 and MG-RBD were often similar, with few samples showing a reaction against

159

S1 (and N) but not RBD (3.7%; 5/134). For the VC-array, sensitivities of both VC-S1-IgG and VC-N-IgG were

160

improved markedly by optimising cut-offs, with gains of >30% (VC-N-IgG 39.8%/93.5%; VC-S1-IgG 65.8/93.4%;

161

table 1, figure 5). Notably, a considerable number of samples (36.0%; 40/111) were reactive against S1 and N but

162

not S2 (figure 5D).

163

Figure 6 and supplemental figures 4, 5, and 10 (appendix pp.16) compare confirmatory tests. For surrogates of

164

viral neutralisation, 3.2% (3/95) were positive in NT and GS-cPass but not in MG-RBD (figure 6D).

165
166

Associations of confirmatory and primary tests. To examine pretest probability of assays following positive initial

167

testing, the measurement values of all primary and confirmatory tests were correlated (figure 7, appendix pp.19

168

supplementary figures 6, 7, 9). Overall, we observed good correlations, particularly for GS-cPass and MG-RBD with

169

EI-S1-IgG (figure 7B, C), and MG-N with Ro-N-Ig (figure 7H).

170

The categorical concordance for GS-cPass, MG-RBD, and MG-N with both Ro-N-Ig and EI-S1-IgG was similar (94%

171

or above), while the concordance of NT with both primary tests was lower (74%; figure 7A-H). Concordances were

172

improved by applying the optimised cut-offs, especially for VC-S1-IgG and VC-S2-IgG.

173

To derive an algorithm for an optimised testing-strategy, we also investigated potential gains when applying

174

multiple primary tests. Interestingly, combining different primary tests via machine learning techniques (random

175

forest and support vector machine) barely improved the performance beyond what was achieved by Ro-N-Ig alone

176

(table 1), neither could we demonstrate an added value of performing more than one confirmatory test.

177
178

Common cold line blot. Cross-reactivity between common cold CoV anti-N and SARS-CoV-2 anti-N was assessed

179

Discussion

183

We performed head-to-head comparison of seven seroassays for SARS-CoV-2 in a well-defined cohort with 6,658

184

samples. The overwhelming majority of infections could be detected by antibodies even more than three months

185

after infection. In addition, we generated optimised cut-offs which improved sensitivity in primary tests and

186

enhanced the performance of several confirmatory tests. We furthermore showed that surrogate tests, such as

187

GeneScript®cPassTM or RBD line-blot, should be considered instead of the infrastructurally challenging NT in large

188

scale studies, such as vaccine trials or epidemiological surveys. In addition, we observed limited seasonality effects

189

and a significant cross-reactivity with common-cold CoV 229E and NL63 in SARS-CoV-2 true-positive subjects.

190
191

We calculated diagnostic accuracy indicators for seroassays based on true-positive and true-negative samples and

192

derived optimised cut-offs for the evaluated assays. We subsequently applied these to a set of samples of

193

unknown infection status.(17) As reported previously, there is little diagnostic gain from EI-S1-IgA if EI-S1-IgG is

194

used on the same samples.(4) Our study suggests that Ro-N-Ig performs more reliably than EI-S1-IgA and EI-S1-

195

IgG; hence the application of the latter two is of questionable use for low-prevalence settings, considering their

196

lower specificity.

197

For seroprevalence studies it is essential to know how long the measured antibody response remains stable and

198

detectable. There have been different reports of a rapid decline in titre over time.(10, 21) In this analysis, we

199

observed similar declines for EI-S1-IgA titres, which were highest within the first 30 days but dropped significantly

200

thereafter. In contrast, for both EI-S1-IgG and Ro-N-Ig, average titres did not decrease over a period of more than

201

90 days.

202
203

We assessed confirmatory test performances by a subset of true-negative samples. The assays targeting the

204

highly-specific receptor binding domain (NT, GS-cPass, MG-RBD) are considered direct or surrogate markers for

205

viral neutralisation.(22) The cell-culture free tests performed particularly well with sensitivities of 96.3% for GS-

206

cPass and 94.9% for MG-RBD, using the manufacturer’s thresholds. In contrast, we improved the sensitivity for

207

the VC-array markedly by applying optimised cut-offs, with a gain of >50% for VC-N-IgG (39.8%-93.5%) and almost

208

30% for VC-S1-IgG (65.8-93.4%).

209

To generate reliable data for surrogate neutralisation markers (GS-cPass, MG-RBD) feasible for epidemiological

210

purposes, true-positive samples with low neutralising activity are preferable. Our cohort consists mainly of oligo-

211

or asymptomatic COVID-19 subjects – NT-titres observed were generally low as expected – suggesting an NT

212

dilution decrease from 1:10 to 1:5 might improve sensitivity in similar settings. As MG-RBD, GS-cPass, and NT

213

performed similarly and correlated well, suggesting an interchangeability of one another, for example for certain

214

epidemiological questions. NT requires complex BSL-3-laboratory infrastructures (virus-culture) which currently

215

represents a critical bottleneck, while GC-cPass and MG-RBD can be performed under much less stringent safety

216

requirements. While NT is a direct representation of viral neutralisation, GS-cPass assesses the antibody-mediated

217

inhibition of ACE2-interaction with SARS-CoV-2-S1-RBD and is therefore a cell-free neutralisation surrogate

218

marker.(23) Both assays are independent of antibody-subclasses. In contrast, MG-RBD solely detects the RBD-IgG-

219

antibody interaction. The discrepant results in our sample set (figure 6D) suggest either a different neutralisation

220

mode than binding to the RBD as used in MG-RBD, or neutralisation due to other subclasses than IgG.

221
222

The influence of previous or acute infections with common-cold CoV and a resulting cross-reactivity in SARS-CoV-

223

2 assays has been discussed previously.(15, 16) Biologically, it is impacted by the target used, wherein whole virus-

224

or nucleocapsid proteins are particularly prone to cross-reactivity; this also applies for SARS-CoV-2.(6, 14, 15, 24)

225

Comparing true-negative samples from before and after the common cold season, we observed a marginal

226

seasonal increase in the measurement values of EI-S1-IgA, EI-S1-IgG, and Ro-N-Ig (supplemental figure 3). There

227

was a clear association between SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity and reactivity against 229E and NL63 N-protein;

228

this suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals develop a cross-reactivity in the assay against two of the four

229

tested CoV strains. Alternatively, in subjects with previous common cold, this could be explained by a cross-

230

stimulation of pre-existing cells specific to the respective common cold coronavirus strain. Similar findings were

231

described recently in a systematic review.(6)

232
233

Using the best-performing primary tests (EI-S1-IgG and Ro-N-Ig), we observed a relevant number of discordantly

234

classified samples (1.5%; 98/6,636; appendix p. 27 supplemental figure 8). Constellations of Ro-N-Ig negative and

235

EI-S1-IgG positive were observed frequently (56.1%; 55/98), with many samples being true-negatives (41.8%;

236

23/55), but none being true-positive (0%; 0/55). The overwhelming majority of those with unknown infection

237

status were negative in NT and GS-cPass (87.5%; 28/32). As the testing principle of EI-S1-IgG is based on S1-

238

reactivity, positive virus neutralisation or a neutralisation surrogate can be expected if the reaction is specific,

239

suggesting unspecific cross-reactivity in this group.

240

In contrast, discordant serology with Ro-N-Ig positive and EI-S1-IgG negative was less frequent (43.9%; 43/98),

241

mostly from true-positives >40 days after positive RT-PCR (16.3%; 16/98). This is strongly suggestive of an inability

242

of these individuals to mount a detectable response against S1 during the natural infection. Late or lacking

243

seroconversion has been described previously, mostly in oligo- or asymptomatic subjects.(25, 26) Reports

244

speculated about vastly varying proportions of subjects unable to mount an antibody response detectable by

245

commonly used assays.(21, 27, 28) In a systematic review by Huang et al., the median detection time across

246

different antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was 11 days, similar to SARS-CoV-1;(6) however, serological kinetics vary

247

across the severity gradients of symptoms.(6, 9-11) Additionally, misclassification of subjects might have occurred

248

due to RT-PCR-sample mix-up, unspecific reactivity, or contamination in the PCR-test; plausible scenarios in the

249

current pandemic situation where clinical and laboratory infrastructures are overburdened with high sample

250

volumes. In oligo- or asymptomatic subjects, a positive RT-PCR is often the only evidence of infection with SARS-

251

CoV-2 and therefore a misclassification might not be detected.

252

In our cohort of mostly oligosymptomatic true-positive subjects, 11.4% (22/193) were not detected in the primary

253

serological tests. Of these, 36.4% (8/22) were below 30 days after RT-PCR. A total of 6.0% (7/116) showed no

254

evidence of seroconversion in the group >90 days after RT-PCR. For one subject, the RT-PCR date was unknown.

255

Overall, in our dataset of samples >30 days after positive RT-PCR, a modest 8.1% (13/160) remained negative.

256
257

In addition to identifying suitable tests dependent upon the approach chosen, applying optimised cut-offs might

258

be a tool to enhance test performance.(4, 29) For EI-S1-IgG, Meyer et al. proposed optimised thresholds for both

259

lower and higher cut-offs.(4) However, a seroprevalence study in Geneva compared both recommended and

260

optimised cut-offs, but did not see any qualitative change.(30) The authors proposed evaluating the

261

manufacturer’s cut-off before routine testing, and highlighted the dilemma of securing both rule-in and rule-out

262

properties to mitigate the risk of incorrect classification in a situation with highly-dynamic pre-test probabilities.(4)

263

For both EI-S1-IgG and Ro-N-Ig we demonstrated that sensitivity improved using optimised cut-offs, while

264

specificity remained similar. Even though these changes seem minimal, they might translate into a high number

265

of incorrect diagnoses when testing is performed on a large scale: this is especially pertinent in low-prevalence

266

settings, as a particularly high specificity is crucial to achieve a high positive predictive value. It may also be

267

preferable to have a more sensitive cut-off for a primary test and confirm the positives with a highly-specific

268

secondary test system in low prevalence settings.(17)

269
270

Our study has several of limitations. Firstly, the samples are mostly derived from subjects with mild to no

271

symptoms and therefore conclusions drawn here might best apply to an epidemiological rather than a diagnostic

272

approach. Further evaluation using specimens from severely ill subjects or from high-prevalence settings will need

273

to be conducted and compared to the enclosed results.

274

Secondly, the dataset used to estimate optimised cut-offs and performance of the tests is not an unbiased random

275

sample, as all were sampled in the city of Munich, Germany. It cannot be ruled out that blood donors are generally

276

healthier than the general population. Furthermore, not all confirmatory tests were performed on all samples;

277

only a subset, namely those with positive results in at least one primary test and a dedicated negative/positive

278

cohort, were tested using these systems. Finally, we did not have information on underlying health conditions

279

known to increase the quantity of polyclonal antibodies.

281

In conclusion, our study provides a head-to-head cross-comparison of tests and can be used as a resource to

282

enable the refinement of testing-strategies for individual and public-health use. We also investigated the

283

correlations of the different test systems in-depth, considering confounders such as seasonality and titres against

284

common-cold CoV strains. By combining a diagnostic accuracy approach in a well-defined sample set with true-

285

positive as well as true-negative specimens and extrapolating the established findings to samples derived from a

286

population-based seroprevalence cohort, we were able to identify reliable test systems for our Prospective COVID-

287

19 Cohort Munich (KoCo19).(17)

Table 1: Manufacturer's and optimised cut-off, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy
Evaluation of diagnostic accuracy of primary tests was conducted with samples from true-positives (n=193) and true-negatives (n=1073); subsequently, optimised cutoffs were applied to the KoCo19-cohort (see Methods).
* For NT, dilutions starting at 1:10 were used; see Methods.
** The random forest and the support vector machine combine all three primary tests, the accuracy measures thus do not relate to specific cut-offs.

Figure 1: Cohort composition and characterisation of the study participants.
True-positives were defined as subjects with a positive RT-PCR; true-negatives as blood donors from the pre-COVID-19 era. In addition, we included individuals
recruited into the Representative COVID-19 Cohort Munich (KoCo19), 100 of which were considered as true-negatives. For each participant, a single sample was used
for statistical analysis. Among individuals with longitudinal measurements, the blood sample with the most complete dataset was retained. For similar datasets, the
earliest measurement was considered. For operational replicates, the latest measurement was used.

Figure 2: Performance of primary tests .
Results of primary tests for true-negatives (blue), true-positives (orange), and individuals with unknown SARS-CoV-2 status (grey).
(A) Performance of EI-S1-IgA (left), EI-S1-IgG (centre), and Ro-N-Ig (right). Dotted lines mark the manufacturer’s cut-off value (between indeterminate and positive for
EI, and between negative and positive in Ro) and dashed lines mark the optimised cut-off value as determined in this study. Orange and blue solid lines represent the
percentage of test results for true-positives and true-negatives above (blue) or below (orange) the value on the x-axes, respectively. Orange and blue numbers give the
percentage of true-positives and true-negatives, which were correctly detected by the test (without brackets: manufacturers' cut-offs; within brackets: optimised cutoffs). Raw values for EI-S1-IgA show a slightly asymmetric but unimodal distribution for the overall population. The EI-S1-IgG raw values show a bimodal distribution.
Ro-N-Ig raw values/COI demonstrate a narrow distribution with the bulk of values in the range COI 0.1 and below, whereas a clearly separated second population
above COI 10 was observed. For EI-S1-IgG and Ro-N-Ig, the cut-offs separate the blue and orange subpopulations more reliably than for EI-S1-IgA.
(B) Consistency of the primary tests on operational replicates (manufacturer’s cut-offs). The changes from positive to negative status in EI-S1-IgA was most likely
caused by a batch effect. Reliability of the other primary tests was higher.

Figure 3: Time-dependence in primary tests for RT-PCR true-positives.
Titre values of the 187 true-positives with available data on time between RT-PCR and blood sampling for (A) EI-S1-IgA, (B) EI-S1-IgG, and (C) Ro-N-Ig. The read-outs
were categorized according to the time after positive RT-PCR (<30 days, 30-90 days, and >90 days). Plots show the individual read-out (orange dots), a density estimate
(orange area), the 25-,50- and 75-percentiles (black box), and the mean (black dot). Counts n refer to the number of observations above/below manufacturer’s and
optimised cut-off for each of the temporal groups (without brackets: manufacturers' cut-offs; within brackets: optimised cut-offs). Pairwise differences are considered
only after adjusting for multiple testing.
(A) EI-S1-IgA values were highest on average in the category of <30 days and significantly decline thereafter.
(B) EI-S1-IgG values were widespread in the group <30 days, and on average do not decline significantly >90 days.
(C) Similarly, Ro-N-Ig does not decline during the study period; however, raw values increase over time.

Figure 4: Comparison of primary tests.
Results of primary tests compared to ground truth for true-negatives (blue), true-positives (orange), and individuals with unknown SARS-CoV-2 status (grey). The
dotted lines represent the manufacturer’s cut-offs, the dashed lines the optimised cut-offs defined within this study.
(A) Pairwise scatter plots for primary tests: EI-S1-IgA vs. EI-S1-IgG (left; n=6657), and Ro-N-Ig vs. EI-S1-IgG (right; n=6636). Percentages in orange indicate fractions of
true-positives in the respective quadrant with respect to all true-positives; blue for true-negatives. Percentages were calculated using the optimised cut-off. EI-S1-IgA
classified 65% of true-positives correctly and 7% of the true-negatives as positive. EI-S1-IgG classified 80% of the true-positives correctly and 2% of true-negatives
incorrectly. 61% of true-positives were identified by both tests unanimously. Comparing Ro-N-Ig and EI-S1-IgG, 80% of true-positives were concordantly classified as
positive by both tests, while 98% of the true-negatives were classified as negative. Correlation of true-positives between Ro-N-Ig and EI-S1-IgG was R=0.79. The
fraction of true-negatives falsely classified as positives in Ro-N-Ig was below 1%.
(B) Parallel coordinate plot of the primary tests. Magnitude of titres of individual samples across the different assay used were similar. The true-negative samples
presented as a group in Ro-N-Ig. Only few samples display as high EI-S1-IgG and low Ro-N-Ig; on the contrary, most samples with low EI-S1-IgA titres, have higher titres
in EI-S1-IgG and even higher Ro-N-Ig, presenting separately from the negative population.
(C) Concordance of primary tests (based on manufacturer’s cut-offs). Numbers of paired samples are indicated above the bars. In the two columns on the left, the
unspecific reactivity of EI-S1-IgA is represented in green; the concordance of EI-S1-IgG and Ro-N-Ig was pronounced, with 98 (1.5%) discordant results (right bar).
(D) Test results of the primary tests (based on optimised cut-offs). Highest concordance was seen in Ro-N-Ig, lowest in EI-S1-IgA. The proportion of false-negatives in
the true-positive cohort was 34.7%, 19.7%, and 11.4%, respectively. Applying optimised (dashed line) and manufacturer’s (dotted line) cut-off results in a reduction of
false-negatives in EI-S1-IgG and Ro-N-Ig for the optimised cut-off.

Figure 5: Confirmatory tests
Results of confirmatory tests compared to ground truth for true-negatives (blue), true-positives (orange), and individuals with unknown SARS-CoV-2 status (grey). Black
dotted and dashed lines represent the manufacturer’s and the optimised cut-offs, respectively. Orange/blue numbers indicate percentages of true-positives/-negatives
correctly detected by the test.
(A,C) Distribution of results of NT and GS-cPass. At 1:10 dilution, NT endpoint was categorical with a specificity of 100% in this cohort; sensitivity was 73.8%. GC-cPass
manufacturer's cut-off yielded a specificity of 99.1% and a sensitivity of 96%. Adjustments of the cut-off did not improve the performance of the test systems (shown in
parentheses).
(B) Distribution of results of the VC-array (left) and the MG-line blot (right). Bar charts below violin plots represent information for the categorical part of the tests.
Grey numbers give the percentages of positive samples with unknown SARS-CoV-2 as determined by the manufacturer’s and optimised cut-offs. Percentages were
calculated over the total number of samples of unknown SARS-CoV-2 status with available test results. In the VC-array, S1-IgG / N-IgG performed best as confirmatory
tests with 95.4% / 93.5% sensitivity, and 100% / 91.9% specificity, respectively, applying optimised cut-offs. With manufacturer’s cut-offs, sensitivity was 65.7% /
39.8%, respectively. With the optimised cut-off, VC-S2-IgG had a sensitivity of 63.9% and a specificity of 99.1%. Performance of VC-S2-IgA and VC-S2-IgM are presented
for reference in supplemental figure 4 (appendix p.17), demonstrating a potential use in diagnostics settings. MG-N, -S1 and -RBD had sensitivities of 94.9% or higher,
and specificities of 98.1% or higher, no optimisation of cut-offs could not be optimised here.
(D) Parallel coordinate plot of VC-Array and MG. Many subjects do not show S2 reaction although strong reactivity against N and S1 can be detected. Comparing
individual subjects in NP, RBD and S1 reaction indicates that several individuals developed strong N and S1 reactions whereas RBD was not bound. General
concordance between S1 and RBD was, however, observed.
(E) Description of concordance between results comparing each confirmatory test with the ground truth. The colour coding is based on the optimised cut-off.

Figure 6: Comparison of confirmatory tests
Comparison of confirmatory tests for true-negatives (blue), true-positives (orange), and individuals with unknown SARS-CoV-2 status (grey).
(A) Association between the categorical endpoint of NT and the continuous results of GS-cPass. The test results were positively related; in cases of identical
classification agreement with ground truth was frequent. However, more than 20% of true-positives were missed by NT (1:10 dilution; n=354).
(B) Association between the categorical endpoint of NT and the continuous results of MG-RBD. In true-positives with low direct neutralization capacity (NT <10),
distinction between negative and positive populations was observed with GS-cPass (n=272), highlighting the limited sensitivity of NT (1:10 dilution).
(C) Association between GS-cPass and MG-RBD presented with discordant results in 8% (of true-positives) at intermediate test read-outs. The distribution in higher
titre ranges were narrow (n=272).
(D) Parallel coordinate plot of the two neutralization surrogate tests and NT. Samples with high/low raw values demonstrated similarly in all three tests, as lines
present horizontally. However, a subset of individuals with relatively high GS-cPass values and positive outcome in NT were below the cut-off in the MG-RBD assay.

Figure 7: Comparison of primary tests (EI-S1-IgG, Ro-N-Ig) with confirmatory tests (NT, GS-cPass MG-RBD, MG-N).
Comparison of primary with confirmatory tests for true-negatives (blue), true-positives (orange), and individuals with unknown SARS-CoV-2 status (grey).
(A) EI-S1-IgG and NT show positive correlation (n=354), although 1% of the true-positives were missed by NT (1:10 dilution).
(B, C) Correlation of EI-S1-IgG with GS-cPass (n=361) and MG-RBS (n=272) presented as dose dependent for the double-positive values. Concordance for the truepositive subset was >94%.
(D) Association of EI-S1-IgG to MG-N (n=355) presented dose-dependent, but not as markedly.
(E-H) Association between Ro-N-Ig and the confirmatory tests (n=362, n=273, n= 354, n=354) did not present as dose-dependent, compared to EI-S1-IgG. Concordance
between the tests was >95%; except NT, which presented similar patterns to EI-S1-IgG.
We observed a population in the upper left quadrant, (B, C, D), clearly negative in the confirmatory tests.
