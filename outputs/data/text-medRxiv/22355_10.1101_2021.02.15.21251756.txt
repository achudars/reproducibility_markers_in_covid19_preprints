Abstract
Background
Thousands of people in the UK have required end-of-life care in the community during the COVID-19
pandemic. Primary healthcare teams (general practice and community nursing services) have
provided the majority of this care, alongside specialist colleagues. There is a need to learn from this
experience in order to inform future service delivery and planning.

Aim
To understand the views of general practitioners and community nurses providing end-of-life care
during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Design and Setting
A web-based, UK-wide questionnaire survey circulated via professional general practice and
community nursing networks during September and October 2020.

Method
Responses were analysed using descriptive statistics and an inductive thematic analysis.

Results
Valid responses were received from 559 individuals (387 community nurses, 156 General
Practitioners (GPs) and 16 unspecified role), from all regions of the UK. The majority reported
increased involvement in providing community end-of-life care. Contrasting and potentially
conflicting roles emerged between GPs and community nurses. There was increased use of remote
consultations, particularly by GPs. Community nurses took greater responsibility in most aspects of
end-of-life care practice, particularly face-to-face care, but reported feeling isolated. For some GPs
and community nurses, there has been considerable emotional distress.

Conclusion
Primary healthcare services are playing a critical role in meeting increased need for end-of-life care
in the community during the COVID-19 pandemic. They have adapted rapidly, but the significant
emotional impact, especially for community nurses, needs addressing alongside rebuilding trusting
and supportive team dynamics.

How this fits in (4 sentences)
•

This study provides insights into experiences of delivering end-of-life care in the community
during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspectives of UK general
practitioners (GPs) and community nurses.

•

Services have changed and adapted rapidly to meet increased need in terms of both volume
and complexity, with community nurses taking greater responsibility for most areas of
palliative care clinical practice, and GPs undertaking more care planning conversations.

•

While GPs and specialist palliative care services conducted more remote consultations,
community nurses carried out face-to-face end-of-life care and reported a feeling of
isolation.

•

As the pandemic progresses, and the increased need for end-of-life care in the community
persists, more effective service models and multi-disciplinary teamwork in primary care are
urgently needed.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused primary healthcare services (general practice, and community
nursing services including district nurses) to dramatically change their traditional models of service
delivery over a short timeframe. Palliative and end-of-life care for people at home was affected from
the outset (1-3). During the first 10 weeks of the pandemic there was a significant increase in deaths
in the community, particularly in people aged over the age of 75 years. Deaths in care homes
increased by 220% and deaths at home increased by 77%, while deaths in a hospice fell by 20% (4),
presenting significant workload in this area for primary healthcare teams. While guidance
documents for both general practice and community nurses outlined end-of-life care as urgent
priorities (5, 6), there were many new challenges in the delivery of that care, including the need for
more remote consultations and the use of personal protective equipment. Furthermore, there were
concerns about drug and equipment supplies and the need to manage new symptom profiles
associated with COVID-19 (7). Previous research and policy guidance for primary healthcare services
in pandemics do not tend to refer to community end-of-life care, and there was little evidence to
inform and guide the necessary service changes (8, 9).
There is therefore an urgent need to understand more about the role and response of general
practice and community nursing services in the delivery of palliative care during the COVID-19
pandemic in order to inform practice and policy through future phases of COVID-19 and similar
pandemics.
Aims

The study aimed to provide insights and understanding into the experiences and perceptions of
primary healthcare professionals within the United Kingdom (UK) providing palliative and end-of-life
care in the community during the first wave of COVID-19, including how services changed and
adapted.
Method

An online questionnaire study was the most feasible method to meet the research aims, gathering
both quantitative and qualitative data rapidly. The STROBE checklist informed the study design (10).
An online survey instrument was devised, informed by patient and public involvement, a literature
review conducted by this research team (9), the CovPall study of palliative care services (11) and

feedback from a study advisory group of clinicians and commissioners. The survey instrument was
pre-tested by a group of 17 general practitioners (GPs) and community nurses.
The survey contained open and closed questions, to collect demographic data about the participants
and the services they work in, then qualitative and quantitative data about specific aspects of
community palliative and end-of-life care provision during COVID-19, including changes in services,
challenges and exemplars of good practice.
Patient and public involvement

Patient and public involvement (PPI) was a key component of this research, with a PPI co-applicant,
joining the research team, and further PPI sought through the University of Sheffield Palliative Care
Studies Advisory Group (PCSAG). Both our local PPI work and a national consultation exercise (12)
highlighted the importance of the provision of end-of-life care in the community during COVID-19.
Group members provided comments on the literature review and assisted in the development of the
research questions, survey instrument and overall design of this research.
Data collection

The survey was circulated via social media and UK professional networks locally and nationally,
including the Royal College of General Practitioners, the Society for Academic Primary Care, the
Royal College of Nursing, the Queen’s Nursing Institute and the National District Nursing Network
and via social media. Responses from GPs or community nurses were included, responses from other
healthcare professionals were excluded. The aim was for a sample size of 500, having previously
achieved sample sizes in this region (13). Data was collected between 1st September and 16th
October 2020. All responses were anonymous.
Data analysis

Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics using SPSS (version 26). Qualitative
responses were anonymised, uploaded into NVivo 12 software (version 10), and analysed using an
inductive, iterative thematic approach (14). For the purposes of this paper, the qualitative findings
relating to personal reflections about the provision of end-of-life care during the initial wave of the
COVID-19 pandemic are reported. Codes were assigned to each data item, then all codes collated,
mapped out, and compared to extrapolate overarching themes. The data analysis was led by SM, CR
and PO with regular discussion of the emerging findings in order to reduce lone researcher bias (15).

In total, 563 responses were received; healthcare professionals out with our target group were
excluded, leaving 559 valid responses. Of these, there were 387 community nurses, 156 GPs and 16
who did not specify their role. The latter group was included in summary descriptive statistics but
omitted from any group comparisons or qualitative analysis. (Table 1). Respondents represented all
countries within the UK with over three-quarters (77.1%) working in England. Different types of
rurality were represented with the largest proportion from a ‘mixed urban and rural’ area (222,
39.9%). Results are presented in this section as three inter-related themes.
[Table 1]
Theme 1: Increased need, complexity and unpredictability in community end-of-life care during

COVID-19

Respondents reported increased involvement in the provision of end-of-life care in the community
as a consequence of the pandemic, with over half providing end-of-life care ‘a lot more’ or ‘a bit
more than usual’ (322, 58.2%) to patients who were not known or suspected to have COVID-19. Over
half of respondents (296, 53.1%) reported caring for patients who had died with ‘confirmed’ COVID19, and over two-thirds (371, 67.1%) reported caring for those who had died with ‘suspected’
COVID-19 (Table 1).
Working hours changed in response to the need, with these changes often arranged informally, and
frequently unpaid.

‘‘Informal changes to work patterns, working well over shift times due to symptom

management and workload also factoring in staff shortages due to COVID-19 and shielding”

(Respondent 214, Community Staff Nurse, Northern Ireland)’

An important factor was patients choosing to remain at home to receive end-of-life care rather than
being admitted to hospital. This presented workload challenges, but was recognised as a long-term
aspiration for patient care, achieved because of the pandemic:
“I feel more patients stayed at home for non-COVID related end-of-life care. Which was good.

Think the staff that were at the front line went above and beyond to keep patients at home.

Patients and families did not want admission as then they could not see family etc. and then

die without family there. Staying at home was seen as best option for most patients and

families, even if it was tiring”. (Respondent 55, District Nurse, England)

Nurses highlighted an associated increase in the management of patients with more complex
healthcare needs, not related to COVID-19:
“We have had more complex patients being managed at home which has been a challenge,

whereas if COVID-19 and visiting wasn't an issue they may have been hospice inpatients or

even admitted to an acute hospital bed”. (Respondent 299, Sessional GP, England)

Increased patient care needs resulting from the pandemic included an increase in frailty amongst
those living with advanced illness who were shielding at home:
“Patients within the community have shielded well but we are seeing declining health

conditions due to shielding … more frailty has been identified during COVID-19 as patients

have lost their daily routines & independence. Lack of exercise and carrying out their normal

activities of daily living has resulted in more frailty”. (Respondent 483, District Nurse Team

Leader, England)

The care of patients with COVID-19, as a new condition (or suspected COVID-19 when testing was
not available), was associated with a high level of unpredictability and clinical uncertainty, and a
variety of presentations of dying. Only four respondents reported patients dying with distressing
symptoms due to COVID-19, such as agitation, breathlessness and abdominal pain. There were over
100 accounts of experiences of providing care for a large number of patients who deteriorated and
died very rapidly, particularly frail elderly patients, including those in care homes:
“Before testing of clients I found that community and care home clients would be walking

and healthy, then suddenly develop a temperature over 38 degrees [centigrade] and take to

their bed, they would be lethargic and confused, not eat or drink and within approx 72 hours

or so would have died.’’

(Respondent

142, Community Staff Nurse, England)

Theme 2: The roles of the primary care multi-disciplinary team to meet increased demand in the

context of COVID-19

There were rapid changes in the roles of members of the community multi-disciplinary team (MDT)
to meet the increased need for end-of-life care, with respondents reporting that they were
undertaking more advance care planning (48.3%), anticipatory prescribing of medication (42.4%),
symptom management (50.0%), bereavement support (43.1%) and death verification (41.2%) (Figure
1). Additionally, 339 (60.9%) reported that they were providing support to family and carers ‘a lot’ or
‘a bit more than usual’. There was variation in team-working activities with specialist palliative care

teams, with 218 (39.5%) respondents reporting increased collaborative activities whereas 73 (13.2%)
reported less.
[Figure 1]
Comparing GPs and community nurses’ responses showed differences in their professional roles for
palliative care activities (Table 2). GPs undertook ‘more’ or ‘a lot more’ advance care planning
compared with the community nurses (p<0.0001), while community nurses reported providing
‘more’ or ‘a lot more’ symptom management (p<0.0001), bereavement support (p<0.0001), death
verification (p<0.0001), palliative care for those without COVID-19 (p<0.0001) and collaborative
working with specialist palliative care teams (p<0.0001). Although both groups indicated they had
given more support for family and carers, a significantly larger proportion of community nurses
answered ‘more’ or ‘a lot more’ compared with GPs (66.0% versus 48.1%, p=0.01).
[Table 2]
Both GPs and community nurses reported an increase in consultations (telephone and virtual
consultations and home visits) related to end-of-life care, but there were changes in the types of
consultations undertaken (Figure 2). The greatest increase was in virtual consultations, with 308
(64.6%) undertaking ‘more’ or ‘a lot more’ of this type of interaction. There was a contrast between
the two groups, with over three-quarters (77.0%) of community nurses reporting ‘more’ or ‘a lot
more’ face-to-face visits, whereas almost 40% of GPs reported they were doing ‘less’ or ‘a lot less’
(p<0.0001).
[Figure 2]
[Table 3]

Both GPs and community nurses, described concerns about remote consultations in end-of-life care.
There were descriptions of a loss of “professional intimacy” (respondent 37, GP partner, England),
and frustrations amongst professionals about the limitations of telephone or virtual contacts with
patients:
“I have also found it frustrating to be giving support by telephone when I would usually be

visiting a patient to assess their needs. I am quite sure that some patients have deliberately

played down their health issues because they felt that the nurses were too busy already and

didn't want to be a burden”.

78, Community Staff Nurse, Scotland)

It was felt that telephone and virtual consultations were a cause of confusion and distress for
patients, and caused “huge emotional trauma to families” (Participant 441, District Nurse, Northern
Ireland)

“The virtual contact was confusing for some patients and almost became something just to

tick the box that you had 'seen' them in case they passed away”. (Respondent 498, GP

Partner, England)

A frequent response from community nursing staff was that while their visits to patients had
increased, other services, both general practice and specialist palliative care services, had “stepped
” leaving them feeling abandoned, vulnerable and “more disposable” than other

back completely

colleagues:
“GPs and other community services have backed away leaving us to deal with a lot of difficult

situations and questions from families. I feel the end of life care given by GPs has been

dangerous and neglectful and has not been seamless and high quality”.

(Respondent

129,

District Nurse, England)

GP respondents shared this concern. Some GPs reported continuing to provide regular home visits
for end-of-life care, but others described feeling under pressure to decrease their home visits due to
infection control procedures, resulting in them not being able to “give the support [to patients,
families and nursing colleagues] I would normally wish to” (Respondent 475, Sessional GP, England).

The need for clinical leadership within the team providing end-of-life care in the community, while
not unique to GPs, was compromised by service changes:
“we were encouraged as GPs not to visit care homes if possible, however our clinical

leadership role within the care home setting was missed and when we got back in there it

helped to get back to our usual multi-disciplinary team working … The idea that you can

replace that sort of team with technology at a time of great stress was proved wrong”.

Respondent 135, GP partner, Scotland.

Views of support from specialist palliative care services were mixed, with some participants
describing a positive opportunity to work more closely with these services in the community. Some
experienced support through online communities of practice set up by their local hospice. However,
others described difficulties communicating and co-ordinating care with specialist palliative care
colleagues, describing them as “distant” and again reinforcing the reliance on community nursing
staff:

“District Nurses have borne the bulk during COVID. They are, and continue to be, amazing.

The ‘specialist’ palliative care nurses occasionally raise their heads, but are distant and

remote from general practice which is a shame” (Respondent 67, Deputy District Nurse Team

Leader, England)

Theme 3: Fears, repeated loss and undervaluation of contributions threatens resilience and wellbeing
of community healthcare teams

Changes in the delivery of care, team dynamics and roles, and increased involvement in end-of-life
care had consequences for the emotional wellbeing of respondents. Some described teams “pulling
together to get on with it”

and becoming “a stronger, more bonded” team. Others described their

experiences as “emotionally and physically draining”. Witnessing high volumes of people dying, and
managing anxiety around infection control, were significant factors:

“[Nursing] staff felt accused of bringing the virus into the home, there was some public

shaming as well as public support, the issue of [personal protective equipment] clouded

everything (was there enough, was it being used correctly, who was responsible?) … Deaths

were more rapid than flu. Many staff got the virus but thankfully no one seriously … Staff

have been left broken and there are symptoms of [post traumatic stress disorder], depression

and anxiety” Respondent 148, GP partner, Scotland

Respondents described the impact of staff shortages within the team as a result of colleagues
becoming unwell with COVID-19, or having to self-isolate. Some had experienced the death of a
colleague from COVID-19. Others expressed fears for their own safety particularly if they had health
concerns of their own:
“I have been frightened coming to work for the last 5 months as I [have risk factors] so a

prime candidate for COVID 19. But am proud to say I have not shirked my responsibility and

have done my duty. It has been very difficult especially when rushing to someone poorly's

house and having to doff and don [

personal protective equipment] before seeing the patient.

(Respondent 149, District Nurse, England)

Support from colleagues, including nursing team leaders was highly valued although formal
psychological support was lacking. Many respondents described feeling that, as community and
primary care staff, their contributions to patient care during COVID-19 did not receive the same
attention as hospital care during COVID-19 due to a “concerning focus on critical care capacity in
10

hospital” (Respondent 1, Sessional GP, England)

. This had a negative impact and contributed to a

perception that they were undervalued:
“….the general public seemed to think COVID-19 only existed in hospitals and not in people’s

homes. Care homes were forgot about and they seemed to have little or no guidance in

relation to infection prevention‘’ (Respondent 200, District Nurse, England)

Discussion

Summary of main findings

During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, community nurses and GPs experienced a
substantial increase in the need and complexity for palliative and end-of-life care. Specific palliative
care activities increased, with community nurses taking greater responsibility in most areas of care
including symptom control and the provision of support to family members. GPs reported an
increase in advance care planning. Working hours changed to meet rising demands for care at home
through a mainly 'ad hoc' approach.
Changes in the mode of service delivery, including increased virtual consultations, resulted in reports
of disconnection within and between teams. Community nursing team members particularly
described a sense of abandonment and perceived that other services, including general practice and
specialist palliative care, had withdrawn. GPs reported feeling that the use of virtual consultations
was limited in the end-of-life care context. A significant emotional toll was experienced due to the
impact of providing care during COVID-19 with fears relating to uncertainty and loss of the usual
mechanisms of interdisciplinary and collegial support.
Strengths and limitations

This is the first UK-wide survey undertaken to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
healthcare services involved in the provision of community-based end-of-life care. It provides
valuable insights into the role of primary healthcare and the findings are highly relevant to practice,
service delivery models and policymaking as the pandemic progresses.
The minimum number of returns was achieved, but the response rate was low amongst GPs even
though the survey was distributed through well-respected professional organisations. This may be
due to the timing of the survey, when workload related to the pandemic was high and that there
were a large number of other surveys taking place concurrently. The findings are likely to reflect the
views of primary care professionals with an active role or interest in palliative care and may not be
representative of the wider population of GPs and community nurses.

Comparison with existing literature

There is a lack of previous research to inform practice, service delivery or policy (9, 16) despite the
importance of the provision of high quality end-of-life care in a pandemic (17, 18). Respondents in
this study perceive that their role in the pandemic response has received less focus than the
response of hospital care (19, 20). Primary healthcare teams have a pivotal role in end-of-life care,
and feeling undervalued may have contributed to the significant emotional distress experienced
during COVID-19.
The increased need for palliative and end-of-life care in the community is in keeping with research
from previous pandemics and is borne out in COVID-19 population data (1, 21). The increase in
deaths in the community has placed extra time and resource pressures on both GPs and community
nurses, often met through the efforts of highly committed individual healthcare professionals (19).
Much of the increase in care was for patients dying of conditions other than COVID-19 as a result of
patient choice to stay at home, particularly with visiting restrictions in hospitals (22). The resulting
increase in delivery of end-of-life care and management of complexity in the community contrasts
with fears at the start of the pandemic that end-of-life care would be required for a large number of
people dying with COVID-19, with such significant pressure on hospital beds, including critical care,
that admission would have to be avoided.
Community nurses have previously described end-of-life care as one of the most rewarding aspects
of their job (23). This research provides insights into the new responsibilities rapidly assumed by
community nurses in almost every aspect of end-of-life care during COVID-19. The context for the
delivery of end-of-life care in the community changed drastically with national lockdowns, selfisolation and shielding resulting in patients at home alone in the community, unable to access their
usual social support. Community nurses represent one of the few professional groups that people at
the end-of-life had face-to-face contact with during the pandemic. The level of skill, compassion and
resilience required to undertake this task must be recognised and valued (24).
Previous research has exposed tensions in relationships both within primary healthcare teams and
between these teams and specialist palliative care colleagues (25). Increased use of virtual
consultations by GPs and specialist palliative care teams during COVID-19 appeared to exacerbate
such conflicts, with community nurses describing a feeling of abandonment and isolation. The
interpretation of policies recommending that home visits by GPs should be limited as far as possible
(26) may have contributed to this situation. GP respondents in this survey and elsewhere have
specifically highlighted the importance of face-to-face home visits as an ongoing priority for care of
12

vulnerable patients in the community, including those who are dying (27, 28), and described a sense
of moral distress related to the change in their role associated with increased use of remote
consultation. The role of GPs working alongside community nurses in the provision of end-of-life
care not only involves specific clinical tasks, but also reviewing, affirming and supporting care
decisions within the multi-disciplinary team. This is particularly relevant in the context of COVID-19
as a new condition, where clinicians must take responsibility for complex and nuanced clinical
decision-making, and collectively manage a great deal of clinical risk and uncertainty (29).
Previous research has demonstrated the profound emotional impact that providing care for the
dying during a pandemic can have on staff, and recommended access to training, support and
debriefing as part of a pandemic response (30). This remains relevant and it is important to
recognise.
Implications for practice, policy and research,

This survey provides valuable insights into experiences of professionals during the first wave of the
pandemic, highlighting the many changes that occurred and the impact on both services and
individuals. Future research should include more in-depth investigation into specific aspects of endof-life care such as advance care planning and end-of-life care in care homes. There is much more to
learn about the impact and role of remote consultations in end-of-life care if this practice is to
continue. Further analysis of qualitative responses yielded in this survey is planned. Research to
understand the perspective of patients and families currently experiencing palliative and end-of-life
care would be valuable. This further research is required in the context of a constantly evolving
pandemic situation and changing knowledge of the management of COVID-19 which has a direct
impact on care decisions such as whether or not a patient would benefit from admission to hospital.
There is an immediate need for policy makers and commissioners to recognise the sustained
increased need for end-of-life care in the community and the critical role of primary healthcare
services in the delivery of this care as the pandemic progresses. Policy guidance and service models
must place focus on and support the multi-disciplinary team relationships that are necessary to
deliver this care most effectively, rather than the roles of specific services as this has the potential to
fragment teams. Ensuring support for individuals involved in the provision of this care, through team
relationships, training opportunities and debrief also requires attention. The findings of the survey
suggest a disconnect between teams involved in end-of-life care in the community and a need to
rebuild trusted relationships through truly integrated approaches between GPs, community nurses
and specialist palliative care services.

Conclusion

This study has identified the contrasting and potentially conflicting roles that emerged between GPs
and community nurses in their responses to the increased demand and complexity of palliative and
end-of-life care in the community in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The significant
emotional impact, especially for community nurses, needs to be addressed alongside promoting
effective, collaborative and mutually supportive team working that can recognise and quickly adapt
to changing patient needs.
