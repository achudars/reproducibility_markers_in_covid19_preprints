ABSTRACT
Introduction: To mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent overwhelming the healthcare
system, social-distancing policies such as school closure, stay-at-home orders, and indoor dining
closure have been utilized worldwide. These policies function by reducing the rate of close
contact within populations and results in decreased human mobility. Adherence to social
distancing can substantially reduce disease spread. Thus, quantifying human mobility and socialdistancing compliance, especially at high temporal resolution, can provide great insight into the
impact of social distancing policies.
Methods: We used the movement of individuals around New York City (NYC), measured via
traffic levels, as a proxy for human mobility and the impact of social-distancing policies (i.e.,
work from home policies, school closure, indoor dining closure etc.). By data mining Google
traffic in real-time, and applying image processing, we derived high resolution time series of
traffic in NYC. We used time series decomposition and generalized additive models to quantify
changes in rush hour/non-rush hour, and weekday/weekend traffic, pre-pandemic and following
the roll-out of multiple social distancing interventions.
Results: Mobility decreased sharply on March 14, 2020 following declaration of the pandemic.
However, levels began rebounding by approximately April 13, almost 2 months before stay-athome orders were lifted, indicating premature increase in mobility, which we term socialdistancing fatigue. We also observed large impacts on diurnal traffic congestion, such that the
pre-pandemic bi-modal weekday congestion representing morning and evening rush hour was
dramatically altered. By September, traffic congestion rebounded to approximately 75% of prepandemic levels.
Conclusion: Using crowd-sourced traffic congestion data, we described changes in mobility in
Manhattan, NYC, during the COVID-19 pandemic. These data can be used to inform human
mobility changes during the current pandemic, in planning for responses to future pandemics,
and in understanding the potential impact of large-scale traffic interventions such as congestion
pricing policies.

1. INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic threatens almost every single country on Earth.1,2 To curb the
pandemic and prevent overwhelming the healthcare system with COVID-19 cases, socialdistancing policies such as school closures, non-essential business closures, curfews, and stay-athome orders have been put into place. Social-distancing policies, specifically quarantines, are
some of the oldest and most utilized strategies for epidemic control.3 Social distancing policies
function by reducing physical contact and decreasing human mobility; adherence can
substantially reduce transmission4 and case counts.5 Thus, quantifying human mobility and
social-distancing compliance, especially at high temporal and spatial resolution, is critical for
controlling the epidemic.
Several measures of social-distancing compliance have been used previously in the literature.
Studies evaluating individual-level adherence to social-distancing policies frequently use selfreport through online surveys.6-8 While these methods are very useful for evaluating
determinants of adherence, they are not as useful for real-time epidemic monitoring because they
are time- and labor-intensive and only capture a snapshot of the population‚Äôs behavior in a small
sample at a single timepoint. In contrast, highly resolved data such as mobile phone call records
or locations can be used to measure social-distancing9 and to inform mobility components of
infectious disease transmission models.10 These measures, especially if publicly available, can
contribute to epidemic monitoring. One such option is vehicular traffic condition smartphone
apps, which base their maps on cellphone movement data. Traffic congestion maps are publicly
available, updated in real-time, and can be used for public health research. For example, we have
previously shown that colors in Google traffic maps correspond to relative vehicle speed, and
used this information to infer traffic-related air pollution.11
App-based traffic information offers a pathway for assessing social-distancing, as increased
traffic congestion is indicative of spending time outside the home that may result in opportunities
for human interaction and contact. In fact, traffic data has been used to evaluate mobility during
the pandemic in South Korea, finding that in some cities increases in traffic were correlated with
increases in cases, but that in others traffic and cases were negatively correlated.12 Here we
analyzed time series of traffic congestion that we derived from app-based maps. We quantify
changes in traffic in the Manhattan borough of New York City (NYC) during the COVID-19
pandemic (January 1 to December 31, 2020). Our objective was to describe how social
distancing interventions impacted population-level patterns of mobility throughout various stages
of the pandemic.
2. METHODS
From January 1 through December 31, 2020, we obtained 12 tiles from Google traffic maps to
view Manhattan‚Äôs entire street network every three hours in real-time. We used image processing
methods, as described previously in Hilpert et al.,11 to identify the color-coded road segments.
Color codes indicated four traffic categories: (i) green for free-flowing traffic, (ii) orange for
medium traffic, (iii) red for traffic congestion, and (iv) maroon for severe traffic congestion. The

colors are proxies for vehicle speed.11,13 In summary,11 map pixels for each of the four colors
were counted and time series generated of the percent of the map area covered by each color.
To investigate changes in traffic congestion during the pandemic, we first characterized all four
time series, but then restricted further analysis to the time series of red traffic congestion given
its clear pandemic-related signal (e.g., decrease in April) and simpler interpretability (increases
in red coverage indicate increases in congestion). We did this to avoid redundancy in analysis
since all color coverage time series showed correlated temporal patterns. There were substantial
changes in traffic congestion over the course of the pandemic and we captured this variation by
partitioning the time series into four distinct time periods, which we refer to as COVID periods.
We individually fit a generalized additive model (GAM)14 to each COVID period.
GAM models were constructed to predict the time series of percentage of total map area covered
by traffic congestion, (ùëá! ) using two discrete predictor variables: hour of day, ‚Ñé! , which can
assume values 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21; and the binary variable ùë§! indicating whether a
traffic map describes traffic on weekdays (ùë§",! ) or during weekends (ùë§$,! ). We fitted the
following model to the measured ùëá! , ùë§",! , ùë§$,! and ‚Ñé! data:
ùëá! = ùëé% + ùë§",! ùë†" (‚Ñé! ) + ùë§$,! ùë†$ (‚Ñé! ) + ‚àà!

(1)

where ùëé% is the intercept (representing mean color coverage), and ùë†" and ùë†$ are cyclic cubic
regression splines with 8 degrees of freedom and zero mean. Degrees of freedom were selected
using the generalized cross-validation criterion. The fitted models were then used to predict
congestion levels hourly for a weekend and weekday, with 95% confidence intervals. Due to the
morning and evening rush hour, traffic congestion displayed a 24-hour periodicity. The range of
the diurnal fluctuation was measured as the deviation from the intercept.
To investigate potential social distancing fatigue (increased mobility before relaxation of stay-athome policies), we applied seasonal decomposition of time series by Loess (STL)15 to the data
from March 14 to June 16, a period including the NY on PAUSE policy intervention and the first
stage of New York‚Äôs reopening (Phase 1). This analysis decomposed the time series into a
periodic component, time trend, and the remainder (or residual). Prior to running the analysis,
missing observations (n = 54) were imputed using predictions from the GAM models.
All analyses were conducted in R version 3.5.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
Austria). Simon Wood‚Äôs mgcv package was used to fit GAMs.16 STL analysis was completed
using the `stl` function in the stats package.
3. RESULTS
We found abrupt decreases in traffic congestion in Manhattan following school closures and the
implementation of stay-at-home orders (NY on PAUSE). For a list of policies implemented by
New York State and NYC in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, please see Supplemental
Table 1. A map of the study area is shown in Figure 1, with colors representing the crowdsourced traffic data. There was a dramatic decrease in traffic congestion after the implementation

of social distancing policies. Stark differences in the proportion of green free-flowing traffic are
readily apparent on the ring roads that trace the edges of Manhattan Island, as well as the main
entry points, including the George Washington Bridge in the north and all tunnels and bridges in
the south.
Time series of the four congestion colors (Figure 2) reveal abrupt decreases in traffic congestion
after March 14, the weekend before New York public school closure, with simultaneous
increases in free-flowing traffic occurring. Importantly, we observed a steady increase in traffic
congestion before New York on PAUSE ended on June 7th. This increase was most apparent in
the red traffic congestion series, where traffic congestion appears to begin increasing on
approximately May 1 and continues increasing up until about July 1. These increases occur
before the end of stay-at-home orders and are indicative of social-distancing fatigue.
We identified four COVID Periods where traffic congestion changed markedly and fit each with
a GAM model (Equation 1). The Pre-COVID Period was defined as the start of the time series
(January 1) through March 13, before congestion began to decrease dramatically. COVID Period
1 was defined as March 14 through May 19. Around May 19th traffic congestion started to
increase to the point that the model began poorly fitting the data; therefore, we defined COVID
Period 2, which was May 20 through June 16, during which traffic congestion continued
increasing. COVID Period 3 was June 17 through the end of the time series (December 31),
where a more stable traffic pattern emerged.

Vertical black lines delineate COVID time periods for the four separate GAM models, labeled below the bottom xaxis. The timeline of COVID response policies implemented by New York State are outlined at the top of the figure.

Morning and evening rush hour impose a periodic cycle to traffic patterns, seen as daily peaks
and troughs in traffic (Figure 2). The pandemic not only caused changes in traffic trends, but
also drove changes in the period cycle. In addition to the daily periodicity, there was also a
weekly cycle where congestion was elevated during the five consecutive weekdays and was
dampened during the two consecutive weekend days. The weekly cycle was most apparent in the
Pre-COVID period and in the most recent period, COVID Period 3.
Mean percent area with red traffic congestion changed dramatically throughout the time period
(Table 1). Percent area with mean red traffic congestion (equivalent to the model intercept) was
highest during the pre-COVID time period, and then decreased abruptly during COVID Period 1
(from a mean of 0.99% to 0.41%) before steadily increasing for COVID Periods 2 and 3. By
COVID Period 3, the mean red traffic congestion area had rebounded to about 75% of the prepandemic average.

The rebound in red congestion coverage began far in advance of the implementation of Phase 1
reopening (Figure 3, second panel). In STL analysis of COVID Periods 1 and 2, congestion
appears to increase from approximately April 13th onward, while Phase 1 reopening did not
begin until June 8 (right dashed line).

In addition to these changes in traffic trends, the pandemic substantially altered daily traffic
periodicity, such that during the height of the pandemic in NYC in the Spring, there was little
differentiation between weekday and weekend traffic patterns (Figure 4, tan lines). During the
Pre-COVID period (grey lines) rush hour peaks were highest, with weekdays demonstrating a

clear bimodal distribution with peaks around 9am and 5pm, and weekends a clear unimodal peak
around 5pm. However, during COVID Period 1, both weekday and weekend traffic peaks were
greatly dampened, and the bimodal weekday distribution shifted to nearly unimodal, becoming
very similar to the weekend distribution. During COVID Period 2 and 3 the daily traffic peaks
were greater than for Period 1, but still lower than pre-pandemic levels. Even as overall traffic
increased during these periods, the weekday distribution remained altered, such that the morning
peak was much smaller than the evening peak.

Figure 4. Diurnal fluctuation of red color coverage (in % area) on the traffic congestion maps for a typical weekday
and weekend day (points and solid lines). Typical congestion levels are predicted from the GAM models with 95%
confidence intervals (gray shading surrounding by dashed lines), for each COVID time period. Pre-COVID is from
January 1 to March 13, COVID Period 1 is March 14 to May 19, COVID Period 2 is May 20 to June 16, and
COVID Period 3 is June 17 to December 31.

A closer inspection of the GAM splines (Supplemental Figure 1), including the deviation of the
fitted spline from the intercept, further highlight these differences in diurnal traffic congestion. In
Panel C of Supplemental Figure 1, we can see that while the heights of the morning rush hour
peak for weekdays remains highest for the Pre-COVID period, for COVID Period 3, the evening
rush hour actually has a greater peak than the Pre-COVID period. This shift in traffic from the
morning to the evening rush hour results in a diurnal congestion pattern that appears somewhere
between the Pre-COVID weekday and weekend distributions.

4. DISCUSSION
We present evidence of social-distancing fatigue in Manhattan, NYC, from evaluation of traffic
congestion levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. While traffic decreased sharply following the
onset of the pandemic and implementation of response policies, levels were already rebounding
almost two months before stay-at-home orders (NY on PAUSE) were lifted on June 8. Overall,
we identified four COVID periods based on traffic congestion patterns. While the dates
delineating the COVID period sometimes lined up with the implementation of official social
distancing policies, they did not always. For example, traffic congestion began to plummet on
March 14, but school closures were not implemented until March 16. NYC bars and restaurants
closed in-person service on March 17, and NY on PAUSE began on March 22. The time period
during which NY on PAUSE was in effect spans two different COVID Periods because traffic
began to rebound far in advance of the first reopening policy (Phase 1 reopening) which occurred
on June 8th. COVID Period 3, when traffic began to stabilize (June 17th), was very close to the
Phase 2 re-opening date of June 22 (Figure 2). We also observe large impacts of the pandemic on
the distribution of traffic throughout the day, such that the pre-pandemic bi-modal weekday
diurnal congestion representing the morning and evening rush hour was dramatically depressed.
By September, traffic congestion had rebounded to approximately 75% of pre-pandemic levels.
Dramatic decreases in traffic have been noted in NYC17 and many other places18-21 in response to
the pandemic, including Padova, Italy18 and Auckland, New Zealand.19 The study in Padova
found a decrease in traffic flow (vehicle counts per unit time) in 2020 of approximately 70%,
compared to 2018-2017.18 Similarly, the study in Auckland found a 60-80% decrease in traffic
flow following travel restrictions implemented in response to the pandemic.19 Another analysis
of traffic changes in the NYC metro area found reductions of 66% in passenger vehicle traffic
the week of March 28-April 3.17 While the traffic flows reported by these other studies cannot be
directly compared to our metrics, our findings were in line with those previously published. We
found a 59% reduction in total map area covered by traffic congestion during March 14-May 19,
compared to January 1-March 13, and we were able to extent our analysis through the end of
2020.
In this paper, we use changes in traffic as a measure of human mobility and an indicator for
social-distancing interventions. However, an increase in traffic congestion does not necessarily
correlate with increased case counts of COVID-19, as a study evaluating correlations between
traffic and cases in various cities of South Korea found.12 Broadly, we can conceptualize
COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions in four categories: face mask mandates, isolation
or quarantine (including stay-at-home orders), traffic or travel restrictions (such as limiting travel
between cities or counties), and social-distancing (closure of schools or other businesses, or
limiting gatherings).22 A review found that social-distancing was the most effective single nonpharmaceutical intervention, while combining social-distancing with at least one other
intervention was even more effective.22 Traffic congestion can be thought of as an indicator for
three of these intervention groupings (all but mask mandates), as human mobility is a component
of isolation or quarantine, traffic or travel restrictions, and social-distancing. As such, it makes
sense to hypothesize that increased congestion may correlate with increased opportunity for
SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, increases in traffic congestion may also be an indicator of

a switch in transportation methods in response to the pandemic; studies have documented
dramatic decreases in use of public transportation in NYC23 and metro areas in Sweden.24 It is
possible that individuals who otherwise would have used public transit such as subways or buses
are now relying more heavily on private or shared vehicles to reduce their chance of exposure, as
was found in Canada.25
Understanding changes in traffic congestion during the pandemic is useful not only as a proxy
for human mobility, but also for implications on large-scale traffic interventions that may be
implemented in the future. For example, in 2019 New York City became the first American city
to approve a congestion pricing policy,26 with implementation scheduled to begin in early 2021
(although this was delayed). The large-scale traffic disruption that followed implementation of
NY on PAUSE, however, may be useful in informing what kinds of changes in traffic patterns
could reduce congestion. As we saw in COVID period 1, traffic congestion can be reduced both
by depression of overall traffic and by dampening the bimodal diurnal congestion driven by
weekday rush hour.
In this paper, use of STL analysis allowed for clear identification of the increasing trend in traffic
congestion, while use of GAM models allowed us to account for the changing within-day
distribution of the congestion data over the course of the pandemic. These methods allowed us to
identify the presence of social-distancing fatigue and to describe traffic changes by hour,
demonstrating a clearer picture of the impact of the pandemic on traffic in NYC. This
information is useful not only as a proxy for tracking human mobility, but also for understanding
how large-scale travel restrictions can impact traffic patterns and congestion overall.
Out study has some notable limitations. First, we include a fairly limited geographic area (the
borough of Manhattan, NYC), and thus results of our study may not be generalizable to other
areas. However, studies in other cities also find dramatic decreases in traffic, on a similar scale
as that reported here.18,19,21 Second, our data source does not allow for disaggregation of
passenger vehicles and trucks, which were likely differentially impacted by responses to the
pandemic (as trucking operations may be considered essential businesses). Studies in NYC27 and
Somerville MA20 have found decreases in both vehicles and trucks, though the decrease was
substantially less for trucks. Third, we do not disaggregate traffic changes by neighborhoods, and
thus do not report variation in congestion changes within Manhattan. We recommend that future
studies describe and evaluate these potential differences.
5. CONCLUSIONS
Using highly temporally resolved, crowd-sourced traffic congestion data, we describe changes in
traffic congestion in Manhattan, NYC, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We report dramatic
declines in traffic congestion during the initial stages of the pandemic and implementation of
stay-at-home orders, followed by rebounds in congestion nearly two months before stay-at-home
orders were reversed, evidence of social-distancing fatigue. Additionally, we describe changes in
diurnal traffic congestion patterns for weekdays and weekends, by hour, for four time periods
during the pandemic. This data can be used to inform human mobility changes during the current
