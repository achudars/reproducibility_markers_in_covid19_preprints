Abstract

29

Background: The recently launched high-throughput assays for the detection of antibodies

30

against SARS-CoV-2 may change the managing strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic. This

31

study aimed at investigating the performance of three high-throughput assays and one rapid

32

lateral flow test relative to the recommended criteria defined by regulatory authorities.

33

Methods: A total of 133 samples, including 100 pre-pandemic samples, 20 samples from

34

SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive individuals, and 13 potentially cross-reactive samples were

35

analysed with SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Abbott), Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Roche), LIAISON

36

SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG (DiaSorin) and 2019-nCOV IgG/IgM Rapid Test (Dynamiker

37

Biotechnology Co).

38

Results: All assays performed with a high level of specificity; however, only Abbott reached

39

100% (95% CI 96.3-100). The pre-pandemic samples analysed with Roche, DiaSorin and

40

Dynamiker Biotechnology resulted in two to three false-positive results per method

41

(specificity 96.9-98.0%). Sensitivity differed more between the assays, Roche exhibiting the

42

highest sensitivity (100%, CI 83.9-100). The corresponding figures for Abbott, DiaSorin and

43

Dynamiker Biotechnology were 85.0%, 77.8% and 75.0%, respectively.

44

Conclusions: The results of the evaluated SARS-CoV-2 assays vary considerably as well as

45

their ability to fulfil the performance criteria proposed by regulatory authorities. Introduction

46

into clinical use in low-prevalent settings, should therefore, be made with caution.

Introduction

51

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China,

52

in December 2019 [1]. The virus causing this disease has since been designated SARS-CoV-2

53

[2]. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 range from mild or no respiratory symptoms to

54

severe viral pneumonia with a need of intensive care and ventilator support. Due to the rapid

55

dissemination of the infection, the outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health

56

Organization (WHO) on 11th March 2020 [3].
RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 in samples primarily obtained from

57
58

nasopharyngeal and/or pharyngeal swabs is considered gold standard for laboratory

59

confirmation of COVID-19 in patients. However, the presence of viral nucleic acids is

60

transient, and results are dependent on the time of sampling.
Detection of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus could possibly be used to

61
62

distinguish patients recovered from COVID-19, and several rapid tests based on

63

immunochromatographic techniques have been developed. These point-of-care tests usually

64

deliver results within 15-30 minutes, however the nature of the tests makes large-scale testing

65

inefficient.

66

To achieve high-throughput detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in plasma

67

or serum, several manufacturers have developed immunoassays based on recognition of

68

recombinant antigens. Some tests claim to detect IgM or IgG, while others also identify IgA

69

or a mixture of different classes of antibodies. Differences in test design, including choice of

70

antigen, are likely to affect the sensitivity and specificity of the tests [4]. In this study, the

71

performance of three commercially available high-throughput automated SARS-CoV-2

72

antibody assays, and one rapid immunochromatographic test, was investigated and compared

73

to recommended criteria set by regulatory authorities.

Materials and Methods

76

Assays

77

Four commercially available CE marked immunoassays, and their corresponding platforms

78

were used: 1) Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG on the ARCHITECT i2000 (Abbott, Illinois, USA);

79

2) Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 on the Cobas 8000 e801 (Roche Diagnostic Scandinavia AB,

80

Solna, Sweden); 3) LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG on the LIAISON XL (DiaSorin,

81

Saluggia, Italy); and 4) the lateral flow test 2019-nCOV IgG/IgM Rapid Test (Dynamiker

82

Biotechnology Co., Tianjin, China).

83

The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG reagent is based on the recognition of IgG

84

antibodies binding to recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein in a chemiluminescent

85

microparticle immunoassay (CMIA). Results are obtained after 29 minutes, and are reported

86

as an index with a cut-off to distinguish between negative and positive results.

87

The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay is based on recombinantly produced

88

SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein and detects antibodies (including IgG). The duration

89

of the analysis is approximately 18 minutes, with results presented as a cut-off index as well

90

as reactive or non-reactive.

91

The LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 detects IgG antibodies recognising the spike

92

glycoprotein of the coronavirus. As for the previous assays, the antigen is composed of

93

recombinant protein expressed in human cell lines. The analysis takes 35 minutes, and the

94

results are expressed as IgG antibody concentrations in arbitrary units (AU/mL) graded

95

negative, equivocal, or positive.

96

The manually performed 2019-nCOV IgG/IgM Rapid Test recognises and

97

differentiates IgG from IgM antibodies; however, information on antigen source is scarce.

98

The test result could be obtained after approximately 10 minutes as visual bands across the

99

assay paper strip, any positive result, either for IgG, IgM, or both, was considered positive.

100

Despite the short reaction time, as compared with the automatic tests, high-throughput

101

analysis of a large number of samples using the manual test procedure is implausible.

102

All automated systems are part of the routine operations in our laboratories and

103

were as such subjected to accepted quality assurance procedures. All tests (including

104

calibration and controls) were performed according to manufacturers’ instructions, using

105

serum samples.

106
107

Sample collections

108

All samples in the study originated from an existing sample collection at the Microbiology

109

department obtained after consent to deposit, store, and use for research and development.

110

Samples were fully anonymised prior to inclusion, and results could hence not be linked to

111

individuals. As a consequence, the study did not require approval from an ethics committee,

112

according to the guidelines of the Swedish Ethical Review Agency. All serum samples were

113

stored at -20°C until analysis.

114

The specificity of each assay was evaluated using 100 pre-pandemic (2018)

115

samples. To challenge the assays, 13 additional serum samples with possible interferences

116

(antinuclear antibodies (n=2); rheumatoid factor (n=2); anti-cytomegalovirus IgM (n=2); anti-

117

Epstein-Barr virus IgM (n=2) and samples from pregnant donors (n=5)) were analysed.

118

Assay sensitivities were evaluated using 20 outpatient serum samples from 16

119

individuals that prior to serum sampling had tested RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 from

120

nasopharyngeal and/or pharyngeal swabs. RT-PCR had been performed using primers and

121

probes targeting either the envelope (E) and the polymerase (RdRP) genes of SARS-CoV-2 as

122

described by Corman [5], or the nucleocapsid gene (N) of the virus (Abbott RealTime SARS-

123

CoV-2 Assay, Abbott Molecular Inc., Illinois, USA). The interval between onset of COVID-

124

19 symptoms and serum sample collection ranged from 18 to 52 days (median 38 days).

125

Calculations

126

Overall per cent agreement, sensitivity (per cent positive agreement), and specificity (per cent

127

negative agreement) were calculated based on a contingency table according to EP12-A2 [6],

128

using Microsoft Excel 2019 (Microsoft Corp. Redmond, WA, USA). The between-test

129

agreement was evaluated using Cohen’s kappa calculated with IBM SPSS Statistics for

130

Windows, Version 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). For each assay, the positive

131

likelihood ratio (LR+) and positive predictive value (PPV) at different prevalence (P)

132

scenarios were calculated according to equation 1 and 2, respectively.

Clinical Performance Requirements

140

The performance of each assay was compared with published guidelines from three regulatory

141

authorities: the Public Health Agency of Sweden (PHAS); Haute Autorité de Santé, France

142

(HAS); and Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, USA (CDC) [7-9]. Their

143

recommended performance criteria are summarized in Table 1.

144

Results

145

Of the 100 pre-pandemic samples, nine tested false positive, two with Roche, five with

146

DiaSorin (including two equivocal results) and two with Dynamiker Biotechnology (figure 1).

147

The negative sample collection resulted in median values of 0.09 COI (0.08-3.16), 0.04 S/CO

148

(0.01-0.6) and 5.7 AU/mL (1.9-32.6) for Roche, Abbott and DiaSorin, respectively. The panel

149

consisting of 13 potentially cross-reactive pre-pandemic samples mainly gave negative

150

results. However, for Dynamiker Biotechnology, one sample with rheumatoid factor IgM was

151

positive for both SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG. Also, one sample obtained during pregnancy

152

showed an equivocal result on the DiaSorin assay. In contrast, all these samples were negative

153

on the Abbott and Roche assays.

154

Three RT-PCR positive samples gave a weak positive result with Roche, close

155

to the cut-off (1.01 to 1.26, cut-off ≥1.0) (Figure 1). These samples were reported as negative

156

by DiaSorin, Dynamiker Biotechnology, and Abbott. However, for these samples, the Abbott

157

values clearly differed from the rest of the Abbott negative samples by being close to the cut-

158

off (0.81-1.06, cut-off ≥1.4).

159

The overall agreement was 97.5% for Abbott, 98.3% for Roche, 94.0% for

160

DiaSorin, and 94.2% for Dynamiker Biotechnology. The pairwise inter-assay agreement

161

(Cohen’s kappa) was as follows: Roche and Abbott 0.847 (95% CI, 0.718 to 0.976); Roche

162

and Diasorin 0.654 (95% CI, 0.474 to 0.830); Roche and Dynamiker Biotechnology 0.794

163

(95% CI, 0.647 to 0.941); Abbott and DiaSorin 0.777 (95% CI, 0.618 to 0.936); Abbott and

164

Dynamiker Biotechnology 0.804 (95% CI, 0.653 to 0.817); and DiaSorin and Dynamiker

165

Biotechnology 0.724 (95% CI, 0.533 to 0.895).

166

The calculated sensitivity and specificity for each assay is presented in Table 2,

167

together with the corresponding data extracted from each manufacturer’s test kit insert. In the

168

present study Abbott exhibited the highest specificity and Roche the highest sensitivity, both

169

being 100%. Two RT-PCR positive samples and two samples from the negative collection

170

were excluded from the DiaSorin sample collection due to equivocal results. The positive

171

likelihood ratios (LR+) were ∞, 50.0, 25.1 and 37.5 for Abbott, Roche, DiaSorin and

172

Dynamiker Biotechnology, respectively.
Benchmarking the sensitivity and specificity data from the current study against

173
174

published guidelines showed that the Abbott assay met the specificity criteria set by all three

175

regulatory bodies. The specificities of Roche and Dynamiker Biotechnology were both in

176

accordance with the HAS guidelines, while DiaSorin, in contrast, failed to reach any of the

177

specificity criteria. Neither of the assays from Abbott, DiaSorin and Dynamiker

178

Biotechnology exhibited a sufficient sensitivity to meet the criteria set by PHAS and HAS. In

179

contrast, Roche performed excellent in this regard, with a sensitivity of 100%.

180

Assay performance recommendations from PHAS are based on a target PPV of

181

> 90%. To demonstrate the seroprevalence required to reach a PPV of > 90%, the PPV based

182

on sensitivity and specificity data from the present study as well as from the manufacturers,

183

was calculated (Figure 2).

184

Discussion

185

As the pandemic progresses, it will likely become increasingly important not only to establish

186

ongoing COVID-19 but also to confirm past infection of SARS-CoV-2. On a community

187

level, this could be used for assessing the progress of the pandemic and for guiding public

188

health and control policies [10]. On an individual level, a reliable method for proving past

189

COVID-19 could potentially be important for allowing employees to remain at work despite

190

mild respiratory symptoms. It could even serve as a basis for a proposed “immunity passport”

191

[11, 12]. Although the degree of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is disputed, it is plausible that

192

individuals undergoing COVID-19 will gain partial or temporary protection against new

193

episodes [13]. Serology tests might also be used to identify donors of convalescent plasma,

194

which has been proposed for the treatment of seriously ill COVID-19 patients [14].

However, the rapidly emerging pandemic limits the possibility of state-of-the-art

195
196

validations according to the EP-12 A2 [6], and there is no international consensus on clinical

197

performance requirements for COVID-19 assays. Neither is there an agreed gold standard

198

method for antibody testing [15]. Using the performance criteria proposed by PHAS, HAS

199

and CDC [7-9], only Abbott managed to reach the specificity recommended by all three

200

authorities while Roche alone fulfilled the sensitivity criteria (PHAS, HAS).
The clinical performance of a qualitative diagnostic test is, with few exceptions,

201
202

heavily dependent on the prevalence. Both PHAS and CDC accordingly link their respective

203

specificity criteria for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing to seroprevalence levels. PHAS

204

recommends that a PPV > 90% shall be pursued, regardless of seroprevalence. Based on our

205

results prevalences of approximately 15%, 20% and 25% would be necessary to reach this

206

goal for Roche, Dynamiker Biotechnology and DiaSorin, respectively (Figure 2). In contrast,

207

Abbott would in this regard perform well at any given seroprevalence, owing to its specificity

208

of 100%.

209

Due to the limited sample size of the study, our results need to be interpreted

210

with caution. Nevertheless, a recent study based on 65 RT-PCR positive and 1154 pre-

211

COVID-19 samples [16] reported similar assay performances, except for the sensitivity of

212

Roche being higher in our study. In contrast, evaluating four different assays using the same

213

outpatient sample collection strengthens this study. Moreover, an aspect not investigated in

214

this study is that assay performance could potentially vary with sample type (serum, plasma,

215

whole blood).

216

Judging by the results from this study, introducing broad antibody testing for

217

COVID-19 will be cumbersome in a low-prevalence setting. In order to reach the proposed

218

performance criteria, two-tier testing will have to be considered. Alternatively, a high degree

219

of specificity (and thus a high positive predictive value) could be prioritised using modified

220

cut-off values. Our results suggest that this could be conceivable for the Abbott and Roche

221

assays, while the more narrowly distributed results for DiaSorin would make it difficult to

222

find such a specific cut-off with a reasonably preserved degree of sensitivity (Figure 1).

223

Considering the novelty of the disease, and hence the expedited development of

224

new assays, possible sources of systematic errors (e.g. cross-reacting antibodies against other

225

Coronaviridae) need to be carefully considered. In this study, all eleven false-positive

226

samples originated from unique donors, none of the samples being positive in more than one

227

assay. Further investigation of possible reasons for the false-positive results is, however,

228

beyond the scope of this evaluation.

229

We conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 assays only partly fulfil the performance

230

criteria proposed by regulatory authorities. Introduction into clinical use in low-prevalent

231

settings, must therefore, be made with careful consideration and well-informed stakeholders.

Figure 1. Differences in distribution patterns between Abbott, Roche and DiaSorin immunoassays for

320

detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Measured values from serology testing of 20 positive (SARS-

321

CoV-2 PCR confirmed) and 100 negative (pre-pandemic 2018) samples. Dotted lines represent cut-off

322

values of A) Abbott: positive result index ≥1.4 S/CO, B) Roche: positive cut-off index (COI) ≥ 1.0,

323

and C) DiaSorin: positive cut-off ≥ 15 AU/mL and equivocal 12-15 AU/mL. In C negative samples

324

with signals below detection limit (3.8 AU/ml) were plotted as 1.9 AU/mL.

Figure 2. Estimated PPV for the depicted assays, calculated at seroprevalences of 1%, 5%, 10%, 15%,

327

20%, 25% and 50%. Calculations were based on sensitivity, specificity and their respective 95% CI

328

limits from the current investigation (solid lines = mean values; grey areas = 95% CI). Dashed lines

329

represent mean sensitivity and specificity data from the manufacturers’ kit inserts. Dotted horizontal

330

lines refer to 90% PPV.
