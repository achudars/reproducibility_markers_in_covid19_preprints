Abstract

36

Covid-19 can induce lung infection ranging from mild pneumonia to life-threatening acute

37

respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Dysregulated host immune response in the lung is a key

38

feature in ARDS pathophysiology. However, cellular actors in Covid-19-driven ARDS are

39

poorly understood. Here, we dynamically analyzed the biology of innate T cells, a

40

heterogeneous class (MAIT, γδT and iNKT cells) of T lymphocytes, presenting potent anti-

41

infective and regulatory functions. Patients presented a compartmentalized lung inflammation

42

paralleled with a limited systemic inflammation. Circulating innate T cells of critically ill

43

Covid-19 patients presented a profound and persistent phenotypic and functional alteration.

44

Highly activated innate T cells were detected in airways of patients suggesting a recruitment to

45

the inflamed site and a potential contribution in the regulation of the local inflammation.

46

Finally, the expression of the CD69 activation marker on blood iNKT and MAIT cells at

47

inclusion was predictive of disease severity. Thus, patients present an altered innate T cell

48

biology that may account for the dysregulated immune response observed in Covid-19-related

49

acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Introduction

70

In December 2019 were first reported in Wuhan, China, pneumonia cases due to a coronavirus,

71

the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel strain related

72

to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, responsible for recent outbreaks. Disease presentation related

73

with SARS-CoV-2 (Coronavirus disease, Covid-19), can vary from mild disease to life-

74

threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is caused by a sustained and

75

dysregulated immune response triggered in the lung after initial insult, resulting in alteration of

76

alveolar-capillary membrane permeability and perturbed tissue repair1. This pathological

77

process leads to interstitial and alveolar oedema that profoundly impairs gas exchange.

78

However, the cellular and molecular factors that are responsible for this aberrant and persistent

79

inflammatory response are poorly understood2. In SARS-CoV infection, delayed type I IFN

80

response together with high viral loads were associated with defective adaptive response and

81

exaggerated tissue damage3. During severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, elevated pro-inflammatory

82

cytokines levels (e.g. IL-6 and TNF-α) were associated with more severe cases, supporting an

83

inflammatory hypothesis4–6. In addition, T cell lymphopenia has been correlated with disease

84

severity suggesting a role for these cells in the pathophysiology of severe Covid-195,6. Besides

85

classical adaptative CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, the T cell compartment comprises several lineages

86

of cells endowed with both innate and adaptive properties that are referred to as unconventional

87

or innate T cells (iT cells)7. This heterogeneous class of T cells comprises three main lineages

88

including Mucosal-Associated Invariant T (MAIT), γδT and invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT)

89

cells. They are restricted to quasi-monomorphic non-classical major histocompatibility

90

complex and have emerged as key players in mucosal immunity and inflammatory response8–

91

11

92

19-driven ARDS. First, iT cells mainly populate mucosal tissues including the lung and have

93

the ability to promptly produce substantial amounts of inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ

94

and IL-17A, two key cytokines in anti-infective response at barrier sites. Moreover, iT cells can

95

fine-tune the intensity and flavour of the host immune response shaping the magnitude of the

96

adaptive response. They can also participate in the process of the resolution of inflammation

97

including tissue repair and regeneration12–14, a critical step that is highly altered during ARDS.

98

Despite these pivotal functions, the putative contribution of iT cells in the pathophysiological

99

process of ARDS has never been explored.

. Given their versatile functions, iT cells emerge as interesting targets in the context of Covid-

100

Here, we dynamically assessed the relative frequencies and functions of iT cells in biological

101

fluids of thirty patients with severe Covid-19 admitted to intensive care unit (ICU). Our analysis

102

indicated that iT cells from critically ill Covid-19 patients displayed a phenotype of activated

103

cells associated with changes in their cytokine profile. Importantly, activated iT cells populated

104

the airways of patients presenting a strong local inflammation. In addition, the activation status

105

of blood iT cells on admission was predictive of the level of hypoxia during the course of

106

infection. Thus, our study indicates that an alteration in iT cell biology may account for the

107

sustained host immune response dysregulation observed in Covid-19-driven ARDS.

Results and Discussion

138
139

Lymphopenia and compartmentalized lung inflammation characterized critically ill Covid-

140

19 patients

141

Thirty patients admitted in ICU for severe Covid-19 were included. Baseline characteristics of

142

the patients are presented in Table 1. Median duration of symptoms before admission in ICU

143

was 10 days (8; 14), and ultimately, 24 patients (80 %) required invasive mechanical ventilation

144

(20 at admission). Among these mechanically ventilated patients, all presented an ARDS, 21

145

(70 %) received neuromuscular blockade, 18 (60 %) were placed on prone position and one

146

patient required extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation. On CT scan, we observed typical

147

bilateral diffuse ground-glass lesions in severe Covid-19 patients (Supplementary Figure 1A).

148

Upon enrolment, most of Covid-19 patients (22/30) presented mild to severe lymphopenia (0.75

149

x 109/L ± 0.06) (Figure 1A) accompanied by a higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as

150

compared to age- and sex-matched controls (Figure 1B). As reported15, we observed a positive

151

correlation between the degree of lymphopenia and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment

152

(SOFA) score (Figure 1C). Similarly, the lymphopenia was more pronounced in patients under

153

invasive mechanical ventilation as compared to patients who did not require invasive

154

mechanical ventilation (Figure 1D). Among the 30 critically ill Covid-19 patients, one died at

155

day 2 after inclusion and 14 (46.7%) were still in ICU at day 15, including 9 still under invasive

156

mechanical ventilation. The remaining 15 patients improved and were discharged from ICU to

157

other wards.

158

Although the circulating levels of the inflammatory mediators IL-1β and IL-6 were significantly

159

higher in Covid-19 patients as compared to age- and sex-matched controls (Figure 1E), the

160

detected amounts were relatively low, as previously reported6. Of note, the levels of plasma IL-

161

1RA were high suggesting an active anti-inflammatory process (Supplementary Figure 1B).

162

As judged by IFN-α2 levels, the type I IFN response, a critical component of the anti-viral

163

response16 was also low in the blood compartment of patients as compared to controls (Figure

164

1E). To monitor the local inflammation, we analyzed the same mediators in the supernatants of

165

endotracheal aspirates (ETA) of matched Covid-19 patients (Figure 1E). Strikingly, the

166

amounts of IL-6, IL-1β and to a lesser extent IFN-α2 were sky high in the airways suggesting

167

an intense local inflammation upon ICU admission (Figure 1F). Collectively, our data indicate

168

a compartmentalized inflammation in patients with severe Covid-19.

170

Blood innate T cell decrease in Covid-19 patients is paralleled with their presence in the

171

airways

172

While a T cell lymphopenia has been described in severe Covid-19 patients6, the innate T cell

173

compartment has not been investigated yet. Detailed analysis of circulating iT cells within total

174

T lymphocytes indicated a profound decrease in MAIT (~ 6-fold) and iNKT (~ 7-fold) relative

175

proportions in critically ill Covid-19 patients (Figure 2A) despite some comorbidities such as

176

obesity and/or diabetes can also partly contribute to this observation17,18. In the meantime, the

177

relative proportion of γδT cells remained unchanged (Figure 2A). However, by focusing on

178

subsets based on TCR repertoire, we observed that the frequency of Vδ2+ was slightly decreased

179

while the Vδ1δ2- cells were increased (Figure 2A). Of note, no significant differences could be

180

observed for the Vδ1+ subset (Figure 2A). This may indicate a particular contribution of this

181

γδT subset - likely Vδ3+ - during Covid-19 as suggested in other viral infections18.

182

The decrease in circulating MAIT and iNKT cells may have multiple causes. First, we

183

interrogated whether this could be a consequence of activation-induced TCR internalization.

184

However, mean fluorescence intensity for TCR expression indicated no modulation for the

185

iNKT TCR between patients and controls (Supplemental Figure 2A) while an increase

186

intensity was observed for the MAIT TCR of patients. In addition, the levels of intracellular

187

TCR Vα7.2 expression in T cells of patients did not indicate any signs of MAIT TCR

188

internalization (Supplemental Figure 2B).

189

Another explanation could be their migration into the airways of patients. Thus, we monitored

190

the putative presence of iT cells in ETA of Covid-19 patients under mechanical ventilation

191

(Table 1). We were able to recover cells - containing more than 1% of lymphocytes - in 12

192

ETA samples out of 21, enabling a further analysis of iT cells. MAIT and γδT cells were

193

detected in airways of all patients with an analysable lymphocyte compartment (Figure 2B).

194

Of note, airway iNKT cells were virtually undetectable in all samples. Interestingly, the

195

frequency of MAIT cells but not of γδT cells was higher in the airways as compared to blood

196

of matched-patients (Figure 2B) suggesting that the presence of MAIT cells in the airways

197

might be dependent on an active recruitment mechanism rather than blood vessel leakage due

198

to the alveolar-capillary barrier disruption. Furthermore, the presence of iT cells in ETA was

199

associated with a higher level of the chemoattractants for T cells CXCL10 and CXCL1219

200

(Figure 2C). Of note, one could argue that other causes such as increased cell death might

201

account in this phenomenon20. Altogether, these data indicate a decrease in circulating MAIT

202

and iNKT cells that may be a consequence of their recruitment into the airways.

204

Innate T cells displayed an altered functional profile in Covid-19 patients

205

Phenotypic analysis of iT cell in blood of Covid-19 patients showed an increased expression of

206

the activation marker CD69 in all subsets (Figure 3A). This phenotype was associated with a

207

higher level of IL-18 in the plasma of patients (Supplemental Figure 3), a cytokine associated

208

to iT cell activation during viral infections21–23. In parallel, we observed an increased level of

209

blood PD-1-expressing iT cells in patients suggesting a certain level of exhaustion (Figure 3A).

210

Of importance, the levels of CD69 and PD-1-expressing MAIT and γδT cells were significantly

211

higher in ETA compared to blood in matched patients (Figure 3B), which further support the

212

possible migration of activated blood iT cells into the lungs.

213

In addition, cytokine production by fresh blood iT cells was analyzed after short-term

214

PMA/ionomycin stimulation. Circulating MAIT and iNKT, and to a lesser extent γδT cells from

215

Covid-19 patients produced less IFN-γ as compared to cells from healthy donors (Figure 3C).

216

In the meantime, this was paralleled with an increased ability of iT cells from patients to

217

produce IL-17A (Figure 3C) although the levels detected were relatively low. This could be

218

partially explained by the migration of IFN-γ-producing iT cells to the lung tissue. In line with

219

the acute inflammation in the lung of Covid-19 patients24, the levels of IFN-γ and IL-17A were

220

more elevated in the supernatants of ETA compared to plasma of matched patients (Figure 3D).

221

Interestingly, they were present at higher concentration in iT cell-containing ETA samples

222

(Figure 3E) suggesting that iT cells may contribute to the production of IFN-γ and IL-17A in

223

airways of critically ill Covid-19 patients. Collectively, our data indicate a functional alteration

224

of iT cells in Covid-19 patients.

225
226

Alteration in innate T cell biology is persistent and correlates with disease severity

227

To gain insight into their temporal changes during Covid-19, the frequency and phenotype of

228

blood iT cells was monitored in patients during their stay in the ICU. We observed a decrease

229

in the frequency of MAIT cells at day 7 and then it was maintained to day 14 (Figure 4A). The

230

proportion of CD69- and PD-1-expressing MAIT cells followed a similar trend (Figure 4A).

231

The relative proportion of circulating iNKT cells was stable in critically ill Covid-19 patients

232

during their stay in ICU regardless of their clinical course (Figure 4B). The level of CD69-

233

expressing iNKT cells was reduced at day 7 and 14 while no significant changes could be

234

observed for PD-1 expression on iNKT cells while (Figure 4B). Similar to MAIT cells, the

235

relative proportion of γδT cells in was reduced at day 7 and a further decrease was noticed at

236

day 14 (Figure 4C). Regarding their phenotype, the levels of circulating PD-1-expressing γδT

237

cells was stable in patients while the relative proportion of their CD69-expressing counterparts

238

was decreased at day 7 and 14 (Figure 4C).

239

Finally, we interrogated whether alterations in iT cell biology could be predictive of the clinical

240

course of critically ill Covid-19 patients especially regarding the level of hypoxia, measured by

241

the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, a routine clinical variable for ARDS management1. Thus, we compared

242

multiple iT cell parameters on admission to the level of hypoxia at day 7. Although no

243

correlation could be observed for γδT cells, we observed that CD69 expression on MAIT and

244

iNKT cells was positively correlated to the PaO2/FiO2 ratio indicating a reduced level of

245

hypoxia (Figure 4D). Notably, no additional correlation could be observed for MAIT and iNKT

246

cells based on the other iT cell-related parameters including PD-1 expression and cytokine

247

production.

248

Altogether, these data indicate a persistent alteration in iT cell activation in Covid-19 patients

249

and the levels of activation on MAIT and iNKT cells upon admission can be predictive of

250

disease severity.

254

Clinical study design, patient population and approval

255

Patients (>18 years old) admitted in ICU with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing were

256

prospectively included in this study, from March 18th 2020 to April 17th 2020. The study was

257

conducted in one ICU from an academic hospital (Tours, France). All patients or their next of

258

kin gave consent for participation in the study. This work was part of an ongoing study

259

exploring immune response during community-acquired pneumonia (ClinicalTrial.gov

260

identifier: NCT03379207). The study was approved by the ethic committee “Comité de

261

Protection de Personnes Ile-de-France 8” under the agreement number 2017-A01841-52, in

262

accordance with the national laws. Blood samples from healthy volunteers (age- and sex-

263

matched) were obtained from the “Etablissement Français du Sang”.

Staining was performed using antibodies (Table S1) from Biolegend (San Diego, CA, USA)

267

and Miltenyi Biotec (Bergish Gladbach, Germany). PBS-57 glycolipid-loaded and control

268

CD1d tetramers (BV421-conjugated) as well as 5-OP-RU-loaded and control MR1 tetramers

269

(BV421-conjugated) were obtained from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious

293

Flow cytometry

294

Cells were stained with antibodies to surface epitopes and viability dye (LIVE/DEAD Fixable

295

Aqua Dead Cell Stain). For cytokine profile analysis, cells were stimulated for 4 h in RPMI1640

296

complete medium containing PMA (100 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 µg/ml) in presence of protein

297

transport inhibitor cocktail (eBioscience) added 1 hour after stimulation. For intracellular

298

staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized using the Fixation/Permeabilization Solution Kit

299

(BD Biosciences). Cells were stained with APC-conjugated mAb against IL-17A and PE-

300

conjugated mAb against IFN-γ. Events were acquired on a MACS Quant (Miltenyi Biotec)

301

cytometer. Analyses were performed by using the VenturiOne software (Applied Cytometry;

302

Sheffield, UK).

303
304

Statistical analysis

305

All statistical analysis was performed by using GraphPad Prism software. The statistical

306

significance was evaluated by using non-parametric unpaired Mann-Whitney U tests in order

307

to compare the means of biological replicates in each experimental group. In some cases, the

308

non-parametric Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was used. Results with a P value of

309

<0.05 were considered significant. ns: not significant; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.).
