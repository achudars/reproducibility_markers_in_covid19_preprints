Abstract
Background
Lifestyle factors including obesity and smoking are suggested to be related to increased risk of
COVID-19 severe illness or related death. However, little is known about whether these
relationships are causal, or the relationships between COVID-19 severe illness and other
lifestyle factors, such as alcohol consumption and physical activity.
Methods
Genome-wide significant genetic variants associated with body mass index (BMI), lifetime
smoking, alcohol consumption and physical activity identified by large-scale genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) were selected as instrumental variables. GWAS summary
statistics of these genetic variants for relevant lifestyle factors and severe illness of COVID-19
were obtained. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were conducted.
Results
Both genetically predicted BMI and lifetime smoking were associated with about 2-fold
increased risks of severe respiratory COVID-19 and COVID-19 hospitalization (all P<0.05).
Genetically predicted physical activity was associated with about 5-fold (95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.4, 20.3; P=0.02) decreased risk of severe respiratory COVID-19, but not with
COVID-19 hospitalization, though the majority of the 95% CI did not include one. No evidence
of association was found for genetically predicted alcohol consumption, but associations were
found when using pleiotropy robust methods.
Conclusion
Evidence is found that BMI and smoking causally increase and physical activity causally
decreases the risk of COVID-19 severe illness. This study highlights the importance of
maintaining a healthy lifestyle in protecting from COVID-19 severe illness and its public health
value in fighting against COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction
Obesity and smoking are lifestyle factors. Studies have reported the correlation between obesity
and severe illness or related death of COVID-191-3. For smoking, its relationship with the risk
of severe COVID-19 is not clear2,4,5; however, these studies considered smoking as binary or
categorical variables only without any consideration on the heaviness or duration. The Centre
for Disease Control and Prevention of US suggests that people with obesity and smoking are
at increased risk of COVID-19 severe illness6. The relationships are suggested by observational
studies, which of themselves have limited ability in supporting causality. For other lifestyle
factors, such as alcohol consumption and physical activity, little is known about if they are
associated with severe illness of COVID-19.
Mendelian randomization (MR) uses exposure-associated genetic variants as instrumental
variables to assess the causality between exposures and outcomes7. As genetic variants are
randomly allocated at conception, MR resembles a randomized controlled trial and is less
subject to confounding than observational studies. The publicly available genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) summary statistics provide valuable resources for assessing the
causality between lifestyle factors and the risk of COVID-19 severe illness. A MR study found
evidence that both body mass index (BMI) and smoking had a causal effect on the risks of
COVID-19 with respiratory failure and of hospitalization with COVID-19; however, the
estimated causal effects had limited precision8.
This study aimed to investigate the causality between four lifestyle factors, namely BMI,
smoking, alcohol consumption and physical activity, and severe illness of COVID-19 using the
two-sample MR approach9.

Methods
COVID-19 data source
Summary-level data were obtained from two GWAS analyses conducted by the COVID-19
Host Genetic Initiative10 (Release 4 in September 2020): 1) 2972 very severe respiratory
confirmed COVID cases, which were defined as hospitalized laboratory confirmed SARSCoV-2 infection (RNA and/or serology based) with death or respiratory support, and
hospitalization with COVID-19 as primary reason for admission, compared with 284472
population controls; and 2) 6492 hospitalized confirmed COVID cases, which were defined as
hospitalized laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (RNA and/or serology based) and

hospitalization due to corona-related symptoms, compared with 1012809 controls. The
majority (≥90%) of the participants included in the GWAS analyses were of European ancestry.
Details of the GWAS analyses can be found at https://www.covid19hg.org/.
Genetic instrumental variables to lifestyle risk factors
Genome-wide significant genetic variants identified from GWAS were selected as instrumental
variables to the investigated lifestyle risk factors. BMI: 656 independent sentinel variants
(P<10-8) identified from the meta-analysis of ~700000 individuals of European ancestry from
the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium and UK Biobank,
explaining ~7.0% variation in BMI11. Smoking: 126 independent variants (P<5´10-8) identified
from the GWAS of ~460000 individuals from the UK Biobank for a lifetime smoking measure
capturing smoking initiation, heaviness and duration, explaining 1.3% variation in the lifetime
smoking measure12. Alcohol consumption: 81 independent sentinel (P<5´10-8) variants
identified to be associated with drinks per week in a sample of ~940000 individuals of
European ancestry from the GWAS and Sequencing Consortium of Alcohol and Nicotine use
(GSCAN), explaining ~0.6% variation in alcohol consumption measured as drinks per week13.
Physical activity: five variants identified to be associated with accelerometer-measured overall
physical activity (measured as average vector magnitude) in a sample of ~91000 UK Biobank
individuals, explaining ~0.2% variation in overall physical activity14. Proxies with a minimum
linkage disequilibrium r2=0.8 were used for genetic variants that were unavailable in the
COVID-19 data sources (two, one and two variants for BMI, alcohol consumption and physical
activity, respectively; one alcohol consumption variant had no proxy available, so it was not
included in analysis).
Statistical analyses
The statistical power was calculated using the proportion of variation in the lifestyle risk factor
explained by the genetic instrumental variables, sample size of the COVID-19 GWAS, and
the method proposed by Burgess15.
The main analyses were performed using inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method under a
random-effects model16, which assumes that all genetic variants are valid instrumental
variables, or any horizontal pleiotropy must be balanced. For each risk factor, the reported odds
ratio (OR) on COVID-19 risk was for per standard deviation increase in the genetically
predicted value. Leave-one-out analyses, i.e., applying IVW after removing each genetic
variant in turn, were performed to assess the influence of each genetic variant on the results.

Sensitivity analyses were performed using MR-Egger regression17, weighted median method18
and weighted mode method19, which relax some MR assumptions and allow some genetic
instrumental variables to be invalid, but are less powerful than IVW method. The more
consistency across the point estimates of the methods, the greater the evidence supporting the
causal effect of the investigated risk factors on COVID-19 severe illness.
The analyses were conducted using the TwoSampleMR R package20. All statistical tests were
two-sided. Results with a nominal P-value <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
For BMI, lifetime smoking, alcohol consumption and physical activity, respectively, this study
has 80% statistical power at the significance level of 0.05 to detect an OR of 1.22, 1.57, 1.96
and 3.23 or greater on severe respiratory COVID-19, and an OR of 1.14, 1.36, 1.58 and 2.21
or greater on COVID-19 hospitalization.
Table 1 shows the causal effect estimates. Both genetically predicted BMI and lifetime
smoking measure were found to be associated with increased risk of COVID-19 severe illness:
the per-SD OR of genetic predicted BMI was 1.91 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.55, 2.35,
P=7.4´10-10) for severe respiratory COVID-19 and 1.75 (95% CI: 1.52, 2.01; P=9.0´10-10) for
COVID-19 hospitalization; the per-SD OR of genetic predicted lifetime smoking was 1.84 (95%
CI, 1.08 to 3.13, P=0.02) for severe respiratory COVID-19 and 2.15 (95% CI: 1.52, 3.03;
P=1.5´10-5) for COVID-19 hospitalization. No evidence of association was found for genetic
predicted alcohol consumption with severe respiratory COVID-19 or COVID-19
hospitalization. Genetically predicted physical activity was found to be associated with
decreased risk of severe respiratory COVID-19 (OR=0.19; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.74; P=0.02), but
not with COVID-19 hospitalization (OR=0.44; 95% CI: 0.18, 1.07; P=0.07), though most of
the 95% CI did not included one. Similar results were found from the leave-one-out analyses,
suggesting that the observed associations were not driven by any single genetic variant (Data
not shown). There was evidence of heterogeneity in the genetic variant-exposure effects for
BMI and alcohol consumption, but not for lifetime smoking and physical activity (Table 2).
From the sensitivity analyses (Figure 1), causal effect estimates with the same direction across
the methods were found for all the investigated risk factors, though some estimates were with
wider 95% CIs. Notably, positive associations (greater than the IVW estimates and the
detectable effect sizes under 80% power) were found for alcohol consumption using methods

other than the IVW method. Tests of MR-Egger regression intercepts suggested there was no
evidence of directional pleiotropy of the genetic instrumental variables, with exception that
weak evidence were found for BMI and alcohol consumption with severe respiratory COVID19 (both P<0.03; Table 3).

Discussion
Using a two-sample MR approach, this study found evidence that BMI and smoking have a
causal effect on increased risk of COVID-19 severe illness. These findings were the same as
those by Ponsford et al.8, but the causal effect estimates were of greater precision than those by
Ponsford et al., especially for smoking, e.g., the OR of smoking on COVID-19 hospitalization
estimated by Ponsford et al. was 4.27 (95% CI: 2.10, 8.65), while this study estimated it to be
2.15 (95%: 1.52, 3.03). The difference is due to that this study used the summary statistics from
COVID-19 GWAS analyses with larger sample sizes; Ponsford et al. used the summary
statistics from a GWAS of severe COVID-19 with respiratory failure including 1610 cases and
2205 controls21, and the Release 3 data from the COVID-19 Host Genetic Initiative including
3199 cases and 897488 controls in the GWAS of COVID-19 hospitalization.
For the first time, this study provided evidence that physical activity causally decreases the risk
of COVID-19 severe illness. However, only five genetic instrumental variables were used, and
they explained ~0.2% variation in physical activity only; the estimates for the causal effects
were of reduced precision. The findings are perhaps more important in terms of qualifying
causality than quantifying the causal effects.
As to alcohol consumption, this study had sufficient power to detect the observed IVW OR for
COVID-19 hospitalization, but not for severe respiratory COVID-19. Interestingly, results
from the MR-Egger regression, weighted median and weighted mode methods supported the
association between genetically predicted alcohol consumption and COVID-19 severe illness.
The consistency across the three methods suggest that the observed associations are unlikely
to be biased by violated assumptions of a certain method. The three methods allow some
genetic instrumental variables to be invalid. From the MR-Egger regression analyses, the
intercepts were estimated to be negative, and the one for severe respiratory COVID-19 was
even different from zero. Taking all these observations together, alcohol consumption might
have a positive causal effect on COVID-19 severe illness, while the genetic instrumental

variables overall might have negative directional pleiotropy, so the IVW results were not
different from null.
Limitations of this study included that there might be bias in the causal effect estimates, as
there was sample overlap between the lifestyle factors GWAS and COVID-19 GWAS, e.g.,
UK biobank participants were included in the GWAS of COVID-19 hospitalization. However,
given the proportions of COVID-19 cases in the GWAS analyses were low, any bias must be
minimal22.
In conclusion, this study finds evidence that BMI and smoking causally increase and physical
activity causally decreases the risk of COVID-19 severe illness. All these lifestyle risk factors
are modifiable, so they could be targeted to reduce severe illness of COVID-19. This study
highlights the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle in protecting from COVID-19
severe illness. The findings also have a profound public health value – a healthy lifestyle could
be helpful for fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic.
