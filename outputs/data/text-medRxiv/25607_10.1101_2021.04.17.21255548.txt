ABSTRACT
Aim. The aim of the current study was to compare clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and
major outcomes of patients hospitalized for COVID‐19 pneumonia with COVID-associated
hyperglycaemia or preexisting diabetes.
Methods. A cohort of 176 adult patients with a diagnosis of pre-existing diabetes (n=112) or
COVID-associated hyperglycaemia (n=55) was studied. Clinical outcomes and laboratory findings
were analysed according to the presence of the two conditions. The time to viral clearance was
assessed during the follow-up after hospital discharge.
Results. Patients with COVID-associated hyperglycaemia had lower BMI, significantly less
comorbidities and higher levels of inflammatory markers and indicators of multi-organ injury than
those with preexisting diabetes. No differences between preexisting diabetes and COVID-associated
hyperglycaemia were evident for symptoms at admission, humoral response against SARS-CoV-2
or autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase or interferon alpha-4. COVID-associated
hyperglycaemia was independently associated with the risk of adverse clinical outcome defined as
ICU admission or death (HR 2.11, 95% CI 1.34-3.31; p=0.001), even after adjustment for age, sex
and other selected variables associated with COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, we documented a
negative association (HR 0.661, 95% CI 0.43-1.02; p=0.063) between COVID-associated
hyperglycaemia and the time to swab negativization.
Conclusions. The recognition of hyperglycaemia as a specific clinical entity associated with
COVID-19 pneumonia is relevant for early and appropriate patient management and close
monitoring for the progression of disease severity.

INTRODUCTION
Increasing evidence suggests the existence of a bidirectional link between COVID 19 and
diabetes[1]. Preexisting diabetes is a risk factor for poor outcomes and death after SARS-CoV-2
infection[2-4]. On the other hand, new-onset hyperglycemia [5] and acute metabolic
decompensation of preexisting diabetes [6] are now emerging as complications of COVID-19
pneumonia, especially in patients requiring hospitalization. This suggests a potential diabetogenic
effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection, independent from the stress response to the acute illness[7]. Both
reduced insulin secretion and increased insulin resistance have been proposed as possible
mechanisms [8]. In fact, both endocrine and exocrine pancreatic tissues are susceptible to
productive SARS-CoV-2 infection[9, 10], which may damage β-cell integrity, and decrease insulin
secretion. Furthermore, the surge in cytokines production associated with the viral infection may be
responsible for an increase in insulin resistance[11]. Regardless of the mechanism responsible for
the metabolic dysregulation observed, the clinical entity of COVID-associated hyperglycaemia still
has not been adequately characterized and separated from the entity of preexisting diabetes[5]. Few
studies have comparatively characterized the two conditions as for the presence of comorbidities,
pre-hospitalization treatments, symptoms at admission and laboratory variables associated with the
severity of infection. Many studies have recently reported that COVID-associated hyperglycaemia
is associated with a poorer outcome compared to that of the normoglycemic individuals[12-17].
However, whether COVID-associated hyperglycaemia is associated with a poorer clinical outcome
compared to preexisting diabetes is still an open question, with conflicting findings [13, 15, 18-20].
Moreover, data on islet autoimmunity prevalence, anti SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses, and
timing for viral clearance are still missing. Finally, it is unclear whether COVID-associated
hyperglycaemia persists or reverts when the viral infection resolves. To address this gap in our
knowledge, we studied a cohort of 176 adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia, with a
diagnosis of preexisting diabetes or hyperglycaemia.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Study population and data sources. The study population consisted of 176 adult patients
hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia with a diagnosis of preexisting diabetes or hyperglycaemia.
These patients were selected from two previously described and partially overlapping cohorts [12],
assembled at the IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) as part of an institutional clinical–
biological cohort (COVID-BioB; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04318366) of patients with
COVID-19 pneumonia. The first cohort (n=584) was previously analysed for the humoral response
against SARS-Cov-2 (n = 509)[21], while the second cohort (n=169) was studied for the
development of thromboembolic complications. The study was approved by the local Institutional
Review Board (Comitato Etico - Ospedale San Raffaele; protocol n 34/int/2020; NCT04318366)
and all patients signed a written informed consent. A confirmed case was defined as presence of
symptoms and radiological findings suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia and/or a SARS-CoV-2positive RT-PCR test from a nasal/throat (NT) swab. Demographic information, clinical features
and laboratory tests were obtained within 72 hours from admission. Data were collected directly
through patients’ interviews or medical chart review. Data regarding patients' comorbidities were
collected during hospitalization or after discharge from both structured baseline patient interviews
and hospital paper or electronic medical records. All disease diagnoses present at the date of
infection were included as comorbidities. Data were verified by data managers and clinicians for
accuracy and crosschecked in blind. Data were recorded until hospital discharge or in-hospital
death, whichever occurred first. We also recorded mortality and swab negativization beyond
hospital discharge through our dedicate follow-up clinic: for patients non attending the follow-up
clinic, we verified patient’s vital status with either family members or family physician.
Laboratory variables Routine blood tests encompassed serum biochemistry [including renal and
liver function, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)], complete blood count with differential, markers of
myocardial damage [troponin T and pro-brain natriuretic peptide (proBNP)], and inflammation
markers [C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), interleukin-6 (IL4

6), procalcitonin]. An extended coagulation profile was obtained including D-dimer, PT, PTT,
fibrinogen and antithrombin activity. Specific antibodies to different SARS-CoV-2 antigens,
interferon alpha-4 and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) were tested by a luciferase
immunoprecipitation system (LIPS) assay, as previously described (11).
Definition of diabetes. Study participants were defined as having: a) preexisting diabetes if they
had a documented diagnosis of diabetes before the hospital admission for COVID-19 pneumonia
[fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥7.0 mmol/l or HbA1c ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol), or they were
prescribed diabetes medications]; b) COVID-associated hyperglycaemia if they had a mean fasting
plasma glucose in the absence of infusions of dextrose ≥7.0 mmol/l during the hospitalization for
COVID-19 pneumonia in the presence of a negative history for diabetes and/or normal glycated
hemoglobin level in the last year and in the absence of prescribed diabetes medications. We
computed mean fasting glucose and glucose variability (standard deviation) from all fasting
laboratory glucose values measured during hospitalization. The diagnosis of pancreatogenic and
steroid-induced diabetes was attributed to patients whose diabetes was reasonably secondary to their
exocrine pancreatic disease or steroid use. The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes was attributed to
patients whose diabetes at onset was associated with evidence of islet autoimmunity. The diagnosis
of type 2 diabetes was attributed to all patients who did not fulfil the criteria for any of the above.
Statistical analysis. Categorical variables are reported as frequency or percent, continuous
variables as median with inter-quartiles range (IQR) in parenthesis. Categorical variables were
compared using Chi-square or Fischer’s exact test, as appropriate; continuous variables using the
Mann-Whitney test. Associations between baseline variables and diabetes status was assessed by
logistic regression. Multiple regression models, each adjusted for age and sex and one additional
baseline variable of interest were performed. The effect estimates were reported as Odd Ratios
(ORs), outcome variable were pre-existing diabetes ore new onset diabetes as appropriate to obtain
OR >1.

Survival was estimated according to Kaplan–Meier. The time-to-event was calculated from the date
of symptom onset to the date of the event, or of last follow-up visit, whichever occurred first. We
used univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models to study the association between
patient characteristics with time to adverse outcome (a composite endpoint of admission to ICU or
death, whichever occurred first). The effect estimates were reported as Hazard Ratios (HRs) with
the corresponding 95% CI estimated according to the Wald approximation. Multivariate analyses
were performed including variables significant at the level of <0.1 in the univariate analysis.
Variables were excluded from multivariate Cox regression if they showed substantial biological
redundancy with other variables (e.g., aspartate aminotransferase vs alanine aminotransferase), had
data obtained for fewer than 78% of patients, in order to prevent model overfitting. Two-tailed P
values are reported, with P value <0.05 indicating statistical significance. All confidence intervals
are two-sided and not adjusted for multiple testing. Statistical analyses were performed with the
SPSS 24 (SPSS Inc. /IBM) and the R software version 3.4.0 (R Core Team (2020).

RESULTS
Study participants. The study population consisted of 176 adult patients (≥18 years) with preexisting diabetes or COVID-associated hyperglycaemia admitted between February 25th and May
2nd 2020 to the Emergency or Clinical departments of the IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital (Milan,
Italy). Among the 176 cases included in the study 11 (6.3%) were discharged without
hospitalization, 137 (77.8%) were treated with non-invasive ventilation and 39 (22.2%) were
admitted to the ICU over the hospitalization period. The median hospital stay was 17 (8-17) days.
As of February 14, 2021 the median follow-up time after symptoms onset was 213 (95% CI: 199227) days. Sixty-four patients died (36.4%). According to the composite endpoint of ICU admission
or death, 82 patients (46.6%) had an adverse in-hospital outcome.
COVID-associated hyperglycaemia was associated with specific basal characteristics.
Preexisting diabetes and COVID-associated hyperglycaemia accounted for 68.8% (n=121) and

31.25% (n=55) of our cohort, respectively. Among the 121 subjects with pre-existing diabetes, 109
(90.1%) were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, 4 (3.3%) with type 1 diabetes and 8 (6.6%) with
secondary diabetes (5 pancreatogenic, 3 steroid-induced). The characteristics of the study
participants for patients with pre-existing diabetes or COVID-associated hyperglycaemia at the time
of hospitalization are reported in Table 1. Sex- and age-adjusted logistic regression analysis was
used to assess the associations between baseline variables and pre-existing diabetes vs COVIDassociated hyperglycaemia. Higher BMI at admission [after log1p transformation OR 19.44 (2.204171.43), p=0.008], cardiovascular comorbidities [OR 3.16 (1.32-8.01), p=0.017], hypertension [OR
2.14 (1.04-4.4), p=0.038], active neoplastic disease [OR 3.69 (1.045-1.305), p=0.043] and chronic
kidney disease [OR 2.23 (0.897-5.56), p=0.084] were all associated with preexisting diabetes, while
comorbid neurodegenerative diseases were associated with COVID-associated hyperglycaemia
[OR 3.23 (1.044-10.02), p=0.042]. The median time from symptoms onset to hospital admission
was 6 (2-9.5) and 7 (3-10) days for patients with pre-existing diabetes and COVID-associated
hyperglycaemia, respectively (p=0.484). Patients with preexisting diabetes and COVID-associated
hyperglycaemia reported similar symptoms at the time of hospital admission for COVID-19
pneumonia (Table 1).
COVID-associated hyperglycaemia was associated with a specific clinical laboratory profile at
admission. Upon admission (Table 2), patients with COVID-associated hyperglycaemia exhibited
significantly higher white blood cell count [9.7 (6.1-14.3) vs 7.1 (5.4-10.4) x109/L, p=0.004],
neutrophil count [8.4 (4.85-12.9) vs 5.2 (3.9-8.1) x109/L, p=0.003], and tissue damage markers
[LDH 8.04 (5.35-16.63) vs 5.92 (4.42-8.17) μkat/L, p=0.001; AST 0.95 (0.65-1.39) vs 0.63 (0.421.14) μkat/L, p=0.001; ALT 0.78 (0.47-1.24) vs 0.53 (0.3-0.93) μkat/L, p=0.012] compared to
patients with preexisting diabetes. Furthermore, an increase in procalcitonin [0.95 (0.49-3.58) vs
0.61 (0.31-1.38) ng/ml, p=0.014] and hemoglobin [12.9 (11.5-14.6) vs 12.5 (10.75-13.5) g/L, p=
0.042] was evident, with a trend also for ferritin [1254 (585-2433) vs 823 (462-1499) μg/L, p=

0.063] and total bilirubin [11.62 (8.16-18.81) vs 9.23 (5.39-14.87) μmol/L, p=0.054]. All the other
laboratory variables associated with COVID-19 pneumonia severity, including inflammation
indices (CRP and IL-6), hemostatic variables (D-dimer levels, platelet count, fibrinogen, partial
thromboplastin time and prothrombin time), biomarkers of myocardial damage (troponin T and ProBNP), markers of liver and kidney function (albumin, phosphatase alkaline, creatinine) and glucose
control

were similar between preexisting diabetes and COVID-associated hyperglycaemia .

Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 were available for a large subgroup of patients (Table 2). No
differences between pre-existing diabetes and COVID-associated hyperglycaemia were evident for
IgG, IgM and IgA responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (RBD or S1+S2), IgG response to
NP, autoimmune antibodies anti GAD and anti interferon alpha-4.
COVID-associated hyperglycaemia was associated with a worse clinical outcome. Sex-and ageadjusted Cox proportional hazards model (HR 2.11, CI 1.34-3.31; p=0.001) and Kaplan-Meier
estimator log-rank test (p=0.005) indicated that COVID-associated hyperglycaemia was strongly
associated with an increased risk of adverse clinical outcome, as defined by composite endpoint of
admission to ICU or death, whichever occurred first. (Fig 1 and Table 2). Laboratory variables
associated with adverse clinical outcome in univariate Cox proportional hazards model, included
inflammation indices (CRP, IL-6, ferritin, procalcitonin, low lymphocytes count, high white blood
cell and neutrophil count), hemostatic parameters (D-dimer levels, fibrinogen and partial
thromboplastin time), biomarkers of myocardial damage (troponin T and Pro-BNP), markers of
liver and kidney dysfunction (albumin, total bilirubin and creatinine), markers of tissue damage
(lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate transaminase) and markers of glucose control (fasting plasma
glucose and glucose variability). Of note, the presence of hypertension (HR 0.59, CI 0.36-0.94;
p=0.028) and the treatment with Angiotensin II receptor blocker (HR 0.44, CI 0.22-0.85; p=0.014)
was associated to a decreased risk for adverse clinical outcome. A multivariable analysis using two
different models confirmed COVID-associated hyperglycaemia (HR 2.68, CI 1.47-4.89; p=0.001
and HR 1.72, CI 0.95-3.09; p=0.073 respectively) as an independent predictor of adverse clinical

outcome (Figure 1B) for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. To evaluate the specific impact of
clinical characteristics and laboratory tests, the univariate Cox proportional hazards model was also
conducted separately for patients with preexisting diabetes and those with COVID-associated
hyperglycaemia. Although many analysed factors were similarly associated with COVID-19
adverse clinical outcome in either COVID-associated hyperglycaemia or preexisting diabetes, some
qualitative or quantitative differences emerged (fig 1B).
Post discharge follow-up: time to NT swab negativization and persistence of hyperglycemia.
As the prolonged viral shedding is a risk factor for poor outcome of COVID‐19 and may interfere
with the immunological mechanism of virus elimination, in our study population we evaluated the
time to NT swab negativization. Sex-and age-adjusted Cox proportional hazards model (HR 0.661,
95% CI 0.43-1.02; p=0.063) and Kaplan-Meier estimator log-rank test (45 days, 95% CI 37-52 vs
35 days, 95% CI 29-41; p=0.023) documented a negative association between COVID-associated
hyperglycaemia and the time to NT swab negativization. We also evaluated fasting blood glucose
during the post-discharge follow up (i.e., at the 1, 3, 6, and 9 month outpatient visits). Among 121
subjects with preexisting diabetes, 40 died and 20 had no glucose measurements during follow up
(median 6 month). Of the remaining 61 patients with a prescribed treatment for diabetes, six had
normal fasting glucose (NFG) [9.8%, 90 (84.5-91.75) mg/dl], 21 impaired fasting glucose (IFG)
[34.4%, 112 (108-119) mg/dl] and 34 fasting glucose in the diabetes range (DFG) [55.7%, 160.5
(133-189.5) mg/dl]. Among 55 patients with COVID-associated hyperglycaemia, 23 died and 12
had no glucose measurements during follow up (median 6 month). Of the remaining 20 patients,
none had a prescribed diabetes treatment during follow up: six showed normalization of their
fasting glucose [30%; 86 (84-90 mg/dl)], while 14 were confirmed as having either IFG [n=8, 40%,
104 (100.2-111)] or DFG [n=6, 30%; 136 (126-148) mg/dl].

Hyperglycaemia [5] is emerging as a common feature among patients hospitalized for COVID‐19
pneumonia [22]. This COVID-associated hyperglycaemia still needs to be adequately characterized
since there are only few studies documenting how it differs from preexisting diabetes in COVID-19
patients. To address this issue, we studied a cohort of 176 adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia
with a diagnosis of preexisting diabetes or hyperglycaemia. Our study generated several interesting
findings. First, patients with COVID-associated hyperglycaemia had significantly less
comorbidities related to the metabolic syndrome than those with preexisting diabetes. The main
reason for this difference probably lies in the lower prevalence of obesity and a shorter duration of
hyperglycemia. Consistent with this, prior to admission only a low proportion of patients was
prescribed antihypertensive drugs, lipid‐lowering agents or antiplatelet therapy. However, it cannot
be excluded that the lower prevalence is an effect related to an underdiagnosis driven by the
absence of diabetes diagnosis. Similarly, the higher prevalence of neurodegenerative disease in
subjects with COVID-associated hyperglycaemia could be related with lower utilization of health
care and therefore lower rates of diagnosis of diabetes pre admission in patients with a cognitive
impairment. Second, patients with COVID-associated hyperglycaemia showed increased levels of
inflammatory markers and indicators of multi-organ injury compared to patients with preexisting
diabetes. Third, the prevalence of autoimmune biomarkers as anti GAD (a marker of islet
autoimmunity) or interferon alpha-4 antibody (an autoimmune marker recently associated with
COVID-19 severity) [23] was generally very low and did not differ between COVID-associated
hyperglycaemia and preexisting diabetes. Fourth, COVID-associated hyperglycaemia

was

associated with a poorer clinical outcome and a delayed time to viral clearance compared to
preexisting diabetes, despite the presence of a superimposable humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2
and similar glucose levels. Fifth, COVID-associated hyperglycaemia reversed in most patients
when the viral infection resolved.
Whether COVID-asociated hyperglycaemia should be considered a specific clinical entity is a
matter of discussion. In terms of

pathophysiology, hyperglycaemia may include (a) “stress10

induced” hyperglycemia; (b) previously unrecognized (pre)diabetes (either type 2 or, less likely,
type 1 diabetes); (c) a form of diabetes due to the direct effect of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on the
pancreas; or (d) a form of diabetes secondary to the treatment of COVID-19 (e.g., with
glucocorticoids or other medications possibly inducing secondary diabetes) [24-31]. To adequately
addressing this question would require the availability of pancreatic tissue or advanced studies on
insulin secretion and resistance, which would be unrealistic to perform during the acute phase of
COVID-19 pneumonia. Moreover, it is very likely that more than one cause may contribute to the
hyperglycemia associated with COVID. In our study, the absence of markers of islet autoimmunity
and the lower prevalence of comorbidities related to metabolic syndrome do suggest specific
pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for hyperglycaemia. More specifically, the extremely
low prevalence of GAD autoantibodies excludes a previously unrecognized autoimmune
(pre)diabetes (i.e. LADA) as possible cause of new onset diabetes. The use of glucocorticoids in the
first wave of the pandemic was very limited and, therefore, unlikely to have played a role in the
pathogenesis of hyperglycaemia. Moreover, as hyperglycaemia reverted in most patients when the
infection resolved, it is reasonable to hypothesize that reversible transient factors, such as
inflammation-induced insulin resistance, may play a role in causing hyperglycemia in those patients
[28].
Regardless of the pathophysiological mechanism, our study documented that COVID-associated
hyperglycaemia was associated with an adverse clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection and that
this association was independent from the major risk factors for disease severity. As good glycemic
control was indeed shown to reduce disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients with
hyperglycemia[32], early recognition and treatment of COVID-associated hyperglycaemia may
greatly benefit these patients. Therefore, our findings do strongly support the need to screen all
patients with COVID-19 pneumonia for hyperglycemia (i.e., blood glucose and/or HbA1c) at the
time of admission, despite a mute personal or family history of diabetes.

Since blood glucose levels in our study were not different in patients with either COVID-associated
hyperglycaemia or preexisting diabetes, factors other than hyperglycemia should be considered to
explain the differences in clinical outcome. A role could be played by a different drug treatment
prior to admission. Of note, in our study sex-and age-adjusted Cox proportional hazards model
indicated that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and/or angiotensin receptor
blockers (ARB) treatment was significantly associated with a better clinical outcome in preexisting
diabetes. Most studies, including several meta-analyses, found no substantial differences in the risk
for severe COVID-19 pneumonia associated with the prescription of common classes of
antihypertensive medications[33]. On the other hand, evidence of the beneficial effects of chronic
ACEi/ARB use, especially in hypertensive cohort of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, was
reported[34-37]. As the prevalence of hypertension is higher among patients with preexisting
diabetes, ACEi/ARB use may mediate a selective beneficial effect. Similarly, in our study around
60% of patients with preexisting diabetes was taking metformin and the treatment was associated
with a better clinical outcome. Concordantly, previous observational studies suggested that in
patients taking metformin the risk for COVID-19 mortality is reduced[38, 39]. Of great interest is
also the finding of a slow viral clearance in patients with COVID-associated hyperglycaemia.
Discordant data exist about differences in viral clearance or shedding in people with diabetes [40].
As increased glucose levels and glycolysis promoted Sars-CoV-2 replication in monocytes via
ROS/HIFα pathway activation leading to secondary T-cell dysfunction [41], this could explain the
delayed viral clearance associated with the acute hypeglycaemia in patients with COVID-associated
hyperglycaemia.
Our study has some limitations. First, the analysis was performed on a subcohort of 176 patients
selected for having hyperglycemia or preexisting diabetes out of 584 subjects of our original cohort
(12). All patients with diabetes/hyperglycaemia were included, and as for age, sex, hyperglycaemia
prevalence, and the clinical outcome of our cohort appears superimposable to those reported by
many authors. Despite this, we cannot exclude a selection bias. Second, our cohort is limited to

hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Third, we only assessed fasting blood glucose
and we acknowledge that more specific indicators of beta cell function, such as serum insulin and or
C peptide levels, should have been measured. Fourth, the lack of HbA1c measurements in our
cohort is a limitation. The evidence of normal HbA1c at the time of admission would indicate no
history of hyperglycemia and confirm the diagnosis of COVID-associated hyperglycaemia. HbA1c
levels were available for some patients with preexisting diabetes (51 (41-58) mmol/mol; 6.8%), but
in very few patients with COVID-associated hyperglycaemia (38 (36-40) mmol/mol; 5.6%), and for
this reason were not included in the analysis.
In conclusion, COVID-associated hyperglycaemia is emerging as a complication of Sars-CoV-2
infection and this clinical entity still needs to be adequately characterized in comparison with
preexisting diabetes. It is clear from our study that patients with COVID-associated hyperglycaemia
had increased levels of inflammatory markers and indicators of organ injuries associated with a
poorer clinical outcome compared to preexisting diabetes. This strongly support the need to screen
all COVID-19 patients for hyperglycemia at the time of admission, despite a mute personal or
family history of diabetes, and to treat them in order to reach and maintain a good glycemic control
during the hospitalization for COVID-19 pneumonia.

Figure 1 a-b. Adverse clinical outcome in patients with Sars-CoV-2 infection with either
preexisting diabetes or COVID-associated hyperglycaemia. Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival
without adverse clinical outcome for 176 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (panel a). Survival
without adverse clinical outcome (defined by composite endpoint of admission to ICU or death,
whichever occurred first) was estimated for patients with COVID-associated hyperglycaemia
(n=55) or preexisting diabetes (n=121). The log-rank test was used to test differences between the
two groups. Crosses indicate censored patients (censoring for death or end of follow-up). The forest
plots (panel b) show the hazard ratios for survival without adverse clinical outcome according to
presence of new-onset or preexisting diabetes. Left panel: univariate Cox regression analysis
adjusted for sex and age. Right panel: multivariate Cox regression analysis adjusted for sex and
age, including variables significant at the level of <0.1 in the univariate analysis. Variables were
excluded from multivariate Cox regression if they showed substantial biological redundancy with
other variables (e.g. aspartate aminotransferase vs alanine aminotransferase) or had data obtained
for fewer than 78% of patients. Dots represent the HR, lines represent 95% confidence interval (CI),
and solid dots indicate P < 0.05.

Figure 2 a-b. Post discharge follow-up: time to NT swab negativization and persistence of
hyperglycemia. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the time to NT swab negativization for 176 patients
with COVID-19 pneumonia (panel a). NT Swab negativization was estimated in patients with
COVID-associated hyperglycaemia (n=55) or preexisting diabetes (n=121). The log-rank test was
used to test differences between groups. Crosses indicate censored patients (censoring for death or
end of follow-up). Fasting blood glucose during the post discharge follow up (panel b). Valid
glucose measurements during follow up (median 6 month) was available for 61 out of 121 and 20
out of 55 patients with preexisting diabetes or COVID-associated hyperglycaemia, respectively.
