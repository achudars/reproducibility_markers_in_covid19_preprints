SUMMARY

37

The

38

Lymphopenia and cytokine levels are tightly associated with disease severity.

39

However, virus-induced immune dysregulation at cellular and molecular levels

40

remains largely undefined. Here, the leukocytes in the pleural effusion, sputum, and

41

peripheral blood biopsies from severe and mild patients were analyzed at single-cell

42

resolution. Drastic T cell hyperactivation accompanying elevated T cell exhaustion

43

was observed, predominantly in pleural effusion. The mechanistic investigation

44

identified a group of CD14+ monocytes and macrophages highly expressing CD163

45

and MRC1 in the biopsies from severe patients, suggesting M2 macrophage

46

polarization. These M2-like cells exhibited up-regulated IL10, CCL18, APOE, CSF1

47

(M-CSF), and CCL2 signaling pathways. Further, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were

48

observed in pleural effusion earlier than in peripheral blood. Together, our results

49

suggest that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection causes immune dysregulation by inducing

50

M2 polarization and subsequent T cell exhaustion. This study improves our

understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.

INTRODUCTION

53

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus, severe

54

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported in

55

December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. As of April 24, 2020, a total of

56

2,626,321 cases with 181,938 deaths have been confirmed globally, as reported by

57

the World Health Organization (WHO). This pandemic has quickly become a

58

unprecedent major public emergency of global concerns (Chan et al., 2020; Chen et

59

al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020b).

60

Most COVID-19 patients experience mild symptoms. However, a significant

61

proportion of the patients develop severe pneumonia and require ventilator-assisted

62

breathing (Guan et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). Patients with

63

severe diseases have significantly higher levels of inflammatory response in their

64

plasma compared to patients with mild disease, indicating dysregulation of immune

65

responses (Huang et al., 2020). A recent autopsy study of COVID-19 patients has

66

also revealed macrophage infiltration and excess production of mucus in the infected

67

lungs, especially in the damaged small airways and alveoli (Liu et al., 2020b).

68

Upon respiratory CoV infection, properly regulated immune response is essential

69

to control and eliminate the virus as well as to improve clinical outcome (Braciale et

70

al., 2012), whereas maladjusted immune responses may result in immunopathology

71

and impaired pulmonary gas exchange (Chen and Subbarao, 2007; de Wit et al.,

72

2016; Li et al., 2020a). Increased levels of serum proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-

73

1b, IL-6, IL-12, IFN-g, IP-10, and MCP-1) are associated with pulmonary

74

inflammation and extensive lung damage in SARS patients (Wong et al., 2004).

75

Meanwhile, another set of proinflammatory cytokines, including IFN-g, TNF, IL-15,

76

and IL-17 were induced in Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-

77

CoV) infection (Mahallawi et al., 2018). The disease-specific cytokine profiles indicate

78

that different host immune factors play a role in the pathogenesis of these highly

79

pathogenic CoV infections. A recent study has reported that serum inflammatory

80

cytokine profiles in severe COVID-19 patients is similar to that of SARS-CoV

81

infection, with elevated concentrations of IL-1b, IFN-g, IP-10, and MCP-1 (Huang et

82

al., 2020). In addition, either cytokine storm-relevant factors such as G-CSF and TNF,

83

or Th2-related cytokines such as IL-4 and inhibitory IL-10, were found with SARS-

84

CoV-2 infection (Huang et al., 2020). These results suggest that overall balance of

85

immune responses may be important in disease progression and host recovery from

86

respiratory CoV infections.

87

In SARS-CoV infected mice, we have found that exuberant inflammatory

88

responses and lung damage associated with dysregulated cytokine response induce

89

the accumulation of pathogenic inflammatory monocyte-macrophages (IMMs) in the

90

lung. The IMMs not only elevated lung cytokine/chemokine levels but also inhibited

91

SARS-CoV-specific T cell responses in mice, leading to delayed viral clearance and

92

deteriorated clinical outcomes (Channappanavar et al., 2016). In MERS-CoV-infected

93

mice, early type-I interferon treatment (IFN-I) was protective, whereas delayed IFN-I

94

treatment failed to effectively inhibit virus replication, increased infiltration and

95

activation

96

proinflammatory cytokine expression, resulting in fatal pneumonia (Channappanavar

97

et al., 2019). These studies suggest that not only proper cytokine response but also

98

inflammatory monocytes and/or macrophages play crucial roles in the respiratory

CoV pathogenesis.

104

respiratory dendritic cell migration from the lung to the draining lymph nodes (Zhao et

105

al., 2016). In MERS-CoV infection, the recovery of patients from MERS is also

106

associated with CD8+ T cell responses. MERS patients with robust viral-specific

107

CD8+ T cell response in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) but not viral-

108

specific CD4+ T cell response spent a shorter period in the ICU (Zhao et al., 2017). It

109

is likely that T cell responses also play an important role in viral clearance and host

110

recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the phenotype and function of T cells,

111

their behavior in the proinflammatory microenvironment, and their interaction with

112

other immune cells have not been elucidated in COVID-19 patients, particularly T

113

cells in human lungs which are most relevant clinically yet difficult to obtain from

114

human patients compared to PBMC.

115

Here, by integrating advanced single-cell technology and immunological

116

approaches, leukocytes derived from the pleural effusion, sputum, and peripheral

117

blood biopsies of severe and mild COVID-19 patients were analyzed. SARS-CoV-2-

118

specific T cells were detected in pleural fluid mononuclear cells (PFMC) earlier than

119

in PBMC and correlated with viral clearance. Immune dysregulation and T cell

120

exhaustion were observed, together with accumulation of T cell suppressive M2-

121

macrophages in PFMC. Further analyses suggested that severe SARS-CoV-2

122

infection induced M2-macrophage polarization in the lung that might play a role in

123

driving T cell exhaustion. These findings and mechanistic insights not only improved

124

our understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis and mechanism for immune

125

dysregulation, but also demonstrated the value of pleural effusion in translational

126

research with implications for disease diagnostics and treatment.

RESULTS

128

scRNA-seq revealed distinct immune cell composition and state in the COVID-

129

19 patient

130

A 70s old man infected with SARS-CoV-2 (confirmed by real-time PCR) developed

131

severe pneumonia and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the First

132

affiliated hospital of Guangzhou Medical University. Invasive ventilator-assisted

133

breathing was instituted at 9 days post symptom onset (d.p.o.). Thymosin (Zadaxin)

134

treatment was started from 10 d.p.o. Pleural effusion was observed at 19 d.p.o. and

135

drainage tube was placed. Pleural fluid (at 20 d.p.o.) and serial peripheral blood were

136

collected (Figure 1A). To characterize the immune responses in humans upon SARS-

137

CoV-2 infection, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on the

138

patient's paired pleural fluid mononuclear cells (PFMC) and peripheral blood

139

mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained at 20 d.p.o. Passing through rigorous quality-

140

control processes, the transcriptome profiles of 7,587 PFMC and 3,874 PBMC cells

141

were subjected to subsequent analysis (Figures 1B and S1A). A PBMC scRNA-seq

142

dataset (Zheng et al., 2017) composed of 9,707 cells from a healthy individual was

143

repurposed and integrated as a control, denoted H-PBMC. Most cell types were

144

conserved among the PFMC, PBMC, and H-PBMC samples, including CD4+/CD8+ T

145

cell subsets, B cells, NK cells, monocytes and macrophages, to a much less extent

146

dendritic cells (DC) and plasmacytoid DC (pDC) (Figures 1C-E, S1B). Consistent

147

with the finding of lymphopenia reported in other COVID-19 patients (Diao et al.,

148

2020; Liu et al., 2020a), absolute cell count assay showed that CD8+ T cell numbers

149

in the patient’s blood dropped far below the normal range (Figure S1C), with only a

150

slight decrease for CD4+ T cells and NK cells, and no significant change for B cells

151

(Figure S1C), resulted in increased CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratios in both PBMC and PFMC

152

comparing to H-PBMC (Figure S1D). CCR7+ naïve CD4+ T cells were predominant in

153

the patient’s PBMC, while PFMC contained more activated CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells

154

by frequency (Figures 1C,1D, S1D and S1E). The percentage of FOXP3+CD25+ Treg

155

and CD25 expression were higher in PFMC, and a group of IL10+ T cells was

156

exclusive in the patient’s PFMC (Figures 1C, 1D and S1F and S1G). Conventional

157

cell lineage markers and flow cytometry analysis further validated the clustering and

158

annotation results (Figures 1D, 1E and S1B). These data reflected the changes in

159

immune cell composition in pulmonary and peripheral in response to viral infection.

160

Of note, the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor angiotensin-converting

161

enzyme II (ACE2) was also examined in scRNA-seq (Zhou et al., 2020). Minimal

162

ACE2 expression was found in all immune cell types (Figure S1H).

163
164

Significant T cell hyperactivation and exhaustion were detected in the COVID-

165

19 patient

166

To investigate signaling transduction regulation associated with SARS-CoV-2

167

infection in human, ligand-receptor interaction analysis among seven major cell types

168

(i.e., naive/activated CD4+/CD8+ T cell, NK cell, macrophage, and monocyte) was

169

performed. More interactions were instigated than abolished upon infection (Figures

170

2A and S2A). Explicitly, CCR5-associated pathways involving chemokines CCL3,

171

CCL4, CCL5 and CXCR4 were induced in the activated CD8+ T cells in the patient’s

172

PFMC and PBMC, prominently in PFMC, suggesting CD8+ T cell hyperactivation

173

(Figures 2A-C and S2B) (Contento et al., 2008; Dairaghi et al., 1998; Honey, 2006;

174

Trifilo et al., 2003). The CCL2-CCR4 pathway was initiated in the activated CD4+

175

population accompanied by an elevated fraction of activated CD4+ cells which was

176

observed exclusively in PFMC (Figures 2B-2D and S2B). This was further confirmed

177

by flow cytometry analysis showing a higher proportion of CD4+ T cells expressed

178

CCR4 in PFMC than in PBMC (Fig. S2C). CCR4 is a key chemokine receptor guiding

179

T cell to the lung (D'Ambrosio et al., 2001), suggesting CCR4-expressing T cells

180

would be preferentially recruited to the infected site. We also observed mild and

181

strong induction of activated T-cell (CD38+HLA-DR+) population in PBMC and PFMC,

182

respectively (Figures 2D). Of note, the majority of these activated T cells highly

183

expressed PD-1 (Figure 2E), suggesting T-cell exhaustion upon activation. The

184

percentage of CD38+HLA-DR+PD1+ triple-positive CD4+ and CD8+ cells was

185

significantly higher in PFMC than in the patient’s PBMC indicating massive T-cell

186

exhaustion in PFMC where could more closely reflect the status of T cells in the lung

187

local inflammatory microenvironment (Figure 2F). Consistently, T cell exhaustion

188

markers, PDCD1 (PD1), LAG3, HAVCR2 (TIM3), and PRDM1 had enhanced

189

expression in PFMC in scRNA-seq analysis (Figures 2G and S2D; Table S1). Further,

190

activated T cells in the patient’s PFMC and PBMC also lost IL-2, IL-7R and TNF

191

expressions (Figure S2A) which are critical for T cell proliferation, survival, as well as

192

signs for early T cell exhaustion (Wherry et al., 2007; Yi et al., 2010). NK and B cell

193

responses to the infection were also investigated. NK/B cell activation pathway

194

genes including CD160, KLRK1 and CD22 (Clark and Lane, 1991; Haas et al., 2018;

195

Le Bouteiller et al., 2011; Orr and Lanier, 2010) were found to be significantly down-

196

regulated in patient’s PFMC and PBMC (Figures S2D and S2E; Table S1). Taken

197

together, these results demonstrated that T cells in COVID-19 patients underwent

198

significant hyperactivation and exhaustion upon prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection,

199

especially in the lung which could contribute to the delayed viral clearance.

To elucidate the mechanism causing changes in T cell function and exhaustion post-

206

macrophage

207

macrophages in the COVID-19 patient’s samples were then analyzed. GO term

208

analysis of macrophages confirmed that negative regulators of immune response

209

were selectively enriched in PFMC, while T cell activators were enriched in PBMC

210

and H-PBMC (Figures S3A-S3C). Consistently, anti-inflammatory factors (Stoger et

211

al., 2012), including the M2-macrophage markers, CD163 and CD206 (MRC1)

212

(Mantovani et al., 2002), exhibited elevated expression levels on monocytes and

213

macrophages in PFMC, whereas pro-inflammatory marker expression levels were

214

decreased or unaltered (Figures 3A, 3B and S3A). M2 macrophages are key players

215

in T cell exhaustion in the tumor microenvironment and chronic viral infections (Jiang

216

et al., 2015). The potential M2-macrophage polarization event was further validated

217

by elevated expression of M2 polarization regulatory components in PFMC, including

218

CCL2, CSF1, and SPP1 in monocytes as well as APOE, IL10, and CCL18 in

219

macrophages. (Deng et al., 2018; Murray, 2017; Sierra-Filardi et al., 2014; Svensson-

220

Arvelund et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2017) (Figures 3C and 3D).

221

APOE and IL-10 are known to induce T cell exhaustion (Deng et al., 2018; Pestka et

222

al., 2004; Yi et al., 2010). Notably, these molecules represented most of the PFMC-

223

specific associations with their receptors upon viral infection (Figures 2A and 2B).

224

Flow cytometry analysis of CD14+ monocytes and macrophages in PFMC also

225

demonstrated the presence of CD206+ and CD163+ populations which were

226

consistent with M2 macrophage phenotype (Figure S3D) (Mantovani et al., 2002).

227

Interestingly, the majority of CD163+ cells express PD-1 while CD206+ cells express

228

TIM-3, and Poly I:C induced IL-10 expression was primarily found in CD206+TIM-3high

229

cells (Figure S3D). Moreover, CCL-2 and IL-10 concentrations were higher in pleural

230

effusion than those in patient plasma, agreeing with the M2 macrophage-driven

231

microenvironment (Figure 3E). Collectively, these results supported the notion that

M2 macrophages polarized pulmonary microenvironment potentially contributed to T

233

cell dysfunction in the severe COVID-19 patient (Figure 3F).

234
235

Characterization of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses in pleural effusion

236

and peripheral blood biopsies of the COVID-19 patient.

237

To characterize virus-specific T cell responses in the patient, PFMCs and PBMCs

238

were stimulated with SARS-CoV-2-specific peptide pools in the presence of brefeldin

239

A. Enhanced number and percentage of viral-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells,

240

determined by IFN-g expression, were observed in PFMC at 20 d.p.o. However,

241

virus-specific T cells were absent in PBMC until later d.p.o. and slowly increased

242

over time (Figures 4A and 4B). Immunocompetent CoV-specific T cells tend to

243

produce multiple cytokines upon peptide stimulation (Zhao et al., 2017). We

244

previously found that in MERS convalescent patients, most of the MERS-CoV-

245

specific T cells co-produced IFN-g+ and TNF+ (Zhao et al., 2017). To evaluate the

246

functionality of virus-specific T cells in this patient, co-expression of TNF by IFN-g+ T

247

cells was examined. Most of the virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells did not

248

produce TNF in PFMC at 20 d.p.o. and in PBMC at 29 d.p.o. which was consistent

249

with an exhaustion phenotype (Yi et al., 2010) (Figure 4C). The percentage of IFN-g+

250

TNF+ virus-specific T cells increased in PBMC at 38 d.p.o. when the patient’s

251

condition improved (Figure 1A). Of note, most of the IFN-g+ or IFN-g+TNF+ cells in

252

PFMC were CD38+HLA-DR+ which were much higher than those in PBMC (Figure

253

S4A), indicating virus-specific T cells were hyperactivated in the pleural effusion.

254

Finally, the longitudinal elevation of both numbers and functionality of virus-specific T

255

cells were correlated with decreased viral loads in throat swab and sputum

256

specimens (Figure 4D) and disease amelioration (Figure 1A), indicating T cells were

257

Corroboration of M2-Polarization in the Sputa of Severe COVID-19 Patients

260

To validate the macrophage-driven T cell suppression observed in the severe

261

COVID-19 patient's PFMC, sample size was expanded by including cells isolated

262

from sputum samples from 4 patients, with 2 severe and 2 mild cases (Figure 5A;

263

Table S2). scRNA-seq of these samples revealed 4 major cell types, B cells, epithelia,

264

macrophages, and monocytes (Figures 5B, 5C and S5A). Intriguingly, two samples

265

from severe cases were composed of a larger macrophage population and lower

266

percentages of B cells and epithelia than those in mild patients (Figure 5D).

267

Consistent with PFMC, the anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage markers exhibited

268

higher expression, whereas the pro-inflammatory markers displayed lower mRNA

269

levels in the sputa of the severe COVID-19 patients (Figures 5E, S5B and S5C).

270

Besides, elevated expression of M2-polarization markers further verified the M2

271

macrophage activation events in the severe cases and highlighted the stage-specific

272

immune response post-SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 5F and S5D). Flow cytometry

273

analysis of CD14+ leukocytes showed increased M2 macrophages in the severe

274

COVID-19 patient comparing to the mild cases (Figure 5G). In addition, the

275

percentage of M2 cells and M2 polarization related cytokines in sputum were

276

decreased when the severe patient’s condition improved (Figures 5H and 5I),

277

indicating the correlation between M2 cell activation and disease severity.

DISCUSSION

279

SARS-CoV-2 is the causative pathogen of COVID-19 pneumonia (Zhou et al.,

280

2020). The elderly and individuals with comorbidities are at higher risk for severe

281

disease (Guan et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020b). No drug or vaccine has yet been

282

approved for human use due to the lack of understanding of disease pathogenesis

283

and immune responses in human.

284

Our study provides a framework to systematically investigate immune profile

285

in COVID-19 patient-derived PFMC and sputum biopsies. By integrating advanced

286

single-cell technology and immunological approaches, M2-macrophage polarization-

287

driven T cell exhaustion upon viral infection in the lung was mechanistically revealed

288

suggesting T cell suppression and dysregulation in infection site of severe COVID-19

289

cases. SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were also detected in PFMC earlier than in

290

PBMC of the patient, demonstrating the advantage of utilizing PFMC biopsies. The

291

sensitivity and reliability of PFMC over PBMC had been underlined throughout this

292

study. In addition to the earlier emergence of the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell

293

population, PFMC also encompassed a higher number of hyperactivated T cells. A

294

group of CD14+ M2 macrophage-like cells highly expressing M2 polarization markers,

295

and as well as T cells expressing exhaustion markers were also exclusively found in

296

PFMC. Comparing to the subtle hints from PBMC, PFMC served as a robust tool and

297

provided consistent mechanistic evidence of immune dysregulation.

298

As excess fluids in the pleural cavity surrounding the lungs, pleural effusion

299

had been found to associate with severe pulmonary infections, including MERS (Das

300

et al., 2015) and COVID-19 (Shi et al., 2020). Pulmonary pathological

301

microenvironment had been reported to increase the permeability of the capillaries in

302

the lung, leading to exudate pleural effusion (Porcel and Light, 2006, 2008). Thus,

303

PFMC was reasoned to share closer immune properties in the SARS-CoV-2-infected

305

microenvironment. Further, post-mortem examination of a severe COVID-19 case

306

illustrated thickened pleura with extensive adhesion to the lung tissue (Liu et al.,

307

2020b) suggesting the involvement of pleura and pleural fluids in disease

308

pathogenesis. These evidences supported our conclusion and highlighted the

309

translational value of this study.

310

The cutting-edge single-cell analysis of the PFMC biopsy facilitated the

311

profiling of the heterogeneous immune response in the patient. Through ligand-

312

receptor interaction analysis, enhanced T cell activation and exhaustion pathways

313

were accompanied by the elevation of their mRNA expression levels. Furthermore,

314

augmented M2 polarization markers in the monocytes and macrophages

315

mechanistically linked T cell exhaustion with M2 macrophage activation, reflecting

316

virus-induced T cell suppression, which is consistent with our previous finding that

317

alveolar macrophages play inhibitory roles on virus-specific T cells in SARS-CoV

318

infected mice (Zhao et al., 2009). Although prevailing perspectives had associated

319

exuberant inflammatory response with severe CoV cases (Mahallawi et al., 2018;

320

Wong et al., 2004), COVID-19 exhibited distinct pathological phenotypes indicating it

321

has distinct immune properties after infection. In contrast to SARS, the COVID-19

322

autopsy displayed less fibrosis, suggesting a dampened release of pro-inflammatory

323

factors (Biswas et al., 2011). Huang et al. also reported the increased secretion of

324

immunosuppressive cytokines, IL-4 and IL-10, demonstrating a COVID-19-specific

325

cytokine profile (Huang et al., 2020). In a mouse model of SARS-CoV infection,

326

STAT-I was also found to induce M2 polarization, causing pulmonary damage (Page

327

et al., 2012). These pathological and immunological analyses supported that immune

328

dysregulation and dysfunction contributed to COVID-19-specific pathogenesis,

329

echoing our observations in the severe COVID-19 cases.

330

Our findings unveiled that the immunoinhibitory pulmonary environment

331

driven by M2 macrophage polarization induced T cell suppression in severe COVID-

332

19 patients, suggesting anti-M2 treatment as a potential therapeutic strategy. Some

333

approved anti-M2 strategy has already achieved good clinical outcomes in anti-tumor

334

therapy (Tariq et al., 2017). Agents such as targeting of IL-10, CCL2, and CSF

335

signaling axis have demonstrated efficacy in preclinical breast cancer (Germano et

336

al., 2013; Tariq et al., 2017; Zollo et al., 2012). Alternatively, enhancing M1 with anti-

337

CD40 or CD25 monoclonal antibody (mAb) to suppress M2 polarization has also

338

been reported (Buhtoiarov et al., 2005; Jacobs et al., 2010; Tariq et al., 2017).

339

Besides, severe COVID-19 patients in our hospital were regularly treated with

340

Thymosin (Zadaxin), a T cell stimulator which has been shown to stimulate T cell

341

development, differentiation and proliferation (Costantini et al., 2019; Garaci et al.,

342

1995; Jiang et al., 2011). After Zadaxin treatment, increased NK and CD8 T cell

343

numbers and partially reversed T cell exhaustion were observed, indicating Zadaxin

344

could potentially restore T cell function (Figures S1C and Fig 4C).

345

Lymphopenia had been considered as a signature of severe COVID-19

346

infection (Bermejo-Martin et al., 2020). Meanwhile, impaired lymphatic tissue in

347

spleen and lymph node shrinkage was observed in a COVID-19 autopsies (Liu et al.,

348

2020b), indicating massive damage of immune system. Integrating our findings, to

349

maintain the proliferation and functionality of T cells before the massive immune

350

suppression would prevent the deterioration of disease. Conversely, the progression

351

of T cell suppression could lead to excessive T cell exhaustion, and consequently,

352

result in delayed viral clearance.

353

In conclusion, our study utilized the pleural effusion and sputum biopsies

354

derived from severe COVID-19 cases to dissect the heterogeneity of immune

355

response upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in human. Specifically, strong mechanistic

(E) Concentrations of MCP-1 and IL-10 in the patient’s plasma at the indicated d.p.o. and in the pleural
fluid were quantified using BD Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) assay.
(F) A model of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 infects pneumocytes and induces monocyte
production of cytokines (MCP-1, M-CSF) that mediate M2 polarization. Activated M2 produce APOE,
IL-10 and CCL18 that can inhibit activated T cells and induce T cell exhaustion, leading to the virus
immune evasion.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

361

Patient information

362

A 70s old man was laboratory-confirmed positive for novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)

363

infection by real-time PCR. After a 9-day treatment in an isolation ward, the patient

364

became critically ill with respiratory failure and multiple organ dysfunctions, and was

365

transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the First Affiliated Hospital of

366

Guangzhou Medical University on Feb 3, 2020. Notably, pleural effusion was

367

observed on Feb 13 and a thoracentesis was performed under ultrasound guidance

368

and a draining tube was placed on Feb 14. The respiratory support for this patient

369

was successfully switched from invasive mechanical ventilation to non-invasive

370

intermittent positive pressure ventilation on March 1. The patient is still in ICU and

371

gradually recovering now. Additional 3 severe patients and 2 mild patients were also

372

included in this study.

373
374

Study approval

375

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of

376

Guangzhou Medical University with written consent form acquired from the patient.

377

Patient samples were obtained at the indicated times and clinical information was

378

retrieved from the clinical record.

379
380

Sample collection and preparation

381

Throat swabs, sputum, peripheral blood and pleural fluid samples were collected by

382

professional nurses in the hospital and were processed in a biosafety level 2 plus

383

laboratory with biosafety level 3 personal protection equipment. For RNA detection, 3

384

mL DMEM medium containing 2% FBS was added to swabs and sputum tubes, and

385

following 2500 rpm, 15-30 sec vortex and 15-30 min standing, the supernatant was

386

collected and added to lysis buffer for RNA extraction. Supernatant from pleural fluid

387

was collected following 400 g, 5 min centrifugation for RNA extraction or cytokine

388

detection, and cells in the pleural fluid (PFMC) were freshly used for 10x single-cell

389

RNA-seq or cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. Sputa were washed once with equal

390

volume of PBS, supernatant was collected for cytokine analysis. Sputa were then

391

treated with equal volume of 0.2% DTT in PBS and cells were collected by

392

centrifugation. Plasma was collected from peripheral blood and PBMCs were isolated

393

using Leucosep tubes (Greiner) and Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare) according

394

to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plasma was stored at -80oC for cytokine detection

395

and PBMCs were freshly used for 10x single cell RNA seq or stored in liquid nitrogen.

396
397

Viral load quantification

398

Nucleic acid of respiratory samples was extracted using a Viral RNA extraction kit

399

from Zybio Inc (Chongqing). An in-house real-time PCR kit targeting the SARS-CoV-

400

2 orf1ab gene region was provided by Zybio Inc. Viral loads in respiratory specimens

401

were measured by qRT-PCR and standardized as PFU/ml relative to a positive

402

control (authentic SARS-CoV-2) with known infectious viral titer.

403
404

Cytokine quantification

405

Cytokine levels in plasma, sputum and pleural fluid were quantified using BD

406

Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) according to the manufacture’s protocol with slight

407

modification. Briefly, 50 µL sample was incubated with 50 µL mixed capture beads

408

and 50 µL detection reagent at RT for 3 hours in the dark. Beads were then washed

409

once with 1 mL wash buffer by centrifugation at 300 g for 5 min. Beads were

410

ultimately suspended in the BD Cytofix fixation buffer instead of Assay Diluent. A

411

single set of diluted standards was used to generate a standard curve for each

analyte. Flow cytometry data were acquired on a BD FACSVerse flow cytometer and

413

analyzed using FCAP v3.0 software.

414
415

Absolute cell count

416

To determine absolute numbers of leukocyte subpopulations in blood, BD Trucount

417

tubes (BD, Catalog No. 340334) were used. Briefly, a 20 µL fluorescence-conjugated

418

antibody cocktail was added to the Trucount tube, followed by 50 µL fresh whole

419

blood, mixed well and incubated for 15 min at room temperature (RT) in the dark.

420

Then 450 µL BD FACS lysing solution (BD, Catalog No. 349202) was added and

421

incubated for 15 min at RT to lyse red blood cells. Samples were analyzed on a

422

FACSVerse flow cytometer.

423
424

SARS-CoV-2 peptide library

425

To generate a SARS-CoV-2 peptide library, the sequence from a reference strain,

426

BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-01/2019 (Accession No. EPI_ISL_402119) isolated from a

427

patient during the early SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Wuhan, China was used. A total of

428

two hundred and eighty 20-mer peptides overlapping by 10 amino acids, covering the

429

four SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, including the spike (S) glycoprotein, the

430

nucleocapsid (N) protein, and the transmembrane (M) and envelope (E) proteins,

431

were synthesized and used for stimulation of PBMCs and PFMCs in vitro. Virus-

432

specific T cell responses were subsequently determined using intracellular cytokine

433

staining assays for interferon-gamma (IFN-g) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)

434

expression.

435
436

Flow cytometry

437

For surface staining, 105 to 106 cells were blocked with Fc receptor blocking solution

(Biolegend), stained with the indicated antibodies at RT for 15 min, labeled with

439

LIVE/DEAD staining dye (Thermo Fisher), and then fixed with Cytofix Solution (BD

440

Biosciences). For intracellular cytokine staining, 105 to 106 cells per well were

441

cultured in 96-well round-bottom plates at 37°C for indicated times in the presence of

442

brefeldin A (BD Biosciences) and stimulators as follows: for virus-specific T cell

443

stimulation, SARS-CoV-2 peptide pool (0.15~0.3 µM for each individual peptide,

444

GenScript) was used; for bulk T cell stimulation, 50 ng/mL PMA (SIGMA) + 1µg/mL

445

ionomycin (abcam) was used; for macrophage stimulation, 1µg/mL Poly (I:C)

446

(Invivogen) was used to mimic viral RNA. Cells were then labeled for cell surface

447

markers, fixed/ permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm Solution (BD Biosciences), and

448

labeled with anti-intracellular cytokine/protein antibodies. Flow cytometry data were

449

acquired on a BD FACSVerse or a BD Aria III flow cytometer and analyzed using

Single-Cell RNA library preparation and sequencing

457

Cell suspensions were loaded onto a chromium single-cell chip to generate single-

458

cell gel bead-in-emulsions (GEMs) aiming for 2,000–8,000 single cells per reaction.

459

The single-cell 3'-library was constructed using Chromium Single Cell Reagent Kits

460

v3 (10X GENOMICS) following the manufacturer’s user guide. Following cell lysis,

461

first-strand cDNA synthesis and amplification were carried out according to the

462

instructions. Amplified cDNA was purified using SPRIselect beads (Beckman Coulter)

463

and sheared to 250-400 bp. cDNA quality control was performed using Qubit 3.0

464

Fluorometer and Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. The linear DNA libraries were converted

465

to a single-stranded circular(ssCir) DNA library by MGI Easy Universal Library

496

cells 1,000 times and determined the mean of the average receptor expression level

497

of a cluster and the average ligand expression level of the interacting cluster. For

498

each receptor–ligand pair in each pairwise comparison between two cell types, this

generated a null distribution. We obtained a P-value for the likelihood of cell-type

500

specificity of a given receptor–ligand complex by t-test. We then prioritized the

interactions that are highly enriched between cell types based on the number of
