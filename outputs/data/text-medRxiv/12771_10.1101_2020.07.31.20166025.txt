Abstract
In the present work, we outline a set of coarse-grain analytical models that can be used by decision-makers to bound the
potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on specific communities with known or estimated social contact structure and to
assess the effects of various non-pharmaceutical interventions
on slowing the progression of disease spread. This work provides a multi-dimensional view of the problem by examining
steady-state and dynamic disease spread using a network-based
approach. In addition, Bayesian-based estimation procedures
are used to provide a realistic assessment of the severity of outbreaks based on estimates of the average and instantaneous basic reproduction number R0 .

1. Introduction
Network structure plays an important role in disease spread.
Most network models assume full mixing where all individuals are equally likely to become infected. However, most realworld networks have vertex degree distributions that are highly
nonuniform. In the sections that follow, we derive a mathematical framework for determining both the steady-state and dynamic disease spread on complex networks using the concept of
bond percolation. The analysis borrows liberally from the work
of Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani [1] and Newman [2, 3, 4, 5].
Percolation theory is easily explained through analogy. Consider an old fashion coffee percolator consisting of two glass
flasks, the lower flask for heating the water and the upper flask

for holding the coffee grounds. As water is heated in the lower
flask, it begins to ascend through the tube connected to the upper flask. Initially, the water penetrates only a small portion of
the coffee grounds. Upon further heating, the water penetrates
more of the coffee grounds. At some point, there is an abrupt
transition where all of the grounds are saturated and convective mixing occurs. Percolation implies the existence of a long
path connecting points separated by a distance on the order
of the network size (in this case, the layer of coffee grounds).
For a pandemic, this long path connects individuals together
into a large cluster. It turns out that percolation is a critical
phenomenon; that is, the onset of percolation occurs rapidly.
Most networks of sufficient complexity undergo phase transitions, where small components (outbreaks) suddenly coalesce
into a giant component (pandemic) that extends across the entire network when one or more critical parameters, such as disease transmissibility are exceeded. Mean-field theory, a branch
of statistical mechanics used to analyze physical systems with
multiple components, can be used to characterize these regions
[6]. The main idea is to replace all interactions on a component
with an average or effective interaction. Insights into the behavior of a system can, therefore, be obtained at relatively low
computational cost.
The flow chart in Fig. 1 outlines two analytical models suitable for describing the steady-state and time-dependent (dynamic) properties of disease progression on a social network.
We present a third model that is used for estimating critical
parameters (such as the basic reproduction number R0 ) from
empirical outbreak case data. The steady-state model uses the
theory of bond percolation to predict the outbreak size distribution prior to a pandemic, the size of the pandemic in terms
of the proportion of affected individuals, and the risk of individual infection based on an individual’s contact network. We
consider two types of non-pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs)
– uniform social distancing where a randomly selected portion
of the population is sequestered and directed social distancing
where individuals with the largest number of contacts are sequestered (which effectively targets super-spreaders). The dynamic model uses a degree-based approximation to the Susceptible, Infectious, or Recovered (SIR) model based on an approach
outlined by Barthélémy and Pastor-Satorras [7]. We generalized
the model to examine the effects of uniform social distancing,
testing, and contact tracing on the proportion of susceptible
individuals, infected individuals, outbreak cases, and the basic

reproduction number (R0 ) as a function of time. In addition,
assessments of various NPIs, testing, and contact tracing procedures can be determined in near real-time for both analytical
and empirical networks derived from census data.
The third model uses the degree-based SIR model and Bayesian
estimation procedures to determine the average basic reproduction number (R0 ) from tabulated outbreak cases at a state,
county, and city-wide level. Additionally, we use a particlebased filter to determine the instantaneous R0 over time. Together, these estimates can be used to predict the proportional
number of infections and outbreak cases over time. The analytical models shown in Fig. 1 provide an overview of the
mathematical framework derived in the present work. In the
materials and methods section we first outline the steady-state
disease spread on social contact networks as a function of the
degree distribution of the community and the transmissibility of
the disease. We then present the extension of the framework to
capture the dynamic properties of disease spread and the implementation and lifting of NPIs. Next we introduce the Baysianbased estimation procedure for inferring network structure from
empirical case data. In the results section we present examples
for three different degree distributions and illustrate the different risk measures that can be derived from the mathematical
framework. We also show how the Bayesian-based model can
be used to predict cases and R0 for New York state using cases
data collected by Johns Hopkins University [8]. We close with
a brief discussion of the results and potential application of the
framework.

2. Materials and methods
Throughout this section we use precise definitions of certain
properties of epidemiological models based on Meyers et al.,
Bettencourt et al. and Chowell et al. [9, 10, 11].
• Transmissibility T is the average probability that an
infectious individual will transmit the disease to a susceptible individual with whom they have contact
• Critical Transmissibility Tc is the minimum transmissibility required for an outbreak to become a pandemic.
where hki and hk 2 i are the mean and variTc = (hk2hki
i−hki)
ance of the degree distribution of the contact network.
• Basic Reproduction Number R0 is the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in the population of susceptible individuals. It can be shown to be
equal to the ratio of transmissibility to the critical transmissibility R0 = T /Tc .
• The Instantaneous Reproduction Number R(t) =
R0 s(t)/N (t) where s(t) is the number of susceptible individuals at time t and N (t) is the total population.
Note that some studies refer to an effective reproductive number
Re . In the definitions above, R0 depends on the degree distribution so there is no need to make this distinction. R0 and Re
can be thought of as interchangeable terms.
2.1. Steady-State Disease Spread in Social Networks
Here we outline the procedure for characterizing steady-state
disease spread on complex networks using bond percolation.
The analysis is based on the work of Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani [1] and Newman [2, 3, 4, 5]. Generalizations to the theory
are made to include both uniform and directed social distancing.
Given the transmission rate ri,j between node i and node j
of a network graph and the infection time τ , the transmissibility
is:
T = 1 − (1 − ri,j δt)τ /δt → 1 − e−ri,j τ ,
(1)
as δt → 0. Typically, ri,j = r, where r and τ are independent
random variables. The average transmissibility is then:

where Pr (r) and Pτ (τ ) are the respective probability density
functions (pdfs). For simplicity, it is assumed that Pr (r) =
δ(r − r0 ) and Pτ (τ ) = δ(τ − τ0 ) so that T = 1 − e−r0 τ0 .
For a randomly chosen vertex, let pk denote the probability

proxy for an urban network and has a degree distribution of the
form:
pk = (1 − e−β )e−βk ,
(5)
with parameter β. The power-law (Barabási-Albert) network
has a majority of small degree links with a small minority of
large degree links representing super-spreaders and a degree distribution of the form:

An important result by Feld is that the degree distribution
of the first neighbor of a vertex is not the same as the degree
distribution of vertices as a whole [12]. There is a greater chance
that an edge will be connected to a vertex of high degree, in
fact, in direct proportion to its degree. Let qk denote the degree
distribution of a vertex at the end of a randomly chosen edge.
Then:
qk−1 = kpk /z,

The transmissibility along each edge is taken into account
by interpreting T in Eq. (2) as a probability (0 ≤ T ≤ 1).

where, similarly, G1 (x; T ) = G1 (1 − T + xT ).
2.1.1. Bond Percolation
Most complex networks experience phase transitions where
small components suddenly coalesce into a giant component
that extends across the entire network. The phase transitions of
water as a function of temperature and pressure are examples.
These regions can be described using mean-field theory and the
generating functions G0 (x) and G1 (x). In order to apply mean
field theory, it must be assumed that any finite component of
connected vertices has no closed loops [5]. It can be shown that
the probability of closed loops is on the order of O(1/n), where
n is the network size. As n → ∞, this means that all finite
components have a tree-like (branching) structure.
Small outbreaks (percolation clusters) can be characterized
as follows. Let H1 (x) denote the generating function of the size
distribution of the clusters at the end of the randomly chosen
edge. Referring to the diagram in Fig. 2, the aggregate size of a
cluster is the sum of all the clusters emanating from each vertex.
This is a correct interpretation because there are no closed loops.
For a vertex forming two clusters, the generating function of the
size distribution is H12 (x), since two i. i. d. clusters are summed
together.
Similarly, for a vertex forming n clusters, the generating
function of the size distribution is H1n (x). Therefore, in the
limit of large network size:
H1 (x) = x

where x pre-multiplying the above expression is the originating

clusters for a randomly chosen vertex, then:
H0 (x) = x

Equation (12) defines the bond percolation process and the analyses to follow.
2.1.2. Small Outbreaks
The critical transmissibility Tc leading to a pandemic (giant
component) can be determined by computing the average size
of small outbreaks (small components
with the
P s k not associated
s
pandemic). Since H0 (x; T ) = k pk x , where pk is the
P cluster
size probability, the average size of the cluster is hci = k kpsk =
0
0
H0 (1; T ) = H0 (1). Newman shows that [2]:

where G0 (1) = G1 (1) = 1. A phase transition occurs when
0
hci → ∞ or, from Eq. (13), when Tc = 1/G1 (1) which implies:

Tc = hki / k 2 − hki .
(14)
The basic reproduction number R0 can then be defined as R0 =
T /Tc , so R0 = 1 when T = Tc .

In addition to the average outbreak size hci, the distribution of outbreak sizes can also be determined in a computaP
tionally efficient manner. Recalling that H0 (x; T ) = k psk xk
and letting x = e2πjm/M , the outbreak size distribution pk is
equivalent to the inverse discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) of
H0 (e2pijm/M ; T ).
2.1.3. Pandemic Size
The size of the pandemic above the critical threshold Tc can
also be determined. However, the giant component spans the
entire network, so there have to be closed loops. This invalidates
the tree-like assumption that led to Eq. (12). As Newman points
out, the problem
P scan be approached indirectly [5]. Recall that
H0 (1; T ) = k pk is the fraction of components not in the giant component. This implies that P (T ) = 1 − H0 (1; T ) is the
probability of a pandemic forming. Defining v = H1 (1; T ) and
using Eq. (12):
v = G1 (v; T )
P = 1 − G0 (v; T ).

213
214
215
216

This is a fixed point problem. The average outbreak size not associated with the pandemic can also be determined. Repeating
the derivation leading to Eq. (13) and noting that H0 (1; T ) =
1 − P (T ), Newman shows that [3]:
hci = 1 +

(16)

The risk of an individual infection is determined by noting that v in Eq. (15) is the probability that a node along a
randomly chosen edge is not infected. For each edge, the probability of not getting infected is either v (contact not infected)
or (1 − T )(1 − v) (contact is infected but does not transmit the
infection). Thus, p(T ) = v + (1 − T )(1 − v) = 1 − T − vT . If
the individual has k contacts, then the risk of infection is [2]:
Risk(k; T ) = 1 − pk (T ).

224

2.1.4. Inclusion of NPIs
The known methodology outlined above is generalized to include social distancing. Specific applications including uniform
and directed social distancing are then discussed. Let bk denote
the probability that a vertex of degree k is present. Define the
generating function F0 (x) as:
F0 (x) =

bk p k x k .

Similarly, F1 (x) = F0 (x)/z. This is a generalization of the
generating functions G0 (x) and G1 (x). Since F0 (1) 6= 1 and
F1 (1) 6= 1, 1 − F0 (1) is the probability that a randomly chosen
vertex has no active edges. From Eq. (12), it follow that [3]:
H1 (x; T ) = 1 − F1 (1) + xF1 (H1 (x; T ); T )
H0 (x; T ) = 1 − F0 (1) + xF0 (H1 (x; T ); T ).

234
235

The average outbreak size prior to a pandemic with social
distancing is similar to Eq. (13):

hci = 1 + T F0 (1)/(1 − T F1 (1)).

(21)

The average outbreak size not associated with the pandemic is
analogous to Eq. (16) with G0 (x) and G1 (x) replaced by F0 (x)
and F1 (x), respectively. Noting that F0 (v; T ) = F0 (1) − P ,
0
F0 (v; T ) = zF1 (v; T ), and F1 (v; T ) = v − 1 + F1 (1):
hci =

248

(20)

A phase transition leading to a pandemic occurs at the criti0
cal transmissibility Tc = 1/F1 (1), which follows directly from
Eq. (20). Similarly, the outbreak size distribution follows directly from H0 (x; T ) by defining x = e2πjm/M and using the
inverse Fourier Transform.
The fraction of the population affected by the pandemic
is similar to Eq. (15). Since H0 (1; T ) = 1 − P (T ) and using
Eq. (19):
P = F0 (1) − F0 (v; T )
v = 1 − F1 (1) + F1 (v; T ).

(22)

The risk of an infection during a pandemic is identical to Eq. (17)
with v given by Eq. (21).
2.1.5. Uniform Social Distancing
Let bk = b; 0 ≤ b ≤ 1, so the probability that a vertex of
degree k is active is b. Basically, social distancing is applied
to every individual regardless of the number of contacts an individual may have. For this case, F0 (x; T ) = bG0 (x; T ) and
F1 (x; T ) = bG1 (x; T ). The average outbreak size prior to a pandemic is identical to Eq. (13) with T replaced by Teff = bT . This
implies that the critical threshold with uniform social distancing
0
is Tc = Tc /b. Since the basic reproduction number R0 = T /Tc ,

the effective reproduction number is R0 = T /Tc = bR0 . This
0
means that the effective reproduction number R0 decreases with
increased uniform social distancing. The outbreak size distribution similarly follows from Eq. (19).
The fraction of the population affected by the pandemic fol0
lows directly from Eq.(21). Letting v = (v −1+b)/b and noting

where Teff = bT . This is identical to Eq. (15) with no social
distancing except that the onset of the pandemic is shifted in

2.2. Time-dependent Disease Spread in Social Networks
In this section we expand the procedure to characterize timedependent disease spread on complex networks using a stochastic SIR model. The analysis is based on the work of Barthélémy
and Pastor-Satorras [7]. Generalizations to the theory are made
to include social distancing, testing, and contact tracing.
2.2.1. Introduction
A stochastic treatment of the time-dependent properties of
epidemic models involves determining the probabilities for vertices to be in specific disease states. This is typically a difficult problem because it involves higher-order moments of probabilities that can only be approximated using moment-closure

techniques, where moments are factored into pairwise moment
products [5]. An alternative approach is degree-based approximation pioneered by Pastor-Satorras et al. This approximation
assumes that all vertices of the same degree have the same probability of infection at any given time.
Consider the probability that vertex A becomes infected between times t and t + dt. To become infected, it must catch the
disease from one of its neighbors, which requires that the neighbor be infected. The probability of a neighbor being infected is
xk , where k is the excess degree of the neighbor (recall that the
excess degree distribution is qk ). So,Pthe average probability of
a neighbor being infected is v(t) = ∞
k=0 qk xk . The total probability of transmission from a single neighbor is βv(t)dt, where
β is the contact rate. The probability of transmission from any
neighbor is βkv(t)dt, where k is the number of neighbors associated with vertex A. Thus, the rate of change in the probability
that a vertex with degree k is susceptible (sk ) is simply:
dsk /dt = −βkv(t)sk .

327
328

329
330

Similarly, the probability that a vertex with degree k is infected
(xk ) is:
dxk /dt = βkv(t)sk − γxk ,
(33)
where γ = 1/Tr is the recovery rate. Finally, the probability
that a vertex of degree k has recovered (rk ) is:
drk /dt = γxk .

331

333
334
335

(34)

A general solution to Eqs. (32)-(34) is of the form [5]:
du/dt = −βuv(t)
v(t) = 1 + (γ/β) log(u) − s0 G1 (u),

332

(32)

(35)

where s0 = sk (0). Given u(0) = 1, Eq. (35) can be numerically
solved for u(t) and the average probability of infection v(t) can
be determined. In addition, the average susceptibility probability s(t) can be computed from the degree distribution of a
randomly chosen vertex:
s(t) =

∞

pk sk = s0 G0 (u),

k=0

is the average recovery probability. Assuming β/γ  1, the
transmissibility is approximately T ≈ β/γ. If u = 1 − T +
T v, then Eq. (15) and Eq. (37) are identical under the above
assumptions. Therefore, the dynamic SIR model is consistent
with bond percolation results at steady state.
2.2.2. Uniform Social Distancing
It is assumed that no NPIs are active over a period 0 ≤
t ≤ t1 . Over a period t1 < t ≤ t2 , uniform social distancing
is implemented where a fraction (1 − b) of the population is
sequestered. Over the period t2 < t ≤ t3 , the NPI is lifted. The
first period corresponds to the analysis outlined in the previous
section.
For the second period that includes social distancing, the
stochastic SIR equations for the fraction of the population (b)
not sequestered are:

The total average infection probability vT (t) needs to include
the sequestered fraction (1 − b) of the population. However, the
average infection probability among the sequestered population
is vs0 = (1 − b)v(t1 ), where v(t1 ) is determined from Eq. (35). In
particular:
vs0 = (1 − b) (1 + (γ/β) log(u0 ) − s0 G1 (u1 )) ,

γ since, by definition, they are not in contact with each other.
So:

vT (t) = v (t) + vs0 e−γ(t−t1 ) ; t1 < t ≤ t2 .
(43)
Note that at t = t1 , vT (t1 ) = v(t1 ), so continuity is maintained.
Finally, the fractional number of susceptibles during the NPI
period is the sum of the sequestered and non-sequestered fraction of the population:
s(t) = bs0 G0 (uu1 ) + (1 − b)s0 G0 (u1 ).

that the initial conditions are different. Let nk denote the fraction of the population with k contacts remaining. However,

2.2.3. Testing and Contact Tracing
For periods t > t3 , a fairly simple model is used to capture
the relevant details of delayed testing and contact tracing based
on a generalization of work by Young and Ruschel [13]. The
modified stochastic SIR model is:
000

dsk /dt = −βkv (t)sk
000
000
dxk /dt = βkv (t)sk − βkpe−γη v (t − η)sk (t − η) − γxk(49)

(50)

where η is the delay
Pin testing after becoming infectious and,
000
as before, v (t) = k qk xk . Rather than assuming that infectious individuals are tested, tracked and sequestered immediately with probability p, there is a delay η in their sequestration.
Recovered individuals are not added back into the pool of susceptible individuals since it is assumed that they have developed
immunity to the disease.
A general solution to Eq. (50) can be determined as follows.
Integrating the first expression produces sk (t) = ŝk3 uk , where:

ŝk3 = bsk3 + (1 − b)sk2 , sk3 = sk2 uk3 , and u3 = u(t3 ). From

du/dt = −βuv (t).

2.3. Bayesian-based Estimation of Contact Transmissibility
We now outline methods for estimating the contact transmissibility from outbreak case data using a stochastic SIR model
and Bayesian estimation methods. The first approach estimates
the average transmissibility T or basic reproduction number R0
using either analytical or empirical networks where the degree
distribution is known or estimated. The second approach estimates the instantaneous transmissibility T (t) or basic reproduction number R0 (t) using nonlinear tracking methods based on
particle-based filtering where explicit network structure is not
required.
2.3.1. Average Transmissibility
The probability that a vertex of degree k will experience
an outbreak is the probability that it gets infected and then
recovers. From Eq. (33):
dck /t = dxk /dt + drk /dt = βkv(t)sk .

433
434

(57)

The average outbreak case probability C(t) is determined by
averaging Eq. (57):
0

435
436
437

(58)
dC(t)/dt = βv(t)u(t)G0 (u(t)) ,
P
0
where u(t) is given by Eq. (35) and k pk ks0 uk = s0 u(t)G0 (u).
Define ∆C(t + ξ) = C(t + ξ) − C(t) as the fractional change
in outbreak cases in the interval [t, t + ξ]. Then, from Eq. (58):
0

∆C(t + ξ) ≈ βξs0 u(t)G0 (u(t)) v(t + ξ).
438
439

Now, returning to Eq. (33), averaging, and integrating the results from t to t + ξ, assuming that ξ  1:
v(t + ξ) ≈ v(t)bξ (t; T ),

440
441

443
444
445
446

(60)


0
where bξ (t; T ) = exp γξ(s0 T u(t)G1 (u(t)) − 1) and T = β/γ.
Finally, substituting this expression into Eq. (59):
∆C(t + ξ) = ∆C(t)bξ (t; T ).

442

(59)

(61)

This implies a linear relationship between the fractional change
in outbreak cases between time steps ξ.
The change in the number of outbreak cases ∆N (t) is ∆N (t) =
N C(t), where N is the population size. Assume that ∆N (t) is
integer-valued and let the measurements comprise the collection

{∆N1 , ∆N2 , . . . , ∆NJ }, where ∆Ni = ∆N (ti ). The resulting
likelihood function can be factored as:
p(∆N1 , ∆N2 , . . . , ∆NJ |T ) =

Y

p(∆Nn |∆N(n−1) ; T ),

(62)

n=1
449
450
451

where ∆Nn = [∆N1 , ∆N2 , . . . , ∆Nn ]. This equation can be
simplified by noting that ∆Ni+1 = bξ (ti ; T )∆Ni , so ∆Ni defines
a Markov process. Therefore:
p(∆N1 , ∆N2 , . . . , ∆NJ |T ) =

J
Y

p(∆Nn |∆Nn−1 ; T ),

(63)

n=1
452
453
454
455
456

where p(∆N1 |∆N0 ; T ) = p(∆N1 ).
In general, p(∆Nn |∆Nn−1 ; T ) is not known. Bettencourt
points out that the maximum entropy density is the preferred
density when only the mean is known [10]. This turns out to be
the Poisson density:
n −λn−1
p(∆Nn |∆Nn−1 ; T ) = λ∆N
/(∆Nn )!,
n−1 e

457
458
459

where λn = bξ (tn ; T )∆Nn . Taking the logarithm of Eq. (63), using Eq. (64), and eliminating terms independent of T , − log p(∆Nn |∆Nn−1 ; T )
is proportional to:
Φ(∆N1 , ∆N2 , . . . , ∆NJ |T ) =

(65)
A maximum likelihood estimate of the transmissibility T or basic reproduction number R0 is equivalent to finding a T such
that Φ(∆N1 , ∆N2 , . . . , ∆NJ |T ) is minimized.
Although a Poisson density is used in deriving the conditional likelihood function in Eq. (64), it has been observed
that the number of differential outbreak cases ∆N (ti ) is overdispersive, i.e., the variances are larger than expected. It can be
shown that Consul’s generalized Poisson distribution is a better
match to the data. This density has the form [14]:
p(n) = (1 − ω)λ ((1 − ω)λ + ωn)n−1 exp (−(1 − ω)λ − ωn) /n!,
(66)
where 0 ≤ ω < 1 is the dispersion parameter and λ is the mean.
Euler’s difference
P formula can be used to show that p(n) is a
valid density ( n p(n) = 1).

2.3.2. Estimating Instantaneous Transmissibility
Define the instantaneous basic reproduction number R0 (t)
0
as R0 (t) = T u(t)G1 (u(t)), which follows from Eq. (60), so that
bξ (t; T ) = exp (γξ(R(t) − 1)). This equation has the advantage of being network independent. Now, consider the vector
of estimates: RJ = [R( t1 ), R(t2 ), . . . , R(tJ )] and the vector of
measurements ∆NJ , where ∆NJ = [∆N1 , ∆N2 , . . . , ∆NJ ]. The
goal is to estimate the posterior density p(RJ |∆NJ ). Because
the likelihood function is a nonlinear function of R0 , a linear
Kalman filter cannot be used. In fact, an extended Kalman
filter is not robust enough to handle the rapid fluctuations in
the differential outbreak case histories. Therefore, a Bayesian
approach is used where the posterior probability density of the
state is constructed from the data. However, this density may
be difficult to evaluate using kernel or grid-based estimation procedures. Therefore, the density is approximated using sampling
procedures.
In order to illustrate the procedure, the following simple
problem is considered. Suppose one is required to evaluate the
Nth moment of p(x|z):
Z
N
x |z = xN p(x|z) dx.
(67)
Assume a proposal density q(x|z) that is relatively easy to sample from.P
These samples are denoted by xi ∼ q(x|z) such that
(i)
q(x|z) = M
i=1 δ(x−x )/M , where δ(x) is the Dirac delta function. Equation (67) can be rewritten as:
N

x |z =

N
X

x(i) w̃i ,

i=1
496
497
498

P
where w̃i = wi / i wi and wi = p(x(i) |z)/q(x(i) |z). Therefore,
the Nth moment can be approximated by weighting samples x(i)
from a proposal density q(x|z) by a set of importance weights
w̃i .
The same procedure can be used to estimate the posterior
density. In this case wi = p(RJ(i) |∆NJ )/q(RJ(i) |∆NJ ) for a
suitably chosen proposal density q(RJ |∆NJ ). Now, using Bayes
theorem:
p(RJ |∆NJ )=

3.1. Steady-State Disease Spread
Some illustrative results using the steady-state disease spread
model are described below for three types of contact networks:
Poisson, Exponential, and Power-law. For these examples, the
critical transmissibility is Tc = 0.049. This means that if the
observed transmissibility T = Tc , then R0 = 1, i.e., Tc is the
critical value above which the pandemic is self-sustaining. For
comparative purposes, each contact network has the same critical threshold Tc .
Fig. 3 depicts the outbreak distribution size prior to a pandemic when R0 = 0.8 with no NPIs. This is the predicted
number of people infected by a small outbreak. Both the Poisson and exponential (urban) contact networks have similar size
distributions, where large outbreak sizes (> 20) are unlikely.
The power-law contact network is highly peaked for small outbreak sizes as expected. Although diminishingly small for larger
outbreak sizes, it is not zero because there are a minority of
super-spreaders with large contact degree. Fig. 4 depicts the
fraction of the population affected by a pandemic as a function of the basic reproduction number R0 when R0 > 1 with
no NPIs. Communities have diverse experiences based on their
contact patterns. The Poisson contact network has the greatest fraction of the population affected by a pandemic because
individuals in a group are equally likely to become infected and
to infect others. For an exponential (urban) contact network,
there is a 50% reduction in the number of infected individuals compared to a well-mixed population (40% versus 80%) for
R0 = 2. For a power-law network, only 5% of the population is
affected by the pandemic for R0 = 2. Therefore, outbreaks are
consistently less likely to reach pandemic proportions.
There are outbreaks that can occur outside the main pandemic cluster, although they are relatively small. This is not
predicted from SIR or Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, or Recovered (SEIR) models. Fig. 5 shows the average number of
people infected by outbreaks outside the main pandemic cluster. This average outbreak size can be determined as a function
of R0 for the three contact networks. For R0 > 2 all three
contact networks have low average outbreak sizes (less than 2)

outside the main pandemic cluster. As expected, there are more
outbreaks near R0 = 1 because less of the population is affected
by the main pandemic and there is more opportunity for infections to spread outside the main pandemic cluster. Note that
the power-law network has a larger outbreak size for larger R0
because there are a minority of super-spreaders. Fig. 6 illustrates the individual risk of infection when R0 = 2 based on
the number of social contacts. The Poisson contact network
shows the most risk of individual infection. For ten contacts,
the risk of infection is approximately 55%. The exponential
(urban) network shows an individual infection risk of approximately 45% for ten contacts. The power-law contact network
shows the smallest individual risk of infection, roughly 20% for
ten contacts.
For uniform social distancing, it is assumed that the prob-

ability that a vertex of degree k is active is bk = b, where
0
0 ≤ b ≤ 1, so pk = bk pk . Basically, social distancing is applied to every individual regardless of the number of contacts
an individual may have. Fig. 7 depicts the fraction of the population affected by a pandemic as a function of R0 for different
degrees of uniform social distancing for three types of networks.
Uniform social distancing has the effect of shifting the onset of a
pandemic to larger effective R0 values. This is because the effective critical transmissibility threshold Tceff is now greater than
the baseline critical threshold Tc before intervention is imposed.
Asymptotic results for the Poisson network are consistent with
SIR/SEIR compartmental model results. In each case, the fraction of the affected population is reduced exactly by the amount
of imposed social distancing. The exponential network shows

similar trends although its asymptotic values are smaller than
the Poisson network because the population is not well-mixed.
The power-law network shows little variation in its pandemic
onset or its peak (at R0 = 6) for a 20% increase in social distancing from the baseline. Even at 40% social distancing, the
percent affected population is only somewhat reduced, although
its pandemic onset is shifted to a larger R0 value. As explained
previously, this is due to a minority of super-spreaders that add
a degree of robustness to the network

For directed social distancing, it is assumed that bk = 1 for
0 ≤ k ≤ Kmax and bk = 0, otherwise. Basically, all individuals with contact degree greater than Kmax are distanced. Note
that Kmax is relatedPto the fractional number fc of nodes remax
moved, or fc = 1 − K
k=0 pk . Fig. 8 illustrates the fraction of
the population affected by a pandemic as a function of R0 for
different degrees of directed social distancing for three types of
networks. Directed social distancing has a large effect on the
onset of a pandemic for both the exponential and power-law
contact networks. For a 10% reduction in social distancing for

high social contact individuals, the affected population is reduced from 75% to 50% for an exponential network and 30%
to zero for a power-law network when R0 = 6. The affected
population for a Poisson network is reduced by only 10%. Although not depicted in this figure, it can be shown that for
a 1.5% reduction in directed social distancing, there is a 25%
reduction in the affected population for a power-law network
when R0 = 6. For a 2% reduction in directed social distancing,
none of the population is affected for R0 ≤ 6. However, the exponential network shows only a 5% reduction and the Poisson
network shows only a 2% reduction in the affected population,
respectively. The power-law network is the least robust to the
removal of high contact nodes. This is an important result that
could impact the way contact tracing is performed.

period Tr is 7 days, the inception and release of (uniform) social
distancing starts at week 6 and ends at week 14, respectively,
and testing and contact tracing begins at week 16. Additionally,
80% of individuals are social distanced, the percent isolated per
week is 20%, and the percent traced per week is 30% per week.
Figures 9 and 10 depict the susceptible, infectious, and outbreak case load probabilities for a Poisson and exponential network, respectively, for the example parameters outlined above.
The pandemic begins to build after week 2 and is arrested starting at week 6 as a result of social distancing. Social distancing is
relaxed at week 14 with a consequent buildup in infections until testing and contact tracing are initiated at week 16. There
is a large decline in the susceptible probability due to contact
tracing around week 20. Since testing and contract tracing is
assumed to continue over the model run (50 weeks), the outbreak case load reaches a steady state. Contrasting the differences between the Poisson and exponential networks, it is
apparent that the number of outbreak cases is smaller for the
exponential network and remediation strategies such as social
distancing, testing, and contact tracing are more effective for
the exponential network. Recall that this network does not assume a well-mixed population where all individuals are equally
likely to become infected. The power-law network (not shown)
has an even smaller number of outbreak cases.

Fig. 11 depicts the instantaneous basic reproduction number
R0 for three contact networks as a function of time for the NPI,
testing, and contact tracing example outlined above. The inception and lifting of social distancing protocols are clearly evident,
where R0 is sizeably reduced over a period of 2 months. Note
that for all three networks, 0.3 ≤ R0 ≤ 0.4 over this interval of
time. When the NPI is lifted at week 14, sheltered individuals
are added back into the reservoir with a subsequent increase in
R0 . This pool slowly attrits from infections until week 16 when
testing and contact tracing is initiated. A combination of testing and contact tracing lowers R0 to below unity near week 20,
at which point, the disease ceases to spread. It is interesting to
note that the power-law network has consistently lower R0 values except during testing and contact tracing. This is because
the rather low rates of testing and tracking miss a number of
super-spreaders that are more prevalent in a power-law network.

3.3. Bayesian-based Estimation of Contact Transmissibility
Some illustrative results using the Bayesian-based estimation procedure for contact transmissibility are discussed below.
Figures 12 and 13 illustrate particular examples of the approach
for Massachusetts and New York given collected outbreak case
histories from each state over a 2-3 month period starting in
February 2020. It is assumed that the critical transmissibility
Tc = 0.049 and the infection period Tr = 7 days. The models that best fit the data are used for each state – a Poisson

network for Massachusetts and an exponential network for New
York. The estimated transmissibility for Massachusetts is 0.089,
which translates into a R0 value of 1.8. Similarly, the estimated
transmissibility for New York is 0.185, which translates into a
R0 value of 3.8. Both networks provide reasonable fits to their
respective observed differential outbreak case histories ∆C(t)
and reinforces the notion that the rapidity of disease spread in
New York was much more severe.

history. The fit to the observed differential outbreak case data
∆C(t) is quite good. In addition, the instantaneous R0 (t) values
are consistent with the average R0 value using an exponential
network model depicted in Fig. 13. However, Fig. 15 is more
illustrative because it allows one to examine the trend in R0
over the progression of the pandemic. In this case, there is
a downward trend after reaching a peak of approximately 3.5.
There is also an up tick in R0 at later times probability due to
an increase in testing. Note that estimation errors may result
in negative R(t) values that are not realistic.

4. Conclusion

736

In the present work, we developed and illustrated a coarsegrain analytic modeling procedure that can be used to assess
alternative strategies of implementing and subsequently lifting
non-pharmaceutical interventions in response to the COVID19 pandemic. This work was based on developing a multidimensional view of the problem by examining steady-state and
dynamic disease spread using a network-based approach. The
steady-state models, based on percolation theory, highlighted
the previously known result that social contact structure is a
key factor in the size of an outbreak. In addition, it was shown
that the social contact structure influences the types of social
distancing protocols that are deemed most effective. The dynamic models, based on a stochastic reformulation of the SIR
equations, further extended the work to include the effects of
lifting non-pharmaceutical interventions and the importance of
testing and contact tracing in reducing the overall infection rate.
Providing a realistic assessment of the basic reproduction number R0 is also important in gauging the severity of the outbreak
within a specific geographic area. A Bayesian-based estimation procedure was developed to estimate both the average and
instantaneous basic reproduction number from outbreak case
histories at a state and county-wide level. These estimates can
be used to seed other models or analysis procedures.
No single model is a panacea. Therefore, we advocate an
ensemble modeling approach based on a combination of analytic
and fine-grain agent-based models (ABMs). As outlined in a
companion paper, this approach has the potential to provide
valuable insights into disease spread and the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions. It could prove to be a valuable
tool for decision-makers in conjunction with empirical analysis.
