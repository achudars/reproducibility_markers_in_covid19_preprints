Abstract

36 The COVID-19 pandemic has presented multiple healthcare challenges, one of which is
37 adequately meeting the need for large-scale diagnostic testing. The most commonly used
38 assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2, including those recommended by the Center for Disease
39 Control and Prevention (CDC), rely on a consistent set of core reagents. This has put a serious
40 strain on the reagent supply chain, resulting in insufficient testing. It has also led to restricted
41 animal testing, even though there are now multiple reports of animals, particularly cats, ferrets
42 and minks, contracting the disease. We aimed to address the diagnostic bottleneck by
43 developing a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection assay for cats (and, potentially, other animals)
44 which avoids the use of most common reagents, such as collection kits optimized for RNA
45 stabilization, RNA isolation kits and TaqMan-based RT-PCR reagents. We demonstrated that an
46 inexpensive solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) method can be used for RNA
47 extraction from feline samples collected with DNAGenotek’s ORAcollect RNA OR-100 and
48 PERFORMAgene DNA PG-100 sample collection kits, optimized for RNA or DNA stabilization,
49 respectively. We developed a dual method SARS-CoV-2 detection assay relying on SYBR
50 RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing, using the same set of custom synthesized oligo primers. We
51 validated our test’s specificity with a commercially available SARS-CoV-2 plasmid positive
52 control, as well as two in-house positive control RNA samples. Our assay’s sensitivity was
53 determined to be 10 viral copies per reaction. Our results suggest that a simple
54 SPRI-dependent RNA extraction protocol and certain sample collection kits not specifically
55 optimized for RNA stabilization could potentially be used in cases where reagent shortages are
56 hindering adequate COVID-19 testing. These ‘alternative’ reagents could be used in
57 combination with our COVID-19 testing method, which relies on inexpensive and readily
58 available SYBR RT-PCR and non-fluorescent PCR reagents. Depending on the detection goals
59 and the laboratory setup available, the SYBR RT-PCR method and the Sanger sequencing
60 based method can be used alone or in conjunction, for improved accuracy. Although the test is
61 intended for animal use, it is, in theory, possible to use it with human samples, especially those
62 with higher viral loads.

Introduction

70 The COVID-19 pandemic has put an unprecedented strain on almost every country’s healthcare
71 system. In addition to insufficient hospital beds and personal protective equipment for
72 healthcare workers, this pandemic has also been marked by a shortage of COVID-19 diagnostic
73 testing. The most frequently used assay type, the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, relies on the same set
74 of preferred core reagents. For this type of test, the CDC recommends the use of commercially
75 available RNA isolation kits and RT-PCR reagents designed for use with an oligo probe (i.e., the
76 TaqMan approach)1. This has led to multiple reports of RNA isolation kit shortages2, slowing
77 down testing efforts at a time when testing speed is crucial. In addition, from our own internal
78 observations, many TaqMan-based RT-PCR reagents, as well as nasopharyngeal and
79 oropharyngeal swab kits optimized for RNA stabilization, were backordered and/or experienced
80 a price increase at some point during the pandemic. These supply chain bottlenecks have also
81 led to very sparse testing of animals suspected to have COVID-19, despite the fact that there
82 has been strong research evidence indicating that animals (particularly cats, ferrets and minks)
83 can contract and spread COVID-19 to other animals3,4,5. Even with limited testing, there are
84 currently over 60 reported COVID-19 positive animal cases in the US alone, as catalogued by
85 the United States Department of Agriculture6. Recently, COVID-19 diagnostic tests designed
86 specifically for animal use were made available for clinical use only7. However, these tests still
87 rely on the same set of core reagents and, therefore, do little to address or circumvent reagent
88 shortages. To address this issue, we developed a SARS-CoV-2 PCR-based test for use in cats
89 (and potentially other animals) that does not rely on the reagents most typically used in
90 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests. Our assay can be used with a sample collection kit optimized for
91 DNA stabilization or RNA stabilization and does not use commercial RNA extraction kits or
92 TaqMan based RT-PCR reagents. Our test

is comprised of two different workflows - SYBR

93 RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. These can be used together or separately, depending on the
94 available reagents and lab setup. The availability of such a test would be important for
95 improving our understanding of the spread and impact of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in animals.

103 available from DNAGenotek), optimized for RNA and DNA stabilization, respectively. We then
104 extracted total RNA from each of these samples using a published method for purifying nucleic
105 acids by solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI)8, which does not rely on a commercial kit.
106 Gel electrophoresis indicated that we were successful in extracting total RNA from each of the
107 two samples (Figure 1A). Quantification of the extracted RNA suggested that our extraction
108 protocol yielded higher quantities of RNA from the sample collected with the PERFORMAgene
109 DNA PG-100, compared to the sample collected with the ORAcollect RNA OR-100 (Figure 1B).
110 RNA purity was quantified by absorbance measurements taken at 260/280 nm and 260/230 nm.
111 Our data suggest that the RNA extracted from the ORAcollect RNA OR-100, although lower
112 quantity, is of better quality. However, the best indicator of RNA quality is, ultimately, its
113 functionality in a particular application of interest. We wanted to investigate whether the RNA
114 extracted from the PERFORMAgene DNA PG-100 sample contained feline mRNA and viral
115 RNA. We successfully detected two housekeeping genes (GAPDH and RSP19) in each of the
116 two samples, although RSP19 was of a lower quantity in the RNA extracted from the
117 PERFORMAgene DNA PG-100 sample compared to the RNA extracted from the ORAcollect
118 RNA OR-100 sample (Figure 1C). Therefore, while both collection kits allowed successful
119 extraction of feline mRNA from an oropharyngeal sample, our results indicate that some feline
120 mRNAs might have different abundance between the two collection kits.
121
122 We next tested whether the total RNA extracted from the PERFORMAgene DNA PG-100
123 sample contained viral sequences. We prepared an RNA-seq library from the extracted RNA
124 and ran the sequencing results through a microbial sequence classifier to identify 33 viral
125 genomes, at least 9 of which had RNA genomes (Table 1). Surprisingly, despite the DNAse
126 treatment step in the RNA-seq library preparation process, we still detected some viruses with
127 DNA genomes in the sample.
128
129 Our results suggest that the PERFORMAgene DNA PG-100 sample collection kit has the
130 potential to be used for preservation of both host mRNA and viral RNA. This makes it a tool that
131 merits further investigation in a SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing setting, especially in situations
132 where collection kits optimized for RNA stabilization are in short supply.

136 In an attempt to avoid using TaqMan RT-PCR reagents for SARS-CoV-2 detection, we tested
137 whether a combination of SYBR RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing could deliver reliable
138 detection of the virus. We designed oligo primers amplifying a 328 bp sequence in the N gene
139 region of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and looked at the conservation between the homologous
140 target regions of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and the Feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) (Figure
141 2). The FECV sequence is sufficiently divergent as to not present a threat for viral
142 cross-detection. SARS-CoV, however, shares high homology with SARS-CoV-2 and our primer
143 pair would work equally well for amplifying either of the two viral sequences. Therefore, the
144 SYBR RT-PCR part of our assay, when used in isolation, cannot distinguish between the two
145 viruses. The Sanger sequencing component of our test, on the other hand, can clearly
146 distinguish between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 due to the single nucleotide resolution that it
147 provides (Figure 3).
148
149 We tested the above primers in our SYBR RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing protocols (Figure
150 4). We used a plasmid containing the N gene region as a spike-in synthetic positive control in
151 the feline cDNA used in our PCR reactions. Gel electrophoresis showed a clear and specific
152 amplification signal of the expected size (328 bp) in the positive control samples when the
153 reaction was spiked-in with 1000 or 500 viral copies, respectively (Figure 4A). When we
154 performed Sanger sequencing on the product from these reactions, we observed a 100%
155 concordance between the published SARS-CoV-2 viral sequence (GenBank: MT072688.1) and
156 our PCR products (Figure 4B). Next, we examined our test’s sensitivity using SYBR RT-PCR
157 (Figure 4C). Results showed that our assay’s limit for reliable detection is 10 viral copies per
158 reaction. We used a Cq value of 35 cycles as the cut off for reliable detection. We observed that
159 we could not reliably and reproducibly detect 1 or fewer viral copies per reaction. This suggests
160 that our test would work best on samples with higher viral loads and might, in theory, miss cases
161 where the disease is at its initial stage and the viral load is still relatively low.
162
163 We next tested our assay with two in-house RNA positive control samples obtained from an
164 anonymous source. Each of them had a known concentration of 100 viral copies per reaction.
165 We transcribed cDNA from these samples and ran our conventional PCR assay in order to
166 perform Sanger sequencing on the resultant products. We observed a 100% concordance
167 between the SARS-CoV-2 positive samples’ viral sequences and the published SARS-CoV-2
168 viral genome sequence (Figure 5). While preliminary, these results suggest that our assay

169 could be used in a real-world scenario to identify SARS-CoV-2 positive feline and, potentially,
170 human patients.

172

Discussion

173 We developed a dual method PCR based test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in cats that does
174 not rely on commonly used reagents and can, therefore, be used without significantly impacting
175 the already strained COVID-19 testing reagent supply chain. Our assay is versatile and can be
176 adapted to different laboratory setups and available reagents. While our test can be used with
177 oropharyngeal collection kits designed specifically for RNA storage and stabilization, we
178 demonstrated that some collection kits optimized for DNA preservation, such as the
179 PERFORMAgene DNA PG-100 by DNAGenotek, have the potential to be used to collect and
180 preserve feline and viral RNA. In addition, we demonstrated that an inexpensive, previously
181 published8, SPRI beads-based RNA extraction method can be used for the successful
182 extraction of total RNA from feline samples collected with ORAcollect RNA OR-100 (optimized
183 for RNA stabilization) or PERFORMAgene DNA PG-100. One potential caveat is that, since
184 long-term RNA preservation with the PERFORMAgene DNA PG-100 was not tested, samples
185 collected in this manner should probably undergo rapid processing (within 24 hours) in order to
186 maximize chances of successful viral detection.
187
188 During the COVID-19 pandemic,

RT-PCR machines and TaqMan probe-based RT-PCR

189 reagents can be costly and in short supply. As an alternative, we developed an assay that relies
190 on SYBR RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. Each of those two methodologies can be used in
191 isolation, depending on preference and the purpose of testing. If the test is used in COVID-19
192 outbreak areas, the quicker SYBR RT-PCR version can be employed (results within 1 day),
193 which does not distinguish between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The rationale in such a
194 scenario is that it is highly unlikely for SARS-CoV to be present in a COVID-19 affected area.
195 For a more definitive answer where a clear distinction between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is
196 required, the Sanger sequencing version of our assay should be used alone or in combination
197 with the SYBR RT-PCR (results within 2 days).
198
199 Our test’s sensitivity is 10 viral copies per reaction. Human patients’ SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in
200 nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples typically vary between 1.9 and 8 log10 RNA
201 copies/ml9, which corresponds to a range between 0.395 and >5000 viral copies per reaction
202 volume as defined in our assay. While not much data is available on the comparative viral loads

203 in COVID-19 positive animal patients, these results suggest that our test is likely more suitable
204 for animals that are symptomatic and are thus expected to have a higher viral load.
205
206 Although more studies are needed, our test could, in theory, be employed in human COVID-19
207 screening. The incorporation of Sanger sequencing in our assay has one significant advantage
208 over RT-PCR diagnostics - single nucleotide resolution. This property could be exploited to
209 catalog SARS-CoV-2 positive samples and look for strain-specific mutations in the N gene. This
210 will allow a more accurate strain-level classification of positive cases without resorting to the
211 much slower and more expensive whole viral genome sequencing. Using our method, different
212 mutation hotspot regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome can be targeted for amplification to better
213 understand strain diversity and penetration in different populations.

Materials and methods

216
217 Oropharyngeal swab collection
218 We tested two buccal swab collection kits - ORAcollect RNA OR-100 and PERFORMAgene
219 DNA PG-100, both available from DNAGenotek. While neither kit is designed specifically for
220 oropharyngeal sample collection, we found it relatively straightforward to use either of them to
221 collect an oropharyngeal swab sample from a cat. Samples were collected in the same sitting,
222 from the same cat, with both collection kits. The cat had not had anything to eat or drink for an
223 hour prior to sample collection.
224
225 RNA extraction
226 We used a previously described method for purifying nucleic acids by solid-phase reversible
227 immobilization (SPRI)8,10, with some protocol variations. The following is a brief protocol outline.
228 First, each sample was heated at 55°C for 1 hour. The sample collected with the ORAcollect
229 RNA OR-100 kit was then heated for 10 min at 90°C and the pH was adjusted to neutral, as per
230 manufacturer’s instructions. This step was omitted for the sample collected with the
231 PERFORMAgene DNA PG-100. Next, 2X volume of SPRI beads mix (Magnetic Beads
232 Carboxylate MBC-200 from MCLAB) was added to each sample, mixed and incubated for 5 min
233 prior to bead immobilization with a magnet. The bead pellet was washed twice with 80% freshly
234 prepared ethanol and the RNA was eluted in 1XTE. Each sample was then treated with DNAse.
235 EDTA, 3M Sodium acetate (pH 5.5) and 100% ethanol were used for RNA precipitation for 30
236 min at -20°C. Samples were then pelleted, washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in 1XTE.

237
238 cDNA synthesis
239 We used the iScript Select cDNA Synthesis Kit (1708896) from BioRad and followed
240 manufacturer’s instructions.
241
242 Custom primers
243 We designed the following primer pair amplifying 328 bp of the N region of the SARS-CoV-2
244 genome:
245 COVID_FP: CAACTGAGGGAGCCTTGAATAC
246 COVID_RP: CCTTGTTGTTGTTGGCCTTTAC
247
248 RT-PCR
249 We used AppliedBiosystems’ PowerUp™ SYBR™ Green Master Mix (A25742) and followed
250 manufacturer’s instructions for setting up 10 μl reactions. All consumables and pipettes were
251 placed in a UV hood for 10 minutes prior to reaction setup. The RT-PCR program used was as
252 follows: 1 X 2 min at 50°C, 1 X 2 min at 95°C, 50 X (15 sec at 95°C, 15 sec at 60°C, 1 min at
253 72°C). Reactions were performed in triplicate. Cat kidney total RNA (Zyagen) was used as a
254 positive control in the RT-PCR experiments assessing the presence of feline housekeeping
255 genes in the extracted RNA. The 2019-nCoV_N_Positive control #10006625 (IDT) was used as
256 a spike-in control in RT-PCR reactions.
257
258 RNA-seq
259 The KAPA RNA HyperPrep Kit with RiboErase (08098131702) was used for preparation of
260 RNA-seq libraries. Manufacturer’s instructions were followed.

338 Figure 1. Yield and quality of RNA extracted from a feline oropharyngeal swab sample
339 collected with the ORAcollect RNA OR-100 (RNA swab) and the PERFORMAgene DNA
340 PG-100 (DNA swab). (A) Gel electrophoresis comparing the total RNA extracted from each
341 sample collection kit. The M lane contains a nucleic acid size marker. (B) Measures of RNA
342 amount and purity using ThermoFisher Scientific NanoDrop and Promega Quantus
343 spectrophotometers. (C) RT-PCR results quantifying the expression of two housekeeping genes
344 (GAPDH and RSP19) in the RNA extracted from each kit.
345
346 Table 1. High, medium and low abundance viral sequences detected in the RNA extracted
347 from the PERFORMAgene DNA PG-100 sample. Viruses with known RNA based genomes
348 are marked in orange.
349
350 Figure 2. Sequence alignment between the SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and FECV viral
351 genomes, focusing on the corresponding region targeted for amplification in our assay.
352 (A) Nucleotide alignment between the 3 viruses, with the primers used in our assay shown in
353 color; red indicates nucleotides that are the same between all three viruses and green indicates
354 nucleotides shared only between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. (B) Protein alignment of the
355 whole 328 bp region targeted for amplification in our assay; color code is the same as in (A).
356
357 Figure 3. Top 3 results when (A) the SARS-CoV-2 or (B) the SARS-CoV region targeted for
358 amplification by our primers is used as input into NCBI’s BLASTp tool.
359
360 Figure 4. Specificity and sensitivity of a dual SARS-CoV-2 detection method relying on
361 SYBR RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. (A) Gel electrophoresis with PCR results from titrated
362 positive and negative control samples using a primer pair amplifying a 328 bp region of the
363 SARS-CoV-2 genome. (B) Nucleotide alignment between the published N gene SARS-CoV-2
364 sequence (Query) and a Sanger sequenced PCR product from the experiment in (A) marked as
365 (Sbjct). (C) SYBR RT-PCR testing the sensitivity of the assay to different SARS-CoV-2 viral
366 loads. Feline cDNA was spiked-in with titrated amounts of SARS-CoV-2 positive control
367 plasmid. The red dashed line indicates the limit of reliable and reproducible detection.
368
369 Figure 5. Nucleotide alignment between the published N gene SARS-CoV-2 sequence
370 (Sbjct) and Sanger sequenced PCR products generated with our assay’s primers using
371 two SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive control samples (A,B). The Sanger sequenced PCR products
372 are marked as ‘Query’.
