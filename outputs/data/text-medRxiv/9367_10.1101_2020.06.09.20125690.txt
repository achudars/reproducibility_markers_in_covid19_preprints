Brief Summary
COVID-19 is one of the most consequential pandemics in the last century, yet the biological mechanisms
that confer disease risk are incompletely understood. Further, heterogeneity in disease outcomes is
influenced by race, though the relative contributions of structural/social and genetic factors remain
unclear.1,2 Very recent unpublished work has identified two genetic risk loci that confer greater risk for
respiratory failure in COVID-19: the ABO locus and the 3p21.31 locus.3 To understand how these loci
might confer risk and whether this differs by race, we utilized proteomic profiling and genetic information
from three cohorts including black and white participants to identify proteins influenced by these loci. We
observed that variants in the ABO locus are associated with levels of CD209/DC-SIGN, a known binding
protein for SARS-CoV and other viruses,4 as well as multiple inflammatory and thrombotic proteins,
while the 3p21.31 locus is associated with levels of CXCL16, a known inflammatory chemokine.5 Thus,
integration of genetic information and proteomic profiling in biracial cohorts highlights putative
mechanisms for genetic risk in COVID-19 disease.
Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 infection displays a wide array of clinical manifestations and degrees of severity. While
there is evidence that comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular and metabolic disease, are risk factors for
disease severity and outcomes,6 the underlying biologic mechanisms that cause some to develop life
threatening disease while others remain asymptomatic are not well understood.
The association recently observed between the ABO locus on chromosome 9 and susceptibility to
respiratory failure in COVID-19 is consistent with earlier work showing an association between blood
type and COVID-19 disease, though the mechanism(s) by which this locus might confer susceptibility to
respiratory failure is unknown.7,8 The association with the 3p21.31 region observed in the same recent
study was particularly novel, but also of unclear significance.3

Emerging proteomic technologies enable large-scale protein profiling in population-based studies.
Leveraging available genetic data, investigators have identified the genetic architecture of the circulating
proteome.9–11 Conversely, combing this information can identify proteomic signatures associated with
specific loci or disease variants. Here we used measurements of 1,305 circulating proteins on the
SOMAScanTM platform and genetic data from 4,859 participants in three large population-based studies:
the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), a cohort of black participants, as well as meta-analyzed data from two
white cohorts, the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study (MDCS). We
tested for associations between genetic variants at the ABO and 3p21.31 loci and protein levels in the
three cohorts to identify possible mediators of disease.
Results
Cohort Characteristics
Participants in the JHS with proteomics had an average age of 56 years and were 61% female. They had
multiple comorbidities including hypertension (56% on treatment), diabetes mellitus (24%), and obesity
(mean BMI 32). Baseline characteristics in FHS/MDCS have been reportedly previously.9 In brief,
participants in FHS/MDCS were of similar age to JHS but with fewer females (49-53%), and lower
prevalence of treated hypertension, obesity, and diabetes mellitus.
pQTLs in the ABO locus
Table 1 shows the 56 proteins that associate with variants within 1MB of the transcription start site (TSS)
of the ABO gene in either JHS or FHS/MDCS or both at a p-value < 5×10-8. Such variants are termed
protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs). Twenty-three proteins had significant genetic associations in both
black and white subjects, while 15 were specific to JHS and 18 were specific to the FHS/MDCS. As
might be expected given the ABO region’s known association with thrombosis,12 proteins associated with
variants in this locus across all cohorts included ADAMTS13, von Willebrand Factor (vWF), Tie-1,
Angiopoetin-1 receptor, VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3. Inflammatory mediators, including P-selectin and E-

selectin, Immunoglobulin superfamily containing leucine-rich repeat protein 2, and FAM3D (which has
known cytokine activity) were also observed. Strikingly, CD209 antigen/DC-SIGN, which is the known
binding site for multiple viruses including SARS-CoV, and a theorized binding site for SARS-CoV-2,13
showed a strong association in both white and black cohorts. The specific variant most strongly associated
with levels differed between JHS and FHS/MDCS. To demonstrate the specificity of the aptamer for DCSIGN protein, we separately identified 47 variants within the gene encoding DC-SIGN protein (on
chromosome 19) that associated with DC-SIGN protein levels in JHS at genome wide significance (p <
5×10-8). Supplementary Table 1 summarizes data that similarly support aptamer specificity for all
proteins described herein, using the presence of such variants at or near the gene coding for the target
protein that also associate with measured protein levels (termed cis-pQTLs), mass spectrometry data, or
immunoassay data.
Some protein associations were observed only in one racial group or the other. Among JHS participants,
pQTLs in the ABO locus were associated with multiple inflammatory proteins including Cytotoxic Tlymphocyte protein 4, Interleukin-13, Interleukin-6 receptor subunit beta, Immunoglobulin alpha Fc
receptor, T-cell surface glycoprotein CD4, and Programmed cell death 1 ligand 2. No pQTLs were
identified for these proteins in FHS/MDCS. On the other hand, in FHS/MDCS but not JHS, variants in
the ABO locus were associated with multiple adhesion molecules including Intercellular adhesion
molecule 2, Neural cell adhesion molecule L1, Intercellular adhesion molecule 5, and Junctional adhesion
molecule B.
Proteins associated with rs657152
Given the above findings, we examined the specific variant identified by Ellinghaus et al., rs657152,
which was the sentinel SNP at the ABO locus, having the strongest association with respiratory failure in
COVID-19. Table 2 shows that this variant is a pQTL for a subset of the proteins associated with the
larger locus described above. Notably, CD209 antigen/DC-SIGN, Basal Cell Adhesion Molecule,

FAM3D, and vWF were all associated with this variant in both cohorts. For each of these four proteins,
the effect allele that conferred higher risk for respiratory failure, A, was associated with higher measured
levels of protein.
pQTLs in the chr3:45800446-46135604 locus
Given the multiple genes spanned by the other susceptibility locus, on chromosome 3, we similarly
looked for pQTLs in this locus. Table 3 shows the proteins associated with variants in this region. Two
proteins were found to have pQTLs in this locus across all cohorts: C-X-C motif chemokine 16
(CXCL16) and Teratocarcinoma growth factor 1. The TDGF1 gene is near this locus making this a cispQTL. Further, while not a true cis relationship, CXCL16 is the ligand for CXCR6, whose gene is within
this locus. No proteins were significantly associated with the specific variant identified by Ellinghaus et
al., rs11385942.
Finally, we examined whether circulating levels of CXCL16 or DC-SIGN are associated with known risk
factors for COVID-19 in JHS using unadjusted associations. While CXCL16 showed modest associations
with age, sex, BMI, smoking, and renal function, DC-SIGN only showed a weak association with
coronary disease (Table 4).
Discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic is a continually evolving public health crisis, and the biological mechanisms
that confer the heterogeneous outcomes of infection remain unclear. Given the recently identified
COVID-19 risk loci, our data identify several possible pathways by which these loci might confer risk in
COVID-19.
The ABO locus is highly pleiotropic in our pQTL data, being associated with the levels of 56 proteins
across the black and white cohorts. This likely reflects, in part, its role as a glycosyltransferase, altering
the overall structure of multiple glycoproteins. An association between ABO blood group and disease is

emerging in COVID-19. At least one published study observed a higher proportion of type A blood
among individuals hospitalized with COVID-19,14 and unpublished data from China and the United States
suggests that blood group A is associated with increased risk of acquiring COVID-19. In China, an
increased proportion of Type A blood was observed among those with COVID-19 as compared with local
controls.8 Zietz and Tatonetti found similar results among patients from New York Presbyterian Hospital,
and meta-analyzed with the data from China to confirm the association.7 Most recently, the ABO locus
was shown to be a risk locus for COVID-19 severity; in a meta-analysis of 1,610 cases of COVID-19 and
respiratory failure and 2,205 COVID-19 cases without respiratory failure across a population of patients
from Spain and Italy, Ellinghaus et al. observed multiple variants in the ABO gene locus that conferred
increased risk.3 They, and others, have speculated about the possible ways in which ABO might play a
role in COVID-19. The thrombotic risk associated with this locus is one plausible element, and indeed we
observe the well-known association of this locus with vWF levels.12,15 Others suggest that blood type
associates with ACE2 levels.16 Still others hypothesized that circulating anti-A antibodies in individuals
with Type O or B blood might also confer some level of immunity to COVID-19.14,17 Our data, however,
strongly suggest that ABO influences CD209 antigen/DC-SIGN, which is a known binding site for SARSCoV.4 DC-SIGN is expressed by dendritic cells, and it has been shown that the SARS-CoV spike protein
utilizes this protein for cell entry, as do HIV and dengue virus.4 Interestingly, DC-SIGN is thought to
increase with age, and pre-print data suggest that it is also increased in smokers, associating it with two
risk factors for COVID-19,18 though we did not observe these associations in our JHS data. Additionally,
we did not observe an association with ACE2 levels measured on the SOMAScanTM platform. The
association between ABO and DC-SIGN is consistent with data from other GWAS studies of the human
proteome,10,11 and we now show the association in a black population. The frequency of the risk allele is
slightly higher in JHS, one potential (though likely modest) reason for racial differences in COVID-19.
Taken together, these data suggest that the ABO locus may confer its risk in part by modulating DCSIGN, a putative binding site for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry.

Our data further suggest that the ABO locus may influence disease through pleiotropic effects, which may
differ between black and white individuals. We show that ABO variants are associated with proteins
involved in endothelial function and thrombosis, important complicating factors in COVID-19.19
However, there were key differences between the cohorts. In JHS, levels of multiple inflammatory
proteins were associated with ABO variants, whereas in FHS/MDCS, ABO variation was associated with
proteins involved in cellular adhesion. These differences may mediate increased risk, perhaps for
inflammatory complications of COVID-19, such as cytokine storm.20
We also observed interesting associations at the other risk locus identified by Ellinghaus et al., at which
the sentinel effect allele conferred higher risk in their analysis, compared to ABO.3 The validity of the
3p21.31 locus is noted by them to be supported by the Covid-19 Host Genetics Consortium data, which
also showed increased COVID-19 risk, albeit at a lower level of significance.21 In our analysis, two key
proteins emerged, CXCL16 and Teratocarcinoma growth factor 1. TDGF-1 is a signaling protein, and has
an unclear relationship to infection or propagation of respiratory disease. CXCL16, on the other hand, is
the chemokine ligand for the CXCR6 receptor, whose coding gene is at the chromosome 3 locus of
interest. This makes the CXCR6 gene a strong candidate for further investigation among the large number
of genes at this locus. Indeed CXCL16/CXCR6 has been implicated in LPS-induced acute lung injury and
alveolar inflammation previously.5,22
Limitations
Our study has several important limitations. We have not studied the relationship between these proteins
and genes in COVID-19 cases, thus confirming their role in pathogenesis requires further study. While
the proteomic profiling discussed here is extensive, it does not cover the entire proteome, and important
protein associations may be missed as a result. Further, while changes in aptamer binding are typically
reflective of protein levels, it may be the case that ABO-mediated glycosylation alters aptamer binding,
thus changing the measurement of the protein without a true change in protein levels. Nonetheless, our

data demonstrate that ABO affects the identified proteins, motivating further investigation. Additionally,
in the case of DC-SIGN (and CXCL16), we and others have found that variants at the cognate gene are
associated with levels of the protein as measured by the aptamer (Supplementary Table 1). Finally, we
acknowledge we do not observe an association between the lead risk SNP at 3p21.31 identified by
Ellinghaus et al. and CXCL16. Formal colocalization in larger cohorts will be useful in clarifying the
gene-protein relationships.
Conclusions
We show here extensive proteomic profiling of genetic variation proposed to confer risk in COVID-19.
We have shown in black and white cohorts that the ABO locus is associated with DC-SIGN, a putative
binding site for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting ABO-mediated alteration of DC-SIGN may play a key role in
disease pathogenesis. We further identify the CXCL16/CXCR6 pair as another potential disease mediator.
Further study, specifically in COVID-19 infected patients, is needed to confirm these findings and
determine whether levels or other modifications of these proteins could alter disease processes.

Methods
Study Approval
The human study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center, Boston University Medical Center, Lund University, and University of Mississippi
Medical Center, and all participants provided written informed consent.
Proteomic samples
The Jackson Heart Study is a community-based longitudinal cohort study begun in 2000 of 5306 selfidentified African Americans from the Jackson, Mississippi metropolitan statistical area, the design of
which is previously described.23 Baseline characteristics were assessed at Visit 1 between 2000 and 2004.

Included in the present study are 1813 individuals with proteomic profiling and whole genome
sequencing. Resting blood pressure was measured while sitting by recording two measurements with a
Hawksley random zero sphygmomanometer using one of four cuff sizes selected by measured arm
circumference. Glomerular filtration rate was estimated using the CKD-EPI equation.24 Prevalent
coronary heart disease (CHD) at Visit 1 was determined as a composite of patient reported angina, patient
reported myocardial infarction, and evidence of previous myocardial infarction on ECG.
JHS plasma samples were collected at Visit 1 in EDTA tubes maintained in -70°C freezers.25 Proteomic
measurements were performed using SOMAscan™, a single-stranded DNA aptamer-based proteomics
platform, which contained 1,305 aptamers.26 Samples were run in three separate batches for cost
efficiency. Batch 1 was run as a nested case-control study of incident coronary disease, excluding those
with prevalent coronary heart disease at Visit 1. Batches 2 and 3 were a randomly selected sample of the
remaining JHS participants. Each batch was divided into several plates containing a subset of the samples.
The FHS Offspring study has been previously described.27,28 Included in the present study are 1625
individuals with proteomic profiling and genotyping performed at Visit 5. Proteomic profiling in FHS
was also performed on the SOMAscan™ platform. In FHS, plasma samples were collected in citratetreated tubes, which were then centrifuged within 15 minutes at 2000 g for 10 minutes and the supernatant
plasma was aliquoted and stored at −80°C without freeze thaw cycles until assayed. This was completed
in 2 different batches. In batch one, 1129 proteins (1.1k) were profiled in 695 individuals. As a result of
platform enhancements that occurred in the interval between the first and second set of samples being run,
batch 2 included an expanded panel of 1305 proteins (1.3k), which was assayed in 930 participants.
The MDCS is a Swedish population-based, prospective, observational cohort recruited between 1991 and
1996.29 Included in the present study are 1421 individuals with proteomics and genotyping. Proteomic
profiling in MDCS was also performed on the SOMAscan™ 1.3k platform as above, except samples were
collected in EDTA-treated tubes. All assays in all cohorts were performed using SOMAscan™ reagents
according to the manufacturer’s detailed protocol.30

Genotyping and Imputation
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) in JHS has been described previously.31 JHS participants underwent
30× WGS through the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) project at the Northwest Genome
Center at University of Washington; genotype calling was performed by the Informatics Resource Center
at the University of Michigan.
Genome-wide genotyping methods for the FHS have been described previously.32 Briefly, genotyping
was conducted using the Affymetrix 500K mapping array and the Affymetrix 50K gene-focused MIP
supplemental array. Genotypes were called using Chiamo
(http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~marchini/software/gwas/chiamo.html). We used the 1000 Genomes Phase I
version 3 (August 2012) reference panel to perform imputation using a hidden Markov model
implemented in MaCH (version 1.0.16)33 for all SNPs passing the following criteria: call rate ≥ 97%,
pHWE ≥ 1 × 10−6, Mishap P ≥ 1 × 10−9, Mendel errors ≤ 100, and MAF ≥ 1%.
In the MDCS, genotyping was conducted using the Illumina Omni Express Exome BeadChip kit.
Genotypes were called using Illumina GenomeStudio and imputation performed to the same 1000
Genomes version as for FHS using IMPUTE (v2) for SNPs passing the following criteria: call rate ≥ 95%,
pHWE ≥ 1 × 10−6, minor allele frequency ≥ 0.01.
Statistical analysis
In JHS, because proteomic data varied by batch, measurements were first standardized to a set of control
samples that were part of each plate. Because of the non-normal distribution of the resulting protein
levels, age, sex, and batch adjusted residuals were generated and inverse normalized. The association
between these values and genetic variants was tested using linear mixed effects models adjusted for age,
sex and the genetic relationship matrix to adjust for relatedness using the fastGWA model implemented in
the GCTA software package.34 Variants with a minor allele count less than 5 were excluded.

In FHS and MDCS, inverse normalized transformed values of protein levels were also used. The
association of genetic variants and protein levels were tested using linear mixed effects models to
accommodate pedigree structure under an additive genetic model, adjusted for age and sex. Genome-wide
association analyses were performed using the R GWAF package.35
Association analyses were limited to within 1MB of the transcription start site (TSS) of the ABO locus on
chromosome 9 as well as the locus on chromosome 3 identified by Ellinghaus et al.: chr3:4580044646135604 in Build hg38. Since FHS loci are identified by Build hg37 location, the region was shifted
using the sentinel SNP rs11385942 as the reference point to chr3:45841939-46177097 in Build hg37. As
we had hypothesis-driven genomic loci of interest, statistical significance for protein quantitative trait loci
(pQTLs) was kept at a level of 5×10-8 despite multiple comparisons.
To determine associations between clinical variables and DC-SIGN or CXCL16, we used Pearson
correlations for continuous variables and logistic regression for dichotomous variables. All protein levels
were log-transformed and scaled by batch to normalize the data and reduce batch effects.

Listed above are the proteins significantly associated with either locus. Aptamer specificity for target proteins were confirmed/inferred via orthogonal methods (i.e. genetics, mass spectrometry,
immunoassay). Genetic studies with cis-pQTLs in literature and unpublished data cited. The Olink Spearman Rho data was generated from 400 samples run on both SOMAscan Version 1.3 and Olink
immunoassay (12 panels, unpublished data). Mass spectrometry data from previously published literature. * Genetic studies may not be able to determine aptamer protein isoform specificity.
