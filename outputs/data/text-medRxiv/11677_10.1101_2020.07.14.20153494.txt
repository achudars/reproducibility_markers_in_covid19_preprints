Background: As the coronavirus cases continue to surge, the urgent need for universal testing
to identify positive cases for effective containment of this highly contagious pandemic has
become the center of attention worldwide. However, in spite of extensive discussions, very few
places have even attempted to implement it. We evaluated the efficacy of widespread testing
in creating a safe workplace in our healthcare community including staff and patients.
Furthermore, we assessed the rate of new infections in patients undergoing electrophysiology
(EP) procedure, to see if identification and exclusion of positive cases facilitated establishment
of a risk-free operating environment.
Methods: Universal testing was conducted in subjects with no symptoms of COVID-19 including
patients and their caregivers and staff in our electrophysiology units along with the Emergency
Medical Service (EMS) staff (n=1670)
Results: Of 1670, 758 (45.4%) were EP patients, and the remaining 912 were caregivers, EMS
staff and hospital staff from EP clinic and lab. Viral-RNA test revealed 64 (3.8%) positives in the
population. A significant increase in the rate of positives was observed from April to June, 2020
(p=0.02). Procedures of positive cases (n=31) were postponed until they tested negative at
retesting on day 14. Staff testing positive (n=33) were retested before going back to work after
2 weeks. Because of suspected exposure, 67 staff were retested and source was traced. No new
infections were reported in patients during the hospital stay or within 2-weeks after the
procedure.

Introduction: SARSCoV-2 infection causing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) became a
global pandemic in a very short period of time affecting humanity in an unprecedented way (1).
Since then, several million patients have been infected and hundreds of thousands have died in
the United States alone. High infection rate and mortality coupled with limited knowledge
about the SARS-CoV-2 virus have made the management of this pandemic extremely
challenging. Subsequently, social distancing and lock down measures have been put in place to
control the spread. These drastic yet important measures have not only affected the economy
and social life, but also have dramatically impacted essential services including cancellation of
all elective procedures in hospitals. Furthermore, this pandemic has left millions of patients in a
state of panic and compromising access to care. For the fear of contracting the highly
contagious COVID-19 infection, many ill patients sequestered at home have been reported to
be presenting in later stages of their disease progression leading to poor outcomes and
mortality (2).
A rational tactic to control this rapidly spreading infectious disease would be by identification of
positive cases using universal testing followed by contact-tracking and isolation of confirmed
cases. Consequently, this would not only curtail the new infection rates in the community, but
also would be helpful in titrating restrictive measures instead of imposing sweeping lockdowns
on all. Although this approach seems absolutely logical, testing in the USA and world-wide has
been limited to symptomatic subjects only and universal testing has been implemented in a
very small number of communities (3-5). We designed a model of mass-testing for the
electrophysiology service line in an attempt to create a COVID-safe environment and keep
providing the much needed procedural care. Here, we report the impact of universal testing on

lowering the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the hospital setting among the
patients and healthcare workers in our hospitals.
Methods: In this consecutive series, patients scheduled for electrophysiology (EP) procedures
and their caregivers as well as staff in the EP subspecialty with no symptoms of COVID-19, were
tested for the SARS-CoV-2 viral-RNA and serology tests. The aim was to screen for positive cases
in asymptomatic staff and patients in population presenting to the EP service. The serological
test was performed utilizing COVID-19 Rapid Test (Premier Biotech Labs, 723 Kasota Avenue SE,
Minneapolis, MN 55414 and Confirm Biosciences, San Diego, CA) that uses a drop of blood from
finger-prick to detect presence of IgM and IgG in 15 minutes or less. Nasopharyngeal swab was
tested for viral RNA using ID NOW test kit from Abbott Diagnostics Scarborough, Inc., Maine. All
test kits were cross verified internally by testing them against known COVID positive and
negative patients.
Participants were included only if they were asymptomatic. They were screened based on a
survey that assessed their travel and contact history along with symptoms. Pre-existing medical
conditions were also noted during the screening procedure.
Exclusion criteria included body temperature higher than 38oC, symptoms of COVID-19 and
history of close contact with a known infected patient in the last two weeks. These patients
were triaged to viral-RNA test using nasal swab (FIGURE 1).
All patients undergoing EP procedures received general anesthesia and were intubated as
necessary. The physicians and staff involved in the study, after testing negative in the viral-RNA
test, interacted normally in the work environment without using social distancing and

extensive protective gears. Standard precautions were taken in the lab by the anesthesia teams
while intubating and extubating patients. Staff testing positive for viral-RNA on day 0 were
retested on day 14 before they got back to work. Those with potential exposure to confirmed
cases were retested with a swab test and contacts were traced. In 2 hospitals, personnel
involved in patient care including technicians, nurses, physicians, dieticians, janitorial staff were
retested at 14 -21 days using nasopharyngeal swab test for viral-RNA.
Patients undergoing EP procedures were followed up for 2 weeks after being discharged from
the hospital. They were asked to measure daily temperatures and report any symptoms of
COVID-19 if experienced during the 2-week period.
Patients were enrolled in our COVID-19 registry study (Clinicaltrials.Gov: NCT04352764) with
an institutional IRB-approved protocol.
Statistical analysis:
Continuous data were reported as mean (standard deviation) and categorical data were
presented as absolute frequencies (percentage). Descriptive analysis was performed
summarizing age, gender, risk factors, presenting symptoms, and comorbidities. Individual
patient characteristics were presented in a table format for patients having positive COVID-19
test result. The Student t test was used to compare continuous data and Ï‡2 test was used to
compare categorical data. All tests were 2-sided and p<0.05 was considered as statistically
significant. The analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics 25.0 (IBM SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA).

Results: Starting from April 2, 2020, a total of 1670 asymptomatic subjects were tested for
COVID-19 using rapid testing methods.
The Abbott ID Now kit for viral-RNA detection was validated in 46 known positive cases. Of the
46, 45 were positive on ID Now platform (sensitivity 97.8%, positive-predictive value 100%).
Similarly, 58 negative specimens gave a negative result on the Abbott test (100% specificity).
Serology tests were authenticated in 22 known positive and 22 negative cases (100% sensitivity
and specificity). Based on our validation, we found the test kits to be reliable. No subsequent
disagreements were observed during the study period.
Baseline characteristics and symptoms are presented in Table 1. Of the 1670 cases, 758 (45.4%)
were patients attending EP clinic or lab and the remaining included caregivers of patients
(n=221), EMS staff (n=219) and staff from EP clinic and lab (n=472). Majority of the physicians,
hospital staff and EMS members were tested in the first week of the study period.
A total of 64 (3.8%) cases were positive for viral-RNA at baseline. They included 31 (4.09%)
patients, 26 (5.5%) EP staff, 2 (0.9%) caregivers and 5 (2.28%) EMS staff (FIGURE 2). The
positive rate was 2.79% (21/753) in the month of April, 3.81% (13/341) in May and 5.2%
(30/576) in June (p=0.01) (FIGURE 3). All 33 staff members testing positive on day 0 were
retested for viral RNA on day 14; 32/33 (96.9%) were negative and were allowed to get back to
work. One staff with positive viral-RNA on day 14 tested negative on day 21. Serology test was
positive in 63/64 (98.4%) on day 14-21; 34 (53%) were positive for both IgM and IgG, 29 (45.3%)
for IgG only.

None of the patients reported symptoms of COVID-19 infection during the hospital stay or
within 2 weeks after the procedure.
Retesting:
A total of 237 staff were retested during the study period either because of potential exposure
(n=67) or as part of the standard institutional practice (n=170); 6/67 (8.9%) and 0/170 tested
positive. In these 6 positive cases, contact tracing revealed the possible source of infection to
be family members or friends outside of the workplace. None of the coworkers of these 6 staff
tested positive at that time.
Discussion:
As the continuing surge in COVID-19 cases is affecting lives world-wide and seriously
challenging the reopening of institutions, businesses and borders, universal testing to identify
infectious cases to limit the spread seems to be the only logical way out of this pandemic
besides vaccination. However, very few places have actually implemented it into practice.
Therefore, we designed this study to assess the efficacy of our universal-testing model where
all staff members of the EP unit as well as all patients scheduled for EP procedures and their
caregivers with no symptoms of the SARS-CoV-2 infection were tested for COVID-19 and only
those testing negative were allowed to provide or receive care. Furthermore staff were
retested before coming back to work if they were tested positive initially. Additionally, contacttracing was performed to identify potential source of infection for newly positive staff
members.

Our main findings were the following: 1) in asymptomatic patients and staff, the overall rate of
positive cases was low (3.8%). However, it showed a significant increase in trend from the
month of April to June, 2020; 2) universal testing promoted a safe environment for patients as
shown by the absence of newly developed COVID-19 infections during hospital stay or
immediately afterwards 3) repeat testing ensured an infection-free work environment where
physicians and staff testing negative for COVID-19 could interact freely without using
significantly restrictive, expensive non-conventional protective gears and difficult to implement
social distancing rules and 4) the safety of workplace was further validated by identifying the
possible source of infection by contact-tracing, to be from outside of the hospital in newly
positive staff members. Everyone was encouraged to maintain social distancing, avoiding
unnecessary public place interaction, protective masks, frequent handwashing and appropriate
sanitizing outside the hospital setting. With this strategy there were no new infections amongst
the patients and the EP unit could operate normally providing quality service to the patients.
After COVID-19 was declared a pandemic and a national emergency in March, 2020, social
distancing, lock-down of several non-essential businesses and institutions and restrictive
control measures in the healthcare settings were imposed in the USA. Several professional
societies and regional authorities recommended shutting down non-emergent services and all
elective procedures were placed on hold (6). Although these actions have resulted in controlling
the spread of the infection to some extent, it has not only taken a devastating toll on the global
economy and social fabric, but it also has â€˜locked outâ€™ other patients from receiving essential
care that could have significant downstream impact on mortality and morbidity from conditions
such as heart diseases, cancer and mental illness. As reported from China, many patients who

had symptoms of acute myocardial infarction, presented much later to the hospital leading to
significant increase in related complications, morbidity and mortality (2). Therefore, in the
present context, it is critical to have an action plan that will help creating and executing a
relative COVID-safe care continuum and operational abilities to continue to provide safe and
high quality healthcare.
In our series, viral-RNA test was performed in all staff members, incoming patients and their
caregivers and they were recommended self-quarantine for 2 weeks if positive. Thus, our
screening method identified infection-free staff and patients that could safely work in close
proximity without any fear of horizontal transmission of COVID-19. It not only kept the medical
units functional without any hospital-acquired COVID-19, but it also saved many jobs.
The tests used to screen our subjects with no symptoms of COVID-19 revealed very low rate of
positive cases. However, it was an important finding as without testing, identification of these
infected asymptomatic individuals would have definitely been missed and they could have
served as a source of infection for others in the workplace. Thus, by identifying and isolating
them, we could prevent the spread of infection in patients and staff in the EP units.
The gradual increase in the rate of positive cases among asymptomatic individuals is an
alarming finding of our study and further emphasizes the gravity of the need for universal
testing to prevent the spread of this pandemic.
Our approach to control new infections illustrated the benefits of universal testing which led to
a safe work environment with no hospital-acquired new COVID-19 infection in staff and
patients. Furthermore, in a workplace where the staff were infection-free, with all incoming

patients tested for COVID-19 for exclusion of positives, there was no need to retest all workers
unless there was a reported potential exposure off work. Physicians and other staff members
could interact freely in a close work-environment without using protective gears and social
distancing. This model can presumably be expanded to larger populations. The current
approach can also help properly triage the ongoing crisis of COVID-19.
Study limitations: There are several limitations to the current study. Obviously, this is a small
cohort from a single service line of a few hospitals. However, this provides a practical
framework which can be implemented on a larger scale to restart medical services by
identifying infected people in a health care environment through local testing. The tests are
limited by the false positives and false negatives which can impact the care continuum. We
cross verified the quality of these tests by checking them in patients with known positive and
negative COVID status. The safe reboot of the healthcare activity is critically dependent on
many other factors other than access to testing including â€“ prevalence and incidence of COVID
in each geographic area; hospital capacity for beds, ICUs, ventilators, personal protection
equipment and above all willingness of the patients and healthcare workers to embrace
elective procedures. Our study is a small beginning in a long path that needs to be laid down to
create a relative COVID safe care continuum.
Conclusion: In the current study, patient care at our EP facilities were safely carried out without
any reported hospital-acquired COVID-19 infection, when prior serological and viral-RNA test
were utilized to screen out all positive cases among the asymptomatic staff, patients and their
caregivers. Furthermore, by assuring COVID-negative status in all healthcare workers, a safe
working environment was created where all could function freely without the apprehension

and risk of contracting new infection. The success of our model in creating a safe workplace by
testing all individuals including those without any symptoms of COVID-19, within the confines
of a specific work environment sets the example that could be utilized to keep other
populated places such as offices, schools and hospitals etc. safe and open.
