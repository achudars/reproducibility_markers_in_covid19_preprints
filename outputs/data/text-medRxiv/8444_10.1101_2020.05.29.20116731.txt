TITLE: SARS-CoV-2 SEROPREVALENCE AMONG ALL WORKERS IN A TEACHING
HOSPITAL IN SPAIN: UNMASKING THE RISK.
ABSTRACT
Word count: 250

Background: Health-care workers (HCW) are at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2
infection, but few studies have evaluated prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV2 among them.

Objective: To determine the seroprevalence against SARS-CoV-2 in all HCW.

Methods. Cross-sectional study (April 14th- 27th , 2020) of all HCW at Hospital
Universitario Fundación Alcorcón, a second level teaching hospital in Madrid, Spain.
SARS-CoV-2 IgG was measured by ELISA. HCW were classified by professional
category, working area, and risk for SARS-CoV-2 exposure.

Results: Among 2919 HCW, 2590 (90.5%) were evaluated. Mean age was 43.8 years
(SD 11.1) and 73.9% were females. Globally, 818 (31.6%) workers were IgG positive,
with no differences for age, sex or previous diseases. Among them, 48.5% did not
report previous symptoms. Seropositivity was more frequent in high (33.1%) and
medium (33.8%) than in low-risk areas (25.8%, p=0.007), but no difference was found
for hospitalization areas attending COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients (35.5 vs
38.3% p=NS). HCW with a previous SARS-CoV2 PCR positive test were IgG
seropositive in 90.8%. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, seropositivity was
associated with being physicians (OR 2.37, CI95% 1.61-3.49), nurses (OR 1.67,
CI95% 1.14-2.46), or nurse- assistants (OR 1.84, CI95% 1.24-2.73), HCW working at
COVID-19 hospitalization areas (OR 1.71, CI95% 1.22-2.40), non-COVID-19
hospitalization areas (OR 1.88, CI95% 1.30-2.73), and at the Emergency Room (OR
1.51, CI95% 1.01-2.27)

Conclusions: Seroprevalence uncovered a high rate of infection previously unnoticed
among HCW. Patients not suspected of having COVID-19 as well as asymptomatic
HCW may be a relevant source for nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

HOSPITAL IN SPAIN: UNMASKING THE RISK.

INTRODUCTION

COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new human coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that
emerged in Wuhan, China, in late 20191. In Spain, the first case of SARS-CoV-2 was
identified on January 31st imported from Germany. Since that time, a sharp increase in
the number of cases has pushed the capacity of healthcare system in Madrid beyond
the limit2. More than 60.000 patients were attended in Madrid`s hospitals during March
and April 20202. As the pandemic accelerated, access to personal protective
equipment (PPE) for health workers was a key concern, moreover because of PPE
shortages4 .
Health-care workers (HCW) are at increased risk for infection, and specific
requirements for their protection are advisable to ensure the functioning of the
healthcare system5. Indeed, in Spain, more than 26.000 health care workers have been
infected and at least 41 had died4. Alongside concerns for the healthcare workers
personal safety, anxiety about transmitting the infection to their relatives and patients
adds another stress to HCW.
At this time, it is known that SARS-CoV-2 human to human transmission occurs during
the presymptomatic stage through droplets or direct contact6–8. The possibility of
presymptomatic transmission increases the challenges of containment measures9–11.
Moreover, according to two studies, presumed hospital-related transmission of SARSCoV-2 was suspected in 41% and 35% of patients10,12,13. Nosocomial transmission
may originate from patients (where protective measures are usually strict), but also

from asymptomatic HCW (where protective measures may be more relaxed or simply
non-existing).
Little is known about hospital HCW seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2. Rates from other
coronavirus epidemic such as MERS and SARS range between 2.3% and 20% of
subclinical infection14–16. Nosocomial transmission has been recognized as an
important amplifier in epidemics of both SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome17–
19

.

Serological surveillance of exposed individuals allows to estimate the individual risk.
This approach is essential since the safety of health-care workers must be ensured.
Screening all health-care workers for SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital would be helpful to
maintain the welfare of the staff and to enable identification of infected health-care
workers.
Our objective was to evaluate the prevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) against
SARS-CoV-2 among all the employees of a second level teaching hospital in the south
of Madrid.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Design. Cross sectional study of all hospital workers, direct hospital employees (clinical
and not clinical), as well as workers for external contractors developing their regular
tasks inside the hospital.
Setting. HUFA is a 402 beds general hospital, including 93 internal medicine and 16
critical care beds. As the only public hospital in Alcorcon, it covers a population of
170.000 inhabitants. On March 3th we received the first COVID-19 patient. Total
number of COVID-19 patients attended by April 14th was 1,638 patients, among them
236 died. A quick structural and functional reorganization was required, reaching a
peak occupancy of 370% in internal medicine hospitalization, 293% in ICU and 320%
in ER. The number of PPE providers increased 10 fold and associated expenditures
300-fold. In spite of this, occasional shortage of appropriate PPE occurred several
times.
For the purpose of the analysis, workers were classified into categories according to
the estimated risks for nosocomial exposure to SARS-CoV2. Very high included
professionals with direct contact with COVID-19 patients: critical care &
anesthesiology, ER (ER) and COVID-hospitalization ward. Medium risk was attributed
to professionals attending patients not suspected having COVID-19 both in hospital
wards and outpatient clinics, and central units (pharmacy, laboratory, radiology,
pathology). Finally, low risk was attributed to administrative and management units and
external workers (cooks, food service, cleaners, ambulance drivers, store sellers, and
watchmen)20 PPE were distributed according to the estimated risk in different areas,
with a priority for critical care unit and ER in case of shortage. A total of 1,561 workers
most likely to attend COVID-19 patients received intensive training for the use of PPE
at the hospital`s Center for Medical Simulation IDEhA.

Selection and participation of individuals

All HCW were invited to attend to an interview conducted by the staff of the
Occupational Health Unit (OHU) and additional clinical assistants and blood sample
extraction for serologic studies April 14th to April 27th

All along the study period, professionals with symptoms suggestive of COVID19 were encouraged to attended to the OHU where a nasopharyngeal swab was
obtained for SARS-CoV-2 PCR exam. Patients with a positive test were sent home for
quarantine or to the ER for further clinical evaluation.
Results of IgG status were informed personally to all HCW by OHU staff one to
two weeks after blood extraction. HCW with a positive IgG and COVID-19 compatible
symptoms in the previous 14 days were identified and tested by PCR.

Variables
We collected information about age, gender, professional category, area of
work, relocation during COVID-19 care (if appropriate) previous health conditions
(Supplement 1), self-reported potential SARS-CoV-2 exposure and type of exposure,
(occupational with PPE, occupational without PPE or non-occupational), last date of
exposure; presence and date of COVID-19 symptoms, PCR test. Severity of disease:
out-patient evaluation, ER consultation, hospital admission and clinical outcome.

Laboratory procedures

We measured serum IgG antibody by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) IgG2 using a SARS-CoV-2 S spike and Nucleocapsid recombinant antigens
(Diapro (Palex), Italy), to screen for the presence of human anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. This
assay (CE approved) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Reported
sensitivity of the assay by the manufacturer was 98% (Supplement 2)

For molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection of nasopharyngeal swabs
were processed by automatized extraction using the MagNa Pure Lc instrument
(Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) and real time reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction using the SARS-Cov-2 nucleic acid detection Viasure kit
(CerTest Biotec S.L.), following the manufacturer’s instructions (Supplement 1)

IgG results interpretation

As per hospital protocol, all samples corresponding to whole HCW were analyzed.
HCW with positive IgG and presence of symptoms older than 14 days were assumed
to be infected but no longer contagious. Those with positive IgG and symptoms in the
past 14 days were considered as active infected and potential contagious and
underwent PCR examination. If PCR results were positive, they were discharged.
HCW with IgG negative were considered susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection21.
Asymptomatic workers were not routinely tested with PCR, but such test was
performed for persons with self-reported symptoms, and the report was voluntary.

Statistical analysis.
Data are reported as mean (± SD), median (IQR) or percentage as appropriate.
Categorical variables were compared using Pearson’s X2 test or Fisher exact test.
Continuous variables were analyzed using the Student t-test.
A univariate analysis was carried out to find independently associated risk factors for
positive IgG. A multivariate logistic regression model evaluated the association
between risk factors and positive IgG was assessed by reference to odds ratio (OR).
Statistical analysis was performed, with hypothesis testing based on a two-tailed test of
significance and we considered statistical significance P<0.05 with the Statistical
Package for Social Sciences (SPSSPC v 20 Illinois USA)

RESULTS

General description
All 2,919 HCW HUFA were invited to participate in the study between April 14-27,
2020. Among them 278 (9.5%) workers did not come to be tested because sick leave,
work at home, or declined the invitation (figure 1). In addition, 51 HCW (1.8%) refused
consent to use their data for investigational purposes and were removed from the
analysis. Thus, data of a total of 2,590 (98%) HCW were analyzed. They were 1,915
females, (73.9%) and mean age was 43.8 (SD 11.1) years. Previous relevant clinical
condition was present in 998 HCW (38.5%), distributed as follows: tobacco use 21%,
chronic lung disease or asthma 8%, obesity 6.0%, high blood pressure 6.9%, diabetes
mellitus 2.1% and other cardiovascular diseases 2.0% (Table 1).
A total of 2,369 (91.5%) participants reported some degree of direct exposure to
SARS-CoV-2. The exposition was occupational in 1,946 (75%), contact with affected
colleagues in 1,710 (66%), and non-occupational in 290 (12.2%) HCW. Among HCW
with occupational exposition, 72% of them referred adequate PPE use.

IgG results
Overall, SARS-CoV-2 IgG was positive in 818 HCW (31.6%), negative in 1,743 (67.3%)
and borderline in 29 (1.1%). There were no differences IgG seropositivity positive for
sex (31.6% women vs 33% men, p=0.482) or age (positive 43.9 years [11.4 SD]) vs
negative 43.6 years [11.2 SD]), p=0.719) respectively.

IgG results by area and professional category
High and medium risk areas had higher rate of seropositivity (33.1%, [450/1,359] and
33.8% [257/760]) than low risk areas (25.8%, [48/201]), p=0,007 (figure 2). The
proportion of seropositive HCW among working areas was: ER (32.8%, 83/253),
critical care (23.8%, 53/223), COVID-19 admitted patients (35.5%, 311/875), non11

COVID-19 admitted patients (38.3%, 141/368), non-COVID-19 clinical care units
(32,8%, 40/122) central units (29%, 85/293) administrative and management areas
(24.9%, 56/225) and external workers 23.9%, 48/201; p<0.001 (table 2)
Physicians were the most infected professional category, (39.6%, 222/561) followed by
nurse assistant, (33.7%, 157/466), nurses (31.2%, 211/676), external workers (28.2%,
94/333), patient carrier (27.7%, 46/166), administrative and management staff (27.6%,
47), and finally technicians (21.7%, 41/170) , p<0.001 (table 2).
Participants who referred use of inappropriate PPE were 27.0%. The rate of
seropositivity among them was 42.0% (219/522) as compared to 27.7% (374/1354) in
cases with referred appropriate PPE use, p<0.001. However, this difference
disappeared when the sample was stratified by previous attention to the OHU.

Symptoms
A total of 397 out of 818 (48,5%) IgG positive HCW did not consult at the OHU
previous to the seroprevalence study, so they did not consider that their symptoms, if
any, could be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, among them, 193 (48.6%)
recalled minor symptoms in the study interview that they had not attributed to potential
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
On the contrary, during the period of COVID-19 clinical care, a total of 421 out
of 818 HCW (51.4%) attended to the OHU because of symptoms suggestive of COVID19 and were tested by PCR for SARS-CoV-2; among them, 306/421 (72.7%) tested
positive. A small proportion ((48 cases/421 (11,4%%)) of HCW were further evaluated
at the ER, and 25 (5,9% [25/421]) required hospital admission (figure 3). PCR tests
were not performed in asymptomatic individuals.
The most common symptoms among PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases were
myalgia (63.1%), cough (62.2%), asthenia (61.9%), anosmia (61.7%), fever (59.0%),
cephalea (58.7) and ageusia (53.4%) (figure 3). Those HCW with COVID-19 diagnosed

solely by serology presented symptoms less frequently. Of note, some symptoms were
also reported among HCW without COVID-19.
Forty-two out of 818 IgG positive HCW referred mild symptoms in the 14 days
previous to study evaluation and were tested by PCR for SARS-CoV2. Among them 8
HCW were positive and they were sent home for quarantine.

PCR results
Three hundred and six, 90.8% (306/339) of HCW with previous positive PCR
were SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive. Conversely, 30.2% (115/388) of HCW with negative
SARS-CoV-2 PCR had positive IgG. Finally, 9.2% (31/339) with positive PCR had a
negative IgG result. Median time from positive PCR and negative IgG test was 21 days
(IQR 14-26).

Multivariate analysis
We evaluated factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity by logistic
regression analysis. The independent variables included in the model were age, sex,
cardiovascular disease, professional category (model 1) and work area (model 2).
HCW with a significant increased probability of SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive were
physicians (OR 2.37, CI95% 1.61-3.49) nurse (OR 1.67, CI95% 1.14-2.46), and nurse
assistant (OR 1.84, CI95% 1.24-2.73), and HCW that works at COVID-19
hospitalization areas (OR 1.71, CI95% 1.22-2.40), non-COVID-19 hospitalization areas
(OR 1.88, CI95% 1.30-2.73), and at ER (OR 1.51, CI95% 1.01-2.27) (table 2 )

DISCUSSION

This is the first study of the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of all HCW,
regardless whether they were or not direct employee of the hospital. We found a
relatively high proportion (30%) of HCW with a positive IgG for SARS-CoV-2. A recent
study from Spanish population showed a national prevalence of 5%, but 11% in
Madrid23. A partial explanation for a higher prevalence at our hospital is the higher
exposition to the virus in the city of Alcorcón. Data from Madrid Regional Government
shows that Alcorcón had a slightly higher incidence of COVID-19 than the region of
Madrid24. Furthermore, a recent study from a large hospital in Barcelona showed a
prevalence in a sample of HCW of 11.6%, doubling the seroprevalence of the general
population 25, strengthening the notion of hospitals as a places of risk for SARS-Co2
infection among workers. Unsurprisingly, external workers (23.9%) and non-clinical
workers (25.8%) had lower seroprevalence than average26, although still much higher
than the general population in Madrid23. These data suggest a role for nosocomial
transmission also for non-clinical workers 27,28
Regarding clinical workers (all of them direct employees of the hospital), the
rate of positive IgG was virtually identical among workers with direct contact with
COVID-19-patients and those taking care of non-COVID-19 patients, as it has been
reported in other settings20. Some have proposed that workers with no direct contact
with COVID-19 could have been infected in the population (in a context in which the
actual seroprevalence in the population was unknown) 20. Our data argue against it:
clinical worker in non-COVID areas become seropositive likely because of in-hospital
contact, either from asymptomatic patients or colleagues.

These data suggest that the non-COVID-19 clinical areas are indeed an
unrecognized potential source for COVID-19 infection among workers27. A recent meta-

analysis estimates that nosocomial transmission is the source of SARS-CoV-2 infection
in about 44% of cases 29. This estimation is further increased up to almost 90% of
cases in a mathematical model.30

Since universal COVID-19 screening has not been a usual practice
implemented it is conceivable that a substantial proportion of so-called non-COVID-19
patients may be actually subclinical or unnoticed COVID-19 cases31,32 . Our results are
in agreement with a high rate of nosocomial transmission reported among workers in a
dialysis unit in New York33. These data emphasize the need for universal screening of
all in-hospital patients as recommend World Health Organisation34–36 and we are
already implementing.

A similar proportion of seropositivity among clinicians taking direct care of
COVID-19 patients suggest that the isolation protocols and PPE appear sufficient to
prevent high levels of nosocomial transmission in our setting13,37. Of note, critical care
workers had one of the lowest seropositivity rates in our study. Indeed, our hospital
prioritized the use of the best available PPE for critical care units, where virtually all
patients were COVID-19 at the peak of the epidemic38.
The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 in our workers resembles that described for
the general population: about half of them are asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic39–43
and less than 60% had fever (figure 3). That means that most infected workers remain
undetected unless there is a universal screening44,45. In retrospect, about 50% of
seropositive workers attending to the serology study recalled minor symptoms that did
not prompt a request for OHU evaluation. Thus, only about one fourth of IgG positive
workers were fully asymptomatic, as reported in other studies31,33.
Regarding workers with overt symptoms suggesting COVID-19 disease most of
them (83%) had a mild disease that could be managed in the outpatient setting. About

6% required ER visit and 3% required hospital admission. There were no deaths. This
is hardly surprisingly since there is no elder population among active workers10.
To prevent nosocomial transmission both patients and health care workers
should be screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection regardless of the absence of typical
symptoms for COVID-19 disease45 as asymptomatic transmission is being increasing
recognized as very relevant in SARS-CoV-2 spread.9,27,46.
Our study has some limitations that deserve consideration. First, we do not
have data about Ig M or concurrent PCR. However, our study was designed to have a
picture of past exposure to the virus in all our workers. We did not pursue an
evolutionary perspective of the disease. Second, the samples were collected over two
weeks, so the interpretation of the prevalence must be related to the average
prevalence at that time.
Nonetheless, our work has several strengths. First, the quality of the technology
we had used seems to be one of the highest sensitivities available (ELISA)

47–49

.

Second, we had a virtually universal representation of all workers of the hospital (90%),
including external employees, an evaluation hardly performed. Additionally, we
identified the particular function of all employees in a time of changing roles for
clinicians in the middle of the crisis. In addition, its close temporal vicinity with the
serologic study in the Spanish population allows for a direct comparison.
In conclusion, seroprevalence unmasked a high rate of infection previously
unnoticed in HCW. Clinical care of COVID-19 unscreened patients is associated with a
similar prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as the one found in COVID-19 facilities
uncovering a relevant source for nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In addition,
apparently healthy HCW may also be another relevant source for SARS-CoV-2
transmission. HCW testing could reduce in-hospital transmission50. Serosurveys in
hospitals may be helpful to design strategies to control SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.

SUPPLEMENT 2

We measured serum IgG antibody by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) IgG2 using a SARS-CoV-2 S spike and Nucleocapsid recombinant antigens
(Diapro (Palex), Italy), to screen for the presence of human anti- SARS-CoV-2 IgG.
This assay (CE approved) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Reported sensitivity of the assay by the manufacturer was 98%.

The results of the tested samples were determined by calculating the ratio of
the optical density (OD) value of the sample to the OD value of the cut-off. (Co) Ratios
≥ 1.1 were considered positive, ratios ≥ 0.9 to < 1.1 were considered borderline, and
ratios < 0.9 were considered negative. All assays were run following manufacter´s
instructions on the platforms DSX System ( Palex Medical SA) and Triturus ( Grifols
Movaco SA).
Sensitivity of the assay using samples from 337 workers from our series with results
previous positive PCR was 90.8% (manufacture shows 98%). Specificity manufacture’s
instructions shows that the assay was tested on hundreds of samples collected before
the outbreak of COVID-19. A value of >90% was found.
Index values considered “borderline” were tested on Strips-module Enzyme
Immunoassay for the confirmation of IgG antibodies to COVID-19-19 major antigens.
This assay detects IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2: Spike glycoprotein 1,
Spike glycoprotein 2 and nucleocapside proteins. A sample is considered for a certain
antibody negative S/Co<1, equivocal 1< S/Co<1.2, positive S/Co>1.2. These samples
were run on the platform DSX System ( Palex Medical SA). The manufacter´s
instructions shows that the assay was tested on hundreds of samples collected before
the outbreak of COVID-19-19. A value of >98% was found. About 2% of the reactive
“normal” population shows a reactivity to Nucleocapsid. A first minimum study carried

out in the context of a Public Health Emergency on samples from a cohort of infected
patients showed a sensitivity of about 98%.
This assay detects IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 independently :
Spike glycoprotein 1, Spike glycoprotein 2 and nucleocapside proteins. A sample is
considered positive S/Co>1.2. Specificity was found >98% and sensitivity of about
98%. The internal validation was performed by correlation with previously evaluated
PCR test as gold standard.
For molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection of nasopharyngeal swabs
were processed by automatized extraction using the MagNa Pure Lc instrument
(Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) and real time reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction using the SARS-Cov-2 nucleic acid detection Viasure kit
(CerTest Biotec S.L.), following the manufacturer’s instructions.
For this rRT-PCR, we used Bio-Rad CFX96™ Real-Time PCR Detection System. We
amplified two different viral regions: ORF1ab gene is amplified and detected in FAM
channel, and N gene is amplified and detected in ROX channel and the internal control
(IC) in HEX cannel.
Cycle threshold values, i.e., number of cycles required for the fluorescent signal to
cross the threshold in rRT-PCR, were quantified viral load, with lower values indicating
higher viral load. A sample was considered positive when the rRT-PCR Ct value was
≤40. Positive and negative control were included in each run for each assay.
