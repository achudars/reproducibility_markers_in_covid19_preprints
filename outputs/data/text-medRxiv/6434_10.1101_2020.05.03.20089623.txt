Abstract

27
28

The Spanish government declared the lockdown on March 14th, 2020 to tackle the fast-

29

spreading of COVID-19. As a consequence the Balearic Islands remained almost fully

30

isolated due to the closing of airports and ports, These isolation measures and the home-based

31

confinement have led to a low prevalence of COVID-19 in this region. We propose a

32

compartmental model for the spread of COVID-19 including five compartments (Susceptible,

33

Latent, Infected, Diseased, and Recovered), and the mobility between municipalities. The

34

model parameters are calibrated with the temporal series of confirmed cases provided by the

35

Spanish Ministry of Health. After calibration, the proposed model captures the trend of the

36

official confirmed cases before and after the lockdown. We show that the estimated number

37

of cases depends strongly on the initial dates of the local outbreak onset and the number of

38

imported cases before the lockdown. Our estimations indicate that the population has not

39

reached the level of herd immunization necessary to prevent future outbreaks. While the low

40

prevalence, in comparison to mainland Spain, has prevented the saturation of the health

41

system, this low prevalence translates into low immunization rates, therefore facilitating the

42

propagation of new outbreaks that could lead to secondary waves of COVID-19 in the region.

43

These findings warn about scenarios regarding after-lockdown-policies and the risk of second

44

outbreaks, emphasize the need for widespread testing, and could potentially be extrapolated

45

to other insular and continental regions.

Introduction

52

The rapid propagation of the new COVID-19 pandemic requires timely responses, including

53

the alignment of evidence generation by scientists and decision-making by policy

54

stakeholders. As of the current date, several mathematical models have been developed to

55

help policy-making in a wide arrange of interventions in various countries, encompassing

56

from testing strategies to lockdown measures (1-6). Although modeling pandemics is not

57

without flaws, and its predicted scenarios cannot be uncritically adopted and therefore

58

directly translate into policy (7), modeling can be a valuable support tool to guide policy

59

when assessed in an integrated way.

60
61

Recent studies have dealt with the possibility of a second-wave of COVID-19 after the

62

retirement of lockdown and confinement measures in China (1-2). Recently, the value of

63

restrictive social distancing measures has been recommended in Italy (8). The analysis of data

64

from closed confinements such as sea cruises allows us to address some key questions

65

regarding the risk of second waves in an environment without external perturbations (9,10).

66

The study of the evolution of the pathogen in islands offers an opportunity to learn how the

67

propagation occurs, and how the mobility restrictions are shaping the propagation in

68

relatively isolated areas, either due to transport lockdowns implemented to contain COVID-

69

19 dissemination or because of their geographical conditions.

70
71

The Balearic Islands archipelago is composed of four inhabited islands in the Mediterranean

72

Sea, i.e Majorca, Menorca, Ibiza, and Formentera, with a total population of 1,095,426, as per

73

2011 data (11). The main economic activity is tourism with principal connections to the UK

74

and Germany. The first reported case in Spain was identified in the Canary Islands on

75

January 31st, while in the Balearic Islands the first case (second in Spain) was confirmed on

February 9th. He was a British citizen resident in Majorca who had been in contact with an

77

infected person with SARS-CoV-2 during a stay in France from January 25-29. In Spain, the

78

schools were closed on March 16th and the lockdown was implemented at the national scale

79

from March 17th. As of April 11th, the number of infected in the Balearic Islands was 140

80

per 100,000 inhabitants to be compared with 354 in Spain (data updated with values of April

81

11th, 2020) (12). The lockdown of the Balearic Islands includes the closing of airports and

82

ports for passengers, rendering the archipelago a virtually closed system. In this regard,

83

archipelagos are “living laboratories” suggesting insights about the ecology and evolution of

84

infectious diseases and offering unique experimental testing protocols to reduce or eliminate

85

the diseases not only in the islands but potentially across the world (13). Thus, the Balearic

86

Islands present an opportunity to be used as a benchmark to explore how isolation and after-

87

lockdown measures impact secondary COVID-19 waves.

88
89

COVID-19 has a particular structure in the timings of the disease that make it particularly

90

dangerous in terms of a silent spreading potential. First, the incubation period, i.e the time

91

since infection to symptom onset, is relatively large around 5.2 days (95% confidence

92

interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0) (14). This itself is a driver of the predictability of the spatiotemporal

93

patterns to expect from this disease (15). Furthermore, the latent period, i.e the time since

94

infection to the start of being infectious, does not align completely with the incubation period

95

(4). This leaves a period of presymptomatic infectivity, that increases R0 through silent

96

spreading, as not even the carrier might be aware of its own infectivity (16). The relative

97

effectiveness of different non-pharmaceutical interventions will depend critically on the

98

relation of those times (incubation and latent period) (17). Other related periods that shape

99

the dynamics of the outbreaks are the generation interval (time between infection of infector-

100

infectee pairs) (18) and the serial interval (the time between symptom onsets of an infector-

101

infectee pair), which has also been used to estimate viral shedding dynamics for COVID-19

102

(4).

103
104

We aimed to study the dissemination of COVID-19 in a quasi-isolated system through a

105

compartmental model that included, besides the susceptible (S), diseased (D) and recovered

106

(R) compartments, an exposed (E) compartment, and a pre-symptomatic (I) infective

107

compartment to account for the incubation period, as the times of transit between the latter

108

two compartments are crucial for the modeling of COVID-19 (3,4). Due to population size,

109

we can implement an individual-based model where we consider each inhabitant as an

110

individual in the model. In particular, first, we compare the results of an individual-based

111

model tailored for the Balearic Islands and identify the parameter values that best fit the data.

112

Second, we explore the likelihood of a second-wave scenario as a function of the initial date

113

of the first imported case and the number of imported cases before the lockdown.

Results

117

Number of active infected cases

118

The best fit of the model to the confirmed cases, allows us to extract the transmission

119

probabilities and also the scaling factor that captures the ratio between the estimated and the

120

confirmed cases. For the scenario where the initial date was on Feb 7th, and a latent period of

121

2 days (Tlat=2), an infective period of 4 days (Tinf=4), and disease period of 12 days (Tdis=12),

122

the values of the infection probability leading to the best fit are β1=0.24, β2=0.12, β3=0.016,

123

and β4=0.036 (Figure 1). This translates into an initial basic reproductive number R0= 3.84.

124

The fitting of the data also informs us that the correction factor is 0.054, that is, that the

125

confirmed cases are 5.4% of the model estimates. At the same time, we obtain that the

126

percentage of added healed cases and fatalities according to the official sources the model

127

estimate are 5.3% of the confirmed cases. For the other values of the latent, infective, and

128

disease periods, we obtain similar accuracy, given by χ2 and similar scaling factors (Table

129

S1). The scaling factor, which gives the fraction of the model estimates, that corresponds to

130

the confirmed case, increases to 10% in the case of Tlat=5, Tinf=1, which is the case with less

131

infected individuals in the model.

132
133

The introduction of a single imported infected case after the first wave has expired strongly

134

correlates with the risk of a secondary wave (Figure 2). The intensity and duration of the

135

second wave depend on specific values capturing the conditions applicable when newly

136

infected cases appear, e.g the transmission probability, which depends on the habits of the

137

population, hygiene, and social distancing, and mobility restriction. Qualitatively similar

138

results were obtained for the other set of values. The peak of the second wave is very

139

sensitive to the date of the first exposure. If it happened on January 28th, the intensity of the

140

second peak is less pronounced and similar to the one for the first peak, in contrast to the case

141

of a more recent exposure, when the second peak can be more than one decade larger the first

142

peak.

143
144

Herd immunization estimates

145

Assuming recovered individuals get immunity, to estimate whether the Balearic Islands have

146

reached herd immunization, we explored the estimated number of infected under two

147

immunization scenarios based on the date of the first infection (Figure 3A) and the number of

148

imported cases before air and maritime transport lockdown (Figure 3B). Firstly, we analyzed

149

how the estimation of infected individuals is sensitive to the date of the first infection. We

150

explored the time range of the first infection from January 28th (which corresponds to the stay

151

in France before returning to Majorca) to Feb 7th (which corresponds to 30 days before the

152

10th confirmed case). Secondly, we explored the estimates under the assumption that more

153

than one imported case could have gone unnoticed into the Balearic Islands before the closing

154

of the airports. Depending on these two parameters, the range of immunization spans from

155

3% (for one initial infected on February 7th) to 64% (for 20 initial infected cases on January

156

28th). With the assumption of immunity after recovery, the achievement of herd

157

immunization in the population is very sensitive to the date of the first infection and the

158

number of imported cases before air and maritime transport lockdown. The interpretation of

159

herd immunization indicates that if infected individuals become immune, then 20% of herd

160

immunization prevents the spreading of reproductive numbers smaller than 1.25. Assuming

161

that the first case was exposed to the infection during his stay in France in the last days of

162

January, the percentage of the population that was infected can be as high as 50%, which

163

could prevent a high second peak, for values of the basic reproductive number below 2.

164

Conversely, if the first case was infected 30 days before 11 confirmed cases were reported in

165

the Balearic Islands, the percentage of infected individuals could lower to less than 10%,

166

therefore falling far from potential herd immunity (only for values of the basic reproductive

167

number below 1.1). The relation between the number of initial infected cases, the date of the

168

first infection, the number of cases, and the number of confirmed cases is further explored in

169

the Supplementary Material.

Discussion

172

Our study shows that a model including five compartments together with information on

173

mobility between municipalities can be used to capture the spread of the epidemics in a

174

closed community. The validation of the model with the official data allowed us to obtain the

175

parameters that best fitted the data. Once the model was validated, we extracted an estimation

176

of the number of the total infected in the Balearic Islands that indicates, assuming

177

immunization after recovery, that these figures would reach the herd immunization threshold

178

depending critically on the date of the first infection and the initial number of seeds, being

179

herd immunization achievement more likely for an initial date before January 31st and

180

number of initial infected above 10. Our exploration of the forecasted scenario of a newly

181

infected individual entering the community after the lockdown confirmed that the number of

182

potential cases widely varies according to the initial date of infection, which correlates with

183

the percentages of immunity. Although we cannot determine with precision the start of the

184

infection in the Balearic Islands, the model suggests that the Balearic Island population is

185

below the herd immunization threshold and thus, also susceptible to new outbreaks

186

depending on how immunity is acquired and how the mobility restrictions are further

187

implemented. In particular mobility and transmission probability, which depends on the

188

general use of masks and hygiene protocols by the population, might alter the attack rate.

189
190

Focusing on second waves in insulated areas during the COVID-19 pandemic is of great

191

value to analyze the spreading and containment of infectious diseases, where the lockdown of

192

islands constitutes a paradigmatic scenario, with the potential to be applied to continental

193

regions (13). The use of modeling tools is a complement to field studies that can be used to

194

anticipate the progress of a pandemic and thus help health authorities to make decisions. In

195

the case of the Balearic Islands, there are two foremost advantages in terms of model

196

precision. First, since the incidence during the first peak was relatively low and hospital

197

capacity including ICU beds was not overpassed, the forecasted scenario of a second wave

198

presenting with more intensity is more feasible than in other areas. Second, the relatively

199

small size of the Balearic Islands and the organization of health and epidemiological

200

surveillance systems make the official accounts of reported cases more reliable than in other

8

201

areas were due to low rates of testing, overloaded hospitals, and lack of centralized data

202

collection hampered the initial estimates.

203
204

The implications of the forecasted potential second wave yielded by our model for an insular

205

territory can be useful also for other areas that either naturally geographically isolated or

206

closed to external perturbations due to strict lockdowns. According to our results, the date of

207

the first infection and the import of cases while the airports and ports were open appear to be

208

key to assess the likelihood and intensity of future waves and outbreaks. Knowing the

209

approximate date of infection of the first reported case in an outbreak proved critical to

210

estimate the current and foreseen number of cases. Whether a second wave occurs and the

211

intensity of the peak strongly depended on the date of the first infection, as the number of

212

infected cases grows exponentially, but also on the number of imported cases, which

213

contribute additively to the number of cases, and also on the real herd immunization. Our

214

estimates rely on calculations assuming conditions far from the behavior of the population,

215

and on the habits, for example, regarding hygiene, the use of masks, and social distancing, of

216

the population after the lockdown is relaxed.

217
218

Our model is an individual-based model for which, due to the population size, we identify

219

each inhabitant with an individual in the simulation model. This approach is different from

220

other models considering pan-mixing and ordinary differential equations (8). Other

221

approaches implement recurrent mobility (3,19,20), which selects the individuals that perform

222

the commuting randomly at each iteration step, thus increasing the mixing in the complete

223

population. Our approach assigns a residence and a working municipality as initial condition

224

and these locations remain unchanged during the time evolution for the model. Our

225

implementation assumes that the same person commutes between two locations and thus it

226

has to be fixed initially in the model. A random selection at each day will increase the

227

number of effective connections, which could be compensated by a reduction in the

228

transmission probability. We believe this approach is more comprehensive and better

229

captures the reality of commuting under home confinement conditions, which essentially

230

limit mobility from households to workplaces for those individuals that cannot work at

231

distance or are not exempted from any work under the regulations of each country, while the

232

rest of the population are not supposed to move from the vicinity of their households and

233

even so just for justified reasons as basic food supply. We use here a stochastic approach

234

similar to other works (19,21) which lets us compute confidence intervals even for single

235

combinations of the parameters instead of deterministic ordinary differential equations

236

(8,22,23) or discrete-time dynamic equations (3). We also use a fixed time for the transit

237

through the E, I, and D compartments, Tlat, Tinf, and TD respectively. We believe this approach

238

is more realistic than an approach based on rates, where individuals transit the compartments

239

at a given rate, giving rise to exponentially distributed times of transit through the

240

compartments. In this case, infected will have the opportunity to be infectious immediately,

241

or to transit the I compartment also immediately, bringing the start of secondary infections

242

closer to the time they were infected for many individuals. A similar effect happens with the

243

length of the disease (time in the D compartment), having then individuals that immediately

244

recover.

245
246

The model also has several limitations. First, as it is constructed for fitting the global

247

numbers of infected patients, it is missing finer structure, needed for the evaluation of risks of

248

subpopulations that are differently exposed to the virus or have different outcomes, such as

249

the population of elderly people or health workers. Second, for COVID-19 there is evidence

250

of three main transmission channels, namely direct contact with an infected individual with

10

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.03.20089623; this version posted May 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

251

symptoms (14), contacts with an asymptomatic individual (24,25), and environmental

252

transmission (26). The present model takes into account the first two modes of transmission,

253

but not the environmental one explicitly, although probably the fitting has assigned part of

254

this transmission to the processes included in our model. Therefore, there is not a direct way

255

of measuring the effect of interventions to reduce environmental transmission. Third, the

256

model also considers asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals to be infectious in the same

257

way, although the viral shedding in asymptomatic individuals is indeed lower (5). This can

258

have a mild impact on the number of infected individuals that the model predicts. Fourth, the

259

model assumes that the mobility restrictions are applied in the same way to all of the agents

260

in the system and thus is lacking the fact that symptomatic infected individuals will modify

261

their mobility drastically, either if they are quarantined at home or admitted to a hospital. We

262

are therefore overestimating mobility, but this is probably passed to the infectivity in the

263

fitting procedure. Fifth, the model also takes fixed times to transit through the E, I, and D

264

compartments (Tlat, Tinf and TD, respectively), which is artificial. More refined models would

265

take this transit times from specified distributions matching the parameters of the disease

266

(21,23). While this will render the model a more realistic approach, we believe that fixing the

267

times is a good compromise between using rates for transiting the compartments and

268

implementing distributions for those times, as it already captures the delays induced by these

269

particular timings of the infection. Finally, the model also assumes that individuals are

270

granted immunity to the virus, at least for the timescales explored here.

271
272

In conclusion, the risk of secondary infection waves should be comprehensively and

273

cautiously addressed before removing confinement measures. Our study provides several

274

relevant findings that could be useful to support policy design at avoiding second waves once

275

measures to return to the societal usual activities start to be applied. First, the isolation of

276

asymptomatic individuals that tested positive for COVID-19 and close contacts to infected

277

individuals during the prior two weeks might reduce the number of new infections after the

278

establishment of the usual activity by preventing dissemination from asymptomatic carriers

279

during the incubation period. This requires proper testing strategies tailored according to the

280

estimated prevalence of infection, population density, the openness of the community, and

281

other relevant factors. Second, contact tracing measures are crucial, and digital tools might

282

enhance the identification of high-risk individuals to be tested or preemptively isolated (27).

283

Yet, data privacy and other relevant ethical considerations should be carefully balanced when

284

designing contact tracing in the community. Third, progressive return to the normal activity

285

instead of an abrupt change will facilitate the monitoring of new cases and may avoid a sharp

286

growth of the number of infected individuals, which is expected when herd immunity has not

287

been reached. Further modeling studies on second-waves of COVID-19 are warranted to

288

strengthen the knowledge on the best theoretical assumptions and data to be used to increase

289

forecasting precision. In addition, these models should be validated through real-world data

290

as these are collected during and after the pandemic.

Data

295

Population data for the 67 municipalities in the Balearic Islands were taken from the Instituto

296

Nacional de Estadística (INE, Spain), which gathers all the census data (11). The census also

297

provides the commuting flows for people that, according to the registry, are living in one

298

municipality and work in another. This allows assigning a living location and working

299

location to each individual. For small municipalities, these commuting fluxes are not

300

included. We avoid the isolation of these municipalities considering commuting flows of 10

301

people towards each of the neighboring municipalities and Palma, the capital of Balearic

302

Islands.

303
304

Data for the active infected and accumulated infected cases are obtained from the Ministry of

305

Health (12). In particular, the official reports provide data on the accumulated number of

306

infected, healed, and deaths. The number of active infected cases is taken as the number of

307

accumulated infected and subtracting deaths and healed. Unfortunately, the values for healed

308

cases are only reported from March 22nd. Thus for the fitting, we only considered values

309

starting from March 22nd.

310
311

Model

312

The relatively small population size of the Balearic Islands allows us to develop an

313

individual-based model. Each individual is placed in one of 67 municipalities according to

314

the census (Figure S1). The mobility between municipalities is considered with commuting

315

data from the 2011 census provided by the INE (11). For each simulation day, we consider

316

two steps, one where each individual is located in its residence municipality, and a second

317

step where each individual is placed in the working place. At each step, individuals can

318

interact with any of the individuals placed at the same location. The locations assignment is

319

made by randomly selecting a residence and a working place respecting the populations from

320

the data. This assignment is done initially and such positions remain unchanged during the

321

time evolution of the model.

322
323

The states of the individuals correspond to a SEIDR model: S, susceptible; E, exposed,

324

corresponding to the latent period; I, infectious, corresponding to the presymptomatic

325

infective period; D, diseased, corresponding to be infective with or without symptoms; and R,

326

recovered. The transitions between these states are as follows, S becomes E in contact with

327

an infected (I orDI) with probability β. After Tlat (latent period) days, E becomes I; after Tinf

328

(presymptomatic infective period) days I becomes D, and after Tdis (disease), D becomes R.

329
330

The values of Tlat, Tinf, and Tdis were obtained from the time evolution of the number of active

331

infected and accumulated infected cases in the Balearic Islands. The lockdown was imposed

332

in Spain on March 16th and the effect of the mobility restrictions can be identified on March

333

22nd. The 6 days in this period are reflected in the condition Tlat + Tinf (Figure S2A). Finally,

334

from the data on the accumulated number of infected, the change in slope is observed on

335

April 2nd, that is, Tdis= 12 days (Figure S2B).

336
337

To implement the mobility restrictions, we observe from the data that the accumulated

338

number of infected shows a bending every 7 days approximately, which is in accordance with

339

the beginning of the lockdown, and the restriction imposed on March 15th, and later

340

corrected on March 22nd and March 29th. Thus the model has the freedom to adjust the

341

infection probability every week after March 15th.

343
344

For a single day, the modeling proceeds as follows,
-

1. First, it considers the population in their residence location, for each municipality

345

pairs of individuals in the same municipality are selected, say i and j. Then, i updates

346

his/her state according to the dynamic rules. For each municipality p, Np pairs are

347

chosen randomly where Np is the population size of the municipality p.

348

-

2. Second, we consider the individuals distributed in the municipalities of work. For

349

each municipality p’, we chose Np’ pairs of random individuals working in the same

350

municipality p’.

351

-

3. Resume from 1.

352

Thus, on average, in a day, each individual is updated once.

353

For calibration, the model is run exploring all the parameters:

354

-

Tlat + Tinf = 6

355

-

Tdis = 12

356

and β is explored in the range [0,1] in the following periods:

357

-

β1 from the origin of the infection on February 9th to March 15th,

358

-

β2 from March 16th to March 22nd,

359

-

β3 from March 23th to March 29th,

360

-

β4 from March 30th to April 5th,

361

-

β5 from April 7th to April 11th

362
363

The total number of infected depends on the date of the first infection. Models assume that

364

the beginning of the outbreak is typically 30 days before the day when 10 infections are

365

recorded (28). In the case of the Balearic Islands, on March 8th, 11 confirmed cases were

366

reported. The first case reported in the Balearic Islands corresponds to an imported infection

367

notified on February 9th. Consequently, the beginning of the outbreak was set on February

15

368

7th, two days before the first infected was identified. Thus, we explore the date of the

369

beginning of the infection between Jan 28th and Feb 7th.

370
371

Model validation

372

The results of the model are validated with the official number of active infected and the

373

accumulated number of infected cases between March 15th and April 11th. As the official

374

values do not take into account the non-tested asymptomatic and the diseased not consulting

375

to the healthcare systems, we assume that the reported values are a proportion of the values

376

obtained from the model. Then, to validate the model parameters we minimize χ2, χ2= Σ (α Yi

377

- yi)2, where α is a scale factor, that is, the ration between estimated and confirmed cases, Yi is

378

the value obtained from the model in day i, and yi is the official value in day i. Due to the

379

initial exponential growth of the epidemics, we calculate χ2 for the logarithm of the cases:

380

χ2= Σ (log(α Yi) - log(yi))2. The minimization of χ2 leads to an optimal scale factor log(α*)

381

=1/n Σ (log(yi / Yi)). For this value of α*, we finally calculate the optimal values. Our

382

assumption implies that the scale factor should be similar to both the active and accumulated

383

infected.

384
385

For each set of parameters, we report the χ2 of the model values of the number of active

386

infected cases with respect to the official values, the correction fraction αactive, and the χ2acc of

387

the model values of the number of accumulated infected individuals with respect to the

388

official vales and the correction fraction αacc. For each set of parameters, the best fit is

389

considered as the one leading to the minimum χ2. Once the fitting values are determined, we

390

calculate χ2acc and αacc For each set of periods (Tlat, Tinf, Tdis), we explore the infection

391

probabilities that minimize χ2 of the number of active infected cases. The value of χ2 and

395

Herd immunity assumptions

396

An approximation to the herd immunity threshold is given by 1-1/R0 (29), which for COVID-

397

19 is expected to be between 29 and 74%, taking R0 between 1.4 and 3.9 (14,30). To explore

398

whether the number of accumulated infections reach the herd immunity threshold and

399

therefore avoidance of potential second waves is to be expected, we run the model for the

400

same parameters leading to the best fit (29). After the system has relaxed to zero infection, we

401

select a random susceptible from the populations and infected her. As we are interested in

402

whether the epidemics will spread again, we use the transmission rate obtained at the

403

beginning of the epidemics in the Balearic Islands, that is, before any restriction on mobility

404

had been applied. We can expect that once the mobility restrictions have been removed, the

405

transmission will be reduced in comparison to the initial values, especially due to an

406

improvement in the hygiene of the population. This will affect how fast the COVID-19 will

407

spread and the intensity of the wave. If the estimated number of infected is lower than the

408

threshold for herd immunization, we assume that the COVID-19 will spread. In the

409

Supplementary Material, we show how the data can be collapsed using a proper combination

410

of the initial number of infected cases and the time of the first infection.

Fig. 1. Active and cumulative infected time series in the Balearic Islands. Time evolution

591

of the average number of (A) active infected cases (black line) and (B) accumulated number

592

of cases with the best-fitted parameters, and confidence interval CI 90% (grey area). Red dots

593

represent the data provided by the Ministry of Health of Spain, and the solid lines depict the

594

model with the fitted parameters Tlat= 2, Tinf=4, Tdis=12, β1=0.24, β2=0.12, β3=0.016,

595

β4=0.036, β5=0.

Fig. 2. Secondary outbreak appearing after the home-based confinement is removed.

598

The lockdown is removed and the parameter values are as during the week of March 16th-

599

22nd. (A) First infected case is on February 7th, the number of infected in the first wave has

600

not reached herd immunization and a second wave is triggered by a single infected case. The

601

intensity of the second wave is one order of magnitude larger than the first. (B) First infected

602

case is on January 28th, the number of infected in the first wave has reached a larger fraction

603

of the population and the intensity of the second wave is, in the scenario, smaller than the

604

first. Average over 100 realizations.

Fig. 3. Fraction of infected individuals (in logarithmic scale) as a function of the date of

607

the first infection. (A) Each line corresponds to the following parameter values(Tlat,

608

Tinf)=(1,5) (black), (2,4) (red), (3,33 (orange), (4,2) (magenta), and (5,1) (blue). (B) Fraction

609

of infected cases as a function of the first infection and the initial number of infected

610

individuals. The radius of the symbol is proportional to the fraction of infected cases while

611

the color indicates the probability that a realization of the model reaches at least 50% of

612

infected cases in the population, P50.
