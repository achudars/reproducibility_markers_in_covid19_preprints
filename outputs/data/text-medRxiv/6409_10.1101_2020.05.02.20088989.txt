Abstract
During the outbreak of an epidemic, it is of immense interest to monitor the effects
of containment measures and forecast of outbreak including epidemic peak. To confront
the epidemic, a simple SIR model is used to simulate the number of affected patients
of Coronavirus disease in Romania and Pakistan. The model captures the growth in
case onsets and the estimated results are almost compatible with the actual reported
cases. Through the calibration of parameters, forecast for the appearance of new cases
in Romania and Pakistan is reported till the end of this year by analysing the current
situation. The constant level of number of patients and time-to-reach this level is also
reported through the simulations. The drastic condition is also discussed which may occur
if all the preventive restraints are removed.
Keywords: COVID-19, SIR Model, Estimation of parameters, Forecast of COVID-19.

Introduction

In December (2019), the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission (Hubei Province, China) informed to World Health Organization (WHO) about a group of 27 cases of unknown etiology
pneumonia, who were commonly exposed to a fish and live animals market in Wuhan City. It
was also notified that seven of these patients were critically serious. The symptoms of the first

case began on December 8, 2019. On January 7, 2020, Chinese authorities identified a new type
of family virus as the agent causing the outbreak. The causative agent of this pneumonia was
identified as a new virus in the Coronaviridae family that has since been named SARS–CoV–2.
The clinical picture associated with this virus has been named COV ID − 19. On march 11,
WHO declared the global pandemic [1]. The worldwide reported cases of COV ID − 19 are ∼ 3
million with nearly 0.2 million deaths.
Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause infection in humans and some animals. Diseases by coronavirus are zoonotic, that is, they can be transmitted from animals to humans [2].
Coronaviruses that affect humans (HCoV) can produce clinical symptoms from the common
cold to serious ones like those caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) viruses
and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS–CoV) [3]. The transmission mechanisms of
SARS-COV-2 are animal–human and human–human. The first one is still unknown, but some
researchers affirm that it could be through respiratory secretions and/or material from the
digestive system. The second one, is considered similar for other Coronaviruses through the
secretions of infected people, mainly by direct contact with respiratory drops and hands or
fomites contaminated with these secretions, followed by contact with the mucosa of the mouth,
nose or eyes [4].
Modeling is a science of creative capabilities connected with a profound learning in a variety
of strategies to represent physical phenomena in the form of mathematical relations. In the
prevailing situation, agencies, which control the diseases and maintain all the data of diseases,
are publishing data of Covid-19 on daily bases. This data includes number of people having
positive corona test, number of deaths, number of recoveries and active number of cases, and
also commulative data from all over the world. So, appropriate model, with much accuracy, is
needed at this level. Low dimensional models, with small number of compartments and having
parameters which can be determined with the real data with good precision, are better to study
and forecast the pandemic [5]. A high dimensions model requires a huge number of parameters
to describe it but this huge number of parameters can not be found with enough precision [6].
In the absence of details, compartmental epidemic models describing the average behavior of
the system can be a starting point. Even the simplest models contain several variables, which
are hard to determine from the available data. The minimal SIR model describes the behavior
of the susceptible S(t), the infected I(t), and the removed (recovered or deceased) R(t) populations [7, 8]. Numerous models have been published on COVID-19 [9–15]. To the best of our
knowledge, it has not been focused on the implications of mathematical model to guess the
future trend of COVID-19 disease in Romania as well as in Pakistan. Thus the present study
is taken to fill this gap.
To estimate the early dynamics of COVID-19 infection in Romania and Pakistan, we modeled the transmission through a deterministic SIR model. We are choosing the SIR model
because in present situation worldwide data contains the infectious patients, recovered and
deaths only, so from that data we can have average death rate and recovery. We estimate
the size of the epidemic for both countries. We also forecast the maximum level of COVID-19
patients and time period for approaching the endemic level through model simulations. The
dreadful effects of the pandemic, if precautionary measures or social distancing were ended, has
also been analysed. We also perform the sensitivity analysis of the parameters by varying the
values of transmission rate, disease-related death rate, recovery rate and the inhibition effect.

Structure of the Model

In an SIR type model, the total population is partitioned into three categories, the susceptible
(S), the infectious (I), and the recovered (R). If the homogeneous mixing of people is assumed,
the mathematical form of the model is given as:
dS
βIS
= µ−
− µS,
dt
1 + νI
dI
βIS
=
− (α + µ + δ)I,
dt
1 + νI
dR
= αI − µR.
dt

(1)

In the above model, we assume that birth and death rate is equal and is denoted by µ. The
parameter β is the transmission rate as a result of the contact of susceptible individuals with
βIS
the infected ones. The incidence term is assumed to be nonlinear and is represented as 1+νI
.
The parameter ν represents the inhibition effect or precautions that have been adopted to
prevent the mixing of susceptible and infectious individuals. We assume that the recovery rate
of infectious individuals is α and δ is the disease-related death rate.

Case Study for Romania

The coronavirus 2019-20 (COVID-19) pandemic was affirmed to have arrived in Romania on 26th
February of this year [16]. Due to the spread of coronary disease in Italy, the government of Romania reported two weeks of isolation, starting from 21st February, for its residents which were
coming back from the influenced regions [17]. On the very next day, the Romanian government
declared a few preventive measures, including assignment of five clinics as separation-habitats
for new cases, arrangement of warm scanners on airport terminals, and uniquely assigned lines
for travelers originating from zones influenced by COVID-19 outbreak [18]. For avoiding the
virus expansion several steps were taken by the government like on 9th March the authorities
reported discontinuance of trips to and from Italy via all terminals [19] also the Special National
Emergency Situations Committee ordered to close all schools on the same day. Two days later,
on 11th March, the Government distributed a rundown of the fifteen rules in regards to the
mindful social conduct in forestalling the spread of COVID-19 [20]. Specialists have forced a
prohibition on all religious, scientific, sports, social or diversion occasions with more than 100
members for the next three weeks.
The number of affected people crossed the first hundred at the end of the second week of March.
The first three deaths were announced in Romania on 22nd March. All three deceased were
already suffering from different diseases such as diabetes, dialysis, and lung cancer, etc. [21].
Following a flood of new affirmed cases, on March 24, the administration declared Military
Ordinance, establishing a national lock-down and bringing in the military to help police and
the Gendarmerie in authorizing the new limitations. Developments outside the homes was
strictly prohibited, with certain exemptions (work, purchasing nourishment or medication, and
so forth.). Old people over 65 years were permitted to leave their homes just between 11 a.m.1 p.m. [22]. Two days after this, on March 26, the National airline also suspended all local
flights [23].
Total population of the Romania is about 19, 237, 691 [24]. The average life expectancy for
people of Romania is 76 years [25]. One can see from the model (1) that we are involving
disease-related death and immunity, so we have to fit our model with active real cases, active

means no disease-related death, and no recovery. So, initially, we have 3 active cases on March
5, 2020. Hence, our initial conditions are I(0) = 3 and R(0) = 3 and rest are the susceptible.
We have simulated our model and fit with the real cases. Figure (2) portrays the fitting of our
model (1) with the real data given in figure (1).
By observing the figure (2), one can compare the actual data reported by [26] and the data
collected by the simple SIR model (1) given in section 2. We can see number of active cases
are almost matching with the actual ones. We also estimate number of COVID-19 patients
that will appear in next duration. It can be observed, from figure (2), that infection is continuously spreading un till August, 2020. After this period the malady is going to stable under
the current situation. Note that here we have taken the average rate and disease related death
rate per day up to April 30,2020. According to our estimate, there is no chance of vanishing
the disease from community if the average daily and unfortunately disease related death rate
is going on with the same rate. From figure (2), we can see that the number of patients will
be ∼ 10091 by the 31st May, on June 28th patients will be ∼ 11127 and by the end of this year
number will reach at ∼ 12000. Week wise expected number of patients for the next months of
this year is shown in Table 1.

Variation in the Number of Patients with the Variation of Parameters

According to reported data, it has been observed that average weekly recovery rate and disease
related death rate vary. The maximum average recovery rate happened between (1 − 7) March
and it is 5.71%. During the week (29 March-4 April), minimum average recovery rate has
been observed and its value is 3.5%. Similarly average disease related death rate varies every
week. Its minimum value occurred between (12 April-18 April) which is 0.32%. The maximum
average number of deaths per day appeared during the week (29 March-4 April) and its value is
0.7%. We vary the values of recovery and disease related death rates by observing this pattern
and estimate the number of patients that will appear in the later weeks of this year. Similarly
we increase and decrease the values of transmission rate and inhibition effect up to 25% and
50% and also estimate the number of COVID-19 cases. The effect of the transmission rate
(β), the death rate due to COVID-19 (δ), recovery rate (α) and the inhibition or precautionary
measures (ν) on the number of COVID-19 patients have been calculated and shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3: Variation in the number of active patients on transmission rate β, recovery
rate α, death rate δ and the inhibition effect ν.
In Figure 3a, we present the dependency of the number of patients on the transmission rate
β. The transmission rate is measured by the number of people get infected due to a source of
COVID-19. For example β = 0.1 means every 10% people, per day, get infected. We can see
from Figure 3a that the number of patients accelerates as β increases. The model fitted value
for β is 0.396 and for that value, the number of patients by the end of this year will be ∼ 12000.
Since the transmission rate may vary for next duration, so we have estimated the number of
patients by varying the value of β upto 25% and 50%. For β = 0.2, the number of patients by
the end of this year decreases to ∼ 2364. For β = 0.3, this number will be ∼ 4046. For β = 0.5
the number of patients will be ∼ 7400 and for β = 0.6 the number of patients will be ∼ 9100.
Week wise number of patients for each value of β are given in Table 2.
We next present our results, in Figure 3c, for the death rate dependence (δ) of the total
number of COVID-19 patients. δ it is the total number of patients who died, per day, due
to COVID-19 disease. δ = 0.001 means one patient dies, per day, in every thousand patients.
Since all the other parameters are fixed, the trend of δ dependence is: higher the δ lower the
number of active patients. As we know that δ varies day by day so we have plotted for five
different values of δ ranging from 0.003 to 0.006 as the model fitted value of δ turns out to be
0.003. The total number of active patients by the end of this year ranges from 7000 − 6000 for
this range of δ. Week wise number of active patients for the different values of δ are given in
Table 3.
In Figure 3b, we present our results for the change in the total number of active patients
as a function of recovery rate of infected patients α. As for the β and δ, α is also measured

as a ratio per day. α = 0.01 means everyone out of hundred COVID-19 patients get recovered,
per day. Definition of α infers the trend of the number of patients as a function of α: higher
the value of α means lower the number of active COVID-19 patients. The model fitted value
of α is 0.056. In Figure 3b, we have plotted for five different values of α including the model
fitted one also. The other values of α that we have chosen are α = 0.013, 0.056, 0.058. The
total number of active patients by the end of this year ranges from ∼ 5613 to ∼ 23812. Weekly
details of the number of patients as a function of α is given in Table 4.
In Figure 3d, we present our results for the number of patients as a function of the inhibitory
effect ν. The model fitted value of ν is 19019.1. Since this number can also vary, we have taken
four other values of ν in Figure 3d. Since ν is proportional to the precautionary measures
adopted by the COVID-19 patients along with the general population, higher values of ν means
lower the number of active patients. The values that we have chosen for ν other than the model
fitted value are ν = 9509.6, 14264.3, 23733.9. We can see in Figure 3d that the total number
of COVID-19 patients ranges from 4591 − 11395. Weekly data for the number of COVID-19
patients as a function of five different values of ν is given in Table 5.

3.2

Dreadful Effects of Removal of Social Distancing and Precautionary Measures

According to the present recovery rate, disease-related death rate, and estimated values of
transmission rate, we observe that if we remove the social distancing and adopted precautionary
measures then the worst effects appear in the population. Almost ∼ 55% population will be
infected up to 31st May and then infected people will begin to decrease. Note that this situation
will according to the current position. It means that it will happen only according to current
transmission rate, recovery rate, disease related death rate. However, the situation may vary
with the variation of these parameters. The epidemic curve without any barrier is shown in
Fig. 4.

COVID-19 Case Study in Pakistan

The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic was affirmed to have arrived at Pakistan on
February 26, 2020. The first patient has been observed in Sindh Province and the second is in
the federal territory of the country [27]. Within a week of appearance of initial two cases, this
pandemic started to increase other areas of the country. On 29th April 2020, the quantity of
affirmed cases in the nation is 15759, with 4052 (25.7% of the commulative cases)recuperation
and 346 (2.2% of the commulative cases) deceased and Punjab is, right now, the area with the
most elevated number of cases at over 6000 [28].
In figure (5), we have plotted only active cases with recovered and deaths from 26 of Feb, 2020
to 29 of April, 2020.
Currently Pakistan has, approximately, a total population of 220 millions [29] and life expectancy is 67 years [30]. As, we have included the disease related death and immunity in our
proposed model (1) so this is telling us that we have to fit our model with the active cases of
real data (deaths and recoveries are excluded), figure (6) is portraying the fitting of our model
with real data, given in figure (5), from 1st of March, 2020 to 29 of April, 2020. The initial
values are I(0) = 4, R(0) = 0 and the rest of the population is susceptible. In figure, we have
compared week wise data and then extended this week wise data till 31 Dec., 2020 to forecast
the Covid-19 cases in Pakistan. According to the figure (6), there will be ∼ 30000 by the end
of May, 2020 and at the end of August this number would be ∼ 50000. Week wise expected
number of patients for the next months of this year is shown in Table 7.

4.1

Variation in the number of Covid-19 patients by changing the
values of parameters

In this section, we will see that how the number of active cases of Covid-19 vary if we change
the values of parameters. Figure (7) is depicting the effect of variations in parameters on the
number of active Covid-19 cases.

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

Figure 7: Variation in the number of active patients on transmission rate β, death
rate δ, recovery rate α and the inhibition effect ν.
Figure 7a represents the dependence of number of patients on the variation of transmission
rate β. This rate tells that how many people are getting infection per day. For example if
β = 0.097 then it means that 97 people are getting infection per day per 1000 people. We
have taken five different values of β including the model fitted value β = 0.194, we can see that
by increasing the transmission rate number of cases are also increasing as expected, Table 8
contains all the possible number of patients for different values of β.
Next, we will check the dependence of number of active cases on recovery rate, α. It is the
rate which tells that how many people are getting immunity from this disease. For example if
α = 0.001 then it means that out of 1000 people one person is recoverd per day. We have taken
four different values of α, one is our model fitted value which is α = 0.015 and three from the
real data [28], by observing the real data we perceived that average recovery rate is maximum
for the week 19th − 25th April, 2020 which is 0.037 and minimum for the week 15th − 21st April,
2020 which is 0.001, so we have considered these two values and fourth is the average of 0.037
and 0.001. Figure 7b represents the trend of active cases depending on α, we can see that

number of Covid-19 cases is inversely proportional to the recovery rate α, which makes sense.
All the possible number of cases for all these values of α are given in Table 9.
Next, we will see that how the death rate δ effects the number of Covid-19 cases. It is the rate
which tells that how many people die from this disease. For example if δ = 0.007 then it means
that out of 1000 people seven people die per day. We have taken four different values of δ, one
is our model fitted value which is δ = 0.00703844071 and three from the real data [28]. We have
seen that average death rate is minimum for the week 19th − 25th April, 2020 which is 0.004
and maximum for the week 15th − 21st April, 2020 which is 0.00122985. Fourth is 0.0008, it is
the average of 0.004 and 0.001. Figure 7c is depicting the number of active cases as a function
of δ. In the Table 10, we have calculated the number of Covid-19 cases for all these values of δ.
In Figure 7d, we present our results for the number of patients as a function of the inhibition
effect ν. The model fitted value of ν is 30072. Since this number can also vary, we have taken
four other values of ν in Figure 7d. Since ν is proportional to the precautionary measures
adopted by the COVID-19 patients along with the general population, higher values of ν means
lower the number of active patients. The values that we have chosen for ν other than the model
fitted value are ν = 15036.1, 22554.2, 37590.2, 45108.3. We can see in Figure 7d that the total
number of COVID-19 patients ranges from 5500 − 8000. The per day data for number of
COVID-19 patients as a function of five different values of ν is given in Table 11.

4.2

Dreadful Effects of Removal of Social Distancing and Precautionary Measures

We know that the major factor to aviod from the Covid-19 are social distancing and precautionary measures, in our model we have considered ν as this major factor. Now, if we have the
present scenario and we consider do not take care of ν then we can see from the figure that
almost 33% population of the whole country will be infected till 19th of July, 2020 and this is
the peak of infection after this it will start decreasing, we have shown the calculated results are
given in Table 12.

Conclusion

In this study, we used a mathematical model to assess the feasibility of the appearance of
COVID-19 cases in Romania and Pakistan as well as the ultimate number of patients according
to the current situation. By comparing model outcomes with the confirmed cases, it has been
observed that our estimated values have good correspondence with the confirmed numbers. If
the current pattern is going on then, according to our estimate, there will be ∼ 12000 infectious
individuals in Romania by the end of this year. Pakistan will bear the burden of ∼ 55800 till
the end of December, 2020. The situation will vary by the variation of transmission rate, death
rate, recovery rate, and further implementation of social distancing in both countries. It has
been observed that average weekly recovery rate and average weekly disease related death vary
for both countries.
If the transmission rate in Romania increases 50% and recovery rate and disease related death
rate is taken for 30th April, according to reported data, then there will be ∼ 9000 persons
carrying Corona malady and if this rate decreases 50%, then 2364 infected persons will exist
in the Romanian community by the end of this year. If we take previous average maximum
weekly recovery rate and disease related death rate, then there will be ∼ 5613 and ∼ 5301,
patients, respectively in Romania. Similarly, by assuming minimum weekly average recovery
and disease related death rate will result ∼ 23812 and ∼ 5724, respectively. The inhibition
effect or precautionary measures also influence in the spreading of pandemic. If the inhibition
factor increases upto 50%, then ∼ 4951 patients will be existing in Romania till the end of this
year. This number will exceed to ∼ 11395, if precautionary measures decreases to 50%. The
worst effects of the disease appear in the community, if we remove all the barriers. In such
case, this malady may increase by effecting ∼ 55% population till the end of this month. This
number will start to decrease after May.
Increase or decrease in transmission rate will also results in decrease or increase in the number

of COVID-19 patients in Pakistan. If the transmission rate increases 50% and recovery rate and
disease related death rate is taken for 28th April, according to reported data, then there will
be ∼ 28708 persons having Corona disease and if this rate decreases 50%, then 4723 infected
persons will exist among Pakistanis by the end of this year. If we take previous average
maximum weekly recovery rate and disease related death rate, then there will be ∼ 16716 and
∼ 815, patients, respectively in Pakistan. Similarly, by assuming minimum weekly average
recovery and disease related death rate will result ∼ 138611 and ∼ 16716, respectively. The
inhibition effect or precautionary measures also influence in the spreading of pandemic. If the
inhibition factor increases upto 50%, then ∼ 11149 patients will be existing in Pakistan till the
end of this year. This number will exceed to ∼ 33387, if precautionary measures decreases to
50%. The worst effects of the disease appear in the community, if we remove all the barriers. In
such case, this infection may increase by effecting ∼ 33% population till the end of this month.
This number will start to decrease after May, 2020.
Although these estimates may vary with the passage of time but it will really help us to observe
the most influential factors that causes to increase the epidemic. On the basis of this analysis
competent authorities may design the most effective strategies in order to control the epidemic.
