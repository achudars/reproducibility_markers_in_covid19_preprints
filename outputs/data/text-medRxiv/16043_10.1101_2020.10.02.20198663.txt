ABSTRACT
Background: As in many countries, quantifying COVID-19 spread in Indonesia remains
challenging due to testing limitations. In Java, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were
implemented throughout 2020. However, as a vaccination campaign launches, cases and deaths
are rising across the island.
Methods: We used modelling to explore the extent to which data on burials in Jakarta using
strict COVID-19 protocols (C19P) provide additional insight into the transmissibility of the
disease, epidemic trajectory, and the impact of NPIs. We assess how implementation of NPIs
in early 2021 will shape the epidemic during the period of likely vaccine roll-out.
Results: C19P burial data in Jakarta suggest a death toll approximately 3.3 times higher than
reported. Transmission estimates using these data suggest earlier, larger, and more sustained
impact of NPIs. Measures to reduce sub-national spread, particularly during Ramadan,
substantially mitigated spread to more vulnerable rural areas. Given current trajectory, daily
cases and deaths are likely to increase in most regions as the vaccine is rolled-out. Transmission
may peak in early 2021 in Jakarta if current levels of control are maintained. However,
relaxation of control measures is likely to lead to a subsequent resurgence in the absence of an
effective vaccination campaign.
Conclusion: Syndromic measures of mortality provide a more complete picture of COVID-19
severity upon which to base decision-making. The high potential impact of the vaccine in Java
is attributable to reductions in transmission to date and dependent on these being maintained.
Increases in control in the relatively short-term will likely yield large, synergistic increases in
vaccine impact.

Key questions
What is already known?
•

In many settings, limited SARS-CoV-2 testing makes it difficult to estimate the true
trajectory and associated burden of the virus.

•

Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are key tools to mitigate SARS-CoV-2
transmission.

•

Vaccines show promise but effectiveness depends upon prioritization strategies, roll-out
and uptake.

What are the new findings?
•

This study gives evidence of the value of syndrome-based mortality as a metric, which is
less dependent upon testing capacity with which to estimate transmission trends and
evaluate intervention impact.

•

NPIs implemented in Java earlier in the pandemic have substantially slowed the course of
the epidemic with movement restrictions during Ramadan preventing spread to more
vulnerable rural populations.

•

Population-level immunity remains below proposed herd-immunity thresholds for the
virus, though it is likely substantially higher in Jakarta.

What do the new findings imply?
•

Given current levels of control, upwards trends in deaths are likely to continue in many
provinces while the vaccine is scheduled to be rolled out. A key exception is Jakarta where
population-level immunity may increase to a level where the epidemic begins to decline
before the vaccine campaign has reached high coverage.

•

Further relaxation of measures would lead to more rapidly progressing epidemics, depleting
the eventual incremental effectiveness of the vaccine. Maintaining adherence to control
measures in Jakarta may be particularly challenging if the epidemic enters a decline phase
but will remain necessary to prevent a subsequent large wave. Elsewhere, higher levels of
control with NPIs are likely to yield high synergistic vaccine impact.

INTRODUCTION
As of 3rd February 2021, Indonesia has reported the highest number of confirmed COVID-19
cases (1,111,671) and deaths (30,770) among Southeast Asian countries.[1] Cases were first
reported in West Java province, on the island of Java, on 2nd March 2020, amid concern that
the disease had circulated widely before.[2,3] The city of Jakarta (the capital of Indonesia)
subsequently became the epicenter of the country’s epidemic, following which the disease
spread throughout the island.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have included national social distancing measures
encouraging people to work, study and worship at home (15th March)[4]; mandated social
distancing measures implemented on 10th April as part of a lockdown, named Pembatasan
Sosial Berskala Besar or PSBB in Indonesian;[4] and a ban on domestic travel during the
month of Ramadan (24th April to 7th June).[5] In June, Indonesia entered the Adaptasi
Kebiasaan Baru (AKB or ‘new normal’) period where some restrictions were lifted (online
supplementary figure S1A; 1B).[4]
During this AKB period, the reported incidence of COVID-19 cases and deaths increased
across Indonesia with community transmission evident across the six provinces of Java (online
supplementary figure 1C; 1D). PSBB was subsequently reimposed in mid-September for four
weeks in Jakarta in response to pressures on healthcare facilities across the city.[6] Cases and
deaths continued to rise in 2021, prompting further restrictions in districts across the island
from 11th January.[7] On 13th January 2021, Indonesia initiated a nationwide vaccination
campaign.[7,8]
Understanding the trajectory of the epidemic in Java has been challenging. As in many
countries,[9,10] testing constraints in Indonesia have limited the extent to which officially
confirmed cases reflect underlying trends. Similar concerns exist for mortality data, based upon
the high numbers of individuals exhibiting COVID-19 like symptoms who die before receiving
a diagnosis.[11,12] In Jakarta, such individuals are buried under strict COVID-19 protocols
(C19P). Here we use mathematical modelling approaches incorporating these data, and other
measures of suspected mortality, to better understand the dynamics and burden of the epidemic
experienced across Java to date, evaluate the impact of control measures, and understand how
these past actions will shape future burden and vaccine impact.

METHODS
Assessing SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility over time in Jakarta
Daily numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and C19P funerals[13] were used to
reconstruct daily incidence of symptom onset, using delay distributions between symptom
onset and case reporting or death derived from individual patient data obtained from the Jakarta
Department of Health (online supplementary figure S2). For each data source (cases, deaths,
and C19P funerals), 100 reconstructed time-series of daily incidence of symptom onset were
generated, with estimates also adjusted for right-censoring in individuals where outcomes had
yet to occur (online supplementary methods section S2).
These reconstructed time series were translated into estimates of the daily effective
reproduction number (𝑅𝑡,𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒 for cases, 𝑅𝑡,𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ for deaths, and 𝑅𝑡,𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙 for funerals) in
Jakarta using EpiEstim.[14,15] This package estimates 𝑅𝑡 using a branching process-based
estimator that incorporates information on the serial interval distribution and dates of onsets of
symptoms. Correlations between estimated 𝑅𝑡 and the average daily changes in non-residential
mobility[16] were assessed based on 1,000 posterior samples from each estimated 𝑅𝑡 time
series and compared using Pearson’s correlation coefficient formula.
Modelling subnational COVID-19 spread across Java
We developed a district-level metapopulation model to explore the expected spread of COVID19 across the island of Java (online supplementary methods section S5). For each district,
stochastic differential equations representing a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered
(SEIR) model were implemented. Movement matrices were derived from anonymized mobile
phone data, with separate matrices calculated for the high-migration period of Ramadan.
Disease severity parameters were adjusted to account for the demography of each district.
Transmissibility of the virus over time was calculated under the assumption that the
relationship between mobility and 𝑅𝑡 observed in Jakarta was informative across the rest of the
island, exploring multiple assumptions about the transmissibility of COVID-19 in rural districts
relative to urban districts (online supplementary table S3).
We simulated five different scenarios to assess the impact of restrictions earlier in the pandemic
in Indonesia (namely PSBB and Ramadan movement restrictions) on COVID-19 deaths and
hospitalisation rates across Java (online supplementary table S4). The baseline scenario
simulated an epidemic across Java based on the observed mobility patterns and an assumption
that longer-distance between-district movement was reduced to a greater extent than withindistrict (a further reduction of an odds ratio (OR) of two relative to pre-pandemic levels) and
severely curtailed (a 95% reduction) during Ramadan. Counter-factual scenarios for the
absence of restrictions during Ramadan, assuming no movement restrictions between-district
in place, were also simulated. Uncertainty in the incremental effect of the absence of betweendistrict movement restrictions during Ramadan on the population-level transmission was then
captured in three scenarios: a) Ramadan 1, that they had no impact (i.e., within-district
movement would remain the same as the baseline scenario in the absence of Ramadan-specific
intervention); b) Ramadan 2, they were responsible for 75% of the reduction in 𝑅𝑡 relative to

𝑅0 ; c) Ramadan 3, without restrictions, transmission would have returned to 𝑅0 levels during
Ramadan. Lastly, the unmitigated scenario simulated an epidemic across Java without
movement restrictions and without reductions in transmissibility due to behaviour change
and/or control measures.
Assessing the current province-level spread of the pandemic in Java and generating
future scenarios
To estimate the recent trajectory of the epidemic and current cumulative levels of spread within
each province, we adapted an existing modelling framework allowing the relationship between
mobility and transmission to vary over time.[9] This allows us to capture the observed
decoupling between aggregated movement patterns and burden in the ‘new normal’ period and
simulate scenarios of future spread within each province. We fit this modelling framework both
to officially reported COVID-19 deaths, as well as estimated suspected deaths, which include
deaths of probable cases (i.e., patients with clinical criteria or chest imaging suggestive of
COVID-19), which have been published by WHO Indonesia.[4] As the published suspected
deaths data are only available on a weekly basis between 1st June to 29th November 2020, we
augmented the data to reflect the entire time-period of the epidemic based upon the proportion
of all suspected deaths (i.e., probable and confirmed) that were confirmed by each province in
the period covered by the WHO situation reports (online supplementary methods section S6).
Our future scenarios are projected based on a future ‘reproduction number under control’, 𝑅𝑐 ,
defined similarly to 𝑅0 as the average number of secondary infections within an entirely
susceptible population but incorporating the impact of NPIs (and, equivalently, 𝑅𝑡 but not
incorporating the effects of population-level immunity such that 𝑅0 > 𝑅𝑐 > 𝑅𝑡 ). We evaluated
three scenarios: a ‘current trajectory’ scenario (where the current trajectory of the epidemic
continues with approximated 𝑅𝑐 = 1.25), a ‘suppression’ scenario (where the transmission in
the population is assumed to be immediately suppressed with 𝑅𝑐 = 0.75) and an ‘unmitigated’
scenario (where the epidemic was assumed to be uncontrolled with 𝑅𝑐 = 2.00).
Our first set of projections were generated from 2nd September 2020 onwards.[17] At that time,
policymakers were attempting to understand the potential benefits of the implementation of
further NPIs, such as the reimposition of PSBB in Jakarta, which was then scheduled to be
implemented on 14th September,[6] in the context of no vaccine yet being any available. These
scenarios evaluated the potential trajectory of the epidemic throughout 2021, including the
impact of a ‘return-to-normal’ (𝑅𝑐 = 2.00) once burden had returned to low-levels (median of
simulated trajectories reached less than 7 cumulative deaths over 7 days period).
Our current set of projections are generated from 7th December and in the context of an
imminent vaccine campaign. Given the large remaining uncertainties in roll-out and
effectiveness, we do not incorporate any role of the vaccine. Instead, we aim to understand how
different scenarios involving NPIs over the next few weeks and months will shape the potential
longer-term effectiveness of future strategies in which vaccines will likely feature as a major
component. To do this, we evaluate how both the number of lives lost, and number of lives that
remain to be saved is likely to change incrementally by month according to the same future

RESULTS
Understanding initial establishment, transmission, and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in
Jakarta
Figure 1A shows the daily reported cases, deaths, test positivity ratios, and funerals with C19P
in Jakarta, transformed into inferred dates of symptom onset using the relevant delay
distributions (figure 1B). We estimate that 31 (22-41 95% CrI) and 124 (107-139 95% CrI)
confirmed deaths and C19P funerals (assuming all funerals represent deaths due to COVID19) had symptom onset occurring before 2nd March when COVID-19 was first identified in
Indonesia. We estimate 10,950 (7,530-14,040 95% CrI) infections based on confirmed deaths
or 42,100 (36,280-47,570 95% CrI) based on C19P funerals (reflecting an assumption that all
undiagnosed individuals with a C19P funeral would have tested positive) had occurred in
Jakarta by 2nd March.
Reported cases in Jakarta appear to indicate two epidemic peaks to date (around mid-April and
mid-September, when PSBB was imposed), with the number of cases reported during the
second peak far higher than the first (figure 1B). However, the test-positivity rate declined in
the first half of 2020, indicating increased testing rates and case-ascertainment, which
complicates the interpretation of trends based on case data alone. Indeed, data on C19P funerals
suggest that the peak in infections likely occurred in mid-March and that infection levels during
the second peak were at levels comparable to their initial peak.
Our branching-process-based estimates of 𝑅𝑡 support the substantial impact of NPIs when
applied to all three metrics. We estimate 𝑅𝑡 to be between 1.5 and 2.5 initially, subsequently
declining to below 1 during the first PSBB period, followed by a more recent increase to
slightly above 1 as Jakarta entered the transitional PSBB in early June. The reimposition of the
second PSBB in September also brought the 𝑅𝑡 to below 1 (figure 1C). Before the lifting of the
first PSBB, 𝑅𝑡 estimates show a strong and significant correlation (0.91, 0.72, and 0.92 for
cases, deaths, and C19P funerals, respectively, all with p<0.001) with observed mobility
patterns as measured by Google Mobility Reports (figure 1D). Estimates based upon funeral
trends support a more rapid, larger, and more sustained impact of interventions than those based
upon case-reporting. The correlation with within-city mobility is lowest for the deaths data,
where substantial variation in day-to-day death reporting leads to more unstable 𝑅𝑡 estimates
over time. Calculating the correlation between mobility and 𝑅𝑡 before and after the AKB period
suggests a decoupling between transmission and mobility, whereby estimates of 𝑅𝑡 during
periods of equivalent levels of mobility during AKB are lower than estimates obtained before
AKB (online supplementary figure S4).
Understanding COVID-19 risk and subnational spread of SARS-CoV-2 across Java
Substantial variations exist across the island in terms of demography, healthcare capacity, and
between-district mobility. The proportion of individuals over the age of 50 is typically higher
(26%) in rural districts than urban ones (19%) (figure 2A). There are also substantial disparities
in healthcare availability, ranging from the comparatively well-resourced Jakarta setting (2.22
hospital beds per thousand population) to the poorer, more rural setting of Tasikmalaya in West

Java (0.18 hospital beds per thousand population) (figure 2B). Patterns of between-district
mobility outside of the window of the pandemic, estimated using mobile phone data over the
period of 1st May 2011 - 30th April 2012, highlight the extent to which these settings are
connected. Between-district connectivity is particularly high during the Ramadan period, with
large-scale movements from densely populated Jakarta to other more rural regions with lower
availability of healthcare (figure 2C; 2D). Applying our modelled relationship between
mobility and 𝑅𝑡 obtained from the Jakarta C19P funeral data (figure 2E) to trends in mobility
data from the remaining provinces in Java suggests large reductions in transmission in all
provinces coinciding with the PSBB period. However, they also suggest that measures were
sufficient to bring 𝑅𝑡 below 1 for a sustained period only in Jakarta and Yogyakarta. Increases
in mobility occurred either during early May (Banten, West Java, Central Java, and East Java)
or alongside the establishment of the AKB in June (Jakarta and Yogyakarta), leading to
corresponding increases in our estimates of 𝑅𝑡 (figure 2F).
These estimates were integrated into our meta-population model (figure 3A). Estimates of
deaths in the baseline scenario were consistent with observed qualitative patterns prior to the
shift to the AKB phase of the epidemic in early June. The epicenter shifted over time from
Jakarta to satellite towns and other provincial capitals, and with Yogyakarta remaining least
affected. Our baseline scenario’s median deaths fall within the range of cumulative confirmed
and suspected deaths up to 31st May 2020 and the number of confirmed and suspected deaths
between 13th-31st May 2020 in most provinces (table 1). Total suspected deaths fell within the
model’s uncertainty bounds for most provinces except Jakarta and Central Java (table 1).
The scenarios estimates are consistent with reductions in contact rates serving to reduce spread,
reduce healthcare demand and avert mortality prior to AKB phase: an estimated 57,000
(24,800-105,400, 95% UI) deaths averted when compared to an effectively unmitigated
epidemic with 𝑅𝑡 = 2 throughout this period (which we estimate would have resulted in 59,900
(26,800-112,800, 95% UI deaths). These numbers do not consider the effects of healthcare
services becoming overwhelmed (as shown by the negative values of the median number of
hospital beds available per COVID-19 case needing hospitalisation under the unmitigated
epidemic scenario; figure 3C) on both direct and indirect mortality, an impact which would
likely have been sizable given the wider spread to more rural settings with more scarce
healthcare provision in our unmitigated scenario (figure 3D; 3E).
Our baseline scenario increasingly over-predicts deaths in most provinces during the AKB.
This is in line with our results suggesting a decoupling of within-province mobility from virus
transmissibility over that period.
Estimating current COVID-19 burden, modelled future scenarios, and estimated
vaccines impact in Java
Our projections generated 2nd September 2020[17] (figure S13) suggested that whilst 𝑅𝑡 was
well below that observed at the beginning of the epidemic, this was driven primarily by the
impact of control measures rather than the accumulation of population-level immunity. As a
result, in the absence of additional control measures, death rates were likely to rise for the
remainder of the year in all provinces, pushing all provinces beyond available hospital capacity.

We found that reimplementation of PSBB could largely prevent capacity from being exceeded
but would not prevent a subsequent wave if such control was not maintained.
Subsequently, between our two sets of simulations (2nd September 2020 and 7th December
2020), both confirmed deaths and our inferred estimates of total suspected deaths increased
from 5,108 to 11,370 and 12,254 to 26,206, respectively, across Java. At the island level, the
estimated attack rates on both time points increased from 1.21% to 2.57% and 2.95% to 6.03%
based on confirmed deaths and assuming all suspected deaths as COVID-19 deaths,
respectively (figure 4A). At the province level, estimates of attack rate and total burden from
COVID-19 differ quite significantly, with Jakarta accumulating the highest attack rates in the
region by 7th December 2020 (figure 4B; table S6). In all provinces and based on models fitted
to either suspected or confirmed deaths, there were consistent increases of around 2-3 times on
the province-level attack rate from 2nd September to 7th December 2020. However, as seen at
the island level, discrepancies between the estimated attack rates based on the model fitted to
suspected deaths and confirmed deaths data were still observed at the province-level, with the
highest difference observed in Jakarta.
Projections of future scenarios from December 2020 (figure 4C; and figure S14 for provincelevel breakdown), incorporating these changes in estimated attack rate and extrapolating
current trends of 𝑅𝑐 , leads to the projected daily incidence of mortality across the island
continuing to grow throughout the first half of the 2021 irrespective of whether reported or
suspected mortality are more reflective of true direct COVID-19 mortality. In this scenario,
with future 𝑅𝑐 = 1.25, the epidemic would be projected to peak earliest in Jakarta, driven by
the higher degree of population-level immunity implied by the higher cumulative attack rate to
date. This peak’s timing is sensitive to the mortality metric the model is calibrated to, with
projected peaks occurring early in 2021 for a current scenario based upon suspected deaths and
towards the end of the first quarter of 2021 based upon reported deaths. However, in all
provinces, at no point in any of our current scenarios was there sufficient population-immunity
to preclude a subsequent upsurge in deaths if transmission levels returned to those estimated at
the beginning of the pandemic (𝑅𝑐 ≈ 2.00).
Figure 5A shows trajectories of the three different future scenarios summarized in terms of the
proportion of lives lost before the beginning of a month (figure 5B) and the total remaining
lives to be saved (deaths that can still be averted) after the start of the month (figure 5C). We
estimate that reimposing suppression scenarios in areas where epidemics are on an upwards
trajectory would significantly reduce lives lost during a period whilst the vaccine is rolled out.
In some settings, such as Jakarta, assuming all suspected deaths were COVID-19 deaths, a
combination of control measures currently in place and increasing levels of population
immunity may combine to reduce transmission and burden to low-levels temporarily. At this
point, the future incremental impact of suppression measures would likely be limited. However,
in such scenarios, the high loss of life we estimate would occur in a subsequent lifting of control
measures, which highlights the need for ongoing control measures and the substantial
remaining incremental value of an effective vaccination campaign (figure 5C).

DISCUSSION
Our analysis uses C19P funeral data in Jakarta to highlight the considerable benefits of using
syndromic measures of COVID-19 mortality for surveillance purposes– particularly for
countries such as Indonesia, where testing capacity has been severely strained in the face of the
pandemic. C19P funerals and other measures of suspected mortality provide an alternative lens
through which to understand COVID-19 burden and dynamics but do not allow precise
measurement. Without confirmed diagnoses, the proportion of these individuals who were
infected will always be unknown and liable to vary spatiotemporally, as will the extent to which
measures of suspected deaths represent all deaths of individuals displaying COVID-19
symptoms. These data also support the substantial circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in Indonesia
well before the first confirmed COVID-19 case[3] and the higher impact of the virus than
suggested by confirmed deaths alone. Simultaneously, they also indicate an earlier decline in
transmission during the early stages of the pandemic, coinciding with reductions in mobility,
and more sustained declines in transmissibility in response to NPIs than observed in confirmed
deaths, a metric which is likely sensitive to limitations in testing. We also found these effects
consistent with NPIs substantially attenuating spread across Java, including to older, more rural
populations with lower access to healthcare.
Better quantifying impact in the past helps us to better understand likely scenarios in the future.
In our first set of projections in September 2020,[17] we suggested that C19P data could
indicate up to a four-fold increase in cumulative exposure to the virus relative to confirmed
deaths. However, even when assuming a higher burden of the disease in the population,
immunity accumulated at the population-level would not prevent the burden from increasing
throughout the remainder of 2020. We also suggested that measures to suppress the virus could
prevent such a scenario but would need to be sustained to prevent further upsurges. From early
2021, these projections appear to have been valid as transmission declined in Jakarta whilst
PSBB was implemented between 14th September – 11th October 2020 but subsequently
resurged once restrictions were lifted. Overall, Java’s current epidemiological situation is
substantially worse than in September, with record deaths reported week-on-week.[18]
Despite the qualitative validity of our September projections, there are multiple limitations
associated with these analyses that should be noted, particularly as our current estimates of
attack rates in all provinces in Java have increased substantially. Firstly, it remains difficult to
say what level of population-immunity is required to achieve herd immunity as individual
immune responses to the virus are still not yet well understood (including strength and
duration),[19,20] and heterogeneity in population mixing beyond age-structure likely play
important roles.[21,22] Moreover, our estimates of counterfactual ‘return-to-normal’ scenarios
rely upon an estimate of 𝑅𝑐 = 2.00 from the early stage of the epidemic in Jakarta, a period in
which data were particularly limited and, given increasing global concern around the pandemic,
where a degree of behavior change relevant may have already occurred. As this estimate is also
below those estimated in the early stage of the epidemic from other settings,[23] this estimate
may represent a conservative measure of the basic reproduction number. These limitations
around the inherent transmissibility and critical immunity threshold to control the virus need
to be further considered in the light of recent concerns of new variants of concern across the

globe which appear more transmissible.[24–26] There have also been observed resurgences in
populations where attack rates had likely passed many estimates of the herd immunity
threshold.[24,27]
The initiation of the vaccination campaign in the middle of January[8] provides hopes for more
sustainable control of the virus. However, challenges in access and distribution,[28] uncertainty
in vaccine efficacy,[28] and possible introductions of variants able to escape immune
response[29] could hamper the life-saving impact of the vaccination program. Despite the
unprecedented speed of global vaccine development, our study indicates that in the absence of
NPIs implemented over the previous year, this campaign would have been too late to prevent
most deaths that currently remain avertable. It also highlights the ongoing value and need to
maintain current control measures during the coming months as the vaccine is rolled out. Given
low estimated attack rates and current increasing trends in transmission across much of the
island, our results suggest that further measures aimed towards suppression of the disease over
the next few months would substantially increase the proportion of the population who receive
the vaccine prior to being exposed to infection, leading to a likely substantial incremental
impact of the vaccination campaign. However, we are not able to capture the socio-economic
costs of such approaches, which would need to be factored into balanced decision-making.
The case for maintaining or increasing control measures is likely more intuitive to grasp in
circumstances where the incidence of cases and deaths continues to rise. However, our
projections for Jakarta, particularly those incorporating suspected deaths, suggest it is plausible
that population-level immunity may contribute to a decline in the observed rate of new
infections, and subsequently, deaths even in the absence of a vaccine in the coming months.
Such an effect may have consequences for the perceptions of both the vaccine’s relative impact
(for example, if deaths start to decline as the vaccine is rolled out in Jakarta but not in other
provinces) as well as the ongoing need for NPIs and/or high vaccine uptake. In such
circumstances, our counterfactual of a ‘return-to-normal’, which produces major upsurges in
cases and deaths in every province regardless of mortality metric, provides a valuable reminder
that the epidemic, and the need to control it, is far from over in any region of Java.

Supplementary Material
S1. Data Sources and Curation
Epidemiological data sources for Jakarta
Epidemiological data for Jakarta were obtained from the official Jakarta COVID-19 data monitoring website
(https://corona.jakarta.go.id/id/data-pemantauan).1 This data comprises daily reported cases, reported deaths,
funerals with COVID-19 protocol (C19P), and the number of tests. We collate the data for analysis up to 7th
December 2020.
Anonymous individual data of 11,280 confirmed COVID-19 cases up to 29th June 2020 in Jakarta were obtained
from the Jakarta Department of Health. Data consist of dates of onset of symptoms, dates of attendance in the
hospital, and dates of deaths. The individual data were used to estimate the delay distributions between onset to
diagnosis and onset to death.
Epidemiological data sources for five other provinces in Java (Banten, West Java, Central Java,
Yogyakarta, and East Java)
Daily reported cases and reported deaths data for five other provinces in Java were obtained from an independently
curated online spreadsheet by a crowdsource organisation KawalCOVID19 (kcov.id/daftarpositif)2 based on the
daily publication by Indonesia COVID-19 National Task Force3 (data for analysis were collated up 7th December
2020). The weekly number of deaths of suspected and probable cases was obtained from WHO Indonesia situation
reports 13-36.4

Call detail records data
Anonymised call detail records (CDRs) data from one of the biggest telecommunication companies in Indonesia
over the period of 1st May 2011 to 30th April 2012 were used to estimate between-district movement matrices for
the Ramadan and non-Ramadan period. The CDRs data were collected daily with a total of 266 billion records
and 137 million unique SIM cards. There was a total of 17,319 mobile phone towers operated during the period
of CDRs data collection across the country.
Province-level mobility changes
Province-level mobility changes data were acquired from the freely-available Google COVID-19 Community
Mobility Reports (https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/).5 Google Mobility Reports data up to 7th of
December 2020 were used for the analysis.
Healthcare capacity data
District-level hospital and ICU beds data were obtained from the Online Healthcare Facilities (Fasyankes Online)
website by the Directorate General of Health Services (Ditjen Yankes) of the Ministry of Health of the Republic
of Indonesia.6
Dedicated COVID-19 isolation beds and ICU beds data
Data for the capacity of dedicated COVID-19 isolation beds and ICU beds were obtained from a report from the
Ministry of Health in August 2020.7
S2. Reconstruction of frequency of onset
Daily reported cases, reported deaths, and C19P funerals data in Jakarta were reconstructed to represent the onset
day of each reported event using estimates of the distribution of delays between onset and diagnosis and onset
and death. Each C19P funeral was assumed to occur the day following the date of death.
The distributions of onset to diagnosis and onset to death of confirmed COVID-19 cases were estimated by fitting
discretised Gamma distributions8 to the individual patient data obtained from the Jakarta Department of Health
(Figure S2). The mean estimate of the onset to diagnosis delay was 7.62 days, with a standard deviation of 7.51
days. The mean estimate of the onset to death delay was 15.87 days, with a standard deviation of 9.34 days. 100
sets of reconstructed daily frequencies of onset of cases, deaths, and funerals were then calculated on the basis of
100 draws for each reported event from these distributions (respectively onset to hospitalisation, onset to death,
and onset to funeral). Adjustment for right censoring occurring due to individuals currently with symptoms but
have yet to reach outcome was carried out by dividing the inferred onset frequency on a given day by the
cumulative probability it would have been observed by the last date within the dataset.

S3. Effective reproduction number (𝑹𝒕 ) calculations based on reconstructed epidemiological data in
Jakarta and its relationship with daily mobility changes
The daily effective reproduction number in Jakarta was estimated using the EpiEstim R package 9,10 for each
reconstructed cases (𝑅𝑡,𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠 ), deaths (𝑅𝑡,𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑠 ), funerals (𝑅𝑡,𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑠 ) data. 𝑅𝑡 at the beginning of the epidemic
was estimated for the period before 2nd March 2020 (the day where the country’s first two cases were announced).
Subsequently, 𝑅𝑡 was estimated over a weekly sliding window, with a mean and standard deviation of serial
interval distribution were assumed to be 6.3 and 4.2 days, respectively. 11
1,000 random samples were drawn from the posterior samples of the estimated 𝑅𝑡,𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠 , 𝑅𝑡,𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑠 , and 𝑅𝑡,𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑠
at each timepoint. Pearson’s correlation coefficients for estimates based on cases, deaths, and funerals data were
calculated against the daily average changes in non-residential mobility in Jakarta based on Google mobility
estimates. The daily average changes in non-residential mobility are the average of changes of retail and
recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit stations, and workplaces types of mobility to each respective
baseline.
The 7-day rolling average changes of non-residential mobility were fitted to 100 posterior samples of the estimated
𝑅𝑡,𝑓𝑢𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑠 using smoothing spline models. The implementation of the smoothing spline model was done in R
software using smooth.spline function with four knots. The models were then used to extrapolate the daily values
of 𝑅𝑡 outside of Jakarta based on the province-level 7-day rolling average of changes in non-residential mobility
(Google Community Mobility Reports5).
S4. Estimating movement matrices from CDRs data
District level (city and municipality, 115 in total) movement matrices (𝑀) prior to the pandemic for the normal
(or non-Ramadan) (𝑀𝑁 ) and Ramadan (𝑀𝑅 ) periods were calculated from CDRs data. Each element of the matrix
(𝑚𝑖,𝑗 ) represents the proportion of days spent by residents of district 𝑖 in district 𝑗 over the year.
The daily position of each user is described as the district where the most frequent mobile phone usage happened
over the period of a single day. All users were assumed to be active from the first day to the last day of their phone
usage. On days where the user was not active (no phone activities recorded), the position of the user was assumed
to be the same as the previous day. The primary residence of each user is defined as the district where the users
spent most of their days over their ‘active’ period. Based on their daily locations and primary residences, we then
calculated the proportion of days spent of people from district 𝑖 in district 𝑗. 𝑀𝑅 was estimated using data of
August and September 2011 (period of the Ramadan month, Eid celebration, and national holidays period). 𝑀𝑁
was estimated using the rest of the data that were not used to estimate 𝑀𝑅 (May 2011 - July 2011 and October
2011 - April 2012 periods).
All districts in the Java island were represented as a single row in each matrix with exceptions for districts in
Jakarta province which were represented as an aggregated single (𝑖 = 1). Outside Java movements were
represented as a single row (𝑖 = 2). Table S1 shows a complete list of districts (including Jakarta and outside
Java) and each respective index in the movement matrix.
S5. Metapopulation Model
Metapopulation model of COVID-19 spread in Java
We developed a metapopulation model to simulate the spread of COVID-19 in Java. Each patch in the
metapopulation model represents districts (𝑖 = 1,2, . . . ,115) listed in Table S1. For each patch, stochastic
differential equations representing a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model were implemented
(overall structure in Figure S3). The equations are as follows:
𝑑𝑆𝑖
= −𝑛𝑒𝑤 𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖
𝑑𝑡
𝑑𝐸𝑖
= 𝑛𝑒𝑤 𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖 − 𝛼𝐸𝑖
𝑑𝑡
𝑑𝐼𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑑,𝑖
= (1 − 𝑝ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑝,𝑖 ) 𝛼𝐸𝑖 − 𝛾1 𝐼𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑑,𝑖
𝑑𝑡
𝑑𝐼𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒,𝑖
= 𝑝ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑝,𝑖 𝛼𝐸𝑖 − 𝛾2 𝐼𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒,𝑖

𝑑𝑅𝑖
= 𝛾1 𝐼𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑑,𝑖 + 𝛾2 𝐼𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒,𝑖
𝑑𝑡
where 𝑛𝑒𝑤 𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖 is the number of new infections in each patch based on the stochastic adaptation of the
metapopulation transmission model by Keeling et al. 12, 𝛼 is the per-capita transition rate reflecting the mean
duration of latent period, 𝑝ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑝 is the probability of having severe illness and needing hospitalisations,
𝑝𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙|ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑝 is the probability of needing critical care if hospitalised, and 𝛾1 and 𝛾2 are the per-capita transition
rate reflecting the mean duration of infectiousness of mild and severe infections, respectively. The full model
parameter descriptions and specifications are available in Table S2. To calculate 𝑛𝑒𝑤 𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖 , we firstly
need to calculate the district-level force of infections 𝜆𝑖 that accounts for inter-district movements of both
susceptible individuals (that might acquire infections in other districts) and infected individuals (that might infect
people in other districts) based on the inter-patch connectivities (the movement matrix, 𝑀, accounting daily
changes in mobility - see section S4). The total number of infected individuals that are contributing to infections
in district 𝑖, 𝐼𝑡𝑜𝑡,𝑖 , is calculated by:
𝐼𝑡𝑜𝑡,𝑖 = ∑115
𝑗=1 𝐵𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑎𝑙(𝐼𝑗 , 𝑚𝑗,𝑖 ).
The transmission rate for each district is calculated by:
𝛽𝑖 =

𝑅0,𝑖

,

((1−𝑝ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑝,𝑖 )𝛾1 +𝑝ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑝,𝑖 𝛾2 )

where 𝑅0,𝑖 is the value of 𝑅𝑡 estimated for the period of maximum mobility recorded within Google Mobility
data.
Hence,:
𝜆𝑖 = 𝛽𝑖 × 𝜅𝑡,𝑖 ×

𝐼𝑡𝑜𝑡,𝑖
𝑁𝑖

,

where 𝑁𝑖 is the total population of each district/patch and 𝜅𝑡,𝑖 is the daily ratio between the estimated 𝑅𝑡,𝑖 values
based on the spline model estimates and the respective 𝑅0,𝑖 , representing the relative changes in the daily
transmission rate. We assumed no transmission contributed to and from outside Java but we still allow movement
to and from that patch (𝑖 = 2) which implies both 𝐼2 and 𝜆2 are always 0.
𝑛𝑒𝑤 𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖 are then calculated as:
115

𝑛𝑒𝑤 𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖 = ∑ 𝐵𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑎𝑙(𝑆𝑖 × 𝑚𝑖,𝑗 , (1 − 𝑒𝑥𝑝(−𝜆𝑗 )))
𝑗=1

For each severe infection needing hospitalisation (𝐼𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒 ), the case was either deemed a critical case (i.e., indicated
to require an ICU bed) with probability 𝑝𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙|ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑝 and otherwise, non-critical (i.e., indicated to require an
isolation bed) with associated probability of death (𝑝𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ|𝑛𝑜𝑛 𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙 and 𝑝𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ|𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙 , diagram in Figure S3B).
𝑝ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑝 , 𝑝𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙|ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑝 , 𝑝𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ|𝑛𝑜𝑛 𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙 and 𝑝𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ|𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙 were obtained for each district as the average values
estimated within simulations from the squire package13, taking age-specific demography using district-level
census data and, in the absence of equivalent data from Java, mixing patterns based upon a contact survey from
Shanghai province, China as an example of contact patterns within a UMIC Asian country and province containing
a megacity.
The model was simulated with 100 replicates by seeding initial cases in Jakarta, and Kota Surabaya (East Java’s
capital) – both have international airports receiving travellers from China – on 7th January 2020 (arbitrarily
selected) with 100 replicates. Initial cases in Jakarta were set to 12, obtained through calibration to provide
simulated deaths trends bounded by the interval between reported deaths and C19P funerals. Initial cases in
Surabaya were drawn according to a binomial draw assuming an underlying importation rate of 60% of that in
Jakarta14, random numbers based on the binomial distribution were sampled for each replicate.
We assumed different transmission scenarios of districts classified as rural and urban districts. We classified an
urban/rural status to each district based upon the urban/rural classification of the majority of villages within the
district. We assigned 𝑅𝑡,𝑖 values for all districts to be the province-level value of 𝑅𝑡,𝑖 in which each district is
located. We then explore the possibilities of rural districts to have different 𝑅𝑡,𝑖 levels, ranging from 100% to 60%
of province-level 𝑅𝑡,𝑖 . In the results section of the main text, we show simulation results assuming 𝑅𝑡,𝑖 in rural
districts to be 90% of 𝑅𝑡,𝑖 in urban districts. We also ran the model for several different counterfactual scenarios.
The list of assumed transmission scenarios and the counterfactual scenarios were shown in Table S3 & S4.

During the period of Ramadan and Eid festivals, 24 th April 2020 up to 7th June 2020, the Ramadan movement
matrix (𝑀𝑅 ) was used as the baseline movement matrix. In the other period, the non-Ramadan movement matrix
(𝑀𝑁 ) was used as the baseline movement matrix. As a baseline assumption, throughout the simulation, the
proportions of people spending their time in other districts (𝑚𝑖,𝑗 where 𝑖 ≠ 𝑗) were adjusted by the province-level
changes in mobility over time, with reductions in larger-scale movement outside the province assumed to be
higher than those within the province according to an odds ratio (OR) of 2 within our default scenario.
For each scenario, we also devised a metric to assess the extent to which the epidemic would be likely to strain
available healthcare resources over time given patterns of spatial spread and disparities in healthcare supply by
district. This metric was defined by determining the number of available beds for each individual newly requiring
hospitalisation each day within the model by subtracting the number of hospital beds required in the simulation
from the total hospital beds capacity available at the district-level obtained from the Online Healthcare Facilities
website.6

Figure S3. SEIR model structure. A) The SEIR structure for each patch in the metapopulation model.
Susceptible individuals (𝑺), if infected, progress to the exposed compartment (𝑬), having their latent period of
infections. Then, those individuals will either develop mild symptoms (𝑰𝒎𝒊𝒍𝒅 ) or severe symptoms requiring
hospitalisations (𝐼𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒 ). Those who developed severe symptoms may have two possible outcomes: recovery (𝑅)
or death (𝐷); B) The pathway of infections requiring hospitalisations (𝐼𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒 ). Each infection with severe symptoms
may only need a standard hospital bed or may develop worse conditions that require critical care (ICU bed). Each
of those cases treated in both critical and non-critical care may recover or die based on specific probabilities.
Dashed lines denote probabilistic pathways, not rates of transition.

S6. Model fitting to confirmed and suspected COVID-19 deaths and future projection scenarios in all
provinces in Java
Estimating the number of deaths from suspected and probable cases in Java provinces
Jakarta reported a time series dataset of the province daily C19P funerals in their official COVID-19 tracker
website (https://corona.jakarta.go.id/id/data-pemantauan)1 which includes confirmed/reported and probable
COVID-19 deaths (both combined were then defined as suspected deaths). Whilst for the other five provinces in
Java, daily time series data of probable deaths are not available. WHO Indonesia situation reports provide a weekly
summary of confirmed and probable deaths (which both combined become suspected deaths) in all provinces in
Java since the end of May 2020 (Figure S8)4 We collated these data and calculated the proportion of confirmed
deaths from suspected COVID-19 deaths for each province (𝜌𝑖 with 𝑖 as each province index).
For all days from 1st March 2020, up to 7th December 2020, we simulated the number of probable deaths in five
Java provinces other than Jakarta. Firstly, we aggregated the daily confirmed deaths in each province to a weekly
period (𝐷𝑖,𝑡 with 𝑡 as the weekly time window). For each weekly time window 𝑡, using Negative Binomial
distribution, we simulated the number of probable deaths (𝑂𝑖,𝑡 ) in each province 10 times:
𝑂𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑁𝐵(𝐷𝑖,𝑡 , 𝜌𝑖 ).
For each simulated 𝑂𝑖,𝑡 , we simulated the spread of the weekly total estimated probable deaths into daily estimated
probable deaths using Multinomial distribution, assuming equal probability for all days during the week 10 times:
𝑜𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑚(𝑂𝑖,𝑡 , 𝜋)
where 𝜋 is a vector of length 7, where each value is 1/7.
The simulations resulted in 100 samples of estimated daily probable deaths in each province. Adding the simulated
daily probable deaths to the daily confirmed deaths, we obtained 100 samples of the estimated number of daily
suspected COVID-19 deaths in five provinces in Java other than Jakarta.
The daily suspected COVID-19 deaths are then defined, for Jakarta, as the daily C19P funerals, and for five other
Java provinces as the median of the estimated number of the daily suspected COVID-19 deaths.
Model fitting
Using the framework developed in the Imperial College COVID-19 LMIC reports18, we fit the model to both the
daily COVID-19 confirmed deaths and the daily COVID-19 suspected deaths data for each province in Java,
estimating both a province-specific 𝑅0 and epidemic start date. To provide model fits that are agnostic to the
mobility profiles in each province, we model the time-varying reproduction number, 𝑅𝑡 , using a series of pseudorandom walk parameters, which alter the transmission every 2-weeks, with 𝑅𝑡 given by:
𝑅𝑡 = 𝑅0 . 𝑓(−𝜌1 − 𝜌2 . . . −𝜌𝑛 )

Where 𝑓(𝑥) = 2 𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑥)/(1 + 𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑥)), i.e., twice the inverse logit function, which has been used in previous
models to capture the impact of mobility data on transmission 19. Each 𝜌 parameter is introduced two weeks after
the previous parameter, serving to capture changes in transmission over time. More specifically, each 𝜌 parameter
is set equal to 0 for each day prior to its start date. For example, 𝜌1 is the change in transmission, which is set to
start at the beginning of the epidemic. The estimated value for 𝜌1 is then maintained for all future time points. 𝜌2
is the second change in transmission, which starts 14 days after the epidemic start date, i.e., is equal to 0 prior to
this. The last mobility independent change in transmission, 𝜌𝑛 is maintained for the last 4 weeks prior to the
current day to reflect our inability to estimate the effect size of this parameter due to the approximate 21 day delay
between infection and death.16
The model fitting results were presented in Figure S9 & S10. Based on the fitted models in all provinces
considering different types of deaths data, we estimated the attack rate at the province level and Java level.
Future projection scenarios
Using the fitted models, some future scenarios were explored based on the assumed values of the reproduction
number under control, 𝑅𝑐 , defined similarly to 𝑅0 as the average number of secondary infections within an entirely
susceptible population but incorporating the impact of NPIs (and, equivalently, 𝑅𝑡 but not incorporating the effects
of population-level immunity such that 𝑅0 > 𝑅𝑐 > 𝑅𝑡 ). Moreover, as with 𝑅0 , 𝑅𝑐 >1 can lead to 𝑅𝑡 < 1 and a
declining epidemic if there exist sufficient levels of naturally acquired immunity within the population. We
simulated forward projections based on scenarios described in Table S5.
