Abstract: As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads, the
susceptible subpopulation is depleted causing the incidence of new cases to decline. Variation in
individual susceptibility or exposure to infection exacerbates this effect. Individuals that are
more susceptible or more exposed tend to be infected earlier, depleting the susceptible
subpopulation of those who are at higher risk of infection. This selective depletion of
susceptibles intensifies the deceleration in incidence. Eventually, susceptible numbers become
low enough to prevent epidemic growth or, in other words, the herd immunity threshold (HIT) is
reached. Although estimates vary, simple calculations suggest that herd immunity to SARSCoV-2 requires 60-70% of the population to be immune. By fitting epidemiological models that
allow for heterogeneity to SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks across the globe, we show that variation in
susceptibility or exposure to infection reduces these estimates. Accurate measurements of
heterogeneity are therefore of paramount importance in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.
One Sentence Summary: Models that curtail individual variation in susceptibility or exposure
to infection overestimate epidemic sizes and herd immunity thresholds.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China in late 2019
and spread worldwide causing the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). As of
06 May 2020, more than 3.5 million cases have been confirmed and almost 250,000 died (1).
Scientists throughout the world have engaged with governments, health agencies, and with each
other, to address this emergency. Mathematical models have been central to important decisions
concerning contact tracing, quarantine, and social distancing, to mitigate or suppress the initial
pandemic spread (2). Successful suppression, however, leaves populations at risk to resurgent
waves due to insufficient acquisition of immunity. Models have thus also addressed longer term
SARS-CoV-2 transmission scenarios and the requirements for continued adequate response (3).
This is especially timely as countries begin to relax lockdown measures that have been in place
over recent weeks with varying levels of success in tackling national outbreaks.
Here we demonstrate that individual variation in susceptibility or exposure (connectivity)
accelerates the acquisition of immunity in populations due to selection by the force of infection.
More susceptible and more connected individuals have a higher propensity to be infected and
thus are likely to become immune earlier. Due to this selective immunization, heterogeneous
populations require less infections to cross their herd immunity thresholds (HITs) than
homogeneous (or not sufficiently heterogeneous) models would suggest. We integrate
continuous distributions of susceptibility or connectivity in otherwise basic epidemic models for
COVID-19 and show that as the coefficient of variation (CV) increases from 0 to 4, the herd
immunity threshold declines from over 60% (4, 5) to less than 10%. Measures of individual
variation are urgently needed to narrow the estimated ranges of HITs and plan accordingly.
SARS-CoV-2 transmission in heterogeneous populations
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted primarily by respiratory droplets and modelled as a susceptibleexposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) process.

Individual variation in susceptibility is integrated as a continuously distributed factor that
multiplies the force of infection upon individuals as
𝑆̇(𝑥) = −𝜆𝑥𝑆(𝑥),

30

𝐸̇ (𝑥) = 𝜆𝑥𝑆(𝑥) − 𝛿𝐸(𝑥),

40

(1)

where 𝑆(𝑥) is the number of individuals with susceptibility 𝑥, 𝐸(𝑥) and 𝐼(𝑥) are the numbers of
individuals who originally had susceptibility 𝑥 and became exposed and infectious, 𝛿 is the rate
of progression from exposed to infectious, 𝛾 is the rate of recovery or death, and 𝜆 =
(𝛽 ⁄𝑁) ∫[𝜌𝐸(𝑥) + 𝐼(𝑥)] 𝑑𝑥 is the average force of infection upon susceptible individuals in a
population of size 𝑁. The basic reproduction number is
𝑅! = 〈𝑥〉(𝛽 ⁄𝑁)(𝜌⁄𝛿 + 1⁄𝛾),

35

𝐼(̇ 𝑥) = 𝛿𝐸(𝑥) − 𝛾𝐼(𝑥),

(2)

where 𝜌 is a factor measuring the infectivity of individuals in compartment E in relation to those
in 𝐼, and 〈𝑥〉 is the mean susceptibility factor at epidemic onset. Prior to the epidemic,
susceptibility is described by a probability density function 𝑞(𝑥) with mean 1 and 𝐶𝑉 =
〈(𝑥 − 1)" 〉 explored as a parameter. The effective reproduction number (𝑅#$$ , also denoted by
𝑅# or 𝑅% by other authors) is a time-dependent quantity obtained by multiplying 𝑅! by the
susceptibility of the population over time.
Figure 1 depicts model trajectories fitted to suppressed epidemics in Italy and Austria, assuming
coefficients of variation 1 and 3. The difference in the size of second waves between the two
levels of variation is substantial. In the case of Italy, where suppression was less successful, the

pandemic appears mostly resolved when 𝐶𝑉 = 3. However, a large second wave (or a series of
smaller waves, depending on possible containment strategies) remains in the horizon when 𝐶𝑉 =
1. Countries where suppression of the initial outbreak was more successful, such as Austria, have
acquired less immunity and therefore the potential for future transmission in the respective
populations remains naturally larger. However, also in these situations, expectations for the
potential of subsequent waves is much reduced by variation in susceptibility to infection.

In a directly transmitted infectious disease, such as COVID-19, variation in exposure to infection
is primarily governed by patterns of connectivity among individuals. We incorporate this in the
system (Equation 1) by adding variation in infectivity and assuming a positive correlation
between susceptibility and infectivity. Formally this corresponds to modifying the force of
infection as 𝜆 = (𝛽 ⁄𝑁)(∫ 𝑥 [𝜌𝐸(𝑥) + 𝐼(𝑥)] 𝑑𝑥 ⁄∫ 𝑥𝑞(𝑥) 𝑑𝑥) and the basic reproduction number
as
𝑅! = (〈𝑥 " 〉⁄〈𝑥〉)(𝛽⁄𝑁 )(𝜌⁄𝛿 + 1⁄𝛾),

10

where 〈𝑥〉 and 〈𝑥 " 〉 are the first and second moments of the distribution 𝑞(𝑥) prior to the
epidemic. Applying this model to the epidemics in Italy and Austria (Figure 2) leads to similar
results to those obtained when variation was in susceptibility to infection.

The herd immunity threshold

Individual variation in risk of acquiring infection is under selection by the force of infection,
whether individual differences are due to biological susceptibility, physical exposure, or a
combination of the two traits. Selection results in the removal of the most at-risk individuals
from the susceptible pool as they become infected and eventually recover (some die). This
selective acquisition of infection and immunity results simultaneously in decelerated epidemic
growth and accelerated induction of immunity in the population. The herd immunity threshold
(HIT) defines the percentage of the population that needs to be immune to reverse epidemic
growth and prevent future waves. Figure 3 shows the expected downward trends in the HIT for
SARS-CoV-2 as the coefficients of variation of the gamma distributed susceptibility or exposure
are increased between 0 and 4 (to assess robustness to changing the type of distribution see
Figure S22 for equivalent plots with lognormal distributions). While herd immunity is expected
to require 60-70% of a homogeneous population to be immune given an 𝑅! between 2.5 and 3,
these percentages drop to the range 10-20% for CVs between 2 and 4. Therefore, a critically
important question is: how variable are humans in their susceptibility and exposure to SARSCoV-2? Hitherto, there is no definite answer to this question.

pragmatically. We searched the literature for estimates of individual variation in the propensity
to acquire or transmit several infectious diseases including COVID-19 and overlaid these
estimates as vertical lines in Figure 3. CV estimates are mostly comprised between 2 and 4, a
range where naturally acquired immunity to SARS-CoV-2 may place populations over the HIT
once as few as 10-20% of its individuals are immune. This depends, however, on which specific
transmission traits are variable and how much the trait variants are distributed.
Variation in infectiousness was critical to attribute the scarce and explosive outbreaks to
superspreaders when the SARS-CoV-1 emerged in 2002 (9), but infectiousness does not respond
to selection as susceptibility or exposure do. Models with individual variation in infectiousness
perform equivalently to homogeneous versions when implemented deterministically (Figure
S21). They diverge when stochasticity is added in the sense that disease extinction becomes
more likely and outbreaks become rarer and more explosive (9-11), but this an entirely different
phenomenon to that presented in this paper.
Among the estimates of individual variation plotted in Figure 3, those corresponding to SARSCoV viruses, with coefficients of variation in the range 2.6-3.2, have been described as variation
in individual infectiousness (9, 10), but the way authors describe superspreaders is suggestive
that higher infectiousness may stem from higher connectivity with other individuals who may be
susceptible. This would support the scenarios displayed in Figure 2 with 𝐶𝑉 = 3 for
connectivity, although little is known about how this might have been modified by social
distancing.

The concept of herd immunity is most commonly used in the design of vaccination programs (12,
13). Defining the percentage of the population that must be immune to cause infection incidences
to decline, herd immunity thresholds constitute convenient targets for vaccination coverage. In
idealized scenarios of vaccines delivered at random and individuals mixing at random, herd
immunity thresholds are given by a simple formula (1 − 1⁄𝑅! ) which, in the case of SARSCoV-2, suggests that 60-70% of the population would need be immunized to halt spread
considering estimates of 𝑅! between 2.5 and 3. A crucial caveat in exporting these calculations
to immunization by natural infection is that natural infection does not occur at random.
Individuals who are more susceptible or more exposed are more prone to be infected and become
immune, which lowers the threshold (14). In our model, the herd immunity threshold declines
sharply when coefficients of variation increase from 0 to 2 and remains below 20% for more
variable populations. The amplitude of the decline depends on what property is heterogeneous
and how it is distributed but the downwards trend is robust (Figures 3 and S22).
Heterogeneity in the transmission of respiratory infections has traditionally focused on variation
in exposure summarized into age-structured contact matrices. Besides overlooking differences in
susceptibility given exposure, the aggregation of individuals into age groups curtails coefficients
of variation with important downstream implications. We calculated CV for the landmark
POLYMOD matrices (15, 16) and obtained values between 0.3 and 0.5. Recent studies of
COVID-19 integrated contact matrices with age-specific susceptibility to infection (structured in
three levels) (17) or with social activity (three levels also) (18) which, again, resulted in
coefficients of variation less than 1. We show that models with coefficients of variation of this
magnitude would appear to differ only moderately from homogeneous approximations when
compared with those that incorporate CVs between 2 and 3, as estimated for a variety of

infectious diseases (Figure 3) and supported by detailed mobility data in the city of Portland,
Oregon, USA (19) (we obtained an estimate rounding 𝐶𝑉 = 2 based on data extracted with
WebPlotDigitizer). It is therefore crucial that variation in susceptibility and exposure to infection
is included in epidemic models at the finest resolution of individuals. This has required agentbased models which are computationally intensive and not amenable to mathematical treatment
(19). Here, we introduce mathematical formalisms that enable the entire individual variation to
be captured while maintaining the analytical tractability of the simplest homogeneous models.
This is especially relevant when dealing with major crises such as the current pandemic where
optimal strategies rely on a capacity to quickly rationalize the best compromise between
protecting health and safeguarding the economy. The larger the individual variation, the more
optimistic the public health prognostics and the milder the required health policies.
Interventions themselves have potential to manipulate individual variation. Current social
distancing measures may be argued to either increase or decrease variation in exposure,
depending on the roles of different functional strata in societies and the compliance of
individuals who are normally more highly connected in relation to the average. Datasets that
describe connectivity patterns before and during movement restrictions, such as those in (17)
could, in principle, inform relevant changes in distributions of individual connectivity but
surveys must be applied on representative samples of the population and the information cannot
be collapsed into age-group averages. A deeper understanding of the putative patterns is crucial
not only to develop more accurate predictive models, but also to refine control strategies and to
interpret data resulting from prevalence studies and serological surveys.
An analysis of the outbreak on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship reported a cumulative
infected percentage of 17% (20). Seroprevalences estimated from various settings are currently
widespread, but reportedly between less than 1 and just over 20%, including estimates from
Kobe, Japan (3.3%) (21) and Guilan province, Iran (22%) (22). While seropositivity estimates
are limited by epidemiological context and current estimates are undoubtedly affected by testing
uncertainties, our results suggest that some estimated values may be closer to reaching herd
immunity thresholds than otherwise predicted, if populations were sufficiently heterogeneous.
Worth nothing, however, that these estimates may have been offset by the social distancing
measures.
Given current uncertainties, a high level of pragmatism may be required in incorporating results
from serological surveys into policy decisions. We have assumed that infection elicits persistent
adaptive immunity. This assumption is justified by encouraging reports on animal models and
humans recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, even though volatile immunity has not been
ruled out yet. Our results are robust as long as recovered individuals remain immune for several
months. Any test that allows for retrospectively detecting past infections is therefore a
convenient tool for monitoring the prevalence and distribution of individuals who may have
acquired immunity. It would be imperative to conduct repeated serological studies in
representative samples of the population (23) especially as control measures are relaxed, not
necessarily to imply that antibodies themselves are neutralizing but to identify past infection and
potential for immune protection. Given a percent positivity in an initial survey, the curve traced
by subsequent measurements could indicate if and how rapidly a population is moving towards
the herd immunity threshold, and simultaneously advise which control measures should be
enforced.
