Abstract
Background: Population-based serological surveys provide a means for assessing the immunologic
landscape of a community, without the biases related to health-seeking behaviors and testing practices
typically associated with rt-PCR testing. This study assesses SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence over the
first epidemic wave in Canton Geneva, Switzerland, as well as biological and socio-economic risk
factors for infection and symptoms associated with IgG seropositivity.
Methods and findings: Between April 6 and June 30, 2020, former participants of a yearly
representative cross-sectional survey of the 20-75-year-old population of the canton of Geneva were
invited to participate in a seroprevalence study, along with household members five years and older.
We collected blood and tested it for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins G (IgG). Questionnaires
were self-administered. We estimated seroprevalence with a Bayesian model accounting for test
performance and sampling design. We included 8344 participants (53.5% women, mean age 46.9
years). The population-level seroprevalence over the 12-week study period was 7.8 % (95% Credible
Interval (CrI) 6.8-8.9), accounting for sex, age and household random effects. Seroprevalence was
highest among 18-49 year olds (9.5%, 95%CrI 8.1-10.9), with young children (5-9 years) and those
>65 years having significantly lower seroprevalence (4.3% and 4.7-5.4% respectively). Men were
more likely to be seropositive than women (relative risk 1.2, 95%CrI 1.1-1.4). Odds of seropositivity
were reduced for female retirees (0.46, 95%CI 0.23-0.93) and unemployed men (0.35, 95%CI 0.131.0) compared to employed individuals, and for current smokers (0.36, 95%CI 0.23-0.55) compared to
never-smokers. We found no significant association between occupation, level of education,
neighborhood income and the risk of being seropositive. Symptoms most strongly associated with
seropositivity were anosmia/dysgeusia, loss of appetite, fever, fatigue and myalgia and/or arthralgia.
Thirteen percent of seropositive participants reported no symptoms.
Conclusions: Our results confirm a low population seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies
after the first wave in Geneva, a region hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Socioeconomic factors
were not associated with seropositivity in this sample. The elderly and young children were less

Introduction
Seroprevalence studies around the world have established that only a small proportion of the
population had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 towards the end of the first wave in spring 2020 with
most seroprevalence estimates ranging from <0.1 to more than 20%, depending on the setting and
targeted populations.(1–3) Preliminary results from the first five weeks of our 12-week populationbased serosurvey conducted in the canton of Geneva, Switzerland, in April and May, showed a
weekly seroprevalence between 4.8% and 10.9%.(4) Other areas with similar clinical incidence rates,
such as certain regions in France, Italy and Spain showed similar results,(5–7) while the least affected
regions in Spanish and French national surveys showed seroprevalences of less than 3%.(5–8)
Socio-economic risk factors for COVID-19 such as low income, social deprivation and overcrowded
living conditions have been identified in several studies based on molecular testing in the United
Kingdom, the United States, and Brazil.(9–13) However, some of those studies included only
hospitalized patients or individuals with severe COVID-19. Data on confirmed COVID-19 cases are
influenced by testing policies and accessibility and comprise only a minority of the whole infected
population. Serosurveys have the potential to assess the real extent of an outbreak in a given
geographical region and provide information on risk factors, transmission and infection fatality rate
without relying on clinical surveillance and virologic confirmation. Nevertheless, only a few
population-based serostudies assessed biological and socio-economic risk factors for seropositivity.
These have generally highlighted significant relationships between Black, Asian and Hispanic
ethnicity, adult age (varying across studies), living in a deprived or dense area and large household
size, and the risk of being seropositive.(5–8,14,15) While working in the healthcare field or essential
services has been shown to be associated with a higher risk of seropositivity, other individual factors
such as education level and occupational category are rarely described.(6,7,14,16) Serosurveys can
also provide a means to quantify the full spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with SARS-CoV2, including mild and asymptomatic infections, which are often missed in clinical surveillance.

In Switzerland, the first cases of COVID-19 were recorded at the end of February 2020, followed by a
first epidemic wave that took place during March and April 2020.(17) Strict non-pharmaceutical
measures started on March 16th and were progressively relaxed from April 27th 2020 when a total of
29’313 cases and 427 deaths had been reported in the country.(18) In this study, we describe the agespecific seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies between April and June 2020 in Geneva,
Switzerland, and examine risk factors for and symptoms associated with seropositivity.

Methods

Study design and participants
We recruited participants between April 6th and June 30th, 2020. The recruitment strategy and
serological data collection have previously been described in detail.(4) Briefly, SEROCoV-POP is a
population-based observational seroprevalence study. Participants were invited progressively between
April 2nd and June 9th, by email and postal mail, from the study population of a yearly health survey
called Bus Santé,(19) which is representative of the population of canton Geneva aged between 20
and 74 years old. Participants enrolled in the SEROCoV-POP study were invited to bring members of
their household aged 5 years and older. Each person participated only once (one round). Of note,
during the study period, the country was initially under lockdown, then, measures were progressively
relaxed in three consecutive periods.(20) Participants provided written informed consent to participate
in the study, and parents or legal guardians gave consent for children under 18 years. The study
protocol was approved by the Cantonal Research Ethics Commission of Geneva, Switzerland
(CER16-363) and is available online at

Laboratory analysis
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) serological status was assessed using a commercially
available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Euroimmun; Lübeck, Germany #EI 26069601 G) targeting the S1 domain of the spike protein. We used the manufacturer's recommended
cutoff for positivity (≥1ꞏ1) with a reported sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 100% estimated in a
diagnostic validation study conducted in the same lab as these analyses.(21) We tested all serum with
an ELISA IgG ratio of ≥ 0.5 with an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and classified these individuals
with results from this test (when performed) in sensitivity analyses.

Survey questions and coding
Participants could choose to fill in the questionnaire online at home or complete it at the study site on
a tablet computer or on paper.
Questionnaires included questions about socio-demographic characteristics, symptoms, exposure to
SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals and preventive behaviors in relation to the epidemic. Sociodemographic variables included age, sex, employment status, professional occupation, professional
changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and educational level. Educational level was based on the
national Swiss system, with “mandatory education” applying to all children ages 4 to 14, “secondary
education” corresponding to high school (15 to 18), and “university” corresponding to undergraduate
and postgraduate studies.

Participants were also asked to self-identify their occupational sector and profession (the latter was
entered as free text). We mapped this information using the European Socio-Economic Classifications
(ESEC). From the 10 levels of classification, in order to maintain power, this was reduced to 8
categories: (1) professional/manager (ESEC 1-2), (2) higher grade white-collar workers (ESEC 2) (3)
independent workers (ESEC 4-5), (4) lower grade white-collar workers(ESEC 7), (5) blue-collar,

skilled, semi-skilled and non-skilled workers (ESEC 6, 8, 9), (6) other full-time workers to whom the
ESEC categories were not applicable; as well as from ESEC class 10: (7) students or retirees, and (8)
unemployed.

Participants were asked to self-report all symptoms not related to a known chronic condition
experienced since January 2020, and to specify if these appeared as part of one or several distinct
episodes. We defined participants as asymptomatic if they didn’t report any symptoms. Data were
also collected on chronic health conditions, smoking status and height and weight for body mass
index (BMI) calculation. The full study questionnaire is provided in the Supplement.

Other data sources
Data on individual-level income was not collected in the questionnaire. However, based on
participants’ neighborhood of residence, we used data from the Canton of Geneva to determine the
median income for a single individual residing in participants’ neighborhoods. We grouped gross
income into three categories defined as <37,000 CHF/year (70% of the median income), between
37,000 and 68,000 CHF/year, and >68,000 CHF/year (~130% of the median income).(22)

Statistical analysis
We estimated the overall 12-week seroprevalence using a Bayesian logistic regression model
accounting for test performance, sex, age as well as within household infection clustering as
previously described.(4) In our primary analyses, we used IgG ELISA results only to classify
seropositivity, and performed post-stratification to obtain population-wide seroprevalence as well as
by age and sex classes. As a sensitivity analysis, we used the IFA results for all participants tested
with this assay. Models were implemented in the Stan probabilistic programming language. Details

are provided in the Supplementary Material. Weekly crude proportions of seropositivity with
binomial confidence intervals (CI) were also calculated.

For socio-economic and lifestyle risk factors, we limited our analysis to participants ≥18 years of age,
resulting in a final analytic sample of 7442 participants. To test for association between sociodemographic, lifestyle and health-related risk factors and serological status, we used mixed effect
logistic models including a household-level random effect, except for the area-level income analysis.
To understand the sensitivity of our results to missing data, we conducted multi-level multiple
imputation by chained equations using 10 datasets with 30 iterations across the dataset and reran our
primary analyses.
Chi square tests were used to compare the frequencies of individual symptoms between IgG
seropositive and seronegative individuals. Using logistic regression models, we estimated odds ratios
(OR) and 95% CIs for IgG seropositivity according to the presence of each symptom in the overall
study sample and stratified by age groups. As a sensitivity analysis, we reran the logistic regression on
the individuals presenting only one symptomatic episode. To take into account the co-occurrence of
symptoms, we fit multivariable logistic regression models to estimate sex-adjusted and mutually
adjusted ORs. For asymptomatic status, we only adjusted the ORs for sex and age. The absence of a
symptom was defined as the reference value for each symptom, while for the asymptomatic variable,
not being asymptomatic was considered the reference value. Analyses were done using R statistical
software.(23)

Results
Between April 6th and June 30th, 2020, we enrolled 8’344 participants between the ages of 5 and 94
(902 children < 18 years, and 7442 adults), with a mean age of 46.9 years. The study sample included

4’379 former Bus Santé participants and 3’965 household members, corresponding to a 42%
participation rate of all people invited by email (Figure S1).
Compared with the population of the Canton of Geneva, in SEROCoV-POP, the 50-74 age group was
overrepresented (46.6% vs. 27.4%), while the 5-9, 20-49 and ≥75 age groups were slightly
underrepresented. SEROCoV-POP participants also had generally higher levels of education than the
Geneva population, with more participants having received a tertiary education (57.7% vs. 39.3%),
and less having attended mandatory school only (6.8% vs. 28.1%) (Table S1).

Seroprevalence and relative risk of seropositivity by age and sex
SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence over the study period was 7.8 % (95% Credible Interval (CrI) 6.8-8.9,
Table 1). The seroprevalence was 7.1% (95% CrI 5.5-8.7) over the first study month, increased to
9.0% (95% CrI 7.5-10.5) during the second month, before decreasing again to 7.1% (95% CrI 5.7-8.5)
in the final study month (Table 1).
Men had a 22% (95% CrI 6-40%) higher risk of being seropositive than women. Seroprevalence was
highest in the 18-49 age group (9.5%, 95% CrI: 8.1-10.9) and lowest in young children < 10 years
(4.3%, 95% CrI 2.2-7.0) and the elderly ≥ 75 years (4.7%, 95% CrI 2.8-7.0). Seroprevalence estimates
by 10-year age groups are provided in Table S3.

Socio-economic, lifestyle and health-related risk factors
After adjusting for age and sex, there was a significant difference in the distribution of seropositive
participants according to employment status (Table 2). The mixed effect logistic model analysis
adjusting for age and sex showed lower odds of being seropositive in female retirees (OR 0.46, 95%
CI 0.23-0.93) and unemployed men (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.13-1.0) compared to employed individuals of
the same sex. However, we did not observe any significant association between occupational

study participants (N = 7’329) by SARS-CoV-2 serology test result, and association with
serological status.

Overall, 67.8% of the participants reported some change in work linked to the COVID-19 epidemic,
such as working remotely (43.0%), taking a sick leave (1.0%) or becoming unemployed (3.3%). A
marked 33.6% of those who took a sick leave were seropositive, as opposed to 6.1% to 7.8% in all
other categories.
Though not statistically significant, there seemed to be a gradient in the association of education with
seropositivity, from mandatory schooling only (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.43-2.2) all the way up to
university level (OR 1.7, 95% CI 0.88-3.2), when compared to individuals with a doctoral education.
This effect was stronger in women than men.
Current smokers had 64% lower odds of being seropositive compared to never smokers (OR= 0.36,
95% CI 0.23-0.55). There was no significant association between body mass index or chronic health
conditions and seropositivity, although obese women tended to have higher odds of seropositivity
compared to participants with a normal BMI (OR 1.9, 95% CI 0.95-3.7). A history of close contact

Symptoms reported over one or more episodes
The symptoms most frequently reported by seropositive participants were fatigue (57% of
seropositive participants), headache (52%), sneezing and/or rhinorrhea (48%), fever (46%), cough
(46%), anosmia and/or dysgeusia (44%), and myalgia and/or arthralgia (43%) (Table 3). Seronegative
individuals, on the other hand, most frequently reported sneezing/rhinorrhea (32%), while only 3%
reported loss of taste or smell. Thirteen percent of seropositive participants reported no symptoms,
versus 43% of seronegative participants. Not reporting any symptoms during the study period reduced
by five the odds of being seropositive.

Table 3. Frequency of symptoms reported in all age groups

We observed age variations in the symptomatology associated with being seropositive. In children
<18 years old, anosmia and/or dysgeusia (OR 16.0, 95%CI 7.0-36.2), cough and/or fever (OR 1.8,
95%CI 1.1-3.1) and systemic symptoms (OR 1.9, 95%CI 1.0-3.2) were the groups of symptoms most
strongly associated with seropositivity (Figure 1). On the contrary, among participants 65 years and

older, dyspnea (OR 4.5, 95%CI 2.4-7.8), digestive symptoms (OR 3.1, 95%CI 1.7-5.2) and upper
airways symptoms (OR 2.5, 95%CI 1.6-4.9) were more strongly associated with seropositivity than in
the other age categories, although CIs overlap. In all age categories, those not reporting symptoms
were less likely to be seropositive, although this association was strongest in the 18-64 years old age
group (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.12-0.23) and weakest in children (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30-0.97).

Systemic symptoms: presence of either fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia or loss of appetite.
Upper airways symptoms: presence of either sneezing/rhinorrhea, sore throat or both.
Digestive symptoms: one or more of abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting and diarrhea.

bars correspond to 95% confidence intervals of odds ratios.

In the multivariate analysis with co-adjustment of symptoms we observed that nausea and/or
vomiting, abdominal pain, and sore throat were negatively associated with being seropositive (Table
S11).
Results for seroprevalence, risk factor and symptom analyses were mostly consistent when using the
IFA confirmatory test (Supplement Tables S3, S10, S13 and S14). Frequency of symptoms and their
association with being seropositive was also generally similar when considering only participants with
one symptomatic episode at most (Supplement Tables S15 and S16).

Discussion
This study including 8344 participants recruited between April and June 2020 confirms preliminary
results showing that less than 10% of the general population of the canton of Geneva had developed
anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies over the course of the first epidemic wave.(4) Consistent with our
previously published interim analysis, children under 10 years old and individuals over 65 years old
had the lowest risk of being seropositive, with males at higher risk than females. We did not identify
clear associations between socioeconomic variables and serological status. Smoking appeared to
reduce the odds of being SARS-CoV-2-seropositive, while no significant associations were found
with other lifestyle and health-related risk factors. The reported symptom most strongly associated
with seropositivity was anosmia/dysgeusia, followed by systemic symptoms such as loss of appetite,
fever, fatigue and myalgia and/or arthralgia.
The average seroprevalence of 7.8% over our 12-week study period is in line with estimates from
highly affected areas in other European countries.(2,5–7) The slight decrease in seroprevalence in the
final weeks of our study may be due to sampling variation, caused by previously SARS-CoV-2infected individuals being more prone to participate in the study during lockdown, which took place at
an earlier phase of our study. Also, recruitment by postal mail of participants without a known email
address (mostly elderly individuals) having begun during the second month of our study, older
individuals came more frequently during the final month, thus possibly contributing to the decreasing
seroprevalence. However, waning antibody levels after an initial infection might be another
explanation for the observed decrease. Similar observations have been made in a large serosurvey in
the United Kingdom (REACT2), where the adult population seroprevalence declined from 6.0% to
4.4% between June and September 2020.(3) Weekly fluctuations in the crude proportion of
seropositive participants (Table S2) could not be attributed to any laboratory issues, demographic
differences, or recruitment effects and may thus be attributed to random variations.

Consistent with previous serosurveys,(2) our study shows a significantly higher risk of infection in
men (RR 1.22, 95% CrI: 1.06-1.40) than in women. This difference should be considered when
evaluating the increased risk of complications and mortality in men found in previous research.(24)
We also found the highest relative risk for infection in adults of working age, teenagers and
preadolescents while children and older adults had lower relative risks and seroprevalence. While
advanced age is now widely recognized as a risk factor for complications and increased mortality(25),
the relationship between age and susceptibility to infection likely depends on multiple factors. Our
study, like other serosurveys, was partly conducted during a lockdown. As such, it is likely that the
measures in place affected adults, children and elderly individuals differently. Better social isolation
and a strict application of preventive measures could have been more widely adopted by the elderly,
out of fear of suffering from severe complications. Also, school closures may have contributed to the
low seroprevalence observed in young children in our study, although recent household analyses
based on this study suggest that children may be at reduced risk of infection even if exposed.(26)
Adults of working age, on the other hand, could have had more difficulty effectively isolating from
social contacts, since they were likely the ones to do grocery shopping and might have been essential
workers, as evidenced by only a minority of participants (43.0%) having reported working remotely
since the beginning of the pandemic. However, an immunological cause for the lower seroprevalence
in young children and older individuals cannot be excluded at this stage.
Odds of seropositivity were significantly reduced for retired women and unemployed men compared
to employed individuals of the same sex, after adjusting for age. Seroprevalence was also lower,
although with borderline significance, for all retired and unemployed individuals. This could be due to
these individuals having more flexibility in their daily routine allowing them to better self-isolate
during the epidemic. While educational level was not significantly associated to the risk of infection,
we did see trends of increasing association to seropositivity with increased educational levels, except
for doctoral-level education. It is possible that the risk associated with each educational level is linked
to the types of profession open to these individuals, which can be quite heterogenous, making it

difficult to see significant differences. Finally, no significant association was found between median
living-area-based income and SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity.
Similar to previous reports, we found that current smokers were less likely to be seropositive.(5)
Several hypotheses exist, including the effects of smoking on the expression of the angiotensinconverting-enzyme 2 receptor in cells of the respiratory tract and the competition between nicotine
and SARS-CoV-2 for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nACfR), which acts as a co-receptor for
viral cell entry.(27) Further work is needed to understand the behaviors that may contribute to this
association, such as potential risk-averting behavior in smokers out of fear of respiratory
complications of COVID-19. Confirming previous rt-PCR-based studies,(28) in our sample, anosmia
was frequently reported in seropositive (44%) but rarely in seronegative participants (3%), with
individuals reporting this symptom being almost 25 times more likely to be seropositive than those
who did not. However, as previously reported (29,30), the correlation was weaker among individuals
aged 65 years and older, possibly because the senses of taste and smell tend to decrease with age, thus
making the symptom less discriminant.(31,32) A recent meta-analysis based on rt-PCR diagnosis
estimated the proportion of asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 at 20% (95% CI 17–
25%) with a prediction interval of 3%–67%.(33) However, due to the short window of relatively high
sensitivity of rt-PCR, not all asymptomatic individuals are captured by molecular testing. Also,
individuals considered asymptomatic at time of rt-PCR are potentially just presymptomatic .(34)
Serological data mostly elude these difficulties if the delay between symptoms and testing is long
enough. In our sample, 13% of IgG-positive and 43% of seronegative individuals reported being
asymptomatic. As such, the number of true asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals in
our sample is likely underestimated, due to the possibility to report symptoms related to multiple
episodes.
Our study found some age-related differences in terms of clinical presentation. In the less than 18year-olds, only fever, cough and systemic symptoms were associated with seropositivity, whereas in
adults, all symptom groups were significantly associated with seropositivity. Also, while being
asymptomatic reduces the odds of seropositivity almost five-fold in the overall study population, odds

were only twice reduced in children, with a higher percentage of asymptomatic positive children than
in positive adults (37% vs. 10%, table S11).
Our study comes with a number of limitations. The Bus Santé source population was originally
composed of individuals between 20 and 75 years old, explaining the lower number of participants
aged less than 18 and over 75 years in our final sample, despite the inclusion of primary participants’
household members. Delayed recruitment by ordinary mail of participants without an email address
on file is likely to have had an influence on weekly seroprevalence results. Further, the association of
income level with a seropositive status could not be assessed exactly, as we did not collect individual
participants’ income, but estimated income based on the place of residency. Memory bias has likely
influenced symptoms analysis,as participants were asked to report symptoms having occurred up to
six months earlier. Second, symptoms reported by IgG-positive participants might have been caused
by other pathogens as 1644 participants reported multiple episodes. Finally, the severity of the disease
was not addressed in this study.
Our study determined that the average seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the canton of Geneva over
the course of the first wave was 7.8 %, leaving most of the population naïve to the virus.(35) Our risk
factor analysis indicates that while some socio-economic disparities in susceptibility to the infection
do exist, they are likely more complex than what we previously thought. Older individuals seemed to
be protected from infection during the first wave, perhaps due to targeted preventive measures. Some
important observations could be made regarding differences in symptoms among age groups, such as
the proportion of asymptomatic infections. However, future serosurveys should focus on larger
samples of young children and the elderly to yield more detailed age-specific results regarding
symptoms.
As sufficient vaccination of the population will likely take time, repeated seroprevalence surveys will
be crucial to monitor the progression of the epidemic. Following up seropositive individuals will
allow for determining the extent of the immune protection conferred by specific antibodies against reinfection by SARS-CoV-2, as well as provide insight on the prevalence of “long COVID”. Also,

better characterization of the socio-demographic risk factors for infection is needed to further improve
prevention strategies. These measures will be of paramount importance to guide public health policy
in order to effectively manage future outbreaks of COVID-19.
