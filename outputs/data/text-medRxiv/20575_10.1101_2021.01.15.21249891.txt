Abstract

16

Background: Upper respiratory samples used to test for SARS-CoV-2 virus may be

17

infectious and present a hazard during transport and testing. A buffer with the ability to

18

inactivate SARS-CoV-2 at the time of sample collection could simplify and expand testing for

19

COVID-19 to non-conventional settings. Methods: We evaluated a guanidium thiocyanate-

20

based buffer, eNAT™ (Copan) as a possible transport and inactivation medium for downstream

21

RT-PCR testing to detect SARS-CoV-2. Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 in eNAT

22

and in diluted saliva was studied at different incubation times. The stability of viral RNA in

23

eNAT was also evaluated for up to 7 days at room temperature (28°C), refrigerated conditions

24

(4°C) and at 35°C. Results: SARS-COV-2 virus spiked directly in eNAT could be inactivated at

25

>5.6 log10 PFU/ml within a minute of incubation. When saliva was diluted 1:1 in eNAT, no

26

cytopathic effect (CPE) on vero-E6 cell lines was observed, although SARS-CoV-2 RNA could

27

be detected even after 30 min incubation and after two cell culture passages. A 1:2

28

(saliva:eNAT) dilution abrogated both CPE and detectable viral RNA after as little as 5 min

29

incubation in eNAT. SARS-CoV-2 RNA from virus spiked at 5X the limit of detection remained

30

positive up to 7 days of incubation in all tested conditions. Conclusion: eNAT and similar

31

guanidinium thiocyanate-based media may be of value for transport, preservation, and

32

processing of clinical samples for RT- PCR based SARS-CoV-2 detection.

Introduction

38

Simple and rapid methods to detect SARS-CoV-2 have the potential to aid in controlling

39

the spread of COVID-19 [1-3]. However, clinical samples obtained for SARS-CoV-2 testing can

40

present a biohazard during transport or after being opened in a testing laboratory [4]. Clinical

41

samples obtained at home or in remote locations can leak during transport to a testing laboratory,

42

presenting a biohazard anywhere along this transport chain. Furthermore, the CDC recommends

43

that tests for SARS-CoV-2 should be performed inside a biosafety cabinet in a BSL-2 laboratory

44

setting (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/lab-biosafety-guidelines.html) to ensure

45

worker safety. These strict testing requirements limit the locations where SARS-CoV-2 assays

46

can be safely performed. A transport buffer that inactivates SARS-CoV-2 while remaining

47

suitable for RT-PCR detection assays would mitigate these safety threats and simplify

48

widespread COVID-19 testing.

49

Many of the physical (heat, ultraviolet light, gamma irradiation) and chemical

50

(detergents, alcohol) methods used for viral inactivation or RNA extraction are either unsuitable

51

for creating a safe transport media [5-9] or require additional downstream sample processing that

52

would complicate rapid point of care COVID-19 tests [10]. Buffers and reagents containing

53

guanidium hydrochloride and guanidinium thiocyanate have shown to inactivate SARS-CoV-2,

54

and these reagents can be used for RT-PCR applications [5, 9, 11, 12]. The eNAT (Copan

55

Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA) is a guanidium thiocyanate based medium designed to be used for

56

specimen collection and transport as it can stabilize nucleic acids for prolonged periods of time

57

(https://www.copanusa.com/sample-collection-transport-processing/enat/) [13]. In this study, we

58

evaluated the effectiveness of this media for inactivating SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture

59

supernatants and virus-spiked saliva matrix and its ability to be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 in

60

the point-of-care Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay. We also studied the stability of viral RNA in

61

presence of a clinical matrix added to this medium. The findings of this study can be used to

62

simplify sample collection, transport, and COVID-19 diagnostic workflows, potentially

63

increasing access to testing and reducing the time to testing results.

66

Ethical considerations. The use of saliva from confirmed COVID-19 negative
volunteers was approved by Rutgers Institutional Review Board, IRB# 2020001786.

67

Cell and viral culture. Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) were maintained in the

68

Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA)

69

supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, Thermo Fisher

70

Scientific, Waltham, MA) and 100 units/ml of penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, Thermo Fisher

71

Scientific, Waltham, MA) at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO2. SARS-CoV-2 strain USA-

72

WA1/2020 was obtained from the World Reference Collection for Emerging Viruses and

73

Arboviruses (WRECVA) at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB, Galveston, TX)

74

and further propagated in Biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratory at the Regional Biocontainment

75

Laboratory (RBL), Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ. All cell lines and virus

76

cultures were maintained at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO2 unless otherwise mentioned. All

77

experiments in this study were performed inside a biosafety cabinet within a BSL3 containment

78

facility. To generate working virus stocks, Vero E6 cells were infected with an MOI of 0.01 in

79

DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS. Cells were harvested at 72 hours post-infection,

80

supernatants were collected and centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000Xg, aliquoted and stored at -

81

80°C.

82

Virus quantitation. SARS-CoV-2 virus titers were determined using both plaque assays

83

and the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) method. Plaque assays were performed

84

following standard procedures [14-16] with some modifications. Briefly, Vero E6 cells were

85

seeded into 6-well plates (5X105 cells/well) 24 hours before infection. Ten-fold serial dilutions

86

of virus stock were added onto wells (400µl/well) and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C with

87

intermittent shaking every 15 min to prevent the cell monolayers from drying. After 1 hour of

88

virus adsorption, 4ml of 0.8% agarose in DMEM supplemented with 4% FBS was added to each

89

well and incubated for 2-3 days at 37°C/CO2 incubator. The plaques were developed by fixing

90

the cells with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 1h at room temperature (RT). The agarose plug was

91

removed before staining with 0.2% crystal violet (in 20% ethanol for 15 min at RT). The wells

92

were washed with tap water, dried and the plaques were counted. TCID50 assays were

93

performed by seeding 96-well plates with Vero E6 cells (2X104 cells/well) the day before the

94

assay. Ten-fold serial dilutions of virus stock were added onto wells (100µl/well) and incubated

95

for 7-10 days at 37°C/CO2 incubator. The plates were observed for presence of cytopathic effect

96

(CPE) every day. TCID50 titers were calculated using the Reed and Muench method [17].

97

Removal of cytotoxicity. Four different approaches were explored to remove

98

cytotoxicity induced by the transport media in the absence of the virus. Pierce 4ml Detergent

99

Removal Spin Column (DRSC, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), Amicon Ultra 4ml

100

100KDa centrifugal filter units (Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO), PD 10 desalting spin columns

101

(Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and Slide-A-Lyzer G2 dialysis cassette (Thermo Fisher

102

Scientific, Waltham, MA) were prepared according to each manufacturer’s instructions. Two ml

103

of eNAT (Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA) was added to 100 µl of DMEM without the virus,

104

mixed and then processed using each method. Both PD 10 columns and Slide-A-Lyzer G2

105

dialysis cassettes were equilibrated with PBS before adding samples. For the Slide-A-Lyzer G2

106

dialysis cassette, the 2.1 ml samples were added and the cassette was dialyzed overnight at room

107

temperature in PBS with a total of five buffer changes. For Amicon ultra filters, the 2.1 ml

108

samples were added, centrifuged at 4,000 x g for 10 min and washed three times with 2ml of

109

PBS. For PD 10 columns, the 2.1 ml samples were added and the eluate was collected by

110

centrifugation at 1000 x g for 2 min. For the Pierce DRSC columns, the 2.1 ml samples were

111

split into two 1.05 ml samples that were each added to one of two columns, incubated for 2 min

112

at room temperature and then eluted by centrifugation at 1000 x g for 2 min. Four hundred

113

microliters of the samples processed by each method were then added to Vero E6 cells in 6-well

114

plates, incubated at 37°C/CO2 incubator and observed daily for cytotoxicity for up to 7 days. We

115

also tested eNAT and AVL buffers directly and by dilution on Vero E6 cell lines without prior

116

purification to confirm cytotoxicity in the absence of any purification steps, which showed

117

cytotoxicity until 1:1000 dilution.

118

Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 treated with eNAT. Viral inactivation with eNAT was

119

explored in two different approaches; 1) by spiking the virus directly to the eNAT, simulating a

120

swab sample that is placed into a transport media; and 2) by diluting a clinical sample such as

121

saliva in eNAT, simulating a self-collected sample transport scenario. For the first approach,

122

100µl of the SARS-CoV-2 virus culture (8X106 PFU/ml) was added to 2ml of eNAT, mixed and

123

incubated for 0, 1, 2, 5, 10 and 15 min at room temperature. After incubation, the entire sample

124

was processed using Pierce 4ml DRSC to remove cytotoxic components from eNAT. For the

125

second approach, one-ml of confirmed COVID-19 negative saliva was spiked with 100 µl of

126

SARS-CoV-2 (3X106 PFU/ml) and then added to eNAT at 1:1 and 1:2 sample to eNAT ratio.

127

The samples were incubated at room temperature for 10, 15 and 30 min for the 1:1 ratio and 5,

128

10, 15 min for the 1:2 ratio. Samples were then processed with the DRSC columns as described

129

above. We performed two negative controls for both approaches. The first negative control

130

consisted of 100 µl of virus free DMEM, which was added to 2 ml of eNAT at both 1:1 and 1:2

131

ratio; the second negative control consisted of 100 µl of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that was spiked

132

into 400 µl of AVL buffer (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) and then heated to 92°C for 15 min to

133

inactivate the virus. As a positive control, 100 µl of SARS-CoV-2 was spiked into 2 ml of

134

DMEM. Positive control samples were also assessed before and after DRSC purification to

135

determine viral loss during this process. All controls were performed in either duplicate or

136

triplicate for each experiment.

137

Calculating eNAT sterilizing activity. Viral cytopathic effect (CPE) was determined in

138

all samples by both direct infection in Vero E6 cell lines in 6-well plates and TCID50 assay by

139

serial diluting of the samples on 96-well plates. For TCID50 assay, samples were diluted ten-fold

140

in DMEM+2%FBS and titers were calculated by Reed & Muench method [17]. Viral titer

141

reduction was determined by subtracting the viral titer for the treated samples from the untreated

142

samples. For serial passaging of the samples, each 2 ml replicate of the DRSC column purified

143

sample was added into 4 different wells (500 µl of the sample in each well) in a 6-well plate and

144

incubated at 37°C/5% CO2 for up to 14 days, with two passages every 5 to 7 days. The plates

145

were checked daily under an inverted microscope for the presence of CPE. All samples were also

146

tested by RT-PCR at days 7 and 14 of serial passaging using the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 test

147

(Xpert, Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA). The Xpert test reports amplification of sequences of the

148

envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N2) genes. Positive results were indicated by the detection of

149

either the N2 target or both E and N2 targets.

150

Integrity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in eNAT. The stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in eNAT

151

was evaluated for a period of 7 days. Negative saliva samples were spiked with SARS-CoV-2

152

virus at 5X the LOD (0.05 PFU/ml) previously established for nasopharyngeal (NP) matrix using

153

the Xpert test [18]. Samples were either swabbed and/or diluted 1:2 in eNAT. All samples were

154

stored at three different temperatures (4°C, 28°C and 35°C) and viral RNA was measured at

155

different time points (0h, 4h, 24h, 48h and 168 h) using the Xpert test.

156

Statistical analysis. Standard statistical analyses (average, standard deviation, and

157

ANOVA) were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.4.3 for Windows.

158

Results

159

Removal of basal cytotoxicity. Both eNAT and AVL buffers are cytotoxic to Vero E6

160

cell lines when used directly. We explored four different methods of purification as listed in

161

Table 1. Microscopic observation of the Vero E6 cell lines in a 6-well plate revealed that the

162

buffers purified through DRSC columns and Slide-A-Lyzer G2 dialysis cassettes did not show

163

any cytotoxic effect to Vero E6 cells for up to 7 days. However, the filtrates from PD 10 and

164

Amicon ultra columns were cytotoxic within 24 hours (Table 1).

165

Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 with eNAT. eNAT, a guanidine-thiocyanate based sample

166

transport medium is claimed to maintain the integrity of nucleic acids for long periods

167

(https://www.copanusa.com/sample-collection-transport-processing/enat/). We evaluated the

168

ability of eNAT as a transport media to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 directly (simulating swab

169

samples) or when diluted with saliva. The virus was added directly to eNAT at the final

170

concentration of 8X105 PFU/ml, incubated for 0, 1, 2, 5, 10 and 15 min and filtered using DRSC

171

columns. Vero E6 cell lines were infected with the flow through from these samples and

172

observed for cytopathic effect for up to 14 days with two passages. All test samples and controls

173

were processed and tested on Vero E6 cells in the same manner. We found that the negative

174

controls did not cause any CPE while a 100 µl positive control containing 8X106 PFU/ml of

175

SARS-CoV-2 resulted in high CPEs within 48-72 hours of infection in Vero E6 cells. After 14

176

days of incubation and two passages, both replicates of the test samples incubated in eNAT for 0

177

min produced CPEs and were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR with an average N2 cycle

178

threshold (Ct) 37.4±1.6 (Table 2). We did not observe any visible CPE after 1 min of incubation

179

in eNAT; however, the RT-PCR assay was positive in 1 out of 2 replicates (Ct 37.4). Extending

180

eNAT incubation to 2 min through 15 mins eliminated both CPE and any RT-PCR positivity,

181

demonstrating a >5.6 log10 PFU/ml reduction in the viral load (Table 2).

182

We further explored the ability of eNAT to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 when diluted in a

183

sample such as saliva. We spiked SARS-CoV-2 (3X106 PFU/ml) into SARS-CoV-2 negative

184

saliva and then incubated the samples with eNAT at 1:1 and 1:2 (sample to eNAT) ratios for

185

different time points at room temperature. After 14 days of incubation and 2 passages, eNAT

186

alone and AVL buffer negative controls, maintained cell integrity without any visible CPEs and

187

positive control showed CPEs within 48 hours (N2-Ct=13.8; Table 3). Although we did not

188

observe any CPEs under any test conditions, the 1:1 saliva/eNAT mixtures were found to be

189

SARS-CoV-2 positive by RT-PCR with N2-Ct >40 in all replicates (3/3) after 10 and 15 min of

190

incubation. Even after 30 min of incubation in eNAT, 2/3 samples were positive for SARS-CoV-

191

2 by RT-PCR. However, the spiked saliva samples that were mixed with 1:2 ratios of eNAT

192

appeared to be completely inactivated (calculated SARS-CoV-2 inactivation efficacy >5.6 log10

193

PFU/ml) after as little as 5 min incubation with the eNAT.

194

Stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in eNAT. We evaluated the stability of the SARS-COV-

195

2 RNA in saliva treated with eNAT over a range of storage times and temperatures. SARS-COV-

196

2 virus was spiked into saliva samples at 5X the established NP LOD (0.05 PFU/ml) of the Xpert

197

test, and the samples were added to eNAT either as swab samples or saliva/eNAT mixed at 1:2

198

ratio. The samples were stored at 4°C, 28°C and 35°C and were periodically tested for the

199

presence of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR after 0, 4, 24, 48 and 168 h (7 days) of storage. As shown

200

in Fig. 1A, the RNA was stable for the swab samples stored in eNAT under all conditions as

201

indicated by N2 gene cycle threshold (Ct) (P>0.05). In saliva samples diluted 1:2 in eNAT, the

202

RNA was stable until 168 h at 4°C and for 48 h at 28°C (P>0.05, Fig. 1B). However, average

203

N2-Ct increased by 3 Ct values at 28°C after 7 days (P=0.004), as well as a significant decrease

204

in RNA in as little as 24 hours in samples incubated at 35°C (P=0.01). The RNA detection rate

205

remained at 100% positive rate for all samples with very low viral load, through all tested

206

conditions despite the increase in assay Ct values over time and increased temperature.

207

Discussion

208

We have demonstrated that eNAT can rapidly inactivate SARS-CoV-2 present in saliva

209

samples when used at a ratio of 1:2 (sample to eNAT) or higher. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2

210

RNA is stable in eNAT for at least 48 hours at room temperature or below. These results strongly

211

suggest that eNAT can be used to ensure safe handling, collection, transport, storage, and

212

processing of specimens intended to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 using the Xpert test. The safety

213

provided using a viral inactivating buffer may simplify testing in several settings, including

214

home sample collection and rapid assay testing outside of conventional laboratories. Recent

215

studies have shown that buffers containing guanidinium thiocyanate can inactivate SARS-CoV-2

216

[5, 7, 9, 12]. In this study, we conclusively demonstrated that eNAT, a guanidinium thiocyanate10

217

based buffer can be used as a viral inactivation and preservation media for SARS-CoV-2

218

specimens.

219

Saliva is increasing in popularity as an alternative specimen for COVID testing because

220

of its ease of self-collection. However, samples transported by mail can leak due to improper

221

packaging or handling, raising safety concerns [4]. Our studies demonstrate that eNAT can

222

inactivate SARS-CoV-2 spiked saliva samples within 5 minutes when used in 2 volumes of

223

eNAT to 1 volume of the sample. These results can help guide practices for safe specimen

224

handling, transport, and processing, and may permit safe SARS-CoV-2 testing in locations

225

without strict BSL2 practices and/or decontamination procedures.

226

To accurately evaluate the efficacy of viral inactivation, we established rapid methods to

227

remove any background cytotoxicity caused by the buffer in the absence of the virus. We

228

explored several methods involving dilution, dialysis, and column filtration [7, 19-21]. Both

229

dialysis and filtration using Pierce DRSC spin columns resulted in complete removal of basal

230

cytotoxicity from eNAT and did not result in any viral loss. However, our preference was to use

231

DRSC spin columns because this method detoxified samples within minutes compared to the

232

many hours required by a dialysis process. The more rapid processing also ensured that we were

233

able to make accurate determinations of buffer inactivation time. Dilution methods might have

234

been an alternate way to remove cytotoxic components; however, we have observed that eNAT

235

remained cytotoxic even after a 1000-fold dilution (data not shown) and such high dilutions can

236

produce misleading estimates of log titer virus inactivation unless very high titer viral stocks can

237

be tested [7, 13].

238

We suggest that eNAT can be used as part of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing programs in

239

schools, workplaces, prisons, skilled nursing facilities, homeless shelters, and other high-risk

locations, perhaps in combination with sample pooling strategies to decrease total testing costs.

241

The use of eNAT is further supported by our determination that eNAT can help increase the

242

clinical sensitivity of the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 test when used with variety of upper

243

respiratory specimens (Banada et al., submitted for publication). While the use of a sterilizing

244

buffer is only one component of a successful worldwide testing program, the utility of this type

245

of reagent and its potential contributions to designing improved testing strategies should be

246

explored.
