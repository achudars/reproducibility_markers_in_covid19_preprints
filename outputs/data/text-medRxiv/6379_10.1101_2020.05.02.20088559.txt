Key Points
Question: What is the efficacy of remdesivir in reducing advanced disease state or death
from COVID-19 and the length of stay of hospitalization?
Findings: Remdesivir treatment results in a 33% significantly higher odds of discharge, a
29% significantly lower risk of death, and a 39% significantly lower risk for the combined
endpoint of severe status and death. The median time to discharge for the remdesivir treated
group was around half of the median time-to-discharge compared with the control arm.
Meaning: Remdesivir is effective in treating COVID-19 patients in terms of enhancing
recovery and accelerating discharge.

Abstract
While the recent study on the compassionate use of remdesivir for COVID-19 patients
has shown a 68% clinical improvement7 it is a one-arm study that renders the evaluation of
the efficacy in reducing death and the length of stay of hospitalization intractable due to a
lacking of the control group. We came up with a two-arm controlled study design to simulate
the treated and the untreated (control group) group by applying two respective transition
models to the empirical data on dynamics of the disease severity (Figure 2 of the original
article7) that are classified into low- (no and low oxygen supplement), medium- (non-invasive
ventilator and high oxygen supplement), and high-(ECMO and invasive ventilator) from
enrolment until discharge, death or the end of follow-up. By using a simulated two-arm
controlled study, the remdesivir treatment group as opposed to the control group led to a
statistically significantly 29% (95% CI: 22-35%) reduction of death from COVID-19. The
treated group also revealed a 33% (95% CI 28-38%) significantly higher odds of discharge
than the control group. The median time to discharge for the treated group (5.5 days, 16.5
days, and 29.5 days for low-, medium-, and high-risk state, respectively) was around half of
those of the control arm. Our results with a simulated two-arm controlled study have not only
corroborated the efficacy of remdesivir but also made great contribution to designing a
further large-scale randomized controlled trial. They have significant implications for
reducing transmission probability and infectious time of COVID-19 patients when contacting
with susceptible health care workers during hospitalization.

Introduction
As of April 25th, 199,272 deaths out of 2,840,830 confirmed COVID-19 cases,
amounting to 7% case-fatality, have been noted during COVID-19 pandemic. Besides, the
recovery rate is also extremely low to less than 30%.1 To reduce its death and the length of
stay (LOS) in hospitalization resulting from COVID-19, the administration of anti-viral
therapy may provide a solution to treating these emerging infected cases.2-6 The recent study
on the compassionate use of remdesivir for patients with COVID-19,7 albeit it is a one-arm
before-and-after design, has provided a golden opportunity to offer a simulated two-arm
controlled study for evaluation of the efficacy in reducing advanced disease state or death
from COVID-19 and the length of stay of hospitalization.

Material and Methods
The empirical data used for building up the simulated two-arm controlled study and
the following analysis on the efficacy of remdesivir were derived from a recent study on the
compassionate use of remdesivir for 53 patients with COVID-19 as shown in Figure 2 of the
original article that gives a clear profile of dynamics of disease transition according to the
severity of disease from the date of being administered by remdesivir until discharge, death,
or the end of study.7 The risk state of these patients can be classified into low- (no and low
oxygen supplement), medium- (non-invasive ventilator and high oxygen supplement), and
high-(ECMO and invasive ventilator) risk states. The aggregated data on each transition
mode are listed in Table 1 after the translation from the data provided in the original
published article.7
Figure 1 (A) and (B) shows two transition models between the risk state of disease
and also the final destinations of both discharge and death. Figure 1 (B) models the forward
progression, leading to recovery and death, without the use of remdesivir whereas Figure 1
(A) models not only forward progression but also backward regression resulting from the use
of remdesivir.
The estimates derived from the model without the use of remdesivir (Figure 1 (B))
were applied to simulating a pseudo-control group. The treated group with remdesivir that
was also simulated in the light of the corresponding estimates of Figure 1 (A). This simulated
treated group had an adequate fit with the observed data with the administration of remdesivir
(P=0.38). Such a two-arm controlled study, which is equivalent to a randomized controlled
trial, was therefore simulated and used for evaluating the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in
accelerating discharge and decelerating subsequent deaths.

Results
The daily rate of transition between risk states, discharge, and death were estimated
and analyzed by applying a continuous-time Markov model8 with Bayesian Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation in the light of likelihood functions based on aggregated
data as shown in Table 1. As shown in Figures 1(A) and (B) with the corresponding daily
transition rates, the efficacy of remdesivir in reducing subsequent progression to high-risk
state and death was mainly attributed to the two daily regression rates estimated as 0.048
(95% credible interval (CI): 0.027-0.066) from medium-risk to low-risk state and estimated
as 0.155 (95% CI: 0.098-0.227) from high-risk to medium-risk state during hospitalization.
The higher overall discharge rate regardless of risk states in the treated group as opposed to
the control group is mainly explained by the mechanism of two regression rates during
hospitalization, resulting in a double proportion of discharge in the low-risk state in the
treated group as opposed to the control group (0.149 (95% CI: 0.081-0.206) vs 0.070 (95%
CI: 0.030-0.111)). This also accounts for why the rate of discharge in the treated group was
lower for the medium-risk state than the control group because a substantial proportion of
patients regressing from medium-risk to low-risk state in the treated group during
hospitalization. The similar logic is applied to the identical discharge rate between the two
groups given the modest regression rate from high-risk to medium-risk state.
Figure 2 shows the cumulative probabilities of discharge (Figure 2 (A)) and death
(Figure 2(B)) by the two treatment groups during the 28-day follow-up since enrolment. A
higher probability of discharge and a lower probability of death were noted for the treated
group (green). The use of remdesivir led to a statistically significantly 29% reduction of death
(relative risk: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.65-0.78). When the high-risk state and death was combined as
the endpoint, the corresponding reduction was still statistically significant up to 39% (relative
risk: 0.61 (95% CI: 0.58-0.63)). The cumulative discharge probability was 58.6% (95% CI:

57.9-59.5%) for the remdesivir group and 44.1% (95% CI: 42.5-45.7%) for the control group,
respectively, giving a 33% (95% CI 28-38%) significantly higher odds of discharge for the
treated group.
The median time to discharge for the treated group was estimated as 5.5 days, 16.5
days, and 29.5 days for patients with low-, medium-, and high-risk state, respectively, which
was around half of the median time-to-discharge compared with the control arm when the
follow-up time was extended to two months.

Discussion
The advantages of our secondary analysis of the empirical data from the original onearm compassionate study on the use of remdesivir,7 while using the simulated two-arm
controlled study, are three-fold. Firstly, we improved the weakness of a lacking control group
in the original study as a proportion of COVID-19 patients may be discharged with the
recovery dispensing with the use of remdesivir. Second, such a simulated two-arm study
design enables us to evaluate the efficacy of remdesivir with clear primary endpoints
including death and discharge rather than only based on the clinical improvement before and
after the use of remdesivir defined by live discharge from hospital, a decrease of at least 2
points from baseline on the supplementary oxygen use, or both as used in the original article.7
Third, the results from such a simulated two-arm controlled study are supposed to be closer to
those using a real two-arm randomized controlled trial in the near future in terms of intentionto-treat analysis principle. Such a simulated two-arm controlled study may also account for
why the efficacy of reducing death and accelerating discharge in the current two-arm
controlled study was approximately one-third whereas the efficacy of clinical improvement
reported in the original one-arm study without the control group and intention-to-treat
principle was two-thirds.
The results on the efficacy of remdesivir in reducing death and length of stay resulting
from COVID-19 have also two significant implications for containing COVID-19 pandemic.
Firstly, it reduces the sequelae of COVID-19 and also accelerates its recovery. Besides, the
administration of remdesivir may also reduce transmission probability and also infectious
time of the infective in contact with the susceptible subjects. Such an efficacy of prophylactic
and therapeutic anti-viral therapy has been demonstrated in influenza.9-10
In conclusion, a simulated two-arm controlled study based on data from one-arm
compassionate use of remdesivir demonstrates one-third reduction of death and half of

median time-to-discharge attributable to COVID-19. The results would make contribution to
designing a large-scale randomized controlled trial study such as sample size determination
and also have significant implications for reducing transmission probability and infectious
time of COVID-19 patients when contacting with susceptible health care workers during
hospitalization.
