Impact statement
We certify that this work is novel. As of today, studies on the efficacy of corticosteroids did
not specifically target elderly patients.
Among older patients aged over 80 years old, the RECOVERY trial found no difference in
the survival of patients treated or not with dexamethasone. However, the heterogeneity in the
severity of infection within the latter subgroup limited the drawing of strong conclusions

Abstract (227 words)
Objective
To assess the effectiveness of corticosteroids among elderly patients with COVID-19
pneumonia requiring oxygen.
Design
Comparative observational study based on routine care data. Baseline characteristics of
patients were balanced using propensity-score inverse probability of treatment weighting.
Setting
Geriatric and infectious diseases wards from 36 hospitals in France and Luxembourg.
Participants
Adults

൒ 80 years old PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or typical CT-scan images,

requiring oxygen ≥ 3L/min and with an inflammatory syndrome (C-reactive protein ≥
40mg/L).
Measurements
The primary outcome was overall survival at day 14. The secondary outcome was the
proportion of patients discharged from hospital to home/rehabilitation on day 14. Adverse
events were abstracted from electronic health records.
Results
Among the 267 patients included in the analysis, 96 were assigned to the treatment group.
Median age was 86, interquartile range 83 to 90 and 95% had a SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed
diagnosis. Use of corticosteroids was significantly associated with an increased survival
(weighted hazard ratio [wHR] 0.66, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.97). There was no significant difference
between the treatment and control groups regarding the proportion of patients discharged to
home/rehabilitation at day 14 (wRR 1.11, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.81). Twenty-two (16.7%) patients
receiving corticosteroids developed adverse events while only 11 (6.4%) from the control
group did.
Conclusions
Corticosteroids were associated with a significant increase the day-14 overall survival of
patients over 80 years old hospitalized for severe COVID-19.

Background
Older adults are at greatest risk of severe disease and death due to the coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19). Globally, people older than 65 years comprise 9% of the population, yet
account for 30% to 40% of cases and more than 80% of COVID-19-related deaths 1. Although
the WHO recently recommended treatment with systemic corticosteroids for all adult patients
with severe and critical COVID-19 2, the evidence supporting this recommendation for
patients over 80 years old are weak. Indeed, among these patients, the RECOVERY trial
found no difference in the survival of patients treated or not with dexamethasone 3. However,
the heterogeneity in the severity of infection within the latter subgroup limits the drawing of
strong conclusions 4. This situation has raised concerns and, in some countries, such as
France, recommendations do not support the systematic use corticosteroids for patients ≥ 70
years old 5.
Given the high lethality of COVID-19 among older patients and the shortage of ICU beds,
corticosteroids have been frequently administered at the beginning of the epidemic in France
to patients aged 80 years or more. We aimed at using these data to retrospectively emulate a
target trial, with the objective of assessing the effectiveness of corticosteroids as treatment for
severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in elderly patients.

Methods
Participants and settings
Data collected from 36 French non-ICU medical wards were used to emulate a target trial
assessing the effectiveness of corticosteroids in elderly patients with COVID-19 using
methods previously described in 6. All patients hospitalized between March 1st and April 30th
2020 who were aged 80 years or more, who suffered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection
confirmed by PCR or by typical clinical and CT-scan findings, who required oxygen therapy

≥3 L/min, and who had C-reactive protein levels ≥40 mg/L, were included in the study.
Treatment strategies
We compared two treatment strategies: receiving at least one dose of corticosteroids ≥0.4
mg/kg/day eq. prednisone (treatment group), or receiving the standard of care (control group).
The cut-off value of 0.4mg/kg/day was chosen to account for dose rounding by physicians
who had the intent to treat patients with corticosteroids at 0.5 mg/kg/day eq. prednisone. To
emulate a pragmatic trial, patients in the treatment group could start corticosteroids within a
“grace period” of 72h after baseline.

Follow-up
The start of follow-up (baseline or time zero) for each individual was the time all eligibility
criteria (oxygen therapy ≥ 3L/min and inflammatory syndrome with a CRP level ≥ 40mg/L)
were met. All patients were followed up from baseline until whichever of the following events
occurred first: (1) death, (2) loss to follow-up, or (3) end of follow-up, which occurred at least
14 days after baseline.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was overall survival at day 14. The secondary outcome was the
proportion of patients discharged from hospital to home/rehabilitation on day 14. All adverse
events were abstracted from electronic health records in free text and independently recoded
by one physician (VTT).
Statistical analyses
Our causal contrast of interest was the per-protocol effect and we compared characteristics of
participants who received corticosteroids within 72 hours from baseline to those who did not
receive the drug. We thus excluded from the analysis the patients who started corticosteroids
before baseline, the patients who received corticosteroids >72h after baseline, and the patients
who received corticosteroids at a dose lower than 0.4mg/kg per body weight.
Propensity-score methods were used to account for differences between the two groups at
baseline. The propensity score represents the probability for patients to receive corticosteroids
given their baseline demographic and clinical covariates (Details on the propensity score
development are available in the Supplementary materials). Estimates of the average
treatment effect were calculated by inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using
cox proportional hazards models for hazard ratios (wHR) and IPTW estimates of the relative
risk (wRR) for binary outcomes.
To account for immortal time bias, all patients in the control group who died during the grace
period were randomly assigned to one of the two groups, given that their observational data
were compatible with both groups at the time of the event 7.
Missing baseline variables were handled by multiple imputation by chained equations.
Methods are fully described in the Supplementary materials. The study was approved by the
IRB of the Henri Mondor Hospital (2020_060).

Results
Participants
A total of 267 patients included, their median age was 86 years (interquartile range [IQR], 83
to 90), 49.8% were men, 95% had a SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed diagnosis, and 96 were
assigned to the treatment group. Both comorbidities and clinical severity at baseline were
similar between the two groups. However, patients with low autonomy at baseline, measured
using the GIR score, were less often prescribed corticosteroids (14.6% and 20.6% of patients
had a GIR score of 1 or 2 in the treatment and control group, respectively).
The median time from baseline to the symptoms onset was 7 days (IQR, 4 to 10). Among the
96 patients assigned to the treatment group, 51 (53.7%) received methylprednisolone, 22
(23.2%) received prednisone, 15 (15.8%) received dexamethasone, 4 (4.2%) received
prednisolone, and 3 (3.2%) received hydrocortisone (Table).
Follow-up and outcomes
In total, 41 (42.7%) and 86 (50.2%) patients died before day 14 in the treatment and control
groups, respectively (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.09). After balancing the baseline covariates
by IPTW, the survival was significantly higher in for patients from the treatment group
compared to those from the control group, wHR 0.66, 0.44 to 0.97 (Figure). There was no
significant difference between the treatment and control groups regarding the proportion of
patients discharged to home/rehabilitation at day 14 (wRR 1.11, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.81).
Twenty-two (16.7%) patients receiving corticosteroids developed adverse events while only
11 (6.4%) from the control group did: hyperglycemia [6.1% vs. 0.6%], heart failure [2.3% vs.
0.6%], confusion [3.0% vs. 1.2%], infection [1.5% vs. 0%].

Discussion
In the present emulated trial using real-life data, corticosteroids significantly improved the 14days-survival of patients aged 80 years or more and hospitalized in a non-ICU department for
severe COVID-19.
Recommendations to treat older patients with corticosteroids have been based on results from
studies performed in ICU

8

and on results from the RECOVERY trial, which showed an

overall effect of dexamethasone, but a non-significant difference in the population of patients
aged 80 years or more. The discrepancy between the results from the RECOVERY trial and
ours may be explained by the heterogeneity in treatment effect. Indeed, for patients from the

RECOVRY trial who were not under oxygen at the time of randomization (35% of patients
older than 80 years) corticosteroids were not associated with benefit. For those with oxygen at
the time of randomisation, corticosteroids showed a significant reduction in mortality. In our
study, the population was more homogenous and all patients required oxygen and had a
severe - but not critical - disease according to WHO criteria. Our findings fill the evidence
gap for this specific and vulnerable population and support the WHO guidelines to
recommend corticosteroids for patients with severe and critical COVID 19 (defined by any of
oxygen saturation < 90% on room air, respiratory rate > 30 breaths per minute in adults,
and/or signs of severe respiratory distress).
Besides survival, corticosteroids might also shorten the duration of symptoms and/or
hospitalization, and therefore reduce the geriatric complications resulting from SARS-CoV2
infection; such effect was not observed in the present study, although the end point at day 14
might have been too early to objectivize this. Decreasing functional decline, nutrition, and
cognitive impairment is a major issue during the management of COVID-19 and other
infectious diseases in the elderly population 9. Further studies should be performed to explore
this crucial point.
Regarding tolerance, patients treated with corticosteroids experienced more adverse events
than those treated with the standard of care. Nevertheless, those effects remained rare and
there was no major toxicity, especially cardio- or neurotoxicity. WHO experts stated that
potential side effects of corticosteroids are well balanced by their positive effect on mortality.
Moreover, clinicians are used to manage corticosteroids and their side effects. Our results
support this statement.
The present study suffered several limitations. Despite the use of robust methods and
statistical techniques to draw causal inferences, the study remains observational and potential
unmeasured confounders may bias the results

10

. Also, the prescriptions of corticosteroids

were heterogeneous in terms of drugs, time of start, dose, and duration. Finally, the follow-up
was limited at 14 days. Yet, deaths occurred mainly before day 10, and patients particularly
frail were managed frequently in a rescue context without practicing intensive care.
Altogether, our results support the WHO guidelines, and expand them to patients over 80
years old without contra-indication. They send a good signal for elderly, including those
living in long terms care facilities or other institutions where corticosteroids could be
prescribed according to an oxygen criterion, without systematic transfer to the hospital.

Strengthening the therapeutic arsenal for the care of elderly with COVID-19 is critical as
these patients may not fully benefit from vaccination because of the immune-senescence
associated with advanced age and their exclusion from vaccine trials 4.
