ABSTRACT.
Introduction: Little is known about the relation of cognitive impairment (CI) to
COVID-19 mortality. Here, we analyse the frequency of CI in deceased COVID-19
patients.
Methods: We included 477 adult cases that died after admission from March 1 to
March 31, 2020: 281 with confirmed COVID-19, 58 probable COVID-19, and 138 who
died of other causes.
Results: The number of comorbidities was high in the confirmed COVID-19, and CI
was common (30%: 21.1% dementia; 8.9% mild cognitive impairment). Subjects with
CI were older, more lived in nursing homes and had shorter times from symptom onset
to death than those without CI. COVID-19 patients with CI were rarely admitted to the
ICU and fewer received non-invasive mechanical ventilation, but palliative care was
provided more often.
Conclusions: Dementia is a frequent comorbidity in COVID-19 deceased patients. The
burden of COVID-19 in the dementia community will be high.

INTRODUCTION.
On January 7, 2020, Chinese investigators described a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) as the cause of an outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome in Wuhan, China (1). Since
then, the situation escalated rapidly, with an increasing number of cases in many
countries. COVID-19 has had a substantial case fatality rate and a huge impact on
society and healthcare. Previous reports have described some vulnerable demographic
groups associated with death from COVID-19, like male sex, older age, or patients with
comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease or cancer (2).
Information about neurological comorbidities in COVID-19 is scarce until now.
Recently, it has been pointed out that patients with dementia may have an increased risk
of COVID-19, because they can have difficulties to remember safeguard measures, and
many of them live in nursing homes where the disease can spread rapidly (3).
Nevertheless, the first clinical studies that analysed comorbidities and death in COVID19 did not include dementia or cognitive impairment (CI) (4–9). In the present study,
we aim to analyse the frequency of CI and other neurological comorbidities in deceased
patients with COVID-19 in our hospital.

METHODS.
In this retrospective study, we reviewed all patients older than 16 years who died after
admission, from March 1, 2020, to March 31, 2020, at Hospital Universitario 12 de
Octubre, a tertiary hospital situated in Madrid, Spain. Since 2011, the hospital uses
integrated electronic medical records that include all medical encounters and diagnoses.
All data from deceased patients were manually extracted from these records using a
standardized data collection form. Diagnoses of CI had been made by neurologists,
psychiatrists, geriatricians, internal medicine doctors or general practitioners.

Patients were included in three groups according to COVID-19 status, following the
case definition of the European Centre for Diseases Prevention and control (10):
- Confirmed COVID-19 related death. These cases were confirmed through reverse
transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays performed on
nasopharyngeal swabs.
- Probable COVID-19 related death. These cases had clinical, laboratory and
radiological features consistent with COVID-19, but the RT-PCR was negative or could
not be performed.
- Death not related to COVID-19: patients who died from other causes.
The study was reviewed and approved by the local ethics committee / institutional
review board (EC/IRB).
Statistical analyses were undertaken using STATA software 14.0 (StataCorp, College
Station, TX). Continuous variables were presented as median and interquartile range
(IQR), and categorical variables as total number (n) and percentage (%). First, we
compared two groups, those with confirmed COVID-19 and those with other causes of
death. For other analyses we used only COVID-19 confirmed cases, comparing those
with and without CI. Categorical variables were compared using the χ2 test. Means for
continuous variables were compared using independent group t tests. All tests were twosided, and the significance level was set at p<0.05.

RESULTS.
The number of admissions during the study period was 4,156 patients, and 1,970 were
COVID-19 cases. The total number of deaths was 477. Of them, 281 died from
confirmed COVID-19, 58 probable COVID-19, and 138 from other causes.
Demographic characteristics and comorbidities of the three groups are shown in Table

1. Median age was higher in both COVID-19 groups, and the percentage of males was
significantly higher in the COVID-19 confirmed group (62.3% vs. 49.3%, p<0.01).
Comorbidities were common in the three groups. The proportion of subjects with CI
was similar, around 30% in each of them.
[Recommended place for table 1]
Focusing on the confirmed COVID-19 group, CI was the fourth most frequent
comorbidity, after hypertension (69.4%), diabetes (33.8%) and cardiovascular disease
(33.5%). Table 2 analyses separately those with and without CI. Subjects with CI were
older, more of them lived in nursing homes and had with less frequency chronic lung
disease. In this group, 21.1% had dementia (mild: 4.3%; moderate: 10.0%; severe:
6.8%), and 8.9% mild cognitive impairment. The most common diagnoses of CI in the
COVID-19 confirmed group were Alzheimer´s disease (9.3% of all patients), mixed
(7.2%) or vascular CI (4.8%). History of previous stroke or Parkinson´s disease was
more frequent in those with CI. Times from symptom onset to ED and from symptom
onset to death were lower in subjects with CI, and they had fever upon arrival at the ED
with less frequency (32.5% vs. 52.2%, p=0.004). Encephalopathy was the most common
neurological complication in both groups, and it was more common in patients with CI
(32.1% vs. 14.7%, p<0.001). Some aspects of medical care differed between the groups,
as only one patient with CI was admitted to the ICU, and fewer of them received noninvasive mechanical ventilation (7.1% vs. 25.4%, p<0.001). Palliative was provided
more frequently in subjects with CI (79.2% vs. 66.3%, p=0.038).

DISCUSSION.
In March 2020, 339 people have died of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in our
hospital, almost three times more deaths than all the other causes combined during the
whole month. Severe COVID-19 is affecting distinctively older people with chronic
diseases. We found that CI is one of the most common comorbidities in confirmed
COVID-19 (30% of the subjects). This is not surprising, because dementia is a prevalent
and sometimes overlooked underlying cause of death (11), and respiratory infections are
one of the leading immediate cause of death in this population (12). Although the
percentage of CI in COVID-19 deceased subjects is high, our results are not informative
on the risk that CI has on mortality. A recent report has described that dementia could
be a risk factor for mortality in COVID-19 (13), and future researhc will clarify this
issue and explore possible pathophysiological mechanisms. For example, a recent report
has described that the ApoE e4e4 allele increases the risk of severe COVID-19
infection, independent of pre-existing dementia (14).
As expected, medical care was somewhat different in COVID-19 patients with CI, as
they were rarely admitted to the ICU and were treated more frequently with palliative
care to prioritize comfort and symptom management.
Our study has some limitations. First, due to its retrospective design, information about
some of the variables may be incomplete. We tried to carefully review all the clinical
notes in the electronic medical records, but some diagnoses of CI may not have been
recorded. Second, only fatal cases of COVID-19 were included, and we cannot analyse
whether CI is a risk factor for mortality in COVID-19. Third, the study is hospitalbased, and many community-based cohort studies have shown that not all the persons
with dementia seek medical attention, especially those who are very old or have a lower
socio-economic status (15). More importantly, health authorities and research reports

are describing a high case fatality rate of COVID-19 in nursing homes (16), where
people are dying without hospital transfer. By April 17, 2020, more than 20,000 people
with confirmed COVID-19 had died in Spain, 7,132 of them in the Community of
Madrid (17). These numbers are distressing, but they probably reflect only a part of the
impact of COVID-19. The local health authorities have reported that from March 8 to
April 17, 2020, 5,272 of the 44,132 nursing home residents in the Madrid region have
died with symptoms of COVID-19, but the disease could only be confirmed in 837 of
them (18). Considering that the estimated prevalence of dementia in nursing homes of
western European countries ranges from 50 to 75% (19), the number of deaths in people
with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic will be probably high. The 30% of
deceased COVID-19 patients with CI in our study could be an underestimation of the
situation in the community. More research in nursing homes will be needed, taking into
account that dementia is usually under-reported in death certificates (20).
To our knowledge, at least six clinical series have described the clinical characteristics
of fatal cases with confirmed COVID-19 in Asian populations (4–9). These studies have
not included CI in the analysis of comorbidities in COVID-19. A report described the
clinical characteristics of 54 deceased COVID-19 patients (8), and included as a
comorbidity the category “neurologic disease” that grouped together dementia and
stroke. The proportion of patients with neurologic disease was 18.5%, with a marked
difference between those under 70 years (0%), and those over 70 years (29.4%). The
results in the older group could be comparable to our findings. A short report from Italy
mentions a preliminary study in a subsample of 355 patients with COVID-19 who died
and underwent chart review (21). They were also old (mean age 79.5 years), more
frequently male, and 6.8% had dementia. It is a lower proportion than our study
(21.1%), but the brief clinical description does not allow more comparisons.

In summary, our study shows that CI is a common comorbidity in COVID-19 deceased
patients, and it has been relatively overlooked until now. In fact, many guidelines do not
include dementia as a vulnerable group for severe COVID-19. When new public health
threats like COVID-19 emerge, society, governments and research agencies should not
forget previous medical priorities, like neurodegenerative diseases.
