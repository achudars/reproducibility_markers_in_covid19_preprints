Abstract

17

Herein, we performed a genome-wide association study on SARS-CoV-2 genomes to identify genetic

18

variations that might be associated with the COVID-19 severity. 152 full-length genomes of SARS-

19

CoV-2 that were generated from original clinical samples and whose patient status could be

20

determined conclusively as either “asymptomatic” or “symptomatic” were retrieved from the GISAID

21

database. We found that nucleotide variations at the genomic position 11,083, locating in the coding

22

region of non-structural protein 6, were associated with the COVID-19 severity. While the 11083G

23

variant (i.e. having G at the position 11,083) was more commonly found in symptomatic patients,

24

the 11083T variant appeared to associate more often with asymptomatic infections. We also

25

identified three microRNAs that differentially target the two variants, namely miR-485-3p, miR-539-

26

3p, and miR-3149. This may in part contribute to the differential association of the two SARS-CoV-2

27

variants with the disease severity.

Introduction

32

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus

33

disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first reported in Wuhun, Hubei, China in late December 2019 [1,2].

34

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus in the family Coronaviridae [3]. It is the

35

seventh known coronavirus capable of infecting human, after HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV NL63,

36

HKU1, MERS-CoV, and the original SARS-CoV. The former four typically cause non-lethal mild upper

37

respiratory diseases, while the latter two and SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe lethal respiratory

38

illnesses [4,5].

39
40

On 30 January 2020, approximately one month after the first reported outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in

41

China, the virus was found to spread to 19 countries, and the World Health Organization (WHO)

42

declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [6]. After the virus

43

was found to spread to 114 countries, the WHO recognised COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March

44

2020, the first one to be caused by a coronavirus [7]. As of now (27 May 2020), the virus had spread

45

to 213 countries and territories around the world, infecting more than 5,700,000 people [8], and this

46

rapid surge of patients had quickly overwhelmed hospitals in many countries. Although the case-

47

fatality ratio of SARS-CoV-2 (~3–6% [8,9]) is lower than those of SARS-CoV (11%) [10,11] and MERS-

48

CoV (34–37%) [12], due to the great number of infected cases, the number of deaths caused by

49

SARS-CoV-2 is much greater than those by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. To date, at least 350,000

50

deaths had been reported to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection [8].

51
52

The incubation period for COVID-19 is ~4–5 days, with most cases (97.5%) develop symptoms within

53

11–12 days of infection [13]. However, studies have reported that 5–80% of infected cases might be

54

asymptomatic [14]. Several asymptomatic (and presymptomatic) transmissions have been reported

55

[15], suggesting roles of asymptomatic infections in the transmission and spread of the disease.

56

Indeed, it has been proposed that “asymptomatic carriers is a challenge to containment” [16] and

57

that “asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is the Achilles’ heel of Covid-19 pandemic control”

58

[17]. To effectively combat with the spread of the disease, this is therefore important to understand

59

the COVID-19 pathogenesis, and its underlying factors.

60
61

Several host factors that are positively correlated with the COVID-19 severity have been identified,

62

including patient age [9,18], low level of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts, and the high levels of IL-6 and

63

IL-8 [19]. On the other hand, viral factors associated with the COVID-19 severity are still yet to be

64

determined. There are currently more than 30,000 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 sampled from around

examine viral genetic variations that might be correlated with the severity of COVID-19 on the global

68

scale. In this study, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 152 SARS-CoV-2

69

genomes to identify potential viral genetic variations that might be associated with the COVID-19

70

severity.

Results and discussion

72

SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences with patient status

73

SARS-CoV-2 genomes with patient status were retrieved from GISAID [20]. At the time of this study,

74

152 genome sequences were full-length (>29,000 nucleotides (nt)), generated from original clinical

75

samples, and had unambiguous patient status, which could be confidently determined either as

76

“asymptomatic” or “symptomatic” (see Materials and Methods). To allow for accurate identification

77

of viral genetic factors associated with COVID-19 severity, only these sequences were analysed.

78

Together with 500 randomly sampled SARS-CoV-2 genomes from GISAID, all which were full-length

79

and had a high sequencing coverage (but did not have clear patient information), we reconstructed a

80

maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny to examine how these 152 SARS-CoV-2 isolates are related to

81

one another and to other sequences. We found that they covered a wide diversity of SARS-CoV-2,

82

distributing across the entire tree (Figure 1). According to the classification scheme and method

83

described in [21], these 152 genomes comprised 16 distinct lineages of SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1). The

84

distribution of asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 were different across lineages however

85

(Χ2 test: score = 50.67, degree of freedom = 28, p-value = 0.005). While symptomatic SARS-CoV-2

86

were found across almost all 16 lineages, majority of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in this dataset were

87

predominantly found to be those of lineage B and B.5. Mirroring this observation, asymptomatic

88

viruses in this dataset were mostly isolated from patients exposed to the virus in Japan (60/72 =

89

83.33%) and India (6/72 = 8.33%), while symptomatic cases were found around the globe (Table 2).

Genetic variations at nucleotide position 11,083 is associated with COVID-19 severity

104

To identify potential viral genetic variations associated with the COVID-19 severity, we performed a

105

GWAS by using TreeWAS [24] – a phylogenetic-based approach for GWAS of microbial genomes,

106

which can take into account the observed virus population structure. The estimated ML tree (Figure

107

1) was used for the population structure correction. Our analysis identified genetic variations at the

108

nucleotide position 11,083 (with respect to the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence, accession

109

number: NC_045512) to be significantly associated with the disease severity (Figure 2). By applying

110

this analysis to all bootstrap trees, we found that this genomic position was identified 751/1,000 =

111

75.1% of the times, suggesting that our result was robust to the population structure uncertainty.

112
113

Two genetic variations were observed at the nucleotide position 11,083, namely thymine (11083T,

114

75/152 = 49.34%) and guanine (11083G, 72/152 = 47.37%). 5 sequences (5/152 = 3.29%) had

115

undetermined nucleotides at this site. We found that asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 tended to have

116

11083T (N(11083T)/N(11083G) = 60/7), while viruses causing symptomatic cases tended to have

117

11083G (N(11083T)/N(11083G) = 15/65) (Figure 2). The relative risk ratio of developing symptoms

118

given 11083G to 11083T is (65/72)/(15/75) = 4.51 times (95% confident interval = 2.85–7.14), and

119

the odd ratio was estimated to be 37.14 by the Wald method (95% confident interval = 14.17–

120

97.33). A study of SARS-CoV-2 from a Shanghai cohort has indeed identified the 11083T variant to be

121

more prevalent in asymptomatic cases (9 in 91 cases = 9.89%) compared to symptomatic cases (1 in

122

21 cases = 4.76%), but the association was not significant [19]. This was likely due to their relatively

123

small data set (N = 112), and different groupings of the disease outcome (where mild symptomatic

124

and asymptomatic cases were grouped together as one and was compared against severe and

125

critical cases), which could potentially mask the effect we observed. Another study identified this

126

nucleotide position as being under a positive selection pressure [25], consistent with our finding. The

127

closest relative of SAR-CoV-2 currently known is the bat coronavirus RaTG13 (GenBank accession

128

number: MN996532) [26], and it has a G at this position, suggesting that G is the ancestral state. We

129

hence designated this mutation 11083G>T. This mutation locates in the coding region of non-

130

structural protein 6 (nsp6, nt 10973–11842), coded by ORF1ab (nt 266–21,555). 11083G>T is a non-

131

synonymous mutation, conferring an amino acid change from leucine (L) to phenylalanine (F) in the

132

nsp6 protein (L37F).

genome-wide association analysis were performed, namely “Terminal test” (left), “Simultaneous test”, and “Subsequent

analyses, we identified genetic variations at the nucleotide position 11,083 (with respect to the reference SARS-CoV-2
genome, NC_045512) to be associated with COVID-19 severity. The null distributions of the scores are shown in red. The

11083G and 11083T variants may interact with human miRNAs differently

148

Interaction between host microRNAs (miRNAs) and viral transcripts has been implicated in

149

pathogenesis of viral diseases [27]. In this study, we examined whether the two virus variants have

150

different modes of binding to human miRNAs by querying their nucleotide sequences against the

151

miRNA database miRDB [28]. Although a coronavirus genome is a positive-sense RNA, negative-

152

sense genomic RNAs are nonetheless generated during their replication, presenting a possibility that

153

it might also interact with human miRNAs. We therefore examined both positive- and negative-

154

strands of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences.

155
156

On the positive strand, two miRNAs were predicted to uniquely target the 11083G with the same

157

(highest) scores, namely miR-485-3p (5'–GUCAUACACGGCUCUCCUCUCU–3') and miR-539-3p (5'–

158

AUCAUACAAGGACAAUUUCUUU–3'). These two miRNAs belong to the same miRNA cluster (chr14:

159

101,047,321–101,047,398, and chr14: 101,055,419–101,055,491, respectively), and share identical

160

seed sequences (5’–UCAUACA–3’), spanning the nt 11,083 (11,082–11,088) (Figure 3). By using the

161

negative-sense sequence as a query, miR-3149 (5’–UUUGUAUGGAUAUGUGUGUGUAU-3’) was

162

predicted to bind to the 11083G variant, and not the 11083T variant (nt c11087–11080). Our

163

analyses did not identify miRNAs that specifically target the 11083T variant but not the 11083G

164

variant. This suggested that the two variants might interact with these three miRNAs differently.

165
166

Potential biological significance of 11083G>T mutation in COVID-19 severity

167

A study demonstrated that miR-485 can down regulate antiviral immunity by interacting with

168

retinoic acid–inducible gene I (RIG-I) mRNA [29], the protein product of which can sense viral RNAs

169

inside the cell, and activates the cell antiviral immune response. It is possible that the two variants of

170

SARS-CoV-2 may interact with miR-485-3p differently, leading to differential host antiviral immune

171

response, and subsequently differential COVID-19 severity. Moreover, one of the most common

172

symptoms of severe COVID-19 is the cytokine release syndrome [30,31]. RIG-I signalling pathway is

173

known to induce production of TNFα [32], which is a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in the

174

cytokine release syndrome [30]. It is thus also possible that the RNA molecules produced by the

175

11083G variant might sequester miR-485-3p, and ultimately lead to over-production of TNF

176

through an unregulated upregulation of the RIG-I pathway, resulting in a severe COVID-19 disease.

177

This result warrants further experimental investigations how the SARS-CoV-2 11083G variant

178

interacts with miR-485-3p.

Figure 3. miR-485-3p, and miR-539-3p, and miR-3149 miRNAs specially target the 11083G variant of SARS-CoV-2, but not
the 11083T variant. Sequences of the two SARS-CoV-2 variants as defined by the genetic variations at the nucleotide
position 11,083 (11083G and 11083T variants) were searched against the miRNA database miRDB [28]. We found that miR485-3p, and miR-539-3p were predicted to specially target the 11083G variant and not the 11083T variant on the positive
strand. miR-3149 was predicted to uniquely target the 11083G variant on the negative strand. The viral genetic variations
are written in bold and underlined. The seed sequences of miRNAs are shown in bold.

188

Regarding miR-539-3p, a recent study showed that it suppresses expression of the pro-angiogenic

189

factor Jagged1 [33] – a ligand for the Notch signalling pathway which controls cell proliferation and

190

differentiation of various cell lineages, including blood vessel formation and sprouting [34,35].

191

Similar to the case of miR-485-3p, the viral RNAs produced by the 11083G variant might sequester

192

miR-539-3p, leading to up-regulation of Jagged1 and subsequently angiogenesis, as observed in

193

several symptomatic COVID-19 patients [36]. In addition to cell proliferation, miR-539 is also known

194

to upregulate autophagy [37], the process by which cells degrade and recycle cellular components

195

[38]. Incidentally, nsp6, the viral protein which the 11083G>T mutation directly affects, has also

196

been reported to interfere with the host autophagy, restricting autophagosome expansion [39,40].

197

This restriction of autophagosome size likely compromises the cell ability to deliver viral components

198

to lysosomes for degradation, and hence favouring virus infection [39]. Together, our results

199

suggested potential roles of autophagy in pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, and should be further

200

investigated.

201
202

In comparison to miR-485-3p and miR-539-3p, the functions of miR-3149 are much less known and

203

well-understood. Nevertheless, it has been reported that patients with acute coronary syndrome

204

had high levels of miR-3149 in their plasma [41]. Whether miR-3149 plays a role in COVID-19

205

pathogenesis is yet to be determined. Similarly, it is still unclear how the 11083T variant interacts

206

with the host and causes an asymptomatic infection. Functional investigation of this mutation is

207

warranted.

Conclusion and final remarks

210

An unprecedented number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been generated at a rapid rate and made

211

publicly available in near real-time like never before. To date, there are more than 30,000 sequences

212

of SARS-CoV-2 genomes made publicly available on the GISAID database [20], and many of these

213

sequences have patient information available. This allowed us to investigate viral genetic factors

214

that might be associated with the COVID-19 severity.

215
216

In this study, we performed a GWAS on 152 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, and identified nucleotide

217

variations at the genomic position 11,083 to be associated with the disease severity. Most of

218

symptomatic cases were found to be infected with the 11083G variant, while the 11083T variant

219

appeared to be associated more often with asymptomatic infections (relative risk ratio = 4.51 (2.85–

220

7.14); odd ratio = 37.14 (14.17–97.33)). The two nucleotide variants, 11083G and 11083T, are non-

221

synonymous, corresponding to L and F at the amino acid position 37 in the nsp6 protein,

222

respectively. Our results have potential applications for the development of better, and more

223

informative test kits, potentially allowing for asymptomatic cases to be distinguished from

224

symptomatic cases. Continual surveillance of COVID-19 should monitor this genomic region as well

225

as its surrounding neighbourhood as they might affect the pathogenesis of COVID-19.

226
227

Bioinformatic analyses suggested that the two variants might interact with the human host miRNAs

228

differently. In particular, the 11083G variant was identified as a potential target of miR-485-3p, miR-

229

539-3p, and miR-3149, while the 11083T variant was not. These differences might contribute to the

230

observed differential association between the two variants and the disease severity. Our results

231

warrant further experimental confirmations to validate biological significance of these genetic

Methods

234

SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences with patient status

235

Genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 with patient status were downloaded from the GISAID database

236

[20] on 18/05/2020 with their metadata. To allow for accurate determination of genetic factors

237

associated with COVID-19 severity, we only analysed sequences whose patient status could be

238

unambiguously determined as either “asymptomatic” or “symptomatic”. We designated a virus to

239

cause an asymptomatic infection if its patient status was either “Asymptomatic/Released” or

240

“asymptomatic”. A virus was determined to cause a symptomatic infection if the patient status was

241

either “Hospitalized in ICU”, “Hospitalized/Deceased”, “ICU; Serious”, “Intensive Care Unit”,

242

“pneumonia (chest X-ray)”, “Severe/ICU”, or “Symptomatic”. Sequences that were not generated

243

from original clinical samples were excluded. Those with ambiguous nucleotides greater than 5% of

244

the total sequence length, and whose total lengths were less than 29,500 nucleotides were also

245

excluded from downstream analyses. Although EPI_ISL_417919 was found to fit the inclusion

246

criteria, manual inspection revealed that it contained many unique nucleotide variants surrounding

247

its multiple undetermined regions of “N”s, likely due to sequencing and / or assembly errors, and

248

had about 4.28% of undetermined nucleotides. It was thus also excluded from our dataset. In total,

249

our dataset comprised 152 sequences. A table of acknowledgements for the sequences used in this

250

study can be found in Table S1.

251
252

Lineage assignment

253

The lineage of all genomes were determined based on the methodology described in [21] by using

254

pangolin (github.com/hCoV-2019/pangolin) with the reference lineage version 07/05/2020 under

255

the default setting. All prediction passed the quality control.

256
257

Phylogenetic analysis

258

500 randomly sampled SARS-CoV-2 genomes were downloaded from GISAID on 21/05/2020 (Table

259

S1), all of which were full-length and had a high sequencing coverage. Together with the 152

260

genomes with patient status, a manually-curated multiple sequence alignment of 652 SARS-CoV-2

261

genomes was constructed. Potential recombination within the alignment was checked by using RDP,

262

GENECONV, Chimera, MaxChi, and 3Seq, all implemented in Recombination Detection Program 4

263

[42]. Sites with more than 50% ambiguous nucleotides were excluded from recombination analysis.

264

Sites with the most common nucleotide present in more than 99% of the sequences were also

265

excluded. None of the program found evidence for recombination events within the data, suggesting

266

that our dataset was recombinant-free.

267
268

A maximum likelihood phylogeny was estimated from the prepared full-length alignment by using

269

IQ-TREE [22]. The best-fit nucleotide substitution models was determined to be GTR+I+F under the

270

Bayesian information criterion by using ModelFinder [23] and was used for the tree reconstruction.

271

The bootstrap clade support was computed by using 1,000 pseudoreplicate datasets.

272
273

Identification of genetic variations associated with COVID-19 severity

274

TreeWAS [24] was used to identify potential genetic variations associated with COVID-19 severity,

275

defined as two discrete traits: “asymptomatic” and “symptomatic”. The estimated ML tree was used

276

for the population structure correction. The tree was rooted by assuming that lineage A and B of

277

SARS-CoV-2 are monophyletic, and was pruned to contain only those with patient status before the

278

analysis as recommended. Three tests of association were performed, including the "terminal",

279

"simultaneous", and "subsequent" tests. Sites with more than 50% ambiguous nucleotides were

280

removed. Sites with the most common nucleotide present in more than 95% of the sequences were

281

also removed. Only 15 variant loci remained after the filtering. Ancestral states of both genetic and

282

phenotypic data were inferred under a maximum likelihood framework as implemented in the

283

package. The number of sites simulated for estimating the null distribution was 1,000×15 = 15,000

284

sites. The overall threshold of significance was set to 5%, and corrected to be 5%/15/3 = 0.11% in

285

each test under the Bonferonni multiple-testing correction criteria as recommended. An association

286

was considered significant if it was detected by at least one of the three tests aforementioned. We

287

also apply this analysis to all of the 1,000 trees in the bootstrap tree distribution obtained from the

288

phylogenetic analysis described above to examine the robustness of the result. Our analyses robustly

289

identified nucleotide variations at the genomic position 11,083 (with respect to the reference SARS-

290

CoV-2 genome, NC_045512) to be significantly associated with the disease severity.

291
292

microRNA analyses

293

To examine potential biological significance of the identified genetic variations, we searched the two

294

sequence variants against the microRNA database miRDB [28] under the default settings, available at

295

http://mirdb.org/.
