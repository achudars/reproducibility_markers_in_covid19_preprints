Abstract:

20

The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc globally, and there has been a particular concern

21

for sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where models suggest that the majority of the population will

22

become infected. Conventional wisdom suggests that the continent will bear a higher burden of

23

COVID-19 for the same reasons it suffers high burdens of other infectious diseases: ecology,

24

socio-economic conditions, lack of water and sanitation infrastructure, and weak health systems.

25

However, so far SSA has reported lower incidence and fatalities compared to the predictions of

26

standard models and the experience of other regions of the world. There are three leading

27

explanations, each with very different implications for the final epidemic burden: (1) low case

28

detection, (2) differences in COVID-19 epidemiology (e.g. low R0), and (3) policy interventions.

29

The low number of cases to date have led some SSA governments to relax these policy

30

interventions. Will this result in a resurgence of cases? To understand how to interpret the lower-

31

than-expected COVID-19 case data in Madagascar, we use a simple age-structured model to

32

explore each of these explanations and predict the epidemic impact associated with them. We

33

show that the current incidence of COVID-19 cases can be explained by any combination of the

34

late introduction of first imported cases, early implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions

35

(NPIs), and low case detection rates. This analysis reinforces that Madagascar, along with other

36

countries in SSA, remains at risk of an impending health crisis. If NPIs remain enforced, up to

37

50,000 lives may be saved. Even with NPIs, without vaccines and new therapies, COVID-19 could

38

infect up to 30% of the population, making it the largest public health threat in Madagascar until

39

early 2021, hence the importance of conducting clinical trials and continually improving access to

40

healthcare.

The lower-than-expected number of reported cases of COVID-19 in Madagascar can be

Introduction

83

The COVID-19 pandemic has killed hundreds of thousands of people, collapsing health systems

84

and economies around the world. Most models predict that without intervention, the majority of

85

the global population will become infected and tens of millions will die as a result of the pandemic

86

[1]. There have been particular concerns for sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) [2–4], as the major factors

87

that drive high burdens of other infectious diseases, such as the environmental and socio-

88

economic conditions, lack of water and sanitation infrastructure, and weak health systems, are

89

equally relevant to the threat of COVID-19. However, so far, the perceived burden of COVID-19

90

in SSA is low compared to expectations both from epidemiological models and from epidemic

91

patterns in other regions of the world [5,6]. Though SSA comprises 11% of the global population,

92

it has only 3.6% of the total global COVID-19 incidence, much of which is due to case reports

93

from South Africa [7]. As of July 2020, most SSA countries are reporting fewer than 100 new

94

cases daily [8]. There are three leading potential explanations for the lower observed burden of

95

COVID-19 in SSA: 1) low case detection, 2) region-specific epidemiology (e.g., different R0), and

96

3) early implementation of effective policy interventions. The important difference among these

97

alternative explanations is that explanations based on low case detection and effective

98

interventions imply that there will be a major resurgence if interventions are relaxed, while

99

explanations based on region-specific epidemiology allow for a safe reopening.

100

The lower-than-expected number of reported cases may be due to low detection and

101

reporting rates. RT-PCR laboratory capacity in SSA is limited [9] and many countries have among

102

the lowest testing rates in the world [8]. Moreover, health care access for fever and respiratory

103

infections is low [10], which means that many symptomatic cases will not be detected, and the

104

stigma associated with COVID-19 could further reduce health-seeking behaviors [11].

105

The epidemiology-based explanations for low COVID-19 cases are based on

106

considerations of well-established factors: warmer climates, younger age distributions, and lower

107

contact rates due to lower population density and transportation infrastructure in rural areas

108

[12,13]. In addition, there is considerable interest in the potential immune-mediated

109

consequences from living in a system with greater exposure to other infectious diseases and

110

related prophylaxis and therapeutics [14]. For example, there are major trials underway on the

111

effects of trained immunity due to the BCG vaccine, which may increase innate immunity against

112

a range of respiratory infections [15]. However, many of these hypotheses have recently come

113

into doubt. The pandemic phase of COVID-19 is driven by high susceptibility, not climate [16],

114

suggesting that warmer, humid climates will not decrease transmission at this time. Further, past

115

outbreaks of influenza, including the 1968 pandemic and 2009 H1N1 outbreak, spread throughout

116

the African continent and were not limited by sparse transportation networks [17]. Explanations

117

based in region-specific epidemiology are therefore only weakly supported.

118

The policy response in Africa has also been a source of considerable optimism [5,18].

119

African governments implemented early and strong non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI)

120

policies that may have effectively contained disease transmission [5,19]. The first case of COVID-

121

19 was reported in SSA one month later than the first cases in Europe, allowing countries to

122

prepare and implement NPIs, particularly lockdowns, social distancing, masks, and regulated

123

domestic travel, during the early stages of the pandemic [3,19,20]. Beginning in June, several

124

SSA countries began relaxing lockdown NPIs in response to the economic and social costs of

125

lockdown given the low reported case numbers. As partial lockdowns have been lifted, some

126

countries’ case rates have remained stable, while others have begun to increase, leading to the

127

WHO to urge caution and emphasize the need for a gradual and conservative release of

128

confinement measures in SSA [21].

129

It remains unknown whether SSA-specific conditions will result in different epidemic

130

dynamics in SSA than elsewhere, and whether the current lower-than-expected case burdens

131

can be explained solely by detection rates and policies. To explore these issues, we compare

132

COVID-19 reported case data with predictions from a simple SEIR compartmental model for

133

Madagascar that integrates age-structured social contact matrices and fatality rates, assuming

134

an R0 of 2.5 [22–24] (Appendix I). We then consider what levels of detection or NPI effectiveness

135

could explain the current state of the epidemic, and whether those levels are plausible given

136

Madagascar’s policies, demographics, and environmental context. Finally, based on these

137

explanations, we investigate possible transmission scenarios for the first year of the epidemic, to

138

examine the future of COVID-19 dynamics and control in Madagascar, which could be applicable

139

to other SSA countries.

140

Madagascar’s demographic, economic, and health system profile is comparable to many

141

other SSA countries [23,25,26]. It shares most of the major infectious diseases of mainland Africa

142

(e.g. tuberculosis, malaria, respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases), and has recently endured

143

among the worst epidemics of plague and measles in decades [27,28]. Like other SSA countries,

144

Madagascar reported its first imported case relatively late, on March 20, 2020, and the

145

government implemented NPIs early in the epidemic (Table 1). Madagascar instituted a national

146

lockdown on March 23, 2020, three days before its first case attributed to local transmission.

147

Testing practices are also similar to those in other SSA countries, initially focusing on screening

148

for imported cases and eventually expanding to test contacts of known cases for local

149

transmission.

150

Our exercise shows that the current incidence of COVID-19 in Madagascar can be

151

explained by the early and effective implementation of NPIs and low case detection rates, both of

152

which are supported by strong anecdotal evidence. In contrast, arguments of regional-specific

153

epidemiology are based on correlational observations that have yet to be proven. This suggests

154

that the epidemic will grow in Madagascar, and similar countries in SSA, and that these

155

populations remain at risk of an impending health crisis. Our model indicates that, if NPIs remain

156

enforced at the level needed to explain current case burdens, nearly 50,000 lives could be saved.

157

Even with NPIs, 30% of the Malagasy population would become infected by March 2021, making

158

COVID-19 the leading killer in Madagascar over this epidemic period, hence the importance of

159

conducting clinical trials and continually improving access to healthcare.

160
161

Case Detection

162

By July 2020, the simple forecast for an unmitigated epidemic predicts a daily incidence of 34,322

163

cases, which is nearly 500 times the reported daily incidence (Fig. 1A). Simply accounting for

164

detection rates between 0.1 - 1% results in predictions that closely approximate the reported daily

165

incidence of COVID-19 cases in Madagascar (Fig. 1B). Are these low levels of case detection

166

reasonable? For countries where per capita testing is over 100-fold higher than in Madagascar

167

(currently 79.1/100,000 population), it is estimated that less than 10% of COVID-19 cases have

168

been detected [29]. Though the precise case detection rates for Madagascar cannot be discerned

169

from available data, there are a number of indicators suggesting that these are lower than the

170

already low rates of Europe or the US.

171

First, case definitions in Madagascar may be stricter than elsewhere. In June 2020, about

172

12% of suspected cases tested were confirmed by RT-PCR in Madagascar compared to a

173

positivity rate of less than 5% in Europe and the US over the same period [30,31]. This suggests

174

strict criteria for test eligibility (e.g. requiring symptoms and known positive contacts) is being used

175

in Madagascar and many cases could potentially be missed. Further, strict diagnostic criteria may

176

be a result of the original testing policy of Madagascar early in the epidemic, which required that

177

suspected cases first test positive with antibody-based rapid detection tests (RDTs) before being

178

confirmed through RT-PCR tests. The low probability of detection of antibodies early in the

179

infectious period (i.e., the first week of symptoms) and the high rate of false-negatives with RT-

180

PCR later in the infectious period (i.e., after 7-10 days post symptom onset) [32] create a short

181

window for detection.

182

Second, the Madagascar health system itself is only receiving a portion of symptomatic

183

COVID-19 cases. The proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases is estimated to be between

6

184

40 - 45% [33]. In Madagascar, surveys indicate that 40.2% of people with respiratory infection

185

symptoms seek healthcare [34], implying that over 50% of symptomatic COVID-19 infections may

186

not even enter a public health facility. For COVID-like symptoms, this rate could be much lower

187

given the stigma associated with the disease [11]. The combination of the high proportion of

188

asymptomatic cases and low health-seeking behaviors suggest that, even if health centers test

189

50% of symptomatic COVID-19 cases attending a health facility, this would detect less than 25%

190

of symptomatic cases.

191

Finally, there is limited diagnostic testing capacity in Madagascar, with RT-PCR testing

192

available in 5 laboratories across 3 major cities. It is unlikely that health facilities in rural areas of

193

the country, where nearly 50% of the population lives, are testing such a high percentage of cases.

194

We can account for all of these factors to estimate an upper bound of detection rates for

195

Madagascar (strict case definitions (0.3) x low proportion symptomatic (0.45) x low healthcare-

196

seeking behaviors (0.2) x limited testing infrastructure (0.25)) to reasonably explain a detection

197

rate in Madagascar of 1% or lower.

198
199

Reduced Transmission

200

A reduction in transmission rates of 30%, relative to an unmitigated scenario, can also explain the

201

daily case report rates of COVID-19 in Madagascar (Fig. 1C). This reduction could be the result

202

of NPI policies put in place in Madagascar or of innate characteristics affecting the epidemiology

203

of COVID-19 (e.g. baseline contact patterns, climate, etc.). NPIs were implemented within three

204

days after the first confirmed imported case of COVID-19 in the country (Table 1), the majority of

205

which focused on restricting intercity travel on roadways and included lockdowns in population

206

centers. In contrast, the UK instituted a partial-lockdown on March 23, 2020, 52 days after the

207

first confirmed case in the UK on January 31, 2020. The road system of Madagascar is highly

208

fragmented, with most travel on a limited number of paved national roads that run North-South

209

through the capital. Restricting travel on these roads has the potential to be highly effective in

210

reducing human mobility in Madagascar, and therefore the spread of COVID-19. Further, most

211

travel involves major population centers, particularly the capital city, Antananarivo [35]. These

212

cities had much more stringent NPIs put in place early in the epidemic, including city-wide

213

lockdowns and curfews (Table 1), and the targeted lockdown of these population centers could

214

have reduced spread to the rest of the country. While mobility data is not available for

215

Madagascar, other SSA countries have reported reductions in mobility ranging from 1.4% in

216

Zambia to 19% in Senegal compared to pre-NPI levels [36]. With a sparse road network that is

217

well regulated in Madagascar, 30% represents an obtainable reduction in contact rates.

218

Because NPIs were implemented early in the epidemic, their effects on transmission

219

cannot be disentangled from baseline contact patterns in the country, which may be lower than

220

those of Europe or the US. Nearly half (47.73%) of the Malagasy population lives in rural areas,

221

and most of the country is over 3 hours from a population center with more than 50,000 people

222

[37]. Therefore, baseline contact patterns in the rural areas of Madagascar may be reducing

223

disease spread in a way that is unidentifiable from the effects of NPIs.

224
225

Which path is Madagascar on?

226

The evidence presented here provides no indication that the epidemiology (e.g. R0) of COVID-19

227

is fundamentally different in a fairly typical SSA country than elsewhere. We demonstrate that the

228

current trend in reported cases in Madagascar can be explained by its early stage in the epidemic,

229

combined with low detection rates and lower contact rates from NPIs (Fig. 2A). Understanding

230

how much of the discrepancy between predicted and reported case burdens is due to low

231

detection rates or NPIs has enormous implications for our expectations regarding the ‘true’ burden

232

of COVID-19 in Madagascar. For this, we explored different combinations of detection rates and

233

NPI efficacy that explain the observed trend in reported cases, together with associated

234

predictions of epidemic morbidity and mortality burdens (Figure 2). If the low number of reported

235

cases is due primarily to a low detection rate, we predict over 13 million people will be infected

236

with the virus if NPIs are not in place (Fig. 2C,D), imposing a huge burden on an already

237

weakened health system. On the other hand, if the low number of cases is due to a reduction in

238

contact patterns, the model predicts a lower total burden of approximately 8 million people

239

infected with the virus (Fig. 2C,D). If NPIs are driving these contact patterns and are responsible

240

for the lower-than-expected case burden, many cases and deaths are being averted, but the lifting

241

of these restrictions is very likely to lead to an uncontrolled outbreak.

242

Although the global epidemic began several months ago, current infectious disease

243

models for Madagascar and other SSA countries rely on limited data, resulting in disparate

244

predictions. Pearson et al. (2020) predicted a similar epidemic size for Madagascar as our model

245

in an unmitigated scenario, with 75% of the population and nearly 100,000 deaths. In contrast, an

246

analysis led by the WHO [12] predicted a total case burden nearly one third of this size (26% of

247

the population) and only a fraction of COVID-19 related deaths (1,500). This study assumed that

248

the regional particularities of SSA will decrease disease transmission and fatality rates based on

249

country-specific proxies for these factors, such as climate, transportation networks, and contact

250

matrices. Importantly, this study only considered reductions in transmission via reduced risks of

251

exposure, with a maximum of 2.6% of the population of Madagascar at risk of exposure at any

252

one time. While socio-ecological context is necessary to understand disease transmission, our

253

exercise suggests that the difference between reported and predicted case burdens in SSA can

254

be just as easily explained by accounting for low detection rates and NPIs that reduce

255

interpersonal contact.

256
257

Conclusion

258

We do not currently have enough evidence to suggest that the epidemiology of COVID-

259

19 is different in Madagascar than elsewhere. The low number of reported cases can be explained

260

by low detection rates, late introduction, and early and effective implementation of NPIs. In

261

contrast to the theory of a salutary epidemiology, each of these explanations is supported by

262

strong anecdotal evidence (Table 2). As lockdowns are gradually lifted, other NPIs, such as

263

handwashing and social distancing, should be implemented to avoid a rapid growth in cases. The

264

public health system should remain prepared for an outbreak, with a peak of infections expected

265

between August and December depending on the transmission scenario (Fig. 2D). The COVID-

266

19 epidemic could become the leading public health problem in Madagascar in 2020, causing

267

nearly twice as many deaths as are attributed to diarrheal disease [38]. It is important, therefore,

268

to conduct clinical trials and continually improve access to health care. If NPIs remain in place at

269

levels seen during the first months of the epidemic, the model suggests that this could prevent

270

over 50,000 COVID-19 related deaths in Madagascar.

Figure 2. Multiple combination of factors explain the low number of reported COVID-19

294

cases in Madagascar, with important implications for predictions of epidemic dynamics.

295

Predicted A) daily reported cases (7 day average) as of June 22 2020, B) total infection burden

296

after one year, and c) total fatality burden after one year in Madagascar at different combinations

297

of NPI effectiveness and detection rates. The contour line corresponds to a parameter space

298

where the median number of predicted cases from 25 simulations equals the daily reported cases

299

(7 day average) on June 22 (71.71 cases). Shaded diamonds correspond to specific scenarios

Table 2. Summary of evidence supporting or opposing three possible explanations for the low

314

number of reported cases of COVID-19 in Madagascar.
Supporting
Low
rates

detection -

Epidemiological differences

-

Early
and effective NPIs
-

Opposing

- High proportion of asymptomatic
cases[33]
- Strict testing criteria
- Low healthcare seeking rates for
acute respiratory infections[34]
- Diagnostic practices that limit the
window of detection

-

- Recent evaluation of health
system preparedness via the
International Health Regulations
meant health systems were on high
alert for an outbreak [20]

- Trained-immunity due to
vaccinations or high prevalence of
endemic disease could increase
population’s resistance to infection
[14]
- Transmission rate may be lower in
sparsely populated areas [13]
- Virus survival is lower in humid,
warm environments

-

- Limited role for climate during
pandemic phase of the outbreak
[16]
- Past influenza outbreaks were not
limited by sparse transport networks
in SSA [17]

-

- Lockdown in population centers
implemented three days after first
imported case
- Limiting travel on fragmented paved
road network can easily disrupt withincountry movement
