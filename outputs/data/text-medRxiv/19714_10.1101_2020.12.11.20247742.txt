Abstract (367 words)
Objective
To quantify the impact and recovery in cardiovascular disease monitoring in primary care associated
with the first COVID-19 lockdown.
Design
Retrospective nationwide primary care cohort study, utilising data from 1st January 2018 to 27th
September 2020.
Setting
We extracted primary care electronic health records data from 514 primary care practices in England
contributing to the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners Clinical Informatics Digital Hub
(ORCHID). These practices were representative of English primary care across urban and non-urban
practices.
Participants
The ORCHID database included 6,157,327 active patients during the study period, and 13,938,390
patient years of observation (final date of follow-up 27th September 2020). The mean (SD) age was
38±24 years, 49.4% were male and the majority were of white ethnicity (65% [21.9% had unknown
ethnicity])
Exposure
The primary exposure was the first national lockdown in the UK, starting on 23rd March 2020.
Main outcome measures
Records of cholesterol, blood pressure, HbA1c and International Normalised Ratio (INR)
measurement derived from coded entries in the primary care electronic health record.
Results
Rates of cholesterol, blood pressure, HbA1c and INR recording dropped by 23-87% in the week
following the first UK national lockdown, compared with the previous week. The largest decline was
seen in cholesterol (IRR 0.13, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.15) and smallest for INR (IRR 0.77, 95% CI 0.72 to
0.81).
Following the immediate drop, rates of recorded tests increased on average by 5-9% per week until
27th September 2020. However, the number of recorded measures remained below that expected
for the time of year, reaching 51.8% (95% CI 51.8 to 51.9%) for blood pressure, 63.7%, (95% CI 63.7%
to 63.8%) for cholesterol measurement and 70.3% (95% CI 70.2% to 70.4%) for HbA1c. Rates of INR
recording declined throughout the previous two years, a trend that continued after lockdown. There
were no differences in the times series trends based on sex, age, ethnicity or deprivation.
Conclusions
Cardiovascular disease monitoring in English primary care declined substantially from the time of the
first UK lockdown. Despite a consistent recovery in activity, there is still a substantial shortfall in the
numbers of recorded measurements to those expected. Strategies are required to ensure
cardiovascular disease monitoring is maintained during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction
The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and associated restrictions on daily life are
thought to have dramatically affected access to healthcare across the world. In the UK, from early
March 2020, any patients with COVID-like symptoms were advised to call NHS 111 for advice, rather
than to seek care in-person. In addition, telephone and video triage was recommended across
primary care in order to reduce the number of face-to-face consultations.1 A million and a half
people in England who were considered extremely vulnerable to COVID-19 were advised to ‘shield’
at home for at least 12 weeks.2 Following the COVID-19 lockdown on 23rd March 2020, there was an
almost ubiquitous shift to remote consultations, as healthcare settings developed “COVID secure”
ways of working.3-5 Many routine appointments, procedures and non-urgent care, in both primary
and secondary care, were cancelled to divert resources to emergency care for people with suspected
or confirmed COVID-19.6,7 Early data showed that endoscopy procedures reduced by 95%,8 cancer
referrals dropped by 70%,9 hospital admissions with stroke and acute myocardial infarction
decreased by 50%,10,11 attendances at accident and emergency dropped by 35%12 and routine safety
monitoring tests for psychiatric medications became difficult to obtain.13 In primary care, data are
limited but one study of 47 practices in a single health region in England reported a halving in the
number of diagnoses of type 2 diabetes, and anxiety and depression, in primary care and a 43% drop
in the diagnosis of circulatory conditions.14 It is uncertain whether this was reflected across the
country, or specific to northern England where COVID-19 infection rates are thought to have been
higher.15

Early data from hospital admissions for acute coronary syndrome in England showed that following
an initial 40% reduction at the start of the UK lockdown, a recovery in admission rates was observed
to the end of May 2020, but remained 16% lower than expected.6 It is currently unclear as to
whether routine primary and secondary care activity has recovered to pre-pandemic levels as
lockdown restrictions were eased. A sustained drop in activity in primary care is clinically important.
The majority of people with a new diagnosis of serious disease first attend primary care16 and are
then referred. Most major disease prevention is conducted in primary care, for example risk factor
assessment to focus management on those at highest risk, and the monitoring of chronic disease to
reduce subsequent morbidity and excess mortality. In particular, cardiovascular disease prevention
programmes are reliant on the routine measurement of risk factors such as cholesterol, blood
pressure and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) for both diagnosis, treatment initiation and risk factor
control.
Understanding how primary care activity was affected by the first UK lockdown may help avert this
reduced primary care activity in the first wave of COVID-19 translating into excess mortality in the
future. Crucially, data are required that describe whether primary care provision for non-COVID
conditions such as cardiovascular disease recovered following the first lockdown. This mayenable
the development of strategies to mitigate persistent shortfalls in key clinical areas. Furthermore,
quantifying this key role of general practice, namely the delivery of disease prevention, during the
COVID-19 pandemic is also important given the highly critical concerns expressed by some
commentators that general practice has failed the public during COVID. 17 The present study
analysed the rates of routine cardiovascular disease monitoring in primary care across the past three
years to quantify the impact and recovery in clinical care associated with the first COVID-19
lockdown.

Methods
Design
We conducted a retrospective nationwide cohort study, utilising electronic health records from
primary care practices in England contributing to the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners
Clinical Informatics Digital Hub (ORCHID).18 The participating practices were representative of English
primary care across urban and non-urban practices.19 Two experienced PPI participants commented
on the protocol and the research aims. The protocol for this study was accepted by an independent
approval committee and received ethical approval from the University of Oxford, Medical Sciences
Interdivisional Research Ethics Committee (ref: R69874/RE001).
Study population, exposure, and outcomes
This study included all registered patients of any age within ORCHID. Data were extracted for all
consultations occurring between 1st January 2018 and 27th September 2020. Person years of
observation were calculated and used as the denominator for all analyses.
The primary exposure of interest was the date of national lockdown in the UK, 23rd March 2020
(figure 1).
The cardiovascular disease monitoring outcomes included records of cholesterol, blood pressure
(BP), HbA1c, and International Normalised Ratio (INR) measurement. All outcomes were based on
codes entered into the primary care electronic health record and were curated in SNOMED
CT.(complete variable lists are included in appendix 1).
Covariates
Covariates were age group (<15, 15-24, 25-44, 45-64, 65-74, 75-84 and 85+), sex, ethnicity, and
Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD quintile). Those with missing ethnicity were classed as
unknown, and the small number with missing IMD data were excluded (174,004; 2.8%) from
stratified analyses involving IMD.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to define the characteristics of the study population. Weekly rates of
cardiovascular disease monitoring were calculated and plotted over time from 1st January 2018
through to 27th September 2020, overall and stratified by covariate groups.
Negative binomial regression models, including a term for the week of follow-up and an indicator
term for before/after lockdown were fitted to examine the rates of testing during the study period.
Incident rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were derived from these models to
compare clinical activity rates in the week after lockdown, compared with the week prior to
lockdown.
Estimates of the rate of change in clinical activity each week after the start of lockdown were also
obtained from the models. For each outcome, five models were fitted in total: one model for the
overall rates as described and one model for rates stratified by each of the four covariates (age, sex,
ethnicity and IMD).
To estimate whether the effect of lockdown and subsequent recovery varied by covariate groups,
the latter models included additional terms for the covariate, interactions between the covariate
and week of follow-up and the covariate and lockdown indicator (equivalent to a stratified analysis).

Expected number of tests in each week were predicted based on observed rates in 2018 and 19,
standardised to the 2020 denominator. Expected and actual number of tests in 2020 were summed
from January to 27th September and the cumulative sum displayed graphically. The recovery in
cumulative activity was expressed as the proportion of actual tests recorded in 2020 compared to
the average expected number over the same time period in 2018 and 2019. Analyses were
conducted using R (version 3.5.3).

Results
The ORCHID database included 6,157,327 active patients during the study period, from 514 general
practices. Included patients had a mean age of 38±sd 24 years, 49.4% were male and the majority
were of white ethnicity (65% [21.9% had unknown ethnicity]) (table 1). In total, there were
13,938,390 patient years of observation, and the vast majority of patients were included for the
entire study period (median period of observation of 2.74 years, IQR 1.94 to 2.74 years).
Figure 2 shows the rate of cholesterol, blood pressure, HbA1c and INR recording across the study
period. The incidence dropped significantly by 23-87% in the week that the UK went into national
lockdown, compared to the week before (table 2). The change in the incidence rate (in the week
before and after lockdown) was largest for cholesterol (IRR 0.13, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.15) and smallest
for INR (IRR 0.77, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.81). There were no differences in the rates based on sex, age,
ethnicity or socioeconomic deprivation (table 2).
Following the immediate decline after lockdown began, rates of monitoring for cholesterol, blood
pressure and HbA1c increased, on average, by 5-9% per week until 27th September (table 3), but did
not recover to pre-lockdown levels. Compared with the same week in 2019, recording rates during
the last week of September 2020 were lowest for blood pressure at 48.4% (95% CI 47.9% to 49.1%),
76.2% (95% 74.8% to 77.6%) for cholesterol, and 80.7% (95% CI 79.3% to 82.0%) for HbA1c of the
previous year’s rates. There was no such increase for INR following the initial drop observed
immediately after lockdown (IRR 0.999, 95% CI 0.996 to 1.003; table 3). There were no differences in
rates following lockdown across patient characteristics (table 3).
Overall, recording of cardiovascular disease risk factors was significantly reduced compared with
previous years (figure 3). By the 27th September 2020, there were 355,139 fewer records for
cholesterol, (63.7% of expected, 95% CI 63.7% to 63.8%); 1,442,792 fewer BP records (51.8% of
expected, 95% CI 51.8% to 51.9%); 337,659 fewer HbA1c records (70.3% of expected, 95% CI 70.2%
to 70.4%); and 355,138 fewer INR records (63.7% of expected, 95% CI 63.7% to 63.8%).

Discussion
Summary of main findings
In a nationally representative cohort of 6,157,327 registered patients, cholesterol, blood pressure,
HbA1c and INR recording, all measures that require in person consulting, were found to be reduced
by up to 87% following the UK government’s decision to enter into a national lockdown at the end of
March 2020. Rates of cholesterol, blood pressure and HbA1c recording subsequently increased by 59% per week, although not to pre-lockdown levels, reaching between 52% and 70% of the expected
number based on the previous years. Overall, there were between 355,138 and 1,442,792 fewer
tests (depending on the measure) conducted by the end of September 2020 compared with the

previous years. No such recovery was observed for INR testing, possibly due to many patients being
switched from warfarin (which requires INR monitoring) to direct oral anticoagulants (which do not),
which had been occurring prior to the pandemic20, but which was accelerated to avoid unnecessary
patient contact with primary care during the pandemic.21,22
Strengths and limitations
This is the first analysis of nationally representative data from primary care in England showing both
the immediate drop in cardiovascular disease monitoring and subsequent recovery during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Data were derived from the ORCHID database which is capable of weekly data
downloads, permitting some of the most timely and up-to-date analyses of primary care data in the
world. Analyses are limited to those coded in patients’ electronic health records. It is possible that
changes in clinical practice, such as the switch to remote consultations 1,3,4 or reduced administrative
support for general practitioners may have affected coding of risk factor measurement. In addition,
some patients may have continued to monitor their cardiovascular risk factors remotely through
self-monitoring, 23-25 but this may not have been captured in the electronic health record.
We focussed on cardiovascular disease since this is responsible for most premature deaths and
major morbidity In the UK, but there are major disease prevention strategies possible with the focus
on the early detection of risk factors and the close management of these risk factors monitored by
follow up testing. General practice is largely responsible for this major public health delivery.
This was an observational study and analyses were not designed to infer causality between the
initiation of a national lockdown and subsequent cardiovascular disease monitoring. In addition, due
to the contemporary nature of the data, it was not possible to examine the association between
changes in clinical activity and subsequent clinical outcomes such as cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality. This will become possible in time but, at present, these analyses highlight the scale of
reduced cardiovascular disease monitoring in UK primary care.

Comparison with existing literature
To date, the majority of existing studies examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nonCOVID-19 related clinical care have focussed on secondary care activity. These studies have shown
decreases in hospital attendances and admissions ranging between 35% for accident and emergency
attendance12 and 95% for endoscopy procedures8. Admissions for acute myocardial infarctions
dropped by 42%11 and cardiac procedures were reduced by around 50%7. There is some evidence of
recovery in secondary care with admissions for acute coronary syndrome, including myocardial
infarction, returning to 16% below the previous year average by the end of May.6 Similar data have
been reported in cardiovascular services in Denmark 26 and the United States of America27.
Secondary care activity has been reported to have decrease globally for urology,28 paediatric
rheumatology,29 and gynaecological oncology.30
In primary care, one small study of 47 urban general practices contributing data to the Salford
Integrated Record database found the number of diagnoses of anxiety and depression, type 2
diabetes and circulatory conditions fell by 43%-50% in the period between March and May 2020.14
The present analysis examined data from 6,157,327 patients from 514 general practices across
England and focussed on cardiovascular disease. We found larger reductions in clinical activity of up
to 83% for cholesterol, blood pressure and HbA1c recording, most likely due to these tests requiring
face-to-face appointment in order to record them.

We also observed an almost immediate subsequent increase in cardiovascular disease related
activity which continued to increase by 5-9% per week throughout the rest of the study period. This
is the first study to quantify the recovery of primary care activity since the start of UK lockdown in
any clinical area. Although this recovery was rapid, rates of clinical activity did not return to prelockdown levels leaving a substantial and persistent deficit of ‘missed’ records, compared to
previous years.
Whilst the reduction in testing and failure to fully recover to pre-lockdown levels may reflect
improved efficiency of service provision, with only the sickest patients being tested, such a large
drop in overall activity could have a material impact on cardiovascular morbidity and excess
mortality and should therefore be mitigated when possible.
The reduction in recorded cardiovascular disease monitoring is almost certainly the result of a
combination of altered patient behaviour, changes in access to primary care, modifications in clinical
practice, as well as an excess in deaths.31 Fear of contracting COVID-19 from healthcare settings and
shielding advice for older and comorbid people to remain at home has influenced help-seeking.
Understanding how to balance and communicate the risks of reduced cardiovascular disease
monitoring with the risks of COVID-19 exposure in community healthcare settings will be vital to
adequately reinstate care to those most vulnerable.
Remote consultation may have resulted in fewer opportunistic blood pressure measurements when
patients attend for a non-blood pressure related problem. Further analyses are required to
determine whether reductions in activity are associated with reductions in tests used for diagnosis
compared to those used for monitoring.
Recorded testing for cholesterol and HbA1c were conducted much less frequently pre-lockdown
than blood pressure (~30 tests per 100 patient years vs. ~85 blood pressure measurements per 100
person years), therefore a smaller reduction in cumulative post-lockdown testing would be expected
in less frequent measurements, given the relatively short duration since lockdown. By contrast, INR
testing was already in decline from 2018-2019 and this was amplified at the start of lockdown,
presumably due to an acceleration of switching patients from warfarin to direct oral anticoagulants
that do not require regular blood test monitoring.20,21
Reduced recording may represent decreased monitoring and it has been shown that blood pressure
control is obtained more quickly with frequent monitoring,32,33 so a lack of measurement may
increase adverse events. However, many patients may be using home blood pressure monitors to
safely manage their blood pressure and therefore safeguarding against harm. Based on previous
modelling of vascular health checks programmes, routine measurement of cholesterol, blood
pressure and HbA1c has the potential to reduce up to 1,300 major cardiovascular events per 100,000
people screened.34 Whether these events occur in the absence of cardiovascular disease monitoring
depends on actions taken by general practitioners and policy makers now.
In response to the altered pressures in primary care, NHS England and NHS Improvement in
agreement with the BMA’s General Practitioners Committee have simplified and reduced the Quality
and Outcomes Framework requirements for 2020/21.35 It is possible that this could have a negative
effect on the quality of recording in the electronic health records, and possibly on clinical care. 36
Given the importance of monitoring cardiovascular disease, and the substantial number of missing
records this year, it is possible that the reduction in primary care activity for at least three of the four
of the outcomes studied may result in increased cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality if
the usual control of these parameters has deteriorated. There is therefore an important need to

develop approaches to identify whether cholesterol, blood pressure, and HbA1c control has been
compromised as the pandemic continues. Early strategies, incorporating what we know about
remote self-monitoring of risk factors,23-25 are required to address the shortfall in monitoring
identified by this research. Although there were no apparent differences between testing rates for
specific patient groups, further analyses are needed to determine whether certain tests, situations
(e.g. diagnosis vs monitoring) or patient groups should be prioritised for these strategies.

Conclusions
This analysis of a large nationally representative dataset from UK primary care shows both the
immediate drop in cardiovascular disease monitoring and the subsequent recovery. Whilst there has
been partial recovery of cardiovascular preventive activity in English general practice since
lockdown, with consistent growth evident since the initial lockdown, reaching 51-68% of expected
cumulative records. Importantly, there were no differences observed for the sudden reduction or
subsequent recovery of preventive activity by patient characteristics, such as sex or ethnicity.
However, there remains a substantial number of missing records. Given the importance of
cardiovascular disease management in the prevention of premature death, it is possible that this
shortfall in clinical activity will translate into increased cardiovascular disease morbidity and
mortality. There is now an imperative to help primary care practices develop strategies to mitigate
the decline in cardiovascular disease monitoring during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.
