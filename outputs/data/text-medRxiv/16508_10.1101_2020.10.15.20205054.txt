Abstract
Background
The medium-term effects of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on multiple organ health, exercise
capacity, cognition, quality of life and mental health are poorly understood.
Methods
Fifty-eight COVID-19 patients post-hospital discharge and 30 comorbidity-matched controls were
prospectively enrolled for multiorgan (brain, lungs, heart, liver and kidneys) magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), spirometry, six-minute walk test, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), quality
of life, cognitive and mental health assessments.
Findings
At 2-3 months from disease-onset, 64% of patients experienced persistent breathlessness and 55%
complained of significant fatigue. On MRI, tissue signal abnormalities were seen in the lungs
(60%), heart (26%), liver (10%) and kidneys (29%) of patients. COVID-19 patients also exhibited
tissue changes in the thalamus, posterior thalamic radiations and sagittal stratum on brain MRI and
demonstrated impaired cognitive performance, specifically in the executive and visuospatial
domain relative to controls. Exercise tolerance (maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory
efficiency on CPET) and six-minute walk distance (405±118m vs 517±106m in controls,
p<0.0001) were significantly reduced in patients. The extent of extra-pulmonary MRI
abnormalities and exercise tolerance correlated with serum markers of ongoing inflammation and
severity of acute illness. Patients were more likely to report symptoms of moderate to severe
anxiety (35% versus 10%, p=0.012) and depression (39% versus 17%, p=0.036) and a significant
impairment in all domains of quality of life compared to controls.
Interpretation
A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients discharged from hospital experience ongoing
symptoms of breathlessness, fatigue, anxiety, depression and exercise limitation at 2-3 months
from disease-onset. Persistent lung and extra-pulmonary organ MRI findings are common. In
COVID-19 survivors, chronic inflammation may underlie multiorgan abnormalities and contribute
to impaired quality of life.

Background
The global impact of Coronavirus disease or COVID-19 has been profound with hundreds of
thousands of lives lost and millions affected.1 Despite the high mortality seen among hospitalised
patients, many have survived, with little known about the medium-to-long term effects of COVID19 after discharge. Although predominantly a respiratory illness, emerging data suggests that
multiorgan injury is common, particularly in those with moderate to severe infections.2-4

Studies have shown that the brain, heart, gastrointestinal system and the kidneys are particularly
vulnerable to injury during the initial phase of illness.2-4 The invasive potential and affinity of
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) for multiple cell lines, suggests
that virus-mediated toxicity may play a central role in promoting multi-system damage.5 An
exaggerated and dysregulated immune response, endothelial damage, thromboinflammation and
coagulopathy have also been implicated in causing injury to these organs.6

While it is clear that the extent of infection, inflammatory response and physiological reserve
(influenced by obesity, age and comorbidities) are important determinants of clinical outcomes
during the initial phase, reports of a chronic maladaptive inflammatory syndrome are also
emerging. In particular, inflammatory changes in the lungs have been described in convalescing
COVID-19 patients, months after discharge from hospital.7 Whether extra-pulmonary organs are
also susceptible to ongoing inflammation and injury is poorly understood as are its effects on
exercise tolerance, cognition, mental health and quality of life.

In a holistic study of survivors of moderate to severe COVID-19 infection, discharged from
hospital, at 2-3 months from disease onset, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of persistent
multiorgan injury/inflammation and assess the effects of COVID-19 on physical, psychological,
and cognitive health and well-being.

Patients and methods
Study population
Fifty-eight patients with moderate to severe laboratory-confirmed (SARS-CoV-2 polymerase
chain reaction positive) COVID-19, admitted for treatment at the Oxford University Hospitals
National Health Service Foundation Trust between 14th March – 25th May 2020, and 30 uninfected
controls (SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin negative and asymptomatic) group-matched for age, sex,
body mass index (BMI) and risk factors (smoking, diabetes and hypertension) from the community
(during the same period) were prospectively enrolled in this study (appendix, Figure 1, p28). For
further details on inclusion and exclusion criteria, refer to appendix, p2. COVID-19 severity on
admission was defined as per the World Health Organisation (WHO) interim clinical guidance
(appendix for definition, p2). Patients with severe/end-stage multi-system comorbidities and
contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging were excluded.

This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04510025) and approved in the United
Kingdom by the North West Preston Research Ethics Committee (reference 20/NW/0235).

Study Procedures
All subjects consented to have comprehensive multiorgan magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of
the brain, lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, six-minute walk (6MWT) test, spirometry, cardiopulmonary
exercise test (CPET), series of questionnaires, and blood tests.
Multiorgan MRI protocol
A 70 minute multiorgan MRI scan was carried out at 3 Tesla (Prisma, Siemens Healthineers,
Erlangen, Germany). Brain MRI included T1 weighted imaging, T2-Fluid attenuated inversion
recovery (FLAIR) to assess (e.g.) inflammation, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to assess
ischaemic injury, susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) to assess (e.g.) haemorrhage, and
quantitative multi-inversion-delay arterial spin labelling (ASL) to assess cerebral blood flow. Lung
imaging included a T2-weighted half‐Fourier‐acquisition single‐shot turbo spin‐echo (HASTE) to
qualitatively assess the extent of lung parenchymal involvement. Cardiac assessment included cine
imaging, T1 and T2 mapping, post-contrast T1 mapping and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE)
imaging to assess biventricular volumes, function, myocardial oedema, diffuse and focal/patchy
fibrosis. Liver imaging consisted of a single slice T1 map and multiecho gradient echo IDEAL, to
quantify fibro-inflammation (T1), fat (proton density fat fraction, PDFF) and iron (T2*).
Multiparametric renal imaging was also undertaken and consisted of a single coronal oblique slice
T1 map to quantify fibroinflammat ion and an R2* map for renal oxygenation assessment (details
in appendix, p2-5).8
MRI Image analysis
All images were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively (by expert radiologist, neuroradiologist,
cardiac MRI specialists, neuroimage analysts and physicists) in a blinded fashion. Lung MRIs

were qualitatively assessed for parenchymal involvement by an expert radiologist. Extent of lung
parenchymal abnormalities was scored as 0 (0%), 1 (1–25%), 2 (26–50%), 3 (51–75%), or 4 (76–
100%), respectively. Brain image processing was carried out using an adapted version of the
processing pipeline created for the United Kingdom (UK) Biobank brain imaging analysis
(https://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ukbiobank/), based around tools from the Oxford Centre for
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB) software library [FSL
(https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl)] (appendix, p3,4). Assessment of cardiac volumes, function,
myocardial T1 maps, T2 maps, post-contrast T1 maps and late gadolinium enhanced images was
undertaken using cvi42 software (Circle Cardiovascular Imaging Inc., Version 5.10.1, Calgary,
Canada) (appendix, p4). Quantitative analyses of T1 and T2* for liver, spleen and renal images
were carried out as described in the appendix (appendix, p5), including iron-correction for liver
T1 with an algorithm related to LiverMultiScan cT1 (Perspectum, Oxford) but lacking crossscanner standardisation and therefore not comparable to LiverMultiScan cT1 .
Spirometry
Spirometry, including forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory volume at the first second
of exhalation (FEV1), was performed as per recommended guidance (appendix, p5).
CPET
Symptom-limited CPET was undertaken using a cycle ergometer. Following two minutes of
unloaded cycling, the work rate was increased to 20W, followed by a 10W/min ramp. Participants
were encouraged to reach their maximal work rate (appendix, p6).

Six-minute walk test
Participants were asked to walk for six-minutes in a pre-marked corridor. Borg scale, heart rate
and oxygen saturation were measured immediately before and after the test (appendix, p5).
Questionnaires
Questionnaires were completed using an electronic data capture (CASTOR EDC,
https://www.castoredc.com). Depression, anxiety and quality of life measures were assessed using
the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) depression module (PHQ-9)9, General Anxiety Disorder
Questionnaire (GAD-7)10 and Short Form-36 (SF-36) survey11. Cognitive function was assessed
using the Montreal Cognitive Asessment (MoCA). The Medical Research Council (MRC)
dyspnea12 scale, Dyspnoea-12 score13 and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)14 were used to assess the
extent of breathlessness and fatigue, respectively (appendix, p6).
Laboratory assessments
Blood-based testing consisted of a complete blood count, biochemical analysis, coagulation
testing, assessment of liver and renal function, markers of cardiac injury and measures of
electrolytes, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, and lactate dehydrogenase.
Admission data collection and blood tests
Details on clinical symptoms or signs, vitals and laboratory findings during admission were
extracted from electronic medical records. The severity of disease during hospital admission was
graded as per the WHO ordinal scale for clinical improvement (appendix for definition, p2).

Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were described using mean and standard deviation (SD) for parametric data
and median with interquartile range (IQR) for non-parametric data in the tables. Normality was
assessed by visual inspection of histograms. Mean differences between two groups were evaluated
using Student’s t-tests or Mann-Whitney U-tests as appropriate. Categorical variables were
reported as frequency and percentages. Associations between two groups were compared using the
Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. Pearson’s or Spearman’s correlation
coefficients were used to describe the relationship between two variables where relevant. Analyses
of brain imaging derived phenotypes (IDP’s) were undertaken after Gaussianisation (quantile
normalisation) of all continuous variables and adjusting for age, sex, BMI, diastolic and systolic
blood pressure, smoking and head size. The conventional level of statistical significance of 5%
was used and not corrected for multiple comparisons. Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS Version 26.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).

Role of the funding source
The funders of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data
interpretation, writing of the article, or the decision to submit for publication.

Results
Mean age of the patient group was 55±13 years and 34/58 (59%) were men (Table 1). Thirteen
(22%) belonged to Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic groups. Twenty one patients (36%) had
required high dependency unit (HDU) or intensive care unit (ICU) admission; 20/21 required
mechanical ventilation (non-invasive ventilation or intubation). Median duration of hospitalisation
was 8·5 days (IQR 5·0 - 17·0). Patients were assessed between 2-3 months from disease-onset at
median interval of 2·3 months (IQR 2·06 - 2·53). Baseline characteristics of patients and group9

matched controls are listed in Table 1. At follow-up, COVID-19 patients had a mildly increased
resting heart rate, respiratory rate and reduced oxygen saturation relative to controls.

MRI data (Table 2) were available for up to 54/58 patients [brain MRI (n=54), lung MRI (n=53)
and cardiac and abdominal MRI (n=52)] and 28/30 controls (Study flowchart and summary of
missing data in appendix Figure 1, p27, and appendix Table 7, p25).
Lung health and exercise tolerance
During hospital admission, 54/58 (93%) patients had abnormal chest X-ray or computed
tomography (CT). At ~2-3 months, persistent parenchymal abnormalities on lung MRI were
present in 32/53 (60%) patients (Table 2, appendix Figure 2, p28). Thirty-six (64%) experienced
symptoms of significant breathlessness (MRC dyspnoea score ≥2) and 30/55 (55%) complained
of fatigue (FSS ≥4). On average, COVID-19 survivors had a significantly lower FEV1, FVC and
higher FEV1/FVC ratio at follow-up (Table 3). Abnormalities were noted in FEV1 % predicted in
6/56 (11%), FVC % predicted in 7/56 (13%). Patients covered a shorter distance on 6MWT than
controls (405±118m vs 517±106m, p<0.0001). Four (7%) patients desaturated at the end of the
test. During CPET, patients achieved lower peak maximal oxygen uptake (VO2) (Figure 1), % of
max VO2 predicted, anaerobic threshold (% of predicted VO2 max), oxygen uptake efficiency slope
and higher ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide (VE/VCO2 slope) (Table 3, Figure 1)
compared to controls. VE/VCO2 slope, a marker of ventilatory efficiency, was worse in those with
MRI lung parenchymal abnormalities versus those without (Median 35, IQR (32 - 43) versus 32,
IQR (29 - 34), p=0·007). CPET was stopped early in 15/51 (29%) patients due to fatigue and
myalgia and 5/51 (10%) of patients due to breathlessness. Anaerobic threshold was reached ealier

in patients. VE/VCO2 and six-minute walk distance correlated with markers of inflammation in
COVID-19 patients (Figure 1, appendix Table 4, p21).
Brain health and cognition
During hospital admission, one patient developed a right occipital stroke; follow-up brain MRI
revealed signs of a mature infarct. Blinded qualitative assessment (by expert neuroradiologist) of
brain MRI at 2-3 months did not reveal group differences in burden of small vessel disease, white
matter hyperintensities, haemorrhage or ischaemic changes between patients and controls
(appendix Table 3, p20). Quantitative measurements of grey matter volumes (globally and
regionally), white matter volumes and cerebral perfusion were not different between groups
(appendix Table 2, p12). Compared to controls, COVID-19 patients had a higher T2* signal on
susceptibility-weighted imaging in the left and right thalamus (Figure 1) and increased mean
diffusivity in the left posterior thalamic radiation and sagittal stratum (left and right averaged).
Patients also showed a trend for higher quantitative measure of white matter hyperintensity volume
on T2-FLAIR imaging compared to controls (Table 2).
Cognitive performance in the visuospatial/executive domain was impaired among patients
compared to controls (MoCA visuospatial score ≤4 in 40% patients versus 16% in controls,
p=0·01). Among patients, 28% (16/58) had a total MoCA score that was abnormal according to
the established cut-off of <26 compared to 17% (5/30) of controls. Median MoCA scores in
patients (27, IQR 25 - 29), however, were not statistically significantly different from controls (28,
IQR 27 - 29, p=0·146) (Figure 1). Periventricular white matter hyperintensities and right thalamic
T2* correlated with markers of inflammation in patients (appendix Table 4, p21), but not with
cognitive performance.

Cardiac health
During admission, 38/58 (66%) were screened for cardiac involvement with troponin (high
sensitivity Troponin I). Three (8%) were found to have an elevated troponin during admission. At
follow-up, troponin was normal in all patients (appendix Table 1, p9). Left ventricular function
was normal and comparable between groups. Right ventricular ejection fraction in patients ranged
from 43 to 79%, and on average was normal and not different from controls (appendix Table 2,
p12). Slice-averaged basal and mid-ventricular native T1, a marker of fibrosis or inflammation on
cardiac MRI, was significantly elevated in patients (Table 2, Figure 1). Basal myocardial T1 was
elevated (> 2 SD from average control T1) in 26% (13/50) of patients. Mid myocardial T1 was
elevated in 8% (4/51) and average of base and mid myocardial T1 in 24% (12/50) of patients.
Native T2, a marker of oedema, was not different between patients and controls. Extracellular
volume fraction (a measure of diffuse fibrosis) tended to be higher in the base but the numerical
differences failed to reach statistical significance (Table 2). Focal fibrosis burden was mildly
increased in patients. Both basal and mid-ventricular myocardial T1 correlated moderately
(appendix, p2 for definition) with CRP and pro-calcitonin in patients (appendix Table 4, p21,
Figure 1), but not in controls (p>0·1).
Liver health
Acute liver injury (appendix, p2) was seen in 31% (18/58) of patients. At 2-3 months, 11% had
persistent liver injury (non-specific pattern) on blood tests (appendix Table 1, p9). On MRI,
another 10% (5/52) of patients had signs of liver injury evidenced by increased iron-corrected liver
T1 (Table 2, Figure 1). Iron-corrected liver T1 is a histologically validated imaging biomarker of
hepatic fibro-inflammation,15 which has subsequently been developed in LiverMultiScan where it
is increasingly being used to monitor the response of hepatitis to novel therapies.16 By contrast,

liver fat, iron and extracellular volume fraction (a marker of diffuse fibrosis) did not differ between
groups. Iron-corrected liver T1 correlated moderately with systemic markers of inflammation
(white cell count, neutrophil, monocyte count and CRP) in patients (appendix Table 4, p21), but
also in controls.
Haematological system and spleen
Haematological abnormalities including lymphocytopenia and thrombocytopenia were seen in
47% (27/58) and 2% (1/58) of patients at admission respectively and an elevated CRP (>10mg/L)
was seen in 98% (57/58). At follow-up, all abnormalities in lymphocyte and platelet count returned
to normal. However, patients tended to have higher a CRP (p=0·058) (appendix, Table 1, p9).
Splenic volume and tissue characteristics on MRI did not differ significantly between patients and
controls (appendix Table 2, p12).
Kidney health
Six (10%) patients developed acute kidney injury (Table 1), of whom two required renal
replacement therapy during admission. At 2-3 months, 3% (2/58) of patients had residual renal
impairment which was not present prior to COVID-19. On average, creatinine and estimated
glomerular filtration rate were not significantly different between patients and controls (appendix
Table 1, p9). Despite this, both average (left and right) renal cortical T1 and corticomedullary
differentiation, markers of renal injury/fibro-inflammation, were abnormal in patients (Table 2,
Figure 1). A significantly higher renal cortical T1 (> 2 SD than control mean) was seen in 29%
(15/51) of patients. Patients with acute kidney injury during admission had a higher average renal
cortical T1 (1711±90ms versus 1582±81ms, p=0·001) and lower corticomedullary differentiation
(318±59 versus 405±83, p=0·016; appendix Figure 2, p28) compared to those without. Kidney

oxygenation did not differ between patients and controls (appendix Table 2, p12). Average renal
cortical T1 had a moderate correlation with markers of inflammation (CRP, pro-calcitonin) in
patients at follow-up (appendix Table 4, p21).
Mental health and quality of life
At 2-3 months, a higher proportion of COVID-19 patients reported moderate to severe symptoms
of depression (i.e., PHQ-9 score ≥6, 39% versus 17%, p=0·036) and anxiety (i.e, GAD-7 score ≥6,
35% versus 10%, p=0·012) compared to controls (Table 4, Figure 2). Patients reported a
significantly reduced quality of life in all domains (Table 4, Figure 2). Importantly, impairment
in both physical and emotional health imposed significant role limitations among COVID-19
survivors. The severity of depression and anxiety did not consistently associate with markers of
inflammation (except for monocyte count) or multiorgan injury among COVID-19 patients
(appendix Table 4, p21). However, a moderate correlation was seen between extent of mood
symptoms and anxiety and ongoing breathlessness (MRC dyspnoea score) (PHQ-9: r=0·58,
p<0·0001, GAD-7: r=0·41, p=0·002).
Severity of disease and persistent inflammation
Severity of illness during admission (WHO ordinal scale) (appendix Table 4, p21, Table 5, p23)
correlated moderately with inflammatory markers at follow-up, signs of persistent
inflammation/injury in the lungs, liver, kidneys, and VE/VCO2 on CPET. Notably, even in patients
who were not critically ill (i.e, those who were not intubated or ventilated or receiving

Discussion
The present holistic study uniquely characterised the medium-term effects of COVID-19 infection
on multiple vital organs, functional capacity, mental health and cognition in post-hospital survivors
of moderate to severe infection. The key findings of our study are: First, at 2-3 months from
disease-onset, a proportion of COVID-19 patients displayed abnormalities in the lungs, brain,
heart, liver and kidneys on MRI. Second, the severity of acute illness during admission correlated
with markers of multiorgan injury at follow-up. Third, limitations in exercise tolerance (CPET and
six-minute walk distance) and imaging biomarkers correlated with the extent of persistent
inflammation. Deconditioning, symptoms of persistent breathlessness, and fatigue were prominent
among patients and interfered with activities of daily living and quality of life. Finally, moderate
to severe self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms were more common among patients than
controls and were related to the burden of persistent breathlessness at follow-up.

Studies examining the temporal evolution of lung abnormalities on serial high-resolution CT scans
have revealed that persistent inflammatory changes may be seen in up to 71% of COVID-19
survivors at three months post discharge.7,17 Consistent with this, we observed a high proportion
of parenchymal abnormalities on lung MRI, albeit at a lower frequency than that seen on CT.
Previous investigations have shown that survivors of SARS pneumonia can be left with more
permanent damage to the lungs18 and abnormalities in lung function for months to even years after
infection. In our study, 13% of patients exhibited abnormalities on spirometry (FVC) at 2-3
months. Although we were unable to assess diffusion capacity (DLCO) in our patients, our findings

are in line with a recent report by Mo and colleagues, who demonstrated similar anomalies on
spirometry and additionally described an impairment in DLCO in up to 47% of cases.19

The affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for extra-pulmonary organs is increasingly recognised. Post-mortem
studies have confirmed the presence of high titres of SARS-CoV-2 viral load and expression of
receptors (Angiotensin-2 Converting Enzymes/ACE2 and Type II transmembrane serine
protease/TMPRSS) for viral entry and replication in the lungs, kidneys, liver, heart and brain.5
Injury to extrapulmonary organs may be mediated by direct viral toxicity, widespread
immunological response and/or thromboinflammation exacerbated by endothelitis.6

Occult neurological injury has been suspected in COVID-19 due to a high burden of non-specific
neurological symptoms.20 Although neurological symptoms were frequent (~50%) in our
unselected cohort, imaging evidence of severe neurologic injury on MRI was rare. Nevertheless,
patients demonstrated increased bilateral thalamic T2* signal on susceptibility-weighted imaging
and increased mean diffusivity in posterior thalamic radiations and sagittal stratum. Susceptibilityweighted imaging is often used to detect blood breakdown products and calcification.21 That these
abnormalities could reflect a higher burden of microvascular events among COVID-19 survivors
is tentatively supported by a trend towards an increased volume of white matter hyperintensities
among patients. This would be consistent with the higher frequency of cerebrovascular events
reported by others.20 While the exact pathophysiology underlying the cerebrovascular disease is
yet to be clarified, it is possible that a combination of hypercoagulable state acutely and chronic
neuroinflammatory processes, supported by the association of white matter hyperintensity
volumes,22 T2* abnormalities and inflammatory markers, play an important role. The cognitive

profile observed (primarily dysexecutive) among patients is also consistent with a vascular pattern,
replicating previous reports of dysexecutive syndrome in COVID-19 survivors.23 Although our
cross-sectional study design limits the extent to which causal associations can be made, our
findings suggest a potential link between COVID-19 and future risk of cognitive decline.

Evidence of acute myocardial injury can be seen in up to a third of hospitalised patients with
moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and associates with fatal outcomes.2,24 Cardiac MRI
has been shown to be particularly useful in providing a diagnosis in patients with suspected cardiac
involvement.25 In a recent study by Puntmann and colleagues,26 cardiac MRI showed evidence of
a high burden of inflammation (60% of patients), as seen by elevated native T1, T2 and some
biventricular impairment in convalescing COVID-19 patients, a third of whom required
hospitalisation. In our study of hospitalised patients, at 2-3 months, only 26% had a significantly
elevated native T1. Native T2 and cardiac function did not differ from our risk-factor matched
cohort consistent with an earlier study by Knight and colleagues25. A point worth noting is that
differences in prevalence estimates on MRI studies may arise from variations in ‘reference ranges’
(normal versus risk-factors matched controls), methodological differences (sequence parameters,
field strength, analysis method), and patient characteristics. Our approach to use a risk-factor
matched control group (prospectively enrolled under identical scan conditions) as reference
suggests that abnormal tissue characteristics on MRI in 26% of patients could not be explained by
the mere presence of comorbidities. Furthermore, myocardial native T1 moderately correlated with
serum markers of inflammatory response, indicating a possible relationship between the extent of
ongoing inflammation and myocardial tissue abnormalities.

Several independent investigations3,4 have confirmed a high prevalence of acute liver injury in
hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Potential mechanisms include hyperinflammatory syndrome,
hypoxia-mediated metabolic derangements, venous thrombosis and drug-induced hepatitis.27
Direct infection of cholangiocytes has also been suggested, as SARS-CoV-2 may injure the bile
ducts by binding to ACE2 receptors.28 We observed that 11% of patients had persistent blood
biomarker evidence of liver injury at 2-3 months, and another 10% demonstrated increased ironcorrected liver T1, a marker of fibroinflammation.15 In our study, the extent of liver injury on MRI
moderately correlated with inflammatory markers, supporting the role of inflammation in
promoting hepatic damage.

The kidneys are amongst the most common targets of SARS-CoV2, with acute kidney injury
reported in 0.5-37% of hospitalised COVID-19 patients.2-4,29,30 Direct infection of renal cells may
occur via ACE2 receptors which are enriched in podocytes and endothelial cells.31 Associated
histopathological abnormalities include prominent lymphocytic endothelitis, acute tubular
necrosis, diffuse erythrocyte aggregation, peritubular obstruction and podocyte injury.31 We
showed that 29% of patients had abnormal renal tissue characteristics on MRI. In particular,
cortical T1, a marker of renal inflammation/injury was prolonged and accompanied by a loss of

Chronic inflammation represents a sustained reaction of the immune system to an inflammatory
stimulus (i.e, viral nucleic acid) accompanied by tissue damage.33 The association of multiple
imaging markers of organ abnormalities and inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients, but
not in controls, suggests that chronic inflammation may play a role in mediating multiorgan
abnormalities.34 Although critical illness has also been shown in prior studies to associate with
systemic inflammation35, we found that MRI evidence of multiorgan abnormalities was not limited
to patients with critical disease alone. Further efforts to understand the role of specific
immunopathological mechanisms underlying this inflammatory process, and strategies to arrest
them, could be important in limiting the long-term detrimental effects of COVID-19 on vital
organs.

Insights from earlier studies of SARS survivors36 have raised concerns that limitations in exercise
tolerance may persist for months after infection. In our study, patients achieved a shorter sixminute walk distance, lower peak VO2 and lower % of predicted VO2 max at the anaerobic
threshold (VT1). VE/VCO2 slope, a measure of ventilatory efficiency, was worse in patients with
parenchymal abnormalities and both VE/VCO2 and six-minute walk distance correlated with
markers of systemic inflammation. Of note, a higher proportion of patients (29%) stopped the
CPET early because of generalised muscle ache and fatigue rather than breathlessness. These
findings suggest that muscle wasting, secondary to a catabolic state induced by severe illness37 and
potentially ongoing inflammation38, could be an important contributor to exercise limitations,
along with lung parenchymal abnormalities.

In addition to coping with the debilitating acute effects of COVID-19, survivors experience a range
of mental stressors whilst in-hospital and after discharge. Not surprisingly, we and others39,40 have
observed a high-level of self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression among survivors.
Infection-triggered cytokine dysregulation and the neurotropic potential of SARS-CoV-2 have
widely been speculated to induce psychopathological sequelae among COVID-19 patients,
consistent with neuroinflammatory mechanisms implicated in other psychiatric disorders.41 Here,
although the burden of ongoing symptoms of breathlessness associated with mood and anxiety
symptoms, we did not see a consistent association between markers of systemic inflammation or
organ injury and depression. Given the limited sample size of our study, a more focussed approach
in a larger cohort could yield further insights into such relationships and offers the potential to
identify novel targets for neuropsychiatric therapeutic modulation.
Limitations
The relatively small sample size of this single-centre study, its cross-sectional design and lack of
correction for multiple comparisons are important limitations which curtail the generalisability of
our findings and accuracy of prevalence estimates. The lack of pre-COVID imaging also limits
our ability to make causal inferences about the mechanism of multiorgan abnormalities in patients
recovering from COVID-19 infection. However, this is the first exploratory study to
comprehensively undertake a holistic assessment of multiple vital organs, mental, cognitive and
physical health in patients with COVID-19 post-hospital discharge. These findings underscore the
need for further large scale investigations as is currently planned by Public Health England through
the Post-HOSPitalisation COVID-19 (PHOSP-COVID)42 national consortium and its two MRI
sub-studies C-MORE and COVERSCAN. The assessment of lung function and lung injury were
limited given the lack of DLCO assessments and CT chest in all subjects, due to restricted access to

lung function testing. The use of lung MRI in place of CT could have underestimated the
prevalence of lung injury. Controls in our study were not hospitalised, thus group differences in
symptomatology, mental health, exercise capacity and quality of life may not be specific to
COVID-19. We excluded patients with severe comorbidities to provide more reliable estimates of
COVID-19 specific injury and may have underestimated the extent of multiorgan damage in the
wider population. There were ethnoracial differences between the control and COVID-19 patients
enrolled in this study which may have played a role in prevalence estimates of multiorgan injury.
Finally, whether the findings on MRI have any long term clinical implications remains to be
determined by further longitudinal follow-up studies.

Conclusions
Among post-hospital survivors of moderate to severe COVID-19 infection, abnormalities on
multiorgan MRI were seen in a proportion of patients at 2-3 months from disease onset. The
severity of acute illness and serum markers of inflammation correlated with the extent of
multiorgan changes on MRI and reduced exercise tolerance at follow-up. COVID-19 survivors
experience a high burden of depression, anxiety, as well as reduced quality of life post-hospital
discharge. Our findings underscore the need to further understand the pathophysiological
mechanisms underpinning multiorgan MRI tissue abnormalities and to provide a holisticintegrated multidisciplinary model of clinical care for COVID-19 patients post hospital discharge.

Figure 1. Systemic effects of COVID-19 and relationship with inflammatory response. A, B:
Comparison of cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) parameters (VO2 max and VE/VCO2)
between comorbidity-matched control and COVID-19 survivors. C: Relationship between
VE/VCO2 and white cell count in COVID-19. D, E: Comparison of susceptibility weighted
T2* signal (left and right thalamus) and MoCA scores between control and COVID-19
survivors. F: Relationship between periventricular white matter hyperintensity volume
(pWMH’s) volume and white cell count in COVID-19. G, H: Comparison of myocardial
native T1 (base and mid ventricle) between control and COVID-19 survivors. I: Relationship
between basal native T1 and C-reactive protein (CRP). J, K: Comparison of liver T1 and
iron-corrected liver T1 between control and COVID-19 survivors. An in-house algorithm
was used to calculate iron-corrected T1, so these values cannot be compared to the
LiverMultiScan cT1. L: Relationship between iron-corrected liver T1 and CRP in COVID19. M, N: Comparison of average cortical kidney T1 and corticomedullary differentiation in
control and COVID-19 survivors. O: Relationship between average cortical kidney T1 and
CRP in COVID-19 (p-values for comparisons are from Student’s t-tests for all variables;
Spearman’s correlation coefficient and p-values are reported for correlations, # signifies pvalues were derived from comparison of variables that were Gaussianised and
deconfounded).

A: The radar plot demonstrates that patients with COVID-19 (blue line) were more likely to
experience impairment in energy, general health, physical health, social and emotional well-being
and increased pain when compared to controls (orange line). Both physical and emotional factors
caused significant role limitations among patients. B, C: Moderate to severe self-reported
symptoms of depression and anxiety were also reported by a third of patients who were
hospitalised with COVID-19.
