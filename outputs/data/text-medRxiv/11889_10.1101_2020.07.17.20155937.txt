Antibody responses vary widely between individuals1, complicating the correct classification
of low-titer measurements using conventional assay cut-offs. We found all participants in a
clinically diverse cohort of SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ individuals (n=105) – and n=33 PCR+
hospital staff – to have detectable IgG specific for pre-fusion-stabilized spike (S)
glycoprotein trimers, while 98% of persons had IgG specific for the receptor-binding domain
(RBD). However, anti-viral IgG levels differed by several orders of magnitude between
individuals and were associated with disease severity, with critically ill patients displaying
the highest anti-viral antibody titers and strongest in vitro neutralizing responses. Parallel
analysis of random healthy blood donors and pregnant women (n=1,000) of unknown
serostatus, further demonstrated highly variable IgG titers amongst seroconverters, although
these were generally lower than in hospitalized patients and included several measurements
that scored between the classical 3 and 6SD assay cut-offs. Since the correct classification of
seropositivity is critical for individual- and population-level metrics, we compared different
probabilistic algorithms for their ability to assign likelihood of past infection. To do this, we
used tandem anti-S and -RBD IgG responses from our PCR+ individuals (n=138) and a large
cohort of historical negative controls (n=595) as training data, and generated an equalweighted learner from the output of support vector machines and linear discriminant analysis.
Applied to test samples, this approach provided a more quantitative way to interpret anti-viral
titers over a large continuum, scrutinizing measurements overlapping the negative control
background more closely and offering a probability-based diagnosis with potential clinical
utility. Especially as most SARS-CoV-2 infections result in asymptomatic or mild disease,
these platform-independent approaches improve individual and epidemiological estimates of
seropositivity, critical for effective management of the pandemic and monitoring the response
to vaccination.

Introduction

59
60

The characterization of nascent SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses is critical to our

61

understanding of the infection at individual and population levels. Although several groups

62

have carried out elegant work in this regard2–5, consensus on several key issues remains

63

outstanding, such as: whether all infected persons develop an antibody response to the virus;

64

what the duration of these responses is following peak levels; and what titers provide

65

protective immunity against re-infection6–8.

66
67

Antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S) are particularly relevant, as

68

S-directed antibody specificities mediate virus neutralizing activity and new S variants (such

69

as B.1.1.7) have emerged. Indeed, the vast majority of COVID-19 vaccines are based on S

70

surface antigens, as the goal is to induce neutralizing antibodies that block viral entry into

71

ACE2-positive target cells9,10. Furthermore, because serological studies play such a central

72

role in immunosurveillance, there is a pressing need for robust assays and quantitative

73

statistical tools to examine antibody titers of varying levels after vaccination and natural

74

infection in different target groups.

75
76

To meet these needs, we developed highly sensitive and specific IgM, IgG and IgA ELISA

77

assays based on mammalian cell-expressed pre-fusion-stabilized soluble trimers of the

78

SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein and the receptor-binding domain (RBD), and used them

79

in tandem to survey serum samples from large cohort of individuals PCR+ for SARS-CoV-2.

80

To validate our assays, we repeatedly analyzed a large set of serum samples from historical

81

blood donors as negative controls (n=595) - critical for determining the assay background.

82
83

As we show, and as has been reported by others4,7,11, the magnitude of response varied

84

greatly between seropositive individuals and was associated with disease severity. Those with

85

most pronounced symptoms had the highest anti-viral antibody titers, while those with

86

asymptomatic or mild disease (including otherwise healthy blood donors and pregnant

87

women) exhibited a range of antibody levels, with many measurements in close

88

approximation to the negative control background, complicating their correct classification.

89

To improve upon the dichotomization of a continuous variable – which is common to many

90

clinical tests but results in a loss of information12,13 – we used tandem anti-S and RBD IgG

91

data from confirmed infections and negative controls to train different probabilistic

algorithms to assign likelihood of past infection. Compared to strictly thresholding the assay

93

at 3 or 6 standard deviations (SD) from the mean of negative control measurements, these

94

more quantitative approaches modelled the probability a sample was positive, improving the

95

identification of low titer values and paving the way for a greater utility to antibody test

96

results.

Results

100

Study samples are detailed in Fig. 1A and Table 1.

101
102

Antibody test development

103
104

We developed ELISA protocols to profile IgM, IgG and IgA specific for a pre-fusion-

105

stabilized spike (S) glycoprotein trimer14, the RBD, and the nucleocapsid (N). Trimer

106

conformation was confirmed in each batch by cryo-EM15 and a representative subset of study

107

samples was used for assay development (Fig. S1A). In contrast to other studies reporting

108

significant cross-reactivity to S in the UK population16, we did not observe reproducible IgG

109

reactivity to S or RBD across all 595 historical controls in the study, although two individuals

110

who were PCR-positive for endemic coronaviruses (ECV+) in the last six months displayed

111

reproducible IgM reactivity to both SARS-CoV-2 N and S, and two 2019 blood donors (from

112

n=72 tested) had low anti-S IgM reactivity (Fig. S1B). Thus, further investigation is required

113

to establish the contribution of potential cross-reactive memory SARS-CoV-2 responses17.

114
115

Responses to S and the RBD were highly correlated and our assay revealed a greater than

116

1,000-fold difference in anti-viral IgG titers between Ab-positive individuals when

117

examining serially diluted sera (Fig. S1C and D). In SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ individuals, anti-

118

viral IgG titers were comparable for S (EC50=3,064; 95% CI [1,197 - 3,626]) and N

119

(EC50=2,945; 95% CI [543 - 3,936]) and lower for RBD [EC50=1,751; 95% CI 966 - 1,595].

120

Notably, a subset (ca. 10%) of the SARS-CoV-2-confirmed individuals did not have

121

detectable IgG responses against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N) (Fig. S1C), as

122

previously reported18. Therefore, we did not explore responses to N further. These results

123

highlight that the choice of antigen is critical for seropositivity estimates.

124
125

Elevated anti-viral Ab titers and neutralizing responses are associated with increased disease

126

severity

127
128

When screening samples from SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ individuals from whom clinical

129

information was available (n=105), we detected potent IgG responses against S in 100% of

130

participants, and against RBD in 97% of persons (Fig. 1B), supporting that natural infection

131

engenders a robust B cell response in the majority of cases, as reported8. IgM and IgA

132

responses were generally weaker and more variable and also spread over a large range (Fig.

133

1B).

134
135

To examine this further, PCR+ individuals were grouped according to their clinical status:

136

non-hospitalized (Cat. 1), hospitalized (Cat. 2) or admitted to the intensive care unit (Cat. 3).

137

To validate our clinical classification, we measured serum IL-6 levels in a random subset of

138

PCR+ individuals (n=64). IL-6 feeds Ab production19–22, and as has been reported23, was

139

increased in samples from individuals with severe disease (Fig. 1C). Furthermore,

140

multivariate analyses (accounting for the effects of age, sex and days from symptom

141

onset/PCR test) revealed increased anti-viral IgM, IgG and IgA to be associated with disease

142

severity, as has been reported7 (Fig. 1C and S1D-E, Table S1). Severe disease was most

143

strongly associated with virus-specific IgA, suggestive of mucosal pathology. We did not

144

observe an association between ICU or IL-6 status and IgM levels, supporting that levels of

145

the cytokine and IgA mark a more severe clinical course of COVID-19 (Fig. S1D). Anti-RBD

146

IgA responses were slightly lower in non-hospitalized and hospitalized females compared to

147

males, and trended similarly for S (Fig. S1D and Table S1), consistent with females

148

developing less severe disease4.

149
150

Across all PCR+ individuals (sampled up to two months from PCR test), anti-viral IgG levels

151

were maintained, while IgM and IgA decreased, in agreement with their circulating t1/2 and

152

viral clearance (Fig. S1D and Table S1). In longitudinal patient samples (sequential sampling

153

of PCR+ individuals in the study) where we observed seroconversion, IgM, IgG and IgA

154

peaked with similar kinetics when all three isotypes developed, although IgA was not always

155

generated in non-hospitalized or hospitalized individuals (Fig 1E), supporting a more diverse

156

antibody response in severe disease.

157
158

To extend these observations, we characterized the in vitro virus neutralizing antibody

159

response in PCR+ patients. Using an established pseudotype virus neutralization assay24, we

160

detected neutralizing antibodies in the serum of all SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ individuals screened

161

(n=48) (Fig. 1F). Neutralizing responses were not seen in samples before seroconversion or

162

negative controls (Fig. 1E and F). A large range of neutralizing ID50 titers was apparent, with

163

binding and neutralization being highly correlated (Fig. S1D). In agreement with the binding

164

data, the strongest neutralizing responses were observed in samples from patients in intensive

165

care (g.mean ID50=5,058; 95% CI [2,422 - 10,564]) (Fig 1E).

166
167

In healthy blood donors and pregnant women (n=1,000 collected between weeks 17-21 2020

168

– the same time as the patient cohort), who did not have signs or symptoms of COVID-19 for

169

two weeks prior to sampling, and had not been hospitalized for COVID-19, IgG titers varied

170

greatly but were generally lower than hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and were comparable

171

to titers in PCR+ hospital staff (n=33) who also had never been hospitalized following

172

infection (Fig. 1G).

173
174

Probabilistic analyses of positivity

175
176

As SARS-CoV-2 results in asymptomatic or mild disease in the majority of cases, and

177

antibody titers decline following peak responses and viral clearance, the correct classification

178

of low titer values is critical to individual and population-level estimates of antibody-

179

positivity for COVID-19. Indeed, several healthy donor test samples screen in this study had

180

optical densities between the 3 and 6 SD cut-offs for both or a single antigen (Fig. 1G),

181

highlighting the problem of assigning case to low responder values.

182
183

To further our understanding of the assay boundary, we repeatedly analyzed a large number

184

of historical (SARS-CoV-2-negative) controls (blood donors from the spring of 2019, n=595)

185

alongside test samples throughout the study. We considered the spread of negative values

186

critical, since the use of a small and unrepresentative set of controls can lead to an incorrectly

187

set threshold, which can considerably skew the seropositivity estimate. This is illustrated by

188

the random sub-sampling of non-overlapping groups of negative controls, resulting in a 40%

189

difference in the positivity estimate (Fig. 2A). Worryingly, many clinically approved tests use

190

a ratio between a known positive and negative serum calibrator to classify seropositivity 25,

191

although we show here that these are highly variable within the population.

192
193

Therefore, to exploit individual titers generated against multiple antigens, we used anti-S and

194

RBD data from PCR+ individuals and negative controls to train probabilistic algorithms to

195

assign likelihood of past infection. To this end, we compared different probabilistic

196

algorithms – logistic regression (LOG), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), linear support

197

vector machines (SVM) and quadratic SVM (SVM2) – suited to ELISA data (Fig. 2B,

198

Materials and Methods). Using ten-fold cross validation and training models on both proteins

199

simultaneously (S and RBD), we found all methods worked well, with sensitivity >98% and

200

specificity >99.6% (Fig. 2D). On these metrics, LDA gave the highest specificity. Logistic

201

regression had similarly high specificity on some folds of the training data, but with higher

202

sensitivity. However, we deliberately considered balanced and unbalanced folds (where

203

case:control ratios varied between folds) and found LOG to show the least consistency across

204

strategies, which reflects that the proportion of cases in a sample directly informs a logistic

205

model’s estimated parameters. SVM methods had lower specificity than LDA in the training

206

data, but higher sensitivity.

207
208

The standard methods, calling positives by a fixed number of SD above the mean of negative

209

controls, displayed two extreme behaviors: 3-SD had the highest sensitivity (100%) while 6-

210

SD had the highest specificity, and the lowest sensitivity (Fig. S2A), emphasizing that the

211

number of SD above the mean is a key parameter, but one which is not learnt in any formal

212

data-driven manner. Both SVM and LDA offer linear classification boundaries, but we can

213

see that the probability transition from negative to positive cases is much sharper for LDA

214

(Fig. 2B) – potentially resulting in false negatives when applied to the test data, but giving the

215

model high specificity in the training data under cross-validation. SVM exhibits a softer

216

probability transition around its classification boundary, offering a much more nuanced

217

approach to the points lying in the mid-range of the two proteins. SVM2 creates a nonlinear

218

boundary, but the cross validation suggested that this didn’t improve performance relative to

219

linear SVM.

220
221

Given these results, we chose to create ensemble learners, which were unweighted averages

222

of SVM (linear) or SVM2 (quadratic) and LDA (ENS and ENS2, respectively), as well as a

223

LOG-LDA learner, to balance the benefits of each approach. The ensemble learners seemed

224

to combine the benefits of their parent methods (Fig. S2A). Test data points in the lower right

225

region of each plot are the hardest to classify due to the relative scarcity of observations in

226

this region in the training dataset and ENS (SVM-LDA) showed the greatest uncertainty in

227

these regions, appropriately. Given these results, we chose to use ENS (SVM-LDA), with an

228

average sensitivity >99.1% and specificity >99.8%, to analyze test data. When applied to the

229

serology data, the output of ENS is the probability of each sample being antibody-positive.

230
231

In healthy donor test data, the ENS learner estimated 7.8% (95% CI [4.8-12.5]) positivity in

232

samples collected in week 21 of 2020 (Fig. S2B, Table S2). This is in contrast to the SD

233

thresholding, which identified 12% and 10% positivity for S and RBD, respectively, at 3 SD,

234

and 8% and 7.5, respectively, at 6 SD (Table S2). Therefore, apart from providing more

235

accurate population-level estimates – critical to seroprevalence studies, where we have

236

applied these and related tools in a large cohort26 – these methods have the potential to

237

provide more nuanced information about titers to an individual after an antibody test. For

238

example, test samples with a 30-60% chance of being antibody positive (Fig. S2B) can be

239

targeted for further investigation or help inform vaccine boosting, as antibody titers decline

240

over time from peak responses. Moreover, such tools are applicable to other clinical metrics

241

where a continuous scale is dichotomized and code for implementation is freely available via

242

our online repositories.

Discussion

245
246

Benefitting from a robust antibody test developed alongside a diagnostic clinical laboratory

247

responsible for monitoring sero-reactivity during the pandemic, we profiled SARS-CoV-2

248

antibody responses in three cohorts of clinical interest. COVID-19 patients receiving

249

intensive care showed the highest anti-viral Ab titers, developing augmented serum IgA and

250

IL-6 with worsening disease and more advance respiratory and/or gastrointestinal pathology.

251

These results support the use of cytokine and isotype-level measures for patient

252

management23.

253
254

Importantly, our neutralization data illustrated that nearly all SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ individuals

255

developed neutralizing antibodies capable of preventing S-mediated cell entry, albeit at

256

different titers. These data support that SARS-CoV-2 infection generates a functional B cell

257

response in the majority of people8 and serve as a useful comparator to titers engendered by

258

vaccination. Indeed, the first generation of mRNA vaccines have been reported to generate

259

neutralizing titers comparable to samples from individuals with mild infection in our

260

study9,10.

261
262

Outside of the severe disease setting, it is critical to accurately determine who and how many

263

people have seroconverted for clinical and epidemiological reasons. However, this is

264

complicated by low titer values, which in some cases – and increasingly with time since

265

exposure or vaccination 5,27 – can overlap outlier values among negative control samples.

266

Test samples with true low anti-viral titers fall into this range, highlighting the need to better

267

understand the assay boundary. To improve upon strictly thresholding the assay, we

268

developed probabilistic approaches for ELISA data that characterized the uncertainty in

269

individual measures. These approaches provide more statistically sound measurements at the

270

level of cohorts and the potential to communicate more nuanced information to individual

271

patients – although the communication of probability needs to be approached with care to

272

ensure what is described matches what an individual interprets. Furthermore, such

273

approaches will aid the analysis of data from assay platforms measuring the responses to

274

multiple antigens; longitudinal studies of the duration of immunity after SARS-CoV-2 spike-

275

based vaccines and natural infection; and facilitate comparison of responses in different

276

cohorts.

Human samples and ethical declaration

280

Samples from PCR+ individuals and admitted COVID-19 patients (n=105) were collected by

281

the attending clinicians and processed through the Departments of Medicine and Clinical

282

Microbiology at the Karolinska University Hospital. Samples were used in accordance with

283

approval by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (registration no. 2020-02811). All

284

personal identifiers were pseudo-anonymized, and all clinical feature data were blinded to the

285

researchers carrying out experiments until data generation was complete. PCR testing for

286

SARS-CoV-2 RNA was by nasopharyngeal swab or upper respiratory tract sampling at

287

Karolinska University Hospital. As viral RNA levels were determined using different qPCR

288

platforms (with the same reported sensitivity and specificity) between participants, we did not

289

analyze these alongside other features. PCR+ individuals (n=105) were questioned about the

290

date of symptom onset at their initial consultation and followed-up for serology during their

291

care, up to 2 months post-diagnosis. Serum from SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ individuals was

292

collected 6-61 days post-test, with the median time from symptom onset to PCR being 5

293

days. In addition, longitudinal samples from 10 of these patients were collected to monitor

294

seroconversion and isotype persistence.

295
296

Hospital workers at Karolinska University Hospital were invited to test for the presence of

297

SARS-CoV-2 RNA in throat swabs in April 2020 and virus-specific IgG in serum in July

298

2020. We screened 33 PCR+ individuals to provide additional training data for ML

299

approaches. All participants provided written informed consent. The study was approved by

300

the National Ethical Review Agency of Sweden (2020-01620) and the work was performed

Anonymized samples from blood donors (n=100/week) and pregnant women (n=100/week)

304

were randomly selected from their respective pools by the department of Clinical

305

Microbiology, Karolinska University Hospital. No metadata, such as age or sex information

306

were available for these samples in this study. Pregnant women were sampled as part of

307

routine for infectious diseases screening during the first trimester of pregnancy. Blood donors

308

(n=595) collected through the same channels a year previously were randomly selected for

309

use as negative controls. Serum samples from individuals testing PCR+ for endemic

as additional negative controls. The use of study samples was approved by the Swedish

312

Ethical Review Authority (registration no. 2020-01807). Stockholm County death and

313

Swedish mortality data was sourced from the ECDC and the Swedish Public Health Agency,

314

respectively. Study samples are defined in Table 1.

Serum sample processing

317

Blood samples were collected by the attending clinical team and serum isolated by the

318

department of Clinical Microbiology. Samples were anonymized, barcoded and stored at -

319

20oC until use. Serum samples were not heat-inactivated for ELISA protocols but were heat-

320

inactivated at 56oC for 60 min for neutralization experiments.

322

SARS-CoV-2 antigen generation

323

The plasmid for expression of the SARS-CoV-2 prefusion-stabilized spike ectodomain with a

324

C-terminal T4 fibritin trimerization motif was obtained from14. The plasmid was used to

325

transiently transfect FreeStyle 293F cells using FreeStyle MAX reagent (Thermo Fisher

326

Scientific). The ectodomain was purified from filtered supernatant on Streptactin XT resin

327

(IBA Lifesciences), followed by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 in 5 mM

328

Tris pH 8, 200 mM NaCl.

329
330

The RBD domain (RVQ – QFG) of SARS-CoV-2 was cloned upstream of a Sortase A

331

recognition site (LPETG) and a 6xHIS tag, and expressed in 293F cells as described above.

332

RBD-HIS was purified from filtered supernatant on His-Pur Ni-NTA resin (Thermo Fisher

333

Scientific), followed by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200. The nucleocapsid

334

was purchased from Sino Biological.

335
336

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA

337

96-well ELISA plates (Nunc MaxiSorp) were coated with SARS-CoV-2 S trimers, RBD or

338

nucleocapsid (100 μl of 1 ng/μl) in PBS overnight at 4oC. Plates were washed six times with

339

PBS-Tween-20 (0.05%) and blocked using PBS-5% no-fat milk. Human serum samples were

340

thawed at room temperature, diluted (1:100 unless otherwise indicated), and incubated in

341

blocking buffer for 1h (with vortexing) before plating. Serum samples were incubated

342

overnight at 4oC before washing, as before. Secondary HRP-conjugated anti-human

343

antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated with samples for 1 hour at room

344

temperature. Plates were washed a final time before development with TMB Stabilized

Chromogen (Invitrogen). The reaction was stopped using 1M sulphuric acid and optical

346

density (OD) values were measured at 450 nm using an Asys Expert 96 ELISA reader

347

(Biochrom Ltd.). Secondary antibodies (all from Southern Biotech) and dilutions used: goat

348

anti-human IgG (2014-05) at 1:10,000; goat anti-human IgM (2020-05) at 1:1000; goat anti-

349

human IgA (2050-05) at 1:6,000. All assays of the same antigen and isotype were developed

350

for their fixed time and samples were randomized and run together on the same day when

351

comparing binding between PCR+ individuals. Negative control samples were run alongside

352

test samples in all assays and raw data were log transformed for statistical analyses.

353
354

In vitro virus neutralisation assay

355

Pseudotyped viruses were generated by the co-transfection of HEK293T cells with plasmids

356

encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein harboring an 18 amino acid truncation of the

357

cytoplasmic tail14; a plasmid encoding firefly luciferase; a lentiviral packaging plasmid

358

(Addgene 8455) using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen). Media was changed 12-16 hours

359

post-transfection and pseudotyped viruses harvested at 48- and 72-hours, filtered through a

360

0.45 µm filter and stored at -80°C until use. Pseudotyped neutralisation assays were adapted

361

from protocols validated to characterize the neutralization of HIV, but with the use of

362

HEK293T-ACE2 cells. Briefly, pseudotyped viruses sufficient to generate ~100,000 RLUs

363

were incubated with serial dilutions of heat-inactivated serum for 60 min at 37°C.

364

Approximately 15,000 HEK293T-ACE2 cells were then added to each well and the plates

365

incubated at 37°C for 48 hours. Luminescence was measured using Bright-Glo (Promega)

366

according to the manufacturer’s instructions on a GM-2000 luminometer (Promega) with an

367

integration time of 0.3s. The limit of detection was at a 1:45 serum dilution.

368
369

IL-6 cytometric bead array

370

Serum IL-6 levels were measured in a subset of PCR+ serum samples (n=64) using an

371

enhanced sensitivity cytometric bead array against human IL-6 from BD Biosciences (Cat #

372

561512). Protocols were carried out according to the manufacturer’s recommendations and

373

data acquired using a BD Celesta flow cytometer.

375

Statistical analysis of SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ data

376

All univariate comparisons were performed using non-parametric analyses (Kruskal-Wallis,

377

stratified Mann-Whitney, hypergeometric exact tests and Spearman rank correlation), as

378

indicated, while multivariate comparisons were performed using linear regression of log

379

transformed measures and Wald tests. For multivariate tests, all biochemical measures (IL-6,

380

PSV ID50 neut., IgG, IgA, IgM) were log transformed to improve the symmetry of the

381

distribution. As “days since first symptom” and ”days since PCR+ test” are highly correlated,

382

we cannot include both in any single analysis. Instead, we show results for one, then the other

383

(Supp. Table 1).

384
385

Probabilistic algorithms for classifying antibody positivity

386

Prior to analysis, each sample OD was standardized by dividing by the mean OD of ”no

387

sample controls” on that plate or other plates run on the same day. This resulted in more

388

similar distributions for 2019 blood donor samples with 2020 blood donors and pregnant

389

volunteers, as well as smaller coefficients of variation amongst PCR+ COVID patients for

390

both SPIKE and RBD.

391
392

Our probabilistic learning approach consisted of evaluating different algorithms suited to

393

ELISA data, which we compared through ten-fold cross validation (CV): logistic regression

394

(LOG), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machines (SVM) with a linear

395

kernel, and quadratic SVM (SVM2). Logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis both

396

model log odds of a sample being case as a linear equation with a resulting linear decision

397

boundary. The difference between the two methods is in how the coefficients for the linear

398

models are estimated from the data. When applied to new data, the output of logistic

399

regression and LDA is the probability of each new sample being a case. Support vector

400

machines is an altogether different approach. We opted for a linear kernel, once again

401

resulting in a linear boundary. SVM constructs a boundary that maximally separates the

402

classes (i.e. the margin between the closest member of any class and the boundary is as wide

403

as possible), hence points lying far away from their respective class boundaries do not play an

404

important role in shaping it. SVM thus puts more weight on points closest to the class

405

boundary, which in our case is far from being clear. Linear SVM has one tuning parameter C,

406

a cost, with larger values resulting in narrower margins. We tuned C on a vector of values

407

(0.001, 0.01, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10) via an internal 5-fold CV with 5 repeats (with the winning

408

parameter used for the final model for the main CV iteration). We also note that the natural

409

output of SVM are class labels rather than class probabilities, so the latter are obtained via the

410

method of Platt28.

412

We considered three strategies for cross-validation: i) random: individuals were sampled into

413

folds at random, ii) stratified: individuals were sampled into folds at random, subject to

414

ensuring the balance of cases:controls remained fixed and iii) unbalanced: individuals were

415

sampled into folds such that each fold was deliberately skewed to under or over-represent

416

cases compared to the total sample. We sought a method with performance that was

417

consistently good across all cross-validation sampling schemes, because the true proportion

418

of cases in the test data is unknown, and we want a method that is not overly sensitive to the

419

proportion of cases in the training data. We chose to assess performance using sensitivity and

420

specificity, as well as consistency.

421
422

Given the good performance of all learners (described in the results), we considered the

423

prediction surface associated with each SVM, LDA, SVM-LDA ensemble, and the standard

424

3-SD, 6-SD hard decision boundaries. Note that while methods trained on both proteins can

425

draw decision contours at any angle, SD methods are limited to vertical or horizontal lines.

426

We can see that success, or failure, of the SD cut-offs depends on how many positive and

427

negative cases overlap for a given measure (S or RBD) in the training sample. In the training

428

data the two classes are nearly linearly separable when each protein is considered on its own,

429

which explains good performance of 3-SD and 6-SD thresholds. However, the test data

430

contain many more points in the mid-range of S-RBD, which makes hard cut-offs a

431

problematic choice for classifying test samples.

432
433

We trained the learners on all 733 training samples and used these to predict the probability

434

of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in blood donors and pregnant volunteers sampled in 2020.

435

We inferred the proportion of the sampled population with positive antibody status each week

436

using multiple imputation. We repeatedly (1,000 times) imputed antibody status for each

437

individual randomly according to the ensemble prediction, and then analyzed each of the

438

1,000 datasets in parallel, combining inference using Rubin's rules, derived for the Wilson

439

binomial proportion confidence interval29.

Figure 1: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ab phenotypes in COVID-19 patients, PCR+ individuals, blood donors and pregnant women.
(A) Study samples. (B) Raw optical density (450nm) for anti-S and -RBD IgG (first graph) IgM and IgA responses (second graph) in SARS-CoV-2 PCR+
individuals (n=105). A 6SD cut-off based on n=595 control (HC) values is shown for the IgG assay and a small number of HC samples are shown (red) for
the IgM and IgA assays. Individual responses for the three isotypes are shown by a heatmap. (C) Circulating IL-6 levels in serum are associated with
disease severity. (D) Anti-viral antibody levels are associated with disease severity, most pronounced for anti-viral IgA. Anti-S and RBD responses are
graphed together. P values for S are shown. (E) Two discordant longitudinal profiles of seroconversion and neutralisation capacity are shown in hospitalized
COVID-19 patients. (F) In vitro pseudotyped virus neutralization ID50 titers are associated with disease severity, with the highest titers observed in Cat 3
(ICU) patients. n=48 SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ individuals were analyzed in duplicate. (G) Comparison of anti-S IgG levels between PCR+ individuals (n=105),
PCR+ hospital staff (PCR+ HS, n=33), blood donors (BD, n=500) and pregnant women (PW, n=500). 3 and 6 SD cut-offs are shown by red lines.

Figure 2: Probability-based seropositivity estimates in blood donors and pregnant women
(A) Random sub-sampling of non-overlapping negative controls illustrates how the range of negative control (C) values can influence a
conventional test cut-off, here 6 SD from the mean of the respective C groups. In the test data, depending on the control values used to
set the test threshold for positivity, SP estimates varied 40%. Blood donor and pregnant women sample values are used as an example.
Anti-S IgG values are shown. (B) Comparison of probabilistic algorithms suited to ELISA measurements. Logistic regression (LOG),
linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machines (SVM) and quadratic SVM (SVM2). Learners were trained using anti-S and
RBD IgG data from 595 negative control values and 138 SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ individual samples. Ensemble (ENS) learners were
generated from the output of SVM-LDA, SVM2-LDA and LOG-LDA.

Figure S1: Antibody phenotypes in PCR+ individuals.
(A) Study samples used for assay development. (B) Anti-S IgM reactivity observed in a random subset of historical controls. Binding
was confirmed in these samples in an independent experiment. No reproducible IgG reactivity to S trimers of the RBD was observed
across all historical controls in the study. (C) Serial dilution of n=30 random PCR+ individuals. ECV+ (n=4) controls are shown in red.
(D) Spearman’s rank correlation of PCR+ dataset features and antibody levels. DOB - date of birth; d-p SymO - days post-symptom
onset; d-p PCR – days post SARS-CoV-2+ PCR; PSV ID50 – neutralizing titer. (E) Adjusted fold-change compared to Category 1
PCR+ individuals. The effects of age (DOB), sex, days from PCR test were considered.
