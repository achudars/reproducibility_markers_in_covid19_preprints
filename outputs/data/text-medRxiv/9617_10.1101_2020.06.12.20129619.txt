Key Points:
Question: What are the differences between healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers with
COVID-19?

Findings: In this population-based cross-sectional study there were 4,230 healthcare workers comprising
17.5% of COVID-19 cases. Healthcare workers were diagnosed with COVID-19 at a rate 5.5 times higher
than the general population with 0.8% of all healthcare workers, compared to 0.1% of non-healthcare
workers.

Meaning: High healthcare worker COVID-19 burden highlights the importance of physical distancing
from colleagues, appropriate personal protective equipment, as well as likely substantial testing bias
and under-ascertainment of COVID-19 in the general population.

Abstract
Importance: Protecting healthcare workers (HCWs) from COVID-19 is a priority to maintain a safe and
functioning healthcare system. The risk of transmitting COVID-19 to family members is a source of stress
for many.

Objective: To describe and compare HCW and non-HCW COVID-19 cases in Ontario, Canada, as well as
the frequency of COVID-19 among HCWs’ household members.

Design, Setting, and Participants: Using reportable disease data at Public Health Ontario which captures
all COVID-19 cases in Ontario, Canada, we conducted a population-based cross-sectional study
comparing demographic, exposure, and clinical variables between HCWs and non-HCWs with COVID-19
as of 14 May 2020. We calculated rates of infections over time and determined the frequency of within
household transmissions using natural language processing based on residential address.

Exposures and Outcomes: We contrasted age, gender, comorbidities, clinical presentation (including
asymptomatic and presymptomatic), exposure histories including nosocomial transmission, and clinical
outcomes between HCWs and non-HCWs with confirmed COVID-19.

Results: There were 4,230 (17.5%) HCW COVID-19 cases in Ontario, of whom 20.2% were nurses, 2.3%
were physicians, and the remaining 77.4% other specialties. HCWs were more likely to be between 3060 years of age and female. HCWs were more likely to present asymptomatically (8.1% versus 7.0%,
p=0.010) or with atypical symptoms (17.8% versus 10.5%, p<0.001). The mortality among HCWs was
0.2% compared to 10.5% of non-HCWs. HCWs commonly had exposures to a confirmed case or outbreak
(74.1%), however only 3.1% were confirmed to be nosocomial. The rate of new infections was 5.5 times
higher in HCWs than non-HCWs, but mirrored the epidemic curve. We identified 391 (9.8%) probable
secondary household transmissions and 143 (3.6%) acquisitions. Children <19 years comprised 14.6% of
secondary cases compared to only 4.2% of the primary cases.

Conclusions and Relevance: HCWs represent a disproportionate number of COVID-19 cases in Ontario
but with low confirmed numbers of nosocomial transmission. The data support substantial testing bias
and under-ascertainment of general population cases. Protecting HCWs through appropriate personal
protective equipment and physical distancing from colleagues is paramount.

Introduction
We are in the midst of a global pandemic from Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 is impacting healthcare
systems globally which are coping with outbreaks in congregate living facilities and the rapid influx of
critically ill patients requiring care in intensive care units.

1

Preventing healthcare worker (HCW)

infections is critical to maintaining a functioning healthcare system, and they have been a priority group
for testing throughout the pandemic.

2

The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with substantial

stress and adverse mental health outcomes for HCWs.

3

The proportion of COVID-19 cases affecting HCWs from single centre reports has ranged from 0 to 29%.

6

4-

In China approximately 4% of all COVID-19 cases were in HCWs, with an infection rate three times

higher in HCWs compared to the general population.

7-9

HCWs may be exposed to COVID-19 in the

community, at work from patients as well as fellow HCWs, and may pose a risk to others around them if
infected. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified research priorities related to the burden
and risk factors for HCW COVID-19 infections as well as risk factors for household transmission from
HCWs.

3

To our knowledge no studies have evaluated transmission of COVID-19 from HCWs to household

contacts. Our objectives were to describe demographic, exposure, and clinical symptom differences
between HCW and non-HCW COVID-19 cases in Ontario, as well as the frequency of HCW household
members with COVID-19.

Methods

Design and Setting
We conducted a cross-sectional study comparing HCW and non-HCW COVID-19 cases. Data collection
began with the first COVID-19 diagnosed patient in Ontario, Canada on 21 January 2020 until 14 May
2020. We obtained the data from reportable surveillance infectious disease data at Public Health
Ontario (PHO). The activities described in this manuscript were conducted in fulfillment of PHO’s
legislated mandate to provide scientific and technical advice and operational support in an emergency
or outbreak situation

(Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion Act, SO 2007, c 10).

Research

ethics committee approval was sought and determined to be not required because the activities
described are considered public health practice and not research.

Data Source
We obtained the data from the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS), the Toronto Public
Health Coronavirus Rapid Entry System (CORES), the Ottawa Public Health COVID-19 Ottawa Database
(The COD), and Middlesex-London COVID-19 Case and Contact Management tool (CCMtool) accessed on
25 May 2020 (but only including cases up to 14 May 2020 to account for a delay in reporting). These
databases are web-based information systems for the reporting and surveillance of diseases of public
health significance in Ontario. PHO is a Crown corporation dedicated to protecting and promoting the
health of all Ontarians and reducing inequities in health. All probable or confirmed COVID-19 positive
individuals are entered by local public health units.

Definitions and Variables

A HCW was defined as an individual with an occupation involving caring for patients. All other
individuals were classified as non-HCWs. We used confirmed COVID-19 cases only. Demographic
information available included gender, age, comorbidities (anemia, asthma, cancer, cardiovascular
condition, chronic liver disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, immunocompromised,
neurologic disorder, obesity, pregnancy or 6 weeks post-partum, renal condition, tuberculosis, and other
chronic medical condition). Exposures were classified by the local public health unit contact
investigation as outbreak associated or close contact to a confirmed or probable case of COVID-19,
community transmission with no epidemiological link, travel to an endemic area for COVID-19 outside of
Ontario within the incubation period of 14 days, or missing exposure information. A separate variable to
identify nosocomial cases was added 3 April 2020. Analysis with the nosocomial variable was limited to
this time frame. Clinical symptoms were classified as asymptomatic, presymptomatic (defined as having
a testing date prior to symptoms onset date), typical with fever and/or cough, atypical (any other
symptom), or missing. Clinical outcomes were classified in descending order as died, requiring a
ventilator, intensive care unit without a ventilator, hospitalized, or not hospitalized.

Onset of illness was defined as symptom onset date, which was available for 66.3% of the cohort. For
those missing symptom onset date we calculated the median number of days from test date to
symptom onset date where the data was available (median=4 days) and performed a deterministic
imputation. If test date was not available we used the median time from symptoms onset to date
reported to the local public health unit (median=5 days). Onset date in asymptomatic individuals was
the testing date or reporting date if not available. We defined household spread using a natural
language processing algorithm to link confirmed HCW COVID-19 cases to other probable or confirmed
COVID-19 cases by residential address. If symptom onset dates in the non-HCWs were two or more days
earlier than the HCWs then these were defined as a probable HCW

acquisition

. If household cases

symptom onset dates were two or more days following a HCWs’ then this was defined as a probable

transmission

. Infections that were -1, 0, or +1 days apart were classified as unknown direction of

transmission. As a sensitivity analysis we used ±4 days for greater confidence in the direction of
transmission.

Statistical Analysis
Variables were compared between HCWs and non-HCWs by chi-squared tests, t-tests, or non-parametric
tests as appropriate in bivariate analyses with two-side p-values <0.05 as statistically significant. Rates of
infection in non-HCWs were determined using population denominators from Statistics Canada. HCW
denominators were calculated from publically available sources at the Canadian Institute for Health
Information and Statistics Canada.

Results
There are an estimated 552,560 HCWs and 14,311,868 non-HCWs in Ontario. As of 14 May 2020 there
were 24,202 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Ontario, including 4,230 (17.5%) HCWs. There was
geographical variability in the proportion of COVID-19 HCW cases ranging from 4-42% across Ontario’s
34 public health units. In general, the regions with the largest numbers of cases did not overlap with
those with the highest proportions (Figure 1). For instance, Toronto and Peel regions had the highest
numbers of cases (1,315 and 403), but were in the lower half of regions by the proportion of cases that
were HCWs (15.3% and 11.2%), at the time of this analysis.

HCWs with COVID-19 were more likely to be female and were more commonly between the ages of 3060 years compared to non-HCWs. There were 4 (0.1%) HCWs ≥75 years of age compared to 6,158
(30.8%) non-HCWs. Approximately one quarter of both HCW and non-HCWs had one or more
comorbidities (Table 1).

Asymptomatic infections occurred in 8.1% of HCWs and 7.0% of non-HCWs (p=0.010). Presymptomatic
infections were infrequently identified but more common in HCWs (1.4% versus 0.4%, p<0.001). Of
those with symptoms at diagnosis, atypical symptoms were more common in HCWs (17.8% versus
10.5%, p<0.001). The most common atypical symptoms were headache, fatigue, and sore throat (Table
1). HCWs had milder clinical courses represented by 95.9% not requiring hospitalization and only 8
(0.2%) deaths, compared to non-HCWs with 78.3% managed outside of hospital with 2,103 (10.5%)
deaths (p<0.001).

HCWs were identified as cases at a rate 5.5 times higher than non-HCWs with rates of 765.5 per 100,000
compared to 139.5 per 100,000. There were 98 physicians infected, comprising 2.3% of HCW infections,
with an infection rate approximately two times the general population. Nurses comprised 20.2% of HCW
infections and 3.5% of all Ontario infections with an infection rate of approximately four times higher
than the general population. Other HCWs, which includes personal support workers (PSWs), comprised
the largest group with an infection rate of 6.5 times that of the general population (Table 2).

The difference in daily new infection rates varied between 2-6 fold throughout the epidemic, mirroring
the epidemic curve (Figure 2). As testing capacity improved in Ontario the difference in detection rates
began to fall at the end of April and early May.

From the available exposure history data, 74.1% of HCWs either had contact with a confirmed cases or
were associated with an outbreak. A recent travel history was overall uncommon (4.9%), except for
doctors (22.4%). Only 3.1% of HCWs were documented to have acquired their infection nosocomially in
the subset of HCWs with this data available. Nurses had the highest risk of nosocomial transmission
(7.1%) (Table 1).

There were 675 (16.9%) HCW household cases, with a median of 1 and a range of 1-5 household cases.
We observed that 391 (9.8%) of HCWs probably transmitted COVID-19 to a household member; of
these, 14.6% were to children <19 years, 65.7% to those 19-59 years and 19.7% to those ≥60 years. We
observed 143 (3.6%) instances where the HCW probably acquired the infection from a household
contact; of these, 4.2% were from children <19 years, 62.9% from adults 19-59 years and 32.9% from
adults ≥60 years. In 141 (3.5%) contacts the direction of transmission could not be determined (Table 3).
In the sensitivity analysis using ±4 days, instead of ±2 days, there were 275 (6.9%) transmissions and 90
(2.3%) acquisitions.

Interpretation
HCWs have comprised 17.5% of the 24,202 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Ontario as of May 14, 2020.
The rate of new infections per day varied between two and six times the general population over time
and by type of HCW with physicians being lower risk than nurses, who were lower risk than other
specialties combined, which includes PSWs.

In a long term care facility outbreak in Washington

state, HCWs comprised 26% of infections, however the clinical course was substantially less severe in
HCWs compared to residents and visitors.

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the United

States reported on over 9,000 infected HCWs. Compared to our study they observed higher rates of
hospitalizations (10% versus 3% in our study) but similar mortality (0.3% versus 0.2%).

13

Studies from China and the Netherlands reported that approximately 1% of HCWs within hospitals were
infected with COVID-19.

14,15

In our study, 0.8% of all HCWs and 0.1% of non-HCWs in Ontario have been

identified as COVID-19 cases, including 0.3% of doctors and 0.6% of nurses. A report from Alberta,
Canada identified that 0.1% of all HCWs were COVID-19 cases (including 0.3% of doctors) compared to
0.1% of the general population.

16

Alberta has similar IPAC guidance on personal protective equipment

(PPE) to Ontario which includes surgical masks, eye protection, gloves, and gowns for suspected or
confirmed COVID-19 patients and N95 respirators for aerosol generating medical procedures. Our study
was not able to evaluate the adequacy of PPE used by HCWs, however it is unlikely to explain the
differences between Ontario and Alberta. There are multiple potential explanations for the higher rate
in Ontario HCWs. Ontario likely has substantially more undiagnosed cases in the general population as
well as more long-term care home outbreaks. However, we were unable to determine from our data
which HCWs worked in long-term care. We could not reconcile the large number of outbreak associated
cases with the low numbers of household acquisition (2-4%) and nosocomial acquisition (3.1%). One
explanation is that a single long term care home case in either a HCW or resident did qualify as an
“outbreak” in Ontario. It is possible that HCWs are acquiring COVID-19 at work from fellow HCWs or
asymptomatic patients. In Alberta only 12 (8.8%) HCW COVID-19 cases were from occupational

16

exposures.

Further study is needed to better understand the nosocomial risk of COVID-19 among

HCWs.

A study from the United Kingdom prospectively tested HCWs at a large hospital and found that while
positivity was high it did not vary between patient-facing HCWs (15%), non-clinical HCWs with
nosocomial risk factors (16%), and low risk HCWs without nosocomial risk (18%).

17

A study from Wuhan,

China observed a cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in 1.1% (110 of 9685) of HCWs. However, the rates
were 0.5% among HCWs with direct contact to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients, 1.6% in
HCWs with patient contact in non-COVID departments, and 1.0% among HCWs with no patient
contact.

14

The higher risk of infection in both non-COVID-19 clinical areas and non-clinical areas,

suggests that HCWs may be acquiring COVID-19 from co-workers or in the community. We feel the data
highlight the importance of maintaining physical distancing from colleagues (i.e. in break room or during
meals) or utilizing additional PPE when physical distancing cannot be achieved. A policy for universal
masking of HCWs was recently adopted in Ontario, and the importance of this policy in protecting both
patients as well as fellow HCWs should be emphasized.

Testing bias is almost certainly contributing to the discrepancy in HCW and non-HCW rates. In a report
from Lombardy, Italy that performed serological studies on HCWs and non-HCWs, they identified that
23% of HCWs sampled were positive for COVID-19 antibodies compared to 62% of the general
population.

18

Furthermore, we identified dramatically different mortality rates between HCWs and non-

HCWs. This is likely due to both age differences and substantial underestimates of true population
disease burden, which may actually be closer to the rate we observed in HCWs. HCWs have been a
priority population for testing throughout the pandemic, even during times of limited capacity. Until the
last two weeks of the study period COVID-19 testing was generally restricted to high risk groups (i.e.
hospitalized patients, HCWs, other essential workers, vulnerable populations). Population based
serological studies will enable a better understanding of this discrepancy.

HCWs may be a potential source of COVID-19 transmission to both patients and household contacts. In
particular since it has become apparent that presymptomatic cases comprise a substantial portion of

19

transmissions.

Transmitting to household members has been a source of stress for HCWs

20

and has

To our knowledge this is the first study evaluating

within household transmission risks associated with HCWs. We observed that 9.8% of infected HCWs
likely transmitted COVID-19 to a household contact. Using a stricter definition of 4 days, we observed a
transmission rate of 6.9%. Interestingly, children were infrequently the source of infection compared to
secondary household cases (4.2% versus 14.6%), consistent with prior research demonstrating that
children may be inefficient transmitters of COVID-19.

21

This study has some limitations. The data quality is dependent on entry by 34 public health units across
Ontario. Data completeness and quality may vary, and it is possible some HCWs were misclassified. The
variable for nosocomial transmission was added later in the study period and largely incomplete even
after restricting to the later time period. This may be in part due to the challenge of assigning causality
of infections without a clear exposure history or multiple potential exposures. The general population,
doctor, and nurse denominators used to calculate infection rates are accurate and current, however
there is no complete data source for other HCWs in Ontario. We used various sources to arrive at an
overall estimated HCW denominator which may impact the ability to compare rates. We lacked
granularity in the type of HCW beyond physician or nurse (i.e. PSW) as well as the setting of
employment (e.g. long-term care, hospital, etc.). Finally, while HCWs were priority groups for testing
throughout the pandemic, testing criteria and capacity varied substantially. Case identification was
substantially better throughout for HCWs and as a result general population cases are undoubtedly
underestimates.

In conclusion, 0.8% of HCWs in Ontario have been diagnosed with COVID-19. We identified clinical,
demographic, and geographical differences from over 4,000 HCWs, compared to almost 20,000 nonHCWs. Despite these large numbers, relatively few were linked to a nosocomial exposure. Further
system improvements and monitoring are needed to protect all HCWs from COVID-19 with an emphasis
on physical distancing from colleagues and appropriate use of PPE.
