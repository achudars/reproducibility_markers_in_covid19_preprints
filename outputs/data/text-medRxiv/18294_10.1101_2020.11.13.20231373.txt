Abstract

40

Importance: The effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on immune responses during pregnancy

41

have not been systematically evaluated.

42

Objective: To assess the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy on inflammatory

43

and humoral responses in maternal and fetal samples and compare antibody responses to

44

SARS-CoV-2 among pregnant and non-pregnant women.

45

Design: Immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed using samples from pregnant and

46

non-pregnant women who had either tested positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2. We

47

measured, proinflammatory and placental cytokine mRNAs, neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)

48

receptor expression, and tetanus antibody transfer in maternal and cord blood samples.

49

Additionally, we measured anti-spike (S) IgG, anti-S-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG, and

50

neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses to SARS-CoV-2 in serum or plasma collected from non-

51

pregnant women, pregnant women, and cord blood.

52

Setting: Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH)

53

Participants: Pregnant women were recruited through JHH outpatient obstetric clinics and the

54

JHH Labor & Delivery unit. Non-pregnant women were recruited after receiving outpatient

55

SARS-CoV-2 testing within Johns Hopkins Health System, USA. Adult non-pregnant women

56

with positive RT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2, within the age range of 18-48 years, were

57

included in the study.

58

Exposures: SARS-CoV-2

59

Main Outcomes and Measures: Participant demographic characteristics, antibody titers,

60

cytokine mRNA expression, and FcRn receptor expression.

61

Results: SARS-COV-2 positive pregnant women expressed more IL1β, but not IL6, in blood

62

samples collected within 14 days versus > 14 days after a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 test, with

63

similar patterns observed in the fetal side of placentas, particularly among asymptomatic

64

pregnant women. Pregnant women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection also had reduced

65

anti-S-RBD IgG titers and were less likely to have detectable nAb as compared with non-

66

pregnant women. Although SARS-CoV-2 infection did not disrupt FcRn expression in the

67

placenta, maternal transfer of nAb was inhibited by SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy.

68

Conclusions and Relevance: SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy was characterized by

69

placental inflammation and reduced antiviral antibody responses, which may impact the efficacy

70

of COVID-19 therapeutics in pregnancy. The long-term implications of placental inflammation for

71

neonatal health also requires greater consideration.

4

The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute

73

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in over 40 million infections

74

and over one million deaths worldwide1. Despite global efforts to characterize the pathogenesis

75

of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the effects of infection on immunity during pregnancy remain

76

undefined. Due to pregnancy-associated immune and endocrine fluctuations, pregnant women

77

and their fetuses are at greater risk for severe complications caused by infectious diseases2.

78

Current observations suggest that most pregnant women with COVID-19 are asymptomatic or

79

experience mild disease. The U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC), however, reports that one

80

in four women, aged 15–49 years, hospitalized for COVID-19 during March 1–August 22, 2020

81

were pregnant, and these women were more likely to require mechanical ventilation compared

82

to nonpregnant women3. The CDC also reports that women infected with SARS-CoV-2 during

83

pregnancy are at higher risk for preterm birth4. Because maternal immune activation can be

84

associated with adverse fetal outcomes, including preterm birth 5,6, it is possible that SARS-

85

CoV-2 during pregnancy may have detrimental effects on the developing fetus.

86

During pregnancy, the immune response to viral infection includes secretion of

87

proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-6, not only at the site of infection but in the

88

placenta as well; these cytokines can readily enter the amniotic cavity and interfere with normal

89

fetal development5,6. Thus, even in the absence of severe maternal symptoms or fetal viral

90

infection, the maternal immune response to SARS-CoV-2 could lead to short and long-term

91

consequences in the fetus and neonate, including multiorgan system damage and a

92

predisposition for adverse developmental outcomes2,7–9. At the same time, the maternal

93

immune response can also have a protective effect on neonatal health, including the placental

94

Fc receptor (FcRn)-mediated transfer of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies transplacentally10,11.

95

In the present study, we investigated immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 using

96

maternal blood, cord blood, and placenta samples collected from pregnant women who had

97

either tested positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2 prior to admission and delivery at the Johns

Hopkins Hospital (JHH). We measured maternal and cord blood serum or plasma anti-spike (S)

99

and anti-S-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG and neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses to

100

SARS-CoV-2, whole blood proinflammatory cytokine mRNA expression, as well as placental

101

cytokine and FcRn expression. Furthermore, we compared antibody responses to an outpatient

102

non-pregnant cohort of women with confirmed COVID-19.

105

Cohorts. Two cohorts were included in this study: the pregnant cohort, consisting of 33 pregnant

106

women who either tested positive (n=22) or negative (n=11) for SARS-CoV-2 prior to delivery (in

107

inpatient or Labor and Delivery settings) at the JHH; and the non-pregnant cohort, consisting of

108

women within reproductive age (18-48 years of age), as defined by WHO 12 (n=17) who tested

109

positive for SARS-CoV-2 at an outpatient clinical testing site within the JHH Health System.

110

Comparing demographic characteristics between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative pregnant

111

women revealed differences in maternal age at delivery, race, and ethnicity. SARS-CoV-2

112

positive pregnant women gave birth at a younger age (median =27; IQR 23-34) compared to

113

SARS-CoV-2 negative pregnant women (median =32; IQR 29-35) (p<0.05, Table 1), were more

114

likely to identify as Other (63.64%) or Black/African American (22.73%) than SARS-CoV-2

115

negative pregnant women (p<0.001, Table 1), and were more likely to identify as being of

116

Hispanic/Latina ethnicity (50%) (p<0.05; Table 1). No significant differences were found

117

between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative pregnant participants in pre-pregnancy BMI, BMI at

118

delivery, gestational age at birth, neonate late-onset sepsis, chorioamnionitis, time between

119

membrane rupture and delivery, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, delivery type (cesarean vs

120

vaginal), size of neonate, sex of neonate, NICU stay, or neonatal readmission (eTable 1). In

121

comparing SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women and non-pregnant women, pregnant women

122

were younger (pregnant median age =27 IQR 23-34; non-pregnant median age =34 IQR 28-41)

126

Cytokine expression after SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Increased inflammation

127

caused by infection during pregnancy can be detrimental for long-term fetal and neonatal

128

outcomes2,9,13. We assayed cytokine mRNA expression during SARS-CoV-2 infection as a

129

biomarker for inflammation. Because IL-1β activation during pregnancy can cause adverse fetal

130

outcomes2,14,15, we measured IL1β mRNA expression in maternal blood, cord blood, and the

131

maternal and fetal sides of placentas, which did not differ between SARS-CoV-2 positive and

132

negative pregnant women (Figure 1A-D). To test whether IL1β expression differed as a

133

function of maternal symptoms, samples were further categorized based on whether pregnant

134

women were asymptomatic, symptomatic, or SARS-CoV-2 negative. There was a pattern of

135

greater IL1β expression in samples from asymptomatic pregnant women (Figure 1E-G), with a

136

significant increase in the fetal side of placenta from asymptomatic patients compared to

137

symptomatic patients (p<0.05; Figure 1H). To assess whether the expression of IL1β differed

138

depending on the number of days between a pregnant woman’s PCR test and blood sample

139

collection, maternal blood IL1β mRNA expression within each symptom category were

140

compared based on the time window between diagnosis and blood collection. Day 14 was

141

chosen for analysis based on the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2, which extends to 14 days

142

after symptom onset16. IL1β expression in maternal blood was higher in samples collected

143

within 14 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test compared with samples collected > 14 days after

144

test, regardless of symptoms (p<0.05; Figure 1I).

145

We measured IL6 mRNA expression in maternal and fetal blood and tissue from our SARS-

146

CoV-2 positive and negative pregnant cohort. It is important to note that all SARS-CoV-2

147

positive women experienced mild to moderate disease from SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast

148

to the elevation observed among severe COVID-19 cases in non-pregnant individuals17–19, there

149

was no change in the expression of IL6 in blood or placentas based on SARS-CoV-2 infection

150

status (eFigure 1A-D), symptom status (eFigure 1E-H), or duration of time between a positive

151

SARS-CoV-2 test and sample collection (eFigure 1I). These data provide evidence of selective

152

IL1β mRNA upregulation, particularly early after infection and on the fetal side of the placenta in

153

non-severely ill pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

154

Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant and non-pregnant women. To evaluate the

155

impact of pregnancy on immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, antibody responses measured in

156

serum or plasma samples were collected at a median of 34 (IQR: 31.5 – 40) days since

157

confirmed infection, from pregnant (18.91+29.57 days post confirmed infection) and non-

158

pregnant (37.29+12.66 days post confirmed infection) women who had tested positive for

159

SARS-CoV-2. Pregnant and non-pregnant women showed similar titration of IgG (i.e., area

160

under the curve [AUC]) recognizing the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (Figure 2A).

161

In contrast, pregnant women had significantly lower anti-S-RBD IgG titers than non-pregnant

162

women (p<0.05, Figure 2B). Titers of nAb, however, which correlate with anti-S-RBD

163

antibodies20, were measured and were not significantly different between pregnant and non-

164

pregnant women (Figure 2C). We also observed that significantly fewer pregnant women (8/17)

165

had detectable nAb titers (i.e., > 1:20 titer) compared with non-pregnant women (16/17)

166

(p<0.05; Figure 2C), indicating reduced production of neutralizing antibodies in a subset of

167

pregnant women.

168

To assess whether the presence of COVID-19 symptoms was linked to antibody production,

169

antibody responses were analyzed based on symptom categories. The only antibody response

170

that was influenced by COVID-19 symptoms during pregnancy was maternal anti-S-RBD IgG

171

titers, which were lower in symptomatic, but not asymptomatic, pregnant women as compared

172

with non-pregnant women (p<0.05; Figure 2D-F). Although overall nAb titers were not

173

influenced by COVID-19 symptoms, both symptomatic (6/13) and asymptomatic (2/4) pregnant

174

women were less likely to have detectable nAb than non-pregnant, symptomatic (16/17) women

175

(p<0.05, Figure 2F).

176

To further explore how pregnancy altered the relationship between anti-S-RBD IgG and nAb,

177

titers were directly compared and revealed that anti-S-RBD IgG titers were higher than nAb

178

titers in both pregnant and non-pregnant women (p<0.001 Figure 3A,B). Among pregnant

179

women only, a dichotomy in nAb titers was evident. Consistent with this observation, anti-S-

180

RBD IgG titers in pregnant women with nAb titers <1:20 (i.e., no detectable nAb) were

181

significantly lower than anti-S-RBD IgG titers among pregnant women with nAb titers > 1:20

182

(i.e., detectable nAb; p<0.05; Figure 3A). To determine whether time since a SARS-CoV-2

183

positive test or time since symptom onset could predict antibody responses, we analyzed

184

responses over time. Variation in anti-S-RBD IgG or nAb responses among pregnant women

185

with non-detectable as compared with detectable nAb titers could not be explained by the length

186

of time since a positive SARS-CoV-2 positive test (Figure 3C,D). Furthermore, time since

187

symptom onset did not explain variation in anti-S-RBD IgG or nAb responses among pregnant

188

women with non-detectable as compared with detectable nAb titers (Figure 3E,F). Differences

189

in the number of days between a PCR+ test or symptom onset and sample collection also did

190

not statistically explain variation in either anti-S-RBD IgG or nAb responses between pregnant

191

and non-pregnant women (Figure 3C-F). These data suggest that, independent of time,

192

pregnancy may reduce the quality of antiviral antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

193

Antibody transfer in SARS-CoV-2 infection. To assess whether antibody transfer from mother to

194

fetus was affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels in maternal

195

and cord blood serum, FcRn expression, and anti-tetanus IgG titers were assessed in SARS-

196

CoV-2 positive and negative women. Anti-S and anti-S-RBD IgG titers did not differ between

197

maternal and cord blood serum samples (Figure 4A,B); titers of nAb in maternal serum were,

198

however, significantly greater than in cord blood serum (p < 0.05; Figure 4C). Protein

199

concentrations of placental FcRn, used as a biomarker of IgG transfer, were not affected by

200

either SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy or symptomatology (Figure 4D,E). To further

201

evaluate whether SARS-CoV-2 infection altered the transfer of other antibodies from mother to

202

fetus, maternal and cord blood serum anti-tetanus IgG titers were measured and were not

203

inhibited by SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy (Figure 4F,G). These data suggest that

204

while maternal transfer of nAb may be reduced, SARS-CoV-2 infection does not broadly impact

205

maternal transfer of humoral immunity.

206
207
208

Discussion
Our study provides preliminary evidence that pregnant women exhibit an early

209

inflammatory response and a reduced antiviral antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 as

210

compared with non-pregnant women. The inflammatory response of pregnant women who

211

experienced mild to moderate COVID-19 was characterized by greater IL-1β, but not IL-6,

212

mRNA expression as has been reported in severe male and non-pregnant female COVID-19

213

patients18,19, as well as greater IL-1β mRNA expression on the fetal side of the placenta. Current

214

studies highlight differences in clinical manifestations between SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant

215

and non-pregnant women, with some studies reporting differences in presenting symptoms,

216

such as lower incidence of fever and cough in pregnant women21,22. There is growing evidence

217

that SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women face greater risk of hospitalization, intensive care

218

unit admission, and invasive ventilation compared to non-pregnant women, but experience

219

comparable or even lower risk of mortality23–28. Studies in SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant and

220

non-pregnant women report higher frequencies of neutrophils and D-dimer concentrations and

221

lower percentages of lymphocytes, CD4+/CD8+ ratios, and IgG levels in pregnant than non-

222

pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-229–32. Thus, our study adds to the growing literature

demonstrating enhanced inflammatory responses and reduced adaptive immune responses

224

during SARS-CoV-2 infection of pregnant compared to non-pregnant women.

225

10

Epidemiological and animal model studies have established the relationship between

226

maternal and placental inflammation and neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism

227

spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, in children8. Several proinflammatory cytokines have

228

been identified as mediators of this pathway, responsible for traversing the placenta and

229

triggering neurotoxicity in the developing fetus33. Specifically, maternal IL-1 receptor blockade

230

appears to protect against fetal cortical injury in mouse models by attenuating microglial

231

activation, suggesting that IL-1β secretion and signaling play a key role in fetal cortical injury

232

and potentially long-term, adverse neurobehavioral outcomes34–36. In this study, we identified an

233

increase in IL1β mRNA expression in the fetal side of the placenta in asymptomatic patients, as

234

well as increased expression in maternal blood collected within 14 days of a positive SARS-

235

CoV-2 test. Documentation of IL-1 protein levels in cord blood and in neonates born to

236

mothers prenatally infected with SARS-CoV-2, as well as newborn testing for SARS-CoV-2 and

237

long-term neurodevelopmental follow-up of such babies, are needed to determine short- and

238

long-term effects of inflammation, infection, or both.

239

The antiviral response to SARS-CoV-2 includes development of antibodies that

240

recognize the S-RBD as well as neutralize virus 37. Detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG

241

antibodies in maternal and neonatal blood following infection has been reported38,39; how

242

symptomatology and pregnancy status, however, affect detection (qualitative) and titers

243

(quantitative) of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and nAb responses has not been previously investigated.

244

Here, we demonstrate that pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 had lower titers of anti-

245

S-RBD IgG compared to non-pregnant women. Although nAb titers were similar between

246

pregnant and non-pregnant women, pregnant women were significantly less likely to have

247

detectable nAb responses. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women who had non-

248

detectable nAb responses had significantly lower anti-S-RBD IgG titers. Reduced antiviral

249

antibody responses in pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV2 were independent of time

250

since infection. The women with low antibody titers did not present with worse symptoms or

251

experience worse disease outcomes, similar to studies in non-pregnant adults40,41. It is possible,

252

however, that the reduced antibody titers could increase the potential for reinfection following

253

pregnancy.

254

Limitations of this study include the small sample size as well as significant differences

255

in age, race, and ethnicity between SARS-CoV-2-infected pregnant and non-pregnant women.

256

These differences are attributable to our reliance on convenience sampling and are a result of

257

differences in participant recruitment, in which sample collection from pregnant women was

258

based on time of delivery, and sample collection from non-pregnant women was based on

259

symptom presentation. While there was a significant difference in age between the cohorts, all

260

women in this study were within reproductive ages12. Due to our inability to know precisely when

261

each participant was infected with SARS-CoV-2, we used the number of days between a SARS-

262

CoV-2 PCR test and blood collection as the metric to assess cytokine responses, and

263

additionally used the number of days since symptom onset to evaluate humoral responses over

264

time. These metrics may not accurately represent the time since initial infection, as symptom

265

onset is self-reported and studies have reported PCR positivity for extended periods of time past

266

the initial infection42,43.

267

Our results demonstrate potential differences in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2,

268

including inflammatory and antibody responses to the virus, between pregnant and non-

269

pregnant women. It is well-established that immune responses change dramatically during

270

pregnancy in order to accommodate the developing fetus44. Therefore, understanding the

271

impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy on the maternal immune system, and how

272

these changes alter maternal and fetal susceptibility to disease is crucial for the development of

273
