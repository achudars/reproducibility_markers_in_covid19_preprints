Abstract
Background: Public health measures, such as social distancing and closure of schools and
non-essential services, were rapidly implemented in Canada to interrupt the spread of the novel
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Objective: We sought to investigate the impact of mitigation measures during the spring wave
of COVID-19 on the incidence of other laboratory-confirmed respiratory viruses in Hamilton,
Ontario.
Methods: All nasopharyngeal swab specimens (n = 57,503) submitted for routine respiratory
virus testing at a regional laboratory serving all acute-care hospitals in Hamilton, Ontario
between January 2010 and June 2020 were reviewed. Testing for influenza A/B, respiratory
syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza I–III, adenovirus and
rhinovirus/enterovirus was done routinely using a laboratory-developed polymerase chain
reaction multiplex respiratory viral panel. A Bayesian linear regression model was used to
determine the trend of positivity rates of all influenza samples for the first 26 weeks of each year
from 2010 to 2019. The mean positivity rate of Bayesian inference was compared with the
weekly reported positivity rate of influenza samples in 2020.
Results: The positivity rate of influenza in 2020 diminished sharply following the populationwide implementation of COVID-19 interventions. Weeks 12-26 reported 0% positivity for
influenza, with the exception of 0.1% reported in week 13.

Conclusions: Public health measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic were
associated with a reduced incidence of other respiratory viruses and should be considered to
mitigate severe seasonal influenza and other respiratory virus pandemics.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to devastating global morbidity and
mortality (1). Restrictive public health measures have helped to mitigate COVID-19 transmission
(2,3), but have led to widespread disruptions to the economy (4,5), trade (6), and education (7).
Following the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11 by the World Health
Organization (8), the province of Ontario, Canada announced the closure of all schools and nonessential workplaces (9,10). Months later, public health measures, such as social distancing and
mask-wearing, continue to be in place to reduce the toll associated with the COVID-19
pandemic (11).
Public health measures have reduced the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Ontario (3). In some jurisdictions, these measures have also
been associated with a lower incidence of other respiratory virus infections (12,13). We
performed a time-series analysis, using a hierarchical regression model, to determine the
timelines and positivity rates of influenza A and B viruses from 2010 to 2019 in an urban center
in Ontario, and compare them to those of 2020 prior to and following the implementation of
COVID-19 interventions in response to initial outbreaks.

Methods
Sampling and testing
We reviewed all nasopharyngeal swab specimens (n = 57,503) submitted for routine respiratory
virus testing at a regional laboratory serving all acute-care hospitals in Hamilton, Ontario
between January 2010 and June 2020.
Testing was done using a Taqman real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
multiplex respiratory viral panel, developed by the Hamilton Regional Laboratory Medicine
Program, for influenza A/B, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza
I–III, adenovirus, and rhinovirus/enterovirus. On March 16, 2020, parainfluenza II was replaced
by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Sample RNA extraction and amplification were primarily performed
on the bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMag and QIAGEN Rotor-Gene Q, respectively, from 20102019 and primarily performed on the BD MAX System from July 2019-2020. Clinical results
were validated by experienced staff and recorded into a laboratory information system, following
standard operating procedures.
Data
A respiratory virus database with all test results and demographic information is updated weekly,
and has been in place since 2010. A 10-years datacut with basic demographic information (age,

sex, postal code, date, facility, accession number) and test results were exported from the
laboratory database on June 29, 2020. The database included only samples sent for multiplex
testing. Laboratory test results were filtered by postal code to exclude samples from persons
living outside of Hamilton, Ontario. Figure 1 shows the positivity rates of influenza A/B in the
database for different age groups.

Ontario (0 to 18 years, 19 to 49 years, 50 to 64 years and 65 years of age and older).
Ethics approval
The study was approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board (Project: 07-2923).
The study was categorized as minimal risk, defined as no potential for negative impact on the
health and safety of the participant, and waiver of individual consent for participation was
obtained.
Statistical analysis
We used a Bayesian linear regression model with uninformative prior distributions to determine
the trend of positivity rates of all influenza A/B samples for the first 26 weeks of each year from
2010-2019 (Appendix: Table A1). We then compared the mean positivity rate of Bayesian
inference with the weekly reported positivity rate of influenza samples in 2020 (Appendix: Table
A2).
The hierarchical regression model has the form
y ~ Normal(μ, σ)
μ = βTx
β = Normal(0, 100)
σ2 = InverseGamma(2.5, 25)
where y represents the positivity rate over the first 26 weeks (variable x) of each year from
2010-2019. All parameters were sampled using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations
in three independent chains. Each chain consisted of 10,000 iterations, with a burn-in period of
1,000 iterations and a thinning factor of 5. To assess convergence, we inspected the trace plots
and applied the Gelman-Rubin convergence test by computing the potential scale reduction
factors (PSRF). All PSRF values were computed to be less than 1.1 (and remained close to 1),

indicating the convergence of the model parameters to their posterior distributions. We used the
posterior distributions of the parameters (β1, β2, σ) from our Bayesian analysis to derive mean
estimates and credible intervals (Appendix: Table A3) by employing the method of Highest
Posterior Density (14).

Results
A description of individuals included in our study is provided in Table 1. A total of 48,459
patients were tested for respiratory viruses in Hamilton, Ontario in 2010-2019, of which 49.3% (n
= 23,898) were male and 30.6% (n = 14,818) were children under 18 years of age. The bimodal
age distribution had a median age of adults of 72.4 years (IQR: 59.4 - 83.5) and 1.5 years
among children (IQR: 0.4 - 4.4). A median of 4,626 (IQR: 3,376 - 5,936) samples were tested
each year, with a mean influenza positivity rate of 9.6% (SD: 2.9%). Mean percent positivity was
also calculated for respiratory syncytial virus (6.9%, SD: 1.5%), metapneumovirus (2.8%, SD:
0.4%), parainfluenza (3.2%, SD: 0.6%), adenovirus (1.0%, SD: 0.6%), and
rhinovirus/enterovirus (8.0%, SD: 5.5%). 9,044 patients were tested for respiratory viruses in
2020, of which 2.5% were positive for influenza. The percent positivity of other respiratory
viruses ranged from 0.1% (parainfluenza) to 0.9% (respiratory syncytial virus and
rhinovirus/enterovirus).

the Bayesian linear regression model using positivity rates reported for 2010-2019 (black curve).
The positivity rate of influenza in 2020 (red curve) was highest at 17.7% in week 1, and dropped
below the 95% CrI for the preceding 10 years after the first week, with an ensuing declining
trend (Figure 2; Appendix: Table A2). Following the implementation of COVID-19 interventions
during week 12 (from March 12, 2020; grey bar in Figure 2), the positivity rate of influenza
diminished sharply and remained at 0% for weeks 12-26, with the exception of 0.1% reported in
week 13.

Discussion
Public health measures have been used to interrupt spread of influenza during pandemics, with
effect. For example, school closures and social distancing during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in
Mexico resulted in a 27-29% reduction in influenza transmission during the spring wave (15).
During the 1957-1958 influenza pandemic, school closures contributed to reducing the attack
rate by over 90% (16). Similarly, following the implementation of COVID-19 mitigation measures,
the influenza positivity rate was suppressed in the United States (12,13). Our results suggest
that COVID-19 public health measures may have contributed to a substantial disruption of the
spread of influenza in Hamilton, Ontario.
The 2020 influenza season was observed to be relatively mild in Hamilton, Ontario, as
compared to previous seasons (Appendix: Table A1, A2). However, the lower positivity rate
observed in our analysis (Figure 2), may be attributed to several factors including voluntary
precautions taken by individuals as a result of initial news reporting of the spread of COVID-19
in China and internationally, normal seasonal variation, or due to changes in sampling behaviour
and diagnostic testing. For the 2010-2019 winter influenza season, the median influenza
positivity rate reached 0% by week 23. In 2020, however, after the implementation of COVID-19
mitigation measures, percent positivity for influenza dropped precipitously to 0% in week 12. The
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported similar findings through their weekly
influenza surveillance system, in which the percent positivity for influenza decreased from 7.5%
in week 12 to 1.0% in week 14. This abrupt change, without another explanation, suggests that
COVID-19 mitigation measures may have reduced the spread of laboratory-confirmed influenza
in the United States (12,13). Moreover, the positivity rates for respiratory syncytial virus,
metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, adenovirus, and rhinovirus/enterovirus were reported to be
0% by week 14 of 2020 (Appendix: Table A2), suggesting that public health measures could
have also suppressed the transmission of other respiratory viruses.
Understanding the effect of COVID-19 interventions on other communicable diseases requires
further study. However, a number of explicators may be considered to describe the rapid
interruption in transmission chains of influenza compared to COVID-19 with the pressure
exerted by public health measures. First, there is relatively strong cross-immunity for influenza
virus strains during seasonal epidemics, in addition to population immunity conferred by
vaccination (17,18). In contrast, the population was naive to SARS-CoV-2, and still remains
largely susceptible in the absence of vaccination. Furthermore, there are also major differences
in the epidemiological characteristics between influenza and COVID-19 that influence the
outcomes of interventions (19). For example, the transmissibility of influenza has been
estimated in the range 1.2-1.8 (20), which is lower than the initial estimates greater than 2 for
COVID-19 in most settings (21,22). The average incubation period of 5.2 days for COVID-19
(21) is significantly longer than the same period for influenza A, which is estimated to be 1.4
days (23). Moreover, the pre-symptomatic period is longer and more infectious in COVID-19
than in influenza (24,25). Future studies will need to account for these factors when evaluating
the effect of interventions against emerging infectious diseases.

The findings of our study should be interpreted in the context of study limitations. First,
respiratory samples were not collected systematically, but rather they were obtained as part of
routine clinical care. As such, the samples may not fully represent the prevalence of respiratory
viruses in the region. It is also possible that clinicians may not have strictly followed hospital
infection control policy and failed to sample patients who otherwise would have been eligible.
Furthermore, sampling behaviour may have changed during the early stage of COVID-19
spread in Canada. However, these factors are unlikely to change our conclusions due to the
near-elimination of the absolute number of laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus cases, despite
the large increase in testing which accompanied concern for COVID-19 in the community.
Our findings suggest that efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic may have had additional
benefits in suppressing the transmission of other respiratory viruses in Hamilton, Ontario.
Mitigation strategies, such as social distancing, mask-wearing, and school closures could play
an important role in combating future seasonal respiratory viruses and emerging infectious
diseases with pandemic potential.
