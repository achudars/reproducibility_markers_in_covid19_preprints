ABSTRACT.
In late December 2019, a new disease reported at the time by an unknown pathogen was reported,
which was later found to be a new variant of coronavirus, now called SARS-CoV2. This new disease
had a very rapid global spread, causing multiple deaths in a short time, and which led to putting the
entire world on health alert. In patients who have this disease, they present bilateral opacities in
frosted multilobar glass with peripheral distribution. Some authors have suggested the use of
ultrasound at the point of care for its early recognition.
In this study, we evaluated the findings of lung ultrasound in 25 patients admitted to the General
Hospital Dr. Enrique Cabrera, Mexico, with a diagnosis confirmed by RT-PCR of SARS CoV2. This
small retrospective study suggests that artifacts like glass rockets with or without the Birolleau variant
(White lung), confluent B-lines, thick irregular pleural lines, and variable size (subpleural)
consolidations are typical findings of lung ultrasound in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The
presence of these findings is useful when evaluating patients with suspected COVID-19. In resourcelimited and austere settings where chest radiography, CT, and RT-PCR are not available or the
response time is long, lung ultrasound performed by trained personnel can be an aid in the diagnosis
of COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION.
On December 31, 2019, the WHO was alerted to the appearance of unknown cause pneumonia in
Wuhan, China. The etiologic agent was identified on January 7, 2020, as the novel-Coronavirus
2019, which was later renamed as Coronavirus 2- Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since its identification, the number of patients with the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
continues to increase rapidly in Mexico and abroad1. On day 06/11/20 (GMT -07: 00h) have been
reported globally 7,273,958 cases and 413,372 deaths 2, while in Mexico have been reported
129,184cases and 15,357 deaths 3.
The COVID-19 pandemic is seriously affecting healthcare in many regions of the world. This new
species of coronavirus has a specific tropism for the lower respiratory tract but causes severe
pneumonia in a low percentage of patients. However, the rapid spread of this severe infection during
this pandemic is forcing large numbers of patients to be hospitalized. According to a Chinese cohort
study, approximately 14% of COVID-19 patients developed a severe disease and 5% developed
critical illness 4. Among hospitalized patients, approximately 20-42% of patients developed acute
respiratory distress syndrome 5, According to the report data of the Mexican Ministry of Health, they
are very similar in our country 3.
It is important to diagnose and treat pneumonia in patients with COVID-19. For the diagnosis,
computed tomography (CT) of the chest is more sensitive than the reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the diagnosis of COVID-19, and its findings also correlate with
progression. and recovery from illness 6–8.
On CT, patients generally have bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity (GGO) with a peripheral or
posterobasal distribution, and CT lesions evolve with the greatest severity of visible radiological
findings around day 10 of symptom onset 9. Despite its usefulness, CT is not available in many
environments with limited resources. Additionally, the disinfection of the CT machine after use by a

patient with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection will result in delayed care for other patients requiring
CT examination. It is in this operational context that lung ultrasound was proposed to evaluate
patients with probable COVID-19 pneumonia10–12.
COVID-19 pneumonia has peculiar characteristics and can be studied by lung ultrasound (LUS) in
the early approach to suspicious patients13. There is a preliminary experience in the use of
pulmonary ultrasound in the initial diagnosis of atypical pneumonia and this tool has been used in the
diagnosis of influenza virus infection during its previous epidemic outbreaks, and now during the
COVID-19 pandemic, its use has resurfaced14,15. Ultrasound signs are not specific when
considered in isolation, but observing some aspects of vertical artifacts can improve the diagnostic
power of ultrasound examination. Furthermore, the combination of ultrasound signs in the patterns
described and their correlation with laboratory tests on different phenotypes of the disease can allow
a reliable characterization and be helpful for triage and patient admission16.

METHODS
This study was a retrospective, observational study.
Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test for nasopharyngeal exudate
were included and evaluated by lung ultrasound in different areas of Hospital General Enrique
Cabrera from April to May 2020.
For several days, an investigator (L.P.) performed serial lung ultrasound on 21 patients diagnosed
with SARS CoV2 infection. The stored ultrasound images were carefully reviewed by two researchers
(L.P. and I.I.). The records of the electronic file were reviewed to determine demographics,
comorbidities, paraclinical, and radiographic findings. Pulmonary ultrasound studies were performed
with a Mindray M5 ultrasound equipped with a 2.5-6 MHz multi-frequency convex transducer,
subsequently, an Esaote Mylab 6 ultrasound with a high resolution multifrequency convex transducer

was used. Ultrasound studies were performed along the clavicular midline in the bilateral anterior
chest wall and scapular line, and Interscapular regions in the posterior chest wall at the patient's
bedside by an experienced operator (LP) with the patients in the supine position (and in the lateral
position if the patient's conditions allowed it), 6 regions in each hemithorax were analyzed. The
transducer was covered with a transparent probe cover, and the transducer and portable ultrasound
device were cleaned with disinfecting wipes after each use, following a pre-established protocol.
We use standard lung ultrasound terminology, established by Professor Lichtenstein since 1989 at
his training center (CEURF)17.

RESULTS.
A total of 21 patients were identified, of whom 81% were men, the average age was 48.7 years (SD ±
13.43), clinical and demographic features are described in Table 1 and Table 2.
Likewise, all the included patients underwent radiological studies (20 Chest X-Ray and 1 thorax CT )
in 66% of the patients we found the ground glass pattern, and in 85% of the patients, mixed density
opacification in the peripheral lung. The rest of the radiological findings are collected in table 3.
Abnormal findings were found on lung ultrasound in all patients (Table 4). All patients had
characteristic glass rockets (five B-lines or more: Figure 1, Supplementary Videos 1 and 2), 14
patients presented the Birolleau variant (Figure 2, video 3 and 4), which has also been named as
white lung, the waterfall sign, or light beam in the literature. This phenomenon is an extreme variant
of ground glass where all of Merlin's space (the space between the pleural line, the shadows of the
ribs, and the lower edge of the screen) is hyperechoic 12. In 10 patients we found septal rockets
(three or four B-lines between two ribs). All the studied patients presented confluent B-lines (Figure 3,
Video 5), and thickened and irregular pleural lines were observed in 20 patients, while variable size
(subpleural) consolidations ( Figure 4) were observed in 19 of them (There are still supporters of the

label subpleural consolidations. Detecting consolidations using ultrasound is possible only if they are
subpleural. The term subpleural is therefore redundant, so we use the term in parentheses). Large
consolidation was only found in one patient, and this patient had remained for more than a week with
mechanical ventilation. No images of pleural effusion were found in any of the studied patients.
In one patient, a chest CT scan was found in which mixed-density opacifications were reported in the
pulmonary periphery, which on lung ultrasound were consistent with the appearance of the Birolleau
variant.

DISCUSSION
In our experience at the “Enrique Cabrera” General Hospital, we found that the vertical artifacts like
septal rockets, glass rockets, or the Birolleau variant were visible in all patients with SARS-CoV-2
infection admitted to the different areas of the Hospital. These three ultrasound patterns are
consistent with the areas of ground-glass opacity observed on CT, and in turn, are related to the
presence of high-grade interstitial syndrome17, and although glass rockets and the Birolleau variant
have also been observed in patients with pulmonary edema of cardiogenic origin, none of the
patients studied was clinically diagnosed with decompensated congestive heart failure.
All the patients included in our study presented findings of pleural line thickening and irregularities,
the addition of B lines and findings of pleural thickening suggest the appearance of a pleural
inflammatory process and helps us to distinguish from those images that can occur in patients. with
cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
Another important finding in the studied patients was the observation of variable size, usually small
(subpleural) consolidations in 19 of them. In previous studies carried out in patients with Influenza
pneumonia, the appearance of these images was reported, and the association between (subpleural)
consolidations and confluent B-lines aided in distinguishing viral pneumonia from bacterial

pneumonia 14,18.
Studies of ultrasound findings in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia are limited, but our findings
are consistent with initial reports of the presence of "diffuse B-line pattern", irregular and thickened
pleural lines, confluent B-lines, and variable size (subpleural) consolidation. In our study, large
consolidation was only observed in one patient, but the presence of large consolidation probably
correlates with disease progression based on previous studies of CT findings in patients with COVID19.
Since most patients with COVID-19 develop ground glass patterns of peripheral distribution that
progress over time, lung ultrasound can probably detect most symptomatic patients with COVID-19
who require hospitalization. Glass rockets, confluent B-lines, thickened irregular pleural lines, and
variable size (subpleural) consolidations are likely not specific to COVID-19 and can be seen in other
conditions, such as other viral pneumonia and ARDS. However, these findings, particularly when
combined and analyzed in context may be a decisive diagnostic aid during the COVID-19 pandemic
when the pretest probability is high. Precisely, the high sensitivity of LUS for the detection of
pulmonary involvement allows it to be a reliable monitoring tool for the assessment of patients with
COVID-19.
Lung ultrasound has multiple advantages over chest X-Ray and chest CT in the diagnosis and
treatment of patients with COVID-19. Lung ultrasound can be reasonably done at the patient's
bedside without exposing patients to radiation. Also, lung ultrasound is more sensitive than chest
radiography in diagnosing alveolar-interstitial syndrome19. Lung ultrasound can detect lung lesions
earlier than chest radiography when the lesions are adjacent to the pleura. Besides, the use of lung
ultrasound in place of chest x-ray and chest computed tomography can reduce exposure of SARSCoV-2 to healthcare workers, such as transportation personnel and radiological technicians, which
can also help to mitigate the shortage of personal protective equipment experienced in many health

Our study has some limitations. The main one is a retrospective study with a limited number of
patients, as well as the relative scarcity of tomographic studies at the beginning of the epidemic in our
institution. Future studies with a larger number of patients are needed to better assess the findings of
lung ultrasound in COVID-19 patients and to evaluate the utility of lung ultrasound in treating patients
with COVID-19. A more detailed evaluation with a previously validated scoring system, such as that
used in intensive care for ARDS21,22, can provide prognostic information in patients admitted with
COVID-19. Our examinations were carried out by a single expert sonographer (L.P.); therefore, these
findings can be difficult for novice sonographers. It is also noteworthy that this study was conducted
in patients who required admission to the internal medicine service. More studies are needed to
characterize the sonographic findings of COVID-19 patients in other clinical settings.

CONCLUSION.
This small retrospective study suggests that artifacts like glass rockets with or without the Birolleau
variant (White lung), confluent B-lines, thick irregular pleural lines, and variable size (subpleural)
consolidations are typical findings of lung ultrasound in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The
presence of these findings is useful when evaluating patients with suspected COVID-19. In resourcelimited and austere settings where chest radiography, CT, and RT-PCR are not available or the
response time is long, lung ultrasound performed by trained personnel can be an aid in the diagnosis
of COVID-19.
