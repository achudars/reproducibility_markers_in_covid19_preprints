Abstract
Introduction: More than 93,000 cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been reported
worldwide. We describe the epidemiology, clinical course, and virologic characteristics of the
first 12 U.S. patients with COVID-19.
Methods: We collected demographic, exposure, and clinical information from 12 patients
confirmed by CDC during January 20–February 5, 2020 to have COVID-19. Respiratory, stool,
serum, and urine specimens were submitted for SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR testing, virus culture,
and whole genome sequencing.
Results: Among the 12 patients, median age was 53 years (range: 21–68); 8 were male, 10 had
traveled to China, and two were contacts of patients in this series. Commonly reported signs and
symptoms at illness onset were fever (n=7) and cough (n=8). Seven patients were hospitalized
with radiographic evidence of pneumonia and demonstrated clinical or laboratory signs of
worsening during the second week of illness. Three were treated with the investigational antiviral
remdesivir. All patients had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in respiratory specimens, typically for
2–3 weeks after illness onset, with lowest rRT-PCR Ct values often detected in the first week.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected after reported symptom resolution in seven patients. SARSCoV-2 was cultured from respiratory specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in stool
from 7/10 patients.
Conclusions: In 12 patients with mild to moderately severe illness, SARS-CoV-2 RNA and
viable virus were detected early, and prolonged RNA detection suggests the window for diagnosis is
long. Hospitalized patients showed signs of worsening in the second week after illness onset.

INTRODUCTION
In December 2019, an outbreak of the novel disease COVID-19 caused by the newly identified severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan City, Hubei province,
China. As of March 4, 2020, more than 93,000 COVID-19 cases have been reported in 73 countries,1 and
80 confirmed and presumptive patients with COVID-19 have been identified in the United States;2 one
has been previously described in detail.3
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, virus culture, and the relationship to the clinical course of COVID-19 are
not fully understood. We report the epidemiology, clinical course, clinical management, and virologic
characteristics of the first 12 patients with COVID-19 diagnosed in the United States.
METHODS
Case identification and confirmation
Local health departments in consultation with clinicians identified patients under investigation (PUI) for
COVID-19 beginning January 17, 2020. PUI testing criteria changed during this period but included the
presence of fever and/or lower respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough or shortness of breath) and at least one
epidemiologic risk factor in the two weeks before symptom onset. During January 17–31, epidemiologic
risk factors were history of travel from Wuhan City, close contact with an ill PUI, or close contact with a
patient with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.4,5 Beginning February 1, epidemiologic risk factors
changed to close contact with a patient with confirmed COVID-19 or history of travel from mainland
China.6 During both time periods, close contact was defined as being within 6 feet for a prolonged period
of time7 or contact with respiratory secretions.8 Specimens from PUIs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Upper respiratory tract specimens (nasopharyngeal [NP], oropharyngeal [OP]) and available lower
respiratory tract specimens (sputum) were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time
reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).3 A case of COVID-19 was defined as
identification of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in ≥1 specimen from a patient. We included patients
with COVID-19 who were confirmed by CDC during January 20–February 5, 2020.
Data and follow-up specimen collection
Patients with COVID-19 were interviewed by public health officials to collect information on
demographics, exposures, travel history, and symptoms, including signs or symptoms before presentation.
For all twelve patients, available medical records were reviewed. For hospitalized patients, clinicians
systematically abstracted clinical data from the medical record.
Illness day 1 was defined as the first day of reported COVID-19 signs and symptoms; collection date of
the first SARS-CoV-2-positive specimen was used for one patient with no clear symptom onset date.
When symptoms at onset or onset dates in the medical record differed from those reported from the public
health interview, the latter were used. Results for virologic tests were reported relative to illness day 1.
Duration of potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was defined as dates of travel to China or dates of first to
last exposure to a U.S. patient with COVID-19. Fever was defined as subjective fever or temperature
≥100.4 °F.
We requested collection of NP swabs, OP swabs, sputum (if available), serum, urine, and stool from each
patient initially for every 2–3 days for the first 17 days of illness for SARS-CoV-2 virologic testing.9

Further specimens were collected for testing if the patient continued to test positive for SARS-CoV-2
beyond day 17.
CDC’s Human Research Protection Office determined this work was exempt from human subjects’
research regulations as it involved identification, control, or prevention of disease in response to an
immediate public health threat. Forms used in this response were approved under OMB, number 09201011. Data were analyzed and visualized using Excel, SAS 9.4, R 3.6.2, and Python 3.7.3.10–13
Laboratory Methods
Specimens were evaluated using SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, virus culture, whole genome sequencing,
and phylogenetic analysis. Virus culture was attempted from early SARS-CoV-2-positive respiratory
specimens (NP swabs, OP swabs, and sputum) from 9 patients. Further virus culture is ongoing. Detailed
methods are included in the Appendix.

RESULTS
Epidemiologic and clinical characteristics
Twelve patients with confirmed COVID-19 were identified in six states. Five patients received only
outpatient care and were isolated at home (Patients 1–5), and seven were hospitalized (Patients 6–12)
(Figure 1). Median patient age was 53 years (range: 21–68); eight patients were male (Table 1). Four of
five patients with ≥1 underlying medical conditions were hospitalized (Tables 1 and 2).
Dates of illness onset ranged from January 14 through 29. Ten patients traveled to mainland China in the
two weeks before illness onset, including nine to Wuhan City. Two patients’ only reported exposure was
close contact with a previously identified U.S. patient with COVID-19. Among all patients, the duration
of potential exposure ranged from 5 days to over 1 month; the time between last date of possible exposure
and illness onset ranged from 0–5 days.
The most commonly reported signs or symptoms at illness onset were cough (n=8) and subjective or
measured fever (n=7) (Table 1). Two patients reported neither fever nor cough at onset, though they did
develop them subsequently: one reported diarrhea as the initial symptom (one day before fever and
cough), and the other reported sore throat.
Over the course of illness, patients reported cough (n=12), subjective or measured fever (n=9), diarrhea
(n=3), and vomiting (n=2). Three patients who did not report fever were never hospitalized and remained
on home isolation. Of these, one patient reported only cough and rhinorrhea; one patient reported only
cough which began before travel to China and did not change from the initial onset until resolution; and
one patient reported cough, chills, fatigue, headache, and nausea.
Clinical course of hospitalized patients
The clinical course for each hospitalized patient is described in the Appendix. The median duration of
fever was 9 days (range: 2–11). Peak body temperature during hospitalization occurred at a median of
illness day 9 (range: 4–10) (Figure 2). All hospitalized patients had oxygen saturation <94% on room air
at some point during their illness, with the oxygen saturation nadir (range: 86–93%) occurring at a median
of illness day 12 (range: 4–23) (Figure 2). Five patients reported difficulty breathing, and four received
supplemental oxygen (Table 2; Figure 1). Patient 9 required high-flow nasal cannula oxygen
supplementation and intensive care monitoring.

Two patients received a short course (≤3 days) of corticosteroids. Three, including one who also received
corticosteroids, received the investigational antiviral remdesivir (Gilead Sciences, Foster City, California)
under expanded access (compassionate use) for a duration of 4–10 days. Following remdesivir initiation,
all had transient gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, gastroparesis, or rectal bleeding.
No other post-remdesivir symptoms were observed. Patient 9 reported loose stool and rectal bleeding and
had traveled in Mexico before illness onset; stool later tested positive for Giardia and Clostridiodes
difficile. Remdesivir was discontinued after improvement in each patient’s respiratory symptoms.
Blood cultures were negative in 6/6 hospitalized patients tested, including those obtained from four
patients treated empirically for bacterial pneumonia. Molecular testing for influenza A and B on
respiratory specimens was negative, and multi-pathogen respiratory PCR panels were negative for all
targets in all hospitalized patients (Table 2).
Laboratory and radiographic findings among hospitalized patients
Six of seven hospitalized patients had leukopenia (<4000 cells/µl), and the white blood cell count nadir
occurred at a median of illness day 9 (range: 4–15) (Figure 1). Procalcitonin levels were <0.15 ng/ml in
five of six patients who had levels checked. Aminotransferase levels were elevated in all hospitalized
patients: AST levels peaked (median peak value 129 U/L, range 46–190 U/L) at a median of illness day
13 (range 7–19) and ALT levels peaked (median peak value 136 U/L, range 66–389 U/L) at a median of
illness day 14 (range: 6–23). Three of seven hospitalized patients had mild elevations in alkaline
phosphatase levels >115 U/L (maximum value 163 U/L). Elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels >600
U/L, coinciding with clinical deterioration, were observed in two patients tested. No major elevations in
serum total bilirubin (7 patients tested) or prolongations in prothrombin time (4 patients tested) were
identified. Among the three remdesivir recipients, aminotransferase elevation developed in Patient 6 one
day after starting remdesivir and in Patient 8 four days after starting remdesivir. Patient 9 had
aminotransferase elevation at illness days 6–7 before starting remdesivir; aminotransferase levels started
to decrease but increased again five days after starting remdesivir.
Unilateral or bilateral pulmonary opacities were seen on chest imaging at some point for all seven
hospitalized patients (Table 2). Four hospitalized patients did not have any abnormalities identified on
initial chest radiograph (illness day range: 4–9). Patient 7 had an abnormal chest computed tomography
scan on the day of the normal chest radiograph (day 7).
Virologic testing
Initial SARS-CoV-2 testing
All 12 patients had respiratory specimens collected between illness days 1–9 (median, day 4), and all
tested positive in ≥2 specimen types (Figure 3). Among initial diagnostic specimens, SARS-CoV-2 RNA
was detected in OP (11/11 patients), NP (10/12 patients), and sputum (4/4 patients). Viable SARS-CoV-2
virus was cultured from 5/6 initial NP specimens, 4/7 initial OP specimens, 3/3 initial sputum specimens,
and 1/1 additional sputum specimen collected 3 days after the initial specimens (Figure 3). Virus was
cultured from two patients who were not hospitalized (Figure 3).
Serial SARS-CoV-2 testing
As of February 22, 398 specimens were collected and tested from the 12 patients throughout the course of
illness. All 12 patients had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in at least one NP swab, 11/12 in an OP swab,
6/6 in sputum, 1/12 in serum, 7/10 in stool, and 0/10 in urine (Figure 3). Among 98 pairs of simultaneous
NP and OP specimens, 58 (59%) had concordant results. Among 27 discordant pairs with one positive

specimen, the NP specimen was positive in 70%; the remaining 13 discordant pairs had one negative and
one inconclusive specimen. Two patients provided sputum specimens when NP and/or OP specimens
tested negative, and sputum continued to be positive in both patients. In Patient 7, viral RNA was
detected in sputum 17 days after the last positive OP specimen and ≥2 weeks after reported symptom
resolution. In seven patients who had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in stool, most detections occurred
when viral RNA was still detectable in the respiratory tract. Among three patients who reported diarrhea,
all had viral RNA detected in stool.
Mean Ct values in positive specimens were 17.0–39.0 for NP, 22.1–39.7 for OP, and 24.1–39.4 for stool.
Ct values were lower in the first week of illness than the second in most patients (Figure S1); in some
patients, low Ct values continued into the 2nd and 3rd week of illness. There was no apparent relationship
between Ct values in the upper respiratory tract and disease progression. SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR results
turned positive in serum of Patient 9 in the second week of illness at the time of rapid clinical
deterioration.
Serial testing to determine duration of RNA detection and viral shedding is ongoing. As of February 22,
SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected at a maximum of day 26 in NP specimens, day 26 in OP, day 29 in
sputum, and day 25 in stool (Figure 3). The duration of viral RNA detection did not differ by
hospitalization status or supplemental oxygen requirement.
Outcomes
As of February 22, all patients reported symptom resolution (Figure 1). Eleven patients reported cough,
(often intermittent) as the last symptom. Median symptom duration was 14 days (range: 6–20). SARSCoV-2 RNA was detected after reported symptom resolution in 7/11 patients, including in NP (n=6), OP
(n=2), sputum (n=1), and stool (n=3) specimens. As of February 22, one patient remained hospitalized,
and five patients remained on home isolation. Home isolation was discontinued for 6 patients per CDC
criteria;14 the last respiratory specimens with a positive or inconclusive test result were collected from
these patients on days 12–29.
Genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis
Complete genome sequences were generated from respiratory specimens from all 12 patients. The
sequences had >99% nucleotide identity to 85 reference sequences of SARS-CoV-2 genomes;
phylogenetic tree analysis identified a few distinct subgroups (Figure S2) which were not divergent from
each other, indicating that the outbreak may still be in an early stage.
DISCUSSION
We describe the first 12 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the United States, including clinical course
of the first 7 hospitalized patients. Nine patients had traveled to Wuhan City, the epicenter of the
outbreak, one had traveled to China but not to Hubei Province, and two had close contact with a patient
with confirmed COVID-19 in the United States, representing domestic human-to-human transmission.
Illness ranged from mild to moderately severe, and hospitalized patients showed signs of clinical
worsening in the second week. All patients recovered or are improving, and three patients tolerated
treatment with the investigational antiviral remdesivir. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in upper and
lower respiratory specimens, stool, and serum. The highest viral RNA levels were detected in upper
respiratory tract specimens, typically during the first week of illness. SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from the
initial respiratory specimens of mild and moderately ill patients. Viral RNA was still detected after
reported symptom resolution for seven patients. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing and phylogenetic

analysis from these 12 patients’ respiratory tract specimens support a single recent zoonotic transmission
event in Wuhan City and subsequent human-to-human transmission.
Overall, these patients had milder disease than those in initial reports from China describing higher rates
of complications and death.15–18 Initial case identification in China focused on hospitalized patients with
pneumonia, but recent reports have described a milder clinical course, consistent with our findings.19–23
Among hospitalized patients in this report, the second week of illness was characterized by clinical or
laboratory signs of worsening such as hypoxemia, increase in fever, or elevation of aminotransferases.
Although some patients received empiric antibiotic treatment for possible secondary bacterial pneumonia,
no definitive evidence of bacterial co-infection was found. Worsening in the second week of illness is
consistent with previous reports15,17 and highlights the importance of close monitoring beyond the first
week of illness, even in patients with mild illness or no initial radiographic abnormalities.
Patient 9, the most severely ill among this series, experienced sudden clinical deterioration late in the
second week of illness. This was the only patient with SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in serum, and
detection in serum was temporally related to clinical deterioration. Similar observations have been
described previously.24,25 Increased proinflammatory cytokines have been observed in patients with
COVID-19,17 and it is possible that cytokine dysregulation and endothelial dysfunction contribute to both
clinical worsening and SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in serum.
Characterizing SARS-CoV-2 shedding is important to understand transmission and guide prevention
strategies. We detected viral RNA and cultured virus from upper respiratory specimens, even from
patients with lower respiratory tract illness. In general, Ct values in upper respiratory tract specimens
were lowest during the first week of illness (suggesting high RNA counts), consistent with previous
reports.25–27 SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in respiratory tract specimens for 2–3 weeks in most
patients and for up to 29 days as of February 22. In two patients with a productive cough, viral RNA was
detected in sputum after RNA was no longer detectable in NP or OP specimens. SARS-CoV-2 RNA
levels and duration of RNA detection did not appear to vary by illness severity, and several patients had
viral RNA detected in respiratory specimens after reported symptom resolution.
We detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool of multiple patients; testing continues to assess if this represents
viable virus. SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from one patient’s stool in China28 but the implications for
transmission are unclear. We detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the serum of one hospitalized patient but did
not detect RNA in urine. More data are needed to better understand how duration of RNA detection, RNA
levels, and viable virus are related to symptom progression, illness severity, and transmission.
Three hospitalized patients received the investigational antiviral remdesivir under expanded access
(compassionate use) at the time of clinical worsening based upon a decision by each patient’s clinician.
Remdesivir inhibits viral replication through premature termination of RNA transcription.29,30 In vitro
studies have demonstrated that remdesivir inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in non-human cells.31
Because remdesivir use was not given as part of a randomized controlled trial, we are unable to assess its
effectiveness or safety. Randomized controlled trials of remdesivir are underway.32–34 Two hospitalized
patients received corticosteroids. WHO interim guidance for clinical management of severe acute
respiratory infection with suspected COVID-19 advises against use of corticosteroids unless indicated for
another reason.35
Several limitations should be considered when interpreting our findings. Our sample of patients is small.
Information collected from patient interviews may have been subject to response bias. The threshold for
admitting patients and for monitoring in the hospital was likely lower than for other respiratory infections
because of uncertainty about the clinical course of COVID-19. Dates of illness resolution may be

imprecise due to non-specific lingering symptoms or symptoms from chronic or unrelated conditions.
Clinical laboratory tests and radiographic studies were ordered as a part of routine patient care and were
not collected systematically. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection does not necessarily reflect the presence of
infectious virus, and rRT-PCR Ct values may have varied due to specimen collection or handling.
Specimen collection is ongoing to inform both clinical management and infection prevention and control
practices, and findings will be updated as more information becomes available.
Conclusions
Characterization of the first 12 patients with COVID-19 identified in the United States, including 7
hospitalized patients, provides key insight into the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and natural
history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These patients experienced mild to moderately severe illness.
Clinicians should anticipate that some patients may worsen in the second week of illness. Early and
prolonged detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA suggest the window for diagnosis of COVID-19 is long.
Although duration of infectiousness is unclear, our early data show viable virus can be cultured readily
from upper respiratory tract specimens soon after illness onset. Further investigations are needed to
understand clinical course, immunologic response, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, virus culture, and
transmission, to inform clinical management and public health strategies to prevent disease spread.

among the first 12 patients with COVID-19 in the United States, January–February 2020

Figure 1 legend: Patients 1 – 5 were not hospitalized and Patients 6 – 12 were hospitalized. Days are sequential from day of symptom onset (Day
1). Light blue bars indicate time patients were under home isolation. Yellow bars indicate duration of hospitalization. Dark blue bars indicate
duration of supplemental oxygen administration in hospital. The orange dashed bar indicates duration of intensive care-level monitoring for
Patient 9. The black “+” indicates collection date of the earliest sample that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR. The black asterisk
indicates collection date of the latest sample to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR. The orange diamond indicates date of last report of
COVID-19-related symptoms. The black square indicates the last day of isolation precautions; patients with no black square were still under
isolation precautions as of February 22. The last date of specimen collection was February 21, and the last date of testing was February 22.
Patient 1 reported a cough with initial onset in mid-December before the patient traveled to China. The patient reported no change in the cough
17

from the initial onset until reported resolution on day 18. Because onset date was difficult to determine for this patient, we have used date of
detection as Day 1 to assess viral RNA detection.

Figure 3 Legend: Specimen types tested include nasopharyngeal (NP) swab, oropharyngeal (OP) swab, sputum, serum, stool, and urine. Day of
illness is the number of days from the date of symptom onset (day 1) until the date of specimen collection. Virus culture was attempted on selected
respiratory specimens collected early in the course of illness. rRT-PCR results were reported as positive (all three targets positive), negative (all
three targets negative), or inconclusive (only one or two positive targets). Red squares surrounding black-filled circles indicate rRT-PCR-positive
specimens from which virus culture was successful. Gray squares surrounding black-filled circles indicate rRT-PCR-positive specimens from
which virus culture was unsuccessful. Black-filled circles indicate rRT-PCR-positive specimens. Black-outlined circles indicate rRT-PCRnegative specimens. Gray-filled circles indicate specimens with inconclusive rRT-PCR results. The gray vertical bar indicates the date home
isolation was discontinued. An asterisk indicates patients who required supplemental oxygen.
