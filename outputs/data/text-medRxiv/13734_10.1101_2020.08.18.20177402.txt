Abstract
Background
The efficacy of convalescent plasma (CP) for the treatment of COVID-19 remains unclear.
Methods
A matched cohort analysis of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. The impact of CP treatment on
all cause in-hospital mortality was evaluated using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards
models, and the impact of CP treatment on the time to hospital discharge was assessed using a stratified
log-rank analysis.
Results
64 patients who received CP a median of 7 days after symptom onset were compared to a matched
control group of 177 patients. Overall in-hospital mortality was 14.9%. There was no significant
difference in the risk of in-hospital mortality between the two groups (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.93,
95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39 – 2.20). There was also no significant difference in the overall rate of
hospital discharge (rate ratio [RR} 1.28, 95% CI 0.91 – 1.81), but a subgroup analysis of patients 65-yearsold or greater who received CP demonstrated a significantly increased hospital discharge rate among
these patients (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.03 – 3.36). There was a greater than expected frequency of transfusion
reactions in the CP group (2.8% reaction rate observed per unit transfused).
Conclusions
The use of CP in this study was a safe treatment for COVID-19. There was no overall significant reduction
of in-hospital mortality or increased rate of hospital discharge associated with the use of CP in this
study, although there was a signal for improved outcomes among the elderly. Further adequately
powered randomized studies should target this subgroup when assessing the efficacy CP treatment.

Introduction
The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a global
pandemic with millions of infections reported across over 200 countries less than 6 months after the
first case was reported [1-3]. A number of therapeutic agents are being evaluated, some of which are
already in clinical use despite varying levels of evidence to support their efficacy [4]. One widely used
agent is convalescent plasma (CP), the transfusion of plasma collected from individuals who have
recovered from COVID-19 to currently infected patients.
In this context, CP is given with the hope of providing some degree of passive humoral immunity
to the recipient via the transfer of antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2 [5]. This approach has been
used for centuries to treat infections, and more recent experiences with CP for other emerging viral
infections suggest that CP may be an effective therapy for SARS-CoV-2 [6,7].
The evidence describing the efficacy of CP for patients with COVID-19 remains unclear. Early
clinical reports from China on the use of CP for COVID-19 were encouraging [8-11], while another report
suggests limited efficacy when used late in the course of disease [12]. Multiple randomized clinical trials
are ongoing [13]. A report of early safety data from 20,000 patients given CP through a large expanded
access protocol is reassuring [14].
This study describes the clinical outcomes of a cohort of hospitalized patients with severe
COVID-19 who received CP. Notably, the study is one of the first to analyze the clinical outcomes of a
large group of patients who received CP in comparison to a closely matched group receiving standard of
care treatment.

Methods
Study setting and data collection
For this study we utilized data from adult patients admitted to three hospitals within the Lifespan health
system, Rhode Island Hospital and The Miriam Hospital, both in Providence, Rhode Island, USA, and
Newport Hospital, in Newport, Rhode Island, USA. This matched cohort study was an electronic chart
review approved by the Institutional Review Board of RIH. All data were extracted from the electronic
health record.
CP characteristics and use
All patients who received CP at our institution did so through the expanded access protocol [15]. Due to
limitations in locally available serologic testing at the time, CP was given to patients prior to knowing the
SARS-CoV-2 antibody content. Instead, SARS-CoV-2 antibody content was assessed retrospectively on
thawed segments (if available) using the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (Abbott, Abbott Park,
IL). All patients were prescribed 2 units of plasma and patients were included even if they only received
one of the units.
In addition to the broad eligibility requirements set out in the CP expanded access protocol [16],
patients were eligible to receive CP treatment if they also fulfilled the following local inclusion criteria: 1)
symptom onset ≤ 10 days prior, 2) requiring supplemental oxygen (but not invasive ventilation), 3) no
evidence of current hypercoagulability (D-dimer > 1000 µg/L, clinical signs of thrombosis).
Control group patient selection
All adult patients with a positive molecular test for COVID-19 admitted to the hospital prior to May 31,
2020 who did not receive CP were reviewed for potential inclusion in the control group. To capture a
similar case mix to those patients eligible for CP (see above), additional inclusion criteria for the control

group included the following: 1) symptom onset ≤ 10 days prior to admission, 2) hospital admission ≥ 48
hours, 3) required supplemental oxygen (but not invasive ventilation) within 48 hours of hospitalization,
4) D-dimer obtained within 48 hours of hospitalization and < 1000 µg/L.
CP group patient selection
All patients who received CP prior to May 31, 2020 were considered for potential inclusion in the CP
group. Of note, our local practice regarding CP use (including implementation of our local inclusion
criteria and increasing the dose of CP from 1 to 2 units) changed quickly after we started using this
treatment option. The initial 10 patients given CP before this change were not included in this analysis.
Several other patients who received CP were also excluded from the analysis after applying the control
group inclusion criteria to the CP group. The decision to exclude these CP recipients was an effort to
preserve uniformity within the CP group and between the CP and control groups and was made prior to
any further data analysis.
Study outcomes
The primary outcome of this study was the impact of CP treatment on all cause in-hospital mortality; the
secondary outcome was the impact of CP treatment on the time to hospital discharge. All outcomes
were censored at day 28.
Statistical analysis
We compared patient’s characteristics between the two groups using Pearson’s Chi-square test for
categorical variables, and Student’s t-test or Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test for continuous variable as
means (with standard deviation, SD) or medians (with interquartile range, IQR), respectively. All analyses
were performed using Stata v15.1 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX). The statistically significant
level was set at 0.05.

To evaluate the impact of CP treatment on all cause in-hospital mortality, we utilized both
univariate and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards models. To evaluate the impact of CP treatment
on time to hospital discharge, we used a stratified log-rank test and calculated the Mantel-Cox rate
ratios. We also performed a subgroup analysis of in-hospital mortality and time to hospital discharge
based on the antibody content of the CP units that each patient received.

Results
Study population and CP use
Of the 82 consecutive patients who received CP during the study period, 64 were included in the
analysis. Excluded patients either received CP prior to the implementation of our local inclusion criteria
or (in retrospect) did not meet the structured inclusion criteria for the matched control group [Figure 1].
Three patients included in the CP group received only 1 unit of CP (one withdrew due to clinical
improvement and hospital discharge, two had transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) reactions
associated with the first unit). The remainder of the patients received 2 units of CP. The control group
included 177 patients who did not receive CP [Table 1].
Patients received CP at a median of 7 days after symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing
was retrospectively performed on 97 (89.0%) of the 109 CP units which were transfused, 13 (13%) of
these units had an antibody index (AI) below the cutoff for a positive result (AI < 1.4) [Figure 2]. All
patients in the CP group except 3 received at least 1 unit of CP with an AI ≥ 1.4 and 18 patients received
2 units of CP both with AI ≥ 5 [Table 2].
Clinical presentation and course
The demographics and summative pre-existing comorbidities score of the patients in the CP group and
control groups were generally similar, although there were 3 patients with HIV/AIDS in the CP group (all
of whom were on antiretroviral therapy) and none in the control group [Table 1].
Both the CP group and control group had a similar percentage of patients who were treated
with remdesivir (28.1% v. 33.3%, p = 0.44), but the CP group had significantly more patients treated with
corticosteroids (40.6% v. 22.6%, p = 0.006). Overall in-hospital mortality in this study was 14.9%, with
35.3% of patients admitted to the intensive care unit, and 11.6% requiring invasive ventilation. There

was no significant difference between the groups in any of these categories (p = 0.52, p = 0.18, p = 0.84,
respectively).
Clinical outcomes and adverse events
The incidence of in-hospital mortality in the CP and control groups were not significantly different
(12.5% v. 15.8%, p = 0.52) and a multivariate analysis also found no significant difference (adjusted
hazard ratio [HR] 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39 – 2.20) [Table 3]. In a subgroup analysis
examining only those patients who received 2 units of CP with AI ≥ 5, there was a lower risk for inhospital mortality as compared to the control group, although this difference was also not significant
(adjusted HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.05 – 3.08).
The median length of stay in both the CP and control groups was 8 days. There was no
significant difference in the overall rate of hospital discharge between the two groups using a stratified
log-rank test (rate ratio [RR] 1.28, 95% CI 0.91 – 1.81) or in a subgroup analysis examining only those
patients who received 2 units of CP with AI ≥ 5 as compared to the control group (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.92 –
2.88) [Table 4].
Patients 65-years-old or greater who received CP had an increased rate of hospital discharge as
compared to those who did not (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.03 – 3.36); this increased rate of hospital discharge
was even more pronounced in a subgroup analysis of elderly patients who received 2 units of CP with AI
≥ 5 (RR 2.70, 95% CI 1.16 – 6.28). There was also a significant difference in the rate of hospital discharge
for White or Caucasian patients who received 2 units of CP with AI ≥ 5.
Two patients who received CP were judged to have a TRALI reaction. The first, a previously
healthy 37-year-old male, had severe chest pain 45 minutes after starting the CP transfusion with
associated tachypnea and worsening hypoxemia, the transfusion was stopped and symptoms resolved
several hours later. The second, a 36-year-old male who had recently undergone kidney transplantation

for end-stage renal disease, also had acute worsening of tachypnea and hypoxemia associated with
chest pain approximately 30 minutes after starting the CP transfusion, the transfusion was stopped and
symptoms resolved within 24 hours. Both patients remained afebrile and without elevated BNP during
these episodes. Additionally, a 64-year-old female with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis who
received CP was judged to have transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) with acutely
worsening hypoxemia approximately 3 hours after transfusion of 2 units of CP. There were no other
documented adverse events associated with CP use for the patients included in this study.

Discussion
This matched cohort study examined the use of CP in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 and
found no significant difference in overall in-hospital mortality or time to hospital discharge as compared
to a control group who did not receive CP. The CP group and control groups in this study were drawn
from a well-defined population, were similar in baseline characteristics and severity of illness, and were
followed long enough to allow for adequate analysis of clinical outcomes. We found a signal for the
potential efficacy of CP in elderly patients, a signal for a larger potential effect of CP with a higher
quantity of measured SARS-CoV-2 antibody, and a greater than expected frequency of transfusion
reactions.
Importantly, the stratified analysis examining only patients 65-years-old or greater who received
CP showed a significantly increased rate of hospital discharge as compared to the control group. An
effect specific to this age group is not entirely surprising given the increase in morbidity among the
elderly with COVID-19, the waning of humoral immunity with age, and the importance of the humoral
compartment of the overall immune response in combating this infection [17-19]. If this increased
efficacy of CP in the elderly is re-demonstrated in other settings, this may impact the design of clinical
trials for SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies or aid in the triage of limited CP resources.
A subgroup analysis examining only those patients who received 2 units of CP with AI ≥ 5
showed an even larger increase in the rate of hospital discharge among the elderly as compared to the
control group. There was also a statistically significant increase in the rate of hospital discharge among
White/Caucasian patients of all ages, although this may have been primarily driven by the relative
increased age of the White/Caucasian patients in our study as compared patients of other races or
ethnicities (data not shown). The semi-quantitative description of the amount of SARS-CoV-2 antinucleocapsid IgG provided by the assay’s antibody index (AI) that was used in this study has been shown

to have similar positivity rate as a recombinant neutralizing assay, although the correlation between
neutralizing titers and AI was demonstrated to be poor [20]. In a more recent study using a SARS-CoV-2
neutralizing assay, a different SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG assay was very well correlated with the
neutralizing titer [21]. Although we cannot draw any direct conclusions about the neutralizing titers of
the CP used in our study, the increase in the rate of hospital discharge across multiple stratifications
seen in the subgroup with AI ≥ 5 as compared to the entire CP group aligns well with the expected and
recently demonstrated dose-dependent effect of CP [22].
There was a greater than expected frequency of transfusion reactions in the CP group. The
observed per unit reaction rate of 3/109 (2.8%) is consistent with the 2.5% reported by Li et al [23] and
higher than that reported to our blood banks (<1%, data not shown). We classified two cases as TRALI
reactions. We are aware that CP is manufactured from never transfused male donors and never
pregnant females or the CP is tested for anti-HLA antibodies. Hence, neither product (donor) was
investigated for anti-HLA antibodies. However, the pathophysiology of Type 2 TRALI in hospitalized
patients is not related to donor alloantibodies, but to other compounds with inflammatory evoking
properties in the context of an activated pulmonary endothelium, which clearly pertains to COVID-19
patients [24]. Our elevated frequency of transfusion reactions does not align with data reported from
the large safety study associated with the expanded access protocol (TRALI 0.10%, TACO 0.18%, severe
allergic transfusion reaction 0.13%) [14]. This difference may highlight the difficulty of accurately
detecting transfusion reactions in critically ill patients or may instead simply represent an
overestimation of our local reaction rate due to the relatively low number of patients we have
transfused thus far.
Studying the efficacy of CP for emerging infectious diseases in an adequately powered
prospective randomized fashion has historically been difficult. Retrospective or non-randomized
assessments of efficacy cannot provide the same quality of evidence, as highlighted by the contrasting

data provided by a non-randomized cohort study of CP for severe pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009
which suggested a mortality benefit of adding CP to the local standard of care [25], and two more recent
well powered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the use of high-titer anti-influenza plasma
as compared to placebo [26] or low-titer plasma [27] for the treatment of seasonal influenza infection,
neither of which showed a significant difference in the primary outcome studied (clinical status at day
7). In light of these findings, a critical analysis of any non-randomized study assessing the efficacy of CP
is imperative.
While our study does demonstrate a lower incidence of in-hospital mortality in the CP group as
compared to the control group, this difference was not significant, and a multivariate analysis also
showed no significant difference between the groups. Two other propensity-matched cohort studies
suggest a mortality benefit of CP for severe COVID-19 [28,29], while two (perhaps underpowered) RCTs
were unable to demonstrate any mortality benefit [23,30]. The timing of CP transfusion in relation to
symptom onset, the antibody titer of the CP transfused, and the quantity of plasma transfused all varied
widely among these studies, making it difficult to analyze their outcomes collectively, a topic explored in
several recent meta-analyses [31-33]. The initial outcomes data from over 35,000 patients who received
CP under the expanded access protocol reemphasizes the importance of these factors, with a high CP
antibody titer and earlier transfusion corresponding to decreased mortality, as compared to a lower
titer or later transfusion [22].
The findings of this study should be generalized with caution. There is the possibility of an
unknown confounder biasing the composition of the CP group and the control group. Many of the
patients in the control group were hospitalized either before CP was locally available or during the peak
of COVID-19 hospitalizations when logistical constraints may have prevented them from being offered
CP. To avoid these confounding effects, the control group was constructed to contain patients with
similar characteristics as the CP group by applying the inclusion criteria for CP to all patients hospitalized

with COVID-19 during the study period. The CP and control groups were generally well matched among
all variables examined except corticosteroid use (significantly higher in the CP group), but both the
multivariate mortality analysis and stratified rate of hospital discharge analysis accounted for this
difference. The single center nature of the study allows for a comparison with a well-matched controlled
group but also limits enrollment, and thus the study may have been underpowered to show a significant
difference in the outcomes studied. We also did not specifically analyze an outcome examining time to
clinical improvement and using hospital discharge as a surrogate for this measure may be misleading
since some patients may have remained hospitalized for unrelated reasons.
In conclusion, this is one of the first analyses comparing CP to standard of care for the treatment
of COVID-19. Though our study had several limitations, we found no overall difference in in-hospital
mortality or in time to hospital discharge for those patients who received CP as compared to those who
did not. A secondary analysis showed a significantly increased rate of hospital discharge for CP given to
patients 65-years-old or greater. While manufactured hyperimmune globulin or monoclonal antibodies
may eventually supplant CP in the developed world, CP may remain a more cost-effective and feasible
option in the developing world as it can be manufactured locally. Moving forward, it will be important to
keep in mind a relevant transfusion medicine principle: give the right blood (plasma containing an
adequate concentration of antibody) to the right patient (perhaps older adults or those with
immunocompromising conditions) at the right time (early in the course of disease). We anxiously await
the results of several ongoing randomized trials of CP taking place across the globe to help gain further
insight into this therapy.
