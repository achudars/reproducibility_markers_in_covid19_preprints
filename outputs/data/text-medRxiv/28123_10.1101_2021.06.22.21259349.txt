Abstract

Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Delta lineage (B.1.617.2) was
implicated in the SARS-CoV-2 surge in India. We sought to describe the rapid expansion of the Delta lineage in
Ontario, Canada (population 15 million) using mutation profile information and confirmatory whole genome
sequencing. Methods: All laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases reported to Public Health Ontario between

st

April 1

and June 12

th

2021, with cycle threshold values

≤35, were eligible for screening for the N501Y and the

E484K mutations. We classified cases via mutation screening as: (1) N501Y-/E484K- (wild-type/Delta), (2) Alpha
(N501Y+/E484K-), (3) Beta/Gamma (N501Y+/E484K+), or (4) N501Y-/E484K+ (predominantly B.1.525, and
B.1.1.318). Results: The N501Y-/E484K- mutation profile went from having a 29% transmission deficit relative to

st

Alpha (relative Re = 0.71, 95%CI: 0.64, 0.77) on April 1

to having a 50% transmission advantage on June 12

th

(relative Re = 1.50, 95%CI: 1.31, 1.71). Whole genome sequencing of N501Y-/E484K- cases (N=583) confirmed
that the pattern of increasing relative reproduction number coincided with the replacement of wild-type with
Delta variant (from 2.2% in early April, to 83% in late May). Discussion: Delta is rapidly overtaking other SARSCoV-2 variants in Ontario, and has a substantial transmission advantage. An inflection in the proportion of cases
missing the N501Y mutation from rapidly decreasing to rapidly increasing,

may be an early warning signal for

Delta lineage expansion.

Background

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Delta lineage (B.1.617.2) was implicated in a
devastating SARS-CoV-2 surge in India, and subsequently with increasing rates in the United Kingdom.

The Delta

variant lacks the N501Y mutation (possessed by Alpha, Beta and Gamma) and also lacks the vaccine escape
mutation E484K (possessed by Beta and Gamma). We use mutation profile information and confirmatory whole
genome sequencing to describe the rapid expansion of the Delta lineage in Ontario, Canada (population 15
million) during a period of increasing vaccination (first dose coverage: 13.9% on April 1
and estimate the relative transmissibility of the Delta variant.

Methods

All laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases reported to Public Health Ontario between April 1
2021, with cycle threshold values

st

and June 12

th

≤35, were eligible for N501Y and the E484K mutation screening. We classified

cases as: (1) N501Y-/E484K- (wild-type/Delta), (2) Alpha (N501Y+/E484K-), (3) Beta/Gamma (N501Y+/E484K+),
or (4) N501Y-/E484K+ (predominantly B.1.525, and B.1.1.318).

To adjust for daily differences in the proportion

that received mutation screening, we multiplied the proportion of each profile among those screened, by the
total number of cases.

We modeled the daily count of each mutation profile using a count quasi-Poisson regression with the date
modeled as a flexible spline (weekly knots) and an interaction term between date and each mutation profile.
Daily growth, and the daily proportion of N501Y-/E484K- isolates were derived from this model. Daily growth
was translated to a reproduction number (Re), assuming a generation interval of 5.2 days.

5

Because initial confirmed cases of Delta in Ontario were concentrated in the municipality of Brampton, we also
stratified analyses across the Greater Toronto Area’s 3 largest municipalities (Toronto [pop. 3,100,000],
Mississauga [pop. 900,000], Brampton [pop. 600,000]). Confirmatory whole genome sequencing on a weekly
provincial sample of N501Y-/E484K- isolates was used to estimate the proportion that were Delta.

Results

In total, 185,085 SARS-CoV-2 cases were identified and 153,998 (83.2%) received mutation screening, of which
81.1% were Alpha, 9.6% were N501Y-/E484K-, 5.7% were Beta/Gamma, and 3.6% were N501Y-/E484K+. During
the period of rapidly increasing vaccination, the estimated reproduction number of Alpha declined from 1.20 to
0.62 (Figure 1), while that of N501Y-/E484K- increased slightly from 0.85 to 0.93. As such N501Y-/E484K- went
from having a 29% transmission deficit relative to Alpha (relative R e = 0.71, 95%CI: 0.64, 0.77) on April 1
having a 50% transmission advantage on June 12

to

(relative Re = 1.50, 95%CI: 1.31, 1.71).

We observed an inflection from a decreasing trend in the proportion of N501Y-/E484K- before April 28, to an
increasing trend afterwards (Figure 2A). SARS-CoV-2 cases in the municipality of Brampton (Figure 2B)
experienced this inflection first (April 17). Ontario-wide whole genome sequencing on N501Y-/E484K- samples
(N=538) revealed an increase in the proportion that were Delta (from 2/87 [2.2%] preceding April 4th, to 10/12
[83%] in the last week of May); in the week of the inflection approximately half of N501Y-/E484K- samples were
Delta (53.9%; 41/76).

Discussion

This study identified a rapid increase in the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 cases with the N501Y-/E484K- mutation
profile in Ontario, demonstrating that Delta was rapidly overtaking the Alpha variant and is 50% more
transmissible. Our analyses are consistent with estimates of a 64% secondary attack rate advantage over the
Alpha lineage from the United Kingdom.

Limitations include potentially non-representative sampling for whole

genome sequencing. For countries once dominated by Alpha, Beta, or Gamma lineages, an inflection in the
proportion of cases missing the N501Y mutation from rapidly decreasing to rapidly increasing,
warning signal for Delta lineage expansion.
