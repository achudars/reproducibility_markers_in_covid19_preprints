Abstract

65

Objective: We aimed to estimate the risk of infection in Healthcare workers (HCWs) following a high-

66

risk exposure without personal protective equipment (PPE).

67

Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort in HCWs who had a high-risk exposure to SARS-CoV-2-

68

infected subject without PPE. Daily symptoms were self-reported for 30 days, nasopharyngeal swabs

69

for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR were performed at inclusion and at days 3, 5, 7 and 12, SARS-CoV-2 serology

70

was assessed at inclusion and at day 30. Confirmed infection was defined by positive RT-PCR or

71

seroconversion, and possible infection by one general and one specific symptom for two consecutive

72

days.

73

Results: Between February 5th and May 30th, 2020, 154 HCWs were enrolled within 14 days following

74

one high-risk exposure to either a hospital patient (70/154; 46.1%) and/or a colleague (95/154;

75

62.5%). At day 30, 25.0% had a confirmed infection (37/148; 95%CI, 18.4%; 32.9%), and 43.9%

76

(65/148; 95%CI, 35.9%; 52.3%) had a confirmed or possible infection. Factors independently

77

associated with confirmed or possible SARS-CoV-2 infection were being a pharmacist or

78

administrative assistant rather than being from medical staff (adjusted OR (aOR)=3.8,

79

CI95%=1.3;11.2, p=0.01), and exposure to a SARS-CoV-2-infected patient rather than exposure to a

80

SARS-CoV-2-infected colleague (aOR=2.6, CI95%=1.2;5.9, p=0.02). Among the 26 HCWs with a SARS-

81

CoV-2-positive nasopharyngeal swab, 7 (26.9%) had no symptom at the time of the RT-PCR positivity.

82

Conclusions: The proportion of HCWs with confirmed or possible SARS-CoV-2 infection was high.

83

There were less occurrences of high-risk exposure with patients than with colleagues, but those were

84

associated with an increased risk of infection.

Main text

Introduction

88

Since December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which causes

89

COVID-19, rapidly spread around the globe [1, 2]. The difficulty to control its rapid propagation is

90

related to many factors, including the fact that infectiousness can precede the symptoms onset,

91

thereby complicating the identification and isolation of infected individuals before they can transmit

92

the virus [3, 4].

93

Healthcare workers (HCWs) can be infected following a contact with a patient, but also after

94

interactions with colleagues, or in the community [5-12]. The use of personal protective equipment

95

(PPE) was rapidly implemented in departments hosting suspected or identified SARS-CoV-2-infected

96

subjects. However, the atypical presentation of the infection favors high risk contacts between HCW

97

and unidentified patients in other departments [3], and the large circulation of the virus increases

98

the risk of infection during interactions with colleagues, during which the use of PPE or social

99

distancing may be less strictly followed [13].

100

We conducted a prospective cohort study to estimate the risk of infection in HCWs following high-

101

risk exposure in the hospital, and to evaluate the virological, immunological and clinical outcomes

102

following exposure.

103
104

Methods

105

Study design and participants

106

The CoV-CONTACT study is an ongoing prospective multicenter cohort study including HCWs with

107

exposure to an “index” SARS-CoV-2-infected person (either a patient or a colleague) whose infection

108

was virologically proven by a nasopharyngeal RT-PCR and whose exposure was considered at high-

109

risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. HCWs were included in the study in the 14 days following the last

110

identified high-risk exposure. The present analysis focuses on “contact” subjects enrolled at the

Ethics and regulatory issues

114

The study was approved by the French National Data Protection Commission (approval #920102),

115

and the French Ethics committee (CPP-Ile-de-France-6, #2020-A00280-39) and was registered on the

116

Clinicaltrial.gov registry (NCT04259892). All subjects provided written informed consent.

117

Definition of high-risk exposure

118

Exposure was considered to be at high-risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission if it occurred i) face-to-face,

119

within one meter and without protective surgical or FFP2/N95 mask, and ii) during a discussion or

120

while the index had an episode of coughing or sneezing, and iii) in the 72 hours prior to, or following

121

the virological diagnosis, or during the symptomatic period of the index.

122

Data collection

123

Collected characteristics of the index included age, date of the diagnostic nasopharyngeal RT-PCR

124

and the SARS-CoV-2 viral load [15].

125

The collected characteristics of the contacts included medical history, weight, height, current

126

medications, and smoking status. The date of the last high-risk exposure, D0, with the index were

127

also recorded, as well as the cumulative exposure duration.

128

Contacts were followed up for 30 days following D0. Nasopharyngeal swabs were performed at

129

inclusion, and then at D3, D5, D7 and D12. As inclusion could occur up to 14 days after D0, a

130

maximum of five nasopharyngeal swabs could be collected. Blood samples were drawn at inclusion

131

and D30±7d for SARS-CoV-2 serology.

132

A set of general symptoms (fever >38°C, fatigue, myalgia, headache) and specific symptoms (cough,

133

breathing difficulties, sore throat, nasal congestion, anosmia, diarrhea) was recorded daily from D0

134

to D30 using self-administered questionnaires. Results of any additional nasopharyngeal swab were

135

collected, as well as the occurrence of hospitalization, or the existence of household contacts

136

hospitalized for a SARS-CoV-2 infection between D0 and D30.

137

Virology

138

The SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was performed blinded to contact characteristics and reported symptoms

139

(see Supplementary appendix).

140

In contacts with clinical signs suggestive of COVID-19 but a negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and a

141

negative SARS-CoV-2 serology at D30, a multiplex RT-PCR (QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel; Qiagen,

142

Germany) was retrospectively performed on available aliquots to detect other respiratory pathogens

143

(see Supplementary appendix).

144

Serology

145

SARS-CoV-2 serology was performed blinded to contacts’ characteristics and reported symptoms. We

146

used two methods targeting different SARS-CoV-2 antigens: LuLISA N, an in-house Luciferase-Linked

147

Immunosorbent assay designed to detect IgG targeted toward SARS-CoV-2 N antigen (unpublished

148

results) and EuroIMMUN, a commercial immunoassay used for the detection of IgG targeted toward

149

the SARS-CoV-2 recombinant Spike protein subunit (S1) [16]. A serum was considered as positive for

150

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies when the signal exceeded the threshold set at 13,402 relative light units per

151

second (RLU/s) for LuLISA or a 1.1 ratio for EuroIMMUN.

152

For each method, we defined SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion as the apparition of a positive SARS-CoV-2

153

serology at the D30 visit, or as an at least two-fold increase of the LuLISA signal or EuroIMMUN ratio

154

between inclusion and D30, in the case of a positive serology at inclusion.

155

Definition of SARS-CoV-2 infection

156

Three definitions of SARS-CoV-2 infection were used: (i) “clinically-suspected infection”, when the

157

contact reported at least one general symptom and one specific symptom during two consecutive

158

days during the 30-day follow-up; (ii) “virologically-proven infection”, if the contact had at least one

159

SARS-CoV-2-positive nasopharyngeal swab during the 30-day follow-up; (iii) “immunologically-proven

160

infection” if the contact exhibited a SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in any of the two methods.

161

SARS-CoV-2 infection was considered as confirmed if it was virologically or immunologically-proven,

162

and considered as possible in case of clinically-suspected infection only.

163

The primary endpoint was confirmed or possible SARS-CoV-2 infection, thereafter referred to as

164

SARS-CoV-2 infection.

165

Statistical methods

166

Categorical variables are expressed as counts (percentage) and continuous variables are expressed as

167

median (IQR). We first estimated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs, with its 95%

168

confidence intervals computed using the binomial distribution. For the primary endpoint, in case of

169

missing data for one of the components, the subject was considered as infected if one of the

170

available components of the endpoint fulfilled the definition of infection, and considered missing

171

otherwise.

172

We searched for risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs. Variables achieving

173

a p-value <0.20 in univariate logistic regression analysis were entered into a multivariate logistic

174

regression analysis. Using a backward selection method, we obtained a final model in which all risk

175

factors had a p-value <0.05.. A sensitivity analysis was performed after exclusion of the

176

subpopulation who only met the definition of a possible SARS-CoV-2 infection.

177

We then studied the kinetics of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in participants with virologically-proven and

178

clinically-suspected infection. We analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 viral load as a function of time from

179

symptom onset using a quadratic regression model..

180

Analyses were performed with R v3.5 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). All

181

tests were two-sided with a type-I error fixed to 0.05.

Results

185

Contacts characteristics and type of exposure

186

Overall, 154 HCWs exposed to 44 COVID-19 index subjects were included. The median age of these

187

contacts was 35 years (IQR 29.0; 46.8), 35/154 were male (22.7 %). High-risk exposure occurred prior

188

to the widespread use of masks in the hospital (on March, 18th) in 88/154 contacts (57%). In contrast,

189

the exposure to colleagues increased from 31.8% (28/88) before March, 18th to 88.2% (60/68) after

190

March, 18th (2 contacts with combined exposures). Overall 28/154 contacts (18.2%) had a high-risk

191

exposure with more than one index subject.

192

The median duration of the high-risk exposure period was two days (IQR 0; 3.8), and contacts were

193

enrolled at a median time of 6.5 days (IQR 4; 8) after D0. Table 1 presents the characteristics of the

194

included contacts; 51/154 (33.1%) were medical doctors, midwifes, or residents; 77/154 (50.0%)

195

were nurses, nursing assistant, physiotherapists or hospital students.

196

Contacts were exposed to patients (70/152, 46.1%) or colleagues (95/152, 62.5 %) of whom 13/152

197

(8.6%) were exposed to both patients and colleagues.

198

While the exposure to patients represented 68.2% (60/88) of high-risk exposure before March 18th,

199

this number dropped to only 11.8% (8/68) after March 18th. Most contacts had a cumulated exposure

200

of more than 30 minutes (102/151, 67.5%). In the 95 contacts exposed to an index colleague,

201

exposure was related to face-to-face discussion (89/95, 93.7%), meetings (26/95, 27.4%), lunch

202

sharing (20/95, 21.1%), and other (10/95, 10.5%).

203

Virological, immunological and clinical outcomes

204

Overall, 26/154 contact subjects (16.9%, 95%CI [11.3%;23.8%]) had at least one SARS-CoV-2-positive

205

nasopharyngeal swab (see details in supplementary appendix). When positive, the median

206

nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load was 8.7 log10 copies/ml (IQR 6.5; 9.4).

207

Overall, 147 of the 154 contacts had both inclusion and D30 sera samples. At inclusion, 15/147 (10%)

208

contacts had a positive serology by one of the two methods. At D30, 31/147 (21.1%, 95%CI [14.8%;

209

28.6%]) contacts exhibited a seroconversion. Results obtained by the two serological methods are

210

presented in Table S1.

211

Based on self-administered questionnaires, 61/151 (40.4%, 95%CI [32.5%; 48.7%]) contacts met the

212

definition of a clinical infection (see details in supplementary appendix). The median duration of

213

symptoms was 5.5 days (IQR 3; 9.2).

214

The Figure 1 presents the combination of virological, immunological and clinical outcomes; 28

215

contacts fulfilled only the clinical definition of infection. In these subjects, the prevalence of

216

symptoms dropped at day 10, whereas it persisted elevated until day 30 in those with confirmed

217

infection (Figure 2).

218

Proportion of contacts with SARS-CoV-2 infection

219

At D30, among the 148 contacts with available data, 65 met the criteria of confirmed or possible

220

SARS-CoV-2 infection (43.9%, 95%CI [35.9%; 52.3%]), confirmed in 37 (25.0%, 95%CI [18.4%; 32.9%]),

221

and possible (i.e., only clinically-suspected) in 28 (18.9%, 95%CI [13.2%; 26.5%]). Figure S1 presents

222

the different clusters of exposure from the 44 index subjects. Among the 28 contacts with possible

223

SARS-CoV-2 infection, multiplex RT-PCR for other respiratory viruses could be performed in 21 and

224

was negative for 19 patients and positive for two (one bocavirus and one rhinovirus). During follow-

225

up, one contact with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was hospitalized. There was no hospitalization

226

for SARS-CoV-2 infection reported in their household contacts.

227

Factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection

228

In the multivariable analysis, the variables associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were being a

229

pharmacist or administrative assistant (OR=3.8, CI95%=1.3; 11.2, p=0.01) and having a contact with a

230

SARS-CoV-2-infected patient (OR=2.6, CI95%=1.23; 5.9, p=0.02).

231

The results of the sensitivity analysis excluding contacts having only a possible SARS-CoV-2 infection

232

provided similar results except for pharmacist or administrative assistants’ function (Table S2).

233

Viral dynamics in infected contacts

234

The viral load as a function of time since symptom onset reached a maximum at 8.8 log10 copies/ml 4

235

days after symptom onset followed by a decline afterwards (Figure 3). Of note, 7/25 subjects had a

236

positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab before the symptoms onset and the first positive

237

nasopharyngeal swab was observed as early as six days before symptoms onset. In eight subjects, the

238

positive swab was preceded by one negative swab and in two of them, the negative swab was done

239

after the symptom onset.

242

Discussion

243

In this prospective cohort of high-risk exposed HCWs, between 25% and 44% of subjects acquired

244

SARS-CoV-2 infection at day 30, depending on the definition used to assess infection. Viral shedding

245

occurred before symptoms onset in 27% of the SARS-CoV-2-positive subjects. The majority of HCWs

246

were exposed to a SARS-CoV-2-infected colleague (62.5%), and a substantial proportion had a high-

247

risk contact with a patient (46.1%). Exposure with a SARS-CoV-2-infected patient was significantly

248

associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (p=0.023).

249

The HCWs included in our analysis reflected the diversity of the hospital workers, [17] offering an

250

ideal perspective to analyze the risks of infections encountered in a hospital. Following universal

251

masking for HCWs on March, 18th in our hospital, high-risk exposure to SARS-CoV-2-positive patients

252

dropped from 68.2% to 11.8%, and high-risk exposure to SARS-CoV-2-positive colleagues became

253

predominant, increasing from 31.8% to 88.2% and making colleagues-to-colleagues transmission a

254

potentially major route of infection [7]. The profession of the contact subject was associated with

255

infection, but we did not find any association with the type of activities of the HCWs. Although it is

256

likely that activities involving a close contact with patients favor infection, such association might

257

have been masked as HCWs could also be infected by colleagues.

258

One of the strengths of our study is its prospective design, with daily self-questionnaire to

characterize symptoms onset and evolution, as well as repeated nasopharyngeal swabs to capture

260

the time of infection after exposure, and serological assessments at inclusion and at day 30. The 10%

261

seropositivity of HCWs at inclusion corresponds to the seroprevalence reported in the Paris area in

262

the general population during this period, [18] and it is plausible that these subjects had been

263

infected prior to the high-risk exposure identified in the study. Seroconversion was observed in about

264

a third of exposed HCWs classified as infected, while their nasopharyngeal swabs were negative;

265

most of these HCWs were symptomatic. Inversely a quarter of the HCWs with a SARS-CoV-2-positive

266

nasopharyngeal swabs had no detectable antibodies at day 30, despite the use of two serological

267

techniques. The prospective nature of our analysis allowed us to characterize the time to viral

268

positivity in the 26 subjects with SARS-CoV-2-positive nasopharyngeal swabs and the relationship

269

between the viral load and the time since symptom onset. Nasopharyngeal viral load could be

270

positive before symptom onset, with the first positive viral load obtained as early as six days before

271

symptom onset, consistent with the estimated 6-day incubation period previously reported [19, 20].

272

In addition to these confirmed infections, we also considered possible infections, as defined by the

273

presence of one general and one specific symptoms for two consecutive days in subjects with neither

274

a positive PCR nor seroconversion. Our definition is stricter than what was done in other studies [17,

275

21-23]. Interestingly we found that the kinetics of symptom onset was very similar in confirmed and

276

possibly infected subjects, with 20-35% of subjects presenting symptom between day 4 and day 15

277

after their last high-risk exposure. The possibly infected patients had a lower prevalence of

278

symptoms as time went by, with a rapid reduction of prevalence around day 15, while subjects with

279

confirmed infection had a prevalence of symptoms that remained larger than 20% until day 30. The

280

faster clearance of symptoms in possible infections suggests that these patients had a milder disease,

281

which would be consistent with the fact that their nasopharyngeal swabs remained negative and that

282

they did not exhibit detectable antibodies. Future analyses, that will include the probabilistic analysis

283

of their serial negative nasopharyngeal swab results, as well as the study of the immune cellular

284

response, will provide more conclusive evidence on their infection status [24].

285

A major limitation of our study is the absence of whole genome sequencing comparing the virus of

286

the index subject and SARS-CoV-2-infected HCW. Therefore, the network of exposures and infection

287

only suggests that the infection in a subject is the consequence of a high-risk exposure. However,

288

sequencing would be restricted to RT-PCR positive subjects, which only represent 40% (26/65) of our

289

population of confirmed and possible infections. Another limitation was that the type of contacts

290

observed in the study has been modified by universal masking implemented on March, 18th, 2020.

291

After this date, most at risk contacts were between two HCWs, which were less likely, but not

292

unlikely, to result in SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

293

All together, the rate of transmission observed in HCWs after high-risk exposure, which could be as

294

large as 44%, and close to a recent report [25], strengthens the conclusion that universal masking of

295

HCW, both during contacts with patients and colleagues, and at all times, is essential to prevent

296

HCWs infection and maintain hospital capacities during outbreaks [26].

discharged in conservation fluid according to the manufacturer recommendations. Viral RNA was extracted
from 200 µL of discharge fluid with the MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit - Large Volume (Roche
Diagnostics) and eluted in 50 µL. Then, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was performed using the RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 RTPCR kit 1.0 (Altona Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This assay allows the detection
and differentiation of lineage B-betacoronavirus (B-ßCoV), by targeting the E gene from B-ßCoV, and SARS-CoV2 specific RNA, by targeting the S gene. PCR assays were performed on an ABI 7500 plateform (Applied
Biosystems®).
A signal with a cycle threshold value above 40 was considered as negative.

Other respiratory pathogens RT-PCR

Detection of other respiratory pathogens was performed using the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel (Qiagen),
designed for the detection of adenovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus 229E (CoV 229E), CoV HKU1, CoVNL63, CoV
OC43, human metapneumovirus A and B, influenza A (FLU A), FLU A H1, FLU A H3, FLU A H1N1/2009, influenza

Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Approximately 300 µL

of discharge fluid was tested according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
LuLISA

The LuLISA N assay makes use of a nanobody fused to luciferase for the detection of IgG antibodies binding to
the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (N). Sera were used at a 1:200 dilution. The luciferase signal was measured and
expressed in Relative Light Units per second (RLU/s). The threshold of positivity (13,402 RLU/s) was based on
the analysis of 231 pre-pandemic sera and defined as the mean + two standard deviations

Supplementary Results

Virological, immunological and clinical outcomes

The median number of nasopharyngeal swabs performed per contact was two (IQR 1;3), and the median time
between the last high-risk exposure and the first SARS-CoV-2-positive nasopharyngeal swab was 6.5 days (IQR
4; 8).
Based on self-administered questionnaires, the most frequent symptoms being tiredness (74/151; 49.0%),
headache (72/151; 47.7%) and myalgia (48/146; 32.9%) among general symptoms, and nasal congestion
(52/148; 35.1%) and cough (51/149; 34.2%) among specific symptoms. The median duration of symptoms was
5.5 days (IQR 3; 9.2).
The median number of symptoms was 5 (IQR 4; 6) among the 28 contacts with possible SARS-CoV-2 infection
and was 6 (IQR 4; 10) among those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection

Exposure to a SARS-CoV-2-infected patient was at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection than exposure to a SARSCoV-2 colleague (p=0.023, Table 1). Nurses, nurse assistants, physiotherapists and hospital students had a
higher risk than medical staff (p=0.04), as did pharmacists and administrative assistants (p=0.033). In the
multivariable analysis, the c-statistic of this final model was 0.67 (95%CI=0.58; 0.76) and the p-value of the
Hosmer-Lemeshow test was 0.99, showing no model misspecification.
