Research in context
Evidence before this study
SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading in China as well as in other countries. We searched PubMed
for articles published up to Feb 15, 2020. Serveral articles that describe the epidemiological and
clinical characteristics of general COVID-19 patients. However, special reports about dead cases
of COVID-19 were limited but warranted, considering the large amount of confirmed cases,
which is still increasing
Added value of this study
We retrospectively analysed specific clinical information of 36 non-survivors infected with
SARS-CoV-2 in this single-centered study. Most patients were older males with comorbidities.
Gradually decreased lymphocytes and increased inflammation biomarkers were found in these
patients. They finally progressed to ARDS. The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days.
The mean survival time in our cohort of COVID-19 non-survivors was about 2 weeks.

Implications of all the available evidence
Lots of patients died from COVID-19 till now. The median survival time of these non-survivors
from onset to death was about 2 weeks. Most patients were older males with comorbidities. They
finally progressed to ARDS. Early detection and intervention of patients are especially important
which can delay the development from mild to severe cases.

Summary

Background

Although the outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused over 2200 deaths in
China, there was no study about death yet. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of
non-survivors with COVID-19.

Methods

For this retrospective, single-center study, we included 36 non-survivors with COVID-19 in the
Fifth Hospital of Wuhan. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR between Jan 21 and Feb
10, 2020 according to the recommended protocol. The epidemiological, demographic, clinical,
laboratory, radiological and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes were
followed up until Feb 14, 2020. This study was approved by the ethics commissions of the Fifth
Hospital of Wuhan, with a waiver of informed consent due to a public health outbreak
investigation.

Findings

We included 36 patients who died from COVID-19. The mean age of the patients was 69.22
years (SD 9.64, range 50-90). 25(69.44%) patients were males, and 11 (30.56%) female. 26
(72.22%) patients had chronic diseases, mainly including hypertension, cardiovascular disease
and diabetes. Patients had common clinical symptoms of fever (34 [94.44%] patients), cough (28

[77.78%] patients), shortness of breath (21 [58.33%] patients), and fatigue (17 [47.22%] patient).
Chest computed tomographic scans showed that 31 (96.88%) patients had bilateral pneumonia.
Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.67 × 109/L [SD, 0.33]) occurred in 24 patients (70.59%),
decreased albumin (30.18, [SD, 4.76]) in 25 patients (80.65%), elevated D-dimer (8.64 [IQR,
2.39-20]) in 27 patients (100%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (502.5 U/L [IQR, 410-629])
in 26 patients (100%). Nearly all of the patients have elevated CRP (106.3 mg/L [IQR, 60.83225.3]), PCT (0.61 ng/ml [IQR, 0.16-2.10]) and IL-6 (100.6 pg/ml [IQR, 51.51-919.5]). Most
patients received antiviral therapy and antibiotic therapy, and more than half of patients received
glucocorticoid therapy (25 [69.44%]). All the patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS). The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. One (2.78%) patient presented
with acute renal injury. The median time from onset to death was 17 days.

Interpretation

Lots of patients died from COVID-19 till now. The median survival time of these non-survivors
from onset to death was about 2 weeks. Most patients were older males with comorbidities. They
finally progressed to ARDS. The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. Gradually
decreased lymphocytes and increased inflammation biomarkers were common, and need to be
monitored in the routine treatment.

Funding

There is no any funder involved in this study.

Introduction
The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) happened since December 2020 in Wuhan1.2SARSCoV-2 has been spreading in China as well as in other countries3–6. The outbreak of SARS-CoV2 infection has been declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the
World Health Organization (WHO) on 30 January 2020. According to the situation report from
WHO, as of 21 February 2020, SARS-Cov-2 infection has caused 76769 confirmed cases in 27
countries and 2247 deaths globally7.
Severity of COVID-19 varied from mild to severe.8 Mortality rate of COVID-19 can be reduced,
by timely identifying those who are at higher risk of developing into critically ill patients, closely
monitoring changes of their disease course, and applying intensive care treatment to these
patients. However, reports about dead cases of COVID-19 were limited but warranted,
considering the large amount of confirmed cases, which is still increasing. In this single-centered
study, we retrospectively analysed specific clinical information of 36 non-survivors infected with
SARS-CoV-2.

Methods

Study design and participants

For this retrospective, single-center study, we included 36 non-survivors with COVID-19 in the
Fifth Hospital of Wuhan. Cases were confirmed between Jan 21 and Feb 10, 2020 according to

the recommended protocol. This study was approved by the ethics commissions of hospital, with
a waiver of informed consent due to a public health outbreak investigation.

Procedures

COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR using the same protocol described previously9.
Additionally, all patients were given chest computed tomography (CT). We obtained
epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment and outcome data from patients'
medical records. Clinical outcomes were followed up to Feb 14, 2020.

Outcomes

We analysed epidemiological, demographics, exposure history, smoking history, chronic medical
illness, signs and symptoms on admission, comorbidity, chest CT findings, laboratory findings
and treatment measures.

Statistical analysis

Categorical variables were described as count (%). Continuous variables were described using
mean (SD) if they are normally distributed, median (IQR) if they are not. All statistical analyses
were performed using R (version 3.6.1).

We included 36 patients who died from COVID-19 in the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan. One (2.78%)
patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. The mean age of the
patients was 69.22 years (SD 9.64, range 50-90). Twenty-five (69.44%) patients were males, and
11 (30.56%) female. Four (11.11%) patients have smoking history. Twenty-six (72.22%) patients
had chronic diseases. The most common chronic diseases were hypertension (21, 58.33%),
cardiovascular (8, 22.22%) and diabetes (7, 19.44%) (Table 1).

On admission, most patients had fever, cough and more than half of them had shortness of breath
(Table 2). Other symptoms included fatigue, dyspnea, sputum production, disturbance of
consciousness, diarrhea, hemoptysis and myalgia. (Table 2). Patients had common clinical
symptoms of fever (34, 94.44%), cough (28, 38.89%), shortness of breath (21, 58.33%), fatigue
(17, 47.22%), dyspnea (14, 38.89%), sputum production (8, 22.22%), disturbance of
consciousness (8, 22.22%), diarrhea (3, 8.33%), hemoptysis (2, 5.56%), and muscle ache (1,
2.78%).

According to chest CT scan, 31 (96.88%, N=32) patients showed bilateral pneumonia (75%). On
admission, leucocytes were below the normal range in 5 (14.71%) patients and above the normal
range in 11 (32.35%) patients (Table 3). Neutrophils showed above the normal range in 16
(47.06%) patients. Lymphocytes and hemoglobin were below the normal range in many patients
(Table 3). Twelve (35.39%) patients’ platelets were below the normal range. 22 patients had
varying degrees of liver function abnormality, with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) rose above the normal range (Table 3). Elevation of lactate
dehydrogenase were showed in 26 (100%, N=26) patients. About 30% of these patients had
different degrees of renal function damage, with elevated blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine.

Regarding the infection index, procalcitonin (PCT) rose above the normal range in 28 (100%)
patients. 11 patients were tested for IL-6, most of whose index were above the normal range
(Table 3). 32 patients had increased C-reactive protein (CRP).

Thirty-five (35, 97.22%) patients received antiviral treatment, including oseltamivir, ganciclovir,
ribavirin or umifenovir hydrochloride. All patients were given antibiotic treatment (Table 2); 14
(38.89%) patients with a single antibiotic and 22 (61.11%) patients with combination therapy. 25
(69.44%) patients were also treated with glucocorticoids, and 20 (55.56%) patients treated with
intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. Six patients have received aerosol inhalation treatment
with a-IFN. Almost all the patients (35, 97.22%) received oxygen therapy, in which 19 (52.78%)
patients used non-invasive ventilator mechanical ventilation and 9 (25%) patients used an
invasive ventilator to assist ventilation.

All the cases had developed into Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The median time
from onset to ARDS was 11 days (Supplementary Figure 1). One (2.78%) patient presented with
acute renal injury before ARDS. Electrolyte disturbance occurred in 16 patients (44.44%, Table
2). The median time from onset to death was 17 days (Figure 1).

Discussion

We reported on 36 patients who died from SARS-CoV-2 infection in a single hospital of Wuhan.
All these patients had ARDS and 28 (77.78%) patients needed mechanical ventilation. Bilateral
pneumonia was detected in most patients on admission. Previous studies have shown that elder
patients and males who were confirmed with coronavirus infection are at higher risk of ARDS, 10

which was consistent with our study. Antibiotic treatment was used to prevent secondary
infections since these patients were critically ill. Antiviral regimes were also used in most
patients which we hoped may have roles but still need more data. However, there were no
specific remedies for SARS-CoV-2 yet11,12. Therefore, most patients were treated with
supportive treatment and intensive care. Unfortunately, due to restrictions of hospital’s
conditions and the heavy burden of COVID-19 in Wuhan City, neither were we able to provide
patients in need with advanced life support systems like Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation
(ECMO), nor were able to transport all serious patients to superior hospital for better medical
treatments in time. The median survival time of the patients in our study was only 2 weeks
approximately, which was shorter compared to previous reports13. According to the study
conducted by Yang et al., the mortality rate in critically ill patients with COVID-19 was higher
than that in critically ill patients with SARS. To help patients who were critically ill survive from
SARS-CoV-2 infection, advanced life support systems and other more intensive care are needed.
In our cohort, non-survivors were hospitalized at 10 days after onset, and most of patients
develop into ARDS within the first 3 days after admission (Supplementary Figure 1). This
concentratedly reflected the current situation under the outbreak and was closely related to the
run-up of medical resources. Early detection and intervention of patients are especially important
which can delay the development from mild to severe cases. Encouragingly, more intensive care
units (ICU) are being constructed, and more specialists and clinicians from different regions in
China are assembling in medical institutions in Wuhan. Ultimately, the mortality of COVID-19
will decrease as the clinical capacity improves.

As reported in previous studies, patients who are male, elder or have a history of cerebrovascular
disease are at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection2,14,15. In our study, we found that the
majority of coronavirus non-survivors were male patients, elder patients and patients with
chronic diseases, which indicated that these patients might be also at increased risk of becoming
critically ill or death. Cerebrovascular diseases were the most common comorbidities. Twentytwo (61.11%) non-survivors had cerebrovascular diseases in our report, and the percentage of
cerebrovascular diseases among non-survivors was higher than that reported by Yang et al13.
Besides, there were 4 (11.11%) non-survivors who had smoking history and 4 (11.11%) had
preexisting COPD. According to previous studies on middle east respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV), smokers and COPD patients might be susceptible to MERS. Further,
compared to non-smokers, smokers and COPD patients had a higher dipeptidyl peptidase IV
(DPP4) expression, which was inversely correlated with lung function and diffusing capacity
parameters16. Although the relationship between smoking history and susceptibility as well as
worse outcomes in COVID-19 remains unclear, we cautioned that the prognosis of COVID-19 in
patients with smoking history might be more severe.

In our cohort, lymphocytopenia occurred in more than 70% of patients at admission, which is a
main laboratory feature in COVID-19 patients15,17. Lymphocytopenia have been identified in the
critically ill patients with SARS-CoV and MERS infection18,19. As mentioned in previous studies,
the severity of lymphocytopenia might indicate the severity of COVID-19, under the assumption
of SARS-CoV-2 viral could attack and destroy the lymphocyte targetedly2. Further studies are
warranted to confirm these findings. Increased levels of serum CRP, PCT, IL-6 were also found.
It indicated the obvious inflammatory response among these patients. In addition, we noticed that

the increased CRP, PCT concentration and decreased lymphocyte count from admission to death
(Supplementary Figure 2), which may represent more prominent inflammation in severe patients.
Therefore, intravenous glucocorticoids therapy, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and
interferon-alpha (α-IFN) aerosol inhalation were also used to restore homeostasis, without solid
evidence. To our knowledge, there is still no specific medicine for COVID-19 till now. Clinical
trials on promising regimens for COVID-19, such as remdesivir, lopinavir, and chloroquine
phosphate are ongoing, which shed light on conquering the COVID-19 epidemic12.

This study has several limitations. First, only 36 dead cases were included. However, this is the
largest cohort about the non-survivors of COVID-19 up to now. Second, some specific clinical
information was insufficient, such as mechanical ventilation settings, oxygen concentration, and
detailed medication history. Third, this is a retrospective, single-centered study. It may be limited
to the hospital critical care resources. Further studies are still needed.

In conclusion, most non-survivors are older men with comorbidities (especially cardiovascular
diseases). They finally progressed to ARDS. The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days.
The mean survival time in our cohort of COVID-19 non-survivors was about 2 weeks. Gradually
decreased lymphocytes and increased inflammation biomarkers were found in these patients, and
need to be monitored in the routine treatment. Early detection and intervention of patients are
especially important which can delay the development from mild to severe cases.
