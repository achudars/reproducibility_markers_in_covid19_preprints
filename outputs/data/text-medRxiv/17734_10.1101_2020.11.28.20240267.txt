Abstract

Background and aims: The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread rapidly
around the globe with considerable morbidity and mortality. Coexistence of comorbidities with
COVID-19 have consistently been reported as risk factors for unfavorable prognosis. We aim at

this study to evaluate the impact of comorbidities in COVID-19 patients on the outcome and
determine predictors of prolonged hospital stay, requisite for ICU admission or decease.
Methods: Four hundreds and thirty nine adult patients who are admitted through (June and
July 2020) in Assiut and Aswan University Hospitals were included in the study. All participants
were diagnosed with COVID-19 according to Egyptian Ministry of Health guidance as definite
case or Probable case. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was done by (TaqMan™ 2019-nCoV
Control Kit v1 (Cat. No. A47532) supplied by QIAGEN, Germany on the Applied Biosystem 7500
Fast RT PCR System, USA.
Results: Patients with comorbidities represented 61.7% of all cases. Constitutional symptoms
especially myalgia and LRT symptoms such as dyspnea were significantly higher in patients with
comorbidities (P < 0.05). Patients with comorbidities had significantly worse laboratory
parameters. ICU admission was higher in patients with comorbidities (35.8%). Among different
comorbidities 45.4% of CVD cases were admitted in ICU followed by DM cases (40.8%). Also,
patients with comorbidities needed invasive mechanical ventilation more than those without
comorbidity (31 vs. 10.7%, P<0.001). Significant lower frequency of recovery was found in
COVID-19 patients with comorbidities (59% vs. 81%, P<0.001) and death rate was significantly
higher in cases with comorbidities (P< 0.001). The survival rates in cases with pre-existing CVD
and neurological diseases were lower than those without disease (P<0.002 and 0.001
respectively).
Conclusion: Association of cardiovascular comorbid conditions including hypertension or
neurological diseases together with COVID-19 infections carries higher risks of mortality.
However, other comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, chronic pulmonary or kidney diseases
may also contribute to increased COVID-19 severity.

Introduction:
COVID-19 is a novel emerging, rapidly propagating illness that is overwhelming most of
resources of efficient health-care systems, and numerous hospitals, globally, are presently
suffering a lack of ICU beds for critically ill COVID-19 pneumonic patients. Till now more than 26
million cases and 850 thousand deceases were recorded worldwide according to WHO(1). A risk
stratification based on clinical, radiological and laboratory parameters seems necessary in order
to better identify those patients who may need hospital and/or ICU admission.
Generally, one of the ultimate alarming clinical considerations is the presence of comorbidities.
Comorbidities are associated with worse health outcome, more complex clinical management,
and increased health care cost. We should seek to provide the best local solutions in
conjunction with the recent national guidelines to continue the proper management of patients
while ensuring proper resource (2). Chronic disorders participate in numerous topographies
with communicable diseases, for instance the proinflammatory state, and the attenuation of
the innate immune response which may possibly be allied etiologically to its pathogenesis (3).
Moreover, upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme in patients with chronic diseases are
increasing the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the risk of disease aggravation (4).
A recent meta-analysis reported that underlying disease, including hypertension,
diabetes mellitus, respiratory and cardiovascular disease (5), as well as obesity(6), may be risk
factors for adverse outcomes. So further studies of comorbidities as a risk of fatality at different
communities are required.(7).
The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of comorbidities in COVID-19 patients on the
outcome and determine predictors of prolonged hospital stay, requisite for ICU admission or
decease.
Patients and methods:
Study design and population:
This is a retrospective observational cohort study conducted in two major health-care
centers in Upper Egypt. First one was Assiut University Hospitals which involve 7 specialized

hospitals and second one was Aswan University Hospital. Both were designated to diagnose
and treat moderate and severe cases of COVID-19.
All adult patients admitted through (June and July 2020) were included in the study.
Diagnosis and Evidence of COVID-19
All participants were diagnosed with COVID-19 according to Egyptian Ministry of Health
guidance. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as
1- Cases with definite COVID-19 if patients came with clinical symptoms of infection and
PCR of respiratory samples (eg, nasal or throat swab) was positive.
2- Cases with probable COVID-19 if clinical symptoms of infection and chest CT was
consistent with COVID-19 plus one or 2 laboratory investigations were positive) (lymphopenia,
high serum ferretin and D-Dimer Level) but PCR was negative or not done.
After reviewing of records any patient less than 18 years or with missed clinical outcomes
status was excluded from the study.
•

PCR diagnosis has been done as the following:

Specimens collection: For initial diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2, CDC recommends collecting
and testing an upper respiratory specimen. The following specimens were collected by a healthcare provider from cases with suspected novel coronavirus infection: A nasopharyngeal (NP) or
oropharyngeal (OP).
Swab specimens were collected using swabs with a synthetic tip, and an aluminum or plastic
shaft. Swabs were placed immediately into sterile tubes containing 2-3 mL of viral transport
media. The samples were stored at 2-8°C up to 72 hours.
1. RNA extraction of SARS-CoV-2 was done using (QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit Catalog no.
52904 supplied by QIAGEN, Germany). Sample preparation using QIAcube instruments
follows the same steps as the manual procedure (i.e., lyse, bind, wash and elute).
2. Pathogen detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was done by (TaqMan™ 2019-nCoV Control Kit
v1 (Cat. No. A47532) supplied by QIAGEN, Germany) on the Applied Biosystem 7500 Fast RT
PCR System, USA. It amplified and detected three viral genomic regions, reducing the risk of
false negatives including the N protein (nucleocapsid gene), S protein (Spike gene), and
open reading frame-1ab (ORF1ab) genes. Applied Biosystems™ TaqMan™ 2019-nCoV

Control Kit v1 (Cat. No. A47533) is a synthetic positive control that contains target
sequences for each of the assays included in the TaqMan™ 2019-nCoV Assay Kit v1 (Cat. No.
A47532).
Data collection:
Clinical records and laboratory data were reviewed by the investigators in each study site
and the following data were extracted for analysis:
1-Demographic and clinical data: age, gender, presenting symptoms, comorbidities, and
outcomes.
2-Laboratory investigations: complete blood picture, liver function tests, kidney function
tests, D-dimer, serum ferritin and C-reactive protein (CRP).
3-Chest CT findings.
4-Clinical outcomes: complete recovery, need for ICU admission, and death.
Classification of the patients: According to the presence or absence of preexisiting
comorbidities which determined based on patient’s self-report on admission if diagnosed with
any chronic illness on the last 10 years then comorbidities were classified based on the number
(single, two and three or more); the patients were classified into
a. Group I: COVID-19 patients with at least one of the comorbidities (diabetes
mellitus , cardiovascular diseases including hypertension, chronic pulmonary
disease, chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, neurological disease,
autoimmune disease, endocrinal disease and any other disease or risk factor).
b. Group II: COVID-19 patients without any of comorbidities
Ethical approval:
The research protocol was approved via the Ethical Review Committee of Assiut Faculty of
Medicine before starting of the study (IRB no: 17300434). Patients identifying information were
concealed and each patient assigned for a code to insure privacy and confidentiality of the data.
Written informed consent was obtained from the each patient or from first degree relatives.
Statistical analysis:

All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 20 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). Categorical data were presented as frequencies and percentages, while Chisquare tests were used for comparisons between groups. Continuous data were reported as
means ± standard deviations and tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilkes test. Where
continuous data were normally distributed, the Student's T-test was used for comparisons
between groups; where data were non-normally distributed, the Mann-Whitney test was used.
For survival analysis, the outcome was tested related to time since the admission until
death/end of the study period. For people who did not die, end of July 2020 was included as the
final day of research; therefore, the study ended. The Kaplan–Meier survival curves were
performed and differences in survival rates were analyzed by log-rank test. Univariate Cox
regression was conducted to detect the hazard ratio (HR) of different comorbidities and
variables with statistically different HR were included in a multivariate Cox regression model
and adjusted for age and sex. In all statistical tests p-value <0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

Results:
Screening of 447 patients’ records was conducted and 8 cases were excluded due to
their age (< 18 years old) then analysis of 439 cases was performed. Patients with comorbidities
represented 61.7% of all cases as demonstrated in figure 1.
The mean age of studied patients was 51.2 ± 17.2 years old and it was higher in patients
with comorbidities (p < 0.001). Fever, and lower respiratory tract (LRT) symptoms especially dry
cough were the most frequent symptoms (74.3% and 74.7% respectively). GIT symptoms were
present in 21.2% of patients, while neurological symptoms in 43.8%. When comparing
symptoms of two groups, constitutional symptoms especially myalgia and LRT symptoms such
as dyspnea were significantly higher in patients with comorbidities (P < 0.05). CT-chest showed
bilateral GGO in most of cases (82.6%). (Table 1)
The most frequent comorbidities in studied group were cardiovascular diseases (69%) of
patients with comorbidities followed by DM (54.2%). (Table 2)
Patients with comorbidities had significantly worse laboratory parameters. Detailed data were
included in Table 3.
ICU admission was higher in patients with comorbidities as 35.8% of them need ICU
admission compared to only 16.4% of those without any comorbidity (P<0.001). Among
different comorbidities 45.4% of CVD cases were admitted in ICU followed by DM cases (40.8%)
(Figure 2). Also, patients with comorbidities needed invasive mechanical ventilation more than
those without comorbidity (31 vs. 10.7%, P<0.001). (Table 4)
Recovery was recorded in nearly 68% of admitted COVID-19 cases (improved and
discharged from hospital) with significant lower frequency of cure in patients with
comorbidities (59% vs. 81%, P<0.001) and death rate was significantly higher in cases with
comorbidities (P< 0.001) (Table 4). Death rate in different comorbidity groups was illustrated in
figure 3.
Kaplan-Maier survival curves showed significant difference in survival rates in cases with
pre-existing CVD and neurological diseases in which the survival rates are lower than those
without disease (P<0.002 and 0.001 respectively). Also, patients without any comorbidity

showed higher survival rate than those with one, two or three or more comorbidities (74.2%,
34.5%, 34.3% and 35.5% respectively). ( Figures 4&5)
In univariate cox regression model, the older ages had higher risk of death than lower
age groups as HR for 60 – 79 age group was 3.9 (95% CI. 2 – 7.8) and in cases > 80 years was
10.1 (95% CI. 4-25.6). For different comorbidities, cases with CVDs and neurological diseases
showed significant higher risk of death than others as HR in CVDs was 1.9 (95% CI. 1.2 – 1.9)
and in neurological diseases was 2.9 (95% CI. 1.5 – 5.6). Also, number of comorbidities showed
significant higher risk than those without any comorbidity as those with one comorbidity has a
HR of 2 (95% CI. 1.1 – 3.7) and with two comorbidities the HR as 2.6 (95% CI. 1.4 – 4.7) while
those with 3 or more comorbidities the HR as 2.9 (95% CI. 1.5 – 5.6). After adjustment of
significant factors in multivariate cox regression, only higher age groups and neurological
diseases showed higher risk for death. (Table 5)
Discussion:
Multiple comorbidities are associated with COVID-19 disease and may contribute to its
progression or poor outcome. The current study included 439 moderate to severe COVID-19
patients of them 61.7% had one or more comorbid diseases. The mean age of the studied
population was 51.2 years with no gender predilection. Of them, 34.1% needed ICU admission
and 21.4% were deceased with mean hospital stay 8.4 days.
In this study, as previously reported in reviews and metanalysis(5, 8, 9) cardiovascular
diseases, including hypertension,( 42.6%) and diabetes mellitus(33.5%) were the most common
comorbidities associated with COVID-19 infection followed by chronic chest diseases and
neuropsychiatric disorders (7.1%). This may be attributed to: A) The older age of patients with
comorbid diseases. Based on the current information, the elderly, a vulnerable population,
with chronic health conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular or lung disease not only a
higher risk of COVID-19 infection(10) but also an increased risk of getting severe illness or even
death if they become infected(11). The weaknesses of advanced age are related to the function
defense cells T and B, and to the excess production of type 2 cytokines, which can lead to a
prolonged pro-inflammatory response, leading to unfortunate results(12). B) Common
pathogenesis as chronic disorders collaborate several baseline topographies with

communicable diseases, for instance the pro-inflammatory status, and the attenuation of the
innate immune response. For instance, diabetes occurs in part because the accumulation of
triggered innate immune cells leads to the release of inflammatory markers, principally IL-1β
and Tumor necrosis factor α, that promote generalized resistance to insulin and destruction of
β-cell (13). C) Immunity depletion by impairing macrophage and lymphocyte function which
may make individuals more susceptible to infectious diseases and its complications(3). D) Upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) genes expression in different parts of the
body, such as heart and lungs, in patients with diabetes, or CVD, increasing the susceptibility to
SARS-CoV-2 infection and the risk of disease aggravation as it has been identified as an
important functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 invasion(4, 14).
In the current study, cases with severe disease requiring ICU admission (35.8%
compared to 16.4%), increased need for oxygen therapy, ventilatory support, and almost triple
times death rate were significantly associated with patients recording comorbidities. However,
by using univariate cox regression model, only cases with CVDs (HR 1.9; 95% CI 1.2 – 2.8;
P<0.003) and neurological diseases (HR 2.9; 95% CI 1.5 – 5.6; P<0.002) showed significant
higher risk of death than others. After adjustment of significant factors in multivariate cox
regression, neurological diseases showed higher risk for death.
Cardiovascular comorbid conditions are associated with a variety of the worse outcomes
for COVID-19 in literatures (15-17). Moreover, association between hypertension and coexisting other comorbidities such as HIV, kidney, or other cardiovascular diseases raises the
hazard rate more than the other comorbidities(17). In this study, 37.4% of patients with CVDs
including hypertension admitted to ICU and 30.5% of them were deceased. M. Li et al. found
that the levels of inﬂammation indicators like CRP, serum ferritin and ESR were increased in
COVID-19 patients and associated with the severity of the disease, furthermore, the levels of
these indicators in the patients with CVD were ominously higher than those without CVD which
indicate that COVID-19 cases with CVD had additional potential to practice an inﬂammatory
storm, which ultimately clues to prompt worsening of these patients’ conditions. Through the
course of contagion, inﬂammation of the lung tissue inhibits the exchange of oxygen in the
alveoli, progressing to generalized tissue hypoxia, which triggers the ﬁbrinolytic system.

Moreover, compared with the non-CVD group, the ranks of D- dimer and FIB were greater
among CVD group, which indicates that they were more susceptible to hyper-coagulability. A
hyper-coagulable state raises the hazard of pulmonary embolism, which can explain the sudden
occurrence of complications such as hypoxia and heart failure(16). All those results were
harmonized with the current study which displayed significantly higher levels of all
inflammatory markers as well as D-dimer level in patients with comorbidities, however, due to
the overlap between different conditions (33.9% of patients had 2 comorbid conditions and
21.4% had three or more), we couldn’t evaluate patients with CVD alone.
Unlike most of the published literatures, even a recent observational study carried out
in the same geographical area which stated that “pre-existing DM may predict unfortunate 30
days-in hospital outcome” (18), diabetes mellitus was not found to be a risk factor for death in
patients with COVID-19 (HR 1.3; 95% CI0.86 – 1.9; p< 0.211) despite that 40.8% of patient with
DM were admitted to ICU meanwhile, 29.3% were deceased. In a cohort study of 7337patients
with COVID-19, it was shown that those with type 2 diabetes not only prerequisite augmented
interferences for their stay in hospital versus those that were non-diabetic, but also had an
increased mortality rate(19). In the current study, in contrast with the above-mentioned ones,
we considered DM as a comorbidity when it is self-reported by patient (previous diagnosis and
regular treatment) not on the base line random blood glucose at admission. According to Yan Y.
et al. non- survivors with diabetes had higher levels of leukocyte count, neutrophil count, Creactive protein, pro-calcitonin, ferritin, receptors of interleukin-2, interleukin-6, TNF-α, and
lower lymphocytic count than survivors, which indicated diabetic non-survivors had more sever
inflammatory response(20).
Despite the notable COVID-19 cases presentation with acute cerebrovascular
accidents(23), pre-existing neurological conditions with their wide spectrum of diseases also
related to COVID-19 infection and mortality. One survival analysis in 2070 Brazilian patients
found that a risk of 3.9 times in people with neurologic disease (95% CI 1.9–7.8; P<0.001)(4).
The increased severity of COVID-19 among cases with cerebrovascular illness may be attributed
to coexistence of cerebrovascular diseases with other risk factors such as older age,
cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes mellitus. Besides, the existence of brain medullary

cardiorespiratory or autonomic nervous system dysfunction precipitate to blood pressure
fluctuation and dysfunction in the respiratory system increasing the hazard of acquiring
opportunistic infections. Moreover, the relative immobility in post-stroke patients, increases
the risk for hyper-coagulable state(21).
Among other comorbidities, chronic pulmonary diseases including obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) and moderate to severe bronchial asthma are at higher risk of
sever COVID-19 progression since this virus affects their respiratory tracts, leading to increased
bronchospasm, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress(10). However, in contrast to the
above-mentioned data, another study found that asthma was a protective factor. Asthma may
not be a risk factor because of reduced angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) gene
expression in airway cells of asthma patients that would be expected to decrease the severity
of SARS-CoV-2 infection which uses ACE2 as its cellular receptor(22). We suggest that the
degree of asthma control, medications used for asthma control, difference in patient ages and
the coexisting conditions may explain this disagreement. Besides, a high-quality cohort study
with longer time frame and larger number of patients is needed to explain asthma COVID-19
interaction.
Unfortunately, a smaller number of patients with other comorbidities such as chronic
kidney, liver, metabolic, endocrine, and autoimmune diseases as well as patients with
malignancy were included in this study. However, the highest death rate among all the
comorbid conditions in this study was (38.1%) of patients with kidney diseases. Cases with liver
disorders also had relatively high mortality rate (33.3%). In literatures, the rate of mortality in
COVID-19 patients with CKD and Liver diseases was found to be (53.33%) and (17,65%)
respectively (23). Chronic kidney diseases are associated with dysregulated inflammation,
immune system, and levels of ACE2 receptors in kidneys which may explain the severity and
mortality due to COVID-19 in patients with CKD(23). Worth notice that, in this study, patients
with comorbidities had significantly higher renal function tests together with elevated
inflammatory biomarkers.
Limitations of the study:
a) The retrospective design of the study with the heterogeneity of data recoding in
different hospital sectors, b) the changing treatment protocol and admission policy during the

study period, c) some subjects having more than one underlying comorbidity, and d) by the end
of study some included patients are still admitted with unclear outcome yet.

Conclusion:
Coexistence of cardiovascular comorbid conditions including hypertension or
neurological diseases together with COVID-19 infections carries higher risks of mortality.
However, other comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, chronic pulmonary or kidney diseases
may also contribute to increased COVID-19 severity. Special attention should be taken during
dealing with such cases. Future studies with larger number of patients in wider varieties of
comorbidities and longer duration evaluating their impact on survival are desired.
