ABSTRACT
Considering the massive amount of clinical trial registers aimed to find effective drugs
for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, it is challenging to have a
comprehensive view of which drugs are being studied more extensively and when is
expected that we will have consistent results regarding their effectiveness. This
systematic review included all clinical trials on pharmacological therapy related to
COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 registered at the International Clinical Trials Registry
Platform (WHO-ICTRP) up to April 22, 2020. Clinical trials characteristics (country,
design, sample size, main outcomes, expected completion data, type of participants,
length of the interventions, main outcomes). How many trials and the accumulated
sample size by drug or combination of drugs, and by month in 2020 was depicted. We
identified 412 clinical trials registers addressing the effect of pharmacological
treatments on COVID-19, predominantly from Asia and Europe (42.2% and 31.1% of
clinical trials registers, respectively). The most main outcomes studied were clinical
recovery (54.4% of the clinical trials registers, respiratory recovery (28.2%) mortality
(27.4%), viral load/negativity (20.4%). During 2020, a huge amount of clinical trials are
expected to be completed: 41 trials (60,366 participants) using hydroxychloroquine, 20
trials (1,588 participants) using convalescent’s plasma, 18 trials (6,830 participants)
using chloroquine, 12 trials (9,938 participants using lopinavir/ritonavir, 11 trials
(1,250 participants) using favipiravir, 10 trials ( 2,175 participants) using tocilizumab
and 6 trials (13,540 participants) using Remdesivir. The distribution of the number of
registered clinical trials among the different therapeutic options leads to an excess of
sample size for some and a lack for others. Our data allow us to conclude that by the
end of June we will have results of almost 20 trials involving 40000 patients for
hydroxychloroquine and 5 trials with 4500 patients for remdesivir; however, low
statistical power is expected from the 9 clinical trials testing the efficacy of favipiravir
or the 5 testing tocilizumab, since they will recruit less than 1000 patients each one.

INTRODUCTION
The alarming figures of people that have suffered or died by COVID-19 have elicited
an impressive pressure on public and private institutions to search drug treatments to
prevent and treat the coronavirus. Even the agencies in charge of approving new drugs,
or new indications for existing ones, are under extraordinary pressure that could even
affect their well-deserved prestige as institutions guided solely and exclusively by
scientific rigor in decision-making [1,2]. Investigators and research agencies are
determined not to repeat the main mistake made when facing, in 2014, the West African
Ebola Epidemic, when, although they produced a plethora of experiments plenty of
good intentions, the randomized clinical trials started too late and were not able to
recruit enough patients [3].
The spread of the virus appears to have been controlled in Asia and seems to be
declining in most European and North American countries; moreover, it is anticipated
that summer in the northern hemisphere will significantly reduce the infectivity and
virulence of SARS-CoV-2 [4]. However, since no vaccine is expected to be available
by then, everything seems to indicate that a resurgence of this pandemic will occur in
autumn [5]. As consequence of these hopeless predictions, a desperate race has begun
aimed to demonstrate the efficacy of new drugs, and more urgently, to demonstrate that
drugs already on the market for other clinical indications such as hydroxychloroquine,
remdesivir, azithromycin, etc., are efficacious to manage the SARS-Cov-2 infection
[6,7].
In this context, a synthesis effort is lacking to summarize the characteristics of the
ongoing clinical trials, the expected dates of the completion of the recruitment, where
they are being held, the drugs whose efficacy is being tested and the main outcomes of
these trials. Although there are several databases and registries online, there is a
concern about when we can expect to have results with a sufficient statistical power to
clear up any doubts about the effectiveness of the different therapeutic approaches for
the treatment or prevention of the COVID-19 disease.
The objective of this comprehensive systematic review is to gather and synthesize the
information included in the clinical trial registers of candidate drugs to prevent and treat
COVID-19 according to the pharmacological group and specific drugs name, study
design, main outcomes, number and characteristics of participants recruited, and

expected completion date. In addition, we graphically represent which drugs are most
likely to achieve consistent results over the coming months of 2020.
METHODS
Search strategy
Due to the novelty and importance of COVID-19, information regarding unpublished
trials was systematically searched through the main clinical trial registries. First, we
searched the World Health Organisation - International Clinical Trials Registry
Platform (WHO-ICTRP), updated April 22, 2020, as it includes the following primary
registries: US National Library of Medicine Registry (Clinicaltrials.gov), Australian
New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR), Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry
(ReBec), Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR), Clinical Research Information
Service (CRiS) from the Republic of Korea, Clinical Trials Registry - India (CTRI),
Cuban Public Registry of Clinical Trials (RPCEC), European Clinical Trials Register
(EU-CTR), German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS), Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials
(IRCT), International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Registry
(ISRCTN) and Japan Primary Registries Network (JPRN). Moreover, the US National
Library of Medicine Registry (Clinicaltrials.gov) and ChiCTR, as databases with a
higher number of registers, were thoroughly revised themselves in order to avoid
leaving out any trial. Clinical trial registries analysing the effect of pharmacological
treatments on COVID-19 were eligible. Two authors (AS-L, IS-D) independently
screened the trial registries and extracted relevant information. Discrepancies and
doubts about relevance of the sources were solved by consensus with two more authors
(VM-V, CA-B).
Clinical trial registries selection
The criteria for the inclusion of clinical trials were as follows: (i) participants— patients
with a COVID-19 diagnosis, a close contact with a COVID-19 patient or belonging to a
high-risk exposure group such as health careers; (ii) design—randomized control trials
(RCTs), nonrandomized experimental studies (non-RCTs) (including at least two-arm
pre-post studies), and pilot studies; (iii) type of intervention—studies comparing the
effect of pharmacological approaches as treatment or prevention of COVID-19; and (iv)
outcomes—mortality, respiratory signs and symptoms’ improvement, oxygen therapy,

non-invasive mechanical ventilation [NIMV] and invasive mechanical ventilation
[IMV] or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]), clinical recovery
(unspecified or scored, clinical, laboratory, imaging recovery or hospital stay-related),
viral load/negativity and other outcomes. Furthermore, no restrictions on language,
status or year of publication were applied. The criteria for the exclusion of studies were
as follows: (i) studies performed in children/adolescents; (ii) non-eligible publication
types, such as open-label prospective studies analysing the effect of a pharmacological
treatment in COVID-19 or single-arm experimental pre-post studies; and (iii) studies
including the effect of stem cells or traditional medicine (Chinese, Iranian, etc.).
Data Extraction and analysis
The following data were extracted from each register: (1) sample size; (2) location
(Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America, Oceania or ≥2 continents); age of
participants (general [≥18 years], only adults [18-65 years] or only elderly [≥65 years]);
(3) patients’ status and setting (suspected, confirmed or severe/critical/intensive care
unit [ICU]); (4) allocation type (non-RCT or RCT); (5) number of intervention arms
(two, three or ≥4 arms); (6) comparison group (placebo/control/usual care, other drugs
or both types of comparison groups); (7) phases (I, II, II, IV, I/II, II/III, III/IV); (8)
recruitment status (cancelled, recruitment not started, ongoing, completed); (9)
intervention length (≥4, 5-8, 9-12, >12 weeks); and (10) estimated completion date.
Clinical trials outcomes (mortality, composite respiratory recovery, signs and
symptoms, invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation, composite clinical recovery, unspecified or clinical recovery indexes,
clinical, laboratory or imaging recovery, hospital stay-related, viral load/negativity and
other outcomes) were shown as number and percentage according to the main
pharmacological therapies: (1) antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, remdesivir);
(2)

antimalarial

(hydroxychloroquine,

chloroquine);

(3)

corticosteroids

(methylprednisolone); (4) immunomodulators (tocilizumab, sarilumab); (5) drugs
combinations

(hydroxychloroquine

+

azithromycin,

hydroxychloroquine

+

lopinavir/ritonavir); and (6) others (plasma and other drugs or combinations).
Additionally, the number of trials expected to be completed and the cumulative sample
size expected per month for the year 2020 were shown graphically.

Data extraction was independently performed by two reviewers (IC-R and AEM), and
inconsistencies were solved by consensus of two more authors (VM-V, CA-B). The
agreement rate between reviewers was reported by calculating kappa statistics.
Data sharing
The full dataset will be available in online Mendeley Data, a repository of research data
that allows to assigns a permanent digital object identifier, un such a way that data of
this study can be easily referenced (doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/4rttjzsh4z.1).
RESULTS
We identified 412 clinical trials registers addressing the effect of pharmacological
treatments on COVID-19 (Figure 1), which were conducted in 40 countries,
predominantly from Asia and Europe (42.2% and 31.1% of clinical trials registers,
respectively), being China (26.5%), USA (13.6%), Iran (10.0%) and Spain (8.7%) the
countries with the most registered clinical trials. Clinicals trials sample size ranged
from 10 to 100,000 participants, and most clinical trials registers (91.0%) included
confirmed COVID-19 patients (13.1% severe/critical clinical status) (Table 1).
The estimated study completion date ranged from February 2020 to March 2025.
Regarding their experimental phase, the registers are distributed in percentages as
follows: 2.4%, 1.5%, 26.5% and 29.4% for phases I, II, III and IV respectively. The
remaining 14.3% corresponds with those trials including more than an experimental
phase or that information is not clearly specified in the register. The allocation of
participants to the study groups was done using randomized procedures in the 90.5% of
the clinical registers, and 80.6% included two-arms (being placebo/control or usual care
the most common comparison group). The intervention length ranged from 1 to 13
weeks. On May 1, only 3.2% of the studies have completed the recruitment (Table 1).
Regarding the COVID-19 outcomes studied, clinical recovery was included in the
54.4%, respiratory recovery in the 28.2%, mortality in the 27.4%, viral load/negativity
in the 20.4% and other outcomes in the remaining 13.6%. Furthermore, the most
frequent pharmacological treatment under analysis were: hydroxychloroquine (22.8%),
chloroquine (6.6%), convalescents plasma (6.6%), lopinavir/ritonavir (5.6%),
tocilizumab (4.6%), hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin (4.1%), favipiravir (3.4%),
remdesivir

(2.9%),

methylprednisolone

(2.7%),

sarilumab

(2.4%)

and

hydroxychloroquine + lopinavir/ritonavir (1.9%) (Table 2). Moreover, during 2020,
most of the clinical trials using hydroxychloroquine (41 trials) are expected to be
completed, followed by those using plasma (20 trials), chloroquine (18 trials),
lopinavir/ritonavir (12 trials), favipiravir (11 trials), and tocilizumab (10 trials) (Figure
2).
Regarding the accumulated sample size by treatment, it is expected that during 2020,
the estimated total number of participants to be included in trials with
hydroxychloroquine is 60,366 participants, with lopinavir/ritonavir 9,938, with
chloroquine 6,830, with remdesivir 5,245, with hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin
3,401,

with

tocilizumab

2,175,

with

convalescents

1,588,

with

methylprednisolone 1,292, with favipiravir 1,250, with hydroxychloroquine +
lopinavir/ritonavir 345, and only 60 with sarilumab (Figure 2). Additionally, the
number of participants will significantly increase beyond 2021 for some treatments,
such as hydroxychloroquine (93,630 participants), lopinavir/ritonavir (20,198
participants), remdesivir (13,540 participants), chloroquine (12,160 participants),
sarilumab (2,140 participants) and hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin (1,376
participants). It should be noted that these figures may be underestimated because many
registers did not indicate the estimated completion date, which would increase the
sample size for hydroxychloroquine + lopinavir/ritonavir in 3,915 participants, for
hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin in 2,252 participants, for sarilumab in 2,206, and for
favipiravir in 1,107.

DISCUSSION
The world is currently facing a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic for which there are not
effective therapeutic resources yet available. So much so that most hospitalized patients
with COVID-19 diagnosis have had to receive off-label or compassionate use therapies,
because there were not drugs approved for this disease [8,9]. Because a resurgence of
this pandemic seems likely to happen in the autumn [10], it is urgent to test the
effectiveness of new drugs, or repurposed ones, for preventing and treating the COVID19 disease [11,12]. In this context, this study provides an overview of the characteristics
of the worldwide registered clinical trials until April 22, 2020.

The main characteristics of the registered trials are the following: more than half are
aimed at recovery of clinical or respiratory parameters, are conducted in in China,
Europe and USA, participants are mostly hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID19, have small/moderate sample size, up to 68.0% of trials have not specified the
duration of the intervention in their registers, and up to 34.2% are going to end after the
fall. Moreover, most trials are testing the efficacy of antimalarial drugs, particularly
hydroxychloroquine (alone or in combination with azithromycin or lopinavir/ritonavir)
and chloroquine, followed by the antiviral drugs lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir and
remdesivir. Indeed, substantial interest has been placed in demonstrating the
effectiveness of these specific drugs or drugs combinations [13-15].
The challenge for which most of these clinical trials have been planned is to prevent or
mitigate the devastating impact of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on the world’s health
while an effective vaccine emerges. And the obvious question is whether all this
enormous deployment of research resources will not be a futile and disheartening effort.
If we consider the cumulative sample size, the number of studies and the estimated date
for completing the recruitment of participants for each of the treatment options (Figure
2), the current results seem to indicate that this risk is real. Thus, we can observe that by
the end of June we will most likely to know whether hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine,
remdesivir, or the combinations of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin or
lopinavir/ritonavir are effective to manage COVID-19 cases, because the ongoing trials
will have accumulated, for each of these substances, results from more than 3000
patients, and in some cases as for hydroxychloroquine more than 15000 patients.
Therefore, if the data of the registers are accurately completed, as scheduled many of
the trials to assess the effectiveness of these therapeutic options planning to recruit
patients after June could be cancelled or readapted.
In this context, it is worth highlighting two major recent research initiatives which, in
parallel, aim to produce the same results. The Solidarity Trial [16], sponsored by the
WHO, which will involve more than hundred countries, and almost simultaneously, the
European trial Discovery [17], financed mainly through European institutions and
governments. Both mega-trials are aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Remdesivir,
Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Lopinavir/Ritonavir plus
Interferon beta-1 in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Both are pragmatic trials
and, because of their adaptive design, will allow incorporating new therapeutic options

during their development. Although through meta-analysis techniques the results of
these trials can be synthesized as if they were a unique trial, it seems thoughtful that it
would have been more efficient to coordinate these research efforts, gaining statistical
power and, perhaps, to include some promising therapeutic alternatives not as
extensively examined as favipiravir or tocilizumab.
Finally, the analysis of the data from the 412 clinical trials registered up to April 22,
2020 it can be summarized as follows: i) most of the trials are aimed at repurpose drugs
or combinations of these drugs; ii) for all these therapeutic options the cumulative
sample size seems excessive, albeit at expense of some small clinical trials with
questionable quality in their registers; iii) most likely in June we will have consistent
evidence about the effectiveness of the most promising therapeutic options
(hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir), and with less certainty we will
also know if favipiravir, tocilizumab, methylprednisolone, convalescent’s plasma are
useful to improve the clinical course of the COVID-19 disease; iv) it is unlikely that by
the autumn resurgence of the illness we will have the results of the trials that are testing
the efficacy of new drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Among the limitations of this study it should be acknowledged that: i) the quality of the
registers has not been evaluated due to the lack of a reliable tool for this purpose; ii)
although the WHO-ICTRP is the main database of clinical trial registers and collects
most national and international databases, some trials registered in non-WHO-ICTRP
databases may not have been included; iii) the information collected from each clinical
trial register could be heterogeneous, because each database encodes the information
differently; iv) because of the lack of quality in the description of the sources of funding
in many registers, we have not examined the potential relationship between therapeutic
options and public or private sponsors of the trials; and v) the figures provided relating
number of trials with sample size estimated to be available during 2020 may be
underestimated, because many registers do not indicate the estimated end date of the
trial.
In summary, regardless of whether it is financed by public or private resources, and
especially in this pandemic crisis, research is a public good, and therefore has to be
based on its scientific and social value, in order to produce the scientific evidence
needed by the population, policy makers and, above all, clinicians [18]. For this reason,
it is not justified that predictably by June more than 20 clinical trials enrolling tens of

thousands of patients will finish their recruitment processes testing almost identical
hypotheses, thus neglecting other promising therapeutic hypotheses. Probably, as has
been recently suggested [19], this pandemic context it is the right time to demand from
academic biomedical centres and supranational public health institutions led the
coordination of the research initiatives, otherwise much of the research on the
management of SARS-CoV-2 will be a waste of research resources [20]. Finally, in
view of the low level of precision with which many of the database items have been
recorded, a quality assessment tool for clinical trial records becomes necessary, since
accuracy of these records would predict the risk of bias of the trial’s results.
