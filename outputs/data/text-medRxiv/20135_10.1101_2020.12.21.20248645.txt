Key Points:
•

We report that an association between ACEIs/ARBs with COVID-19 related mortality even
after adjusting for cardiovascular and other comorbidities, as well as medication use.

•

Patients with greater comorbidity burden and laboratory markers reflecting deranged clotting,
renal and liver function, and increased tissue inflammation, and ACEI/ARB use have a higher
mortality risk.

Abstract
Aims: Renin–angiotensin system blockers such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)
and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may increase the risk of adverse outcomes in COVID-19.
In this study, the relationships between ACEI/ARB use and COVID-19 related mortality were
examined.
Methods: Consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by RT-PCR at the Hong Kong Hospital
Authority between 1st January and 28th July 2020 were included.
Results: This study included 2774 patients. The mortality rate of the COVID-19 positive group was
1.5% (n=42). Those who died had a higher median age (82.3[76.5-89.5] vs. 42.9[28.2-59.5] years old;
P<0.0001), more likely to have baseline comorbidities of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, and chronic kidney disease (P<0.0001). They were more frequently prescribed
ACEI/ARBs at baseline, and steroids, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin and hydroxychloroquine during
admission (P<0.0001). They also had a higher white cell count, higher neutrophil count, lower
platelet count, prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, higher
D-dimer, troponin, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase
and alkaline phosphatase (P<0.0001). Multivariate Cox regression showed that age, cardiovascular
disease, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, the use of ACEIs/ARBs and diuretics, and various
laboratory tests remained significant predictors of mortality.
Conclusions: We report that an association between ACEIs/ARBs with COVID-19 related mortality
even after adjusting for cardiovascular and other comorbidities, as well as medication use. Patients

with greater comorbidity burden and laboratory markers reflecting deranged clotting, renal and liver
function, and increased tissue inflammation, and ACEI/ARB use have a higher mortality risk.

Introduction
The use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers
(ARBs) has been associated with poor disease outcomes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
For example, a population-based cohort study from Korea found that ACE-I or ARB therapy in
patients with severe COVID-19 was associated with the occurrence of severe complications and
increased in-hospital mortality [1]. By contrast, other studies did not identify an increased risk of
severe COVID-19 [2, 3] or mortality [4] among patients taking ACEIs or ARBs. A systematic
review and meta-analysis of 33 studies found that ACE inhibitor use was marker of increased
mortality risk in some, but not all, COVID-19 disease settings [5], whilst another found that The risk
of mortality and severe outcomes are also unchanged among COVID-19 patients taking ACEI/ARB
[6]. Nevertheless, prior use of RAAS inhibitors was associated with lower risk mortality from
COVID-19 specifically in patients with hypertension [7]. Given these conflicting findings, we
examined whether the use of ACEIs/ARBs is related to COVID-19 mortality using territory-wide
data from Hong Kong.

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong
Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster. This was a retrospective, territory-wide cohort
study of patients undergoing COVID-19 RT-PCR testing between 1st January and 28th July 2020.
The patients were identified from the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System (CDARS), a
territory-wide database that centralizes patient information from individual local hospitals to
establish comprehensive medical data, including clinical characteristics, disease diagnosis,
laboratory results, and drug treatment details. The system has been previously used by both our team
and other teams in Hong Kong [8-11]. The list of conditions identified is detailed in the
Supplementary Appendix. Patients and the public were not engaged in this study.

Outcomes and statistical analysis
All-cause mortality was the primary outcome for the COVID-19 positive group, with last date of
mortality status on 8th August 2020. Continuous variables were presented as median (95%
confidence interval [CI] or interquartile range[IQR]) and categorical variables were presented as
count (%). The Mann- Whitney U test was used to compare continuous variables. The

χ2 test with

Yates’ correction was used for 2×2 contingency data. Statistical analyses were performed using
RStudio software (Version: 1.1.456) and Python (Version: 3.6).

A total of 2774 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included. Their baseline characteristics
are shown in Table 1. A total of 42 deaths occurred (1.5%) in the 2774 patients who were diagnosed
with COVID-19. Those who died had a higher median age (82.3[76.5-89.5] vs. 42.9[28.2-59.5] years
old), more likely to have baseline comorbidities of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. Moreover, they were more frequently prescribed
ACEI/ARBs at baseline, and steroids, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin and hydroxychloroquine during
admission. Finally, patients who died had a higher white cell count, higher neutrophil count, lower
platelet count, prolonged PT and activated partial thromboplastin time, higher D-dimer, troponin and
lactate dehydrogenase. Moreover, creatinine, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase and
alkaline phosphatase were significantly higher for the mortality group.
Univariate Cox regression was used to identify predictors of mortality in patients who were
positive for COVID-19 (Table 2). This identified age, baseline cardiovascular and renal diseases,
diabetes, hypertension, the use of ACEIs/ARBs, other anti-hypertensive agents, and anti-viral drugs
in COVID-19, as well as various haematology and biochemical tests. On multivariate analysis, age,
cardiovascular disease, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, the use of ACEIs/ARBs and diuretics, and
various laboratory tests remained significant predictors of mortality (Table 3).

Discussion
The main findings of this territory-wide cohort study are that 1) a higher proportion of
ACEI/ARB prescription was observed for the COVID-19 positive compared to COVID-19 negative

group and 2) those who died had a higher median age and more likely to have baseline comorbidities
of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease and 3)

and

hydroxychloroquine during admission.
The relationship between ACEI/ARB use and disease outcomes in COVID-19 has been
investigated. Many of the previous studies have included hospitalized patients only. For example, in
a multi-centre study from China, it was found that in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and
existing hypertension, ACEI/ARB inpatient users had a lower risk of all-cause mortality compared
with nonusers [12]. In our study, we found that in those who died, there was a higher frequency of
patients with ACE inhibitor/ARB use compared to those who remained alive. However, on
multivariate Cox regression, ACEI/ARB use retained its significance for mortality prediction even
after multivariate adjustment for cardiovascular comorbidities and the use of other anti-hypertensive
agents. Nevertheless, the frequency of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease
were also higher in the mortality group. This is in keeping with previous demonstrations that patients
with pre-existing cardio-metabolic comorbidities are at higher risk of severe disease or mortality
[13].
In terms of laboratory findings, prior studies have demonstrated the presence of organ damage in
COVID-19. Indeed, there have been reported associations between elevations in myocardial
biomarkers and mortality [14-16]. Alterations in other laboratory markers that have been associated

with adverse outcomes in COVID-19 include increases in D-dimer levels [17], liver enzymes [18],
neutrophil count [19], activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time [20]. In our study,
we also found that patients who died had a higher white cell count, higher neutrophil count, lower
platelet count, prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, D-dimer,
troponin, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase and
alkaline phosphatase.

Conclusion
Taken together, we report that an association between ACEIs or ARBs with COVID-19 related
mortality even after adjusting for cardiovascular and other comorbidities, as well as medication use.
Our findings suggest that patients with greater comorbidity burden and laboratory markers reflecting
deranged clotting, renal and liver function, and increased tissue inflammation, as well as ACEI/ARB
use have a higher mortality risk.
