Abstract
Asymptomatic but infectious people have been reported in many infectious
diseases. Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic carriers would be a hidden
reservoir of COVID-19.
Aim
This review identifies primary empirical evidence about the ability of
asymptomatic carriers to infect others with COVID-19 pandemic and reflects on
the implications for control measures.
Methods
A systematic review is followed by a narrative report and commentary inclusion
criteria were: studies reporting primary data on asymptomatic or presymptomatic patients, who were considered to have passed on COVID-19
infection; and published in indexed journals or in peer review between January
1 and March 31, 2020.
Results
Nine articles reported on 83 asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic persons.
Conclusions
The evidence confirms COVID-19 transmission from people who were
asymptomatic at the time. A series of implications for health service response
are laid out.

Introduction:
Asymptomatic but infectious people have been reported in many infectious
diseases (Fraser, Riley, Anderson, & Ferguson, 2004; Jartti, Jartti, Peltola,
Waris, & Ruuskanen, 2008). Examples include herpes, cytomegalovirus and
respiratory diseases caused by viruses such as H1N1 or H5N1 influenza
(Fielding, Kelly, & Glass, 2015; Gu et al., 2011; Khanna, Kumar, Gupta, &
Kumar, 2012; Le et al., 2013; Powell et al., 2012). Asymptomatic and presymptomatic people are a reservoir hidden for detection systems.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has infected more than 857 thousand
people globally, resulting in more than 42 thousand deaths in a period of three
months according to John Hopkins website (Dong, Du, & Gardner, 2020).
The Chinese government first reported the infection as pneumonia of unknown
origin in late December 2019; then in late January 2020, the WHO declared the
outbreak a Public Emergency of International Concern, and on 11 March was
elevated the alert level to pandemic (WHO, 2020a, 2020b). The epicentre of the
disease was Wuhan City in Hubei Province in central China. Three
characteristics were identified in the infection: an 83% attack rate declared as
highly alarming, a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in the patients
(ranging from minor symptoms to pneumonia and death) along with evidence of
the virus in a minority without any evidence of symptoms. The infection quickly
spread in China and then cases began to be exported internationally
(Mizumoto, Kagaya, & Chowell, 2020; Wu et al., 2020).
There is increasing evidence supporting the contribution to the spread of
infection by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients with COVID-19. The
speed with which the infection spreads suggests that transmission from
unidentified (because asymptomatic) cases plays a substantial role in the
exponential increase in the number of infected patients. This review seeks
empirical evidence about the presence of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic
carriers in the current COVID-19 pandemic and offers reflections on the
implications in the context of the current measures taken to control it.

Method:
This study reports a systematic literature review, a tabular summary of primary
studies, and a narrative commentary on the implications. Databases searched
were: MEDLINE, PubMed and Google academic (which includes pre- peer
reviewed articles) using search terms “coronavirus”, “COVID-19”,
“asymptomatic patients”, and “pre-symptomatic patients”. Inclusion criteria were
reports of primary data pointing to infection from contact with asymptomatic or
pre-symptomatic persons; publication in indexed journals or in the process of
peer review between January 1 and March 31, 2020. The references of
included articles were scanned for further relevant sources (snowball process).
Publications in English, Spanish, Mandarin and Korean were accepted.

Discussion
This review presents the available evidence that asymptomatic and presymptomatic people can infect others with COVID-19. As for other viral
infections, this may play an essential role in community transmission. The
specific of proactive interventions should be considered during a pandemic that
includes asymptomatic transmission.
Implications for risk management and preparedness
it seems that the lessons learnt from previous pandemics have not been
applied, and countries did not adequately assess the risks, and as a result,
there has been a lack of resources and response plans adequate to save lives
(Anderson, Heesterbeek, Klinkenberg, & Hollingsworth, 2020). The presence of
asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic carriers imposed an extra challenge on how
to protect the public in general and front-line workers from the infection when an
undetected infective person is present. A shortage of medical supplies is not
uncommon in public health emergencies. Therefore, national and international
medical supplies programmes before emergencies arise need to be
strengthened (Wong, Leo, & Tan, 2020).
Implications for healthcare workers protection and health systems
response
Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients are a source of active risk for front
line workers. It imposes an additional challenge to the health system as
undetected patients can spread the infection and affect the level of response (J.
Wang, Zhou, & Liu, 2020). The use of personal protective equipment by all
front-line workers should be mandatory. Shortages of masks, goggles are
unacceptable because the risk of infection and death of these workers may
affect the whole health system response to the community (Schwartz, King, &
Yen, 2020).
Implication for infection modelling and planning.
Mathematical models in the context of COVID-19 have demonstrated their
usefulness in simulating transmission trends, risk assessment, epidemic
development, and the effects of isolation and quarantine (Tang, Xiao, Peng, &
Shen, 2020). However, missing the effect of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic
stages of the disease, introduces errors into prediction models (Gaeta, 2020;
Tian et al., 2020).
Implications for testing approaches
A rapid, systematic and widespread approach to testing is needed to detect new
cases in the community and in front-line workers. Maintaining restrictions in
testing is not the best way to identify asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic
patients (C. J. Wang, Ng, & Brook, 2020). The worst-case scenario is to have
asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic COVID-19 front-line workers because they
can potentially infect vulnerable patients and their families. The testing
approaches must be easily adaptable for the needs of the community and

clusters of interest. The speed of the detection and fast response could be a
critical success factor (MacIntyre & Heslop, 2020) (Ferretti et al., 2020)
Implications for immigration restrictions
Temperature scanners and self-report of symptoms at international airports
must necessarily fail to detect asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients.
Self-isolation plus more systematic testing could prevent undetected
dissemination. A more robust public health response must be developed in the
border.
Special attention needs to be paid to front-line workers in airlines and other
crew members. Asymptomatic patients could be a source of infection to these
people and airline crew who themselves asymptomatic carriers are a risk to
passengers. Airline companies should reflect on how to protect the crew and
minimise the risk of dissemination (Mouchtouri, Dirksen-Fischer, &
Hadjichristodoulou, 2020), probably by routine testing and use of personal
protective equipment.
Implications in social connectedness (physical distance and clusters)
Physical distance is a paramount approach to avoid COVID-19 infection, but the
presence of asymptomatic patients in the community and front-line workers
should be enough reason to wear face mask and goggles in public and
healthcare places. The virus is present in saliva, which could be spread in the
form of exhaled air (over a short distance) or droplets (over a longer distance
(Bourouiba, 2020). At a community level, transmission undetected infective
persons are highly likely.
These strategies should apply until a specific vaccine is available, even if
effective treatments become available first. This pandemic has changed the
way we interact as individuals and how to respond as communities to a severe
challenge to public health. The number of deaths indicates there is substantial
room for improvement is significant in the way governments and global health
organisations need to operate. Next time, we would aim to more rapidly identify
and disseminate information about a cluster of new disease, and a more
coordinated and faster global response could isolate such a cluster and prevent
rapid dissemination to the entire world.
Limitations
Those studies selected in this review had several limitations. Many have a small
sample size. Several studies note the low sensitivity or specificity of available
diagnostic tools; relevant symptoms were difficult to identify in some patients
(for the infant study case in particular); and in some cases, relevant dates were
while there were reporting delays with others. However, given the recent
presentation of this disease and the lack of formal studies in this short period,
this information is relevant to public health policy and protection for populations
and healthcare and other front-line workers.
