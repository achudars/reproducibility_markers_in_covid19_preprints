Abstract

21

22

Background

23

We aimed to further characterize and analyze in depth intra-host variation and founder variants

24

of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide up until August 2020, by examining in excess of 94,000 SARS-

25

CoV-2 viral sequences in order to understand SARS-CoV-2 variant evolution, how these variants

26

arose and identify any increased mortality associated with these variants.

27

Methods and Findings

28

We combined worldwide sequencing data from GISAID and Sequence Read Archive (SRA)

29

repositories and discovered SARS-CoV-2 hypermutation occurring in less than 2% of COVID19

30

patients, likely caused by host mechanisms involved APOBEC3G complexes and intra-host

31

microdiversity. Most of this intra-host variation occurring in SARS-CoV-2 are predicted to

32

change viral proteins with defined variant signatures, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 can be

33

actively shaped by the host immune system to varying degrees. At the global population level,

34

several SARS-CoV-2 proteins such as Nsp2, 3C-like proteinase, ORF3a and ORF8 are under

35

active evolution, as evidenced by their increased πN/πS ratios per geographical region.

36

Importantly, two emergent variants: V1176F in co-occurrence with D614G mutation in the viral

37

Spike protein, and S477N, located in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike protein,

38

are associated with high fatality rates and are increasingly spreading throughout the world. The

39

S477N variant arose quickly in Australia and experimental data support that this variant

40

increases Spike protein fitness and its binding to ACE2.

42

SARS-CoV-2 is evolving non-randomly, and human hosts shape emergent variants with

43

positive fitness that can easily spread into the population. We propose that V1776F and S477N

44

variants occurring in the Spike protein are two novel mutations occurring in SARS-CoV-2 and

45

may pose significant public health concerns in the future.

Author Summary

48

49

We have developed an efficient bioinformatics pipeline that has allowed us obtain the

50

most complete picture to date of how the SARS-CoV-2 virus has changed during the last eight

51

month global pandemic and will continue to change in the near future. We characterized the

52

importance of the host immune response in shaping viral variants at different degrees, evidenced

53

by hypermutation responses on SARS-CoV-2 in less than 2% of infections and positive selection

54

of several viral proteins by geographical region. We underscore how human hosts are shaping

55

emergent variants with positive fitness that can easily spread into the population, evidenced by

56

variants V1176F and S477N, located in the stalk and receptor binding domains of the Spike

57

protein, respectively. Variant V1176 is associated with increased mortality rates in Brazil and

58

variant S477N is associated with increased mortality rates over the world. In addition, it has been

59

experimentally demonstrated that S477N variant increase fitness of Spike protein and its binding

60

with ACE2, thus predicting to increase virulence of SARS-CoV-2. This limits the concept of

61

‘herd immunity’ proposals and re-emphasize the need to limit the spread of the virus to avoid

62

emergence of more virulent forms of SARS-CoV-2 that can spread worldwide.

Introduction

64

The novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID19 has surpassed 34 million

65

infections worldwide within nine months of pandemic, resulting in more than one million deaths

66

until September 2020 (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) (1). In-depth characterization of

67

this virus is urgently needed to improve outbreak surveillance, vaccine development and for

68

effective treatments now and in the immediate future. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive single-stranded

69

RNA virus (+ssRNA) with a crown-like appearance observed by electron microscopy that is due

70

the presence of the of spike glycoproteins on the lipid bilayer envelope (2, 3). Another three

71

transmembrane proteins are incorporated into the envelope: small envelope protein (E), matrix

72

protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N) (4). As seen with SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 binds

73

through its Spike glycoprotein to cell membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2

74

(ACE2) for entry into host cells (5-8). Advancements in COVID19 treatments have been recently

75

developed including Remdesivir, a nucleoside analog that inhibits viral RNA-dependent RNA

76

polymerase and is an effective treatment to reduce viral titers in rhesus macaques that is

77

clinically approved for COVID19 treatment (9). As well, either wild-type or catalytically

78

inactive ACE2 has been demonstrated to block viral entry in vitro, and are proposed as

79

promising treatments (10, 11). A remaining question is how the human humoral immune

80

response develops after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies in Iceland have shown that around 90%

81

of infected patients develop antiviral antibodies that last up to four months (12), but it has also

82

been suggested that around one third of the seropositive infections are asymptomatic and become

83

antibody-negative early in the convalescence period (13). Also, the unexpectedly low secondary

84

infection risk reported for SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests innate immune responses are active

85

in humans (14, 15). To explore host– SARS-CoV-2 interactions at the genetic level it is useful to

86

analyze viral sequencing results per individual and at the population level. Initiatives such as

87

GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) (16, 17) and the Sequence Read Archive (SRA,

88

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) have been storing SARS-CoV-2 sequencing datasets

89

worldwide from the beginning of the pandemic starting in January 2020, allowing researchers to

90

track fixed variants and follow viral evolution by geographical region. The unprecedented

91

amount of SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing data can help to 1) characterize viral variants

92

that occur within a given host, 2) understand variant fixation in a given population and 3)

93

understand how the virus changes over time. In fact, the Spike protein mutation D614G global

94

transition that occurred very recently was discovered in this way and is associated with higher

95

viral titers and higher fatality rates (18, 19). Thus, it is probable that more mutations are to be

96

discovered by tracking SARS-CoV-2 genomic changes globally. In this study we aimed to

97

characterize in depth intra-host variation and population-fixed variants worldwide up until the

98

beginning of August 2020 by using over 76,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences and 17,500 sequencing

99

datasets from GISAID and SRA repositories, respectively. First, we found evidence for SARS-

100

CoV-2 hypermutation, occurring in less than 2% of COVID19 patients. This mechanism is

101

predicted to inactivate the virus and is likely caused by host mechanisms involved APOBEC3G

102

complexes and intra-host microdiversity, where G>T transversions and C>T transitions are

103

frequent signatures observed both in hypermutant and non-hypermutant samples. These results

104

suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is actively shaped by the host immune system to varying degrees.

105

From a population context, several SARS-CoV-2 proteins such as Nsp2, 3C-like proteinase,

106

ORF3a and ORF8 are under active evolution, evidenced by their increasing πN/πS ratios.

107

Noteworthy, most of the population-fixed variants in SARS-CoV-2 are predicted to destabilize

108

viral proteins, as already reported for other RNA viruses. Of these variants, those occurring in

109

the ORF3a (Q57H), Nucleocapsid (I292T, RG203KR) and Spike protein (V1176F) have a

110

positive association with increased mortality ratios in populations from Saudi-Arabia and Brazil,

111

respectively. In particular, the V1176F variant co-occurs with the D614G mutation in the Spike

112

protein mutation in Brazil and arose independently in at least in three independent SARS-CoV-2

113

clades. This variant is predicted to stabilize the SARS-CoV-2 Spike trimmer complex and confer

114

flexibility to the stalk domain of the trimmer, potentially facilitating Spike binding properties to

115

ACE2. Also, this variant is associated with increased mortality ratios in Brazil and is

116

increasingly spreading throughout the world. Similarly, the emerging variant S477N occurring in

117

the Receptor Binding Domain, dramatically increase its frequency and became dominant in

118

Australia within two months. Experimental data support that S477N increase both fitness and

119

binding to ACE2 receptor, explaining its selection among other viruses in Australia. S477N also

120

is presently spreading across countries and is associated with higher fatalities throughout the

121

world. We propose that these variants are novel mutations occurring in SARS-CoV-2 and their

122

spread may pose serious concerns in public health in the future of the pandemic.

Next-generation sequencing and FASTA dataset processing

141

To process next generation sequencing datasets, we employed our pipeline (SARS-CoV-

142

2_freebayes) consisting in a bash/UNIX script that pipes several programs in sequential order.

143

Imputed list of SRA accessions is processed with sra-tools, https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools),

147

BAM files were sorted and indexed by using Samtools (22). Freebayes, as frequency-based

148

pooled caller (-F 0.49) (https://github.com/ekg/freebayes) (23) perform variant calling on every

149

sorted BAM file, obtaining major frequency viral variants per genome in VCF format,. Then, the

150

Jacquard program (https://jacquard.readthedocs.io/en/v0.42/index.html) in python environment

151

(24) merges every VCF file containing variants associated to each bam file into a single VCF

152

file, containing aggregated variants from all genomes. Viral frequencies were recalculated in the

153

merge VCF file by using several UNIX tools (25), in combination with vcflib

154

(https://github.com/vcflib/vcflib).

155

“logfile_variants_SRA_freebayes” were used to construct Figure 1B using GraphPad Prism 8

156

software (https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/). GISAID FASTA genomes

157

were processed in a similar manner. We preprocess a single GISAID genome collection with

158

SeqKit (26) to decompose a single FASTA file into individual FASTA files, each file containing

159

a single genome. Then, Minimap2 aligner with preset -ax asm5 (21) align every FASTA genome

160

against SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. Freebayes variant caller with --min-alternate-count 1 (C

161

1) option (https://github.com/ekg/freebayes) perform variant calling on each BAM file,

162

outputting variants in VCF format. With these operations, major frequency viral variants in VCF

163

format are obtained from each FASTA genome. Then, variants are aggregated into a single VCF

164

file, as described with Jacquard. Figure 1A graph was constructed by using variants per genome,

(Brazil, Scottland, USA, Australia, and Gibraltar, respectively). MAFFT multiple sequence

223

alignment program version 7.271 (36, 37) was used to align FASTA sequences against Wuhan-

224

Wu-1 reference genome (GenBank Accession: MN908947.3) by using the --auto --thread -1 --

259

variant V1176F was modelled by using Foldx5, as previously described in the Free energy

260

261

and F1176 variant trimmers were subjected to molecular dynamics by using GROMACS/2020.3

263

infrastructure LEFTRARU NLHPC (ECM-02), allocating one node with total 44 cores (logical)

264

and one compatible GPU (NVIDIA Tesla V100-PCIE-16GB). The trajectories were visualized

Statistical analysis

310

All statistical analyses were carried out by using GraphPad Prism 8 software

311

(https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/). Mann-Whitney test was employed to

312

test data following non normal distribution. The significance thresholds were the following:

313

P<0.05 *, P<0.01 **, P<0.001 ***, P>0.05 ns. We interpreted Spearman nonparametric

314

correlations analyses as follows: perfect correlation (1), the two variables tend to increase or

315

decrease together (0 to 1), The two variables do not vary together at all (0), One variable

316

increases as the other decreases (-1 to 0), and perfect inverse correlations (-1). We computed an

317

approximate P value because in all correlations we employed more than 17 pair values. The

318

significance thresholds were the following: P<0.05 *, P<0.01 **, P<0.001 ***, P<0.0001 ****,

319

P>0.05 ns. We employed robust regression and outlier removal (ROUT) method (58) to remove

330

Worldwide Intra-host variation in SARS-CoV-2 genomes reveal microdiversity and

331

hypermutation likely elicited by APOBEC3G/ADAR complexes.

332

To trace intra-host viral variation worldwide, we downloaded and analyzed 76,553

333

SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences available in the GISAID database up until August 3, 2020

334

(Supplementary Table 1, see Acknowledgements in Supplementary Table 2). We also

335

downloaded and analyzed 17,560 next-generation sequencing datasets from Sequence Read

336

Archive (SRA) available until July 28, 2020 (Supplementary Table 3). SARS-CoV-2 genomes

337

from GISAID accounted for the presence of major viral frequency variants (via a consensus

338

calling approach) and the next-generation sequencing datasets (NGS) also allowed us to analyze

339

intra-host microdiversity given the depth of sequencing. By analyzing the occurrence of major

340

viral alleles per SARS-CoV-2 genome, both sources consistently demonstrate on average 7-8

341

viral variants with major alleles per genome (viral frequency > 0.5) (see “mean” in Figure 1A

342

and 1B, for SRA and GISAID datasets, respectively), demonstrating that our variant calling

343

pipeline is reliable to call major viral alleles from FASTA and NGS datasets, respectively (see

344

https://github.com/cfarkas/SARS-CoV-2-freebayes). The distribution from both sources also

345

identified outliers with more than 16 viral sequence variants per genome including some samples

346

harboring more than 100 variants per genome, greatly surpassing the average (2% and 0.3% in

347

SRA and GIDAID sequencing datasets, see “outliers” in Figure 1A and 1B, respectively, Q=1%

348

Grubbs's test). Integrative genomics viewer (IGV) snapshots of outlier samples from Spain, USA

349

and Australian sequencing datasets clearly show hypermutability to varying degrees (see samples

350

with black arrows, Figure 1C). Australian outlier samples represent an extreme case of

351

hypermutability (see Figure 1C, bottom). 16,307 aggregated variants from SRA datasets reflect

352

most recurrent single nucleotide substitutions occurring in all genomes from SRA repository are

353

enriched by the C>U (C>T) transitions and G>T (G>U) transversions, changes already reported

354

for SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV genomes (59) and is likely elicited by APOBEC deaminases,

355

as already reported (60). (Figure 1D, left). The latter observation is also consistent for genomes

356

containing outlier number of variants from SRA (Figure 1D, right). Most of the nucleotide

357

substitutions harboring outlier samples from Figure 1C correspond to missense/nonsense variants

358

rather than silent variants (Figure 1E) and are enriched in C>T (C>U) changes as well,

359

consistent with latter observations (Figure 1F). Also, G>T (G>U) transversions are significantly

360

present, implying a different mechanism than APOBEC3G editing and likely exerted by ADAR

361

deaminase (see discussion). We estimated intra-host nucleotide diversity occurring in 397, 374

362

and 215 next generation sequencing samples from Australia, Spain and USA populations,

363

respectively by using aligned reads per sample against the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome

364

(Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank Accession: MN908947.3). This calculation has been already validated

365

to capture intra-host viral microdiversity, overcoming sequencing errors (61). In the three

366

populations, average nucleotide diversity positively correlates with the number of Single

367

Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) with viral frequencies over 5% (Spearman correlation, r values from

368

0.32-0.66, P<0.0001). The latter supports the existence of intra-host minor variants and therefore

369

SARS-CoV-2 quasi-species, coexisting within the same host (62-65) (Figure 1G). We

370

hypothesized the existence of hypermutants can be explained by APOBEC3G/ADAR-mediating

371

RNA editing at early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection (C>U and A>G editing) accompanied by

372

intra-host diversity, i.e. low frequency variance and homoplasy (different viral lineages emerged

373

after the infection) that probably are maintained at low frequency due the virus error correction

machinery (Figure 1H). Overall, we propose that human hosts substantially contribute to shape

375

SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity. Although microdiversity is probably one of the main sources of

376

SARS-CoV-2 evolution, this is accompanied by RNA-editing at different levels, with SARS-

377

CoV-2 RNA hypermutation as an extreme case of the latter.

378

Non-neutral codon changes actively shape evolution of several SARS-CoV-2 proteins

379

We next analyzed all intra-host major viral alleles occurring in SARS-CoV-2 genomes

380

worldwide, by using the GISAID consensus called variants. 23,269 aggregated variants from

381

GISAID demonstrate that overall, C>U and A>G edition are the predominant nucleotide changes

382

(Figure 2A), also present in GISAID samples with outlier number of variants per genome

383

(Figure 2B). These changes are consistent with nucleotide changes occurring in SRA sequencing

384

datasets (see Figure 1D) and with the APOBEC3G-mediating RNA editing mechanisms. To

385

deduce aminoacid changes as consequences of these nucleotide changes, we analyzed codon

386

changes occurring in the aggregated GISAID variants and we predicted its consequences by

387

using the SnpEff program (30). Occurrences per variant type demonstrate that missense and

388

synonymous variant occurrences are more frequent compared to frameshift/nonsense variant

389

occurrences per genome (Figure 2C). Overall, missense/silent ratio of GISAID aggregated

390

variants is 1.82, revealing a greater diversity in missense variants as well (Supplementary

391

Figure 1). Consequently, codon change analysis demonstrates frequent non-neutral changes in

392

the second position of the codons ACA>ATA, ACT>ATT and GCT>GTT and leads to missense

393

variants Thr>Ile and Ala>Val, respectively. Also, non-neutral changes in the first position of

394

codons CTT>TTT and GTT>TTT are frequent, leading to Leu>Phe and Val>Phe changes,

395

respectively (Figure 2D). Almost all these changes can be explained by C>T (C>U) transition,

396

already reported for SARS-CoV-2 protein changes. To understand these changes at the global

397

population level, we calculated nucleotide diversity in nonsynonymous (πN) and synonymous

398

(πS) sites of every SARS-CoV-2 protein across six different populations (Asia, Oceania, Europe,

399

Africa, North America, and South America) by using GISAID genomes per geographical region.

400

A given protein is evolving by natural selection if the πN/πS ratio is over one. Conversely, if

401

πN/πS ratio is less than one, a given protein is considered to be undergoing purifying selection,

402

as previously described (66-68). An excess of shared nonsynonymous changes (implying

403

positive natural selection) is present in non-structural proteins nsp2, nsp7, 3C-like proteinase,

404

ORF3a and ORF8, respectively (Figure 2E). Conversely, purifying selection is present in the

405

RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, Membrane protein (M), 3’-to 5’-exonuclease, non-structural

406

proteins nsp3 and nsp4, respectively. Remarkably, ORF6 and to a lesser extent the Spike protein

407

(S) of SARS-CoV-2 are actively evolving in South America.

408

V1176F variant occurring in the Spike protein is predicted to improve fitness of Spike

409

protein complex and is likely a novel SARS-CoV-2 mutation associated with increased

410

mortality

411

We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 fixed alleles shared with at least a 3% variant frequency (VF)

412

in one of the five referred to continental populations until August 3, 2020. The merge

413

encompassed 51 variants. Consistent with intra-host variation, more than half of these changes

414

lead to missense variants. Non-structural proteins nsp2, nsp3, nsp6 and nsp7 harbors Leu>Phe

415

and Thr>Ile as frequent changes as seen in SARS-CoV-2 codon changes frequencies (Figure

416

3A). Also, consistent with the increased observed πN/πS ratios per population, ORF3a and ORF8

417

display missense variants with high viral frequencies. Some variants are shared among

418

populations with high viral frequencies, such as D614G variant in Spike protein, P323L variant

419

in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and RG203KR variant in Nucleocapsid. Of these, D614G

420

variant in the Spike protein fulfill the category of mutation since this variant is positively

421

associated with mortality and increases SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, as previously reported (18, 19,

422

69). As D614G was a rapidly emergent variant, this suggests novel emergent variants can also be

423

mutations. Of importance, two more novel missense variants occurring in the Spike protein

424

(S477N and V1176F) are exclusively from Oceania and South America (Figure 3A, red

425

variants). To gain understanding of the effects of these variants, we calculated the Gibbs’ free

426

energy associated with the variant changes (ΔΔG; ΔGwild-type – ΔGvariant) from all missense

427

variants listed in Figure 3A using SARS-CoV-2 protein structures generated by the C-I-TASSER

428

pipeline as inputs for the Foldx5 program (42-47). While most of the changes are predicted to be

429

neutral or slightly stabilizing/destabilizing, there are more changes predicted to be energetically

430

unfavorable rather than favorable, such as occurring in the RNA-polymerase (A97V), ORF3a

431

(G251V) and Nucleocapsid (I292T). Conversely, other changes occurring in the non-structural

432

proteins nsp3 (T1198K), nsp4 (F308Y) and Spike protein (D614G, V1176F) are predicted to

433

stabilize these proteins (Figure 3B). The emergent V1176F variant, containing the recurrent

434

signature Val>Phe (Figure 2D) is located at the stalk domain of Spike protein, specifically at the

435

beginning of the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domain (70). In agreement with a recent report, the

436

D614G variant has a mildly stabilizing effect on protein stability but also alters protein dynamics

437

according to mCSM-PPI2 analysis, since the predicted affinity change of the spike protein

438

trimmer decreases (71). Conversely, the V1176F variant is predicted to increase affinity of the

439

Spike protein trimmer (Figure 3C, upper right). Molecular dynamics simulations of the stalk

440

domain trimmer demonstrate larger amplitude motions, since Root-mean-square deviations

441

(RMSD) from wild-type stalk domain trimmer fluctuates in ~1 nm (10 Å) over 20 nanoseconds

442

of simulation. The V1176F variant increases this value after the same settings, increasing

443

motility of the domain trimmer (~1.4 nm, Figure 3C middle right). Also, the V1176F induces

444

compactness of Stalk domain trimmer in ~0.52 nm (5 Å) (Figure 3C low right) (72). Thus, the

445

V1176F variant confers more flexibility to the Stalk trimmer domain. These observations agree

446

with a recent report demonstrating extensive flexibility of this domain composed by three hinges

447

in the pre-fusion model of the Spike protein, potentially necessary for enhanced binding

448

mechanics with ligands such ACE2 (73). Of note, up until September 25, 2020 Brazil was the

449

country with the highest frequency of genomes containing the V1176F variant, that was

450

completely linked to the D614G mutation (Figure 3D). We also found four additional regions

451

that present increasing cumulative distributions of genomes containing V1176F, including

452

Scotland, USA, Australia, and Gibraltar that have occurred during global travel bans/restrictions

453

(Figure 3E). Indeed, phylogenetic tree analysis containing genomes from Figure 3E demonstrate

454

V1176F variant arose independently in clades G (containing S: D614G mutation), clade GH

455

(containing ORF3a: Q57H variant) and clade GR (containing N: RG203KR variant) (Figure

456

3F). The predominant clade GR contain genomes from Brazil, Scotland, and Gibraltar while

457

clade GH is represented exclusively of genomes from USA. Clade G is also present in Brazil and

458

Scotland. Overall, this analysis suggests community transmission spread of V1176F occurred

459

from independent sources rather than from a single source arising from travel. To correlate if this

460

variant has an associated phenotype, we downloaded 7634 genomes with associated metadata

461

from GISAID until September 28, 2020 and we grouped the genomes from released/deceased

462

patients per country/region. Then, we performed Fisher's exact test and identified variants with a

463

significant difference in the viral frequencies between the groups (snpFreq program, available in

464

the Galaxy server) (31, 35). Interestingly, a novel variant in the spike protein (QD613HG),

465

leading to D614G mutation and variants occurring in the ORF3a (Q57H) and Nucleocapsid

466

(RG203KR), are positively correlated with increased mortality ratios in Saudi-Arabia (Figure

467

3H). In Brazil, the D614G mutation along with the V1176F emergent variant in the Spike protein

468

are also positively correlated with increased mortality ratios, including variants occurring in the

469

nsp7, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and two emergent variants in South America occurring

470

in the ORF6 and the nucleocapsid proteins (I33T and I292T variants, respectively, Figure 3A,

471

Figure 3G). The RG203KR variants occurring in the Nucleocapsid was also found in Brazil.

472

Four out seven of these variants occurring in Brazil (nsp7: L71F, S: V1176F, ORF6: I33T and N:

473

I292T) are also positively correlated with increased mortality when comparing deceased patients

474

versus Released + Hospitalized patients, suggesting these variants are robustly correlated with

475

increased mortality in Brazil (Figure 3H). Of note, the V1176F variant arose independently and

476

is not ligated to the I292T variant occurring in the Nucleocapsid (Supplementary Table 4).

477

Thus, among emergent SARS-CoV-2 variants in Brazil, we prioritize the V1176F variant for

478

further experimental study since it likely arose independently across SARS-CoV-2 clades in

479

different countries, is predicted to improve fitness of the Spike protein and correlates with

480

increased mortality ratios in Brazil.

481

Variant S447N occurring in the Spike protein is a novel mutation that increases Spike-

482

ACE2 binding and is associated with higher worldwide fatality rates.

483

We next addressed whether the referred variants are associated with higher mortality

484

ratios in Brazil and Saudi-Arabia, as well as other emergent variants in the Spike protein, are

485

correlated with higher fatality ratios worldwide until September 28, 2020. Among the refereed

486

variants, the I292T variant occurring in the nucleocapsid is associated with higher fatality rates

487

across several countries (p<0.033, Spearman correlation, Figure 4A, Supplementary Table 5).

Eleven variants occurring in the Spike protein were present in more than four countries and out

489

of them, variants A222V, S477N and E780Q are positively correlated with increased fatality

490

ratios. These findings are consistent with previous reports for the D614G mutation that is also

491

positively correlated with higher fatality ratios (Figure 4B) (19). The V1176F variant was not

492

found to be correlated with increased fatality ratios across the world, probably due to highly

493

unbiased viral frequencies across the world. Up until August 3, 2020, the S477N spike variant

494

that emerged in Oceania (Australia) had a low viral population frequency (~ 3.5%, Figure 3A)

495

along with the A222V variant being absent or maintained at a very low frequency. However, a

496

dramatic increase of cumulative genomes was observed between the months June and July 2020

497

for both variants, not seen for the I292T variant occurring in the nucleocapsid (Figure 4C). The

498

rapid emergence of the S477N and A222V variants correlates with the recent second wave of

499

COVID19 that has occurred in Australia and the United Kingdom (Figure 4D, left and right,

500

respectively). Nevertheless, this rapid increase in the population frequencies of these variants

501

could be due to the founder effect usually seen in outbreaks, and not due increased fitness of

502

SARS-CoV-2 (see countries in Figure 4B, A222V and S477N, respectively) (69). To discard the

503

former founder effect, we examined GISAID clade frequency of both variants, demonstrating

504

variant A222V arose independently in all major SARS-CoV-2 clades (74) and variant S477N

505

arose in clades G, GH and GR, respectively (Figure 4E, upper and lower, respectively). Variant

506

A222V occurred in the N-terminal domain of the Spike protein (light brown domain, Figure 4F,

507

left) and variant S477N occur in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike protein

508

(purple domain, Figure 4F, left). This variant is located near the interface between ACE2 and

509

the RBD, the latter is expected to cause enhanced binding of the RBD to the ACE2 human

510

receptor (Figure 4F, right). We replaced serine for asparagine in position 477 in the RBD

511

(complexed with ACE2 dimer) with foldx (46), and we calculated the predicted binding energy

512

upon this change by using mCSM-PPI2 server (49). The change is predicted to add one more

513

polar interaction when asparagine is present in the RBD, increasing the affinity between RBD

514

and ACE2 (Figure 4G). We examined the deep mutational scanning of amino acid changes in

515

the RBD performed by Starr et al (75) in a high throughput yeast-surface-display system for

516

measuring expression of folded RBD protein and its binding to ACE2 (76). Among fourteen

517

variants occurring in the RBD, only variant S477N increased both expression of the RBD, a

518

parameter positively correlated with folding (Figure 4H) and its binding to ACE2, respectively

519

(Figure 4I). The combination of these two properties can lead to the generation of a more

520

infectious viruse, explaining to a large extent the dramatic increase of the S477N variant in

521

Australia.

522

In conclusion, we have obtained evidence that the S477N variant is a gain of function mutation

523

occurring in the Spike protein, that is positively correlated with increased fatality rates and is

524

becoming dominant as its increases, as was also recently observed for the D614G mutation that

525

became dominant throughout the world (18).

Discussion

530

In this study we aimed to analyze over 94,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences deposited between

531

GISAID and SRA databases within the first eight months of this pandemic (up until the

532

beginning of August 2020). We characterized the existence of intra-host viral hypermutation that

533

results in an excessive number of variants per genome in less than 2% of SARS-CoV-2

534

sequences (Figure 1A and 1B, respectively). This phenomenon was already described for HIV-1

535

virus in vivo, demonstrating that HIV-1 reverse transcriptase contributed only to 2% of

536

mutations, and the majority was caused by host cytidine deaminases of the A3 family mediated

537

editing (77). Here, we present evidence that enzymatic RNA editing in combination with

538

microdiversity contributes to SARS-CoV-2 diversity at a global level, leading to more than

539

23,000 major viral frequency variants within 76,000 GISAID genomes. In SARS-CoV-2

540

genomes, the C>T (C>U) transversion is substantially present both in hypermutants and non-

541

hypermutant samples, suggesting APOBEC3G mediated RNA editing involvement, as

542

previously reported in smaller sample sizes (59, 60). Also, the A>G transversion is also present

543

overall but not in hypermutant genomes (Figures 1D, 2A and 2B, respectively), implying an

544

active role of ADAR deaminases during SARS-CoV-2 infection (78). We argue ADAR-

545

mediating RNA editing is not the main enzyme involved in the hypermutation mechanism, but

546

rather APOBEC3G deaminase complexes. Also, we have observed substantial G>T transversions

547

in SARS-CoV-2 genomes. This transversion has been already reported for other RNA viruses

548

such as Maize streak virus (79) and is has been linked with the formation of 8-oxoguanine,

549

known to be the most common cause of spontaneous G>T (G>U) transversions in RNA (80).

550

Recently, it has been reported that tissue damage from neutrophils induces oxidative stress upon

551

SARS-CoV-2 infection (81), implying that reactive oxidative species (ROS) mediated

552

mutagenesis is likely the mechanism that cause this transversion. The hypermutated SARS-CoV-

553

2 variant signature often contains nonsense variants that are predicted to inactivate several

554

SARS-CoV-2 proteins, probably leading to an efficient mechanism of lethal mutagenesis to

555

control viral spread (Figure 1E). In addition, other signatures are present at the intra-host level,

556

implying microdiversity as another potential source of this variation (Figure 2A and 2B,

557

respectively). It is possible that these combined forces produce quasi-species of viruses with

558

enough sequence diversity that may influence viral pathogenesis and drive SARS-CoV-2

559

evolution, sometimes also leading to viral extinction (82, 83). Overall, we propose that human

560

host are major drivers of SARS-CoV-2 diversity rather than the virus itself, evidenced by the

561

levels of intra-host variation and hypermutation at different degrees, both fueled by enzymatic

562

RNA-editing mechanisms. We support the latter with the observed non-random signatures of

563

nucleotide changes in these mechanisms, and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 error-correction

564

machinery, not seen in other RNA viruses. Although we found a significant amount of intra-host

565

variation in SARS-CoV-2, neutral evolutionary theory predicts most of these variants as having

566

no or neutral effects (84). Nevertheless, positive, or negative selection can occur within-

567

populations on viral variants, by conferring advantageous properties to viruses that ultimate lead

568

to mutations. Here we have demonstrated positive natural selection of several SARS-CoV-2

569

proteins per population, occurring in nsp2, nsp7, 3C-like proteinase, ORF3a and ORF8 proteins

570

and we highlighted mutations in the Spike protein, evolving in South America (Brazil, V1176F)

571

and Oceania (Australia, S477N). To begin to understand how these variations may affect their

572

encoded proteins, we assessed their structural consequences in protein models that demonstrate

573

that these variants tend to cause more unfavorable than favorable energetic changes. This

574

phenomenon has been observed in the spectrum of variants occurring in the RBD of the Spike

575

protein, proving that most of the variants occurring in the RBD constraints its folding and

27

576

binding to ACE2 (75). In the case of SARS-CoV-2, immunological pressure from host could

577

lead to this type of phenomena as well and is consistent with the observed number of intra-host

578

missense over synonymous variants, respectively. Conversely, we found missense variant

579

V1176F, occurring in the Spike protein, is predicted to be energetically favorable and confers

580

flexibility to the Stalk domain of the viral Spike protein trimmer, previously described to be

581

important for Spike protein flexibility and binding to ACE2 (73). Phylogenetic analysis

582

demonstrated V1176F variant likely emerged in South America and arose independently in

583

several countries associated with the D614G mutation, suggesting that this variant is being

584

positively selected among others occurring in the Spike protein (Figure 3F). This variant is also

585

correlated with higher mortality ratios (Figure 3G and 3H, respectively) and it is possible that it

586

increases the fitness of SARS-CoV-2 infection by conferring flexibility to the stalk domain of the

587

spike protein. The same conclusions applied to variant S477N, occurring in the RBD of the

588

Spike protein: is energetically favorable in RBD-ACE2 binding and favor expression of the

589

RBD, with the latter conclusions being experimentally supported. This mutation also arose

590

independently in a noticeably short period of time and become dominant in Australia within two

591

months (Figure 4D). In addition, the S477N variant is constantly spreading across European

592

countries (Figure 4B) and correlates with higher mortality ratios. These observations provide

593

strong evidence that the S477N variant is a novel gain of function Spike protein mutation, as has

594

recently been demonstrated for the D614G mutation (18). We argue that the constant spread of

595

V1176F and S477N variants over the world ultimately may lead to a further significant concern

596

in public health, due to their association with higher mortality rates.

597

A remaining question is the association of higher fatality rates of the A222V variant occurring

598

in the N-terminal domain of the Spike protein, and the I292T variant occurring in the

28

599

Nucleocapsid, among others. It is possible that these variants can confer antigenic escape, since

600

recently, it has been registered that a reinfection case containing A222V and D614G mutations

601

has occurred (85). Nucleocapsid variation has also been documented in the nucleoprotein of the

602

influenza virus (86) (87) and nucleocapsid of the hepatitis virus (88). Both RNA viruses escape

603

cellular immunity by these mechanisms and could also be the case for SARS-CoV-2.

604

In summary, we have presented potential molecular mechanisms that help researchers to

605

understand variation diversity fueled natural selection in SARS-CoV-2. It is important to

606

continue to track emergent viral variants with the bioinformatics tools developed and highlighted

607

in this manuscript since the evidence presented here lead us to propose V1776F and S477N

608

variants are novel SARS-CoV-2 mutations, due to their positive correlations with increased

609

fatality ratios, as previously evidenced with D614G mutation occurring in the Spike protein.

610

Further conclusions concerning the effects of these variants on viral fitness and host mortality

611

will be accomplished by future structure-function based studies using viral Spike protein mutants

612

and studying effects on viral entry and in vivo rodent models expressing the human ACE2

613

receptor.

grey color, obtained with EzMol server. (Right) Magnification of the interaction between the

747

RBD (purple) with ACE2 dimer (blue and red structures, respectively) showing the contact

surfaces. Variant N477 and its surface is depicted in red. The image was rendered in the EzMol

749

server. G) Polar interactions of S477 (left, wild type) and N477 (right, mutant) depicted by

750

discontinued lines in the RBD. The polar amino acid interactions of S477 and N477, including

751

the predicted ΔΔG (affinity, kcal/mol) between the wild-type or mutant RBD with ACE2 dimer

752

were obtained by using the mCSM-PPI2 server. Positive values of ΔΔG indicate increasing

753

affinity between the RBD and ACE2 dimer. H) Expression fitness of fourteen emergent variants

754

occurring in the RBD domain of the spike protein (see Supplementary Figure 2), measured by

755

high throughput yeast-surface-display system. Expression measurements were plotted as the

756

difference in log-mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) relative to wild-type (ΔlogMFI =

757

logMFIvariant - logMFIwild-type). Positive values (blue) indicate higher RBD expression,
