Abstract (300)
Introduction
Singing for Lung Health (SLH) is a popular arts-in-health activity for people with long-term respiratory
conditions, which participants report provides biopsychosocial benefits, however research on impact
is limited. The ‘SHIELD trial’, a randomised controlled, single (assessor) blind, trial of 12 weeks SLH vs
usual care for people with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (n=120) was set-up to help
to address this. The first group started face-to-face (5 sessions) before changing to online delivery (7
sessions) due to COVID-19 related physical distancing measures. As such, the experience of this group
is here reported as a pilot study to inform further research in this area.
Methods
We conducted semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis regarding barriers, facilitators and
key considerations regarding transitioning from face-to-face to online delivery. Pilot quantitative
outcomes include attendance, pre and post measures of quality of life and disease impact (SF-36, CAT
score), breathlessness (MRC breathlessness scale, Dyspnoea-12), depression (PHQ9), anxiety (GAD-7),
balance confidence (ABC scale) and physical activity (clinical visit PROactive physical activity in COPD
tool, combining subjective rating and actigraphy).
Results
Attendance was 69% overall, (90% of the face-to-face sessions, 53% online sessions). Analysis of
semi-structured interviews identified three themes regarding participation in SLH delivered face-toface and online, these where 1) perceived benefits; 2) digital barriers (online); 3) digital facilitators
(online). Findings were summarised into key considerations for optimising transitioning singing
groups from face-to-face to online delivery. Pilot quantitative data suggested possible improvements
in depression (treatment effect -4.78, p= 0.0487, MCID 5) balance confidence (treatment effect
+17.21, p=0.0383, MCID 14.2), and anxiety (treatment effect -2.22, p=0.0659, MCID 2).

This study identifies key considerations regarding the adaptation of SLH from face-to-face to online
delivery. Pilot data suggest online group singing for people with COPD may deliver benefits related to
reducing depression and anxiety, and improved balance confidence.

KEY MESSAGES
What is the key question?
Can Singing for Lung Health (SLH) be delivered online for people with COPD? And if so, what are the
practical issues and how does the experience compare with face-to-face participation?

What is the bottom line?
SLH appears safe and enjoyable both face-to-face and online. Access barriers for online sessions
included digital access and literacy. However increasing access to those previous unable to physically
access sessions is also important. In this pilot, depression, anxiety and balance confidence appear to
show improvements related to participation in a SLH group that transitioned from face-to-face to
online delivery.

Why read on?
To our knowledge this is the first study to assess health impacts of online group singing sessions.
Given the physical distancing measures required by the response to COVID-19, there is a need for
singing groups and other similar interventions to be delivered online such as pulmonary
rehabilitation. This study helps to inform this and future research in the area.

Introduction
Many people with Chronic Respiratory Disease (CRD) remain highly symptomatic despite optimal
pharmacological treatment. Symptoms including exercise limitation, shortness of breath, and
depression are common1-3. These can be compounded by social isolation and loneliness, which have
been shown to be important to respiratory health outcomes4. Group singing is a common practice in
most societies globally and has been shown to have health and wellbeing benefits for people with
living with long-term health conditions and the wider general public5-7. There is increasing interest in
arts-in-health interventions for people with chronic health conditions from patients through to
government level8. Singing for Lung Health (SLH) is a popular group singing programme specifically
developed for people with CRD. Small scale trials and qualitative studies suggest SLH has a range of
biopsychosocial benefits for participants9 10, however there is a lack of larger, longer term,
randomised control trials (RCT) regarding the impacts of this intervention 11. The ‘Singing for Lung
Health: Improving Experiences of Lung Disease (SHIELD) trial’ was set up to help to address this gap,
planning to randomise 120 individuals with COPD to participation in 12 weeks of group singing or
usual care.
During the current COVID-19 pandemic, physical distancing measures aimed at reducing SARS-CoV-2
transmission have led to profound social adaptations and disruption. Group activities, particularly
involving people with long term health problems who are especially vulnerable to COVID-19, have in
most cases been suspended including pulmonary rehabilitation programmes – one of the highest
value interventions for people with respiratory disease12 13. Similarly, there are particular concerns
that group singing could be a high risk activity regarding viral transmission, however research is
currently limited14.
This context has driven interest in the implementation, and ongoing development, of online
approaches that attempt to reproduce the social, psychological and physical effects of singing, dance
and more established interventions such as pulmonary rehabiliation 15 16. Such approaches are
especially important for people with lung conditions as even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic access

to these interventions was inadequate17 18. Furthermore, measures to reduce risk of COVID-19 in this
group appear to be causing substantial disruption to care and access to health-services, with high
levels of anxiety and loneliness being reported19 20.
The first group of participants in the SHIELD trial, which began in February 2020, initially met face-toface but the delivery of the intervention changed to an online format which is likely to remain
necessary for the foreseeable future. We decided that this transitional group should be reported as a
pilot study. This was firstly because research on the health and wellbeing impacts of online singing
groups is lacking so the results could guide both the further delivery of the SHIELD trial and the design
of other studies. Secondly, this would provide useful information from individuals who had
experience of both face-to-face and online activities and could therefore enable a comparison of the
two types of intervention experience.

Methods
Trial design and oversight
The SHIELD Trial was prospectively registered at clinicaltrial.gov (NCT04034212). The current analysis
was defined as an amendment to the initial trial registration when the delivery of singing moved from
face-to-face to online. Ethical approval for the SHIELD trial was granted by the National Health Service
Health Research Authority, Stanmore REC (19/LO/0418).

Participants
The first group of 18 participants in the SHIELD trial were recruited from a specialist COPD clinic at
the Royal Brompton Hospital London and lists of previous research participants who had given
consent to be contacted regarding research (Figure 1). Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
(COPD) diagnosis was confirmed by spirometry. Exclusion Criteria included pulmonary rehabilitation
less than 4 months ago (potential to impact outcome measures due to potential overlap of certain
impacts), inability to take part in singing sessions due to comorbidity (e.g. life limiting illness,
cognitive impairment), and previous participation in SLH classes. Given the requirement for the

original protocol of weekly in-person attendance, from the list of potential participants, people living
within a 1-hour journey of the hospital (estimated using google maps) were contacted first. All
participants provided written informed consent after reading the Participant Information Sheet (PIS)
and being given the opportunity to ask questions. Transport costs related to the assessment visit
were reimbursed, but no payments were made for participation.

Patient and Public Involvement
The Royal Brompton Clinical Research Facilities patient expert and lay person research panel, and the
Royal Brompton ‘Breathe Easy’ Group, reviewed the study proposal, provided thoughts and
suggested improvements which improved the study design and materials prior to Research Ethics
Committee review. In particular, the choice of a quality of life primary outcome measure was well
received. The PIS was clarified including reducing use of specialist terms and specifying which study
related costs would be reimbursed. Overall, the study was very well received by these patient and
public representatives who saw clear value in the patient centred focus of the study.

Interventions
The intervention arm (SLH) received 12, once weekly, hour long, SLH sessions. The study control arm
received usual care (UC) (no specific additional intervention above those which the person usually
engages with). The specific content and structure of the singing sessions has been described
elsewhere10, but briefly, each session consisted of a physical warm up, breathing exercises, vocal
warms ups, songs, and a cool down. The sessions were led by Edmund Jeffery, a professional singing
teacher with four years’ experience leading SLH groups. The SLH participants also received a CD of
singing exercises and were encouraged to practice between sessions.
The first five, weekly sessions were delivered face-to-face as originally planned at the Royal
Brompton Hospital, London, UK. And started on the 10/02/2020. These were halted due to the
developing COVID-19 situation in the UK for 2 weeks to develop the online delivery of sessions. This
process included discussion within the SLH provider network regarding suitable content, potential
barriers and facilitators, and trial sessions with experienced leaders to help address unidentified

challenges. The online SLH format which was developed was then used to deliver the final 7 sessions
via a video conferencing application (Zoom Video Communications Inc. “Zoom”).

Baseline assessment, randomisation and blinding
Assessments took place at the Royal Brompton Hospital (London, UK). Following a screening visit,
written informed consent was taken, followed by a structured clinical history, and confirmation of
COPD diagnosis by spirometry, and baseline assessment of outcome measures. Participants were
randomised (1:1) using computer-generated block randomisation lists (Sealed EnvelopeTM) block size
4, stratified by Medical Research Council (MRC) breathlessness grade and previous participation in
pulmonary rehabilitation. The outcome assessors were blind to intervention allocation. Blinding of
participants was not possible, and they were informed of their allocation by the unblinded researcher
responsible for randomisation (SB). Unblinding of assessors took place only after all outcome
measure data had been recorded.

Outcome measures and assessment
Primary outcome measures were change in the Short Form 36 Physical and Mental Component
Scores (MCS and PCS respectively) using the oblique scoring method21, with sub-scales provided to
aid interpretation. Secondary outcomes included change in SF-36 subscales, balance confidence (ABC
scale), anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), COPD assessment test (CAT) score, breathlessness (MRC
dyspnoea score and Dyspnoea-12). Patient experience of physical activity was assessed using the
clinical visit PROactive physical activity in COPD tool (cPPAC). The cPPAC combines questionnaire and
seven days of actigraphy measures to produce two domains, amount and difficulty22 23.
The original SHIELD protocol included physical capacity and performance testing using the six-minute
walk test (6MWT) and the short physical performance battery (SPPB). However, these were only
conducted at baseline as repeating these measures was not possible due to COVID-19 related
physical distancing measures.
Outcomes measures were repeated after 14 weeks (12 weeks intervention plus 2-week pause for
adaptation of delivery after week 5 of intervention). Baseline assessments were completed within 4

weeks prior to the intervention arms first singing session. Follow-up assessments were completed
within 4 weeks of study completion by participants at home, with activity monitors and
questionnaires returned by post. Any missing data (unanswered questions) were addressed by
telephoning the participant.
Semi-structured qualitative feedback interviews were conducted on the phone (by KP who has
training and experience in qualitative research techniques) with the SLH participants following
unblinding of researchers, focusing on overall experience of intervention, positives, negatives, and
barriers and facilitators to participation (as covered with an approved amendment to the Research
Ethics Committee application). Notes were made during the call and a template response form was
completed immediately after each call to record participant responses and interviewer reflections.
Deductive thematic analysis was used24. Comparison of experiences of face-to-face and online groups
was also sought.

Statistical analysis
The power calculation for the SHIELD trial required 120 participants to show a clinically important
difference in the primary outcome (SF-36). For this revised pilot study we present p values for
independent sample t-tests between intervention and control groups. Analyses were carried out
using Stata 14 (StataCorp, TX) on an intention to treat basis.

Results
The intervention and control groups were well-matched at baseline (Table 1). Only GAD-7 anxiety
score was of borderline statistical significance for between group difference at baseline (p 0.057),
mean values of 6.33 (UC), 1.88 (SLH). No serious adverse events were reported. No participants
withdrew from the study. However, difficulties with attendance of the online sessions is described
below.

Attendance
For the SLH arm, mean number of sessions attended was 8.4 (69%) of the 12 total sessions. This
included a mean of 4.5 (90%) of the 5 face-to-face sessions, and 3.7 (53%) of 7 online sessions. Three
of the participants did not attend the online sessions at all, three attended all seven sessions, with
the remaining three participants attending three, four and six sessions.

Effect on intervention
Change from baseline was compared between the control and SLH groups in Table 2. These are
presented for information, but cannot, of course, be used to make any confident inference about the
effectiveness or otherwise of the intervention given the limited sample size compared to that for
which the study was powered. Comparing singers with non-singers there were statistically significant
improvements in the PHQ-9 depression score (treatment effect -4.78, p= 0.049, MCID 5) and ABC
scale for balance confidence (treatment effect +17.21, p=0.038, MCID 14.2). There was also a
suggestion of benefit regarding anxiety levels (GAD-7) in the singers of borderline statistical
significance (treatment effect 2.22, p=0.066, MCID 2).

Physical activity
The PROactive total score suggested that the SLH group did worse than the control group regarding
change in the composite measure of amount and difficulty of physical activity. This was primarily
driven by the larger subjective reductions in the amount of physical activity in the SLH group during
the post-intervention follow-up assessment. However, this was discordant with objective assessment,
the mean change in step count was +1537 higher in the SLH group, compared with the control group.
The small sample, and “lock-down” related to COVID-19 physical distancing, limits confidence
interpreting the significance of these findings.

Participant experience:
Deductive analysis identified three key themes regarding the SLH participants’ experience 1)
perceived benefits; 2) digital barriers; and 3) digital facilitators.

Perceived benefits
All SLH participants reported greatly enjoying participation while session delivery was face-to-face.
The online sessions were enjoyed by the majority of participants, though all stated an overall
preference for face-to-face sessions. Participants reported it ‘helps your breathing’ and ‘Certainly my
breathing is better now than good than before’ especially in relation to the breath control exercises
and breathing techniques. Improvements to mood and enjoyment of the social aspects were
frequently reported. There was also a perception that the singing had contributed to other types of
physical activity ‘the singing has contributed to my exercise levels’.

Digital barriers
Barriers relating to online delivery mostly related to technical difficulties. The majority experienced
some form of technical difficulties; only those who regularly used online conferencing tools had no
issues. Of those that did not attend at all online, one did not have a computer and one did not have a
functioning internet connection. The third participant who did not participate online chose not to as
they felt making noise would not be considerate of their neighbours, given the limited sound
insulation, and ongoing ‘lockdown’ measures for all the residents of his building. Some participants
were able to ask friends or family members to help with overcoming technological challenges, which
worked well. However due to the “lock-down” and social shielding, this was not possible for all the
participants.
Online delivery was also felt to be less personal, as interaction between participants was more
challenging ‘meeting at the Brompton was much more engaging. It’s so nice to sing together as a

group’. One participant stated that ‘Physically demanding things are better done in a group’, with
group motivation more palpable in person than online. Even though face-to-face was preferred,
online deliver was still seen as being extremely valuable ‘Even on online, it’s an up-lifting thing to do
for mental health. We spent quite a lot time laughing. Singing as a group is special.’ Other aspects of
the sessions were also noted to be lost when adapting the sessions to online. For example ‘singing in
canon (a compositional technique in music)’, which was thoroughly enjoyed in person, were not
technically possible during sessions delivered online.
It was felt that by having started the sessions face-to-face a degree of rapport had been built
between participants, and with the singing leader, that helped with the transition online. It was
suggested that it might be more difficult establishing relationships between group members if the
groups commenced online with no prior meeting in person.

Digital facilitators
On certain points, online delivery was perceived as having benefits over in person sessions. One
participant highlighted that ease of attendance enabled her to attend when she was not feeling 100%
well and would not have attended in person had she needed to physically transport herself to the
singing session. Another participant felt that by being online he was less self-conscious singing with
the other participants as they would not be able to hear his voice. Multiple participants highlighted
that online delivery overcame many of the barriers related to physically accessing face-to-face
participation including geographical location of sessions, using transport with high symptoms burden,
and currently infection risks.

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the practical delivery of an online group singing
intervention for people with respiratory disease intended to improve health and wellbeing. This
transition from face-to-face to online delivery was forced on us by the COVID-19 pandemic, but
provides useful information about how this can be done and allowed us to gain insights from people
who had experienced both formats of delivery.
Key findings include that SLH delivered online was viewed as enjoyable and holistically beneficial to
health, though face-to-face was generally preferred. Technological difficulties prevented some people
from participation in online sessions, which were also felt to be less personal as social interaction was
more challenging. The pilot data suggest that group singing for people with COPD, adapted to online
delivery, may still deliver benefits related to reducing depression and anxiety, and improved balance
confidence.
These findings are broadly supportive of other related studies. However, these findings should be
interpreted within the context of COVID-19 related physical distancing and ‘shielding’ measures. In a
small (n=28) RCT of a six week course of twice weekly face-to-face SLH, Lord et al (2010)29 also found

improvements related to anxiety, and qualitative research is has reported similar findings to the
current study in relation to perceived impact on health and wellbeing 30. Previous studies on SLH for
people with COPD have suggested improvements in quality of life29 31 32, which was not seen here,
though it is not clear if this related to the small sample size. Furthermore, our findings echo those of a
study comparing the experiences of participants in a virtual choir, with those in a live choir, found the
two types of experience provide very similar emotional benefits, though differences in how ‘present’
participants felt33.
The qualitative data identified specific barriers and facilitators related to the different formats of
delivery, which helps to explain the attendance data. The consort diagram highlights that many
(n=23) potential participants declined due to issues with physically accessing the face-to-face
sessions, mainly related to viewing public transport as too challenging given their health condition.
However, online delivery demonstrated good potential to overcome physical distance as a barrier to
access. As highlighted in the interview feedback, during the online section of the study, there were
days when individuals participated but felt they would not have felt well enough to come in person if
the sessions were still being held at the hospital. Regarding the online sessions, difficulties with digital
literacy and digital access presented barriers, in some cases preventing ongoing participation in those
who stated they deeply enjoyed the face-to-face sessions.
The consort diagram may have been different if the methods of delivery had been known from the
start. Some people who declined participation due to difficulties physically accessing the hospital may
have participated. However, those for whom digital delivery poses barriers may have declined.
Clearly digital access is a vital consideration to address to overcome this potential barrier to
participation. Additionally, participant rapport building appears to be an area requiring particular
consideration.
Some limitations to this study are important to discuss. Firstly, adaptation of the methods during the
study was not ideal. That said, it has provided a unique opportunity to gain insights into the transition
of singing groups to online delivery which have, by necessity, become widespread. Secondly, given

the novelty of the online delivery, the session content and technical considerations are likely to
develop overtime with experience, which could alter the relevance of the current findings to future
sessions. However, this is not necessarily a weakness, as the current findings provide useful results on
which to base these developments. Thirdly, the sample size was small due to the circumstances in
which it was decided to evaluate this group and because the mode of delivery changed part-way
through. This limits the confidence in quantitative impacts, and means it is unclear whether singers
experienced benefits during the face-to-face or online part of the programme, or a combination of
the two. Nevertheless, as a convenience pilot study, it provides useful indications of impacts, as well
as informing future research. Similarly, the sub-optimal attendance during online sessions limits the
extent to which impact can be assessed, although when combined with the interview feedback this
provides useful information regarding barriers and facilitators to participation that can be addressed
in both practice and future research. Finally, it is important to consider the context in which this trial
took place. The developing COVID-19 pandemic was a considerable source of concern for many
people with COPD, who were identified as being at an increased risk of severe COVID-19 or death.
Though all the participants lived in London, the situation and their response to it, is likely to have
differed between individuals, which intern, may have shaped their experience of the intervention.
Despite the necessary, yet unusual, adaptations to the methods, this study has provided interesting
and potentially useful results to inform the development of further research regarding online singing
group delivery and research. These findings are useful for existing SLH groups who are moving to
online delivery of previously in-person sessions. They also provide the some of the first research
findings to support the delivery of participatory online arts-in-health interventions in the context of
COVID-19 related physical distancing.
The findings may also provide relevant insight for other related activities making an online transition
such as pulmonary rehabilitation and Tai-Chi34, and dance for people with long-term medical
conditions. Many of these activities had begun to develop and test online delivery approaches prior
to the COVID-19 pandemic35 36, though the importance and potential utility of online delivery has now
clearly increased16.

Further research should include larger studies assessing the health and wellbeing impact of online
group singing in patient groups and for the wider population. Larger studies of SLH specifically, both
online, and face-to-face (when appropriate to do so) remain a priority. Even after the acute phase of
the COVID-19 pandemic online delivery of singing groups present an opportunity to widen access to
certain groups of people. In-depth qualitative research exploring participant experience would also
be valuable.

Conclusions
In conclusion, this study suggests that group singing sessions that have had to change delivery from
face-to-face to online may produce clinically significant impacts on depression scores, anxiety, and
improve balance confidence in people with COPD. The findings also identify important differences
between online and face-to-face delivery including technological barriers for online, and overcoming
physical access barriers of face-to-face. Despite a general preference for face-to-face sessions, online
delivery was still felt to provide substantial health and wellbeing benefits. Future research on digitally
delivered singing groups is required.
