Features of α-HBDH in COVID-19 patients with different ages,outcomes and clinical types: a cohort study

11

Abstract

12

Background: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has spread all over the world and brought extremely huge losses. At present, there is no study to

13

systematically analyse the features of hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (α-HBDH) in COVID-19 patients with different ages, clinical types and outcomes.

14

Methods: Electronic medical records including demographics, clinical manifestation, α -HBDH test results and outcomes of 131 hospitalized COVID-19

15

patients, with confirmed result of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral infection, were extracted and analyzed.

16

Results: The α-HBDH value in ≥61 years old group, severe group and critical group, death group all increased at first and then decreased, while no obvious

17

changes were observed in other groups. And there were significant differences of the α-HBDH value among different age groups (P<0.001) , clinical type

18

groups (P<0.001) and outcome groups (P<0.001). The optimal scale regression model showed that α-HBDH value (P<0.001) and age (P<0.001) were related

19

to clinical type.

20

Conclusions: α-HBDH value increases in some COVID-19 patients, obviously in ≥61 years old, death and critical group, indicating that patients in these

21

three groups suffer from more serious tissues and organs damage, higher α -HBDH value and risk of death. The obvious difference between death and

22

survival group in early stage may provide a approach to judge the prognosis. The accuracy of the model to distinguish severe/critical type and other types is

23

85.84%, suggesting that α-HBDH could judge the clinical type of COVID-19 patients accurately. In brief, α-HBDH is an important indicator to judge the

24

severity and prognosis of COVID-19.

1 Introduction
Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in December 2019, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), it

28

has spread rapidly around the world. SARS-Cov-2 has attracted the attention of the global because of its high transmission ability,

29

morbidity and mortality[1-4]. On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) identified COVID-19 as a public health emergency of

30

international concern[5]. As of July 1, 2020, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide has reached 10357622, and the

31

number of deaths has reached 508055[6].

32

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is one of the important enzymes in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. It mainly catalyzes the

33

transformation between lactic acid and pyruvate. Its enzymatic reaction is: pyruvate + NADH+H+⇌ lactic acid + NAD+. LDH consists of

34

five isozymes composed of different combinations of H and M subunits: LDH1 (H4), LDH2 (H3M), LDH3 (H2M2), LDH4 (HM3) and

35

LDH5 (M4). α-HBDH is tested by the α-ketoacid, a substrate, to determine the LDH activity. Additionally, the activity of LDH1 and

36

LDH2 with more H subunits is described by α-HBDH activity because of the high affinity for this substrate to the H subunit in LDH.

37

α-HBDH mainly distributed in the heart, brain, kidney and red blood cells, and the activity of the enzyme in the heart is more than half of

38

the total enzyme activity. α-HBDH level increased in the progression of cor pulmonale, leukemia and tumor. Moreover, the extents of the

39

increase and the tissue and organ injury were closely related, which can be used as an auxiliary diagnostic index[7-11].

40

Compared with other pneumonia types, the α-HBDH level in COVID-19 patients was significantly higher, and the α-HBDH value of

41

severe group was higher than that of non-severe group[12, 13]. When complicated with cardiovascular disease or gastrointestinal symptoms,

42

the increase of α-HBDH in COVID-19 patients was much more significant as well[14, 15]. Cen Y et al. observed 1007 mild and moderate

43

COVID-19 patients for 28 days. It was found that the higher the α-HBDH value, the greater the risk of progression to severe or critical

44

type[16]. Zhang Gemin et al. divided 95 COVID-19 patients into four groups according to their α-HBDH level on admission. They found

45

that the higher the α-HBDH value, the greater the proportion of severe cases, and the higher the risk of death or need for mechanical

46

ventilation for patients, showing that the high α-HBDH level indicates an increased risk of further aggravation of the disease[17]. In this

47

study, we analyzed the changes of α-HBDH values of COVID-19 patients with different ages, clinical types and outcomes. The effects of

48

α-HBDH, age and gender on the clinical type of COVID-19 patients were quantified by the optimal scale regression model, so as to

49

achieve the purpose of early judging the severity of the disease.

50

2 Methods

51

2.1 Study Population

52

Our study included individuals with complete examination data, 18 years old or above, who were hospitalized in Xiangyang No.1

53

People’s Hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19. In the end, we included a total of 131 patients.

54

2.2 Study Design

55

This research project was a bidirectional observational cohort study. According to the diagnosis and treatment guidelines[18], the patients

56

were divided into mild group, moderate group, severe group and critical group. According to their age, the patients were divided into ≤40 years

57

old group, 41-60 years old group and ≥61 years old group. According to the outcome, the patients were divided into death group and survival

58

group. The distributions of α-HBDH median value were plotted with an 5-days interval (T1, T2, T3…Tn represented the time unit successively).

59

The symptom onset data was designed as the first day of disease, the abnormal percentage, median and quartile interval of α-HBDH in different

60

ages, outcomes and clinical types were calculated.

61

The study was approved by the ethics review board of Xiangyang No.1 People's Hospital (No.2020GCP012) and registered at the Chinese

62

Clinical Trial Registry as ChiCTR2000031088. Informed consent from patients has been exempted since this study is an observational cohort

63

study that does not involve patients' personal privacy.

64

2.3 Data Sources

65

Two groups (two researchers per group) extracted the data from hospital information system through a consistent data collection protocol

66

and cross-checked. Gender, age, all α-HBDH test results, disease onset date, outcome, death date, etc. were collected. Two respiratory

67

physicians classified the clinical types and then cross-checked the results. A third expert was involved when there was disagreement. The data

68

were traced back to 23 January and followed up to 28 March, 2020.

69

2.4 Statistical Analysis

70

All statistical analyses were performed by SPSS 20.0. Continuous data in accordance with normality were represented by means and

71

standard deviations, otherwise median (interquartile, IQR) was applied. Categorical data were described as frequency (%). The chi-square test

72

was conducted to assess significance between groups. T-test was used to compare the quantitative data of normal distribution between the two

73

groups, and the comparison of the quantitative data of non-normal distribution between the two groups was analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test.

74

The correlation between two variables was tested by Spearman correlation test. The maximum α-HBDH value in the first 15 days, age and

75

gender were regarded as independent variables and clinical types were regarded as dependent variables to build the optimal scale regression

76

model.

Up to February 28, 542 patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 have been admitted to our hospital. A total of 142 cases were

80

positive for nucleic acid test, among which the data of 9 cases were incomplete, 2 cases were infants, thus 131 cases were included in this study

81

finally, including 63 males and 68 females, aged 50.13±17.13 years old. Among them, there were 4 mild cases, 88 moderate cases, 18 severe

82

cases and 21 critical cases. The average time from onset to admission, from onset to discharge, from onset to death, and length of hospitalization

83

were 4.54±3.10, 26.87±9.19, 18.4±9.77 and 22.38±8.70 days respectively. In this study, 565 tests of α-HBDH were extracted from 37 laboratory

84

indicators (including 24560 outpatient and inpatient examination results), accounting for 2.30% of the total test results.

85

3.2 α-HBDH in different age groups of COVID-19 patients

86

In ≤40 years old group, 41-60 years old group and ≥61 years old group, the α-HBDH median value was 123.17 (106.94-144.95) U/L,

87

150.49 (120.18-185.20) U/L and 221.59 (156.76-302.89) U/L, respectively, and the α-HBDH value abnormal percentage was 10.53%, 26.74%

88

and 60.70%, respectively. The changes indicated that the α-HBDH median value in ≤40 years old group increased during T1-T2 and decreased

89

after T2, and the normal range was T1 to T6; in 41-60 years old group, the α-HBDH median value decreased during T1-T6, and was in the

90

normal range from T1 to T6; in ≥61 years old group, the α-HBDH median value increased during T1-T2 and decreased after T2, and the

91

abnormal time interval was T2-T5 (Figure1, Table1).

92

There were significant differences of the α-HBDH value in the first 30 days among the three age groups. Significant differences were

93

observed in the α-HBDH value between ≤40 years old group and 41-60 years old group during T1-T4, between ≤40 years old group and ≥61

94

years old group during T1-T6, and between 41-60 years old group and ≥61 years old group during T2-T6. Differences were also significant in

95

the α-HBDH value abnormal percentage among the three age groups (P<0.001). The age was correlated with α-HBDH value according to the

96

Spearman correlation test (P<0.001), and the coefficient was 0.52.

3.3 α-HBDH in different outcome groups of COVID-19 patients

98

In survival group and death group, the α-HBDH median value was 147.80 (121.55-194.67) U/L and 337.18 (294.01-477.11) U/L,

99

respectively, and the α-HBDH value abnormal percentage was 29.52% and 96.08%, respectively. The changes indicated that the α-HBDH

100

median value in survival group increased during T1-T2, decreased after T2, and was in the normal range during T1-T6; while in death group, the

101

α-HBDH median value increased during T1-T4 and decreased after T4, and the abnormal time interval was T1-T6 (Figure1, Table2).

102

There were significant differences of the α-HBDH in the first 30days and every time unit during T1-T6. Differences were also significant in

103

the α-HBDH value abnormal percentage among the two outcome groups (P<0.001). Spearman correlation test showed that there was a

104

correlation between outcome groups and the α-HBDH value (P<0.001), and the correlation was 0.49.

105

3.4 α-HBDH in different clinical type groups of COVID-19 patients

106

In mild group, moderate group, severe group and critical group, the α-HBDH median value were 110.41 (105.67-120.25) U/L, 134.92

107

(114.40-163.23) U/L, 180.95 (144.02-231.01) U/L and 293.57 (209.53-368.64) U/L, respectively, and the abnormal percentage of α-HBDH

108

value was 0.00%, 12.45%, 49.47% and 85.59%, respectively. The changes indicated that the α-HBDH median value of the moderate group

109

increased during T1-T2 and decreased after T2, and was in the normal range during T1-T6; in the severe group, the α-HBDH median value

110

increased during T1-T3 and decreased after T3, and the abnormal time interval was T2-T4; in the critical group, the α-HBDH median value

111

increased during T1-T3 and decreased after T3, and the abnormal time interval was T1-T6 (Figure1, Table3). However, the mild group was

112

excluded in statistical analysis for the reason that it only contained 4 cases.

113

There were significant differences of the α-HBDH value in the first 30 days among the three clinical type groups. Significant differences

114

were observed in the α-HBDH value between moderate type group and severe type group during T1-T6, between moderate type group and

115

critical type group during T1-T6, and between severe type group and critical type group during T2-T6.

116

3.5 Optimal scale regression model based on this study

117

After excluded 4 mild cases, we built the optimal scale regression model based on the maximum α-HBDH value in the first 15 days, age,

118

gender and clinical type. The adjusted R2 of the model was 0.659. The clinical type was significantly correlated with age (P<0.001) and

119

α-HBDH value (P<0.001), but not with gender (P=0.337). The model expression was Q_levels = 0.648*Q_α-HBDH + 0.036*Q_gender +

120

0.271*Q_age (Q_levels, Q_ages, Q_α-HBDH and Q_gender represent the scale quantification scores of clinical type, age, α-HBDH value and

121

gender, respectively). The comparison between the output type and the actual type quantification score was shown in the figure 2. According to

122

the model, the output accuracy of moderate, severe and critical types was 81.45%. In order to discriminate moderate type and severe/critical type,

123

the severe type and critical type were combined to the same category, and the accuracy was 85.84%.

124

4 Discussion

125

α-HBDH is one of the important enzymes in the process of glucose metabolism, which is widely distributed in various tissues and organs,

126

especially in the heart, brain, kidney and red blood cells. COVID-19 mainly induces lung injury and causes damage to the heart and other tissues

127

and organs, which results in the release of α-HBDH and the increase of α-HBDH in blood terminally[17]. The α-HBDH value in COVID-19

128

patients changed, it increased or significantly increased in some patients (Figure1). In different age groups, outcome groups and clinical type

129

groups, there were significant differences in the distribution and abnormal percentage of α-HBDH. Age and outcome were significantly

130

correlated with α-HBDH. Moreover, α-HBDH value may be related to the severity of COVID-19.

131

In ≥61 years old group and death group, the α-HBDH median value increased from T1, and reached a single peak in T2 (258.66 U/L) and

132

T4 (455.11 U/L), respectively, which was significantly different from that in ≤40 years old group (peak value was 144.26 U/L ), 41-60 years old

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.29.20222612; this version posted November 3, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder,

133

group (peak value was 174.26 U/L) and survival group (peak value was 165.02 U/L). The abnormal interval of α-HBDH median value in ≥61

134

years old group and death group was T1-T5, T1-T6 respectively, which was significantly different from that in ≤40 years old group, 41-60 years

135

old group and survival group, in which α-HBDH median value were all in the normal range. It shows that the older the age, the worse the

136

outcome, the higher the α-HBDH value, and the longer the abnormal interval. The α-HBDH value in ≥61 years old group and death group was

137

higher than that in other groups, indicating that the injury of heart, brain, kidney and other tissues and organs is more serious in elderly and death

138

patients, which was consistent with previous study[19]. This may be related to the poor function of the immune system and being more sensitive

139

to virus damage in elderly and seriously ill patients. This characteristic suggests that we should pay more attention to elderly patients and

140

patients of which α-HBDH continues to increase significantly. According to the data distribution and statistical analysis, the α-HBDH value can

141

distinguish the death and the survival. For example, during T1, patients with α-HBDH ≥180.97 U/L have a ≥25% chance of survival, and

142

patients with α-HBDH ≥218.19 U/L have a ≥75% chance of death, which might have guiding significance for judgment of disease development

143

in early stage. Enough cases and data could help us build a mathematic model and recognize the prognosis in advance better.

144

The α-HBDH median value of the mild group was in the normal range, without obvious change, indicating that the injury of tissue and

145

organ injury in this type was slight. The same as mild group, α-HBDH median value in moderate group also distributed in the normal range. It

146

increased firstly, and reached a peak (133.20 U/L) in T2, indicating that tissue and organ injury occurred immediately after the symptom onset in

147

spite of the slight degree, and mainly occurred in the first 10 days. The changes of α-HBDH median value of severe group was similar to that of

148

critical group, which increased during T1-T3 and decreased after T3. Their peak value was 222.56 U/L and 355.23 U/L appearing in T3, and

149

recovered to normal range in T5 and T7, respectively. It shows that the more serious the illness, the higher the α-HBDH median value and peak

150

value, the longer the abnormal interval, which may be related to the serious virus-induced acute lung injury, tissues and organs damage in severe

151

and critical type groups. These characteristics are of great significance for us to judge the severity of the disease by α-HBDH.

152

The maximum α-HBDH value in the first 15 days, age and gender of all patients were selected to build the optimal scale regression model.

153

α-HBDH <250.17 U/L and aged <60 years old was associated with moderate type, α-HBDH between 259.88-311.73 U/L and aged between

154

62-70 years old was associated with severe type, α-HBDH >327.71 U/L and aged >70 years old was associated with critical type. In this model,

155

the output accuracy for clinical type was over 80%, which indicated that the model could distinguish the clinical classification based on our data

156

well. α-HBDH and age could be used to discriminate the clinical type of COVID-19 patients if further verified by other data, which could help

157

us to grasp the opportunity of treatment and reduce the risk of progression to severe and critical type in early stage.

158

However, this study has several limitations. All the patients in the study come from the single hospital, and the sample size is small. This

159

study is a retrospective cohort study, which fails to detect and analyze the daily α-HBDH in patients and may lose some information.

160

5 Conclusion

161

α-HBDH value increases in some COVID-19 patients, obviously in ≥61 years old, death and critical group, indicating that patients in these

162

three groups suffer from more serious tissues and organs damage, higher α -HBDH value and risk of death. The obvious difference between

163

death and survival group in early stage may provide a approach to judge the prognosis. The accuracy of the model to distinguish severe/critical

164

type and other types is 85.84%, suggesting that α-HBDH could judge the clinical type of COVID-19 patients accurately. In brief, α-HBDH is

165

an important indicator to judge the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.
