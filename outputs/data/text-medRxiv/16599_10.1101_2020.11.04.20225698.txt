Abstract
Background and Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe mortality across the globe with the USA
as the current epicenter, although the initial outbreak was in Wuhan, China. Many studies successfully applied machine
learning to fight the COVID-19 pandemic from a different perspective. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no
comprehensive survey with bibliometric analysis has been conducted on the adoption of machine learning for fighting
COVID-19. Therefore, the main goal of this study is to bridge this gap by carrying out an in-depth survey with
bibliometric analysis on the adoption of machine-learning-based technologies to fight the COVID-19 pandemic from
a different perspective, including an extensive systematic literature review and a bibliometric analysis.
Methods: A literature survey methodology is applied to retrieve data from academic databases, and a bibliometric
technique is subsequently employed to analyze the accessed records. Moreover, the concise summary, sources of
COVID-19 datasets, taxonomy, synthesis, and analysis are presented. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is
found mainly utilized in developing COVID-19 diagnosis and prognosis tools, mostly from chest X-ray and chest
computed tomography (CT) scan images. Similarly, a bibliometric analysis of machine-learning-based COVID-19related publications in Scopus and Web of Science citation indexes is performed. Finally, a new perspective is
proposed to solve the challenges identified as directions for future research. We believe that the survey with
bibliometric analysis can help researchers easily detect areas that require further development and identify potential
collaborators.
Results: The findings in this study reveal that machine-learning-based COVID-19 diagnostic tools received the most
considerable attention from researchers. Specifically, the analyses of the results show that energy and resources are
more dispensed toward COVID-19 automated diagnostic tools, while COVID-19 drugs and vaccine development
remain grossly underexploited. Moreover, the machine-learning-based algorithm predominantly utilized by
researchers in developing the diagnostic tool is CNN mainly from X-rays and CT scan images.
Conclusions: The challenges hindering practical work on the application of machine-learning-based technologies to
fight COVID-19 and a new perspective to solve the identified problems are presented in this study. We believe that
the presented survey with bibliometric analysis can help researchers determine areas that need further development
and identify potential collaborators at author, country, and institutional levels to advance research in the focused area
of machine learning application for disease control.

1. Introduction
The novel 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic emerged on December 12, 2019, and the Chinese government
announced the isolation of new types of coronavirus on January 7, 2020 (Imai et al., 2020). This virus was code-named
as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 12, 2020. However, it was renamed to Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the international committee on the taxonomy of the
virus (Gorbalenya, 2020). Since the pandemic, the number of confirmed cases as of October 10, 2020 reached
36,616,555 with 1,063,429 recorded fatalities. According to the origin of the first confirmed case report, the infection’s
transmission was from animal to human, that is, zoonotic agent (Read et al., 2020). The virus has extended beyond
China to other continents of the world (Wang et al., 2020). The rise in the number of cases in Wuhan and other
countries after the evacuation of the cases and closure of the marketplace in Wuhan shows a secondary transmission
between humans. Related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the COVID-19 pandemic occurred during
the China spring festival, the most famous celebration in China that attracted about 3 million Chinese people who
traveled throughout the country. This festival period might have created an avenue for the transmission of this
contiguous disease, making its prevention and control very difficult. The report on the secondary cases was made
approximately 10 days after the first outbreak of the virus. These new patients were infected through human-to-human
transmission because they never had any contact with the Wuhan marketplace, the origin of the first case of the
pandemic (Read et al., 2020). The first non-Chinese infected case that spread over the provinces of China and then to
the continents of Asia was reported on January 13, 2020, without any connection to the epidemiology at the market
place in Wuhan (Hui et al., 2020). Subsequently, the spread continued, and various cases from countries abroad, such
as the USA, Italy, and France began to be reported (Holshue et al., 2020).
Human-to-human transmission usually occurs in the case of close contact between humans. Restricting human-tohuman spread is crucial for decreasing secondary infections among healthcare workers and close contact. The WHO
recommended infection control interventions to reduce the risk of the general spread of acute respiratory diseases such
as avoiding close contact with infected patients, frequent washing of hands in case of contact with ill people, and
avoiding unprotected contacts with wild or farm animals. People suffering from the acute respiratory infection should
always observe cough etiquette by maintaining distancing, covering their cough, sneezing with disposable tissues, and
washing their hands frequently. Within the healthcare system, equipment improved standard infection control and
prevention practices are recommended, especially in the hospital emergency unit (WHO, 2020). Progressively, an
interim clinical guideline has been established by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention for the COVID19 pandemic to place control measures and reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the USA (Patel & Jernigan, 2020).
In minimizing the devastating effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and fighting the virus, the timely processing of
COVID-19 data analytics is highly critical. The data can come from different aspects such as the patients, fractionated
into molecular, society, and population, which can help in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 (Park et al.,
2020). Machine learning is one of the major technologies in combatting COVID-19 (Elavarasan & Pugazhendhi, 2020;
Kumar et al., 2020). Much effort based on synergy from the machine learning and biomedical research community is
ongoing to develop different approaches to combat the disease. Ongoing efforts include the screening of patients,
detection and monitoring of patients, development of drugs, repurposing of drugs to treat patients with COVID-19,
predicting the protein structure related to COVID-19, COVID-19 diagnostic systems, COVID-19 vaccine
development, and analyzing personalized therapeutic effects for the evaluation of new patients (Alimadadi et al.,
2020). The overall goal of these disease control techniques is to prevent the spread; track confirmed cases, recoveries,
and mortality; and predict future pandemics (Vaishya et al., 2020).
Many studies adopted machine learning to fight the COVID-19 pandemic from a different perspective. A systematic
literature review of published and preprinted reports on prediction models for diagnosing COVID-19 was reported.
Prediction models were found floating the academic literature very rapidly to help in diagnosing COVID-19 and
making critical medical decisions (Wynants et al., 2020). However, the major issue with the work is that it uses preprint
publication that has not been validated by peer review. The review is not specific to machine learning for COVID-19.
Sources of COVID-19 datasets that can guide researchers access different data for studies on COVID-19 are absent.
The study is limited to the diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19. A comprehensive taxonomy on the prediction tools
to show the area that needs improvement is missing in the survey. Bibliometric analysis is not integrated into the

study. Similar bibliometric analyses have been reported in the literature as presented by Chahrour et al. (2020),
Hossain (2020), and Lou et al. (2020). However, these existing analyses differ from the current bibliometric analysis
in this study because the current analysis result focuses on the application of machine learning techniques to combat
COVID-19 pandemic as opposed to various literature reporting general medical practices on COVID-19.
In this study, we propose to conduct a dedicated comprehensive survey on the adoption of machine learning to fight
the COVID-19 pandemic from a different perspective, including an extensive literature review and a bibliometric
analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first comprehensive analysis of research output focusing on
several possible applications of machine learning techniques for mitigating the worldwide spread of the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic. We are mindful that other publications might not be captured in our scope because the current
study is only limited to the eight academic databases mentioned in Table 1. We are also very dependent on the indexing
of the databases used, which is akin to any other bibliometric research study.
Other sections of the study are organized as follows: Section 2 presents the methodology for the survey. Section 3
presents the rudiments of the major machine learning algorithms used in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Section 4
presents the adoption of machine learning to fight COVID-19. Section 5 unravels the different sources of COVID-19
datasets. Section 6 discusses the survey and bibliometric analysis. Section 7 unveils challenges and future research
directions before the conclusion in Section 8. Figure 1 presents the visual structure of the survey paper, which is
similar to the work in (Mohammadi et al., 2018).

2.5 Bibliometric protocol
VOSviewer software was used to present a bibliometric analysis of the existing literature on COVID-19. VOSviewer
software is a tool for constructing and visualizing bibliometric maps of items, such as journals, research, or individual
publications. These maps can be created based on citation, bibliographic coupling, co-citation, or co-authorship
relations (Ezugwu et al., 2020). The bibliometric analysis software also offers text mining functionality that can be
used to construct and visualize co-occurrence networks of important terms extracted from a body of scientific literature
(see www.vosviewer.com). We only used 1,178 publications with the keyword “novel coronavirus” and 98
publications with the keyword “COVID-19 and artificial intelligence” that were retrieved from Scopus and Web of
Science academic databases for the bibliometric analysis presented in this study. Only 57 document results were
extracted using the keyword “COVID-19 and machine learning” from the same academic database. Articles from

3. Theoretical background of machine learning algorithms
Numerous machine learning algorithms exist in the literature. In this section, we discuss the basic operations of the
major machine learning algorithms used in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic to provide the readers with a basic
concept of how the algorithms operate in achieving their goal, especially novice researchers, thus making the study
self-contained. The main algorithms include artificial neural network (ANN), convolutional neural network (CNN),
and long short term memory (LSTM).
3.1 Artificial neural network
ANN is a machine learning algorithm designed to emulate the human brain. Similar to neurons in the human brain,
ANN consists of interconnected nodes. A given ANN consists of three essential components, namely, node (neuron)
character, network topology, and several learning rules (Livingstone, 2008). Signal processing strategy involving the
number of inputs and outputs associated with a node, the weight of each input and output, and the activation function
are all determined by the node character. The organization of the nodes and the interconnection between them are
determined by the network architecture, which usually consists of three underlying layers (input, output, and hidden
layers). Learning is employed to train the network. The learning rules decide on weight initialization and adjustment.
An ANN is said to have learnt if it can process probabilistic, fuzzy, noisy, and vague data with an insignificant negative
effect on the output quality, and generalize acquired knowledge to unknown tasks (Basheer & Hajmeer, 2000). A basic
ANN model consists of multiple nodes such that every node receives multiple inputs from other nodes through
connections having associated weights. The weighted sum of the inputs is passed through a threshold gate. The node
is activated and transmits the output to another node only if the weighted sum of its input exceeds the threshold
(Basheer & Hajmeer, 2000).
3.2 Convolutional neural network
CNN is the most commonly used deep learning algorithm (Haque & Neubert, 2020). It is a discriminative deep
learning algorithm formed by a stack of multiple convolutional and pooling layers (Deng, 2014). The major strength
of CNN lies in its ability to perform parameter sharing, sparse interaction, and equal representation. The network is
faster and easier to train due to its utilization of local connections and sharing of weights (Pouyanfar et al., 2018). A
typical CNN receives an image as its input and has neurons arranged in a 3D form connecting to only a portion of the
previous layer (Haque & Neubert, 2020). The architecture of CNN is presented in series of stages, where the first
stages consist of convolution and pooling layers, and the final stage is composed of a fully connected layer (Lecun,
Bengio, & Hinton, 2015).
CNN receives 3D input 𝑥 in the form 𝑚 × 𝑚 × 𝑟, where 𝑚 is the height and width of the input, and 𝑟 is the channel
number, for example in RGB 𝑟 = 3. The convolution layer has several filters known as kernels 𝑘 with a size of 𝑛 ×
𝑛 × 𝑞 where 𝑛 < 𝑥 and 𝑞 ≤ 𝑟. The kernels share the same parameters of weight (𝑊 𝑘 ) and bias (𝑏 𝑘 ). During
convolution, 𝑘 feature maps are generated (ℎ𝑘 h), each having size 𝑚 − 𝑛 − 1. The convolution layer finds the dot
product between w and input 𝑥, and applies activation function 𝑓 to the output expressed as (Pouyanfar et al., 2018):
ℎ𝑘 = 𝑓(𝑊 𝑘 ∗ 𝑥 + 𝑏 𝑘 ). The pooling layer prevents overfitting and hastens training by reducing the length of the
feature map (Pouyanfar et al., 2018; R. Zhao et al., 2019). Maximum and average pooling are the widely applied
pooling methods. Finally, the fully connected SoftMax layers are deployed for prediction (Zhao et al., 2019).
3.3 Long short term memory
The LSTM deep learning network is a type of recurrent neural network that can recall data features over several
intervals of time (Liu et al., 2019). It was developed to solve the vanishing gradient weakness of the recurrent neural
network (Karim, Majumdar, Darabi, & Chen, 2018). The hidden layers of LSTM are treated as memory cells, making
the network powerful in handling long- and short-term correlation in a time series (Zhao et al., 2017). The earliest
version of LSTM contained memory cells, and input and output gates with no forget gate; the forget gate was later

deployed to enable continual learning of tasks by resetting the state of the LSTM (Greff et al., 2016). Its updated
architecture consists of multiple LSTM units with each unit having an input gate, a forget gate, an output gate, and a
memory cell. Sak et al. (2014) described the underlying architecture of LSTM as consisting of memory blocks in its
hidden layer. The memory blocks have memory cells for the storage of the temporal state of the network with
additional units, known as gates, to supervise the information flow. A memory cell has an input gate that manages the
inflow of input activations to the memory cell and an output gate to manage the outflow of cell activations to the
network. The forget gate is incorporated to forget or reset the memory of the cell adaptively. LSTM computes mapping
iteratively at a timestamp 𝑡 = 1 𝑡𝑜 𝑇 with an input sequence 𝑥 = (𝑥1 , 𝑥2, … , 𝑥𝑟 ) and an output sequence 𝑦 =
(𝑦1 , 𝑦2, … , 𝑦𝑟 ). LSTM is good at addressing complex sequential machine learning problems (Karim et al., 2018). Deep
LSTM architectures consist of stacked LSTM layers (Sak et al., 2014). LSTMs are strong in handling temporal
dependencies in sequences but weak in dealing with long sequence dependencies (Karim et al., 2018).
4. COVID-19 machine learning adoption-oriented perspective
In the fight against COVID-19, different aspects of artificial intelligence (AI) were applied to curtail its adverse effect
(Dananjayan & Raj, 2020). The taxonomy in Figure 3 was created from the project that involved machine learning in
fighting COVID-19. The data used in creating the taxonomy were extracted from the papers that applied the machine
learning algorithm to fight COVID-19.

4.1 COVID-19 diagnostic tools
Currently, the sensitivities for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR)-based viral nucleic acid
assay are used as the reference standard method to confirm COVID-19 infection (Corman et al., 2020). However, such
a laboratory test is time consuming, and the supply of test kits may be the bottleneck for a rapidly growing suspicious

population even for many developed countries such as the USA. More importantly, initial false-negative or weakly
positive RT–PCR test results were found in several later-confirmed cases, while highly suspicious computed
tomography (CT) imaging features were present (Xu et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2020). The treatment and screening of
COVID-19 can be more effective when deep learning approach, CT features, and real-time RT–PCR results are
integrated (Li et al., 2020). AI and deep learning can assist in developing diagnostic tools and deciding on treatment
(Rao and Vazquez, 2020; Shi et al., 2020). As a result, many diagnostic tools were developed based on the machine
learning algorithm to fight COVID-19. For example, Apostolopoulos and Mpesiana (2020) applied transfer learning
with CNN to detect COVID-19 from X-ray images containing common bacterial pneumonia and normal incidents and
established COVID-19 infection. Transfer learning CNN was used to diagnose COVID-19 cases from X-ray datasets.
The results indicated that VGG19 diagnosed COVID-19 confirmed cases with better accuracy on two- and threeclassification problems compared with MobileNet v2, Inception, Xception, and Inception ResNet v2. The proposed
approach can help develop a cost-effective, fast, and automatic COVID-19 diagnostic tool, and reduce the exposure
of medical workers to COVID-19. Similarly, Rahaman et al. (2020) developed an automated computer-aided diagnosis
(CAD) system for the detection of COVID-19 samples from healthy cases and cases with pneumonia using chest Xray (CXR) images. Their study demonstrated the effectiveness of applying deep transfer learning techniques for the
identification of COVID-19 cases using CXR images.
Ardakani et al. (2020) were motivated by the time consumption and high cost of the traditional medical laboratory
COVID-19 test to investigate the performance of 10 well-known CNNs in diagnosing COVID-19. The 10 variants of
CNN included VGG-16, AlexNet, Xception, VGG-19, ResNet-101, SqueezeNet, ResNet-50, GoogleNet, MobileNetV2, and ResNet-18. All the CNN variants were applied on CT scan images because the CT slice is a fast method of
diagnosing patients with COVID-19. The diagnostic results of the CNN variants indicated that ResNet-101 and
Xception outperformed the other CNN variants in diagnosing COVID-19. They concluded that ResNet-101 has a high
sensitivity in characterizing and diagnosing COVID-19 infections. Therefore, it can be used as an alternative tool in
the department of radiology for diagnosing COVID-19 infection. It is cheaper and faster compared with traditional
laboratory analysis.
Butt et al. (2020) applied CNN for the detection of COVID-19 from the chest CT scan of patients. CNN was found
very fast and reliable in the detection of COVID-19 from a chest CT scan compared with the conventional RT–PCR
testing. In summary, the CNN model is fast and reliable in detecting COVID-19 infection. Huang et al. (2020) applied
a deep learning algorithm on a chest CT scan of a patient with COVID-19 to quantify lung burden changes. The
patients with COVID-19 were grouped into mild, moderate, severe, and critical based on findings from the chest CT
scan, clinical evaluation, and laboratory results. Deep learning algorithm was applied to assess the lung burden
changes. They found that the assessment of lung opacification measured on the chest CT scan substantially differed
from that of the clinical groups. The approach can remove the subjectivity in the initial assessment of COVID-19
findings.

Mei et al. (2020) proposed a joint model comprising CNN, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and
multilayer perceptron integrated with chest CT scan result and non-image clinical information to predict COVID-19
infection in a patient. CNN was run on the CT image, while the other algorithms classified COVID-19 using the nonimage clinical information. The output of the CNN and the different algorithms were combined to predict the patient’s
COVID-19 infection. The diagnostic tool can rapidly detect COVID-19 infection in patients. Liu et al. (2020) used
logistic regression for the prediction of COVID-19 infection sliding to the severity of the COVID-19 cohort. The
results of the study showed that the CT quantification for the pneumonia lesions could predict the progression of a
patient with COVID-19 to a severe stage at an early, non-invasive level. This situation can provide a prognostic
indicator for coronavirus clinical management. Jiang et al. (2020) applied a machine learning algorithm to predict
COVID-19 clinical severity. They developed a predictive tool that predicts patients at risk for increased COVID-19
severity at the first presentation. The survey can help in the optimal utilization of scarce resources to cope with the
COVID-19 pandemic.
Hurt et al. (2020) collected CXR images from patients with COVID-19 in China and America. They applied a deep
learning algorithm for the early diagnosis of COVID-19 from the CXR. They found that deep learning predicted and
consistently localized areas of pneumonia. The deep learning algorithm can diagnose a patient’s COVID-19 infection
early. Loey et al. (2020) were motivated by the insufficient COVID-19 dataset to propose a generative adversarial
network (GAN) and CNN variant to detect COVID-19 in patients. GAN was used to generate more X-ray images.
Googlenet, Alexnet, and ResNet18 were applied as the deep transfer learning models. They found that Googlenet and
Alexnet scored 80.6%, 85.2%, and 100%, respectively, in the four-, three-, and two-class classification problem,
respectively. The study’s method can facilitate the early detection of COVID-19 and reduce the workload of a
radiologist. Wu et al. (2020) proposed a multi-view ResNet50 for the screening of COVID-19 from chest CT scan
images. ResNet50 was trained with the multi-view chest CT scan images. The results showed that the multi-view
ResNet50 fusion achieved a high performance compared with the single view. The diagnosis tool developed can
reduce the workload of a radiologist by offering fast, accurate COVID-19 diagnosis. Ucar and Korkmaz (2020)
developed a rapid COVID-19 diagnosis tool from X-ray images based on SqeezeNet (a pre-defined CNN) and the
Bayesian optimization method. The SqueezeNet hyperparameters were optimized using the Bayesian optimization
method. Bayesian optimization-based SqueezeNet was applied to detect COVID-19 from X-ray images labeled
normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19. Bayesian-based SqueezeNet outperformed the baseline diagnostic tools.
Togaçar et al. (2020) applied CNN for the exploitation of social mimic and CXR based on fuzzy color and the stacking
method to diagnose COVID-19. The stacked data were trained using CNN, and the features obtained were processed
with mimicking social optimization. The compelling features were used for classification into COVID-19, pneumonia,
and standard X-ray imagery using SVM. Singh et al. (2020) used CNN and multi-objective differential evolution
(MODE) for the early detection of COVID-19 from a chest CT scan image. The initial parameters of the CNN were
tuned using MODE to create a MODE-based CNN and classify patients with COVID-19 based on positive or negative

chest CT scan images. MODE-based CNN outperformed the competitive models (ANN, ANFIS, and traditional
CNN). The proposed method is beneficial for COVID-19 real-time classification owing to its speed in diagnosing
COVID-19. Salman et al. (2020) constructed a CNN-based COVID-19 diagnostic tool for the detection of COVID19 from CXR images. CNN–inceptionV3 was applied to detect COVID-19 from 130 X-ray images of patients infected
with COVID-19 and 130 normal X-ray images. The results indicated that CNN–inceptionV3 could detect COVID-19
from the X-ray images and reduce the testing time required by a radiologist.
Ozturk et al. (2020) used CNN to develop an automated tool for diagnosing COVID-19 from raw CXR images. Binary
and multi-class categories were experimented on using a CNN with 17 convolution layers with a different filter on
each convolution layer. The model can be used for the early screening of patients with COVID-19 and assist the
radiologist in validating COVID-19 screening. Li et al. (2020b) developed an automated framework based on CNN
for the detection of COVID-19 from chest CT scan and differentiate it from community-acquired pneumonia. The
study collected data from 3,322 patients comprising 4,356 chest CT scans. CNN was applied to detect patients with
COVID-19 and typical community pneumonia. The experiment results showed that CNN can distinguish patients with
COVID-19 from those with community-acquired pneumonia and other similar lung diseases. The proposed framework
automated the COVID-19 testing and reduced the testing time and fatigue. Yang et al. (2020b) applied densely
connected convolutional networks optimized with stochastic gradient descent algorithm for the detection of COVID19 from chest CT scan images. Oh et al. (2020) applied patch-based CNN–ResNet-18 (P-CNN) due to lack of
sufficient training data for diagnosing COVID-19 from CXR images. The study used imaging biomarkers of the CXR
radiographs. P-CNN ResNet-18 was applied, and P-CNN produced clinically salient maps that are useful in diagnosing
COVID-19 and patient triage. P-CNN ResNet-18 achieved the best result compared with the baselined algorithm
performance. The limited amount of data can be used for COVID-19 diagnoses and were interpretable. Table 3
summarizes the diagnostic tools developed based on machine learning. Refer to Dong et al. (20202) for an engaging
research review on the role of imaging in the detection and management of COVID-19 disease spread.
4.2 COVID-19 decision support system
The decision support system related to COVID-19 can help decision/policymakers formulate policy to curtail COVID19. Many COVID-19 decision support systems were developed based on machine learning approaches. For example,
Ayyoubzadeh et al. (2020) applied LSTM and linear regression to predict the number of positive cases in Iran. LSTM
and linear regression were used on Google search data to predict the COVID-19 cases in Iran. The results indicated
that linear regression outperforms LSTM in predicting the positive cases of COVID-19. The algorithm can predict the
trend of the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran, which can help policymakers plan the allocation of medical resources.
Chimmula and Zhang (2020) applied deep LSTM for forecasting COVID-19 transmission and possible COVID-19
ending period in Canada and other parts of the world. The transmission rate of Canada was compared with that of Italy
and the USA. The future outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic was predicted to help Canadian decision makers
monitor the COVID-19 situation and prevent the future transmission of the epidemic in Canada.
Liu et al. (2020b) proposed ANN in modeling the trend of COVID-19 and restoring the operational capability of
medical services in China. ANN was used for modeling the pattern of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai, and
Guangzhou. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) was applied for the estimation of nonlocal hospital
demands for the period of COVID-19 pandemic in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. The results indicated that the
number of people infected with COVID-19 would increase by 45%, while death would increase by 567%. COVID19 will reach its peak by March 2020 and toward the end of April 2020. This finding will assist policymakers and
health officials in planning to deal with challenges of the unmet medical requirement of other diseases during the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Pirouz et al. (2020) proposed a group method of data handling in a neural network to predict the number of COVID19 confirmed cases based on weather conditions. The dominant weather condition used included temperature, city
density, humidity, and wind speed. The results indicated that humidity and temperature have a substantial influence
on COVID-19 confirmed cases. Temperature and humidity influence COVID-19 negatively and positively,
respectively. These results can be used by decision makers to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. Yang et al. (2020b)
applied LSTM to predict the COVID-19 trend in China. The prediction model indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic
should peak toward the end of February 2020 and start declining at the end of April 2020. The prediction model can
be used by authorities in China to decide in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaid et al. (2020) adopted a machine
learning approach to predict COVID-19 potential infections based on reported cases in North America. Critical
parameters were identified from dimension reduction. Passed diseases were inferred from recent fatalities using a
hierarchical Bayesian estimator. The model predicted potential COVID-19 infections in North America. Policymakers
in North America can use the projection to curtail the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. Tuli et al. (2020) developed
a machine learning COVID-19 predictive model and deployed it in the cloud computing environment for real-time
tracking of COVID-19, predicting the growth and potential thread of COVID-19 in different countries worldwide.
Government and citizens can use the results for proactive measures to fight COVID-19.

Tiwari et al. (2020) used a machine learning approach to predict the COVID-19 pandemic number of cases, recoveries,
and deaths in India based on data from China. The prediction results indicated that COVID-19 would peak between
the third and fourth week of April 2020. The Indian government can use the study to formulate policies and decide on
mitigating the spread of COVID-19. Ribeiro et al. (2020) evaluated six machine learning algorithms, namely, Cubis
regression (CUBIST), RF, ridge regression (RIDGE), support vector regression (SVR), ARIMA, and stackingensemble learning (SEL), on COVID-19 datasets collected in Brazil to predict confirmed cases for one, three, and six
days ahead. They found that SVR outperformed RIDGE, ARIMA, RF, CUBIST, and SEL. The study can help monitor
COVID-19 cases in Brazil and facilitate critical decisions on COVID-19. Tummers et al. (2020) applied k-means to
cluster documents based on COVID-19 and people with intellectual disability. Table 4 summarizes the studies on
COVID-19 decision support system.
4.3 COVID-19 from genome sequences
The protein sequence of COVID-19 can be collected to apply the machine learning approach for the prediction of
COVID-19 (Qiang et al., 2020). For example, Qiang et al. (2020) predicted the infection risk of non-human origin of
COVID-19 from spike protein for prompt alarm using RF. The genome data comprised of non-human COVID-19
origin (positive) and human COVID-19 origin (negative). RF was applied for the training to predict non-human
COVID-19 origin. The results showed that the RF model achieved high accuracy in predicting non-human COVID19 origin. The study can be used in COVID-19 genome mutation surveillance and exploring evolutionary dynamics
in a simple, fast, and large-scale manner. Randhawa et al. (2020) combined decision tree and digital signal processing
(DT–DSP) to detect the COVID-19 virus genome and identified the signature of intrinsic COVID-19 viruses’ genome.
DT–DSP was applied to explore over 5,000 viral genome sequences with 61.8 million by the 29 viral sequences of
COVID-19. The result obtained supported the bat origin of COVID-19 and successfully classified COVID-19 with
100% accuracy as sub-genus Sarbecovirus within Betacoronavirus. DT–DSP is a reliable real-time alternative
taxonomic classification. Table 5 summarizes the studies.

4.4 COVID-19 drug discovery
Machine learning and AI provide approaches for the speedy processing of a large amount of collected medical data
generated daily as well as the extraction of new information from transversely different applications. In the prediction
of disease, a viral mutation can be forecast before the emergence of new strains. It also allows the prediction of new
structure and availability of broader structural information. Efficient drug repurposing can be achieved in mining
existing data. The stages for the development of COVID-19 drugs are as follows (Park et al., 2020): Disease
prediction: The prediction of future-generation viral mutation can be accomplished by AI and machine learning
approaches. Structural analysis: The COVID-19 structure and primary functional site are characterized. Drug
repurposing: For insight into new disease treatment, existing drug data are mined. New drug development: Efficiencies
across the entire pharmaceutical life cycle are achieved by rapid processing. Ke et al. (2020) applied machine learning

to identify drugs already marketed that can treat COVID-19. They compiled two independent datasets to develop two
machine learning models. The first model was built based on drugs that are known to have antiviral activities. The
second model was built based on 3C-like protease inhibitors. The database of market-approved drugs was screened
by the machine learning model to predict the drugs with potential antiviral activities. The drugs predicted to have
antiviral activities were evaluated against the antiviral activities by a cell-based feline infectious peritonitis virus
duplication assay. The assay results were the machine learning model feedbacks for incremental learning of the model.
Finally, 80 marketed drugs were identified to have potential antiviral activities. Old drugs with antiviral activities
against feline infectious peritonitis COVID-19 were found.
4.5 COVID-19 vaccine development
Typically, the immune system is prepared to elicit antibody or cell-mediated responses against a pathogen by a vaccine
that protects the body from infectious diseases. Immunogenicity is the vaccine ability to the response. For a long-time,
effective immunity, the vaccine has to properly activate innate, adaptive responses (Klein et al., 2010).
The following phases should be adopted to develop a COVID-19 vaccine (Gonzalez-Dias et al., 2020): Dataset
preparation: The quality of the data to be used influences the machine learning algorithm. Thus, preparing quality
data before feeding into the algorithm is sacrosanct. Data come in different sizes ranging from small, medium, and
large. Data quality must be ensured because a quality immune response is needed. The reliability of the data needs to
be guaranteed by ensuring that the serological assay is well qualified in case it is not validated based on known
parameters (linearity, specificity, LLOQ, ruggedness, LLOD, ULOQ, and reproducibility). Vaccines and relevant
genes: In vaccinology, the machine learning algorithm is trained to discover the combination of genes and the best
vaccines parameters. The data for the training are extracted from omics experiment, which will be used to obtain the
required combination. Feature selection is performed to find the best representative of the discriminatory gene
signatures. Then, the new vaccines are predicted. The three main feature selection methods are filter, wrapper, and
embedded. Machine learning algorithm selection: This task is not a straightforward task because many factors must
be considered before selecting the appropriate algorithm for the modeling. The choice of the algorithm depends on
the nature of the data, and the options include supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning. For instance,
if the data have no output, then unsupervised learning algorithm, e.g., k–the nearest neighbor is the possible candidate
algorithm for the modeling but is not guaranteed. Many algorithms have to be tested on solving the same problem
before the algorithm that produces the best output is selected. Model testing: The performance of the model is tested.
The data are partitioned into training and testing; the former is used for training the algorithm, and the latter is used
for evaluating the performance of the model using several performance parameters, e.g., MSE, accuracy, and Fmeasure (Gonzalez-Dias et al., 2020). The application of a machine learning algorithm to sift through trillions of
compounds of the vaccine adjuvants can shorten the vaccine development time. The machine learning algorithm can
be used for screening compounds for a potential adjuvant candidate for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Ahuja et al., 2020).
5. COVID-19 datasets
5.1 Data sources
Ahuja et al. (2020) reported that COVID-19 data are now growing. In this section, we present the sources of COVID19 data to the machine learning community. Given the novelty of the virus, centralizing the collection of sources of
data will help researchers access different types of COVID-19-related data and provide them opportunities to work on
a different aspect of COVID-19 that may lead to novel discoveries. Table 6 has five columns, where the first, second,
third, fourth, and fifth columns represent the reference, data, owners, source/accessibility, and remarks, respectively.
We only present the projects that revealed and fully discussed their data sources.

5.2 COVID-19 on CXR and CT scan images
In this section, we discuss the diagnosis of COVID-19 based on X-ray and CT scan images because of their high value
in COVID-19 screening. Table 6 shows that researchers heavily utilize X-rays and CT scans in developing a machinelearning-based COVID-19 diagnosis tool. Guan et al. (2020) and Wong et al. (2020) found that portable chest
radiography (CXR) has a sensitivity of 59% for the initial detection of COVID-19-related abnormalities. Radiographic
abnormalities, when present, mirror those of CT, with a bilateral lower zone, a peripherally predominant consolidation,
and hazy opacities (Wong et al., 2019). The radiological findings of COVID-19 on CXR are those of atypical
pneumonia or organizing pneumonia (Kooraki et al., 2020). Although chest CT scans are reportedly less sensitive than
CXRs, chest radiography remains the first-line imaging modality of choice used for patients with suspected COVID19 infection (Hui et al., 2020) because it is cheap and readily available, and can easily be cleaned. For ease of
decontamination, the use of portable radiography units is preferred. Chest radiographs are often normal in early or
mild disease. According to a recent study of patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization, 69% had an abnormal
chest radiograph at the initial time of admission, and 80% had radiographic abnormalities sometime during
hospitalization. The findings are reported to be most extensive about 10–12 days after symptom onset. The most
frequent radiographic findings are airspace opacities, whether described as consolidation or less commonly, groundglass opacity (GGO) (Wong et al., 2020). The distribution is most often bilateral, peripheral, and lower zone
predominant (Rodrigues et al., 2020). Unlike parenchymal abnormalities, pleural effusion is rare (3%) (Wong et al.,
2020). According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), even if a chest CT or X-ray suggests COVID-19, viral
testing is the only specific method for diagnosis. Radiography’s sensitivity was reported at only 25% for detection of
lung opacities related to COVID-19, among 20 patients seen in South Korea with a reported specificity of 90% (Wen
et al., 2020). The X-ray image should be considered a useful tool for detecting COVID-19 which is challenging the
healthcare system due to the overflow of patients. As the COVID-19 pandemic grinds on, clinicians on the front lines
may increasingly turn to radiography (Casey, 2020). The most frequent findings are airspace opacities, whether
described as consolidation or less commonly, GGO. The distribution is most often bilateral, peripheral, and lower
zone predominant (Wong et al., 2020). Much of the imaging focus is on CT. In February 2020, Chinese studies
revealed that chest CT achieved a higher sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID-19 compared with initial RT–PCR
tests of pharyngeal swab samples (Ai et al., 2020; Fang et al., 2020). Subsequently, the National Health Commission
of China briefly accepted chest CT findings of viral pneumonia as a diagnostic tool for detecting COVID-19 infection
(Yuen et al., 2020; Zu et al., 2020).

The typical appearance of COVID-19 on chest CT consists of multi-lobar, bilateral, predominantly lower lung zone,
rounded GGOs, with or without consolidation, in a mostly peripheral distribution. However, such findings are
nonspecific; the differential diagnosis includes organizing pneumonia and other infections, drug reactions, and other
inflammatory processes. Consequently, using CT to screen for COVID-19 may result in false positives. Moreover, the
presence of abnormalities not typically associated with COVID-19 infection, including pure consolidation, cavitation,
thoracic lymphadenopathy, and nodules suggests a different etiology (Bernheim et al., 2020). COVID-19-related chest
CT abnormalities are more likely to appear after symptom onset, but they may also precede clinical symptoms. In a
retrospective study by Bernheim et al. (2020), 44% of patients presenting within two days of symptom onset had an
abnormal chest CT, while 91% presenting within 3–5 days and 96% presenting after six days had abnormal chest CTs.
Shi et al. (2020) found GGOs in 14 of 15 asymptomatic healthcare workers with confirmed COVID-19. Similarly,
54% of 82 asymptomatic passengers with COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess cruise ship had findings of viral
pneumonia on the CT (Inui et al., 2020).
In a prospective study by Wang et al., pure GGOs were the only abnormalities seen prior to symptom onset.
Subsequently, 28% of patients developed superimposed septal thickening 6–11 days after symptom onset (Wang et
al., 2020b). Architectural distortion evolving from GGOs appeared later in the disease course, likely reflecting
organizing pneumonia and early fibrosis. Long-term follow-up imaging is also needed to determine the sequelae of
SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a retrospective study by Das et al., 33% of patients who recovered from MERS-CoV
developed pulmonary fibrosis; a similar outcome following COVID-19 is likely (Das et al., 2020). Lung ultrasound
offers a low-cost, point-of-care evaluation of the lung parenchyma without ionizing radiation. The modality is
especially useful in resource-limited settings (Stewart et al., 2020). Peng et al. (2020) found that sonographic findings
in patients with COVID-19 correlated with typical CT abnormalities. The predominantly peripheral distribution of
lung involvement facilitated sonographic visibility. Characteristic findings included thickened, irregular pleural lines,
B lines (edema), and eventual appearance of A lines (air) during recovery. Peng et al. (2020) suggested that ultrasound
may be useful in recruitment maneuver monitoring and guide prone positioning.
Chest CT is an indispensable tool for the early screening and diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 infection in patients.
Previous studies confirmed that the majority of patients infected with COVID-19 exhibited common chest CT
characteristics, including GGOs and consolidation, which reflect lesions affecting multiple lobes or infections in the
bilateral lung parenchyma. Increasing evidence suggests that these chest CT characteristics can be used to screen
suspected patients and serve as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19-caused acute respiratory diseases (ARDS) (Xu et al.,
2020). These findings have led to the modification of the diagnosis and treatment protocols of SARS-CoV-2-caused
pneumonia to include patients with characteristic pneumonia features on chest CT but negative RT–PCR results in
severe epidemic areas such as Wuhan City and Hubei Province (Liu et al., 2020). Patients with negative RT–PCR but
positive CT findings should be isolated or quarantined to prevent clustered or wide-spread infections.
The critical role of CT in the early detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 becomes more publicly acceptable. However,
several studies also reported that a proportion of RT–PCR-positive patients, including several severe cases, had
initially normal CXR or CT findings (Fang et al., 2020). According to the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19, patients
might have no or atypical radiological manifestations even at the mild or moderate stages because several lesions are
easily missed in the low-density resolution of CXR, suggesting that chest CT may be a better modality with a lower
false-negative rate. Another possible explanation is that in several patients, the targeted organ of COVID-19 may not
be the lung. Multiple-organ dysfunctions, including ARDS, acute cardiac injury, hepatic injury, and kidney injury,
have been reported during COVID-19 infection (Huang et al., 2020b). Studies also reported the chest CT appearances
in patients with COVID-19 after treatment, suggesting its critical role in treatment evaluation and follow up. For
example, a study investigated the change in chest CT findings associated with COVID-19 at different time points
during the infection course (Pan et al., 2020). The results showed that most apparent abnormalities on the chest CT
were still observable for 10 days but disappeared at 14 days after the initial onset of symptoms. Unexpectedly, a case
report showed pre- and post-treatment chest CT findings of a 46-year-old woman whose RT–PCR result became
negative, while pulmonary lesions were reversal (Duan et al., 2020).

5.3. Deep learning applications for COVID-19
Singh et al. (2020) developed a deep CNN, which was applied in the automated diagnosis and analysis of COVID-19
in infected patients to save the time and energy of medical professionals. They tuned and used the hyperparameters of
CNN by using multi-objective adaptive differential evolution (MADE). Further in the course of their experiments

which were extensively carried out, they used several benchmark COVID-19 datasets. The data used to evaluate the
performance of their proposed model were divided into training and testing datasets. The training sets were used to
build the COVID-19 classification model. Then, the hyperparameters of the CNN model were optimized on the
training sets by using the MADE-based optimization approach. The results from the comparative analysis showed that
their proposed method outperformed existing machine learning models such as CNN, GA-based CNN, and PSO-based
CNN in terms of different metrics (including F-measure, sensitivity, specificity, and Kappa statistics).
Jaiswal et al. (2020) applied deep learning models for the diagnosis and detection of COVID-19, and it was called
DenseNet201-based deep transfer learning (DTL). The authors used these pre-trained deep learning architecture as
automation tools to detect and diagnose COVID-19 in chest CT scans. The DTL model was used to classify patients
as COVID-19 positive (+ve) or COVID-19 negative (−ve). The proposed model was also utilized to extract several
features by adopting its own learned weights on the ImageNet dataset along with a convolutional neural structure.
Extensive analysis of the experiments showed that the proposed DTL-based COVID-19 model was superior to
competing methods. The proposed DenseNet201 model achieved a 97% accuracy compared with other models and
could serve as an alternative to other COVID-19 testing kits.
Li et al. (2020) developed a fully automated AI system to assess the severity of COVID-19 and its progression
quantitatively using thick-section chest CT images. The AI system was implemented to partition and quantify the
COVID-19-infected lung regions on thick-section chest CT images automatically. The data generated from the
automatically segmented lung abnormalities were compared with those of the manually segmented abnormalities of
two professional radiologists by using the Dice coefficient on a randomly selected subset of 30 CT scans. During
manual and automatic comparisons, two biomarker images were automatically computed, namely, the portion of
infection (POI) and the average infection HU (iHU), which were then used to assess the severity and progression of
the viral disease. The performance of the assessments was then compared with patients’ status of diagnosis reports,
and key phrases were extracted from the radiology reports using the area under the receiver’s operating characteristic
curve (AUC) and Cohen’s kappa statistics. Further in their study, the POI was the only computed imaging biomarker
that was effective enough to show high sensitivity and specificity for differentiating the groups with severe COVID19 and groups with non-severe COVID-19. The iHU reflected the progress rate of the infection but was affected by
several irrelevant factors such as the construction slice thickness and the respiration status. The results of the analysis
revealed that the proposed deep-learning-based AI system accurately quantified the COVID-19 strains associated with
the lung abnormalities, and assessed the virus’ severity and its corresponding progression. Their results also showed
that the deep learning-based tool can help cardiologists in the diagnosis and follow-up treatment for patients with
COVID-19 based on the CT scans.
Singh, Kumar, and Kaur, (2020) used a CNN to classify patients with COVID-19 as COVID-19 +ve or COVID-19
−ve. The initial parameters of CNN were tuned by using MODE. The authors adopted the mutation, crossover, and
selection operations of the differential evolution (DE) algorithm. They extracted the chest CT dataset of COVID-19infected patients and decomposed them into training and testing groups. The proposed MODE-based CNN and
competitive classification models were then applied to the training dataset. They compared the competitive and
proposed classification models by considering different fractions of the training and testing datasets. The extensive
analysis showed that the proposed model classified the chest CT images at reasonable accuracy rates compared with
other competing models, such as ANN, ANFIS, and CNS. The proposed model was also useful for COVID-19 disease
classification from chest CT images.
Asif and Yi (2020) implemented a model that automatically detected COVID-19 pneumonia in patients using digital
CXR images while maximizing the accuracy in detection by using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN). Their
model named DCNN-based model Inception V3 with transfer learning detected COVID-19 infection in patients using
CXR radiographs. The proposed DCNN also provided insights on how deep transfer learning methods were used for
the early detection of the disease. The experimental results showed that the proposed DCNN model achieved high
accuracy. The proposed model also exhibited excellent performance in classifying COVID‐19 pneumonia by
effectively training itself from a comparatively lower collection of images.
Hu et al. (2020) implemented a weak supervised deep learning model for detecting and classifying COVID-19
infection from CT images. The proposed model minimized the requirements of manual labelling of CT images and

accurately detected the viral disease. The model could distinguish positive COVID-19 cases from non-positive
COVID-19 cases by using COVID-19 samples from retrospectively extracted CT images from multiple scanners and
centers. The proposed method accurately pinpointed the exact position of the lesions (inflammations) caused by the
viral COVID-19 and potentially provided advice on the patient’s severity to guide the disease triage and treatment.
The experimental results indicated that the proposed model achieved high accuracy, precision, and classification as
well as good qualitative visualization for the lesion detections.
Ayyoubzadeh et al. (2020) conducted a study to predict the incidence and occurrence of COVID-19 in Iran. The
authors obtained data from the Google Trends website (recommender systems) and used linear regression and LSTM
models to estimate the number of positive COVID-19 cases from the extracted data. Root mean square error and 10fold cross-validation were used as performance metrics. The predictions obtained from the Google Trend’s website
were not very precise but could be used to build a base for accurate models for more aggregated data. Their study
showed that the population (Iranians) focused on the usage of hand sanitizer and handwashing practices with antiseptic
as preventive measures against the disease. The authors used specific keywords related to COVID-19 to extract Google
search frequencies and used the extracted data to predict the degree of COVID-19 epidemiology in Iran. They
suggested future research direction using other data sources such as social media information, people’s contact with
the special call center for COVID-19, mass media, environmental and climate factors, and screening registries.
Randhawa et al. (2020) integrated supervised machine learning with digital signal processing called MLDSP for
genome analyses, which were then augmented by a DT approach to the machine learning component, and a
Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. The authors identified an intrinsic COVID-19
virus genome signature and used it together with a machine-learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast,
scalable, and highly accurate classification of the COVID-19 genomes. They also demonstrated how machine learning
used intrinsic genomic signature to provide a rapid alignment-free taxonomic classification of novel pathogens. The
model accurately classified the COVID-19 virus without having a priori knowledge by simultaneous processing of
the geometric space of all relevant viral genomes. Their result analysis supported the hypothesis of a bat origin and
classified the COVID-19 virus as Sarbecovirus within Betacoronavirus. Also, their results were obtained through a
comprehensive analysis of over 5,000 unique viral sequences through an alignment-free analysis of their 2D genomic
signatures, combined with a DT use of supervised machine learning, and confirmed by Spearman’s rank correlation
coefficient analyses.
Farhat et al. (2020) reviewed the developments of deep learning applications in medical image analysis which targeted
pulmonary imaging and provided insights into contributions to COVID-19. The study covered a survey of various
contributions from diverse fields for about three years and highlighted various deep learning tasks such as
classification, segmentation, and detection as well as different pulmonary pathologies such as airway diseases, lung
cancer, COVID-19, and other infections. The study summarized and discussed current state-of-the-art approaches in
the research domain, highlighting the challenges, especially given the current situation of COVID-19. First, the authors
provided an overview of several medical image modalities, deep learning, and surveys on deep learning in medical
imaging, in addition to available datasets for pulmonary medical images. Second, they provided a summarized survey
on deep-learning-based applications and methods on pulmonary medical images. Third, they described the COVID19 disease and related medical imaging concerns, summarized reviews on deep learning application to COVID-19
medical imaging analysis, and listed and described contributions to this domain. Finally, they discussed the challenges
experienced in the research domain and made suggestions for future research.

6. Survey and bibliometric analysis
6.1 Survey analysis
In this survey, we review the projects that used machine learning to fight COVID-19 from a different perspective. We
only considered published papers in reputable journals, and conferences, and no preprint papers uploaded in preprint
server was used in the survey. We apprised 30 studies that reported the description of the machine learning approach
to fighting COVID-19. We found that machine learning has made an inroad into fighting COVID-19 from a different

aspect with potential for real-life applications to curtail the negative effect of COVID-19. Machine learning algorithms
such as CNN, LSTM, and ANN that are utilized in fighting COVID-19 mostly reported excellent performance
compared with the baseline approaches. Many of the studies complained about the scarcity of sufficient data to carry
out large-scale study because of the novelty of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Frequency

We found that various studies used different COVID-19 data. Figure 4 depicts the type of data used in different studies
that applied machine learning algorithm to develop different models for fighting COVID-19 pandemic. The data used
to plot Figure 4 were extracted from machine learning research on COVID-19 (refer to Table 6). The longest bars
show that X-rays and CT scans have the highest patronage from the studies. Many of the studies used deep learning
algorithms, e.g., CNN and LSTM, for the diagnosis of COVID-19 on X-rays and CT scans. The evaluation indicated
the excellent performance of the algorithms in detecting COVID-19 on X-rays and CT scan images.

Data

Figure 4: Visual representation of COVID-19 data extracted from different projects
The CT scan has a great value in the screening, diagnosis, and follow up of patients with COVID-19. The CT scan
has now been added as a criterion for diagnosing of COVID-19 (Liu et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020). The X-rays with
COVID-19 pandemic data project by Cohen hosted on GitHub is receiving unprecedented attention from the research
community for accessing freely available data. Figure 5 presents the frequency of machine learning algorithms adopted
to fight COVID-19. The longest bar indicates that CNN received the most considerable attention from the researchers
working in this domain to fight COVID-19. The likely reason why CNN has the highest number of applications is that
most of the data used in detecting COVID-19 infection in patients are images (see Figure 4). CNN is well known for
its robustness, effectiveness, and efficiency in image processing compared with other conventional machine learning
algorithms because of its automated feature engineering and high performance. The CNN variant suitable for the
diagnosis of COVID-19 from X-ray and CT scan images is ResNet. However, many of the studies did not provide the
specific type of CNN adopted for the diagnosis of the COVID-19 from X-ray and CT scan images (see Table 3).

Figure 5: Machine learning algorithms adopted in fighting COVID-19

Figure 6 shows the different aspects where machine learning algorithms were applied in fighting COVID-19. We
found that the studies mainly adopted machine learning algorithms in developing COVID-19 diagnosis tools, decision
support system, drug development, and detection from protein sequence. The most extended portion of the pie chart
indicates that diagnostic tools attracted the most considerable attention, showing the quest for diagnostic tools in the
fight against COVID-19 pandemic because the match starts with a diagnosis before the appropriate treatment is
administered to save a life, and incorrect diagnosis can lead to inappropriate medication, resulting in further health
complications. Most of the studies that adopted machine learning to develop diagnostic tools intended to reduce the
workload of radiologists, improve the speed of diagnosis, automate the COVID-19 diagnostic process, reduce the cost
compared with traditional laboratory tests, and help healthcare workers in making critical decisions.

The studies argued that the diagnostic tool could reduce the exposure of healthcare workers to patients with COVID19, thus decreasing the risk of spreading COVID-19 to healthcare workers. The second part of the pie chart with the
most substantial portion is the decision support system for detecting the rate of spread of the virus, confirmed cases,
mortalities, and recovered cases. This information from the decision support system can help the government
functionaries, policymakers, decision makers, and other stakeholders in formulating policy that can help fight COVID19 pandemic.

Figure 7: Trend of publications on machine learning applications in fighting COVID-19

Figure 7 shows that the publications on the adoption of machine learning to fight COVID-19 started appearing in 2020
with no publications in 2019, although COVID-19 started appearing in late 2019. This situation is likely because a
new virus-like the COVID-19 pandemic at the initial stage lacks data and has scant information and uncertainties.
6.2 Bibliometric analysis
The primary purpose of conducting a bibliometric analysis study in this study is to reflect the trend of rapidly emerging
topics on COVID-19 research, where substantial research activity has already begun extensively during the early stage
of the outbreak. Another significance of the bibliometric analysis method presented is to aid in the mapping of research
situation on coronavirus disease as reported in several scientific works of literature by the research community. In this
section, we present the bibliographic coupling among different article items on machine learning to fight COVID-19.
The link between the items on the constructed map corresponds to the weight between them either in terms of the
number of publications, common references, or co-citations. These items may belong to a group or a cluster. In the
visualization, items within the same cluster are marked with the same color, and colors indicate the cluster to which a
journal was assigned by the clustering technique implemented by the VOSviewer software. The circular node may
represent the items, and their sizes may vary depending on the weight of the article (Ezugwu et al., 2020).
6.2.1 Prolific authors
The bibliographic coupling between the top 25 authors is shown in Figure 8. The two clusters, namely, red and green,
correspond to all authors working on similar research fields “COVID-19” and citing the same source in their reference
listings. The similarity in cluster color for the authors also implies that the degree of overlap between the reference
lists of publications of these authors is higher. Figure 8 shows the visible names, and other names may not be
represented in the constructed map.

Red represents China and the USA with the highest strength in terms of contributions, after which comes India and
Iran as the next countries within the red node. Green represents Hong Kong, which appears to have the highest strength,
whereas blue is for the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia that have the highest strength. Yellow denotes Japan,
Singapore, Thailand, and Taiwan as the highest contributors. Purple refers to Italy and Canada as the two contributing
countries. The link between the red and green clusters are thicker compared with that between the blue and red clusters,
or between the blue and purple clusters. The thickness of the link simply depicts the degree of intersection of the
literature work between the different locations or countries.

6.2.3 Collaborating institution
Figure 10 shows the bibliographic coupling of the network of collaborating institutions that are affiliated with at least
four documents on COVID-19 research. Map construction and analysis show that of the 949 institutions, 28 meet the
thresholds of collaborating institutions, including the Guangzhou Center for Disease Control (or Chinese Center for
Disease Control and Prevention), Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan University, Capital
Medical University, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, University of Hong Kong, Sun Yat-Sen University, and

6.2.5 Co-authorship and authors
Figure 12 illustrates the co-authors and author map visualization. This analysis aims to produce the visualization of
all the major authors publishing together or working on similar research fields. The analysis type is co-authorship, and
the unit of analysis is authors. The threshold of the minimum number of papers by an author is 25. Network
construction and analysis shows that of 2,381 authors, only 9 authors meet the limits. However, the most extensive set
of connected entities consists of only 8 authors, whose visual representation is depicted in Figure 12, where only one
cluster is denoted by red color. The connected link illustrates that these authors have collaborated on the same project
or worked on the same research with a similar focus. The thickness of the link between these three authors indicates
more common publications.

7. Challenges and future research opportunities
In this section, we present challenges and future research prospects. More so, Figure 15 describes the course of
conducting the literature survey and opportunities for future research with the possibility of solving the challenges to
help expert researchers easily identify areas that need development. The challenges and future research opportunities
are presented as follows:
Lack of sufficient COVID-19 data: The primary concern with the research in COVID-19 is the barrier prompted by
the lack of adequate COVID-19 clinical data (Alimadadi et al., 2020; Mei et al., 2020; Ayyoubzadeh et al., 2020; Fong
et al., 2020; Oh et al., 2020; Togaçar et al., 2020; Ucara and Korkmazb, 2020; Belfiore et al., 2020; Oyelade and
Ezugwu, 2020). However, an in-depth analysis of patients with COVID-19 requires much more data (Apostolopoulos
and Mpesiana, 2020). Data is the key component in machine learning. Machine learning approaches typically
experience a limitation in their efficiency and effectiveness in solving machine learning problems without sufficient
data. Therefore, insufficient COVID-19 clinical data can limit the performance of specific machine learning
algorithms, such as deep learning algorithms that require large-scale data. In this case, developing machine-learningbased COVID-19 diagnostic and prognosis tools, and therapeutic approaches to curtail COVID-19, and predicting a
future pandemic can face a severe challenge in terms of performance due to insufficient COVID-19 clinical data.
Alimadadi et al. (2020) suggested global collaborations among stakeholders to build COVID-19 clinical database and
mitigate the issue of inadequate COVID-19 clinical data. Existing biobanks containing the data of patients with
COVID-19 are integrated with COVID-19 clinical data. We suggest that researchers use GAN to generate additional
X-rays and CT scan images for COVID-19 to obtain sufficient data for building COVID-19 diagnosis tools. For
example, Loey et al. (2020) were motivated by insufficient data and used GAN to generate more X-ray images and
develop a COVID-19 diagnostic tool.
Visualization from X-rays and CT Scan: Figure 4 shows that X-ray and CT scan are the two primary clinical data for
detecting COVID-19 infection in patients. Distinguishing patients with COVID-19 and mild symptoms from
pneumonia on X-ray images could be visualized inaccurately or cannot be visualized totally (Apostolopoulos and
Mpesiana, 2020). We suggest that researchers propose machine learning strategies that can accurately differentiate
patients with COVID-19 and mild symptoms from patients with pneumonia symptoms based on X-ray images.
COVID-19 that is caused by coronavirus might have a CT scan image characteristic similar to other pneumonia caused
by a different virus. In the future, the performance of CNN should be evaluated in classifying COVID-19 and viral
pneumonia with RT–PCR (Li et al., 2020b)
Uncertainties: When a new pandemic breaks out, it comes with limited information and very high uncertainly, unlike
the commonly known influenza. Therefore, knowledge regarding the new epidemic is not sufficient due to the absence
of a prior case that is the same as the recent pandemic. In the case of COVID-19, many of the decision makers relied
on SARS for reference because of the similarity, even though it is considerably different from COVID-19. The new
pandemic typically poses a challenge to data analytics, considering its limited information and geographical and
temporal evolving of the recent epidemic. Therefore, an accurate model for predicting the future behavior of a
pandemic becomes challenging due to uncertainty (Fong et al., 2020). We suggest that researchers propose a new
pandemic forecasting model based on active learning in machine learning to reduce the level of uncertainty, typically
accompanying new pandemics such as COVID-19.
Non-uniform pattern: Liu et al. (2020) applied Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered (SEIR) for modeling
COVID-19. However, the SEIR model could not capture the complete number of infected cases, while the study
ignored imported COVID-19 confirmed cases. SEIR was based on the people’s natural distribution and cannot apply
to welfare institute an example of different population distribution. The epidemiological trend of COVID-19 was not
predicted accurately by the SEIR model under the viral mutation and specific ant-viral therapy development scenario.

The SEIR model was unable to simulate non-uniform patterns, such as the issue of increasing medical professionals
and bed capacity (Liu et al., 2020). We suggest that researchers propose a machine-learning-based strategy for
handling the non-uniform pattern in the future and consider all the other factors not considered in the study.
Insufficient regional data: Adequate COVID-19 data for a particular region are lacking because the capacity to gather
reliable data is not uniform across regions worldwide. This situation can bring a challenge to the region without
available COVID-19 data. We suggest that researchers apply the cross-population train–test model because a model
trained in a different region can be used to detect COVID-19 in a different region. For example, the model trained to
detect the new virus in Wuhan, China, can be used in Italy (Santosh, 2020).

Image resolution: The resolution of the X-ray images affects the performance of the machine learning algorithm.
Dealing with low-resolution images typically poses a challenge to the machine learning approach. Variable size of the
resolution dimension has a negative effect. Successful performance cannot be achieved if the input images of the data
have different sizes. The original image resolution dimension, structured images, and stacking technique need to be
the same (Togaçar et al., 2020). We suggest high-resolution X-ray images for developing COVID-19 diagnostic and
prognosis system with the ability to work with low-resolution X-ray images.
Outliers and noise: At the early phase of COVID-19, the COVID-19 data contained many outliers and much noise
(Tuli et al., 2020). An outlier in data is a subset of the data that appears with inconsistencies from the remaining data.
Outliers typically lower the fit of a statistical model (Bellazzi et al., 1998). The presence of outliers and noise in
COVID-19 makes predicting the correct number of COVID-19 cases challenging (Tuli et al., 2020). Dealing with
outliers and noise in data increases data engineering efforts and expenses. We suggest that researchers propose a robust
machine learning approach that can effectively handle outliers and noise in COVID-19 data.
Transparency and interpretability: The limitation of deep learning algorithms is a deficiency in terms of transparency
and interpretability. For instance, knowing the image features that are applied to decide the output of the deep learning
algorithms is not possible. The unique features used by the deep learning algorithm to differentiate COVID-19 from
CAP cannot be sufficiently visualized by the heatmap, although the heatmap is used to visualize region in images that
led to the algorithm output (Li et al., 2020b). Images, especially X-rays and CT scans, are heavily relied on in detecting
COVID-19. We suggest that researchers propose explainable deep learning algorithms for the detection of COVID19 to instill transparency and interpretation in deep learning algorithms.
Misdiagnosis: The application of a deep learning algorithm to detect COVID-19 on a chest CT scan has the possibility
of misdiagnosis (Wu et al., 2020) because of the similarity of the COVID-19 symptoms with other types of pneumonia
(Belfiore et al., 2020). Incorrect diagnoses can mislead the health professional in deciding and lead to inappropriate
medication, further complicating the health condition of the patient with COVID-19. We suggest that researchers
combine the CT scan diagnosis using deep learning algorithm with clinical information such as the nucleic acid
detection results, clinical symptoms, epidemiology, and laboratory indicators to avoid misdiagnosis (Wu et al., 2020).
Resource allocation: Resource allocation is a challenge as the COVID-19 pandemic keeps spreading because the
increase in the number of patients means more resources are required to take care of them. The allocation of limited
resources in a rapidly expanding pandemic entails a difficult decision for the distribution of scarce resources (Jiang et
al., 2020). The epicenters of the COVID-19 are challenged with resource problems of shortage of beds, gowns, masks,
medical staff, and ventilators (Ahuja et al., 2020; Taiwo and Ezugwu, 2020). We propose the development of a
machine learning decision support system to help in crucial decisions on resource allocation.
8. Conclusions
In this study, we propose a survey, including a bibliometric analysis of the adoption of machine learning, to fight
COVID-19. The concise summary of the projects that adopted machine learning to fight COVID-19, sources of
COVID-19 datasets, new comprehensive taxonomy, synthesis and analysis, and bibliometric analysis is presented.
The results reveal that COVID-19 diagnostic tools received the most considerable attention from researchers, and
energy and resources are more dispensed toward automated COVID-19 diagnostic tools. By contrast, COVID-19
drugs and vaccine development remain grossly underexploited. The algorithm predominantly utilized by the
researchers in developing the diagnostic tool is CNN mainly from X-rays and CT scan images. The most suitable
CNN architecture for the detection of COVID-19 from the X-ray and CT scan images is ResNet. The challenges
hindering practical work on machine learning to fight COVID-19 and a new perspective to solve the identified
problems are presented in the study. We believe that our survey with bibliometric analysis could enable researchers
to determine areas that need further development and identify potential collaborators at author, country, and
institutional levels.
Based on the bibliometric analysis conducted on the global scientific research output on COVID-19 disease spread
and preventive measures, the analysis results reveal that most of the research outputs were published in prestigious
journals with high influence factors. These journals include The Lancet, Journal of Medical Virology, and

Eurosurveillance. The bibliometric analysis also shows the focused subjects in various aspects of COVID-19 infection
transmission, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and its complications. Other prominent features include strong
collaboration among research institutions, universities, and co-authorships among researchers across the globe.
Machine learning algorithms have many practical applications in medicine, and novel contributions from different
researchers are still evolving and growing exponentially in a bid to satisfy the essential clinical needs of the individual
patients, as it is the case with its application to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. As a way forward, we suggest an
in-depth machine learning application review that would focus on the critical analysis of the novel coronavirus disease
and other related cases of global pandemics.
