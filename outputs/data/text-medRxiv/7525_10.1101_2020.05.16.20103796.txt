ABSTRACT
Objectives A kind of pneumonia caused by unknown causes that occurred in Wuhan, Hubei, China in
December 2019, was reported as a result of novel coronavirus infection on January 7, 2020, and then WHO
named it COVID-19. To compare the difference of epidemiology and clinical characteristics between
asymptomatic COVID-19 infections and moderate type of confirmed cases.
Methods Retrospective, single-center cohort study of COVID-19 involving 52 infections of both 26
asymptomatic and 26 moderate type of confirmed cases in the recovery stage at Guizhou Provincial Staff
Hospital in Guiyang, China, from January 29, to March 31, 2020; final date of follow-up was April 22. This
study was registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry Center. Documented the asymptomatic COVID-19
infections and moderate type of confirmed cases. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory,
radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of
asymptomatic COVID-19 infections and moderate type of confirmed cases were compared.
Results The median treatment cycle of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections was 16 days (interquartile range,
11-20 days) and longer than 13 days (interquartile range, 10-15 days) of moderate type of confirmed cases
(p=0.049). The median incubation period of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections was 10 days (interquartile
range, 0-21 days), while the control group was 7 days (interquartile range, 1-15 days) (p=0.27). On the
initial chest computerized tomography (CT) check, 18 (69.2%, 18/26) asymptomatic COVID-19 infections
were no imaging changes, which was of no significance compared with 12 (46.2%, 12/26) patients with
moderate type of confirmed patients (p=0.092).
Conclusions In this single-center study, we found that asymptomatic COVID-19 infections have longer
treatment cycle than those moderate type of confirmed cases.

Original Research

A kind of pneumonia caused by unknown causes that occurred in Wuhan, Hubei, China in December 2019,
was reported as a result of novel coronavirus infection on January 7, 20201,2, and then World Health
Organization named it coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on February 113. As of May 1, 2020,
0:00-24:00, there were 989 cases of asymptomatic COVID-19 in China under medical observation.4 The
New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program in China (The Fifth Edition) clearly stated
that asymptomatic infections may be a source of infection.5 Experts pointed out that asymptomatic
COVID-19 infectors bring challenges to epidemic prevention and control due to their lack of clinical
manifestations and the continuous reproduction of SARS-CoV-2 in vivo and their release to the outside
world, which made them an important source of infection6. However, it is unclear what the difference of
epidemiological and clinical characteristics between asymptomatic COVID-19 infections and moderate type
of confirmed patients are. We aim to analyzed and compare the difference of epidemiological and clinical
characteristics between asymptomatic COVID-19 infections and moderate type of confirmed cases via the
COVID-19 clinical database of Guizhou province, China.

Methods
Design
This is a retrospective, single-center cohort study of COVID-19 involving 52 infections of both 26
asymptomatic and 26 moderate type of confirmed cases in the recovery stage at Guizhou Provincial Staff
Hospital in Guiyang, China, from January 29, to March 31, 2020; final date of follow-up was April 22. This
study was registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry Center.
Setting
A tertial hospital of COVID-19 medical center in Guizhou Province.

Exclusion criteria: Non-COVID-19 infections. All data were obtained from the records of a hospital
information system (HIS) in Guizhou Provincial Staff Hospital. Despite the retrospective study design
involving electronic health records and no additional interventions, written informed consent was required
from those patients or their relatives. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Affiliated
Hospital of Zunyi Medical University. This study was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Register
(CCTR number: ChiCTR2000032770, registered 10 May 2020). URL: http://www.chictr.org.cn/edit. aspx?

Exposures
Documented the asymptomatic COVID-19 infections and moderate type of confirmed patients.
Case Definition
According to the sixth edition of New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program in China7,
asymptomatic COVID-19 infections refer as those susceptible population who have been infected with
SARS-CoV-2 without clinical symptoms (such as fever, cough, sore throat, etc.), but the RT-PCR of swab
throat test appeared a positive results. The confirmed COVID-19 case is defined as those susceptible
population were infected by SARS-CoV-2 and appeared some specific clinical manifestations, such as fever,
dry cough, sore throat, anorexia, diarrhea, etc., as well as the positive changes of chest computed
tomography (CT) check and RT-PCR of swab throat test. Moreover, according to the severity of the disease,
the confirmed COVID-19 cases are divided into four categories: mild type, moderate type, severe type, and
critical type.
Main outcomes and measures Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and
treatment data were collected and analyzed. Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of confirmed
COVID-19 infections and asymptomatic infections were compared.

Original Research

Categorical variables were described as frequency rates and percentages, and continuous variables were
described using mean, median, and interquartile range(IQR) values. Means for Continuous variables were
compared using independent group t tests when the data were normally distributed; otherwise, the
Mann-Whitney test was used. Data (non-normal distribution) from repeated measures were compared using
the generalized linear mixed model. Proportions for categorical variables were compared using the χ2 test,
although the Fisher exact test was used when the data were limited. All statistical analyses were performed
using SPSS version 13.0 software (SPSS Inc). For unadjusted comparisons, a 2-sided α of less than .05 was
considered statistically significant. The analyses have not been adjusted for multiple comparisons and, given
the potential for type I error, the findings should be interpreted as exploratory and descriptive.

Results
The CONSORT Flow Diagram of this study unfolded in Figure 1. One hundred and forty six medical record
number were selected by researcher. After we deleted the duplication of those number, there were 135 cases
with COVID-19 infections. Twenty-six asymptomatic COVID-19 infections was regarded as the observation
cohort, and another 26-moderate type of confirmed cases from those leaving 109 patients with confirmed
COVID-19 infections formed a controlled cohort. We compared the epidemiological and clinical features
between the two cohorts.
Baseline characteristics
Twenty-six asymptomatic COVID-19 infections were regarded as an observation cohort. In this cohort, there
were 14 male patients and account for 53.8% (14/26), and the median age was 24 years (interquartile range,
12-36 years). In racial composition, 25 COVID-19 infections belong to Han nationality (96.2%), and only
one case is minority. Twenty-two (84.6%, 22/26) cases lived in Guizhou province, and 4 (15.4%, 4/26) lived
in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei. Eleven cases (42.3%, 11/26) of COVID-19 infections had a history of
living in situ. There were 19 cases (73.1%, 19/26) of COVID-19 infections with a familial clustered onset

with median incubation of 10 days (interquartile range, 0-21 days). Median treatment cycle of 16 days
(interquartile range, 11-20 days). Eighteen COVID-19 infections (69.2%, 18/26) had no clinical changes in
the first check of chest CT image, 8 cases (36.4%, 8/26) showed an increase in lymphocyte ratio, 6 cases
(27.3%, 6/26) had a decrease in neutrophil ratio, and a decrease in leukocyte count.
Age and gender were regarded as the matching factors, the same number of moderate type of confirmed
COVID-19 infections were selected as a controlled cohort. The main onset symptoms of those COVID-19
infections were fever, and had 7 cases (26.9%, 7/26), cough 6 cases (23.1%, 6/26), expectoration 4 cases
(15.4%, 4/26). In this cohort, there were 12 male infections and accounted for 46.2% (12/26). The median
age was 24 years (interquartile range, 12-35 years), and there was no significant difference (p=0.92) for age
difference analysis between the cohort of asymptomatic and moderate type of confirmed COVID-19
infections. Of the 25 cases (96.2%, 25/26) of Han nationality, 20 cases (76.9%, 20/26) of infections lived in
Guizhou province, 14 cases (53.8%, 14/26) had no history of epidemic in situ, 18 cases (69.2%, 18/26) were
familial clustered onset, median incubation period was 7 days (interquartile range, 1-15 days), median
treatment period was 13 days (interquartile range, 10-15 days). Twelve COVID-19 infections (46.2%, 12/26)
had no clinical changes in the first check of chest CT, and the abnormal laboratory examination indexes of
those COVID-19 patients were rare, mainly focused on platelet count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate,
and we also found that 4 cases (17.4%, 4/26) had an increased lymphocyte ratio.
Analysis of Variances
The age, incubation period and treatment cycle of the metrological data of 52 infections were tested
normally, which was skewed distribution. The differences in epidemiological and clinical characteristics
between moderate type of confirmed cases and asymptomatic infections were compared (Table 1). The
statistical results showed that the treatment cycle of asymptomatic cohort was significantly longer than
moderate type of confirmed cohort (p =0.049).

Original Research

Treatment cycle
The average treatment cycle of infections with moderate type of confirmed COVID-19 patients was reported
to be 14 days and within8. In this research, the median treatment cycle of asymptomatic COVID-19
infections was 16 days (interquartile range, 11-20 days), while the median treatment cycle of controlled
group was 13 days (interquartile range, 10-15 days). The treatment cycle of asymptomatic COVID-19
infections was longer than that of confirmed moderate type of infections, and the difference between the two
groups was significant (p=0.049).
Incubation period
Studies have shown that the average incubation from COVID-19 possible exposure time to the first onset of
the disease was 5 days9. In this study, the mean incubation of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections was 12
days, median incubation was 10 days (interquartile range, 0-21 days), and median incubation of controlled
group was 9 days, median incubation 7 days (interquartile range, 1-15 days). In this study, the incubation
period of asymptomatic infections was longer than that of previous studies, and the incubation period of
COVID-19 asymptomatic infections was also longer than that of moderate type of confirmed infections, but
there was no significant difference between the two groups (p=0.273).
Initial check of chest CT
Chest CT check has a high diagnostic value in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia10-13. Whereas in this
study, the first chest CT check of 18 (69.2%, 18/26) asymptomatic COVID-19 infections had no clinical
changes, while the moderate type of confirmed infections had 12 cases (46.2%, 12/26). Asymptomatic
COVID-19 infections had fewer imaging changes after infection with SARS-CoV-2 than confirmed
infections. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups (p=0.092).
Laboratory data
In view of laboratory test of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections, 8 cases (36.4%, 8/22) had an increased

lymphocyte ratio, 6 cases (27.3%, 6/22) had leukopenia, 4 (18.2%, 4/22) had a decreased lymphocyte ratio
and increased platelets, 3 cases (15.8%, 3/19) occurred in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) more than
20 mm per hour; while in the controlled group, 5 cases (21.7%, 5/23) had increased platelet count and 4
cases (17.4%, 4/23) had increased lymphocyte ratio. High lymphocyte ratio, neutropenia and leukopenia all
showed clinical laboratory characteristics of COVID-19 infections. There was no significant difference in
laboratory variables between the two groups (p>0.05).

Discussion
In the susceptible population of SARS-CoV-2, the elderly and those who have co-morbidities including
hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, etc., were more susceptible and more
likely to develop into severe or critical cases, even had higher mortality1,14-16. Early studies on novel
coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) found that male patients were more susceptible than women17. Therefore,
when we began to design this study, we had fully considered the influence of age and gender on the disease,
and formed the controlled cohort. Factually, there was no significant difference in age and gender between
the observation group and the control group (p=0.919 & 0.579), which proved that the baseline of the two
groups was consistent.
Treatment cycle of COVID-19 infections
In the study, we found that the treatment cycle of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections was significantly
longer than moderate type of confirmed cases (p=0.049). The treatment cycle of asymptomatic COVID-19
infections was 16 days (interquartile range, 11-20 days), while that of control group was 13 days
(interquartile range, 10-15 days). The reason that asymptomatic infections have longer treatment period than
moderate type of confirmed cases are as follows: Firstly, the prolonged incubation period of asymptomatic
infections was more likely cause SARS-CoV-2 to survive in the body for a long time. Secondly, due to lack
of obvious clinical symptoms, it is not enough to judge the remission only by both RT-PCR of throat swab

and imaging check of chest CT. Thirdly, our understanding and reorganization with the infectivity of
asymptomatic COVID-19 infections is limited.
Incubation of COVID-19 infections
In this research, the median incubation of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections was 10 days (interquartile
range, 0-21 days). In Chinese coronavirus profiling, the median incubation of confirmed COVID-19
infections was 4 days (interquartile range, 2-7 days)16, while that of our study was 7 days (interquartile range,
1 to 15 days). The incubation period of both asymptomatic and moderate type of COVID-19 infections in
the study were longer than that of the previous study. The reasons are unveiled as follows: Firstly, since
Guizhou Province was a non-epidemic area, the initiation time of the prevention and control on the epidemic
of COVID-19 was later than that of surrounding provinces. Secondly, most of the early COVID-19
infections did not report in time after exposure, resulting in a longer incubation period than other epidemic
areas. Therefore, moving forward the time window of COVID-19 detection is an important measure to cut
off the transmission path. Simultaneously, it is an important task to track and check those who confirmed
and asymptomatic COVID-19 infections, as well as close contacts.
Imaging check of chest CT
Imaging check of chest CT has a high diagnostic value in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. However,
there are also a few COVID-19 infections with positive RT-PCR of swab throat or clinical manifestations,
but there is no abnormal imaging changes on the initial chest CT check18. In this study, the CT imaging
feature of 18 asymptomatic COVID-19 infections (69.2%, 18/26) had no changes on the first check, and the
number of those infections were more than moderate type of confirmed cases. This kind of imaging feature
of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections may be related to the individual's immune status, co-morbidities, and
ages. Once they owned the resistance to SARS-CoV-2, they may become the asymptomatic COVID-19
infections, which led to their initial image feature not be easy to detect the positive signs of chest CT check.

Original Research

Just as the imaging data analysis of asymptomatic infections in a hospital in Nanjing, among 24
asymptomatic infections included in the study, 7 (29.2%, 7/24) cases had no imaging changes for the first
time19. Certainly, we do not deny the diagnostic value of chest CT check, particularly in asymptomatic
infections. After all, it is conducive to early detection, early isolation, and early treatment of COVID-19
infections.
Laboratory detection
RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2
RT-PCR test of SARS-CoV-2 has almost always been the gold standard for the diagnosis and cure
evaluation of COVID-19 infections. Factually, we also regarded this test as an evaluation criterion of
diagnosis and treatment efficacy of COVID-19 infections in this study. Both incubation period and treatment
cycle were calculated according to this criterion.
Other laboratory examinations
Laboratory examination of patients with COVID-19 is mainly characterized by leukopenia or lymphocyte
count reduction. However, according to the characteristics of early stage of COVID-19 infections, the results
of RT-PCR screening in close contact with 738 infections with COVID-19 showed that only 2.70% (2/74)
asymptomatic infections met this characteristics of the blood routine test.20 In this study, there was no
significant difference between asymptomatic and moderate type of COVID-19 infections (p>0.05).
To sum up, the treatment cycle of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections is longer than those moderate type of
confirmed cases (p=0.049), the incubation period of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections is longer than that
of moderate type of confirmed cases, and most of them have no imaging changes of chest CT check, which
brings great challenges to prevention and control of current COVID-19.

Original Research

We, for the first time, constructed this cohort study of 26 asymptomatic infections and 26 moderate type of
COVID-19 patients using the COVID-19 database in Guizhou province, and compared the differences in
epidemiological and clinical characteristics between the two cohorts. Secondly, the results of this study
provided a good evidence for the prevention and control of global COVID-19.
Defects and deficiencies of this study
Firstly, this is a single-center and retrospective case-control study. Secondly, the sample size of this study is
still small due to the limitation of the number of COVID-19 infections in Guizhou province, so it is difficult
to estimate the overall characteristics of COVID-19 asymptomatic infections.

Conclusions
In this single-center study, we found that asymptomatic COVID-19 infections have longer treatment cycle
than those moderate type of confirmed cases.
