Summary box:
Evidence before this study:
Globally, residents in care homes have experienced disproportionately high morbidity and
mortality from COVID-19. Excess mortality incorporates all direct and indirect mortality
effects of the pandemic.
We searched MEDLINE for published literature, pre-publication databases (medRxiv and
Lancet pre-print) and grey literature (ONS and Google) for care homes AND COVID-19 AND
mortality, to 31st October 2020. We screened for evidence on excess deaths in care homes
in England, and international evidence of the association of COVID-19 deaths and outbreaks
with care home characteristics.
Official estimates from England and Wales have reported aggregated excess deaths by
place of occurrence, but we identified no peer-reviewed excess deaths study in this setting.
These aggregates, however, do not account for care home residents dying in other settings
(e.g. hospital), nor provide sufficient information to reflect on the impacts of enacted policies
over the period, or to inform new policies for future virus waves.
Previous peer-reviewed and pre-publication studies have also shown the heterogeneous
effects of COVID-19 by care home characteristics in other countries. Particularly important
from the current literature appears to be care home size, with larger care homes tending to
be associated with more negative outcomes in studies with smaller sample sizes. A study
from the Lothian region of Scotland additionally found excess deaths concentrated in a
minority of homes that experienced an outbreak. However, a national breakdown of excess
deaths by care home characteristics is largely lacking from the current literature in England,
with a specific market structure and policy context.
Added value of this study:
We use nationally representative administrative data from all care homes in England to
estimate overall excess deaths and by care home characteristics: setting type (nursing or
residential home), client types (offering services for people aged 65+ and/or people with
dementia or offering services to children and adults), ownership status (whether not-for-profit
- charity/NHS/LA-run homes - or for-profit), whether known to be affiliated to a large
provider/brand or independent, and classification according to their registered maximum bed
capacity (small, medium and large).
We then used multivariable logistic regression to estimate the adjusted odds of a care home
experiencing a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 death across these characteristics.
We found that only 65% of excess deaths were flagged as officially confirmed/suspected
COVID-19 attributed. However, almost all excess deaths occurred in the roughly quarter of
care homes that reported at least one suspected/confirmed COVID-19 death. After adjusting
for other care home characteristics, larger care homes (vs. small) had the highest odds of
experiencing at least one suspected/confirmed COVID-19 death. These findings confirm
those from the previous literature, in a unique policy context and with national data.
Implications of all the available evidence:
The fact that nearly all excess deaths occurred in care homes with at least one COVID-19
attributed death suggests that directly-attributed deaths are very likely to be under-recorded.
It also suggests that any indirect mortality effect, of COVID-19 and any enacted policies,
were predominantly constrained to those homes experiencing an outbreak.

Larger homes are likely to experience higher footfall in general, and so higher probability of
contact with an infected individual, which is likely a contributing factor to the association.
Furthermore, it might be easier to ensure person-centred protocols in small care homes due
to the scale.
There is an urgent need for further research to explore the mechanisms in relation to care
home characteristics. Also, to empirically test effective interventions, in consideration of
additional impacts on quality of life and psychological wellbeing. However, until this is
possible, prioritising existing resources, such as testing and PPE equipment, for care homes
to prevent ingress of disease is key to preventing large excess mortality.

ABSTRACT:
Background: To estimate excess mortality for care home residents during the COVID-19
pandemic in England, exploring associations with care home characteristics.
Methods: Daily number of deaths in all residential and nursing homes in England notified to
the Care Quality Commission (CQC) from 1st January 2017 to 7th August 2020. Care home
level data linked with CQC care home register to identify homes characteristics: client type
(over
65s/children
and
adults),
ownership
status
(for-profit/not-for-profit;
branded/independent), and size (small/medium/large).
Excess deaths computed as the difference between observed and predicted deaths using
local authority fixed-effect Poisson regressions on pre-pandemic data. Fixed-effect logistic
regressions were used to model odds of experiencing COVID-19 suspected/confirmed
deaths.
Findings: Up to 7th August 2020 there were 29,542 (95%CI: 25,176 to 33,908) excess
deaths in all care homes. Excess deaths represented 6.5% (95%CI: 5.5% to 7.4%) of all
care home beds, higher in nursing (8.4%) than residential (4.6%) homes. 64.7% (95%CI:
56.4% to 76.0%) of the excess deaths were confirmed/suspected COVID-19. Almost all
excess deaths were recorded in the quarter (27.4%) of homes with any COVID-19 fatalities.
The odds of experiencing COVID-19 attributable deaths were higher in homes providing
nursing services (OR: 1.8, 95%CI: 1.6 to 2.0); to older people and/or with dementia (OR: 5.5,
95%CI: 4.4 to 6.8); among larger (vs. small) homes (OR: 13.3, 95%CI: 11.5 to 15.4);
belonging to a large provider/brand (OR: 1.2, 95%CI: 1.1 to 1.3). There was no significant
association with for-profit status of providers.
Interpretation: To limit excess mortality, policy should be targeted at care homes to
minimise the risk of ingress of disease and limit subsequent transmission. Our findings
provide specific characteristic targets for further research on mechanisms and policy priority.

1. Introduction
Globally, residents in care homes have experienced disproportionately high
morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. Across Europe, countries adopting more
relaxed strategies to tackle the pandemic, such as Sweden, and those adopting
severe lockdowns, like Spain and the UK, have both struggled to protect vulnerable
persons in care homes.1,2 Early international evidence suggests that nearly half of all
COVID-19 deaths in five European countries were among care home residents.2
Directly attributed COVID-19 deaths do not necessarily capture the full impact on
mortality, however.3 Death toll for COVID-19 relies on SARS-CoV-2 testing, with
tests particularly supply-constrained in early parts of the pandemic. Indirect fatalities
due to non-COVID-19-related causes might also have increased. For example,
through increased risks of harm from isolation4 and possible delayed/cancelled

hospital admissions resulting in unintended iatrogenic events and further deaths.
Excess deaths, the additional deaths observed in a given period compared to the
number usually expected, better capture direct and indirect mortality impacts.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) in England and Wales have reported
aggregated excess deaths by place of occurrence. There was approximately a 79%
increase in total deaths in care homes in England and Wales from 2nd March to 12th
June compared to 2015-19.5,6 These aggregates, however, do not account for care
home residents dying in other settings (e.g. hospital), nor provide sufficient
information to reflect on the impacts of enacted policies over the period, or to inform
new policies for future virus waves.
Likely, not all care homes suffered equally from COVID-19.7 In Canada, for-profit
status was associated with the number of residents infected and deaths after an
outbreak.8 Nursing homes with higher nurse-staffing hours per resident were less
likely to experience outbreaks across eight US states.9 In 179 UK care homes, lower
infection rates were found in small homes with high staff-to-resident ratios and low
bed occupancy rates.10 Large care homes experienced higher rates of infection in
Wales,11 and in the Lothian region of Scotland excess deaths were concentrated in a
minority of care homes with an outbreak.12 A national breakdown of excess deaths
by care home characteristics is largely lacking from the current literature in England.6
The aim of this study is to use nationally representative administrative data from all
care homes in England to quantify the excess mortality for residents during the first
23-weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak, and to explore associations with care home
characteristics. We then use multivariable logistic regression to estimate the odds of
care homes experiencing a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 death across care
home types. This knowledge might inform a targeted policy response in future
waves.

2. Data & Methods
Institutional context
The English care home market is mostly private and very fragmented, with the type
of service provided, client type(s) covered and bed capacity varying systematically
by provider-type and the local authorities in which they operate.13
There are two main categories of care homes: care homes providing nursing
services and those which do not. Care homes which do provide nursing services
(nursing homes) cater for people who have complex clinical needs that require
regular attention from registered nurses. Care homes which do not offer nursing care
(referred to as residential homes) cater for people who often require personal care
only, with district nurses and physicians called in when necessary.

Further differences in care homes’ organisational characteristics and operational
strategies (for-profit/not-for-profit, independent or belonging to a corporate
chain/groups of providers(branded), small/medium/large) might also influence the
ability of care homes to put in place effective infection, prevention and control
protocols. For example, advanced care planning to ensure patient-centred
management, ability to access Personal Protective Equipment (PPE),SARS-CoV-2
testing capacity constraints, as well as staff-to-resident ratios and policies on staff
and patient movement across facilities.14
Policies adopted in the wider health and care system might have also impacted
COVID-19 infections in English care homes. In mid-March, Hospital Trusts
discharged medically fit patients to care homes to free capacity.15 Mandatory testing
prior to discharge was only brought into effect a month later.16,17 On March 24th the
wider population were ordered not to leave their home except for “essential”
reasons,18 including visiting care homes, later clarified to only in exceptional
circumstances.

Data
Care home-level daily death notification data sent by registered care home operators
in England in the period 1st of January 2017 to 7th August 2020 to the Care Quality
Commission (CQC), the independent regulator of health and adult social care in
England. All providers must send their notifications to CQC without delay.19
The data includes all deaths of care home residents regardless of whether they
occurred in care homes or elsewhere (e.g. in hospital).20 From 10th April 2020,
deaths suspected (based on the statement of care home providers) or confirmed
(tested) to be attributable to COVID-19 (COVID-19 deaths) were also identified.21 All
other deaths are classified as non-COVID-19 deaths.
Death notification data were linked at a care home-level with CQC registers of active
care homes in England, providing data on care home characteristics: setting type
(nursing or residential home), client types (offering services for people aged 65+
and/or people with dementia or offering services to children and adults), ownership
status (whether not-for-profit - charity/NHS/local-authority-run homes - or for-profit),
whether known to CQC to be independent or affiliated to a large provider/brand, and
their registered maximum bed capacity (coded as small (less than 23 beds), medium
(24- 40 beds) and large (41 or more beds)).
Providers enter and leave the market over time. In January 2017, there were 16,481
active care homes, reducing to 15,554 by January 2020. Bed capacity is more
stable, with 460,323 beds in January 2017 and 457,347 in January 2020. For the
calculation of excess deaths, we use data from the 13,630 care homes which
reported at least one death over the study period. 32 (0.17%) care homes were
excluded from the analysis due to inability to match with CQC registers. Of all 19,271
care homes reported to be active at some point between 1st of January 2017 and 7th
August 2020, 3,747 care homes were no longer active in March 2020, meaning

15,524 care home were used when modelling the odds of experiencing any COVID19 fatalities.
To calculate excess deaths, we aggregated daily care home-level deaths to weekly
and local authority level. This aimed to reduce the incidence of zeros and the nonconstant intra-week variation in death counts (Appendix 1,p.1). Therefore, excess
deaths were estimated using aggregated data for 150 local authorities for a period of
188 weeks: 165 weeks (1 January 2017- 3 March 2020) as the pre-COVID-19 period
and 23 weeks (4 March 2020 – 7 August 2020) as the post-COVID-19 period, with
the start of the COVID-19 period defined by the first week in which one COVID-19
death was reported in England.22

Methods
To calculate excess deaths overall and by care home characteristics, we first used
data from the pre-COVID-19 period to estimate expected death trends.23 After
comparing predictive accuracy with more complex models structures (Appendix
2,p.3), a Poisson regression model (standard log link) was selected, with covariates
including a quartic polynomial of week-of-the-year (to account for seasonality) and
local authority fixed effects (to account for determinants of deaths that differ across
local authorities but do not change over time). Predicted weekly deaths for each local
authority were used as the estimated counterfactual in the COVID-19 period (i.e. the
deaths that would have occurred in the absence of the pandemic). National excess
deaths were computed as the sum of the difference between observed and
counterfactual deaths over all local authority-weeks. Excess deaths per hundred bed
capacity (excess deaths per bed) were also reported. 95% confidence intervals were
constructed by bootstrapping with local authority resampling (50 replications). We
also report observed weekly deaths flagged as confirmed or suspected COVID-19
fatalities to show the proportion of excess deaths directly attributed to COVID.
The timing and pattern of excess deaths were likely to vary considerably according
to whether a care home has experienced an outbreak or not. As nationwide care
home-level data on COVID-19 outbreaks are collated but not publicly available,24 we
classified care homes according to whether a confirmed/suspected COVID-19 death
had been reported in the 23-week COVID-19 period. We used multivariable logistic
regression with local-authority fixed effects (controlling for all time-invariant
determinants of disease spread at the area level) to estimate unadjusted and
adjusted odds of reporting any COVID-19 fatalities on covariates.
All analyses were performed in StataMP v14·2.

3. Results
Descriptive statistics
Table 1 summarises the characteristics of all care homes in England active in March
2020. The minority (4,428, 28.5%) provided nursing services. However, on average
nursing homes had more beds than residential homes (50.6 beds versus 20.9) since
they are larger (60.2% versus 12.9% with 41+ beds). This explains the more
comparable supply of total beds in nursing (223,917) and residential care homes
(231,677).
Almost all (93.4%) nursing homes in England provided services to older people
and/or people with dementia, as well as the majority (63.1%) of residential homes.
Over a third (37.7%) of care homes were affiliated to a larger branded
provider/chain. The proportion of branded care homes was higher (45.8%) for
nursing care homes than for residential homes (34.5%). 90.5% of nursing homes
were for-profit, with slightly less (83.3%) residential homes.
Overall, approximately 6 in 10 care homes experienced at least one death in the
COVID-19 period, with a larger share of nursing homes (89%) reporting fatalities
than residential homes (47.9%). 5,641 care homes were active at some point in the
study period but did not report fatalities. These were mainly small residential homes,
with an average bed capacity of 9.21 (95% CI: 8.95 to 9.49). 27.4% of care homes
reported COVID-19 confirmed/suspected fatalities, most in nursing (54.2%) rather
than residential homes (16.7%).

[Table 1 here]

Observed, Expected and Excess deaths
Prior to the COVID-19 period, predicted deaths tracked observed deaths relatively
closely (Appendix 3, p.9). During the COVID-19 period, observed deaths were
considerably higher than predicted from historical trends (Figure 1). Most excess
deaths occurred during the 10 weeks between 25th March and 2nd June. At the end
of the study period, excess deaths were lower than predicted, especially in nursing
homes. Overall, 64.7% of calculated excess deaths (95% CI: 56.4% to 76.0%) were
reported to be attributable to confirmed/suspected COVID-19, with this proportion
increasing over time.

There were 29,542 (95% CI: 25,176 to 33,908) excess deaths in all care homes over
the COVID-19 period (Table 2), equivalent to excess deaths per bed of 6.3% (95%
CI: 5.4% to 7.2%). Robustness checks (Appendix 2,p.3) showed consistent excess
death estimates across different modelling approaches (range: 29,542 to 29,711).
Excess deaths were higher in nursing (18,891, 95% CI: 15,956 to 21,826) compared
to residential homes (10,651, 95% CI: 8,914 to 12,388), with almost double excess
deaths per bed (8.4% versus 4.6%).
Excess deaths were significantly higher in facilities that provided services to older
people and people with dementia, mainly for nursing homes, with excess deaths per
bed of 8.6% (95% CI: 7.3% to 9.9%).
For-profit and not-for-profit nursing homes had comparable excess deaths per bed,
but the rate was nearly double in not-for-profit residential homes (7.7% versus
4.1%).
Branded homes experienced higher excess deaths per bed than independent care
homes (7.2% versus 5.8%). This difference largely occurred among residential
homes (5.6% versus 4%).
Larger care homes also had higher excess deaths per bed (8.6% versus 2.2% in
small homes).
The starkest difference in excess deaths was between care homes that experienced
and did not experience at least one suspected/confirmed COVID-19 death, with the
former responsible for almost all excess deaths (29,429, 95% CI: 25,047 to 33,810).
For graphical inspection see Appendix 4,p.12. For homes experiencing COVID-19
attributable fatalities, excess deaths per bed were comparable across settings
(13.8% nursing; 13.0% residential). Estimated excess deaths for nursing homes not
reporting COVID-19 deaths were negative (-831, 95% CI: -1,291 to -371),
corresponding to an estimated excess deaths per bed of -1% (95% CI: -1.6% to 0.5%). On the other hand, there were 943 excess deaths (95% CI: 503 to 1,383) in
residential homes not reporting COVID-19 deaths, corresponding to an excess
deaths per bed of 0.6% (95% CI: 0.3% to 0.9%).

[Table 2 here]

Care home characteristics associated with odds of one COVID-19 death
After adjusting for other care home characteristics, nursing homes had a statistically
significant higher odds of experiencing COVID-19 confirmed/suspected deaths than
residential homes (OR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.6 to 2.0) (Table 3). Care homes offering
services to older people and/or people with dementia were particularly exposed (OR:
5.5, 95% CI: 4.4 to 6.8). Branded care homes experienced significantly higher odds
of one COVID-19-related death compared to independent homes (OR: 1.2, 95% CI:

1.1 to 1.3), although not-for-Profit and for-profit homes experienced roughly equal
odds of one COVID-19 death (overall OR: 1.0, 95% CI: 0.8 to 1.1). Compared to
small care homes, medium-sized facilities experienced higher odds of COVID-19related deaths (OR: 5.2, 95% CI: 4.5 to 6.0), with large-sized homes experienced
even greater odds (OR: 13.3, 95% CI: 11.5 to 15.4). Results were robust to
controlling for deprivation and urbanicity of the care home location, and to restricting
the sample to care homes providing services to older people/with dementia
(Appendix 5, p.14).

4. Discussion
4.1. Principal Findings
Using provider-level administrative data on all care homes in England, we estimated
that there were over 29,500 excess deaths of care home residents during the first
23-weeks of COVID-19, equivalent to 6.5% of all care home beds. Almost 65% of the
excess deaths were reported to be directly attributable (confirmed/suspected) to
COVID-19. Our analysis shows that almost all excess deaths were recorded in the
quarter of care homes which reported COVID-19 fatalities. This highlights that: (i)
non-COVID-19 attributed excess deaths were likely to be directly due to COVID-19;
and/or (ii) any indirect negative effects of COVID-19 and enacted policies on
mortality were predominantly constrained to those homes experiencing an outbreak.
Non-COVID-19 attributed deaths being reported mainly during the early stages of the
pandemic, when CQC recording of COVID-19 death was missing (before 10th April),
guidance focused on a narrower set of symptoms and there was a shortage of
testing, providing support for the former hypothesis.
Excess deaths were mainly concentrated among large and branded homes that
provide services to older people and people with dementia. Adjusted care home level
analysis confirmed these findings.

4.2. Strengths & Limitations
To our knowledge, this is the first independent analysis that uses national
administrative records from all care homes in England to estimate the impact of
COVID-19. We find comparable total deaths to official estimates,5 adding
stratifications of excess deaths by key care home characteristics and multivariable
analysis to add a more nuanced understanding of these deaths. Local-authority fixed
effects were used to account for time-invariant measured and unmeasured
determinants and confounders that differ across local authority.

Our study also has limitations. Firstly, we can observe the counts of COVID-19
attributed fatalities across care homes but not whether non-fatal COVID-19 cases
occurred. This case data is not available, though serological and whole genome
sequencing studies give insights to this.24 The attribution of COVID-19-related
deaths is based on statements from providers to the CQC starting from 10th April
2020 and not always testing-confirmed or reflected in the death certificate. COVID19 attributable deaths occurred before the 10th April would have been miscoded. The
reported lower rates of testing could lead to some relevant deaths not having
COVID-19 listed as a contributory factor, leading to apparently higher non-COVID-19
excess deaths.5,10,21
No data was available on occupancy rates at care home level. We instead used
maximum bed capacity as reported in March 2020, assuming full occupancy. In the
UK, occupancy rates were estimated to be on average 90% in nursing homes and
91% in residential homes.13 It is very likely that occupancy rates declined during the
COVID-19 period. However, assuming an arbitrary lower occupancy would increase
excess mortality rates only proportionally, unless further breakdowns by time and
care home types became available.
Measures of staffing and working conditions, residents’ case mix and their sociodemographic status, and individual care home shortages of equipment would have
been relevant for this analysis but there is no national care-home level data
available. Our analysis is instead based on providers’ characteristics as reported to
CQC.
We did not account for exposure and incidence of COVID-19 in the local area where
each care home is located, or local policy responses to the pandemic, which
changed over time. Wider community testing was negligible in the early parts of our
analysis period,25 and likely differed by local authority capacity which would bias
results if included. Good quality data on local policy responses was also unavailable.
Finally, as the number of deaths in the absence of the outbreak cannot be observed
but only predicted, there is the potential that market dynamics and prediction errors
could influence excess deaths estimates. However, we estimated small prediction
errors in the pre-COVID-19 period relative to the size of excess deaths in the COVID
period. Excess death estimates were also robust to different modelling approaches.

4.3. Study in context
By comparing observed deaths against averages over historical 5-year period, the
ONS estimated 25,876 excess deaths in English care homes up to August 8th.5 Our
estimates exceed this slightly. In addition to differences in methods, this is likely due
to our data including deaths of care home residents occurring outside of a care home
setting (e.g. in hospital).
Consistent with previous studies, we find that excess deaths occur overwhelmingly in
the minority of care homes that experience COVID-19 fatalities.12 This might suggest

higher proportions of COVID-19-related excess deaths than reported,26 and that
some death are potentially avoidable if initial care home outbreaks had been
prevented.
However, our results suggest that other care homes characteristics, relating to type
of residents, staffing, ownership and size, are also important.
Care homes providing services to older people/with dementia suffered most deaths.
This is unsurprising given the increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 (difficulties
complying with physical distancing, masking and hand hygiene) and increased risk of
morbidity/mortality (comorbid illnesses), frailty and age. However, for care homes
serving this group, there were smaller odds of COVID-19-related deaths in nursing
compared with residential care homes. This might suggest a protective effect of the
presence of staff with nursing backgrounds and infection, prevention and control
(IPC) training, as found in other settings.9
Overall, though, nursing homes had the most excess deaths and odds of COVID-19
confirmed/suspected deaths. This is likely due to these homes containing residents
at high risk of contracting and dying of SARS-CoV-2, increased frailty and higher
prevalence of co-morbidities, and therefore a greater likelihood of being in contact
with other healthcare settings and practitioners.27
In line with the existing literature, we found that large care homes are more likely to
experience negative outcomes.10-12 A likely contributor is that larger homes have a
higher footfall altogether, of staff, healthcare workers, residents flowing in and out of
hospitals, and visitors in non-pandemic times. This increases their chances of
exposure to an infected individual, particularly in the absence of rigorous testing.
Furthermore, it might be easier to ensure patient-centred management protocols in
small care homes where policies around staff and patients contacts are set for
smaller scales.28
We find no significant differences between for-profit and non-for-profit providers,
although for-profit providers experienced the most excess deaths because they
account for the majority of the market. A Canadian study showed for-profit status
was not associated with the odds of an outbreak, although it was associated with the
extent of an outbreak (number of cases and deaths).8 However, we find that branded
care homes had greater odds of COVID-19 confirmed/suspected deaths and rates of
excess deaths. Branded homes could have policies around staff and patient
movement across facilities that could aid the spread of infection.7

4.4. Policy implications & future research
Specialist initiatives are needed for patients/staff/visitors to minimise the risk of initial
infection in care homes. What prevention policies are optimal (e.g. PCR testing, staff
cohorting, visitor restrictions, hospital discharge policies, limiting visiting
professionals, tracing staff etc.)29 requires further research and dialog with operators
and public health experts. Their efficacy depends upon the care home setting in
which they are implemented and the behavioural responses of residents and staff.

Critically, any benefits from such policies would need to be weighed against costs
and potential adverse outcomes, such as reduced quality-of-life or psychological
well-being.29,30
There is an urgent need for further research to explore the mechanisms
hypothesized above in more detail. Evaluations of alternative interventions are
required. However, our results suggest that until this is possible, prioritising existing
resources, such as testing and PPE equipment, to prevent initial infections in care
homes is key to preventing large excess mortality.
