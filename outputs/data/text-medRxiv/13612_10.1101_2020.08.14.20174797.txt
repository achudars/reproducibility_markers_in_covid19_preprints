Abstract
Purpose: This study was carried out to describe settings of and regional differences in the
occurrence of COVID-19 among nursing staff, analysing COVID-19 symptoms, testing and
diagnosis procedures.
Design: We used an online survey to conduct this cross-sectional study among nursing staff
in different settings. Data collection was carried out between 12 May and 13 July 2020.
Methods: The survey included questions that allowed us to collect demographic data (e.g.
age), professional qualifications (e.g. nurse, nurse aid) and data regarding the federal states
and settings in which the participants worked. In additon, we asked the participants to
describe their COVID-19 symptoms, if any were experienced, and the result of COVID-19
testing that they underwent. We used descriptive statistics as well as bivariate analysis
methods to calculate differences.
Findings: More than 80% of the nursing staff (N = 2600) were women, nearly half of these
staff members worked in the province of Styria and about three-quarters worked in hospitals.
In general, nearly every sixth nurse reported experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. We found

statistically significant differences between the settings and the federal provinces with regard
to the COVID-19 symptoms reported, but not the test results. The highest porportion of
nurses who experienced symptoms worked in lower Austria and in the primary care sector. In
total, 1.6% of the participating nurses were tested for COVID-19, as well as about 1% of the
nurses who worked in the nursing homes. The highest number of tests were carried out in
Vienna followed by the province of Burgenland. In total, all of the nurses who underwent
testing were diagnosed with COVID-19.
Conclusions: Only 1% of the nurses who worked in nursing homes were tested. This group
of nurses takes care of the most vulnerable and high-risk group in Austrian society.
Therefore, the nursing home staff should have the possibility to be tested even though they
did not experience/report any symptoms. The highest prorportion of nurses who experienced
symptoms worked in the primary care sector. In the future during a pandemic, health care
staff should be comprehensively tested in all settings.
Clinical Relevance: Providing insights into COVID-19 symptoms experienced by nursing
staff workforce and testing for COVID-19 can help us address these aspects in future
pandemics more efficiently. In addition, these insights can help to shift the perspectives from
critical and acute settings to other settings, e.g. nursing homes. This is an important change in
perspectives, as these nurses have worked with the most vulnerable and high-risk group
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ensuring the safety of nursing home residents and
providing, high-quality nursing care and interventions can reduce hospital admission rates,
decrease health care costs during such pandemics and might even reduce secondary morbidity
and mortality.

Running head: Nursing staff during Covid-19

Introduction
On 13 August 2020 the World Health Organization reported more than 20 million confirmed
cases of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) worldwide, including more than 510,000
deaths (WHO, 2020). These numbers reflect the devasting pressure on and challenges in the
health care systems worldwide.
International databases are being updated daily in order to measure the incidence of the
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as well as track the number
of persons diagnosed with COVID-19 over time. These databases include the: (1) the WHO
Coronavirus Disease Dashboard (WHO, 2020), (2) U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020a), (3) EU Open Data
Portal of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (European Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control, 2020), or even national dashboards such as (4) the Official
COVID-19 Dashboard for Austria (Federal Ministry of Social Affairs, 2020) or the COVID19 Dashboard maintained by the Robert Koch Institut in Germany (Robert Koch Institute,
2020). However, all of these databases are population-based databases and do not place a
focus on high-risk groups such as health care workers. With regard to COVID-19, health
care workers are recognised as a specific high-risk group (U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, 2020b).
Nurses and midwives make up the largest group (i.e. about 50%) of all health care workers,
and(WHO, 2006). Especially nurses have been recognised as key players in crisis and postcrisis situations (WHO, 2016), such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
In recent months, hundreds of papers have been published internationally on the topic of
COVID-19. Many of the studies describe vaccine development efforts, specific treatment
interventions (Ahmed, Quadeer, & McKay, 2020; Batlle, Wysocki, & Satchell, 2020; Garcia

Filho, 2020; Li et al., 2020; Liu, Zheng, & Wang, 2020), or the pathophysiology of the
underlying virus (Forster, Forster, Renfrew, & Forster, 2020; Gildenhuys, 2020; He, Tao,
Yan, Huang, & Xiao, 2020; Jaimes, André, Chappie, Millet, & Whittaker, 2020; Kiyotani,
Toyoshima, Nemoto, & Nakamura, 2020; Lan et al., 2020; Lau et al., 2020).
Some of the papers place a focus on epidemiology (Corbett et al., 2020) or lessons learned
during COVID-19 (Albalate et al., 2020; D'Adamo, Yoshikawa, & Ouslander, 2020; Kim et
al., 2020; Sacco, Foucault, Briere, & Annweiler, 2020). Others have been carried out to
investigate how COVID-19 has affected patients (Lin, Lu, Cao, & Li, 2020; Mokrzycki &
Coco, 2020; Nowak et al., 2020), nursing home residents (Kimball et al., 2020), or older
persons in the community (Nikolich-Zugich et al., 2020).
We conducted a systematic literature review of these papers and found only a few studies that
specifically addressed nursing staff and COVID-19 (Bird, Badhwar, Fallon, Kwok, & Tang,
2020; Guery et al., 2020; Halcomb et al.; Millar, 2020; Mo et al., 2020; Ning et al., 2020;
Yifan et al., 2020; H.-j. Zhang et al., 2020; Y.-P. Zhang et al., 2020). Some of these papers
described the consequences of COVID-19 in relation to nursing staff (Mo et al., 2020; Ning
et al., 2020; H.-j. Zhang et al., 2020; Y.-P. Zhang et al., 2020). One study was carried out on
nurses as COVID-19 patients (Millar, 2020); one study, on a symptom cluster of ICU nurses
who treated COVID-19-positive pneumonia patients (Yifan et al., 2020); and one study, on
SARS-CoV-2 infection rates among respiratory staff nurses (Bird et al., 2020). In another
recent study, researchers investigated the experiences of nurses who worked in the Australian
primary health care sector during the COVID-19 pandemic (Halcomb et al.).
However, none of the above-mentioned publications provided detailed insights into the
nursing staff’s COVID-19 symptoms, testing procedures/results, or diagnoses. In addition,
based on the results of the literature review, no study has been thus far carried out to

investigate the effects of settings and regional differences on reported symptoms and testing.
However, such a study could provide researchers with important, comprehensive insights into
COVID-19 infection rates in nursing staff. Furthermore, these study findings could indicate
the settings and regions in which testing should start earlier if another pandemicoccurs.
Hence, we designed and carried out the current study to investigate settings and specific
regional differences with regard to COVID-19 symptoms, testing and diagnoses among
nursing staff.
Methods
Design, settings and sample
This study was conducted as a cross-sectional study, using an online questionaire. In order to
reach our target sample, we applied the snowball sampling strategy and used social media.
We developed a questionaire that was subsequently distributed to nursing staff throughout
Austria, independent of their qualifications (e.g. nurse, nurse aid) and work settings (e.g.
hospital, nursing homes). The main target group included nurses who were working at the
bedside during the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria.
Data collection instrument and analysis
We collected data from 12 May to 13 July 2020. For this study, we collected the following
data: (1) demographics (e.g. age, gender) (2) region, (3) setting, (4) professional qualification
(e.g. nurse, nurse aid), (5) job experience in years, (6) symptoms of COVID-19 experienced
(Yes/No) and (7) if the participants had been tested positive for COVID-19 (Yes, I was tested
positive for COVID-19/No, I was tested negative for COVID-19/ No, I have not been tested
for COVID-19 at all).
The main variables in this study were the region, setting and if the nurses had been tested,
including the results. All of these variables were categorical variables for which we

calculated descriptive statistics in percentages. We also conducted a bivariate analysis using
the Χ2 test and Cramér's V as the effect size. A p-value of < .05 indicates a statistically
significant result in this study.
Ethics
On the first page of the online questionnaire, we provide the participants with information
about the aim of the study, contact persons as well as about data security. All participants
then had to sign a written informed consent for, in compliance with the General Data
Protection Regulation of the European Union, in order to participate and continue to the
questionnaire. All data were collected anonymously. An ethical approval was granted by the
responsible ethical committee.
Findings
In total, 3497 nursing staff members participates in the study, resulting in a large sample of
questionnaires filled out online. Of this number, 892 questionnaires (25.5%) were
incomplete: 56 of the invited persons chose not to participate; 567 participated, but stopped
did not complete the questionnaire; and 269 only read the welcome page of the questionnaire.
In addition, we had to exclude data from five participants, as they were 65 years or older,
which is the retirement age in Austria. As a result, we were able to include data from 2600
persons in this analysis. Table 1 depicts the sample characteristics.

as well as the federal provinces (V = .060, p = .309), with regard to COVID-19 testing. The
federal provinces where the most tests for nursing staff were conducted were Vienna (nearly
3%) followed by Burgenland. All of the tested nurses (n = 41), independent of the federal
province or setting in which they worked, were diagnosed with COVID-19.
Discussion
In this study, we investigated the effect of settings and regional differences on the reporting
of COVID-19 symptoms, testing and diagnosis by nursing staff.
In general, nearly every sixth participating nurse (N = 2600) reported experiencing COVID19 symptoms. We found statistically significant differences between the settings and the
federal provinces with regard to the COVID-19 symptoms experienced. The highest
prorportion of nurses who experienced symptoms worked in lower Austria, followed by
Upper Austria and Carinthia. Nearly 10% of nursing home staff and about 16% of staff
working in the hospitals reported experiencing COVID-19 symptoms.
We identified one study in which the researchers focused on symptoms in COVID-19positive health care workers (Bird et al., 2020). The authors described that most of the
COVID-19-positive staff experienced at least one systemic symptom (i.e. any combination of
the following: fever, headache, myalgia, or fatigue; n = 37, 78.7%) and at least one
respiratory symptom (i.e. any combination of the following: cough, sore throat, shortness of
breath, or chest tightness/pain, n = 41, 87.2%). In the health care workers who received a
negative PCR test result, 59.4% (n = 95) reported at least one systemic symptom, and 71.9%
(n = 115) reported at least one respiratory symptom. The differences between this study’s
results and our results could be explained by the fact that we included not only nursing staff
that had been tested. In Austria, the Ministry for Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer
Protection issued instructions for health care workers, specifically instructing them to

perform personal observations and self-assessment of their symptoms. If they experienced a
cough or fever, they were requested to call an established ‘health advice hotline’ number
(1450) to receive more information. The person contacted via this number would then make
the decision regarding whether someone would be tested or not.
Some of our results were surprising; we did not expect the highest prorportion of nurses who
experienced symptoms to have worked in lower Austria, followed by Upper Austria and
Carinthia. These results were surprising, because the first regions to report a high prevalence
of COVID-19 were Tyrol (Ischgl, Kappl, See, Galtür und St. Anton am Arlberg) and
Salzburg (Pongau) (Nagl, 26. March 2020). However, these findings might be explained by
the fact that we asked the nursing staff retrospectively; at the time of our data collection, the
provinces of Lower and Upper Austria were reporting relatively high numbers of COVID-19affected persons.
Although we could not identify any statistically significant difference between the federal
provinces or settings with regard to COVID-19 testing, we believe that it is of great
importance to point out that the federal provinces with the highest numbers of tests were
Vienna followed by Burgenland. In general, from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic
in Austria up until 3 August, 910,437 persons were tested. Of this number, 25% were from
Vienna, 17.7% were from Tyrol and 17.4% were from Lower Austria (Federal Ministry of
Social Affairs, 2020). These data contrast with our results. This might be explained by the
fact that we only asked nurses if they had been tested, and the data for the above-mentioned
tests includes all tests conducted in Austria during this period. However, we find this contrast
surprising, as the federal province of Burgenland had very low rates of COVID-19-affected
persons as compared to the other federal provinces, such as Tyrol. One explanation for these
findings might be the short distance between Vienna and Burgenland, i.e. the testing teams
from Vienna might also have conducted tests in Burgenland.

In total, all of the tested nurses (n = 41), regardless of their settings or the federal province,
were diagnosed with COVID-19. In the study of Bird et al. (2020), 63 nurses participated in
the study and 34.9% of these tested positive (Bird et al., 2020). Two other studies reported a
similar percentage of COVID-19-positive health care workers. In these studies, 17% (Chen et
al., 2020) and 29.1% (Tang et al., 2020) of the nurses tested positive for COVID-19. The
difference between the results reported in these studies and our results might be explained by
the relatively small number of nurses tested in general.
However, in our study, we showed that all the nurses tested were diagnosed with COVID-19.
This had two major consequences. First, if more nurses had been tested, we could assume that
Austria would have a higher COVID-19 incidence. Second, considering that many persons
are asymptomatic, and nurses who do not experience symptoms are not tested, these nurses
might become “superspreaders”. This aspect should be carefully considered now when
normal life is starting again.
Limitations
Every study has strengths and limitations. The first limitation of our study is that our sample
is not representative for the Austrian health care setting. As an example, according to data
collected in 2017 (Federal Ministry of Labor, 2019), 53% percent of all nurses were
employed at hospitals, 33% in nursing homes and 14% in home care settings. In our study,
nearly three-quarters of the nurses who participated worked in a hospital setting, only 17%
worked in nursing homes and 2.7% worked in the home care setting. Another limitation of
this study might be that we asked the nurses retrospectively regarding their experiences with
COVID-19. The COVID -19 pandemic began in Austria at the beginning of March, with a
lockdown order issued on 16 March 2020. When we started the survey (May 12), shopping
centers, shops, restaurants, cafes, bars and nursing homes had already opened again. This

retrospective view might have introduced a bias. However, most of the participants
completed the questionnaire within the first two weeks after the online platform was opened.
Conclusions
In general, only 1.1% nurses in nursing homes were tested for COVID-19. Nurses who are
taking care of the most vulnerable and high-risk group of patients should be given the
possibility to be tested more frequently for COVID-19, even if they do not experience any
symptoms. This aspect is of particular importance, as nurses are likely to spend more time
with the patients/residents than any other health care professional and have been recognised
as key players in the COVID-19 crisis. The highest prorportion of nurses who experienced
symptoms were working in Lower Austria at the time of the survey, and most of the tests
were performed in a hospital setting. In the future, testing in all settings is highly
recommended in a pandemic. We could not identify any statistically significant difference
between the federal provinces or the settings with regard to the COVID-19 testing. However,
most of the tests were made in Vienna followed by Burgenland, even though Tyrol initially
had the highest numbers of affected persons. In the future, testing performed in a pandemic
should be based on the rates of suspected and affected cases, starting with the primary care
sector.
