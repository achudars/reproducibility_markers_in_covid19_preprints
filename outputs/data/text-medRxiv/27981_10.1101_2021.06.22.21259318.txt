Abstract
Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectivity
is mediated by the androgen-promoted protease, transmembrane protease, serine 2
(TMPRSS2). Previously, we have shown that treatment with proxalutamide, a nonsteroidal androgen receptor antagonist, accelerates viral clearance and clinical remission in
outpatients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) compared to placebo. The effects
in hospitalized COVID-19 patients were unknown.
Methods: Men and women hospitalized but not requiring mechanical ventilation were
randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive 300 mg of proxalutamide per day or placebo for 14 days.
The study was conducted at eight sites in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. The primary
outcome measure was the clinical status (8-point ordinal scale) at 14-days postrandomization. The primary efficacy endpoint was the 14-day recovery ratio (alive
hospital discharge [scores 1, 2]).
Findings: A total of 645 patients were randomized (317 received proxalutamide, 328
placebo) and underwent intention-to-treat analysis. The 14-day median ordinal scale score
in the proxalutamide group was 1 (interquartile range [IQR]=1–2) versus 7 (IQR=2–8) for
placebo, P<0.001. The 14-day recovery rate was 81.4% for proxalutamide and 35.7% for
placebo (recovery ratio, 2.28; 95% CI 1.95–2.66 [P<0.001]). The 28-day all-cause
mortality rate was 11.0% for proxalutamide versus 49.4% for placebo (hazard ratio, 0.16;
95% CI 0.11–0.24). The median post-randomization time to recovery was 5 days (IQR=3–
8) for proxalutamide versus 10 days (IQR=6–15) for placebo.
Interpretation: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients not requiring mechanical ventilation
receiving proxalutamide had a 128% higher recovery rate than those treated with placebo.
All-cause mortality was reduced by 77.7% over 28 days. (ClinicalTrials.gov number,
NCT04728802).

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resulting
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has claimed 2.6 million lives globally since it first
emerged in December of 2019.1 SARS-CoV-2 infects type II pneumocytes in the human
lung and endothelial cells by anchoring to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
receptors. Prior to binding to ACE2, spike proteins on the viral surface undergo structural
modification via endogenous transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2).2 Because of
this modification, Hoffman, et al. proposed that inhibitors of TMPRSS2 would limit SARSCoV-2 infection.2 The TMPRSS2 promoter includes a 15 base pair androgen response
element.3 This led our group to hypothesize that antiandrogen drugs would be good
candidates for limiting SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells.4 While the mechanism of action of
antiandrogens against SARS-CoV-2 is not fully elucidated, pre-clinical studies have shown
that nonsteroidal antiandrogens down regulate TMPRSS25 and inhibit viral replication in
human cell culture.6,7
Proxalutamide is a second-generation nonsteroidal androgen receptor antagonist
that is more potent than other antiandrogen compounds such as enzalutamide or
bicalutamide.8 These compounds competitively inhibit androgen binding, block androgen
receptor nuclear translocation, and prevent their binding to DNA.9 We previously studied
the use of proxalutamide, in SARS-CoV-2 positive men in an outpatient setting. In a
double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, men treated with
proxalutamide (200 mg/day) demonstrated significantly reduced hospitalization rates,
accelerated improvements of COVID-19 symptoms, and accelerated viral clearance.10
Proxalutamide also reduced the duration of COVID-19 in both men and women diagnosed

Here, we evaluated the efficacy of

proxalutamide compared to the usual care in hospitalized men and women with COVID19.

Methods
Trial Design, Setting and Locations
This was a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective, two-arm
trial. The trial was conducted at eight centers in six cities of the state of Amazonas, Brazil
from February 1 to April 15, 2021, including enrollment and follow-up.
Eligibility criteria
Inclusion criteria: Men and women hospitalized due to COVID-19 with a
previously confirmed positive test for SARS-CoV-2 within 7 days prior to randomization.
SARS-CoV-2 status was determined by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (rtPCR) testing following the Cobas SARS-CoV-2 rtPCR kit test protocol (Roche,
USA).
Exclusion criteria included mechanical ventilation at the time of randomization, a
history of congestive heart failure class III or IV (New York Heart Association),
immunosuppression, alanine transferase (ALT) above five times ULN (> 250 U/L),
creatinine above 2.5 mg/ml, or a calculated eGFR was below 30 ml/min. Patients currently
using any antiandrogen medications were also excluded. In female patients, those that
were pregnant, breastfeeding, or were planning to become pregnant within 90 days were
also excluded.
Patients were randomized to receive either proxalutamide 300 mg/day plus usual
care or a placebo plus usual care for 14 days in a 1:1 ratio. If patients were discharged
before 14 days, they were instructed to continue treatment. Therapy compliance was
monitored daily.
Procedures

The COVID-19 8-point ordinal scale was used for screening (day 0) as well as daily
clinical assessments of patients on days 1-14 (or inpatient after day 14), as well as day 21,
and day 28 (if outpatient), resulting in a maximum of 17 data points for each patient. The
clinical score is defined as: 8. Death; 7. Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation;
6. Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 5. Hospitalized,
requiring supplemental oxygen; 4. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygenrequiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19 related or otherwise); 3. Hospitalized, not
requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer requires ongoing medical care; 2. Not
hospitalized, limitation on activities; and 1. Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities.12
Participants discharged from the hospital were evaluated by investigators in followup appointments whenever possible, or by daily phone calls. Upon hospital discharge,
patients were instructed to contact the same hospital and the local study team in case of
relapse or new symptoms. Hospital readmissions were actively surveilled in all sites.
Baseline characteristics, previous medical history, and concomitant medications
were recorded for each patient. Proxalutamide 300 mg/day or placebo plus usual care was
given for 14 days, even when COVID-19 remission occurred before this period. Usual care
included medications such as enoxaparin, colchicine, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone,
or antibiotic therapy if necessary.
Before the onset of the trial, a random sequence was created using a web-based
randomization software13 using 4, 6 and 8 block sizes and a list length for 662 treatments.
The randomization sequence and the allocation concealment were performed remotely
from the patient recruiting centers and it was not stratified by site. Pre-packing of tablets
of either active or placebo group was manufactured to appear identical (Kintor

Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Suzhou, China). The procedure is detailed in the Supplementary
Appendix.
The local investigators who were directly involved with patient care, other
healthcare providers, and patients were kept blinded to the group assignments until all
patients completed the 28-day post-randomization period and the data was locked. The
principal investigator was unblinded for data and safety analysis in March 2021. The
interim analysis was conducted on March 10th 2021, when the primary outcome measure
was reported for a total of 590 patients.

Outcomes and Statistical Analysis
The primary outcome measure was the 8-point COVD-19 ordinal scale at postrandomization day 14. The primary efficacy endpoint measure was the overall recovery
ratio, which was calculated from recovery rates in each group. Recovery was defined as
achieving alive hospital discharge (scores 1 and 2). The secondary outcome measures
included recovery rate and all-cause mortality rate (score 8) and respective risk ratios at
post-randomization day 28; all-cause mortality hazard ratio; median hospitalization time;
and median post-randomization time to recover (alive hospital discharge). Subgroup
analysis included sex and baseline scores.
An intention-to-treat protocol was used for data analysis. The Wilcoxon Rank Sum
test was used to assess the differences of the ordinal scale scores at 14 and 28 days. Risk
ratios were calculated to measure the effects of proxalutamide versus placebo on the
recovery and all-cause mortality rates. Additional analysis included the recovery and
mortality risk ratios by gender, baseline COVID-19 ordinal score, and hospital site. To

evaluate the all-cause mortality and recovery over the 28-days post-randomization
observation period, we used Kaplan-Meier’s survivor function for estimates of proportion
surviving and failure function for estimates of alive hospital discharges. Cox proportional
hazards model was used to calculate hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality over 28 days
and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Graphical assessment and Kaplan-Meier versus
predicted survival showed that of the proportional-hazards assumption has not been
violated, Figure S3.
The sample size was calculated to be able to detect a difference of approximately
14% in the overall recovery rate at 14 days (risk ratio of 1.36) with a power of 90% and a
type I error of 5%, over an estimated 39% recovery rate for the placebo group (based on
the protocol for NCT04280705 [scenario 4]), and 3.5% non-compliance/cross over for each
group. Statistical significance was set at P<0.05 and no correction for multiple comparisons
was performed. Stata/SE version 16.1 for Mac (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA)
was used to perform all statistical analysis.

Results
Patients
Between February 1 and March 17, 2021, 697 patients were assessed for eligibility,
including 396 males (56.8%) and 301 females (43.2%). At screening, twelve patients did
not meet the eligibility criteria as they had kidney failure or liver abnormal enzymes (1.7%)
and forty patients declined enrollment (5.7%). Of the 697 patients initially assessed, 645
underwent randomization. Three hundred seventeen patients were randomized to receive
proxalutamide in addition to usual care, including 184 males (58.0%) and 133 females
(42.0%). Three hundred twenty-eight were assigned to receive placebo in addition to usual
care, including 182 males (55.5%) and 146 females (44.5%). After randomization, 29 of
the 317 (9.1%) patients receiving proxalutamide and 36 of the 328 (10.9%) receiving
placebo did not complete the trial protocol, the reasons are described in Figure 1.
The baseline characteristics of the study populations are described in Table 1. The
median age was 50 years (interquartile range [IQR], 41 to 62) and 49 years (IQR, 38 to 61)
for the proxalutamide and placebo groups, respectively. Patients with a body mass index
(BMI) above 30kg/m2, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) were equally distributed between study arms. No
comorbidities, one comorbidity, and two or more comorbidities were present in 69.4%,
17.3%, and 13.3% of participants, respectively, and were equally distributed between study
arms. Median time from hospitalization to randomization was 2 days (IQR 1 to 4.2) for
placebo and 2 days (IQR 1 to 4) for proxalutamide.
The ordinal scale scores at baseline were 6, 5, and 4 in 66.5%, 30.4%, and 2.8% of
the population, respectively. The distribution of ordinal scale score was similar between

proxalutamide and placebo arms. Except for colchicine, all concomitant medications were
used at similar proportions between the groups. Remdesivir was not a treatment option
(emergency use authorization dated March 12, 2021 in Brazil).14 Compliance with the 14day treatment was 91% and 89% for the proxalutamide and placebo arms, respectively. Of
note, since the study was conducted in Brazil, the population is ethnically mixed and the
majority of patients did not identify themselves as Caucasian, black, or Asian.

Primary Outcome
At the 14-day timepoint, a lower score distribution was observed for the
proxalutamide group than in the placebo group, Figure 2A. The median score in the
proxalutamide group was 1 (IQR 1 to 2) versus 7 (IQR 2 to 8) for placebo (P<0.001), Table
2. The overall 14-day recovery rate for placebo of 35.7% (95% CI 30.7 to 40.1) was lower
than for proxalutamide (81.4%; 95% CI 76.7 to 85.3), P<0.001. The 14-day recovery ratio
was 2.28 (95% CI 1.95 to 2.66 [P<0.001]), which indicates patients who took
proxalutamide had a 128% higher recovery rate than those treated with placebo (95% CI
95 to 166%). No interaction effect of the primary outcome and gender was observed, Table
2 and Figure 2B.

Secondary Outcomes
At the 28-day timepoint, a lower score distribution was observed for the
proxalutamide group than in the placebo group, Figure 2A. The median ordinal scale score
was 1 (IQR 1–1) for proxalutamide versus 7 (IQR 2 to 8) for placebo. No difference was
observed between sexes upon stratification for both placebo and proxalutamide at 28 days,

Figure 2B. The overall 28-day recovery ratio was 1.81 (95% CI 1.60 to 2.00), which
indicates that patients who took proxalutamide had an 81% higher recovery rate than those
treated with placebo (95% CI 60 to 100), Table 2.
A high risk of all-cause mortality was observed for placebo (49.4%; 95% CI 44.0
to 54.7) compared to proxalutamide (11.0%; 95% CI 8.0 to 14.9). The number needed to
treat (NNT) to prevent one death from COVID-19 in hospitalized patients over 28 days
was 3 (95% CI 3 to 2). The risk ratio for death was 0.22 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.31), which
indicates that treatment with proxalutamide reduced all-cause mortality rate over 28 days
by 77.7%. Subgroup analysis by gender showed no interaction effects in any of the
secondary outcome measures, Table 2. Other subgroup analyses of the 28-day recovery
ratio and all-cause mortality risk by city of the study site are present in Tables S3 and S4
of the Supplementary Appendix.
Figure 3 depicts the Kaplan-Meier survival curves and alive hospital discharge
within 28 days for both the proxalutamide and placebo treated groups overall. The
difference in the proportion surviving was evident as early as day 3 and increased over the
remaining study period, which includes days after the 14-day therapy period (Figure 3A).
This demonstrates there was no noticeable rebound effect if therapy was completed. The
difference in the proportion of alive hospital discharge was statistically significant at day
2, and increased until day 11, reaching 75%, Figure 3B. Patients in the proxalutamide
group during the study period were 84% (95% CI 89-76%) less likely to die than patients
in the control group (hazard ratio for death 0.16 [95% CI, 0.11 to 0.24]). The median
hospitalization time (days) was lower in the proxalutamide arm (8, IQR 6-13) compared to
the placebo (12, IQR 8-18).

Safety Outcomes
Adverse events observed during the course of the trial are detailed in Table 3.
Adverse events grade 4 or 3 were more commonly observed in the placebo arm (40.9%)
than in the proxalutamide arm (2.2%), P<0.001. Diarrhea was the only adverse event
reported at higher proportions in those receiving proxalutamide (16.1%) versus those
receiving placebo (3.3%), P=0.005. Irritability was reported in four patients treated with
proxalutamide (1.3%) and none in the placebo group. Among males taking proxalutamide,
four reported spontaneous erection (2.2%) versus none in males taking placebo.

Discussion
Here we demonstrate in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
trial that the use of proxalutamide, a second-generation nonsteroidal antiandrogen, reduced
mortality, length of stay, and significantly improved clinical outcomes of hospitalized
COVID-19 patients. These findings are consistent with our reports of the efficacy of
proxalutamide in an outpatient setting,10,15 as well as reports using other antiandrogen
regimens, including dutasteride and finasteride.16,17
Proxalutamide was a benefit to COVID-19 patients who were severely ill. At the
time of the trial, the state of Amazonas experienced a surge in COVID-19 cases resulting
in overcrowding at hospitals. As such, prioritized admission to hospitals resulted in
admission of the most severely affected patients with COVID-19. Additionally, we found
the mortality rate to be exceptionally high (49.4%) in the placebo group. Though the
observed mortality rate may have been influenced by the emergent P.1 strain, the high
mortality rate we observed in the placebo group is not unexpected based on past reports.18,19
The northern Amazonas region of Brazil have reported high mortality rates, ranging from
24-55% amongst hospitalized COVID-19 patients as early as April of 2020, while the
average rates observed in all of Brazil range from 14-38%.18,19
As of March, 2021, the P.1 lineage is responsible for at least 70% of the current
SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced in Brazil, and for at least 90% of the SARS-CoV-2
genomes in the state of Amazonas.20 In a post-hoc analysis, sequencing of viral genomes
from patient samples obtained from the study sites and during the trial dates were found to
be the P.1 lineage in all but one case (Supplementary Appendix, Table S5). P.1 is
considered one of most relevant variants of concern (VOC) worldwide. This variant has

demonstrated enhanced affinity for ACE-2 binding, potentially resulting in higher viral
loads.21 In particular, the E484K substitution, previously demonstrated by our group as
being positively selected in diverse lineages in Brazil,22 can induce immune escape with
consequent reinfection and failure of other therapeutic modalities, such as convalescent
plasma.23 It is encouraging to note, therefore, that proxalutamide was effective in a region
with high P.1 prevalence.
Finding new or repurposed drugs active against VOCs and other SARS-CoV-2
harboring mutations is of paramount importance. Multiple agents have been explored in
clinical trials as treatments for COVID-19. To date, the most promising of these treatments
are remdesivir,24 a viral RNA-polymerase inhibitor, remdesivir plus the Janus kinase (JAK)
inhibitor, baricitinib,25 and dexamethasone,26 a glucocorticoid without mineralocorticoid
effect. Remdesivir has been reported to reduce the median time to recovery of hospitalized
COVID-19 patients to 10 days, down from 15 days observed with placebo.24 The mortality
rate of patients treated with remdesivir was 11.4% at 29 days compared to 15.2% in the
placebo group, though not reaching statistical significance (HR 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52 to
1.03).24 Similarly, the combination of remdesivir and baricitinib trended to a reduction in
28-day mortality from 7.8% to 5.1% (HR 0.65; 95% CI, 0.39 to 1.09).25 It is difficult to
compare results across trials, but we observed the clinical benefits of proxalutamide to be
superior to either of these treatments with greater than 77.7% reduction in 28-day mortality
rate under ITT analysis (HR of 0.16; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.24). Direct comparisons among
therapies are warranted to delineate effective regimen(s). Dexamethasone has also been
demonstrated to benefit the most severe COVID-19 patients; among those patients
requiring mechanical ventilation, dexamethasone was shown to reduce mortality compared

to placebo (29.3% vs. 41.4%; rate ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.81).26 All of the
participants in this trial received corticosteroids, but there was still a survival advantage to
receiving proxalutamide.
Treatment emergent adverse events associated with proxalutamide were limited to
diarrhea. Diarrhea was also reported to be more frequent among the proxalutamide group
in an outpatient trial.11 In contrast, severe adverse events of renal failure and hepatic
damage were associated with placebo, Table 3. We interpret this finding as the natural
progression of COVID-19 in the placebo group, which further supports consideration of
proxalutamide as a therapy for hospitalized patients. While Phase 1 safety data for
proxalutamide supports its use for 28 days in both men and women (Protocol for details),
it has been studied primarily in prostate cancer patients, therefore, long term side effects
should be assessed in future studies. Alternatively, other approved molecules of the same
class may show similar results, such as apalutamide, enzalutamide, darolutamide,
bicalutamide, or flutamide.
Important limitations are present in this study. First, the remote locations of many
of the study sites created operational difficulties that led to an unbalanced distribution of
proxalutamide and placebo amongst sites (details provided in Supplementary Appendix).
Minor differences in effects of proxalutamide between sites may have resulted from factors
such as local infrastructure and age distribution (Figures S5 and S6). However, the
possibility of effect sizes skewing in favor of the proxalutamide group due to its
disproportional concentration in the smaller hospitals is unlikely because a similar size
effect was observed in subgroup analysis of all hospital sites (Tables S3 and S4). Second,
the severity of patients admitted to Amazonas hospitals during the trial did not allow us to

test proxalutamide in many hospitalized patients who did not require supplemental oxygen
(ordinal score 3). However, we have previously shown that proxalutamide reduced
hospitalizations and improved symptom recovery and viral clearance in outpatients with
mild-moderate disease.10 Moreover, the subgroup analysis showed patients with baseline
scores of 3-5 benefited from proxalutamide. Third, more patients used colchicine in the
placebo arm despite randomization.

This most likely reflects additional therapeutic

interventions associated with longer hospitalization in the placebo group. Colchicine is
unlikely, however, to have contributed to increased mortality directly as there is either no
effect,27 with 28-day mortality rate ratio of 1.01 in the RECOVERY platform trial (95%
CI, 0.93 to 1.10)28, or limited benefit in COVID-19.29–31 Forth, remdesivir was not available
to our patients. Despite the lack of a direct acting antiviral, however, patients receiving
proxalutamide had a substantial benefit. Lastly, a dropout rate of approximately 9-11% was
observed in both study arms. The explanation for this participant attrition varied and was
seen in both arms, nevertheless, proxalutamide retained its efficacy in the ITT analysis.
This trial has generated important questions requiring further study. Despite being
an antiandrogen therapy, women treated with proxalutamide responded similarly to
proxalutamide-treated men (Fig 2 and Table 2).

Additionally, the significant

improvement observed in severely-ill patients appeared disproportionate to the proposed
mechanism of reducing viral entry (Table 2, Baseline score 6). These findings suggest
additional mechanism(s) of action beyond androgen antagonism and TMPRSS2
knockdown that will require additional investigation. Because of the logistical difficulties
executing this trial and the high mortality in Brazil during the study period, our findings

must be evaluated in other populations. It is urgent that additional trials examine nonsteroidal antiandrogens in different settings.

Conclusions
Hospitalized COVID-19 patients receiving treatment with proxalutamide had a
128% higher recovery rate than those treated with placebo at day 14. All-cause mortality
was reduced by 77.7% over 28 days. Further studies of proxalutamide and other
antiandrogen therapies in COVID-19 patients in different settings and locations are
urgently needed.

age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical
bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at
least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the
reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone
level assessment, is she considered not of child bearing potential.

Additional Randomization Procedures

Before the onset of the trial, a randomization table was created using a web-based
randomization software (sealedenvelope.com/simple-randomiser/v1/lists) using 4, 6 and 8
block sizes and a list length for 662 treatment packages of identical appearance of either
active or placebo group. A pharmacist sealed and labeled each package with a 3-character
random-generated code. The packages contained a total of 6 blister packs of 7 individually
sealed tablets, which accounted for a total of 42 tablets per treatment. The package
instructions stated: take 3 tablets by mouth once a day for 14 consecutive days. The study
was double-blinded with the identification of the group assignment known by the study
monitor and the pharmacist who labeled the packages, who did not participate in dispensing
the packages. Patients who were discharged before treatment day 14 had the remaining
tablets dispensed as to complete the full 14-day treatment course, and were actively
evaluated for compliance daily until day 14. All centers followed the same protocol.
At the three hospital sites in Manaus, the treatments were dispensed by the hospital
pharmacy at random. Due to logistic difficulties in smaller remote hospitals with limited
resources, and the possibility of unmonitored sharing of identical blister packs between
patients, a procedure was undertaken to ensure non-sharing within the same site: boxes
containing 5-50 treatment packages of the same blinded randomized treatment group were
sealed for delivery to remote sites. Each box was delivered by a blinded research assistant
directly to the research team at each remote site according to the local demand and
enrollment capabilities. A new randomized box was delivered to the remote sites only after
dispensing the previous box. The remote sites were not informed that each box contained
a single arm, and were instructed to follow the protocol and register in the case report forms
the individual package 3-character code dispensed for each patient. This operation
procedure introduced a bias in the distribution of drug and placebo between sites. Table
S1 details the drug and placebo distribution per site and the randomization scheme used.
Figure S1 shows the enrollment over the time of the study. We do not believe the drug and
placebo distribution bias impacted the overall results of the study as more proxalutamide
was dispensed to the remote hospitals with less resources.

Interim Analysis and Public Disclosure, March 10 2021

An interim analysis was planned per protocol at 50% recruitment of the target
sample size. Owing to the surge in cases experienced during the trial, however, patient
recruitment was rapid and exceeded 50% before the 28-day safety assessment.
Additionally, when 50% recruitment goal was achieved (Feb 14) no endpoint data was
available. Accordingly, the interim analysis was performed later, in March.

The

preliminary results were presented to the public on March 10, 2021, in accordance with
Brazilian National Research Ethics Committee guidance (National Health Council
Resolution Number 466, III.2.m). At the time of the interim analysis, the majority of
patients, 99%, had been randomized; only 9 additional patients were randomized after the
event. Figure S1 details the number of patients randomized to study before and after March
10th. It is noteworthy, that only 55 of the 645 patients had yet to complete the 14-day
course of study intervention at the time of the public disclosure. As such, we do not believe
the disclosure impacted recruitment, data collection, or interpretation of results.

Dosage Administration and Compliance Procedures

Proxalutamide 300 mg (3 x 100 mg tablets) or matching placebo was taken orally
once daily with or without food, therapy was initiated soon after randomization. Treatment
compliance was monitored and recorded while the patient was hospitalized. An accurate
and current accounting of the dispensing of the study drug for each subject was maintained
on an ongoing basis by the Investigator or delegated personnel. The number of study drug
tablets dispensed to the subject was recorded on the Investigational Product Accountability
Log. Patients who were discharged before treatment day 14 had the remaining tablets
dispensed as to complete the full 14-day treatment course and were actively evaluated for
compliance daily until day 14. All centers followed the same protocol.

Baseline COVID-19 8-point Ordinal Scale
The protocol was amended before initiation of the trial because of prevailing
disease in the participating hospitals. In the original protocol, the inclusion was limited to
COVID-19 8-point ordinal scale scores 3, 4, and 5, i.e., did not include patients requiring
non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices.
Prior to the start of the trial, Brazil, and particularly the state of Amazonas,
experienced a surge in COVID-19 resulting in an increase in severity of cases. The majority
of hospitalized patients on the days preceding the trial were on high flow oxygen devices
(COVID-19 8-point ordinal scale score 6). As such, the decision was made to include score
6 on the day of the initiation of recruitment. All patients, including COVID-19 8-point
ordinal scale score 6, were randomized in the same 1:1 ratio as indicated in the Protocol.
We did not perform randomization stratified per site as a result of batch delivery of
drugs or placebo (described above). This led to an unbalance between study arms within
hospital sites. In three small hospital centers the randomization strategy had to be modified
due to: 1) logistic difficulties in taking the drugs to these remote hospitals and 2) limited
financial resources. This was done to avoid unblinding and unmonitored sharing of blister
packs among hospitals and patients. We are aware that these changes in the randomization
scheme increased the risk of bias in the randomization procedure. However, in the 3 sites
located in the large urban city of Manaus with higher hospital certification standards, where
randomization could be done as originally planned, a lower mortality rate in both arms was
observed, as well as a lower mortality risk ratio (Table S4).

Figure S3. Graphical assessment of proportional-hazards assumption (hazard ratio
over 28 days post-randomization).
Top: figure displays lines that are parallel, implying that the proportional-hazards
assumption for the therapy groups has not been violated.
Bottom: This is confirmed by Kaplan-Meier versus predicted survival, where the observed
values and predicted values are close together for the therapy groups.
Proportional-hazards assumption on the basis of Schoenfeld residuals revealed a global test
with P value = 0.7986, therefore, we can assume the proportional hazards.

SARS-CoV-2 Lineage Determination

For this post hoc analysis, clinical samples from patients admitted to one of the
participating centers testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in a first RT-qPCR had their
samples submitted to a second RT-qPCR performed by BiomeHub (Florianópolis, Santa
Catarina, Brazil), using charite-berlin protocol. Only samples with quantification cycle
(Cq) below 30 for at least one primer were processed for SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing
by the BiomeHub laboratory.
To perform the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing, total RNAs were prepared as in the
reference protocol (dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.befyjbpw) using SuperScript IV
(Invitrogen) for cDNA synthesis and Platinum Taq High Fidelity (Invitrogen) for specific
viral amplicons. The cDNA obtained were subsequently used for the library preparation
with Nextera Flex (Illumina) and quantified with Picogreen and Collibri Library
Quantification Kit (Invitrogen). The sequencing was performed on MiSeq 150x150 runs
with 500xSARS-CoV-2 coverage (50-100 mil reads/per sample).
The SARS-CoV-2 genome assembly was generated by an in-house pipeline from
BiomeHub (Florianópolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil). The remotion of adapters and read
trimming in 150 nt were performed with fastqtools.py, followed by the reads mapping to
the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome (GenBank accession number NC_045512.2) with
Bowtie v2.4.2 (additional parameters: end-to-end and very-sensitive). The mapping
coverage and sequencing depth were obtained with samtools v1.11 (minimum base quality
per base (Q) ≥ 30). Consensus genome sequences were then generated with bcftools
mpileup (Q ≥ 30; depth (d) ≤ 1,000) combined with bcftools filter (DP>50) and bcftools
consensus v1.11. Finally, the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 virus lineages was
performed by the Pangolin v2.3.8 web server (https://github.com/cov-lineages/pangolin).
