Background: The current pandemic, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2, has claimed over a million lives worldwide in a year, warranting the need for more
research into the wider determinants of COVID-19 outcomes to support evidence-based
policies.
Objective: This study aimed to investigate what factors determined the mortality and length
of hospitalisation in individuals with COVID-19.
Data Source: This is a systematic review with data from four electronic databases: Scopus,
Google Scholar, CINAHL and Web of Science.

Eligibility Criteria: Studies were included in this review if they explored determinants of
COVID-19 mortality or length of hospitalisation, were written in the English Language, and
had available full-text.

Study appraisal and data synthesis: The authors assessed the quality of the included studies
with the Newcastle Ottawa Scale and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
checklist, depending on their study design. Risk of bias in the included studies was assessed
with risk of bias assessment tool for non-randomised studies. A narrative synthesis of the
evidence was carried out. The review methods were informed by the Joana Briggs Institute
guideline for systematic reviews.

Results: The review included 22 studies from nine countries, with participants totalling
239,830. The included studies’ quality was moderate to high. The identified determinants
were categorised into demographic, biological, socioeconomic and lifestyle risk factors,
based on the Dahlgren and Whitehead determinant of health model. Increasing age (ORs
1.04-20.6, 95%CIs 1.01-22.68) was the common demographic determinant of COVID-19
mortality while living with diabetes (ORs 0.50-3.2, 95%CIs -0.2-0.74) was one of the most
common biological determinants of COVID-19 length of hospitalisation.
Review limitation: Meta-analysis was not conducted because of included studies’
heterogeneity.
Conclusion: COVID-19 outcomes are predicted by multiple determinants, with increasing
age and living with diabetes being the most common risk factors. Population-level policies
that prioritise interventions for the elderly population and the people living with diabetes may
help mitigate the outbreak’s impact.

Strength and limitations of this review
•

42
43

This is the first systematic review synthesising the evidence on determinants of
COVID-19 LOS outcome.

•

It is also the first review to provide a comprehensive investigation of contextual

44

determinants of COVID-19 outcomes, based on the determinants of health model;

45

thus, presenting with crucial gaps in the literature on the determinants of COVID-19

46

outcomes that require urgent attention.

50

The review was restricted in conducting meta-analysis due to included studies’
heterogeneity.

•

The review focused on only papers published in the English Language; hence, other
relevant papers written on other languages could have been omitted.

Introduction

57

COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus) is currently among the leading causes of death

58

globally. As of January 9th, 2021, 87,589,206 cases and 1,906, 606 deaths had been recorded

59

globally (1). While its case fatality ratio (CFR) has been relatively low (CFR=2.2%),

60

compared to CFRs of previous coronavirus outbreaks, notably, MERS (CFR=9.5%) and

61

SARS-COV-1 (CFR=34.4%), its aggressive and alarming transmission rate has posed

62

enormous challenges on global health (2). Even the current reported transmission rate of

63

COVID-19 may be lower than the actual transmission rate because a significant proportion of

64

infected persons may remain undetected because they are asymptomatic (3). And regarding

65

its CFR, current predictions even suggest that mortality ratio may increase since the

66

pandemic is still ongoing (4). The infectivity and fatality rates associated with COVID-19,

67

together with the worldwide panic it generates, make the current coronavirus pandemic a

68

significant threat to public health, and its gargantuan impact unlike anything the world has

69

experienced in the last two decades (5).

70
71

Since its inception, COVID-19 has overburdened the whole global health system, from

72

crippling health resources to causing paradigm shifts in health care delivery (6). The testing

73

process, quarantine and isolation associated with the virus has had dire psychological and

74

financial implications on individuals and institutions (7). Furthermore, lockdowns instituted

75

by affected countries to curb the virus’s spread resulted in disrupted formal education,

76

unplanned fiscal costs on emergency reliefs, and decreased productivity, all translating into

77

huge economic costs to governments and organisations (8). The overall COVID-19 burden, in

78

terms of health and fiscal implications, has been consequential in both high-income and low-

79

and middle-income countries, albeit with contextual differences.

80

Regardless of the significant interventions to curb the virus’s spread and subsequently reduce

81

its severest outcome, i.e., mortality and morbidity, the outbreak continue to increase. As of

82

January 9th, 2021, the daily global COVID death was 15,522, the highest daily mortality

83

since the pandemic started, and about 3,000 more deaths since the first peak in daily COVID-

84

19 deaths (initial peak April 17th – 12,511 daily deaths) (1). Also, 823,856 cases were

85

confirmed on January 9th, 2021, representing a 0.93% increase from the previous day’s case

86

count. The rapid rise in the COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide necessitates continuous

87

research on risk factors for COVID-19 outcomes to provide current evidence-based

88

interventions to reduce the outbreak’s drastic impact.

89
90

Several studies on determinants of COVID-19 outcomes were identified in the literature;

91

however, most of them were primary studies investigating risk factors for COVID-19

92

mortality (9, 10, 11). The few secondary studies/systematic reviews found in the literature

93

encompassed only papers from high-income countries (12, 13). Also, there is inadequate

94

coverage on other COVID-19 outcomes, specifically, length of hospital stay (LOS). Till date,

95

no review has explored risk factors/determinants of COVID-19 LOS. Findings from such

96

studies will be essential for help health systems to develop contingency plans for bed

97

occupancy and health resources, especially with the swift increase in the COVID-19 cases.

98

Thus, this study aimed to review factors that determine COVID-19 mortality and LOS in

99

individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 to address the literature dearth and contribute to

100

global efforts at curtailing the pandemic. Understanding the risk factors of COVID-19

101

outcomes based on a comprehensive synthesis of global but rapidly emerging evidence might

102

be useful to implement effective policies to address the disease burden.

Search strategy

105

From 21st to 31st December 2020, Scopus, Google Scholar, CINAHL and Web of Science

106

databases were searched for relevant studies using the search terms: ‘Determinants’

107

‘Predictors’ ‘COVID-19’ ‘SARS-CoV-2’ ‘Mortality’ ‘Length of hospital stay’ ‘Length of

108

hospitalisation’. The search terms were combined with mesh words and Boolean operators to

109

ensure sensitive and targeted search. Full search strategy is shown in supplementary

110

information 1. First screening of the databases results was conducted independently by two of

111

the reviewers (SC and NKA) to ensure their relevance to this study. The tiles and abstract of

112

the identified relevant studies were screened against this review’s eligibility using the

113

following predetermined eligibility criteria: population - individuals diagnosed with COVID-

114

19, exposures – demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, environmental biological/medical

115

factors, outcome – COVID-19 related mortality and LOS, studies that explored determinants

116

of COVID-19 mortality and LOS in participants with COVID-19, studies whose LOS

117

endpoint was discharge or death, and not hospital transfers, studies written and published in

118

the English Language, and with full-text available. No date restriction was applied in any of

119

the databases since most COVID-19 studies are recent. No database filters were also applied.

120

The references of the identified papers were also tracked for papers eligible for this

121

review. Any disagreements relating to studies’ screening was discussed and resolved with the

122

third reviewer (SK) and

123
124

Data extraction

125

Two of the authors (SC and NKA) extracted the relevant data from the included studies using

126

a comprehensive a priori developed set of data extraction questions (Supplementary

127

information 2), informed by the JBI data extraction tools. The questions were categorised

128

under two main themes, i.e., general information (authors name, study settings, study aim,

129

year of publication) and methodology (sample size, sample characteristics, outcomes etc.), to

130

ensure the sensitivity of the questions to the overarching objectives of this review. The data

131

extraction questions were piloted-tested on five selected studies before their final usage. The

132

third author (SP) randomly selected and reviewed 50% of the extracted data from the

133

included studies to ascertain data extraction quality. Finally, all disagreements were resolved

134

by consensus.

135
136

Risk of bias and quality assessment

137

The Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality

138

(AHRQ) appraisal checklist were used to appraise the quality of the included studies. These

139

checklists were based on a systematic review’s recommendation (14). The NOS provides

140

eight items grouped under three main domains: the selection of cohorts, the comparability of

141

cohorts, and outcomes assessment. A star (*) was awarded if a study met an item under the

142

three defined domains. A maximum of one star was given to items within the selection and

143

outcome domain, and a maximum of two stars was given to the item under the comparability

144

domain. Thus, studies with nine stars were rated as high-quality study and those with two

145

stars or less were graded as low quality. Like the NOS, the ARHQ also provides

146

items/checklists (n=11) for assessing the quality of the study’s’ methods and outcomes. A

147

‘yes’, ‘no’ or ‘not applicable (NA)’ was used to indicate whether a study met the AHRQ

148

requirement. The number of ‘yes’ from a study represented the study’s quality. Consequently,

149

studies with eleven ‘yes’, suggesting 11 total scores, were ranked as high quality, whereas

150

those with two or less ‘yes’ were rated as low quality. Also, risk of bias assessment of both

151

the study and outcome level of the included papers was performed with risk of bias

152

assessment tool for non-randomised studies. The quality and risk assessment findings are

153

presented in supplementary information 3.

155

Data synthesis

156

Descriptive data synthesis, informed by the JBI manual for evidence synthesis in systematic

157

reviews was conducted to comprehensively describe the methods, findings, and quality of the

158

included studies (15). The studies’ methods, its operationalisation and the subsequent

159

findings were compared across the papers to identify common determinants of COVID-19

160

mortality and LOS. Also, the range of effect sizes (odds ratios/hazard ratios) of the identified

161

determinants in the studies were synthesised to understand the magnitude of the effect on the

162

study outcomes. This was done by reporting the lowest and highest effect sizes from studies

163

that identified common determinants.

164

165

Patient and public involvement

166

This study reviewed already published and available research. Therefore, no patients or the

167

public were directly involved in this review process. The findings of this review will be

168

shared publicly through scientific publication, social media, and conference presentations.

Overview of included studies

207

The studies spanned nine major countries, of which eight were high-income countries and

208

one upper-middle-income country. Majority of them were from China (n=6) and USA (n=6),

209

followed by Spain (n=2), and England (n=2), and one each from Kuwait, Mexico, France,

210

Italy, Austria, and one multi-continent study- participants from Africa, Europe, Australia,

211

Asia, and Americas (16). They all used the quantitative research approach, with retrospective

212

cohort design as the predominant study design (n=12). Most of them (n=20) accessed only

213

secondary data, retrieved mainly from the patients’ electronic medical records. The remaining

214

two used both secondary and primary data (face to face and telephone interviews) (10, 17).

215

The studies sample size ranged from 58 to 177,133, totaling 239,830 participants. All the

216

studies included both male and female participants; however, the men dominated,

217

representing 51.4% of the studies' entire population. Only 7 studies were age-specific -

218

limited their inclusion to participants

219

persons with confirmed COVID-19 test, either through the reverse transcription-polymerase

220

chain reaction (RT-PCR) or nasopharyngeal swabs. The other two studies included all

221

confirmed, negative, and suspected, and both suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases (18,

222

19) (Table 1). The studies’ quality on the NOS and AHRQ ranged from 6-9, representing

223

moderate to high quality and the common risk of bias across the studies was the inability to

224

control the influence of unmeasured confounders. This confounding bias inherently

225

influenced the studies’ findings and could subsequently affect this review’s finding.

227

Of the COVID-19 outcomes, 19 studies focused on only COVID-19 mortality, 2 solely on

228

COVID-19 LOS and 1 on both COVID-19 mortality and LOS. Mortality was generally

229

described as either in-hospital deaths, i.e., deaths occurring in a hospital or all-cause

230

mortality, i.e., all deaths in COVID-19 patients, regardless of the cause. LOS was also

231

defined commonly as the number of days in hospital admission due to COVID-19. One study

232

described it as normal or prolonged, based on their measured average LOS (<17 days –

233

normal; >17 - prolonged) (20). Consequently, they assessed LOS as a binary outcome. On the

234

determinants of COVID-19 outcomes, identified risk factors were categorised into

235

demographic, lifestyle, socioeconomic and biological/medical determinants, based on the

236

determinants of health model (21). The rationale was to provide contextual analysis and

237

identify common risk factors for COVID-19 outcomes. The biological/medical determinants

238

encompassed as comorbidities, laboratory findings, and participants symptoms. The findings

239

of the studies are synthesised below (Table 2).

253

Age and sex were the common demographic risk factors. Of the 20 studies on age and

254

COVID-19 mortality, 16 identified increasing age as a significant determinant of COVID-19

255

mortality, with effect sizes ranging from 1.04 to 20.6 and 95% CI from 1.01 to 22.68 (9, 10,

256

11, 16, 17, 18, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 35). Also, 8 of the 20 studies on gender/sex

257

and COVID-19 found men to have a higher risk of COVID-19 mortality than women (10, 11,

258

16, 17, 24, 26, 28, 32). On LOS, 2 of the 3 studies assessing LOS found women (AOR=0.19,

259

95%CI=0.05-0.63) (20) and men (β=0.39, 95% CI=0.16-0.62) (35) as determinants of

260

COVID-19 duration of hospitalisation.

261
262

Of biological/medical risk factors, the review identified diabetes (n=6), Chronic kidney/renal

263

disease (CKD) (n=5), hypertension (n=4), C-reactive protein (CRP) (n=4), BMI (n=4),

264

dyspnoea (n=3), COPD (n=3), cancer (n=3), coronary heart disease (n=2), asthma (n=2) and

265

D-dimer (n=2) as determinants of COVID-19 mortality. Of the 10 studies that included CKD

266

in their analysis, 5 found it a significant determinant of COVID-19 mortality (18, 25, 26, 30,

267

35). Additionally, out of the 5 studies that investigated the influence of CRP on COVID-19

268

mortality, 4 showed that elevated CRP in the blood (at least >5mg/L) increases the risk of

269

COVID-19 death (11, 24, 26, 29). Also, people with diabetes were found to have a higher

270

risk of COVID-19 mortality in 6 of the 18 studies on diabetes and COVID-19 mortality (16,

271

17, 18, 26, 30, 32)

272

Like diabetes, hypertension was also identified as a determinant of COVID-19 mortality in 4

273

out of the 16 studies (11, 16, 24, 30). Furthermore, 4 of 11 studies on BMI and COVID-19

274

mortality showed that obesity significantly determines COVID-19 mortality (11, 18, 19, 32).

275

For LOS, fever and diabetes were associated with prolonged LOS (43,35).

277

On lifestyle factors, smoking was the only assessed determinant of COVID-19 outcomes. It

278

was identified as a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality in 2 of the eleven studies that explored

279

it, with effect size ranging from 0.89-10.09, 95%CIs from 0.28-83.40 (23, 32). None of the

280

studies on LOS reported a significant association between smoking and COVID-19 LOS.

281

Finally, the only study on socioeconomic determinants and COVID-19 reported that greater

deprivation determines COVID-19 mortality (HR=1.79, 95%1.68 – 1.91) (32)

Discussion

288

This review aimed to investigate the determinants of COVID-19 outcomes. The review found

289

that the specification and subsequent analysis of most of the determinants differed across the

290

studies. For example, Berenguer et al. (2020) described elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) as

291

CRP>5mg/L, while Carrasco-Sánchez et al. (2020) described it as >60mg/L. Also, whilst

292

Almazeedi et al. (2020) and Sourij et al. (2020) assessed CRP as a continuous variable,

293

Kaeuffer et al. (2020) categorised it into two groups: CRP- 100-199mg/L and CRP≥200mg/L.

294

Like CRP, older age was also specified differently across the studies. Bello-Chavolla et al.

295

(2020) and Li et al. (2020) described it as individuals ≥65 years, Zhang et al. (2020) termed it

296

as persons >65 years while Petrilli et al. (2020) defined it as people ≥75 years. Apart from

297

these variations, the study settings also differed across the papers. These contextual

298

differences, which could include disparities in access to healthcare, crowded living, could

299

have inherently influenced the studies’ findings (36).

300

Despite these heterogeneities, the result of some of the determinants was similar across the

301

studies. For instance, the significant association between age and COVID-19 mortality was

19

302

reported across sixteen out of twenty papers, and four out of five articles examining CRP also

303

showed a significant association between CRP and COVID-19 mortality. Regardless of the

304

differences in methods, these findings could have public health implications for populations

305

worldwide (37). Thus, they can be considered during the planning and implementation of

306

effective policies for COVID-19.

307

Nonetheless, there were other contrasting findings. For example, Mendy et al. (2020)

308

indicated that men are more likely to stay longer in hospitals due to COVID-19 than women.

309

Conversely, Guo et al. (2020) showed that women are more associated with prolonged

310

COVID-19 hospitalisation than men. Both studies had men dominating their study

311

participants, 53% and 57% respectively; but the proportion of men in Guo et al. (2020) were

312

marginally higher. However, in absolute figures, Mendy et al. (2020) included more male

313

participants (n=365) than Guo et al. (2020) (n=43). Therefore, these sample size variations

314

could account for the differences in their sex and LOS findings due to COVID-19. Moreover,

315

these findings are from only two studies; thus, they may not be enough to conclude the

316

association between sex and COVID-19 LOS. Further discussions on the review findings,

317

based on the determinants of health model, are provided below.

318
319

Demographic determinants of COVID-19 outcomes

320

The underlying mechanism for the association between older age and COVID-19 mortality is

321

unclear; however, several studies indicate that decrease in immune responses coupled with

322

increase comorbid burden with ageing may account for this observation (9, 38, 39). Another

323

study further explained that age-related changes or defects in the immune system, particularly

324

significant defect in cell-mediated immunity, primarily affects immune responses to diseases

325

(40). Also, evolution and ageing theories, like the antagonistic pleiotropy theory, postulate

326

that even beneficial genes at an early age may be less efficient or deleterious with increasing
20

327

age, and this may inherently increase susceptibility to previously shielded diseases (41, 42).

328

Moreover, current evidence suggests that increasing age is a common risk factor for several

329

health outcomes, like mortalities and morbidities (43-46).

330
331

Even though ageing generally decreases immune responses to diseases and infections, the

332

innate human response is mostly safeguarded (40). Thus, many individual and environmental

333

factors may account for the relationship between ageing and disease outcomes, such as

334

COVID-19 mortality. These factors may include nutritional deficiencies, decreased

335

functionality, exposure to pathogens, vaccinations, an individual’s lived experiences and

336

genetic make-up and access to health care (47). Furthermore, there are reports on good

337

COVID-19 prognosis in elderly patients (48). Therefore, it may be imperative to understand

338

how these factors cumulatively affect the immune system, and further mediate ageing and

339

decreased immune system relationship to provide exhaustive literature on the subject. Other

340

studies have also reported severe COVID-19 consequences in children (49, 50).

341

Consequently, there is a need for studies to focus more on children, as much as they have on

342

the adult population to offer a balanced argument to inform COVID-19 and ageing policies.

343
344

Like ageing, studies also attribute the sex disparities regarding COVID-19 mortality to sex-

345

based differences in immunological responses to viral infections (51, 52). The X sex

346

chromosome has encoded immune regulatory genes that decrease viral infections’

347

susceptibility (51). Since women have twice X-chromosomes to men, they tend to have

348

higher innate immunity to viral infections, like COVID-19, and by extension a lower risk of

349

severe COVID-19 outcomes than men (51, 53). Similarly, in contrast to oestrogen,

350

testosterone has an immunosuppressive effect; so, it attenuates men’s immune responses to

351

viral infections (54). Additionally, it is reported that men are genetically more predisposed to

21

352

produce higher levels interleukin (IL)-6, which are unfavourable to longevity, compared to

353

women (55). Apart from these biological reasons accounting for the sex differences in

354

COVID-19 mortality risk, behavioural and lifestyle factors like smoking and alcohol

355

consumption, have been implicated in the gender disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. Data

356

indicate that men are more likely to engage in these lifestyle factors that increase the risk of

357

COVID-19 deaths than women (52). Women are more likely to comply with COVID-19

358

precautionary measures than men and are more likely to remain confined than men (56).

359

Regarding LOS, the evidence is not enough to indicate whether sex determines longer

360

COVID-19 hospitalisation.

361
362

Biological/medical determinants of COVID-19 outcomes

363

The biological/medical determinants in this review were comorbidities, symptoms, and

364

laboratory findings of the included studies participants. The biological determinants of

365

COVID-19 outcomes included CKD, C-reactive protein, diabetes, hypertension, obesity,

366

cancer, COPD, dyspnea, asthma, and coronary heart disease. Clinical data reveal that chronic

367

conditions, such as the above, decrease innate immune responses in humans (57, 58). For

368

instance, metabolic diseases/disorders, like diabetes, attenuates immunity and increase risk to

369

infections by weakening lymphocyte and macrophage activities (59). Moreover, these chronic

370

conditions are associated with increase pro-inflammatory cytokines resulting from

371

dysregulation of systems, like the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and sympathetic nervous

372

system (58, 60). The accumulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines subsequently impairs

373

systemic and cellular immune functions (57, 61).

374

375

Furthermore, studies hypothesize that the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system

376

(RAAS) inhibitors, like angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), in the management of

377

some of these chronic conditions increase COVID-19 infectivity (62, 63). This is because

378

ACE2 also functions as a receptor for the COVID-19 virus (64). This RAAS and ACE-2

379

hypothesis recently sparked debate and discourse on gold standard medical management of

380

comorbidities in COVID-19 patients. One study indicated that sudden discontinuation of

381

ACE-2 might have far worse consequences for high-risk-COVID-19 patients, particularly

382

those with cardiovascular conditions, like myocardial infarction (65). Their argument is

383

hinged on the paucity of human studies to corroborate the RAAS and ACE-2 theory.

384

Additionally, experimental studies in mice showed that ACE-2 downregulation facilitates

385

lung injuries and increases viral loads (60, 66). Thus, several human studies are needed to

386

substantiate the harmful effect, or otherwise, of RAAS inhibitors in the management of

387

COVID-19 patients with comorbidities.

388
389

Lifestyle determinants of COVID-19 outcomes

390

The included studies examined only smoking as a lifestyle determinant of COVID-19

391

mortality. The association between smoking and COVID-19 mortality is biologically

392

plausible because smoking is a risk factor for several conditions, like coronary heart disease

393

and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), that are associated with severe

394

COVID-19 outcomes (67). Also, a cohort study with an average of 9.6 years follow-up by

395

showed that 11% (men) and 13% (women) of pneumonia and COPD deaths were attributable

396

to smoking (68). Additionally, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also

397

report that smoking is associated with about 113,000 respiratory deaths each year in the

398

United States (69). Since COVID-19 is a respiratory infection and based on the above

23

399

evidence on smoking-related respiratory deaths, it may be reasonable to make projections that

400

smoking may be significantly associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes.

401

Furthermore, data shows that smokers have increased upregulation or expression of ACE-2,

402

the reported enzyme receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) (70), which may increase their

403

risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes compared to non-smokers. A single-cell sequencing

404

experiment further demonstrated that cigarette smoking upregulates ACE-2 in humans' lungs

405

and increases their susceptibility to COVID-19 infections (71). They inferred that smoking

406

cessation could reduce ACE-2 expression and thereby reduce the risk of COVID-19 disease.

407

Thus, their findings advance the above argument on the benefit or otherwise of ACE-2

408

dysregulation in humans in reducing the burden of COVID-19. Consequently, systematic

409

reviews and meta-analyses of several high-quality studies on ACE-2 and COVID-19 are

410

required to provide empirical evidence to inform policy and clinical practice. All the same,

411

this review is limited in drawing a meaningful conclusion on the association between

412

smoking and COVID-19 mortality because only one of the included studies identified

413

smoking as a risk factor of COVID-19 mortality.

414
415

Policy implications

416

This review findings re-enforce the need for health systems to continue the testing, tracing,

417

and isolation policies to reduce the spread of the virus and subsequently decrease the burden

418

of the pandemic, particularly for high-risk individuals identified in this review. Additionally,

419

countries, such as Nigeria, that are yet to implement crucial public health policies, like

420

immunisation and routine COVID-19 testing, can draw lessons from countries like the UK

421

that have benefited immensely from such policies. Although this may come with increased

422

direct costs, especially the cost of PPEs and testing equipment, the indirect benefits to

423

populations, such as reduced disease burden and improved productivity, might be enormous

424

for these countries.

425

However, lockdown policies, which seems to be the go-to policy for most countries, must be

426

evaluated holistically, to ascertain their overall benefits, especially as the pandemic continues

427

to rage. Evidence shows that lockdowns are beneficial when introduced at an earlier stage of

428

an outbreak than later. For example, evaluating the national lockdown response in Norway,

429

USA, Argentina, and the UK shows that the lockdown’s timing and not the lockdown itself

430

significantly reduced the burden of the outbreak in Argentina and Norway compared to the

431

UK and the USA. For instance, the UK suffered significant health and economic recession

432

due to the delays in the lockdown response to the viral outbreak. Their delay in implementing

433

the first lockdown resulted in several other lockdowns that have had further economic

434

implications. Therefore, lockdowns must be implemented earlier to prevent dire health and

435

economic consequences.

436

Even the timing of lockdowns alone may not be enough to radically reduce viral transmission

437

rate and consequently limit the probability of infections in high-risk individuals because data

438

from other jurisdictions that introduced earlier national lockdowns, like Ghana, showed a

439

steady increase in transmissions during the lockdown and a rapid rise few weeks post

440

lockdown. Also, it is still crippling with the lockdown induced economic downfall. This

441

suggests that lockdowns as single policies may be ineffective in plummeting COVID-19

442

infections, mortalities, and financial hardships. Consequently, global health systems must

443

also place a premium on other equally important policies, like robust testing and tracing.

444

Currently, most countries do not conduct follow-up COVID-19 testing following negative

445

test results at entry borders. A negative test result on arrival at entry borders may not be

446

enough to declare individuals as virus-free since it can take fourteen days maximum for the

447

virus to be detected, per the WHO guidelines. Thus, governments must apply both on arrival

448

and fourteen days post border arrival COVID-19 testing to ensure comprehensive

449

identification of all positive cases to curtail the virus’s potential spread.

450

Additionally, it will be crucial for countries, like the USA and Brazil, to implement the

451

fourteen-day quarantine policies for all border entries, as it has shown to be effective

452

reducing the COVID-19 impact in places like Argentina. Countries with partial quarantine

453

policies, such as Ghana, will benefit from instituting mandatory quarantine for all border

454

arrivals at government selected facilities since self-isolation education and passenger locator

455

forms may be inadequate in reducing the viral spread. Furthermore, health systems must

456

continuously promote behavioural change interventions to establish significant control over

457

the viral outbreak. Enforcing compliance to behavioural change interventions, like social

458

distancing, nose mask use, social hand washing and cough etiquette, can be the significant

459

catalyst needed to decrease the pandemic’s impact. Finally, the continuous increase in the

460

COVID-19 cases and mortality indicate the need for an urgent review of current health

461

policies at both international and national levels to implement suitable context-specific

462

interventions to mitigate the COVID-19 menace effectively.

463
464

Concerning this study’s strength, this is the first systematic review synthesising the evidence

465

on LOS determinants, to the best of the researchers’ knowledge. Therefore, it presents novel

466

findings that could initiate useful interventions to address the burden of prolonged

467

hospitalisation associated with COVID-19. It could also cause a paradigm shift and ensure

468

holistic research coverage on all COVID-19 outcomes. Moreover, this is the first review to

469

provide a comprehensive investigation of contextual determinants of COVID-19 outcomes,

470

based on the determinants of health model. It identified crucial gaps in the literature on the

471

determinants of COVID-19 outcomes that require urgent attention. Additionally, this review

472

evaluated current public health policies and suggested strategies to augment area-specific

473

efforts at curbing the COVID-19 problem. Regarding limitations, the review was restricted in

474

conducting further analysis, specifically, meta-analysis, to precisely estimate the associations’

475

effect size due to included studies’ heterogeneity. Also, most of the included studies (n=12)

476

used retrospective design, thus, there was the possibility of residual confounders that could

477

influence this review’s findings. Additionally, all of them used secondary data from medical

478

records of participants. Therefore, any omission or data entry error could affect their results

479

and this review. Hence, caution must be taken when interpreting the findings of this review.

480
481
482

Conclusion and recommendations

483

This study’s overarching aim was to examine the determinants of COVID-19 outcomes. The

484

review findings showed that increasing age and comorbidities are more likely to determine

485

COVID-19 outcomes. Thus, policies, like routine COVID-19 testing and prioritised

486

vaccination to shield these high-risk individuals, must be sustained and extended to other

487

populations yet to implement such important policies. Most importantly, health systems must

488

continually review existing policies to ensure their context-specific relevance, especially with

489

the emergence of a new viral variant and the rapid surge in cases. Based on this review, the

490

authors recommend that future studies also focus on determinants of COVID-19 LOS.

491

Additionally, studies should explore the determinants of COVID-19 outcomes in low-

492

income-countries to ensure holistic and context-specific evidence on risk factors of COVID-

493

19 mortality in the literature.
