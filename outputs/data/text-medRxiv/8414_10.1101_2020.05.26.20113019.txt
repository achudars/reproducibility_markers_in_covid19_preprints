The UK has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and London in particular has
experienced a large number of cases. The London Underground is a key part of the transport
for London. The UK Government has implemented social distancing rules meaning that
people should be 2 metres from each other. The current paper models the impact of the
social distancing on the carrying capacity of 10 different underground and overground
carriages. The model determines the optimal standing and seating capacity for the different
carriages and identifies logistical approaches to the seating and standing arrangements.
Keywords: COVID19, SARS-CoV-2, social distancing, London Underground, London transport
Introduction
A novel coronavirus SARS-COV2 causing Pneumonia was identified in Wuhan, China in 2019
(Zhou et al, 2020). The illness resulting from the virus was named COVID-19. The COVID-19
outbreak was reported to the World Health Organisation on December 31st 2019 (WHO,
2020). The outbreak later developed into a pandemic. The United Kingdom was affected and
London in particular has experienced a significant proportion of cases of COVID-19 and
deaths (The London Intelligence, 2020). The UK Government has implemented a phased
approach to managing the pandemic with the initiation of a lockdown.
Essential workers in London have been travelling to work. An important aspect of this in
London has been the use of the London underground when alternative modes of transport
are not possible. There is evidence that the London Underground can be a source of
transmission of SARS-COV2. In one study, the researchers found an increased rate of
infection in London boroughs with access to an underground interchange (Sasidharan et al,
2020). At one point, it was reported that 30% of selected staff groups at Transport for
London were unable to come to work as they were either self-isolating or ill with COVID-19
(Transport for London, 2020).
The current paper aims to examine what impact the current UK Government mandated
social distancing policy has on the capacity of London Underground cars (including
overground cars).
Methodology
The modelling was done in two parts. Firstly a literature search identified relevant data.
Secondly the data was used to inform the calculations to derive the carrying capacity and
these calculations are further outlined below.

A search of the scientific literature was undertaken using Pubmed (PubMed, 2020), MedRxiv
(MedRxiv, 2020) and BioRxiv (BioRxiv, 2020) using the following search terms: ‘London
underground and Covid-19’, ‘underground capacity and Covid-19’, ‘underground and social
distancing’. A supplementary search was undertaken using Google using the search term
‘London underground capacity’ to obtain technical information about the underground
transport.
Calculating Generic Standing Capacity
Standing capacity was modelled using social distancing rules. A person must stand 2 metres
from other people. This is illustrated in figure 1.

Figure 1: Illustrating a person standing 2 metres from others.
The distance of 2 metres thus forms the radius of a circle. The area of the circle can be
calculated from
Area = Radius squared x Pi
Therefore the area that one person would occupy whilst adhering to UK social distance
policy is
Area = 2 x 2 x Pi metres squared = 12.566 metres squared (3 decimal places)
Translating this into density, the current UK social distancing policy requires a person
density of
1/12.566 persons per square metre = 0.0796 (4 decimal places) persons per square metre

Data was utilised from a website (Ian Visits, 2020) in which underground train capacity was
derived from other data sources (What do they know, 2020(a))(What do they know,
2020(b)). A figure of 5 persons-per-metre squared which can be seen in the included Rolling
Stock Data Sheet (What do they know, 2020 (a)) was used to populate a table on the site
(Ian Visits, 2020) which included standing and sitting capacities. Therefore the initial
transformation of standing capacity when applied to this data would result in a 62.8-fold
reduction in standing capacity before other factors are applied.

Estimating Seating Capacity

Retrieved data was used to estimate seating capacity. Microsoft Paint was used to overlay a
grid on the schematics and enable measurements. The resulting measurements were used
in the analysis of the impact of social distancing on seating and standing capacity.

Modifying Standard Capacity and Estimating Final Capacity

Retrieved data was used to estimate the impact of social distancing on the interaction
between sitting and standing capacities and used to derive a final capacity. This was done
using the individual schematics for each subtype of London underground cars.

Results
Literature Search
The literature search was completed on 25.5.20 across 3 databases and 1390 papers were
identified and are further outlined in Table 1. Of these, only 2 were relevant to the present
paper but did not provide any data for the purposes of modelling. A Google search
identified a website citing data for carriage capacity based on a previously retrieved
Freedom of Information request.

Sitting Capacity

Estimating Seating Capacity From a Worked Example
The 1967 Victoria Line tube stock schematics for the trailer car were used to derive seating
capacity (WDTK, 2020). The grid overlay is shown in figure 2.

Worked Example

The measurements on the schematics indicate that the trailer car length is 54 ft 5 inches
(16.58 metres (2DP)). The length of the carriage is 50 squares on the superimposed grid and
therefore each square is approximately 33cm. The carriage contains 3 groups of 12 seats.
However 2 metres is equivalent to the width of 6 squares. Therefore any seating in the same
row must accommodate a separation of 6 squares and therefore a maximum of 2 people
per row. The distance from the back of one seat to the back of the seat on the opposing row
is 7 squares and therefore the seating arrangements on opposing rows can be independent
of each other. The total seating capacity is reduced from 36 per carriage in this case, to 12
representing 33% of total seating capacity. These findings are generalised to the other types
of carriage to derive a total seating capacity as shown in Table 3.

Table 3: Modified Seating Capacity Resulting from Application of Social Distancing Policy

Estimating the Interaction Between Seating and Standing Capacity
The final determination is the interaction between the seating and standing capacities. This
required a move away from the generalisations in the previous two estimations and
incorporation of the geometric properties of the transport.
Worked Example – Victoria Line Trailer Car
It is clear that standing cannot occur between the seated areas if the seated areas are at
capacity (i.e. 2 in each row). Therefore the area between the seats must be excluded from
the seating capacity calculations.

Although the person density has been used to revise the standing capacity figures, there are
other factors that play an over-riding role. The end seats in the seated areas contain a glass
partition and this allows for standing positions standing close to the glass partition such that
there is a separation of 2 metres between opposing standing positions and this can be
reproduced on the opposing side. However the separation between standing and sitting
passengers is less but with a physical barrier.
Utilising this new arrangement, the carriage has 4 standing areas. 2 of these areas have a
capacity of 2 people and 2 have a capacity of 4 people. Therefore the total in each carriage
is 12 people standing for the Victoria Line Trailer Car. The Motor Car has 2 less standing
positions as this is replaced by the driver’s carriage.
Therefore for the example of the Victoria Line carriages, there would be a capacity as shown
below.
(7 x 24) + (1 x 23) person = 191 persons (including the driver)
Consideration of Other Motor and Trailer Cars
The schematics for the remaining carriages were inspected and the same rationale used to
populate Table 4 whilst again taking into consideration the geometric properties of the cars
as well as the seating arrangements and presence of physical barriers. The analysis
proceeded similarly to the worked example above but there were a few important
differences.
The following assumptions were used:
1. On the Bakerloo line, the motor car seating arrangement differs from the trailer car
in that in addition to the driver compartment there is a section in the middle of the
car that has a denser seating arrangement. Given the social distancing guidance, it is
assumed that the seating capacity would be equivalent to the Victoria Line trailer
carriage as the 2 metre distance precludes more than one person occupying the
same vertically aligned seat (vertical being defined here as perpendicular to the
length of the carriage). Therefore the seats on each opposing row should be
considered as viable for more than one person only in the horizontal direction since
only then is a separation of 2 metres possible.
2. The analysis does not consider the use of the uncoupling car and instead focuses
solely on the use of the driver and trailer cars.
3. The surface carriages are wider but this does not increase the standing capacity due
to the area needed for social distancing.

Table 4: Final Total Capacity Calculations for Different Underground Models

Discussion
The paper makes a number of assumptions based on the schematics of different
underground and overground cars on the London Underground. The capacity was calculated
on the basis of these assumptions and shows a reduction in the projected capacity of the
cars based on the adherence to social distancing principles. However it should be noted that
another source gives a figure of 3 persons-per-metre squared as that intended in the
original design of the transport cars (What do they know, 2020 (a)). Therefore the original
standing capacity in Table 2 is an overestimation of standing capacity by 67%. This in turn
means that social distancing person density is a 3800% reduction in standing capacity
compared to the intended design although the subsequent analysis incorporating the
geometry of the cars allows for a higher standing capacity.
The main findings are that standing can occur in specified portions of the car but should
avoid the area between the seats when they are occupied at capacity. The main standing
areas would be in the space horizontally (i.e. parallel to the length of the car) adjacent to
the seating areas and in front of the doors. These areas are of two types – wide and thin. For
the wide areas, four standing people can be accommodated standing in the four corners of
the area so as to maximally separate from each other. The passengers can stand close to the
windows separating the standing area from the seating area. For the thin areas, two people
can be accommodated on opposite sides. There are various seating areas but as a general
rule, seating should be considered in the horizontal orientation and each row of seating can
accommodate two people.
The reduced capacity of each car requires a compensatory increase in the frequency of the
underground trains or else an increase in the cars per train if this is possible, depending on
the demand. A mismatch between the train capacity and the passengers may result in
crowding on platforms depending on how the flow is managed.
Another consideration is for the arrangements for boarding and alighting from the car which
will require an increased time so as to enable passengers to maintain a distance of 2 metres
from each other. Passengers would need to communicate with each other about how they
will alight from the car whilst maintaining social distance. The standing and seated positions
could be marked and an educational campaign initiated to ensure that commuters
understand the logistics of this arrangement.

Further consideration will be needed for the use of the glass barriers in separating standing
and sitting passengers as if this cannot be used, then it would reduce the standing capacity.

Drawbacks
The current paper uses data from an information sheet from 2007 and derived data from
2016 as the starting point for the analysis. There may be more recent data of relevance but
this was not identified in the literature and supplemental searches. The modelling does not
factor in the effects of forced ventilation, the dissipation of fine water droplets or the
integrity of glass partitions which are assumed to offer a barrier between those seated and
standing close to the partition. The modelling does not factor in changes to the number of
cars that mirror changes in the number of passengers over time. The modelling also does
not factor in passengers that require more space.
