Abstract
In the note, the logistic growth regression model is used for the estimation of the final
size and its peak time of the coronavirus epidemic in China, South Korea, and the rest
of the World.
1 Introduction
In the previous article [1], we try to estimate the final size of the epidemic for the whole
World using the logistic model and SIR model. The estimation was about 83000 cases.
Both models show that the outbreak is moderating; however, new data showed a linear
upward trend. It turns out that the epidemy in China was slowing but is begin to
spread elsewhere in the World.
In this note, we will give forecasting epidemic size for China, South Korea, and the rest
of the World and daily predictions using the logistic model. Full daily reports for
China, Germany, Iran, Italy, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain and counties outside of
China generated are available at

-19_epidemic_size
The MATLAB program fitVirus used for calculations is freely available from
https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/74411-fitvirus
We note that logistic models give similar results as the SIR model (at least for the case
of China and South Korea). However, the logistic model is given by explicit formula
and is thus much simpler for regression analysis than the SIR model, where one must

however, use approximate solution and thus obtain four-parameter problem which can
be very sensitive to initial guess). Yet, the logistics model has its drawbacks as the
epidemic approaches its final stage: the actual number of cases may be slightly larger
than that predicted by the logistics model. If the actual number of cases begins to
exceed the predicted end-state systematically, then a second phase of the epidemic is
likely to occur, and the model will no longer be applicable.
2 Logistic grow model
In mathematical epidemiology, when one uses a phenomenological approach, the
epidemic dynamics can be described by the following variant of logistic growth model

Now, if C 1,C 2 , ,C n are the number of cases at times t1, t2 , , tn , then the final size
predictions of the epidemic based on these data are K 1, K 2 , , K n . When convergence
is achieved, then one may try to predict the final epidemic size by iterated Shanks
transformation [6]
K 

K n 1K n 1  K n2
K n 1  2K n  K n 1

.

(9)

There is no natural law or process behind this transformation; therefore, it must be
used with some care. In particular, the calculated limit is useless if K  C n , i.e., it is
below the current data.
The logistic model (2) contains three parameters: K, r, and A, which should be
determined by regression analysis. Because the model is nonlinear, some care should be
taken for initial guess. First of all, in the early stage, the logistic curve follows an
exponential growth curve (3) , so the estimation of K is practically impossible. With
enough data, the initial guess can be obtain in the following way. Expressing t from (2)
and use three equidistant data point yield the following system of three equations:

values of the parameters K, r, and A are then calculated by least-square fit using the
MATLAB functions lsqcurvefit and fitnlm.

Figure 2. Epidemic phases
Before we proceed, we for convenience, introduce the following epidemy phases (see Fig
2):
1. Phase 1 – exponential growth (lag phase, slow growth) : t  t p  2 r
2. Phase 2 – fast growth (positive growth phase, acceleration phase) to an epidemy
turning point: t p  2 r  t  t p
3. Phase 3 – fast growth to steady-state (negative growth phase, deceleration
phase): t p  t  t p  2 r

5. Phase 5 – steady) ending phase (plateau stage): t  2t p
The duration of the fast-growing period is thus equal to   4 r . We note that the
names of the phases are not standard, and are arbitrarily chosen.

3 Results
3.1 China (11.Mar 2020)
On the base of available data, one can predict that the final size of coronavirus epidemy
in China using the logistic model will be approximately 81 000 ± 500 cases (Table 1)
and that the peak of the epidemic was on 8 Feb 2020 (Table 2). It seems that the
epidemic in China is in the ending stage (Fig 3, Fig 4).
The short-term forecasting is given in Table 3 where we see that the discrepancy of
actual and forecasted number of cases is within 2%. However, actual and predicted
daily new cases are scattered and vary between 13% to 300%. On 7 Mar 2020, the
actual number of cases was 80695, and the daily number of cases was 44. Prediction in
Table 3 is cumulative 80588 cases and 39 daily cases. The errors are 0.1% and 11%,
respectively.

3.2 South Korea (11.Mar 2020)
On the base of available data, one can predict that the final size of coronavirus epidemy
in of South Korea using the logistic model will be approximately 8050 ±70 cases (Fig
5, Table 4) and that the peak of the epidemic was on 1 Mar 2020. The epidemic in
South Korea appears to be in the steady-state transition phase. These figures were
already predicted on 4. Mar 2020 (Table 5), i.e., the prediction was approximately 7500
to 8500 cases and that the peak will be around 2 Mar.
On 7 Mar 2020, the actual number of cases was 7134, and the daily number of cases
was 367. Prediction in Table 5 is cumulative 6572 cases and 259 daily cases. The errors
are 8 % and 30%, respectively.

3.3. Rest of the World
The comparison of the predicted final sizes is shown in the graph in Figure 6. Based
on the data from 11. Mar 2020, a very rough estimate indicates that the number of
cases will be about 90000 (Fig 7); data from 13. Mar 2020 rise this number to 380 000.
However, it is an early-stage epidemic, so these estimates are very questionable and
will be changed with new data.

4 Conclusion
On the base of available data, one can predict that the final size of coronavirus epidemy
in China will be around 81 000 cases. For South Korea, a prediction is about 8000
cases. For the rest of the World, the forecasts are still very unreliable in is now
approximately 380 000 cases.
We emphasize that the logistics model is a phenomenological, data-driven model. Thus,
its forecasts are as reliable as useful are data and as good as the model can capture the
dynamics of the epidemic. As daily epidemic size forecasts begin to converge, it can be
said that the outbreak is under control. However, any systematic deviation from the
forecast curve may indicate that the epidemic is escaping control. An example is China.
By 25. Feb., the data follows a logistic curve and then begins to deviate from it. We
now know that this was the beginning of the second stage of the epidemic, which is
now spreading around the World. A similar linear trend can now be observed for South
Korea (Fig 5); we hope this does not mark the beginning of the second stage of the
epidemic in this country.
