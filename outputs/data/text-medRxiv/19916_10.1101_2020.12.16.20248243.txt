ABSTRACT

Background: Health and key workers are at an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; it is not
known, however, if this risk is exacerbated in those with irregular work patterns. We aimed to
investigate the risk of severe COVID-19 in health and shift workers.
Methods: We included UK Biobank participants in employment or self-employed at baseline and
with linked COVID-19 data to 31st August 2020. Participants were grouped as neither a health worker
nor shift worker (reference category), health worker only, shift worker only, or both and associations
with severe COVID-19 investigated in logistic regressions.
Findings: Of 235,685 participants (81·5% neither health nor shift worker, 1·4% health worker only,
16·9% shift worker only, and 0·3% both), there were 580 (0·25%) cases of severe COVID-19. The risk
of severe COVID-19 was higher in health workers (adjusted odds ratio: 2.32 [95% CI: 1·33, 4·05]; shift
workers (2·06 [1·72, 2·47]); and in health workers who worked shifts (7·56 [3·86, 14·79]). Being both
a health worker and a shift worker had a possible greater impact on the risk severe COVID-19 in
South Asian and Black and African Caribbean ethnicities compared to White individuals.
Interpretation: Both health and shift work were independently associated with over twice the risk of
severe COVID-19; the risk was over seven times higher in health workers who work shifts.
Vaccinations, therapeutic and preventative options should take into consideration not only health
and key worker status but also shift worker status.

Research in context

Evidence before this study
The risk of developing severe COVID-19 is greater in occupational groups with higher levels of viral exposure, e.g.
health and key workers. We searched PubMed and medRxiv up to December 8, 2020 for papers on shift work
patterns, health work and incidence of COVID-19 using the keywords “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “shift work”
“health worker”. Recent evidence suggests shift workers are also at increased risk of severe COVID-19 but it is not
clear if the risk is exacerbated in those who work shifts in healthcare.

Added value of this study
This study uses data from UK Biobank, a prospective cohort of >500,000 adults aged 40-69 years with baseline
assessments between March 2006 and July 2010. Participants’ occupation was categorised according to whether or
not they were health workers and/or shift workers at baseline. Results showed that being a health worker, or
working shifts, were similarly and independently associated with over twice the population level risk of severe
COVID-19 independent of age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation and co-morbidities. The risk was seven times higher in
health workers with shift working patterns. The impact of health and shift work tended to be higher in males and in
minority ethnic groups, who are already at an increased risk of severe COVID-19. In people over the age of
retirement, the risk of developing severe COVID-19 associated with baseline health worker status was no longer
apparent, suggesting the risk is likely explained by exposure to the virus. However, the elevated risk associated with
baseline shift worker status persisted, albeit attenuated.

Implications of all the available evidence
Shift workers are at elevated risk of developing severe COVID-19. The persistence of an elevated risk in people who
are now over retirement age, but had a shift worker status at baseline, suggests the risk may not be fully explained
by increased exposure to the virus. Vaccination, therapeutic and prevention programmes are being prioritised for
health care workers. Our data suggests that shift workers should also be prioritised for these preventive measures.

INTRODUCTION

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus
disease-2019 (COVID-19), is a global health threat.1 It has led to an unprecedented co-ordinated
global research effort to develop and evaluate a range of vaccines. To date, preliminary results are in
for three candidate vaccines and priority groups for vaccination have been identified. The provisional
priority list in the UK focuses on care home residents and their carers, front-line health and social
care workers, and older adults.2 The high priority for health workers and care workers is due to the
established elevated risk in these groups for infection, development of severe infection and
spreading infection.3–7 This risk is further increased for health workers from ethnic minorities.6 There
has been less attention on whether the risk is exacerbated in those with irregular work patterns, i.e.
shift work, which is common in health and care.

Working shifts is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease8–11 which appears to
persist following retirement, although attenuated.11 Research suggests risk factors for
cardiometabolic diseases12 are also risk factors for COVID-19.13–15 Further, shift work is associated
with alterations in the immune system and an increased risk for viral infections.16 In this view, it is
not surprising that recent evidence suggests that shift work is associated with an elevated risk of
severe COVID-19,5,17 and that health care workers on night shifts have a higher risk of in-hospital
SARS-CoV-2 infection than those on day shifts.18 However, it is not known whether working shifts
interacts with health worker status or ethnicity, both of which are independently associated with an
elevated risk.6,19,20

Shift workers are more likely to have disturbed sleep and variable sleep patterns21 leading to
disruption of the circadian rhythm. This has been hypothesised to increase the risk of COVID-19 in
night shift workers,22 but is evident even if the shift pattern does not include night work, likely due
to sleep disruption in relation to circadian rhythms,21 and may persist in the years following
cessation of shift work.23 Recent data have suggested that sleep disruption and high variability in
sleep timing are associated with the risk of testing positive for COVID-19 and development of severe
infection.15 Exacerbating this, shift work is common in health workers where exposure to infection
with SARS-CoV-2 and risk of developing severe COVID-19 is already relatively high.6,7 Therefore, we
hypothesise both health workers and shift workers will independently be at an increased risk of
severe COVID-19, but this risk will be increased in health workers who are also shift workers.

Further, we hypothesise that the increased risk will be evident across ethnic groups and for males

METHODS

This study is reported as per the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in
Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines (Supplementary material: Checklist S1) and following a prespecified protocol (Application Number 36371).24

Study population
For this analysis, we used data from UK Biobank (application 36371), a prospective cohort of >500,000
adults aged 40-69 years.25 All baseline assessments were conducted between March 2006 and July
2010. UK Biobank data are linked to national SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test data through Public Health
England’s Second Generation Surveillance System.26 The data were available from 16th March 2020 to
31st August 2020 and included outcome of the test (positive/negative) and specimen origin (hospital
inpatient vs other). Analyses were restricted to those who were alive on 16th March 2020 (the first
COVID-19 testing sample date) and to English centres as testing data were initially only for those based
in England.

Exposure
Participants’ occupation was categorised according to whether or not they were health workers
and/or shift workers based on the occupation information reported at baseline. Health care workers
were classified based on UK Biobank occupational codes 2211001-2216012. Participants who reported
that their work involved shift work “sometimes”, “usually” or “always” were classified as shift workers,
while participants who reported that their work “never/rarely” involved shift work were classified as
non-shift workers. Shift or health worker status was defined as four mutually exclusive categories:
neither (reference category), health worker only, shift worker only, or both health and shift worker.
Only participants who reported being in paid employment or self-employed at baseline were asked
about shift work. Those without data for shift work and health work status were excluded
(Supplementary material, Figure S1).

Outcome
Severe COVID-19 was defined as a composite of a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 from a hospital
setting in line with guidance for this dataset,26 or death related to the disease (i.e. any death with an
ICD-10 code of U07.1 or U07.2 as the primary cause of death on the death certificate). Positive tests
in an outpatient setting were removed from this analysis as we were unable to determine whether
these ultimately resulted in hospitalisation. Results can thus be interpreted as the overall population

level risk of being admitted to hospital with or dying from COVID-19 during the linkage period within
UK Biobank. This population level method of assessing risk has been commonly reported within
COVID-19 risk factor research, enabling comparison to the literature in terms of how the risk factors
assessed compare to other commonly reported risk factors.13–15,27

Co-variates/confounders
Participant characteristics, including body mass index (BMI), sex, ethnicity (White, South Asian, Black
and African Caribbean), deprivation (Townsend score, a composite measure of deprivation based on
unemployment, non-car ownership, non-home ownership, and household overcrowding; negative
values represent less deprivation), cancer (self-reported), co-morbidities (yes/no; one or more
medical condition(s): i.e. cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, neurology, musculoskeletal, haematology,
gynaecology, immunology, infections), and smoking status (never, previous current) were collected at
the baseline assessment. Age on 16th March 2020 was calculated.

Statistical Analysis
Logistic regression was used to identify the risk associated with developing severe COVID-19 in shift
workers only, health workers only and both health and shift workers, relative to non-health workers
with normal working hours. These four categories are mutually exclusive to facilitate interpretation of
the independent and effects of shift and health worker status, and whether their combination
provides an additive or multiplicative association. Analyses were carried out overall and stratified by
ethnicity and sex. Analyses were adjusted for potential confounders (age, sex, BMI, ethnicity,
deprivation, cancer, co-morbidities, smoking status) selected based on current knowledge.

Two sensitivity analyses were carried out: 1) Including as co-variate self-reported sleep duration at
baseline; 2) Stratified by retirement age (currently 66 years of age in the UK). People below retirement
age at the beginning of the pandemic were assumed most likely to still be working and thus at higher
exposure to the virus (individuals with an age at time of COVID-19 test equal to or below 65 years).
People above retirement age were assumed to be less likely to be working and thus at lower exposure
to the virus (individuals with an age at time of COVID-19 above 65 years). Baseline age was measured
as an integer in years.

All analyses were carried out in Stata version 16.0 (StataCorp LLC, TX, USA). Statistical significance was
set at the alpha level of .05.

RESULTS
There were 235,685 participants eligible for inclusion in this analysis (i.e. with information on
outcome of severe COVID-19, shift or health worker status, and full co-variate profile), of which 580
(0·25%) had severe COVID-19. Mean participant age was 63·8 years (SD 7·1), BMI 27·2 kg·m-2 (SD
4·7), 52·2% were female, and 96·1% were White (Table 1); 81·5% (n=193,135) were neither a shift
nor health worker, 16·9% (n=38,738) were a shift worker only, 1·4% (n=3,193) a health worker only,
and 0·3% (n=620) both.
After adjustment for potential confounders, a significant association was found between shift
worker only (adjusted odds ratios (aOR): 2·06 [95% CI: 1·72, 2·47]) or health worker only (2·32 [1·33,
4·05]) status and risk of severe COVID-19 (Figure 1a). The estimated risk was greatest for individuals
who were both a shift and health worker (aOR: 7·56 [3·86, 14·79]). A similar pattern was found when
the analysis was stratified by sex (Figure 1a), with a higher estimated association for both shift and
health worker status in men (aOR: 10·70 [4·92, 23·28]) than women (aOR: 3·58 [0·88, 14·54]). When
the analysis was stratified by ethnicity (Figure 1b), there was a tendency for a greater impact of
being both a health worker and a shift worker in South Asian and Black and African Caribbean
ethnicities when compared to White, but confidence intervals were large.
Results of unadjusted models were consistent with the adjusted models and are given in
Supplementary Table S1.
Sensitivity analyses
In the first sensitivity analysis, controlling for sleep duration did not change the results
(Supplementary Figure S2).
The second sensitivity analysis, stratified by retirement age, was conducted for the whole sample
only, due to small numbers in the sex and ethnicity sub-groups. There were 125,118 eligible
individuals below retirement age (54·2% female, 94·8% White) and assumed to be working, of which
312 (0·25%) had severe COVID-19. Of these 80·1% (n=100,170) were neither a shift nor health
worker, 18·2% (n=22,819) were a shift worker only, 1·4% (n=1,708) a health worker only, and 0·3%
(n=421) both. There was a similar pattern of results, with estimated odds ratios generally larger than
when the whole cohort was considered (Figure 2).
Eligible people above retirement age and assumed to be retired were 110,567 (50·0% female, 97·6%
White), of which 268 (0·24%) had severe COVID-19. Of these, 84·1% (n=92,964) had been neither a
shift nor health worker, 14·4% (n=15,919) a shift worker only, 1·3% (n=1,485) a health worker only,
and none who had been both. The risk associated with prior shift worker status persisted, albeit

evident (Figure 3).

DISCUSSION
Both being a health worker, or working shifts, were independently associated with over twice the
population level risk of severe COVID-19; notably, the risk was more than seven times higher in
health workers who work shifts. The impact of health and shift work tends to be higher in males and
in minority ethnic groups, who are already at increased risk of severe COVID-19.19,20
The risk of severe COVID-19 was stronger when considering only people below retirement age at the
beginning of the pandemic, thus more likely to still be working and at increased viral exposure.
When considering only people above retirement age at the beginning of the pandemic, the risk
associated with health worker status appears to dissipate. This potentially suggests that the elevated
risk in the whole population or those under retirement age is indeed explained by increased
exposure to the virus. In contrast, an elevated risk associated with prior shift-work status persists,
although attenuated. Alongside the higher risk for health workers who work shifts, this suggests that
the risk associated with shift work may not be fully explained by an increased viral exposure.
The persistence of an elevated risk associated with shift work following retirement has previously
been identified for cardiovascular disease.11 Purported mechanisms include disruptions to the
behavioural and circadian rhythm,8 which can lead to chronic inflammation,28 potentially
contributing to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease observed in previous shift workers. As
COVID-19 is an acute inflammatory disease,28 it may exacerbate any existing chronic inflammation.
Alongside other risk factors (e.g. lifestyle factors, psychological stress and genetic predisposition),
this may be associated with a ‘cytokine storm’22,28,29 contributing to the increased risk of severe
COVID-19 we observed in shift-workers.
The demand for 24-hour services has extended shift work beyond factories to more traditionally
“white collar” occupations, e.g. retail and service,30 with approximately 15-25% of workers in Europe
employed on shift schedules.10,16 Irrespective, shift workers still tend to be more deprived and
subject to psychosocial stresses,9 which may contribute to increased risk for cardiovascular disease
and COVID-19. While we controlled for a range of available co-variates, including age, sex, ethnicity,
deprivation, co-morbidities and self-reported sleep (sensitivity analysis), other residual confounders
may be present that predispose the shift workers to greater risk. However, Maidstone et al.17
recently showed that the incidence of COVID-19 in shift workers was still greater when compared to
non-shift workers in the same job. Further, in a previous UK Biobank study, we showed that
objectively measured sleep disruption and variability in sleep timing was associated with increased
risk of severe COVID-19.15 While disturbed sleep is prevalent in shift workers,21 the risk was similar
when excluding shift workers from the cohort.15 This observation would suggest that sleep

12
disturbance and variability in sleep timing, even in the absence of shift work status, is associated
with an increased risk. Likewise, irregular sleep timing was associated with metabolic abnormalities
in a prospective study on cardiovascular events in ~2000 participants,12 with similar results when
shift workers were excluded.
Strengths of this study include the large population with linked COVID-19 data. In addition, the UK
Biobank differs from many other datasets currently being analysed to better understand COVID-19,
in that it is an extensively phenotyped population, allowing the impact of issues such as shift worker
status to be assessed. However, the study also has several important limitations. Characteristics of
participants, including health worker and shift work status, were measured between 2006 and 2010.
Mutambudzi et al.5 and Maidstone et al.17 similarly used occupation at UK Biobank baseline to
ascertain risk of severe COVID-19. In support of this assumption, Matambudzi et al.5 determined a
high correlation (r = 0.71, p<0.001) between occupation at baseline and occupation between 2014
and 2019 in a sub-sample of >12,000, participants indicating a high likelihood that participants had
continued working in the same profession. Further, in our analyses stratified by retirement age, we
assumed that those below retirement age at the date of their COVID-19 test were still working and
at relatively high exposure to COVID-19, while those above retirement age were not working and
were at lower exposure. It is not possible to confirm this assumption with the available data.
Additionally, the definition of severe COVID-19 was a positive test from a hospital inpatient; while
this is consistent with the definition proposed by the researchers that developed the linkage
method,26 actual disease severity cannot be confirmed from the linkage data available. Finally,
participants in UK Biobank may not be representative of the wider population and testing in the UK
has not been universal, making analyses vulnerable to bias.
In conclusion, both shift and health work were associated with an increased risk of developing
severe COVID-19 independent of age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation and co-morbidities. The risk was
compounded more than three-fold further in health workers who work shifts, irrespective of sex or
ethnicity, compared to neither health nor shift worker. The impact of health and shift work tended
to be higher in minority ethnic groups, who are already at increased risk of severe COVID-19. The UK
Reach study (https://uk-reach.org/main/) will investigate how, and why, ethnicity affects COVID=19
outcomes in healthcare workers. Notably, the risk associated with health workers was no longer
apparent in people over retirement age, suggesting that the risk is likely explained by the exposure
to the virus inherent to the occupation. However, in shift workers, an elevated albeit attenuated risk
was still evident in people over retirement age, suggesting that the elevated risk associated with
shift work may not be fully explained by increased exposure to the virus. This is consistent with
previous reports of elevated risk of cardiovascular disease in former shift workers11 and further

supports that risk factors for cardiovascular and cardiometabolic disease are also risk factors for
COVID-19.13–15 Vaccination, therapeutic and prevention programmes are being prioritised for health
care workers. Our data suggests that shift workers should also be prioritised for these preventive
measures.
