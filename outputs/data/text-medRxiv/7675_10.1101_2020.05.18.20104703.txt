Abstract

32

The COVID-19 epidemic had spread rapidly through China and subsequently has proliferated

33

globally leading to a pandemic situation around the globe. Human-to-human transmissions,

34

as well as asymptomatic transmissions of the infection, have been confirmed. As of April 3rd,

35

public health crisis in China due to COVID-19 is potentially under control. We compiled a

36

daily dataset of case counts, mortality, recovery, temperature, population density, and

37

demographic information for each prefecture during the period of January 11 to April 07,

38

2020 (excluding Wuhan from our analysis due to missing data). Understanding the

39

characteristics of spatiotemporal clustering of the COVID-19 epidemic and R0 is critical in

40

effectively preventing and controlling the ongoing global pandemic. The prefectures were

41

grouped based on several relevant features using unsupervised machine learning

42

techniques. We performed a computational analysis utilizing the reported cases in China to

43

estimate the revised R0 among different regions for prevention planning in an ongoing global

44

pandemic. Finally, our results indicate that the impact of temperature and demographic

45

(different age group percentage compared to the total population) factors on virus

46

transmission may be characterized using a stochastic transmission model. Such predictions

47

will help prioritize segments of a given community/ region for action and provide a visual aid

48

in designing prevention strategies for a specific geographic region. Furthermore, revised

49

estimation and our methodology will aid in improving the human health consequences of

50

COVID-19 elsewhere.

INTRODUCTION

65

The world is facing an unprecedented pandemic of a virus (COVID-19) that originated in

66

Wuhan, China. As such, the virus has been declared a global public health emergency by the

67

World Health Organization (WHO). The virus is of the genus betacoronavirus which are

68

zoonotically transmitted enveloped RNA viruses (1). Certain strains of Coronavirus are known

69

to cause infections in humans and have led to previous epidemics, such as severe acute

70

respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (2). A new strain

71

of Coronavirus called the COVID-19 has led to a global epidemic since its emergence in

72

Wuhan, China (3). As of May 17, 2020, this disruptive pandemic has been spread among 180

73

countries and infected >4.6 million individuals and caused >0.31 million deaths since the onset

74

of the epidemic. Nearly 0.084 million cases were diagnosed in mainland China (4, 5). The

75

epidemic in China is now under control.

76
77

Initial efforts to stall transmission of the COVID-19 by the Chinese authorities included the

78

closure of the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market which was considered to be the focal point

79

of the outbreak (6). However, in spite of such strong intervention attempts, the rapid spread of

80

the virus could not be prevented. Apart from measures to prevent exposure to the source,

81

diagnostic recognition of the virus is an essential part of preventing efforts to prevent

82

transmission. Diagnostic tests for COVID-19 were developed after isolation of the virus from

83

lower respiratory tract specimens and blood serum (7). Scientists in China provided the genetic

84

sequence of COVID-19 to the WHO, which has in turn, made Real-Time Polymerase Chain

85

Reaction (RT-PCR) tests available globally.(7) COVID-19 has a clinically milder presentation

86

and lower case fatality ratio (CFR) when compared to SARS and MERS (8) and hence, there

87

seems to be an increased risk of asymptomatic or pre-clinically diagnosed individuals

88

spreading the disease (9).

89
90

With the current state of globalization and increased interconnectedness of the world, the risk

91

of infectious disease spread has increased. A revised estimation of R0 based on some potential

92

risk factors is one of the powerful tools for assessing an epidemic’s ability to spread (10, 11).

93

They provide vital information regarding where resources for containment and treatment

94

should be targeted. Additionally, the case definition of COVID-19 has been updated by the

95

Chinese authorities to now include those who present clinically with evidence of radiographic

96

changes on CT scans of the lungs. Infection rate and mortality are higher among male compare

97

with female (12). The mortality rate is higher among the older age groups (12). Population

98

density might be one of the potential risk factors in the spread of COVID-19 infections (13).

99

Control effort proved one of the keys to prevent and contain the spatial spread (14). The role

100

of temperature in the spread of COVID-19 has been studied (15-22) and debated among

101

policymakers.

102
103

A revised estimation based on the geographic distribution of population density, age group,

104

gender, temperature, morbidity, mortality, and recovery rate from COVID-19 on a contained

105

epidemic country is necessary in order to accurately predict the spatial spread of the virus and

106

identify the risk factors for targeted control. Our study models the spread of COVID-19 among

107

three regions in China, where the regions are not clustered geographically; rather they are

108

intelligently grouped or clustered based on several relevant features (mentioned above) through

109

application of unsupervised machine learning techniques. Thus, it will provide more accurate

110

findings regarding where public health measures should be targeted.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

133

Data Source

134

In this study, 31 provinces of Mainland China were taken into consideration, including 367

135

county-level administrative areas. The number of daily confirmed, cured, and death of

136

COVID-19 cases were collected from the National Health Commission of the People's

137

Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) and the provincial health commissions.

138
139

COVID-19 that started to spread from Wuhan in the mainland of China is a notifiable disease

140

(23). Local health professionals (responsible for investigation and exposure information

141

collection) tied to add the daily reported cases in China’s Infectious Disease Information

142

System (IDIS). IDIS system recorded all cases with identification numbers, to avoid data

143

duplication. All data contained information about morbidity, mortality, and recovery from

144

COVID-19 case records in the IDIS through the end of April 3, 2020, were extracted. IDIS

145

system categorized all the confirmed cases as suspected, clinically diagnosed (Hubei Province

146

only), or asymptomatic. Confirmed cases were diagnosed by testing the viral nucleic acid in

147

throat swabs specimens (some samples tested retrospectively) (23). Suspected cases were

148

diagnosed based on the clinical symptoms and exposure and were classified as clinically

149

diagnosed cases. Clinically diagnosed cases include suspicious cases with lung imaging

150

features consistent with coronavirus pneumonia. The positive viral nucleic acid test is used to

151

diagnose asymptomatic cases (without any COVID19 symptoms, e.g., fever, dry cough) (23).

152

The date of diagnosis, recovery, and mortality were used as an onset date of infection in the

153

time series data (23).

154
155

Population

156

Demographic data for each city were obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics of

157

China (http://www.stats.gov.cn/).

159

Temperature

160

The daily surface air temperature dataset from a joint project of National Centres for

161

Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)

162

is obtained at the prefecture-level of China. The NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis dataset is

163

continuously available (1948 - present) at the global gridded dataset of earth atmosphere,

164

incorporating the in-situ observations and numerical weather prediction (NWP) model output.

165

The temporal resolution is 6-hour (0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC) with a spatial resolution

166

of 2.5-degree.

167
168

Google earth engine platform was used to download the required data following a three-step

169

process: selection of required data, extraction to geographical location, and export to google

170

drive. Data selection parameters include, dataset identifier (NCEP_RE/surface_temp),

171

geographical location (China prefecture level), and date (2019-12-01 – 2020-04-07). To get the

172

temperature data for each prefecture, ee.Reducer.first() function is used to get the first (or only)

173

value of temperature. Finally, the extracted dataset is exported to the google drive as a CSV

174

file. The temperature dataset consists of four observations per day and is used to obtain

175

minimum, maximum, and mean temperatures.

177

Computational Analysis

178

We divided China into three different regions applying a carefully designed clustering exercise

179

as described below. The full analysis pipeline is illustrated in Figure 1 Supplement. Initially,

180

all the prefectures that reported zero cases were excluded from the analysis. Then we applied

181

an unsupervised clustering algorithm, namely, K-means algorithm, based on several features

182

(Table 1, Supplement) and identified three separate regions within mainland China. Now,

183

different sets of features (i.e., criteria used for clustering) may result in different outputs (i.e.,

184

different regional grouping). To analyse this, we applied our clustering algorithm on four

185

different sets of features/criteria that include incidence, recovery rate, mortality rate, male-

186

female ratio, age group ratio, minimum, mean and maximum temperature in each prefecture.

187

Table 1 lists the criteria/features used for clustering (further details are provided in Table 1,

188

Supplement). For visualization purposes, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been

189

performed to reduce the dimensions of the feature set to two dimensions (Figure 2 and 3,

190

supplement).

196

The K-means clustering algorithm (with default parameters) was used to do the clustering

197

(24)(25, 26). In our dataset, there are 302 prefectures with at least one incidence. However,

198

we have population and temperature data was available, for 298 and 296 prefectures,

199

respectively. That is why 298 prefectures were considered for clustering B. On the other

200

hand, 296 prefectures were considered for all other clusters. Notably, Wuhan was excluded

201

from the analysis, because data for early days of transmission for Wuhan is not available

202

(27).

203
204

After dividing all the prefectures into three different regions, a stochastic transmission

205

dynamic model to estimate R0 for each region was fit. The daily incidence, recovery, and

206

mortality of each region were fitted in the model. For estimating R0 of a region, we

207

considered the daily confirmed incidences for all the prefectures of that region. The same

208

procedure is applied for recovery and mortality.

209
210

We divided the population into three different compartments, namely, susceptible, infected

211

and removed (SIR model (28), i.e., isolated, recovered, dead, or otherwise no longer

212

infectious). The rate of change from susceptible to infected is termed as the rate of

213

transmission. Similarly, the rate of change from infected to removed is termed as the removal

214

rate. Following the work of Kucharski et al. (29), in our model, we have assumed that the

215

delay distribution from the onset to isolation follows the well-known Erlang distribution with

216

a mean of 2.9 days and a standard deviation of 2.1 days (30). So the removal rate is assumed

217

to be 0.34 (1/2.9) (31, 32). Transmission is modelled as a stochastic random walk process and

218

sequential Monte Carlo simulation is used to infer the transmission rate over time, resulting

219

number of cases, and the time varying basic reproduction number (Rt). Sequential Monte

220

Carlo (i.e., particle filter) simulation (29) is run 100 times with bootstrap fits. R0 is then

221

estimated by taking the median of the first 14 days of Rt. For fitting time series incidence,

222

mortality, and recovery data, we tried to maximize negative log-likelihood.

223
224

Model Validation

225

The primary validation of the model is done through visually inspecting the plot generated

226

using the model-inferred a number of cases and the actual cases. Then we calculated the Root

227

Mean Square Error (RMSE) values from the cumulative real and predicted incidences (Table

228

2, supplement). While calculating the RMSE value for a particular cluster (under a particular

229

clustering scheme), we compared the cumulative true number of cases against the predicted

230

one for each day.

231
232

All analysis was conducted using the R language (version 3.6.3). We adopted and modified

233

the code provided by Kucharski et al. (29). For reading and manipulating data we used

234

readxl, magrittr, tidyverse, tidyr,DMwr and plyr R packages in addition to pre-installed

235

packages. For processing dates we used R package lubridate. We leveraged R package

236

ggplot2, ggpubr, sf and RColorBrewer for plotting different figures including maps. R

237

package factoextra was used for visualizing PCA. For parallelization, we used for each,

238

doMC and mgcv. All data and code for simulation are available at the following link:

263

RESULTS

264

As of April 7, 2020, total cases reported in China were 83,845 (including Wuhan). The

265

average of daily mean temperature ranged from -25.0560 °C to 21.3948 °C.

266
267

Three regions in different clustering

268

All four clustering (Table 1) produced similar regions (Figure 1) and predicted similar R0

269

values (Table 2 & Figure 2). In particular, the prefectures are in fact geographically grouped

270

into regions automatically despite that, no direct geographical features have been used for

271

clustering (Table 1 & Supplement Table 1). From the PCA analysis (Figure 2 supplement), it

272

is evident that temperature profile played a significant role, and it is easily noticeable that the

273

increase in temperature increases the R0 value.

274
275

An interesting point can be noticed in Clustering D (Figure 1(d)) as follows. It exhibits two

276

light green (medium R0) prefectures (namely, Tangshan and Binzhou) in the eastern region,

277

which is otherwise assigned green (low R0) in other clustering. The fact that Clustering D

278

considers population profile in more detail than other clustering, has played a role here. As it

279

turns out, the ratio of aged population is markedly higher in these two prefectures which

280

essentially put these into the immediate higher R0 region. In the same context, we also notice

281

another apparently anomalous prefecture (i.e., Turfan) at the north-western region, which is

282

light green (medium R0) in Clustering D as opposed to being green (low R0) in other

283

clustering A and C. The analysis shows that the aged population group is not prominent in

284

Turfan; however, further analysis reveals that the sufficiently lower temperature therein has

285

played its part and overshadowed the effect of the aged population. Thus, it seems that we

286

can give higher rank to temperatures in terms of contribution towards transmission than

287

population age.

288
289

Regional Transmission Levels

290

Region 3 has been identified to be the highest transmission region (among the three)

291

according to all four clustering and the predicted R0 for all clustering remains at around 2.19

292

(2.18 ~ 2.24). The low (medium) transmission region is Region 1 (2). In both cases, the

293

predicted R0 for all clustering are quite similar, at around 1.62 (1.58 ~ 1.70) for Region 1 and

294

around 1.94 (1.90 ~ 1.99) for Region 2.

Notably, due to the stochastic property of the Monte Carlo simulation, we can safely assume

297

this range as acceptable (Figure 3).

DISCUSSION

331

This is the first study to determine the impact of temperature and other potential risk factors

332

through a clustering exercise and to estimate the revised R0 of COVID-19 in different regions

333

in China. We have applied the clustering algorithms using different combination of relevant

334

features to ensure a confident and coherent analysis. Our results strongly indicated that R0

335

may be affected (i.e., worsen) by higher temperature, and the prefectures having older

336

population likely favoured its transmission.

337
338

Clustering E is based on temperature profile only and it clearly suggested that higher

339

temperature produced higher R0. This is a unique finding in itself as the role of temperature in

340

the spread of COVID-19 has been studied (15-22) and the predominant prediction was mostly

341

the opposite; evidence from published studies documented negative associations between

342

increasing temperature and COVID-19 transmission (15, 17, 22).

343
344

Also, population turned out to be an important discriminant feature in clustering, and from

345

the results it can be inferred that higher fraction of aged population is a risk factor and

346

contributes to higher R0. While identifying region 3, temperature was the most contributing

347

factor following the demographic factor. Region 3 (exhibiting the highest R0) is the warm

348

region where average of the daily mean temperature is around 8.57 0 C whereas Region 1 and

349

Region 2 has this value below 00 C.

350
351

We estimated that the mean R0 for the COVID-19 ranges from 1.58 to 2.24 (Table 2) and is

352

significantly larger than 1 and is consistent with the WHO’s estimation for the human-to-

353

human (direct) transmission ranged from 1.4 to 2.5 (33). On the other hand, most of the

354

predicted mean R0 ranging from 2 to 5, and is largely inconsistent with our results (11). The

355

reason might be that active surveillance, contact tracing, quarantine, and early strong social

356

distancing efforts contributed to stop transmission of the virus and significantly decreased the

357

effective reproduction number of COVID-19 in China (10). Published studies also suggest

358

that the first lockdown resulted in a 65% decrease of the reproduction factor R0 and the

359

second, stricter wave of measures eventually managed to bring it to close to 0 (34).

360
361

Several factors can influence COVID-19 transmission, including environmental variables,

362

population density, and strong public health infrastructures (35). The previous studies have

363

364

scale. However, the association between COVID-19 and temperature was not consistent and

365

changes in temperature showed no significant correlation with cases transmitted, deaths or

366

recovered (16). Our findings at the prefecture level on the impact of temperature conditions

367

over the transmission of COVID-19 are not consistent with other published studies (35, 36).

368

However, our results are consistent with Luo et al., 2020 (37), which reported that the

369

changes in temperature as spring and summer months might not lead to decline of confirmed

370

case counts without the implementation of extensive public health interventions.

371
372

The longer the study period, the more stable the model results are expected to be.

373

Temperature may even have no role in transmission since winter is over and temperature

374

started increasing and cases are increasing in warm areas. Control effort, health behavior,

375

social distance has a very big role in R0 estimation and can inform public health officials and

376

decision makers about where to improve the allocation of resources, testing sites; also, where

377

to implement stricter quarantines and travel bans (38).

378
379

The most important environmental implication proved temperature is a critical factor for

380

COVID-19 transmission, which also deserve to be better studied in other regions during this

381

pandemic (17).

382
383

This study has several limitations, most notably the fact that these analyses were based on

384

routinely collected data during pandemic with the potential for both over and under reporting

385

of COVID-19 cases. Secular changes in reporting could have biased incidence estimates and

386

errors could have been introduced as data were aggregated at higher levels of the health

387

information system. Data accuracy and completeness were not systematically assessed. Some

388

cases might be detected based on clinical signs and symptoms, with the potential for

389

misclassification (39). Testing systems have also limited sensitivity and specificity and are

390

particularly likely to misclassify individuals. Parts of China were forced to shut down with

391

restrictions on the population movement. These intervention measures are expected to also

392

have an important impact on the associations between meteorological factors and the

393

transmission of the virus. Additional climatic factors, socio-economic development,

394

population mobility, population immunity, social distancing, health behavior changes, and

395

urbanization, presumably affected the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, but we

396

cannot consider every factor in this study. The observed associations between temperature,

397

demographic factors and estimated Ro were ecologic and not at the level of individuals.

Conclusion

399

In conclusions, our study does not support that high temperature can reduce the transmission

400

of COVID-19 and it will be premature to count on warmer weather to control COVID-19

401

(20). A weather with high temperature favors the transmission (17). There were spatial

402

heterogeneities in COVID-19 occurrence, which could be attributed to temperature. The

403

reasons for the inconsistency in the impact of meteorological factors on COVID-19 among

404

prefectures need further study. This research provides a novel methodology for the global

405

health authorities. As high temperature is associated with the transmissibility of COVID-19,

406

new policies to reinforce health systems or social isolation methods can be adopted,

407

depending on temperature.

Table 1 (Supplement): List of criteria used by the clustering algorithm

Criteria/Feature

Comments

Incidence (I)

‘I’ is a weak indicator if the incidence is high (Eqn. 1).

Recovery Rate (RR)

High ‘RR’ is an indicator of strong health infrastructures (Eqn. 2).

Mortality Rate (MR)

High ‘MR’ is a very weak indicator (Eqn. 3).

Male/Female Ratio

MFR is a significant number of the more male population compared with

(MFR)

the female population. If there is a more male population in the prefecture,
that will be considered as high risk.

Age Group Ratio

If any prefecture has a significant number of an older population group,

(AGR)

that prefecture should be considered as high risk; AGR has been
computed for three groups, namely, AGR<15 (age below 15), AGR15-64,
(age within the range 15-64) and AGR>64 (age over 64).

Temperature (T)

Temperature is speculated to have some effect on transmission. Here,
minimum (Tmin), mean (Tavg), maximum (Tmax) of daily temperatures have
been used.
