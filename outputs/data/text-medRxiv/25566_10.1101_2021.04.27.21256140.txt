Abstract
We assessed the relationship between municipality COVID-19 case rates and SARS-CoV-2

48

concentrations in the primary sludge of corresponding wastewater treatment facilities. Over

49

1,000 daily primary sludge samples were collected from six wastewater treatment facilities with

50

catchments serving 18 cities and towns in the State of Connecticut, USA. Samples were analyzed

51

for SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations during a six-month time period that overlapped with fall

52

2020 and winter 2021 COVID-19 outbreaks in each municipality. We fit a single regression

53

model to estimate reported case rates in the six municipalities from SARS-CoV-2 RNA

54

concentrations collected daily from corresponding wastewater treatment facilities. Results

55

demonstrate the ability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in primary sludge to estimate

56

COVID-19 reported case rates across treatment facilities and wastewater catchments, with

57

coverage probabilities ranging from 0.94 to 0.96. Leave-one-out cross validation suggests that

58

the model can be broadly applied to wastewater catchments that range in more than one order of

59

magnitude in population served. Estimation of case rates from wastewater data can be useful in

60

locations with limited testing availability or testing disparities, or delays in individual COVID-19

61

testing programs.

Introduction
Wastewater surveillance has the potential to identify and track outbreaks of human pathogens

71

that demonstrate gut tropism, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-

72

CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19.1 Recent studies demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 RNA

73

concentrations in domestic wastewater reflect the rise and fall of COVID-19 cases based on daily

74

positive tests in a community,2-4 and important epidemiological parameters such as the effective

75

reproduction number can be estimated using wastewater SARS-CoV-2 concentrations, in

76

addition to other epidemic indicators.5 If SARS-CoV-2 wastewater results are rapidly reported,

77

they could provide a leading indicator of community infection rates over COVID-19 case rates

78

and hospital admissions data.5-7

79

Estimates of infection based on COVID-19 case rates from testing of human specimens have

80

been the standard for applying community interventions aimed at decreasing morbidity and

81

mortality. Alternative approaches to COVID-19 testing are necessary to estimate the number of

82

infections in locations with disparities in testing practices8, limited testing resources,9 or during

83

outbreaks when testing capacity cannot meet demand. SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration

84

measurements in wastewater may resolve these issues, but quantitative relationships between

85

SARS-CoV-2 concentration in wastewater and infection (or proxies of infection such as cases)

86

are not well-resolved.

87

The following manuscript reports 192 days of monitoring daily primary sludge for SARS-

88

CoV-2 concentrations across six different U.S. wastewater treatment facilities ranging in over

89

one order of magnitude in flow rate, serving 18 municipalities and approximately 1 million

90

residents in the State of Connecticut, USA. Regression models were evaluated to estimate

Materials and Methods
Wastewater sampling. Primary sewage sludge samples of 40 to 45 ml in volume were

96

collected daily from six wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in the State of Connecticut, USA.

97

Table 1 lists the cities and towns served, and details the specific plant processes from which

98

primary sludge was produced and samples were withdrawn. Grab samples from Stamford,

99

Bridgeport, New Haven and New London were collected daily from August 3, 2020 to February

100

10, 2021. Samples from Hartford were collected daily from August 10, 2020 to February 10,

101

2021. Samples from Norwich were collected daily from August 17, 2020 to February 10, 2021.

102

All samples were collected between 8 am and 9 am, stored at -20° C before being transported to

103

Yale University laboratories on ice, and analyzed immediately upon arrival.

104

SARS-CoV-2 RNA primary sludge concentrations. To quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA

105

concentrations, the 40 to 45 ml sample was mixed on a vortexer for 1 minute and 0.5 ml of

106

primary sludge was added to a commercial extraction kit optimized for the isolation of total

107

RNA from raw wastewater (Zymo, Quick-RNA Fecal/Soil Microbe Microprep, wastewater

108

protocol). Modifications to the extraction protocol included the addition of 0.1 ml of

109

phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) in the initial bead beating step and eluting isolated

110

RNA into 50 µl of ribonuclease-free water. Before September 20, 2020 and prior to the rapid rise

111

in case rates in early October, primary sludge RNA extraction was accomplished using the

112

RNeasy PowerSoil Total RNA kit (Qiagen) as previously described.6 For all RNA extracts, total

113

RNA was measured by spectrophotometry and normalized to 200 ng µL-1 (NanoDrop, Thermo

N1 and N2 primer sets.10, 11 CrAssphage, a ubiquitous bacteriophage that is highly concentrated

118

119

reactions. Analysis was conducted using a one-step RT-qPCR kit (BioRad iTaq™ Universal

120

Probes One-Step Kit). Triplicate 20 µL reactions using a 5x diluted template were run at 55° C

121

for 10 min and 95° C for 1 min, followed by 40 cycles consisting of 95°C for 10 seconds and 55°

122

C for 30 seconds6 and Ct values for triplicates were average. N1 and N2 primer set standards

123

were constructed using ten-fold dilutions (5 × 101 to 5 × 108 copies per reaction) of the N gene

124

transcripts for the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 strain. Concentrations in primary sludge samples

125

were calculated using these standard curves and are presented as SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies per

126

ng of total extracted RNA. Positive RNA and negative (no template) controls were included in

127

all qRT-PCR runs. Less than 1.5% of samples were not available from the treatment facilities. In

128

these cases, SARS-CoV-2 concentrations used in regression models were estimated by

129

interpolating between the prior and subsequent measured SARS-CoV-2 concentration.

134

as test specimen collection date (if available), symptom onset date (if available), or date of report

135

160

A weighted least squares approach was used to weight (by reciprocal of the variance) case rate

other wastewater catchments. Six regression models, similar to Equation 1, with the exception

172

coinciding with the start of the fall 2020 outbreaks for the corresponding cities.

184

Model selection and validation. This study estimated COVID-19 case rates using the

185

regression model presented in equation 1 which included lagged SARS-CoV-2 RNA wastewater

186

concentrations, municipality, and day of the week as variables. An initial analysis was conducted

187

to determine the maximum number of prior days of wastewater RNA concentrations (𝑅𝑁𝐴(,*72 ,

188

lagged days) to use. Table 2 presents Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information

189

Criterion (BIC), F statistics with p values, and coverage probabilities for maximum lags ranging

190

from 0 to 6 days and indicates optimal model fit with minimized model complexity when using

191

lagged RNA concentrations from 0 to 4 days. Graphical comparisons of measured reported case

192

rates versus model-estimated case rates are provided in Figure 2 for each WWTP using models

193

with lagged RNA concentrations from 0 to 4 days. When applied to the six individual

194

municipalities, resulting coverage probabilities range was 0.93 to 0.96, with a root mean standard

195

error of 13.1 cases per 100,000 population for the entire model (see Figure S1 for model

196

confidence intervals). Tables S1-7 provide regression coefficients, intercepts, and their

197

significance for the general linear models in Equation 1. Regression coefficients were typically

198

greatest at lags 0 and 1 day.

199

Results of the leave-one-out cross validation analysis revealed coverage probabilities (95%

200

prediction intervals) of the estimated case rates that ranged from 0.90 to 0.98 for the six different

201

municipalities considered, suggesting that the model can provide estimates of measured cases

202

from sludge SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations for a variety of wastewater catchments that

203

contain treatment facilities that produce primary sludge (Table 3).

Discussion
Estimating the number of infections directly from wastewater pathogen concentrations is a

207

central goal of wastewater surveillance practice. The gut tropism of coronaviruses and

208

widespread COVID-19 testing provide a unique opportunity to develop these tools. We

209

monitored daily SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in the primary sludge of six wastewater

210

treatment plants that covered 18 U.S. municipalities and explored regression analyses to estimate

211

COVID-19 cases rates on the day of specimen collection. Our results demonstrate the feasibility,

212

utility, and simplicity of estimating COVID-19 case rates across a variety of different wastewater

213

treatment catchments.

214

Prior studies have noted a concordance in wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations with

215

other indicators of infection. Early work in the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak observed similar

216

behavior between reported daily positive COVID-19 testing results in a community and the

217

SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in that community’s wastewater, 17 and relationships between

218

wastewater RNA concentrations and COVID-19 reported cases have been reported for SARS-

219

CoV-2 and polio virus. 2, 7, 18, 19 Several features of this study are unique to these prior studies

220

and mark advances in the science underpinning wastewater-based epidemiology. We estimate

221

COVID-19 case rates solely from current and prior days of primary sludge RNA concentrations

222

and day of the week across treatment plants that range in more than one order of magnitude in

223

size as measured by average flow rate and population served. Inclusion of concentration data

224

from prior days yielded a model that can accounts for the previously observed offsets 6, 7, 18

225

between wastewater RNA concentrations and reported case data. The regression model used

226

revealed that concentration lags of 0 to 1 day best predict case rates and confirms the previously

227

described 0 to 2 day lag between case rates by date of specimen collection and SARS-CoV-2

228

concentrations in primary sludge6. A single general regression model trained by pooled plant

229

data in a leave-one-out analysis was able to accurately estimate case rates for communities

230

served by different domestic treatment plants, suggesting that this model could be extended more

231

broadly to a variety of communities. In this case, treatment plants produced sludge using

232

different primary treatment schemes and served populations that varied by more than an order of

233

magnitude in size (Table 1). The approach for utilizing primary sludge instead of raw

234

wastewater allows for rapid sampling of a mixed influent stream without the use of specialized

235

sampling equipment. The concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater solids is greater than that

236

in raw wastewater3 and negates the need for concentration steps often required when using

237

untreated wastewater. The 0.5 ml sample volume considered in this study should enable

238

automation of RNA extraction. SARS-CoV-2 concentrations are likely not impacted by

239

precipitation events (infiltration and inflow) that might dilute concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in

240

the aqueous phase of raw wastewater.

241

The ability to estimate case rates from etiological agent concentrations in wastewater can be

242

of significant epidemiological value. Case rates are a commonly used as a proxy for changes in

243

community infection, and have been used as the standard for implementing non-pharmaceutical

244

interventions and policies to reduce COVID-19 transmission and associated hospitalizations and

245

deaths. In jurisdictions where testing is limited or does not exist, these models can be used as an

246

independent estimate of infection rates. Wastewater RNA concentrations can be reported the

247

same day the sample is collected, thus the statistical models used herein can be utilized to

248

estimate up-to-date reported case rates in a community when COVID-19 testing data lags.

249
250

Limitations. This modeling approach relies on statistical relationships between wastewater
primary sludge RNA concentrations and COVID-19 case rates, which are primarily based on

251

diagnostic test results. The reported prediction intervals reflect the variability in these reported

252

case rates. While commonly used as a proxy, reported cases are believed to underestimate

253

infection due to asymptomatic COVID-19 infections.20 Clinical testing volumes in the

254

municipalities considered were dynamic over the study period; responding to events such as

255

school openings, holidays, and shifting of resources to locations with increasing case rates. The

256

measured RNA concentrations in wastewater are not subject to such variation in testing policy

257

and should therefore exhibit a more direct relationship to the unobservable changes in SARS-

258

CoV-2 infection in the community. While clinical testing data is considered an imperfect

259

measure of infection, even in locations with strong testing programs, we note that the data

260

resulting from testing programs has been indispensable in understanding the progression of

261

outbreaks and initiating action to stem the spread of COVID-19 throughout the world. That case

262

results can be estimated from SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in sewage sludge provides an added

263

measure of confidence in the use of reported cases to monitor the epidemic.

264

Summary. Measuring the concentration of pathogens in domestic wastewater can be a useful

265

indicator of infection trends within a population. This study demonstrated that a single regression

266

model populated by daily lagged SARS-CoV-2 sewage sludge concentrations could estimate

267

COVID-19 case rates across communities served by six different wastewater treatment facilities.

268

Cross-validation by leave-out analysis suggests the regression model can provide estimates of

269

COVID-19 case rates for a broad variety of treatment facilities that produce primary sludge.

270

Estimating case rates from wastewater pathogen concentrations can be useful in locations with

271

limited or delayed COVID-19 testing programs or for infectious diseases where individual

272

testing programs are not well-developed.
