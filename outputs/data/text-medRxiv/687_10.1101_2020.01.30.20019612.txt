Abstract
The pandemic potential of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) that emerged in Wuhan, China,
during December 2019 is strongly tied to the number and contagiousness of
undocumented human infections. Here we present findings from a proactive longitudinal
sampling study of acute viral respiratory infections that documents rates of
asymptomatic infection and clinical care seeking for seasonal coronavirus. We find that
the majority of infections are asymptomatic by most symptom definitions and that only
4% of individuals experiencing a seasonal coronavirus infection episode sought medical
care for their symptoms. These numbers indicate that a very high percentage of
seasonal coronavirus infections are undocumented and provide a reference for
understanding the spread of the emergent nCoV.
Background
The Wuhan novel coronavirus (nCoV) appears to have emerged in humans in the Hubei
province of China during December 2019 (1). The virus was definitively identified in the
first week of 2020 and as of January 29 had spread to 15 other countries; 6065
confirmed cases, 9239 suspected cases, and 132 deaths have been reported (2);
however, the total number of infections (confirmed, suspected and unreported) remains
unknown.
Quantification of the reporting rate, i.e. the ratio of confirmed and suspected cases to
total infections, is vital for delineation of the prevalence, scope and potential spread of
nCoV. Indeed, the speed and geographic extent of its translocation throughout China
and internationally are likely tied to the true prevalence of the pathogen and suggest
that there are many more infections (i.e. the reporting rate is low), that contagiousness
is not negligible among these undetected infected persons, and that nCoV will be
difficult to contain. To contextualize the issue of unreported infection, we here present
the findings from a recent proactive sampling project carried out in New York City (NYC)
that documented rates of asymptomatic infection and clinical care-seeking among
individuals shedding seasonal CoV (types: HKU1, 229E, NL63 and OC43).
Methods
Data are derived from sampling performed between October 2016 and April 2018 as
part of the Virome project, a proactive sampling of respiratory virus infection rates,
associated symptom reports and rates of seeking clinical care. We enrolled 214 healthy

individuals from multiple locations in the Manhattan borough of NYC. Cohort
composition is described in Galanti et al. (3,4) and includes: children attending two
daycares, along with their siblings and parents; teenagers and teachers from a high
school; adults working at two emergency departments (a pediatric and an adult
hospital); and adults working at a university medical center. The cohort was obtained
using convenience sampling, and all participants were younger than 65 years. While the
study period spanned two years from October 2016 to April 2018, some individuals
enrolled for a single cold and flu season (October – April) and others for the entire study
period. Participants (or their guardians, if minors) provided informed consent after
reading a detailed description of the study (CUMC IRB AAAQ4358).
Nasopharyngeal samples were collected by study coordinators once a week
irrespective of participant symptoms. Samples were screened using the GenMark
eSensor RVP system for 18 different respiratory viruses, including coronavirus 229E,
NL63, OC43, and HKU1. Sample collection and extraction followed the same protocol
as in Shaman et al. (5).
In addition, participants completed daily self-reports rating nine respiratory illnessrelated symptoms (fever, chills, muscle pain, watery eyes, runny nose, sneezing, sore
throat, cough, chest pain) each of which was recorded on a Likert scale (0=none,
1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). The daily self-report also documented whether
participants had sought medical attention, stayed home or taken cold and flu-related
medications (both over-the-counter and prescription) as a consequence of their listed
symptoms (see (4) for further survey details).

We defined an infection (or viral) episode as a group of consecutive weekly specimens
from a given individual that were positive for the same virus (allowing for a one-week
gap to account for false negatives and temporary low shedding). Medically attended
illness, sick days at home and medicine uptake were defined as episodes in which the
participants reported seeking care, staying home or taking medicines due to respiratory
symptoms. We classified all infection episodes as symptomatic or asymptomatic
according to individual symptom scores in the days surrounding the date of the first
positive swab of an episode. We used multiple definitions as a standard for symptomatic
infection does not exist (Table 1). These symptom definitions are described in reference

to a -3 to +7-day window around the date of the initial positive swab for an infection
episode. Daily score is defined as the sum of the 9 individual symptoms (range: 0-27).
Total symptom score is the daily symptom score summed over the -3 to +7-day window.
Results
Table 2 presents the findings for seasonal CoV from this proactive sampling effort. 135
CoV infection episodes were identified. CoV-OC43 infection was most frequent (n=61),
and CoV-NL63 infection was least frequent (n=15). Note that co-infections occurred;
hence, the sum of the type infections is greater than the total reported in the final
column of Table 2. Adults (20+ years old) constituted 64% of the cohort, provided 67%
of collected swab specimens, and experienced 50% of all CoV infection episodes.
Based on Definitions 1-4, the majority of CoV infection episodes were asymptomatic.
When stratified by type, differences emerge: CoV-NL63 was more than twice as likely to
produce symptomatic infection episodes as CoV-229E (by Definitions 1-4). Definition 5,
which defines symptomatic infection as the manifestation of any symptom during the 11day window spanning the initial positive swab collection, indicates that a majority of
infected persons reported at least one mild cold-related symptom.
Participants reported taking medicine in response to cold and flu symptoms for 26%
(n=35) of CoV infection episodes. Participants were three times more likely to take
medicine in association with CoV-NL63 infection (40%) than CoV-229E infection (12%).
10% of participants reported staying home from work or school during CoV infection
episodes, and 4% of participants reported seeking medical care.

Discussion
Reporting of seasonal CoV prevalence has been limited to date. The US CDC only
began releasing CoV positivity rates in 2018, and understanding of its epidemiological
features is incomplete. Here, we present direct measurement of rates of seeking clinical
care and show that only 4% (6 of 135) of persons shedding seasonal CoV sought care.
Reporting rates and rates of seeking medical care may differ, as most individuals
visiting a clinician for acute respiratory illness are not tested for seasonal CoV.
However, testing for the 2019 nCoV is expected to be more robust than for seasonal
CoV as there is pressing need to understand and contain this novel pathogen. This high
testing rate could result in the reporting rate for nCoV equaling the rate of seeking
medical care. Thus, if rates of seeking medical care for nCoV were to align with
seasonal CoV, the reporting rate for nCoV would approach 4%. Should the remaining
96% of unreported infections be sufficiently contagious, their high numbers could
support rapid spread of nCoV.
It is important to note that rates of seeking medical care for nCoV may not align with the
rates found here for seasonal CoV: concern over the virus may lead to elevated rates of
seeking medical care; our estimates for seasonal CoV represent a moderate sample
size; and the symptom severity of emergent Wuhan nCoV may differ from seasonal
CoV. Further, early outbreak instances of death due to nCoV occurred predominantly in
elderly patients, and often elderly with co-morbidities (6). The data we present here for
seasonal CoV are from a cohort with no individuals 65 year or older, so the findings
identified here might not have bearing on the elderly.
Still, several recent studies suggest that reporting rates for nCoV may align with the
rates found here for seasonal CoV. Chinazzi et al., (7) used an agent-based modeling
approach to estimate the overall nCoV incidence (reported and unreported) necessary
to support the observed numbers of geographically exported infected individuals as of
January 21, 2020. They estimated a 5-16% nCoV reporting rate depending on model
assumptions. In addition, phylogenetic analysis has identified Wuhan nCoV as a
betacoronavirus, the genus that includes CoV-OC43 and CoV-HKU1, as well as CoVSARS and CoV-MERS (8). Among our cohort participants, 7% (6 of 91) of infection
episodes with seasonal betacoronavirus (OC43 and HKU1) sought medical care.

The impact of unrecognized and unattended infections on transmission dynamics is
likely a key determinant of whether control of the nCoV outbreak is possible. For
example, although cases of seroconversion without sign of disease were documented
during the SARS outbreak, asymptomatic and subclinical rates are believed to have
been low. No cases of asymptomatic SARS transmission were documented (9), which
may have facilitated the containment of the epidemic.
A higher asymptomatic ratio was reported for MERS infections, which presented with a
broader spectrum of clinical manifestations: 21% of laboratory identified cases were
mild or asymptomatic and 48% had severe disease or died (10). The potential for
asymptomatic transmission of MERS has been reported (11); however, the majority of
transmission events happened within hospital or household, suggesting that close
proximity may have facilitated transmission.
nCoV has spread rapidly in a short time, which suggests a substantial number of
unreported infections exist. The results presented here provide a unique direct measure
of seasonal CoV infection, symptom severity, and rates of seeking medical care. These
findings provide a baseline reference for contextualizing nCoV pandemic potential.
