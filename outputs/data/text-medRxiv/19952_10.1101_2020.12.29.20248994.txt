Abstract:
Introduction: COVID 19 is still a challenge in pediatrics due to variety of symptoms and different
presentations
Aim: To describe clinical, laboratorial and treatment of confirmed COVID-19 pediatric admitted in
hospitals.
Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in children (0-18 years), admitted between March and
November 15, 2020, with confirmed COVID-19 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or
serological tests. Clinical data about symptoms, laboratorial exams and treatments were analysed. Patients
were evaluated according predominant (PRS) or non-predominant respiratory symptoms (non-PRS)
Results: Sixty-four patients were evaluated, being the median age 5.6 years. Forty-seven (73.4%) children
were admitted with PRS and 17 (26.4%) with non-PRS. The main symptoms in the PRS group were fever
in 74.5% of children and cough in 66%; and fever in 76.5% and edema/cavitary effusion in 29.4% in the
non-PRS group. The median of C-reactive protein (in mg/dl) was 2.5 in the PRS group and 6.1 in the nonPRS group. Antibiotics were used in 85.1% of the PRS group and 94.1% of non-group. Comorbidity was
present in 30/47 (63.8%) of PRS group and 8/17 (47.1%) of non-PRS group (p=0.22). Length of stay until
7 days in patients with comorbidity was present in 27/64 (42.1%) and more than 7 days in 11/64 (17.1%)
(p= 0.2)
Conclusion: Non-PRS represented more than one quarter of admitted patients. Fever was the main
symptom detected, elevated CRP was frequent and antibiotics were commonly prescribed. Comorbidity
was found in both groups and his presence was not associated with a longer length of stay.

Introduction:
A cluster of pneumonia of unknown origin was described initially in late December 2019 in Wuhan,
China and linked to a seafood wholesale Market 1,2. Just a few days later, on January 07 2020, a novel
Coronavirus was identified as the causative agent and the disease experienced a rapid spread from Wuhan
to the whole China in 30 days 1,3. The disease caused by SARS-COV-2 was named COVID 19 and during
the first two months of 2020 affected at least 57 countries showing his pandemic potential 4. On 11th March,
the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic situation due to SARS-COV-2 5.
The initial reports of COVID-19 showed that disease affected more patients between 30 and 79
years, with mild cases in 81% and case fatality of 2.3% 3. In this same report, children and adolescents
represented 2% of all patients diagnosed 3.
Children often have milder disease than adults and deaths have been extremely rare, although
atypical manifestations as multisystem inflammatory disease, Kawasaki disease and Kawasaki-like disease
have been reported 6-9. Newborns also have developed symptomatic COVID-19, but until the present, there
is limited evidence of vertical intrauterine transmission 10.
Brazil is one of the most affected countries by the current pandemic. Data from Brazilian Ministry
of Health reported more than 7,5 million cases and 191,570 deaths until December 28, 2020 11. Despite the
amount of cases, just a few reports of the behaviour of disease in Brazil were reported as case reports or
children admitted to paediatric intensive care units and in pediatric hospitals 12-15.
Considering the relevance of SARS-COV-2 in Brazilian children, our aim is to describe the clinical,
laboratorial and treatment of confirmed COVID-19 pediatric patients in Rio de Janeiro, city, Brazil.

Methods:
Type of study:
We conducted a retrospective descriptive study of pediatric patients, admitted with confirmed
infection due to SARS-COV-2
Setting
The study was done in two pediatric private hospitals from Rio de Janeiro, city. Both hospitals
attend patients from 0 to 18 years old age and count with 24h-emergency service, wards, pediatric intensive
care units and all pediatric specialists for support. Hospital 1 is located in the North Zone of the city and
has 135 bed capacity. Hospital 2 is located in the South Zone and has 45 bed capacity. Many of the
admissions are referred from peripheral hospitals from the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro state.
Inclusion criteria
All patients admitted between March and November 2020, with clinical signals and symptoms
suggestive of COVID-19 in the presence of positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) (Allplex TM, Seegene Brazil) or positive serological tests (IgM, IgG or IgA).
Exclusion criteria
Patients admitted with clinical signals and symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 with indeterminate
values of RT-PCR or serological tests or attending in the emergency department and discharged.
Definition of clinical signals and symptoms suggestive of COVID19
The following criteria were considered as suggestive: A) Acute onset of fever AND cough OR
Acute onset of ANY THREE OR MORE of the following signs or symptoms: Fever, cough, general

altered mental status AND Epidemiological criteria. B) A patient with severe acute respiratory illness
(SARI: acute respiratory infection with history of fever or measured fever of ≥ 38 C°; and cough; with onset
within the last 10 days; and requires hospitalization) 16. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome was defined
also according to WHO criteria 17.
Data collection:
Initially data of suspected cases were collected from Brazilian database system of electronic
notification of COVID-19 (notifica.saude.gov.br). After this, all patients files were recorded in order to
analyse additional signals and symptoms not included in the electronic notification as well treatments and
complementary exams performed.

Analysis of data
Patients were categorized in two groups according the main symptoms at admission: predominant
respiratory symptoms and non-predominant respiratory sumptoms. Categorical variables were described as
percentages and frequencies. Continuous variables were described as medians. Comparisons between
groups were made using the chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables, and the MannWhitney test for continuous variables. Shapiro-Wilk test was used to analyze the normality of the sample.
A p value less than 5% was considered as statistically significant.

Ethical aspects
The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Federal Fluminense University, process
number 4.100.232, June 20, 2020.

Results:
The first COVID19 case started the symptoms on March 25, 2020 and during the following nine
months (until November 15, 2020), 74 patients were confirmed with the infection. Of all confirmed patients,
64/74 (86.5%) were admitted and 10/74 (13.5%) were referred to ambulatory follow-up and the mean age
of patients (in months) was 79,4. Of 64 admitted patients, 5 (7.8%) developed symptoms of COVID19 after
admission for other reasons. The median age was 67 months (5.6 years) and other demographic data of
patients are shown in table 1.

The main abnormalities founded in chest radiology were: infiltrates in 12/18 (66.7%) patients and opacities
in 4/18 (22.2%); and the main findings in computed tomography of chest were ground-glass opacities in
9/16 (56.2%) children, opacities in 6/16 (37.5%) and pleural effusion in 1/16 (6.3%).
The p values of leukocytes and C-Reactive Protein didn’t show difference between both groups (0.79 and
0.48), respectively.
We also analysed presence of comorbidity in patients admitted with respiratory and non-predominant
respiratory symptoms and influence of comorbidity in length of stay (table 4 and 5)

Discussion:
After almost one year of COVID19, the world experienced difficulty to contain the spread
of disease and cases are still in progress in most countries, most of them in children. Considering
that Brazil is one of top leader countries in cases and deaths, despite children being less affected,
knowledge about clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiological findings as well treatments
are necessary in order to better understand and improve management of this population.
In our series, cases were equally distributed among different age groups of children with a
median age of 5,5 years. It’s important to note that during the whole study period, schools remained
closed in Rio de Janeiro city. In terms of age distribution of COVID19 positive pediatric patients,
studies evaluated children in different settings. For example, Kanthimathinathan and cols
evaluated children admitted in a single hospital of UK, with severe acute respiratory syndrome
founding a median age of 3,5 years, while Rahba et al, studying 115 children attending in
emergency room and admitted in a single hospital of São Paulo, Brazil found a median age of 2
years 15,18.
The cases described in this article reflected the first wave of COVID 19 in Rio de Janeiro,
city where most patients admitted benning the symptoms between epidemiological week 17 and
21 (April 14 and May 23, 2020).
Due to the broad spectrum of symptoms in children studied, we analysed patients in two
different categories: with predominant and non-predominant respiratory symptoms at admission.
The subgroup of non-predominant respiratory symptoms represented more than one quarter of
admitted patients that was compatible with a case series described by Rahba in Brazil that found
34% of gastrointestinal symptoms, but higher than reported by Zheng et al in 10 hospitals of Hubei,
China where prevalence of diarreia was 12% and by Korkmaz in Turkey where vomiting and
diarrhea were present in 7 % of admitted patients 15,19,20.
Considering patients with predominant respiratory symptoms the triad of fever, cough and
dyspnea were present in more than two third of all patients. Interestingly in this group, abnormal
radiological findings were present in less than 40% of patients and in many of them chest ray was
not necessary, considering the favorable outcome of these patients. Computed tomography of chest
was performed in less than half of patients, but the main findings as ground-glass opacities and
infiltrates were similar to a large review conducted by Kumar and cols 21.
Inflammatory markers are usually described as normal or elevated in infection due to
SARS-COV-2, depending on the ward of admission. In patients with non-multisystemic
inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) admitted in pediatric intensive care units in Brazil,
median of leukocytes (per 1000/L) was 11,850 while in patients admitted with MIS-C was 18,275
12
. The values found in Spanish children also admitted in PICU was 9260 22. Considering that our
cases included patients admitted both in wards as in PICUs the values found were lower than
reported by these authors. C-reactive protein with value > 10 mg/L was described in 68% of
children admitted in a UK pediatric hospital while the median of CRP in Turkey patients were 2
mg/L18,20. Our median of CRP was also elevated, mainly in patients with non-predominant
respiratory symptoms but without statistical significance when compared with patients with
predominant respiratory symptoms.
One of the great concerns about pediatric patients is to recognize if comorbidity could
influence different clinical presentations at admission or increase the length of stay. In our study,

comorbidity was not a variable that influenced in favour of respiratory or non-predominant
respiratory symptoms as well in length of stay higher than 7 days. Although the study was
conducted in two pediatric centers it’s possible that our findings could be confirmed in a large
series of cases from different institutions.
Until November 2020, there was no specific antiviral approved for COVID treatment in
children patients, but some drugs such as Remdesevir or Lopinavir/Ritonavir are employed in
specific settings 23, 24. Despite there is no gold standard for COVID 19 treatment in children, overall
treatment improved since the beginning of pandemics being some therapies incorporated to
therapeutics mainly for critical ill patients in pediatric intensive care units with MIS-C 25. In our
series almost all patients received antibiotics at admission probably due to difficulty of differential
diagnosis with bacterial infections. The only antiviral used was oseltamivir that was indicated in
cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome due to influenza virus suspicion.
Another important question about management of our patients, was the few availability of
RT-PCR tests and the high amount of them to be processed in the laboratory, during the initial
months of pandemic. But even with this limitation all admitted patients were tested to COVID-19
with RT-PCR or serology in cases of patients with more than 10 days of symptoms.
Despite the study being conducted in two large pediatric hospitals of Rio de Janeiro city
that could be considered a limitation, results could represent a representative panel of metropolitan
areas of state, due to many patients being referred to admission from periferic hospitals. Another
limitation was evaluation of only admitted patients that excluded children managed in ambulatory
settings with mild disease.

Conclusion:
Non-predominant respiratory symptoms represented more than one quarter of admitted
pediatric patients admitted. Comorbidity was common equally found in patients with predominant
or non-predominant respiratory symptoms and his presence was not associated with a higher length
of stay. Fever was the main symptom detected, elevated CRP was present and antibiotics were
commonly prescribed.
