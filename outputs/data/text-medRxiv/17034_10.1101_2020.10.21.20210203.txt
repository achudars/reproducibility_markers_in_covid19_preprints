Abstract
Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pneumonia is often associated with
hyperinflammation. Safety and efficacy of the anti–interleukin-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab
was evaluated in patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia.
Methods: Nonventilated patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia were randomized (2:1)
to tocilizumab (8 mg/kg intravenous) or placebo plus standard care. Sites enrolling high-risk and
minority populations were emphasized. The primary endpoint was cumulative proportion of
patients requiring mechanical ventilation or who had died by Day 28.
Results: Of 389 randomized patients, 249 patients received tocilizumab and 128 received
placebo in the modified intent-to-treat population (Hispanic/Latino, 56.0%; Black/African
American, 14.9%; American Indian/Alaska Native, 12.7%; White, 12.7%; other/unknown,
3.7%). The cumulative proportion (95% confidence interval [CI]) of patients requiring
mechanical ventilation or who had died by Day 28 was 12.0% (8.52% to 16.86%) and 19.3 %
(13.34% to 27.36%) for the tocilizumab and placebo arms, respectively (log-rank P=0.0360;
hazard ratio, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.33 to 0.97]). Median time to clinical failure up to Day 28 favored
tocilizumab over placebo (hazard ratio 0.55 [95% CI, 0.33 to 0.93]). All-cause mortality by Day
28 was 10.4% with tocilizumab and 8.6% with placebo (weighted difference, 2.0% [95% CI, –
5.2% to 7.8%). In the safety population, serious adverse events occurred in 15.2% of tocilizumab
patients (38/250 patients) and 19.7% of placebo patients (25/127).
Conclusions: This trial demonstrated the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab over placebo in
reducing the likelihood of progression to requiring mechanical ventilation or death in
nonventilated patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in China in December 2019 and rapidly became a
public health emergency.1,2 In severe and critical cases, which occur in 14% and 5% of patients,
respectively, Covid-19–associated pneumonia can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome3,4;
respiratory failure is among the leading causes of death in patients with Covid-19.5,6
Patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia often require invasive mechanical ventilation,
and the mortality rate is higher in these patients, especially in those who are > 65 years.7-10 In the
absence of approved therapies for Covid-19, the mainstay of treatment for patients with Covid19 pneumonia is symptomatic and supportive,11 with dexamethasone being the only therapy
demonstrated to improve patient outcomes thus far.12 A clear unmet need exists for therapies to
treat Covid-19 pneumonia.3,7
Therapies for Covid-19 pneumonia are especially needed for underserved and racial and ethnic
minority populations, who are disproportionately affected by the pandemic.13-21 In cases reported
to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 33% of patients were Hispanic and 22%
were Black, whereas these groups make up 18% and 13% of the US population, respectively.14
This is also a global issue; among 17 million patients in England, all non-White ethnic patients
were found to have a higher risk of Covid-19–related death than White patients.15 Greater
inclusion of minorities and underserved populations in clinical trials of Covid-19 therapies is
needed; these populations are often not a focus of clinical trial recruitment and have been
underrepresented in Covid-19 trials.22 Clinical data on these specific populations are urgently
needed to improve patient outcomes.
Covid-19 may be associated with a dysregulated immune response and hyperinflammation,
which can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure.4,23,24 Studies have

found that increased levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) were associated with severe Covid-19 and
increasing IL-6 levels correlated with increased likelihood of needing mechanical ventilation and
mortality.25-27 The anti–IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody tocilizumab, which is approved for
multiple inflammatory diseases,28,29 has been found to improve outcomes in patients with Covid19 pneumonia in observational studies in the US and globally.30-34 Although the randomized,
placebo-controlled COVACTA trial—which enrolled patients with a range of disease severity,
including 38% of patients receiving mechanical ventilation—did not meet its primary endpoint,
its results suggested that tocilizumab may have a positive effect on recovery time and need for
intensive care, which warrants further investigation.35
The global phase III EMPACTA (Evaluating Minority Patients with Actemra) clinical trial
investigated the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab in hospitalized, nonventilated patients with
Covid-19 pneumonia, with an emphasis on enrolling high-risk and racial and ethnic minority
populations.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Trial Design and Oversight
EMPACTA is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study to evaluate the
safety and efficacy of tocilizumab in hospitalized, nonventilated patients with Covid-19
pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04372186). Inclusion of global study sites enrolling highrisk and minority populations was emphasized to enhance the understanding of the clinical

profile of tocilizumab in these patients and allow access to underserved and minority
populations, which are not commonly represented in clinical trials.
Patients ≥18 years of age (with no upper age limit) hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia
confirmed by a positive polymerase chain reaction test and radiographic imaging were eligible.
Patients had a blood oxygen saturation <94% on ambient air but were excluded if they required
continuous positive airway pressure, bilevel positive airway pressure, or mechanical ventilation.
Patients were receiving standard care per local practice, which could include antiviral treatment,
limited systemic corticosteroids (≤1 mg/kg methylprednisolone or equivalent recommended) and
supportive care. Patients were excluded if progression to death was imminent and inevitable
within 24 hours as determined by the treating physician or they had active tuberculosis or
suspected active bacterial, fungal, or viral infection (other than SARS-CoV-2 or well-controlled
HIV). Patients with comorbidities were not excluded unless the investigator determined it would
preclude safe patient participation.
All patients or their legally authorized representative gave informed consent. This study was
conducted in accordance with the International Council for Harmonization E6 guideline for good
clinical practice and the Declaration of Helsinki or local regulations, whichever afforded greater
patient protection. Institutional review boards or ethics committees approved the protocol. The
sponsor (Genentech, Inc.) designed the study, conducted it per the protocol, collected the data,
and performed the analyses. All authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and
for the trial’s fidelity to the protocol. All manuscript drafts were prepared by the authors, with
editorial and writing assistance funded by the sponsor.
Patients were randomized (2:1) to intravenous tocilizumab (8 mg/kg, maximum 800 mg) or
placebo, both plus standard care through permuted-block randomization and an interactive voice

or web-based response system. Randomization was stratified by country (United States, Mexico,
Kenya, South Africa, Peru, Brazil) and age (≤60 and >60 years). If a patient’s clinical signs or
symptoms worsened or did not improve (reflected by sustained fever or worsening status on the
7-category ordinal scale), an additional infusion could be administered 8 to 24 hours after the
first.
Efficacy was evaluated by Day 28, and patients were followed for a total of 60 days; patients
discharged prior to Day 28 were considered study completers and followed weekly up to Day 28
with a safety follow-up by Day 60.
Outcome Measures
The primary efficacy endpoint was cumulative proportion of patients requiring mechanical
ventilation (mechanical invasive ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygen) or who had
died by Day 28. Key secondary efficacy endpoints evaluated up to or by Day 28 were time to
hospital discharge or ready for discharge based on a 7-category ordinal scale (Table S1 in the
Supplementary Appendix); time to a ≥2 category improvement in clinical status relative to
baseline on a 7-category ordinal scale (for patients in category 2 at baseline, having a clinical
status of category 1 was considered meeting the threshold); time to clinical failure (time to death,
mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit [ICU] admission [or 2-category worsening in the 7category ordinal scale from baseline for patients already admitted into the ICU at study
enrollment], or withdrawal [whichever occurred first]); and mortality rate. The primary efficacy
endpoint was also analyzed by race/ethnicity subgroups.
Incidence and severity of adverse events, determined by the National Cancer Institute Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0, were evaluated.

Statistical Analysis
A modified intent-to-treat (mITT, all randomized patients who received any study medication)
population of 379 patients with 2:1 randomization was estimated to provide at least 80% power
to detect a 15% difference between groups for the primary objective using a log-rank test
assuming cumulative event rate (death or requiring mechanical ventilation) of 25% and 40% in
the tocilizumab and placebo groups, respectively. Efficacy analyses were performed on the mITT
population grouped according to randomization. Analyses were stratified by age group (≤60 or
>60 years).
The primary endpoint was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and cumulative incidence
curves were compared between treatment groups using the stratified log-rank test. The stratified
Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (tocilizumab over placebo)
and 95% confidence interval (CI) between treatment arms.
Primary and key secondary endpoints were evaluated in a hierarchical manner to control the
overall study-wide type 1 error rate at the 5% significance level. If the primary endpoint reached
statistical significance at the 2-sided 5% significance level, the key secondary endpoints were
tested in the following predefined order: (1) time to hospital discharge/ready for discharge, (2)
time to improvement in clinical status, (3) time to clinical failure endpoint, and (4) mortality.
Time-to-event secondary endpoints were compared between treatment groups using the KaplanMeier approach. In the analyses for time to hospital discharge/ready for discharge and for time to
improvement in clinical status, patients who had died or discontinued from study prior to
hospital discharge/ready for discharge or prior to achieving improvement in clinical status were
censored by Day 28 or date of the last ordinal scale assessment, respectively. In the analysis of
the time to clinical failure endpoint, patients not experiencing clinical failure on or prior to Day

28 were censored at the last contact date or Day 28, whichever was earlier. Mortality by Day 28
was compared between treatment arms using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusted for age.
For subgroup analyses, see the Supplementary Appendix.
Safety was assessed in the safety evaluable population, which was all patients who received any
study medication; patients were grouped by the actual treatment received.

RESULTS
Patients
Overall, 389 patients from 6 countries were randomized, with 1 patient randomized in error, and
377 received study treatment (Figure 1). In the mITT population, 249 patients received
tocilizumab plus standard of care and 128 received placebo plus standard of care. The safety
population included 250 and 127 patients, respectively, because 1 patient randomized to placebo
received tocilizumab and 11 patients did not receive study treatment. Study drug exposure is
provided in Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix. Overall, 225 patients (90.4%) completed
the study in the tocilizumab arm and 115 (89.8%) in the placebo arm; excluding those who died,
no tocilizumab patients and 2 placebo patients (1.6%) discontinued before Day 28. Median
follow-up time was 10 days in both treatment arms.
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were generally balanced between treatment
arms (Table 1). In the tocilizumab and placebo arms, 60.2% and 57.0% of patients were male,
respectively, and mean (± SD) age was 56.0 ±14.3 years and 55.6 ±14.9 years, respectively. In
the tocilizumab and placebo arms, 143 patients (57.4%) and 68 (53.1%) were Hispanic/Latino,
respectively, 35 patients (14.1%) and 21 (16.4%) were Black/African American, respectively,

and 33 (13.3%) and 15 (11.7%) were American Indian/Alaska Native, respectively. In the
tocilizumab and placebo arms, use of systemic corticosteroids (200 patients [80.3%] and 112
[87.5%]) and antiviral treatment (196 [78.7%] and 102 [79.7%]) in the 7 days prior to or during
the study), respectively, were similar. In the tocilizumab and placebo arms, 55.4% and 67.2% of
patients received dexamethasone, respectively, and 52.6% and 58.6% received remdesivir,
respectively.

Primary Efficacy Outcome
The primary efficacy comparison was statistically significant; the cumulative proportion of
patients requiring mechanical ventilation or who had died by Day 28 was 12.0% (95% CI, 8.52%
to 16.86%) with tocilizumab and 19.3 % (95% CI, 13.34% to 27.36%) with placebo (hazard
ratio, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.33 to 0.97]); log-rank P=0.0360; Table 2, Figure 2).

Secondary Outcomes
Median (95% CI) time to hospital discharge/ready for discharge up to Day 28 was 6.0 days (6.0
to 7.0) with tocilizumab and 7.5 days (7.0 to 9.0) with placebo (hazard ratio, 1.16 [95% CI, 0.91
to 1.48]); Table 2, Figure S1). Median (95% CI) time to improvement in ordinal clinical status
up to Day 28 was 6.0 days (6.0 to 7.0) with tocilizumab and 7.0 days (6.0 to 9.0) with placebo
(hazard ratio, 1.15 [95% CI, 0.90 to 1.48]; Table 2, Figure S2). Median (95% CI) time to
clinical failure up to Day 28 was not reached in either group (hazard ratio, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.33 to
0.93]; Table 2, Figure S3). Mortality (95% CI) by Day 28 was 10.4% (7.2% to 14.9%) in the

tocilizumab arm and 8.6% (4.9% to 14.7%) in the placebo arm (weighted difference, 2% [95%
CI, –5.2% to 7.8%)]; Table 2).

Exploratory Outcomes
Primary efficacy analysis results by race/ethnicity were consistent with the result for all patients
(Figure S4).

Safety
Overall, adverse events were reported in 50.8% of 250 patients and 52.8% of 127 patients in the
tocilizumab and placebo arms, respectively, through Day 60 (the data cutoff was September 30,
2020) and serious adverse events in 15.2% and 19.7% (Table 3). Deaths occurred in 29 patients
(11.6%) in the tocilizumab arm and 15 (11.8%) in the placebo arm. Through Day 60, 13 patients
receiving tocilizumab (5.2%) had 16 serious infections and 9 patients receiving placebo (7.1%)
had 11.

DISCUSSION
The phase III EMPACTA trial of tocilizumab in hospitalized nonventilated patients with Covid19 pneumonia emphasized enrolling high-risk and racial and ethnic minority patients, who are
disproportionately affected by Covid-19 and often underrepresented in clinical trials.13-22 Overall,
>25% of patients were over age 65, >75% had ≥1 comorbidity and >80% were a racial or ethnic
minority. This trial demonstrated significant reduction in the likelihood of progressing to

mechanical ventilation or death by Day 28 in patients receiving tocilizumab plus standard care vs
placebo plus standard care. When all-cause mortality alone was evaluated as a secondary
endpoint, no mortality benefit was observed; however, this study was not specifically designed
or powered to detect differences in mortality, making it difficult to draw conclusions based on
these data. Time to clinical failure up to Day 28 favored tocilizumab over placebo.
Healthcare disparities in Covid-19 are a critical issue as studies continue to show that racial and
ethnic minority populations are disproportionately affected by the pandemic.13-21 The role of race
and ethnicity in Covid-19 is complex and not fully understood; social determinants of health,
socioeconomic factors, and historic and structural inequities may play a role but do not
completely explain the observations in the body of evidence, and further research is
needed.16,18,21,36 EMPACTA directly addressed the discrepancy between the overrepresentation
of racial and ethnic minorities with Covid-19 disease and their underrepresentation in Covid-19
trials22 by prioritizing sites that provide care to underserved and minority populations while
continuing to enroll all eligible patients. As a result, 84% were either Hispanic/Latino,
Black/African American, or American Indian/Alaska Native. Although the analysis was
exploratory, the primary efficacy outcomes based on race were consistent with the outcome in
the overall patient population.
Preventing progression to mechanical ventilation, which may greatly alter patient outcomes and
healthcare resource availability, is critical for potential Covid-19 therapies. Mechanical
ventilation is administered as disease severity increases and patients experience respiratory
distress and failure. In an observational study of critically ill patients with Covid-19, 76%
received mechanical ventilation and the mortality rate among these patients was 35.7%.8 In a
global literature survey of hospitalized patients with Covid-19, 63% of those in the ICU received

mechanical ventilation and the mortality rate for these patients was 59%.9 In addition to clinical
decision-making, one of the main factors determining whether patients receive mechanical
ventilation is availability of resources. Critical shortages of ventilators have occurred globally
during the pandemic, underscoring the need for effective therapies that preserve this limited
resource37; this is especially a concern in African countries.38 Reducing the proportion of patients
who progress to requiring mechanical ventilation, as this study demonstrated in patients
receiving tocilizumab, could help reduce the burden on critical care services, reduce direct
healthcare costs, and ensure availability for the most critical patients.39
Besides EMPACTA, the efficacy of tocilizumab in Covid-19 has been examined in one other
randomized placebo-controlled trial, COVACTA.35 COVACTA included patients across a
spectrum of disease severity, from baseline moderate hypoxia to invasive mechanical ventilation,
while EMPACTA enrolled patients who were not ventilated at baseline and who were at an
earlier stage of disease. Furthermore, in contrast with COVACTA, in EMPACTA most patients
received concomitant corticosteroids or antivirals, which have become the mainstay of Covid-19
standard care,40 although these treatments were not used uniformly and patients may not have
received a full treatment course. Corticosteroid and antiviral use was generally balanced between
arms, and EMPACTA demonstrated the added clinical benefit of tocilizumab. In COVACTA,
the median time to hospital discharge was 20 and 28 days in the tocilizumab and placebo arms,
respectively, whereas in EMPACTA, it was 6 and 7.5 days, respectively.35 This may reflect
patients who were more severely ill or different comorbid conditions at study baseline in
COVACTA, as well as improvements in the standards of care and different proportions of
patients receiving concomitant steroids and antivirals. Tocilizumab was associated with a

reduced risk of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.61 [95% CI,
0.40–0.92]; P=0.020) in a retrospective study.32
EMPACTA demonstrated the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab plus standard care over placebo
plus standard care in reducing the likelihood of progression to requiring mechanical ventilation
or death among hospitalized nonventilated patients with Covid-19 pneumonia; this is the first
placebo-controlled trial to demonstrate a likelihood of reduction in progression to mechanical
ventilation in Covid-19. EMPACTA is also the first trial of its kind to emphasize diversity and
ensure underserved populations are represented in clinical research and given the opportunity to
receive novel therapies.

The Wilson method was used to estimate the 95% CI for the observed proportion. The Cochran-

Mantel-Haenszel weighting approach with age group as the stratification factor (≤ 60, >60 years)
was used to calculate the weighted difference in percentages. The Newcombe method was used
to estimate the 95% CI for the weighted difference.

Included all deaths reported from ordinal scale scoring, adverse events reporting and public

death records, during hospital stay and after hospital discharge, through Day 28.

treatment; PBO, placebo; TCZ, tocilizumab.
*A total of 389 patients were randomized; 1 patient was randomized prior to local institutional
review board approval of study site. This patient did not receive study drug, and no further data
were collected for this patient, resulting in 388 evaluable patients.

Figure 2. Cumulative Proportion Plot of Time to Requiring Mechanical Ventilation or Death by
Day 28 (modified-intent-to-treat population)*

*The cumulative proportion of patients was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and
compared between treatment groups using the stratified log-rank test. The stratified Cox
proportional hazard model was used to estimate the hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval
(CI) between treatment arms.
