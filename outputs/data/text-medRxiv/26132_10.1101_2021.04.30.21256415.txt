45

COVID-19 is an ongoing global pandemic, for which Ivermectin has been tried on a
therapeutic and prophylactic basis.

2.

Results from several clinical trials and observational studies suggest that Ivermectin may

46

improve survival and clinical outcomes with a good safety profile when compared with

47

other treatments; however, the current evidence is limited. .

1.

50
51

This systematic review and meta-analysis provide a summary of the latest literature on
the efficacy and safety of Ivermectin use for COVID-19.

2.

Based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis, we found that Ivermectin may be a

52

potentially useful adjuvant therapy in reducing mortality, the need for ICU admissions

53

and mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients.

Abstract

70

Importance/Background: Despite the global healthcare’s exhaustive efforts to treat COVID-

71

19, we still do not have an effective cure for it. Repurposing Ivermectin, a known antiparasitic

72

agent, for treating COVID-19 has demonstrated positive results in several studies. We aim to

73

evaluate the benefit and risk of Ivermectin in COVID-19.

74

Methods: We conducted a systematic search for full-text manuscripts published from February

75

1, 2020 to March 27, 2021 that focused on efficacy and safety of Ivermectin therapy against

76

COVID-19. The primary outcomes were overall mortality, need for intensive care unit (ICU)

77

admission; secondary outcomes were - adverse effects, need for mechanical ventilation.

78

Random-effects models were used for all analysis.

79

Results: We included a total of 38 studies (n=15,002) in the qualitative analysis (Mortality

80

N=28, ICU admission= 8, Mechanical Ventilation= 10, Adverse events=28) and out of these, 30

81

studies (n=11,291) were included in the quantitative analysis (Mortality N=22, ICU admission=

82

5, Mechanical Ventilation= 9, Adverse events=17). In the mortality meta-analysis, odds of death

83

were lower in the Ivermectin-arm compared to the non-Ivermectin arm. (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.22-

84

0.70; I2=81%). Subgroup analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials with severity-based data

85

showed mortality benefit overall (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15-0.72; I2=53%) and in the mild/moderate

86

sub-group (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.03-0.33; I2=0%). Benefit of Ivermectin in decreasing; the need

87

for ICU admission (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.17-1.37; I2=59%) and mechanical ventilation (OR 0.64,

88

95% CI 0.40-1.04; I2=17%) was not significant. The quantitative analysis of adverse effects with

89

Ivermectin use was inconclusive (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.64-1.33; I2=14%).

90

Conclusion: Our meta-analysis suggests that Ivermectin could be an effective adjuvant therapy

91

in reducing mortality, particularly in patients with mild-moderate clinical presentation of

92

COVID-19. Trends of decreased need for ICU admissions and mechanical ventilation were

93

observed but were not significant. The analysis for adverse effects was inconclusive.

Introduction
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 disease

96

a global pandemic1. Today, on April 29,2021, there are about >149 million confirmed cases

97

worldwide and >3 million deaths due to COVID-192. Patients infected with SARS-COV-2, the

98

causative Coronavirus, exhibit a spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic to

99

severely critical and multiple risk factors are involved in the prognosis of the disease3-8. To guide

100

decision-making for this multi-system disease8-17, a variety of treatment modalities have been

101

proposed and evaluated18-23. However, the evidence for the risk-benefit ratio of most of these

102

treatments remains unclear.

103

Ivermectin has held an excellent safety record in humans as an antiparasitic agent for

104

over three decades24. Apart from its established activity against several parasites, Ivermectin has

105

demonstrated antiviral activity against many RNA and DNA viruses in vivo and against a few in

106

vitro by targeting specific proteins25. One such plausible mechanism against RNA viruses is the

107

inhibition of importin (IMP) α/β Integrase , thus blocking viral entry into the nucleus and the

108

ensuing suppression of the cell's anti-viral response25-28. Moreover, it exhibited anti-bacterial,

109

anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer effects24,29,30. An Australian study demonstrated the

110

effectiveness of Ivermectin in inhibiting SARS-COV2 in-vitro31. Subsequently, several

111

Ivermectin-based clinical trials and observational studies conducted globally showed mostly

112

positive results32-35. Some countries have incorporated this therapy in their COVID-19

113

guidelines36-39. Only a month after this authorization, Peru witnessed a record drop of 25% in

114

COVID-19 related mortality40.

115
116

Dr. Satoshi Ōmura, who was among the scientists that won the Nobel prize for the
discovery of Ivermectin, highlighted the need to develop a drug that arrests the early stage of

117

viral replication in COVID-1941. Repurposing Ivermectin, a low-cost drug may help bypass the

118

time and funds needed to develop and test novel therapies. The lack of robust evidence has been

119

a major hindrance in the large-scale approval of Ivermectin. The available studies are

120

methodologically diverse and mostly under-powered while few report conflicting results.

121

Therefore, we intend to systematically review the latest literature and plan to perform a meta-

122

analysis to overcome some of the individual study biases.

123

Methods:

124

Search Method and strategy

125

We conducted a comprehensive literature search for studies mentioning the use of

126

Ivermectin in COVID-19 from February 1, 2020 till March 27, 2021 (Figure 1). We screened all

127

titles and abstracts identified by preliminary search for eligible studies and manually searched

128

references of included articles for additional studies. Then we analyzed full-text manuscripts of

129

included studies according to the protocol of Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)

130

guidelines.

131

Eligibility Criteria

132

We included studies reporting outcomes of mortality, ICU admission, mechanical

133

ventilation, and adverse-effects with Ivermectin treatment against COVID-19. We excluded

134

studies focusing on pregnant females, in- vitro studies, meta-analyses, case reports and case

135

series <5 patients.

136

Study selection and data extraction

137
138

The extracted data was tabularized in Microsoft Excel with following parameters: author,
country of study, study design, number of patients, Ivermectin regimen, concomitant treatment,

139

efficacy outcomes and adverse effects. The included data was checked for accuracy by all

140

authors and disagreements were resolved through consensus and after input from a third

141

reviewer. IRB approval was exempted because data was extracted from publicly available

142

studies. We also analyzed raw data files of studies by Cadegiani42 and Lima-Morales et al43 for

143

cases receiving Ivermectin; and Niaee et al44 for clinical severity data. In Cadegiani et al's

144

study42, we considered 'CG1' as control group because only this sample was demographically

145

comparable to the treatment group. Bernigaud et al.’s study45 was excluded because the

146

methodology and outcomes were poorly described. Additionally, we compiled all ongoing

147

clinical trials on Ivermectin from clinicaltrials.gov (e-table 8).

148

Outcomes

149

The primary outcome was defined as mortality benefit with Ivermectin therapy in

150

COVID-19 and need for ICU admission. The secondary outcomes were need for mechanical

151

ventilation and adverse effects of Ivermectin.

152

Statistical analysis

153

Primary and Secondary outcomes were quantitatively analyzed by Review Manager

154

(RevMan) Version 5.4 for windows46 and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software package

155

(Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA)47 was used for qualitative-analysis. Random-effects model was

156

used for both48. Raw data for outcomes and non-events from each study were used to calculate

157

crude odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each study. The Cochrane Q and I2

158

statistics were calculated to assess heterogeneity between studies48. I2 <25% were interpreted as

159

low-level heterogeneity48. We performed subgroup analysis by study design to decrease inherent

160

selection bias in observational studies48. Probability of publication bias was assessed with funnel

161

plot using Egger’s tests48 (e-figure 14-19). If there was statistical heterogeneity in results, further

162

sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the source of heterogeneity by excluding each

163

study. After significant heterogeneity was excluded, random-effects model was used for meta-

164

analysis. P-value <0.05 (2-sided) was considered statistically significant48.

165

Risk of Bias and Quality assessment

166

Clinical trials were evaluated using Cochrane risk of bias tool49 (e-table 2) and correlation of

167

quality measures with estimates of treatment effects in meta-analyses of randomized controlled

168

trials tool50 (e-table 3) was used for quality assessment. We used NIH quality assessment Tool

169

for case series51 (e-table 4), case-control (e-table 5), or cohort studies (e-table 6). NIH quality

170

assessment tools were based on quality assessment methods, concepts, and other tools developed

171

by researchers in the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Cochrane

172

Collaboration, USPSTF, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, and National Health

173

Service Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, consulting epidemiologists and evidence-based

174

medicine experts, with adaptations by methodologists and NHLBI staff. We assessed the

175

certainty of evidence by using GRADE pro profiler52 (GRADE working group, McMaster

176

University and Evidence Prime Inc) at the outcome level (e-table 7).

A total of 15002 patients from 38 articles32-35,42-44,53-83 (Ivermectin n=6669, No Ivermectin

180

n=8333) were included in qualitative analysis , 11291 patients from 30 studies (Ivermectin

181

n=2996, No Ivermectin n=8295) were included in quantitative synthesis (e-table 1, Figure 1).

182

Out of 24 trials, 19 were true RCTs (e-table 1, Figure 1). The remaining 14 studies were

183

observational and included 6 case-series (e-table 1, Figure 1). Out of 38, 16 articles were

184

available as preprints and clinicaltrials.gov was used for data extraction for 2 trials76,84 (e-table

Overall

192

Total 22 studies reported mortality rate in patients receiving Ivermectin (252/2778) vs no-

193

Ivermectin therapy (1265/8038). The odds of mortality in the Ivermectin group were

194

significantly lower compared to control group (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.22-0.70, p=0.002; I2=81%)

195

(Figure 2A) but evidence was graded very low. In sensitivity analysis, we observed similar

196

mortality benefit with moderate heterogeneity after excluding study by Soto-Becerra et al82 (OR

but evidence was graded very low. On excluding Galan et al66 for sensitivity analysis, benefit

203

observed was more solid with moderate heterogeneity (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.13-0.50, p<0.001;

205
206

Subgroup: RCTs
We analyzed clinical severity-based data in 12 RCTs. The odds of mortality were

207

lowered with Ivermectin in the overall group, with moderate heterogeneity (OR 0.33, 95% CI

208

0.15-0.72, p=0.005; I2=53%) Similar benefit was observed in the mild/moderate subgroup (OR

209

0.10, 95% CI 0.03-0.33, p=0.002; I2=0%). However, mortality benefit was not statistically

210

significant in the severe/critical subgroup (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.23-1.23, p=0.14; I2=57% (Figure

211

3B). Certainty of evidence was moderate overall; however, it was high in mild/moderate and

212

moderate in severe/critical subgroup. Therefore, in mild/moderate COVID-19 patients,

213

Ivermectin could be used for reducing mortality.

214

In sensitivity analysis, after excluding Elgazzar et al64 from the severe/critical subgroup,

215

odds of mortality increased in the total group, with moderate heterogeneity (OR 0.43, 95% CI

216

0.21-0.90, p=0.02; I2=39%). The odds increased in the severe/critical subgroup, with no

217

heterogeneity (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.49-1.43, p=0.53; I2=0%), but remained statistically

218

insignificant (e-figure 2).

219

Observational studies

220

Mortality benefit was not statistically significant in subgroup of 7 observational studies

221

(OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.30-1.22, p=0.16; I2=74%) (Figure 3C) and evidence was graded very low.

222

On excluding Soto-Becerra et al82 in sensitivity analysis, we observed statistically significant

223

mortality benefit (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.34- 0.77, p=0.001; I2=0%) (e-figure 3).

Subgroup: Inpatient RCTs

231

Analysis of RCTs (N=8) with only hospitalized patients showed similar mortality benefit

232

(OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.15-0.87, p=0.02; I2=67%) (e-figure 6). Evidence was graded moderate.

233

After excluding Galan et al66 in sensitivity analysis, mortality benefit with moderate

235

Subgroup: Inpatient Observational studies

236

Mortality benefit was also seen in 6 observational studies with only hospitalized patients,

237

with high heterogeneity (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.31-1.29, p=0.21; I2=77%) (e-figure 8). Evidence

238

was graded very low. In sensitivity analysis, after excluding Soto-Becerra et al82 significant

mortality benefit was seen with low heterogeneity (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.32-0.81, p=0.005;

240

I2=10%) (e-figure 9).

excluding Galan et al66 we observed statistically significant benefit (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.11-0.92,

250

p=0.03; I2=27%) (Figure 4B). Based on low grading of evidence and observed low-moderate

251

heterogeneity in analysis, Ivermectin may be helpful in decreasing need for ICU admission.

252

Further validation with well-designed pragmatic platform trials is needed.

253

Qualitative Analysis

254

Pooled ICU admission rate obtained from 8 studies (out of 38) was 5.4%, 95% CI 1.9-

255

14.7; I2=91.9% (e-figure 11).

256

Secondary Outcomes

257

Need for Mechanical Ventilation

258

Meta-analysis

259

Overall, 9 studies documented the need for mechanical ventilation. 62/995 patients

260

receiving Ivermectin and 81/787 patients in the control arm required mechanical ventilation. The

261

benefit of Ivermectin was statistically insignificant (OR=0.64, 95%CI 0.40-1.04, p=0.07;

262

I2=17%) (Figure 4C). Evidence was graded very low. On excluding Galan et al66 in sensitivity

263

analysis, benefit observed was statistically significant with low heterogeneity (OR 0.55, 95% CI

264

0.33-0.93, p=0.03; I2=9%) (Figure 4D). Although the evidence was low, Ivermectin may confer

265

significant protection against the need for mechanical ventilation. Hence, we would suggest

266

considering Ivermectin with bedside clinician’s judgement.

267

Qualitative Analysis

268

The rate of need for mechanical ventilation based on 10 studies (out of 38) was 4.4%,

269

95% CI 1.6-11.1; I2=88.8% (e-figure 12).

270

Adverse events

271

Meta-analysis

272

A total of 17 studies reported data for rate of adverse-events in the Ivermectin-arm

273

(245/973) vs control group (234/945). We did not find an association between Ivermectin and

274

rate of adverse events as compared to controls (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.64- 1.33, p=0.67; I2=14%).

275

(Figure 5A) but evidence was graded very low. In sensitivity Analysis, after excluding Mahmud

276

et al76 incidence of adverse effects with Ivermectin was similar to that of the control group but

277

was not conclusive (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.62-1.16, p=0.31; I2=0%) (Figure 5B).

278

Qualitative Analysis

279

A total of 28 studies (out of 38) yielded a pooled rate of 8.1%, 95% CI 4.2-14.8;

280

I2=93.5% (e-figure 13).

281

Discussion

282

Our meta-analysis suggests that Ivermectin may improve survival in COVID-19 patients

283

and reduce the need for admission to the ICU and mechanical ventilation. However, its relation

284

to the incidence of adverse effects is inconclusive. Further, our qualitative analysis indicates that

285

Ivermectin treatment is linked to lower death rate and better clinical outcomes with a low

286

incidence of adverse effects. The inherent methodological limitations and risk of bias conferred

287

variable evidence grading in the findings in various patient outcomes.

288

Mortality

289

Our findings are corroborated by other meta-analyses done by Padhy85 (studies N=3),

290

Hill86 (studies N=6), Lawrie87 (studies N=5), Nardelli88 (studies N=7), Kow89 (studies N=6),

291

Bryant et al90 (studies N=13 ) and the BIRD group91 (studies N=13) which found Ivermectin to

292

be conclusively linked to lower mortality when compared to usual treatment. A network meta-

293

analysis92 (studies N=2) reported that Ivermectin was linked to lower mortality with a very close

294

statistical significance. Casteneda-Sabogal et al's meta-analysis93 (studies N=6) found no

295

conclusive association of Ivermectin with reduced mortality. Of note, the above two studies

296

reported low or very low certainty of evidence92,93. Our sample size exceeds (studies N=22) that

297

of all the aforementioned studies.

298

Our pooled analysis resulting in a low mortality rate of 3.5% with use of Ivermectin

299

reiterates its positive impact in lowering mortality in COVID-19 patients. For a valid

300

comparison, it is important to factor in the time window during which the individual studies were

301

conducted. Most studies recorded their data in the II&III quarter of 2020 when mortality rates

302

with various treatments were often higher in respective countries94.

303

Need for ICU admission and Mechanical Ventilation

304

Due to the small number of studies and their small individual sample size, benefit with

305

Ivermectin in reducing ICU admissions or mechanical ventilation cannot be concluded with

306

confidence. In our pooled analysis, we observed significantly lower rates for ICU admission

307

(5.43%) and mechanical ventilation (4.36%) in Ivermectin-treated patients when compared to

16

308

other treatments95-97. It must be noted that our pooled analysis mostly included mild/moderate

309

patients, which may skew the results in favor of Ivermectin.

310

Adverse events

311

Our analysis for adverse events was inconclusive. We noticed that most adverse events

312

were non-serious: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, pruritus, lethargy, vertigo,

313

tingling, numbness, anxiety, mild hyperglycemia etc. Yet, very few patients reported serious

314

events like organizing pneumonia, hyponatremia, erosive esophagitis, infections/infestations.

315

Erosive esophagitis was attributed to concomitant use of Doxycycline76; hyponatremia74 was

316

likely from SIADH-a rare COVID-19 complication98. Only Lopez-Medina et al75, that used a

317

high Ivermectin dose of 1500ug/Kg over 5 days, reported drug discontinuation due to adverse-

318

reactions. Given the non-serious nature of most adverse-reactions, and a low pooled rate of 8.1%

319

in comparison to other available treatments23,99,100, we suggest that Ivermectin was generally well

320

tolerated.

321

Strengths

322

To our knowledge, this is the largest patient sample size for a systematic review and

323

meta-analysis on the use of Ivermectin for COVID-19. This study integrates data of

324

approximately 15,000 patients from 38 studies conducted globally. Additionally, we obtained

325

robust evidence by conducting various subgroup analyses. For a stronger empirical evidence of

326

Ivermectin's efficacy, we excluded studies which did not meet the rigor of true RCTs in the

327

'RCTs' subgroup for a 'high' rated level of evidence as per the GRADEpro tool52. The GRADE

328

framework is known to be the most widely used assessment to rate quality of evidence52.

329

Sensitivity analyses were performed when results were statistically weak. Moreover, we

330

performed qualitative analyses to incorporate data from uncontrolled studies.

331
332

Limitations
Our results are to be interpreted carefully bearing in mind that we included several non-

333

peer-reviewed articles to obtain the latest data. We cannot preclude the possibility of unreported

334

biases and confounders that could have been recognized by a peer-review process. Furthermore,

335

there was significant heterogeneity in treatment protocols used for dosage, duration, route of

336

administration in interventional and control group. Our analyses may not have accounted for

337

confounding by concomitant therapy. Patient demographics and outcome measures varied among

338

different studies. Few studies documented the inclusion of patients <18 years of age. However,

339

the mean/median, dispersion values consistently suggested a predominantly adult population.

340

The clinical classification for severity was inconsistent across the included studies. Most studies

341

were conducted on patients with mild /moderate presentation, which limits the generalizability of

342

our results. There was insufficient data regarding the time of treatment in the course of the

343

disease, hence inferences could not be made in that regard. We could not confirm adequate

344

control-matching in some observational studies. We advise discretion in interpretation of our

345

results for adverse-event rate since most of the reported adverse-effects could not be measured

346

objectively by investigators. Because most of the studies were conducted in developing nations,

347

not everyone underwent RT-PCR testing owing to limited resources; clinical diagnosis was used

348

instead. Even though RT-PCR is the gold standard for diagnosis, it is subject to its limitations.

349

By virtue of its design, we postulate that this meta-analysis formulated with a random-effects

350

model may have addressed some of the heterogeneity stemming from the above factors. Lastly,

351

we must acknowledge the subjective nature of the GRADE tool used to evaluate the level of

352

evidence52.

354

Current status of Ivermectin
In February 2021, the NIH withdrew its recommendation against using Ivermectin for

355

COVID-19101. Around the same time, WHO shared that they will thoroughly evaluate the

356

available and upcoming evidence on Ivermectin before announcing any change in guidelines102.

357

As of March 5,2021, the FDA has warned people against using Ivermectin for COVID-19103,

358

specifically against self-medicating with veterinary Ivermectin formulations103,104. They are yet

359

to review the evidence but have initiated a preliminary research. Recently, the EMA (European

360

Medicines Agency) stated that Ivermectin cannot be recommended for the prevention or

361

treatment of COVID-19 outside clinical trials105.

362

Conclusion

363

In summary, Ivermectin may have a role as an adjuvant treatment in decreasing mortality

364

in mildly/moderately ill COVID-19 patients. Also, lower odds of ICU admissions and use of

365

mechanical ventilation with Ivermectin use were noted but with very low evidence. The

366

association with adverse events was inconclusive. Using well-designed larger observational

367

studies106,107 and clinical trials, we need to investigate Ivermectin’s ideal dosage and timing in

368

the disease course, drug interactions and possible synergistic drug combinations to achieve

369

maximum benefit. We propose pragmatic practice embedded platform trials108 to test this and

370

other re-purposed and novel therapies specifically in severe COVID-19 patients and other

371

critically ill patients.
