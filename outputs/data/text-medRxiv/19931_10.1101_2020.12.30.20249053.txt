Abstract
Introduction
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is an
infectious disease which has evolved into a worldwide pandemic. Growing evidence
suggests that individuals with pre-existing comorbidities are at higher risk of a more
serious COVID-19 illness. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy
which increases the susceptibility to infections and as a consequent has higher risks of
morbidity and mortality.
The impact of COVID-19 on SCD patients could lead to further increase in disease
severity and mortality. Studies that examine the effect of SCD on COVID-19 outcomes
are lacking. This study aims to determine whether SCD is a risk factor for severe
COVID-19 infection in regards to the requirement of non-invasive ventilation/high flow
nasal cannula (NIV/HFNC), mechanical intubation (MV) or death.
Methods:
Retrospective cohort study which included COVID-19 patients admitted to four
Ministry of Health COVID-19 treatment facilities in Bahrain during the period of 24,
February 2020, to 31, July 2020. All SCD patients with COVID-19 were included and
compared to randomly selected non-SCD patients with COVID-19. Data for the
selected patients were collected from the medical records. Multivariate logistic
regression models were used to control for confounders and estimate the effect of
SCD on the outcomes.
Results:
A total of 1,792 patients with COVID-19 were included; 38 of whom were diagnosed
with SCD as well. In the SCD group, one (2.6%) patient required NIV/HFNC, one (2.6%)
required MV and one (2.6%) death occurred. In comparison, 56 (3.2%) of the non-SCD
patients required NIV/HFNC, 47 (2.7%) required MV and death occurred in 58 (3.3%)
patients. Upon adjusting for confounders, SCD had an odds ratio of 1.847 (95% CI:
0.39 – 8.83; p=0.442).
Conclusion:
Our results indicate that SCD is not a risk factor for worse disease outcomes in COVID19 patients.

Introduction
The first case of the novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was diagnosed in Wuhan, China
in December 2019. Since then, the virus has spread drastically causing a pandemic
that resulted in more than 81 million cases to date and more than 1.7 million deaths
worldwide1. This led to global health and economic crises in multiple countries, many
of which are projected to face long-lasting repercussions2.
The illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus varies in its symptomatology and can range
from being asymptomatic3 to severe illness leading to acute respiratory distress
syndrome and eventually, death4. Several studies have shown an association between
higher rates of hospitalization and severe illness with advanced age, male gender, heart
failure, diabetes mellitus, severe asthma, high body mass index, chronic kidney disease,
chronic pulmonary disease and malignancy5–8. Additional factors that are suggestive of
more serious COVID-19 complications include admission oxygen saturation of <88%,
troponin-I level >1 ng/mL, C-reactive protein level >200 mg/L, and D-dimer levels >2500
ng/mL6. COVID-19 has been shown to increase the risk of thromboembolism which can
lead to significant morbidity and mortality9.
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited group of disorders characterized by the presence
of Hemoglobin S (HbS), either from homozygosity for the sickle mutation in the beta
globin chain of hemoglobin (HbSS) or from compound heterozygosity of a sickle beta
globin mutation with another beta globin mutation (e.g., Sickle-Beta Thalassemia).
Hemoglobinopathies, sickle cell disease in particular, are commonly found in the
Kingdom of Bahrain10. In 1995, a large study involving the hospitalized population of
Bahrain which included 5,503 neonates and 50,695 non-neonates, reported the
prevalence of SCD as 2.1% and HbS trait as 18.1% in neonates, and 10.4 % SCD in
non-neonatal patients11.
A hereditary blood disorder prevention awareness campaign was started in 1985 which
drastically reduced the incidence of hereditary blood disorders in Bahrain12. In May 2007,

newborn screening for SCD and thalassemia was established13. The program was
offered to all newborns, where cord blood was tested for hemoglobinopathies. A total of
38,940 newborns were screened between 2007 and 2010. The incidence of SCD in
newborns was found to be 0.7%, 0.6% and 0.4% in the years 2008, 2009 and 2010
respectively in comparison to 2.1% in 198512.
Patients with SCD are at a higher risk of morbidity & mortality. As per the nature of the
disease, they are predisposed to developing thrombotic events. These include vasoocclusive crises, cerebrovascular accidents, acute sickle hepatic crises, acute hepatic
sequestration and renal disease. Hemolytic crises, aplastic crises, infective episodes and
priapism are also amongst the complications seen in these patients. This can explain
why such patients tend to have a reduced life expectancy when compared to the general
population14,15. Severe complications such as acute chest syndrome16 and multiple organ
failure17 might be catastrophic and eventually lead to death.
Mortality rates for SCD patients admitted to intensive care units in Bahrain were
12.7%. This was slightly less than the overall mortality in other centers worldwide
which was 17.2%.18
Critically ill patients can develop cytokine storm, progressive endothelial activation and
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) resulting in multi-organ failure19.
Patients with SCD often have multiple comorbidities including chronic lung disease.
Viral infection can trigger acute vaso-occlusive crises in SCD patients, especially acute
chest syndrome which is associated with high mortality rates20. In this setting of multiorgan dysfunction, in particular chronic lung damage, COVID-19 could easily trigger
ACS and multi-organ failure. Underlying endothelial dysfunction and abnormal
expression of procoagulants such as tissue factor could also place SCD patients at a
greater risk21.

Hence, the combination of COVID-19 and SCD is hypothesized to cause an increase in
disease severity and mortality. Studies that examine the effect of SCD on COVID-19
outcomes are lacking. Given the morbidity and mortality associated with sickle cell
disease patients, it is predicted that these patients might have unfavorable outcomes
when infected with the SARS-Cov-2 virus.
This study aims to determine if SCD is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 through
comparing severity and outcomes of COVID-19 cases.
Objectives :
1.

Compare the odds of non-invasive ventilation, intubation or death in SCD cases and
controls

2. Compare the odds of requiring oxygenation on presentation or admission in SCD cases
versus controls

METHODS
Study design and setting
The study cohort included COVID-19 patients admitted to Bahrain’s Ministry of Health
COVID-19 treatment facilities during 24 February 2020 till 31 July 2020. The four
participating institutions included: Ebrahim bin Khalil Kanoo COVID-19 Centre,
Salmaniya Medical Complex COVID-19 Centre, Hereditary Blood Disorder Centre
(HBDC) COVID-19 Centre and Jidhafs COVID-19 Centre. All SCD patients diagnosed
with COVID-19 were included. Patients without SCD were sampled randomly from this
COVID-19 study cohort.
Outcomes
Primary outcome: The primary endpoint was the requirement of non-invasive ventilation,
intubation or death.
Secondary outcome: The requirement for oxygenation on presentation or admission

Diagnosis
The following methods were used to diagnose COVID-19 and sickle cell disease in our
study
COVID-19: All patients were confirmed to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 using a PCR
test of a nasopharyngeal sample. The PCR test was conducted using Thermo Fisher
Scientific (Waltham, MA) TaqPath 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix, CG on the Applied
Biosystems (Foster City, CA) 7500 Fast Dx RealTime PCR Instrument. The assay used
and targeted the E gene. If the E gene was detected, the sample was then confirmed
by RdRP and N genes. The E gene Ct value was reported and used in this study. Ct
values >40 were considered negative. Positive and negative controls were included for
quality control purposes.
Sickle Cell Disease: SCD status of patients was obtained from the medical records. All
patients marked as SCD within the study time frame were included. Patients with sickle
cell trait were not considered as SCD. The diagnosis of SCD is made through
hemoglobin electrophoresis and confirmed by a positive sickling test result.
Patient Selection
A full list of COVID-19 patients in these study periods and their SCD status were
extracted from the electronic medical records. The list was imported into the statistical
package. All COVID-19 patients with SCD as indicated in the EMR, were included. A
total of 1850 non-SCD patients with COVID-19 were randomly sampled. Ninety-six
patients were excluded due to duplicates, non hospitalized or due to lack of data. Data
was collected for a total of 1754 patients.
Data sources and variables assessed
We obtained data from the national electronic medical records database in Bahrain, “ISEHA” . Since this EMR database stores information as unstructured data, the study

participants’ information was manually extracted by five physicians, assisted by ten
senior medical students. This team reviewed all the cases and collated the information
into a structured dataset for this study. The data gathered included patients’
demographic details, vital signs, laboratory test results, medication lists, past medical
history, SCD status, clinical severity scale (as seen in the supplementary table attached
in the appendix), oxygenation requirement on admission, the ratio of the oxygen
saturation to the fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2:FiO2) at admission, requirement of
ventilator use and outcomes.
Statistical analysis
The distribution of treatment groups was summarized. Bivariate associations between
the sickle cell status groups and the measured patient characteristics were analyzed
using Chi-squared (χ2) tests for categorical variables and t-test for continuous variables.
We assessed endpoints and their associations with both groups.
Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the relationships between
SCD and the composite primary and secondary endpoints. These models included
demographic factors, clinical factors and medications.
The STATA software, version 15.1, was used to execute the statistical analyses,
(StataCorp. 2017. Stata Statistical Software: Release 15. College Station, TX: StataCorp
LLC.).
Ethical approval
The protocol and manuscript for this study were reviewed and approved by the
National COVID-19 Research Committee in Bahrain. This committee has been jointly
established by the Bahrain Ministry of Health and Bahrain Defence Force Hospital
research committees in response to the pandemic, to facilitate and monitor COVID-19
research in Bahrain. All methods and retrospective analysis of data was approved by
the National COVID-19 Research and Ethics Committee, and carried out in accordance

Committee for this study due to its retrospective and observational nature and the
absence of any patient identifying information.
Results

1792 cases were included. During the study period from 24th of February 2020 until 31st of
July 2020; a total of 38 patients diagnosed with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) were admitted with
SARS Cov-2 infection. The outcomes of these patients were compared to a randomly selected
control group of 1754 patients diagnosed with SARS Cov-2 during the same study period.

There were a number of significant differences between the two groups (Table 1, 2, 3).
The mean age of the SCD group was 35.5 years in comparison to 46.2 in the non-SCD
group. 28.9% of the SCD group were males while 59.6% were males in the non-SCD
group. All the SCD cases were Bahraini nationals, compared to 55.7% in the non-SCD
group. Mean age, proportion of males, Bahraini nationals and G6PD deficiency status
were significantly different in SCD cases and non-cases. It was also evident that diabetes
and hypertension were more common in the control group. In the SCD group, 13.2%
were diabetic compared to 29.2% in the non-SCD group, similarly, 13.2% of the SCD
cases were hypertensive compared compared to 30.1% of the non-SCD group. On the
other hand, G6PD deficiency was more prevalent within the SCD group (44.7%) while
only 9% of the non-SCD patients had this deficiency. All these differences were
statistically significant with p-value <0.05 . The prevalence of cardiovascular disease was
similar across both groups (10% and 10.5%).
Results also demonstrated that patients who had SCD had additional comorbidities. In
the SCD group, 44.7% were diagnosed with at least one other comorbidity and 13.2%
had three or more other co-morbidities in contrast to the 24.1% and 10.4% respectively
in the non-SCD group.

The characteristics of the studied sample are summarized in Tables 1 to 3
Among the 33 (71.1%) of the symptomatic SCD patients, cough was the most common
symptom (47.4%), followed by fever (42.1%). On the other hand, 1108 (63.2%) of nonSCD patients were symptomatic with similar common symptoms of cough (41.9%) and
fever (21.9%).
Of the SCD group, 33 (89.2%) patients were admitted on room air, and 4 (10.8%) patients
were admitted with oxygen support. None of the SCD patients admitted required further
support on admission. Among the non-SCD patients, 1542 (87.9%) were admitted on
room air, 201 (11.5%) on oxygen support, 8 (0.5%) on NIV/HFNC and 3 (0.2%) required
mechanical ventilation (MV).
Disease outcomes:
In the SCD group, one (2.6%) patient required NIV/HFNC, one (2.6%) required MV and
one (2.6%) death occurred. In comparison, 56 (3.2%) of the non-SCD patients required
NIV/HFNC, 47 (2.7%) required MV and mortality was seen in 58 (3.3%). The outcomes
are summarized in Table 4.
Primary outcome
The primary outcome of the study is to evaluate the composite outcome of the
requirement for ventilation (invasive or noninvasive) or death or mortality (Table 5). The
total number of patients who developed the primary outcome in both groups is 112/1792
(6.3%), of which 3/38 (7.9%) were in the SCD group and 109/1754 (6.2%) in the nonSCD group. The unadjusted odds ratio for SCD patients developing the primary outcome
was 1.29 (95% CI: 0.39 – 4.27; p=0.67). Upon adjusting for confounders, we found the
odds ratio to be 2.06 (95% CI: 0.43 – 9.95; p= 0.37). Table 5 summarizes these.
Secondary outcome

The secondary outcome of the study was the requirement of oxygenation on
presentation (Table 6). The total number of patients who required oxygenation upon
presentation was 12.1% (216/1792), of which 7.9% (4/38) were from the SCD group and
12.1% (212/1754) were from the non-SCD group. The unadjusted odds ratio was found
to be 0.85 (95% CI: 0.30 – 2.44, p=0.77). The adjusted odds ratio was found to be 1.39
(95% CI: 0.41 – 4.6; p= 0.59).
Complete output and additional details on the models are available in the Appendix.
Discussion
In this cohort study, SCD was not observed to be significantly associated with
developing the primary composite outcome (requirement of NIV/HFNC/MV or death) in
COVID-19 patients. SCD patients also did not have significantly higher odds of requiring
oxygenation upon admission to the hospital as compared to non-SCD patients.
Upon analyzing the baseline characteristics of both groups, it was evident that there
were significant differences in multiple domains. The non-SCD population was on
average older than the SCD group. The younger mean age in SCD patients can be
explained by the nature of the disease resulting in a reduced life expectancy22. Age has
been reported to be associated with severe disease progression in COVID-1923. Most
studies referred to age more than 60 years to increase the risk of worse outcomes. A
study aiming to quantify the isolated effect of age on the severity of COVID-19 outcomes
concluded a minimal influence after adjusting for important age-dependent risk factors
(for example: diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease etc.)24. On that account,
although our study showed a difference of 10 years between the two groups, this might
not have an actual effect on disease outcomes (since mean age was 46 and 35 years in
the non-SCD and SCD groups, respectively). Regardless, age was adjusted for in the
analysis conducted in this study.
All SCD patients were Bahraini nationals, compared to 55% of the patients in the nonSCD group. SCD is a genetic disorder that affects around 75,000 Bahrainis11,25. Bahrain

has a wide range of nationalities and around 50% of Bahrain’s population comprises
expatriate workers (with the majority being from Asian nationalities)25. SCD is a very rare
disease within these countries26,27 and hence this can explain the nationality difference
observed. In addition, the majority of expatriate workers are male majority25 and this
accounted for the male predominance observed in the non-SCD group. Moreover this
difference in gender distribution can be explained by the increased female prevalence of
COVID-19 patients with hemoglobinopathies. A multicenter study by de Sanctis et. al28
and another study by Panepinto et al29 established increased female prevalence (76.9%
and 57% respectively) of COVID-19 infection among patients with hemoglobinopathies.
Among the comorbidities evaluated in all patients with COVID-19, results
demonstrated that almost half of those with SCD were found to have G6PD deficiency
in contrast to a minority in the control group. Some studies claim that G6PD deficiency
incidence is more abundant in patients with SCD in comparison to the general
population30. In addition, many studies have established the association of such
inherited diseases due to the high rates of consanguineous marriages in the gulf
region31. Further research on G6PD and COVID-19 outcomes is required to understand
more on the topic.
On a different note, patients in the non-SCD group were found to be mostly comorbid
with diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN), this could be attributed to the
older age of the population32. The higher prevalence of DM and HTN increased the
baseline risk of the non-SCD group to develop severe COVID-19 outcomes5–7.
One of the remarkable findings in this study was the significant variation in symptom
presentation. Although the majority of patients in both groups did present with cough,
SCD patients presented more expressively with fever. This may be attributed to the
natural history of the disease where it creates an environment supporting infections33,
although the presence of other causes of fever were not explored in this study.

COVID-19 infection has a broad clinical presentation; ranging from asymptomatic to
severe forms of respiratory disease which can lead to death34. Few studies have been
published studying the correlation between SCD and the severity of COVID-19 infection.
A study by Panepinto et al29 explored COVID-19 disease outcome in SCD patients living
in the United States during the period March – May 2020. It concluded that this group of
patients had increased risk of severe disease outcome as well as an increased mortality
with 69% hospitalization rate, 11% ICU admission rate and 7% mortality rate. These
were higher when compared to COVID-19 outcomes in the general population from a
similar time period where hospitalization rate was 14%, ICU admission rate 2.3% and
mortality rate 5.4%35.
Moreover, within the United States African American community, COVID-19 patients
with SCD had higher rates of death from COVID-19 than those without SCD, as
reported by Lana Mucalo et al at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) virtual
meeting. Their study indicated that this population had 6.2 times the risk for COVID-19related mortality36.
Another study, however, by Ashima Singh et al, indicated that African American
individuals with SCD had similar risk of COVID-19-related mortality as those without
SCD, after balancing for age, gender and other pre-existing conditions. Their study did
report that SCD imposes additional risk of severe COVID-19 illness and
hospitalization37.
In our study, SCD patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection did not have a
significant increase in risk for worse disease outcomes in comparison to the non-SCD
patients. Similarly, SCD patients with COVID-19 did not have increased risk for
requirement of oxygenation upon admission as compared those without SCD.
We have previously reported the disease outcomes in a case series of all SCD patients
infected with COVID-19 between February and April 2020 in Bahrain. Six patients with
SCD had COVID-19: three remained asymptomatic; two had mild symptoms and only
one patient required oxygen support. The SCD patients had a similar average length of

stay when compared with non-SCD COVID-19 patients38. Other studies also showed
similar results. Chakravotry et al39 explored COVID-19 disease outcomes of 10 SCD
patients in a tertiary hospital in the United Kingdom. The study demonstrated that most
patients had mild disease with 80% not requiring oxygen and the remaining 20%
requiring only a nasal cannula. Only one mortality case was described in a 54-year old
female that had severe pre-existing lung disease and history of previous admissions to
the intensive therapy unit within the past year. Likewise, Faiz A et al40 presented a case
series of four SCD patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. Three cases had mild
disease and only one patient required oxygenation. All cases were discharged without
mortalities.
Another case series by Ramachandran et al established low morbidity and mortality
with COVID-19 in SCD patients. Among the nine SCD patients, only one required ICU
admission but without the need for intubation. All cases were discharged and no
deaths were observed41.
It is important to consider the sample used for this study as it represents hospitalized
cases only. It is possible that other SCD patients remained in home isolation and did
not require hospitalization and hence not included. Nevertheless, this would have not
affected the results of this study. If these cases were included, the results would have
moved more towards the null hypothesis.
STRENGTHS
The study has several strengths; it involved the majority of hospitals that provided acute
care for hospitalized COVID-19 cases in Bahrain. Furthermore, our study included all
SCD cases admitted in the study time period allocated at the involved centres. The data
collection process was done manually, hence, all patients’ files were reviewed carefully
and all documented details were collected. The study represents the only study
conducted in the region to explore the relationship between SCD and COVID-19.

LIMITATIONS
Since the study includes severe COVID-19 disease patients requiring hospitalization,
inference on milder COVID-19 infections cannot be drawn from these results. Secondly,
given the retrospective design, information that was not documented in EMR and was
not available for analysis, could be potential confounders. These included: time from
symptom onset, inflammatory markers and frequency of admission of SCD patients. This
research did not study other relevant outcomes related to sickle cell disease including
hemolysis, vaso-occlusive crisis, and other SCD crises. The genotype of sickle cell
disease patient was not stratified as data on that wasn’t readily available.
CONCLUSION
Our results showed no significant increased risk of adverse COVID-19 outcome in SCD
patients as compared to non-SCD patients. Further studies on this topic are warranted
in order to have conclusive evidence on SCD and the risk of COVID-19 outcomes.
