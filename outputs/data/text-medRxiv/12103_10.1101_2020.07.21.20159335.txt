Abstract:

19

New Zealand had 1499 cases of COVID-19 before eliminating transmission of the

20

virus. Extensive contract tracing during the outbreak has resulted in a dataset of

21

epidemiologically linked cases. This data contains useful information about the

22

transmission dynamics of the virus, its dependence on factors such as age, and its

23

response to different control measures.

24

We use Monte-Carlo network construction techniques to provide an estimate of the

25

number of secondary cases for every individual infected during the outbreak. We then

26

apply standard statistical techniques to quantify differences between groups of

27

individuals.

28

Children under 10 years old are significantly under-represented in the case data.

29

Children infected fewer people on average and had a lower secondary attack rate in

30

comparison to adults and the elderly. Imported cases infected fewer people on

31

average and had a lower secondary attack rate than domestically acquired cases.

32

Superspreading is a significant contributor to the epidemic dynamics, with 20% of

33

cases among adults responsible for 65-85% of transmission. Asymptomatic cases

34

infected fewer individuals than clinical cases. Serial intervals are approximately

35

normally distributed (ùúá = 5.0 days, ùúé = 5.7 days). Early isolation and quarantine of

36

cases reduced secondary transmission rates.

37

Border controls and strong social distancing measures, particularly when targeted at

38

superspreading, play a significant role in reducing the spread of COVID-19.

Introduction

41

Between 26 February and 22 May 2020, New Zealand recorded 1499 confirmed and

42

probable cases of COVID-19 (Figure 1). Of these, 575 had a recent history of overseas

43

travel. With the exception of international arrivals, which are subject to mandatory 14-

44

day quarantine, no community cases were reported from 22 May to 10 August. This

45

means that New Zealand has a high probability of having eliminated community

46

transmission during this period.

50

without (orange).

51
52

Progressively stricter border measures were introduced from mid-March to mid-April.

53

From 16 March, all international arrivals to New Zealand were required to go into 14

54

days self-isolation. On 20 March, the border was closed to non-citizens and non-

55

residents. From 10 April, all international arrivals were required to go into 14 day

56

mandatory government-managed quarantine.

57

On 19 March, gatherings of more than 100 people were banned and, on 21 March, a

58

four-level alert level system was introduced. Alert level 1 was effectively business as

59

usual but with border restrictions. New Zealand entered alert level 2 on 21 March, level

60

3 on 23 March, and level 4 on 26 March. Alert level 4 included strict stay-at-home

61

measures, and all non-essential business and schools were closed. The country

62

remained at alert level 4 until 28 April, when it moved to level 3 allowing partial school

63

openings and non-essential businesses to operate under strict non-contact guidelines.

64

On 14 May, New Zealand moved to alert level 2 and most schools and businesses

65

reopened but large gatherings were still banned. On 9 June, the country moved back

66

to alert level 1 and a strict testing programme for international arrivals was established

67

to complement the ongoing 14-day mandatory quarantine.

68

New Zealand also has a widespread testing regime that quickly encouraged testing of

69

anyone with even minor symptoms. Up to 5 June (2 weeks after the last reported

70

domestic case on 22 May), 291,994 tests were performed (58 tests per 1000 people)

71

with a positivity rate of around 0.4% (Ministry of Health, 2020). Since mid-June, all

72

international arrivals are tested on day three and day twelve, and are not permitted to

73

leave their 14-day mandatory quarantine before returning a negative test result.

74

Mathematical models of COVID-19 transmission and control measures have

75

estimated that the effective reproduction number ùëÖùëíùëìùëì decreased from around 1.8 prior

76

to alert level 4 to around 0.35 during alert level 4[1]. However, these results may

77

depend on modelling assumptions, for example the assumed generation time

78

distribution, the delay between infection, symptom onset and testing, and the effects

79

of case-targeted control.

80

In this paper, we examine the epidemic transmission tree in New Zealand using

81

detailed case data and contact tracing information. This is an unusual dataset because

82

it describes a closed outbreak in which there are no ongoing transmission chains, and

83

many cases are epidemiologically linked to a likely index case. Because not all cases

84

have a potential index case identified and some cases have multiple potential index

85

cases, the transmission tree is not completely or uniquely defined. We reconstruct

86

multiple instances of the transmission tree using a Monte-Carlo technique. This

87

approach assigns a randomly selected index case to each secondary case based on

88

the dates of symptom onset, cluster identification, and the results of contact tracing

89

investigations. We assume a fixed proportion of infections were undetected because

90

they were asymptomatic, paucisymptomatic, or for some other reason.

91

From this suite of generated transmission trees, we calculate the individual

92

reproduction number ùëÖùëñ for each infected individual and explore the distribution of ùëÖùëñ

93

and the secondary attack rate at different points in the epidemic timeline. We explore

94

how these quantities vary for different age groups and types of case, imported or

95

domestic, and investigate the effect of early case isolation. We also investigate the

96

degree of superspreading in the transmission dynamics. Although some assumptions

97

are required to allow for missing or noisy data, our results are not model-dependent,

98

unlike most estimates of effective reproduction number for COVID-19 [2] [3, 4]. Our

99

sample size is larger than previous studies that have estimated the secondary attack

100

rate (e.g. Bi, Wu (5), Ganyani, Kremer (6), Cheng, Jian (7)). This allows for more

101

reliable estimates and for an investigation of how secondary attack rate varies with

102

age. We also reconstruct the entire transmission tree rather than just estimating of the

103

serial interval distribution. This provides a richer source of information about the

104

transmission dynamics, allowing a more complete set of epidemiological parameters

105

to be explored.

106

Methods

107

Of the 1499 confirmed and probable cases, 575 had a recent history of overseas travel

108

and were considered to be imported cases. The remaining 924 cases were considered

109

to be infected within New Zealand and are referred to as domestic cases. Following

110

contact tracing interviews, 636 of the domestic cases were each assigned up to five

111

potential index cases. The remaining domestic cases did not have a potential index

112

case identified. 627 of the domestic cases were linked to one of 18 significant clusters.

113

Of the cases linked to clusters, 146 had no potential index case identified. For 1444

114

cases, the number of close contacts, obtained via case recall at a contact tracing

115

interview, was recorded. The number of close contacts varied widely between

116

individuals, e.g. 753 cases had 2 or fewer contacts and 26 cases had more than 50.

117

31 cases were recorded as being asymptomatic at the time of testing. All cases

118

recorded age.

119

We constructed a potential instance of the transmission tree by randomly assigning a

120

symptom onset date to each of the ùëñ cases using the date recorded by case recall, ùê∑ùëñ ,

121

(if available) with a random offset, ùê∑ùëñ = ùê∑ùëñ + ùëãùëñ where ùëãùëñ ~ùëÅ(ùúá = 0, ùúé = 1). For the 38

122

cases with no onset date recorded (31 asymptomatic, 7 symptomatic) we assigned a

123

randomly generated onset date using the reported date and a gamma distribution fitted

124

to the data on time from onset to reporting, Œì(ùúá = 6.7, ùúé = 5.4) days.

125

In addition to the 31 recorded asymptomatic cases, each generated transmission tree

126

included additional subclinical or asymptomatic cases so that the total proportion of

127

asymptomatic cases was ùëùùëéùë†ùë¶ùëöùëù = 0.33 on average. These additional cases were

128

randomly sampled from the recorded cases with the symptom onset date randomly

129

jittered ùê∑ùëñ = ùê∑ùëñ + ùëãùëñ where ùëãùëñ ~ùëÅ(ùúá = 0, ùúé = 2). Model-generated asymptomatic cases

130

had the same cluster status and potential index cases as the sampled case.

131

Of the domestic cases, 17 had a unique index case identified in the data. For the 288

132

cases with no index case, an index case was selected based on the implied serial

133

interval, i.e. the time between symptom onset in the index case and in the secondary

134

case. The serial interval ùëÜùêº can be expressed as

135

ùëÜùêº = ùê∫ùëá ‚àí ùêº1 + ùêº2

136

where ùê∫ùëá is the generation time (time from infection of index case to infection of

137

secondary case), and ùêº1 and ùêº2 are the incubation periods of the index and secondary

138

case respectively. We assume that the generation time ùê∫ùëá~ùëäùëíùëñùëèùë¢ùëôùëô(ùúá = 5.05, ùúé =

139

1.93) days[8] and the incubation period ùêºùëó ~Œì(ùúá = 5.5, ùúé = 2.28) days[9] and use this to

140

calculate the probability density function for the serial interval ùëì(ùëÜùêº). Note that although

141

the generation time must be positive, there is a positive probability of a negative serial

142

interval.

143

For the 619 domestic cases with ùëõ > 1 potential index cases, the serial interval ùëÜùêºùëó

144

corresponding to each potential index case ùëó = 1, ‚Ä¶ ùëõ was calculated. Potential index

145

case ùëó was selected as the index case with probability ùëÉùëó = ùëì(ùëÜùêºùëó )/ ‚àëùëõùëó=1 ùëì(ùëÜùêºùëó ). For

146

cases with no potential index case identified, all cases in the same cluster (or the no

147

cluster group if appropriate) were assumed to be potential index cases and the same

148

random selection method was used. The probability ùëÉùëó defined above was assumed

149

to be independent of whether the potential cases was symptomatic or asymptomatic.

150

Assigning an index case to each secondary case produces a single instance of the

151

epidemic transmission tree. We then repeated this Monte Carlo process to produce

152

ùëÄ = 500 independent instances of the transmission tree. For each instance, we

153

calculated the number of secondary cases resulting from each reported case (the

154

reproduction number ùëÖùëñùëó for individual ùëñ in transmission tree ùëó) and the associated

155

symptom onset date, ùê∑ùëñùëó .

156

Incidence by age The original case data, including clinical and asymptomatic cases,

157

was split by imported status and time period. The reported statistic is the probability of

158

being in each age bracket within that group and the 95% binomial confidence interval.

159

NZ population statistics are shown as benchmarks.

160

Resulting serial interval The resulting serial interval distribution across all ùëÄ

161

transmission trees was fitted with a normal distribution.

162

Time varying effective reproduction number We calculated the mean reproduction

163

number for all clinical individuals, split by imported status with onset that day (which is

164

approximately equivalent to peak infectiousness) in transmission tree ùëó. The reported

165

statistic is the median and 95% range over the ùëÄ transmission trees.

166

Reproduction number and superspreading We fitted a negative binomial

167

distribution to the effective reproduction numbers in each transmission tree separately

168

for clinical individuals of different groups (age and domestic/imported status) and with

169

onset date ùê∑ùëñùëó in different time periods for each transmission tree. This gave an

170

estimate of the mean effective reproduction number ùëÖÃÖùëó for that group of cases in the

171

ùëóth transmission tree, and the associated dispersion or superspreading parameter

172

ùëòùëó [10]. We also calculated the probability of causing no secondary infections or more

173

than 5 secondary infections for each tree. The reported statistic is the median and

174

95% range over the ùëÄ transmission trees. If a negative binomial could not be fitted to

175

a particular instance a Poisson distribution was used instead (i.e. ùëò = ‚àû).

176

Secondary attack rate Secondary attack rates of clinical individuals were calculated

177

for each group in each transmission tree by pooling the total number of secondary

178

cases and the total number of contacts [11]

The reported statistic is the median and 95% range over the ùëÄ transmission trees.

181

Effect of early isolation We used a general linear model to predict ùëÖÃÖùëñ , the expected

182

reproduction number for each clinical individual across all ùëó trees, accounting for days

183

between the original recorded symptom onset and isolation, i.e. number of days for

184

which the individual was infectious and not isolated or quarantined. Initial exploration

185

showed no significant difference between adults and elderly so these groups were

186

combined, children (under 10 years) were significantly different. Imported or domestic

187

status was significant (ùëù < 0.05). The number of contacts variable was also explored

188

but this was strongly correlated with the number of infectious days which was a better

189

predictor variable judged by the ùëù-value for each coefficient (Matlab 2018b,

190

stepwiseglm). The final model was

191

log(ùëÖÃÖùëñ ) ~(ùë†ùë¶ùëöùëùùë°ùëúùëö ùëúùëõùë†ùëíùë° ‚àí ùëñùë†ùëúùëôùëéùë°ùëñùëúùëõ)2 + ùêºùë† ùëê‚Ñéùëñùëôùëë + ùêºùë† ùëñùëöùëùùëúùëüùë°ùëíùëë.

192

In the regression cases with ùëÖÃÖùëñ = 0 (i.e. with no secondary cases in any of the ùëÄ

193

instances) were offset to half the minimum value of ùëÖÃÖùëñ in the dataset. The results are

194

presented graphically for an individual with the expected number of contacts.

Results

197

One instance of the reconstruction of New Zealand‚Äôs nine largest clusters is shown in

198

Figure 2. These clusters were associated with settings typical of international patterns,

199

including a high school, a wedding, hospitality venues, aged residential care facilities,

200

and a conference. The age distribution of cases varies across these clusters

201

(Supplementary Figure S1). Although one of New Zealand‚Äôs largest clusters was

202

associated with a school (Marist College cluster), more than half of the cases (55/96)

203

in this cluster were in individuals over 20 years old. Of the 41 cases under 20, 35 were

204

aged 10‚Äì20 years with only 6 confirmed cases in under 10s. In the two largest clusters

205

associated with aged residential care facilities, there was as expected an over-

206

representation of cases over 80 years old. However, the majority of cases in both

207

these clusters (36/56 and 44/51 respectively) were under 65 years old, suggesting that

208

staff and visitors are a more important driver of transmission than residents in aged

209

residential care.

221

Incidence by age

222

We investigated COVID-19 incidence by age by splitting the clinical cases into three

223

age groups: under 10 years, 0-65 years, and over 65 years. We consider domestic

224

and imported cases separately and further split the data by significant time periods:

225

before and after alert level 4 was introduced (26 March) for the domestic cases; and

226

during three distinct periods of border control for imported cases: no restrictions

227

(before 16 March), self-isolation (16 March to 9 April) and government-mandated

228

quarantine (after 9 April).

229

Children under 10 are significantly under-represented in the case data relative to the

230

New Zealand population demographic of 12.7% (Figure 3). The domestic cases (Fig

231

3 A,B) contain relatively more children under 10 than the imported cases and these

232

infections predominantly occurred during alert level 4 (2.6% of cases were in children

233

before 26 March, 4.4% on or after 26 March). During alert level 4, schools and day

234

care centres were closed so children are likely to have spent more time in family

235

settings where attack rates are higher [5] resulting in a higher incidence for this group.

236

Of the 576 imported cases (Fig 3 C-E), only 2 were in children under 10 years old.

237

Both these cases were connected with an imported adult case with the same travel

238

history and symptom onset 4 to 7 days prior.

Serial interval distribution

246

The distribution of serial intervals (Figure 4) resulting from the Monte Carlo

247

reconstruction contained a substantial number of outliers. It is likely these correspond

248

to cases that were infected by an undetected case, or the index case was wrongly

249

assigned either in the data or in the reconstructed tree. Including all serial intervals

250

from the reconstructed tree, the best fit normal distribution had mean 5.0 days and

251

standard deviation 5.7 days. Excluding outliers (serial intervals longer than 20 days)

252

resulted in mean 4.4 days and standard deviation 4.7 days. This is comparable with

253

previous estimates of the mean serial interval [12, 13]. When allowing for negative

the serial interval to be 3.86 ¬± 4.76 days (mean ¬± std. dev.) for Singapore and 2.90 ¬±

256

4.88 days for Tianjin, China. These estimates for the mean serial interval are shorter

257

than ours, but the finding that a significant proportion of serial intervals were negative

258

is consistent. The data we analysed and that of Ganyani, Kremer (6) were collected in

259

the presence of case isolation and contact tracing. It is likely these interventions will

260

reduce the mean serial interval, to varying extents, by suppressing transmission late

261

in the infectious period. Our results reflect the serial interval distribution in the

262

presence of these interventions in the New Zealand context.

index cases) (Figure 5A). During and after alert level 4 (26 March onwards), this

272

dropped to ùëÖùëíùëìùëì = 0.69 (521 index cases). In the period after alert level 4, the vast

273

majority of cases were detected as part of contact tracing efforts and were isolated

274

swiftly, often before symptom onset. The reproduction number for domestic cases

275

showed two small peaks during the alert level 4 period. The first coincided with Easter

276

weekend (10-13 April). The second coincides with a long weekend (25-27 April)

277

immediately preceding the pre-announced easing of restrictions on 28 April.

278

For imported cases (Figure 5B), the number of secondary infections per case was

279

much lower throughout the outbreak. Before self-isolation for international arrivals was

280

introduced on 16 March, ùëÖùëíùëìùëì = 0.70 (119 index cases). While self-isolation was in

281

place from 17 March to 9 April, ùëÖùëíùëìùëì = 0.42 (439 index cases). After mandatory

282

government-managed quarantine was introduced on 10 April, ùëÖùëíùëìùëì = 0.08 (7 cases).

Imported cases had a lower effective reproduction number than domestic cases. The

296

Effect of age on reproduction number and superspreading

297

Before the move to alert level 4, over half of all domestic cases resulted in at least one

298

secondary case (Figure 5A). The proportion of cases resulting in at least one

299

secondary case was similar for all age groups (Table 1). The expected number of

300

secondary cases was ùëÖùëíùëìùëì = 0.87 for the under 10 years age group, ùëÖùëíùëìùëì = 1.49 for

301

the 10 to 65 years age group, and ùëÖùëíùëìùëì = 1.51 for the over 65 years age group.

302

Although children under 10 were equally likely to infect at least one person, adults

303

tended to infect more people than children under 10 did. Cases among adults and

304

older people also had a significant chance of being a superspreader (which we defined

305

as infecting more than 5 people): 6% in the 10 to 65 year age group, and 7% in the

306

over 65 age group.

307

During alert level 4 (Fig. 5B, Table 1), ùëÖùëíùëìùëì dropped below 1 for the under 10 and the

308

10 to 65 age groups, but stayed above 1 in over 65 group. This may be due to the

309

over-representation of cases in aged care facilities in the later stages of the epidemic,

310

where it may be more difficult to limit interactions. The proportion of superspreaders

311

decreased in adults during alert level 4 but not in the elderly. There were no recorded

312

superspreaders under 10 years old at any stage in the epidemic.

318
319

Overall, there were 29 superspreaders, of which 21 had symptom onset before alert

320

level 4 began, and the remaining 8 had symptom onset during alert level 4. Of these,

321

the 6 most recent events were all related to clusters of cases at aged care facilities.

322

As seen previously, imported cases overall had a lower ùëÖùëíùëìùëì than domestic cases

323

(Figure 6C-E). Before the introduction of any border measures, many of these cases

324

would have been tourists and other visitors who are less likely to have the close

325

community contacts that local residents have. Throughout the outbreak, imported

326

cases in the over 65 years age group had a higher ùëÖùëíùëìùëì than those aged 10 ‚Äì 65.

327

Imported cases in children, of which there were only 2 (<1%), had the lowest likelihood

328

of being an index case even accounting for both these cases happening during the

329

mandatory quarantine period. There were 5 superspreaders amongst the imported

330

cases, all of which occurred during the self-isolation period between 9 and 19 March.

331

The degree of superspreading in the transmission dynamics can be quantified by the

332

variance in the distribution of individual reproduction numbers ùëÖÃÖùëñ . This can be

333

measured by the dispersion parameter ùëò of a negative binomial distribution fitted to

334

the data [10, 14]. The smaller the value of ùëò, the more heavy-tailed the distribution of

335

secondary cases, and therefore the more superspreading is driving the transmission

336

process. The results show that older age groups tend to be have more superspreading

337

than younger ones (Table 1). This could be influenced partly by the number of cases

338

transmitted in aged residential care facilities. Among the 10-65 and over 65 year age

339

groups, the estimated values of ùëò range from 0.27 to 0.70. This means that 20% of

340

cases are responsible for between 65% and 85% of transmission.

341

Secondary attack rate

342

In all case groups, children under 10 years old had a lower secondary attack rate than

343

the older age groups (Figure 7). For domestic cases in the under 10 and the 10‚Äì65

344

age groups, there was very little difference in secondary attack rate before and during

345

alert level 4, despite contacts being largely confined to the home setting which has a

346

higher attack rate [5]. The secondary attack rate for elderly people did show a large

347

increase during alert level 4. This likely reflects the number of cases that occurred in

348

aged care facilities rather than private households.

349

Overall, the secondary attack rate for imported cases was much lower than for

350

domestic cases, particularly during the period before introduction of border measures.

351

This is likely due to this group including a high proportion of visiting tourists for whom

352

most contacts are in a casual rather than home or work setting. The secondary attack

353

rate for imported cases increased after the self-isolation measures were introduced,

354

possibly reflecting the environment and make-up of these groups. However, the

355

secondary attack rate dropped significantly during the mandatory quarantine period.

356

The lack of a clear effect of control measures on secondary attack rates suggests that

357

reduction in the reproduction number was achieved primarily by reducing the number

358

of close contacts rather than by reducing the likelihood of transmission when close

359

contacts did occur.

Figure 8 shows the general linear model for the relationship between the individual

shows that cases that were isolated earlier, relative to symptom onset, tended to infect

376

fewer people. Accounting for overseas status and number of infectious days before

377

isolation or quarantine children infect, on average, 62% the individuals that adults and

378

the elderly infect (ùëù = 0.09). Imported cases infect 70% of the number of secondary

379

cases in comparison to domestic cases (ùëù = 10‚àí5 ).

Asymptomatic cases

Of the 31 cases (21 domestic, 10 imported) recorded as asymptomatic, 30 were in

adults and older people. Before the move to alert level 4, these cases had ùëÖùëíùëìùëì of

384

approximately 50% of the adult domestic clinical cases (Table 1). During alert level 4,

385

this dropped slightly further but the drop was not as significant as or the clinical cases

during this time.

Discussion

396

We analysed the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 using a comprehensive dataset

397

for a completed outbreak. Our analysis investigated the role of age and type of case

398

(imported or domestic) on reproduction number, secondary attack rate, likelihood of

399

superspreading. We also investigated the effect of various control measures, including

400

case isolation, population-wide restrictions, and self-isolation or quarantine of

401

international arrivals.

402

We found that children under 10 years contribute less to the spread of COVID-19 than

403

other age groups. Children under 10 infected fewer people on average, had a lower

404

secondary attack rate, and were less likely to be superspreaders. This is consistent

405

with existing evidence on the role of children in COVID-19 transmission [15, 16].

406

The finding that superspreading is a significant contributor to transmission is

407

consistent with existing empirical and modelling studies [17] [18] [19]. Our results show

408

that among adults 20% of cases are responsible for between 65% and 85% of

409

transmission. This suggests that interventions targeting superspreaders or

410

superspreading events may be particularly effective in reducing the spread of COVID-

411

19. These may include restrictions on gathering size, particularly in closed

412

environments or crowded spaces [17].

413

In the dataset we used to reconstruct epidemic transmission tree, the index case is

414

either missing or not uniquely identified in some cases. It is also likely there were

415

asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic cases that were undetected. We therefore used

416

Monte Carlo methods to reconstruct missing cases and missing transmission routes

417

(nodes and links respectively in the epidemic tree). It is possible that phylodynamic

418

data on the genetic sequence of the virus recovered from positive test results could
