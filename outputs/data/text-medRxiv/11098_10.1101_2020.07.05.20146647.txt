Abstract
In December 2019 a severe acute respiratory syndrome now known as SARS-CoV-2 began to surge in Wuhan, China. The virus soon spread throughout the world to become a
pandemic. Since the outbreak various measures were put in place to contain and control
the spread, these interventions were mostly based on compartmental models in epidemiology
with the main goal of controlling and monitoring the rate of the basic and effective reproduction number. In this paper, we propose an SEIR model where we incorporate contact tracing
and age-structured social mixing. We show the explicit relation between contact tracing and
social mixing and other relevant parameters of the proposed model. We derive a formula
for the effective reproduction number which is expressed in terms of reported cases, tracing
quantities and social mixing. We use this formula to determine the expectation value of the
effective reproduction number in London, UK.

Introduction

1

COVID-19 is a fast-spreading infectious disease which is caused by the novel coronavirus SARSCOV-2 [1, 2]. The rapid rate of the spread and lack of preparation soon translated to a pandemic
causing major disruption globally [3, 4]. From the early days of the spread, many well-established
models were proposed to contain and control the outbreak. These models were mainly the
extensions of the simple SIR model [5]-[11] where the population is being divided into susceptible,
infected and recovered compartments. Various parameters can be incorporated into the models
to study and analyse the effect of intervention methods and also to predict the spread of the
infectious disease.
In this paper, we propose an SEIR model integrated with contact tracing and age-structured
social mixing. Contact tracing is an important intervention method when it comes to controlling
an infectious outbreak [12]. As the name suggests it involves tracing the contacts of a reported
infectious individual and remove them into isolation if needed, so further spread would be prevented. There are numerous methods of contact tracing and this intervention strategy proved
to be effective in controlling the COVID-19 outbreak in countries such as China, South Korea,
Taiwan and Japan [14]-[16]. In this study, we adopt contact tracing appropriate to the characteristics of the COVID-19. It is now established that infected individuals with the COVID-19
are distinguished into two groups of asymptomatic and symptomatic [17]. The asymptomatic
individuals are infectious individuals who show no symptoms while symptomatic individuals are
those who show symptoms, and hence are reported and might need hospitalisation. To this end,
our model traces the contact of those individuals who are symptomatic and reported. The rationale of the model is that if the the traced contacts show symptoms they will be removed into

isolation, and if they do not show symptoms upon tracing they will be monitored by healthcare
workers or via a mobile application for the recommended time of two weeks by the WHO [12].
Another feature that we integrate into our model is age-structured social mixing matrix.
This component of the model is important when it comes to effectively classifying the risk within
different age groups in a society. One of the known characteristics of the COVID-19 is that it
affects mid-age and elderly people more severely than those who are in the young age group
[18]. As a result, to implement interventions such as social-distancing within households or at
workplaces, it is important to know the mixing between different age groups. In this work,
we show the theoretical scaling effect of the social mixing matrix on the value of the effective
reproduction number.
We begin by giving an overview of the SEIR model in section 2.1, we then incorporate contact
tracing and social mixing respectively into our model in sections 2.2 and 2.3. We then analyse
our results in section 3 and provide a deterministic formula for keeping the effective reproduction
number below one. We calculate the change in the effective reproduction number when contact
tracing and social mixing are involved. In section 3.1 we provide an example where we determine
the value of the expected effective reproduction number for London, United Kingdom (UK).

Model and Methods
Toy SEIR model

We begin by considering a simple and adequate SEIR compartmental model which captures the
essence of the spread of the COVID-19 through a homogenous population. In this model, the
population N is the the sum of Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Symptomatic (Is ), Asymptomatic
(Ia ) and Recovered (R) individuals (i.e. N = S + E + Is + Ia + R). By definition, exposed
individuals are those incubating the disease and will be infected by the symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, symptomatic individuals are those who are infected, show symptoms and
will be reported or hospitalised, asymptomatic infected individuals are those who have mild or
no symptoms and hence will not be reported and do not require hospitalisation. Both infected
groups will eventually move into the recovered compartment, which includes recovered and dead
cases. The system of the ordinary differential equations (ODE) which describe the dynamics of
this model is,

(2.1)

The ODEs are parameterised by β which is the transmission rate for infectious individuals, μ that
is the multiplicative factor reducing the transmission rate of the asymptomatic infected patients,
τ , the mean incubation period in days, α, the fraction of the reported/hospitalised cases, Ts , the
time from symptom onset until hospitalisation/isolation or reporting in days and Ta , the mean
infectious period in days for the asymptomatic individuals. Note that Ts is the same for the
cases which are hospitalised, go to isolation or just being reported. The distinction of infected
individuals into two groups is essential in this work as in reality only the symptomatic cased are
being recorded and hence can trigger contact tracing [31]. Note that there are studies that take
Ts and Ta as equal [32].

The basic reproduction number R0 is defined as average number of secondary infections produced by an infected individual in a population where everyone is susceptible, this number is
used to measure the transmission potential of a disease. In a realistic world a population can
rarely be wholly susceptible. Some individuals can be immune, for instance due to prior infection. As a result, not all contacts will become infected and the average number of secondary
cases per an infectious case will be lower than the basic reproduction number. To this end, the
effective reproduction number Re is defined as the average number of secondary cases in a population made up of both susceptible and non-susceptible individuals. The effective reproduction
number is proportional to the product of the basic reproduction number and the fraction of the
host population that is susceptible. Using the next generation matrix method [19] the effective
reproduction number, Re , is calculated by
KL = −TΣ−1

(2.2)

where the matrix T corresponds to transmissions and the matrix Σ corresponds to transitions.
Note that all the epidemiological events that lead to new infections are incorporated in the
model via T and the rest of the events via Σ, hence progress to either dead or recovery makes
Σ invertible. We obtain KL as,

(2.4)

where R0 = βTa is defined as the basic reproduction number without cases being reported or
hospitalised. We assumed that the population size N is constant over the short time of the
outbreak and hence we absorb it into parameter β (i.e. we do not consider birth and death
rates). Furthermore, we take the total population N = 1 so the results would be per-capita. We
note that for Ts = Ta and μ = 1 the relation in the above equation would reduce to Re = R0
where the assumption is that the basic reproduction number is only proportional to transmission
rate and the mean infectious period. Namely this ratio would be the expected number of new
infections from a single infection in a population where all individuals are susceptible.

2.2

SEIR model with contact tracing

To incorporate contact tracing into our model we follow the steps of [5]. Contact tracing in this
manner is based on three elements, contact identification, contact listing and follow-up. This
process begins once an infected (dead or alive) case is being reported, at this stage one lists the
contacts of the reported person, then a team of contact tracers track the listed contacts (this
could also be done via a mobile application). If the traced contacts show symptoms at the time
of tracking they will be removed by isolation or quarantine. Otherwise, they will be instructed
to update their status if they develop any symptoms over 14 days. The follow-up team would
then look after the traced contacts during this period and will remove them if symptoms appear.
There are two assumptions to proceed with this model:
• Only the reported or hospitalised cases can trigger contact tracing.
• Contact of a reported patient are traced with probability φ. There is also a fixed delay
δ between index case reporting and contact tracking. If the traced individuals are symptomatic at the time of contact, they will be removed immediately, otherwise they follow up
the monitoring protocol.

Untraced contacts have probability (1 − φ), these are the cases that are missed and did not
trigger tracing from the reported cases. We shall now define the cumulative number, at time t,
of traced infected individuals who are in exposed or infectious group when first tracked,

ii is the reported case infectious period probability density,
iii is the integral over infectious period of length z,
iv is the probability still incubating t − r + δ units after infection and
v is the traced transmissions infected at r ∈ [t − z, t].

We assumed that the incubation period cumulative distribution FE is exponentially distributed.
Since the average infectious period is short the the change in population size is negligible and
one assumes that S is approximately constant over this period. Hence, the total number of the
traced transmissions at time t + δ is,

We now define four additional compartments, Ece are the exposed individuals who will be traced
and incubating when they were tracked, Eci are the exposed individuals who will be traced and
infectious when tracked. Ice are the monitored (and under monitoring) infectious individuals who
have shown no symptoms (while incubating) at the time of first contact, and Ici are the infectious
individuals who should be removed as they were found symptomatic at the time of first contact.
The probability pe of a traced contact being incubating when first tracked should depend on
the mean infectious period Ts , the delay between index case reporting and tracing δ, and the
incubation period of the traced case τ , as a result:

The average infectious period, prior to being tracked, for the fraction (1 − pe ) individuals is
defined by Ti and can be approximated by the expected value of the time after symptom onset

We assume monitored infectious individuals, Ice have transmissibility βm and mean infection
period Tm in days. The value of βm and Tm directly depends on the efficiency of the contact
tracing protocol. Note that for the infectious individuals, Ici , traced during their infectious period,
we assign transmissibility β prior to tracking and mean infectious period Ti .
Contact tracing which is triggered by individuals in Ice and Ici compartments counts as secondary tracing, tertiary tracing and so on and thus we call them higher order tracing. In
contrast, the first order tracing are the contacts of the fraction φ who will be traced. We shall
then define probabilities pee and pie as probability of traced contact, infected by Ice individuals,
and probability of traced contact, infected by Ici individuals, as

SEIR model with contact tracing and social mixing

2.3

To take the social mixing into account we rewrite the transmission coefficient as the product of
a transmission β times a constant matrix C whose element Cλσ measures the average number
of physical contacts, on daily basis, among an individual in group age λ with an individual in
group age σ. It should be noted that the probability of a susceptible individual, in age class λ, to
come to contact with an infected individual in class σ is equivalent to the product of the contact
rate Cλσ times the probability Iσ that individual in class σ is infected. Hence we can denote age
groups appropriately via λ and σ and our model modifies to,

We note that Cλσ denotes the interaction between different age groups and hence it does not
matter what groups of infected individuals it is coupled to. It should also be noted that the age
structured mixing of individuals in the age group λ change their likelihood of being exposed to
the virus given certain number of infectious people in the population. Furthermore, in our model
we made a dependency between α and λ (i.e. α → αλ ) due to the assumption that younger
individuals are more likely to be asymptomatic and less infectious [9]. The effective reproduction
number is now calculated as,

Results

The impact of contact tracing on the effective reproduction number: In order to keep the spread
of the virus under control we need to keep the effective reproduction number below one. If
we assume the same mean infectious period for both symptomatic and asymptomatic case (i.e.
Ts ≈ Ta ) and also if we take the multiplicative factor μ = 1, we get,
αλ φ < 1 −

(3.1)

where αλ φ is the critical proportion of the total cases which need to be traced in different age
groups in order for Re < 1.
Furthermore, the impact of contact tracing can be quantified by considering the relative
change in the effective reproduction number. From the simple SEIR model
 Pn let us recall the
effective reproduction number and call it, Roe = R0 αλ TTas + μ(1 − αλ )
σ=1 Cλσ , where we
added the social mixing term appropriately. Then the relative change in Re with contact tracing
would be of the form,
Roe − Re
αλ φTs
=
.
(3.2)
o
Re
(1 − αλ )μTa + αλ Ts

For Ts ≈ Ta and μ = 1 the relative change takes the critical form of αλ φ which is independent
of the social mixing matrix Cλσ and is only proportional to the probability that contacts of a
reported case being traced, φ, and fraction of untraced cases that are reported in a particular
age group, αλ .
In literature [3], μ has a unconstrained distribution of μ ∼ uniform(0.2, 0.55). αλ has a
unconstrained distribution of αλ ∼ uniform(0.1, 0.99). In Fig. 1 we plot the relative change for
upper and lower values of μ while keeping Ts ≈ Ta . Higher value of μ means higher transmission
rate for asymptomatic individuals, as a result the relative change in the effective reproduction
number with tracing is proportional to ∼ αλ φ for upper bound of μ while proportional to ∼ φ
for lower bound of μ.
Imperfect tracing: So far we assumed perfect tracing, that is to consider that traced individuals do not cause secondary infections due to an effective monitoring and tracking policies. In
other words, we assumed transmission rate for monitored individuals is zero (i.e. βm = 0). Let
us now relax this condition and assume that βm > 0, then the full dominant eigenvalue of (2.16)
is,

plot varies the values of αλ according to its distribution (i.e. αλ ∼ uniform(0.1, 0.99)) and φ
(where 0 6 φ 6 1) for two values of μ = 0.2 and μ = 0.55.

We remind that Ice are the monitored infected individuals who have shown no symptoms upon
contacting them and Ici are the symptomatic infectious individuals who were traced and removed
into isolation. It is now trivial that the efficiency of contact tracing has a linear contribution in
the value of the effective reproduction number given by φβm Tm . The formula above shows that
in order to have an effective monitoring policy in place the mean infectious period for monitored
infectious individuals should be minimised. In other words, the time between symptom onset
and isolation, Tm should be at its minimum.
The impact of age-structured social mixing on the effective reproduction number: To impose
an effective distancing policy one needs to study the social mixing matrices that illustrate the
average number of contacts between different age groups. Measuring the social mixing varies
for different locations and could depend on the structure of households, schools and workplaces
[9, 20]. In this paper, we are using the social mixing matrices constructed by [20]. The study by
[20] conducted in the UK by surveying a sample of adults and recording their contact patterns
after the British government put social distancing measures in place. In Fig. 2 we reconstructed
the social mixing matrix from CoMIX study [20], there are six age groups participated in their
P6
study, namely 18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, and 70+. As a result σ=1 Cλσ . The CoMIX
matrices show the average number of contacts between different age groups in different setups
from the 24th of March 2020 one day after the lockdown was imposed in the UK. To control
the spread of the virus one should monitor the number of contacts between each age group and
minimise them when necessary. In the next section we use the mixing matrices in Fig. 2 to
illustrate the effect of social mixing on the expected value of Re .

be the fraction of reported cases which are traced contacts. In fact, q can be interpreted as the
conditional probability that a transmission is traced given a cases is being reported. Finally,
km = φRm = φβm Tm where Rm is the reproduction number of the contact traced / monitored
individuals. Since k and km are the infected traced contacts identified per untraced and traced
reported cases respectively, it is sensible to define Cj and Tj as the cumulative reported cases
and traced-reported cases in week j respectively. We now define the average number of traced
infected individuals identified in week j + i per untraced and traced reported case from the
preceding week j as,
k j,i =

Above estimates Re as the ratio of the sum of untraced and fraction of traced reported cases
(θ), weighted by probabilities pi . The probabilities pi are calculated using the serial interval
of the COVID-19 that is estimated to be a normal distribution with mean of μ = 3.96 and
standard deviation of σ = 4.75, [26], therefore on weekly basis we have: p1 = P(N < 7),
p2 = P(7 < N < 14) and so on. In perfect tracing (i.e. θ = 0) only weekly untraced reported
cases (Ci − Ti ) play role in the calculation of Re while for imperfect tracing (i.e. θ = 1) all
the traced and untraced reported cases are weighted equally. As a result, one does not require
specific data about the traced reported cases per week. Utilising θ in this manner could serve
as a useful tool for sensitivity analysis and in the countries where obtaining the contact tracing
data is difficult.
We are now equipped to calculate the expected value of the effective reproduction number
for London. We begin by using the social mixing matrices given in Fig. 2, where there are
six age groups in participants (n = 6) reporting their contact pattern with eight different age
groups. We note that each matrix element is the average number of contacts between different
age groups. As a result, the normalised sum of each matrix’s row gives the value of C for the
particular age class and particular setup. Using the cumulative reported cases from [ 27] for
London and Eq. (3.9) we estimated the expected value of Re - for nine weeks beginning from
the 22nd of February 2020 - for different age groups in different setups in Fig. 3. Our results
show that before the lockdown the mean of the effective reproduction number is 2.55 and after
the lockdown is imposed the mean of the effective reproduction reduces to 0.77 over the weeks
four to nine for all age groups and setups, this is comparable to results of [20] and [25] (when
averaged on weekly basis).

Figure 3: The expected value of the reproduction number as calculated by the Eq. (3.9) for
London over nine weeks beginning from the 22nd of February 2020 for different age groups in
different social setups. The dashed grey line on each plot shows the 23rd of March 2020 when
the lockdown was imposed. Additionally, the black dashed line is the value of E(Re ) when there
is only contact tracing involved and no social mixing (i.e. assuming Cλσ = 1) in Eq. (3.9).

In estimation of E(Re ) we assumed that the average number of contacts between different
age groups in London is roughly the same as the whole UK. We acknowledge that Londoners

form only 16.5% of the participants in CoMIX survey yet for the simplicity we assume the contact
behaviour of Londoners is the same with the rest of the country. We also assumed perfect tracing

Conclusions

In this study we proposed an SEIR model with contact tracing and social mixing. We have
shown that the effective reproduction number is proportional to dominant eigenvalue of the
contact matrix, a result which is also derived in [21] using another method. In Eq.(2.17) we have
derived contact tracing via parameters φ (probability of contacts of a reported being traced)
and α (fraction of untraced cases who are reported) and showed that the critical value of the
required tracing to keep the effective reproduction number below one is proportional to αφ. We
also derived the effective reproduction number when there is higher order tracing in Eq. ( 3.4), in
which case there is a linear contribution to the effective reproduction number given by φβm Tm
where βm is the transmissibility of those infected individuals who are monitored and Tm is the
time between symptom onset and isolation for the monitored infectious individuals. In the case
of the COVID-19 we can assume that βm ≈ β, yet to have an effective contact tracing and lower
values of Re it is important to keep Tm at its minimum - this of course requires an effective
human capital to isolate the monitored cases immediately upon developing symptoms.
We furthermore gave a formula in Eq. (3.9) to estimate the expected value of the effective
reproduction number E(Re ) on a given week. This formula estimates the average reproduction
number by using the serial interval of the COVID-19 and the fraction of traced and untraced
reported cases. We used this formula to estimate the E(Re ) in London, UK over nine weeks
beginning from the 22nd of February 2020. We used the proportionality of the effective reproduction number to social mixing matrices to calculate the E(Re ) for six setups and six age
groups. While our method in estimating the E(Re ) is accurate and matches with the values of
other studies (such as [25] for London) it is important to improve this calculation by using the
formula presented in Eq. (3.4). This equation depends on the infectivity parameters, such as β,
Ts and Ta , and they can be estimated by methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
(see for instance [13]). This task is the subject of our upcoming work.
From our model and analysis it is evident that contact tracing and social mixing are both
playing important roles in controlling the value of the effective reproduction number (see also
[22, 23, 24, 28, 29, 30]). While there is an increasing demand to open up the society since
the value of Re is below the critical value of one it is important for policymakers to note that
the value of Re can rebound to higher values should the easing of the restrictions cause higher
number of contacts between individuals. In fact, in opening up the society one must suppress the
opportunities for transmission. From our model this can be done by firstly, putting an effective
contact tracing measure in place, that is to trace, monitor and isolate the contacts of reported
cases without time-wasting and secondly, monitoring the number of contacts between different
age groups and the fraction of the reported cases classified by their age αλ to prioritise contacts
tracing by age groups when there is a lack of health workers.
