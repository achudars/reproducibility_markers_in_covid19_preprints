Abstract

30

Introduction

31

The novel coronavirus (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, showed various prevalence and case-fatality rates

32

(CFR) among patients with different pre-existing chronic conditions. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients with

33

renal replacement therapy (RRT) might have a higher prevalence and CFR due to reduced immune function from

34

uremia and kidney tropism of SARS-CoV-2, but there was no systematic study on the infection and mortality of the

35

SARS-CoV-2 infection in ESRD patients who are on RRT.

36

Methods

37

We searched five electronic databases and performed a systematic review and meta-analysis up to June 30, 2020, to

38

evaluate the prevalence and case fatality rate (CFR) of the COVID-19 infection among ESRD patients with RRT.

39

The global COVID-19 data were retrieved from the international database on June 30, 2020, for estimating the

40

prevalence and CFR of the general population as referencing points.

41

Results

42

Of 3,272 potential studies, 34 were eligible studies consisted of 1,944 COVID-19 confirmed cases in 21,873 ESRD

43

patients with RRT from 12 countries in four WHO regions. The overall pooled prevalence in ESRD patients with

44

RRT was 3.10% [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25–5.72] which was higher than referencing 0.14% global average

45

prevalence. The overall estimated CFR of COVID-19 in ESRD patients with RRT was 18.06% (95%CI 14.09–

46

22.32) which was higher than the global average at 4.98%.

47

Conclusions

48

This meta-analysis suggested high COVID-19 prevalence and CFR in ESRD patients with RRT. ESRD patients with

49

RRT should have their specific protocol of COVID-19 prevention and treatment to mitigate excess cases and deaths.

Author summary

54

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was associated with increasing severity and mortality of COVID-19. End-stage renal

55

disease (ESRD) patients were at the terminal stage of CKD and had reduced immune function due to uremia.

56

Additionally, ESRD patients with kidney transplantation had a diminished immune system from immunosuppressive

57

agents. Kidneys might be the secondary target of SARS-CoV-2 after the respiratory tract regardless of the previous

58

history of kidney disease, preferably the glomerulus, which was associated with the richness of some specific

59

protein-coding genes in the kidney. The overall pooled prevalence in ESRD patients with renal replacement therapy

60

was approximately 22 times of the referencing global average prevalence. The overall estimated case fatality rate of

61

COVID-19 in ESRD patients with renal replacement therapy was approximately 3.6 times the global average. ESRD

62

patients with renal replacement therapy had high COVID-19 prevalence and case fatality rate. We suggested that

63

ESRD patients with renal replacement therapy should have their specific protocol of COVID-19 prevention and

64

treatment to mitigate excess cases and deaths.

Introduction

66

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in December

67

2019 as a newly discovered causative pathogen of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, China[1].

68

Since its debut, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has drastically spread throughout the globe, and the World

69

Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020[2]. The global COVID-19 data

70

from the international database at mid-year of 2020 reported 217 countries affected by the novel coronavirus with

71

more than ten million people infected with SARS-CoV-2; approximately half a million patients died from the novel

72

disease[3].

73

Pre-existing comorbidities have been reported to be associated with the severity of hospitalized COVID-19

74

patients[4]. Chronic kidney disease was found to be associated with the severity and mortality of COVID-19[5].

75

Specifically, patients with chronic kidney disease had a three-fold risk of developing severe COVID-19[6]. About

76

one-third of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients with dialysis who were hospitalized with COVID-19 were

77

died[7]. The high mortality rate might be associated with the diminished immune system from uremia in ESRD

78

patients[8]. Moreover, kidney transplanted patients had reduced immune response from immunosuppressive

79

agents[9].

80

Kidneys might be the secondary target of SARS-CoV-2 after the respiratory tract regardless of the previous

81

history of kidney disease as indicated from the second-highest SARS-CoV-2 viral load found in the kidneys of the

82

autopsy in COVID-19 death cases, preferably the glomerulus, which was associated with the richness of protein-

83

coding genes including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), and

84

cathepsin L (CTSL) in the kidney[10]. There was a high number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who

85

subsequently developed acute kidney injury (AKI) during the disease course(5), especially patients with kidney

86

transplantation[11]. Several systematic reviews reported the association of AKI in COVID-19 patients with more

87

severity and poor prognosis of COVID-19[12-14]. Despite the evidence on the association of COVID-19 and

88

subsequent kidney damage, whether patients with severe chronic kidney disease, especially those with renal

89

replacement therapy (RRT), had higher COVID-19 infection and death than individuals with normal kidney

90

functions has still been inconclusive. In this review, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the prevalence and

91

case fatality rate of COVID-19 in patients with ESRD with RRT.

92

Methods

93

This study was conducted following the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic

94

Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement[15]. We prospectively registered the systematic review with

95

PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Ongoing Systematic Reviews (Registration number:

96

CRD42020199752).

97

Search strategy

98

PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials were used to

99

systematically search for articles published in the English language up to June 30, 2020. The terms “Coronavirus”,

100

“COVID-19” and “SARS-CoV-2” were used in combination with “Chronic kidney disease”, “End-stage renal

101

disease”, “Renal replacement therapy”, “Dialysis”, “Hemodialysis”, “Peritoneal Dialysis” and “Kidney

102

Transplantation” as the keywords for literature search along with their synonyms. The search strategy is presented in

104

related citations from other journals via Google Scholar.

106

Study selection

107

We worked with an information specialist to design an appropriate search strategy to identify original peer-

108

reviewed articles of randomized controlled trials and observational studies evaluating the prevalence or mortality

109

outcomes, or both of COVID-19 in ESRD patients with RRT (KT, HD, or PD) without restriction on age, gender,

110

ethnicity, duration of chronic kidney disease, or previous treatment. Additional outcomes were the need for

111

mechanical ventilation (MV) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Article screening was done by two

112

independent reviewers for eligible studies. Discrepancies between the two reviewers were resolved by consensus.

113

Data extraction

114

Data extraction was done by two independent reviewers for published summary estimate data.

115

Discrepancies between the two reviewers were resolved by consensus. We extracted the following data: (1) study

116

characteristics (authors, year of publication, study type, journal name, contact information, country, and funding),

117

(2) patients characteristics (sample size, age, gender, type of renal replacement therapy, COVID-19 diagnostic

118

criteria, COVID-19 treatment), (3) outcomes (complete list of the names of all measured outcomes, unit of

119

measurement, follow-up time point, missing data) as well as any other relevant information. All relevant text, tables,

120

and figures were examined for data extraction. We contacted the authors of the study with incompletely reported

121

data. If the study authors did not respond within 14 days, we conducted analyses using the available data.

122

The global COVID-19 data were retrieved from the international database(3) on June 30, 2020, for

123

estimating the prevalence and CFR of the general population as referencing points. The global COVID-19 data in

124

general population comprised of 7,525,172,273 population, 10,566,205 COVID-19 confirmed cases, and 526,163

125

COVID-19 death cases in 217 countries. The global average prevalence of COVID-19 in the general population was

126

0.14%, and the global average CFR of COVID-19 in the general population was 4.98%.

128

The authors worked independently to assess the risk of bias in the included studies using the risk of bias

129

tool by Hoy et al. for studies with COVID-19 prevalence outcomes[16]. We assessed the representativeness of the

130

sample, sampling frame, sampling techniques, response rate, data collection method, case definition, measurement

131

tools, study period, and data calculation. We assigned each domain as a low risk of bias and a high risk of bias while

132

the overall risk of bias was reported as a low risk of bias, a moderate risk of bias, and a high risk of bias. The

133

included studies with COVID-19 mortality data were assessed for risk of bias with the non-summative four-domain

134

system (consecutive cases, multicenter, more than 80% follow-up, multivariable analysis) developed by Wylde et

135

al[17]. We assigned each domain as adequate, inadequate, and not reported. This system was preferred because the

136

domain was applicable with both controlled observational studies and case series. We contacted the authors if there

137

was insufficient information to assess. If the study authors did not respond within 14 days, we conducted the risk of

138

bias assessment using available data. We resolve the disagreement through discussion. We presented our risk of bias

139

assessment in Supplementary S1Table.

140

Statistical analysis

141

The primary outcomes were COVID-19 prevalence and COVID-19 deaths. The prevalence outcomes were

142

measured with the percentage of COVID-19 confirmed cases and total ESRD with RRT patients with an associated

143

95% confidence interval (CI). The death outcomes were measured as CFR with the percentage of COVID-19 deaths

144

and total COVID-19 confirmed cases in ESRD with RRT patients with an associated 95% CI. The additional

145

outcomes were the need for mechanical ventilation and ICU admission among hospitalized COVID-19 confirmed

146

cases in ESRD with RRT patients with an associated 95% CI. The results of the studies were included in the meta-

147

analysis and presented in a forest plot, which also showed statistical powers, confidence intervals, and heterogeneity.

148

This meta-analysis was performed to find pooled estimated value with a 95% confidence interval and did not have a

149

comparator group, thus no null hypothesis was tested. Instead, we compared the estimated values of primary

150

outcomes with global averages.

151

We assessed clinical and methodological heterogeneity by examining participant characteristics, follow-up

152

period, outcomes, and study designs. We then assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I2 statistic. We regarded

153

level of heterogeneity for I2 statistic as defined in chapter 9 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of

154

Interventions: 0–40% might not be important; 30–60% may represent moderate heterogeneity; 50–90% may

155

represent substantial heterogeneity; 75–100% considerable heterogeneity. The Freeman-Tukey double arcsine

156

transformation was used to ensure admissible confidence intervals. The random-effects meta-analysis by

157

DerSimonian and Laird method was used as clinical, methodological, and statistical heterogeneity encountered. The

158

exact method was used for confidence interval computation. Prespecified subgroup analyses, including country

159

income level, WHO country region, and RRT modality, were performed. We assessed publication bias in two ways.

160

First, we computed each study effect size against standard error and plotted it as a funnel plot to assess asymmetry

161

visually. Second, we used Egger’s test to statistically test for asymmetry. The significant asymmetry indicated the

162

possibility of publication bias or heterogeneity. The meta-analysis was performed using STATA 16.1 (StataCorp,

163

TX, USA).

Characteristics of the studies

166

The database search identified 3,272 potential records. After duplicate removal, 1,885 titles passed the

167

initial screening, and 212 theme-related abstracts were selected for further full-text articles assessment for eligibility

168

(Fig 1). A total of 178 articles were excluded as the following: 44 letters to the editor, 36 case reports, 26 wrong

169

populations, 19 wrong outcomes, 16 editorials, 12 review articles, nine duplicates, nine recommendation, three

170

commentaries, two non-English, and two protocols. Only 34 studies were eligible for data synthesis and meta-

171

analysis.

175

All 34 included studies were published in 2020, of which 15 studies reported prevalence outcomes[18-32]

176

and 31 studies reported death outcomes[7, 18, 21-24, 26-50]. There were 17 cohort studies[7, 19, 20, 23-25, 27, 31,

177

33, 35, 40, 42, 44-46, 49, 50], 12 case series[21, 30, 34, 36-39, 41, 43, 47, 48], and five cross-sectional studies[22,

178

26, 28, 29, 32]. The number of samples per study ranged from 3 to 7,154 with a total of 1,944 COVID-19 confirmed

179

cases in 21,873 ESRD patients with RRT from 12 countries in four WHO regions which nine countries were high-

The mean age varied from 45.0 to 73.6 years. Female patients in each study were ranged from 0 to 57%. There were

182

20 studies on ESRD patients with kidney transplantation (KT) only[21, 23, 24, 26, 28, 30, 34-39, 41, 43, 45-50], ten

183

studies with hemodialysis (HD) only[18-20, 22, 25, 27, 29, 32, 33, 40], four studies with more than one RRT

In 27 studies, the diagnostic criteria to confirm COVID-19 case were polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

191

assay only. While five studies used a combination of PCR and additional criteria to diagnose COVID-19: imaging

192

(three studies), suggestive symptoms (one study), and a combination of imaging, suggestive symptoms, and

193

laboratory tests (one study). One study did not explicitly state the diagnostic criteria. For COVID-19 treatment,

194

Hydroxychloroquine was the most common treatment used in 20 studies, followed by Lopinavir/Ritonavir used in

195

12 studies. Some studies used other medications including Darunavir/Ritonavir, Oseltamivir, Umifenovir, Ribavirin,

196

and Ganciclovir. Three studies reported no specific COVID-19 treatment, and eight studies did not report

197

information on COVID-19 treatment.

198

Risk of bias

199

For the risk of bias assessment of 15 included studies with prevalence outcomes, 12 studies had a mild

200

overall risk of bias, and three studies had a moderate overall risk of bias. The domain with a high risk of bias was the

201

representativeness of the sample followed by sampling frame, sampling techniques, and response rate. For 31

202

included studies that reported mortality outcomes, there were a high number of inadequate in multicenter studies and

203

multivariable analysis domains while the consecutive case and more than 80% follow-up were adequate in most

204

studies (Supplementary S1Table). While the funnel plot showed some visual asymmetry, Egger’s test for asymmetry

205

highlighted no evidence of publication bias on overall estimated prevalence (p=0.418). The funnel plot and Egger’s

206

test highlighted no evidence of publication bias on the overall estimated case fatality rate (p=0.569)

(SupplementaryS1 Fig).

Prevalence of COVID-19

209

Fifteen studies that reported the prevalence of COVID-19 in ESRD patients with RRT were included in the

210

meta-analysis of 20,671 ESRD with RRT patients from seven countries[18-32]. The overall pooled prevalence was

211

3.10% [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25–5.72] which was higher than referencing 0.14% global average

212

prevalence (Fig 2). The highest COVID-19 prevalence in ESRD patients was reported in the United Kingdom

213

[19.61% (95% CI 17.65–21.69)][31]whereas the lowest COVID-19 prevalence was reported in Turkey [0.20%

214

(95%CI 0.00–1.09%)][28].

Thirty-one studies with death outcomes among 1,774 COVID-19 confirmed cases in ESRD with RRT from

270

12 countries[7, 18, 21-24, 26-50]. The overall estimated CFR of COVID-19 in ESRD patients with RRT was

271

18.06% (95%CI 14.09–22.32) which was higher than the global average at 4.98% (Fig 6).

Need for Mechanical Ventilation and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Admission Rate

325

Twenty-one studies that reported mechanical ventilation rate of hospitalized COVID-19 cases were

326

included in the meta-analysis of 377 hospitalized COVID-19 cases from nine countries[7, 21, 23, 26, 27, 30, 33-38,

327

40, 41, 43, 45-50]. The overall mechanical ventilation rate of COVID-19 in hospitalized ESRD patients with RRT

328

was 38.75% (95%CI 28.38-49.56).

329

Fifteen studies from nine countries, which consisted of 223 hospitalized COVID-19 cases in ESRD patients

330

with RRT, reported ICU admission rate[21, 23, 26, 27, 30, 33, 35-37, 40, 41, 43, 45, 48, 50]. The overall ICU

331

admission rate of COVID-19 in hospitalized ESRD patients with RRT was 28.31% (95% CI13.84–44.97). Forest

332

plots with subgroup analysis were provided in SupplementaryS2 and S3 Figs.

333

Discussion

334

To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of studies focusing on the

335

prevalence and CFR of the novel coronavirus in ESRD patients with various renal replacement therapy modalities.

336

The pooled data showed that the prevalence and CFR of COVID-19 in ESRD patients with RRT were significantly

337

higher than the global average in all populations[3]. The need for mechanical ventilation and ICU admission rate in

338

hospitalized ESRD patients with RRT was also high. The outcomes were varied among country income level, WHO

339

region, and type of RRT modality.

340

The overall pooled prevalence of COVID-19 in ESRD patients with RRT was higher than the global

341

average prevalence (3.1% vs. 0.1%)[3]. Moreover, the overall pooled prevalence of COVID-19 in ESRD patients

342

with RRT was higher than that of autoimmune disease patients (3.10% vs. 1.1%)[52] but was lower than that of

343

colorectal cancer patients (3.1% vs. 45.1%)[53]. The increased prevalence in ESRD patients might relate to

344

decreased immunity from uremia[8].

345

While no evidence of publication bias, there was substantial heterogeneity between studies on prevalence

346

outcomes which might associate with country income level and RRT modality. Significant heterogeneity between

347

upper-middle-income and high-income countries was suggested from the lower estimated pooled prevalence of

348

upper-middle-income countries than high-income countries (0.95% vs. 5.11%). This might be partially explained by

349

the fact that China, which had a relatively lower overall national COVID-19 prevalence than the high-income

350

countries[3], was regarded as an upper-middle-income country. There was also a significant heterogeneity across

351

RRT modalities which the HD patients had a considerably higher prevalence than the KT patients (4.26% vs.

352

0.76%). The result was unexpected because ESRD patients with KTwere supposed to have lower immune function

353

than ESRD patients with HD due to the use of the immunosuppressive drug[9]. Some ESRD with HD patients might

354

need to visit a hospital for in-center hemodialysis during COVID-19 epidemics and pandemics which might increase

355

the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure.

356

The overall CFR of COVID-19 in ESRD patients with RRT was higher than the global average (18.06% vs.

357

4.98%)[3]. Additionally, the overall estimated CFR of COVID-19 in ESRD patients with RRT was higher than the

358

general population (18.06% vs 0.68 to 5.00%)[54-56], hypertensive (18.06% vs. 6.43%)[57], and autoimmune

359

disease patients (18.06% vs 6.60%)[52]; but was lower than diabetes mellitus (18.06% vs. 19.25%)[58] and cancer

360

patients (18.06% vs. 20.83 to 23.4%)[59, 60].The diminished immune function might play a crucial role in the

361

increased CFR among ESRD patients with RRT[8].

362

Despite no evidence of publication bias, there was considerable heterogeneity between studies on

363

CFRacross WHO regions from 9.51% in Western Pacific to 17.01% in the Americas and 18.77% in the European

364

regions. The variation in CFR might associate with the relatively low national COVID-19 prevalence in China of the

365

Western Pacific region compared to other included countries[3].

366

Several limitations of this systematic review and meta-analysis should be noted. First, the included studies

367

had high heterogeneities for both prevalence and CFR outcomes. The subgroup analysis could not fully explore all

368

sources of heterogeneity, given the limited availability of the information presented in the included studies. Second,

369

there was no included study focused on ESRD patients with PD only. Thus, the prevalence and CFR of COVID-19

370

in PD patients might not be available. Third, we did not explore deeper into specific details of each RRT modality

371

such as type of HD, type of KT, and duration of RRT. Lastly, we included only English language articles that might

372

miss some pieces of evidence in other languages.

373

In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analysis provided the first evidence on the pooled

374

prevalence and CFR of COVID-19 in ESRD patients with RRT which were higher than the global average.

375

Increased prevalence and deaths might relate to reduced immune function in ESRD patients. ESRD patients with

376

RRT should have their specific protocol of COVID-19 prevention and treatment to mitigate excess cases and deaths.
