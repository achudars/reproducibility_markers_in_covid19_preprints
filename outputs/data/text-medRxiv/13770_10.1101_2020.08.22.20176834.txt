Abstract
COVID-19 continues to cause a pandemic, having infected more than 20 million people globally.
Successful elimination of the SARS-CoV-2 virus will require an effective vaccine. However, the
immune correlates of infection are currently poorly understood. While neutralizing antibodies are
believed to be essential for protection against infection, the contribution of the neutralizing
antibody response to resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been defined. In this study
the antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleocapsid proteins were
investigated in a UK patient cohort, using optimised immunoassays and a retrovirus-based
pseudotype entry assay. It was discovered that in severe COVID-19 infections an early antibody
response to both antigens was associated with improved prognosis of infection. While not all
SARS-CoV-2-reactive sera were found to possess neutralizing antibodies, neutralizing potency of
sera was found to be greater in patients who went on to resolve infection, compared with those
that died from COVID-19. Furthermore, viral genetic variation in spike protein was found to
influence the production of neutralizing antibodies. Infection with the recently described spike
protein variant 614G produced higher levels of neutralizing antibodies when compared to viruses
possessing the 614D variant. These findings support the assertion that vaccines targeting
generation of neutralizing antibodies may be useful at limiting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assessment
of the antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 at time of diagnosis will be a useful addition to the
diagnostic toolkit, enabling stratification of clinical intervention for severe COVID-19 disease.

population. As of 13 August 2020 there have been ~20 million confirmed infections worldwide,
with more than 750,000 deaths associated with severe COVID-19 disease [2]. The long-term
impact of this infection and the potential for post-infection sequelae are still poorly understood.
Understanding the protective and pathogenic consequences of the immune response to this
infection, the potential markers for different disease outcomes, and the potential correlates of
protection are essential for clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 infection and future vaccine
development.
Coronavirus infections are associated with potent antibody responses that are believed to persist
after infection (reviewed in [3]). MERS CoV infections resulting in pneumonia were strongly
associated with prolonged seropositivity [4], with antibodies appearing three weeks after onset of
illness [5]. However, in MERS infections that result in mild symptoms, antibodies were only
present transiently [6]. Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infections has relied on a combination of RTPCR tests and serologic assays. ELISA assays detecting antibodies binding to the nucleocapsid
protein (N) and spike antigen (S) have found widespread use, with both the S1 subunit of spike
and the receptor binding domain (RBD) being used as targets for antibody detection [7]. Lateral
flow assay (LFA) devices have also been implemented for detection of antibodies, but the
sensitivity of these serology tests in early infection has been questioned [8]. In addition, it appears
that some SARS-CoV-2 infections result in no antibodies generated to the reference antigens used
in these assays [9]. In cases where anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are generated, circulating
antibodies wane within months [10]. Antibody production may be a useful marker of a successful
immune response to SARS-CoV-2, but the role of antibodies in disease pathogenesis is
controversial. It has been reported that generation of IgG specific for the RBD is associated with
poor clinical outcomes [11].
Sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes has revealed eleven SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages, whose
prevalence differ between geographical location [12]. It is still unclear what influence genetic
polymorphisms have on the antigenicity of infections. While genetic variation in the spike protein is
limited, a polymorphic site has been identified at amino acid 614 [13]. This amino acid is
associated with differing ability of the virus to shed the S1 subunit. While aspartic acid is the most
common amino acid at this position, glycine is also observed, and believed to result in stabilised
retention of spike on the virus surface [14] and improved infectivity in cell culture [13].
In this study we assessed antibody reactivity to the S1 subunit of spike protein and the
nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalised patients with different clinical outcomes, with
the aim of determining if antibody responses, assessed as either sero-reactivity or neutralization
potency, were associated with COVID-19 disease progression. We also interrogated the influence
of the Spike D614G polymorphism on antibody responses during infection in COVID-19-confirmed
cases to determine if aa614 influenced immunogenicity.
Methods
Clinical samples. 422 serum samples were obtained from 227 different hospital in-patients with
symptomatic RT-PCR proven COVID-19 infection. These samples were diagnostic specimens
collected for routine clinical chemistry analyses. Surplus material was provided anonymously for
development of novel serology and virus neutralization assays. Review by the School of Life
Sciences Ethical Review Committee deemed the study to not require full ethical review. Patients
were predominantly of white British ethnicity and the majority were elderly (Table 1).
Sequence data was generated as part of the data collection for the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COGUK) Consortium, utilising extracted viral RNA from throat swabs generated for routine qRT-PCR
analysis of inpatients (with approval from PHE Research Ethics and Governance Group (REGG)
R&D NR0195). Anonymised clinical data for these patients was provided by clinical staff at
Nottingham University Hospitals Trust. 192 sera collected in August 2019 as part of the Trent HCV
cohort study [15], were assumed to be negative for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Sera were
inactivated before use using the WHO-approved protocol of treatment with 1% Triton X-100 for 4
hours before use in serological assays.
Anti-S1 and anti-nucleocapsid ELISA. Serum samples were serially diluted in 3% skimmed
milk powder in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.05% sodium azide. All assays were
performed on Biotek Precision liquid handling robots in a class II microbiological safety cabinet. For

endpoint dilution ELISAs, sera were progressively 4-fold diluted from 1:150 to 1;38,400. ELISA
was performed by coating 384 well Maxisorp (NUNC) assay plates with either 20 µL per well of 0.5
µg.mL-1 of Wuhan strain SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit (His tagged, HEK293 expressed;
Sino Biological) or SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (His Tagged, baculovirus expressed; Sino Biological)
in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (CBC; Merck), or human IgG at 1 µg.mL-1 in CBC buffer as
controls. Plates were sealed with foil film and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Plates were then
washed with PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) 3 times using a ThermoFisher Wellwash Versa
plate washing robot. Wells were immediately filled with 100 µL of 3% skimmed milk powder (w/v)
in PBS and 0.05% sodium azide (PBS-MA) and blocked overnight at 4 °C. Assay plates were then
washed 3 times and 20 µL of pre-diluted serum sample (including SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive
and negative serum controls) added in duplicate wells. After one hour at 21 °C, the plate was
washed 3 times in PBS-T, followed by addition of 20 µL of gamma chain-specific anti-human IgGHRP conjugate (Sigma A0170-1ML) at 1:30,000 dilution, incubating for one hour at 21 °C.
Following a final three washes with PBS-T, 40 µL One-step UltraTMB substrate solution
(ThermoScientific) was added to each well. After incubating for 20 minutes at room temperature,
40 µL of 2N H2SO4 was added to each well and Absorbance was measured at 450nm using a
GlowMax Explorer microplate reader (Promega).
Commercial anti-S1 and anti-N assays. Detection of antibodies to the S1 protein (Euroimmun)
and N Protein (Roche) were performed at the Rare & Imported Pathogens Laboratory at Public
Health England using the standard protocol.
SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype neutralization assay. Pseudotypes were produced as essentially
described previously for other viruses [16, 17]. Briefly, 1.5 × 106 HEK293T cells were seeded
overnight in a 10 cm diameter Primaria-coated dish (Corning). Transfections were performed with
2 µg each of the murine leukemia virus (MLV) Gag-Pol packaging vector (phCMV-5349), luciferase
encoding reporter plasmid (pTG126) and plasmid encoding Wuhan strain SARS-CoV-2 spike using
24 µL polyethylenimine (Polysciences) in Optimem (Gibco). Reaction mixtures were replaced with
Complete DMEM after 6 h. A no-envelope control (empty pseudotype) was used as a negative
control in all experiments. Supernatants containing SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype viruses (pv) were
harvested at 72 h post-transfection and filtered through 0.45 μm membranes. For infectivity and
neutralization testing of SARS-CoV-2 pv, 2 × 104 VeroE6 cells/well were plated in white 96-well
tissue culture plates (Corning) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The following day, SARS-CoV-2
pv-containing supernatants were incubated with sera (pre-treated with 1% Triton X-100/heatinactivated for 1 hr at RT), before being added to VeroE6 cells for 4 h. Infection inocula were then
discarded and 200 µL DMEM added to the cells. After 72 h, media was discarded, cells lysed with
cell lysis buffer (Promega) and relative luciferase activity (in RLU) measured using a FLUOstar
Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech). Each sample was tested in triplicate.
Assessment of polymorphisms in the S protein. Sequence polymorphisms at the D614G site
in spike were determined as part of the GISAID SARS-CoV-2 project data collection. Briefly, viral
cDNA was synthesised using the RNA to cDNA EcoDry Premix (Random Hexamers) (Takarabio).
Sequencing libraries were prepared from cDNA using the ARTIC amplicon sequencing protocol v2
[18] using the Oxford Nanopore Native Barcoding Ligation Sequencing protocol and the Native
Barcoding Expansion 1-12 and 13-24 kits (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). After quantification
using a Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 20 ng of library was loaded onto
a MinION flow cell (Oxford Nanopore Technologies; FLO-MIN106 R9.4.1) and sequenced on the
GridION X5 Mk1. Data was collected and analysed using RAMPART [19], as previously described
[20]. Samples from our cohort included in the UK-wide sequence analysis were compared for
reactivity in both serology and neutralization assays.
Statistical analyses. All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 8.4.3.
Assessment of normal distributions was performed using D'Agostino & Pearson tests. Data
generated by ELISA and neutralization assays was analysed using Mann-Whitney U Test for
comparison of two sets of data. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated for comparison
of continuous datasets.

2 Spike S1 subunit and the nucleocapsid proteins (Supplementary Figure 1). These data were
qualitatively concordant with serology testing performed using CE-marked commercial ELISA
assays on a subset of 24 samples taken from RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases (data not
shown). Sampling of a cross-section of patients at different times following initial diagnosis of
infection was performed to interrogate the timing of the antibody responses to S1 and N proteins
during severe COVID-19. We tested 192 samples retrieved from 142 discrete patients based on
time since diagnosis by RT-PCR. Sampling was performed from 4 days before diagnosis to 31 days
after diagnosis. The majority of samples tested more than 14 days after diagnosis were found to
possess antibodies to both the S1 (Figure 1A) and N proteins (Figure 1B). However, seven samples
taken later than 14 days after diagnosis were negative for antibodies to both proteins. For some
patients, sera were available shortly before the confirmatory RT-PCR test was performed. Antibody
binding to N and S1 was observed for many of these samples, indicating that in some cases of
severe COVID-19 disease the antibody response was already established at time of diagnosis.
When directly comparing the anti-S1 and anti-N response in these samples it was observed that in
the majority of cases anti-N antibodies were present if antibodies to the S1 spike subunit had been
generated (Figure 1C).
Antibody response is associated with outcome of infection. To investigate whether the
antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 was associated with recovery in this patient group, seroreactivity data (defined as the greatest binding signal observed for each patient) and age were
compared according to outcome. As expected, patients who died during hospitalisation with
COVID-19 were more likely to be older (median age at diagnosis was 74.2 y for discharged
patients versus 82.3 y for patients who died). Antibody responses detected in samples collected
after 7 days following diagnosis were associated with age. Very young patients, and the very
elderly, mounted a reduced antibody response to both S1 (Figure 2B) and nucleocapsid (Figure
2C). When samples taken between 7 days and 31 days following diagnosis were selected only from
patients >70 years old, a significant difference was observed in signal achieved in patients who
survived infection and were discharged, and those who died during their inpatient stay (Figure
2D).
An early potent antibody response to S1 and N is associated with outcome of infection.
Having identified differences in the antibody responses associated with outcome, the difference in
antibody response early in severe infection was analysed. A total of 149 discrete patients with a
sample available within the first seven days of diagnosed infection were analysed (86 who were
subsequently discharged and 63 who died as an inpatient) (Figure 3). There was no significant
difference in sampling times for these groups (Figure 3A). Comparing the maximal binding signal
achieved for these patients in the first 7 days following diagnosis, greater median reactivity in both
anti-S1 and anti-N assays was achieved for patients who subsequently cleared infection (Figure
3B). As saturation in our assays was observed for a small number of the samples analysed,
endpoint titrations were performed for each sample. Some samples did not achieve signal above
background and were omitted from this analysis. Endpoint titration and single point signals were
highly correlated for both the anti-S1 assay (Spearman r=0.6908, p<0.0001) (Figure 3C) and the
anti-N assay (Spearman r= 0.8771, p<0.0001 (Figure 3D). Comparing endpoint titration for each
sample in this analysis, both anti-S1 (Figure 3E) and anti-N antibody (Figure 3F) titres were
greater in patients who were subsequently discharged following resolution of infection.
Neutralizing capacity of serum antibodies is not strongly predicted by anti-S1 or anti-N
sero-reactivity. Sera from our cohort were tested in a SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay, utilising
retroviral pseudotypes possessing the spike proteins of the Wuhan strain of SARS-CoV-2. A broad
range of neutralization potency was observed, with reproducible neutralization data achieved in
this assay (Figure 4A). The neutralization potency of sera taken at different times after diagnosis
was analysed. While the majority of patients produced neutralizing antibodies within the first 10
days following diagnosis, some sera reproducibly enhanced infection, with up to 60% enhancement
in signal observed (Figure 4B). When plotted against ELISA binding signal, a significant positive
correlation was observed between neutralization with antibody binding to either S1 (Spearman r=
0.447; p<0.0001; Figure 4C) or N (Spearman r=0.5285; p<0.0001; Figure 4D). A potent
neutralizing antibody response produced during the first 7 days following diagnosis by RT-PCR was
associated with better prognosis, with patients who survived COVID-19 disease having more
potently neutralizing serum antibody responses than those who died (Figure 4E).

Polymorphisms in the spike gene are associated with generation of the neutralizing
antibody response in severe COVID-19 disease. It has recently been described that a single
nucleotide substitution leading to a replacement of aspartate with glycine residue at amino acid
position 614 in the spike protein has arisen during transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection, to
become highly prevalent in some geographic locations, including Europe [13]. To investigate if this
polymorphism was associated with differences in the generation of antibodies during infection in
hospitalised patients, whole-genome SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data was generated for a
subpopulation of our cohort where suitable swab samples had been taken for analysis for the UK
COG consortium sequencing project [21]. Sequencing data was available for 100 patients where
we had already generated antibody serology data. Choosing the timepoint for each patient that
had the greatest signal in the anti-S1 ELISA, binding data was stratified by the D614G
polymorphism (Figure 5). While there was no significant difference in the reactivity to S1 in ELISA
in these two groups (Figure 5A), antibody responses to nucleocapsid protein were significantly
higher in the G614-infected population (Figure 5B). Importantly, the neutralization potency
observed in patients infected with the G614 variant was significantly higher than those infected
with the D614 variant (Figure 6C).
Discussion
For the first time, we have shown that, in hospitalised patients, the induction of an early high titre
antibody response is associated with recovery from COVID-19 infection. While this contrasts with
previous analysis of antibody response in severe COVID-19 infections [11], our optimisation of the
quantitative resolution of antibody assays may provide better insight than data achieved in
existing clinical assays that utilize saturating amounts of serum antibodies for detection. In our
assay a correlation was observed between the interpretation of our fixed dilution ELISA and assays
reporting the serially-diluted endpoint, and as such provide an accurate assessment of the
antibody binding to the S1 subunit of spike and the nucleocapsid protein. These new assays may
contribute to patient management and may assist with understanding the vaccine-induced
antibody responses that are important for protection against severe COVID-19.
The association between the presence of antiviral antibodies and better prognosis in our mainly
white, British cohort is striking, but needs to be confirmed in other cohorts. Consistent with other
recent studies, antibodies were demonstrated to occur in the majority of patients a week after
diagnosis [22, 23]. However, investigation of the early antibody response where present revealed
that those individuals who mounted an IgG antibody response in the first week following diagnosis
were more likely to have a positive prognosis. A study investigating antibodies directed only to the
spike RBD identified an association between antibody production and poor prognosis in a Chinese
cohort [11]. It may be that antibody specificity is important for determining protection, as
demonstrated for other viruses [24]. While we did not investigate the IgM response in these
infections, analysis of the antibody repertoire and IgM/IgG subclasses may provide insight into the
generation of antibodies in severe infection [22]. Given the ease and speed of performing our
serology assays, these could be included in a clinical stratification for intervention in inpatient
COVID-19 infections.
The higher levels of production of anti-viral antibodies during SARS-CoV-2 infections that
subsequently resolved may be indication of an immune response that is skewed away from a
pathogenic inflammatory response. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and T cell responses have been
associated with poor clinical outcome in COVID-19 [25, 26], but IL4 and IL5 have also been found
to be elevated in severe infection [27]. A unique, complex dysregulation of the immune response
has been described in severe COVID-19 disease [28]. The relationship between the early events in
severe disease clearly requires further investigation.
A further major finding was the discovery of differing patterns of anti-S1 subunit antibodies and
the neutralizing potency of sera between different patients. Neutralisation (and enhancement) of
virus entry was observed in some serum samples where there was no detectable anti-S1 (Figure
4C). There must therefore be specific components of the polyclonal anti-spike antibody response
generated by SARS-CoV-2 infection that are not detected in S1-based antibody assays. The sera
used were heat-inactivated to prevent complement-mediated inhibition and did not neutralize nonSARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes. Lower dilutions of inactivated sera were cytotoxic, due to the presence
of Triton X-100, but our optimised dilution of 1:300 (0.0033% Triton X-100) was tolerated by the

target cells, providing resolvable inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry. As such, we conclude that the
inhibition was specific to the antibodies present in each sample.
Enhancement of virus entry was observed for some serum samples, mostly in samples that had
very low reactivity in the anti-S1 assay (Figure 4C). This finding is particularly important for
designing a clinically useful vaccine; if virus enhancing antibodies are generated by immunization,
it is likely that protection will not be provided. Current early data from ongoing vaccine trials
report high titres of neutralizing antibodies [29, 30]. Antibody-dependent enhancement has been
described for viruses from different families, including coronaviruses such as feline infectious
peritonitis virus (FIPV) [31] and SARS-CoV-1 [32]. ADE has been proposed to make a possible
contribution to pathogenesis of COVID-19 [33]. Our data support the need to investigate this
phenomenon in more detail, interrogating the dose-dependent nature of neutralization and
enhancement [32].
For the first time, we also interrogated the antibody response in patients known to be infected with
different SARS-CoV-2 variants. The spike 614G polymorphism is unusual as it has progressively
spread throughout Europe, becoming the major variant [13]. In our cohort, the 614G variant was
present in 55% of the samples analysed. While the antigens used in our ELISA and neutralization
assays possessed the 614D variant, reactivity and neutralization was greater for sera isolated from
infections with the 614G viruses. This implicates this variant in increased immunogenicity. Given
the increased stability of this variant [34], antibodies elicited by viruses with 614G may have
greater binding ability for correctly folded spike protein, resulting in greater neutralizing potency.
Antibodies directed to the 614D variant, which if more likely to be shed from the surface of a virus
particle, may recognise epitopes that do not result in effective neutralization, and may be more
likely to enhance infection. While this cannot directly account for the greater reactivity to the
nucleocapsid protein observed in these patients, the viruses possessing 614G might be globally
more antigenic. It is also plausible that greater anti-nucleocapsid reactivity in infections possessing
the 614G variant is an indirect indication of greater viral load at the site of infection [13]. This
finding is also important for vaccine development; the increased neutralization by antibodies from
infections with 614G may indicate that this variant will make a more potent immunogen. It will be
important to further profile the specificity of individual antibodies in different infections to identify
the determinants of neutralization of SARS-CoV-2.
Whilst some studies on hospitalised individuals have failed to show an association between
antibody titre and clinical severity of disease [35], analysis of the assays used in those reports
suggest that saturating amounts of antibodies (that is, low serum dilutions) were used, which were
unable to resolve the differences in overall titres reported here. Also, our study focussed on mainly
Caucasian, elderly inpatients. Differences in ethnic background, and other variables, may have a
role in determining the quality of the antibody responses in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.
To our knowledge this study provides the first evidence that a potent antibody response early in
infection may contribute to clearance of infection and improved prognosis, even when disease
symptoms are severe. While there are limitations on interpretation of our data given the
retrospective sampling approach we have adopted, further analysis of the potency of neutralizing
antibody responses, and the potential for infection enhancement are warranted. The data
presented here also supports the rationale for use of optimised vaccines that generate antibodies
directed to the spike and nucleocapsid genes and elicit potently neutralizing antibodies. The use of
convalescent sera as a therapeutic approach [36] may also provide sufficient potency to contribute
to resolution of infection, if potently neutralizing sera are specifically selected.

Figure legends:
Figure 1. Development of the antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 and
nucleocapsid proteins in hospital inpatients. ELISA using 192 samples taken at different
times from initial diagnosis of infection by RT-PCR, performed using two viral antigens. Antibodies
to A) spike S1 and B) N were detected for most sample following 7 days of diagnosed infection
(indicated by a vertical dashed line). Assay threshold is indicated by a horizonal dashed line. C)
Comparison of anti-S1 and anti-N signal for each sample. For clarity, equal reactivity is indicated
by the diagonal line.
Figure 2. Association of the anti-spike S1 and anti-N antibody responses with age and
outcome of infection. A) The median age of patients who survived infection and were discharged
from hospital (n=131) was lower than those patients who died of Covid-19 (n=78) The shaded
area highlights the patients that were selected for analysis in Figure 2 D. Maximal antibody
responses in 120 discrete patients to B) S1 and C) nucleocapsid were associated with age, with
younger and older patients producing the weakest antibody responses to both antigens. D)
Selecting patients >70 years old, antibody responses in samples between 7 and 31 days after
diagnosis were assessed to both antigens. **** p<0.001 *p>0.05; Mann-Whitney U test.
Figure 3. Early antibody response in hospitalised individuals is associated with improved
Covid-19 prognosis. A) Sampling times up to day 7 following diagnosis for 86 recovering
patients and 63 patients who died as a hospital inpatient following SARS-CoV-2 infection. B)
Comparison of the ELISA signal in samples taken up to day 7 following diagnosis to both S1 and N
proteins in patients with differing outcome. C) Comparison of the fixed-dose signal and endpoint
titration for anti-S antibodies (Spearman r=0.6908, p<0.0001). D) Comparison of the fixed-dose
signal and endpoint titration for anti-N antibodies (Spearman r= 0.8771, p<0.0001). E) Anti-S1
endpoint titres in samples taken up to day 7 in patients who resolved infection or died from Covid19. F) Anti-N endpoint titres in the first week of diagnosis in patients who resolved infection or
died from Covid-19. Comparisons were performed using Mann Whitney U test. *p<0.05 **p<0.01
***p<0.001. n.s. not significant.
Figure 4. Neutralizing antibody responses in severe COVID-19 infections A) Differing
neutralization potency of sera from SARS-CoV-2 infections for SARS-CoV-2pp. All assays were
performed in triplicate. This dataset highlights the intra-assay reproducibility of observed
neutralisation. B) Neutralization potency of sera plotted against time from diagnosis by RT-PCR
(n=167). C) & D) Neutralization potency of 80 sera from independent patients sampled up to day
7 following diagnosis was compared to C) anti-S1 reactivity (Spearman r=0.447; p<0.0001) and
D) anti-nucleocapsid reactivity (Spearman r=0.5285; p<0.0001). E) Neutralizing potency of sera
taken up to day 7 following diagnosis, grouped by infection outcome. *** p<0.001, Mann Whitney
Test
Figure 5. Association of polymorphisms in the spike protein on antibody reactivity and
neutralization. Peak ELISA reactivity to A) S1 and B) N in 100 discrete patients with available
viral genome sequence data was grouped based on the D614G polymorphism in the S1 subunit of
spike protein, irrespective of disease outcome. C) Neutralization potency of sera in 96 discrete
patients infected with viruses possessing the Spike 614D or 614G variants. Median values are
plotted in each case. Medians were compared using Mann Whitney Test. * p<0.05; ** p<0.01;
n.s. not significant.
