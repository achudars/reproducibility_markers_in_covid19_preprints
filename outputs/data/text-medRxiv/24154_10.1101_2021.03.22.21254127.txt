KEY POINTS
Question: Does the emergence of Variants of Concern (VOC) in urban centers in Canada
affect groups based on income and essential work status disproportionally?
Findings: We found a significantly higher cumulative case count and rate of increase of VOC
cases amongst those with lowest income and highest essential work status.
Meaning: The distribution of VOC and COVID-19 in general is disproportionately distributed,
and mitigation measures, including vaccines should be targeted to the highest risk groups.

STRUCTURED ABSTRACT (all below sections are required for submission, max 350,
current 323:)
Importance: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (VOC) across North America
has been associated with concerns of increased COVID-19 transmission. Characterizing the
distribution of VOCs can inform the development and implementation of policies and programs
to address the prevention needs of disproportionately affected communities.
Objective: We compared per-capita rates of COVID-19 cases (overall and VOC) from February
3, 2021 to March 10, 2021, across neighborhoods in the health regions of Toronto and Peel,
Ontario, by proportion of the population working in essential services and income.

Design: Descriptive epidemiological analysis, integrating COVID-19 surveillance and census
data. Per-capita daily epidemic curves were generated using 7-days rolling averages for cases
and deaths. Cumulative per-capita rates were determined using census-reported population of
each neighbourhood.
Setting: The study setting was the city of Toronto and the region of Peel (the City of Brampton,
Mississauga, and Caledon), Canada’s largest cities with a combined population of 4.3 million.
This area of Canada has had one of the highest incident rates of COVID-19 throughout the
pandemic.
Participants: We used person-level data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 community cases
(N=22,478) and census data for neighborhood-level attributes.
Exposures: We stratified neighbourhood using dissemination areas which represent
geographic areas of approximately 400-700 individuals, into tertiles by ranking the proportion of
population in each neighbourhood working in essential services (health, trades, transport,
equipment, manufacturing, utilities, sales, services, agriculture); and the per-person equivalent
household income.
Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): The primary outcomes were laboratory-confirmed COVID19 cases overall and VOC positives by neighbourhood.
Results: During the study period, VOC cases emerged faster in groups with lowest income
(growth rate 43.8%, 34.6% and 21.6% by income tertile from lowest to highest), and most
essential work (growth rate 18.4%, 30.8% and 50.8% by tertile from lowest tertile of essential
workers to highest tertile of essential workers).
Conclusions and Relevance: The recent introduction of VOC in the large urban area of
Toronto has disproportionately affected neighbourhoods with the most essential workers and
lowest income levels. Notably, this is consistent with the increased burden of non-VOC COVID19 cases suggesting shared risk factors. To date, restrictive public health strategies have been
of limited impact in these communities suggesting the need for complementary and wellspecified supportive strategies including vaccine prioritization to address disparities and overall
incidence of both VOC and non-VOC COVID-19.

Introduction
Variants of concern (VOC) of SARS-CoV-2 emerged towards the end of 2020, presenting new
challenges on epidemic containment (1). Several VOCs have been identified, including VOC
202012/01 (B.1.1.7). The emergence of B.1.1.7 resulted in documented replacement of wild
type strains in the United Kingdom and Denmark and was associated with an increase in
secondary attack rates (1) and potential increase in severity (2). Administrative municipal,
regional, or national bodies have responded to increased COVID-19-related morbidity and
mortality, particularly with the emergence of VOC, with non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI),
such as masking, physical distancing, and closure of non-essential businesses, indoor dining,
and schools.
Across countries, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic prior to the emergence of VOC was
disproportionately concentrated in neighbourhoods of low socioeconomic status manifesting in
higher burdens in lower income neighbourhoods and among front-line essential workers (3, 4).
Higher density networks may be particularly at risk of VOC growth given the higher per-contact
secondary attack rates associated with VOC (5). Thus, with the rapid emergence of VOC in
Canada, we seek to compare the pattern and trajectory of VOC among lower-income and
essential worker communities in the context of existing NPIs in the two of the country’s largest
cities.
Methods
We used Case and Contact Management Solutions (CCM)+ person-level data on VOC screen
positive cases among laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases between February 3rd and March
10, 2021, and the Statistics Canada 2016 Census data for neighbourhood-level characteristics.
Two public health units were included in the analysis, the City of Toronto (population 2.9
million), and the Region of Peel (population 1.4 million), the two most populous areas of Ontario,
with the highest level of ethnic diversity and per capita cases of COVID-19 (6). During the time
period included in this analysis, both regions had public health measures in place, including
closed non-essential businesses, restaurants, fitness centers, and limits to only interact with
one’s household (7). From February 3 onwards, all samples positive on RT-PCR with a cycle
threshold < 35 underwent Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for the N501Y mutation as
screening, and genetic sequencing for positive results (8). Neighbourhoods were stratified into
tertiles ranked by proportion of the population engaged in essential services (manufacturing,
utilities, trades, transport, equipment, agriculture, sales, services, and health); and per-person
equivalent income after tax. Tertile 1, 2, and 3 each represent approximately 33% of the total
population; and comprise neighbourhoods where a median of 30.4% (inter-quartile range [IQR]
25.0-35.3%), 47.9% (IQR42.1%-52.0%), and 63.2% (IQR 59.4%-68.1%) of the population,
respectively, worked in essential services; and a median income of $33,819 (29,337-37,054),
45,487 (41,411-48,079), and 60,652 (55,001-69,982) CAD. We compared the daily per-capita
rates (7-day rolling average) of new cases and VOC screen positive cases, as well as the
proportion of cumulative cases, by neighbourhood tertile. We excluded cases among residents

of long-term care homes because they represent a different outbreak setting from communitylevel outbreaks and transmissions. Analyses were conducted in R (version 4.0.2).
Results
A total of 19,912 cases were observed during the study period, of which 12,860 (64.6%) were
screened for a VOC, and 5,084 (25.5%) screened positive. At the time of this reporting 93% of
all samples which screened positive on N501Y PCR and sequenced, were the B.1.1.7 lineage
(6). As shown in Figure 1A, per-capita cases are increasing in tertiles 2 and 3, with a smaller
relative increase in tertile 1, representing the beginning of the region’s “third wave” in
neighbourhoods with the highest concentration of essential workers. The growth rate of VOCs
was 11.3%, 19.8%, and 30.8% in tertiles 1, 2, and 3 respectively, from February 7 to March 7
2021. (Figure 1A). Between February 3 and March 10, 19.0%, 32.7%, and 48.3% of overall
cases were in tertiles 1, 2, and 3 (Figure 1C); while 18.4%, 30.8% and 50.8% of VOC cases
were tertiles 1, 2, and 3, respectively (Figure 1D).

A similar pattern was observed with income tertiles, with the third wave concentrated in lower
income neighbourhoods (Figure 2A); and VOC growth rates of 26.2%, 21.1%, and 14.6% in
tertiles 1, 2, and 3 respectively (Figure 1B). Within the study period, 43.8%, 35.6%, and 20.6%
of overall cases were in tertiles 1, 2, and 3 (Figure 2C); while 43.8%, 34.6% and 21.6% of VOC
cases were tertiles 1, 2, and 3, respectively (Figure 2D).

Discussion
Following the emergence and initiation of routine genomic surveillance for VOC in Canada,
these results demonstrate that the epidemiology of the VOCs is similar to that of wild type
SARS-CoV-2 in disproportionately affecting essential workers and in economically marginalized
neighbourhoods (3,4). The recent VOC growth rate is faster in these neighbourhoods which
may now be entering the “third wave” of the pandemic, showing a disproportionate burden of
illness. The rapid emergence and concentration of VOCs has been described as a separate
epidemic from that of non-VOC SARS-CoV-2. However, in 2021, VOCs have rapidly
concentrated in the same networks where both cases and associated morbidity and mortality
have been concentrated throughout almost the entire COVID-19 pandemic suggesting
prevention needs in these communities remain unmet. This is further supported by the fact that
during the entirety of the study period, the Toronto and Peel region have been under a state of
significant societal restrictions, with closures of non-essential businesses, restaurants, bars,
fitness centers, and legislation limiting public and private gatherings.
The finding that VOC are rapidly spreading through the same transmission networks as wild
type SARS-CoV-2, and during a period of ongoing societal restrictions on mobility and shelterin-place recommendations, suggests the need for targeted and tailored interventions to interrupt
transmission chains in essential worker communities, including workplaces and households.

Service-based public health strategies include resources to improve quarantine and isolation
including financial supports, paid leave, and voluntary temporary housing support. Moreover,
interventions in essential businesses could include technical support for infection prevention and
control in essential workplaces and outreach-based testing strategies adaptive to lived realities
of essential workers. Finally, given the concentration of transmissions in the context of
workplaces and their overlap with household density (3), vaccination at workplace and among
subgroups with high rates of contact (i.e. essential workers) represents a potential prioritization
strategy to mitigate transmissions, severe outcomes and VOC growth (9, 10)
The limitations of these analyses include the use of ecological data, rather than individual-level
data on income and occupation for this analysis; and the potential for differential SARS-CoV-2
testing across tertiles. Proportionally there has been less testing in lower-income
neighbourhoods (3) resulting in the potential for underestimating both wild-type in VOC cases in
economically marginalized communities.
Restrictive intervention strategies have represented the foundation of most COVID-19 public
health interventions. Given that VOCs rapidly spread in the same transmission networks as
wild-type SARS-CoV-2, and their emergence during a period of intensive societal restrictions,
suggests supportive measures in these communities are needed. Moving forward necessitates
ensuring that public health measures avoid reinforcing underlying inequities by leveraging
resource and service-based strategies to minimize the future spread of novel VOC and
associated morbidity and mortality.
