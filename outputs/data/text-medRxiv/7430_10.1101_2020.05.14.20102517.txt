Abstract
Background
Nasal High Flow (NHF) therapy delivers flows of heated humidified gases up to 60 LPM (litres per minute)
via a nasal cannula. Particles of oral/nasal fluid released by patients undergoing NHF therapy may pose a
cross-infection risk, which is a potential concern for treating COVID-19 patients.
Methods
Liquid particles within the exhaled breath of healthy participants were measured with two protocols: (1)
high speed camera imaging and counting exhaled particles under high magnification (6 participants) and
(2) measuring the deposition of a chemical marker (riboflavin-5-monophosphate) at a distance of 100 and
500 mm on filter papers through which air was drawn (10 participants). The filter papers were assayed
with HPLC. Breathing conditions tested included quiet (resting) breathing and vigorous breathing (which
here means nasal snorting, voluntary coughing and voluntary sneezing). Unsupported (natural) breathing
and NHF at 30 and 60 LPM were compared.
Results
(1) Imaging: During quiet breathing, no particles were recorded with unsupported breathing or 30
LPM NHF (detection limit for single particles 33 m). Particles were detected in 2 of 6 participants
at 60 LPM quiet breathing at approximately 10% of the rate caused by unsupported vigorous
breathing. Unsupported vigorous breathing released the greatest numbers of particles. Vigorous
breathing with NHF at 60 LPM, released half the number of particles compared to vigorous
breathing without NHF.
(2) Chemical marker tests: No oral/nasal fluid was detected in quiet breathing without NHF (detection
limit 0.28 L/m3). In quiet breathing with NHF at 60 LPM, small quantities were detected in 4 out
of 29 quiet breathing tests, not exceeding 17 L/m3. Vigorous breathing released 200-1000 times
more fluid than the quiet breathing with NHF. The quantities detected in vigorous breathing were
similar whether using NHF or not.
Conclusion
During quiet breathing, 60 LPM NHF therapy may cause oral/nasal fluid to be released as particles, at
levels of tens of L per cubic metre of air.
Vigorous breathing (snort, cough or sneeze) releases 200 to 1000 times more oral/nasal fluid than quiet
breathing. During vigorous breathing, 60 LPM NHF therapy caused no statistically significant difference in
the quantity of oral/nasal fluid released compares to unsupported breathing.
NHF use does not increase the risk of dispersing infectious aerosols above the risk of unsupported vigorous
breathing. Standard infection prevention and control measures should apply when dealing with a patient
who has an acute respiratory infection, independent of which, if any, respiratory support is being used.

Introduction
Nasal high flow (NHF) has been increasingly used as an intervention for type 1 respiratory failure.
Appropriate use of NHF has been shown to reduce intubation rates, which carries a risk of infection
transmission for both patients (Frat et al. 2015, Rochwerg et al.2019), and healthcare workers (Tran et al.
2012).
Concerns have been raised about a potential risk of NHF spreading infection by generating aerosols and
droplets when used to support patients with acute respiratory infections. NHF therapy is classed by some
countries as an aerosol generating procedure (AGP). A systematic review of AGP and risk of transmission
of acute respiratory infections (ARI) to healthcare workers (HCW) reported that more invasive respiratory
procedures such as tracheal intubation, tracheotomy and manual ventilation were a significant risk factors
for SARS transmission (Tran et al. 2012). This was based on a single cohort study during the SARS outbreak
in Canada in 2003, which was before NHF was in clinical use (Raboud et al. 2010). In this study, lack of
adherence to infection prevention and control practices was identified as a major contributor for HCW
acquisition of SARS. The risk of transmission of ARI associated with AGP is very topical with the current
COVID-19 pandemic. Clinicians must choose which respiratory therapies they apply, taking into
consideration patient acuity, reduction of escalation, and minimizing virus transmission to healthcare
workers.
Some countries or healthcare systems have guidance against using NHF for patients with COVID-19
infection, while others are using NHF as a first line therapy. Interestingly, there does not appear any
substantive evidence of NHF causing large dispersions of infectious aerosols and infecting heathcare
workers. In fact, the low number of relevant dispersion studies and lack of understanding of infection
transmission has been highlighted in three recent publications (Bahl et al. 2020, Mittal et al. 2020, Wilson
et al. 2020).
This study compares the release of particles of oral/nasal fluids during quiet resting breathing, snorting,
voluntary coughing and voluntary sneezing, both in the absence of respiratory therapy and when receiving
NHF at 30 and 60 LPM (litres per minute). Two techniques are used to determine volumes of oral/nasal
fluid released: high speed optical video microscopy and air sampling with a chemical marker instilled into
the nose and mouth. It is our hope that this data will inform evidence-based decisions about using NHF,
particularly for patients with ARI.

Methods
Definitions
In the terminology commonly accepted in healthcare, aerosols are suspensions of small particles,
including droplet nuclei, with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 µm or less. Droplets are particles with an
aerodynamic diameter of > 10 µm. Airborne transmission in a healthcare setting refers to transmission by
aerosols of < 10 µm (Tellier et al. 2019). Particles in either size class can be inhaled, causing virus transfer,
depending on proximity and air currents.
(1) Imaging method
Six healthy volunteers participated: three females aged 20 to 27 years, and three males aged 26 to 59
years. Participants wore a medium size Optiflow™ (OPT544, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, Auckland, New
Zealand) NHF cannula. Air flows conditioned to 37oC and 100% relative humidity (44mg/L) were generated
with an AIRVO™ 2 humidifier-flow generator (Fisher & Paykel Healthcare). Participants were instructed to
breathe with their mouth closed to create higher nasal velocities more likely to release particles. All
participants spent at least five minutes acclimatizing to NHF at 30 LPM. Prior to each measurement, 1 mL
of 0.9% NaCl solution was instilled into each nostril to artificially moisten the nasal mucosa. Saline has a
lower viscosity than nasal mucous and is more easily atomized. 1 ml was assumed sufficient as excess ran
out of the nose.
Participants sat with their chin and forehead on a rest. A region of approximately 40 × 30 mm directly
below the participants’ nostrils was imaged with a high-speed camera (Motion Pro X3™, 1040 frames per
second, shutter speed of 40 s and resolution 1280×1024 pixels, Redlake Imaging Corp.). The region was
backlit such that particles and the outline of the nose cast a shadow onto the camera (Figure 1). The left
and right nostrils were imaged separately because the camera’s depth of field (20mm) could encompass
only one nostril entirely.
Videos were analyzed using a Java-based image processing program (Image J, National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, MD, USA) for particle frequency, diameter and velocity. The number of particles were recorded
in bins with diameter of 0-50, 50-100, 100-150, 200-500, 500-1000, 1000-2000 and 2000-5000 μm. The
smallest detectable particle occupies one pixel i.e. has a diameter of 33.0 µm.

Quiet breathing (at rest) with no therapy, with 30LPM NHF, and with 60LPM NHF.
Voluntary snort (mouth-closed maximum effort nasal exhale) with no therapy, with 30LPM NHF,

There were three repeats at each experimental condition.
Chemical marker method
Ten healthy volunteers (aged 23-48, 1 female and 9 male) participated. Participants sat in a chair with a
headrest. Each participant carried out the sequence of actions described in Table 1. The order of the notherapy and 60 LPM therapy actions was randomized. Participants acclimatized to the 60 LPM therapy for
a few minutes before beginning the NHF tests. Where NHF was used, an OptiflowTM+ cannula (OPT946,
OPT944, OPT942) was selected, and was used with an AirvoTM2 humidifier set to 37oC and 100% relative
humidity (44 mg/L). Immediately before each measurement, the participant instilled 0.5 mL of marker
solution into each nostril, and for coughing and sneezing, an additional 1 mL onto their tongue, via pipette.
The marker solution was 2.8 grams of riboflavin 5’ monophosphate sodium salt hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich,
St Louis, MO, USA, F6750-25G, fluorimetric grade, 73-76% purity) per litre of deionized water.

Table 1: Actions for chemical marker test.

Air was sampled at a distance of either 100 mm or 500 mm from the participant’s nose, using 125 mm
diameter qualitative filter paper (Whatman plc, Little Chalfont, Bucks, UK, product number 1005-125)
supported on an acrylic grille through which air was drawn at 2.2-18.1 LPM with a vacuum pump. The air
flow rate was measured with a TSI 4040 meter (TSI Inc. Shoreview, MN, USA). This sampling system was
placed to intercept the maximum exhaled nasal velocity, determined for each test after the participant
found a position they could maintain comfortably for the duration. The filter papers were stored in Petri
dishes (used as delivered in clean sterile packaging) and frozen for later analysis. A clean grille was used
after each block of quiet breathing tests, and after each snort, cough or sneeze.
Background measurements (7 min duration) were run before and after each participant. No riboflavin was
detected in any of these, indicating the room ventilation was adequate to prevent contamination between
tests.
For quantitative analysis, the samples were brought to room temperature and riboflavin was extracted
from the filter paper using 3.5 ml of Milli-Q water (Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) with 5 minutes
of gentle agitation. 1.5 mL of the supernatant was drawn off and expelled through a 0.45 m filter into
HPLC vials. These were analyzed with a Dionex UHPLC Focused (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA) fitted with an autosampler, Ultimate® 3000 pump, and Ultimate® 3000 fluorescence detector. 20 µL
samples were injected into a Kinetex 5 µm C18 100 Å, 100 x 2.1 mm LC Column (Phenomenex, Torrance,
CA, USA). The mobile phase was 95% NH4HCO3 and 5% methanol. Samples were run at a column
temperature of 35oC, pressure of 62 bar and an isocratic flow rate of 0.2 mLPM for a total run time of 36
minutes.
A six-point external standard calibration curve (0, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1000 ng/mL) of 95% purity
riboflavin 5’ monophosphate (Sigma Aldrich, F8399) was used for the quantification of samples and the
calibration standards were analyzed prior to starting the sample sequence. Milli-Q blanks were analyzed
after the calibration standards and after every 14 samples to ensure there was no carry-over from the

previous runs. A 100 ng/mL check standard was run after every sample sequence to confirm the validity
of the calibration curve. Calibration standards and samples were analyzed in duplicate aliquots.
Chromeleon (c) Dionex (Version 7.2.7.10369) software was used for peak fitting and calibration.
The concentration of oral/nasal fluid emitted by the participant and collected by the sampling system was
calculated using the concentration of the riboflavin, the air flow rate through the filter paper, the duration
of the test, and the volume of Milli-Q water used to extract the riboflavin.
The duplicate aliquots agreed within 4% except for two instances in which four overlapping peaks were
fitted at the riboflavin retention time.
The detection limit was determined by visual assessment of the signal-to-noise ratio to be 2.75 ng/ml
riboflavin per unit volume of supernatant, which was equivalent to the concentrations of oral/nasal fluid
given in Table 2.

Results
(1) Imaging
During quiet breathing with no therapy and with 30 LPM NHF, no particles were detected for any of the
participants tested. Particles were detected during quiet breathing with 60 LPM NHF, for two of the six
participants.
When snorting, five out of six participants produced visible particles in all conditions. An example image
is shown in Figure 2. The particles ranged in diameter from the smallest detectable size of 33 µm to 5000
µm (5mm) in diameter. Interpersonal variation was large. One (female) participant produced no
detectable particles with NHF at 60LPM.

and bars show the range from minimum to maximum. White bars are no therapy, grey bars are 60 LPM
NHF. The solid line is the maximum detectability limit and the dashed line is the minimum (as detectability
depends on air flow rate).

Oral/nasal fluid was not detected in quiet resting breathing without NHF therapy. Oral/nasal fluid was
detected 4 times in 29 tests in quiet breathing with NHF therapy. It never exceeded 17 L per cubic metre
of sampled air, and counting only those instances where it was detected, it was at a mean level of 6.3 L
per cubic metre of sampled air. This was 1/200 th of the average level detected in snort, cough or sneeze.
It was detected in two cases during quiet breathing where this was the first action the participant did, and
in two cases where they completed no-therapy actions first.
With no therapy, oral/nasal fluid was detected in quantities exceeding 633 L per cubic metre in all snorts,
nine out of ten coughs, and nine out of ten sneezes.
With NHF (60 LPM), oral/nasal fluid was detected in quantities exceeding 483 L per cubic metre in all
snorts, 9 out of 10 coughs, and all sneezes.
Snort, cough and sneeze all release the same order of magnitude of oral/nasal fluid. The quantities
detected in with-therapy and no-therapy cases are of similar order of magnitude.

Discussion
To our knowledge this is the first study to compare the optical video-microscopy and chemical marker
methods for oral/nasal fluid dispersion in the presence and absence of NHF. It was evident from both
measurement modalities that high energy respiratory maneuvers like coughing, sneezing and snorting
generated high volumes of particles, either with or without NHF, compared to quiet breathing. Higher
expired flow velocities are expected to generate stronger shear forces over the mucosa, generating more
airborne particles (Mittal et al. 2020). Interestingly, the higher therapy flow rate (60 LPM) released more
particles than 30 LPM, but not twice as many.
During vigorous breathing there were fewer particles produced with NHF than without NHF. This was true
at both flow rates in the imaging tests, and true when averaged over snort, cough and sneeze in the
marker tests. NHF’s apparent mitigation of particle generation during vigorous breathing may be
explained by particles impacting on the cannula interface. Another possible explanation is that NHF
imposes an expiratory flow resistance that increases expiratory time (Mundel et al. 2013) and reduces the
peak expiratory flow (Spence et al. 2010). Although NHF contributes to higher nasal velocities (Spence et
al. 2012), patient peak expiratory velocities are lower and particle generation reduced. There is high
interpersonal variation in both datasets, with standard deviations typically twice the mean. Besides
interpersonal differences in mucosa and air velocity, the air sampling does not capture the entire particle
plume.
For the oral/nasal fluid collection, it should be noted that with quiet breathing alone there were no
detectable levels in the twenty nine measurements, while the addition of 60 LPM NHF increased this to
four out of twenty nine tests with detectable volumes. However, these quiet breathing measurements
were taken over a seven-minute period, and produced 200 to 1000 times lower volumes of oral/nasal
fluid than the higher energy respiratory maneuvers of coughing, sneezing and snorting achieved in a 30
second period. Looking at this another way, coughing with no therapy produced 633 L/m3 in half a
minute i.e. (1,266 L/m3/min). Quiet breathing with NHF at 60 LPM produced on average 1.72 L/m3 in
7 minutes (0.246 L/m3/min). It would take 86 hours of quiet breathing with NHF at 60 LPM to release
the same quantity of oral/nasal fluid as a minute of coughing with no therapy (1,266/1.72=5,146 mins or
86 hours). Cough is a common symptom for coronavirus, with a recent study reporting an average cough
frequency of 17 events in a 30 min test (Leung et al. 2020).
It has been postulated that a higher clinical acuity Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) patient
will generate more particles due to a higher work of breathing, increased closing capacity and altered
respiratory tract fluid (Wilson et al. 2020). In a recent study using a green laser and an iPhone camera, it
was demonstrated that a healthy participant generates droplets/particles when speaking, with the
number of detectable particles increasing with speech volume. The number of particles was markedly
reduced when talking through a slightly damped washcloth (Anfinrud et al. 2020). In an ICU based study
by Leung et al. (2019), Petri dishes were positioned at 0.4 and 1.5 m around critically ill patients with
Gram-negative bacterial pneumonia. The results suggested that there was no increase of surface or air
contamination using NHF compared to conventional oxygen masks (Leung et al. 2019). A simulation
breathing manikin and smoke generation system, in conjunction with laser sheet light and high resolution
imaging system was used to quantify air dispersion in some elegant research by Hui et al. (2014, 2019).

The simulation work demonstrated that NHF was no worse, and was arguably better, than the CPAP
systems used as a comparison. A study using a manikin assessed the potential for pathogen dispersal
during NHF and found detection of water and yeast only in the proximal locations, < 60 cm from the face
(Kotoda et al. 2020).
One study had five healthy participants sit in a chair, gargle 10 ml of food coloring then cough, and
measure how far the visible droplets went on paper on the floor. They reported that the discernable
particles traveled on average 2.48 m with no therapy and 2.91 m with NHF at 60 LPM (Loh et al. 2020).
While this rudimentary methodology implies NHF may have increase the dispersion distance slightly, both
are further than the 2 m frequently stated as a safe distance in guidelines (Bahl et al., 2020). These findings
were reinforced by a study from two hospitals in Wuhan, China that measured the dispersion distance of
Coronavirus 2 in the ICU and ward environments, and found virus nucleic acid up to 4 m from the patient
beds (Gou et al. 2020).
The study’s findings are in general concordance with these other published studies of particle dispersion
with NHF. However there is still a dearth of high quality data regarding aerosol and droplet generation,
and this should be resolved to improve the understanding of the possible mechanism of transmission, and
to inform evidence based guidelines for health care workers treating patients infected with Covid-19 and
related diseases (Bahl et al. 2020).
Many clinical interventions and therapies are considered to have the potential to generate aerosols,
including standard oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation, intubation, nebulisation and NHF therapy. It
is important to gain a full understanding of the potential benefits of using any of these therapies in the
context of any associated risks. The mechanism of droplet and aerosol virus transmission is also not fully
understood. The emerging evidence suggests the generation of numbers of particles increases with the
vigor of the respiratory activity.
The potential benefits of using NHF therapy should be weighed against the risks. One of the primary
indications for use of NHF is treating type 1 respiratory failure. In a large RCT conducted in 23 ICU’s in
France and Belgium involving 310 participants, NHF was reported to reduce intubation rates compared to
non-rebreather face mask or NIV for a subgroup of those with Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure (AHRF)
and a PaO2:FIO2 of 200 mm Hg or less, of whom the majority had community acquired pneumonia (Frat
et al. 2015). This study by Frat et al. (2015) was one of nine RCTs synthesized in a meta-analysis comparing
standard oxygen to NHF in AHRF (Rochwerg et al. 2019). The results of this meta-analysis suggested a
reduced intubation rate and escalation of oxygen therapy (Rochwerg et al. 2019). It could be argued that
if using NHF reduces the need for intubation, employing a pragmatic approach could improve the outcome
for the patient, by reducing the use of more invasive therapies, and reduce the exposure risk to the HCW.
A systematic review of SARS-related literature conducted to understand the risk of transmission to
healthcare workers from aerosol-generating procedures (Tran et al. 2012), reported that intubation was
a high-risk procedure. The same review reported oxygen, high flow oxygen or BiPap mask were low risk.
There is also some evidence that humidity may play a role in preserving the ability of the mucous
membrane to resist the infection (Lauc et al. 2020), modelling work that suggests increased humidity may

inhibit the displacement of expelled particles (Xie et al. 2007), and that coronaviruses are humidity and
temperature sensitive (Lauc et al. 2020), so there is speculation the higher temperatures and humidity
levels of NHF might reduce the viable virus dispersion compared to dry gas therapy. In one recent study
on COVID-19 patients, NHF was reported to be the most common ventilation support, although it was
used to greater success in the patients with PaO2/FiO2 ratios above 200. (Wang et al. 2020)
There is speculation that NHF may increase the chances of aerosol generation and COVID-19 transmission.
However, there is a lack of evidence to support that NHF is any worse than other low risk respiratory
therapy such as oxygen therapy or NIV, and its use may avoid the need for high risk procedures such as
intubation.
This study had numerous limitations: all participants were healthy; there was a narrow age distribution
(although previous research indicates no reason to expect different results from other participants. Tobin
et al. (1983), for example, measured the breathing patterns of 65 healthy participants from 20 to 81 years
of age and found no effect of age on the mean values of various breathing pattern components); all
participants were in a sitting position and a supine position may give different results; the imaging could
not detect particles of less than 33 microns in diameter; the chemical marker could not discriminate on
particle size, and due to the limited physical size of the filter paper, might not collect all of the discharge
plume. In both methods, some of the sample fluid used to moisten the mucosa was swallowed. In both
methods the instilled fluid was either saline or water and as such, be more easily atomized and/or produce
smaller diameter particles. There was considerable variability in the results. It is speculated that this large
variability is due to a range of factors including: some of the 1 ml sample going down the throat premeasurement, and the variability of simulated snorting, coughing and sneezing.

Conclusions
60 LPM NHF therapy may cause some small quantity of oral/nasal fluid to be released during quiet
breathing, at levels of less than 17 L per cubic metre of air. The addition of a filter barrier may be
indicated.
Vigorous breathing (snort, cough or sneeze) releases 200 to 1000 times more oral/nasal fluid than quiet
breathing.
60 LPM NHF does not make the levels of oral/nasal fluid emitted during cough, snort or sneeze greater
compared to unsupported breathing.
We do not find evidence for large numbers of particles being dispersed by NHF, compared to cough or
sneeze. NHF is a useful therapy for Type 1 Respiratory failure and reducing escalation to high infection
risk procedures like intubation.
Vigorous breathing without NHF is the worst-case scenario that should drive infection prevention and
control measures. The use of NHF, per se, does not increase the risk of generation of infectious airborne
aerosols above the risk of patient-generated aerosols. Adherence to standard contact and droplet
precautions are sufficient when NHF is applied.
