Abstract
Purpose
To evaluate diagnostic performance of greyscale and inverted greyscale Chest X-ray (CXR) using
Computed Tomography (CT) scan as a gold standard.
Methods
In this retrospective study, electronic medical records of 120 patients who had valid CXR and
High-resolution CT (HRCT) within less than 24 hours after having a positive COVID-19 RT-PCR
test during the period from May 19th to May 23rd 2020 in a single tertiary care center were
reviewed.
PA chest radiographs were presented on 2 occasions to 5 radiologists to evaluate the role and
appropriateness of greyscale and inverted greyscale chest radiographs (CXR). The images were
viewed on high-specification viewing systems using a primary display monitors and compared it
to computed tomography (CT) findings for screening and management of suspected or confirmed
COVID-19 patients.
Results
Ninety-six (80%) patients had positive CT findings, 81 (67.5%) had positive grey scale CXR
lesions, and 25 (20.8%) had better detection in the inverted grey scale CXR. The CXR sensitivity
for COVID-19 pneumonia was 93.8% (95% CI (86.2% - 98.0%) and the specificity was 48.7%
(95% CI (32.4% - 65.2%). The CXR sensitivity of detection of lung lesions was slightly higher in
male (95.1% (95% CI (86.3% - 99.0%)) than female (90.0% (95% CI (68.3% - 98.8%)), while the
specificity was 48.0% (95% CI (27.8% - 68.7%) and 50.0% (95% CI (23.0% - 77.0%) in males
and females, respectively. However, no significant difference was detected in ROC area between
men and women.
Conclusions
The sensitivity of detection of lung lesions of CXR was relatively high, particularly in men. The
results of the study support the idea of considering conventional radiographs as an important
diagnostic tool in suspected COVID-19 patients especially in healthcare facilities where there is
no access to HRCT scans.

1. Introduction
The pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus named COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2, was first
reported in China in December 2019 followed by widespread into all other countries in the world.
Millions of confirmed cases have been found in the world [1]. COVID-19 clinical spectrum varies
from asymptomatic or mild symptoms in most of the cases to severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS), which may lead to death.
Most of the countries over the world are adopting molecular assay to screen for COVID-19
infection based on WHO guidelines [2]. Suspected COVID-19 patients are often seen in
emergency department, trial to develop new strategies to diagnosed COVID-19 patients rapidly is
the current challenge as the gold standard RT-PCR results need several hours, and have more than
5% false negative rates [3,4]. There are multiple typical features on chest HRCT which help in the
treatment plan of suspected COVID-19 patients till the RT-PCR results are available such as
bilateral, peripheral ground-glass opacities with or without consolidations predominantly affecting
posterior segments [5]; however, the challenge of continuous infection control between the cases
and the huge burden for the radiology departments should be taken into consideration [6].
Chest X-ray is widely available in emergency departments in particular, to complete the
assessment of patients with respiratory symptoms or sepsis with minimal risk of cross infection as
the surface of portable unit can be cleaned easily. Moreover, COVID-19 patients manifest with
characteristic chest x-ray imaging features, which are helpful for the early detection of COVID-19
pneumonic changes as well as reflecting the severity of disease and following it up by comparing
pre and post treatment changes [7]. However, the diagnostic performance of CXR in COVID-19
patients is not yet thoroughly investigated. This study aimed to evaluate diagnostic performance
of greyscale and inverted greyscale CXR with CT scan as a gold standard in COVID-19 patients.

2. Materials and method
2.1. Study population
All suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the emergency department in a single
tertiary care center in Abu Dhabi, UAE, who had RT-PCR test during the period from May 19th to
May 23rd 2020 were eligible for this study. A total of 250 patients were admitted during the study
period. Among them, 127 patients with negative RT-PCR results, no x-ray and HRCT of chest

within 24 hours or had duplicate medical record numbers were excluded. A total of 120 COVID19 positive patients who had chest X-ray and confirmatory HRCT chest within less than 24 hours
from RT-PCR test results were included in the analysis.
The electronic medical records of these 120 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic
data on patients’ age and sex were extracted, and chest radiographs were reanalyzed.
Ethics approval was obtained from the local Research Ethics Committee (Abu Dhabi COVID19
Research Ethics Committee) Ref: DOH/CVDC/2020/1126.
2.2. Imaging technique and analysis
Five radiologists interpreted the chest radiographs during two reading sessions in standard view
and inverted grey-scale view on primary display system. Primary display systems are used for
interpretation of medical images, as in radiology. They have to meet strict performance criteria.
On the other hand, secondary display systems are used by staff other than radiologists, usually
after an interpretative report has been rendered. Chest X-ray was considered positive if alveolar,
reticular opacity or both were found on CXR. All findings were compared to HRCT chest done
within less than 24 hours. A high-resolution CT scan was performed in all patients with 64-slice
multi-detector row CT scanners (VCT GE -64). Patients were scanned during breath hold
craniocaudally in the supine position, from the lung apices to the costo-phrenic angles. The
acquisition parameters were as follows: tube voltage 120 kV, tube current 100-600 mA, dose
modulation by smart MA, pitch 1. The slice collimation 64x 0.625, slice width 0.625 x 0.625. The
1.25 mm or 2.5 mm thick images were reconstructed using lung window and a high-frequency
reconstruction algorithm, then stored in the PACS system. Air purifier is fixed inside the scanner
room and COVIDCIDE wipes are used to disinfect the scanner after completion of each
examination. Sensitivity and specificity were used to assess accuracy based on presence or absence
of lung changes. Patients with positive lung lesions manifested with patchy ground-glass opacity,
linear opacities, or consolidations.
2.3. Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics of patients’ demographic (age, sex) and imaging (X-ray, CT) characteristics
are reported as means (standard deviation (SD)) and numbers and relative frequencies. The
diagnostic performance of standard grey scale CXR was estimated using CT results as gold

standard. Specificity, Sensitivity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and total
accuracy of chest X- ray were estimated. The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve
analysis was used to calculate the area under the curve (AUC). The analysis was performed using
STATA version 16.1 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA), and p-value less than 0.05 defined
statistical significance.
3. Results
3.1. Demographic and imaging data
The analysis included 120 confirmed cases of COVID-19. The majority of patients were male (86;
71.7%) with a mean age of 46.9 years (standard deviation 13.7 years) (Table 1). Ninety-six (80%)
patients had positive CT findings, 81 (67.5%) had positive grey scale CXR lesions, and 25 (20.8%)
had better detection in the inverted grey scale CXR (Table 1).
3.2. X-ray features
Representative chest radiograph of COVID-19 pneumonia in a male patient (Figure 1) is showing
subtle ground-glass opacity in CXR at the left lower zone with adjacent atelectatic changes (A)
seen as well in the inverted greyscale image (B). Axial chest CT (C) and coronal view (D)
confirmed the findings and are showing bilateral peripheral and central patchy ground-glass
opacities.
Another representative CXR of COVID-19 pneumonia (Figure 3) is showing a subtle groundglass opacity at the base of both lungs with patchy opacity in the left middle zone (A), better seen
in inverted greyscale image (B). Coronal chest CT images (C, D & E) confirmed the findings.
3.3. X-ray diagnostic performance
Using CT results as gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of standard Greyscale CXR were
93.8% (95% CI (86.2% - 98.0%) and 48.7% (95% CI (32.4% - 65.2%), respectively (Table 2).
Five cases out of 81 showed false positive results in CXR and 20 cases out of 39 showed false
negative results. ROC area of standard grey scale CXR to CT was 0.713 (95% CI (0.629 - 0 .796).
Inverted grey scale showed similar findings compare to standard grey scale CXR in 95 patients
(79.2%), however better detection of lung lesions was noted in 25 patients (20.8% of the cases).
The CXR sensitivity of detection of lung lesions was better in male (95.1% (95% CI (86.3% - 99.0%))

than female (90.0% (95% CI (68.3% - 98.8%)), while the specificity was 48.0% (95% CI (27.8% 68.7%) and 50.0% (95% CI (23.0% - 77.0%) in males and females, respectively (Table 3).
However, no significant difference was detected in ROC area between males and females (ROC
area is 0. 715in male, 0.700 in female).
4. Discussion
CXR showed high sensitivity for detecting lung lesions in HRCT confirmed COVID-19 patients.
The performance was relatively higher in men than women. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first review and analysis of the diagnostic performance of standard and inverted grey-scale
CXR in detection of lung lesions in COVID-19 patients with correlation to chest HRCT.
The results of the study support the idea of considering conventional radiographs as an important
diagnostic test in suspected COVID-19 patients. The burden imposed by the COVID-19
pandemic on healthcare institutions highlighted the need to use a fast and available tool like
chest x-ray to prioritize patients’ management and predict results. Therefore, CXR can play an
important role in the detection of lung changes, while chest HRCT can have a complementary
role in evaluating disease severity, progression and complications [9,10]. Prior studies on the
pattern and frequency of CXR and CT opacities in COVID-19 positive patients have
demonstrated that opacities are typically peripheral, basilar and bilateral in distribution
predominantly affecting right lower lobe, especially on early stages of the disease [8,11,12,13].
Studies have reported that 33% to 86% of COVID-19 chest CTs showed peripheral lung
distribution [6, 14]. On the other hand, chest x-ray may in many cases show unilateral air space
opacities involving a single lobe, and this may still raise the possibility of COVID-19 pneumonia
as it is challenging to identify all pneumonic changes on a limited CXR. In such cases, HRCT of
the chest can help and may show the typical bilateral peripheral pneumonic changes as in (Fig. 1)
The high sensitivity found in our study indicate that CXR is highly helpful in identifying such
lesions in COVID-19 positive patients. The false positive CXR findings could be attributed to the
overlapping of soft tissue which give ground glass opacity mimicking COVID-19 changes or old
atelectasis.
However, CXR findings in COVID-19 patients might not be specific, and can be seen with other
infections, including influenza, SARS, MERS and H1N1 [11,15].

Our findings showed a relatively lower specificity levels of CXR compared to HRCT as gold
standard. Although, COVID-19 is considered a serious disease and high specificity would be
preferred to avoid making false negative diagnosis, the low specificity found in this study could
be attributed to mild cases not developing lung lesions that could be detected by CXR [16].
Moreover, the United Arab Emirates is undertaking an intensified testing campaign for COVID19 accompanied by strong awareness program with early diagnosis and management of the cases.
Therefore, many early detected positive COVID-19 cases might need time to develop lung
manifestations which can be detected by CXR. A repeated CXR would be warranted in suspected
patients.
The study had the advantage of having chest HRCT within less than 24 hours of performing
portable chest x-ray for all COVID-19 positive patients and it also checked for the effect of using
inverted greyscale images compared to standard grey scale CXR images. Interestingly, the inverted
greyscale CXR showed better detection of lesions in 20.8% of the cases (fig. 2) than standard
greyscale CXR.
Conclusions
The sensitivity of detection of lung lesions of CXR was relatively high, particularly in men. The
results of the study support the idea of considering conventional radiographs with standard and
inverted greyscale images as an important diagnostic tool in suspected COVID-19 patients at the
emergency departments, especially in healthcare facilities where access to HRCT scan does not
exist.
