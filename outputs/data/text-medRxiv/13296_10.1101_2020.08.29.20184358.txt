ABSTRACT
Patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) are at high risk for thrombotic arterial and
venous occlusions. However, bleeding complications have also been observed in some
patients. Understanding the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis will help inform
optimal approaches to thrombosis prophylaxis and potential utility of fibrinolytic-targeted
therapies. 118 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 30 healthy controls were included in the
study. We measured plasma antigen levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and
plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and performed spontaneous clot-lysis assays. We
found markedly elevated tPA and PAI-1 levels in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Both
factors demonstrated strong correlations with neutrophil counts and markers of neutrophil
activation. High levels of tPA and PAI-1 were associated with worse respiratory status. High
levels of tPA, in particular, were strongly correlated with mortality and a significant enhancement
in spontaneous ex vivo clot-lysis. While both tPA and PAI-1 are elevated among COVID-19
patients, extremely high levels of tPA enhance spontaneous fibrinolysis and are significantly
associated with mortality in some patients. These data indicate that fibrinolytic homeostasis in
COVID-19 is complex with a subset of patients expressing a balance of factors that may favor
fibrinolysis. Further study of tPA as a biomarker is warranted.

INTRODUCTION
The close relationship between COVID-19 and thrombosis is of significant clinical importance.
There are increasing reports of venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients1,2, and arterial
thrombosis including strokes and myocardial infarctions have been described2,3. Histopathology
of lung specimens from patients with severe disease demonstrate fibrin-based occlusion of
small vessels4-6.

COVID-19 is characterized in most patients by minimum prolongation of activated partial
thromboplastin time (aPTT) and/or prothrombin time (PT), and mild, if any, thrombocytopenia7,8
suggesting that it is distinct from traditional descriptions of sepsis-induced coagulopathy9,10.
There are several (possibly synergistic) mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may result
in macrovascular and microvascular occlusions including cytokine-mediated activation of
leukocytes, endothelium, and platelets; hypoxic vasoconstriction; direct activation of endothelial
cells by viral transduction11; and potentiation of thrombosis by neutrophil extracellular traps
(NETs)12-15. At the same time, bleeding has been described in some patients with COVID-19.
For example, a recent multicenter observation of 400 patients hospitalized with COVID-19
demonstrated an overall bleeding rate of 4.8% and a severe bleeding event (World Health
Organization grade 3 or 4) rate of 2.3%16.

Fibrinolysis is a tightly controlled process whereby a fibrin-rich thrombus is degraded and
remodeled by the protease plasmin17. This process is regulated by plasminogen activators and
inhibitors with the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin being the end result that supports
fibrinolysis17. The interplay of plasminogen activators—both tissue-type (tPA) and urokinasetype (uPA)—and their principal inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), plays a key
role in regulating fibrinolytic activity17. Impaired fibrinolysis has been suggested among COVID19 patients, which could further heighten thrombotic risk. This has been evidenced by markedly
reduced clot lysis at 30 minutes via thromboelastography (TEG) in critically-ill patients with
COVID-1918. Ex vivo evaluation of COVID-19 plasma also noted a prolonged clot lysis time,
which was more pronounced among critically-ill COVID-19 patients19. Furthermore, a case
series demonstrated that 11 of 21 COVID-19 patients who underwent rotational
thromboelastometry in an intensive care unit met the criteria for fibrinolytic shutdown; 9 of those
11 patients developed thrombosis during their hospitalization20. Elevated PAI-1 levels observed
in COVID-19 patients has further suggested impaired fibrinolytic ability21. The cause of this
fibrinolytic shutdown has yet to be elucidated. Here, we aimed to evaluate the potential roles of

tPA and PAI-1 in regulating fibrinolytic homeostasis among COVID-19 patients. Given that both
bleeding and clotting have been described in COVID-19, we hypothesized that plasma of some
patients would demonstrate fibrinolytic shutdown while plasma of others might present a hyperfibrinolytic state.

METHODS
Human samples. Plasma from 118 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were used in this
study. Blood was collected into EDTA by a trained phlebotomist. After completion of
hematological testing ordered by the clinician, the remaining plasma was stored at 4°C for up to
48 hours before it was released to the research laboratory. Samples were immediately divided
into aliquots and stored at -80°C until testing. All 118 patients had a confirmed COVID-19
diagnosis based on FDA-approved RNA testing. This study complied with all relevant ethical
regulations and was approved by the University of Michigan IRB (HUM00179409). Healthy
volunteers were recruited through a posted flyer; exclusion criteria for controls included history
of a systemic autoimmune disease, active infection, and pregnancy. The 30 controls included 20
females and 10 males, mean age of 41.7 ± 14.4. All COVID-19 plasma samples were treated
with solvent/detergent (0.3% v/v tri-(n-butyl) phosphate and 1% Triton X-100) to inactivate the
virus22. Control plasma samples were similarly treated with the same solvent/detergent.
Measurement of PAI-1 and tPA antigen. Total PAI-1 and tPA protein was measured as
described 23. Briefly, 25 μg of either rabbit anti-human PAI-1 (Molecular Innovations) or mouse
anti-human tPA clone 2A153 (Molecular Innovations) was coupled to color-coded
superparamagnetic beads. 25 μL of standard or diluted sample and 25 μL coupled beads (4000)
were incubated for 2 hours in the dark. 25 μL of 2 μg/mL biotinylated rabbit anti-hPAI-1 or
biotinylated rabbit anti-htPA antibody (Molecular Innovations) was added to the plate, followed
by incubating with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin. The plate was read with a Luminex®
100 System; the setting was 100 μL sample size and 100 events per well. Levels of PAI-1 and
tPA were presented as mean ± standard deviations in the text. Active PAI-1 was detected by the
same method but using the human uPA protease coupled to the beads as capture23.
Spontaneous lysis assay. To determine the rate of spontaneous lysis, 40 µL of diluted plasma
(1:1 in TBS) was added to a microtiter plate and pre-read at 405 nm. Then, 40 µL of 25 nM
alpha human thrombin (Haemtech) and 15 mM CaCl2 was added and incubated at 37°C for 30
minutes, and the absorbance was read at 405 nm. Twenty µL of TBS was then added to the
plate to prevent clot drying during the extended incubation and the plate was read again after 30
minutes and then at 60-minute intervals up to 8 hours.

Quantification of S100A8/A9 (calprotectin). Calprotectin levels were measured with the
Human S100A8/S100A9 Heterodimer DuoSet ELISA (DY8226-05, R&D Systems) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistical analysis. When two groups were present, normally-distributed data were analyzed
by two-sided t test and skewed data were analyzed by Mann-Whitney test or Wilcoxon test. For
three or more groups, analysis was by one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test with correction
for multiple comparisons. Normality was assessed by Shapiro-Wilk test. Correlations were
tested by Spearman’s method. Data analysis was with GraphPad Prism software version 8.
Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05.

RESULTS
Tissue-type plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in COVID-19.
Utilizing established Luminex platforms, we measured total PAI-1 and tPA levels (detecting both
free and complexed PAI-1 and tPA, respectively) in the plasma of 118 patients hospitalized with
COVID-19. We similarly assessed 30 healthy controls whose samples had been banked prior to
December 2019. Of the 118 COVID-19 patients, the mean age was 61 with a standard deviation
of 17 (range 25-95); 54 were female (46%) (Table 1). In our cohort, 42% of patients were
supported by mechanical ventilation, 8% were receiving high-flow oxygen, 27% were supported
by standard nasal cannula, and 24% were breathing ambient air at the time of sample
collection. Markedly elevated levels of both PAI-1 and tPA were detected in patients with
COVID-19 as compared with healthy controls (mean ± standard deviation 75 ± 46 vs. 40 ± 42
ng/mL, p<0.0001; and 78 ± 68 vs 2.4 ± 2.6 ng/mL, p<0.0001, respectively Figure 1A-B). There
was a significant correlation between levels of PAI-1 and tPA among COVID-19 patients
(r=0.52, p<0.0001) (Figure 1C). In summary, both PAI-1 and tPA are markedly elevated in the
plasma of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
Plasma level of tPA and PAI-1 and their association with clinical biomarkers. We
assessed potential correlations with D-dimer and platelet count. We limited the analysis of
clinical laboratory measurements to those performed on the same day as plasma used for the
PAI-1 and tPA assays. No significant correlation was found between D-dimer and either PAI-1
(r=0.23, p=0.11) or tPA (r=-0.01, p=0.94) (Figure 2A-B). We did observe a strong correlation
between PAI-1 and platelet count (r=0.33, p=0.0003) (Figure 2C); the same was not true for
tPA (r=0.06, p=0.5) (Figure 2D). Given that activated neutrophils and their products can exert
anti-fibrinolytic effects24, we next asked how absolute neutrophil count and calprotectin (a
marker of neutrophil activation) compared to tPA and PAI-1. Both PAI-1 and tPA demonstrated
strong positive correlations with same-day absolute neutrophil count (r=0.32, p=0.03 and
r=0.23, p=0.03) (Figure 2E-F), as well as levels of calprotectin (r=0.42, p<0.0001 and r=0.23,
p=0.01) (Figure 2G-H). In summary, levels of PAI-1 and tPA demonstrated strong correlations
with neutrophil numbers and activation.
Levels of PAI-1 and tPA associate with severe disease and worse outcomes. Compared
with patients breathing room air, patients requiring oxygen had significantly higher levels of PAI1 (p=0.02) (Figure 3A), but not tPA or D-dimer (Figure 3B-C). Beyond mode of respiratory
support, oxygenation efficiency can also be measured by comparing pulse oximetry (SpO2) to

the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). We tested the correlation between PAI-1, D-dimer and
SpO2/FiO2 ratio and found a strong negative association (r=-0.35, p=0.0002 for PAI-1; r=-0.37,
p=0.009 for D-dimer;) (Figure 3D and F). A negative association was also appreciated between
oxygenation efficiency and tPA (r=-0.19, p=0.04), albeit less robust than for PAI-1 and D-dimer
(Figure 3E). Among the 118 patients, 24 died, 92 were discharged, and two remained
hospitalized at the time of this analysis. Significantly higher levels of both PAI-1 (p=0.04) and
tPA (p=0.0003) were observed among patients who died as compared with those who were
discharged, with this difference being especially robust for tPA (Figure 3G-H). Surprisingly, we
did not see a significant difference in D-dimer levels between those two groups (Figure 3I). In
summary, high levels of tPA and PAI-1 were associated with worse respiratory status and poor
clinical outcomes; in particular, high levels of tPA were strongly associated with death.
High tPA COVID-19 samples have enhanced spontaneous fibrinolysis. Finally, we asked
whether COVID-19 plasma with the highest tPA levels might demonstrate enhanced
spontaneous fibrinolysis as compared with low-tPA COVID-19 plasma or control plasma. A
spontaneous fibrinolysis assay was performed on 10 COVID-19 plasma samples with high tPA
(>100 ng/mL), 10 COVID-19 samples with low tPA (<20 ng/mL), and 10 healthy control plasma
samples (mean value 2.4 ng/mL). Notably, the high-tPA COVID-19 samples significantly
enhanced spontaneous fibrinolysis as compared with low-tPA and healthy control plasma
samples (Figure 4A-B). Consistent with this observation, we found that tPA levels were on
average 2.2-fold higher than PAI-1 in the high tPA patients (Supplementary Figure 1A-B). This
was in contrast to the ratio in control plasma samples (where PAI-1 levels averaged more than
10-fold greater than tPA) or in COVID-19 patients with tPA less than 20 ng/mL (where PAI-1
levels were >2-fold greater than tPA). No significant difference in age or oxygenation efficiency
were observed in a subset of ten high tPA and ten low tPA patients (Supplementary Figure 2).
Detailed demographic and clinical characteristics of those COVID-19 patients with high and low
tPA are presented in Supplementary Table 1.

DISCUSSION
Fibrinolytic homeostasis in COVID-19 is likely complex and influenced by various factors.
Normal lung physiology has a pro-fibrinolytic tendency25. However, during acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) impaired fibrinolysis results in accumulation of fibrin that promotes
hyaline membrane formation and alveolar injury26. Fibrin is removed by plasmin. It is believed
that depressed fibrinolysis in ARDS is at least partially driven by increased circulating PAI-1 that
exerts a negative effect on the plasminogen activation system25. Indeed, elevated PAI-1 is an
independent risk factor for poor ARDS outcomes27. Elevated PAI-1 and its associated hypofibrinolytic state were observed in the 2002 SARS-CoV epidemic28, while recent
characterizations of COVID-19 patients have suggested impaired global fibrinolysis18,21.
Interestingly, in our large cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we observed elevated levels
of not only PAI-1, but also tPA. While high PAI-1 and D-dimer tracked most closely with
impaired oxygenation efficiency, tPA was the best predictor of death. A recent study of 78
hospitalized COVID-19 patients also detected elevations of both PAI-1 and tPA, particularly
among critically-ill COVID-19 patients21; however, the mechanistic role of the elevated tPA
among COVID-19 patients was not specifically investigated. Furthermore, the level of tPA we
detected in the COVID-19 patients, 78 ± 68 ng/mL, is striking and much higher than the 23.9 ±
14.5 ng/mL described in this prior report in 48 patients admitted to ICU21. Notably these levels
are even higher than is observed in trauma patients who have exaggerated fibrinolytic activity
and in patients with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, which carries high alveolar
hemorrhage risk29-31.

The major source of these high levels of tPA among COVID-19 patients is likely endothelial
cells. The source of PAI-1 could also be the endothelium or perhaps release from activated
platelets (as we found a strong correlation between PAI-1 and platelet counts). High PAI-1
expression in other cell types such as macrophages has also been reported during hantavirus
infections29. One hallmark of COVID-19 ARDS is the sequestration of leukocytes, particularly
neutrophils, in the microvasculature of the lung—contributing to alveolar injury and unrestricted
inflammation27. This local proinflammatory environment is further exaggerated by the formation
of NETs and results in massive release of proinflammatory cytokines6. Those cytokines likely
trigger endothelial cell activation and thereby promote local release of tPA and PAI-16,32.
Notably, we observed a strong correlation between tPA/PAI-1 and both absolute neutrophil
counts and circulating calprotectin, a neutrophil activation marker. In addition to endothelial

activation, it is possible that direct infection and destruction of endothelial cells by SARS-CoV-2
may also potentiate the release of tPA and PAI-111.

While the prothrombotic risk associated with COVID-19 is well recognized, the risk of bleeding
should not be ignored. One recent large multicenter study observed an overall bleeding risk of
4.8% among hospitalized COVID-19 patients and this risk increased to 7.6% among critically-ill
patients16. Elevated D-dimer was associated with both thrombotic and bleeding complications16.
It has been suggested that high PAI-1 levels overcome the effects of local tPA and produce a
net prothrombotic hypofibrinolytic state in COVID-19 patients21. However, we here found a
subset of COVID-19 patients with extremely high levels of tPA (>100ng/mL) in which fibrinolysis
seems to dominate. This may at least partially explain the enhanced bleeding risk observed in
some groups of patients with COVID-19.

Our study has some limitations. We did not have access to fresh plasma samples each day of a
patient’s hospitalization. PAI-1 and tPA levels were therefore not tested on a defined day of
hospitalization, but rather when a plasma sample became available to the research laboratory. It
should however be noted that when assessing correlations of PAI-1 and tPA with clinical
variables, same-day laboratory and clinical status data were used. Due to research restrictions
during the pandemic we were not allowed to recruit new healthy controls. Healthy controls were
recruited during the pre-COVID-19 era and we were not able to match gender and age to
COVID-19 patients. Future studies should endeavor to systematically track PAI-1 and tPA levels
over the full course of hospitalization of COVID-19 patients and to compare with gender- and
age-matched controls. We also recognize that tPA is not the sole activator of plasminogen, as
uPA also plays a role in the fibrinolysis regulation and PAI-1 can also inhibit uPA17.
Dysregulation of uPA and its receptor system have been implicated in the pathogenesis of
pulmonary fibrosis and ARDS33,34. The role of uPA and its receptor in COVID-19 warrants
further investigation.

Because the COVID-19 associated prothrombotic risk is known, prophylactic anticoagulation
has become part of standard COVID-19 treatment. High rates of thromboembolic events from
early studies prompted some experts to recommend a more intensive dose of anticoagulation
among COVID-19 patients2. We would urge caution regarding this recommendation (pending
randomized studies) as the coagulopathy of COVID-19 is complex and potentially dynamic.
Therapies aimed at promoting fibrinolysis, such as administration of aerosolized or intravenous

tPA, have been trialed in ARDS models where there have been some promising preclinical
results35,36. Profibrinolytic therapy has been suggested as a potential beneficial therapy in
COVID-19 patients suffering from ARDS27 and is currently being tested in multiple clinical trials
(https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=Covid19&term=tpa). We have now found that a
hyperfibrinolytic state exists in some COVID-19 patients. Targeted therapies that promote
fibrinolysis therefore need to be selective and cautious to minimize bleeding risk. Finally, our
data suggests that high systemic tPA may be a biomarker for poor clinical outcomes and
supports further studies of tPA levels during the course of disease progression.

Figure 1. High levels of tPA and PAI-1 among patients with COVID-19. A-B, PAI-1 and tPA
were measured in individuals with COVID-19, or healthy controls. Levels of PAI-1 and tPA were
compared by Mann-Whitney test as samples were not normally distributed when assessed by
Shapiro-Wilk test; ****p<0.0001 as compared with the control group. Dotted line indicates high
tPA cut-off. C, The relationship between tPA and PAI-1 was assessed by Spearman’s
correlation test.

Figure 3: Association between PAI-1, tPA, D-dimer and respiratory status as well as final
outcomes. A-C, COVID-19 patients were grouped by clinical status (room air vs. supplemental
oxygen) and analyzed for PAI-1, tPA, and D-dimer. Level of PAI-1, tPA, and D-dimer were not
normally distributed based on Shapiro-Wilk test. Groups were compared by Mann-Whitney test;
*p<0.05. D-F, PA1-1, tPA, and D-dimer were compared to SpO2/FiO2 ratio for each patient, and
correlations were determined by Spearman’s test. G-I, COVID-19 patients were also grouped by
final outcomes (death vs. discharge). Level of PAI-1, tPA and D-dimer were not normally
distributed based on Shapiro-Wilk test. Thus groups were compared by Mann-Whitney test;
*p<0.05, ***p<0.001.

Figure 4: Spontaneous lysis rate among COVID-19 patients with high and low tPA. The
ability of COVID-19 patients’ plasma with high (>100ng/mL) and low tPA (<20ng/mL) to promote
spontaneous lysis of an ex vivo plasma clot formed by the addition of alpha human thrombin
was evaluated. A. Lysis over time was recorded for 10 high-tPA plasma samples. B. The rate of
lysis determined from the slope of the absorbance from t0min to t480min was compared between
COVID-19 patients with high tPA, low tPA, and healthy controls by one-way ANOVA; *p<0.05.
