Abstract

23

Background: Early identification of different COVID-19 clinical presentations may depict distinct

24

pathophysiological mechanisms and guide management strategies.

25

Objective: To determine the aggressiveness of SARS-CoV-2 using symptom progression in COVID-19 patients.

26

Design: Historic cohort study of Mexican patients. Data from January-April 2020 were provided by the Health

27

Ministry.

28

Setting: Population-based. Patients registered in the Epidemiologic Surveillance System in Mexico.

29

Participants: Subjects who sought medical attention for clinical suspicion of COVID-19. All patients were

30

subjected to RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2.

31

Measurements: We measured the Period between initial symptoms and clinical progression to COVID-19 suspicion

32

(PISYCS) and compared it to the primary outcomes (mortality and pneumonia).

33

Results: 65,500 patients were included. Reported fatalities and pneumonia were 2176 (3.32%), and 11568

34

(17.66%), respectively. According to the PISYCS, patients were distributed as follows: 14.89% in <24 hours,

35

43.25% between 1-3 days, 31.87% between 4-7 days and 9.97% >7 days. The distribution for mortality and

36

pneumonia was 5.2% and 22.5% in <24 hours, 2.5% and 14% between 1-3 days, 3.6% and 19.5% between 4-7 days,

37

4.1% and 20.6% >7 days, respectively (p<0.001). Adjusted-risk of mortality was (OR [95% CI], p-value): <24

38

hours= 1.75 [1.55-1.98], p<0.001; 1-3 days= 1 (reference value); 4-7 days= 1.53 [1.37-1.70], p<0.001; >7 days=

39

1.67 [1.44-1.94], p<0.001. For pneumonia: <24 hours= 1.49 [1.39-1.58], p<0.001; 1-3 days= 1; 4-7 days= 1.48

40

[1.41-1.56], p<0.001; >7 days= 1.57 [1.46-1.69], p<0.001.

41

Limitations: Using a database fed by large numbers of people carries the risk of data inaccuracy. However, this

42

imprecision is expected to be random and data are consistent with previous studies.

43

Conclusion: The PISYCS shows a U-shaped SARS-CoV-2 aggressiveness pattern. Further studies are needed to

44

corroborate the time-related pathophysiology behind these findings.

Introduction

51

most recently discovered coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is cause

52

of the clinical entity denominated Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This virus initially spread in the Wuhan

53

province in China and later to the rest of the world, causing a pandemic [3]. Reported worldwide cases are

54

continuously growing and currently (as of July 3rd , 2020) there are over 10 million infected people confirmed and

55

over 500,000 fatalities. Global reports reveal case-fatality rate of 4.8% and more than half of the cases are in the

56

Americas region. In Mexico, over 230,000 cases have been reported, with over 28,000 fatalities and a case-fatality

57

rate of 12.3%, which by far surpasses the global estimate [4].

58

Every human in the world is susceptible to infection, for as the mean age of infected patients is 47 years, 87% of

59

patients lie between 30 and 79 years old. COVID-19 behaves more aggressively in older patients and in patients

60

undergoing chronic medical conditions such as obesity, diabetes [5,6], hypertension and other cardiovascular

61

diseases, increasing the risk of mortality in these populations [7,8]. Approximately 80% of cases are asymptomatic

62

with a mild disease course, while the other 20% can be accompanied of severe complications such as pneumonia,

63

Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and other secondary infections. Among these severe cases, 80%

64

correspond to people over 60 years. Many of these cases can be attributed to a severe clinical entity known as

65

“cytokine storm”, which causes a rise in serum levels of many pro-inflammatory mediators and provokes massive

66

tissue damage in several vital organs [7,9].

67

In patients who developed severe symptoms, dyspnea was reported between 8-12 days after onset of symptoms, and

68

some patients deteriorate into severe disease during the first week after onset of symptoms. This accelerated

69

worsening has been hypothesized to be caused by the cytokine storm and to thrombotic events that may be caused

70

by infection with SARS-CoV-2 [10].

71

Hospitalized patients have been thoroughly described and analyzed, with an average time between onset of

72

symptoms to intubation of 14.5 days, and a time from intubation to death ranging from 4-5 days [7,9,11]. A longer

73

period between onset of symptoms and first contact seeking medical attention has been associated with a poorer

74

outcome in these patients. However no in-depth studies have been conducted [12].

75

Until now, studies have been focused on patient-centered risk factors, while SARS-CoV-2 aggressiveness has been

76

established as provoking 20% of severe and critic patients [13],however, there are still many unanswered questions

Coronaviruses are single-stranded RNA organisms capable of infecting humans and other animal species [1,2]. The

77

concerning the clinical aggressiveness behavior of SARS-CoV-2. This study focuses on progression of symptoms as

78

a marker of such aggressiveness, using the Period between initial symptoms and clinical progression to COVID-19

79

suspicion (PISYCS) to determine the risk of severe disease and mortality.

80
81

Methods

82

Study Design and Data Source

83

A historic cohort study of Mexican patients that were classified as a suspect case of COVID-19 and sought medical

84

attention in either public or private health services in Mexico, was analyzed. Data was provided by the General

85

Directorate of Epidemiology of the Mexican Health Ministry, which is deidentified, publicly available online, and

86

registers all patients in the Epidemiologic Surveillance System of the 32 federal states in Mexico. This analysis was

87

done in all cases registered in this dataset up until April 25th, 2020, with a total of 65,500 patients [14]. The

88

Institutional Review Board of Anahuac University (Mexico City, Mexico) approved this study (Protocol approval

89

#202044).

90
91

Variable Definition

92

Our dataset includes demographic characteristics such as age, gender, location, health sector, underlying medical

93

conditions (obesity, diabetes, COPD, asthma, immunosuppression, hypertension, cardiovascular, chronic kidney

94

diseases, and other comorbid diseases), pregnancy status, tobacco use, and indigenous language speaker.

95

Furthermore, it references the dates of the onset of symptoms and the date of medical attention, including hospital

96

admission, as well as the presence of pneumonia. Regarding in-hospital decisions, data include results of RT-PCR

97

testing for SARS-CoV-2 (reported as positive, negative or pending), admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and

98

requirement of mechanical ventilation. Finally, the date of death of all deceased patients is reported.

99
100

Data Analysis: Coding and substitution of variables

101

The state where the patient sought attention was recoded according to the socio-economic level of that particular

102

state into low, middle and high level, based on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of that state, as reported by the

4

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.28.20221697; this version posted November 15, 2020. The copyright holder for this

103

National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) [15]. The health sector variable was recoded in three

104

categories: private, with social security and without social security.

105

COVID-19 clinical suspicion was defined by the government health ministry´s official guidelines, as presenting with

106

two of these symptoms: 1) cough, 2) fever or 3) headache, plus one or more of the following: 1) breathing difficulty,

107

2) sore or burning throat, 3) runny nose, 4) red eyes, 5) pain in muscles or joints, or 6) being part of these high-risk

108

groups: pregnancy, <5 or ≥60 years old, or having a chronic disease such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cancer

109

or HIV.

110

These indications were broadcast on television, radio, newspaper and internet platforms since the beginning of the

111

pandemic until July 1, 2020. Due to nationwide government issued stay-at-home orders, we assumed that medical

112

attention was sought only when these criteria were met.

113

Upon medical evaluation, patients were asked to report the date of onset of initial symptoms (any combination of

114

clinical features that appeared before meeting the previously mentioned criteria). Therefore, the Period between

115

initial symptoms and clinical progression to COVID-19 suspicion (PISYCS) was established as the number of days

116

between appearance of initial symptoms and the date in which the patients sought medical attention.

117

PISYCS

118

Initially, PISYCS was categorized in days (<1, 1, 2, 3, etc.), but to improve comprehension and data management,

119

adjacent days whose frequency of death remained in similar proportions, were grouped into 4 categories (<24 hours,

120

1-3 days, 4-7 days and >7 days). The primary outcomes were mortality and pneumonia. The presence of pneumonia

121

was used as an indicator of severe disease as reported in previous studies [7,9].

122

Missing data were substituted using the mode for the following categorical variables: Health Sector (338 patients,

123

0.5%), indigenous language speaker (1241, 2%), tobacco use (242, 0.4%), pregnancy status (166, 0.3%), diabetes

124

(255, 0.4%), COPD (245, 0.4%), asthma (251, 0.4%), immunosuppression (259, 0.4%), hypertension (241, 0.4%),

125

cardiovascular disease (252, 0.4%), obesity (220, 0.3%), chronic kidney disease (245, 0.4%), other comorbid

126

condition (331, 0.5%), admission to the ICU (12, <0.01%) and mechanical ventilation (12, <0.01%).

127
128

Statistical Analysis

129

Demographic features and comorbid conditions were initially compared between the four categories of PISYCS; age

130

was analyzed with a one-way ANOVA and the rest of the variables with Chi squared test analysis. Afterwards, we

5

131

performed a bivariate analysis comparing the four categories of PISYCS with the medical decisions made (result of

132

PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2, hospital admission, ICU, mechanical ventilation) and outcomes (mortality and

133

pneumonia) using the Chi squared test.

134

Finally, the four categories of PISYCS against primary outcomes -mortality and pneumonia-, were compared using a

135

multivariable logistic regression model. The model was adjusted in five steps for the following variables: age,

136

gender, indigenous language speaker, state’s socioeconomic status, pregnancy, tobacco use, obesity, hypertension,

137

diabetes, asthma, COPD, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, immunosuppression, other comorbid

138

conditions. This model was repeated in four groups of patients within the sample, depending on their RT-PCR

139

testing result for SARS-CoV-2:

140

a.

All patients: Every patient in the dataset regardless of their test result

141

b.

Positives: Only patients with a positive test result

142

c.

Negatives: Only patients with a negative test result

143

d.

Pending: Only patients with pending results of the test

144

The PISYCS used as reference in the regression models, was 1-3 days based in the lower rate of mortality, observed

145

in the results of the bivariate analysis. Each logistic regression model is presented with the Odds Ratio (OR) and its

146

respective 95% Confidence Interval (CI95%). Statistical significance was set at p<0.05 and performed with SPSS

147

version 25.0 (IBM). The full model for the group of all patients can be found in the Supporting Information Section.

148
149

Results

150

The study population included 65,500 patients. Among them, the average age was 41±17 years, 50.2%, were

151

women, 55.8% belonged to a high socioeconomic level, 27.7% to a medium and 16.5% to a low one, 4.6% of

152

patients were treated on a private health institution, 37.7% in a facility for patients with social security and 57.7%

153

attended to a public hospital for patients without social security. Of all the patients, 41% had at least one

154

comorbidity, hypertension being the most frequent in 17%, followed by obesity in 15.6% and diabetes 12.8%. In

155

addition, 9.9% reported tobacco use and 2.3% of women were pregnant. Mortality was observed in 2176 patients

156

(3.32%), and Pneumonia in 11568 patients (17.66%).

Value

157

According to PISYCS patients were distributed as follows: 14.89% in <24 hours, 43.25% between 1-3 days, 31.87%

158

between 4-7 days and 9.97% after 7 days, with no significant difference by gender. We compared PISYCS against

159

demographic features and comorbidities. A PISYCS of <24 hours was more frequent in older patients (25.7% in

160

patients > 80 years old vs. 15% in <30 years old) reversing in the period of 1-3 days (41.5% vs 48.4 %,

161

respectively), and returning to the initial behavior in subsequent periods. This same pattern was observed when

162

comparing PISYCS with the presence of all comorbidities, except for asthma and obesity. Demographic

Discussion

208

In this study, we found an association concerning the Period between initial symptoms and clinical progression to

209

COVID-19 suspicion (PISYCS) with the risk of severe disease and mortality in patients with suspected COVID-19.

210

A “U shaped” distribution was observed, with a high risk of death and pneumonia when PISYCS is <24 hours (OR

211

1.75, and 1.49, respectively), with a decrease of this risk in 1-3 days (OR 1), and with an additional rise in

212

subsequent periods of 4-7 days (OR 1.53, and 1.48) and >7 days (OR 1.67 and 1.57).

213

The increased risk of mortality and pneumonia observed in patients with PISYCS <24 hours, may be associated with

214

the presence of a cytokine storm, which has been previously described as an early factor for severity[16]. This

215

phenomenon is due to the uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory mediators that lead to apoptosis of epithelial and

216

endothelial lung cells, causing vascular extravasation, alveolar edema and hypoxia [17]This inflammatory response

217

in conjunction with the production of reactive oxygen species triggers an acute respiratory distress syndrome

218

(ARDS) leading to pulmonary fibrosis and death[18]. This could support the pharmacodynamic basis for the use of

219

corticosteroids as adjuvant therapy in patients with COVID-19, which has been reported in other studies [19].

220

Chronic use of inhaled corticosteroids may be the reason why asthmatic patients manifest less severe symptoms[20],

221

which was consistent with our results (See S1-S2 Tables).

222

The increased risk of mortality and pneumonia in patients with PISYCS ≥4 days, could be explained by the

223

thrombotic events that have been reported in patients with COVID-19. These events are caused by the excessive

224

inflammation produced by the virus and platelet activation with accompanying endothelial damage[21,22]. This

225

occurs once the virus has colonized the respiratory system, impairing microvascular permeability, helping it spread

226

even further. Hemostatic disorders are established by the presence of thrombocytopenia, and an increase in the D-

227

dimer and fibrinogen, for which the use of antithrombotic therapies has been suggested[21,23].

228

Additionally, an increased risk of lung superinfections must be considered. So far, bacterial and fungal pneumonias

229

have been the most common etiologies. A study conducted in Wuhan, China reported a rate of lung superinfection

230

from 5-27% in adults with COVID-19 [24]. Historically, superinfections have been associated with increased

231

mortality in other viral respiratory infections, such as influenza [25].

232

Our findings may have further clinical implications if the pathophysiological processes were to be confirmed. The

233

PISYCS could be useful as a prognostic marker and a decision-making tool for clinicians. Identifying individuals at

234

higher risk of developing early-onset complications (with a PISYCS <24 hours) could justify a more aggressive

235

treatment plan and monitorization strategies, focused on preventing complications of cytokine storm and ARDS.

236

Additionally, patients with a higher risk of late-onset complications (with a PISYCS ≥4 days) could be identified

237

and treated accordingly, justifying the use of thromboprophylaxis, preventing superinfections.

238

The PISYCS could also prove useful as a research categorization parameter for clinical studies exploring timing and

239

efficacy of therapeutics. Immunomodulatory agents (such as IL-6 antagonists) and corticosteroids may only prove

240

beneficial for patients with a PISYCS of < 24 hours and may further increase the risk of late-onset complications

241

(superinfections) if used in a later PISYCS category [24].

242
243

Using a database fed by large numbers of people carries its risk, such as data inaccuracy. However, this imprecision

244

is expected to be random and data are consistent with results of previous studies. Furthermore, we set April 25th,

245

2020 as our cut-off date with the aim of including patients treated at an early stage of the pandemic in Mexico, at a

246

time when hospitals were not yet working at overcapacity. This increases the probability of good quality of

247

healthcare, decreases confounding factors for the outcomes evaluated because all required medical decisions could

248

be made and were not limited by medical resources available at the time (i.e. number of ventilators or ICU beds).

249

Plenty of studies have described the incubation period and hospital stay of affected patients[7,26,27]. However,

250

nobody has considered the progression of symptoms in patients with COVID-19 (PISYCS), as a guide for

251

explaining the time-specific pathophysiology associated with the U-Shaped SARS-CoV-2 aggressiveness. Further

252

studies are needed to corroborate the time-related pathophysiology behind these findings. Eventually, this could help

253

identify specific therapies aimed towards the temporal progression of the disease.
