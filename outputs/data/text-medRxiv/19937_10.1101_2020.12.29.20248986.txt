Abstract
Due to non-availability of specific therapeutics against COVID-19, repurposing of approved drugs is a reasonable
option. Cytokines imbalance in COVID-19 resembles cancer; exploration of anti-inflammatory agents, might reduce
COVID-19 mortality. The current study investigates the effect of ruxolitinib treatment in SARS-CoV-2 infected
alveolar cells compared to the uninfected one from the GSE5147507 dataset. The protein-protein interaction
network, biological process and functional enrichment of differentially expressed genes were studied using STRING
App of the Cytoscape software and R programming tools. The present study indicated that ruxolitinib treatment
elicited similar response equivalent to that of SARS-CoV-2 uninfected situation by inducing defense response in
host against virus infection by RLR and NOD like receptor pathways. Further, the effect of ruxolitinib in SARSCoV-2 infection was mainly caused by significant suppression of IFIH1, IRF7 and MX1 genes as well as inhibition
of DDX58/IFIH1-mediated induction of interferon- I and -II signalling.

Introduction
The SARS-CoV-2 infection induced hyperinflammatory state is a general manifestation in severe and
critical COVID-19 leading to significant morbidity and mortality worldwide (Yeleswaram et al.
2020). There is an intense need of repurposing the approved available drugs for COVID-19 treatment due
to non-availability of specific therapeutics (Mandal and Mandal, 2000). Ruxolitinib, (3R)-3-cyclopentyl3-[4-(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl] propanenitrile, an FDA approved antineoplastic
agent, is one such drug repurposable in COVID-19, that acts as Janus Kinase (JAK) 1 and
JAK2 inhibitors to suppress the release of proinflammatory cytokines IL1, IL6, IL8, IL12, TNFA, INFG,
VEGF, TGFB, FGF, PDGF, GMCSF, GCSF (Lussana and Rambaldi 2017). It is used in the treatment of
polycythemia vera, myelofibrosis of the primary, post-polycythemia vera and post-essential
thrombocythemia types as well as steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease post allogeneic stem
cell transplantation (https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2019/202192s017lbl.pdf).
Notably, JAK1 and JAK2 are important regulators of hematopoietic homeostasis and immune system
development through downstream target gene (STAT3/5, AKT, and ERK) phosphorylation, thereby
stimulating cytokines and chemokines production (Ajayi et al. 2018).
There have been reports on the effect of ruxolitinib treatment in COVID-19 patients ameliorating the
symptoms, improving the radiographic findings, blood biochemical parameters and immune cell status.
Administration of ruxolitinib in severe COVID-19 patients demonstrated improved chest CT, faster

recovery from lymphopenia, alleviation of exuberant proinflammatory cytokine (IL1, IL2, IL4, IL6, IL10,
IL12, IL13, IL17, GMCSF, GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, HGF, INFG, TNFA) (Cao et al. (2020),
Neubauer et al. (2020), Rosee et al. (2020), https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04348071) along with
mitigation of plasma ferritin concentration, soluble IL2R levels, and STAT-phosphorylation, STAT1
dependent CD8+ T cell proliferation (Zhong et al. 2020 Lancet Rheumatol), reduction of cytotoxic Tlymphocytes and increment of Treg cells (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04334044). However, the
key molecular interactions based on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in SARS-COV-2 infection
with or without ruxolitinib treatment, in repurposing the drug for COVID-19 treatment, have not been
widely explored.
Therefore, the current study is an attempt to investigate the effect of ruxolitinib treatment in SARS-CoV-2
infected alveolar cells compared to the uninfected one from the GSE5147507 dataset, emphasizing the
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, biological process and functional pathways enrichment
associated with the DEGs. To achieve this, STRING App of the Cytoscape software, version 3.7.2
(https://cytoscape.org/) was applied along with R programming (https://www.r-project.org/; version 3.6.1
[2019-07-05]) gplots and ggplot tools from the Biobase packages (https://CRAN.Rproject.org/package=gplots) of the Bioconductor project (Huber et al., 2015).
Methods
The gene expression dataset GSE5147507 was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) related to transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 infection
(Blanco-Melo et al., 2020), from where samples were selected containing independent biological
triplicates of (i) transformed lung alveolar (A549) cells transduced with a vector expressing human ACE2
mock treated (GSM4486157: Series16_A549-ACE2_Mock_1, GSM4486158:Series16_A549ACE2_Mock_2, and GSM4486159:Series16_A549-ACE2_Mock_3), (ii) ACE2 transduced A549 cells
with SARS-CoV-2 infection and without ruxolitinib treatment (GSM448616:Series16_A549ACE2_SARS-CoV-2_1,
GSM4486161:Series16_A549-ACE2_SARS-CoV-2_2,
and
GSM4486162:Series16_A549-ACE2_SARS-CoV-2_3), and (iii) ACE2 transduced A549 cells with
SARS-CoV-2 infection and ruxolitinib (500 nM) treatment (GSM4486163:Series16_A549-ACE2_SARSCoV-2_Rux_1,
GSM4486164:Series16_A549-ACE2_SARS-CoV-2_Rux_2,
GSM4486165:Series16_A549-ACE2_SARS-CoV-2_Rux_3).
The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in (i) transformed lung alveolar (A549) cells
transduced with ACE2 and infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared to the mock treated cell line, (ii) ACE2induced A549 cell line infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with ruxolitinib compared to the
ruxolitinib untreated cell line with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The threshold for DEGs were set as
|log10FoldChange| (|log10FC|)>1 and p value<0.05. The PPI network was constructed with the DEGs using
STRING App of the Cytoscape software, version 3.7.2 (https://cytoscape.org/), as per Shannon et al.
(2003). The DEGs |log10FC| were analysed at the functional level for GeneOntology (GO) and functional
pathway enrichment using the STRING Enrichment App of Cytoscape, with p value<0.05 as the cut-off
criterion.
Results and Discussion
The microarray gene expression following SARS-CoV-2 infection, from GSE5147507 dataset
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) submitted by Blanco-Melo et al. (2020), was analyzed using bioinformatics
approaches, to identify the transcriptional signatures in COVID-19 pathogenesis by gene interaction

networks, gene ontology and functional pathway enrichment analysis in SARS-CoV-2 infection with or
without ruxolitinib pre-treatment compared to that without infection. A total of 21797 genes were
obtained in the microarray expression from ACE2 induced transformed alveolar cell lines comprising
triplicate samples, each of mock treated (without SARS-CoV-2 infection and ruxolitinib treatment),
SARS-CoV-2 infected, and SARS-CoV-2 infected treated with ruxolitinib.
Analysis of the DEGs between the mock treated and SARS-CoV-2 infected cell line yielded 107
upregulated and 139 downregulated genes (log10FC>1), while the SARS-CoV-2 infected cell line having
ruxolitinib treatment expressed significantly enriched downregulated genes (log10FC>1) (n=44) only
compared to the infected but untreated cell line. The SARS-CoV-2 infected cells treated with ruxolitinib
demonstrated similar gene expression as found in the uninfected cell line, while the SARS-CoV-2
infected cells overexpressed the genes related to the defense response in host to virus infection in the
order: IFIT1>IFIT3>IFI6>SAMD9>MX1>OASL>HERC5>IFIH1>ISG15>OAS2>NLRC5, in terms of
microarray signal intensities averaged over samples (range 942-9716) (Figure 1a), implying that
ruxolitinib showed plausible potentiality of ameliorating COVID-19 condition. Ruxolitinib treatment
elicited downregulated DEG response amongst which the key candidate genes were UBA7 with highest
log10FC value -1.72, and IFIH1, IRF7 and MX1 with maximum degree connectivity of 27 (Figure 1b).
The UBA7 (Ubiquitin Like Modifier Activating Enzyme 7) is a ubiquitin-protein
transferase and ubiquitin activating enzyme involved in MHC-I mediated antigen processing, presentation
and innate immune system related to acute promyelocyte leukemia and lung cancer (GeneCards, 2020).
The downregulated DEG possessing highest log10FC (-1.34242) was SLC1A2 (Solute Carrier Family 1
Member 2), and the highest degree connectivity bearing DEGs: IRF7 (n=25), IFIH1 (n=23) and MX1
(n=22) were upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected cell line compared to uninfected one (Figure 1c). The
IFIH1, IRF7 and MX1 were vital players in distinguishing the effect of ruxolitinib treatment in SARSCoV-2 infection compared to ruxolitinib untreated but SARS-CoV-2 infected cell, which were suppressed
in the former and enhanced in the latter (Figure 1b and 1c). The IFIH1 (Interferon Induced with Helicase
C Domain 1), a cytoplasmic sensor of viral nucleic acids, associates with mitochondria antiviral signaling
protein (MAVS/IPS1) to induce IKK-related kinases: TBK1 and IKBKE, to phosphorylate interferon
regulatory factors IRF3 and IRF7 for the activation of antiviral responses including RIG-I/MDA5
mediated type I interferon signaling and proinflammatory cytokines (GeneCards, 2020). The MX1 (MX
Dynamin Like GTPase 1) is also induced in type I and type II interferon antiviral responses to inhibit
RNA viral replication (GeneCards, 2020). The SARS-CoV-2 infection stimulated antiviral mechanism by
DDX58/IFIH1-mediated interferon α/β-signaling involving EGR1, OASL, SOCS1, MX2, OAS2, XAF1,
IFIT1, IFIT3, IFIT2, IFNB1, RSAD2, IRF7, MX1, IFITM1, IFNA5 genes, amongst which the major
candidate gene upregulated was IFNB1 with highest log10FC 2.32, and degree connectivity 21 (Figure
1c).
The Ruxolitinib treatment caused significant inhibition of reactome pathways: DDX58/IFIH1-mediated
induction of interferon -I and -II signaling combined with ISG and OAS mediated antiviral response
involving HERC5, UBA7, MX1, IFITM1, OAS2, IFITM3, IFIT1, GBP1, XAF1, GBP4, MX2, IFI27,
OASL, TRIM22, IFIT3, RSAD2, IFI6, IRF7, NLRC5, SAA1, GBP4 and GBP1 genes (FDR ranged from
2.28E-24 to 0.0062 in reactome pathways) (Table 1). The most significant underexpressed GO process
enriched in SARS-CoV-2 infected cell line with or without ruxolitinib treatment included defense
response to virus (FDR 7.21E-21) among a wide array of processes (Figure 2a and Table 1). Conversely,
the SARS-CoV-2 infection caused significant upregulation of similar signaling pathways and antiviral
mechanism due to the action of EGR1, OASL, SOCS1, MX2, OAS2, XAF1, IFIT1, IFIT3, IFIT2, IFNB1,

RSAD2, IRF7, MX1, IFITM1, IFNA5, NFKBIA, TNFAIP3 (major reactome pathways FDR ranged from
1.34E-17 to 0.0403) (Table 2). The important DEGs related to the GO process in cell line with or without
SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 2b) were upregulated type I interferon signaling pathway (FDR 4.51E-15,
log10FC>1) (Table 2) and downregulated homophilic cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion
molecules (FDR 0.0299) (Table 3). The SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell line displayed significant
inhibition of pathways related to cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics, in
addition to glutathione, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, and chemical carcinogenesis (major KEGG
pathways FDR ranged from 0.0175 to 0.0402) involving GSTA1, UGT2B15, GSTM4, UGT2B11,
EPHX1, G6PD and ALDH3A2 genes (Figure 2c and Table 3).
Host display innate immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection primarily by IFN pathway (Table 2). The host
PRRs (pattern recognition receptors) respond to the viral PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular
patterns) by eliciting RLR (RIG-I-like receptors) signaling pathway (RIG-I/DDX58, MDA5/IFIH1,
NLRX1, MAVS), NOD (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain)-like signaling pathway (NLRP3,
PYCARD, CASP1), and TLR (Toll -like receptors) signaling pathway (TLR3-mediated expression of
TRIF and TRAF3; TLR7-mediated expression of MyD88 and IRAK) (Figure 2c and Figure 3).
Subsequent induction of downstream signaling molecules such as TBK1, IKK, NFĸB and IRF result in
IFN production. Activation of TYK2 and JAK1 cause STAT1/2 and IRF9 mediated stimulation of ISRE
(interferon-stimulated response element)-containing promoter activating the ISGs (interferon-stimulated
genes) including MxA, OAS and IFITM that cause degradation of viral RNAs and inhibit coronavirus
entry (Figure 3).
Overall, together the Type-I/III interferon production and the resultant signaling are vital in regulating
early SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 evade host innate immune response by expressing several
IFN antagonists (Yuen et al. 2020). According to the current investigation with GSE147507 dataset,
ruxolitinib treatment exhibited beneficiary function by dysregulating IFN antagonists achieving the
normal cellular function and suppression of viral pathogenesis. Inhibition of IFN antagonists nsp13
(upregulation of DDX5, down regulation of RNGTT), nsp14 (decrease of RNMT), nsp15
(downregulation), nsp3 (inhibition of UBE2N mediated DUB activity) were detected. In addition, other
IFN antagonists include orf3b, orf6, M, N, nsp1, nsp7 and nsp16 causing suppression of interferon
production and signaling (Yuen et al. 2020). In context to the safety concerns, ruxolitinib was mostly
well tolerated with some reports of toxicity including myelosuppression resulting in dose-limiting
thrombocytopenia and anemia, and viral reactivations (Ajayi et al. 2018). Further, the CYP3A4-mediated
ruxolitinib metabolism is required to be monitored mainly when co-administration with strong CYP3A4
inhibitors (Ajayi et al. 2018). However, no direct correlation between viral load and ruxolitinib treatment
was found considering that the interval between the appearance of COVID-19 symptoms and the
commencement of ruxolitinib treatment was a median of 9 days possibly when viral load subsided with
beginning of hyperinflammation damage (Pan et al. 2020).
The expression of genes related to severe COVID-19 features including lymphopenia, higher
concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, pyroptosis and ARDS, were reversed with ruxolitinib
treatment, as found in the present study (Table 4). The aberrant immune activation as an antiviral
response leading to overproduction of cytokines were substantially reduced as evident from the
suppression of genes related to interferon I signalling as well as anti-viral and proinflammatory ISGs.
Although reversed, there was not enough evidence of significant gene expression achieving the normal

circulating levels of monocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils suppressed due to SARS-CoV-2 infection
(Table 4).
Conclusion
The present study indicated that ruxolitinib treatment elicited similar response equivalent to that of
SARS-CoV-2 uninfected situation by causing stimulation of defense response in host against virus
infection by RLR and NOD like receptor signaling pathways. Further, the effect of ruxolitinib in SARSCoV-2 infection was mainly caused by significant suppression of IFIH1, IRF7 and MX1 genes as well as
inhibition of DDX58/IFIH1-mediated induction of interferon- I and -II signaling combined with ISG and
OAS mediated antiviral response. It is expected that an exploration into the mechanism of agents
possessing any possibility of reducing COVID-19 related cytokine storm will contribute to the scientific
understanding of this complex disease, and might serve as a treatment option in life threatening conditions
like respiratory insufficiency caused by COVID-19 associated ARDS, or to find avenues for the
improvement of patient outcome in COVID-19 in whom respiratory symptoms are deteriorating
nonetheless with still reversible lung impairment.
