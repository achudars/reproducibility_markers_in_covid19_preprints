The risk of severe COVID-19: hospital and ICU admission rates in Norway.
Abstract
Background: Epidemiological studies of COVID-19 with population based information may
add to the knowledge needed to prioritise resources and advice on how restrictive measures
should be targeted. This study provides admission rates to hospitals and intensive care units
(ICU) in Norway, aiming to better understand the risk of severe COVID-19 infection.
Methods: Data from official reports from The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH)
and the Norwegian Directorate of Health were used to calculate admission rates to hospitals
and to ICU per 100 000 inhabitants. We compared rates of hospitalisation between the four
health regions and provide separate rates for Oslo. We also assessed national admissions to
ICU stratified by age.
Results: The admission rate in the south-eastern region was 3.1 per 100 000, and the rate for
Oslo was 5.8. Compared to the western region (reference), the Oslo rate was 4.0 times
(confidence interval (CI) 3.0-5.5) higher. In Norway as a whole, the rate of ICU admissions
was 3.9 per 100 000, and in the age groups 60-69 and 70-79, ICU rates were 10.3 and 11.5,
respectively. These rates were 9.5 (CI 6.3-14.3) and 10.6 (CI 6.9-16.2) times higher compared
to people younger than 50 years.
Conclusion: Hospital admissions due to Covid-19 are much higher in Oslo than anywhere else
in Norway, and in the country as a whole, ICU admissions are highest among people 60-79
years of age. These results and more detailed data could provide better advice on how
restrictions can be safely lessened.

The risk of severe COVID-19: hospital and ICU admission rates in Norway.
Introduction
The general knowledge about COVID-19 has gone from almost nil to being relatively high in
a few months. Nonetheless, more extensive knowledge is needed to diagnose and treat the
infection correctly. Much knowledge is based on prediction models that include information
from different countries. So far, risk factors for Covid-19 in other countries seem to apply
also in Norway. Still, we need epidemiological descriptions of the COVID-19 outbreak on a
national level. This could be useful in deciding who precisely should be protected from the
virus, how to prioritise the use of resources, and which restrictive measures are particularly
useful to prevent spreading of the virus. Thus, population based information may teach us that
certain parts of society can manage with less harsh restrictions than others, and that improved
targeting of measures may reduce the negative socio-economic impact.
As of April 27th, 2020, there were 3,043,800 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the world, and
214,489 deaths.(1) The complete death toll will not be clear for a long time. Limited test
capacity obscures the true incidence of infected cases, because large scale representative
testing is typically not performed. Data from China suggest that one in five COVID-19
patients has very mild symptoms, and these patients would not be subjected to testing in most
countries.(2) In Norway, only symptomatic cases are tested, and yet 95-99 % are test
negative, indicating that the prevalence of COVID-19 is low compared to other airway
infections.(3) Nevertheless, undetected asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 may infect others,
who might develop severe disease.(4) Whereas the number of confirmed cases does not
reliably reflect its incidence, hospital admissions and mortality rates of COVID-19 are good
indicators of severe COVID-19 in Norway.
Patients with COVID-19 may be divided into four categories: patients with mild symptoms
who are isolated at home; patients with more severe symptoms who are admitted to a local
care facility; patients with severe symptoms who are hospitalized; or patients with severe
symptoms who require intensive care. The three latter categories are at elevated risk of severe
illness and death.
Here we report the rate of admissions to hospitals in the four health regions of Norway as of
April 27th. We also report admission rates for the population of Oslo, the capital of Norway.

In addition, we report cumulative admission rates to intensive care units (ICU) in Norway
from the first confirmed case (February 26th) until April 27th and compare the need for
intensive care between different age groups.
Methods
The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) and the Norwegian Directorate of Health
(Hdir) publish daily reports related to COVID-19 in Norway.(5, 6) For Intensive Care Units
(ICU), the admission rates are cumulative, as consecutively recorded in the national registry
of ICU patients. All data was part of public reports, thus no ethical approval was necessary.
We studied rates of admission to ICU for the whole country and stratified the admissions
according to age groups in the population.
In contrast to the cumulative ICU data, the total number of patients admitted to hospital
because of COVID-19 is not cumulatively presented in the daily reports from the health
authorities. Therefore, we used data from the most recent report (April 27th 2020) in the
analyses of hospital admissions. However, by following the daily reports of admissions prior
to that date, we could also analyze daily admission rates over time, and present them
graphically.
We calculated admission rates due to COVID-19 per 100 000 inhabitants, applying the most
recent population numbers, including age distribution, provided by Statistics Norway as of
January 1st 2020. These admission rates reflect the incidence of severe COVID-19 infection.
We compared the rates between the four health regions in Norway; the south-eastern region,
the western region, the region of the middle part of the country, and the northern region. Oslo,
the capital of Norway, belongs to the south-eastern health region, but we also present separate
admission rates for Oslo. In the comparisons, we used the admission rate of the western
region as the reference, and present rate ratios of admissions between regions with 95%
confidence intervals. The statistical analyses were conducted with the statistical program R
version 3.6.3.
Results
Table 1 shows that on April 27th, 94 COVID-19 patients were admitted to hospitals in health
region South-East, yielding a rate of 3.10 per 100 000. The separate rate for Oslo was 5.77,
which is 86% higher compared to the rest of that health region. And compared to the western

health region, the admission rate in Oslo was 4.03 (confidence interval (CI) 2.96 â€“ 5.49) times
higher.
Figure 1 illustrates how the rate ratios of hospital admissions across health regions have
developed over time. Compared to the rates in the western region, the rate ratios on April 5th
(2.50, 0.96, 1.05, and 4.01, for the south-western region (excluding Oslo), middle of Norway,
northern Norway and Oslo, respectively) were roughly similar to the rate ratios on April 27th
(2.17, 0.67, 1.15 and 4.03). The figure also shows that the number of COVID-19 patients
admitted to hospital has decreased during this time period.
Table 2 includes all COVID-19 patients who were consecutively admitted to intensive care
units (ICU) in the country. The total rate is 3.93 per 100 000, but in the 60-69 year age group,
the rate of admission is 10.29 per 100 000, and among people 70-79 years of age, the
corresponding rate is 11.47. Using the rate of ICU admission among people younger than 50
years as the reference, we found that the admission rate in the 60-69 year age group was 9.50
(CI 6.31 â€“ 14.31) higher, and correspondingly,10.59 (CI 6.92 â€“ 16.20) times higher among
those 70-79 years of age. Compared to the reference, the rate of admission to ICU was 5.20
(CI 2.76 â€“ 9.78) higher among people 80 years or older.
Discussion
As of April 27th, the likelihood for hospitalisation due to COVID-19 was four times higher in
Oslo compared to the western health region of Norway. The admission rate for the other
health regions was also substantially lower than in Oslo. In the country as a whole, the
likelihood of needing ICU treatment was about ten times higher for people between 60 to79
years of age compared to people below the age of 50 years. The rate of ICU treatment rises
sharply after the age of 50, and for those between 50-59 the risk is almost 7 times higher
compared to those below 50. For people 80 years or older, the corresponding rate is 5 times
higher, most likely reflecting that elderly patients are less likely to be treated in intensive cure
units, but more likely to be treated locally (mean age of death from COVID-19 in Norway is
82 years of age).(7) Our most important finding is that Oslo has a much higher rate of
hospitalised COVID-19 cases compared to the rest of the country.
We used data that are available from daily reports published by national health authorities.
Optimally, complementary information on age, gender, comorbidity and place of residence

should also be available, but is missing from those reports. It is difficult to see that more
complete information would have interfered with laws of privacy or the duty of
confidentiality. Thus, the authoritiesÂ´ unwillingness to share information with the public is a
limitation of this study. Nonetheless, we are not aware of comparable epidemiological studies
on hospital and ICU admission rates due to COVID-19. Many international studies are based
on prediction models and rely on assumptions that might not be readily applicable to Norway.
The number of admitted patients has now shown a consistent decrease, and the death rate has
flattened out, and therefore, it has been argued that the situation in Norway is under control.
However, our findings suggest that the situation in Oslo deviates strongly from the rest of the
country, and that the capital requires special attention.
As the society is opening up â€“ schools have started to re-open and social distancing
restrictions are lessened â€“ the situation in Oslo needs to be monitored very carefully. Oslo is
the obvious epi-center of the epidemic in Norway, from where new waves of infection are
likely to arise. Therefore, targeted testing and contact tracing should be prioritized in Oslo,
whereas in other regions, with modest transmission of SARS-CoV2, strategic testing of health
care workers or others with close contacts with individuals at increased risk, may be
sufficient. It is especially important to limit infections among people older than 60 years of
age, with particular emphasis on shielding those 80 years or older.
We would need more detailed data than what is presently available in order to provide reliable
advice that may justify further reductions of the restrictions. It is a paradox that better ways to
meet the pandemic could lie hidden in these undisclosed data. Apart from being the epi-center
of the COVID-19 pandemic in Norway, Oslo is also the place in the country where the
infection is likely to flare up again.
