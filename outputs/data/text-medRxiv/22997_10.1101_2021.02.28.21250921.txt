ABSTRACT

Background
Infections with seasonally spreading human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are common among young children
during winter months in the northern hemisphere, with immunological response lasting around a year.
However, it is not clear whether recent household exposure to HCoVs reduces the risk of SARS-CoV-2
infection.

Methods
In a nationwide cohort study we followed all adults in Denmark aged 18 to 60 years from February 27 to
November 15, 2020. Hazard ratios of SARS-CoV-2 infection by number of young children aged ten months
to five years living in the household were estimated using Cox regression adjusted for adult age, gender, and
other potential confounders. In sensitivity analyses we investigated the effect of age of children in the
household, number of children living outside of the household, and number of other adult householdmembers.

Results
Among 449,915 adults in Denmark living in households with young children, 5,761 were tested positive for
SARS-CoV-2, while among 2,629,821 adults without young children in their household, 33,788 were tested
positive for SARS-CoV-2 (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.09). Sensitivity
analyses of age of children in the household, number of children living outside of the household, and number
of additional adult household members found increasing number of children, and especially increasing
number of older children, to substantially increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Conclusions
Living in a household with young children was not associated with decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection,
thereby suggesting no strong preventive effect of recent exposure to HCoVs against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

BACKGROUND
Infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 only has limited treatment options(1–3) and immunity
against the virus is globally very limited(4). Nevertheless, it is suggested that recent exposure to seasonally
spreading human coronaviruses (HCoVs, e.g. OC43 and NL63), which is particularly prevalent among
young children during winter months(5), might result in protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection(6,7).
Furthermore, studies report serological evidence of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 binding antibodies(8) and Tcell immunity(9–11) in individuals not infected with SARS-CoV-2, thought to arise from previous HCoV
infection. However, humoral immunity against HCoVs is short-lived and immunological cross-reactivity of
HCoVs against SARS-CoV-2 may not be sterilizing(12). It is therefore unknown if, and to which degree,
recent exposure to HCoVs reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection risk or disease severity.
Taking advantage of complete individual-level data on inhabitants of all households in Denmark and
nationwide information on all laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and hospitalizations, we
explored the role of exposure to HCoVs on risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization, using living in
a household with young children as a proxy for recent HCoV exposure.

METHODS
Materials
The Danish Civil Registration System provides demographic information on the Danish population, in
addition to information on household members and number of offspring(13). Information on PCR-tests for
SARS-CoV-2 is available through MiBA, the Danish Microbiology Database, which includes all
microbiological test results from public laboratories in Denmark(14). Denmark has one of the highest SARSCoV-2 PCR testing capacities in Europe, with free tests easily accessible and offered to all inhabitants
through the public healthcare system(15). Information on all hospitalizations in Denmark is available
through the Danish National Patient Registry(16).

Study population
All adults aged 18 to 60 years living in Denmark on January 1, 2020, with known address were included in
the study cohort. In addition, we constructed a cohort of SARS-CoV-2-test-positive individuals who were
followed up for hospitalization until 30 days after positive test.
We excluded adults living in households with seven or more individuals (only 1.7 % of the population in
Denmark), to avoid inclusion of households consisting of multiple families (e.g. collective housing
communities living on the same address).

Exposure
The primary exposure was defined as living, per January 1, 2020, in a household with one or more children
aged ten months to five years. In this age span children are usually enrolled in childcare institutions and
seroconvert against seasonal coronaviruses(17–19). The exposure is therefore a proxy of recent close contact
with a child infected with HCoVs, as used previously(7). To ensure validity of a close relationship between
adult and children, only individuals who were legal parents to the child or children were included as exposed
in the primary exposure analysis. In the sensitivity analysis we examined other types of co-residence.

Study covariates
In addition to age and gender, we adjusted for urbanicity by grouping the 98 Danish municipalities into ten
groups based on population density, from most rural to most urban. Additionally, we adjusted for ethnicity,
as an earlier report found higher incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among immigrant groups in
Denmark(20). Furthermore, we adjusted for the following comorbidities: asthma, chronic pulmonary disease
(incl. COPD), cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, inflammatory bowel disease, malignancy, and renal
failure (see definition of comorbidities in Table S1).

Outcomes
The main outcome was a positive SARS-CoV-2 test from February 27 (date of first positive SARS-CoV-2
test in Denmark). As secondary outcome we investigated risk of hospitalization 30 days following a positive
SARS-CoV-2 test. See supplementary Figure S1 for overview of daily SARS-CoV-2 test positivity rate,
cases, and hospital admissions during the study period.

Statistical analysis
Hazard ratios for SARS-CoV-2 infection by household type were estimated using Cox regression with
calendar period as the underline time scale, adjusting for gender and age at entry and using a robust variance
structure to account for the correlation between members of the same household. Cohort members were
followed from February 27, 2020, to outcome of interest, death, emigration, or November 15, 2020,
whichever came first. In a secondary analysis, we investigated the 30-day hazard ratio of hospitalization
among individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by household type.
In sensitivity analyses we investigated interaction with adult age, gender, and period of testing (February 27March 26 (before lockdown), March 27-April 28 (lockdown), April 29-June 30 (early reopening), July 1November 15 (late reopening/resurgence of community transmission). Furthermore, we investigated age
span of the exposure definition, different types of households based on co-residence and legal parenthood,
and different types of households with and without co-residence of young and older children. In addition, we
estimated the effect of number of adults in the household.
To investigate whether adults living with young children were tested more compared with other adults, we
compared the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing within the latest 60 days among the
two groups using Poisson regression. All tests until the first positive test, if any, were included in the model
as outcome.

Finally, we estimated the hazard ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infection according to age and number of all
household children (age <18 years) relative to only-children aged 6 years. Each adult contributed with a
number of observations equal to their number of children. The model included a restricted cubic spline term
with 4 knots (located at the 5th, 35th, 65th, and 95th-percentile of the age distribution) for child age, a 3level variable for number of children (one, two, or three or more children) and a robust variance structure
and was adjusted for the covariates included in the previous analyses. The Bayesian Information Criterion
was used to choose between a model with an interaction term for child age and number of household
children and a model with additive effect.

RESULTS
In our cohort of 3,079,736 adults living in Denmark aged 18 to 60 years, 449,915 (14.6%) lived in
households with young children aged ten months to five years, while 2,629,821 (85.4%) lived in households
without young children (Table 1). Adults living with young children were, on average, younger (median age
35 versus 42 years), and more often female (54% versus 49%) than adults not living with young children.
For both groups, the most predominant household type consisted of two adults (86% among adults living
with young children and 49% among adults not living young children). For the group of adults in households
with young children, 76%, 23%, and 1% lived with one, two, or three or more young children, respectively.
For adults in households with any children below 18 years, 35%, 48%, and 18% lived with one, two, or three
or more children, respectively. Medical comorbidities, as defined from nationwide hospital diagnostic codes,
were more common among individuals not living in households with young children, except for
inflammatory bowel disease and renal failure.
When investigating risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults living in households with young children
compared with adults living in households without young children, we found overall an adjusted hazard ratio
of 1.05 (95% CI, 1.02 to 1.09) of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 2). When stratifying by number of young
children in the household we found an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.03 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.07), 1.13 (95% CI,

1.05 to 1.21), 1.42 (95% CI, 1.09 to 1.84), of SARS-CoV-2 infection for living in a household with one, two,
or three or more children, respectively, compared with individuals in households with no young children (P =
0.002 for trend).
Investigating the risk of SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization among SARS-CoV-2-positive adults by household
status, we found a non-significant decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization among adults living in
households with any number of young children compared with adults living without young children in the
household (adjusted hazard ratio 0.84, 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.03) (Table 3). When stratifying by number of young
children in the household we found an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.70 to 1.09) and 0.75 (95%
CI, 0.52 to 1.09) of SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization for adults living with one, or two or more children,
respectively, compared with adults in households with no young children (P = 0.47 for trend).
Further, we explored the role of adult age, gender, and time-period of testing (Table S2), and found the
relative SARS-CoV-2 infection risk to be noticeably higher among adults aged 30-39 years sharing a
household with young children (adjusted hazard ratio 1.14 (95% CI, 1.08 to 1.19)) in comparison with other
age strata, and especially high during early reopening of society following lockdown (April 29-June 30,
2020), adjusted hazard ratio of 1.26 (95% CI, 1.11 to 1.44). In addition, we found evidence of a significant,
but small, gender effect, with higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among men compared with women (P =
0.04 for interaction). Scrutinizing effects of age-span definition of young children, household definition of
children, presence of older and younger children in the household (Table S3-S6), we found strong evidence
of increased SARS-CoV-2 infection risk among adults with older children in the household, regardless of the
presence of young children in the household (adjusted hazard ratio of 1.31 (95% CI, 1.24 to 1.37)) or not
(adjusted hazard ratio of 1.31 (95% CI, 1.27 to 1.35)). In households with only young children, a clear
pattern persisted of increased risk of infection by increasing number of young children. Different definitions
of age span of young children and number of children in the household (i.e. inclusion or exclusion of nonlegal children) did not markedly alter the effect of young children on SARS-CoV-2 infection risk.
Additionally, we examined the role of number of adults in the household (Table S7). When stratifying by
number of household adults, we found a heterogeneous pattern, where in households with two adults, there

was no increased relative risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in households with young children, while we
observed an increased relative risk in households with one or three or more adults. Finally, as a last
sensitivity analysis, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 testing intensity by household type (Table S8). We found
a 9% increased testing rate in households with young children compared with households without young
children. However, adjusting for testing intensity had minimal impact on our main finding, with an adjusted
hazard ratio of 1.05 (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.09) for any young child when adjusted for tests within the latest 60
days.
To illustrate relative effects of child age, we plotted cubic splines of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk in adults
living in households with children by child age and total number of children in the household relative to
having one child aged six years (Figure 1). Overall, higher child age and higher number of children was
associated with an additive increased relative risk of infection.

DISCUSSION
In a nationwide cohort study of all adults in Denmark aged 18 to 60 years, living in households with young
children was associated with a small, but significant, increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared
with adults not living in households with young children, adjusting for potential confounders. The risk of
infection was amplified with increasing number of young children living in the household, but the overall
association was attenuated when excluding households with older children. Overall, the results suggest no
reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection risk in individuals with recent exposure to HCoVs.
Our study is, to our knowledge, the first study of household characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 infection risk
enrolling an entire population of more than three million individuals. Furthermore, the study likely captures
the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Denmark during most of the study period, as Denmark has
one of the highest PCR testing rates in Europe(15). This is reflected in the low positivity rate of SARS-CoV2 tests of 2% from late-April to the end of follow-up in mid-November 2020 (Figure S1).

Our study has some limitations. We did not have serological measurements of B-cell or T-cell immunity to
HCoVs, which could offer direct biological evidence of preexisting immunity against SARS-CoV-2
following prior exposure to HCoVs, but co-habitation with young children has been considered a reasonable
proxy for recent exposure to HCoVs previously(7). Furthermore, we did not include information on SARSCoV-2 testing of young children. However, young children are often asymptomatic or present with mild
symptoms of infection(21), thus inclusion of this information would introduce undesirable health-seeking
behavior bias into our analyses.
Our findings show that having young children in one’s household was associated with a slightly increased
risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The association could be a result of a higher number of social contacts
among adults living in households with young children (e.g. more adults in the household, contact to daycare
facilities, or close contact to parents of playmates) or due to infection brought into the household by the
young children. Nevertheless, when we stratified by number of adults in the household we found no
indication that an increased number of adults in the household was the driving force behind increased risk of
SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, we found a heterogeneous pattern according to which the lowest relative
risk of infection was in households with two adults, indicating that social circumstances, and not the
household number of adults per se, is the most important factor in determining household infection risk.
Furthermore, our analyses also show an increasing infection risk with increasing number of young children
and increased relative risk of infection during early reopening in Denmark, where daycare facilities were
among the first places to reopen, supporting that young children to some degree transmit SARS-CoV-2 in the
household. Still, compared with older children, the transmission from young children within the household is
relatively small (Figure 1). It is therefore imperative to weigh the benefits of young children attending
daycare facilities and having playdates against the relatively small risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Our findings are in line with findings from serological and epidemiological studies that suggest no sterilizing
cross-reactive immunity of recent exposure to HCoVs(5,8). As opposed to previous studies, we were also
able to investigate the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a population-setting, utilizing information on
hospital admissions of all SARS-CoV-2 positive cases. We did not find statistical significant reduced risk of

hospitalization among individuals living with young children compared with individuals living without.
Nevertheless, the analyses had limited power due to the few hospitalizations of adults with young children,
therefore, findings from other countries with similar data would be of value to explore a potential effect of
HCoVs exposure on SARS-CoV-2 infection severity.
The newly emerging B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2, was initially reported to be relatively more infectious
in individuals below 20 years of age(22), but was very rare in Denmark during the study period and cannot
explain our findings. However, given the surging spread of B.1.1.7, our study provides a framework for
future population scale studies of transmission between children and their parents of this and other SARSCoV-2 variants.
In summary, we found no evidence of a reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults living with young
children. On the contrary, we found a significant, slightly increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which,
however, was attenuated when taking account of older children in the same household. Our study thereby
suggests no protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection from recent exposure to HCoVs.
