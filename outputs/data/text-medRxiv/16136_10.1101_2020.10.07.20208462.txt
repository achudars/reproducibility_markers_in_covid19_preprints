ABSTRACT (Word Count: 229)
Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted communities differentially, with
poorer and minority populations being more adversely affected. Prior rural health
research suggests such disparities may be exacerbated during the pandemic and in
remote parts of the U.S.
Objectives: To understand the spread and impact of COVID-19 across the U.S., county
level data for confirmed cases of COVID-19 were examined by Area Deprivation Index
(ADI) scores and Metropolitan vs. Nonmetropolitan designations from the National
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). These designations were the basis for making
comparisons between Urban and Rural jurisdictions.
Methods: Kendall’s Tau-B was used to compare effect sizes between jurisdictions on
select ADI composites and well researched social determinants of health (SDH).
Spearman coefficients and a moderation analysis using Poisson modeling was used to
explore the relationship between ADI and COVID-19 prevalence in the context of county
designation.
Results: Results show that the relationship between area deprivation and COVID-19
prevalence was positive and higher for rural counties, when compared to urban ones
and that family income and poverty had a stronger relationship with prevalence than
other ADI component measures.
Conclusions: Though most Americans live in Metropolitan Areas, rural communities
were found to be associated with a stronger relationship between deprivation and
COVID-19 prevalence. Models for predicting COVID-19 prevalence by ADI and county

INTRODUCTION
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic has underscored many of the public health
disparities in the United States. Minority communities and people living in poverty
account for disproportionately more COVID-19 cases and fatalities.1,2 The same
communities may be inherently more vulnerable to infectious diseases due to
underlying health conditions and lack of access to care.3 Past health disparities
research has established a relationship between poor health outcomes and low
socioeconomic status, often taken as a ranked measure of geographic area deprivation,
or ADI.4,5 To date, few researchers have made use of ADI when evaluating COVID-19
prevalence across U.S. geographies, but early evidence seems to confirm a general
positive relationship between deprivation and prevalence exists. 6 Proper disease
management and policy efforts must understand these contrasts and public health
needs to properly combat the spread of COVID-19. 7 ADI is an important tool for this
discovery.
To date, less attention has been given to the spread of COVID-19 in rural communities,
even though recent evidence suggests a rapid spread in rural areas.8 Greater
prevalence of chronic disease and remoteness of these areas are cause for concern,
even though they make up only a fraction of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. 9,10,8 Rural
communities also tend to have worse prospects for healthcare access and outcomes. 1114

By extension, we may expect poorer outcomes for more impoverished rural

jurisdictions during the pandemic.13,14
ADI is used in this analysis as a predictor for COVID-19 prevalence that permits
contrast between diverse communities. We classified 3,142 counties across the U.S. as

“Urban” or “Rural” and stratified the relationship between prevalence and ADI
accordingly. Our hypothesis is that ADI is predictive of COVID-19 prevalence and
moderated by county type.
METHODS
Data Sources
Current estimates for COVID-19 cases were obtained from the JHU CSSE Coronavirus
tracking project.15,16 This data repository contains county level time series data for
confirmed cases dating back to January 22nd, 2020 and commonly used by population
health researchers for modeling COVID-19 spread.17,18,19 Estimates for August 20th,
2020 were used for each of the 3142 US counties for this analysis. Population by
race/ethnicity, and gender per county were based on 2019 estimates from the 2010
U.S. Census.20,21 Case prevalence was calculated as a count of confirmed cases per
100k persons in each county.
Area Deprivation Index
County level ADI is constructed from weighting 17 widely used measures in population
health literature for poverty, income, and education.4,22 The 5-year estimates of 2018
American Community Survey (ACS) data were used for calculating ADI and each of the
composite measures, using an approach as described by Singh et al. 4,21 Higher raw
ADI corresponds to more deprivation and therefore lower socioeconomic status (SES).
A low ADI national percentile rank corresponds to high raw ADI and more deprivation,
or in other words the 100th percentile rank has the most disadvantaged counties at a
national level.

Urban vs Rural Designation
The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) first developed a mechanism for
classifying rural and urbanized areas at the county level in 2001 for the accurate
assessment and measurement of health differences between residents.23,24,25 The 2013
NCHS Urbanization scheme defines Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) as at least
50,000 residents with an urban nucleus of at least 1,000 persons per square mile.
Counties that contain an urbanized core are considered central counties for the purpose
of defining the MSA. Neighboring counties with a density of at least 500 are also
included in the MSA designation. Nonmetropolitan counties (hereafter, “Rural”) are
micropolitan or noncore geographies of fewer than 50,000 residents. 2013 NCHS
definitions for metropolitan and nonmetropolitan jurisdictions were collapsed to a binary
variable reflecting Urban and Rural county type.
Statistical Tests
Descriptive characteristics for population, population density, ADI, select ADI
components, Census variables and CSSE COVID-19 case figures were tabulated
across county type. Effect sizes for each characteristic by binary county type were
estimated using Kendall’s tau (positive effect corresponds to “Urban” county type).
Additional county-level social determinants of health (SDH) variables included percent
male, percent non-Caucasian minority and percent aged 65 years or older. A subset of
SDH variables are presented in this work to reduce redundancy of ADI measures, while
illustrating resident demographics and several relevant domains of the ADI.

Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated for a subset of relevant county
characteristics, ADI variables and CSSE COVID-19 estimates and for each county type.
These included median family income, percent living under 150% of poverty percent of
households without a vehicle, and percent of households with more than one person per
bedroom.
Finally, three models using logarithmic link functions were fitted to explore a moderation
effect of county type (i.e. “Urban”, vs. “Rural”) and ADI on COVID-19 case prevalence.
A base comparison model is defined as a mapping of ADI national rank to prevalence.
The first test model fitted ADI and county type separately, and the second was the same
but with an interaction term. Inspection of coefficient sizes allowed us to interpret
whether county type had a moderating effect on ADI.
RESULTS
Characteristics of Urban vs. Rural
Table 1 reflects common SDH, including household income (in USD), percent of
families below poverty, percent of households with no vehicles and percent of
households with more than one person per room. Rural counties were found to have
significantly worse outcomes, including median family income (mean=$59,097), percent
of residents under 150% of poverty (mean=12%), and characteristically more male
(mean=50.4%), more non-Caucasian residents (mean=15.4%) and residents aged 65 or
older (mean=17.1%). No significant difference was found in percent of households with
more than one occupant per room (mean=2.5). Rural counties had significantly fewer
COVID-19 cases, cases per capita and deaths as of August 20, 2020 (mean=290.33;
1,172.4; 6.6).

Correlation between Prevalence and ADI by County Type
COVID-19 prevalence is higher in Urban counties, but less correlated to national ADI
rank when compared to Rural (ρ=.25; .46, respectively) (Figure 1). Prevalence for
Urban counties was also less strongly correlated with family income (ρ=-.17; -.32),
percent of households under 150% of poverty (ρ=.29; .39), and without a vehicle (ρ=.16;
.21) when compared to Rural counties. Similar coefficients between Urban and Rural
were found for prevalence and percent of households with more than one person per
room (ρ=.37; .33).
Modeling Prevalence by ADI and County Type
The base model for prevalence as a function of ADI yielded a significant parameter
estimate (p<.001), but only accounted for around 1.2% change in prevalence and had
rather poor overall fit (AIC=2378220). ADI with county type improved overall model
prediction by about 6.4% (AIC=2226173), largely stemming from a 35% decrease in
prevalence due to county type. The inclusion of the interaction term in the second test
model also improved model fit over base by 9.6% (AIC=2150645). The county type
parameter grew, accounting for 65% of change, while ADI within Urban and Rural
counties fell to around 1% (0.9% and 1.1%, respectively).
DISCUSSION
Although discrepancies between Urban and Rural county jurisdictions were evident in
SDH measures, no substantial moderating effect could be discerned using Poisson
regression modeling. The coefficients obtained for ADI within Urban and Rural
jurisdictions were very similar but larger for Rural jurisdictions. Each was smaller than
the coefficient obtained in the base model for ADI, revealing no moderation effect.

Model fit was also consistently poor, likely due to the high variance in COVID-19 cases
across counties. Several ADI components, however, reached levels of significance for
Spearman correlation with COVID-19 prevalence. Among these, Urban jurisdictions
tended to have lower correlation with COVID-19 prevalence than Rural ones. Together,
these results suggest that (1) the overall prevalence of COVID-19 is lower among rural
jurisdictions, and (2) the effect of socioeconomic disparity on COVID-19 prevalence is
worse for rural jurisdictions over urban ones.
These results require several qualifications. First, these results are a snapshot for an
ongoing pandemic. The relationship between ADI, its component measures and
COVID-19 prevalence are a fluid and changing phenomenon. Second, the granularity of
both the classification scheme and level of geography are less than ideal for detecting
small or more nuanced effects. We expect much greater heterogeneity in ADI
composites for densely populated regions. Zip code, census tract or block group level
data may have been more appropriate, but this information for COVID-19 testing results
is not currently available nationwide.26 Third, ADI only captures a handful of SDH that,
while useful and widely used, do not account for the very real possibility of racial
disparity in COVID-19 spread. Race, age and gender should be considered in future
modeling efforts for coronavirus prevalence. Finally, we only explored confirmed cases
of coronavirus as an outcome measure, but there is at least as much justification for
modeling case fatality. At present, little is known about the prevalence of asymptomatic
cases, so the true impact of severe COVID-19 infection differential to county type may
be even greater than what can currently be estimated.

Additional work is required to tie in known risk factors and SDH to adequately address
long-standing disparities in health outcomes and predict geographies that are most
impacted by a pandemic.27 Rural communities have notably different challenges to
access care than those in more densely populated areas.28,29,8 During a pandemic, lack
of reliable internet access and transportation may compound the effect of poverty on
telehealth services or ambulatory care. Measures of cost or healthcare utilization could
serve as proxy outcomes for severity of pandemic impact. Finally, as more data become
available on coronavirus cases, we expect finer resolution of geographic data, making it
necessary to reevaluate and confirm these findings in smaller community levels.
