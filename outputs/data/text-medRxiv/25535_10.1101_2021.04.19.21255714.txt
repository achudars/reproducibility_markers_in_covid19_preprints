Abstract
Background. The mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV2 have proven highly effective and are currently used
to vaccinate all age groups against COVID-19. Despite their high efficacy in clinical trials, there is
limited data on the impact of age, sex, and side effects on vaccine-induced immune responses.
Methods. We here studied the development of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein RBD domain antibodies
after two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty mRNA vaccine in 118 healthy volunteers and
correlated their immune response with age, sex, and side effects reported after the vaccinations.
Findings. Our findings show a robust immune response to the Spike protein’s RBD region after the
first and the second vaccination dose. However, we also saw a decline of antibody levels at 6 weeks
versus 1 week after the second dose, suggesting a waning of the immune response over time.
Regardless of this, the antibody levels at 6 weeks after the second dose remained significantly higher
than before the vaccination, after the first dose, or in COVID-19 convalescent individuals. We found a
decreased vaccination efficacy but fewer adverse events in older individuals, and that mRNA
vaccination is less efficient in older males whereas the detrimental impact of age on vaccination
outcome is abolished in females at 6 weeks after the second dose.
Interpretation. The Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty mRNA vaccine induces a strong immune response
after two doses of vaccination but older individuals develop fewer side effects and decreased
antibody levels at 6 weeks. The waning of anti-viral antibodies in particular in older male individuals
suggests that both age and male sex act as risk factors in the immune response to the SARS-CoV-2
mRNA vaccine.
Funding. The study was supported by the Centre of Excellence in Translational Genomics (EXCEGEN),
and the Estonian Research Council grant PRG377 and SYNLAB Estonia.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
The first studies addressing the immune responses in older individuals after the single-dose
administration of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines have been published. We searched PubMed and
medRxiv for publications on the immune response of SARS-CoV-2-mRNA vaccines, published in
English, using the search terms “SARS-CoV-2”, “COVID-19”, “vaccine response”, “mRNA vaccine”,
up to April 15th, 2021. To date, most mRNA vaccine response studies have not been peerreviewed, and data on the role of age, sex and side effects on SARS-CoV-2-mRNA vaccines in real
vaccination situations is limited. Some studies have found a weaker immune response in older
individuals after the first dose and these have been measured at a relatively short period (within
1-2 weeks) after the first dose but little longer-term evidence exists on the postvaccination
antibody persistence. Even less information is available on sex differences or correlations with
mRNA vaccine side effects.

Added value of this study
In this study, we assessed the antibody response up to 6 weeks after the second dose of PfizerBioNTech Comirnaty mRNA vaccine in 118 individuals. Our findings show a strong initial immune
response after the first dose and an even higher Spike RBD antibody levels at 1 week after the second
dose, but these significantly declined at 6 weeks after the second dose. We also found a weaker
immune response and faster waning of antibodies in older vaccinated individuals, which correlated
with fewer side effects at the time of vaccinations. Furthermore, although overall female and male
vaccinees responded similarly, we found that age-related waning of the vaccine-related antibodies
was stronger amongst older males whereas in females the impact of age was lost at 6 weeks after the
second dose.

Implications of all the available evidence
New mRNA vaccines are now applied worldwide as they have shown high efficacy in clinical trials.
Our results show that two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty mRNA vaccine induce a strong
antibody response to Spike RBD region but these high levels decline 1.5 months after the second
dose in most of the vaccinated individuals. Nevertheless, even at 6 weeks after the second dose, they
stay significantly higher than at prevaccination, after the first dose of vaccine, or in Covid-19
postinfection. These findings also implicate that fewer adverse effects may indicate lower antibody
response after the vaccination and point to the need for more individualized vaccination protocols, in
particular among older people.

Introduction

2

New mRNA vaccines have shown high efficacy in clinical trials and are applied worldwide to millions

3

of people. The first two-dose COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty (BNT162b2),

4

accepted for emergency use, was found safe and demonstrated 95% efficacy in phase 3 trials.

5

However, so far exists little data about the extent and duration of the antibody responses after the

6

mRNA vaccination, as well as about the factors influencing the efficacy and side effects in real

7

vaccination situations.

8

Although highly efficient in triggering immune responses in clinical trials and initial real situation

9

vaccinations, the first published studies with Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccines have reported weaker

10

immune responses and a higher number of non-responders among older people after the single1,2

11

and second dose with BNT162b2 vaccine 3,4. Nevertheless, one study failed to show a significant

12

correlation between age and antibody response after the second vaccination but found a lower

13

magnitude of memory B cell responses with increased age5, highlighting a need for further studies to

14

understand the age-related responses to mRNA vaccination. Also, limited information is available

15

about the side effects and their correlation with vaccination outcomes. For example, Goel et al5

16

found no significant association between the antibody levels and severity of adverse events among

17

vaccinees. Furthermore, the initial studies have not found sex differences in response to COVID-19

18

vaccination1,5 which has been widely described with several other vaccines6.Here we addressed the

19

dynamics of anti-S-RBD IgG vaccination response after first and second doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech

20

Comirnaty mRNA vaccine in healthy volunteers and assessed its correlation with the age, sex, and

21

severity of vaccine side effects.

Material and Methods

24

Recruitment, sample, and data collection. SYNLAB Estonia employees volunteering to be vaccinated

25

with COVID-19 mRNA Comirnaty (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine were invited to participate in the study.

26

Participants signed an informed consent form agreeing with sampling and usage of their clinical data.

27

The blood samplings were performed by trained medical personnel at SYNLAB Estonia. Samples were

28

taken before the first dose of vaccine (baseline), just before the second dose, and 3 weeks after the

29

first dose (time-point 1), 1 week after second dose (time-point 2), and 6 weeks after the second dose

30

(time-point 3). The study participants filled in a questionnaire about the presence of side-effects after

31

the second dose and rated their side-effect severity with scoring from 0 to 3 (Supplementary Table

32

1). All samples and volunteers’ data (age, sex, side effects) were stored in a pseudonymized manner.

33

As controls, we used samples from uninfected and non-vaccinated negative controls (n=50) and PCR-

34

positive mild COVID-19 (n=97) patients collected and described previously.7

35

The study has been approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Tartu on

36

February 15, 2021 (nr 335/T-21). Patients signed informed consent before recruitment into the study.

37

Antibody testing. Serum samples were analyzed for the antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein

38

receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) IgG using quantitative SARS-CoV-2 IgG QN chemiluminescent micro-

39

particle immunoassay (CLIA) on ARCHITECT i2000SR analyzer (Abbott Laboratories). The cut-off and

40

the upper detection limit of the test were 50 and 80,000 AU/mL, respectively.

41

Statistics. The t-test and Pearson correlation calculations were used for data analysis using PAST 4.05

42

software. Python's (version 3.7) sklearn principal component tool was used to differentiate between

43

younger (40 years and less) and older age groups given the scores of side effects, IgG values and sex

44

as model inputs. The boxplots were visualized using pyplot from Python's matplolib library.

45
46

Results

47

Altogether we studied 118 individuals (21 males and 97 females) who received their first and second

48

COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine doses and gave corresponding pre- and post-vaccination blood

49

samples. From these, 74 individuals were sampled at all post-vaccination time points and 90

50

completed the questionnaire on post-vaccination side effects. The age of the vaccinated volunteers

51

ranged from 21 to 68 years (median 34).

52

Antibody dynamics. Three weeks after the first vaccine dose, we found elevated S-RBD IgG levels in

53

vaccinated serum samples (Figure 1), measured by the Abbot Laboratories CLIA method, with mean

54

IgG levels of 2,079 AU/mL (range 117 – 9,164). Importantly, these S-RBD IgG levels increased

55

significantly after the second vaccination dose (at 1 and 6 weeks) as compared to the first dose

56

(p<0.0001). One week after the second dose, the serum antibody levels were boosted in participants

57

to a mean level of 26,941 AU/mL (range 3,954 - >80,000). However, we found that the S-RBD IgG

58

levels were significantly decreased to 13,971 AU/mL (2,049 – 39,789) (p<0.0001) at 6 weeks after the

59

second dose as compared with 1 week after the second dose (Figure 1). This trend of declining

60

antibody levels between 1 and 6 weeks after the second dose was present in most of the vaccinees,

61

and on average S-RBD IgG levels decreased 45% between these two time-points. In contrast, we

62

found increased S-RBD IgG levels at 6 weeks after the second dose in only 4% of individuals. One

63

individual had slightly elevated S-RBD IgG before vaccination, but negative anti-Nucleocapsid IgG and

64

anti-Spike IgM, also post-vaccination S-RBD IgG was close to average. Although COVID-19 was never

65

diagnosed in this person we could not exclude possible earlier exposure to SARS-CoV-2. We also saw

66

a greater S-RBD IgG decrease in individuals with higher IgG values a week after the second dose (ρ=

67

0.27, p=0.02) (Supplementary Figure 1).

68

We also compared the post-vaccination results with S-RBD antibodies in COVID-19 recovered

69

patients (Figure 1). The post-infection IgG levels (mean 3,932) were somewhat higher than in

70

vaccinated persons who received the first dose (p=0.01) but were significantly lower than in those

71

who received two vaccine doses (p<0.0001).

72

Factors influencing the vaccination response. The age of vaccinated individuals had a significant

73

negative correlation with S-RBD IgG response in all measured time points. This was the strongest

74

after the first dose (r= -0.45, p<0.0001), but less significant, although still detectable, at 1 week (r= -

75

0.35, p<0.001) and 6 weeks after the second dose (r= -0.29, p<0.01; Supplementary Figure 2). We

76

found a similar association while comparing the antibody levels in persons either younger or older

77

than 40 years. The individuals less than 40 years had higher antibody levels after the first dose

78

(means 2,743 vs 1,289; p=0.004), as well as 1 week (30,866 vs 22,706; p=0.066) and 6 weeks after the

79

second dose (15,963 vs 11,698; p=0.04 Supplementary Figures 3 and 4).

80

In a comparison of sex differences, we found a stronger association between age and immune

81

response among males, where the negative correlations between age and S-RBD antibodies were

82

equally strong at all measured post-vaccination time-points - r=-0.58 (after the first dose; p=0.01), r=-

83

0.59 (1 week after the second dose; p=0.01), and r=-0.58 (6 weeks after the second dose; p<0.05). In

84

females, the corresponding correlations were weaker and also declined in time r= -0.35 (p<0.001), r=-

85

0.28 (p=0.01), and r=-0.21 (ns), suggesting that age together with sex-specific factors affect the

86

vaccination outcomes of mRNA vaccines.

87

Side effects of mRNA vaccination. Vaccination side-effects merit investigation as they are common

88

reasons for vaccine hesitancy. Altogether 93% of participants reported some type of adverse effects.

89

The most common side effects were reported pain or swelling (in 84%) at the injection site, fatigue

90

(64%), malaise (50%), headache (42%), chills (41%), fever, and myalgia (both 34%). The majority of

91

the side effects were present as mild to moderate. However, 20 (22%) persons reported one or

92

several symptoms to significantly disturb his/her daily living activities, and lasting for several days

93

and/or causing absence from work. The total score of side effects (sum of all self-rated side effect

94

scores per patient) ranged between 0 and 27 (mean 7.76). The detailed data on individuals’ side

95

effects are presented in Supplementary Table 1.

96

Factors influencing the vaccine side effects. We found several side effects to positively correlate

97

with the immune response to S-RBD. This was seen with the total score of adverse effects, which

98

significantly associated with the IgG levels at all time points i.e. after the first dose (r= 0.3, p<0.01),

99

and 1 week (r= 0.47, p<0.0001) and 6 weeks after the second dose (r= 0.46, p<0.0001). An even

100

stronger correlation was present with fever at all time-points: r= 0.36 (p<0.001), r= 0.47 (p<0.0001),

101

r= 0.51(p<0.0001), and also other adverse symptoms such as headache, fatigue, malaise, chills, and

102

nausea were positively correlated with the vaccine response (Supplementary Figure 2).

103

The age of vaccinated individuals negatively correlated with the total score of side effects (r= -0.35,

104

p<0.001) as well as with several specific side effects (Supplementary Figure 2). Similar to the overall

105

vaccination response, when comparing the two sexes separately, we again found males to have a

106

stronger correlation of vaccine side effects with S-RBD antibody levels. The associations between the

107

score of all side effects and IgG levels were strikingly higher in males than in females at 1 week after

108

the second dose r= 0.87 (p<0.0005) vs r= 0.44 (p<0.0001) and at 6 weeks after the second dose r=

109

0.72 (p<0.01) vs r= 0.44 (p<0.001). Together the results indicate age- and sex-related variations in

110

side effects to mRNA vaccination responses.

111
112

Discussion

113

We report S-RBD IgG responses after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination showing a significant increase in

114

antibody levels after the second dose followed by a 45% decrease during the next 5 weeks. We found

115

significantly higher IgG levels in vaccinees after 2 doses compared to patients recovered from COVID-

116

19.

117

We found a negative correlation between antibody responses and the age of vaccinated individuals.

118

Age is an important factor that influences vaccine responses, and elderly people have been reported

119

to be poor responders to influenza, hepatitis A and B, and pneumococcal vaccines by developing

120

lower antibody levels and weaker cell-mediated responses.8–13. In addition to diminished post-vaccine

121

responses, older individuals tend to have a more rapid waning of antibodies after the vaccinations.

122

The adverse effect of age on COVID-19 mRNA vaccination has been found after the first dose in some

123

studies.1–4 We here show weaker mRNA vaccine response after the first dose and also 1 and 6 weeks

124

after the second dose, confirming the previous results but also show that this difference equalizes

125

and is less significant at 6 weeks after the second dose. Thus, our results indicate the benefit of the

126

second dose for older individuals and its effect to level up the short-term vaccination response in

127

younger and older persons, although the long-term persistence of post-vaccination antibody levels in

128

older populations remains to be studied.

129

Interestingly, although we could not see direct sex differences in the vaccine response, we found a

130

stronger negative association of age and S-RBD antibodies among males, indicating sex differences in

131

mRNA vaccination, which has not been reported by other COVID-19 mRNA vaccination studies. The

132

findings across the vaccination studies investigating the effect of sex on immune responses are

133

largely consistent but not uniform with females having higher antibody responses to dengue,

134

hepatitis A and B, inactivated polio, rabies, smallpox, and trivalent inactivated influenza vaccination,

135

with males having higher antibody responses to diphtheria, meningococcal, pneumococcal, and

136

tetanus vaccination.6 Our findings show that age remains an important negative factor for mRNA

137

vaccination in males whereas in females the second dose, by and large, abolishes the detrimental

138

impact of age on mRNA vaccination outcome. Despite the smaller representation of male

139

participants in our study, this suggests less efficient mRNA vaccination response in older males and

140

highlights the need to stratify vaccine responses among the elderly.

141

Common systemic side effects reported for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are fatigue, headache, muscle

142

pain, chills, and fever.14 In our study, 93% of vaccinated individuals reported some type of side-

143

effects, which is higher than previously reported 66% of vaccinated seronegative persons.14 In

144

agreement with our results, the side effects among some groups were seen in 100% of participants of

145

the mRNA vaccine phase 1/2 study.15 An expected, older participants reported fewer or even no side

146

effects as also seen earlier 4, and the presence and score of side effects correlated with S-RBD IgG

147

responses.

148

Taken together we report a robust vaccine response after two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty

149

(BNT162b2) vaccine with lower responses and fewer side effects in older individuals. We also found

150

that age-related decreased vaccine response persisted in older males even 6 weeks after the second

151

dose whereas this was no longer present in older female vaccines at this time point.
