Abstract
To diagnose COVID-19 patients in the field, a sensitive point-of-care test using saliva
was developed. Using a heat block without centrifuge, the test took 45 minutes.
Naked eye judgement with color change dye outperformed the reference standard,
with a diagnostic sensitivity of 82.6% (19/23) and diagnostic specificity of 100%
(21/21).

Introduction
With progressing globalization, the worldwide spread of infectious diseases has
accelerated. The new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) is a major public health
concern (WHO, 2020). With the high burden and risk for infection among patients and
healthcare workers, the advent of reverse transcription quantitative real-time
polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) testing as an alternative to nasopharyngeal
swab sampling for diagnosing COVID-19 has increased the use of saliva (Azzi et al.,
2020; Iwasaki et al., 2020; Nagura-Ikeda et al., 2020; To et al., 2020; Vogels et al.,
2020; Williams et al., 2020; Wyllie et al., 2020).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2), the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2
entry into human cells, is highly expressed on the oral cavity mucosa, especially
tongue epithelial cells (Iwasaki et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020). In Japan, many
COVID-19 cases have been found in metropolitan entertainment districts, where food,
drink, and conversation are frequent. Saliva droplets containing SARS-COV-2 are a
major vector for COVID-19 infection, making saliva a promising candidate for
COVID-19 testing (Azzi et al., 2020; Nagura-Ikeda et al., 2020; Wyllie et al., 2020).
While the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva samples is lower than in nasopharyngeal
swab samples (Iwasaki et al., 2020; Williams et al., 2020), several researchers have
reported comparable or better diagnostic sensitivity with saliva testing (Azzi et al.,
2020; Nagura-Ikeda et al., 2020; To et al., 2020; Vogels et al., 2020; Wyllie et al.,
2020).
The combined use of the direct-to-test addition by heating and RT-qPCR using
a nasopharyngeal swab sample has proven successful due to reduced inhibitory

effects (Esbin et. al, 2020). However, the saliva sample must undergo high-speed
centrifugation at 20,000 g for 5-30 min following purification with a commercial RNA
extraction kit to remove potential inhibitors (Azzi et al., 2020; Iwasaki et al., 2020;
Nagura-Ikeda et al., 2020; To et al., 2020; Williams et al., 2020; Wyllie et al., 2020).
This tedious RNA extraction process, which requires a well-equipped laboratory, is a
major hurdle for performing sensitive point-of-care testing (POCT) for COVID-19
using saliva.
Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is an
attractive option for achieving more-sensitive POCT than an immunochromatographic
assay because of its broader utility and portable real-time detector with an in-house
buttery or combination use with a cost-effective heat block and colorimetric reagent
(Augustine et al., 2020; Ecke et al., 2020; Hayashida et al., 2015; Park, et al., 2020).
Here, we developed a simple method for extracting RNA from saliva samples
using semi-alkaline proteinase (SAP), a sputum homogenizer for tuberculosis
examinations, and a subsequent simple heating step, with no need for centrifugation
or RNA extraction. Further, we newly developed a triplex RT-LAMP approach using
colorimetric readout in a heat block for the naked eye judgement. We preliminarily
evaluated the POCT performance with 44 clinical saliva samples.

The study
We used Primer Explorer V5 (primerexplorer.jp/lampv5e/index.html) to design three
primer sets targeting the ORF 1ab, S, and ORF 7a regions to simultaneously detect
SARS-CoV-2 with high sensitivity and robustness. To identify highly conserved
nucleotide sequences with low similarity to SARS-CoV-1 sequences, we performed
multiple

sequence

alignment

using

Clustal

Omega

(www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo) of 490 whole-genome SARS-Cov-2 sequences
from

the

DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank

databases

(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/)

submitted by worldwide researchers from five continents. The details of each primer
and in-house reagent are shown in S-Tables 1-3. Artificially synthesized SARS-CoV-2
sequences (Eurofins, Tokyo, Japan) corresponding to the three target regions and
RNA extracted from healthy human saliva were used as positive and negative
controls, respectively, for the triplex RT-LAMP format.
From May to July 2020, we collected at least 1 ml of saliva samples from 44
clinical patients suspected of having COVID-19 infection at Kyoto University Hospital
or Kyoto City Hospital. The saliva samples were mixed with 3 strength-volume of SAP
(Semi-Alkaline Proteinase, Suputazyme; Kyokuto Pharmaceutical Industrial, Tokyo,
Japan) manually or using a vortex mixer for 15 sec. After incubation for 15 min at
room temperature to dissolve the saliva components, each of the saliva-SAP mixtures
(SS mixes) were added to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. For RNA extraction, 140 μl
of each SS mix was eluted into 60 μl using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany). RT-qPCR using the N2 primers and probe was performed with 5 μl
of the extracted RNA in 20 μl of reaction mixture in LightCycler 480 System II (Roche,

Basel, Switzerland) according to the protocol recommended by the National Institute
of Infectious Diseases, Japan (Shirato et al., 2020). Ten-fold serial dilutions (5 to
5×106 copies/reaction) of the synthesized RNA containing the target sequence
(Shirato et al., 2020) were used to calculate the viral loads in clinical samples.
In parallel, for POCT, the remaining SS mix was heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and
then the tube was centrifuged using a dry-cell battery-powered tabletop centrifuge for
approximately 5 sec or swung manually to remove the aqueous droplet on the tube lid.
Using 50 µl of RT-LAMP reaction mixtures (including 10 μl of template), the RT-LAMP
reaction was monitored using a LightCycler 480 System II (Roche) at 63 °C for 25 min.
Subsequent procedures were completed without interruption, or else the SS mix was
stored at -80 °C until used. The limit of detection (LOD) of triplex RT-LAMP was
defined as the lowest concentration at which 95% of positive samples were detected
using a 2-fold series of phosphate-buffered saline dilutions in maximum 20 replicates
of 50,000, 25,000, 12,500, and 10,000 copies/ml of heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2
(ATCC VR-1986HK; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) (Table
2). The dilutions were heated at 95 °C for 5 min. After removal of the aqueous droplet
on the tube lid, 10 μl of the template was applied to 50 µl of RT-LAMP reaction
mixture, as described above.
Compared to reference standard, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were
82.6% (19/23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 61.2%-95.1%) and 100% (21/21, 95% CI,
83.8%-100%) for the new POCT, which took 45 min from starting crude RNA
extraction to endpoint readout with the naked eye (Table 1, Figure 1). As shown in
Table 1, 18 clinical samples exceeding 380 copies/reaction (>33,000 copies/ml of

saliva) by reference standard measurement were positive on POCT between 9:02
and 16:12 for amplification. Three samples showing low copy numbers at 170-230
copies/reaction (15,000-20,000 copies/ml of saliva) on RT-qPCR were only 1 positive
at 23:32 and 2 false negatives in POCT, which were interpreted as borderline
samples near the LOD of POCT. Another 2 samples showing lower copy numbers at
13-86 copies/reaction (1,100-7,400 copies/ml of saliva) were both false negatives,
possibly due to below the detection power of the POCT. The result obtained by the
LOD determination was the value of 250 copies/reaction (25,000 copies/ml) (Table 2).

Conclusion
Our newly developed POCT approach achieved simple RNA extraction and constant
RT-LAMP without the need for high-speed centrifugation, nucleic acid extraction kits,
or qPCR equipment. This POCT does not require expensive equipment and performs
comparably to an existing reference standard. This POCT can thus be used for
drive-through testing and simple inspection stations in a field setting, helping reduce
the risk of infection by simplifying and accelerating testing for COVID-19.
