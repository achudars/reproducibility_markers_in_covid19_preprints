Abstract
BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a novel strain of SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, China. Since
then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures and efforts in response to the outbreak.
METHODS: We quantified the effects of control measures on population contact patterns in Wuhan,
China, to assess their effects on the progression of the outbreak. We included the latest estimates of
epidemic parameters from a transmission model fitted to data on local and internationally exported
cases from Wuhan in the age-structured epidemic framework. Further, we looked at the age-distribution
of cases. Lastly, we simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a
phased-in way, and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying
outbreak.
FINDINGS: Changes in mixing patterns may have contributed to reducing the number of infections in
mid-2020 by 92% (interquartile range: 66–97%). There are benefits to sustaining these measures until
April in terms of reducing the height of the peak, overall epidemic size in mid-2020 and probability that
a second peak may occur after return to work. However, the modelled effects of social distancing
measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children play in the epidemic.
INTERPRETATION: Restrictions on activities in Wuhan, if maintained until April, would likely
contribute to the reduction and delay the epidemic size and peak, respectively. However, there are some

Introduction
The SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus, emerged in the City of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in early
December 2019.1,2 Since then, the local and national governments have taken unprecedented measures
in response to the COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2.3 Exit screening of passengers was
shortly followed by travel restrictions in Wuhan on 23rd January 2020, halting all means of unauthorised
travel into and out of the city. Similar control measures were extended to the entire province of Hubei
by 26th January 2020.3 Non-pharmaceutical social distancing interventions such as extended school
closure and workplace distancing were introduced to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in
Wuhan.4 Within the city, schools remained closed; Lunar New Year holidays were extended so that
people stayed away from their workplaces; the local government promoted social distancing and
encouraged residents to avoid crowded places. These measures are known to greatly changed the agespecific mixing patterns within the population in previous outbreak response efforts for other respiratory
infectious diseases.5,6 While travel restrictions undoubtedly had a role in reducing the exportations of
infections outside of Wuhan, and delayed the onset of outbreaks in other regions,7,8 changes in the
mixing patterns affected the trajectory of the outbreak within Wuhan itself. In order to estimate the
effects of social distancing measures on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, we look at Wuhan,
hoping to provide some insights for the rest of the world.
Person-to-person transmission is mostly driven by “who interacts with whom”,9,10 which can vary by
age and location of the contact i.e., school, work, home, and community. Under the context of a largescale on-going outbreak, contact patterns would drastically shift from their baseline conditions. In the
COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, social distancing measures including but not limited to school and
workplace closures and health promotions that encourage the general public to avoid crowded places
are designed to drastically shift social mixing patterns and are often used in epidemic settings.4 While
contact patterns can be inferred from reported social contact data that include the information in which
setting the contact took place, such studies are often focused on high-income countries,11 or particular
high-density areas.12 Prem and colleagues13 address that limitation by quantifying contact patterns in
the home, school, work and other locations across a range of countries based on available information
from household-level data and local population demographic structure.
To examine how these changes in population mixing have affected the outbreak progression in Wuhan,
we used synthetic location-specific contact patterns in Wuhan and adapted it in the presence of school
closures, extended workplace closures, reduction in mixing in the general community. Using these
matrices and the latest estimates of the epidemiological parameters of the Wuhan outbreak,14–16 we

simulated the ongoing trajectory of an outbreak in Wuhan using an age-structured susceptible-exposedinfectious-removed (SEIR) model17,18 for several social distancing measures.

Methods
SEIR model
We simulated the outbreak in Wuhan using a deterministic stage-structured SEIR model over a six
month period, during which the modelled outbreak peters out. An implication of this approach is that
all demographic changes in the population (i.e., births, deaths, and ageing) are ignored.
We divide the population according to the infection status into susceptible (𝑆), exposed (𝐸), infected
(𝐼), and removed (𝑅) individuals, and according to age into five-year bands until age 75 and a single
category aged 80+ (resulting in the total of 16 age categories, 𝑛). Susceptible individuals may acquire
the infection at a given rate when they come into contact with an infectious person, and enter the
exposed disease state before they become infectious and later either recover or die. We assume Wuhan
to be a close system with a constant population size of 11 million (i.e., 𝑁 = 𝑆 + 𝐸 + 𝐼 + 𝑅 = 11 million)
throughout the course of this epidemic. We considered the SEIR model presented in Figure 1. The agespecific mixing patterns of individuals in age group 𝑖 alter their likelihood of being exposed to the virus
given a certain number of infectives in the population. In addition, we incorporated contributions of
asymptomatic and subclinical cases, however, the question of whether they are able to transmit infection
is still not resolved at the time of writing, although current evidence suggests that they are likely to.19
We further considered a scenario where we assumed that younger individuals are more likely to be
asymptomatic (or subclinical) and less infectious than older individuals.20,21

Where 𝛽 is the transmission rate (scaled to the right value of 𝑅+ ), C!,& describe the contacts of age group
𝑗 made by age group 𝑖, 𝜅 = 1 − exp (−1/𝑑, ) is the daily probability of exposed individual becoming
infectious (with 𝑑, being the average incubation period), and 𝛾 = 1 − exp (−1/𝑑- ) is the daily
probability that an infected individual recovers when the average duration of infection is 𝑑- . We further
incorporated contributions of asymptomatic and subclinical cases, 1 − 𝜌! denotes the probability of an
infected cases being asymptomatic or subclinical. We assumed that younger individuals are more likely
to be asymptomatic (or subclinical) and less infectious (proportion of infectiousness compared to 𝐼 ' ,
𝛼).
Using parameters from the literature as presented in Table 1, we simulated the outbreak. In particular,
we assumed the average incubation period and average infectious period to be 6.4 days15 and 3 or 7
days, respectively. Each simulation started with 200 or 2000 infectious individuals 𝐼+ ,16 with the rest of
the population being in the susceptible state. We explored the uncertainty in the model by drawing 𝑅+
values uniformly from the 95% confidence interval from the posterior of the 𝑅+ distribution from the
semi-mechanistic model by Kucharski and colleagues14 (Fig S3).
Social mixing and interventions
Social mixing patterns vary across locations—households, workplaces, schools, and other locations.
Therefore, we use the method set out in Prem and colleagues13 which accounts for these differences,
and obtain the location-specific contact matrices C for different scenarios. In a normal setting, contacts
made at all of these locations contribute to the overall mixing pattern in a population, so we sum the
contacts across the different locations to obtain our baseline contact pattern in the population before the
outbreak (Fig 2, Fig S1 and Fig S2). In an outbreak setting, different intervention strategies are aimed
at reducing social mixing in different contexts in order to lower the overall transmission in the
population. To simulate the effects of interventions aimed at reducing social mixing, we create synthetic
contact matrices for each intervention scenario from these building block matrices.
We consider the following three scenarios: (1) theoretical: assume no change to social mixing patterns
at all location types, no school term break and no Lunar New Year holidays; (2) no interventions, winter
school break in Wuhan, and Lunar New Year holidays: assume no social distancing control measures,
school-going individuals do not have any contacts at school because of school holidays from 15th
January–10th February 2020 and 10% and later 75% of workforce will be working during the holidays
from 25th–31st January 2020 and from 1st –10th February 2020, respectively; (3) intense control
measures in Wuhan to contain the outbreak: assume school closure and about 10% of workforce—for
example, healthcare personnel, police, other essential government staff—will be working even during
the control measures (Fig 2 and Fig S4). For the third scenario, we further modelled the impact of

whether the intense control measures end in beginning of March or April, and we allowed for a
staggered return to work while the school remains closed, i.e. 25% of workforce will be working in
weeks one and two (Fig 2 second row), 50% of workforce will be working in weeks three and four to
work (Fig 2 third row), and 100% of workforce will be working and school resumes (Fig 2 fourth
row).3,22,23

Results
Our simulations show that the control measures aimed at reducing the social mixing in the population
can be effective in reducing the magnitude of the peak of the outbreak. Figure 3 shows the effects of
different control measures among individuals aged 55–60 and 10–15 years old. The standard school
winter break and holidays for the Lunar New Year would have had little effect on progression of the
outbreak had the school and workplace re-opened as normal.
We presented the median cumulative incidence (Fig 4A), incident case per day (Fig 4B) and agespecific incidence per day (Fig 4C–G) of the 200 simulated outbreaks. The 25th and 75th percentile
outbreaks are represented by the shaded area in the cumulative incidence. The intense control measures
of prolonged school closure and work holidays reduced the final size (Fig 4A) and peak incidence,
while also delaying the peak of the outbreak (Fig 4B). Our model suggests that the effects of these
social distancing strategies vary across age categories, the reduction in incidence is highest among
school children and older individuals and lowest among working-aged adults (Fig 4C–G and Fig 5).
These measures were most effective if staggered return to work was at the beginning of April; this
reduced the overall number of infections in mid-2020 size by more than 92% (interquartile range: 66–
97%) (Fig 5 and Fig S4) should the disease have a longer duration of infectiousness, and greatly reduced
the magnitude of the peak incidence across all age categories (Fig 4C–E) which can have further
beneficial impact by relieving the pressure on the healthcare system. However, premature return to
work can result in an increase in incidence even if it originally seemed that the epidemic has started to
turn over (second wave, Fig 4B peak of the orange line followed by the sharp increase in incidence in
red line). Uncertainty in 𝑅+ values has a large impact on the timing of the peak and the final size of the
outbreak (Fig 4A).
The modelled effects of intense control measures of prolonged school closure and work holidays vary
by the duration of infectiousness. If the disease had a short infectious period (3 days), then the model
suggests that relaxing the social distancing interventions in March (Fig 5A) could avert approximately
half of cases in school children and older individuals. More than half of the cases could be averted
should the disease have a longer duration of infectiousness (for e.g., 7 days as presented in Fig 5C)—

social distancing interventions would need to be relaxed a month later (in April) in order to observe a
larger effect. If children were less infectious as described in M2, lifting the social distancing
interventions in April instead of March could have less additional health benefits (Fig 5B and 5D).

Discussion
SARS-CoV-2, a contact-transmissible infectious disease, percolates through a population through direct
contact between infected and susceptible individuals.1,9,10 Outbreak control measures aimed at reducing
the amount of mixing in the population have the potential to reduce the final size of the epidemic and
the magnitude of the peak. To evaluate the effect of location-specific social distancing measures such
as extended school closure and interventions around workplaces on the magnitude of the peak and the
final size, we accounted for these heterogeneities in contact networks in our model. Here, we simulated
outbreaks and modelled the interventions by scaling down the appropriate component of the contact
mixing matrices for China.
Mathematical models can help us understand how SARS-CoV-2 would spread across the population
and inform control measures that may mitigate future transmission.24,25 Here, we simulated the
trajectory of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, using an age-structured SEIR model.17,18
Because individuals’ mixing patterns are non-random, they influence the transmission dynamics of the
disease.11 Models assessing the effectiveness of social distancing interventions, such as school closure,
need to account for social structures and heterogeneities in mixing of individuals.26–30 In our model, we
incorporated changes to age- and location-specific social mixing patterns to estimate the effects of
location-specific social distancing interventions in curtailing the spread of the outbreak. Consequently,
if these restrictions are lifted prematurely while there are still enough susceptibles to keep the 𝑅. > 1
once contacts increase, the number of infections would increase. Realistically, interventions are lifted
slowly, partly as an attempt to avoid a sharp increase in infection, but also for logistical and practical
reasons. Therefore, lifting the interventions was simulated in a staggered fashion, whereby the
interventions were relaxed bit-by-bit (Figures 3, 4 and 5).
Current evidence of the effects of various social distancing measures on containing the outbreak are
limited and little is known about the behavioural changes of individuals over a period of time either
during an outbreak, or otherwise. Therefore, to model the effects of the social distancing measures
implemented in Wuhan, we assumed what effect certain types of social distancing has on age- and
location-specific contact rates.
Much remains to be discovered about the true age-specific susceptibility and transmissibility of
COVID-19. Therefore, we assumed no heterogeneity in susceptibility between children. Furthermore,

for simplicity we assumed children and adults were equally transmissible, other than the differences in
their contact rates. Similar to a flu-like pathogen, the model suggests that interactions between school
children and the older individuals in the population have important public health implications, as
children may have high infection rates while the elderly are more vulnerable to severe infections with
potentially fatal outcome.31,32 However, unlike models built for pandemic or seasonal flu, we do take
into account the lack of population immunity to SARS-CoV-2.
Extreme social distancing measures, including school closures, workplace closures, and avoiding any
public gatherings all at once, can push the transmission to households leading to increased clustering in
household cases.5 As households are not explicitly included in the model, we do not consider
heterogeneity and clustering of household transmission. Distinguishing between repeated and new
contacts is important for disease propagation in contact network models,33,34 more sophisticated
methods accounting for temporal presence within the household35 would be needed to characterise
higher degrees of contact.
A key parameter is the basic reproduction number (𝑅+ ) which determines how fast SARS-CoV-2
spreads through the population during the early stages of the outbreak. This is an inherently difficult
parameter to estimate, since the true number of cases that can transmit infection at a given time is
unknown (reported cases are likely to be just a small fraction of these), and likely varies over time (due
to different interventions being introduced and population behaviour changing in response to the
epidemic). In our analysis, we used an existing model that inferred time-dependent 𝑅. based on the
growth of reported cases in Wuhan as well as number of exported cases outside China originating from
Wuhan.14
Social distancing and travel restrictions combined have clearly aided the lowering of the transmission
of COVID-19 over the course of the ongoing outbreak in Wuhan.8,36,37 Evidence for this drop in
transmission can be gleaned from the time-varying estimates of the reproductive number,14 or, even
more simply, observing that the turnover of the epidemic has occurred far before the depletion of the
susceptibles indicates the effects of the implemented measures. Insofar as social distancing alone is
responsible for the drop is extremely difficult to quantify, especially during the ongoing epidemic.
Therefore we took a broad-view of the question, making assumptions about the result of certain forms
of social distancing and measuring the effects somewhat qualitatively. However, it is clear that to a
greater or lesser extent, social distancing has resulted in both a shorter epidemic and one with a lower
peak. Given what is known about the transmissibility and (the relatively long) incubation period of
COVID-19,1,15 the efficacy of social distancing in reducing these important attributes of any epidemic
are no surprise.

Conclusion
Non-pharmaceutical interventions based on sustained social distancing have a strong potential to reduce
the magnitude of the peak and lead to overall smaller number of cases. Lowering and flattening of the
epidemic peak is particularly important, as it reduces the acute pressure on the health system. Premature
and sudden lifting of interventions could lead to a secondary peak that can be flattened by relaxing the
interventions gradually.

Figure 1. Age-structured SEIR model and details of the modelled social distancing
interventions. The age-specific mixing patterns of individuals in age group 𝑖 alter their likelihood
of being exposed to the virus given a certain number of infectives in the population. Younger
individuals are more likely to be asymptomatic and less infectious, i.e. subclinical (SC). When 𝜌! =

Figure 2. Synthetic age- and location-specific contact matrices for China under various social
distancing scenarios during the intense control period. The synthetic age-specific contact patterns
across all locations, at home, at the workplace, in school, and at other locations during normal
circumstances (i.e. under no intervention) are presented in panels A–E. The age- and location-specific
contact matrices under the various social distancing interventions are presented in the panels F–T.
Darker colour intensities indicate higher proclivity of making the age-specific contact.

Figure 3. Effects of different intervention strategies on the cumulative incidence and new cases
per day among individuals aged 55–60 (A to D) and 10–15 (E to H) from late 2019 to mid-2020.
Under two scenarios children being equally infectious and children being less infectious, the effects
of social distancing measures were investigated. Theoretical no intervention (black line), school
break and LNY (blue line) and intense control measures that are relaxed in a staggered fashion at the
beginning of March (red line), and intense control measures that are relaxed in a staggered fashion
at the beginning of April (orange line). Shading indicates the timing of the school holidays, Lunar
New Year (dark vertical line), intense control measures (dark grey), and staggered return to work
followed by school opening (lighter grey).

Figure 4. Effects of the different social distancing measures on the cumulative incidence (A)
and new cases per day (B), and age-specific incidence per day (C to G) from late 2019 to mid2020. The median cumulative incidence, incident cases per day and age-specific incidence per day
are represented as solid lines. The 25th and 75th percentile outbreaks are represented by the shaded
area in the cumulative incidence. Theoretical no intervention (black line), school break and Lunar
New Year (blue line) and intense control measures that are relaxed in a staggered fashion at the
beginning of March (red line), and intense control measured that are relaxed in a staggered fashion
at the beginning of April (orange line). Shading indicates the timing of the school holidays, Lunar

Figure 5. The modelled proportion of number of infections averted in mid-2020 by age for the
different social distancing measures, assuming the duration of infectiousness to be (A and B) 3
days and (C and D) 7 days. The additional proportions of cases averted (compared to no
intervention) are presented across age and by the different social distancing measures: school break
and Lunar New Year (blue area), intense control measures that are relaxed in a staggered fashion at
the beginning of March (red area), and intense control measures that are relaxed in a staggered fashion
at the beginning of April (orange area).
