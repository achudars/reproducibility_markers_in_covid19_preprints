Abstract
Introduction :
The evidence that BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) vaccine may increase the ability of the immune
system to fight off pathogens other than tuberculosis has been studied in the past. This nonspecific
immunity gained our interest, especially after initial reports of less cases in countries with
universal BCG vaccination. In hopes of possible protective immunity, all staff of the Emirates
International Hospital (United Arab Emirates) were offered a booster BCG vaccine in early March
2020. All the hospital staff were then tested for Covid-19 infection by the end of June 2020.
Methodology :
We divided the subjects into two groups: booster vaccinated, versus unvaccinated. The rate of Covid-19
infection was compared between the groups. Criteria included all staff who were offered the vaccine.
Results:
71 subjects received the booster vaccination. This group had zero cases of positive COVID 19
infection. 209 subjects did not receive the vaccination, with 18 positivePCR confirmed COVID 19 cases
The infection rate in the unvaccinated group was 8.6% versus zero in the booster vaccinated group.
(Fisher’s exact test p-value=0.004).
Conclusion :
Our findings demonstrated the potential effectiveness of the booster BCG vaccine, specifically the
booster in preventing Covid-19 infections in an elevated-risk healthcare population.

Introduction
BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin), is a vaccine for M. tuberculosis infection (TB) both pulmonary
and more so extra-pulmonary forms. It contains a live, attenuated form of Mycobacterium bovis
strain and is only used in countries where the prevalence of TB is high. With initial reports of less
cases and a lower death toll of Covid-19 in countries with universal childhood BCG vaccination,
attention was turned to the non-specific effects (NSE) of this vaccine and how it may boost the
immune response against Covid-19 1,2. The Emirates International Hospital (EIH) functions as one
of the centers for Covid-19 testing in the region as well as treating infected patients, putting the
hospital staff at an elevated risk. In the first half of March 2020, at the upslope of the Covid-19
curve in the UAE, a decision was made by the EIH Covid-19 safety committee to offer a booster
BCG (Serum Institute of India PVT.LTD. Hadaspar India) vaccination to the hospital staff. The
prospect of increasing community infection, elevated risk to the hospital staff, and the available
evidence about the BCG vaccine and potential non-specific effects against Covid-19 was taken
into consideration. After thorough information about the vaccine and its prospects were provided
to the hospital staff, voluntary vaccination was started. Out of 280 total staff, 71 received the vaccine
in the span of two weeks. Compulsory government-mandated Covid-19 testing with PCR
(CITOSWAB® nasopharyngeal swab) in the months of April, May, and June was done on all
hospital staff. Testing was also was done in the setting of contact with positive patients and staff
symptoms. The results of BCG immunity against Covid-19 infections was studied retrospectively.

Methodology :
After approval by the hospital review board and ethics committee, a retrospective cohort study of
the entire hospital personnel was done and they were divided into two groups: those who received
the BCG booster vaccine in March (group A), and those that did not (group B). Using a two-tailed
Fisher’s exact test, the probability of testing positive in each group was compared.

Results :
Hospital staff were of Arabic, Indian, East Asian, African, and European origin. They were aged
between 21 to 80 years and included clinical and non-clinical staff such as the receptionists, nurses,
and physicians. By June 24th, 2020, 18 cases of SARS-cov-2 infection were documented in the
hospital staff (Figure 1). Group A included 71 individuals who received the BCG booster, and none tested
positive for SARS-cov-2 infection . Group B, which included 209 non-booster vaccinated staff, had
18positivePCR COVID-19 cases (Table 1), 13 of which were symptomatic and 5 had no symptoms.
The infection rate was 18/209 or 8.6% in Group B, and zero in Group A. No reports of local or systemic
complications was noted with the BCG booster vaccine group. The difference was statically
significant, with a p-value of 0.004.
Both groups A and B had the BCG vaccine administered at birth, however no information was
available about the exact brand of the BCG vaccine that were used. None of the Covid-19 positive
staff had reported any high risk activity outside the hospital, infected household, or travel prior to
their positive test. The positive Covid-19 subjects did not demonstrate any particular departmental
and location distribution compared to the not infected. There was no collected data on hospital
staff comorbidities and other medications used in either group.

Discussion :

Certain vaccines such as BCG, measles, and oral polio may have beneficial non-specific effects
(NSE) beyond the pathogens they had been intended for 3. The epidemiological evidence that
BCG may increase the ability of the immune system to fight off pathogens other than TB has been
studied in the past, receiving mixed reviews initially and then a positive review by the World
Health Organization 4,5. Such NSE’s are thought to be due to not only T cell–mediated adaptive
immunity but also induction and enhancement of innate immunity 4,6. It has been shown that the
positive effect of the BCG vaccine given at birth or to children diminishes over time which likely
indicates declining central memory immunity. It has been shown that a booster vaccine is needed
to maintain the T cell response and antigen-specific central memory to battle TB infections years
after the initial vaccine 7,8.

With lack of clinical data on the effectiveness of BCG vaccine in preventing Covid-19 infection,
the decision to offer the vaccine to the hospital staff was based on available population based
evidence, elevated risk of death and morbidity with the spread of Covid-19 amongst the staff, as
well as proven safety of BCG vaccine over the years. This is a relatively small population sample
who all work in the same environment with elevated levels of exposure to Covid-19 compared to
the general population of the Al-Ain region of the UAE. None of the hospital staff who were booster
BCG vaccinated tested positive with Covid-19 versus a 8.6% infection rate amongst those who
were not recently vaccinated with a booster. There was similar universal personal protective
equipment policy throughout the hospital with no specific pattern of infection correlating to the
location of work in the hospital. Thus we assumed that any discrepancy of exposure level is
minimized between the two groups.
Despite population-based findings on the protective role of BCG vaccination on Covid-19
infection 1,2,9, a recent study by Hamiel et al in young adults found that childhood vaccination may
not have a significant protective effect in younger people 10. All our 280 hospital staff (Group A
and B) were vaccinated with BCG at birth. The lack of Covid-19 infection in our recently
vaccinated versus the high rate of infection in the non-recently vaccinated group, suggest stronger
protective effect of booster BCG vaccination compared to birth vaccination. The effect of such
NSE immunity are poorly understood and we do not know how long the presumed immunity may
last.
The limitations of our study are several, such as lack of clear understanding and documentation of
any confounding factors between the two groups that could have influenced the transmission and
infection rate, sample size, and discrepancy between the number of subjects in the two group. Staff
comorbidity as well as any over the counter supplements that the staff could have taken in
attempts to prevent Covid-19 infection was not documented. Despite the limitations of this study,
we feel that our findings of 8.6% versus zero percent infection rate is significant enough to
suggest the promising effectiveness of an up-to-date BCG booster vaccine in prevention of Covid19 infection and therefore warrants reporting.
It is important to note that despite the statistically significant clinical evidence presented here,
disregarding the study limitations and recommending mass BCG vaccination before prospective
trials is an overreach and could create a false and dangerous sense of confidence in vaccine
recipients. The health authority in many countries have recommended a booster BCG vaccine to
prevent TB infection11. Some physicians may consider providing voluntary booster BCG
vaccination, especially in areas of substantial Covid-19 outbreak in which tuberculosis is already
prevalent. If such decision is made, it should be in accordance to the local ethical medical practice
principles, with full disclosure of treatment and preventative options, short term and long term side

effects and without misleading or deceptive promises made to patients. Adverse effects of BCG
vaccine are rare local reactions that are temporary, and extremely rare serious complication of
disseminated BCG infection. BCG vaccination should not be given during pregnancy, to persons
who are immunosuppressed, or who are likely to become immunocompromised 12.
Conclusion :
Our findings are the first and only one to date to demonstrate possible NSE immunity to SARScov-2 infection in a clinical setting. Prospective studies with vaccination of high risk health care
workers can further clarify the relationship of booster BCG vaccine and the level of immunity it
provides.
