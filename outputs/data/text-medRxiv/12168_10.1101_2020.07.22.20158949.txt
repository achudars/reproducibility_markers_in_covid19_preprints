ABSTRACT

25

Objectives: To determine the relationship between the emergence of COVID-19 and neonatal

26

intensive care unit (NICU) family presence as well as how NICU design affects these changes.

27

Study Design: A cross-sectional survey from April 21 to 30, 2020. We queried sites regarding

28

NICU demographics, NICU restrictions on parental presence, and changes in ancillary staff

29

availability.

30

Results: Globally, 277 facilities responded to the survey. NICU policies preserving 24/7 parental

31

presence decreased (83% to 53%, p<0.001) and of preserving full parental participation in

32

rounds fell (71% to 32%, p<0.001). Single family room design NICUs best preserved 24/7

33

parental presence after the emergence of COVID-19 (single family room 65%, hybrid-design

34

57%, open bay design 45%, p=.018). In all, 120 (43%) NICUs reported reductions in therapy

35

services, lactation medicine, and/or social work support.

36

Conclusions: Hospital restrictions have significantly limited parental presence for NICU

37

admitted infants, although single family room design may attenuate this effect.

Background
Approximately 8.4% of United States newborns are admitted into neonatal intensive care

49

units (NICUs) every year [1]. For extremely premature infants or those with major congenital

50

anomalies, these admissions can last several months. Extended intimate contact of a newborn

51

with its parents, both mother and father, has been shown to have physiological and psychological

52

benefits to both newborn and parents [2]. This contact, often referred to as skin-to-skin or

53

kangaroo care, provides many familiar sensory inputs such as the mother’s voice, taste, and

54

smell that cannot be replicated by others and improves physiological stability to the preterm

55

infant [3]. This contact establishes a lasting bond that promotes both neurodevelopment in the

56

infant [4] and enhanced mental health in the mother [3]. In addition to causing significant

57

anxiety, acute stress, and post-traumatic stress for parents, admission to the NICU signifies a

58

disturbance in the maternal-infant bond, which can be detrimental to the development of the

59

newborn [4]. The introduction of family centered care and allowing 24-hour parental presence,

60

especially in the setting of single-family rooms, may help increase parental presence, ameliorate

61

some of these effects [5] and improve developmental outcomes [6].

62

In response to the emergence of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the Centers for

63

Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a sequential series of recommendations. These

64

included closure of elementary, middle and high schools on 3/12/2020 [7], screening of visitors

65

entering health care facilities on 3/20/2020 [8], and implementation of social distancing on

66

4/4/2020 which included working from home when possible [9]. While severe illness appears to

67

be most prevalent in adults, transmission by asymptomatic adults and children may be

68

widespread [10, 11]. Multiple media reports have documented prohibition of visitation for

69

hospitalized adults, including when in extremis, in attempts to limit disease transmission [12,

70

13].

71

The tension between protection of infants and caregivers from serious infection and the

72

desire to maximize the developmental outcome of newborns forces consideration of several

73

options for restricted interaction, none of them optimal. While neonatal COVID-19 disease

74

appears relatively uncommon, the risk-benefit calculation for restricting NICU access remains

75

unclear. Further, no published data exist regarding the timing of implementing hospital and

76

NICU entry restrictions or the extent of those restrictions after the emergence of COVID-19. We

77

surveyed hospital sites globally to better understand the timeline and rigidity of hospital and

78

NICU entry restrictions. Additionally we queried sites regarding new limitations in ancillary

79

personnel such as therapy services and lactation consultants. We hypothesized that the

80

availability of a large number of private (“single-family”) rooms in a NICU would decrease the

81

likelihood that the most restrictive parental presence policies would be considered necessary,

82

when compared to NICUs in which most or all of the beds were in a multi-bed rooms.

83

Methods

84

We performed a cross-sectional survey of global NICUs, with a focus on the United

85

States, to determine hospital and NICU entry policies prior to and during the COVID-19

86

pandemic. The 21-item survey was built of both closed and open response items requesting

87

information on policies both before and during the spread of COVID-19 (Supplemental Figure

88

1). In particular, we requested information regarding location, type of hospital, NICU design,

89

hospital and NICU entry policies, parental presence, and reductions in support staff. The survey

90

was distributed through multiple venues from April 21 through April 30, 2020. These included

91

an e-mail to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Section of Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine

92

listserv of NICU medical and quality improvement directors, MEDNAX practice medical

93

directors, and to the MEDNAX Neonatology Forum.. In parallel, we released the survey on

94

Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and group chats of neonatologists and neonatal nurse practitioners.

95

In all venues we requested a response from the NICU medical or nursing director.

96

We included only those responses with at least completion of the first two sections of the

97

survey (NICU demographics and visitation practices) and excluded multiple responses from the

98

same NICU. To evaluate duplicate responses, we examined NICU zip code and baseline

99

demographics. We determined a priori to include the first fully completed survey from any

100

NICU or, in the case of multiple partially completed surveys, the first submitted response. While

101

the stated preference was for NICU medical or nursing directors to respond to the survey, due to

102

the methods of distribution this could not be controlled for.

103

The primary outcomes of interest were the presence of policies allowing 24-hour parental

104

presence in the NICU and allowing full parental participation in NICU rounds. Secondary

105

outcomes of interest included screening policies related to hospital entry and the impact of

106

COVID-19 on NICU staffing availability. The study was approved by the Methodist Healthcare

107

Institutional Review Board, San Antonio, TX.

108

Data Analysis

109

Two main approaches were used to analyze the data: sample descriptive statistics and

110

comparisons of policies from before the spread of COVID-19 to after the start of the spread. For

111

descriptive statistics, we used counts and percentages, presented in tables and figures. For policy

112

comparisons, given the survey responses were all categorical, we used a series of McNemar’s

113

tests for all pre-post comparisons and Chi-square tests for comparisons between NICU designs.

114

To adjust for the multiple hypothesis tests, we used a false discovery rate adjustment throughout

115

this manuscript [14]. Analyses were performed in SPSS version 26 and R version 3.6.2.

116

Results

117

A total of 339 responses were received. Of these, 56 were excluded for incompletion of at

118

least the first two survey pages and 6 excluded for duplicate NICU responses, leaving 277

119

surveys for analysis. Respondents most frequently learned of the survey through AAP and

120

MEDNAX email requests (83%) and responding NICUs were largely in the United States (91%)

121

with Texas, California, and Florida NICUs comprising 33% of the total cohort (Table 1,

122

Supplemental Figure 2a). The characteristics of the responding NICUs are described in Table 1.

123

Across the United States, the timeline for implementing state-wide stay at home orders

124

did not begin until the second half of March [15]. However, hospital and NICU entry policies

125

began to change in the first week of January with a rapid increase in hospitals adopting policy

126

changes throughout March, the majority prior to the issuance of CDC guidance (Supplemental

127

Figure 3). At the state level, the mean date for changing hospital entry policies varied

128

significantly. Hospitals in 4 states averaged implementation of hospital restrictions as early as

129

February and 3 states as late as April (Supplemental Figure 2b). The first international NICU

130

restricted entry in January, followed by 21 units in March, and 5 in April. Overall, 184 (66%)

131

NICUs reported that their new policies during the COVID-19 pandemic were broadly more

132

restrictive than the customary policies implemented during the winter influenza / respiratory

133

syncytial virus season.

134
135

Changes in overall hospital entry screening policies became widespread during the
COVID-19 pandemic (Table 2). These included significant increases in physical temperature

136

checks as well as screening questions regarding travel history, fever, and illness for hospital

137

entry.

138

Hospitals implemented parallel changes affecting NICU entry after the emergence of

139

COVID-19 (Table 2). NICUs broadly implemented screening questions for travel history

140

(76.5%), fever and illness (94.9%) as well as physical temperature checks (72.2%). The number

141

of NICUs allowing 24-hour parental presence in the NICU decreased significantly (83% to 53%,

142

p < 0.001). While full team and parental participation in NICU rounds predominated prior to the

143

COVID-19 pandemic, this became significantly less common during the pandemic (71.1% vs.

144

32.1%, p < 0.001, Table 2). The number of states with over 80% of responding NICUs allowing

145

full team and parental participation in NICU rounds fell from 20 (50%, Supplemental Figure 2c)

146

to 3 (8%, Supplemental Figure 2d).

147

Within the 130 NICUs that restricted parental presence during the COVID-19 pandemic,

148

we found a variety of policy measures described (Supplemental Figure 4). This included 7

149

NICUs (5%) excluding all parental presence, 2 (2%) of which would not allow parents to enter

150

even with their infant in extremis. Most NICUs restricting parental presence only allowed one

151

parent at the bedside at any time (85%) and a minority (25%) required families to choose a single

152

parent to be allowed into the NICU for the entire hospital stay.

153

We examined the influence of NICU design (all open bay, single family room, or hybrid)

154

on NICU entry and NICU rounding policies. All NICU design types implemented significant

155

increases in routine screening measures after the COVID-19 outbreak and had significant

156

decreases in 24-hour parental presence, but these restrictions were less in single family room

157

NICUs (84% to 64%, absolute difference 20%, p = .009) compared to hybrid (91% to 57%,

158

absolute difference 34% p < 0.001) and open bay units (78% to 45%, absolute difference 33%, p

159

< 0.001, Table 3). While 24-hour unrestricted parental presence was not significantly different

160

between all NICU designs prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we found significant differences

161

during the pandemic (single family room 65%, hybrid-design 57%, open bay design 45%, p =

162

.018).

163

With respect to parental presence during rounds, prior to the emergence of COVID-19,

164

we found significant differences in NICUs allowing full parental presence in rounds based on

165

NICU design (SFR 83%, hybrid NICUs 73%, open bay NICUs 63%, p = 0.013). However, all

166

NICU design types imposed a significant restriction in parental participation in NICU rounds

167

during the pandemic (Table 3). After the emergence of COVID-19 we found no significant

168

differences in full parental participation in NICU rounds across design types (SFR 37%, hybrid

169

34%, open bay 28%, p = 0.6).

170

NICUs reported significant changes in staffing or outcome measures temporally

171

associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. These included 28% of sites reducing nursing staff

172

hours, 28% reducing physical (PT), occupational (OT), and/or speech therapy (ST) and 23%

173

delaying non-urgent procedures (most commonly gastrostomy tubes). We also found 21% of

174

NICUs reported decreased lactation consultant visits, 16% restricted donor milk utilization, and

175

8% reported changes in breastfeeding rates. In all, 120 (43%) NICUs reported reductions in

176

therapy services, lactation medicine, and/or social work support. Social services and lactation

177

medicine offered supplemental telehealth support in 109 (41%) NICUs.

178

Discussion

179

Prohibitions on family presence for critically ill or dying adults as a result of COVID-19

180

pandemic have been widely reported by the media. Little is known however regarding how

181

COVID-19 has impacted family presence for minors, including the most vulnerable in our

182

population – those admitted to NICUs. These data represent the first report documenting the

183

widespread, rapid, and profound restrictions in hospital and NICU visitation practices secondary

184

to the COVID-19 pandemic. Policy changes began in early January and hospitals rapidly adopted

185

entry limitations throughout March 2020. The result has been a significant shift in family

186

presence for sick infants and of the way parents experience the first phases of their newborn’s

187

lives in the NICU environment. An additional secondary effect of COVID-19 has been delays in

188

elective procedures and the reduction of staff in many NICUs including therapy services,

189

lactation support, and social services -- all important for optimal outcomes. Ultimately, as health

190

care systems attempt to prevent the spread of coronavirus, new policies have led to families

191

interacting very differently with their infants in the NICU — or not at all. These rapidly

192

instituted changes may carry with them the risk of secondary unintended consequences [16].

193

In this cross-sectional survey of 277 NICUs we found widespread implementation of

194

hospital and NICU screening measures, including decreases in NICUs allowing 24-hour parental

195

presence (83% to 53%). Single family room NICU design may attenuate some

196

restrictions. Private rooms make certain infection control measures easier by providing physical

197

distancing, physical barriers, and separate air supplies [17, 18]. At baseline we found no

198

differences in 24-hour parental presence among various NICU designs. However, we found more

199

NICUs with single-family room design able to maintain 24-hour parental presence and

200

interaction with babies and caregivers than open bay units (64% vs 45%). This clinically

201

meaningful preservation of parental presence occurred at a time when many other limitations

202

were imposed, including limiting parental participation in NICU rounds.

203
204

We find that restrictions in NICU parental presence have been widely adopted and that
the ability for parents to participate in aspects of shared decision making such as family centered

205

rounds have diminished significantly. Family-centered rounds (FCRs) are multidisciplinary

206

rounds that occur at the patient’s bedside, in the presence of patients and family members, and

207

integrate patient and parent perspectives and preferences into clinical decision-making. Prior to

208

the COVID-19 pandemic, 71% of NICUs allowed full team and parental participation in NICU

209

rounds, falling to 32% during the pandemic. Family-centered care has been recommended by

210

both the Institute of Medicine [19] and AAP [20] as key to improving the quality and safety of

211

health care. Recommendations include conducting attending rounds in patients’ rooms with

212

family members present and ensuring that decisions on care plans for patients should be made

213

only after such rounds, to incorporate family involvement in decision making. Identified benefits

214

of FCR include improved patient satisfaction, communication, discharge planning, medical

215

education, and patient safety [21]. It has also been suggested that family involvement in care can

216

decrease family stress while improving patient’s outcomes [22, 23]. The abrupt restrictions in

217

parental presence and family participation in rounds necessarily also disrupts the ability to

218

provide family centered care. The impact of these changes on parental stress, patient safety, and

219

patient outcomes require further investigation.

220

Prior infectious outbreaks, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), resulted

221

in increased mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and

222

depression [24]. Data from Wuhan, China demonstrates a similar increase in psychopathology,

223

with some reports suggesting that women may have an increased burden of mental health

224

disorders in the current pandemic [25, 26]. Pregnancy has known associations with significant

225

emotional distress under normal circumstances, and women’s mental health in the perinatal

226

period is significantly affected by access to social support and resources [27, 28]. This raises the

227

concern that pregnant and postpartum women may be particularly vulnerable to the psychosocial

10

228

hardships caused by the pandemic. Studies have also suggested that higher maternal stress may

229

lead to reductions in warm, contingent caregiving (i.e., caregiver responsiveness), which in turn

230

can affect infant neurodevelopment [29, 30]. The described restrictions on parental presence for

231

ill newborns may further magnify the existing stressors associated with the perinatal period and

232

NICU admission.

233

An important component of the care for ill newborns, especially those born prematurely,

234

is the developmental team, whose members include disciplines such as OT, PT and ST with

235

involvement from social work, and lactation consultants [31, 32]. Overall, 43% of responding

236

NICUs reported decreases in at least one area of these support services. While some sites offered

237

telehealth options for these services, the efficacy of telehealth in this setting is unknown. In

238

addition to direct patient care, the developmental team plays an important role in educating

239

parents on key techniques to implement on a daily basis both in the hospital and post-discharge

240

[33, 34]. While possibly implemented in an effort to minimize the spread of COVID-19 to

241

vulnerable patients, diminished social work and developmental care services to premature infants

242

may have long-term adverse consequences.

243

Strengths of this study include responses from a large number of hospitals and NICUs

244

across the United States and around the world. These data are sufficient to provide a granular

245

understanding of the timeline by which hospitals and facilities implemented restrictions and how

246

access became significantly limited even in areas of the hospital with minimal disease burden

247

from COVID-19 such as the NICU. Further, many facilities provided data regarding limitations

248

in support services, providing indications of the secondary effects the COVID-19 pandemic has

249

quickly caused. Limitations include those inherent to survey studies including inability to verify

250

responses, incomplete responses, and inability to ask follow-up questions of respondents. In

251

addition, despite our stated intention to receive responses from NICU medical or nursing

252

directors, the identity of the respondent could not be controlled for. We cannot rule out further

253

evolution of hospital policies after the completion of the survey window. Lastly, due to the

254

distribution platforms used for this survey, a denominator and thus response rate could not be

255

determined.

256

Discussion

257

In summary, we report dramatic and rapid changes in hospital and NICU entry policies

258

related to COVID-19. These changes have significantly affected parental presence for NICU

259

admitted neonates, although single family room design may partially attenuate this effect. In

260

addition to these restrictions, limitations in support staff as well as delays in elective procedures

261

for NICU admitted infants are common. In total, the rapid implementation of these sweeping

262

changes may have substantial impact on parental and family well-being and may lead to

263

detrimental effects on neonatal health outcomes. Further investigation regarding the short- and

264

long-term impact of these policy changes is urgently needed.

Supporting Data

Short Answer:
12) Assuming policies in your unit are more restrictive than in non-pandemic times, have you
increased your support staff to account for more phone calls and updates for families?
13) How have you implemented CDC social distancing guidelines for parents/caregivers that
are allowed into the UNIT?
14) How have you implemented CDC social distancing guidelines for healthcare workers?
15) How have your changed your practice around HCW that also service adult patients (i.e.
radiology, RTs, phlebotomy).
16) Suggestions for the future if you had to do it again

Supplemental Figure 2: Geographical Distribution of Responding NICUs, Entry Policy
Changes, and Level of Parental Participation in Rounds

Supplemental Figure 2 Legend: Responses were received from NICUs in 40 out of 50 US
States, with 3 states having more than 15 NICUs respond to the survey (Panel A). The average
date of changing hospital entry policies varied by state, with the majority averaging policy
change between March 16 and 31 (Panel B). Prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic,
permitting full parental participation in NICU rounds was commonplace (Panel C). However,
during the pandemic very few states had a majority of NICUs allowing full parental participation
in rounds.

Supplemental Figure 3 Legend: Very few hospitals altered their entry dates in January or
February, 2020. However this rapidly changed in March with most NICUs changing their policy
prior to the issuance of specific guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) on March 20, 2020.

Supplemental Figure 4: Flow Diagram of Restrictions to Parental Presence in the NICU After
the Emergence of Covid-19

Supplemental Figure 4 Legend: Overall, 130 of 277 NICUs (47%) had restrictions to NICU
parental in the NICU during the Covid-19 pandemic. Of these, most allowed only a single parent
at the bedside and 33 NICUs required families to choose a single parent for the entire hospital
stay. Prohibition of parental presence in the NICU was rare but occurred at 7 sites (3%).
