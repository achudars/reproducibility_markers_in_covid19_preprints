Abstract
There is striking racial disparity in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) infection rates in the United States. We hypothesize that the disparity is significantly
smaller in areas with a higher ratio of green spaces at the county level. This study used the 135
most urbanized counties across the United States as sample sites. County level data on the SARSCoV-2 infection rates of black and white individuals in each county were collected. The ratio of
green spaces by land-cover type at the county level was calculated from satellite imagery. An
ecological hierarchical regression analysis measured cross-sectional associations between racial
disparity in infection rates and green spaces, after controlling for socioeconomic, demographic,
pre-existing chronic disease, and built-up area factors. We found significantly higher infection
rate among black individuals compared to white individuals. More importantly, a higher ratio of
green spaces at the county level is significantly associated with a lower racial disparity in the
SARS-CoV-2 infection rate. Further, we identified four green space factors that have significant
negative associations with the racial disparity in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates, including open
space in developed areas, forest, shrub and scrub, and grassland and herbaceous. We suggest that
green spaces are an equalizing salutogenic factor, modifying infection exposure.

Introduction
Racial disparity in health is a significant problem in many countries and can lead to social conflicts,
economic crises, and loss of life1, 2. The black–white health disparity in the United States is a
representative example in developed economies and is unsurprisingly manifest in the ongoing
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic3, 4, 5, 6. COVID-19 results from infection with
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the SARS-CoV-2 infection
rate in black individuals is significantly higher, proportionally, than that in white individuals4, 7, 8.
Although studies of the COVID-19 pandemic are quickly accumulating, only a small portion have
examined racial disparity in infection rates9, 10, 11, 12. Most of these studies focused on relationships
between socioeconomic, demographic, or pre-existing chronic disease factors and racial disparity
in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates 4, 13, 14. None of the studies have directly examined effects of urban
environmental factors. Evidence suggests that green spaces may have positive and independent
effects on reducing the racial disparity in various long-term health outcomes 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. Yet,
to our knowledge, there is no evidence to support green space’s effect on reducing racial disparity
in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates. This lack of knowledge may mean missing opportunities to slow
down the COVID-19 pandemic, and to moderate future epidemics by through urban greening. Our
nationwide study is an initial ecological cross-sectional study aiming to establish a county-level
relationship between black–white racial disparity in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates and the amount
and type of green spaces in the United States.
A new trend: Significant environmental effects on racial disparity in health
Many studies have explored potential mechanisms that maintain and exacerbate general racial
disparity in health outcomes to identify effective policies to address such inequities. Much of the
racial disparity seems to be influenced by differences in socioeconomic, demographic, and preexisting chronic disease factors3, 4, 14. Still, disparities remain significant after controlling for these
factors. For example, the life expectancies of higher socioeconomic status (SES) black and white
individuals are 7.1 and 6.8 years longer, respectively, than those of their lower SES counterparts22,
23

. Life expectancy of black people is at least three years less than that of white people with a

comparable income level, at every level of income23. Racial disparity is also pronounced in birth
outcomes; for example, the infant mortality rate for college-educated black women is 2.5 times

higher than that for college-educated white women23, 24. These studies suggest that persistent racial
health disparities are due, in part, to other types of systemic disparities between races.
After controlling for SES factors, an under-studied reason for racial disparity in health outcomes
is built environment disparity 25. People of different races, especially black and white people in
the USA, have lived in neighborhoods with distinct environmental qualities26. Neighborhoods that
are the long-term home of more black people have, on average, fewer green spaces for physical
activity, lower accessibility to healthy food, and lower traffic or crime-related safety27, 28, 29, 30.
These findings have prompted studies in new directions. Researchers across disciplines have
shifted from investigating exclusively social, economic, and educational interventions, and are
now also investigating physical environmental interventions as a means to alleviate persistent
racial-disparities19, 29, 31.
Positive effects of green spaces on human health
The significantly positive effects that green spaces have on human health have drawn considerable
attention from researchers, public health professionals, and governmental officers over the past
decades. A growing number of studies have measured these effects at the regional19, 32, municipal33,
neighborhood34, and property-site35 levels. Consensus has emerged that green spaces can influence
human health through five major pathways36, namely attention restoration37, stress reduction38, 39,
enhanced social cohesion and social capital40, increased physical activity41, and supply of
ecological products and services42, 43, 44. These pathways have been demonstrated across different
geographic, social, and cultural contexts45, 46, 47.
Green spaces reduce racial disparity in health: Circumstantial evidence and knowledge gaps
One line of research might be highly relevant to racial disparity in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates:
green spaces can mitigate health disparities among populations with distinctively different SESs.
A series of observational and survey studies found that a greater amount of green space in public
housing communities was significantly correlated with a higher level of self-discipline48, a lower
level of mental fatigue49, 50, a higher level of social activity and cohesion51, and a lower level of
stress and aggressive behavior52 in residents. A nationwide study in the UK revealed that the
association between income level and all-cause mortality and circulatory disease mortality at the
neighborhood level can be moderated by the amount of green space in a neighborhood19. The study

suggested that more exposure to green space can reduce the health disparity caused by income
disparity. The supply of public green spaces can reduce health disadvantages due to obesity and
obesity-related illnesses in residents of low SES, by encouraging physical exercise21. Some
citywide experimental studies found that the supply of green open space in low-income
neighborhoods can significantly reduce crime, violence, stress, and fear, and increase daily
exercise in those neighborhoods53, 54.
Many of these studies have examined the relationships between the supply of green spaces and
health disparities in long-term health between populations with distinctively different SESs55, 56.
While SES disparity is relevant to racial disparity, it is not fully representative of it57. Furthermore,
the potential for exposure to green spaces to attenuate racial disparity in the risk of infection by
airborne viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, has not been investigated. This is a critical knowledge gap
that may limit our opportunities to moderate the current pandemic and epidemics in the future.
Hypothesis
We hypothesized that the black–white racial disparity in the USA’s SARS-CoV-2 infection rates
is significantly less in urbanized counties with a higher ratio of various types of green spaces.
Methods
Study design
We compared the black–white disparity in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in populations living in
urbanized counties of the United States that have different amounts of green spaces, while
adjusting for potential confounding factors of these counties. The infection data were retrieved on
July 10, 2020. We adopted a within-subject (within-county) research design with a representative
sample across the country. Black–white disparity was measured as the difference in the infection
rate of black and white individuals in the same county. This allowed us to largely remove the bias
caused by between-subject (between-county) factors that may lead to the uneven spread of SARSCoV-2 in different counties, such as the distance to COVID-19 epicenters, climate, or local
government policies. The study is cross-sectional in the sense that it does not analyze across time
and ecological in the sense that it uses data aggregated at spatial unit of analysis (county).

The United States is among the countries most severely impacted by COVID-19. It also has severe
black–white racial inequalities in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates. Our study used counties as the
basic unit of analysis, which are the fundamental administrative unit in the United States. There
are a total of 3,142 counties or county-equivalent areas in the United States.
The most urbanized counties were chosen because we assumed that the racial inequality in the
SARS-CoV-2 infection rates is more pronounced in denser urban environments. First, we
identified a list of 314 large cities with a population ≥ 100,000 in 2019. Second, we identified a
total of 229 counties containing or overlapping these large cities. Third, counties without infection
data for black and white people were excluded. A total of 135 counties were chosen as our study
areas. The total population in these counties was 132,350,027, which comprised 40.3% of the total
population in the United States. The large population size in our study areas ensures the
generalizability of potential findings. We chose counties rather than cities as the unit of analysis
because the infection data for black and white individuals were often unavailable at the city level.
SARS-CoV-2 infection rates
The infection data were collected from the county health department portals on July 10, 2020.
Only SARS-CoV-2 infections in black and white individuals were collected in this study. We
calculated the SARS-CoV-2 infection rates for black and white people (numbers of cases per 100k)
based on the total white and black populations in each county, respectively, which were retrieved
from the 2019 census data58. The racial disparity in the SARS-CoV-2 infection rates was calculated
as the difference between the infection rate in black individuals and the infection rate in white
individuals in the same county.
Green spaces
We used three datasets to assess green spaces, namely the National Land Cover Datasets in 2016
(NLCD 2016), the Tree Canopy Cover Datasets of the United States Forest Service (USFS), and
NDVI.
The NLCD 2016 provides spatially explicit and reliable information on the national land-cover
classification based on Landsat imagery at 30-meter resolution59. The overall agreement ranges
from 71% to 97% between different land-cover classifications and reference data59. The NLCD
2016 has 16 types of land covers. We considered the following land-cover types with dominant

natural elements: developed open space, deciduous forest, evergreen forest, mixed forest, shrub
and scrub, grassland and herbaceous, pasture and hay, cultivated crops, woody wetlands, and
emergent herbaceous wetlands (Appendix Table 2). Deciduous/evergreen/mixed forest were
combined into a new land-cover denoted “forest”. The ratio of these green spaces over the total
county area in each county was calculated.
The Tree Canopy Cover Dataset was derived from the NLCD by the USFS. It provides
estimates of the percent tree canopy cover at 30-meter resolution. We aggregated the total treecanopy cover estimates for each county and then divided it by the county area.
The NDVI is a widely used index that measures the quantity of green vegetation cover at the
pixel level via remote sensing. We obtained the NDVI at a 30-meter resolution from the Google
Earth Engine, which integrates Landsat 8 imagery in its cloud platform60. Four pixel-level average
values were calculated for each county in each month from March to July in 2020, and we finally
obtained the mean of four monthly NDVI values as a proxy for overall green spaces coverage
during the research period.
However, we found that the land-cover dataset had high multicollinearity with two other
measurements of green spaces. For instance, the NDVI and forest land-cover are strongly
correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient: r = 0.64, p < 0.001), as are tree canopy and forest (r =
0.85, p < 0.001). Therefore, we only used measures from the land-cover dataset.
Confounding factors
Previous studies have shown that demographic and socioeconomic characteristics are important
predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk or racial disparity in this risk1, 2, 61. From the 2019 census
data, we obtained the population density, the female population ratio, the difference in black–white
population, the difference in black–white older adults, household size, housing value, the rate of
high school graduates or higher, the rate of households with broadband, median household income,
the poverty rate, healthcare receipts data, travel time to work, the employment rate, and the number
of firms for our study areas (Appendix Table 1)58, 62.
Pre-existing chronic disease is another indispensable dimension that might be connected with
the racial disparity in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates61. Thus, county-level pre-existing chronic
disease factors were collected from the 2016–2018 interactive heart disease and stroke data
collated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention63. The pre-existing chronic disease

factors that we used were the coronary heart disease death rate, the heart failure death rate, the
diagnosed diabetes rate, and the obesity rate for each county (Appendix Table 1).
In addition, land-cover types of dominant built-up area were considered because they represent
the level of urbanity of each county. Three land-cover types of built-up area from NLCD 2016
were included: developed low intensity, developed medium intensity, and developed high intensity
(See detailed definitions in the Appendix Table 2). The ratio of these built-up areas over the total
county area in each county was calculated as the same way that we calculated the ratio of green
spaces in each county.
All confounding factors were represented by proportional variables (e.g., per 100 k, density,
ratio, and median value) or the difference between black and white individuals at the county level.
Therefore, they were consistent with the dependent variable.
Statistical analysis
Three statistical analysis steps were performed. First, a paired t-test was used to examine whether
there was a significant difference between SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in black and white people
in the same county. Second, a variance inflation factor (VIF) test was used to remove potential
multicollinearity among the independent variables. We adopted the threshold value of VIF = 4 64.
All of the factors with a VIF ≥ 4 were excluded from our models (Appendix Tables 1 & 2).
Third, hierarchical linear-regression models were used to examine the associations between the
black–white difference in the SARS-CoV-2 infection rates and green space factors, while
controlling for other confounding factors. The first model (Model 1) included the socioeconomic
and demographic factors only. The second model (Model 2) additionally included pre-existing
chronic disease factors. The last model (Model 3) additionally included green space factors, on the
basis of Model 2.
All of the analyses were performed using R v4.0.265. The model R2 values, adjusted R2 values,
standardized coefficient (β) values, 95% confidence intervals, and p-values were reported.
Results
Results are presented in three sections. First, we present the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections
in the sample of 135 most urbanized counties in the United States and examine the extent to which
there are differences in infection rates among black and white populations. Second, we report

demographic and green space characteristics of the sampled counties. Third, we employ
hierarchical linear modeling to examine the extent to which, after controlling for socioeconomic,
demographic, pre-existing chronic disease, and built-up area factors, the ratio of green spaces are
associated with black-white disparities in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates. Finally, we report four
green space factors that have significant negative associations with the racial disparity in SARSCoV-2 infection rates.
Does a racial disparity in infection rates exist?
As of July 10, 2020, there were a total of 1,425,461 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the 135
most urbanized counties in the United States, which accounted for 47% of the total cases of
infection (3,038,325) in the United States (Figure 1). The 135 most urbanized counties were
selected because they contain or overlap with 314 large cities with a population ≥ 100,000 in 2019
(see details in Methods). The county-level average infection rate for white individuals was 497
persons per 100,000 population, whereas the infection rate for black individuals was
approximately twice this (988 persons per 100,000 population) (Figure 1 & Table 1). The average
black–white difference in the infection rate was 447 persons per 100,000 population. White
individuals had a higher infection rate than did black individuals in only 11 out of the 135 counties
(Figure 2). As expected, a paired t-test revealed that the difference infection rates between black
and white people is significant, with t (134) = 12.757 and p < 0.001 (Figure 3).

Characteristics of the sampled counties
Table 1 shows that there are proportionally more white than black people in the study areas, which
is consistent with the overall racial composition in the United States. The sample includes an
average of 2.6 persons per household and a notably large range in median household income across
counties. In terms of the green space factors, the sample includes a high quantity of developed
open space and forest cover (Figure 4), and low levels of shrub and scrub, and grassland and
herbaceous cover. Figure 4 shows the ratio of four types of green space in each county.

Modeling association of green spaces and infection disparity
By fitting three hierarchical regression models, we identify three relevant associations (Table 2).
Model 1 shows that socioeconomic and demographic factors have a significant association with
racial disparity in the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate across the USA’s 135 most urbanized counties
(adjusted 𝑅 2 of 0.12, p = 0.003). We also note that there is a significantly negative association
between household size and racial disparity in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates, such that as average
household size increases, infection disparity falls.
After adding pre-existing chronic disease factors into Model 2, the explanatory power of Model
2 slightly decreases (adjusted 𝑅 2 = 0.11, p = 0.007). Model 2 shows that the combination of
socioeconomic, demographic, and pre-existing chronic disease factors is associated with racial
disparity. However, the overall statistical significance of Model 2 was not substantially better than
that of Model l (p = 0.430 for the sum-of-squares difference).

After adding green space factors into Model 3, the overall explanatory power of Model 3
increased by 18% (adjusted 𝑅 2 = 0.29, p < 0.001). Model 3 reveals that four green space factors
are independently negatively associated with racial disparity. These are: land-cover ratio of
developed open space; forest; shrub and scrub; and grassland and herbaceous. In addition,
household size is negatively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection rate disparity between races,
while death from heart failure rate is positively associated with it.

Discussion
Significant associations between socioeconomic, demographic, and pre-existing chronic disease
factors and the racial disparity in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates have been reported by a number of
ecological studies3, 4, 5, 13, 14. Some urban environmental factors, such as overcrowding housing
conditions, living in senior living communities, living in high-density urban areas, and a long
commute distance, are associated with a greater racial disparity in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates 67,

68, 69, 70, 71

. However, no study examined the relationship between green spaces and racial disparity

in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates.
In this study of the 135 urbanized counties in the United States, we found a large and statistically
significant disparity in infection rates of the SARS-CoV-2 virus for black and white populations.
Using hierarchical linear modelling, we found that the combination of socioeconomic,
demographic, and pre-existing chronic disease conditions explained about 11% of variance in
racial disparity. Adding green spaces explained an additional 18% of the variance. Four types of
green spaces were significantly, negatively associated with the racial disparity in SARS-CoV-2
infection: open space in developed areas, forest, shrub and scrub, and grassland and herbaceous.
In the paragraphs that follow, we consider possible mechanisms through which greater amounts
of green spaces within a county might contribute to a reduction in racial disparity in SARS-CoV2 infection rates. The plausible mechanisms are supported by theoretical and empirical evidence.
We elaborate the contributions of our findings and identify questions for future research. We
believe this is the first study to find that green space factors have significant independent effects
on the racial disparity in COVID-19 infection rates, albeit using an ecological study design.
Interpretation of key findings
There is growing evidence that the dominant pathway for transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus
is through aerosol particles 72, 73, 74 That is, the primary route of transmission is via virus-containing
droplets and aerosols exhaled from infected individuals as they breathe, speak, sing, cough, or
sneeze. In indoor settings that lack adequate ventilation, the virus can concentrate in the air, which
facilitates its spread. Outdoors, however, because of air movement, and the ease of social
distancing, there is a far reduced likelihood of contracting the virus 75.
In this study, we found, after controlling for socioeconomic, demographic, pre-exisiting chronic
disease, and built-up area factors, that greater proportions of forest, shrub and scrub, grassland,
and herbaceous landscapes were each significantly, negatively correlated with the size of
discrepancy in black-white infection rates. In urban counties with more green spaces available, the
racial disparity in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates was lower than in counties that had less available
green space.
How might we account for the findings reported here? We propose four mechanisms that may
account for the observed relationships. First, and perhaps most likely, is that green spaces are

17

socio-pedal – that is, they draw people outdoors. A study in Chicago found that individuals using
spaces immediately outside apartment buildings were much more likely to be in relatively green
spaces than in relatively barren spaces

76

. A follow-up study of outdoor urban spaces found on

average 90% more people used green than barren neighborhood spaces 77. Another study reported
that urban residents dislike and fear urban neighborhood spaces when they are devoid of vegetation,
but that the simple addition of trees and grass was sufficient to transform outdoor common spaces
from a space they liked not at all, to a space they liked quite a lot or very much 78.
These findings suggest that green neighborhood spaces attract people outdoors. Being outdoors
reduces the spread of the virus through two pathways. First, outdoor air movement disperses the
virus to levels that are nearly impossible to detect. Second, being outdoors makes it easier than
indoors to maintain safe social distance75. To the extent that black individuals have
disproportionately less access to green spaces that their white counterparts27, 28, 29, 30, simply having
access to green spaces that pull people outdoors is likely to reduce the racial disparity in infections
rates we reported above.
Second, counties with larger portions of green space provided greater access to residents of all
racial groups and promoted physical activity before and during the pandemic21. This may have
enhanced county residents’ immune system regardless of race and moderated factors behind racebased infection disparities79,

80, 81

. Physical activity conducted in nature provides additional

benefits compared with physical activity conducted in indoor environments82, 83, 84. Here again, the
disproportionate access to green spaces that many black people live with is likely to explain some
of the relationships reported above. Black individuals who have access to open green spaces may
accrue health benefits from conducting physical activity in these green spaces, and therefore
potentially have lower infection rates compared to black people who cannot access open green
spaces.
Third, proportionately more green spaces in a county may result in enhanced mental47 and social
health48 regardless of race before and during the pandemic52, thus providing multiple benefits that
moderate risks that would otherwise fall more heavily on black communities. It is good evidence
that, overall, being black in America places heavier stress burdens on individuals than being white,
and this distinction may be especially profound during the pandemic18, 19, 20, 21. Visual or physical
contact with urban green spaces can reduce mental fatigue50, 85 86, reduce mental stress35, 87, 88, 89,
and enhance self-discipline48 at the individual level. Such exposure to nature can also reduce

negative moods90, 91 and verbal and behavioral aggressiveness49, which can lead to enhance trust51,
92

and collaboration93. Taken together, these benefits of exposure to nature can promote immune

system function45 which may be protective against contracting the virus.
Finally, more green spaces may decrease the SARS-CoV-2 infection risk by improving air
quality and decreasing exposure to air pollutants (e.g., PM2.5) that are associated with higher
SARS-CoV-2 infection rates94, 95. Black households tend to be found in higher density, more
polluted streets, compared with white households27, 28, 29, 30. Thus, the supply of green spaces would
be of greater relative benefit to black, rather than white, populations. Studies have shown that air
quality in high-density residential areas in urban neighborhoods is significantly worse than that in
suburban and rural residential areas96. A greater supply of green spaces, especially in urban centers,
may reduce this significant environmental disparity17, 19, thereby contributing to a lower racial
disparity in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates. We note, however, that relying on urban green spaces is
not sufficient to create healthy air environments97 for the entire urban region. Providing large-scale
green spaces beyond the urban core is critical to achieving this goal98.
In sum, greater amounts of green spaces may have a stronger health impacts on black
individuals and households compared to white individuals and households. This, we suggest, is a
crucial mechanism explaining our regression findings. Other things being equal, an increase in the
quantity or accessibility of green spaces in an urban area might be expected to have an equal effect
on black and white individuals99, 100. Black households, however, are less likely to have access
green spaces than white households. Thus, the marginal health benefits to black households
resulting from more green spaces, will be greater than for whites.
Contributions and implications
This study makes theoretical and practical contributions, which hope will influence future research,
policymaking, and urban design.
First, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to measure whether and to what extent
green spaces within and beyond developed urban areas are associated with racial disparities in
rates of contagious disease infection. Although a few studies have identified some built
environment factors, such as crowded living conditions, staying in senior living communities, and
dense urban areas, are related to racial disparity in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates67, 68, 70, 71, none
have addressed green spaces.

Second, we adopted a within-subject research design with a standard spatial sampling unit
across the country, giving a representative study for USA urban counties. In contrast with previous
studies on COVID-19 that examined associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection rate or COVID19 mortality rate across counties or cities10, 101, 102, our study focused on comparing difference in
SARS-CoV-2 infection rates among white and black people in the same county. By comparing
racial disparity in infection rates within each county we obtain greater statistical validity, as this
approach mitigates bias caused by uneven spread of infections across counties due to differences
in national road network accessibility, airports and railway connectivity, governmental regulations,
social norms, and quantity and quality of healthcare services.
Third, our study suggests that green space, as a type of urban infrastructure103, should be
considered a relevant intervention to reduce the racial disparity of infectious diseases with
characteristics similar to the current pandemic. Providing an adequate supply of accessible and
well-designed green spaces in urban areas, and preserving and developing natural green spaces
across counties, is part of an epidemic and pandemic-resilience strategy for highly urbanized areas.
Considering that urban and agricultural areas are rapidly encroaching on forest, grassland, and
many other natural landscapes inside and/or outside cities worldwide104, 105, it is crucial to maintain
and increase efforts to preserve scarce urban green spaces. As well as achieving environmental
goals, we show that this approach can also be expected to help deliver health and racial equality
agenda.
Limitations and opportunities for future research
This study has some limitations that point to opportunities for future research.
We collected SARS-CoV-2 infection data from county government websites of each of the 135
counties we examined. The quality of data is credible for each county, but the methods of collecting
and sorting data clearly varied across counties. Moreover, although there are 229 counties
containing or overlapping all cities with a population ≥ 100,000 in the United States, infection data
were unavailable for 94 of these counties, leaving a set of high-quality data from 135 counties.
This study only examined racial disparities in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in the US at the
county level. Although the racial disparity in infection rates in the United States might be a good
example for countries with diverse racial populations6, 9, 106, we suggest that this research should

be replicated in other countries, to fully determine the complex issue of racial disparity in infection
rates in relation to environmental exposure and pandemic dynamics.
This study provides a base-line analysis of green spaces and racial disparity in pandemic
infections. It is limited by the normal constraints of a cross-sectional, ecological design. Crosssectional associations do not imply causality and we cannot avoid the possibility of ecological
fallacy. These are possibilities that can be investigated in further studies. Nevertheless, results from
this study echo findings of many published papers that reported causal links between more green
spaces, better health status and lower health disparities.
Finally, a caveat can be raised with respect to possible ecological bias. The access to data in
SARS-CoV-2 infection rates at the neighborhood scale was not available, which prevented us from
examining the distribution of green spaces for races at the neighborhood scale. It is possible an
unequal allocation of green spaces could lead to races’ unequal exposures to green spaces, which
needs to be further examined in a future study at a finer spatial scale. Two arguments remain
reasonable albeit the possibility of that bias. First, more green space leads to greater marginal
health benefits for black individuals than white individuals and thus a smaller racial disparity in
SARS-CoV-2 infection rates. Second, large patches of natural green spaces outside the city, such
as forest and natural grassland and herbaceous lands, can improve the environmental quality of an
entire urban area thereby reducing the racial disparity in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates. Future
studies should further examine these possibilities.
Conclusion
This study is an initial effort to understand the relationships between environmental factors and
racial disparity in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates. We employed hierarchical regression analysis to
perform within-county comparisons of infection rates for black and white individuals. After
controlling for socioeconomic, demographic, pre-existing chronic disease, and built-up area
factors, we found that greater proportions of forest, shrub and scrub, grassland, and herbaceous
landscapes were each significantly, negatively correlated with the size of discrepancy in blackwhite infection rates. In urban counties with more green spaces, the racial disparity in SARS-CoV2 infection rates was lower than in counties that had less green space. The findings suggest that
the supply of open green space in urban areas and natural green spaces across a county may help

Areas with a mixture of constructed materials and vegetation. Impervious surfaces account for
20% to 49% percent of total cover. These areas most commonly include single-family housing
units.
Areas with a mixture of constructed materials and vegetation. Impervious surfaces account for
50% to 79% of the total cover. These areas most commonly include single-family housing units.
Highly developed areas where people reside or work in high numbers. Examples include
apartment complexes, row houses and commercial/industrial. Impervious surfaces account for
80% to 100% of the total cover.
Areas with a mixture of some constructed materials, but mostly vegetation in the form of lawn
grasses. Impervious surfaces account for less than 20% of total cover. These areas most
commonly include large-lot single-family housing units, parks, golf courses, and vegetation
planted in developed settings for recreation, erosion control, or aesthetic purposes.
Areas dominated by trees generally greater than 5 meters tall, and greater than 20% of total
vegetation cover. More than 75% of the tree species shed foliage simultaneously in response to
seasonal change.
Areas dominated by trees generally greater than 5 meters tall, and greater than 20% of total
vegetation cover. More than 75% of the tree species maintain their leaves all year. Canopy is
never without green foliage.
Areas dominated by trees generally greater than 5 meters tall, and greater than 20% of total
vegetation cover. Neither deciduous nor evergreen species are greater than 75% of total tree
cover.
Combination of deciduous, evergreen, and mixed forest.
Areas dominated by shrubs; less than 5 meters tall with shrub canopy typically greater than 20%
of total vegetation. This class includes true shrubs, young trees in an early successional stage or
trees stunted from environmental conditions.
Areas dominated by gramanoid or herbaceous vegetation, generally greater than 80% of total
vegetation. These areas are not subject to intensive management such as tilling, but can be
utilized for grazing.
Areas of grasses, legumes, or grass-legume mixtures planted for livestock grazing or the
production of seed or hay crops, typically on a perennial cycle. Pasture/hay vegetation accounts
for greater than 20% of total vegetation.
Areas used for the production of annual crops, such as corn, soybeans, vegetables, tobacco, and
cotton, and also perennial woody crops such as orchards and vineyards. Crop vegetation
accounts for greater than 20% of total vegetation. This class also includes all land being actively
tilled.
Areas where forest or shrubland vegetation accounts for greater than 20% of vegetative cover
and the soil or substrate is periodically saturated with or covered with water.
Areas where perennial herbaceous vegetation accounts for greater than 80% of vegetative cover
and the soil or substrate is periodically saturated with or covered with water.
