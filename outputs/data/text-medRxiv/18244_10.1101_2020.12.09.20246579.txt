Abstract
Importance. Deaths among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are partially
attributed to venous thromboembolism and arterial thromboses. Anticoagulants prevent
thrombosis formation, possess anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties, and may be
particularly effective for treating patients with COVID-19.
Objective. To evaluate whether initiation of prophylactic anticoagulation within 24 hours of
admission is associated with decreased risk of death among patients hospitalized with COVID19.
Design. Observational cohort study.
Setting. Nationwide cohort of patients receiving care in the Department of Veterans Affairs, the
largest integrated healthcare system in the United States.
Participants. All patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection March 1
to July 31, 2020, without a history of therapeutic anticoagulation.
Exposures. Prophylactic doses of subcutaneous heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, or
direct oral anticoagulants.
Main Outcomes and Measures. 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes: inpatient mortality and
initiating therapeutic anticoagulation.
Results. Of 4,297 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 3,627 (84.4%) received prophylactic
anticoagulation within 24 hours of admission. More than 99% (n=3,600) received subcutaneous
heparin or enoxaparin. We observed 622 deaths within 30 days of admission, 513 among those
who received prophylactic anticoagulation. Most deaths (510/622, 82%) occurred during
hospitalization. In inverse probability of treatment weighted analyses, cumulative adjusted
incidence of mortality at 30 days was 14.3% (95% CI 13.1-15.5) among those receiving
prophylactic anticoagulation and 18.7% (95% CI 15.1-22.9) among those who did not.
Compared to patients who did not receive prophylactic anticoagulation, those who did had a
27% decreased risk for 30-day mortality (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.66-0.81). Similar associations were
found for inpatient mortality and initiating therapeutic anticoagulation. Quantitative bias analysis
demonstrated that results were robust to unmeasured confounding (e-value lower 95% CI 1.77).
Results persisted in a number of sensitivity analyses.
Conclusions and Relevance. Early initiation of prophylactic anticoagulation among patients
hospitalized with COVID-19 was associated with a decreased risk of mortality. These findings
provide strong real-world evidence to support guidelines recommending the use of prophylactic
anticoagulation as initial therapy for COVID-19 patients upon hospital admission.

Background
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), continues to spread worldwide. Deaths among
individuals with COVID-19 have been partially attributed to venous thromboembolism and
arterial thromboses.1,2 In intensive care settings, prevalence of venous thromboembolism
among patients with COVID-19 has been reported to be over 40%.3 In response, several expert
organizations including the American Society of Hematology, the International Society on
Thrombosis and Haemostasis, and the CHEST Guideline and Expert Panel have recommended
the use of prophylactic anticoagulation for patients admitted with COVID-19 who do not have a
contraindication to this therapy.1,4,5
The most commonly used anticoagulants in hospital settings are heparin-based. Given these
drugs also possess anti-inflammatory properties,6–8 heparin-based therapies may be particularly
effective in treating patients with COVID-19.9 Evaluations of the efficacy of prophylactic
anticoagulation in COVID-19 patients in randomized clinical trials are underway but yet to be
reported.10 Previous observational cohort studies have shown evidence that use of
anticoagulation in COVID-19 patients was associated with decreased risk of mortality;11,12
however, these studies were limited in sample size or relatively small healthcare systems. Our
objective was to estimate the effect of early initiation of prophylactic anticoagulation on the risk
of 30-day mortality among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the largest integrated
healthcare system in the United States.

Methods
Study design and population
We conducted an observational cohort study using electronic health record (EHR) data from the
US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which comprises over 1,200 points of care nationwide
including hospitals, medical centers, and community outpatient clinics. All care is recorded in an
EHR with daily uploads into the VA Corporate Data Warehouse. Available data include
demographics, outpatient and inpatient encounters, diagnoses, procedures, smoking and
alcohol health behaviors, pharmacy dispensing records, vital signs, laboratory measures, and
death information.
We included all patients hospitalized between March 1 and July 31, 2020 who had a laboratoryconfirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 test result on or within 14 days prior to hospital admission. We
excluded patients who had no history of care (defined as at least one outpatient or inpatient
encounter in the two years prior to March 1, 2020), received therapeutic anticoagulation in the
30 days prior to hospital admission (to mitigate the effect of prevalent use of anticoagulation),
received a red blood cell transfusion with 24 hours of admission (as active bleeding or severe
anemia may have been a contraindication for anticoagulation), or experienced any of the
primary outcomes (i.e., died or initiated therapeutic anticoagulation) within 24 hours of
admission and therefore did not have equal chance to be classified as exposed in this study.

Forms and doses of anticoagulation
We extracted inpatient pharmacy records for warfarin, intravenous heparin, low-molecularweight heparin (LMWH; i.e., enoxaparin, fondaparinux, dalteparin), and direct oral
anticoagulants (DOAC; i.e., apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran). Doses and routes considered
prophylactic anticoagulation are listed in Box 1. Any dose higher than these levels, in addition to
warfarin at any dose, were considered therapeutic anticoagulation.

Exposure, outcomes, and follow-up
The exposure of interest was receipt of prophylactic anticoagulation in the first 24 hours of
hospitalization compared to no receipt of prophylactic anticoagulation in the same time frame.
Primary outcome was mortality within 30 days of hospital admission (“30-day mortality”), which
included in-hospital deaths as well as those that occurred after discharge. Secondary outcomes
were inpatient mortality and initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation. Algorithms to identify
thromboembolic events during hospitalizations of COVID-19 patients have yet to be validated;
thus, we considered initiation of therapeutic levels of anticoagulation after the first 24 hours of
admission a proxy for a thromboembolic event. For all outcomes, we followed patients from date
of hospital admission until earliest of date of outcome or a maximum of 30 days.
Some VA hospitals report observation periods and admissions separately, even when a patient
has not moved beds or changed providers. We combined these periods and considered a full
hospitalization to begin at first presentation in a VA hospital and end when there was not a
subsequent “stay” that began within 24 hours. Study design is depicted in Figure 1.
Covariates
Potential confounders in the relationship between receipt of anticoagulation and COVID-19
mortality or thromboembolic events were identified by reviewing existing literature and through
discussions with clinicians. We extracted information on age, race/ethnicity, sex, urban/rural
residence, US Census region, clinical comorbidities, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and
substance use. Presence of clinical comorbidities was determined by one inpatient or two
outpatient diagnoses using International Classification of Diseases - 9th or 10th edition (ICD9/10) codes in the two years prior to hospitalization, except for cancer, which was considered
4

present if diagnosed ever prior to hospitalization. Level of alcohol consumption was calculated
using the most recent Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test - Consumption (AUDIT-C)13
measure within two years prior to admission. Smoking status was determined by the most
frequent response in the five years prior to hospitalization.14
We ascertained medication history in the 15 to 90 days prior to hospitalization. We captured
vital signs and laboratory measures to account for acute health status at hospital admission.
Height and weight measurements closest to hospitalization within five and two years,
respectively, prior to admission were used to calculate body mass index. All other vital signs
and all laboratory measures utilized the value closest to hospitalization within 14 days prior to
admission. Further details on covariate ascertainment windows are depicted in Figure 1.

Notes: End of follow-up for all outcomes was earliest of: date of outcome, a maximum of 30 days, or August 30, 2020. For the analysis of inpatient mortality and
initiating therapeutic anticoagulation, we further censored patients at date of hospital discharge.

To account for potential effects of co-medications with other COVID-19 treatments, we
ascertained receipt of oral or intravenous dexamethasone15 at any dose or intravenous
remdesivir16 at any dose within the first 24 hours of hospitalization as well as treatments
received after the first 24 hours.
Covariates with the largest proportion of missing data included alanine aminotransferase
(13.5%), aspartate aminotransferase (15.2%), lymphocyte count (15.0%), and total cholesterol
(14.1%): all other covariates had <10% missing.

Propensity score model
We used inverse probability of treatment (IPT) weighting to estimate the marginal treatment
effect. We first modeled the probability of receiving the exposure of interest as a function of all
measured covariates (apart from in-hospital treatments received after the first 24 hours so as to
not use future information at baseline).17 Propensity scores (i.e., the predicted probability of
exposure) were estimated using a multivariable logistic regression model. We included a
missing category for covariates with missing data. The area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve was 0.74. Each patient was weighted by the inverse probability of receiving
the exposure of interest, with the goal of balancing observable characteristics between
treatment groups. After IPT weighting, the distribution of propensity scores between the
treatment groups overlapped nearly perfectly (eFigure 1). We calculated absolute standardized
mean differences between treatment groups and considered ≤0.2 as balanced,18 although the
vast majority were ≤0.1 (eFigure 2). Thus, the weighting produced treatment groups that were
considered well balanced.
Statistical methods
Covariates were summarized using descriptive statistics, stratified by treatment group. We
generated IPT-weighted Kaplan Meier plots. We used Cox regression models with days since
hospital admission as the timescale to estimate IPT-weighted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) for the effect of early initiation of prophylactic doses of anticoagulation
on 30-day mortality, inpatient mortality, and initiating therapeutic anticoagulation. Both
secondary outcomes occur during hospitalization, wherein discharge from hospital was
considered a competing event. If patients were censored at discharge, absolute risks derived
from Kaplan-Meier analyses would be overestimated.19,20 We therefore displayed cumulative
adjusted incidence rates by treatment group treating discharge as a competing event (i.e., no
censoring at date of discharge). We nonetheless chose to display cause-specific rather than
sub-distribution hazard ratios as our question was etiological in nature.21 These cause-specific
hazard ratios were interpreted as the effect of prophylactic anticoagulation on each of the
outcomes irrespective of its effect on discharge. Proportional hazards were checked by
examining the complementary log-log (or the log of negative log) of estimated survivor functions
for exposed and unexposed groups versus the log of survival time. There was no evidence of
proportional hazards violations.
Sensitivity analyses
For each outcome, we used quantitative bias analysis to calculate an e-value, which
demonstrates the strength of association between an unmeasured confounder and exposure or
outcome, conditional on measured covariates, that would be necessary to fully explain observed
effects.22 To assess for undue effects from outliers with very high or very low estimated
propensity of treatment, we capped propensity score distributions at the 1st/99th and again at the
5th/95th percentiles. To account for potentially biased estimation of standard errors or influence
from very high or very low weights, we performed sensitivity analyses using combinations of
robust standard error estimation23 and stabilized weighting.24 We re-ran the primary analyses
extending the exposure ascertainment window from 24 to 48 hours. Given the low frequency of
DOAC use in the cohort, we re-ran analyses excluding DOACs from the exposure definition. In

6

post-hoc analyses, we assessed the effect of prophylactic anticoagulation separately by the two
most commonly prescribed drugs in the cohort, heparin and enoxaparin. We used Microsoft
SQL Server Management Studio v17.4 for data management and SAS version 9.4 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC, US) and Stata 16 MP for statistical analyses.

In this cohort, 3,627 (84.4%) patients received prophylactic anticoagulation within the first 24
hours of hospital admission. Among those who received prophylactic anticoagulation, the most
11

common drugs were heparin-based: either subcutaneous heparin (n=1,094, 30.2%) or
enoxaparin (n=2,506, 69.1%; Box 1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
At hospital presentation, the group of patients who received prophylactic anticoagulation,
compared to the group of patients who did not, had a higher proportion with an oxygen
saturation level less than 93% (Table 1; 16.0% versus 10.3%), heart rate at 90 beats per minute
or above (39.2% versus 34.5%), and temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or above (17.5%
versus 10.6%). In contrast, the burden of prevalent comorbid disease (Charlson Comorbidity
Index ≥5) was lower among those who received prophylactic anticoagulation as compared to
those that did not (21.1% versus 25.1%, respectively). Co-medication with other COVID-19
treatments within the first 24 hours of admission were more common among those who received
prophylactic anticoagulation compared to those who did not (16.2% versus 11.0% for
dexamethasone; 12.0% versus 5.2% for remdesivir). However, after IPT-weighting, differences
were minimized between the two treatment groups (all standardized mean differences ≤0.2 with
vast majority ≤0.1; Table 1).
Absolute and relative risks
There were 622 deaths (622/4297, 14.5%) that occurred within 30 days of hospital admission,
513 among those who received prophylactic anticoagulation (Table 2). Most deaths (510/622,
82%) occurred during hospitalization. In IPT-weighted analyses, cumulative adjusted incidence
of mortality at 30 days was 14.3% (95% CI 13.1-15.5) and 18.7% (95% CI 15.1-22.9) for
patients receiving and not receiving prophylactic anticoagulation, respectively (Table 2). Receipt
of prophylactic anticoagulation was associated with a 27% decreased risk of death over the first
30 days (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.66-0.81; Figure 3) compared to not receiving prophylactic
anticoagulation. Similar associations were found for inpatient mortality (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.610.77) and initiating therapeutic anticoagulation (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.73-0.90).

Sensitivity analyses
Quantitative bias analysis demonstrated that an unmeasured confounder would need to be
strongly associated with receipt of prophylactic anticoagulation and each outcome to explain the
observed associations: e-value lower 95% CI was 1.77 for 30-day mortality, 1.92 for inpatient
mortality, and 1.46 for initiating therapeutic anticoagulation (eFigure 3). Results were robust to
capping propensity scores (eTable 1), using stabilized weighting and robust variance estimation
(eTable 2), extending the exposure window from 24 to 48 hours (eTable 3), and excluding
DOACs from the exposure definition (eTable 4). In post-hoc analyses, the effect of prophylactic
anticoagulation on 30-day mortality was similar when stratified by whether patients received
subcutaneous heparin (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.64-0.84) or enoxaparin (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68-0.89;
eTable 5).

Discussion
Key findings
In a nationwide cohort of 4,297 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the largest integrated
healthcare system in the United States, initiation of predominantly heparin-based prophylactic
anticoagulation within the first 24 hours of admission was associated with a relative risk
reduction of 30-day mortality as high as 34% and an absolute risk reduction of 4.5% in the
context of an absolute risk of 18.7% among patients who did not receive prophylactic
anticoagulation. These results persisted in sensitivity analyses. We observed similar protective
effects for secondary outcomes including inpatient mortality and initiation of therapeutic
anticoagulation - a proxy for the development of a thromboembolic event.
Comparison with other evidence
Previous studies investigating the role of anticoagulation among patients with COVID-19 have
had varied results, but none have reported harm.11,12,25–32 Variations in reported associations
likely derive from different exposure definitions of anticoagulation, both form and dose.
Additionally, different patient populations (e.g., disease-specific cohorts), comparator groups,
and inclusion/exclusion criteria were used. One of the largest observational studies to date by
Nadkarni et al reported that both prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation were associated
with a reduction in inpatient mortality by up to 55% compared to those not receiving
anticoagulation across five New York City hospitals.11 However, the study allowed patients to
switch exposure groups during follow-up without comprehensively accounting for time-updated
confounding by indication that may have impacted results.
Our study was designed to emulate a hypothetical clinical trial in which we excluded prevalent
users of anticoagulation, balanced covariate distribution at hospital admission (analogous to
randomization) and ascertained exposure within 24 hours of admission. We conducted an
intention-to-treat analysis since the data required to account for time-updated exposures and
confounders (e.g., marginal structural modeling) may not be available within acute
hospitalizations. For example, many hospital systems report all diagnoses that occur during a
given hospitalization at discharge. Therefore, we could not determine if initiation of prophylactic
anticoagulation later in hospitalization confers benefit. There are multiple clinical trials in
14

progress to determine dosing and timing for anticoagulation during the clinical course of COVID19.10 Until clinical trial data are available, our results provide strong evidence for the use of
prophylactic anticoagulation as initial therapy for COVID-19 patients upon hospital admission.
Thromboembolic events in the context of COVID-19 are strongly associated with
mortality.3,25,31,33,34 The etiology of heightened thrombosis remains unclear, although proposed
mechanisms have included systemic inflammation, endothelialitis, and activation of the
complement system.35–37 Increases in a variety of inflammatory pathways, including bradykinin,
interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and growth differentiation factor 15, have been described in
COVID-19.8,9,38–47 Further, heparin has been shown to block SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein
binding in experimental studies.48–50 We postulate that the combination of heparin’s known
antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects,6,7 in addition to viral infectivity attenuation may, at
least in part, explain the observed benefit associated with prophylactic anticoagulation.
Strengths and limitations
While this study had many strengths, including the availability of detailed, longitudinal, electronic
health record data on a nationwide cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, rigorous
methodology and findings that were robust to sensitivity analyses, we recognize possible
limitations. First, due to the observational nature of the study, a degree of uncertainty persists
that can only be addressed through randomized trials. Nonetheless, we took several steps to
mitigate potential confounding. We comprehensively accounted for chronic and acute health
conditions at hospital admission in addition to other potential COVID-19 treatments to achieve
balance of these potential confounders between treatment groups. Further, we showed that our
results were robust to unmeasured confounding using quantitative bias analysis, which
demonstrated that a confounder would need to be strongly associated with receipt of
prophylactic anticoagulation and each of the outcomes considered to explain the observed
effects. Second, we did not have available a validated algorithm to identify thromboembolic
events as an outcome. However, the use of therapeutic anticoagulation may occur as a result of
many reported complications of COVID-19 including venous thromboembolism, arterial
thromboembolism, cardiac arrhythmia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.51–58 We
surmised that an intensification of anticoagulation indicated an adverse change in clinical
condition. Third, this study was conducted on Veterans currently receiving care in the VA, who
are older and have a higher prevalence of chronic health conditions and risk behaviors than the
general US population.59–61 However, prior research has established that after adjusting for age,
sex, race/ethnicity, region, and rural/urban residence, all of which were accounted for in this
study, there is no difference in total disease burden between Veterans and non-Veterans.61 Our
key finding has also been shown in non-Veteran populations;11,12 thus, effects reported in this
study are likely generalizable to the wider US population. Fourth, while individuals in VA care
represent a diversity of backgrounds, women represented a small proportion of individuals in the
sample.
Summary
We studied a nationwide cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and found that initiation
of prophylactic, heparin-based anticoagulation within 24 hours of admission was associated with

15

a lower risk of 30-day mortality, in-hospital mortality, and initiation of therapeutic-dose
anticoagulation likely indicative of a thromboembolic event. Our results provide strong real-world
evidence to support guidelines recommending the use of prophylactic anticoagulation as initial
therapy for COVID-19 patients upon hospital admission.
