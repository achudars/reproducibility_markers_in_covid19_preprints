Abstract
Introduction
Rapid antigen tests are convenient for diagnosing severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); however, they have lower sensitivities than nucleic acid
amplification tests. In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of Quick
Chaser® Auto SARS-CoV-2, a novel digital immunochromatographic assay that is
expected to have higher sensitivity than conventional antigen tests.
Methods
A prospective observational study was conducted between February 8 and March 24,
2021. We simultaneously obtained two nasopharyngeal samples, one for evaluation with
the QuickChaser® Auto SARS-CoV-2 antigen test and the other for assessment with
reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), considered the gold-standard reference test. The
limit of detection (LOD) of the new antigen test was compared with those of four other
commercially available rapid antigen tests.
Results
A total of 1401 samples were analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by reference
RT-PCR in 83 (5.9%) samples, of which 36 (43.4%) were collected from symptomatic
patients. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive
value were 74.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 64.0–83.6%), 99.8% (95% CI:
99.5–100%), 96.9% (95% CI: 89.2–99.6%), and 98.4% (95% CI: 97.6–99.0%),
respectively. When limited to samples with a cycle threshold (Ct) <30 or those from
symptomatic patients, the sensitivity increased to 98.3% and 88.9%, respectively. The
QuickChaser® Auto SARS-CoV-2 detected 34–120 copies/test, which indicated greater
sensitivity than the other rapid antigen tests.
Conclusions
QuickChaser® Auto SARS-CoV-2 showed sufficient sensitivity and specificity in
clinical samples of symptomatic patients. The sensitivity was comparable to RT-PCR in
samples with Ct<30.

Introduction
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused
a global pandemic and continues to place an immense burden on healthcare systems [1]
despite the introduction of effective vaccines [2]. Since rapid and accurate testing is a
critical element in containing viral transmission [3], the development of reliable
point-of-care testing is necessary.
Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are the gold standard for diagnosing
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) because of their high diagnostic performance [4].
However, several limitations have reduced their test capacity and clinical utility,
including long processing times and the need for expensive equipment and skilled staff
[3]. By contrast, antigen tests are convenient and have moderate sensitivities and high
specificities [4]. These tests have made it possible to diagnose COVID-19 in
low-resource settings [5], despite the possibility of missing a certain proportion of
infected patients [6]. Therefore, increasing sensitivity should enhance the clinical utility
of antigen tests.
Quick Chaser® Auto SARS-CoV-2 (Mizuho Medy, Saga, Japan) is a new antigen
test based on the silver amplification method. This test uses the same reagent as FUJI
DRY-CHEM IMMUNO AG Cartridge COVID-19 Ag (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan), and is
tailored for digital immuno-chromatographic assays. The test provides results in 15
minutes when used with the QuickChaser Immuno Reader II dedicated reader (Mizuho
Medy). Both the silver amplification method and digital immuno-chromatographic
assays were reported to increase the sensitivity of antigen tests for the influenza virus

[7]. Although Quick Chaser® Auto SARS-CoV-2 is expected to have higher sensitivity
than conventional antigen tests, its diagnostic performance for detecting SARS-CoV-2
has not been evaluated in clinical samples.
In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of Quick Chaser® Auto
SARS-CoV-2 and QuickChaser Immuno Reader II with nasopharyngeal specimens, and
performed comparisons with the reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) method.

Methods
This study was carried out as an extension of our previous research [8] and
followed a similar protocol. The investigation was performed between February 8 and
March 24, 2021, at Tsukuba Medical Center Hospital (TMCH), a tertiary hospital in
Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan. Nasopharyngeal samples and clinical information were
gathered from individuals who had possibly contracted SARS-CoV-2. The enrolled
patients were referred from 67 nearby clinics and a local public health center, and by
healthcare workers at TMCH. All patients provided informed consent to participate in
the study, which was approved by the ethics committee of TMCH (approval number:
2020-071).

Procedures for sample collection and antigen test
Two nasopharyngeal samples were obtained from each patient for further
testing: one with a sponge swab™ (NIPRO, Osaka, Japan) for antigen testing, and the

other with FLOQSwab™ (Copan Italia S.p.A., Brescia, Italy) for the RT-PCR assay.
After sample collection, antigen testing was performed immediately using the
QuickChaser® Auto SARS-CoV-2 and QuickChaser Immuno Reader II. FLOQSwab
samples were diluted in 3 mL of Universal Transport Medium™ (UTM™) (Copan
Italia) for in-house RT-PCR and reference RT-PCR.

RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2
For in-house RT-PCR, magLEAD 6gC (Precision System Science, Chiba, Japan)
was used to extract and purify RNA from UTM™ samples. The samples were then
transferred to Mizuho Medy for reference real-time RT-PCR. The N2 primer/probe set
(Nihon Gene Research Laboratories, Miyagi, Japan) was employed for reference
RT-PCR as suggested by the “Manual for the Detection of Pathogen 2019-nCoV Ver.
2.9.1” issued by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases of Japan [9]. The RT-PCR
assays were performed on a Thermal Cycler Dice III (Takara Bio, Kusatsu, Japan) using
One Step PrimeScript™ III RT-qPCR Mix (Takara Bio) with the following cycling
conditions: reverse transcription at 52 °C for 5 min and at 95 °C for 10 s, and 45 cycles
at 95 °C for 5 s and at 60 °C for 30s. The absolute viral copy number was determined by
serially diluted RNA control targeting the N2 gene of SARS-CoV-2 (Nihon Gene
Research Laboratories). If the in-house and reference RT-PCR showed conflicting
results, GeneXpert® for SARS-CoV-2 (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) was used to
re-examine the sample for the final decision.

Limits of detection of QuickChaser® Auto SARS-CoV-2 and four commercially available
rapid antigen tests
We compared the limit of detection (LOD) of QuickChaser® Auto SARS-CoV-2
with those of four commercially available rapid antigen tests (Espline® SARS-CoV-2,

Two

SARS-CoV-2–positive, cryopreserved, nasopharyngeal swab specimens were serially
diluted two-fold with UTM™. The diluted solution was collected with the swabs
included in each antigen test kit and was added to the extraction reagent solution of each
antigen test. After that, these extracted samples were dropped into test cartridges. The
LOD of each antigen test was evaluated according to the measurement method
described in the package insert, and results were agreed upon by three researchers.
The numbers of viral copies contained in the UTM™ samples were determined
by RT-PCR with viral RNA extraction performed using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit
(QIAGEN N.V., Hilden, Germany).

Statistical analyses
The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative
predictive value (NPV) of QuickChaser® Auto SARS-CoV-2 were calculated using the
Clopper and Pearson method, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All calculations
were conducted using the R 4.0.3 software program (www.r-project.org).

Results
During the study period, 1,416 nasopharyngeal samples were initially included.
Samples with missing clinical data (n = 14) or measurement errors (n = 1) were
excluded. A total of 1,401 samples were eventually analyzed.
Reference real-time RT-PCR detected SARS-CoV-2 in 83 (5.9%) of the 1401
samples. The results of reference and in-house RT-PCR were consistent in all but one
sample, which was negative by in-house RT-PCR and positive by reference RT-PCR.
This sample was re-evaluated by in-house RT-PCR and GeneXpert® using preserved
UTM. Both tests showed positive results, and the sample was finally considered to be
positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of the 83 samples, 36 (43.4%) were collected from
symptomatic patients, and 47 (56.6%) were obtained from asymptomatic participants.
The relationship between the interval from symptom onset and the sensitivity of
QuickChaser® Auto SARS-CoV-2 is shown in Figure 1.

Comparison of LODs
The results of LOD tests using clinical specimens are summarized in Table 1.
Among the five antigen tests, the QuickChaser® Auto SARS-CoV-2 had the lowest
LOD: QuickChaser® Auto SARS-CoV-2, 34–120 copies/test; Espline SARS®-CoV-2,
481–549 copies/test; QuickNavi™-COVID19 Ag, 4,394 copies/test; Panbio™
COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device, 1,098–1,924 copies/test; and SARS-CoV-2 Rapid
Antigen Test, 549–1,924 copies/test.

Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of QuickChaser® Auto SARS-CoV-2
The clinical performance of QuickChaser® Auto SARS-CoV-2 is summarized in
Tables 2 and 3. Sixty-two of the 83 samples that were positive by reference RT-PCR
were also positive by the antigen test. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were
74.7% (95% CI: 64.0–83.6%), 99.8% (95% CI: 99.5–100%), 96.9% (95% CI:
89.2–99.6%), and 98.4% (95% CI: 97.6–99.0%), respectively (Table 2).
In samples from symptomatic patients, 32 of 36 reference RT-PCR–positive
samples were also positive by antigen testing (Table 3a). The sensitivity, specificity,
PPV, and NPV were 88.9% (95% CI: 73.9–96.9%), 100% (95% CI: 99.3–100%), 100%
(95% CI: 84.2–100%), and 99.5% (95% CI: 98.8–99.9%), respectively.
In samples from asymptomatic individuals, 30 of 47 reference RT-PCR–positive
samples were positive by antigen testing (Table 3b). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV,
and NPV were 63.8% (95% CI: 48.5–77.3%), 99.6% (95% CI: 98.5–100%), 93.8%
(95% CI: 79.2–99.2%), and 96.7% (95% CI: 94.7–98.0%), respectively.
The sensitivities of the antigen test stratified by Ct value are shown in Table 4.

Detailed data of samples with discrepant results between QuickChaser® Auto
SARS-CoV-2 and reference RT-PCR assay
Of the 23 discrepant samples, two were positive by the antigen test and negative
by reference RT-PCR (false positive). Of the 21 samples that were negative by the
antigen test and positive by reference RT-PCR (false negative), 20 had Ct values >30,

and one had a Ct value of 20. For a patient with a false-negative result despite a Ct
value of 20, we retested the preserved UTM™ sample with QuickChaser® Auto
SARS-CoV-2. The antigen test provided a positive result for UTM™ samples that were
diluted approximately 40 fold.

Discussion
In this prospective study, Quick Chaser® Auto SARS-CoV-2 using
nasopharyngeal specimens demonstrated a sensitivity of 74.7% and a specificity of
99.8%. In patients with Ct values <30, the sensitivity was almost identical to RT-PCR.
Furthermore, Quick Chaser® Auto SARS-CoV-2 had a lower LOD than other antigen
tests currently approved in Japan.
Several antigen tests have been developed, with generally high specificity and
variable sensitivity [5]. While Quick Chaser® Auto SARS-CoV-2 had the lowest LOD
in this study, QuickNavi [8] and Panbio [10] had comparable sensitivities. The
diagnostic performance of antigen tests may differ between experimental (UTM™) and
clinical samples [11]. Therefore, direct comparison using clinical samples should be
conducted to evaluate the real-life performance of each test.
Viral load influences overall sensitivity, as shown by the fact that the sensitivity
of antigen tests generally plummets in samples with Ct >30 [8,12]. Samples with Ct >30
comprised 30.1% (25/83) of our study population, which may have decreased the
overall sensitivity of Quick Chaser® Auto SARS-CoV-2. Another factor that may
influence sensitivity is the swab type used. Quick Chaser® Auto SARS-CoV-2 includes

sponge swabs, although flocked-type swabs can collect samples more efficiently [13].
Despite the aforementioned challenges, this antigen test successfully detected
SARS-CoV-2 in all but one of the samples with Ct <30. The remaining case was a false
negative, and considering that re-examination with the UTM™ sample showed a
positive result, the original finding may have been caused by a low viral concentration
due to a flawed sample collection technique. The good performance of this test indicates
that it can accurately identify contagious patients, given that those with Ct values <30
are considered to be highly infectious [14].
We observed false positives in only two samples, and the specificity of Quick
Chaser® Auto SARS-CoV-2 was over 99%. False positives should be avoided as they
lead to unnecessary further testing or quarantine measures [15]; thus, the specificity is
recommended to be over 97% [5]. Positive results should be cautiously interpreted,
especially when the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 or possibility of infection is low.
To maximize its sensitivity, Quick Chaser® Auto SARS-CoV-2 uses two
methods: silver amplification and digital interpretation of the results. Similar to many
antigen tests [5], Quick Chaser® Auto SARS-CoV-2 implements sandwich methods
using labeled antibodies and capture antibodies. Antibodies labeled with gold colloid
attach to specific antigens in a sample. The labeled antigens are then sandwiched by
capture antibodies, which indicate the positive bands. The silver amplification method
generates large silver particles using the gold colloid as a catalyst, and thus enhances the
visibility of the labeled antibody complex [7]. A previous study showed that among
antigen tests for the influenza virus, those that used this method had higher sensitivity

than those that did not (type A, 91.2% vs. 86.8%, respectively; type B, 94.4% vs. 81.2%,
respectively), without compromising specificity [16]. Similarly, digital scans of the test
reagents can improve the accuracy of antigen detection. Digital scans also increase the
objectivity of test result interpretation by removing the necessity for visual inspection. A
systematic review suggested that digital immunoassays increased sensitivities by 25.5%
and 23.5% for influenza A and B, respectively [17]. Although digital immunoassays
require special equipment, the additional cost is much cheaper than that of NAATs, and
is compensated for by the increase in sensitivity [17].
There are several limitations regarding this study. First, reference real-time
RT-PCR used frozen samples. While samples were stored at −80 °C, their viral load
may have decreased during storage process. Second, we did not investigate whether
mutations in SARS-COV-2 affected the diagnostic performance. Third, we did not
evaluate saliva or anterior nasal cavity samples. Saliva collection and anterior nasal
swabs cause less pain and coughing than nasopharyngeal swabs [18]. Future studies
should compare the diagnostic performance of samples obtained using each of these
methods.
In conclusion, Quick Chaser® Auto SARS-CoV-2 showed satisfactory diagnostic
performance of symptomatic patients. The sensitivity was especially high in samples of
Ct <30, indicating that the test can accurately detect highly infectious patients.
