Abstract

29
30

Objective: To document the impact of the COVI-19 pandemic on the health and well-being

31

of individuals with past and current eating disorders in Sweden.

32

Method: We re-contacted participants from two previous Swedish studies who had a known

33

lifetime history of an eating disorder. Participants completed an online questionnaire about

34

their health and functioning at baseline early in the pandemic (Wave 1; N=982) and six

35

months later (Wave 2); N=646).

36

Results: Three important patterns emerged: 1) higher current eating disorder symptom levels

37

were associated with greater anxiety, worry, and pandemic-related eating disorder symptom

38

increase; 2) patterns were fairly stable across time, although a concerning number who

39

reported being symptom-free at Wave 1 reported re-emergence of symptoms at Wave 2; and

40

3) only a minority of participants with current eating disorders were in treatment, and of those

41

who were in treatment, many reported fewer treatment sessions than pre-pandemic and

42

decreased quality of care.

43

Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic is posing serious health challenges for individuals

44

with eating disorders, whether currently symptomatic or in remission. We encourage health

45

service providers and patient advocates to be alert to the needs of individuals with eating

46

disorders and to take active measures to ensure access to appropriate evidence-based care

47

both during and following the pandemic.

Keywords: eating disorders, pandemic, COVID-19, social isolation, relapse
Significant Outcomes and Limitations:
•

54
55

adverse impact of COVID-19 on their mental health
•

56
57

Individuals with eating disorders symptoms or current active disorder report higher
Even individuals who were symptom-free early in the pandemic reported a resurgence
of eating disorder symptoms

•

A large proportion of symptomatic individuals were not in treatment for their eating

58

disorder, services should be aware and access to evidence-based care should be

59

ensured across Sweden

60

•

Limitations included the use of a convenience sample with atypical diagnostic

61

distribution, and a low initial response rate, possibly introducing bias and limiting

62

generalisability.

Introduction

67

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by severe acute

68

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a pandemic in March 2020

69

by the World Health Organization. In response, countries across the globe implemented

70

varyingly strict measures to limit the spread of the virus, balancing the impact of public health

71

measures on social isolation, disruption of daily routines, and economic factors. Besides the

72

direct and often prolonged impact of COVID-19 on physical and mental health,1,2 pandemic-

73

related restrictions have also adversely affected mental health in the general population,34 and

74

may worsen the symptoms in individuals with pre-existing psychiatric illnesses.56 We surveyed

75

a large sample of individuals with eating disorders (ED) in Sweden at two timepoints—Wave

76

1 (baseline early in the pandemic) and Wave 2 (six months later)—to document the impact of

77

the pandemic and public health measures taken to limit its transmission on individuals with

78

EDs.

79
80

Several studies emerged in the literature early suggesting that the pandemic is adversely

81

impacting individuals with ED. Reports from around the world suggest that exposure to

82

triggering environments (e.g., having to spend more time in close quarters with family or

83

roommates), lack of social support, and the absence of structure to daily life are particularly

84

challenging for individuals with EDs.7,8 Individuals surveyed report increases in ED symptoms,

85

anxiety, and stress as a result of the pandemic.9,10 In addition, disruption to clinical services in

86

many countries has impeded access to treatment and initially, virtual care was rated as less

87

satisfactory than typical face-to-face treatment.10,11 Evidence of exacerbation of ED symptoms

88

in individuals with an ED during the COVID-19 pandemic has been documented in studies

89

from, for example, Spain12, Australia13, Germany14, the United States, and the Netherlands.10

90
91

Our primary aim was to characterize experiences of individuals with a current or past ED

92

in Sweden during the COVID-19 pandemic using a longitudinal design with assessments at

93

baseline (Wave 1) and after 6 months (Wave 2). Sweden-specific information is valuable as the

94

country has had a unique response to COVID-19 public health management. We investigated

95

changes in illness status over time, ED symptoms, anxiety, treatment availability, and COVID-

96

19-related concerns. We also investigated baseline variables that were associated with

97

deterioration or improvement of illness status over time. Our results provide valuable

98

information for patients and families, clinicians, and advocacy groups about needs of

99

individuals with EDs in Sweden and have the potential to guide care strategies and resource

100

planning during this and future pandemics.

103

Material and Methods

104
105

Participants and procedure

106

We contacted all participants from two previous large-scale ED studies in Sweden: the

107

Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative (ANGI)15 and the Binge Eating Genetics Initiative

108

(BEGIN), who had given permission to be recontacted for future research. All participants

109

had lifetime history of an ED (and many had current ED). Although all ED presentations were

110

included, the majority of participants had anorexia nervosa (AN), given the nature of the

111

parent ANGI study. Although all participants had verified diagnoses from the parent studies,

112

for the purposes of this study, we used self-reported diagnosis and self-reported symptom

113

status. We sent 3,774 emails on May 27th (170 emails were undeliverable) and when we froze

114

first-wave data collection after six weeks, 982 individuals had responded (27%). The second

115

wave, sent only to those who had completed the Wave 1 survey, was administered between

116

December 22nd 2020 and February 2nd 2021, and 646 responded (66% of Wave 1). The study

117

methodology was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (Dnr 2020-04136).

118
119

Survey

120

The survey (see Supplement 1) was modelled after a survey used in the United States and the

121

Netherlands to study the impact of the pandemic on individuals with EDs (Termorshuizen et

122

al.10) that queried physical and mental well-being related to COVID-19 in the previous two

123

weeks. Participants provided data on age, sex, gender identity, diagnostic and treatment

124

status, exposure to COVID-19, and current situational circumstances (e.g., quarantined,

125

physical distancing). A Likert scale was used to measure level of concern about changes in

126

ED symptoms, frequency of symptoms, and worry related to COVID-19. The 7-item version

127

of the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7)16 assessed anxiety, with Cronbach’s

128

alpha of .91 at Wave 1 and .92 at Wave 2. We applied the ≥10 cutoff16 for possible

129

diagnosable generalised anxiety disorder to categorize participants. Free-text items invited

130

participants to share additional comments (qualitative analyses will be discussed elsewhere).

131
132

Statistical analysis

133

We defined three subgroups according to self-reported symptom status, with the question

134

“Which of the following statements best describes your experience?” and response options “I

135

have previously had an ED but am currently free of symptoms” (NoSx), “I have previously

136

had an ED and still experience some symptoms” (Sx), and “I currently have an ED” (ED).

137

Statistics for each wave are based on the symptom grouping reported at that timepoint,

138

whereas longitudinal analyses (migration) are based on Wave 1 groupings. Distribution at

139

both time points and migration across symptom groups over time are shown in Figure 1.

140
141

We examined changes in each symptom status group over time and baseline predictors of

142

symptom deterioration or improvement using Welch’s t-tests (due to imbalanced design) and

143

Cohen’s d effect sizes, by comparing those who changed group over time with baseline group

144

peers who did not change. Three contrasts were possible based on statistical power: symptom

145

deterioration (NoSxàNoSx vs. NoSxàSx), and two comparisons marked by symptom

146

improvement ( SxàSx vs. SxàNoSx and EDàED vs. EDàSx). We selected baseline

147

predictors that captured ED symptoms, anxiety level (GAD-7), and items that captured

148

concerns about factors that might increase ED symptoms.

149
150

Attrition analyses compared Wave 2 responders with those who responded only at Wave 1 to

151

investigate representativeness of the longitudinal subsample, on anxiety, worry about

152

symptom increase, and ED symptoms.

Sample characteristics and distribution of ED symptom groups

158

The sample consisted of 98% biological females, and gender identity distribution was 97%

159

female, 2% male, and 1% non-binary or other. Self-reported previous or current ED diagnosis

160

distribution (participants could mark several response alternatives) was: anorexia nervosa

161

64%; bulimia nervosa 37%; binge-eating disorder 24%; and other specified feeding and eating

162

disorder 45%; with 12% other; and 1% responding “Don’t know/prefer not to answer”. Table

163

1 shows descriptive statistics for COVID-19-related exposure and preventive measures at

164

Wave 1 and Wave 2. No significant differences emerged between individuals who responded

to both waves of data collection and those who responded to Wave 1 only on any tested

166

baseline variables.

169
170

Figure 1 shows the distribution of the symptom groups NoSx, Sx, and ED at each time point.

171

Thirty-four percent had no ED symptoms, ~50% had lingering symptoms, and 16% reported a

172

current active ED at each time point. Although the percentages at each timepoint were very

173

similar, migration did occur. A full 23% of individuals transitioned from NoSx at Wave 1 to

174

Sx at Wave 2 (i.e., deterioration); 15% of individuals with Sx at baseline reported NoSx at

175

Wave 2 (i.e., improvement); and 21% of individuals with ED at Wave 1 reported Sx at Wave

176

2 (i.e., improvement). The majority of individuals, however, remained in the same symptom

177

category across time.

182

Anxiety and ED symptom variables by symptom status group

183

Table 2 reveals that individuals in all three symptoms groups were more likely to say that

184

their anxiety had increased since the end of 2019 at Wave 2 than at Wave 1. In most cases

185

across symptom groups and at both waves, participants were more likely to attribute their

186

increases in anxiety to COVID-19 (data not shown).

187
188

{Insert Table 2 About Here}

189
190

GAD-7 was strongly associated with symptom group, and patterns were similar across waves.

191

At both Wave 1 and Wave 2, 23% of the NoSx group, ~50% of the Sx group, and 79% (Wave

192

1) and 76% (Wave 2) of the ED group scored above the cut-off for GAD-7.

198

Table 3 shows that concern about ED symptom increase due to the pandemic1 was strongly

199

related to symptom status group. Participants in ED were more concerned about increased

200

symptoms due to lack of structure and social support, and being exposed to triggering

201

environments, than Sx, who in turn were more concerned than NoSx. Patterns were similar

202

across waves.

203
204

Table 3 further shows that more participants reported being worried about others being

205

infected by COVID-19 than themselves, and increased ED symptom level status was

206

associated with higher worry. Further, participants were much more worried about their

207

mental health being affected than physical health, and there was a clear pattern of higher ED

208

symptoms being associated with higher levels of concern.

209
210

{Insert Table 3 About Here}

211
212

A similar pattern emerged with ED symptoms, with increasing symptoms of binge eating,

213

restrictive eating, and compensatory behaviours across NoSx, Sx, and ED groups. Concern

214

about not being able to exercise was similar in both ED and Sx. Patterns were similar across

215

waves.

216
217

Treatment

218

Table 4 presents treatment-related results. Notably, the majority of individuals with active

219

EDs reported not being in current treatment. Most notably, a majority had no current ED

220

treatment, 40% had had fewer sessions in the last two weeks, and a substantial proportion

221

experienced their treatment quality as worse or much worse than before the pandemic. On the

222

other hand, fairly many still had face-to-face sessions and a majority experienced their

223

treatment as good or better than before the pandemic.

224
225

Migration between symptom status groups

226

We conducted two analyses exploring Wave 1 predictors of a change in symptom status

227

between Wave 1 and Wave 2 (Table 5). Two analyses investigated factors associated with

228

deterioration and two related to improvement.

1

Some response options in this item (“concern”, see Supplement 1) are not shown since scores were very low as
the response options are relatively irrelevant for Swedish conditions; these related to concern about not being
able to afford food or treatment, which is not an issue in Sweden at this point.

229

Those individuals who transitioned from NoSx to Sx had significantly higher Wave 1 mean

230

GAD-7 scores, greater concern about being in a triggering environment, and higher worry

231

about not being able to exercise, with medium effect sizes. They also had significantly higher

232

concern about lack of structure and social support, but with small effect sizes.

233

Individuals who transitioned from Sx at Wave 1 to No Sx at Wave 2 had lower scores on

234

concerns about lack of structure, social support, and being in a triggering environment and

235

lower scores on compensatory behaviours, with small to medium effects. Individuals who

236

moved from ED at Wave 1 to Sx at Wave 2 had lower baseline GAD-7 scores.

Discussion

241
242

We characterized experiences of people with a current or past ED early in the COVID-19

243

pandemic and six months later. Using a survey coordinated with studies in the USA and the

244

Netherlands, we identified three important patterns. First, the higher the current ED symptom

245

level of the participant, the more anxiety, worry, and ED symptom increase was reported.

246

Second, results were fairly stable across time, with some exceptions. Third, quite

247

concerningly, only a minority of participants with current ED were in treatment, and of those

248

who were in treatment many reported fewer treatment sessions than usual and decreased

249

quality of care.

250
251

The overall impression is that among people with experience of an ED, those with

252

lingering symptoms or current active disorder are particularly vulnerable to the disruptions

253

and anxiety caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the societal restrictions that have

254

necessarily been put in place. GAD-7 results suggested that a full three-quarters of individuals

255

with active EDs were likely to also have generalised anxiety disorder. In the absence of pre-

256

pandemic data, we are unable to determine whether this is higher than would be expected, but

257

regardless it reflects the importance of attending to anxiety in the treatment of individuals

258

with EDs during the pandemic. Although we found relatively few relapses into ED, a

259

concerning number who initially reported being symptom-free reported re-emergence of

260

symptoms as the pandemic progressed.

261

262

Regarding predictors of deteriorating symptoms, baseline anxiety, weaker social support

263

and structure, and fears about not being able to exercise were all associated with worsening

264

ED symptoms. Symptom improvement showed to some extent the opposite pattern, as it was

265

associated with lower anxiety and higher ratings on social support and structure. These results

266

may be especially informative for treatment planning and safeguarding continued recovery,

267

since they underscore the importance of ensuring that individuals with current or past EDs

268

have skills to address anxiety and strategies to forge social connectedness as well as support

269

and adequate structure to their daily lives.

270
271

Intriguingly, our results closely mirror results reported in the US and the Netherlands,10

272

suggesting that despite considerable differences in the public health measures used across the

273

three countries to contain transmission of COVID-19, the impact on individuals with EDs was

274

comparable. Indeed, EDs thrive in social isolation with patients reporting feeling alone with

275

their ED thoughts and isolated in terms of monitoring their weight and eating. Since

276

developing regular and adequate eating is central to ED recovery and maintenance of

277

treatment gains, the absence of a predictable daily structure removes a central component of

278

ED care.

279
280

Our results have direct clinical implications for clinicians working with ED patients

281

during the pandemic as well as for advocacy organizations who provide additional support.

282

Even if patients have been transitioned to virtual care, it is important to ensure that they have

283

adequate social support via families, peers, advocacy organizations, or even online forums to

284

maintain accountability and motivation for recovery. It is also essential to assess directly

285

individuals’ living arrangements. Given limitations on socializing and recommendations for

286

physical distancing during the pandemic, individuals may find themselves with less freedom

287

and flexibility to extricate themselves from unhelpful or even toxic environments. Remaining

288

vigilant for triggering situations and providing practical assistance with managing them is of

289

critical import. Finally, assisting patients with developing and maintaining structure to their

290

daily lives, especially when working from home, can aid recovery. Providing support, social

291

connectedness, and daily structure are three clinical targets that appear to be critical to ED

292

patients during the pandemic.

293
294
295

Although our study provides important knowledge about how individuals with ED are
coping with the pandemic, it has several limitations. First, given our intention to field a survey

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.29.21254526; this version posted March 31, 2021. The copyright holder for this

perpetuity.

296

soon after COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic, we rapidly translated and adapted a

297

survey used in the US and the Netherlands. This precluded typical steps to ensure sound

298

psychometric properties. Second, we relied on a convenience sample (i.e., individuals who

299

had participated in previous studies who agreed to be contacted for future research), which

300

did not reflect the distribution of diagnoses to be expected from a community sample and may

301

have biased results. Third, we relied on self-report diagnosis and symptom reports to

302

characterize patients. Although all participants had formal diagnoses in the past, the use of

303

self-reports to establish current status remains a limitation. Fourth, our response rate to the

304

initial survey was low (27%) and we experienced attrition between the waves, again

305

potentially introducing bias and limiting generalisability. Finally, we were underpowered for

306

some analyses; group sizes were low for analysing transitions between symptom levels across

307

time.

308
309

Nevertheless, we were able to capture fairly early on in the pandemic how individuals

310

with ED were being affected. As anticipated, COVID-19 has been particularly challenging for

311

those with existing active mental disorders, and even those who are currently symptom-free

312

are challenged to remain healthy. We encourage clinicians and advocacy organizations to

313

avail themselves of these results to aid in developing resources for patients, families, and

314

clinicians for dealing with ED during the pandemic. Given the frequency with which

315

individuals with active EDs reported not being in treatment and the concerning number who

316

initially reported being symptom-free who subsequently reported re-emergence of symptoms

317

six months later, we encourage health service providers and patient advocates to be alert to

318

the needs of ED patients and to take active measures to ensure access to appropriate evidence-

319

based care for all EDs across Sweden during the pandemic and subsequently when there may

320

be a serious backlog of individuals requiring care.
