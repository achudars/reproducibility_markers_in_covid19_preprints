Abstract

41

Social distancing policies were implemented in most US states as a containment strategy against severe

42

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The effectiveness of these policy interventions on

43

morbidity and mortality remains unknown. Our analysis examined the associations between statewide

44

policies and objective measures of social distancing, and objective social distancing and COVID-19 incidence

45

and mortality. We used nationwide, de-identified smartphone GPS data to estimate county-level social

46

distancing. COVID-19 incidence and mortality data were from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource

47

Center. Generalized linear mixed models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95%

48

confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between objective social distancing and COVID-19 incidence

49

and mortality. Stay-at-home orders were associated with a 35% increase in social distancing. Higher social

50

distancing was associated with a 29% reduction in COVID-19 incidence (adjusted IRR 0.71; 95% CI 0.57-

51

0.87) and a 35% reduction in COVID-19 mortality (adjusted IRR 0.65; 95% CI 0.55-0.76). These findings

52

provide evidence to inform ongoing national discussions on the effectiveness of these public health

53

measures and the potential implications of returning to normal social activity.

Introduction

57

Policies intended to increase social distancing were implemented in most US states to reduce transmission

58

of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). An increase in social distancing, through

59

prohibiting social gatherings, non-essential business closures, and stay-at-home orders, may reduce disease

60

incidence (1), but also carries personal and economic consequences. The effectiveness of the social

61

distancing interventions implemented in the US on morbidity and mortality has not been fully described (2).

62

This evidence is critical to inform ongoing public policy decisions and implement effective responses to future

63

pandemics (3). We sought to examine the associations between statewide policies and objective measures

64

of social distancing, and between objective social distancing and COVID-19 incidence and mortality in the

65

US.

66
67

Materials and Methods

68

We used nationwide, de-identified smartphone GPS data provided by Unacast to objectively estimate

69

county-level social distancing based on: 1) change in average distance traveled (per device), 2) change in

70

non-essential venue visitation (e.g., hair salons), and 3) the probability that two users were in close

71

proximity (i.e., spatial distance of ≤50 m and temporal distance of ≤60 minutes) (4). Smartphone GPS

72

devices were assigned to counties based on the longest recorded location. To calculate the change in

73

objective social distancing for any given day, these measures were compared to the same day of the

74

week during the pre-COVID-19 period (defined by Unacast as the four weeks prior to March 8, 2020) and

75

scored 1-5 (higher numbers indicate increased distancing relative to the pre-COVID-19 comparator).

76

Social distancing data were not provided for counties with a population less than 1,000; where less than

77

100 smartphone devices were observed for 70% of the days during the pre-COVID-19 period; or where

78

less than 5 non-essential venues or 100 non-essential venue visits occurred during the pre-COVID-19

period. Incidence and mortality data per county were collected from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus

80

Resource Center (5).

81
82

For the statistical analysis, a paired t-test was used to compare objective social distancing scores before

83

and after state stay-at-home order implementation. Generalized linear mixed models with a Poisson

84

distribution accounting for counties nested within states were used to calculate incidence rate ratios

85

(IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the earliest available social distancing data (February

86

24, 2020) as the independent variable in the incidence and mortality models. Restricted cubic regression

87

splines were used to test for deviations from linearity. Similar results were observed using scaled

88

Poisson models accounting for overdispersion. Multivariable models were a priori adjusted for variables

89

associated with incidence rates or case ascertainment: county-level Hispanic ethnicity, non-white race,

90

percent aged 50 years and older (6), percent males, median household income, population density, and

91

obesity prevalence, and state-level cumulative COVID-19 testing rate. Covariate data were from the US

92

Census Bureau 2018 American Community Survey, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and University of

93

Wisconsin Population Health Institute County Health Rankings and Roadmaps, and The COVID Tracking

94

Project. The analysis encompassed the timeframe from February 24, 2020 to April 29, 2020, when some

95

states began to reopen. All tests were two-sided and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Our study did not constitute human subjects research and was considered exempt from Institutional

97

Review Board review.

Results

100

Objective social distancing data were available for 3,054 counties (94%) in all 50 states and Washington,

101

D.C. Average social distancing prior to the first COVID-19 case, average social distancing before and after

102

policy changes, and COVID-19 incidence rates on April 29, 2020 by county are presented in Figure 1.

103

Forty-five states (including Washington, D.C.) implemented stay-at-home guidance. Stay-at-home orders

104

were associated with a 35% increase in social distancing (mean score 2.01 (SD 0.74) to 2.71 (SD 0.71); p

105

< 0.001). Each one-unit increase in social distancing was associated with a statistically significant

111

Social distancing (from February 24, 2020 until the date that the first confirmed COVID-19 case occurred

112

in each county) was mapped using the Unacast scoring scheme; average county-level social distancing

113

was 2.03 (SD 0.85), where higher values indicate improved social distancing. Forty-five states (including

114

Washington, D.C.) implemented stay-at-home guidance (Oklahoma and Utah enacted policies in major

115

population centers only). Social distancing before and after stay-at-home guidance was mapped using

116

Unacast data from February 24, 2020 to April 29, 2020. COVID-19 incidence (most current data acquired

117

on April 29, 2020) was mapped using quartiles based on counties with >0 cases.

A total of 3,054 counties were included in the analysis. Counties in which social distancing data were
unavailable (n=192) were excluded. Social distancing data from February 24, 2020 (earliest available for
all counties) and COVID-19 incidence and mortality from April 29, 2020 (when the first stay-at-home
guidance was lifted) were used in modeling. All models are adjusted for county-level Hispanic ethnicity,
non-white race, percent aged 50 years and older, percent males, median household income, population
density, and obesity prevalence, and state-level cumulative COVID-19 testing rate

Discussion

131

Social distancing policies implemented in states across the US resulted in meaningful behavioral change.

132

We observed a 35% increase in objective social distancing following the implementation of state-level

133

stay-at-home orders. This is consistent with emerging evidence using a different social distancing

134

methodology (Google human mobility indicators) showing that state policies reduced mobility by 37%

135

within approximately 2 weeks after their implementation (7). A separate recent effort also

136

demonstrated that state policies were associated with a 5-10% increase in the prevalence of residents

137

staying at home full-time (8). Our study builds on these findings by using a nationally representative

138

dataset that objectively assessed social distancing through GPS positioning throughout the state policy

139

implementation window, and further collected information on disease transmission and outcomes.

140
141

We found that state stay-at-home policies were successful in reducing disease. Each one-unit increase in

142

objective social distancing was associated with a 29% reduction in COVID-19 incidence and a 35%

143

reduction in COVID-19 mortality. Several studies have reported a downward deflection in the daily

144

growth rate of COVID-19 cases in selected areas following these policy interventions (9, 10), though the

145

evidence has not been entirely consistent. An analysis of bordering counties in Iowa and Illinois reported

146

that COVID-19 incidence increased more quickly in Iowa counties, where no statewide stay-at-home

147

order was enacted, compared to Illinois counties where a statewide stay-at-home order was put in place

148

(11). Other studies have reported that statewide interventions have only stabilized rather than reduced

149

disease transmission (12).

150
151

Our study was observational and we are unable to directly attribute the associations to social distancing

152

policies. There may be residual confounding and measurement error in social distancing and outcome

153

ascertainment, as testing was not widely accessible at the population level during our study time period.

154
155

Conclusions

156

This evidence strongly suggests that policies promoting increased social distancing were beneficial.

157

Higher social distancing was associated with marked reductions in COVID-19 incidence and mortality.

158

These findings provide evidence to inform ongoing national discussions on the effectiveness of these

159

public health measures and the potential implications of returning to normal social activity.
