Key Points (96/100)
Question: Can the addition of a serological testing reduce the overall testing costs of a PCR-based
SARS-CoV-2 testing reopening plan for universities in the United States?

Findings: This costing study suggested that inclusion of serological testing in addition to outsourced
PCR testing as part of a university re-opening strategy could achieve cost savings of up to 20%. The
amount of savings, or additional costs, is dependent on insourcing or outsourcing of testing, epidemic
conditions and university size.

Meaning: The relative cost-savings depend strongly on whether PCR and/or serology are being
insourced or outsourced, university sizes and cumulative incidence.

Introduction

57
58

In the fall of 2020, colleges and universities throughout the United States started to open their

59

doors to in-person education amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Many adopted a testing-based

60

opening strategy as a piece of their mitigation strategies to contain outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 on

61

college campuses, enabling the restart of in-person education. In order for this testing strategy

62

to be successful, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR, or PCR for

63

short) must be conducted at very frequent intervals, as many as once every two days for those

64

in high-contact with others on campus.1 However, this frequent PCR testing may be cost-

65

prohibitive for the majority of American colleges and universities suggesting that ways to

66

reduce costs without compromising the testing strategy should be considered.

67
68

The addition of serological testing to the PCR testing algorithm may be one such way to reduce

69

overall costs to a college re-opening plan. While antibodies may only be detectable through

70

currently available tests for a limited duration2 it is thought that immunity to the virus may

71

persist beyond the period of detectable antibodies through a T-cell mediated response.3

72

Therefore, someone who tests antibody positive with a serological test may be exempt from

73

repeat PCR testing during the school year, resulting in cost savings to the institution or payer,

74

and reduced burden on members of the university community.

75
76

Therefore, we assessed costs of including serological testing in addition to regular and repeated

77

PCR testing under various university sizes and epidemic conditions in the United States. We

78

explored different screening (i.e. targeted/ universal) and testing (i.e. in-sourcing/out-sourcing

79

of PCR testing) strategies to determine in what instances serological testing could be a cost-

80

saving addition to a PCR-only testing strategy.

81
82

Methods

83
84

We developed a model in Microsoft Excel to calculate the total number of PCR tests required,

85

by university community size, for an effective testing-based campus opening strategy over a 32-

86

week (two semesters) time horizon (September 2020-May 2021). For our PCR testing algorithm,

87

we followed the PCR testing protocol outlined by Boston University. We categorized the

88

students, faculty, and staff into the four groups (category 1-4) based on the severity of potential

89

exposure to COVID-19, apportioned to 40%, 20%, 20%, and 20% of the target population

90

respectively. The frequencies of testing were based on accepted COVID-19 transmission models

91

taking into account the specifics of spread within the university community4 The categories

92

included:

93
94

•

Category 1 (PCR tests twice per week): Commuting students, staff, and faculty who interact

95

with residential students for significant periods of time either in classes or other activities or

96

who otherwise spend many hours on campus in close-contact activities like athletics,

97

performing arts, or in some research and off-campus educational environments

98

•

in-person classes, but with little contact with residential students

99
100

Category 2 (PCR tests once per week): Commuting students residing off-campus attending

•

Category 3 (PCR tests once per month): Commuting employees whose job duties require

101

very limited contact with students and who can control their contact with other employees

102

so as to limit interactions to small groups of individuals with appropriate work environment

103

protocols in place and minimal contact hours

104
105

•

Category 4 (No PCR tests): Students, faculty, and staff who engage only in virtual learning,
working and other activities and events and who do not commute to campus

106
107

For the scenario that includes serological testing, we assume that individuals in categories 1-3

108

will receive an antibody test upon arrival on campus alongside their initial PCR test (Figure 1). If

109

the individual is antibody positive, we assume that they will not be tested again for the

110

remainder of the year. If they are PCR positive and antibody negative upon arrival to campus,

111

an antibody test will be re-done 30-days post symptom onset. If the antibody test remains

112

negative, then the individual will return to the PCR testing algorithm. At the beginning of the

113

second semester, everyone who has never tested antibody positive will again have a serological

114

test and a PCR test upon arrival. This is to enable the university to detect anyone who may have

115

been infected during the break.

116
117

We ranged the initial prevalence of antibodies at the beginning of the fall semester between

118

2.5%-15%, and ranged the cumulative proportion of the university community infected and

119

PCR-confirmed during the school year between 5-30%. We assumed that the immune response

120

remains throughout the school year (32 weeks).5,6 The total number of positive antibody tests is

121

a sum of the baseline prevalence plus the number of incident PCR-positive tests during the

122

school year. Based on the estimates, we calculated the total number of PCR and serological

123

tests required (assuming serological test sensitivity as 0.915) during the school year for each

124

testing category respectively, which are combined with relevant testing frequency and unit

125

costs per testing ($100 if PCR outsourced and $50 if serological testing outsourced7) for each

126

category respectively. Together with the serological testing costs ($15 if PCR insourced and $7.5

127

if serological testing insourced8), we evaluated total testing costs by multiple scenarios of in-

128

sourcing and out-sourcing both PCR and antibody testing. For insourcing strategies, we

129

additionally included capital and recurrent costs of setting up and running the in-house

130

laboratory infrastructure. (Table 1)

132

We considered three different size university settings with a target population of 2,000, 10,000,

133

and 40,000 community members9 and base case of the initial detectable antibody prevalence of

134

5% (varied from 2.5% to 15%) on September 2020 and the cumulative PCR-positive university

135

community members as 10% (varied from 5 to 30%) by May, 2021. As additional scenario

136

analyses, we also considered a targeted serological testing approach, where only category 1

137

university community members receive a serological test while category 1-3 members still

138

receive the regular PCR testing, given the greatest likelihood of cost-savings in this category due

139

to multiple PCR tests per week. Outputs were estimated as total costs and relative percentage

140

of cost saving of the complete testing strategy by arm including serological testing in addition to

141

PCR testing alone for the respective screening and testing strategies over the two semesters (32

142

weeks). To test the robustness of our cost-saving estimates, we performed a number of

143

sensitivity analyses (one-way and three-way sensitivity analyses) based on the uncertainty

144

estimates of each parameter value.

145
146

Results

147
148

Total testing cost and relative percentage of cost saving differ by university size, initial antibody

149

prevalence, cumulative PCR-confirmed incidence across the school-year, as well as by

150

screening/testing strategies (Table 2). For a medium sized university setting (10,000 students)

151

assuming a 5% initial prevalence of antibodies and 10% cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2

152

during September 2020-May 2021, universal screening (80% of the university community) of

153

PCR testing, without the addition of serological testing, costs approximately $34.4 million when

154

outsourced and $5.3 million when insourced. With the addition of serological testing in this

155

scenario, the total cost drops to $32 million when PCR is outsourced. When PCR is insourced,

156

the total cost slightly drops to $5.2 million with insourced serological testing but slightly

157

increases to $5.8 million with outsourced serological testing. Targeted screening of Category 1

158

for serological testing (40% of target population) will decrease costs from $800,000 to $400,000

159

if serology testing is outsourced and $244,000 to $184,000, if serologic testing is insourced,

160

which results in a <8% decrease in total testing costs compared to universal screening across

161

categories. This is due to the fact that regular PCR testing costs are substantial (more than 90%

162

out of total testing costs) compared to serological testing costs.

163
164

Under a plausible range of epidemic conditions (initial antibody prevalence 2.5-15% and

165

cumulative PCR-confirmed incidence during the schoolyear of 5-30%), including serological

166

testing in addition to PCR outsourcing testing in most university settings could achieve cost

167

savings (1% to 20% depending on epidemic conditions) (Figure 2). On the other hand, including

168

outsourced serological testing in addition to PCR insourced testing may increase costs up to

169

12% under the same epidemic conditions. While PCR testing alone is the preferred strategy for

170

epidemic containment, including serological testing (particularly when insourced) may result in

171

cost-savings if an outbreak occurs, or if the baseline antibody prevalence is higher than

172

expected. Overall, targeted screening shows a similar pattern as compared to universal

173

screening but a slightly greater relative percentage of cost saving at medium and large sized

174

universities.

176

Our sensitivity analyses (Figure 3) reveal that when including serological testing in addition to

177

regular PCR testing, cost savings is strongly driven by university population size and cumulative

178

incidence. Not surprisingly, cost savings is likely greater for larger universities and when

179

cumulative incidence, as well as initial prevalence, are high. For example, as we varied

180

cumulative incidence between 5% to 30% from the baseline value of 10% under universal

181

screening at a medium sized university, cost savings of including serological testing varied

182

between $1.3 million to $5 million from the baseline value $2 million if additional serological

183

testing is insourced under the condition of PCR outsourcing testing alone. On the other hand, if

184

additional serological testing is outsourced under PCR insourcing testing condition, reducing

185

serological testing cost is the key determinant to reduce total incremental costs relative to PCR

186

testing alone.

187
188

Discussion

189
190

This analysis explores whether and to what extent PCR and serology screening and testing

191

strategies might be considered cost saving depending on university sizes, epidemic conditions,

192

and screening and testing strategies in the United States. We found that serology testing in

193

addition to regular PCR screening can reduce total test volume and related costs through

194

community members with positive serological test results compared to PCR testing alone. The

195

total testing cost is likely much lower if the regular PCR testing is insourced compared to

196

outsourced ($5 million vs $34 million). While regular and repeated PCR testing is the current

197

preferred strategy for epidemic containment, the inclusion of serological testing may help

198

achieve cost savings if outbreaks occur, or if baseline antibody prevalence is higher than

199

expected, especially in larger sized university communities. In smaller sized universities,

200

however, including serology testing may not be cost-effective if regular PCR testing is highly

201

effective at containing outbreaks.

202
203

Rapid and frequent PCR testing is a central pillar of a mitigation strategy to ensure that

204

individuals quickly isolate themselves if positive and hence control outbreaks in the community.

205

Serological testing is important to estimate the prevalence of infections, including those that

206

are asymptomatic. We show that the inclusion of serological testing to a university testing

207

regiment can reduce the required total number and cost of PCR testing. Importantly we found

208

that this was the case only when serological testing was insourced. The outsourcing of

209

serological testing when PCR tests are insourced was rarely cost saving in any scenario

210

compared to a scenario without serological testing. This is because the additional cost required

211

for serological outsourcing testing is greater than the benefit of test volume reduction. The

212

insourcing of serological testing when PCR testing is insourced can achieve greater cost-savings

213

(1%- 15%) under high initial antibody prevalence (>5%) and cumulative incidence throughout

214

the school year (>10%) at medium and large sized universities. Despite the high up-front cost of

215

setting up in-house laboratory infrastructure for insourcing of serologic testing, the final

216

resulting cost per test can be much lower if insourced ($7) than outsourced ($50), resulting

217

much lower total serological insourcing testing costs and thus cost saving relative to PCR testing

218

alone. If, however, PCR testing is outsourced, the inclusion of serological testing becomes

219

always preferred in most university sizes and epidemic conditions.

220
221

Our study shows that cumulative incidence may be the most important intervenable

222

determinant of cost-savings when including serology testing to PCR testing condition. Several

223

previous studies1,10,11 assessed PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 screening strategies – with varying test

224

frequency and sensitivity (and offered interactive tools to project cumulative incidence 12,13) –

225

for university settings in the United States. They suggested testing frequency was more strongly

226

associated with cumulative infection than test sensitivity. Studies also found that the spread of

227

COVID-19 is mostly happening during a short period of infectivity (3-5 days) from a subset of

228

people (i.e. an estimated eighty per cent of transmissions are caused by just ten per cent of

229

cases).14 Studies to date have not, however, assessed how antibody testing can be incorporated

230

within a university re-opening strategy.

231
232

A university-funded testing program may not be feasible for the majority of American colleges

233

and universities. If the individual is responsible for the cost of their own testing, the potential in

234

reduced medical co-payment costs (if insured) through a once or twice-off antibody test may be

235

cost-saving at the individual level.15 Additionally, if university community members are

236

responsible for getting themselves tested, they may be less adherent, and as such outbreaks

237

may occur (increasing the cost-savings of serological testing). As the optimal testing frequency

238

likely depends on the baseline prevalence of infection in the group1, frequency of regular PCR

239

testing may be reduced (e.g. from two to once a week for category 1) as the percent positive

240

gets lower over time (i.e. below 5% for at least two weeks according to World Health

241

Organization).16 Further, additional cost reduction strategies, such as pooled PCR testing, or

242

partnering with state or local governments for reduced-priced PCR or serological testing should

243

be considered.17

244
245

Our study has several limitations. First, we did not include the additional costs (including tests

246

and personnel) related to contact tracing. While this may affect the point estimates of annual

247

testing costs, it is unlikely to vary by testing strategy. Second, we assumed low PCR and

248

serological test result misclassification, and did not consider potential cost or epidemic

249

implications of PCR false negatives18 (owing either to sampling collection, specimen handling,

250

storage condition problems or low viral load) or antibody false positive19 (such that people

251

think they are immune when they are not) especially for larger size universities under the

252

condition of high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence/incidence 20, which may incorrectly inflate the

253

estimated prevalence and cumulative incidence. On the other hand, as we consider frequent

254

screening for PCR (e.g at least once a week for majority students in campus regardless of

255

symptoms), this may result in a number of false positive cases (and associated costs for contact

256

tracing) for larger universities under the condition of low SARS-CoV-2 prevalence/incidence 21.

257

The overall utility of screening strategies may differ, however, by prevalence of disease among

258

the population and the potential associated costs of false positives and negatives.22 Third, we

259

assumed that the immune response remains throughout the entire school year (32 weeks). If

260

duration of immune response is shorter than the whole school year (e.g. 16-20 weeks)23 and

261

antibodies cannot be reliably detected after several weeks, the initial prevalence of seropositive

262

university community members and associated cost saving may be lower than the range we

263

have assumed here. We also assumed no regular PCR testing if the antibody test is positive, but

264

there is on-going research for serology test validation which may influence the accurate

265

assessment of true immunity and prevalence for individual and population.24 While some

266

degree of immunity to COVID-19 after recovery is assumed, it remains an open question

267

whether the presence of antibodies correlates with protection from disease and whether there

268

is a specific antibody level that correlates with immunity. 25 Fourth, we did not quantify the

269

savings to the individual, in terms of their time and opportunity cost, and potentially bearing

270

the cost of the testing depending on the payer of the testing strategy. At the individual level,

271

particularly when seropositive, cost-savings could be substantial. Finally, we did not consider

272

the addition of antigen testing yet as part of a testing strategy given the relatively low

273

sensitivity compared to the PCR test. Future work should incorporate the use of rapid antigen

274

testing as a component of an on-campus testing strategy.

275
276

Conclusion

277
278

To conclude, while the total testing cost is likely much lower if regular PCR testing is insourced

279

compared to outsourced ($5 million vs $34 million), the inclusion of serological testing

280

alongside regular PCR testing can reduce total test volume and achieve cost savings up to 20%

281

compared to PCR testing alone. As we discuss when and how to phase in re-opening, these

282

results may be useful to decision-makers in planning SARS-CoV-2 testing and considering an

283

investment for mass screening of PCR and serological testing strategies under various capacities

284

of academic institutions and epidemic conditions in the United States. Given the substantial

285

financial investment required for regular PCR testing on university campuses, serological testing

Figure 2. Relative percentage of cost saving by including serology testing in addition to the PCR testin
ng
under epidemic condition by university size and screening and testing strategies.

In panel A, the base case is (circular point) set as 5% for initial prevalence and 10% for cumulative incidence. The bar represe
ents the
extent of relative percentage of cost saving based on the variation of epidemic condition (initial prevalence 2.5-15%; and cumulative
incidence 5-30%). Negative estimates indicate cost increase, while positive estimates indicate cost saving, by including serological
testing in addition to the PCR testing. For example, for a targetted screening at University size 10000, insourcing serological testing
(Blue bar) in addition to PCR outsourcing (“PCRout.T”) will result in 6% (uncertainty range: from 3% under the initial prevalence and
cumulative incidence as 2.5% and 5% to 19% under 15% and 30%) cost saving at basecase epidemic condition. On the other hand,
for a universal screening at University size 10000, outsourcing serological testing (Red bar) in addition to PCR insourcing (“PC
CRin.U”)
will result 9% cost increase (uncertainty range: from 12% cost increase under 2.5% and 5% to 4% cost saving under 15% and
d 30%) at
basecase epidemic condition. Panel B illustrates heat maps of the relative percentage of cost saving for universal screening at
a
university size 10,000 across a range of the epidemic conditions (initial prevalence 2.5-15%; and cumulative incidence 5-30%
%). Dark
red (cost increase) represents cost saving thresholds (black dashed lines) under the set of epidemic conditions in the given scenario.
s
Targetted screening shows similar pattern for the most scenarios but greater cost saving estimates for the scenario with out
tsourcing
serological testing to PCR insourcing compared to the universal screening.
