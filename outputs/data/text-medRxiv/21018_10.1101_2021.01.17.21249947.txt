Abstract
After the March–April 2020 COVID-19 outbreak, a second contagion wave afflicted Europe
in autumn. This study aimed to evaluate sleep health/patterns of Italians during this further
challenging situation.
A total of 2013 Italians longitudinally participated in a web-based survey during the two
contagion peaks of the COVID-19 outbreak. We investigated the risk factors for sleep
disturbances during the second wave, and we compared sleep quality and psychological
well-being between the two assessments (March–April and November–December 2020).
Female gender, low education, evening chronotype, being at high-risk for COVID-19
infection, reporting negative social or economic impact, and evening smartphone overuse
predicted a higher risk of poor sleep and insomnia symptoms during the second wave.
Advanced age, living with high-risk subjects for COVID-19 infection, and having a
relative/friend infected with COVID-19 before the prior two weeks were risk categories for
poor sleep quality. Living with children, having contracted COVID-19 before the prior two
weeks, being pessimistic on the vaccine, and working in healthcare were risk factors for
insomnia symptoms. The follow-up assessment highlighted reduced insomnia symptoms
and anxiety. Nevertheless, we showed reduced sleep duration, higher daytime dysfunction
and sleep medication use, and advanced sleep phase, confirming the alarming prevalence
of poor sleepers (~60%) and severe depression (~20%) in a context of increased perceived
stress.
This study demonstrated a persistent impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep and
mental health. Large-scale interventions to counteract the chronicity and exacerbation of
sleep and psychological disturbances are necessary, especially for the risk categories.

Keywords
Pandemic waves, sleep health, insomnia, longitudinal, mental health.

Introduction
From December 2019, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began to spread worldwide
rapidly. The Italian government reacted to the first contagion wave (March–April 2020)
implementing a total lockdown involving home confinement and social distancing for the
entire population, and the closure of most business activities. The lockdown started on 9
March and lasted until 3 May 2020. Many studies demonstrated a pervasive impact of the
lockdown period during the first wave of COVID-19 outbreak on sleep and psychological
health of the general population (Jahrami et al., 2020; Rakiumar et al., 2020). In autumn, a
second contagion outbreak occurred in Italy, leading the government to adopt new
restraining measures to control the virus propagation. A regional approach was adopted this
time: restrictions of movement freedom, business and school activities have been imposed
according to the local infection diffusion and the pressure on regional healthcare system.
On 6 November 2020, Italian regions have been classified across three risk levels (yellow,
orange, and red), periodically updated based on the COVID-19 related data monitoring. In
the current study, we provide the first evaluation of sleep health of the general population
during the second wave of COVID-19 emergency, identifying the at-risk categories for sleep
disturbances during this further challenging period. Moreover, we longitudinally compared
the outcome of the current period in a large Italian sample with the situation of the first
pandemic wave, through a web-based survey administered the two weeks around the two
contagions peaks.

Methods
Participants and Procedure
The present study is part of a larger research project aimed at understanding the
consequences of COVID-19 outbreak on the Italian population (Salfi et al., 2020a, 2020b).
A total of 8798 Italian citizens participated in a web-based survey during the first wave of
COVID-19 (Test 1: 25 March–7 April 2020; Figure 1), corresponding to the two weeks
centred on the contagion peak (the third and fourth week of lockdown). The survey evaluated
sleep quality, insomnia symptoms, chronotype, depression symptoms, perceived stress,
and anxiety using the following validated questionnaires: the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
(PSQI; Curcio et al., 2013), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI; Castronovo et al., 2016), the

reduced form of the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQr; Natale et al., 2006),
the Beck Depression Inventory-second edition (BDI-II; Ghisi et al., 2006), the 10-item
Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10; Mondo et al., 2019), and the state-anxiety subscale of the
State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-X1; Spielberg et al., 1970).
The Test 1 respondents were invited by email to participate in a follow-up assessment on
28 November 2020, corresponding to the contagion peak of the second wave of COVID-19
outbreak. A total of 2013 individuals participated in the second measurement in a two-week
time window (Test 2: 28 November–11 December 2020; Figure 1). The follow-up
measurement comprised the same questionnaires as Test 1. Additionally, we collected the
following sociodemographic and COVID-19-related information as continuous or categorical
variables: age, gender, education, occupation, geographic region used to derive the
restraining measures in force (yellow, orange, or red zone), living with children, being highrisk subject for COVID-19 infection, living with high-risk subjects for COVID-19 infection,
COVID-19 infection, forced quarantine, infection or death of a relative/close friend due to
COVID-19, perspective on vaccination, negative economic and social impact of the current
situation, and mean exposure (min) to smartphone, PC/tablet, TV, and e-reader in the two
hours before falling asleep during the last two weeks. The available choices for each
categorical variable along with the sociodemographic composition of the follow-up sample,
and the COVID-related responses are reported in Table 1. The compilation of the last three
questionnaires (BDI-II, PSS-10, STAI-X1) was optional to ensure reliable unforced
responses. A total of 1847, 1790, and 1784 participants compiled the BDI-II, the PSS-10,
and the STAI-X1, respectively, during Time 1 and Time 2. Online informed consent was
obtained from participants. The study has been approved by the Internal Review Board of
the University of L’Aquila (protocol n. 43066) and has been carried out according to the
principles established by the Declaration of Helsinki.

Figure 1. Italian national trend of daily deaths and patients in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to
COVID-19 infection across the pandemic period (Protezione civile, 2020). The two assessment
periods (Test 1: 25 March–7 April 2020, Test 2: 28 November–11 December 2020) are marked by
the light blue areas.

Statistical analysis
Prevalence of poor sleepers, moderate/severe insomnia symptoms, and severe depression
condition were computed according to the conventional cut-off scores: PSQI >5, ISI >14,
BDI-II >28, respectively. MEQr scores were used to assign the respondents to three
chronotype groups (Morning-type: 19–25; Neither-type: 11–18; Evening-type: 4–10).
In order to provide a comprehensive overlook on sociodemographic and COVID-related
factors influencing the risk for poor sleep quality and moderate/severe insomnia during the
second pandemic wave, we performed binomial logistic regressions on PSQI (>5) and ISI
(>14) scores including the available sociodemographic and COVID-19-related variables as
predictors.
The investigation on possible changes in sleep quality, insomnia symptoms, chronotype,
depression, perceived stress, and anxiety among the two infection waves has been
performed contrasting the questionnaire scores (PSQI, ISI, MEQr, BDI-II, PSS-10, STAI-X1,
respectively) at the two time-points by paired t-tests. The analysis has been replicated for
specific items (bedtime and wake-up time) and each component of the PSQI (Subjective

sleep quality, Sleep latency, Sleep duration, Habitual sleep efficiency, Sleep disturbances,
Sleep medications, Daytime dysfunction) to further detail the specific dimensions of sleep
habits/quality possibly changed between the two assessments.
The prevalence of poor sleep quality, moderate/severe insomnia, and severe depression
have been compared between the two time-points using McNemar test.
All tests were two-tailed and statistical significance was set to P<0.05. We excluded 153
respondents from the PSQI analyses, due to compilation errors.

Results
At-risk categories for sleep disturbances during the second wave
The results of the logistic regression models are reported in Table 1. Female gender,
evening chronotype, being a COVID-19 high-risk subject, reporting negative social or
economic impact of the current situation, and higher smartphone usage in the two hours
before falling asleep predicted a higher risk of poor sleep and moderate/severe insomnia
symptoms during the COVID-19 second wave. On the other hand, higher education level
and morning chronotype emerged as protective factors against poor sleep quality and
insomnia symptoms.
Advanced age, living with a high-risk subject for infection, and having a relative/close friend
infected with COVID-19 were at-risk categories for poor sleep quality, while living with
children, having contracted COVID-19 before the last two weeks, being pessimistic on the
vaccination prospective, and being a healthcare worker were risk factors for developing
moderate/severe insomnia symptoms.

Sleep and psychological differences between the waves
Results of t-test comparisons between Test 1 and Test 2 are reported in Table 2. The sample
went to bed and woke-up earlier at Test 2. Notwithstanding the lack of significant changes
on PSQI total score, the analyses on PSQI components highlighted several differences
between the two measurements. Subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, and sleep
disturbances improved. On the contrary, respondents slept less, increased sleep
medications use, and showed higher daytime dysfunction. Moreover, the participants

morning chronotype. Finally, depressive symptomatology remained stable, while perceived
stress increased, and anxiety declined. The prevalence comparisons showed that the
percentage of poor sleepers remained stable, insomniacs declined, and the individuals
reporting severe depression symptoms remained unchanged over time.

Discussion
In line with the literature about the first wave (e.g., Salfi et al.,2020b), we confirmed a higher
predisposition of female gender and low education level to develop sleep disturbances
during our second wave assessment. The healthcare workers confirmed their vulnerability
to insomnia symptomatology during the second wave (Pappa et al., 2020), while the elderly
confirmed higher predisposition to poor sleep quality (Mander et al., 2017).
The circadian preference turned out as a crucial predictor of the sleep outcome, consistent
with pre-pandemic literature (Adan et al., 2016): evening-type individuals showed a higher
predisposition to poor sleep quality and moderate/severe insomnia symptoms, while
morning chronotype emerged as a protective factor. The follow-up assessment of our
investigation took place during a period of lighter restraining measures. In Italy, during the
second wave of contagion, a regional lockdown was adopted, and we failed to highlight any
difference according to the rigidity of the restraining measures adopted. This result pointed
to a detrimental effect of the pandemic period itself, regardless of the restrictions in force.
We demonstrated a higher risk for insomnia of individuals who lived with children. School
activities in presence were suspended in Italy during the follow-up measurement while
working activities partially continued (especially in orange and yellow zones). This may have
created a difficult situation to manage for parents, explaining our results.
Being at-risk subjects for COVID-19 infection was associated with a higher predisposition to
poor sleep quality and moderate/severe insomnia symptoms, while living with high-risk
people for COVID-19 predicted a higher probability of experiencing poor sleep quality. These
results could reflect a higher fear of contagion and worries experienced by these individuals,
which triggered sleep disturbances. Having contracted the COVID-19 or having a
relative/close friend infected before the prior two weeks of the survey participation
constituted a risk factor for insomnia and poor sleep quality, respectively, pointing to a longterm impact of these events. Notably, optimism for the future due to the vaccine’s arrival
emerged as a protective factor against the insomnia exacerbation. Therefore, it seems that
the vaccination campaign prospective could be itself beneficial for sleep health.
The pandemic has been going on for months, and the healthcare emergency was
complemented by unprecedented economic and social crises. In this context, more than
one-third of the sample reported a negative economic impact of the current situation, and

six of ten of the respondents experienced a consistent impairment of their social
relationships. Both these outcomes turned out to be risk factors for the exacerbation of sleep
disturbances. Finally, the smartphone overuse before the sleep onset emerged as a risk
factor for sleep disturbances. This finding is putatively ascribable to the well-known
detrimental effect of backlit screen exposure before sleep time on the circadian system, as
well as to the alerting effects of digital engagement. Notably, the increased evening usage
of electronic devices has been already proposed as a mediator of sleep deterioration during
the March–April lockdown (Salfi et al., 2020a).
Comparisons between data from the two outbreak waves displayed an articulated
framework.
We showed improved insomnia symptoms, reduced prevalence of moderate/severe
insomnia conditions, and reduced anxiety. However, the present investigation confirmed the
alarming situation highlighted during the first wave of COVID-19 (Jahrami et al., 2020, Salfi
et al., 2020b), since the majority of the sample consisted of poor sleepers and this
prevalence (~60%) remained stable between the two pandemic waves.
Despite the invariance of sleep quality between the two assessments, we showed several
differences as concerns the PSQI sub-components. Subjective sleep quality, sleep latency,
and sleep disturbance dimensions improved. However, the improvements were
compensated by reduced sleep duration, more severe daytime dysfunction and higher sleep
medication use. Moreover, the participants went to bed more than half an hour earlier and
woke-up almost an hour earlier than during the March–April lockdown. These results were
accompanied by a significant shift towards the morning chronotype. In light of these results,
it should be acknowledged that the first lockdown period was characterized by a substantial
reduction of the social jetlag due to weaker social and working obligations (Korman et al.,
2020). Our findings suggest that the social jetlag returned to negatively influence Italians’
sleep since the second assessment period was marked by a substantial resumption of daily
working and activity routine.
Finally, we confirmed the severity of depressive symptomatology and the alarming
prevalence of severe depression conditions (~20%) of the March–April lockdown.
Remarkably, all these results were obtained in a context of increased perceived stress,
putatively ascribable to the prolonged emergency period.

In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic persists
on both sleep and mental health, although the second wave of contagion has been faced
using lighter restraining measures. Therefore, vigilance is still required, and large-scale
interventions should be performed to counteract the chronicity and exacerbation of sleep
and psychological disturbances, especially for the categories identified as at-risk in the
present study.
