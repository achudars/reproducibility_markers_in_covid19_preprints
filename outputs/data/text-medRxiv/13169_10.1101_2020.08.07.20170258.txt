Abstract:
Background: Mucosal immunity, including secretory IgA (sIgA), plays an important role in early defenses
against respiratory pathogens. Salivary testing, the most convenient way to measure sIgA, has been
used to characterize mucosal immune responses to many viral infections including SARS, MERS,
influenza, HIV, and RSV. However, its role has not yet been characterized in the COVID-19 pandemic.
Here, we report development and validation of a rapid immunoassay for measuring salivary IgA against
the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and report quantitative results in both pre-COVID-19 and muco-converted
subjects.
Methods: We developed and refined a specific test for salivary IgA against SARS-CoV-2 on the Brevitest
platform, a rapid immunoassay system designed for point-of-care use. A qualitative test was validated
as per FDA guidelines with saliva obtained from subjects prior to the emergence of COVID-19, and from
PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients. We also generated a quantitative measure of anti-SARS-CoV-2
salivary IgA. Time taken for saliva self-collection was measured and its ease-of-use assessed.
Results: We successfully validated a qualitative salivary assay for SARS-CoV-2 IgA antibodies, with
positive and negative predictive values of 92% and 97%, respectively, and no observable cross-reactivity
with any of seven potential confounders. Pre-COVID-19 saliva samples showed an 8-fold range of IgA
concentrations, suggesting a broad continuum of natural antibody resistance against the novel virus,
though at levels lower than that observed in COVID-19 PCR-confirmed subjects. Samples from mucopositive subjects also shown a ~9-fold variation in salivary IgA levels, with elevated salivary IgA observed
beyond three months after onset of symptoms. We observed a correlation (r=0.4405) between salivary
IgA levels and COVID-19 disease severity. In anecdotal observations, we observed individuals who
exhibited antibodies early in the course of their disease, contemporaneously with a positive PCR test, as
well as individuals who muco-converted despite no known direct exposure to a COVID-19 patient, no
symptoms, and negative molecular and/or serum antibody tests. Salivary collection took 5-10 minutes,
and was reported as being easy (mean of 1.1 on a scale of 1 to 10).
Implications: Mucosal immunity, including secretory IgA, plays an important role in host defense against
respiratory pathogens, and our early data suggest it may do so in COVID-19. Salivary IgA, an accessible
marker of mucosal immunity, may be a useful indicator of several key parameters including individual
and community immune response, disease severity, clinical risk, and herd immunity. The non-invasive
nature and ease of saliva collection facilitates its potential use as a biomarker for ongoing patient
assessment and management, as well as a community surveillance tool. By measuring mucosal immune
responses directly and systemic immune responses indirectly, salivary IgA could be useful in developing
and deploying a vaccine(s) against COVID-19. Quantitative IgA assessment could also potentially serve
as a tool to segment the population into different risk categories and inform individual and collective
decisions relating to appropriate activities and vaccine prioritization/delivery. These data reinforce the
importance of further investigation into the role of mucosal immunity and IgA in host responses against
COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by rapid global spread and has impacted the life of
almost every person on the planet. First reported in the Wuhan province in China in December 2019,
the COVID-19 disease reached pandemic status within six months and has spread to nearly every
country. Although initially contained in several countries, COVID-19 has begun to resurface even as it
continues to surge through other countries, such as the United States, Russia, India and Brazil, which
have had less success with containment or are experiencing rapid increases in the number of cases1,2.
COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus, termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) by the World Health Organization in February 20203. Coronaviruses have been responsible
for several respiratory disease outbreaks over the previous two decades, including Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS, caused by the SARS-CoV-1 virus) which was primarily limited to Southeast
Asia, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, caused by the MERS-CoV). Although the exact
mechanisms behind the increased spread of SARS-CoV-2 remains to be discovered, one hypothesis
suggests that SARS-CoV-2 spread is fueled by the infectivity of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic
carriers, making containment difficult and allowing the virus to spread worldwide through travel and
community-based contacts4,5.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be primarily spread via respiratory droplets which begin as mucosal secretions in
infected individuals. These droplets become aerosolized by coughing, sneezing, or talking and can
spread through the air or through contaminating surfaces. Respiratory droplets are particularly
infectious when infected persons are in enclosed areas or in close contact with others6. Compounding
the challenges of preventing transmission of the disease, symptoms can vary widely in severity; some
patients remain largely asymptomatic or present with mild disease while others may develop a
potentially fatal severe respiratory crisis7. Common symptoms include sore throat, fever, cough, muscle
pain, headache, and a characteristic loss of taste or smell. Severe cases may result in progressive lung
pathology beginning with difficulty breathing, and progressing to pneumonia or acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS), often requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation of the lungs8. ARDS is
typically associated with a cytokine storm, and can result in organ damage and end stage failure in
organs beyond the lung, including the brain, gastrointestinal tract, vasculature, kidney, liver and
heart9,10.
Outside of efforts to limit physical exposure, including wearing face coverings and limiting contact with
others, the first line of defense against a viral respiratory infection is the mucosal immune system in the
respiratory tract. The mucosal immune system plays critical roles in both innate and adaptive immunity.
As part of the innate response, the mucosal immune system coats the lumen of the respiratory tract
with a liquid lining containing surfactants, mucus, and periciliary fluid. A rapid response to a pathogen
challenge to the respiratory tract is triggered by ‘sensor’ cells, which include epithelial cells,
macrophages, dendritic cells, and mast cells. Upon detection of a pathogen, these cells trigger innate
responses, which include the generation of reactive oxygen species and anti-microbial peptides11,12,13,14
targeted against the pathogen, along with the release of cytokines which attract neutrophils, natural
killer cells, and lymphoid cells. In conjunction with mucociliary clearance, and, where appropriate,
recruitment of additional responder cells (such as eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes), the mucosal
innate immune system protects the respiratory tract and facilitates pathogen clearance.
When the viral inoculum is large enough, it can trigger participation by the mucosal adaptive immune
system, mediated in part through dendritic cells – protruding through the epithelium – to sample
luminal contents15, 16, 17. Dendritic cells, play a critical role in activating an adaptive response.

Part of this adaptive response is the generation of antibodies against the pathogen, including IgA which
plays an important role in mucosal immunity. IgA, which is the antibody class produced in largest
quantities by the body18 primarily exists in the body in two forms: the predominant polymeric form is a
dimer (two IgA molecules covalently linked along the Fc region via J chain) found in mucosal secretions,
while the less abundantly monomeric form is primarily found in serum. Plasma cells producing dimeric
IgA localize along the lamina propria adjacent to mucosal membranes. Dimeric IgA is translocated
across the epithelium via the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor18 and is secreted into the mucosa,
where the covalent linkage confers protease resistance to the IgA molecule17,19. This secretory IgA (sIgA)
has a number of essential functions within mucosal immunity. A major function is to prevent the
cognate pathogens from infecting hos cells via immune exclusion, by competing for the host-cell ligands
that trigger viral entry. sIgA further contributes to viral clearance via agglutination and shielding of
microbial adhesins for later clearance via ciliary activity20. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, sIgA antibodies
may prevent adhesion to target epithelial cells via neutralization of the coronavirus spike protein (and
thus inhibiting its interaction with the host ACE-2 receptor21) or binding to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid
protein. Beyond its role in immune exclusion, sIgA can initiate and regulate the process of myeloid
immune responses through the FcaR receptor to the IgA FC region that is found on multiple immune and
epithelial cells, resulting in a broad range of effector functions involving both humoral and cellular
responses. The production of IgA, relative to other antibody classes is closely controlled by the classswitching process.
IgA responses have already been described as playing a role in immune responses to SARS-CoV-2.
Serum IgA has been detected in COVID-19 patients and appears to be detectable earlier than IgM or IgG
antibodies22, possibly as early as two days after onset of symptoms (versus five days for either IgM or
IgG)23. This suggests that IgA may be the first antibody to appear in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection,
but research into the role of IgA, especially mucosal IgA in COVID-19 has lagged.
Beyond its important role in mucosal immunity and its clear importance in regulating host response to
respiratory infections, IgA is attractive for public health response for another reason: its localization to
the mucosa. As a secreted antibody, sIgA is easily accessible in saliva, and compared with other sample
types, multiple groups have recognized the attractiveness of salivary testing due to its ease of
collection24,25.
Here we report results from over 250 tests IgA tests, including those from earlier versions of our assay.
The IgA test was developed using the Brevitest platform, which is designed for rapid, quantitative, pointof-care ELISA testing. The test was validated for qualitative detection of IgA in saliva in accordance with
FDA guidelines using PCR-confirmed subjects as the true positive group and saliva samples obtained
before COVID-19 emergence as true negative. In addition, we share quantitative data on levels of
salivary IgA against SARS-CoV-2 in both pre-COVID and muco-positive samples. These analyses
demonstrate a broad range of IgA concentrations across subjects, suggest the persistence of anti-SARSCoV-2 salivary IgA through at least 3 months after onset of symptoms and a potential correlation
between salivary IgA levels and disease severity. We also present data on time and ease of use in selfcollected saliva samples. Our findings suggest a potential role for salivary IgA testing in managing
individual patients, understanding community infection rates, and supporting vaccine development and
deployment.

RESULTS
We utilized our Brevitest platform to develop and validate our salivary IgA assay, which we term BRAVO
(Brevitest IgA Salivary Mucosal Test). Briefly, the Brevitest platform is a rapid, automated enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) designed for point-of-care (POC) use. As the platform is automated,
minimal variation between loading, reagents, washing, and development times are expected. Additional
details regarding the platform can be found in the Methods. We developed our COVID-19 salivary IgA
assay to detect IgA antibodies against either the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 antigen (S1) or the SARS-CoV-2
Nucleocapsid Protein (NP) antigen. To validate the BRAVO assay and to ensure that we were detecting
antibodies within a linear range, we spiked increasing concentrations of commercially available anti-S1
and anti-NP antibodies into simulated saliva. We observed a strong, linear correlation in our BRAVO
assay (Figure 1) with a p-value of <0.0001 calculated with a simple linear regression.
After validating the linear range and parameters of the BRAVO assay, we next sought to determine a
cut-off threshold for positive and negative sample types. We purchased true negative samples (saliva
collected pre-COVID-19) to determine our negative mean. Interestingly, we observed significant
variation (~9-fold) in salivary IgA levels among the true negative samples (Figure 2), potentially
explained by the presence of innate, polyreactive IgA or antibodies against other strains of coronavirus.
The mean of our negative sample cohort was determined to be 43.2 Arbitrary Units (AU), with a
standard deviation of 19.4 AU. We selected a value at which 95% of the samples returned the expected
negative result, which resulted in a threshold cut-off of 1.65 standard deviations above the mean, or 75
AU.
We next investigated the potential for false-positive results from cross-reactivity with antibodies against
other pathogens. We testing our assay against anti-sera against four common pathogens: anti-Influenza
B IgG, anti-Respiratory Syncytial Virus IgG, anti- HIV, and anti-Hemophilus Influenza, as well as against
Antinuclear Antibodies (ANA), nonspecific human IgG, and rheumatoid factors. Although we would have
preferred to utilize patient-derived saliva samples, we were unable to acquire cross-reactive saliva
samples, therefore we purchased commercially available patient-derived serum samples. Antibody
concentrations in serum are 10-30x higher than concentrations typically found in saliva (IgA in saliva is
6.5-14.5 mg/dl26 while IgA in serum is 70-400 mg/dl27), therefore, before testing, we conservatively
diluted the serum samples 10-fold using true-negative patient saliva sample as the diluent. We tested
multiple independent samples from each potentially cross-reactive anti-serum, all of which were
negative (Table 1).
After validating and confirming our positive/negative threshold and demonstrating the lack of crossreactivity against common antibodies, we initiated clinical validation of samples from COVID-19 patients.
We tested saliva from 38 patients who had previously tested PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR (Figure 3).
35 of the PCR-positive patients tested positive for salivary IgA against SARS-CoV-2, with a concentration
reading above our threshold, while three tested negative. We therefore calculated a Positive Predictive
Agreement (PPA; sensitivity) and a Negative Predictive Agreement (NPA; specificity) for our assay to be
92% and 97%, respectively (Table 2), with a p-value <0.0001 by two-tailed Fisher’s exact test.
To further characterize salivary muco-positivity, we tested saliva samples from an additional 53 high-risk
subjects who had previously presented to Next Level Urgent Care Clinic (Houston, TX) with symptoms
consistent with COVID-19. Information on their relevant history was collected from the subjects
including information on COVID-19-related symptoms and any additional serology testing they may have
undergone. 48 of the 53 additional subjects (91%) tested muco-positive for salivary IgA. The data from
these 83 muco-positive subjects (48+35) was analyzed further.

As with the pre-COVID samples, we observed a broad range of salivary IgA concentrations (Table 3), with
an over 9-fold difference between the extremes (78 and 720 AU). There was clear separation between
the muco-positive and the pre-COVID samples, with means of 201 and 43 AU, respectively.
Interestingly, the distribution of the muco-positive subjects shows what could be a couple of
discontinuities in IgA levels. These could be a statistical artifact that will disappear with additional
testing, or could have biological significance.
We then looked for correlations between IgA levels and other subject attributes. We examined the
correlation between IgA levels and elapsed time between onset of symptoms and saliva collection
(Figure 4A). For the ten subjects for whom we did not have information on the advent of symptoms, we
used the PCR date. We lacked information on either date for one subject, who was excluded from the
analysis. The elapsed time ranged from 32-109 days with a median of 61 days, with elevated salivary IgA
observed over three months after symptom onset. We did not measure salivary IgA levels longitudinally
in individual subjects, so we looked at other indicators of persistence. There was no correlation
between elapsed time and IgA levels (r=0.015). Further, the average BRAVO result for samples collected
before and after the median elapsed time was 194 and 207 AU, respectively (medians 167 and 176,
respectively). These data suggest that mucosal IgA can persist for months, consistent with that reported
for other respiratory diseases28.
As part of our clinical validation study, we further collected data regarding disease severity, according to
the WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical improvement, and symptom duration. There appeared to be a
correlation with disease severity (r=0.446; p<0.01; Figure 4B). This is consistent with other reports on
correlation between disease severity and serum antibody levels29. There was no apparent correlation
between salivary IgA levels and duration of symptoms (r=0.17; Figure 4C)
To minimize risk to lab personnel of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, our clinical study was limited to salivary
samples collected from individuals who were at least a month post-symptom onset, so we cannot report
on when IgA levels first appear in saliva, though that work is currently underway. However, in limited
anecdotal data collected since, we observe IgA levels arising early in the disease process, at the same
time as with viral shedding. This early appearance of mucosal IgA is consistent with its role in protection
against respiratory pathogens and is also consistent with reports that SARS-CoV-2 serum IgA appears
earlier than IgG or IgM, possibly as early as two days after onset of symptoms.22,23 Interestingly, we also
observed muco-conversion in several individuals despite a lack of symptoms, any evidence of disease
(by PCR and/or serology) or known exposure to COVID-19. This is again anecdotal, but we are sharing it
since it raises some intriguing questions.
Finally, we sought to collect additional data regarding the utility of saliva collection for this, and future
assays. Patients and sample donors in our optimization and clinical validation studies were asked to
complete a questionnaire about sample collection, including an estimation of the overall time required
and an assessment of the ease of use for the self-collection. Saliva collection in this study was by
supervised self-collection. Time required to collect the sample, measured by the supervisor, was 5-10
minutes in each case (Table 4). On a scale from 1-10 (with 1 indicating a high level of ease, and 10
indicating a high degree of difficulty), ~93% of donors selected 1 (indicating that the self-collection was
very easy), ~5% selected 2, and roughly ~2% selected 3. No donors indicated any higher values (Table
5).

DISCUSSION
The classic model of human immunity comprises two interconnected, complementary systems: the
innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. Lung mucosal immunity can act as a critical
link between those systems with respiratory pathogens, playing an important, front-line defensive role.
Lung mucosal immunity includes inducible innate resistance mediated by reactive oxygen species and
antimicrobial peptides,30 as well as effectors – primarily secretory immunoglobulins – that are generated
by and integrated with adaptive immunity. Mucosal immunity has been shown to play a crucial role
against a broad range of respiratory pathogens, although its role in COVID-19 has not yet been
established.
Secretory IgA (sIgA) is a principal component of mucosal immunity, and can easily be measured in saliva.
Brevitest has validated a simple assay for measuring salivary IgA against SARS-CoV-2, which has been
submitted to FDA for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). To our knowledge, no salivary IgA tests for
SARS-CoV-2 have been authorized to date, and authorization of the BRAVO test will provide a new tool
to assess immune responses in COVID-19. The Brevitest platform, on which our BRAVO assay runs, is
designed to be a rapid (<15-minute), point-of-care, quantitative immunoassay. Although we have not
yet validated the test for point-of-care (PoC) use, that work is currently underway. Given the
convenience of saliva collection, a PoC test could open the door to expanded testing in multiple settings.
Here we demonstrate that quantitative data from true negative (pre-COVID) samples could be used to
cleanly define a binary, qualitative threshold to assess muco-positivity. While the test we have
submitted to FDA for an EUA is qualitative, the quantitative results we report here raise important
questions about the host response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, with potentially significant implications for
the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings suggest that a more robust understanding of the role of
mucosal immunity in COVID-19 could improve decision-making by patients, clinicians, and policymakers.
We discuss some of these implications in three settings: individual immunity and clinical implications;
community surveillance and herd immunity; and vaccine development.
Individual Immunity and Clinical Implications: Our observations that (i) we see a large variation in
salivary IgA titer, even in pre-COVID-19 samples; (ii) elevated IgA levels appear to persist for at least 2-3
months; and (iii) individuals may develop mucosal IgA without an overt SARS-CoV-2 infection, each raise
intriguing questions.
Our unexpected detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgA antibodies in pre-COVID-19 saliva (albeit in significantly
lower quantities than in confirmed COVID exposed patients) is supported by the literature. Polyreactive
“natural” sIgA was first discovered in human saliva and colostrum31 and can bind to a number of
pathogenic antigens. Polyreactive IgA appears to be a carryover from a primordial immune system that
co-exists in humans along with the more modern adaptive immune system, and acts as a front-line host
response that prevents epithelial entry of large numbers of microorganisms.31,32 Polyreactive IgA may
be artifacts of prior adaptive responses, since IgA production – like IgG – generates memory cells that
are stored for future use and expansion. These “natural” antibodies may display variable affinity against
novel pathogens, as those pathogens may have epitopes in common with prior pathogens. However,
these antibodies can also bind with affinities comparable to those seen with monoreactive antibodies.
Further, other group have recently reported the presence of both cellular33 and humoral34,35 immunity to
SARS-CoV-2 in pre-COVID samples, which have been attributed to prior exposure to other coronaviruses.
We do not know if the salivary IgA antibodies detected in the pre-COVID-19 samples are protective, or if
protection is related to mucosal antibody concentrations. But if these natural antibodies are protective,
or accelerate a full adaptive response by giving the immune system an effective “seed” for subsequent
Salivary IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

rounds of somatic hypermutation and clonal selection, they could contribute to the variable
susceptibility to COVID-19 infection that has been observed.
Intriguingly, even among the 83 muco-positive subjects in our study, we observed an over 9-fold range
in IgA levels. If mucosal IgA in COVID-19 behaves in ways similar to those described for other respiratory
pathogens, salivary IgA levels at either end of the spectrum (very low or very high) may have a clinical
significance.
On the one hand, low levels of mucosal IgA have been associated with an increased incidence of
respiratory infections. Byars et al. reviewed data from 1,189,061 individuals who had undergone
tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy in childhood with a comparably sized control group, and found a
significant increase in respiratory infections.36 Several groups have looked at correlation between
changes in salivary IgA and respiratory infections in individuals and found that decreases in IgA
correlated with an increase in infections. These findings have been reported in a wide variety of
subjects including from elite athletes,37 infants,38 healthy children39,40,41 and children with Down’s
syndrome.42 These findings suggest that individuals that are muco-negative for salivary IgA against
SARS-CoV-2 may be at an elevated risk for infection and/or disease severity.
Conversely, there is also data suggesting that excessive levels of mucosal IgA can induce a pathologic
inflammatory response. For example, both SIDS43,44 and “near-miss” SIDS45 infants had hyperimmune
responses with substantially elevated levels of mucosal antibody responses. Yu et al. also reported a
correlation between IgA levels and APACHE-II score in critically ill patients with COVID-19 (r2=0.72,
P=0.01)23 although they did not examine salivary IgA. COVID-19 is characterized by sudden respiratory
deterioration in patients, and sIgA can induce an inflammatory response in the airway, including
neutrophil activation,46 and recent pre-prints suggest that systemic neutrophilic activation appears to be
a marker of severity in pandemic flu47 and COVID-19.48,49 Thus, it may be desirable to look for
correlations between clinical outcome and excess salivary IgA levels. If such a correlation is established,
increased salivary IgA could serve as a biomarker to identify patients at an elevated risk of clinical
deterioration in COVID-19, and perhaps candidates for early intervention with steroids, which have been
shown to be effective in some ventilated patients.50
One of our intriguing, though anecdotal observations was that individuals may develop mucosal IgA
without an overt COVID-19 infection. We have conducted over 250 assays, including those with earlier
versions of the test. Brevitest employees, including several of the authors on this paper, contributed
multiple saliva samples over the course of two months as the assay was refined. Several individuals
muco-converted over this period of time despite no known exposure to COVID-19, no symptoms, and no
evidence of disease by PCR and/or serology.
An important role played by sIgA is to continually scan the mucosal surface and prevent pathogen entry
through “immune exclusion”20 where the polymeric sIgA binds to the pathogen and prevents it from
binding to its cell surface targets until it is eliminated by clearance or degradation. If successful, immune
exclusion prevents the pathogen from penetrating the epithelial defenses and establishing an infection,
while still potentially triggering a ramp-up of the body’s immune defenses through their interaction with
the adaptive immune system. Part of IgA’s function is to engage with a broad range of host cells. The
FcaR receptor to the IgA Fc region is found on multiple cells including both key immune mediators like
dendritic cells, and epithelial cells resulting in a broad range of effector functions involving both humoral
and cellular adaptive responses. Once triggered, the adaptive humoral response produces both plasma
cells and memory cells, and an active class-switching process.28,32,51 We need deeper understanding of
the role played by mucosal IgA and its interplay with other elements of the immune system in order to
better understand the pathogenesis and epidemiology of COVID-19.

Community Surveillance and Herd Immunity: Reports that systemic IgA may be detectable earlier than
IgG or IgM,22,23 as early as two days after symptom onset are consistent with the early-response role
played by IgA, as well as with our anecdotal observations that individuals can muco-convert to positive
salivary IgA contemporaneously with viral detection by PCR. A major challenge to successful
containment of COVID-19 has been the relatively high false negativity in PCR testing as well as lack of
timely results that have impeded contact tracing. If the early emergence of SARS-CoV-2 IgA in saliva is
validated, salivary IgA may serve as a useful POC early screening tool, far more attractive to patients and
clinicians than a nasopharyngeal swab, especially with children, with viral PCR serving as a confirmatory
test.
While we do not know whether sIgA antibodies protect against SARS-CoV-2 exposure, extensive
experience with other respiratory pathogens suggests that they should provide at least some protection.
Our observation that mucosal IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 persist for months is especially
intriguing considering the recently reported data that systemic IgG antibody titers can decay within a
month.52 We did not track individual IgA responses over time (that work is currently underway), but
experience with a number of other respiratory pathogens suggests that mucosal IgA defenses can
persist for extended periods of time.15
Apart from playing a special role in respiratory infections, salivary IgA also interacts with the adaptive
immune system. Hence it is not surprising that, as with other respiratory infections, salivary IgA appears
to correlate with systemic antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2.24,25 Given the simplicity of saliva
collection, salivary IgA could be a particularly attractive tool for community surveillance including
identifying and tracking vulnerable populations at increased risk. Sullivan et al. are currently validating
home collection methods, including for salivary IgA.53
Moreover, if sIgA reduces the percentage of SARS-CoV-2 challenges that become full-blown COVID-19
infections, mucosal immunity could be part of the reason why there appears to be an unusually large
number of asymptomatic patients who have tested positive for the virus. The virus could be present
and neutralized by sIgA in mucosal tissue, and thus detectable by RT-PCR, but unable to enter epithelial
cells in sufficient quantity to trigger the classic systemic immune response precipitated by a viral
infection. And finally, if our data on muco-positivity rates are at least somewhat representative of the
true community rate, and mucosal IgA is protective, we may be closer to herd immunity than currently
believed.
Vaccines and Mucosal IgA: Understanding whether mucosal IgA plays a protective role can help
determine the trade-offs between topical and parenteral vaccines (or whether we might need both).
Live attenuated flu vaccines have demonstrated encouraging activity,54,55,56,57 and several inhalation and
intranasal vaccines for COVID-19 are under development. Especially intriguing is our anecdotal finding
that exposure to sub-infective doses of SARS-CoV-2 could induce a mucosal immune response as
measured by salivary IgA. A speculative interpretation is that the threshold of viral exposure required to
induce a mucosal IgA response may be below that required to induce and establish infection or generate
a measurable IgG response. Could we already have an effective and scalable live attenuated vaccine,
with attenuation done by dose-reduction to a non-infective titer?
Even with parenteral vaccines, tracking salivary IgA may be useful for several reasons. Not all mucosal
vaccines lead to systemic immunity, but many do.57,58,59,60,61,62 Selecting a vaccine that induces both
mucosal and systemic immunity in a Phase 1 clinical study might increase the probability of success in
Phase 3. Conversely, high levels of salivary IgA have been associated with a blunted response to
immunization,54 and over-representation of subjects with elevated sIgA in a placebo arm may mask the

beneficial effect of a vaccine. Thus, it may be prudent to analyze or even stratify subjects in a vaccine
clinical study by salivary IgA levels.
In summary, the preliminary data on salivary IgA serology that we have generated with the Brevitest
BRAVO assay is consistent with the extensive published data on the critical role played by mucosal
immunity in protecting against respiratory viruses. This makes a strong case for the clinical, research,
and public health communities to better understand sIgA’s role in COVID-19 and to evaluate the
possibility of its use in patient management, community monitoring, and vaccine development.

METHODS
Brevitest Platform and BRAVO Assay
The Brevitest platform consists of an Analyzer and a single-use test Cartridge. The Analyzer is a
miniaturized fully automated robotic ELISA device that can conduct a standard ELISA using 40 microliters
of sample in less than fifteen minutes. BRAVO is an enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)
capable of quantitative detection of IgA antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in human saliva though the assay has
only been validated for qualitative IgA detection. The analyzer controls and automates the ELISA
process. The automated mechanism controls the movement of magnetic microspheres across several
compartments within the cartridge. In each compartment a separate reaction takes place on the
surface of these microspheres. The microspheres are oscillated in each compartment using proprietary
mixing patterns. The Analyzer incorporates a scanner that measures the optical signal at the end of the
reaction and sends the data to the cloud for analysis. There are a number of controls and safeguards
built into the platform to ensure that the cartridge is inserted properly, the correct test is performed,
the cartridge is not past its expiry date, that the results are valid, and that patient identifiable
information is not at risk.
The cartridges are loaded with about 40μl of patient’s diluted saliva (diluted 5x in phosphate-buffered
saline), and inserted into the analyzer. The analyzer is a cloud connected robotic device which moves
the magnetic microspheres within the cartridge through the different compartments to perform the
complete ELISA reaction. The color change at the end of the process is read by the analyzer’s on-board
optical sensors. BRAVO uses the following reagents. Capture antigen: 1:1 ratio of SARS-CoV-2
Nucleocapsid antigen and SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 antigen (Receptor Binding Domain), both purchased
from Genscript. Secondary antibody: Goat Anti-Human IgA conjugated to HRP (Cat: PA1-74395, Thermo
Fisher Scientific). COVID-19 antibody (Absolute Antibody) as our internal positive control.
Each BRAVO assay utilizes a single-use cartridge, which in addition to the sample lane, contains separate
positive- and negative-control lanes to ensure consistency. The optical density in the control lanes serve
as a quality check on the assay/cartridge and are also used to inform the sample reading. The BRAVO
result is determined by an algorithm that incorporates the results from the sample lane as well as the
negative and positive controls, thereby controlling for cartridge to cartridge variation as well as any
minor differences in the ambient environment.
Assay Validation
The BRAVO assay was validated as described in the Results section, using true negative pre-COVID saliva
samples (Lee Biosolutions) and tested for cross-reactivity using serum samples for anti-influenza B IgG,
anti-respiratory syncytial virus IgG, antinuclear antibodies, IgG, rheumatoid factors (Biomex ZMBH), HIV,
and Hemophilus influenza antibodies (Cantor Bioconnect).
Participant Enrollment and Sample Collection
For clinical sample collection, we enrolled participants who had presented themselves with symptoms
consistent with COVID-19 infection to the Next Level Urgent Care Clinic (Houston, TX) and subsequently
underwent a PCR test using nasopharyngeal sample collection. Information on relevant history was
collected from the subjects including information on COVID-19-related symptoms and any additional
testing (PCR or serology) they may have undergone. Subjects were also asked to rate the ease of saliva
sample collection on a scale of 1 (easy) to 10 (difficult). The details of the PCR test used for each subject
were obtained from the clinic’s electronic health records. The clinical protocol for sample and data

collection and the informed consent document were approved by IntegReview, an independent
Institutional Review Board.
For saliva collection, subjects were provided with a kit containing a salivary swab, a plastic syringe (Care
Touch, part number CTSLL5) and a 1.5 ml capacity tube (VWR International, part number 20170-577).
The swabs were FDA listed Class 1 saliva collection devices, safe for use in adults or children 6 years or
older, and are qualified for recovery of analytes, comparable to saliva samples collected from passive
drool. All three components were supplied individually wrapped by the manufacturer, and assembled in
a single bag by Brevitest. Each bag contained a syringe, a collection tube and a salivary swab, together
with instructions for saliva collection.
For our clinical validation, subjects self-collected saliva supervised by a trained provider. The individuals
supervising the procedure completed a survey as to the length of time taken for sample collection (<5
minutes, 5-10 minutes, or >10 minutes). Individuals also responded rating the procedure on a scale of 1
(easiest) to 10 (most difficult).
The collection procedure is briefly described here. Specimens were collected in accordance with correct
medical practices, observing all standard safety procedures for both patient and collector. The subjects
were briefly verbally instructed on the procedure and a glove put on their dominant hand. They then
opened the bag containing the swab package, syringe and collection tube, removed the contents, and
released the swab from its packaging. The swab was placed under the tongue and kept there for 2
minutes. Meanwhile, the subject identifier code label was put on the tube, the syringe removed from its
package and the plunger removed from the barrel. After collection, the swab was placed in the barrel,
followed by the plunger. The tip of the syringe was inserted into the collection tube and the plunger
slowly pushed down to squeeze the collected saliva into the tube. The tube was then closed and the
user confirmed that the volume of saliva collected (excluding the bubbles/froth on top) reached the first
mark on the tube (which ensures 250 µl of sample). If the sample volume was inadequate, the
procedure was repeated, with the second sample added to the tube to make up the required volume.
The closed tube was placed in a biosafety pouch by the healthcare provider and put in a freezer or
container with dry ice for storage below -20°C and later transport. Samples were kept frozen until
actual testing, for a minimum of 2 hours at -20°C.
Saliva sample preparation
The frozen samples in collection tubes were thawed and warmed up to room temperature by removal
from the freezer 10 to 15 minutes prior to testing. 400 μl of PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) was placed
in a new separate 1.5 ml tube. 100 μl of the saliva sample was added to this tube, and mixed with the
PBS by gently inverting the tube 3-5 times. Care was taken to take the saliva sample from the bottom of
the sample tube, avoiding any remaining bubbles or froth at the top.
Cartridge loading and code linking
An appropriate cartridge for the BRAVO assay was taken from the refrigerator, removed from its pouch
and placed on a clean, flat, dry surface with the barcode on the cartridge facing up. Before running the
assay, the sample was electronically connected to the cartridge, to enable automated reading of results
after the test. To electronically link the sample identification barcode (on the collection tube) to the
cartridge code (on the cartridge), any web-enabled device (e.g. tablet or smartphone) with a camera and
web browser could be used. The test operator logged into the appropriate website on the device and
sequentially scanned the code on the cartridge, followed by the subject identifier code on the tube.
Finally the linking (if done satisfactorily) was saved and the cartridge was ready to be used. 40 μl of the

diluted sample was pipetted into the sample well in the cartridge using a calibrated pipette. The rest of
the sample was saved until the test run was complete, in case of failures or the need to re-test.
Statistical analysis
The PPA and NPA were calculated using standard procedures as explained in the Results section. The
confidence limits were calculated for the population proportion using the Wilson method with standard
statistical software. Inputs were the sample size and number of positive results, the desired level of
confidence in the estimate (95%) and the number of decimal places required in the answer. Outputs
were the estimated proportion plus upper and lower limits of the specified confidence interval.

Figure 2. True negative (pre-COVID, acquired prior to December 2019) patient saliva samples were
sourced from a commercial vendor and assessed using the BRAVO assay. Although variation in
detectable salivary IgA existed across the samples (potentially due to polyreactive IgA or cross-reactivity
with prior coronavirus exposure), the results clustered around a mean of 43.2 AU. We set a threshold
cut-off to separate negative from positive samples where 95% of samples were negative. This value was
set at 75 AU, or 1.65 standard deviations above the negative value mean (indicated by the broken red
line).
