A BSTRACT
COVID-19 outbreak is an awful event. However it gives to the scientists the possibility to test theories
about epidemic. The aim of this contribution is to propose a individual-based model of Lombardy
COVID-19 outbreak at full-scale, where full-scale means that will be simulated all the 10 millions
inhabitant population of Lombardy person by person, in a commercial computer. All this to test the
impact of our daily actions in epidemic, investigate social networks connectivity and in the end have
an insight on the impact of an hypothetical vaccine.
Keywords COVID-19 · Epidemic model · Agent based · Individual based · vaccine · Social networks

1 Introduction
The first alarm from COVID-19 has arrived from China [1], but one of the most dramatic outbreak was in Italy at the
end of January [2]. This epidemic was the setting of a change in risk management: the use of mathematical modeling
[3]. In this direction must be mentioned the paper of [4], where is explored the COVID-19 outbreak in agent-based
model of about 750 thousands inhabitants of the city of Urmia, with the movement of agents approximated by places.
On the same direction is the contribution [5], where is taken in account a model of transmission with a sub-sampled
population of 9 thousands people living in Daegu. But there are also small-scale models as [6]. Must be also mentioned
the model developed by University of Palermo [7] based on the paper [8].
The aim is to introduce a qualitative full-scale agent-based model able to reproduce the Lombardy COVID-19 dynamics,
modeling its outbreak and descent, including as much real data as possible. Being Lombardy population about 10.06
millions makes this model very large scale in comparison with previous contributions. In second instance will be taken
in account several alternative scenarios, in order to weight the events of those days. Then the model of social interaction
used in epidemiological simulations, will be explored in terms of graph theory [9], in order to analyze it as a social
network [10]. In conclusion will be drawn several conclusions about the impact of our habits in COVID-19 outbreak.

2 Methods
2.1 Model structure
The key idea of the model is to create a three layers model, as can be seen in figure 1. The first layer is an agent based
particle model of Lombardy. Every agent is an inhabitant of the region, making this model a full-scale model of the
Italian region. Then we have 10.06 millions agents that move with a random walk [11]. This little detail is part of the
novelty of the contribution, because (at the best of author’s knowledge) it is the first try to simulate a so large population
individual by individual for this purpose.

Figure 1: Three layers structure of the model.

On the agents model is built a collision detection algorithm, able to detect if two particles have distance less than a fixed
value. However the large-scale reached by the model will require an ad hoc algorithm for this purpose, that will be a
challenging problem.
On the collision detection model is built the epidemic model, that is a SIRD (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead)
model [12]. The model has been filled with many experimental findings on COVID-19 and some fitting parameters are
fitted on experimental findings. In the whole analysis have been used as much open access contributions as possible,
moreover the whole project is fully open source at the site [13].
2.2 Agents model
The model simulates the behavior of each inhabitant of Lombardy using the approximation of Random walk [11]. Then
every particle moves with a random vector at every step. In particular the model runs at 6 Frames per days, that is a
good frame rate considering that the scale time for Epidemic phenomena is usually months. The approach of random
walk can appear unrealistic, but this hypothesis ha shown to be appropriate to model very large scale systems, like in
gas thermodynamics [14]. In addition to the random walk, has been added a weak velocity field with a dependence
of r12 , where r is the distance between two particles, like in gravitational field, in order to aggregate particles. The
drift speed of the particles is constant and selected with a Weibull distribution [15] with scale parameter 6 and shape
parameter 1.5. The particles speeds has been adjusted through a multiplicative constant in order to make the average
path length of a particle in a day about 43 Km, as suggested in the report [16].
2.3 Environment model
The setting of the simulation is Lombardy, then the environment model will be a closed 2D box with boundary shape
following Lombardy border. In order to keep particles inside the region, has been introduced a bouncing condition
at the border, so that a particle that tries to cross the border bounces backward. This condition is very popular in gas
thermodynamics [11]. The initial conditions of particles in terms of position are distributed following the actual density
of population of Lombardy, extracted from the image [17] with techniques of image analysis and then must be intended
as an approximation of the real data.

2.4 Collision detection
Starting from the assumption that the algorithm has been designed to run on a commercial computer in parallel (the one
used has a AMD 3900X 12-cores and 64 GB of RAM) and in reasonable time (about 20 minutes of calculation for 14
days of simulation), the collision detection algorithm had a central role in the implementation of the algorithm. Because
to find all the points with distance less than a constant in a set of N points, in general has complexity order of N 2 . In
our model N ≈ 107 , then the complexity is order of 1014 , that’s an incredible number!
Then the idea is to subdivide the Lombardy with a grid with thick about 20 Km and in every cell of the grid apply the
collision detection, all this in parallel through cells. This multi-scale processing has lead to a speed up of the code,
reducing at the same time the RAM used simultaneously in computation, making possible a simulation with 10 millions
particles at the same time. However this approach neglects all the connections across the borders of the cells, the
connections detected fraction (if the detection distance is about 1 Km) has been estimated computationally on a small
scale experiment to be about 97.8% [13], that is a good percentage in a qualitative model. However this percentage can
be increased using a multiple grids detection scheme, but it is beyond the aims of this contribution.
2.5 Epidemic model
The Epidemic model is a SIRD (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead) model [3]. Most of the models available up
to now are called population models [20]. A population model is a model where every node is modeled by a set of
differential equations and it models a sub-population of a region. The number of people modeled by a single node can
range from hundreds to millions. In our model, every node is a single person. So the model is not an ODE (Ordinary
Differential Equations) model, but a stochastic agent-based model. Every node has 4 states:
1. Susceptible: it hasn’t already contracted the disease. It can be become Infected with a probability pI for each
contact with an Infected;
2. Infected: it is infected and then it can infect Susceptible nodes. After E days will change its state to Recovered
or to Dead, in particular it has probability pD to die and 1 − pD to be recovered;
3. Recovered: it has been healed from the disease and it can’t contract it either infect Susceptible nodes any more;
4. Dead: the node has died, so it can’t infect any more.

3 Results
3.1 Lombardy Outbreak
First of all I want to point out that all the simulations are available in .avi format at the link [13], as well the MATLAB
code to reproduce them. Then the first scenario is the Lombardy outbreak of March 2020 [2]. Our simulation starts 29
1
February 2020 and terminates 14 March 2020. The main realistic parameters are pI = 40500
(extracted from the report
[21]) and pD = 0.3 (estimated from Worldometer [22] that has been cited also in [23]).
The fitted parameters are the collision radius of 1 Km (that can appear enormous comparing to the 1 m distance
suggested by WHO [24], but must be taken in account that there are 6 frames per day, then 1 Km is the radius of
interaction of a person that stays in the same place for 4 hours) and the days of disease E = 7 ([25] suggests E < 10).
The results of simulations can be seen in figure 2. The model is able to explain the experimental data until about 9
March 2020. What happened after this date belongs to history. Indeed 9 March was the day of the DPCM "Misure
urgenti in materia di contenimento e gestione dell’emergenza epidemiologica da COVID-19" [19], a law in order to
contain the COVID-19 outbreak. This law was the beginning of the Italian lock down. In this discrepancy between the
data and the model, can be seen all the efforts of Italian people to block the Coronavirus. This simulation also warns us
on what would have could happened.
3.2 Our habits make the difference
This second scenario is inspired from the paper [26]. In this paper the authors show that keeping a 2 meters distance
between people halves the risk of contracting COVID-19. Then the aim of this simulation is to simulate this kind of
social distancing by halving pI in the model. The results, in figure 3, is that the COVID-19 (in this particular scenario)
isn’t enough contagious to spread as in the experimental data. This simple simulation shows the striking role that we
have in fighting this disease, indeed a simple action, like to keep a social distance, can make the difference between a
virus under control and an epidemic. This simple fact has already been observed in experimental finding about Germany
[27], where a synthetic method was used to estimate the contagion without the use of masks. On the same path has
been performed a simulation of lock down, reducing the daily average kilometers done by a node from 43 to 5 and
reducing the interaction distance from 1 Km to 100 m. The results of this simulation can be seen in figure 4. These
simple assumptions were enough to defeat the virus.

3.3 Network Topology
The impact of topology in an epidemic model is an hot topic [28] in the debate about social networks. For this reasons
has been performed a test, one thousands particle has been chosen and then tracked in all the simulation to find the total
number of connection with the whole population. In graph theory, the number of connection of a node is called degree
[9]. With this test has been determined the degree distribution and the daily degree distribution (average degree per day)
of this small group of people varying in time. However here will be presented just the final result, for the full simulation
refer to [13]. The first scenario is the COVID-19 Outbreak scenario, figure 5. Can be seen that the distribution has an
evident left tail (in contrast with the right tail of BA models [10]). Probably this fact emerges from the simulation time
of 14 days (in contrast with the social networks, that usually takes years to be built). It is also interesting the scenario of
lock down. In this scenario we have a fall of the connectivity from thousands average connections per day to order of
hundred. This results shows the importance of the policy of lock down in COVID-19 containment.
3.4 The descent
In this scenario will be taken in account the period between 31 May 2020 and 14 June 2020. In this period Italy is
concluding its lock down and the active cases number is decreasing. For this simulation the kilometers per day has been
arbitrary set to 15, because of the lack of additional information about mobility during this period. The probability of
contagion has been halved to take in account the social distancing. The radius of interaction and the duration of the
disease has been tuned to reproduce experimental data. In particular the value for radius of interaction is 300 m and as
disease duration has been taken E = 35, so 5 weeks. This value (so higher in comparison to the one of the outbreak)
could be motivated by a clinical protocol more accurate and by the queue created by the large number of infected, that
could slow down the exams required to be declared recovered. The qualitative fitting can be seen in figure 7.
3.5 The vaccine
In the previous scenario of descent has been tested the impact of a vaccination of the 70% of population, near to the
62% suggested in [29]. The agents-based models are perfect to test strategies on the individuals. The result of the
simulation is a strong decreasing of infected trend, that is something unexpected in a simulation of 14 days. The results
are shown in figure 8.

4 Conclusions
This model shows the importance of our simple action in an epidemic setting. Indeed the virus behavior is just an
emergent behavior of our habits [10]. However this contribution open a new way in social network analysis, where the
graph theoretical approach is substituted by agents. It also open the way to more realistic epidemic models, where the
hypothetical scenarios can be tested directly on the agents, without any ODE mediation.
