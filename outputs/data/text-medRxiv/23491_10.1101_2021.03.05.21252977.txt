Abstract (239/250)

22

Background

23

Reliable quantification of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is highly relevant

24

for identifying possible vaccine failure and estimating the time of protection. Therefore, we

25

aimed to evaluate the performance of five different Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays regarding

26

the quantification of anti-spike (S) antibodies induced after a single dose of BNT162b2.

27

Methods

28

Sera of n=69 SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals 21±1 days after vaccination with BNT162b2

29

(Pfizer/BioNTech) were tested using the following quantitative SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays:

30

Roche S total antibody, DiaSorin trimeric spike IgG, DiaSorin S1/S2 IgG, Abbott II IgG, and

31

Serion/Virion IgG. Test agreement was assessed by Passing-Bablok regression. Results were

32

further compared to the percent inhibition calculated from a surrogate virus neutralization test

33

(sVNT) by correlation and ROC (receiver-operating-characteristics) analysis.

34

Results

35

Individual values were distributed over several orders of magnitude for all assays evaluated.

36

Although the assays were in good overall agreement (ρ=0.80-0.94), Passing-Bablok regression

37

revealed systematic and proportional differences, which could not be eliminated by converting

38

the results to BAU/mL as suggested by the manufacturers. 7 (10%) individuals had a negative

39

sVNT results (i.e. <30% inhibition). These samples were reliably identified by most assays and

40

yielded low binding antibody levels (ROC-AUCs 0.84-0.93).

41

Conclusions

42

Although all assays evaluated showed good correlation, readings from different assays were not

43

interchangeable, even when converted to BAU/mL using the WHO international standard for

44

SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin. This highlights the need for further standardization of SARS-

45

CoV-2 serology.

61

Background

62

SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing played and still plays an essential role in the management of the

63

COVID-19 pandemic (1). Detection of specific antibodies following SARS-CoV-2 infection is

64

important at both the individual and population levels to identify those at risk of infection (2).

65

However, now in the early vaccination era of the COVID-19 pandemic, another essential role of

66

SARS-CoV-2 serology is added: the determination of specific antibodies after active

67

immunization (3, 4). Although this new role has not yet been finally defined, it is already clear

68

that antibody assays will be needed for both vaccine development and approval process and the

69

follow-up of vaccinated individuals. Licensing studies on a scale such as Pfizer/BioNtech and

70

Moderna vaccines will not be feasible for all vaccine candidates and the companies behind them

71

(5). For this reason, correlates of vaccine-induced protection will have to replace, at least in part,

72

the measurement of clinical outcomes as the sole measure. For reasons of simplicity, relatively

73

good standardizability, and broad applicability, SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests have the best chance

74

of becoming such substitute endpoints (6).

75

The first SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing systems were designed to distinguish individuals with

76

prior COVID-19 infection from those who were still naive to this new virus (7). Therefore, these

77

immunoassays were usually developed as qualitative rather than quantitative tests and were

78

designed by the manufacturer to achieve the highest possible specificity and high sensitivity.

79

High specificity was indispensable, especially at the beginning of the pandemic, because the

80

extremely low seroprevalence rates led to many false positives and low positive predictive values

81

even with tests having a specificity of 99% (8). In contrast, the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2

82

testing was often reduced to assure the high specificities needed for these assays (9). The lower

4

83

antibody levels further aggravated suboptimal sensitivities in mild/asymptomatic infections and

84

during the pandemic by the natural decline in antibody levels (10-15).

85

Various antigens have been used for this purpose, but essentially two types can be distinguished:

86

nucleocapsid- and spike protein-based assays (16). Antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2

87

specific nucleocapsid (NC) antigens are induced early and strongly in most infected individuals

88

due to the virus nucleocapsid's typical strong immunogenicity (17). Furthermore, a very high

89

specificity can be achieved by targeted modification of the nucleocapsid antigen so that no cross-

90

reactivity is observed even with closely related viruses. The discriminatory properties of such

91

nucleocapsid-based antibody assays can therefore be excellent (18, 19). The physiological

92

significance of these antibodies, on the other hand, is unclear, and these surrogate markers for a

93

previous infection are unlikely to be functionally relevant to confer protection or immunity. The

94

antibodies that react with the spike protein (S), however, act differently. At least a proportion of

95

these S-binding antibodies are likely to have the function of neutralizing antibodies (20). Thus, it

96

is not surprising that numerous studies have shown a correlation between spike protein binding

97

assays and various forms of functional virus neutralization assays (21-26).

98

In the context of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, it is precisely these neutralizing antibodies that are of

99

paramount importance. The primary goal of active immunization is to induce many SARS-CoV-

100

2-specific neutralizing antibodies that ideally prevent the pathogen's entry and thus infection or

101

stop the systemic spread to prevent disease (27). The functional virus neutralization assays are

102

not feasible everywhere: assays with live viruses require biosafety level 3, but variants such as

103

pseudotyped neutralization assays are also labor-intensive and cannot be performed at high

104

throughput (28-30). Classical antibody assays, which measure the reactivity of antibodies in

105

serum/plasma with defined antigens, can be performed very rapidly and in high throughput, in

106

contrast to neutralization tests.

107

Thus, anti-spike protein assays will play an important role in vaccine development, licensing, and

108

efficacy monitoring in the future. However, these test systems must be able to reliably quantitate

109

SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody levels, be comparable to each other, and have good to excellent

110

agreement with the presence of neutralizing antibodies. The comparability of antibody assays is

111

expected to be improved by the recent introduction of a first WHO International Standard for

112

anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (NIBSC code 20/136) with reference to neutralizing

113

antibodies.

114

In the present work, we aim to go a step further and characterize the vaccination response after

115

the first administration of the Pfizer/BioNTech btn162b2 vaccine using five commercial

116

quantitative anti-spike protein antibody assays (4 of them with manufacturer's correction factor

117

for the WHO standard) in a head-to-head comparison.

118

Methods

119

Study design and participants

120

This prospective observational study includes sera taken from 69 individuals without a previous

121

SARS-CoV-2 infection taken 21±1 days (mean±standard deviation) after the first dose of the

122

Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine. Further inclusion criteria were an age >18 years, whereas

123

an insufficient amount of serum would have led to exclusion from the study. The study protocol

124

was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Vienna

125

(EK1066/2021). All participants provided written informed consent to donate blood for the

126

evaluation of diagnostic test systems (EK404/2012).

127

Laboratory procedures

128

Serum was obtained and stored at 2 – 10°C for <7 days within the MedUni Wien Biobank, a

129

centralized facility for the preparation and storage of biomaterial with certified quality

130

management (ISO 9001:2015)(31). All analytical procedures were performed at the Department

131

for Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna. The following CE-marked binding

132

assays were applied:

133

The Roche Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Roche S tAb) is an electrochemiluminescence

134

sandwich immunoassay (ECLIA) and detects total antibodies directed against the receptor-

135

binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike (S)-protein and was measured on cobas® e801 modular

136

analyzers (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). The quantification range is between 0.4

137

and 2500.0 U/mL. The manufacturer states intra- and interassay precision between 1 and 3%, a

138

clinical specificity of 99.98% (99.91 – 100), and a cumulative sensitivity ≥14 days after the first

139

positive PCR of 98.8% (98.1 – 99.3) if 0.8 U/mL is used as a cut-off.

140

The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant-test (Abbott S IgG) is a chemiluminescence microparticle

141

immunoassay (CMIA). It quantifies IgG-type antibodies against the RBD of the viral S-protein

142

on an Abbott ARCHITECT platform (Abbott, Abbott Park, USA) between 21.0 and 40,000.0

143

AU/mL. Intra- and interassay precision ranges between 3 and 5%. According to the

144

manufacturer, clinical specificity is 99.55% (99.15 – 99.76), and clinical sensitivity is 98.81%

145

(93.56 – 99.94) ≥15 days after the first positive PCR at a cut-off of ≥50 AU/mL.

146

The DiaSorin LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG (DiaSorin TriS IgG) chemiluminescence

147

immunoassay (CLIA) quantifies IgG antibodies against a trimeric S-protein antigen on a

148

DiaSorin LIAISON (DiaSorin, Stillwater, USA). The quantification range is between 1.63 and

149

800 AU/mL. Intra- and interassay precision ranges between 0 and 5%. According to the

manufacturer, clinical specificity is 99.5% (99.0 – 99.7), and clinical sensitivity ≥15 days after

151

the first positive PCR is 98.7% (94.5 – 99.6) at a cut-off of ≥13 AU/mL.

152

The DiaSorin LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/2 CLIA (DiaSorin S1/2 IgG) detects IgG antibodies

153

against an S1/S2 combination antigen on a DiaSorin LIAISON (DiaSorin, Stillwater, USA). The

154

quantification range is between 3.8 and 400.0 AU/mL. Intra- and interassay precision ranges

155

between 0 and 4% and, according to the manufacturer, specificity among blood donors is 98.5%

156

(97.5 99.2) and sensitivity is 97.4% >15 days after diagnosis at a cut-off of >15 AU/mL, whereby

157

results between 12.0 and 15.0 AU/mL are considered borderline.

158

The Virion\Serion ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) agile SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Serion

159

IgG) (Institut Virion-Serion, Wuerzburg, Germany) was analyzed on a FilterMax F5 Multiplate

160

Reader (Molecular Devices, San José, USA) and quantifies IgG antibodies against total S-protein

161

between 3 and 250 U/mL. Intra- and interassay precision ranges between 1 and 4%. According to

162

the manufacturer, specificity is 99.2%, and sensitivity is 96.2% at a cut-off of 15 U/mL, with

163

values between 10 and 15 U/mL being considered borderline results.

164

If applicable, binding antibody units per milliliter (BAU/mL), which are traceable to the WHO

165

International Standard for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin, were calculated by applying the

166

following conversion factors, as suggested by the manufacturers: Roche S tAb =

168

We excluded prior SARS-CoV-2 infection by using the Roche Elecsys® SARS-CoV-2 ECLIA

169

on the cobas® e801 analyzer (Roche), which detects total antibodies to the viral nucleocapsid

before blood withdrawal (7). As suggested by the manufacturer, results >1.000 COI were

173

considered positive.

174

Neutralizing capacity was estimated by performing a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT)

175

(GenScript, Piscataway, USA). The assay was read on a Filtermax F5 multimodal plate reader.

176

According to the manufacturer, it shows excellent positive (100% [87.1 – 100.0]) and negative

177

percent agreement (100.0% [95.8 – 100.0]) with conventional plaque-reduction neutralization

178

tests (PRNT50 and PRNT90). Results ≥30% are considered positive.

179

Statistical analysis

180

Continuous data are given as a median and interquartile range, categorical data as counts and

181

percentages. Passing-Bablok regressions, Cohen’s Kappa (linear weights) and Spearman rank

182

correlations evaluated the agreement between binding assays. The relationship between binding

183

assays and results from the sVNT was described by quadratic curve fitting. The predictive value

184

of binding assays regarding positivity in the sVNT was assessed by interpreting and comparing

185

(according to DeLong) the areas under the curve (AUC) from receiver-operating-characteristics

186

(ROC)-curves. Statistical significance was assumed if P values were below 0.05. All analyses

187

were performed using MedCalc 19.6 (MedCalc, Ostend, Belgium), and graphs were drawn using

188

GraphPad 9 (GraphPad, La Jolla, USA).

194

(580.1 – 1959.5) and the broadest range (1.4 – 8281.0). In contrast, the DiaSorin S1/2 IgG CLIA

195

yielded the lowest values (63.7 AU/mL [47.8 – 87.5]), and the levels ranged from below the limit

196

of quantification (<3.8%, 1 sample) to 148.0. Two assays, the DiaSorin Tris IgG (195.0 AU/mL

197

[99.0 – 337.3]) and the Serion IgG (50 U/mL [30 – 89]) returned a result above the measuring

198

range for the same donor (>800 AU/mL and >250 U/mL). However, both tests used their full

199

available range (lowest values: 1.8 AU/mL and <3 U/mL). Roche S tAb ECLIA results came in

200

between the other test systems (79.6 U/mL [24.7 – 142.3]), ranging from 0.4 to 508.0.

201

The measured values indicate that the numerical results are strongly dependent on the test system

202

used. In the next step, we aimed to evaluate the overall agreement between the test systems.

203

Agreement between results from different binding assays

204

Results from the Roche S tAb assay correlated well with those of the other binding assays

205

(Abbott S IgG ρ=0.88, DiaSorin TriS IgG ρ=0.83, DiaSorin S1/2 IgG ρ=0.80, Serion IgG

206

ρ=0.82). However, Passing-Bablok regression revealed relevant systematic and proportional

207

differences: Abbott S IgG = 82.5 + 15.54*X, DiaSorin TriS IgG = 33.4 + 2.18*X, DiaSorin S1/2

208

IgG = 39.6 + 0.32*X, Serion IgG = 12.3 + 0.65*X.

209

The Abbott S IgG assay correlated at ρ=0.90 with the remaining three test systems (DiaSorin

210

TriS IgG and S1/2 IgG, Serion IgG). In Passing-Bablok regression, all systematic and

211

proportional errors were statistically significant: DiaSorin TriS IgG = 24.5 + 0.13*X, DiaSorin

212

S1/2 IgG = 34.5 + 0.02*X, Serion IgG = 6.2 + 0.04*X.

213

The DiaSorin TriS IgG assay showed an excellent correlation with the remaining two tests

214

(DiaSorin S1/2 IgG ρ=0.91, Serion IgG 0.94). In the Passing-Bablok regression, nevertheless,

10

215

marked deviations became apparent: DiaSorin S1/2 IgG = 30.5 + 0.16*X, Serion IgG = -0.0 +

216

0.31*X.

217

Finally, the DiaSorin S1/2 IgG and the Serion IgG correlated at ρ=0.91, and the Passing-Bablok

218

regression equation was Serion IgG = -50.9 + 1.78*X. All described relationships, as well as

219

related residual plots, are presented in Figure 2.

220

Furthermore, we assessed whether the classification of results into tertiles (0 – 33.3%, 33.4 –

221

66.7%, 66.8 – 100%) was comparable, e.g., whether a sample yielding a result in the lowest

222

tertile of test A was also in the lowest tertile of test B. Cohen’s kappa was between 0.60 and 0.80,

223

indicating a good agreement, for all but for one of the ten test combinations (Roche S tAb/Serion,

224

kappa = 0.59, see Table 2).

225

In conclusion, the results of the investigated test systems correlate well but are not necessarily

226

interchangeable. Several manufacturers provided conversion factors related to the WHO

227

International Standard for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin, as described in the methods section.

228

Next, we wanted to clarify whether comparing converted BAU/mL instead of arbitrary values

229

facilitates comparability.

230

Associations between standardized binding assay results

231

Binding antibody units per milliliter (BAU/mL) were calculated for the Abbott S IgG, the

232

DiaSorin TriS IgG, and the Serion IgG, according to the recently proposed conversion factors.

233

Results from the Roche S tAb ECLIA did not require conversion as indicated by the

234

manufacturer.

235

As shown in Figure 3, the BAU/mL recalculation did not solve the problem of high proportional

236

errors. The least proportional error could be observed for the relationship between Roche S tAb

237

and Serion IgG. However, the same combination was characterized by comparatively high

238

variability (ρ=0.82).

239

Correlation of binding assay results with a surrogate neutralization assay

240

In a final step, the binding assays' results were compared to percent inhibition of a surrogate virus

241

neutralization assay (sVNT). In the sVNT, the tested samples yielded median values of 63% (50

242

– 76), ranging from 6 to 92%. Figure 4a illustrates that all binding assays except the DiaSorin

243

S1/2 IgG showed a quadratic relationship with the sVNT. The binding assays also differentiated

244

those values clustered in the upper range of the sVNT. However, for the DiaSorin S1/2, the

245

quadratic curve approached a straight line, indicating a mostly linear relationship between this

246

binding assay and the sVNT within the observed range.

247

7 (10%) of the individuals yielded sVNT results below 30% inhibition, which is considered

248

negative according to the manufacturer (Figure 1). Binding assay results were compared between

249

positives and negatives in the sVNT by ROC-curve analysis. The resulting AUCs ranged between

250

0.84 and 0.93 (see Figure 4b), however, the differences between AUCs were not statistically

251

significant. Optimal cut-offs according to Youden’s Index, as well as other cut-offs observed

252

from the data and their respective sensitivities and specificities are given in Supplemental Table

253

1. For three out of the five assays (Abbott S IgG, DiaSorin S1/2 IgG, and Serion IgG), all

254

samples with a negative sVNT result could be correctly identified with a corresponding

255

sensitivity of approximately 60%.

256

Discussion

257

vaccines available a new field of use for SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests will open up. First, many

260

vaccinated individuals will be interested in confirming their own vaccination success based on

261

the detection of specific antibodies. Second, vaccination-induced antibodies may be used as

262

surrogate from which a protection correlate will be estimated. To date, only limited information

263

on the performance of quantitative SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays is available, since most

264

currently evaluated assays were developed in-house, as recently summarized by the CDC

265

COVID-19 response group (32). Only for a few commercially available quantitative CE-marked

266

test systems preliminary data on the performance are given in the literature (19, 22, 33-35).

267

Although a protection correlate for immunity in SARS-CoV-2 has not been defined yet, it is

268

useful to begin this important preliminary work now (6). Therefore, in the present work, we

269

compared different commercial SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays with spike protein reactivity using

270

a vaccination cohort to give a first insight into the comparability of these assays.

271

With regard to the numerical results, we were able to determine a broad distribution of the result

272

values for each individual test system, so that these were presented on a logarithmic scale. This is

273

in line with recently published reports, showing the antibody response after a single dose of

274

BNT162b2 vaccine (3, 4). Interestingly, in agreement with a study involving >500 participants in

275

an identical study setting, we observed very similar mean values for the measurements with the

276

DiaSorin S1/S2 IgG: 66.3 AU/mL versus 68.6 AU/mL (3). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume

277

that our cohort is representative despite the moderate number of participants. In addition, we

278

were able to show that the results of the different test systems varied by a factor of up to more

279

than 50. This leads to the initial conclusion that a direct comparability of the numerical results of

280

different test systems is unlikely to be given across the range of individual findings. Differences

281

also occurred with respect to measurement ranges, and upper measurement limits were exceeded

282

in 2 out of 5 systems (DiaSorin TriS IgG and Serion IgG), although the study cohort reflects the

283

antibody response before the administration of the 2nd dose of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in SARS-

284

CoV-2 naïve individuals. However, it must be mentioned that it is not yet known up to which

285

level a differentiation of the obtained values is meaningful. A recently published paper shows that

286

an anti-S post-vaccination titer of 61.8 AU/mL for the Abbott S IgG was associated with

287

reinfection after a single dose of vaccination. Since this value is only just above the threshold for

288

positivity for this specific assay (50 AU/mL) and in our cohort >95% of all observed values were

289

far higher (5th percentile: 207.5 AU/mL), this finding is plausible and suggests vaccine failure

290

due to very low antibody production. Alternatively, a reinfection might have been caused in these

291

subjects by a virus variant where vaccination protection is mitigated. Nevertheless, it can be

292

assumed that the average values of completely vaccinated persons are significantly higher than

293

those in our collective and thus the upper measurement limits could frequently be exceeded in

294

most assays. If clinically relevant, this could make additional dilution steps necessary, which are

295

not yet taken into account by the manufacturers.

296

Despite the different levels of measurement, all systems showed good correlations with each

297

other. When the measured values of the individual antibody tests were assigned to tertiles, good

298

agreement was shown between the lowest third, the middle third and the highest third of the

299

results. Thus, one individual with known immunosuppressive therapy consistently showed no

300

formation of antibodies in all five antibody binding assays tested. With defined cut-offs for low

301

or high vaccination titers of the different test systems, at least a partial transferability of a result

302

from one to another test system may therefore be expected.

303

Such transferability of results could also be anticipated via referencing the antibody assays used

304

to an international reference standard (32). Indeed, a first WHO international SARS-CoV-2

305

antibody standard with the valence of 1000 BAU/mL has recently become available. This

306

standard was used by the manufacturers for four out of five of the assays studied. However, this

307

standardization was not introduced during the establishment of the test system, but post-hoc as a

308

reference material to define a conversion factor of their own units in BAU/mL. It is therefore not

309

surprising that, this subsequent correction did not reduce the existing systematic deviations

310

(Figure 2) between the different tests. Only the Roche S tAb and Serion IgG tests were able to

311

approximate the equivalence line, although here a very wide scattering of values around the trend

312

lines was observed.

313

The in vitro binding of infection-associated antibodies to pathogen-specific antigens in an

314

antibody test are important markers to objectify a past infection or vaccination. However, these

315

do not necessarily say anything about the function of these antibodies (1). In SARS-CoV-2

316

vaccination, an important goal is to induce neutralizing antibodies that will prevent the virus from

317

binding to the cellular receptor, the ACE2 receptor, via the surface spike protein (36, 37). Tests

318

to neutralize live viruses can only be performed in very specialized laboratories and

319

unfortunately, in the case of SARS-CoV-2, are not standardized, making comparability almost

320

impossible. For this reason, we chose to use a well-characterized surrogate virus neutralization

321

test (sVNT) as a functional reference (38-40). In this assay, a simple ELISA format is used to

322

determine the inhibition of conjugated RBD protein by neutralizing antibodies to the plate-bound

323

ACE2 receptor. The manufacturer suggests a threshold for positivity of 30% inhibition. For the

324

Abbott S IgG, the DiaSorin S1/2 IgG, and the Serion IgG assay, all samples below this threshold

325

were identified at a corresponding sensitivity of about 60%. The corresponding criteria were 3 –

326

17 times higher than the respective assays’ thresholds for positivity. This implies that the cut-off

327

values given for the respective test systems are only valid for the diagnosis of a past infection, but

328

do not necessarily represent a threshold value for the presence of sufficient neutralizing activity.

329

For the Roche S tAb and the DiaSorin TriS IgG assays, a single outlier avoided reaching

330

maximum specificity before sensitivity dropped to 3 and 32%, respectively.

331

In conclusion, we found a good correlation between all evaluated assays, however, the values

332

from the different test systems were not interchangeable, even when converted to BAU/mL using

333

the WHO international standard for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin. Furthermore, it should be

334

noted that the thresholds for positivity provided by the manufacturers are of diagnostic value and

335

are not indicative of sufficient inhibitory capacities.
