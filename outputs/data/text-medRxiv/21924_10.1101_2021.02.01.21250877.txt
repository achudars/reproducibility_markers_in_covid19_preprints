Abstract

2

By January 2020, the COVID-19 illness has caused over two million deaths. Countries have re-

3

stricted disease spread through non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., social distancing). More

4

severe “lockdowns” have also been required. Although lockdowns keep people safer from the virus,

5

they substantially disrupt economies and individual well-being. Fortunately, vaccines are becom-

6

ing available. Yet, vaccination programs may take several months to implement, requiring further

7

time for individuals to develop immunity following inoculation. To prevent health services being

8

overwhelmed it may be necessary to implement further lockdowns in conjunction with vaccination.

9

Here, we investigate optimal approaches for vaccination under varying lockdown lengths and/or

10

severities to prevent COVID-19-related deaths exceeding critical thresholds. We find increases in

11

vaccination rate cause a disproportionately larger decrease in lockdowns: with vaccination, se-

12

vere lockdowns can reduce infections by up to 89%. Notably, we include demographics, modelling

13

three groups: vulnerable, front-line workers, and non-vulnerable. We investigate the sequence of

14

vaccination. One counter-intuitive finding is that even though the vulnerable group is high risk,

15

demographically, this is a small group (per person, vaccination occurs more slowly) so vaccinating

16

this group first achieves limited gains in overall disease control. Better disease control occurs by

17

vaccinating the non-vulnerable group with longer and/or more severe lockdowns.

Introduction

22

The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in late 2019 has had, subsequently, devastating conse-

23

quences across the globe, with all countries reporting levels of virus infection affecting public health

24

responses. Since the emergence of this novel coronavirus, the policies implemented (in part using

25

insights from previous pandemics) have focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and

26

approaches such as travel bans, limited household mixing, stay-at-home orders (‘lockdowns’) and

27

quarantines, social distancing and the closure and restriction of large mass gatherings. These NPIs

28

require effective implementation, behavioural shifts and continued political and public support [1, 2]

29

and have mitigated disease spread, levels of infection, rates of morbidity, and mortality [3, 4, 5].

30

While these measures have suppressed related COVID-19 deaths, NPIs have macroscale impacts

31

on the economics of many nations [6, 7, 8], as well as, arguably, microscale implications, affecting

32

the mental well-being of many individuals [9].

33

34

Although these non-pharmaceutical approaches have some success in reducing virus spread, they

35

are not a sustainable strategy, and other treatment-based approaches are required [10]. Several

36

candidate vaccines are in Phase III trials reporting efficacies from 70% to more than 90% [11]. At

37

the end of 2020, two vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca) have been approved by

38

regulators in some countries as safe for general use.

39

40

Even under the assumption that vaccines work as intended, the challenges now are three-fold. The

41

first is to instigate mass vaccination programs. The second is to prevent health services being

42

overwhelmed in the meantime, recognising that to vaccinate a nation takes time and that there is

43

a lag of some weeks after inoculation before high immunity levels are achieved. The third issue

44

is that many citizens are weary, and persuading them to follow restrictive rules while a vaccine

45

appears imminent may be difficult. That is, many in society could be overly confident that the

46

threat posed by the virus is reduced in light of the announcements of a successful vaccine, failing

47

to recognise there remains a time lag before full levels of herd immunity are realized.

48

49

There is therefore a requirement to determine the optimal balance between five factors. These fac-

tors are: (1) total number of deaths (that in some situations be regarded as a proxy for healthcare

51

capacity), (2) vaccination rate, (3) the level of lockdown restrictions impacting virus transmission

52

rates, (4) the order in which different population groups are inoculated and (5) time spent in lock-

53

down.

54

55

Here we solve aspects of this optimisation problem, based on predictions from a standard SIR

56

(Susceptible, Infected and Recovered) model, modulated by a vaccination program. Specifically,

57

we calculate for prescribed total number of deaths, achievable vaccination rates of different groups

58

and transmission rates, the optimal policy of vaccination delivery amongst population groups so

59

as to minimise time spent in lockdown. We introduce heterogeneity in terms of group structure,

60

with a focus on three main population groups of vulnerable, front-line worker, and non-vulnerable.

61

Our overarching aim is to demonstrate how vaccination and lockdowns can, and should, be used

62

together to achieve optimal disease control. In the the next section we introduce the mathematical

63

frameworks and methods of analysis. In the results, using numerical approaches and as parame-

64

terised for the UK epidemic, we illustrate how different levels of vaccination, lockdown severity and

65

prescribed maximum level of disease determine a minimal lockdown length for a derived optimal

66

strategy of vaccination across our three groups. In the discussion, we present our results in light

67

of previous work on vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions.

Mathematical Models

69

Basic Unstructured Model

70

Mathematical models such as the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) models are commonly used

71

frameworks to describe disease transmission [12]. To explore the combined effects of vaccination

72

and lockdowns on controlling infections, we begin by using a simple extension to an SIR framework

73

in which vaccinated individuals (V ) are accounted for separately from recovered (R) individuals.

74

The dynamics for susceptible (S) individuals is such that the rate of change of the number of

75

susceptibles decreases due to individuals becoming infected, is increased by any loss of immunity

76

of people who have previously recovered, lowered by background death rate and lowered as people

are vaccinated. Hence, this gives for the time evolution of S:

dS
βS(t)I(t)
=−
+ σR(t) − µS(t) − νS(t).
dt
N (t)

(1)

78

The dynamics for infected individuals are such that the number increases as susceptibles pass

79

through an incubation period of length τ become infectious. The number of infected decreases as

80

people either die from COVID-19, die naturally, or recover. Hence I follows:

dI
βS(t − τ )I(t − τ )
=
exp(−µτ ) − (α + µ + γ) I(t).
dt
N (t − τ )

(2)

81

The dynamics for recovered individuals are such that the number increases as people recover from

82

infection, or decreases due to vaccination, non-COVID-19-related death, or loss of immunity, giving:

dR
= γI(t) − (ν + µ + σ) R(t).
dt

(3)

83

Finally the dynamics for the total number of vaccinated individuals is dependent on the vaccination

84

rate, lowered only by a background death rate, and therefore there is an assumption of no immunity

85

loss for those inoculated and no onward transmission of virus once individuals are vaccinated.

86

Hence:

dV
= ν(R(t) + S(t)) − µV (t).
dt

(4)

87

In equations (1)-(4), parameter β is the disease transmission rate, σ the loss of immunity, µ is the

88

background death rate, ν is the vaccination rate (acting on both susceptible and recovered individ-

89

uals), τ is the incubation window (and exp(−mutau) is the survival rate through the incubation

90

window), α is the disease induced death rate, and γ is the disease recovery rate. We introduce

91

circuit breakers as a reduction in transmission such that the value of β reduces to a range of values.

92

The total number of people is N (t) = S(t) + I(t) + R(t) + V (t).

93

94

The optimal control problem (Appendix 1) is formulated as finding an optimal vaccination rate

95

(ν(t)) under different levels of lockdown restriction (i.e. different levels of β) within a time interval

99

not the lockdown period) and ρ is a scaling constant. The increasing quadratic ‘costs’ associated

100

with vaccination assumes that vaccination becomes increasingly difficult as the number of daily

101

vaccinated individuals increases - this is one way to describe ‘vaccination demand’ (see below for

102

other approaches to this on the disease dynamics). The function exp(αI(t) − Z) describes the

103

difference between the number of disease-induced deaths at time point t and a considered threshold

104

value Z. Raising this difference to an exponent ensures that the contribution of (αI − Z) is small

105

if αI < Z and that (αI − Z) contributes greatly to the cost functional J (equation (5)) when

106

αI > Z. This means that deaths, above a threshold Z, are increasingly penalised, corresponding

107

to exceeding a normal acceptable level of healthcare capacity. Here, ρ is a scaling constant that,

108

within the objective functional, weights the relative contribution of the threshold mortality effects

109

compared to vaccination ‘costs’ on the minimisation.

Structured Model

111

We extend the model to incorporate demographic structure, corresponding to different groups of

112

people. Individuals are classed as ‘front-line workers’ (F R), ‘vulnerable’ (V ) individuals or ‘non-

113

vulnerable’ (N V ) individuals. Transmission could occur differently within and between groups,

114

and we define βj,i as the probability that an infected individual in group i infects a susceptible

115

individual in group j. The force of infection (the per capita rate of infection) for the ith group is

Optimal vaccination

129

To investigate the optimal vaccination level under different levels of lockdown severity to keep

130

disease-induced mortality below a critical threshold, we solve the optimal control problem defined

131

by equation (5) following Pontryagin’s maximum principle [13]. This solution is for the unstructured

132

model (equations (1)-(4), considering the population as a single cohort defined by S, I, R and V

133

subgroups). Using the objective functional (equation (5)), adjoint equations, and control inequality

134

constraint [14], optimal dynamic vaccination rates (ν(t)) are calculated for varying levels of reduced

135

disease transmission (β). We use a modified Runge-Kutta method (a forward-backward-sweep

136

algorithm [13]) to find the optimal outcome. The full details of the corresponding Hamiltonian and

137

adjoint equations used to identify the optimum vaccination rate are presented in the Appendix.

138

Vaccination, different cohorts and lockdowns

139

We also investigate the interplay between vaccination strategies amongst population groups and

140

length of lockdowns, so as to achieve the optimal suppression of the virus (in terms of disease-

141

induced mortality) for a variety of considered lockdown lengths and effectiveness, while keeping

142

cumulative mortalities below a critical threshold. To do so we use the structured model (equa-

143

tions (7)-(10)). This model framework accounts for the three groups of front-line workers (F R),

144

vulnerable (V ) and non-vulnerable (N V ), and was solved numerically over 150 days. The model

145

was parameterized with parameters estimated to be appropriate to the UK (Tables 1 & 2). We

146

calculate the optimum vaccination strategies across different population groups.

147

Optimal lockdown times

148

Importantly, we investigate the hypothesis that lockdowns can be used to support, in parallel, on-

149

going vaccination programs in order to prevent infection rates crossing key thresholds. In particu-

150

lar, we consider how different strategies concerning the order in which groups vulnerable, front-line

151

workers, and non-vulnerable are inoculated, for the same maximum infection rate thresholds, im-

152

pacts on length of lockdown. Hence the optimum we search for is the shortest lockdown strategies

153

for each threshold. Again, we solve the structured epidemiology model (equations (7)-(10)) numer-

154

ically for different sequences of vaccination over 150 days. The chosen sequence is to deliver vaccine

155

to first group for 30 days, first and second group from 31-60 days and all groups after 60 days.

156

Critically, the vaccination rates, expressed as fraction of cohort vaccinated per day, are common to

157

each group. This implies that as the vulnerable group is smaller, the number of people vaccinated

158

per day is smaller, likely reflecting the actual situation. The optimal outcome in terms of group

159

order vaccination strategy to achieve the shortest lockdown times, while maintaining cumulative

160

mortalities below a critical threshold, is also determined for varying lockdown severities (i.e. levels

161

of transmission reduction).

162

Vaccination demand: declining vaccine uptake rates

163

A further component that we consider is vaccination elasticity. This process is used to describe how

164

supply and demand varies given changes in (usually) price of a commodity [15]. In epidemiology,

165

this idea of elasticity in demand has been linked to vaccine uptake and disease prevalence [16]. With

166

inelastic demand in vaccine, as disease prevalence falls and assuming that vaccination levels can be

167

maintained, then the public health benefits of vaccination (and the resulting herd immunity) can

168

be maintained as infection levels fall. However if vaccine uptake is elastic with respect to disease

169

prevalence, such that as disease prevalence falls individuals are less likely to take a vaccine, then

170

the public health control of infections can be more challenging. Elasticity can prevent achieving

171

the vaccination levels needed to reach the critical threshold for herd immunity.

172

173

Here we investigate the role of vaccine elasticity demand, via a time evolving function ν(t), on

174

disease outcomes (in terms of cumulative levels of mortality) under different lockdown lengths and

175

severities. Our working hypothesis, that we test, is that lockdowns can be used to offset vaccine

176

elasticities to maintain and/or achieve virus control. We use numerical approaches to solve the full

177

structured model over time (150 days) to find the optimal vaccination level, lockdown duration and

178

severities that keep cumulative mortality below a critical threshold.

Results

182

Optimal vaccination

183

Solving the constrained optimisation problem (Appendix) shows that the optimal vaccination strat-

184

egy is a function of the ratio between the susceptibles, recovered and vaccinated individuals:

ν∗ =

λ1 S + λ3 R − λ4 (R + S)
V

185

where λi are adjoint (Lagrange) multiplier variables associated with the state variables (S, R and

186

V ). While the state variables constrain the minimisation of the objective functional (5), these multi-

187

pliers can be thought of as representing costs of violating the state variable constraints (Appendix).

188

189

Solutions for the optimal vaccination rate are shown in Figure 1. As planned, coupled with the

190

threshold mortality condition, an optimal vaccination strategy can suppress the COVID-19 epi-

191

demic (Figure 1A). However, for increasing lockdown severity (20-80% reduction in transmission

192

i.e. β), this can lead to the infection fading out without the characteristic epidemic growth curve

193

associated with general S-I-R type dynamics.

194

195

With a canonical parameter set (Figure 1), optimal vaccination strategies that keep daily disease-

196

induced mortality below a critical threshold (Z = 100) and can reduce peak numbers of infections

197

by ∼ 74% (with just vaccination) through to ∼ 89% (with vaccination coupled with a 80% reduc-

198

tion in transmission rate), all compared to the no-control scenario.

199

200

The (optimal) vaccination strategy is influenced by the stringency of the mortality threshold (Z)

201

(Figure 1B). As might be expected, a more stringent threshold necessitates higher levels of vaccina-

202

tion to achieve the expected level of control to ensure disease-induced mortality remains below that

203

critical threshold. As also expected, decreasing potential disease transmission (e.g. through the

204

use of NPIs) offsets the need for high levels of vaccination to achieve the necessary levels of disease

205

control (Figure 1B). Notable is the strong non-linearity in Figure 1; where, as a result of reductions

206

in transmission (i.e, effects of different lockdown scenarios), for different critical thresholds the

207

optimal vaccination rate declines in different ways for different critical thresholds.

208

Vaccination, different cohorts and lockdowns

209

Under the structured epidemiological dynamics (equations 7-10), cumulative levels of disease-

210

induced mortality is influenced by the length of time in, and severity of, lockdown along with the

211

vaccination rate (Figure 2). Increasing the vaccination rate decreases the need for longer lockdowns

212

and, under high vaccine coverage, the necessity for these lockdowns. While still essential, lockdowns

213

can instead be of short duration when partnered with a vaccination program. This is again to limit

214

cumulative mortalities to different levels. Under lockdowns where the level of transmission is only

215

reduced by 20% or 40%, cumulative mortalities due to the virus are expected to be excessively high

216

unless vaccine coverage is also high. Under more severe lockdowns where transmission is reduced by

217

60% or 80% (Figure 2), shorter circuit breakers can be sufficient to limit disease-induced mortalities.

219

More specifically, for vaccination to be effective in reducing cumulative mortality (set here at

220

∼ 50, 000 over 150 days), and in the range of anticipated vaccination rate (0.006 - 0.0152), then

221

lockdown severity needs to reduce transmission by at least 60% or lockdowns need to be unac-

222

ceptably long and extend for more that 90 days. Furthermore, these sort of lockdowns or circuit

223

breakers can be used to offset weakly efficacious vaccine rates to ensure that disease-related mor-

224

talities are kept in check below the (nominal) threshold of 50, 000 (Figure 3).

225

226

To understand more fully vaccine delivery strategies between different parts of society, we begin by

227

determining how focusing initial vaccine delivery on single groups affects the likelihood of keeping

228

levels of mortality below the (optimal) threshold. If vaccines are delivered singly to vulnerable or

229

key worker groups then lockdowns would still be necessary and they would need to be reasonably

230

severe (> 60% reduction in transmission) to reduce cumulative mortality below key thresholds

231

(Figure 4). Notable is that less severe lockdowns when vaccinating either of these two groups are

232

not sufficient to keep cumulative mortality below a critical threshold. This key finding is critical, and

233

requires consideration in light of the decision by many countries to vaccinate the most vulnerable

234

first. The reason for this finding is due to the demographic differences between these two groups

235

(where population sizes in these groups are relatively small) compared to the non-vulnerable group

236

(which contains the majority of the population). For example, consider a vulnerable (V) group of

237

500,000 people, and a non-vulnerable (NV) group of 10,000,000 people. If we vaccinate roughly 5%

238

of each group each day this would lead to vaccinating either 25,000 vulnerable people, or 500,000

239

non-vulnerable people, daily. Hence, even if the vulnerable people are an order of magnitude more

240

likely to die of COVID-19, more lives will be saved by vaccinating the 500,000 non-vulnerable group.

241

For some nations this scenario might be likely, if non-vulnerable people can be vaccinated (in units

242

of people per day) at a speed that is an order of magnitude larger - for instance through mass

243

vaccination centres that the vulnerable are unable to reach. In those circumstances, a more robust

244

approach to achieve keeping mortality below the critical threshold would be to vaccinate across the

245

non-vulnerable group and gain from the related shorter and/or less severe lockdown (Figure 4).

Optimal lockdown times

247

Optimal outcomes, in terms of shortest possible lockdown times based on order of vaccination be-

248

tween cohorts, are shown in Figure 4 for different transmission reductions. This summary figure

249

shows how different combinations of vaccination and lockdown interventions can lead to successful

250

disease control (in terms of minimizing cumulative mortalities) (Figure 4). With low vaccination

251

rate (e.g. ν = 0.005), and depending on the severity of lockdown, lockdown durations could be

252

as short as

253

60% reduction in β) or 50 days (for 40% reduction in β) for successful virus control. However,

254

under this level of vaccination (ν = 0.005), it is simply not feasible for a lockdown where β is only

255

reduced by 20% to keep cumulative mortality below the (nominal) 80, 000 threshold.

20 days (for a 80% reduction in β). Alternatively, a lockdown may be 30 days (for

256

257

We illustrate how vaccinating different groups in different sequences can influence strategies to

258

achieve the optimal outcome, and most notably impact the time required in lockdown. If a strat-

259

egy is adopted to vaccinate different groups over sequential 30 day periods (and continuing this

260

vaccination strategy once initiated for each group), then the choice of longitudinal sequences in-

261

fluences the choice of lockdown duration and/or severity to achieve optimal disease control. For

262

the majority of sequences, moderate to severe lockdowns are needed to achieve the optimal goal of

263

keeping cumulative mortality below a critical threshold (Figure 5). However, adopting a strategy

264

in which the non-vulnerable group is vaccinated first, followed by the front line worker group fol-

265

lowed by the vulnerable group (“NV-FR-V”; Figure 5) allows lockdowns of weaker severity (where

266

disease transmission is reduced by only 20%), albeit these might be of longer duration, to be used

267

to achieve the optimal goal. Apart from this sequence of vaccine delivery, there is again no feasible

268

vaccination strategy where weak lockdowns (transmission is reduced by 20%) would allow mortality

269

levels to be kept below 50,000 people. Targeting the non-vulnerable group in the first or second

270

wave of vaccination allows a broad set of lockdown severity (40%-80% reduction in transmission)

271

strategies to be implemented. If a strategy is adopted to target vulnerable and front line workers

272

then it will require moderate to severe lockdowns (60%-80% reductions in transmission) to achieve

273

the optimal outcome for disease control (Figure 5).

Vaccination demand: declining vaccine uptake rates

275

Vaccine demand and uptake can influence the outcome of disease mitigation and control measures.

276

One concern is that as a substantial number of people are vaccinated, and potentially in tandem

277

with initial declines in infection rates, then there will be an emerging complacency and vaccine

278

adoption will fall. However, exponentially declining vaccine uptake is most likely to disrupt control

279

measures and lead to resurgences in disease spread and increases in mortalities (Figure 6). Again,

280

the use of lockdowns of different durations and/or severities can mitigate against this sort of loss of

281

control. Even for weakly restrictive lockdowns (where disease transmission is only reduced by 20%)

282

and vaccine uptake declines exponentially (here set at 2.0x10−4 per day), long duration lockdowns

283

can reduce cumulative mortality levels (Figure 6). In fact, more severe lockdowns for this sort

284

of loss of vaccine uptake can limit the duration of these lockdowns and lead to effective disease

285

control.

286

Discussion

287

Here, using mathematical modelling approaches we have investigated how combining vaccinations

288

and lockdowns can be used to control virus levels (in terms of disease induced levels of mortality).

289

We show that for different levels of vaccination (or vaccine efficacy), lockdowns of different dura-

290

tion and/or severity can be implemented to mitigate levels of mortality. In particular, we highlight

291

particular combinations of vaccination and lockdowns that can achieve effective virus control. Out

292

of a number of potential exit strategies that include promoting natural herd immunity, virus elim-

293

ination or releasing lockdowns as treatments become available, Sheikh et al. (2020) [17] advocate

294

approaches whereby lockdowns are relaxed and virus infection levels are managed through tracing

295

strategies. While this might be an achievable endgame, to reach this point requires, as we have

296

demonstrated here, requires combinations of approaches. Rather than relaxing lockdowns as a

297

strategy, our analysis suggests that combining them with low coverage vaccination (or low vaccine

298

efficacy) allows optimal solutions to be found to mitigating levels of disease.

299

A non-random distribution of vaccinations may be ineffective even in behaviourally homogeneous

301

populations [18]. Moreover, for heterogeneous populations, evaluating the full contact matrix to

302

derive an appropriate vaccination strategy may be impossible. Here, as we use the simplifying ap-

303

proximation that within and between contacts are similar (βji = β), the non-random distribution

304

of vaccines can be inefficient at achieving sufficient coverage for the disease to fade out. Similar

305

findings for age-structured models [19] and vaccine sharing strategies (Huntingford et al. in re-

306

view) corroborate this finding. Here, this occurs due to population size differences between the

307

groups and the relative differences that this has on mitigating levels of disease-induced mortality.

308

In particular, we find that vaccinating individuals in the vulnerable group (a relatively small group)

309

must be rolled out together with mass vaccination across the wider larger non-vulnerable group to

310

achieve necessary public health benefits of reducing mortality and herd immunity.

311

312

These sorts of well-planned vaccination strategies may to lead to spatial and temporal clusterings.

313

These groupings and others such as social clusterings generate further levels of heterogeneity that

314

achieving optimal outcomes based on vaccination strategies alone may be challenging. Groups that

315

eschew vaccinations may make disease control more difficult. In fact, ‘clustering of exemptions’ ne-

316

cessitates greater vigilance around the emergence of a ‘critical mass’ where individual decisions to

317

decline vaccination impinge on the collective (public health) benefit and restricts vaccine coverage

318

[20, 21, 22]. Here, we account for these factors, and consider declining vaccination uptake should

319

groups decide to alter behaviours during mass-roll out of the vaccine. As expected, rapid (expo-

320

nential) decline of vaccine uptake is most precipitous in terms of optimal disease control outcomes.

321

Our results confirm that lockdowns and other non-pharmaceutical interventions can be used to

322

mitigate against the effects of social clusterings and loss of vaccine uptake/efficiacies. However,

323

rapidly understanding the way in which these groupings form will be critical to determine how

324

robust in terms of severity and duration lockdowns need to be to achieve optimal disease control

325

outcomes for COVID-19.

326

327

Optimal control approaches have been widely used in understanding the control of infectious dis-

328

eases and there have been several applications to understanding the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. For

329

instance, our own work [23, 24](Huntingford et al. in review) has focused on the use of optimal

330

control approaches to understand how the use of NPIs and lockdowns could be eased so as to mini-

331

mize hospitalizations, and how circuit-breakers could be optimally used to disrupt epidemic peaks,

332

and the optimal approaches to sharing vaccines between nations. Other studies have focussed on

333

the use of optimal control approaches for mitigating disease mortalities and the use of NPIs [25]

334

and how vaccinations could be administered to minimize mortalities [26].

335

336

Perkins & Espana (2020) [25] use COVID-19 epidemic data from the USA to parameterise an un-

337

structured SEIR framework with additional asymptomatic, hospitalisation and vaccinated classes

338

to investigate the optimal use of NPIs. In their formulation, only susceptible individuals received

339

the vaccine and optimal solutions then focused on minimizing both use of NPIs (as a reduction

340

in disease transmission) and deaths. Perkins & Espana (2020) find that relaxing NPIs too soon

341

can have major implications for longer term disease control and that maintaining stricter levels of

342

control, minimizes deaths. Here, our results support this finding that the severity of control (i.e.

343

as expressed as reductions in disease transmission β) can mitigate levels of disease-induced deaths.

344

Our main finding is that in addition, with vaccination, optimal strategies to minimize deaths can,

345

under certain conditions, offset the need for severe or long lasting NPIs.

346

347

Libotte et al. (2020) [26] use the SIR and optimal control approach to investigate vaccine delivery

348

strategies. In their study, the objective functional is focused to minimize the number of infected

349

individuals and the total amount of vaccine required. Their use of an inequality constraint is used

350

to model limitations related to vaccine availability and production. With the choice of linear terms

351

in the objective functional, the optimal solutions are on-off (bang-bang) control with variable time

352

between delivery of vaccines to minimize the number of infections. Our results contrast with this

353

bang-bang control. This highlights the effects of different uses of cost structures. Here, we use

354

quadratic increasing costs to capture difficulties in achieving vaccination target as the number of

355

vaccinated individuals increases, as well as the application of the optimal control problem to a

356

structured (rather than unstructured) population. In our key result, the sequence of vaccine de-

357

livery to different groups is critical to achieving disease control and minimizing the public health

358

burden of disease-induced deaths.

359

360

As noted, neither of these previous studies consider population structure and the interaction be-

361

tween vaccines and NPIs as concomitant approaches to disease control and minimizing disease

362

induced deaths. We argue that these sort of optimal control approaches provide a ‘weight of ev-

363

idence’ for more pluralistic approaches to controlling the infection, and especially as appropriate

364

constraints can be included in solving numerical optimal models of the epidemiological dynamics.

365

366

In conclusion, although vaccinations for COVID-19 are starting to be approved for use, and coun-

367

tries are thereby implementing mass inoculation programs, many places are experiencing further

368

waves of infection. This requires a difficult balance between providing the benefits of vaccination

369

programs as a route to returning to normality, yet still requiring the continued use of NPIs (such

370

as strict lockdown rules) in the interim. For this reason, it is timely to investigate the options

371

available to minimise the time in lockdown.

372

373

Here, we have used a mathematical model to investigate the combined effect of lockdowns and

374

during a mass vaccination plan. For the three quantities of different rates of vaccinations, extent

375

of restrictions that impacts virus transmission and number of deaths that will protect health ser-

376

vices, we derive the shortest lockdown length. Our mathematics of optimisation determines the

377

shortest lockdown time for the three parameters, and critically, across different options of which

378

groups of people to vaccinate first. We use three discrete cohorts of people, of vulnerable, front-

379

line workers and non-vulnerable. As an additional component to our numerical calculations, we

380

also allow for “vaccine elasticity”, where individuals may become less concerned about receiving

381

a vaccine as disease infection rates fall. We also allow consideration of vaccines that are not fully

382

efficacious as we evaluate optimal outcomes in terms of shortest lockdowns for prescribed maximum

383

levels of mortality. We argue that our use of appropriately developed structured epidemiological

384

models provide a robust way to investigate these epidemiological outcomes. Our optimal control

385

approaches allow the best combinations (here for parameter constraints applicable to the UK) to be

386

determined. However, these outcomes are parameter-dependent, and might change across different

387

locations and/or temporal scales.

17

388

389

Our headline findings are as follows. As might be expected, to require relatively short lockdowns,

390

NPIs have to be sufficiently severe as to suppress transmission. Less effective vaccines imply longer

391

lockdowns, as does a larger vaccine elasticity. However, to achieve appropriate levels of disease

392

control and contrary to the standard approach of vaccinating the most vulnerable first, we find

393

that the optimal vaccination policy is to inoculate the larger (non-vulnerable) demographic group

394

first, then followed by front-line workers and then the vulnerable. While this finding might ap-

395

pear counter-intuitive, given the order-of-magnitude difference in death rate for those encouraged

396

to shield against COVID-19 (i.e. in the vulnerable category). The reason for this finding is our

397

analysis assumes that the time required to vaccinate the vulnerable group is identical to that of the

398

much larger non-vulnerable group. As the non-vulnerable group is much larger, many more people

399

are vaccinated per day under that assumption, causing the disease to decline more quickly and yet

400

still constraining the overall number of deaths.

401

402

We hope our analysis will encourage additional theoretical and empirically validated studies to

403

understand further how the demographic heterogeneity (by group or age structure) impacts the

404

epidemiological dynamics and outcomes of virus spread. Such analyses can include the associated

405

immediate effects of lowered transmission by lockdowns, both within and between different groups,

406

as well as the impact of choice of vaccination order on required lockdown lengths and sterilising/non-

407

sterilising effects of vaccination in preventing onward disease transmission. In particular, the impact

408

of choice of vaccination order on required lockdown lengths is worthy of substantial on-going inves-

409

tigation.

Optimal Control

510

The aim is to find an way to control infection (by minimizing disease-induced mortality) through

511

an epidemic under different transmission rates and increasing difficulty of vaccination delivery as

512

the number of vaccinated individuals increases.

513

Governing equations

514

We begin by introducing the governing equations (see main text for further details) We use an S-I-

515

R-V framework to describe the epidemiological dynamics. The dynamics for susceptible individuals

516

follow

dS
βS(t)I(t)
=−
+ σR(t) − µS(t) − ν(t)S(t)
dt
N (t)
517

The dynamics for infected individuals follow:

dI
βS(t − τ )I(t − τ )
=
exp(−µτ ) − (α + µ + γ) I(t)
dt
N (t − τ )
518

The dynamics for recovered individuals follow:

dR
= γI(t) − (ν(t) + µ + σ) R(t)
dt
519

and the dynamics for the total number of vaccinated individuals are:

dV
= ν(t)(R(t) + S(t)) − µV (t)
dt
520

where β is the disease transmission rate, σ the loss of immunity, µ is the background death rate,

521

ν(t)is the vaccination rate (on both susceptible and recovered individuals), τ is the incubation win-

522

dow, α is the disease induced death rate and γ is the disease recovery rate. N(t)=S(t)+I(t)+R(t)+V(t).

523

524

The objective functional is defined in terms of the rate of vaccination, the number of individuals

525

vaccinated and level of disease induced mortality such that during the epidemic of time length T

the ’costs’ of vaccination increase. The goal is to minimize these ’costs’ of vaccination and keep

527

where T is the length of the disease epidemic wave and Z is the critical level of daily disease induced

529

mortality that can not be exceeded.

530

531

To solve the optimization problem, a Hamiltonian operator (H) and adjoint system (see be-

532

low) are formed. As with all optimal control problems, the Hamiltonian operator is formed as

533

H = f (t, x, ν) + λg(t, x, ν), where f represents the ’cost’ function, g represents the governing equa-

534

tions (through time t for dynamical system x and control ν), and λ is a multipler function (Kamien

535

& Schwartz 2012). For the unstructured disease model, the Hamiltonian operator is:

H =

+ λ3 (γI(t) − (ν + µ + σ) R(t))
+ λ4 (ν(R(t) + S(t)) − µV (t))
537

Expressions for the characterization of the control are derived from minimizing the Hamiltonian

538

operator. Each adjoint variable (λi ) satisfies an equation found by differentiating the Hamiltonian

539

operator with respect to the corresponding state variable, and then negating this derivative:

The second derivative of H indicates the solution is a minimum as:
∂2H

∂ν 2

544

This is positive when V > 0, so solutions are determined as the number of vaccinated individuals

545

increases.

is reduced by (a) 20%, (b) 40%, (c) 60% and (d) 80%) on cumulative deaths. For vaccination to be
at all effective in reducing cumulative mortality (say 50K over 150 days) in the range of coverage
anticipated (Figure B 0.006 - 0.0152) then lockdown severity needs to reduce transmission by at
least 60% or lockdown durations need to be unduly long.

(a) – 50K mortality threshold, for a weakly efficacious vaccination rate (0.005), depending on the
severity of lockdown, lockdown durations could be 30 days (for 80% reduction in beta) or 70 days
(for 60% reduction in beta). At this level of vaccination (0.005) and for a lockdown where β is only
reduced by 20% or 40% it is not feasible to keep cumulative mortality below the 50K threshold.

Vaccine sequence to minimize cumulative mortality (below 80K) for varying duration

and severity of lockdown and vaccination rate. Sequence is to deliver vaccine to first group for
30 days, first and second group from 31-60 days and all groups after 60 days. Only moderately
severe (reducing transmission by 60%) or severe (reducing transmission by 80%) achieve optimal
control of mortality. Including non-vulnerable group (NV) in first or second phase of vaccination
achieves better control and can reduce the severity and duration of lockdowns. If front-line workers
(FR) are first in line for vaccination then the optimal sequence is shown in figure B . If vulnerable
group (V) is first in line then to achieve optimal control of mortality requires vaccination of nonvulnerable group before key worker group (figure D).[(purple line - 80% reduction in β, blue line 60% reduction in β, green line - 40% reduction in β]

Figure 6: Effects of declining vaccine demand uptake and length of lockdowns (in days) on cumulative virus-induced mortality (dashed line shows 50K threshold) for different lockdown severities
(as reductions in virus transmission during lockdown). Fixed (inelastic) vaccine demand always
leads to the lowest levels of cumulative mortality (red line). For declining (elastic) vaccine demand,
rapidly (exponential) declining vaccine uptake (blue line) leads to the largest difference from fixed
vaccine (compared to linear ((orange line) or polynomial declines (green line)). The effects of elastic vaccine demand on cumulative mortality can be offset by increasing length (days) and severity
(reduction in virus transmission) of lockdowns.
