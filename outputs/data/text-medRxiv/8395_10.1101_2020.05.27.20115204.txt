Abstract
Background
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic compounds Mexico’s pre-existing challenges: very
high levels of both non-communicable diseases (NCD) and social inequity.

Methods and findings
Using data from national reporting of SARS-CoV-2 tested individuals, we estimated
odds of hospitalization, intubation and death based on pre-existing noncommunicable diseases and socioeconomic indicators. We found that obesity,
diabetes and hypertension are positively associated with the 3 outcomes in a
synergistic manner. The municipal poverty level is also positively associated with
hospitalization and death.

Conclusions
Mexico’s response to COVID-19 is complicated by a synergistic double challenge:
raging NCDs and extreme social inequity. The response to the current pandemic
must take both of them into account both to be effective and to ensure that the
burden of COVID-19 not fall disproportionately on those who are already
disadvantaged.

Introduction
The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has already infected more than 14
millions of infected individuals and caused over 600 thousand deaths worldwide
[1]. There is a need to better understand who is at higher risk of worse outcomes,
including death. A recent study suggests that 22% of the global population is at risk
of developing severe COVID-19 based on underlying conditions, principally noncommunicable diseases (NCD); 4% of global population (included in the 22%) is at
high-risk based on the same conditions [2]. Poverty is associated with increased
prevalence of NCDs (and with obesity, another risk factor not considered in the
Clark et al study) but it also is associated with increased risk of infection, poorer
control of NCD and poorer access to quality health services, thus compounding the
impact on the poor [3].
Previous studies have reported that obesity and diabetes are associated
with greater COVID-19 disease severity [4-6]. Other positively associated
conditions that are also major contributors to the global burden of disease [7]
include: smoking, chronic cardiac disease, chronic pulmonary disease and chronic
kidney disease [8, 9]. An analysis of COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom found
that being male, older age, deprivation, uncontrolled diabetes and asthma
increased risk of death [10].
The reported prevalence of obesity in Mexico among individuals 15 years of
age and older is 32.4%, the second highest in the OECD, behind only the USA.
[11]. Data from the Mexican national health and nutrition surveys describe the
growth in prevalence of obesity since at least 2000; the growth is faster among
younger individuals [12].

Diabetes is the single largest contributor to disease burden in Mexico, with a
prevalence of about 15% of the adult population. Hypertension is also very
important, with a prevalence of 30%.
Previous analyses have highlighted major inequalities in health in Mexico,
as individuals with lower incomes face a higher probability of complications once
diagnosed with a non-communicable disease (NCD) and an increased financial
burden that affects their ability to adhere to treatment recommendations [13, 14].
Given COVID-19’s association with NCD, the fact that NCD are both more
prevalent and less well controlled among the poor, and the fact that the poor are at
greater risk of infection because they are unable to shelter in place without income
-- the pandemic is expected to further worsen the health of the poor compared to
those who are better off, increasing health inequality [3, 15-17].
The triad of NCD, inequality and COVID doesn’t occur in the context of a
high-functioning health care system, but rather one that is characterized by
fragmentation, under-funding, lax regulatory oversight and a high proportion of
poorly trained health personnel. The unfortunate result is low average health care
quality which translates into unacceptably high mortality rates for severe COVID-19
disease.
Using data from SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals in Mexico, our aim is to
estimate how NCDs and socioeconomic status can help to predict the likelihood
that a COVID-19 infection will result in severe disease.

Methods
We analyzed public data reporting all individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 in
Mexico compiled and published by the Directorate General of Epidemiology
(Ministry of Health). It is updated daily and included basic demographics and
comorbidities, in addition to the test result [18]. The reports also include place of
residence and whether the individual died. We only included adults age 20 and
older in our analyses as our interest is on whether NCD and inequalities are related
to worse outcomes among patients with COVID-19. The prevalence of NCD and
the incidence of severe COVID-19 disease are both very low among those under
20.
Testing for SARS-CoV-2 in Mexico at public facilities is only performed if the
individual has clinical symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. Thus, not all individuals
who ask for a test are tested, but individuals who were tested were included in the
dataset, albeit with variable reporting delays. It is important to note that included
cases represent both ambulatory and hospitalized individuals.
The dataset is comprised of cases from the national surveillance system in
which 475 clinical facilities in the country test at least 10% of all cases with mild
respiratory symptoms and 100% of cases with severe symptoms. Also included
are cases with severe symptoms reported from all clinical facilities not included in
the national surveillance system [19].
The dataset includes 35 variables: five variables related to identification of
the case (date of the report, unique case identifier, whether the testing facility was
a surveillance site or not, provider, state where the facility is located); ten variables
capture the demographic characteristics of the individual (sex, age, state of birth,

state and municipality (county) of residence, nationality, migration status, and, for
imported cases, country of origin and native language); for woman there is a
variable on current pregnancy; ten variables report pre-existing conditions obtained
by individuals self-report (diabetes, COPD, asthma, immunosuppression,
hypertension, cardiovascular, obesity, renal chronic disease, smoking, and other
conditions); two variable capture SARS-CoV-2 status (result of the test and if the
test subject reported contact with other case); and six variables related to COVID19 case management (reported date of first symptoms, if care was ambulatory or
in-hospital, date of hospitalization—for those hospitalized, date of death, intubation,
diagnosis of pneumonia, and if the patient required critical care).
Underlying conditions reported in the dataset are reported by facilities in the
country using their standard reporting procedures and did not include further detail
on those conditions (such as severity or whether the diagnosis was confirmed).
For the analyses we used the variables as reported. We excluded in the
regression analysis observations with missing values as those were a negligible
fraction of the database, at less than 0.5% of observations.
Descriptive statistics were produced for all tested individuals who have a
result and then separately, comparing those who tested positive and negative for
SARS-CoV-2. In order to take into account local epidemic dynamics, standard
errors for the descriptive statistics were produced taking into account clustering at
the municipality (county) level.
We estimated a mixed effects multivariate logistic regression to estimate the
probabilities of being hospitalized, intubated (for those hospitalized) and of dying
as a function of sex, age, comorbidities, health provider, whether the individual

speaks an indigenous language, and quintiles of the proportion of the population
living in poverty in the municipality (county) of residence. The model included
municipality random effects.
Both descriptive analyses and regressions were conducted using Stata 15.0
(Stata Corp). As the model includes multiple comparisons, we estimated the false
discovery rate using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure by comparing each pvalue to its Benjamini-Hochberg critical value, (i/m)Q, using 5% as Q [20].
For the percentage of the population living below the poverty line, we used
the official multidimensional measure in Mexico that includes income and six
measures of social deprivation (education, health, social security, housing, housing
utilities, and food security) produced by the Mexico´s National Council on
Evaluation of Social Policy [21] which classifies municipalities by the proportion of
individuals living in poverty.

Results
Characteristics of the 569,837 individuals who were tested for SARS-CoV-2
in Mexico through July 6, 2020 are reported in Table 1, comparing those with
positive and negative results (n=256,848 and 312,989, respectively). From the pool
of individuals tested, those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to
be male (54.51% vs. 46.98%, p < 0.001) and older (46.66 years vs. 42.38 years, p
< 0.001). While the percentage of individuals who speak an indigenous language
was low (1.0%), a higher proportion were SARS-COV-2 positive (1.12% vs 0.89%,
p < 0.01). The proportion of individuals living in poverty at the municipality (county)
level was similar between those who tested positive and negative.

In terms of health provider, 63.04% of individuals were treated at Ministry of
Health (MoH) facilities, 34.19% at social security facilities and 2.77% by private
providers. Among those who tested positive, 56.20% received care from the MoH,
40.88% from social security and 2.63% from private providers.
Individuals who tested positive to SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to have a
diagnosis of obesity (19.92% vs 14.65%, p < 0.001), diabetes (16.86% vs 10.00%,
p < 0.001), hypertension (20.68% vs 14.18%, p < 0.001), COPD (1.76% vs 1.61%)
and diagnosis of chronic renal disease (2.18 vs 1.92%, p < 0.001) compared to
those who tested negative. In contrast, they were less likely to report smoking
(7.89% vs 9.79%, p < 0.001), or asthma (2.71% vs 3.54%, p < 0.001). There was

Hospitalization
Being male was associated with an increased probability of being hospitalized (OR
1.70), and that probability increased with age, with an OR of 1.47 for those 30 to 39
years compared to 20 to 29 years, 2.77 for 40 to 49 years, 5.08 for 50 to 59 years,
9.68 for 60 to 69 years, 14.76 for 70 to 79 years, and 17.80 for those 80 years and
older (Table 2).

The odds of hospitalization were 2.62 for those obese, diabetic, and
hypertensive compared to those with none of those conditions, a higher probability
that for any of those conditions alone. Those with COPD were more likely to being
hospitalized (OR 1.39), while smoking alone was not associated with
hospitalization. Chronic renal disease was associated with a higher probability of
hospitalization (OR 2.49) as well as cardiovascular disease (OR 1.14).
Those cared for by social security and private providers were more likely to
be hospitalized (OR 2.74 & 2.69, respectively) compared to those from MoH
facilities. Individuals who speak an indigenous language were more likely to be
hospitalized (OR 1.36) compared to those who don´t. In terms of share of poverty
at municipality level, the odds of hospitalization increase with the share of poverty
which goes from OR 1.89 for individuals from municipalities with a share of poverty
between 40% to 59% up to OR 3.64 for those from municipalities with a share of
poverty of 80% and higher.

Intubation
Being male was associated with an increased probability of being intubated (OR
1.30) as was age, with the probability increasing monotonically to age 70 to 79 (OR
2.40) (Table 2). It is lower for those 80 and above, but not significantly, despite an
increase in mortality. That pattern is consistent with a reluctance to intubate
patients over 80 at comparable levels of severity.
Being obese, diabetic and hypertensive increased the odds of intubation
both as individual conditions and as comorbidities in a synergistic way: the odds
ratio for intubation was 1.73 for those who were obese, diabetic & hypertensive

compared to individuals with none of those conditions, higher than for any of these
conditions alone.
Neither asthma, no COPD nor smoking were related to the odds of
intubation among the analyzed individuals. Chronic renal disease was associated
with intubation (OR 1.15)
Being a patient in a social security institution was associated with a lower
probability of intubation (OR 0.20) compared to Ministry of Health facilities and
probability of intubation was higher for those cared for by private providers
(OR1.21). Compared to those from municipalities with the lowest share of poverty,
individuals from municipalities with higher shares of poverty were less likely to be
intubated; there was no association between intubation and speaking an
indigenous language.

Mortality
The probability of dying from COVID-19 was higher for males (OR 1.73) compared
to females and increased with age: odds of death compared to individuals 20 to 29
were 2.12 for those 30 to 39, 5.23 for those 40 to 49, 11.06 for those 50 to 59,
21.54 for those 60 to 69, 34.61 for those 70 to 79 and 48.21 for those 80 and older.
Speaking an indigenous language was associated with an increased probability of
dying (OR 1.40) (Table 2).
The odds ratio for dying from COVID-19 was 2.25 for individuals with a
diagnosis of obesity, diabetes & hypertension compared to those without any of
those conditions. Being only obese (neither diabetic nor hypertensive) had an odds
ratio of 1.67, for only diabetic it was 1.93, and for only hypertensive, 1.41.

Individuals with COPD were more likely to die from COVID-19 compared to
those that were neither smokers, nor COPD nor asthmatics with an OR of 1.30. In
turn, those with asthma but not COPD nor smoking were less likely to die from
COVID-19 with an OR of 0.87 and those with asthma, COPD and smoking had
also a lower probability of dying for COVID-19 (OR 0.42). Individuals with chronic
renal disease had an odds ratio of 2.27.
Compared to individuals from Ministry of Health services, those from social
security were more likely to die, with an OR of 2.51, while those from private
providers were less likely to die, with an OR of 0.86.
Regarding share of poverty at the municipality level, compared to those with
the lowest share of poverty, individuals from municipalities with a share of poverty
between 40% to 59% had an increased probability of dying with an OR of 1.61, as
well as those from municipalities with share of poverty between 60% to 79% and
those from municipalities with a share of poverty of 80% and larger, with ORs of
1.80 and 2.42, respectively.

Discussion
Given the high burden of NCD in Mexico, in particular obesity, diabetes and
hypertension, the results presented here represent a huge challenge for the county
in terms of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Mexico is behind only the USA among
OECD member countries in terms of prevalence of obesity among adults and has
the highest rate in the OECD for diabetes [11, 22]. While the reported prevalence
of these conditions among individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 in Mexico is lower
than the survey-based observed prevalence among the general population, it is

similar to the self-reported prevalence of prior diagnosis of these conditions. In
2018 these were: 22.8% for obesity, 10.3% for diabetes, and 18.4% for
hypertension [23].
As has been previously suggested, there is an urgent need to provide more
complete data on the comorbidities associated with COVID-19 severity [5], in
particular those NCDs that the evidence already suggests increase the probability
of severe disease and death. For example, there are likely to be important
differences by the severity of the comorbid conditions and/or by the type of
treatment the patient is receiving.
In addition to the weighty burden of NCDs, Mexico faces another enormous
challenge: social inequity. Wealth distribution in Mexico is one of the worst
worldwide; Mexico is tied with Chile for the most unequal income distribution in the
OECD [24]. Wealth inequity is the major driver of health inequity [25]. Poverty may
be linked to higher risk of dying for COVID-19 not only due to the fact that poverty
increases the probability of becoming infected because social distancing is more
difficult or because the poor are at higher risk of developing NCDs, but also
because individuals living in poverty have less access to public services, including
health services, and those health services that provide care to them are on
average of lower quality. Low-quality health-care is an important cause of
avoidable deaths in Mexico [26].
Mexicans who speak an indigenous language are five times as likely as
those who do not to be living in extreme poverty [27]. Both speaking an indigenous
language and living in a municipality (similar to a county in the USA) with 50% or
more of the population living in poverty were associated with increased mortality.

There are many possible explanations (preexisting health status, delays in
accessing care, and differential quality of care among the most important).
Because the poor are also less likely to access the social security or private health
systems, this compounds their mortality risk [27]. Our results are consistent with
similar studies reported for other countries: in Brazil, COVID-19 mortality has been
reported to be associated with ethnic background and region of residence [15].
Similarly, in the UK there is evidence of the pandemic disproportionally affecting
minority ethnic communities [28].
Mexico requires, as does the rest of the world, a precision public health
approach, one that take advantage of available data to design a response that
takes into account population characteristics as determinants of risk.
Lower mortality for those individuals with asthma, those who smoke, and
those with asthma, COPD and who smoke may be related to the fact that
individuals from these groups may be more likely to seek care earlier and to be
tested sooner because they are perceived to be at risk. However, the results are
also consistent with other studies that have reported lower risk among smokers
[29, 30]. Further analyses would be required to better describe these relationships.
This study has an important limitation. It is a study of COVID-19 patients in
Mexico and we are not able to correct for disease severity. Thus, when differences
are observed among institutions or groups, the difference could be due to
differential thresholds for seeking any health care, for hospitalization or for
intubation. For example, the higher mortality in the Ministry of Health hospitals
compared to the private sector could imply that the same patient, depending on
where they were hospitalized, would have a higher chance of dying in an MoH

hospital. However, it could equally well represent that a patient needs to be more
severely ill to be hospitalized in a MoH hospital than in the private sector. Thus,
one must be careful not to assume causality. That said, the significantly higher
morbidity and mortality associated with co-morbid conditions probably
underestimates their true effect, to the extent that physicians are likely to have a
lower severity threshold for recommending hospitalizing for a patient with
comorbidities. Additionally, as the national protocol mandates testing for all
individuals with severe respiratory conditions who present to health facilities as well
as a proportion of those with mild respiratory conditions, results may underestimate
how poverty is associated with COVID-19 prognosis as those living in poverty have
less access to health services. In terms of association with NCDs, this testing
protocol may also underestimate associations as those with mild respiratory
conditions will have a better prognosis. Our socioeconomic indicator, share of
poverty at the municipality level, reflects not the condition of the individual but that
of the county where she or he lives.
Mexico’s response to COVID-19 is stymied by a synergistic double
challenge: raging NCDs and extreme social inequity. The response to the current
pandemic must take both of them into account both to be effective and to ensure
that the burden of COVID-19 not fall even more disproportionately on those who
are already disadvantaged.
