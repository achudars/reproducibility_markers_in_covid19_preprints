ABSTRACT
In spite of high mortality from COVID-19, in Mexico the number of confirmed cases and
diagnostic tests per million population are lower than for other comparable countries,
which leads to uncertainty about the actual extent of the pandemic. In Mexico City,
healthcare workers represent an important fraction of individuals with SARS-CoV-2
infection. This work aims to estimate the frequency of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and
identify associated factors in healthcare workers at a large hospital in Mexico City. We
conducted a serological survey in a non-COVID national referral teaching hospital. We
selected a representative sample of 300 individuals. Blood samples were collected and
questionnaires were applied between August 10th and September 9th, 2020. ELISA
results indicate a serological prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection of 13.0%. Working in
the janitorial and security groups, having an educational level below a university degree,
and living with a larger number of people, were also identified as sociodemographic
factors that increase the risk of having SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, less favored
socioeconomic groups are at significantly higher risk of experiencing SARS-CoV-2
infection. Even in healthcare workers there is still a majority of individuals that are
seronegative, and thus the risk of continued epidemic waves and mortality remains
high.

INTRODUCTION
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in
Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 and is the cause of Coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 spread globally in early 2020, with the first cases reported
outside China on January 13th and 29th in South-East Asia and the Eastern
Mediterranean and on February 21st, 22nd and 25th in the Americas, Europe and Africa,
respectively1. The dynamics of infections have been different in each region. Since May
the Americas have occupied the first place worldwide in the number of COVID-19
deaths reported (as of November 6th, 650,705 deaths from a global death toll of
1,231,017)1. Countries in the Americas occupy three of the first four places in number of
deaths: the United States of America (USA) with 232,166, Brazil with 161,106 and
Mexico with 93,772 1. Quantified as number of deaths per million population, Brazil

occupies the 6th place globally with 757.9, Mexico the 9th with 723.1, and the USA the
11th with 701.4. However, the number of reported cases per million inhabitants in
Mexico (7,318.8) is much lower than that of the USA and Brazil (with 28,362.2 and
26,298.7, respectively)1. The number and criteria for conducting real time polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests in each country have also been different. As of October
30th, the estimates are 16.1 tests per million inhabitants for Mexico, compared to 456.0
for the United States and 30.2 for Brazil2. This smaller number of RT-PCR tests in
Mexico is related to a very high positivity rate of tests that was 41.3% on September 9 th
3.

This leads to much uncertainty about the actual number of COVID-19 infections that

have occurred in countries with low numbers of tests per million population.
In Mexico the first case was reported on February 28th 1. On March 31st extraordinary
government measures to attend the health emergency were taken: social distancing;
closing of all “non-essential” economic activity; the conversion of hospitals into exclusive
units for the management of pandemic patients, i.e. "COVID hospitals", and "nonCOVID hospitals” which would focus on non-COVID-19 patients requiring other medical
care; designation of the sentinel model of epidemiological surveillance1 and focusing
RT-PCR tests on people with symptoms3. There was a large impact to the economy
with Gross Domestic Product decrease in the second quarter of 18.7%, compared to the
same quarter of the previous year4. Healthcare workers (HCW) represent an important
fraction of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Mexico City5. Our institution is a
public national referral teaching hospital with 235 beds located in Mexico City and was
designated by the federal health authorities as a non-COVID hospital. Hospitals
designated as non-COVID delayed elective surgeries focusing on urgencies. Our
institution became one of the few public hospitals in Mexico City attending trauma
patients. Upon arrival at the emergency room, all patients and relatives were asked
about possible COVID-19 contacts, respiratory symptoms and comorbidities in order to
identify infection risk factors. During their stay at the emergency room patients were
clinically evaluated and then discharged to the next filter where they were swabbed for
the RT-PCR test. Non-COVID hospitals are not prepared to treat COVID-19 patients,
thus if any patient was identified as infected he or she was referred to a COVID hospital

if their symptoms required hospital attention, otherwise they were directed to self-isolate
at home and asked to come back once the infection subsided.3

Accurate epidemiological information is required to support public health actions aimed
at limiting contagion and loss of life, while minimizing negative economic impact to the
population1. With this purpose, serological surveys estimating SARS-CoV-2 infection
have been conducted in many places globally, finding for instance seroprevalence
levels of 4.1 %, in April in Los Angeles, California6, 6.9% in March7 and 22.7% in April8
in New York City, and 11.5% in May in Madrid, Spain9. Other studies of seroprevalence
quantified in the same city on several occasions find in Geneva, Switzerland for 5
consecutive weeks 4.8%, 8.5%, 10.9%, 6.6% and 10.8%, respectively10, and in London,
England for the 13th, 15th, and 18th weeks of 2020 1.5%, 12.3% and 17.5%,
respectively11. Studies carried out in HCWs in Denmark find seroprevalence of 29.7%
for emergency departments, and 2.2% for departments with limited or no patient
contact12; in Sweden 19.1% for a large acute care hospital, of which 21.0% for HCW
with direct patient contact, and 8.5% for those without patient contact13; in London,
England 34.7% in a clinical environment with prolonged direct contact with patients, and
22.6% in a non-clinical environment with minimal or no patient contact14; in Spain 10.2%
for HCW in general9; in the New York City area 13.1% for nurses, 8.7% for physicians,
12.6% for administrative and clerical, and 20.9% for service-maintenance personnel15;
in a tertiary care Center in Belgium 6.4%16. In Mexico there are yet no published
seroprevalence studies that allow for a more accurate description of the prevalence of
SARS-CoV-2 infections in a Mexican population.17
Regarding the characteristics of antibody responses, a cohort study18 showed SARSCoV-2 specific neutralizing antibodies in 94% of 175 patients with clinically mild COVID19 within 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms (30% of patients with very low level of
neutralizing antibodies, 17% medium-low, 39% medium-high, and 14% high). Other
studies have shown positive immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody tests of 100% for 285
patients with COVID-19 within 19 days after symptom onset19; and 94.3%, and 79.8%,
for immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG, respectively, by day 15 after onset20. A study

following 19 patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests found that 60 days later
11 (58%) of these patients became seronegative, while only 8 (42%) remained above
the seropositivity threshold.21

This work provides serological data from a non-COVID national referral teaching
hospital. Its main objective is to estimate the frequency of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in
HCW at a large non-COVID hospital in Mexico City. By conducting questionnaires with
the study participants, it also allows us to identify sociodemographic and other factors
associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections, as well as potential protection or risk factors for
this population. Given the limited availability of COVID-19 prevalence data in Mexico17,
the information presented here can be useful for the planning of public health measures,
including for institutions with similarities to this one.

RESULTS
Study population
The sample included a total of 300 participants, all of whom responded to
questionnaires and had Lateral Flow Assay (LFA) tests applied. Enzyme-Linked
Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) tests were conducted on 299 participants, since in one
subject it was not possible to extract enough blood volume for the ELISA test, but only
for the LFA test. As observed in Table 1, the largest work group strata were
administrative (21.4%), medical personnel (19.4%), and nursing (18.7%). The majority
of participants work in the morning shift (60.2%), are female (65.2%; in line with the
overall population working in the hospital), single (49.8%), belong to the 30-44 age
group (41.5%), and reported having a university bachelor’s degree or higher (72.9%), as
well as high levels of patient contact (69.6%).

Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies
The LFA tests resulted in a prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies of 11.0% (n=33). Of
these, 13 (39.4%) presented both IgM and IgG, 18 (54.5%) only IgG, and 2 (6.1%) only
IgM. For the ELISA test, which measures only IgG and not IgM, and considering the
result as a categorical variable according to the manufacturer’s threshold described in

the methods, the serological prevalence was 13.0% (n=39), slightly higher than with the
LFA test (Table 1). Considering the greater sensitivity that ELISA tests have over LFA
tests22 and the two cases from the LFA tests that were positive for IgM only (which is
not detected by this ELISA test), we obtain for this population a total serological
prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection of 13.7% (n=41 positives to IgG or IgM). Based on
the contacts reported by participants with positive results for the ELISA or LFA tests
(n=41), we estimate that 15 cases (36.6%) were likely to be infected outside the
hospital, 14 cases (34.1%) inside, and in 12 cases (29.3%) there is insufficient
information to estimate. Of these 41 positive subjects, 9 individuals (22.0%) reported
working additional shifts in other hospitals, 4 of them (9.8%) in a COVID hospital, and 5
(12.2%) in other non-COVID hospitals. Within these same 41 positive subjects, close to
half (n=19, 46.3%) reported the day of the blood sample not having experienced related
symptoms, nor suspected having had COVID-19 (Table 1).

Test comparisons
From our sample of 300 participants, 87 (29.0%) reported they had previously had RTPCR tests for SARS-CoV-2, 10 of them having positive results (11.5% positivity rate).
The median number of days between the date of the RT-PCR tests that were positive
and when the blood sample was taken in these 10 individuals was 93 days (range, 48117 days). The concordance between the 10 RT-PCR positive subjects and the ELISA
test was 8 (80.0%), slightly higher than with the LFA test which was 7 (70.0%).
Compared to the ELISA test, the LFA test had sensitivity of 79.5%, specificity of
100.0%, positive predictive value of 100.0% and negative predictive value of 97.0%.

Factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection
Remarkably, the security and janitorial work groups had substantially higher rates of
positive results (62.5% and 45.4%, respectively) than the other work groups (Table 1).
Additionally, participants with educational level below university degree also had higher
rates of positive results than those with a higher educational level (23.5% vs. 9.2%).
The variables that presented  coefficients with the strongest associative strength to the
level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies are: working in the security group, educational

level, the number of persons with which one lives, and the following symptoms: muscle
and joint pain, dyspnea, fever, conjunctivitis, olfactory alterations and dysgeusia (Table
2).

Table 3 shows two adjusted linear regression models using the ratio results of the
ELISA test. Both show that male participants had lower levels of IgG antibodies than
female participants. Reporting muscle and joint pain, and olfactory alterations were
significantly associated with increments in antibody levels. The level of antibodies also
increased with the number of people with which participants live. Model 1 shows
additionally that the janitorial ( = 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28-1.76) and
security ( = 1.10, 95% CI, 0.23-1.97) work groups were strongly associated with the
ELISA results. Exchanging the work group variable with the educational level in Model
2, all remaining variables present very similar associations than those in Model 1, with
the additional result that participants with educational level of a university bachelor’s
degree or higher had a reduction in the results of the ELISA test ( = -0.36, 95% CI, 0.67, -0.06) compared to those participants with lower educational levels.

DISCUSSION
In this work we provide results from a seroprevalence survey in a large non-COVID
teaching hospital in Mexico City. The ELISA results indicate that 13.0% of the sample
are positive to IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Considering also the results from the
LFA tests which identified additional subjects positive for IgM but negative for IgG
antibodies, we obtain an overall prevalence in our sample of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies of
13.7%. We consider this last estimate to more closely reflect the situation since it
combines the better sensitivity of the ELISA test, with the additional IgM information
provided by the LFA test. Our study also identified several associated
sociodemographic factors that increase the risk of having previous infection with SARSCoV-2: working in the janitorial and security groups, having an education level below
university bachelor’s degree, and living with a larger number of people.

A study with HCW in London found that 21.9% of seropositive subjects did not report
COVID-19 symptoms14. In this work, almost half (46.3%) of seropositive subjects had
experienced no symptoms and did not suspect they had previously had SARS-CoV-2
infection. These numbers underscore the importance of seroprevalence surveys
including asymptomatic subjects as fundamental in order to obtain accurate information
regarding the extent of infections in a population.17,23

Recent studies have found that seropositivity of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 decreases
substantially over a 60-day period of time21. Additionally, it is unclear whether all
patients with COVID-19 elevate antibodies, and in which time frame18,19,20,24. This
implies that in our current study we may not be capturing all the subjects that might
have been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, and therefore our result of 13.7%
prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 should be considered as a lower bound in terms of the
prevalence of previous infection to this virus. Another point that must be considered is
that given that the questionnaire and blood samples were taken the same day, we do
not have precise knowledge of the temporal sequence of events, and therefore a cohort
study would provide more clarity in this regard.

Our linear regression model based on the ELISA test indicates that male subjects tend
to have lower antibody scores than female subjects. This is in line with previous studies
finding that in some groups of COVID-19 patients the generation of IgG antibodies is
stronger in women than men25 and that in general women mount stronger immune
responses to infections and vaccinations.26

Compared with studies measuring seropositivity for HCW in other countries, the
antibody prevalence observed in our study for the whole hospital (13.7%) is within the
range of that found for other countries: 19.1% for a large hospital in Sweden13, 10.2%
for nationwide HCW in Spain9 and 6.2% for a tertiary care center in Belgium16. Since
our hospital was designated non-COVID, it is to be expected to have fewer infections
than in a hospital that was focused on COVID-19 patients (however, 9.8% of the
positive cases in our study reported working other shifts in a COVID hospital).

Additionally, there is still patient contact in our hospital, and some patients that later
were known to have positive RT-PCR tests were treated by the subjects in our sample.
Thus, in a sense it is more representative of the general population, as well as other
work environments where SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals occur randomly, rather than
being specifically grouped as in a COVID-19 hospital.

In addition to physiological factors that are known to be associated with COVID-19,
such as olfactory alterations, fever, muscle and joint aches, we find that the prevalence
of antibodies is associated with three sociodemographic factors: number of people with
which one lives, having an educational level below a university bachelor’s degree, and
type of work, with subjects working as janitors and security guards having substantially
higher risk than other personnel groups such as physicians, nurses and administrative
staff (Table 3). Both linear regression models we present here each reflect different
explicative variables: Model 1 with an emphasis of work groups within the hospital and
Model 2 of a socioeconomic factor that goes beyond their work in the hospital. Thus,
each model reflects different aspects of sociodemographic factors that imply that in this
population, less favored socioeconomic groups, i.e. those with lower educational level
and living with more people, are at significantly higher risk of being infected with SARSCoV-2. Interestingly, another seroprevalence study among HCW from the New York
City area15 also found that service/maintenance personnel (including, housekeepers
and groundkeepers, among others) had a substantially larger level of SARS-CoV-2
exposure (20.9%) than other professions such as physicians (8.7%) and allied health
professionals such as physical and occupational therapists (11.6%). This suggests that
the sociodemographic factors identified in our seroprevalence survey may also be
associated with higher SARS-CoV-2 exposure in other contexts, including other
countries.

Our sample can be representative of other non-COVID hospitals in other regions in
Mexico with similar degrees of contagion to Mexico City. Additionally, given the filters
limiting access to the hospital to COVID-19 patients, in the absence of other data it
might also provide relevant information to other non-healthcare institutions or

organizations with similar sociodemographic and educational breakups as our
institution. Seroprevalence studies in various populations can be a tool to provide useful
information for planning public health measures at institutional, regional and national
levels. By September 9th, which is the date our last blood sample was collected, the
number of confirmed cases in Mexico City was 107,613 which represented 1.2% of the
city’s population. Given the sentinel model of epidemiological surveillance that has been
followed by the Mexican authorities, the more than ten-fold difference between this
number and the 13.7% obtained in our study is not surprising and cannot be accounted
for as a difference caused by risks specific to HCWs. Although not representative at a
regional or national level, in the current absence of other data, this seroprevalence
survey provides useful information that can give a sense of the extent of the pandemic
in a specific segment of the Mexican population and contribute valuable information to
guiding public health policies.

METHODS
Study population
We performed a cross-sectional study, having as study population the personnel that
works in the hospital (n=3148). We assumed a positivity rate of 10% in the general
population, and a significance level of 5%, with which we calculated a sample size of
139. In order to increase the sample power, and given the lack of information about
COVID-19 prevalence in the Mexican population, we selected a final sample size of 300
subjects. The subjects in the sample were stratified in 10 groups according to their work
activities: administrative; scientific research; medical personnel; nursing; stretcherbearers and orderlies; technicians and laboratory personnel; therapists and patient
counseling; janitorial; security; and food services. We selected participants randomly
from each of the 10 work group strata, according to the size of each. Inclusion criteria
were: being personnel working in the hospital, from any shift, and granting written
informed consent. Participants were contacted by telephone, those that did not consent
to participate in the study were replaced by other participants selected by the same
randomized process. The study was approved by the hospital’s Ethics and Research
Committees (approval number INR-26/20, approval date July 6th, 2020) and was carried

out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations, including the Declaration of
Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Data collection
We scheduled selected participants between August 10th and September 9th, 2020, to
obtain a peripheral blood sample and complete a questionnaire. We conducted
procedures in a specially designated area, following World Health Organization safety
guidelines with both participants and study personnel: use of facemasks, physical
distancing, ventilated area, hand hygiene, etc.

Definition of variables
In the questionnaire, we explored sociodemographic variables, COVID-19 previous or
present signs and symptoms, diagnostic RT-PCR tests, comorbidities, status of
seasonal influenza vaccine, living arrangements (including number of people sharing a
home, family relationship, number of bedrooms), means of transportation, degree of
exposure to patients, use of personal protective equipment, number of meals per day,
physical activity, and hours of sleep. With the blood samples, we conducted two
serological tests, an LFA and an ELISA. The LFA tests were the COVID-19 IgG/IGm
Rapid Test Cassette® (Hangzhou Biotest Biotech Co. Ltd., China), which use an
immunochromatographic assay to provide qualitative detection of IgM and IgG
antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We considered a participant to be positive
with the LFA test if they had a positive result for either IgG, IgM or both. The ELISA
tests we used were the Euroimmun® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 NCP which detect IgG
antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (Euroimmun Medizinische
Labordiagnostika, AG, Germany). According to the manufacturer’s guidelines, a positive
result is one with a resulting ratio ≥ 1.1, negative ≤ 0.8 and the interval between these
values is considered uncertain. The ratio which results from this test was considered a
non-categorical continuous variable for the linear regression models.

Statistical analysis
We conducted all statistical analyses with Stata v13.0 (StataCorp, USA). We report
proportions of sample study groups and qualitative variables as percentages. We used
linear regression analysis to obtain unadjusted  coefficients, standard errors (Std. Err.),
95% confidence intervals (CI), and p values, in order to evaluate associations between
the variables and the resulting ratios of the ELISA tests. Those associations with p
values ≤ 0.25 were selected to adjust linear regression models. Each variable was then
incorporated into the model and those that had p ≤ 0.05 were retained. We tested with
an F statistic the fitting of the reduced models with an adjusted R2. Finally, and using
the thresholds established by the ELISA test manufacturer, we calculated the sensitivity,
specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the LFA.
