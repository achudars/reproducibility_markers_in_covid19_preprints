Abstract
The pandemic state of COVID-19 caused by the SARS CoV-2 put the world in

20

quarantine, led to hundreds of thousands of deaths and is causing an unprecedented

21

economic crisis. However, COVID-19 is spreading in different rates at different

22

countries. Here, we tested the effect of three classes of predictors, i.e., socioeconomic,

23

climatic and transport, on the rate of daily increase of COVID-19. We found that global

24

connections, represented by countries’ importance in the global air transportation

25

network, is the main explanation for the growth rate of COVID-19 in different

26

countries. Climate, geographic distance and socioeconomics had a milder effect in this

27

big picture analysis. Geographic distance and climate were significant barriers in the

28

past but were surpassed by the human engine that allowed us to colonize most of our

29

planet land surface. Our results indicate that the current claims that the growth rate of

30

COVID-19 may be lower in warmer and humid tropical countries should be taken very

31

carefully, at risk to disturb well-established and effective policy of social isolation that

32

may help to avoid higher mortality rates due to the collapse of national health systems.

Introduction

38

With the worldwide spread of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),

39

caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we are experiencing a declared pandemic. One of the

40

largest preoccupations about this new virus regards its notable ability to spread given

41

the absence of any effective treatment, vaccine and immunity in human populations.

42

Epidemiologists quantify the ability of infectious agents to spread by estimating the

43

basic reproduction number (R0) statistic [1], which measures the average number of

44

people each contagious person infects. According to the World Health Organization [2],

45

the new coronavirus is transmitting at an R0 around 1.4-2.5, which is greater than

46

seasonal influenza viruses that spread every year around the planet (median R0 of 1.28,

47

[3]). To anticipate the timing and magnitude of public interventions and mitigate the

48

adverse consequences on public health and economy, understanding the factors

49

associated with the survival and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is urgent.

50

Because previous experimental [4], epidemiological [5, 6] and modeling [7]

51

studies show the critical role of temperature and humidity on the survival and

52

transmission of viruses, recent studies are testing the effect of environmental variables

53

on SARS-CoV-2 [8, 9] and forecasting monthly scenarios of the spread of the new virus

54

based on climate suitability [10, but see 11]. Although temperature and humidity are

55

known to affect the spread and survival of other coronaviruses (i.e., SARS-CoV and

56

MERS-CoV, [12-15] using the current occurrences of SARS-CoV-2 cases to build

57

correlative climatic suitability models without taking into consideration connectivity

58

among different locations and socioeconomic conditions might be inadequate.

59

Many factors might influence the distribution of diseases at different spatial

60

scales. Climate might affect the spread of viruses given its known effect on biological

61

processes that influences many biogeographical patterns, including the distribution of

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.20050773; this version posted May 6, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

62

diseases and human behavior (e.g., [16]). Geographic distance represents the

63

geographical space where the disease spread following the distribution of hosts and has

64

also been found to explain biogeographic patterns [17-19]. Socioeconomic

65

characteristics of countries could be viewed as a proxy for the ability to identify and

66

treat infected people and for the governability necessary to make fast political decision

67

and avoid the spread of new diseases. Finally, the global transportation network might

68

surpass other factors as it can reduce the relative importance of geographic distance and

69

facilitate the spread of viruses and their vectors [20,21]. According to the International

70

Air Transport Association [22] more than 4 billion passengers traveled abroad in 2018.

71

This amount of travelers reaching most of our planet’s surface represents a human niche

72

construction (i.e. global transportation network; [23]) that facilitates the global spread

73

of viruses and vectors [20,21] in the same way it facilitated the spread of invasive

74

species and domesticated animals over modern human history [23].

75

The spread of SARS-CoV-2 from central China to other locations might be

76

strongly associated with inter-country connections, which might largely surpass the

77

effect of climate suitability. Thus, at this point of the pandemic, there is still a

78

distributional disequilibrium that can generate very biased predictions based on climatic

79

correlative modeling [24]. Thus, here we used an alternative macroecological approach

80

[25], based on the geographical patterns of exponential growth rates of the disease at

81

country level, to investigate variations on the growth rates of SARS-CoV-2. We studied

82

the effect of environment, socioeconomic and global transportation controlling for

83

spatial autocorrelation that could bias model significance. By analyzing these factors,

84

we show that the exponential growth of COVID-19 at global scale is explained mainly

85

by country’s importance in global transportation network (i.e., air transportation).

Material and methods
We collected the number of people infected by the COVID-19 per day from the

89

John Hopkins [26] and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC,

90

[27]). This data is available for 204 countries, for which 65 had more than 100 cases

91

recorded and for which time series had at least 30 days after the 100th case. We also

92

performed the analysis considering countries with more than 50 cases, but it did not

93

qualitatively change our results. Thus, we only show the results for countries with more

94

than 100 cases.

95

In our analysis, we only used the exponential portion of the time series data (i.e.

96

number of people infected per day) and excluded days after stabilization or decrease in

97

total number of cases. We empirically modelled each time series using an exponential

98

growth model for each country and calculated both the intrinsic growth rate (r) and the

99

regression coefficient of the log growth series to be used as the response variable in our

100

models. Because both were highly correlated (Person’s r = 0.97), we used only the

101

regression coefficient to represent the growth rate of COVID-19 in our study.

102

To investigate potential correlates of the virus growth rate, we downloaded

103

climatic and socioeconomic data of each country. We used climatic data represented by

104

monthly average minimum and maximum temperature (°C) and total precipitation (mm)

105

retrieved from the WorldClim database (https://www.worldclim.org) [29]. We used

106

monthly available data for the most recent year available in WorldClim. We extracted

107

climatic data from the months of January, February, March, and December to represent

108

the climatic conditions of the winter season in the Northern Hemisphere and the

109

summer season in the Southern Hemisphere. From these data, we computed the mean

110

value of climatic variables across each country. Finally, minimum and maximum

111

temperatures were combined to estimate monthly mean temperature for December,

112

January, February, and March, which was used in the model along with total

113

precipitation for the same months. However, using different combinations of these

114

variables (i.e., using means of minimum or maximum temperatures, as well as

115

minimum or maximum for each month) did not qualitatively affect our results.

116

We extracted socioeconomic data for each country. Human Development Index

117

(HDI) rank, mean number of school years in 2015, gross national income (GNI) per

118

capita in 2011, population size in 2015 and average annual population growth rate

119

between 2010-2015 were used in our study and downloaded from the United Nations

120

database (http://hdr.undp.org/en/data). We also obtained a mean value of health

121

investment in each country by averaging the annual health investments between 2005-

122

2015 obtained from the World Health Organization database

123

(http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.home). Due to the strong collinearity among some of

124

these predictors, HDI rank and mean number of school years were removed from our

125

final model.

126

Finally, we also downloaded air transportation data from the OpenFlights [30]

127

database regarding the airports of the world, which informs where each airport is

128

located including country location (7,834 airports), and whether there is a direct flight

129

connecting the airports (67,663 connections). We checked the Openfligths database to

130

make the airports and connections compatible by including missing or fixing airport

131

codes and removing six unidentified airport connections resulting in a total of 7,834

132

airports and 67,657 connections. We used this information to build an air transportation

133

network that reflects the existence of a direct flight between the airports while

134

considering the direction of the flight. Thus, the airport network is a unipartite, binary,

135

and directed graph where airports are nodes and flights are links (Fig 1, Fig S1). In the

136

following step, we collapsed the airports’ network into a country-level network using

137

the country information to merge all the airports located in a country in a single node

138

(e.g., United States had 613 airports that were merged in a single vertex representing the

139

country). The country-level network (Fig 1, Fig S1) is a directed weighted graph where

140

the links are the number of connections between 226 countries which is collapsed for

141

the 65 countries that had more than 100 cases and for which time series data had at least

142

30 days after the 100th case . Afterward, we measured the countries centrality in the

143

network using the Eigenvector Centrality [31], hereafter centrality, that weights the

144

importance of a country in the network considering the number of connections with

145

other countries and how well connected these countries are to other countries – indirect

146

connections. All networks analyses were generated using package igraph [32].

158

(OLS) after taking into consideration the distribution of the original predictors as well

159

as the normality of model residuals. Moreover, OLS residuals were inspected to

160

evaluate the existence of spatial autocorrelation that could upward bias the significance

161

of predictor variables on the model using Moran’s I correlograms [33]. Prior to the

162

analysis, we applied logarithmic (mean precipitation, total population size, and network

163

centrality) and square root (mean health investments) transformations to the data to

164

approximate a normal distribution.

166

Results

167

The models used to estimate COVID-19 growth rate on different countries

168

showed an average R2 of 0.91 (SD = 0.04), varying from 0.78 to 0.99, indicating an

169

overall excellent performance on estimating growth rates. The geographical patterns in

170

the growth rates of COVID-19 cases do not show a clear trend, at least in terms of

171

latitudinal variation, that would suggest a climatic effect at macroecological scale (Fig.

172

2A).

173

We build one model including only climate and socioeconomic variables, which

174

explained only 14% of the variation on growth rates. This model did not have spatial

175

autocorrelation in the residuals. When we added country centrality (i.e. country

176

importance in global transportation network) as a predictor, the R2 increased to 48.6%.

177

In this model, annual population growth and precipitation had positive and significant

178

effects (Table 1, P = 0.036, P =0.041, Fig 2), while health investments had a negative

179

and significant effect on growth rate (Table 1, P= 0.035, Fig 2). Here, exponential

180

growth rates increased strongly in response to countries importance in the transportation

181

network which has more than two times the effect size of any significant variable (Table

182

1). However, it is also important to note that growth rates of COVID-19 weakly

Discussion

201

The pandemic state of SARS CoV-2 is killing hundreds of thousands of people,

202

put the world in quarantine and is causing an unprecedented economic crisis. The rates

203

of increase of new cases of COVID-19 is faster in some countries than others. To

204

understand why growth rates are different among countries we investigate the effect of

205

climatic, socioeconomical and human transportation variables that could have important

206

roles on the exponential phase of COVID-19. At global scale, temperature, population

207

size and Gross National Income had no significant effect on the exponential phase of

208

COVID-19. However, annual population growth, health investments and precipitation

209

show significant, but weak effects on growth rates. Countries’ importance in the global

210

transportation network has a key role on the severity of COVID-19 pandemic in

211

different countries as it is strongly associated with the growth rates of the disease (Fig

212

2).

213

The centrality measure is widely used to discover distinguished nodes on many

214

networks, including epidemiological networks (e.g., [34]). Our findings reinforce the

215

importance of propagule pressure on disease dissemination [35, 36]. Aerial

216

transportation is an important predictor of COVID-19 dissemination in China [37], in

217

Brazil [38], and in Mexico [39]. It is quite likely that further phases of COVID-19

218

spread, in terms of peak of infections and decrease in mortality rates, will be better

219

related to socioeconomics characteristics of each county and their political decisions

220

when secondary transmissions were identified. We can already clearly identify the

221

effects of adopting strong social isolation policies in China (see [37]) and, on the

222

opposite side of this spectrum, in European countries like Italy, Spain and England [40].

223

Our analyses call attention to the case of Brazil, a well-connected tropical country that

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.20050773; this version posted May 6, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

224

presents one of the highest increase rates of COVID-19 in the tropics in its exponential

225

phase (Fig 2A). If decision makers take into consideration yet unsupported claims that

226

growth rates of COVID-19 in its exponential phase might be lower in warmer and

227

humid countries, we might observe terrible scenarios unrolling in tropical countries,

228

especially in those with limited health care structure, such as Brazil. As our results also

229

show, those countries that invested less in health are also the ones with faster growth

230

rates of covid-19 in its exponential phase (Fig 2, Table 1).

231

When discussing and modelling the effect of climate on SARS CoV-2 it is

232

important to remember that modern human society is a complex system composed of

233

strongly connected societies that are all susceptible to rare events. It is also critical to

234

consider the negative correlations between climate and local or regional socioeconomic

235

conditions (i.e., inadequate sanitary conditions and poor nutritional conditions) that

236

could easily counteract any potential climatic effect at local scales, such as lower

237

survival rates of viruses exposed to high humidity, temperatures and high UV

238

irradiation [8, 41] Tropical regions will experience mild climate conditions in a couple

239

of months. Thus, regardless of the influence of local environmental conditions, tropical

240

countries could still expect high contagious rates. In addition, our results points to a

241

positive effect of precipitation on growth rates, which is the contrary of what has been

242

suggested by climate suitability models. Finally, climatic suitability models might be

243

ephemeral for very mathematized modelling fields of science such as epidemiology and

244

virology that developed over time very realistic models that enables the possibility of

245

learning with parameters of similar viruses (i.e. SARS) that can definitely help and

246

instruct decision makers to take actions before it is too late.

247

Here we showed that countries’ importance in the global transportation network

248

has a key role on COVID-19 growth rates in its exponential phase. Our results reinforce

249

board control measures in international airports [42, 43] during exceedingly early stages

250

of pandemics to prevent secondary transmissions that could lead to undesired scenarios

251

of rapid synchronically spread of infectious diseases in different countries. The rapid

252

international spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from 2002 to

253

2003 led to extensively assessing entry screening measures at international borders of

254

some countries [44, 45]. The 2019-2020 world spread of COVID-19 highlights that

255

improvements and testing of board control measures (i.e. screening associated with fast

256

testing and quarantine of infected travellers) might be a cheap solution for humanity in

257

comparison to health systems breakdowns and unprecedented global economic crises

258

that the spread of infectious disease can cause. However, it is important to note that

259

board control of potentially infected travellers and how to effectively identify them is

260

still a hotly debated topic in epidemiology and there is still no consensus on accurate

261

methodologies for its application [46].

262

We do not expect that our results using a macroecological approach at a global

263

scale would have a definitive effect on decision-making in terms of public health in any

264

particular country, province, or city. However, we expect that our analyses show that

265

current claims that growth of COVID-19 pandemics may be lower in developing

266

tropical countries should be taken very carefully, at risk to disturb well-established and

267

effective policy of social isolation that may help to avoid higher mortality rates due to

268

collapse in national health systems.
