Abstract
Background: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a serious global health problem
that has negatively impacted the mental health of students.
Methods: We conducted an online descriptive cross-sectional study among 273 undergraduate
pharmacy students at the University of Zambia. A partial proportional odds regression model
was used to determine the predictors of anxiety. All statistical tests were set at 95% confidence
level (p<0.05).
Results: A response rate of 70% was obtained with the majority of the students being female
51.6%. Of the 273 respondents, 23.8% did not experience anxiety, 34.4% experienced mild
anxiety, 24.9% experienced moderate anxiety while 16.9% experienced severe anxiety about
COVID-19. It was also found that 61.2% of students reported that their attention to mental health
increased during the COVID-19 pandemic whereas 44.3% reported an increased resting time
with a significant reduction in relaxation 51.3% and physical activity 45.4% time. Factors that
affected mental health included; reduced family care (OR: 2.27; 95% CI: 1.09-4.74 ), not
changing attention to mental health (OR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.18-0.62), being in the final year of
study (OR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.13-0.84), reduced time of resting (OR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.26-3.50) and
feeling helpless (OR: 0.42; 95% CI:0.23-0.75).
Conclusion: COVID-19 negatively impacted the mental health and physical activity of
pharmacy students at the University of Zambia. This can have negative health and academic
outcomes for students going forward. Higher learning institutions and key stakeholders should
implement measures to aid students to recover from the impact of COVID-19 on their mental
health and physical activity.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) originated from Wuhan city, Hubei province of
China [1], with 27 cases of pneumonia of unknown cause identified on 31st December 2019
[2,3]. The causative agent of this infection was later named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [2,4,5]. This led to the naming of the disease as COVID-19 [6].
The main clinical presentations of patients suffering from COVID-19 at that time included dry
cough, sore throat, chest pain, dyspnoea, headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, bilateral
lung infiltration on imaging, and abnormal radiological findings [7–10]. Current findings have
reported clinical features such as myalgias, fatigue, abdominal pain, tachycardia, tachypnea, and
hypotension [11]. COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization
(WHO) on 11th March 2020 due, in part, to its rapid spread across the globe and relatively high
mortality rate among specific populations [6,12–14]. As a result, many countries instituted
lockdowns to prevent further spreading of COVID-19 [15,16].
There is strong evidence suggesting that COVID-19 has had adverse effects on the mental
wellbeing of individuals worldwide [17–21]. Some of the mental health problems observed were
illness anxiety disorder (IAD or formerly hypochondriasis), helplessness and horror, and the fear
of COVID-19 associated stigmatization [22–25]. Besides, some populations have reportedly
experienced psychological impacts including but not limited to; depression, anxiety, stress, and
mood swings due to the pandemic [18,22,26–29].
Some studies have shown that there is a positive relationship between physical activity and
mental health [30]. Physical activity plays a significant role in reducing the symptoms of mental
health illnesses [31]. Lockdowns and restrictions to movement during the COVID-19 pandemic
have affected the time that people spend resting, relaxing, and exercising [32,33]. Many people
experienced changes in their usual day-to-day routines, including physical activity, and that may
have contributed to mental health disorders in most populations [34].
As of 1st December 2020, the number of COVID-19 cases in Zambia was approximated at
17,647 with 357 deaths [35]. The rapid spread of COVID-19 and aforementioned lockdowns led
to the closure of schools, colleges, and universities worldwide [36,37]. This was done to prevent
further transmission and spread of the virus [12,38]. Unfortunately, the closure of learning

institutions has been reported to negatively affect the mental health and academic life of students
[39,40]. Many youths, the population of which the majority of the students comprises, have
experienced mental health problems due to COVID-19 [39]. Recent studies have reported that
students have experienced symptoms of anxiety, depression, stress, panic, and mood swings due
to COVID-19 and its negative effects on the education system [41–43]. This may in turn affect
the academic performance of the students compared to their performance before the COVID-19
era [44,45]. COVID-19 has disrupted many educational and extracurricular activities for students
[43,46,47]. However, most of the impacts of COVID-19 on academic performance will be
known during the post-COVID-19 era.
A literature search did not yield previous studies on the impact of COVID-19 on the mental
health and physical activity of students and other populations in Zambia. Thus, as an initial step,
we assessed the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health and physical activity of
undergraduate pharmacy students at the University of Zambia (UNZA) and reported them vide
infra. This was against a background that training of pharmacists in Zambia has over the years
largely been utilising traditional face-to-face teaching and learning, including experiential
learning in pre-clinical and clinical subject areas [48]. The restrictions and health risks imposed
by COVID-19 presented unique challenges not only for the facilitation of learning in schools and
universities but also to psychosocial wellbeing of the learners. Therefore, our study aimed to
assess the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health and physical activity of undergraduate
pharmacy students at the University of Zambia.
Methods
Study Design, Participants and Sampling
This was a descriptive cross-sectional study involving the undergraduate pharmacy students at
UNZA – the largest and leading public university in Zambia. Thus, the results of this study gave
an insight into the mental health and physical activity impact of COVID-19 on pharmacy
students. The study included all the enrolled cohorts of undergraduate pharmacy students at
UNZA, School of Health Sciences, that provided consent to take part in the study during the
academic year 2019 to 2020. UNZA is currently the major producer of Bachelor of Pharmacy

graduates in Zambia [48]. Undergraduate pharmacy students without access to the online
questionnaire were excluded from the study.
The study population was 410 pharmacy students, determined as follows: a sum of 90 second
year, 140 third year, 126 fourth year, and 54 fifth-year pharmacy students, cumulatively.
The sample size was determined using Yamane’s formula; n =

ଵାேሺ௘ሻమ [49]. A margin of error of

5% and a population of 410 were used. A 10% loss or non-response was anticipated. However,
288 students responded representing a response rate of 70%. From the 288 pharmacy students, a
total of 273 students managed to complete the questionnaire. 15 students did not complete
responding to the questionnaire.
Data Collection Tool
Data were collected using an online self-administered questionnaire that was adapted from
similar studies [39,41,50]. Firstly, the questionnaire was circulated to experts from the University
of Zambia to allow for content and face validation. The modified questionnaire was pre-tested
among 10 undergraduate pharmacy students at UNZA, who, later were excluded from the main
study. Student’s anxiety was measured using the generalised anxiety disorder 7-item (GAD-7)
scale developed by Spitzer et al., [51]. The GAD-7 scale is used to categorize anxiety into four
classes, namely; no anxiety, mild, moderate, and severe anxiety. Scoring of GAD-7 anxiety
levels was done from 0 to 21 and categorised as follows; 1-4 no anxiety, 5-9 mild anxiety, 10-14
moderate anxiety, and 15-21 severe anxiety. The questionnaire was used to collect data on sociodemographic characteristics and mental health and physical activity impacts of COVID-19 on
undergraduate pharmacy students from 1st August to 30th September 2020.

Data Analysis
Data were analysed using Stata/IC version 16 (Stata Corp., College Station, Texas, USA). The
significance level was set at alpha 0.05 and 95% confidence intervals.
For descriptive statistics, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) for continuous values (i.e age)
was calculated after testing for the assumption of normality using Shapiro-Wilk W-test and
graphically qq-plots. For the comparison of baseline characteristics across levels of anxiety, we
used the Kruskal Wallis test and Pearson chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test were appropriate
In order to choose a model to identify independent predictors of anxiety as a response with four
ordered categories. firstly the confounders to be included in the model were found by carrying
out backward elimination using the socio-demographic variables as candidates with a liberal pvalue (0.20) for exclusion, in order to ensure that all possible confounders were included. After
carrying out the backward elimination, forward selection (with the same liberal P-value of 0.20
for inclusion) was carried out to see whether any other possible confounders would be identified.
In this case, both backward elimination and forward selection identified the same model.
To get some idea of the effect of academic, social and family support factors, Proportional Odds
Models (POM) were then fitted for each of the factors separately, adjusting for the sociodemographic variables that had been identified. Thereafter backward elimination was carried out
with a stricter P-value for the exclusion of p=0.10 with age fixed in the model, irrespective of
whether it was still statistically significant or not. The model was then refitted and tested for
proportional odds assumption using the brant test. The model was found to be violating the
proportional odds assumption and therefore a partial Proportional Odds Model (PPOM) was
fitted. Each model’s fit was evaluated using the deviance test as well as the log-likelihood and
the pseudo R2.
Ethical Considerations
This study was approved by the University of Zambia Health Sciences Research Ethics
Committee (UNZAHSREC). Protocol ID: 2020310174. IORG no: 0009227 IRB no: 00011000
FWA no: 00026270. After IRB ethical approval, regulatory approval was obtained from the
National Health Research Authority (NHRA).

Results
Socio-demographic characteristics of study participants
The baseline characteristics of respondents by levels of anxiety are shown in table 1. A total of
273 respondents with a median age of 24 years (IQR, 22-27) were included in the analysis. From
the total, about 65 (23.8%) had no anxiety, 94 (34.4%) had mild anxiety, 68 (24.9%) hard
moderate anxiety and 46 (16.9%) had severe anxiety. There were more females than males 141
(51.6%). The majority were single 225 (82.4%), were in the third year of study 113 (41.4%),
lived in urban areas 156 (57.1%), lived with parents 178 (65.2%) and were unemployed 196
(71.8%). From the univariate analysis, there was evidence of a difference in residence (P=0.005),
marital status (p=0.024) and whether or not a respondent was living with their parents (P=0.022),
across all the levels of anxiety.
Academic life, social networks and family support by levels of anxiety
Table 2 shows the academic life, social networks and family support by levels of anxiety. We noted that
there were more respondents with no steady income 187 (68.5%), with reduced social support from
family 118 (43.5%), with reduced social support from friends 182 (66.7%), who were feeling helpless 189
(69.2%), had increased resting time 120 (44%), with reduced relaxation time 140 (51.3%), with reduced
academic performance 221 (81%) and with reduced physical activity 124 (45.4%). Across all levels of
anxiety, there was a statistically significant difference in steady income (p=0.014), social support from
family (p=<0.0001), social support from friends (p=0.026), helpless (p=<0.0001), resting time (p=0.001),
relaxing time (p=0.002), academic performance (p<0.0001) and exercise (p=0.017).

Factors affecting the mental health of undergraduate pharmacy students
Table 3 shows the results of the Partial Proportional Odds regression Model (PPOM). The loglikelihood ratio chi-square test LRX2(19)=95.77, p<0.0001 for this model indicates that the full
model shows a better fit than the null model with no independent variables in predicting the
levels of anxiety. The Wald test of parallel lines assumption for the final model: Chi-square test
= 29.27, df=32, p=0.606 indicates that the final model does not violet the proportional odds
assumption. Since academic performance violates the PO assumption its effect was allowed to
vary across the three binary models.

This model indicated that the factors associated with levels of anxiety among the respondents
were reduced care from family, not changing attention to one’s mental health, being in the final
year of study, reduced time of resting and feeling helpless.
Compared to increased family care, those who reported receiving reduced family care (aOR:
2.27, 95% CI: 1.09-4.74, p=0.029) and reduced resting time (aOR: 2.10, 95% CI:1.26-3.50,
p=0.005 ) were 27% and 10% more likely to be in higher levels of anxiety (i.e severe anxiety)
respectively adjusting for all covariates. The respondents who were in their final year of studies
compared to the second year (aOR:0.33, 95% CI: 0.13-0.84, p=0.020) and those not feeling
helpless (aOR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.23-0.75) were 67% and 58% less likely to be in higher levels of
anxiety respectively when holding other covariates constant. Meanwhile, a unit increase in age
was associated with increased odds of being beyond a particular category of anxiety (higher
category) by a factor of 1.04 though we could not rule out random chance finding (p=0.142).
Overall academic performance (i.e reduced compared to increased) was associated with 81% and
40% increase in the likelihood of a respondent being in higher levels of anxiety for the first (95%
CI: 3.12-30.88, p<0.0001) and second (95% CI: 1.23-13.28, p=0.021) binary models. On the
contrary, we noted a 27% reduced likelihood of being in higher levels of anxiety across the third
binary model (95% CI: 0.57-7.45) but this was not statistically significant (p=0.266).

Discussion
We assessed the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and physical activity of
undergraduate pharmacy students at the University of Zambia. We found that the factors
associated with levels of anxiety among the students were reduced care from family, not
changing attention to one’s mental health, being in the final year of study, reduced time of
resting and feeling helpless. Currently, COVID-19 has caused many negative impacts on the
education sector and other sectors across the globe.
Mental health
Our study established that COVID-19 has affected the mental health of pharmacy students and
reduced their time to do physical activity. Though this was expected, it is the magnitude of the
impact on mental health that is noteworthy. Our study found that 76.2% of the students
experienced the anxiety of which the majority (34.4%) had experienced mild anxiety. Our survey
further found that many students felt helpless (69.2%) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic
spreading in Zambia. Previous studies have also reported that COVID-19 affects the mental
health of students. A study in China reported that most of the students (21.3%) experienced mild
anxiety [41]. Another study in China reported overall anxiety of 26.0% with the majority of the
students (23.2%) experiencing mild anxiety [52]. The study further reported that students had
experienced depression due to the impact of COVID-19 [52]. Xiao et al.reported that anxiety
prevalence among medical students was 17.1% and depression was 25.3% [53]. In Bangladesh,
Khan et al.(2020) reported that 33.3% of the students experienced anxiety [54]. Further, other
mental health disorders such as depression, stress, and event-specific distress were reported.
Similarly, in Pakistan, Waseem et al. (2020) reported that 53.0% of undergraduate medical
students experienced stress as a result of COVID-19 [42]. Our survey and other similar studies
reported that students experienced mental health problems associated with COVID-19. However,
the prevalence of mental health problems reported in our study is higher than the ones reported in
similar studies. This difference could be because our setting is resource-constrained. Also, the
prevalence of anxiety in our study may have been higher since the pharmacy students
experienced online learning for the first time.
The mental health problems reported in our study were mainly associated with reduced care from
family members, not changing attention to one’s mental health, being in the final year of study,

reduced time of resting and feeling helpless. Similar studies reported that mental health problems
could have been affected by factors such as fear of contracting the virus [55], social distancing
[53], economic impacts of COVID-19 [56], fear of delayed academic progression [41], fear of
poor academic performance [45], and impact of COVID-19 on family and social networks [39].
Mental health problems associated with COVID-19 have been reported in different populations
including healthcare workers [57,58] and the general population [59]. Therefore, this indicates
that COVID-19 has impacted the mental health of different populations of people.
Physical activity and mental health
In this survey, the majority of the students’ attention to mental health (61.2%) and time to rest
(44.3%) has increased as a result of COVID-19. However, most of the students reported that
their time to relax (51.3%) and exercise (45.4%) had reduced. It was found that the students
spent more time resting, but very little time relaxing and exercising. Physical activity has been
linked to the improved mental health of human beings [60–63]. Additionally, physical activity
reduces mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, social withdrawal, low self-esteem,
and mood swings [64,65]. Even minimal physical activities while staying at home can be
performed so that individuals remain active during the pandemic [66,67]. However, due to
COVID-19, preventive measures such as social distancing and restrictions in movements meant
that students spent their time at home and had no access to physical exercising facilities like a
gymnasium. This caused their resting time to increase while the exercising time reduced and thus
may have resulted in anxiety. Similarly, other studies reported that there has been a significant
reduction in physical activity as a result of quarantine [61,66,68]. This reduction in physical
activities is one of the contributing factors to the reported mental health problems due to
COVID-19. There is evidence that indicates that reduced physical activity increases the risks of
mental health problems among students [64]. Since many schools, colleges, and Universities are
now open in Zambia, students must practice simple exercises while observing the preventive
measures of COVID-19.
Implications on educational policy and practice
The importance of good mental health and wellbeing in cognitive development cannot be
understated. With existing evidence showing that the majority of undergraduate pharmacy

students at UNZA predominantly utilise a strategic approach to learning - an attribute
characterised by a focus on achieving and fear of failure [48], it was a cause for concern that the
negative impacts of COVID-19 on the mental health of students could further affect their
cognitive development, approaches to learning, and academic outcomes. We, therefore, argue
that that educational policy and practice amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond should
consider adopting an instructional design that influences and enhances mental resilience in
addition to the attainment of meaningful learning outcomes, critical thinking and effective study
skills among pharmacy students [48]. We further contend that in addition to modifying the above
facets of the learning environment at the university, extra consideration should be given to
provide psychosocial support to students negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Strengths and limitations of the Study
This is the first study to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health and physical
activity among Zambian students and it has highlighted the need to pay attention to the mental
health of students not only during COVID-19 pandemic but even beyond. Further, the study did
not only indicate the prevalence of anxiety among pharmacy students due to COVID-19, but it
also explored the factors that independently predict the anxiety levels among these students.
Since we conducted the study among pharmacy students, the results cannot be generalised to
other students doing different programmes. The online nature of the study meant that certain
students had no access to the questionnaire and were, therefore, not part of the study. The study
findings may not represent the future academic outcomes of undergraduate pharmacy students.
Conclusion
This study found that the COVID-19 negatively impacted the mental health and physical activity
of undergraduate pharmacy students at the University of Zambia. Our study established that
students experiencing anxiety associated with COVID-19 risk were more likely to have poor
academic outcomes and progression. Institutions of higher learning and other stakeholders must,
therefore, put in place measures to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 on the mental
health and academic life of students. We will continue to monitor this and other post-COVID-19
effects on educational processes and outcomes in future.
