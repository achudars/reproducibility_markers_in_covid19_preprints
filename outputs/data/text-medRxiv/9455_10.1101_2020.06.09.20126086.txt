Title of manuscript- Private Health Sector in India- Ready and willing, yet underutilized in the
Covid-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study.

Abstract
Background: The private medical sector is a resource that must be estimated for efficient
inclusion into public healthcare during pandemics.
Methods: A survey was conducted among private healthcare workers to ascertain their views on
the potential resources that can be accessed from the private sector and methods to do the same.
Results: There were 213 respondents, 80% of them being doctors. Nearly half (47.4%) felt that
the contribution from the private medical sector has been suboptimal. Areas suggested for
improved contributions by the private sector related to patient care (71.8%) and provision of
equipment (62.4%), with fewer expectations (39.9%) on the research front. Another area of
deemed support was maintaining continuity of care for non-COVID patients using virtual
consultation services (77.4%), tele-consultation being the preferred option (60%). 58.2% felt that
the Government had not involved the private sector adequately; and 45.1% felt they should be part
of policy-making.
Conclusion: A streamlined pathway to facilitate the private sector to join hands with the public
sector for a national cause is the need of the hour. Through our study, we have identified gaps in
the current contribution by the private sector and identified areas in which they could contribute,
by their own admission.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has consumed and exhausted widespread national
health resources with unprecedented speed, and is expected to leave lasting consequences on
global health, economy and growth. 1 The massive losses 2 call for the amalgamation of rapid
innovations alongside bold public health measures led by a courageous political will to tackle this
unique “War sans Weapon” situation. 3 As of May 28th 2020, India has reported 158,332 COVID19 cases, 4 a number that is rapidly rising, consuming the public healthcare system, which has
been at the fore of this pandemic, despite deficient infrastructure, manpower and poor resources.
5,6
Amongst other countries, India currently ranks fourth with regards to daily increase in the
cases. 7 With an availability of 0.55 public-hospital beds to 1000 population 8, it is not
unreasonable to expect that the public sector may not be able to provide effective, sustained and
uninterrupted healthcare in the face of the rising numbers. Not surprisingly, countries ahead of us
on the pandemic curve have recognized the need to utilize all available healthcare resources,
forging partnerships between public and private healthcare sectors.
In India, the healthcare scenario has transformed over the last few decades, 9,10 and almost 87%
services are provided in the private sector, making it a major stakeholder. 11 The first decade of
this century saw a growth in private sector beds by almost 70%, bringing their total share to nearly
63%.12 Although healthcare professionals in private enterprises are best suited to provide insights

into potential areas of access from the private sector and methods to do so, yet there voices are
seldom heard in the scientific world. Improvements in outcomes and health indicators have been
reported after private-public partnerships (PPP) in previous reports. 13 The National Health Policy
(NHP) 2017 not only advocates for exploring role of PPP in achieving Universal Health Coverage
(UHC),14 but PPP has also been proposed as an efficient model for disaster risk reduction. 15,16
The present survey was conducted to explore the opinions and preparedness of healthcare workers
(HCWs) in the private sector, on public-private partnerships (PPP) to provide a sustained,
uninterrupted healthcare response in the face of the current pandemic.

Methods
Study population selection
An online survey was conducted in April 2020, and a pre-tested, content validated questionnaire
was circulated over WhatsApp® groups of healthcare professionals (doctors, nurses, technicians,
students and administrators amounting to nearly 2000 individuals) in the private hospitals across
India.17 The participants were requested to provide an informed consent at the beginning of the
survey. We did not offer incentives for participation.
Questionnaire design
The questionnaire featured 20 questions, of which five identified respondent characteristics.
Fourteen items were multiple choice, with one being open-ended. The average time to complete
the survey was five minutes. The respondents could change the answers before submission but not
after it. Internet Protocol addresses were checked to avoid duplication of responses. Content
validity of the survey questionnaire was performed using Lawshe’s method and confirmed by
three professors and one undergraduate medical student. The validated survey questionnaire was
pre-tested among five HCWs, and the identified errors in wording, grammar or syntax were
rectified. The 'Logics' feature available on Survey Monkey® allowed respondents to skip to a
specific question on a later page based on their answer to a previous close-ended question.
Descriptive statistics were performed, and the results were expressed as numbers (percentages).
The data/figures were downloaded from surveymonkey.com®.
Ethics approval
Exemption from review was obtained from the institute ethics committee [2018-62-IP-EXP] as
per local guidelines. We adhered to the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-surveys to
report the data. 18

Results
The participants included doctors (80% of the 213 respondents) (age 35 years + 11.1), and nurses
or medical students (20%). Nearly half (47.4%) felt that the contribution from the private medical
sector has been suboptimal. Suggestions for improved contributions included patient care (71.8%)
and provision of equipment (62.4%), and research (39.9%). (Figure 1)
Participants suggested increased involvement in screening (69.6%), testing (69.1%), intensive care
(61.31%) and non-intensive-care (59.52%) beds. Some (36.3%) felt that effective home outreach
services could also be provided.
Participants believed that the private healthcare sector could provide insights into new testing
methods (67.2%), vaccines (60.3%) and new or repurposed drugs (55.2%). Most participants
(67.3%) preferred use of their financial contribution for subsidized treatment of patients while
only 31% favored donation to public agencies.
Most respondents felt that they could play a significant role in educating healthcare workers,
medical students, and the community. Another area of deemed support was maintaining continuity

of care for non-COVID-19 patients, using virtual consultation services (77.4%), teleconsultation
being the preferred option (60%).
More than half (58.2%) felt a need for greater involvement of the private sector in the pandemic
response including policy making. Nearly half of the participants had made monetary donations
for the pandemic from their personal funds (48.2%). Teleconsultations were being offered by 13
doctors. More than a third (37.36%) felt that they wanted to contribute more towards the
pandemic response, and as many as 75% were keen to donate blood.

Discussion
In our e-survey assessing the opinions and readiness of HCWs in the private healthcare sector, we
found that participants felt that they had not contributed enough and were positively inclined to
participate in the pandemic response. They expressed readiness to participate in screening, testing,
patient care, support for equipment and clinical trials of newer drugs as well as repurposed
medicines, vaccines or newer diagnostic tests.
While testing and tracing contacts remains the primary public health response to an infectious
disease pandemic, over 3 million samples have been tested in India since January 2020 19.
Although we have attained testing capacity of 1 lac samples per day, it would still take more than
three and a half years to test10% of the population. This appears to be an optimistically
conservative but inadequate strategy in a country with more than 1.3 billion susceptible
individuals. 20,21 Collaborations between government and private healthcare centers can
decentralize screening and testing facilities, offloading central agencies while increasing the
capacity and outreach.
While the public sector has been holding forte in the past few months, the need for additional
resources is being increasingly felt. The private healthcare sector has significant potential,22–24
with 58% of the hospitals, 29% of the beds and 81% of doctors.25 Under severe strain, similar
collaborations have been forged in Italy, Spain and several other countries.26 27 A similar exercise
in India would be a prudent way ahead in these times.
A large number of blood banks are in the private healthcare sector in India, and it might be
worthwhile to explore the conversion of private blood banks into specialized units for the
promising convalescent plasma donation therapy, if efficacy is proven in ongoing clinical trials.
This will not only tide over the ongoing acute shortage of blood products but also be a sustainable
source of convalescent plasma for therapy in severe COVID-19. In fact, a vast majority of
respondents expressed their willingness to donate blood to tide over the acute shortage of blood
products in present times.
While most public facilities are busy in COVID-19 care, patient with non-COVID ailments have
faced neglect and apathy. Private healthcare respondents are willing and prepared to participate.
Additionally, a forward triage protocol using tele-medicine services may in-fact hearald a
revolution for a large number of technology-enabled non-COVID patients. In the Western world
too, teleconsultations are being increasingly preferred as means of avoiding congestion in public
spaces. 28 Although lower literacy levels and traditional patterns of doctor-patient interactions are
a challenge in providing effective home-based outreach care in India, yet the scope of mobile
networks and empowerment by these hand-held computers cannot be underestimated.2930
Nearly two-thirds of the respondents felt that the private sector could leverage its financial
resources by providing free or subsidized treatment to patients. While the Government makes
efforts to meet the requirement of ventilators, stuttering from the onslaught of paused supply from
Europe and China, it is prudent to recognize and utilize the dormant resources lying in the private
hospital intensive care. 31–33 Further, private laboratories and research facilities, encouraged to
develop new cost-effective and rapid high through-put testing methods, should start showing
results soon.
In unusual times such as this, lessons could be learnt from past experiences. During the influenza
pandemic of 2009, all dealings in India were restricted to the public sector to keep track of cases

while ensuring affordable healthcare. This eventually led to an infrastructural deficit, and the
consequent need to amend policies to include support from the private sector.34 Such experiences
from previous epidemics have probably contributed to our HCWs believing that the private sector
in India can participate in a more significant manner.
Strengths and limitations
This is the first survey including a wide set of stakeholders in the private healthcare sector and in
our opinion, it is an important move in the right direction to ascertain willingness and
preparedness.
The results, subject to opinionated biases of a small set of young technology-empowered
respondents, largely doctors are nevertheless enlightening and encouraging. Further, since this
survey was electronically distributed, it has the advantage of a diverse representation of voices
across the country, and yet opinions may be influenced by differential approach determined by
local state policy.

Conclusion.
In the face of an unprecedented disease, with mystical transmissibility and unprecedented ability
to devastate the human population, it is not surprising that the public healthcare sector is under
more stress than it can handle alone. We have a large private healthcare sector in our country
which is not only equipped but also willing, to share the burden of disease. Thus, a pragmatic
approach to facilitate the private-public partnership will go a long way in mitigating the
community impact and reduce mortality in current times. An open, healthy and swift discussion
between the public and private sector should be the first step towards sorting grey areas.
