Abstract:
Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic continuing to be a significant public health concern
across the whole world, including India. In the absence of any specific treatment or vaccine
against COVID-19., the role of efficient testing and reporting has been uncontested so far as
the number of cases is rising daily. In order to strengthen the screening activities and to
prevent nosocomial infection, facility-based screening centres have been designed and
operated at various level of healthcare, including tertiary care institutions.
Methods: The present study has been planned with an objective to understand the patient
profile and evaluate the functioning of COVID-19 screening OPD(CS-OPD) at a tertiary care
hospital. In this hospital-based retrospective study, data from individuals visiting the
COVID-19 screening OPD during the period from 17th March 2020 to 31st July 2020 were
collected. We documented and analysed relevant demographic, epidemiological and clinical
characteristics of the patients.
Results: A total of 10,735 patients visited the COVID-19 screening OPD during the defined
study period out of which 3652 individuals were tested. Majority of the patients, i.e. 65.67%
(7050) were male and in 15-59 years age group (84.68%). Most common symptoms among
patients visiting CS-OPD was Cough (9.86%). Out of the total, 17.17% (1843) of patient
reported to the CS-OPD with contact history of COVID-19 positive patient. On the other
hand, 13.49% (1448) of patients were with either domestic or international travel history.
The overall testing rate and positivity rate for CS-OPD during this period were found to be
34.02% and 7.94% respectively.
Conclusion: The clinical, demographic and epidemiological characteristics of patients
visiting CS-OPD varied across the study period depending upon the containment and testing
strategy. The CS-OPD played a crucial role in preventing nosocomial infection and
maintaining non-COVID care at the tertiary care hospital.

Background:
The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, previously
known as 2019-nCoV, also known as COVID-19) has rapidly spread in India, with
unprecedented propagation, because of its highly infectious nature. The World Health
Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic on 11th March 2020. On 30th
January 2020, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was detected in India. (1) The state of
Odisha identified the first case of COVID-19 on 15th March 2020. (2) With a rising number
of cases, the need to screen all patients with respiratory symptoms and travel history was
recognised. One effective strategy was the establishment of fever clinics or COVID-19
screening centres. These screening centres were assigned to screen patients based on a
standard criterion. With increasing instances of nosocomial outbreaks of COVID-19, it has
become even more important to screen all patients with suspected infectious disease in the
hospital setting and for control and prevention of infection in the community. (3)
As pandemic alert was sounded in India and patient screening in health facilities was
strongly recommended, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), India issued
guidelines for setting up COVID-19 screening centres at healthcare settings. The purpose of
these Screening Centre was to (a) Attend to patients of influenza-like illness in a separate
area from the general outpatient department(OPD),(b) To facilitate implementing standard
droplet precautions,(c) To triage the patients,(d) Collect samples. (4)
Based on these principles, health care institutions have developed and implemented a
hospital-specific systematic process for screening and managing suspected COVID-19
patients. (5)(6) However, till now there is limited published literature regarding functioning
and patient profile of these COVID-19 screening facilities, especially at tertiary care
institutions which are significantly involved in both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 services
simultaneously. (7) Hence, we planned this study to understand the patient profile and
evaluation of COVID-19 screening centres at a tertiary health care institution.

Materials and methods:
This study was conducted in the COVID-19 screening Outpatient department (CS-OPD)
under the Department of Community & Family Medicine at All India Institute of Medical
Sciences (AIIMS), Bhubaneswar. AIIMS Bhubaneswar is a 922 bedded tertiary care
institution in the state of Odisha which caters for approximately 1.2 million outpatients,
30,000 inpatients and 40,000 emergencies per year.
The AIIMS, Bhubaneswar CS-OPD was made functional from 17th March 2020. The main
objective of CS-OPD was to maintain the function of the tertiary care institution through
segregating COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 patients through screening before their
admission or entry into the hospital. The functioning of the CS-OPD was based on standard
operating procedures devised by the COVID-19 management committee of the institution
with the help of all the guidelines and protocol notified by Indian Council of medical
research (ICMR) and MOHFW. A two-level of screening system was made operational as
the number of cases started to rise in the state. As part of the first level of screening, all the
patients and their attendants were screened at the entry gate of main OPD by paramedical
staffs based on three criteria, i.e. travel history, contact history and complaint of fever (by
measuring body temperature with the help of infrared thermometer). Patients needing
immediate hospitalisation were referred to Trauma and Emergency ward for screening and
treatment. Based on the first level triage result, the patient was either referred to CS-OPD for
second-level screening by medical officers (if any of the suspect criteria was present) or
inside the main OPD building for further treatment (if none of the suspect criteria was
present). Patient or visitor could also directly visit the CS-OPD and was also referred by
clinicians from their OPD. From 15th June 2020 onwards, all the patients requiring
admission, surgical interventions or day-care procedures were also referred to CS-OPD for
COVID-19 testing.

The CS-OPD was situated in a standalone building in the peripheral zone of hospital
separated from other general OPDs with separate entry and exit point to prevent possible
cross-infection. The CS-OPD was broadly divided into the following four zones:
Registration-cum-report collection zone, OPD zone, Sample collection zone and Control
room-cum-nursing station zone. (Figure-1) A total of 21 staffs from the existing pool of
AIIMS, Bhubaneswar has been designated to work at CS-OPD and to ensure its proper
functioning. (Table-1). Patient at CS-OPD/she was managed as per the algorithm explained
in Figure-2. (Figure-2) The CS-OPD was operational from 8.00 AM to 2.00 PM every day.
Patients were categorised into "Suspect" and "Not-a-suspect" case for COVID-19 based on
travel history (In last 14 days), contact history (In last 14 days) and relevant symptoms
suggestive of COVID-19 (fever, sore throat, cough, dyspnoea, loss of taste/smell). A
suspected case was categorised into ICMR specified categories and referred to the sample
collection zone. (Figure-3) The nasopharyngeal swab samples are collected in two sessions,
i.e. 8.00 AM-11.00 AM and 11.00 AM-2.00 PM. All the samples are sent to the ICMR
approved Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDL) of microbiology department
under a proper cold-chain system. All the samples are tested by Reverse TranscriptasePolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method.
The present study is a hospital-based retrospective study in which all the patient-related data
of subjects attending COVID-19 screening OPD during 17th March 2020 to 31st July 2020
were collected and analysed. Any patient with incomplete or missing data or duplicity were
being excluded from the study. At the time of patient examination, the staffs input the data,
such as the presence of COVID-19 symptoms, travel history and a history of contact with
COVID-19 patients, after interviewing the patient. The study used standard case definitions
and categories for sample collection as advised by the MOHFW and ICMR. (8)(9) (Figure3)
All the extracted quantitative data were administered in Microsoft excel along with the
relevant variables mentioned. Data analysis was performed by SPSS version 23. Analysis of

socio-demographic variables as well as variables related to COVID-19 screening services
was expressed using descriptive statistics like mean, median, proportion and relevant
graphical presentation. Personal identifiers for the patients were removed from the data set
after data extraction to maintain privacy and confidentiality. The institutional ethical
committee of AIIMS, Bhubaneswar approved this study (Reference number: T/IMNF/CM&FM/20/72).
Results:
A total of 10,735 patients were screened for COVID-19 during these 136 days (17th March
2020- 31st July 2020). A median of 57 (IQR=93.00) patients visited CS-OPD every day. Out
of them, majority, i.e. 65.67% (7050) were male and in 15-59 years age group (84.68%). The
median age among male and female patients visiting CS-OPD was 34.00 (IQR=22.00) and
33.00 (IQR=20.00) years, respectively. Most common symptoms among patients visiting
CS-OPD was Cough (9.86%) followed by fever (9.30%). However,79.23% (8505) of the
patients were without any specific symptoms relevant to COVID-19. Out of all, 17.17%
(1843) patient reported to the CS-OPD with contact history of COVID-19 positive patient.
13.49% (1448) of patients were with either domestic or international travel history within the
last 14 days of visit to CS-OPD. (Table-2)
The seven days moving average for the number of patients with travel history was higher
initially in March 2020 (range:2.4-8.4) followed by a decrease during April 2020(range:0.71.7). However, it showed an increasing trend from May 2020 till the first week of July 2020
(range:1.7-42.1). Similarly, the seven days moving average for the number of patients with
contact history was stagnant during March 2020 to May 2020 (range:0-4.6). But it peaked
during June 2020 and the first week of July (range:1.6-73.3). Similarly, for the number of
patients with symptoms was initially higher in March 2020 (range:12-28) followed by a
decline from April 2020 to May 2020 (range:6-14). But It further increased during June 2020
to July 2020 (range: 3-37) (Figure-4)

The total daily patient visit showed a steady increase from April 2020 to 9th July 2020
(range:7-268) followed by a steady decline till the end of July 2020 (range: 57-161). On the
other hand, the weekly average daily sample testing increased significantly from June 2020
till mid of July 2020 (range:10.71-104.43) followed by a declining trend. Similarly, the
seven-days moving average for positive cases (range:0-11.43) increased after from July 2020
onwards (range:3.57-11.43). (Figure 5)
A total of 3652 samples were collected during the study period and a median of 10.00
(IQR=38.00) samples were being collected from CS-OPD every day. The overall testing rate
and positivity rate for CS-OPD during this period were found to be 34.02% and 7.94%
respectively. The patients from female paediatric population had the highest testing rate
(44.51%) as well as positivity rate (18.18%). The overall testing and positivity rate was
maximum for the paediatric age group. (Table-3)
The maximum proportion of samples were collected from Others category (29.71%)
followed by Symptomatic healthcare workers Category (20.21%). However, the positivity
rate was maximum in Symptomatic contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases (19.40%)
followed by asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of laboratory-confirmed case –
family members (18.82%). (Table-4)
Discussion:
The role of screening OPD for COVID -19 can be discussed from two perspectives, i.e.
maintaining hospital function through preventing nosocomial infection and providing
diagnostic services to suspected COVID-19 patients from the community in an accurate as
well as timely manner. The previous experience during H1N1 pandemic as well as present
experience with COVID-19 has reinforced the role of separate OPD under various names
like "fever clinic", "screening OPD", "screening clinic" etc. (10)(11)(12) Mahesh et al.
conducted a similar study in a tertiary care hospital of western India. They concluded that
early diagnosis, quick initiation of treatment, infection control measures, and reasonable care

at the hospital through flu OPD could effectively reduce morbidity and mortality during the
H1N1 pandemic. (13) Similarly, in a study conducted by Kwon et al., they found that
COVID-19 screening clinics were effective in maintaining the non-COVID-19 treatment
facilities by reducing the incidence of nosocomial infection in the hospital. The CS-OPD
might have played a crucial role in the prevention of possible nosocomial infection by early
diagnosis and segregation of COVID-19 positive patients as well as health care workers at
AIIMS Bhubaneswar. Although CS-OPD was planned and designed according to the
existing health facility infrastructure and local environment, some of the improvements
based on evidence from other studies can be incorporated in its functioning. Modifications
like a separate passage for patients-staffs-wastes and sample collection in a negative pressure
chamber can further strengthen the infection prevention and control measures. (10)(14)
As far as the CS-OPD patient profile is concerned, the maximum proportion of patient
belongs to the male gender and are from 15-60 years age group. This is in line with the study
done by Khan et al., and this may be due to lesser tendency among the female and elderly
population to seek proactive COVID-19 related care because of social as well as inadequate
health-seeking behaviour issues. (15)(11) Fever and cough were the two most common
presenting symptoms among patients visiting CS-OPD which is similar to the findings of
Mohan et al. in a study done among COVID-19 positive patients at a tertiary care institution
in North India. (16) Maximum proportion (79.23%) of patients visiting CS-OPD was without
any symptoms relevant to COVID-19. This asymptomatic population visiting CS-OPD was
mainly consisted of patients coming to the hospital for follow up visits, patient attendants,
healthcare workers and individual with travel history to hotspot areas at that point of time.
On further analysis of the profile of CS-OPD patients with respect to time, the number of
patients visiting CS-OPD with travel history and contact history increased from June 2020.
This may be due to the initiation of phased unlock after a nationwide lockdown from 25th
March 2020 to 31st May 2020. (17) However, it again showed a declining trend from midJuly 2020. This can be attributed to the closure of AIIMS Bhubaneswar main OPD from 10th

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.01.20224105; this version posted November 14, 2020. The copyright holder for this

July 2020 due to staff crunch associated with increased COVID-19 infection among health
care workers. (18) A similar type of trend was also observed with total samples collected as
with the closure of OPD, the number of patients coming to AIIMS Bhubaneswar decreased
suddenly leading to reduced screening and subsequent reduction in suspected cases. But the
number of positive cases detected remained on the higher side despite OPD closure, mostly
due to increasing case burden in the community.
In the case of testing indicators, the overall 7.94% positivity rate indicates that we may need
a more efficient implementation of relevant public health interventions to reach the WHO
devised epidemiological criteria for controlling the epidemic. (19) Higher positivity rate
among the paediatric population is in contrast to findings from ICMR COVID study group
where they reported a higher positivity rate among adult and elderly population. This may be
due to higher testing rate among them as compared to other age groups. (20)
Apart from this, the ongoing evolution of ICMR testing strategy has also an impact on
testing indicators as it has varied throughout the study period (Figure-3). In spite of this, if
we look into sampling categories, maximum samples have been contributed by the "others"
category (29.71%). This may be explained by the fact that, at AIIMS Bhubaneswar being a
tertiary care referral institution, patients with immunocompromised status like cancer (on
chemotherapy/radiotherapy) or chronic kidney diseases (on dialysis) or patients with preoperative conditions have been screened and tested extensively before admitting them to
non-COVID wards. We included these patients under the "others" category as they didn't fit
to any other ICMR testing category. Similarly, the higher testing percentage among
healthcare workers can be due to their increased susceptibility to infection, easy
approachability to COVID-19 testing services and regular contact tracing at the institutional
level.
On the other hand, maximum positivity among symptomatic contacts of laboratoryconfirmed cases (19.40%) is in agreement with the ICMR COVID study group findings

(10.6%). However, the second-highest positivity was detected in "Asymptomatic direct and
high-risk contacts of laboratory-confirmed case – family members" (18.82%) in contrast to
SARI patients (6.1%) in the ICMR COVID study group findings. This may be due to the fact
that most of the SARI cases coming to the hospital were being referred directly to the
emergency department for immediate care and proper evaluation. (20)
Strengths and limitations:
This is the one of the few studies from India which has been undertaken to understand the
patient profile and functioning of a COVID-19 screening OPD in a tertiary healthcare
setting. We have collected and analysed the data from all the patients who visited the
screening OPD during the study period. Our study has been able to demonstrate the variation
in patient profile associated with introduction of containment strategy to control COVID-19
pandemic. However, the periodic changes in testing strategy and categorisation of suspected
cases for sample collection by ICMR had influenced the testing and positivity rate in our
study.
Conclusion and Recommendations:
Our study gives an overview of the functioning of a COVID-19 screening OPD as a part of a
tertiary care institution. We have demonstrated how public health intervention like lockdown
and travel restrictions impacted the patient profile and brought a change in its due course of
the study period. Although the COVID-19 screening OPD has been effective in providing
screening and diagnostic services to patients, various best practices, and evolving strategies
based on evidence should be added to it continuously. Inclusion of point-of-care testing
services and broadening the ambit of suspected criteria at screening OPDs can help us to
detect more COVID-19 positive cases. Moreover, tertiary care institutions should also plan
permanent and separate infectious disease clinics like CS-OPDs and keep on upgrading them
to address evolving public health challenges like COVID-19.(21) As the pandemic
continues, it is evident that no single strategy is sufficiently effective. Therefore, the health
