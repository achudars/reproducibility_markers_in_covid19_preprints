Key Points
Question Any differences in the outcomes between hospitalized female and male
COVID-19 patients? If so, why?

Findings Female patients display better prognosis than male patients. Nonmenopausal women have shorter length of hospital stays, and AMH and E2 are
negatively correlated with COVID-19’s severity. There is a negative correlation
between E2 and the levels of IL6, IL8, IL2R and TNF-α, which are significantly
correlated with disease severity or composite endpoint.

Meaning Non-menopause and female sex hormones, especially E2 and AMH, are
potential protective factors for females COVID-19 patients. E2 supplements could be
potentially used for COVID-19 patients.

Abstract
Importance How to explain the better prognosis of female coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) patients than that of males?

Objective To determine the correlation between menstruation status/sex hormones
and prognosis of COVID-19, and to identify potential protective factors for female
patients.

Design, Setting, and Participants A cross-sectional study of COVID-19 patients
who were hospitalized at Tongji and Mobile Cabin Hospitals from Jan 28, 2020 to
March 8, 2020.

Exposures Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Main Outcomes and Measures Sex differences in severity and composite endpoints
(admission to intensive care unit (ICU), use of mechanical ventilation, or death) of
COVID-19 patients were compared. The correlation analysis and cox/logistic
regression modeling of menstruation status/sex hormones and prognosis were
conducted. Correlation between cytokines related to immunity and inflammation and
disease severity or estradiol (E2) was revealed.

Results Chi square test indicated significant differences in distribution of composite
endpoints (p<0.01) and disease severity (p=0.05) between male and female patients
(n=1902). 435 female COVID-19 patients with menstruation records were recruited.
By the end of Mar 8, 111 patients recovered and discharged (25.3%). Multivariate

Cox regression model adjusted for age and severity indicated that post-menopausal
patients show the greater risk of hospitalization time than non-menopausal patients
(relative hazard [RH], 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-3.46) Logistic
regression model showed that higher anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) as a control for
age increases the risk of severity of COVID-19 (HR=0.146,95%CI = (0.026-0.824)
p=0.029). E2 showed protective effect against disease severity (HR= 0.335, 95%CI =
(0.105-1.070), p= 0.046). In the Mann-Whitney U test, the higher levels of IL6 and
IL8 were found in severe group (p= 0.040, 0.033). The higher levels of IL2R, IL6,
IL8 and IL10 were also observed in patients with composite end points (p0.001,

0.001, 0.009, 0.040). E2 levels were negatively correlated with IL2R, IL6, IL8 and
TNFα in luteal phase (Pearson Correlation=-0.592, -0.558, -0.545, -0.623; p=0.033,
0.048, 0.054, 0.023) and with C3 in follicular phase (Pearson Correlation=-0.651;
p=0.030).

Conclusions and Relevance Menopause is an independent risk factor for COVID-19.
E2 and AMH are negatively correlated with COVID-19’s severity probably due to
their regulation of cytokines related to immunity and inflammation.

Introduction
Starting from December 2019, COVID-19 has rapidly spread across the world,
causing widespread concern. It’s worth noting that there was a definite sex difference
in the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. According to the recent data from the
Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the ratio of male infection
to female infection reached 2.7:1 1. Among 72314 patients in China, the morbidity
and case-fatality rates (CFR) (48.6% and 1.7%) of women were significantly lower
than

those

of

men

(51.4%,

2.8%).

More

deaths were

found

in males than females (63.8% over 36.2%) 2. The mortality rate of women aged 15-49,
under the average menopausal age 50, was even lower. These results indicate that
females are less susceptible than males, and have better outcomes.
SARS-COV and MERS, “sisters” of SAR-CoV-2, also showed sex preference in
their infection of humans with males experiencing higher CFR compared to females.
ACE2 has been shown to be the receptor of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, it is expressed more in male lungs than female lungs 3. Consistently, the
expression of ACE2 is downregulated by estrogen E2 4. This was confirmed in animal
experiments, showing that estrogen mitigates the susceptibility and the severity of
phenotype for SARS-CoV, while ovariectomy or intervention with estrogen receptor
inhibitors increased the mortality of female mice 5. An anti-virus drug study showed
that estrogen receptor inhibitors possess a great potency in antiviral activity screening
against MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and other RNA virus, and they also have an antiEbola virus effect in mice 6. These studies suggest that E2 might play a protective role
in SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infection with lower susceptibility, severity and better
outcomes of their corresponding diseases. However, the effect of sex hormones and

its related menstruation status on the progression and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2caused COVID-19 remains unknown.
In our attempt to address this question, we enrolled COVID-19 patients at Tongji
Hospital and Mobile Cabin Hospital. As described below, we found that there are the
sex differences in the severity and outcomes of this disease. Also, we showed there is
a good correlation between menstruation status/hormone levels and the severity or
outcomes of COVID-19. Finally, by examining the association between cytokines
related to immunity and inflammation and disease severity, clinical outcomes or E2,
we learned that E2 is inversely correlated with the levels of these cytokines. Our
results demonstrate that the better clinical outcomes of female COVID-19 patients are
well correlated with menstruation status and female hormone levels.

Methods
Study design and participants
This collaborative clinical study included patients from three branches of Tongji
Hospital (Sino-French New City Branch and Optical Valley Branch) and Mobile
Cabin Hospital between Jan 28 and March 8, 2020. Tongji Hospital was one of the
first batch of hospitals in Wuhan to receive severe and critically ill patients. The
Mobile Cabin Hospital was mainly used to treat mild/moderate patients. All COVID19 patients (n=1902) from the three branches were included to explore the sex
differences. 509 female patients (441 of Tongji Hospital and 68 of Cabin Hospital)
were inquired by telephone follow-up with menstrual status and gynecologic history,
435 patients were finally included. The correlation between menstruation status and
disease severity or outcomes were analyzed. We also tested serum cytokines related to

immunity and inflammation for 263 females and sex hormones levels for 78 female
patients except those who denied our request. The flowchart of the study is shown in
Figure 1.

Data Collection
COVID-19 was diagnosed based on the WHO interim guidance. A confirmed case of
COVID-19 was defined as a positive result on

real-time reverse-transcriptase–

polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of throat swab specimens7. Information
recorded included exposure history, clinical symptoms, comorbidities, laboratory
findings, chest computed tomographic (CT) scans and clinical outcome data. All
laboratory testing was performed according to the clinical care needs of the patient.
Laboratory tests included a complete blood count, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin,
erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ferritin, immunoproteins including immunoglobulin A
(IgA), immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), complement 3 (C3) and
C4, cytokines including IL-1β, IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-α. The clinical
outcomes (i.e., discharge, mortality, admission to ICU, mechanical ventilation, or
death) were monitored up to March 8, 2020.

Hormones Detection
Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2),
testosterone (T), prolactin (PRL), and progesterone (P) levels were measured using a
chemoluminescence-based immunometric assay on an UniCelDxI 800 immunoassay
system (Beckman Coulter, Inc, California, USA). Serum concentrations of AMH was

measured using the Elecsys AMH kit (Roche, Inc, Basel, Switzerl). All these samples
were measured in the same laboratory. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of
variation were all <15%. The lowest amount of AMH that could be detected with a
95% probability in a sample was 0.01 ng/mL.

Ethics and Trial Registration
This study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Tongji
Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (TJ-IRB20200214).
Oral informed consent was obtained from each enrolled patient. The trial has been
registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2000030015).

Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as the means and standard deviations or medians
and interquartile ranges (IQR) as appropriate. Categorical variables were summarized
as the counts and percentages in each category. Mann-Whitney U test were applied to
continuous variables, chi-square tests and Fisher’s exact tests were used for
categorical variables as appropriate. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models
were used to evaluate the independent effect of menstruation regularity on prolonging
hospitalization time, controlling age, severity and comorbidity. Multiple logistic
regression model was used to assess the independent adjusted relationship between
menstruation regularity and disease severity controlling age and E2 level. Pearson’s
correlation analysis was used to explore the relationship between E2 and cytokines
related to immunity and inflammation. All analyses were conducted with SPSS

Data were analyzed by statisticians.

Results
Sex Difference in Severity and Composite Endpoint of COVID-19 Patients
To explore the sex difference in severity and outcomes, a cohort of patients (n=1902)
infected with SARS-CoV-2 were recruited from the three branches of Tongji Hospital.
There were more female patients in mild group (male 412, 44.06%; female 444,
45.92%), approximately the same proportion of female and male patients in severe
group (male 486, 51.98%; female 503, 52.02%), and less female patients in critical
group (male 37, 3.96%; female 20, 2.07%, p= 0.05). By the end of Mar 8, more
female patients (97 ,10.03%) than male patients (85, 9.09%)) had been discharged,
and less female patients (16, 1.65%) than male patients (45, 4.81%) had died (p<
0.01). There was a significant difference between male and female patients in the
severity and clinical outcomes, while not in the age distribution (eTable 1, eFigure 1).
These results indicate that female patients are relatively milder and have better
outcomes, which are in accordance with recent published articles 1,2.

Characteristics of Female Patients Followed-up for Menstruation Status
The 509 patients from Tongji hospital and Mobile Cabin hospital were classified into
non-severe group (386, 75.8%) and severe group (123, 24.2%) according to the
American Thoracic Society guideline for community-acquired pneumonia

colleagues 9. The median age was 49 years (IQR, 38-56), female patients tended to be
younger in non-severe group (median age 47 years) than in severe group (median age
52 years) (p<0.001) and more were suffered in 41-55y group (p=0.022). 52 patients
had a body mass index more than 24, 138 patients stated their recent mental disorder,
and 443 of 509 lived in Wuhan, there was no significant difference in disease severity
or composite end point. At admission, most common symptoms were fever (393,
77.2%), cough (156, 30.6%) and dyspnea (54, 10.6%). 23.5% (119/506) patients had
one or more comorbidities, 24.4% (90/250) patients had one or more gynecological
diseases. 47.6% (206/433) patients received antiviral treatment, and 45.7% (198/433)
patients received antibiotic treatment. By the end of Mar 8, 111 patients had been
discharged, and 22 patients reached the composite endpoint (Table 1).

The Relationship between Menstruation Status and COVID-19’s Severity or
Outcomes
To determine the correlation between menstruation and disease progression, 435
patients who offered their complete menstruation history were included. In the last 612 months, 148 (34%) patients had regular menstrual cycle (21-35days), 36 (8.3%)
patients had irregular menstrual cycle (shorter than 21days or longer than 35 days),
and 251 (57.7%) patients had entered menopause (amenorrhea more than one year).
In non-severe group, patients with different menstruation status were 36.1%,
9.9% and 54.0% for regular, irregular and menopause, respectively. In the severe
group, while the proportion of regular and irregular decreased to 27% and 3%,
respectively, the proportion of menopause increased to 70% (p=0.008; eTable 2). But
if age was considered as an adjust variable, the significance was reduced (p= 0.533

for irregular group, p= 0.079 for menopause group; eTable 2), even when the regular
and irregular groups were merge into one non-menopause group (p=0.260; eTable 2).
However, when discharge was used as an endpoint and variables including
comorbidities, disease severity, age, and menstruation (non-menopause or menopause)
were brought into a multivariate Cox regression analysis, menstruation showed
definite protective effect. Patients with non-menopause tended to have lower
hospitalization proportion as time passing by and to be discharged earlier than
patients with menopause, control age and severity (relative hazard [RH]= 1.91; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 1.06 – 3.46); eTable 2, Figure 2).

The Relationship between Serum Hormone Levels and COVID-19’s Severity
The baseline clinical characteristics of 78 patients agreed to test the serum hormone
were shown in eTable 3. Age, phase of menstrual cycle, menstrual regularity in last 6
months and menstrual volumes in last 3 months were similar in terms of COVID-19’s
severity and composite end points. The correlation between sex hormones and disease
severity were shown in Table 2. E2, AMH, LH, T levels seemed to be most closely
related to disease severity. Composite endpoints were not discussed for this group,
since all patients were alive, not undergoing any of the composite endpoints at the end
of observation. Since age affects sex hormones levels strongly, it was used as an
adjust variable. In such, AMH still showed protective effect against disease severity
(AHR= 0.146, p= 0.029), while LH and T did not (AHR= 2.388, p=0.149; AHR=
0.556, p= 0.303). E2 got a critical p value (AHR= 0.335, p= 0.065). Considering
menstruation phase affected E2 levels greatly, it was used as another adjust variable
with age. E2 showed a clear protective effect against the disease (AHR= 0.3, p=

0.046; Table 2).

Correlation Analysis between Cytokines related to Immunity and Inflammation
and E2 or COVID-19’ Severity/Outcomes
The correlation between cytokines related to immunity and inflammation and disease
severity or composite end point were analyzed and shown in eTable 4. Higher levels
of IL6 and IL8 were found in the severe group than that in non-severe group (p=
0.040, 0.033; Figure 5, eTable 4). Higher levels of IL2R, IL6, IL8 and IL10 were also
observed in patients with composite end points than patients without composite end
points (p0.001, 0.001, 0.009, 0.040; eTable 5).
No significant correlation between the AMH level and these cytokines were
found in this study. The correlation between the E2 level (either in luteal or follicular
phase) and the level of these cytokines were shown in Figure 5 and Table S5. E2
levels were negatively correlated with that of IL2R, IL6, IL8 and TNFα in luteal
phase (Pearson Correlation= -0.592, -0.558, -0.545, -0.623; p= 0.033, 0.048, 0.054,
0.023) and with C3 in follicular phase (Pearson Correlation= -0.651; p= 0.030; Figure
5, eTable 5). Collectively, the levels of IL6 and IL8 were positively correlated with
COVID-19’s severity and composite endpoints. The E2 level was negatively
correlated to that of IL6, IL8, IL2R and TNFα in luteal phase, and C3 in follicular
phase.

It has remained incompletely understood if sex might significantly impact the

outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Here, our study indicated the proportion of severe
patients is less in females than that of males. Additionally, the clinical outcomes of
female patients were better than that of male patients, which is in accordance with
recent studies

1,2,9,10

. Apparently, sexual dimorphisms account for differences in

severity and outcomes of infectious diseases between females and males.
Previous study has indicated that menstruation status and hormonal fluctuation
may affect disease symptom severity11. Our study as presented here showed that
menstrual cycles and volumes are associated with the clinical severity and outcomes.
But if age was considered as an adjust variable, the significance was reduced, even
when the regular and irregular groups were merged into one non-menopause group.
Interestingly, postmenopausal patients have longer length of hospital stays than do
non-menopausal females, when considering age and severity. Accordingly,
psychiatric hospitalizations for women are significantly greater within 5 days of their
last menstrual period12. Normal menstruation regularity may be an important
protective factor for COVID-19 patients. However, menstruation is often affected by
many factors, such as medication, environment and anxiety, aside from the periodic
fluctuation of sex hormones.
Sex-specific disease outcomes following virus infections are attributed to sexdependent production of steroid hormones, different copy numbers of immune
response X-linked genes, and the presence of disease susceptibility genes in males
and females 13. Our data showed that E2 and AMH are positively correlated with the
disease severity. E2 is primarily produced in ovaries and considered as the most
prevalent and potent form of circulating estrogen. Estrogens are thought to protect
non-menopausal women from hepatitis C virus and other pathogens

ovariectomized and estrogen receptor antagonist treated female mice were more
susceptible to SARS-CoV, which may be due to the protective effects of estrogen
receptor signaling in SARS-CoV infection

. AMH changes slightly with menstrual

cycle and drugs and serves as the optimal marker for ovarian reserve and function.
AMH levels were positively associated with the number of oocytes retrieved, ovarian
response, E2 and testosterone 16. Logistics regression analyses showed that the levels
of E2 and AMH in non-severe group are higher than that of the severe group, which
may play vital roles in the progression of COVID-19. In this study, non-severe
females have higher levels of testosterone than do severe patients. Previous studies
have shown that testosterone has suppressive effects on immune system, such as on
cytokine production and lymphocyte proliferation 17. However, after adjusted by age,
the significance became unobvious. In the disease progression of COVID-19,
testosterone may work by suppressing immune storms. Our results also indicated that
E2 has a stronger protective effect against the potential negative effects from
testosterone.
Previous studies have suggested that high doses of E2 may inhibit the
production of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1β, TNF-α), whereas stimulation with
E2 at its physiological level enhances their production18,19. After viral infection,
proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines secreted by macrophages induced various
antiviral mechanisms. Several clinical studies reported that levels of proinflammatory
cytokines/chemokines, including IL-6, IL-8, IFN-γ, MCP-1, and IP-10, are highly
increased in patients with SARS, some of which were correlated with ARDS,
respiratory syncytial virus infections and human infection by avian influenza viruses
20,21

. In our study, the levels of IL6 and IL8 were negatively related to both disease

severity and composite end points, and IL2R and IL10 were related to composite end

points, consistent with a recent study 22.
E2 has also been shown to regulate host immune response

17,23-25

. Our results

indicated that E2 is negatively associated with C3 in follicular phase, and IL2R, IL6,
IL8 or TNFα in luteal phase. Cytokines and chemokines play vital roles in immunity
and immunopathology during virus infection. The effects of E2 on the immune
system are mainly due to its concentration, distribution, and different expression of
two main estrogen receptor-ERα and ERβ in various lymphoid cells. E2 was involved
in both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. E2 can also initiate the
differentiation from monocytes into inflammatory dendritic cells by regulating the
expression of cytokines and chemokines and promote greater internalization and
antigen presentation to naive T cells26. Thus, E2 may be a protective factor for female
COVID -19 patients by regulation of cytokines or immunoproteins such as IL2R, IL6,
IL8, TNFα and C3. Female symptoms severity and outcomes may change during
times of hormone fluctuation.

Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, correlation analysis showed that E2 is
negatively correlated with COVID-19’s severity, but the causal relationship between
them remains unclear. Second, the serum E2 level was just from once blood sample
regardless of phase of menstrual cycle, so that the results may not completely reflect
the average E2 level and its effects. In order to alleviate this error, we divided
menstrual cycle into follicular and luteal phase when analyzed with E2. Third, the
sample size of serum sex hormones, 78, might not be large enough. More samples are
needed to further determine the relationship of E2 level with the outcomes.

Conclusions
In summary, our data revealed that sex-bias does exist in COVID-19 patients, and
females are less severe and have better outcomes than do males, which is probably in
some extent due to the protective role of non-menopause and sex hormones,
especially E2, by regulation of cytokines related to immunity and inflammation. Our
study provides a new perspective to understand the susceptibility, progression and
prognosis of COVID-19’s sex difference. The levels of sex hormones and the status
of menstruation can serve as potential markers for the clinical prognosis and
outcomes of COVID-19. E2 supplement may have great potency in anti-virus
infection, which need to be further studied in animal experiments and clinical
researches.

Figure and figure Legends

Figure 1. Flow chart of patient recruitment procedure.
Patients (n=1902) from the three branches of Tongji Hospital were included to
explore the sex differences in COVID-19's prognosis. 509 female patients (441 of
Tongji Hospital and 68 of Cabin Hospital) were inquired by telephone follow-up with
menstrual status and gynecologic history. 435 patients with complete medical history
were finally included. Then, we tested serum cytokines related to immunity and
inflammation for 263 females and sex hormones levels for 78 female patients except
those who denied our request. Finally, we determined the correlation between
menstruation status/sex hormones and prognosis of COVID-19.

Figure2. Cox analysis of Age, Menstruation Status and Disease Severity with
Probability of Hospitalization.
A, Univariate cox regression of age with probability of hospitalization; B, Univariate
cox regression of menstruation status with probability of hospitalization, menstruation
status was divided into non-menopause (regular or irregular) and menopause. C,
Univariate cox regression of disease severity with probability of hospitalization. D,
Multivariate Cox analysis, the covariates age, menstruation and severity are
significant (p < 0.001, 0.033, 0.007). However, the covariate comorbidities fail to be
significant (p = 0.362, which is greater than 0.05). The hazard ratio for menstruation
is 1.91 indicating a strong relationship between non-menopauseand decreased risk of
days in hospital. The hazard ratio for age and severityis 0.26 and 0.41 respectively,
which indicate age and severity have a huge impact on risk of days in hospital.
