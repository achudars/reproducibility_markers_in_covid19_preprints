Abstract
The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020 and by
November 14, 2020 there were 53.3M confirmed cases and 1.3M reported deaths in the world. In the same
period, Ethiopia reported 102K cases and 1.5K deaths. Effective public health preparedness and response
to COVID-19 requires timely projections of the time and size of the peak of the outbreak. Currently, in the
absence of vaccine or effective treatment, the implementation of NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions),
like hand washing, wearing face coverings or social distancing, is recommended by WHO to bring the
pandemic under control. This study proposes a modified Susceptible Exposed Infected and Recovered
(SEIR) model to predict the number of COVID-19 cases at different stages of the disease under the
implementation of NPIs with different adherence levels in both urban and rural settings of Ethiopia. To
estimate the number of cases and their peak time, 30 different scenarios were simulated. The results
reveal that the peak time of the pandemic is different in urban and rural populations of Ethiopia. In the
urban population, under moderate implementation of three NPIs the pandemic will be expected to reach
its peak in December, 2020 with 147,972 cases, of which 18,100 are symptomatic and 957 will require
admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Among the implemented NPIs, increasing the coverage of
wearing masks by 10% could reduce the number of new cases on average by one-fifth in urban-populations.
Varying the coverage of wearing masks in rural populations minimally reduces the number of cases. In
conclusion, the projection result reveals that the projected number of hospital cases is higher than the
Ethiopian health system capacity during the peak time. To contain symptomatic and ICU cases within
health system capacity, the government should give attention to the strict implementation of the existing
NPIs or impose additional public health measures.

Introduction

The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first discovered in Wuhan, China
in December 2019 WHO (2020). The associated disease, COVID-19 was declared as a pandemic by the World Health
Organisation (WHO) on March 11, 2020. It has led to over 53.5 million confirmed cases and 1.3 million deaths
across the globe by November 14, 2020 WHO (2020). In Africa, the burden and impacts of the pandemic are less
compared with Europe and the USA. This may be attributed to late arrival of the pandemic, low seeding rate,
youthful demographics and possible prior immunity to coronavirus-like infections Njenga et al. (2020). Nevertheless,
the pandemic is accelerating in Africa and passed 2.0 million confirmed cases on November 13, 2020 according to
the Africa-CDC (2020) situation report. In Ethiopia, the first imported COVID-19 case, a Japanese person who
travelled from Burkina Faso, was detected and reported by the Ministry of Health on March 13, 2020, Institute
(2020). To control the spread of the disease, the Ethiopian government took immediate action, by closing schools,
banning sporting events and mass gatherings, three days later. It took 79 days to reach the first 1000 cases, but
10,000, 20,000, 40,000 and 80,000 cases were attained in shorter periods of 51, 16, 18 and 44 days, respectively.
This shows that the number of cases has been increasing over time, surpassing 100,000 by the mid of November,
2020. As the pandemic accelerates globally, many African countries, including Ethiopia, have been implementing
different non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to contain the spread of the disease. The WHO is leading a global
COVAX initiative for accelerated development of promising vaccine candidates that may be available in early 2021,
and experimental therapies are also undergoing clinical trials for safety before licensing. However, at this point in
time, the most effective means to control the spread of COVID-19 remains the implementation of different NPIs to
break chains of transmission Fong et al. (2020b); Ryu et al. (2020); Lai et al. (2020); Flaxman et al. (2020); Ferguson
et al. (2020). The transmission pathways of COVID-19 from person to person are: i) close contact through respiratory
droplet, ii) direct contact with infected persons, and iii) contact with contaminated formites (objects and surfaces)
Kassa et al. (2020). Public health measures are intended to diminish these transmission mechanisms.
Mathematical models have been previously used with success in understanding the transmission dynamics and
control mechanisms of infectious diseases (Anderson and May (1979)). To understand the early transmission dynamics
of COVID-19 under different scenarios, a number of mathematical models have been proposed in the literature, Prem
et al. (2020); Li et al. (2020); Walker et al. (2020); Ivorra et al. (2020); Ngonghala et al. (2020); Nicholas et al.
(2020). Those epidemiological and mathematical models contributed important insight for public health decisionmakers to enforce different mitigation strategies in different countries. As COVID-19 has spread worldwide, most
countries are utilising mathematical models to inform on public health measures. Many countries (for example the
UK, China, Germany, USA, Morocco) revised their public health measures based on COVID-19 modelling results. We
believe that, due to the difference in the age-structure of the population, social interaction and life style in Ethiopia,
mathematical models developed in other countries may not work to study the dynamics of disease in lower income
settings. This study employs the use of mathematical models to simulate the spread and interruption of transmission
of the disease in Ethiopia.
Assessment of implemented and proposed intervention strategies for combating COVID-19, and predicting the
number of new cases and deaths is a major challenge to both the public and scientific community. Banholzer et al.

(2020) and Flaxman et al. (2020) estimated the impact of NPIs based on confirmed cases of COVID-19 in several
countries. Similarly, Ferguson et al. (2020) studied the impact of NPIs to reduce COVID-19 mortality and healthcare
demand. To our knowledge, there has been very limited study of the impact of NPIs on the disease dynamics in
the local context of Ethiopia. The only published study, done by Siraj et al. (2020), focused on small, medium and
large clusters of the population with social distancing face masking and contact tracing implementation at different
proportion. This study did not quantify the impact of hand washing measures on transmission dynamics. Further,
their study did not provide the estimated number of cases under different stages of the disease. Takele (2020)
implements the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modeling to project COVID-19 prevalence
patterns in East Africa Countries, mainly Ethiopia, Djibouti, Sudan and Somalia. While, her projection model did
not take into account the impact of NPIs with different adherence level on the predicted number of cases.
Our study proposes a modified mathematical model of the classic SEIR model (Anderson and May (1979)) and
this modified model is used to compare the effect of different NPIs individually and in combination. The proposed
model classifies the human population into eight non-overlapping stages of infection: Susceptible (S), Exposed (E),
Asymptomatic infectious (Ia ), Symptomatic infectious (Is ), Isolation of cases with mild/moderate health condition
(at home or hospital) (HIm ), Hospitalized with critical health condition (Hc ), Recovered from the disease (R), and
Death due to COVID-19 (D).
Our proposed model (1) has a number of advantages: i) provide estimated time and size of the peak under the
implementation of NPIs with different adherence level in urban and rural population settings, ii) proposed model
differentiates asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious which influences the number of ICU cases and death due
to the disease, iii) the effect of indirect transmission of the disease through contaminated environment is taken into
account, and iv) provide the estimated impact of individual and synergy public health measures on the dynamics of
the disease. The projected number of people in each stage of the disease at the peak period and the time of the peak
in urban and rural areas of Ethiopia helps the government to choose and enforce better intervention mechanisms.

Representation of Proposed Mathematical Model

In our modeling framework, the population is divided into different compartments according to the infection status
of individuals: susceptible (S), exposed (E), asymptomatic infected (Ia ), symptomatic infected (Is ), isolated at home
or hospital with moderate health condition (IHm ), hospitalized with severe health condition (Hc ), recovered from
the disease (R), and death (D) due to the disease. Contaminated environment is also a means of transmission for
COVID-19 as the virus can stay up to several days on different surfaces van Doremalen et al. (2020). To account for
the impact of contaminated objects in the transmission, an additional compartment for contaminated environment
is included. Paramter description with these assumed initial values are presented in Table 1. Those values were
extracted from a number of key papers and reports of the situation in Ethiopia (Institute (2020); Goshu et al. (2020);
Baye (2020); Kebede et al. (2020); Siraj et al. (2020)) and epidemiological scientific facts of COVID-19.
By assuming that the total population is N = S + E + Ia + Is + IHm + HC + R + D, the corresponding system

from that source, Kassa et al. (2020). The model accounts for a distinction between non-diagnosed individuals Ia
and Is , who can readily spread the infection because they are not in isolation, and hospitalized individuals HIm and
Hc , who transmit the disease less thanks to isolation and complying with strict rules, either in hospital or at home.

2.2

Well-posedness of the System and sensitivity analysis

To check the mathematical and biological meaningfulness of the model, both positivity and boundedness properties
of the proposed model are assessed as follows. Let the domain space be defined by

Ω = (S, E, Is , Ia , Hc , IHm , R, D, Env ) ∈ R9+
Theorem 2.1. int(Ω) = {(S, E, Is , Ia , Hc , IHm , R, D, Env )|S > 0, E ≥ 0, Is ≥ 0, Ia ≥ 0,
Hc ≥ 0, IHm ≥ 0, R ≥ 0, D ≥ 0, Env ≥ 0)} is the positive invariant set of the system (2).
The proof of theorem 2.1 is presented in the Appendix and the theorem implies well-posedness of the system.

Sensitivity analysis of model parameters
In order to identify parameters which significantly influence the model system, sensitivity analysis was performed.
The uncertainty and sensitivity analysis is done by using Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) analysis with
N=10,000 samples for various input parameters Wu et al. (2013); Marino et al. (2008). The partial derivative of the
threshold value Ro with respect to the input parameters were computed by varying the parameters around normal
values.

System Equilibria and Stability of the System
Disease Free Equilibrium

Equilibrium points are those points where each equation in the system in Equation (1) is equal to zero. Equating the
right hand side of each equation in Equation (1) to zero will provide disease-free and endemic equilibrium points. In
this subsection, the disease-free equilibrium point is described as follows.
When there is no COVID-19 in the population, the disease-free equilibrium point is given by
π
E0 = (S, E, Ia , Is , IHm , Hc , R, D, Env ) = ( , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
µ

(4)

In this study, to compute the basic reproduction number, Diekmann et al. (1990), next-generation method for the
disease-free equilibrium is employed. The basic reproduction number is the average number of secondary infection
cases produced in a completely susceptible population by a typical infectious individual. According to the definitions
stated in Diekmann et al. (1990) and van den Driessche and Watmough (2002a), in the next-generation method, R0
is the spectral radius of the next-generation matrix which is given by
R0 = ρ(F V −1 )

which can be expressed as A = R0 = R0a + R0s + R0Env and the quantity R0 is the basic reproduction number
of the Model (2). The quantity R0 is the sum of the constituent reproduction numbers associated with the number
of new COVID-19 cases generated by symptomatically infectious humans (R0s ), asymptomatically infectious humans
(R0a ) and contaminated environment (R0Env ).
Theorem 2.2. The disease-free equilibrium (DFE) of model 2 is locally asymptotically stable if R0 < 1, and unstable
if R0 > 1.
Proof. It follows from Theorem 2 of van den Driessche and Watmough (2002b)
The implication of Theorem 2.2 is that a small introduction of COVID-19 cases will not generate a COVID-19
outbreak if the basic reproduction number (R0 ) is less than unity.
Theorem 2.3. The disease-free equilibrium of model 2 is globally asymptotically stable if R0 ≤ 1.

Projection of Cases using Proposed Model

The proposed modified SEIR model described in section 2.1 is used to project the number of COVID-19 related
cases in Ethiopia. Projecting the number of active COVID-19 cases under the implementation of different NPIs with
different adherence level is important for policy makers to be able to mitigate against the disease. Projecting the
number of asymptomatic and symptomatic people is important, as these two numbers have huge roles in the spread of

the disease. Further, knowing the expected number of people who may require treatment under intensive care (ICU
cases) will greatly help to guide policy makers in preparation of manpower and medical facilities such as ventilators.
Due to the very limited number of available ventilators in Ethiopia (below 1000 ventilators in total), knowing the
projected number of individuals who need ICU under the implementation of different NPIs with varying adherence
level of hygiene, physical distancing and mask wearing are important to save lives. Many studies showed that most
of the critically ill patients with COVID-19 are of older age and have more co-morbidities than the non-critically ill
patients. Hence, projection is done for all active case, symptomatic cases, asymptomatic cases, ICU cases, and death
due to the disease using the proposed model.
In our model, common COVID-19 related parameters were obtained from previous studies (Table 1).

2

Further, based on the 2016 Ethiopian demographic and health survey, 27.4% and 7.8% of the urban and rural
population wash hands by soap, respectively. Thus, in the simulation, we assumed improved percentages of hygiene
due to the awareness created by COVID-19 in both population settings. Due to differences in access to sanitation
materials, lifestyle, cultural norms and other factors, adherence levels to the recommended NPIs are also different in
the urban and rural populations. As a result, projection on the number of COVID-19 related cases is done separately
for urban and rural populations of Ethiopia.

Data

In this study, data on daily number of COVID-19 cases, cumulative number of deaths, and number of critical patients
was extracted from Ethiopian Public Health Institute website (www.ephi.gov.et/) and Ministry of Health official
Twitter page(https://twitter.com/FMoHealth/) on daily basis. We used initial parameter (1)values describing the
natural and clinical course of infection from published sources WHO (2020); Ngonghala et al. (2020); Ferguson et al.
(2020); Kassa et al. (2020). The projection model considers daily number of cases in Ethiopia up to 210 days (October
08, 2020) since the first case of the disease was recorded.

2.6

Considered Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs)

Based on the current evidence about COVID-19, implementing different NPIs are essential requirements for limiting
the spread of the disease. The main objective of NPIs is to reduce the rate of transmission, thereby minimizing the
size of the epidemic peak and delaying peak time, buying time for preparations in the healthcare system, and enabling
the potential for vaccines and drugs to be developed, approved and used, Fong et al. (2020a); Ryu et al. (2020); Xiao
et al. (2020); Flaxman et al. (2020); Lai et al. (2020). The NPIs considered in this study are physical-distancing,
wearing face-masks and hygiene measures (hand washing)(see Table 2). We assume that implementing NPIs alone
or in combination affects the rate of contact between uninfected people and infected people or objects. As a result,
transmission probability of the virus from infected individuals or objects to the susceptible population is reduced.
We evaluated the impact of the three NPIs, alone or in combination, on the time and size of the peak by varying
the adherence level to each of them.

Results: Projection of number of COVID-19 Cases in Ethiopia

3.1

Projection of All Active Cases

By fixing the adherence levels to hygiene to 30% and 40% of the urban population based on the aforementioned
reasons, the projected number of active COVID-19 cases was obtained by varying the percentages of social distancing
and face mask coverage. Figure 2 presents the projected number of active COVID-19 cases with varying adherence
levels of NPIs.
At 15% face mask coverage and with 10% of the population implementing social distancing measures, a 10%
increase in hygiene will decrease the number of cases by 200,000 and delay the peak time. For a given implementation
of wearing a face mask and hygiene, improving the percentage of social distancing by 10% will reduce the number

of new COVID-19 cases by one-fifth. Increasing the number of people who wear face mask a by 10% will save on
average 25,000 people from being infected by the disease (Figure 2).
In the rural parts of Ethiopia, physical distancing is a custom and part of the life style. This custom greatly
minimizes the spread of the disease that is caused by contact and contaminated environment. Furthermore, due to
low coverage of road accessibility (accessibility index=22%), in our simulation we assumed 20% of the population are
protected until the end of the pandemic World-Bank (2016). Further, based on 2016 EDHS, 7.8% of the rural population wash their hands using soap. Figure 3 depicts the projected number of active cases under the implementations
of varying physical distancing measures and wearing of face masks. In rural settings, people use home-made masks,
and we assumed the efficacy of the masks is 0.2.

3b) 2% (Figure 3c,Figure 3d) 5% (Figure 3e,Figure 3f) wear face masks with 20% efficiency.
Keeping adherence to face mask wearing and physical distancing constant, a 5% increase in hygiene will decrease
the number of cases by 200, 000 and shift the peak time to the future nearly by one month (Figure 3). For a given
implementation of face mask wearing and hygiene, improving the percentage of physical distancing by 10% will reduce
the number of new COVID-19 cases by one-fourth.

Projection of Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Cases

The following projected number of symptomatic (broken line) and asymptomatic (solid line) cases were simulated by
assuming 30% and 40% of the urban population wash hands with soap, with different face mask coverage (5%, 15%and
25%) with 35% mask efficacy.

when 5% (4a 4b) 15% (4c 4d) and 25% (4e,4f) of them wear face masks with 35% efficacy.
When 40% of the urban population wash hands with soap or keep hands clean using sanitizers, 25% wear face
masks, improving the implementation of physical distancing greatly reduces both symptomatic and asymptomatic
infections. By increasing the percentage of physical distancing in the population from 10% to 20%, the peak size will
decrease by half for both infection compartments (Figure 4).
For a given coverage of face mask wearing and implementing physical distancing, improving hygiene by 10%,
highly reduces the number of active cases and delays the peak time of the pandemic. For both hygiene scenarios,
for a given level of face mask wearing, increasing adherence to physical distancing profoundly reduces the number
of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. A maximum number of asymptomatic infections will be observed if there

is poor implementation of physical distancing and face mask wearing. Regardless of other NPIs, COVID-19 will be
suppressed if 40% of the population implements physical distancing properly.
Figure 5 presents the projected number of symptomatic (broken line) and asymptomatic (solid line) cases in
rural Ethiopia by varying the level of face mask wearing and physical distancing while fixing hygiene practice in the
community at 15% and 20%. Increasing proper hand washing behaviour from 15% to 20% could shift the peak by
around 2 months. Implementing physical distancing, hygiene, and face mask wearing at 40%, 20% and 5% levels,
respectively, helps to control the pandemic under the Ethiopian health system capacity and shifts the peak forward
to 2021. At a given level of implementation of hand washing and wearing of face masks, increasing the physical
distancing by 10% could shift the peak time by around 40 days (Figure 5).

Projection of Critical Cases

Figure 6 presents the projected number of ICU cases by keeping the hygiene coverage constant (at 30%and 40%)
and varying adherence to physical distancing and wearing of face masks at different levels in urban population of
Ethiopia.

6b) 15% (Figure 6c,Figure 6d) and 25% (Figure 6e, Figure 6f) of them wear face mask
If 15% of the population wears masks and 30% implement physical distancing, improving hygiene by 10% could
reduce the number of ICU cases from 463 to 280 (Figure 6). Proper implementation of wearing face masks and hand
washing could flatten the curve. However, to bring critical cases under the Ethiopian health care capacity, people
should also practice social distancing.
It is not too late to suppress the disease if strict implementation of NPIs is practiced (40% hand wash, 40%
physical distancing and 25% wearing masks) in all urban populations of Ethiopia.

In the rural population the projected number of critical cases could exceed the available number of ventilators
in our health system (Figure 7). To contain critical cases, people should strictly implement the three NPIs or the
government should enforce additional public health measures. Since the time of the peak in rural populations is
different from that of urban populations, the health system can make preparations for the transport system to bring
these critical cases to heath facilities in urban centers. The two extreme scenarios show that improving hygiene by
5% and physical distancing by 40% could reduce the total?at peak time? number of critical cases from 2,361 to 1,569
(assuming 5% wear masks). Strict implementation of the three NPIs will shift the peak time forward by three months
(Figure 7).

of Ethiopia.

The number of deaths due to COVID-19 could be reduced if more than 40% of the populations practice physical
distancing. The projected number of cumulative deaths under the implementation of different adherence levels of
physical distancing and face mask wearing at fixed (15% and 20%) levels of hygiene are presented in Figure 9.
Practicing recommended NPIs properly (40% physical distancing 5% face mask and 20% proper hand washing)
could greatly reduce the number of death due to COVID-19. Table 3 and Table 4 presents summary of the projected
number of active COVID-19 and ICU cases under different adherence levels of hygiene, wearing-masks and physicaldistancing in the urban and rural population of Ethiopia, respectively.

The Basic Reproductive Number

The basic reproductive number (Ro ) measures the degree of spread of SARS-CoV-2. If this number is greater than
one, the disease will spread out if additional public health measures are not taken.
Table 5 and 6 presents estimated Ro at different time points by taking into account enforced NPIs since the onset
of the disease in urban and rural Ethiopia, respectively. This number was higher in the first and 10th week of the
pandemic in urban Ethiopia. Further, compared with the rural population, at the beginning of the pandemic Ro was
higher in the urban areas of Ethiopia.

Sensitivity Analysis

Figure 10 shows that the model is particularly sensitive to physical distancing (SD), hand wash (HW) and direct
human to human disease transmission rate (β1 ). Hand wash and physical distancing were inversely proportional to
Ro , while β1 has directly proportional to Ro . Parameters with relatively large PRCC values (> 0.5 or < −0.5) as

Figure 10: Sensitivity of parameters with respect to Ro
well as corresponding small p values (< 0.05) are considered as the most important parameters. Parameters whose
PRCC value are close to +1 or −1 most strongly influence the model. A negative sign for PRCC indicates inverse
relationship of the parameter with Ro .
To see whether one parameter depends on another, pairwise comparisons were carried out. The processes underlying the parameters physical distancing, hand washing and the proportion of the population who become symptomatic
infectious, θ, have the greatest potential of containing the epidemic if increased, whereas processes described by β1
and  and ηa have the greatest potential of making the epidemic worse when increased (Figure 10).
In this respect, increasing physical distancing directly reduces β1 as this lowers the likelihood of a susceptible
individual getting in contact with a potentially infected individual. In addition, practicing good hygiene (such as
regularly washing hands, using sanitizers to disinfect the infected environment, ventilation of rooms and avoiding
touching the T-zones of the face) is associated with lowering the chance of contracting the virus from infected surfaces.
Anything contrary to the above increases the likelihood of getting the infection through the two aforementioned routes.
Moreover, improving hand wash practices will reduce viral contamination of the environment by infected individuals.
On the other hand, the processes underlying the parameters with negative PRCC have a potential to contain the
number of cases when enhanced.
To ascertain whether the process described by those parameters are different or not, a pairwise comparison to

significant parameters was undertaken. Table 8 presents the computed p-values for different pairs of significant
parameters by accounting for the false discovery rate (FDR). The major question posed at this point is: Are the
different pairs of significant parameters different after FDR adjustment? Based on the FDR adjusted p-values in
Table 8, the compared pairs of parameters are rendered to be different if their p-value is less than 0.05 and not
different otherwise.

Table 8 presents a summary of compared parameters, where ”TRUE” indicates compared parameters are significantly different, and ”FALSE” otherwise. The results show that more sensitive parameters are also significantly
different (see Table 8) except for the pair rate of recovery of asymptomatic infectious individuals-appropriate use
of face masking y − F M , recovery rate of symptomatic infectious individual-rate of going to isolation w − e, social
distancing and hand washing SD − HW , respectively which may not necessarily be correlated.

Discussion and Conclusion

In this study, a modified SEIR model was developed to project the number of COVID-19 cases with different stage
of the disease under the implementation of wearing face masks, hand washing and physical distancing with varying
adherence levels in both urban and rural populations of Ethiopia. Unlike other mathematical modeling studies done in
the context of Ethiopia Siraj et al. (2020); Alemneh and Telahun (2020); Takele (2020), this study provides projected
number of all active cases, symptomatic and asymptomatic cases and ICU cases at the peak time of the pandemic.
The projected number of people in each stage of the disease at the peak period and the time of the peak in urban
and rural areas of Ethiopia helps the government to choose and enforce better intervention mechanisms.
Our projection shows that, in line with Howarda et al. (2020); Worby and H-H. (2020) improving the percentage

of the population who wear face masks by 10% will protect around 100,000 more people from being infected by
COVID-19 in the urban population. Regardless of face mask coverage and hygiene, the peak time of COVID-19 could
be shifted to the future by two months if 40% of the population implements social distancing properly. Similar to our
finding, the study by Siraj et al. (2020) demonstrated practicing physical distancing and wearing face masks delays
the peak time of the pandemic.
In the rural population setting, implementing hygiene measures, physical distancing, and wearing face masks at
20%, 40%, and 5%, respectively, could shift the peak time into to 2021. The projected number of active cases during
the peak time could reach around 360,000 if 5%, 40%, and 20% of the population wear masks, keep physical distancing
and hand wash with soap, respectively. As social distancing is already a custom due to the life style in the rural
population of Ethiopia, improving hygiene by 20% could help to decrease the number of cases by 2-3 fold.
In the urban population setting, if 20% of the population implements physical distancing and 30% adopt hygiene
measures, and 25% wear face masks the peak time of the pandemic will happen on December, 2020 with 119,000
estimated cases (Table 3). During the peak time of the pandemic, except for some scenarios (30% physical distancing
and above ≥ 15% face mask coverage), the projected number of ICU case are above the capacity of the Ethiopian
health system, which needs the government attention (Table 3).
COVID-19 is a deadly virus for which vaccination or effective medical treatment is not yet available. Hence
the government should focus on prevention of infection using NPI mechanisms. Low socioeconomic status and
behavioral attitudes lead to closer interactions in congested households, hampering the successful implementation of
social distancing measures. Lack or improper use of masks and use of low quality masks may exacerbate the spread of
infection. It is therefore imperative that the prudent use of NPIs is implemented in Ethiopia to contain the pandemic.
NPIs used in combination are able to decrease cases and fatalities due to Covid-19. Separate implementation of each
of the NPIs shortens the peak time of the pandemic and the number of new cases will increase by two-fold. We
considered the place of residence being urban and rural as a factor since adherence to the recommended NPIs and
the life style and living conditions, varies greatly in urban and rural society of Ethiopia.
Similar to the urban population projection, projection of cases in the rural setting was done by modifying the
model parameters in the context of rural population practices. Table 4 presented summary of projected active
COVID-19 cases and ICU cases in rural population of Ethiopia under 30 scenarios. The results shows that, at the
peak of the pandemic, the number of projected cases in rural population will be higher than the urban population.

Conclusion
The first COVID-19 case was detected on March 13, 2020 and since then the government of Ethiopia has applied
different mitigation strategies. But the virus continues to spread. Since community transmission of the virus is
established, temporally relaxing any of the three non-pharmaceutical interventions could cause a rebound of the
number of new cases, potentially leading to a collapse of the health care system. Our findings confirm, in the context
of Ethiopia, that suppression of COVID-19 could be achieved by the combined implementation of three public health
measures: wearing of face masks, social distancing and hand hygiene.The most effective public health measures are

found to be face mask wearing in urban population and social distancing in rural populations. To mitigate COVID-19,
in the urban population of Ethiopia, strict implementation of all three NPIs are required. In addition to announcing
public health measures, the government should work on proper enforcement of NPIs, and the public should properly
practice public health measures for their own safety and well-being. Based on the projected results under different
conditions, concerned stakeholders could recommend achievable NPIs for their implementation to policy makers.

Limitation
Studies on COVID-19 showed the distribution of cases strongly depend on age. The resources available could not get
data on the number of cases by age group from concerned organizations in order to get age-structured predictions
and to assess the impact of school closure on the pandemic. Further, the projection to the rural population setting
is less reliable as the analysis has been constrained by different factors (i.e. exact number of incidences were not
known, adherence to the implemented NPIs greatly vary across different regions of the country, estimated number of
protected individuals assumed 20%,and others). Further, the study did not account for under reporting of COVID-19
cases.

Theorem 2.1
Proof. Positivity of Ω
To show Ω positive, first we show S of the model is positive for all t ≥ 0. To prove by contradiction: suppose,
S(t) = 0, S 0 (t) < 0, E ≥ 0, Is ≥ 0, Ia ≥ 0, Hc ≥ 0, IHm ≥ 0, R ≥ 0, D ≥ 0, Env ≥ 0t > 0. Then, using the first
equation of system (1) we have,
dS
(t) = π > 0
dt
which contradicts S 0 (t) < 0. Thus, S(t) remains positive for t ≥ 0. For the rest of population variables we can show
positivity using Gronwall’s inequality as follows.
