Abstract
Background: Correctional institutions nationwide are seeking to mitigate Covid-19-related risks.
Objective: To quantify changes to California’s prison population since the pandemic began and
identify risk factors for Covid-19 infection.
Design: We described residents’ demographic characteristics, health status, Covid-19 risk
scores, room occupancy, and labor participation. We used Cox proportional hazard models to
estimate the association between rates of Covid-19 infection and room occupancy and out-ofroom labor, respectively.
Setting: California state prisons (March 1-October 10, 2020).
Participants: Residents of California state prisons.
Measurements: Changes in the incarcerated population’s size, composition, housing, and
activities. For the risk factor analysis, the exposure variables were room type (cells vs
dormitories) and labor participation (any room occupant participating in the prior 2 weeks) and
the outcome variable was incident Covid-19 case rates.
Results: The incarcerated population decreased 19.1% (119,401 to 96,623) during the study
period. On October 10, 2020, 11.5% of residents were aged ≥60, 18.3% had high Covid-19 risk
scores, 31.0% participated in out-of-room labor, and 14.8% lived in rooms with ≥10 occupants.
Nearly 40% of residents with high Covid-19 risk scores lived in dormitories. In 9 prisons with
major outbreaks (6,928 rooms; 21,750 residents), dormitory residents had higher infection rates
than cell residents (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 2.51 95%CI, 2.25-2.80) and residents of rooms
with labor participation had higher rates than residents of other rooms (AHR, 1.56; 95%CI, 1.391.74).
Limitations: Inability to measure density of residents’ living conditions or contact networks
among residents and staff.

Conclusion: Despite reductions in room occupancy and mixing, California prisons still house
many medically vulnerable residents in risky settings. Reducing risks further requires a
combination of strategies, including rehousing, decarceration, and vaccination.

Introduction
Over 380,000 incarcerated people in the United States were diagnosed with severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 through February 2021, and approximately 2,300 died
(1). Prisons are vulnerable to rapid viral spread, given their population density and the
infeasibility of standard distancing measures (2-8). Covid-19-related health outcomes appear
worse among incarcerated people than in the general population (3,9,10).
Correctional systems face difficult trade-offs in their attempts to control Covid-19
transmission. Early releases reduce crowding but may cause public unrest (11). Curtailing inprison activities (e.g., work or group therapy) limits mixing but is disruptive and may have
adverse health effects (12-13). The federal government has issued guidance (14-15) on
measures to reduce Covid-19 transmission in correctional settings, but the recommendations
lack specificity and evidence of efficacy. The evidence base in this area remains extremely
limited.
The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) manages the
country’s second largest prison system, with 35 institutions that housed ~120,000 residents in
early 2020. CDCR has undertaken multiple interventions to prevent and contain Covid-19
outbreaks. This study describes how CDCR’s incarcerated population has changed during the
pandemic, focusing on room occupancy and participation in out-of-room activities. For prisons
that have experienced outbreaks, we estimate the extent to which those two factors are
associated with Covid-19 infection rates.

CDCR provided data on all incarcerated people aged ≥18 years residing in its prisons
during the period March 1 through October 10, 2020. The data were provided at the person-daylevel, which allowed daily tracking of changes in any time-varying information until residents’
release or death.
The data included variables indicating residents’ demographic (sex, age, and race or
ethnicity) and health characteristics; location; participation in prison labor, education, and other
activities; and Covid-19 testing history. The data contained each resident’s security level (1
[lowest] to 4 [highest]) which determines housing locations and eligibility for work and other
activities (16). Locational information specified the room in which each resident spent the night.
Rooms were defined as discrete spaces, at least partially enclosed by solid walls, and were
classified as cells or dormitories of varying sizes.
The health information included indicators for diagnosed medical conditions and Covid19 risk score. This score, developed by CDCR, is an integer-based estimate of each resident’s
probability of severe health outcomes following Covid-19 infection. Scores correspond to the
presence of demographic and clinical characteristics identified in the literature as risk factors for
severe Covid-19-related illness, and CDCR considers scores ≥3 to indicate high-risk (Table S1).
Testing information included dates and results. CDCR has been testing residents using
real-time PCR and antigen tests since April 2020. Testing expanded during the study period,
eventually employing both reactive mass testing and periodic surveillance testing. Prisons
experiencing large outbreaks tested residents at particularly high rates (Figure S1). By Fall
2020, all prisons were testing 5-25% of residents every two weeks.
We created variables to describe risk factors for Covid-19 exposure and transmission,
based on residents’ housing situation and their participation in out-of-room activities. With
respect to housing, we calculated the daily number of residents housed in each room (square
footage of rooms was unavailable). This count variable had a bimodal distribution, with many
residents living alone or with one other resident, or in substantially larger rooms (≥10 residents),

and relatively few in between. For some analyses we dichotomized this variable, distinguishing
residents in “cells” (1-2 occupants) and “dormitories” (≥3 occupants); this aligned with CDCR’s
conception of the major division in room sizes.
With respect to activities, the resident-day-level data included information on residents’
out-of-room participation in labor (e.g., janitorial), education (e.g., high school classes), and
other activities (e.g., religious services) (17-18). From April 2020, educational activities were
confined to residents’ rooms. Consequently, we focused on labor and other out-of-room noneducational activities excluding recreation and meals which were not comprehensively tracked.
We specified variables indicating whether each resident participated in each activity type and
variables indicating whether each resident or a roommate did so in the previous two weeks.
Finally, we classified prisons into 5 categories based on the predominant resident
security levels, housing configurations, and CDCR advice: reception centers, medical prisons,
low security and general population prisons, high security prisons, and mixed security and
medium security prisons (details provided in Table S2).

Analysis
We calculated changes over the study period in the size and composition of the
incarcerated population, in housing, and in participation in out-of-room activities (samples for
each analysis shown in Figure S2).
We used person-level survival analysis to estimate the association between room
occupancy and labor activities, respectively, and rates of Covid-19 infection. We focused on
sustained within-prison transmission, therefore limiting the analysis to prisons with outbreaks
involving substantial resident-to-resident spread. We defined prisons with outbreaks as those
having ≥50 cumulative cases during the study period and ≥10 incident cases detected on at
least one day in that period. We defined an outbreak’s start date as 14 days prior to the first day
with ≥10 incident cases.

We specified several additional prison-level and resident-level eligibility criteria for the
survival analysis (Figure S3). Briefly, to allow ≥90 days follow-up, we excluded prisons (n=7)
with outbreaks that began after July 12, 2020; to minimize confounding, we excluded one prison
with testing rates that differed substantially between cells and dormitories (Figure S4); and we
excluded prisons (n=3) whose outbreaks were seeded by mass introduction of cases (e.g., San
Quentin), because their epidemic growth may have been atypical. Within eligible prisons, we
included residents present on the day the outbreak began who were tested for Covid-19 at least
once during the 90-day period.
The observation period for eligible residents’ observation ran from the start of their
prison’s outbreak until the sample collection date of their first positive test or their last negative
test. Release or transfer to another prison were also censoring events.
We fit a multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression model to estimate the
associations of interest. The outcome variable indicated the sample collection date for the first
positive Covid-19 test result among residents who had a positive test. The main exposure
variables were room occupancy at the outbreak start and room-level labor participation during
the 14-day period prior to the outbreak start. We also included prison fixed effects. We
assessed the appropriateness of the proportional hazards assumption by inspecting plots of
Schoenfeld residuals.
We conducted sensitivity analyses. Because there may be systematic differences in how
residents with higher Covid-19 risk scores or higher security levels mix with other residents, we
added baseline values of these covariates. We varied the required follow-up period for prison
inclusion. We allowed the observation period for residents who did not test positive, exit the
prison, or die to extend to the end of the study period, regardless of their last negative test date.
We estimated the model clustering standard errors at the room and prison levels.

Results
From March 1 to October 10, 2020, the resident population of California prisons
decreased from 119,401 to 96,623 (Figure 1), a reduction of 19.1% that reversed prior trends
(19). High security prisons (7.0%) and medical prisons (14.4%) had the smallest relative
reductions.
On October 10, 2020, 96.7% of residents were male and 11.5% were aged 60 years or
older (Table 1). Nearly three-quarters were Hispanic (44.5%) or non-Hispanic Black (29.5%).
Forty percent had at least one medical condition, and 18.3% had a Covid-19 risk score of ≥3.
The average number of residents per room decreased from 20 to 10. However, seven prisons
still averaged ≥20 occupants per room in October 2020, and 25 had ≥1 room with ≥20
occupants (Figures S5-S6). The proportion of residents in dormitories decreased from 37.1% to
30.9%, though a substantial fraction of higher risk residents were still housed in dormitories
(Figure S7).
By October 10, 81.8% (79,046) of still-incarcerated individuals had been tested for
Covid-19 at least once, and a total of 96,440 residents including those released between March
and October had been tested. Of the 96,440 residents, 15,162 were positive; 13,636 of these
cases resolved by October 10—3.2% were hospitalized, 0.3% were in intensive care units, and
0.5% died. Severe Covid-19 outcomes were most likely for older and higher risk residents
(Table 1, Table S3).
Participation in out-of-room activities other than labor decreased precipitously between
March and April 2020 and remained low through October. However, labor participation

decreased only slightly during the study period (Figure 2). The lowest levels of and the largest
decreases in labor participation were among residents aged ≥80 years, but more than 10% of
residents in this age group and more than 20% of 70-79 year-olds were still participating in labor
in October. These labor participation results were generally consistent according to resident risk
measures, prison types, and outbreak history (Figures S8-S14 and Table S5).
In the nine prisons with outbreaks that met our eligibility criteria for the multivariable risk
analysis, 21,750 eligible residents living in 6,928 rooms were tested at least once. Over 90
days, the cumulative percentage of each prison’s population tested ranged from 21.3 to 99.9%,
and the cumulative percentage of each prison’s population confirmed positive ranged from 2.4
to 45.1% (Figures S15-S16).
Rates of Covid-19 infection among residents of dormitories (≥3 occupants) were more
than double those among residents of cells (Adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 2.51; 95% Confidence
Interval [CI], 2.25-2.80; p<0.001) (Figure 3, Table S6). Residents of rooms with occupants
participating in out-of-room labor also had higher rates of infection compared to those without
participation (AHR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.39-1.74). These differences represent a cumulative risk of
infection that is 28.6 percentage points higher (95% CI, 16.7-30.6%; 62.1% vs. 33.4%) for
dormitories compared to cells, and 13.1 percentage points higher (95% CI, 12.8-13.3%; 53.7%
vs. 40.6%) for rooms with labor participation than for rooms without it. Estimates proved fairly
robust in sensitivity analyses (Tables S6-S8; Figure S17). While, in theory, residents with higher
Covid-19 risk scores may take greater precautions to avoid more severe consequences from
infection, analyses that included this variable did not detect an association with lower risks.

Discussion
Over a 7-month period following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the resident
population of California state prisons decreased by one-fifth and room occupancy halved.
However, many medically vulnerable residents remained incarcerated, and a substantial

proportion of them continued to live in dormitory housing and participate in work activities that
involved mixing. In nine prisons that experienced large outbreaks, we found that residents living
in rooms with ≥2 others had a 2.5-fold higher infection rate and that residents in a room whose
occupants participated in out-of-room work had a 1.6-fold higher rate.
Since the pandemic began CDCR has taken drastic steps to mitigate transmission and
stem outbreaks. Nonetheless, as of February 13, 2021, there had been 48,758 confirmed cases
among residents and 205 deaths. These represent substantially higher rates of infection and
mortality that state’s general population has experienced.
The patterns we observed suggest opportunities for further risk reduction. The
substantial numbers of older and higher-risk residents who continue to live in high occupancy
rooms is an important target group for prevention efforts. Members of those high-risk groups
who participate in group activities, or who share a room with others who do, are also an
important target group.
Our results are consistent with key messages from the limited evidence base on
respiratory infections in incarcerated populations (2-13, 20-22). The interconnected nature of the
residents of congregate institutions means that outbreaks, especially those that penetrate higher
occupancy rooms, can quickly become building or prison outbreaks. Correctional facilities,
nationally and internationally, should redouble efforts not only to prevent outbreaks but also to
increase protective measures taken for their large, medically vulnerable subpopulations,
including further reductions in the density of living arrangements (23).
Our access to person-level, daily data from a large prison system with high rates of
testing created analytical opportunities that recent studies of Covid-19 in incarcerated
populations have not had, including minimizing biases from selection into testing, However, our
study also had limitations. First, we could not identify networks of specific contacts, a limitation
that is likely to have mattered most to our estimates of the effect of labor participation. Second,
we used room occupancy to indicate in-room contacts because density measures (e.g.,

residents per square foot) were not available. The most plausible effect of misclassifying room
exposures would be to bias to the null our estimates of the effect of living in higher occupancy
rooms. Third, we lacked information on some potential exposures, such as contacts with staff
and during meals in common areas. Finally, although CDCR undertook extensive testing, not all
residents were tested and test frequency varied across institutions. If residents of dormitories or
of rooms with labor participation were tested relatively frequently, or testing there more precisely
targeted infected residents, our estimates of these factors on infection risk may be biased
upward.
Prisons remain particularly dangerous settings for Covid-19-related morbidity and
mortality. Our study shows that thousands of vulnerable incarcerated people continue to be
housed in settings where their risk of Covid-19 infection is high. Protective measures such as
decarceration, testing, vaccination, and efforts to enhance vaccine uptake remain vital (24).
Residents at greatest risk of transmission and infection, such as those living dormitories and
participating in labor, should be prioritized. Furthermore, as correctional systems offer
vaccination to residents, our study highlights the importance of prioritizing both those at highest
risk of adverse outcomes following infection and those most likely to contract and spread the
virus.

Figure Legends
Figure 1: CDCR incarcerated population size and average room occupancy over time:
Graph shows the change in total prison population size (left) and change in the average number
of roommates an individual in that prison has (right), for each of the 35 prisons, color-coded by
prison type, and for all prisons combined in black (only right panel), from March 1, 2020 (filled
circle) to October 10, 2020 (vertical bar). The outbreak prisons used in the multivariate risk
analysis are shown above the dashed line, and remaining prisons are shown below the dashed
line.
Figure 2: Biweekly participation in labor and other out-of-room activities by age:
Graph shows rolling average participation in activities, defined as whether an individual
participated in labor or other activities with at least one other person during any day in the past 2
weeks. Panels show (A) labor participation by age; (B) other participation by age. Data cover all
prisons from March 1, 2020 through October 10, 2020.
Figure 3. Adjusted cumulative risk of infection in outbreak prisons:
Graphs show the adjusted marginal cumulative risk of infection over 90 days from the start of a
prison outbreak for (A) room type and (B) room labor (i.e., whether anyone in the room
participated in out-of-room labor). Data includes 90 days follow-up for 9 prisons.
