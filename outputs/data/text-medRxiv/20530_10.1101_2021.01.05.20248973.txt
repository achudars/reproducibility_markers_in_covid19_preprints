Associations between Stress and Child Verbal Abuse and Corporal
Punishment during the COVID-19 Pandemic and Potential Effect
Modification by Lockdown Measures
Abstract
Background: Child abuse appears to be on the increase during the COVID-19 pandemic, but
the extent that lockdown measures modified the association between stress and abuses has
not been systematically assessed.

Objectives: To assess: 1) the association between caregiver's stress and self-reported verbal
abuse and corporal punishment of a child in the household, and; 2) modification of the stated
association by experienced COVID-19 lockdown measures.

Participants and settings: Caregivers residing in villages on lockdown in the Deep South of
Thailand (n=466 participants)

Methods: We randomly sampled 12 villages in the study area, and 40 households per village.
Trained enumerators who were residents of the sampled villages collected the data using
phone-based interview. We measured stress level using the standard ST-5 questionnaire. We
developed and pilot-tested questions for measurement of child abuse and lockdown
experiences specifically for this study.

Results: Caregivers with moderate and higher levels of stress were more likely than
caregivers with low level of stress to report verbal abuse (48% vs. 23%, respectively; Adj.
OR = 3.12, 95% CI = 1.89, 5.15) and corporal punishment (28% vs. 8%, respectively; Adj.

OR = 2.76, 95% CI = 1.41, 5.42). We found that COVID-19 lockdown experiences modified
the associations between stress and verbal abuse and corporal punishment.

Conclusion: There were associations between stress and abuses, which were modified by
lockdown experiences. However, social desirability, lack of details in the answers, and
potential confounding by mental illness co-morbidities were notable limitations of the study.
Caveat is advised in the interpretation of the study findings.

INTRODUCTION
Child abuse and victimization of children appears to have increased during the COVID-19
pandemic (Fore & Cappa, 2020; Petrowski et al., 2020; Ramaswamy & Seshadri, 2020).
Pandemic control ("lockdown") measures commonly include school closure. As school staff
commonly serve as screeners and reporters of child abuse and neglect, the occurrence of child
abuses during lockdown is likely to be under-reported (Barboza et al., 2020; Caron et al., 2020).
In the household, children can suffer verbal and physical abuses at the hands of their caregivers
(Babvey et al., 2020; Barboza et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020; Kovler et al., 2020; Lawson et
al., 2020; Tener et al., 2020). COVID-19 lockdown can result in job loss (Lawson et al., 2020),
loss of income, and material hardship (Xu et al., 2020), which are associated with parenting
stress (Xu et al., 2020) and acts of child abuse (Barboza et al., 2020; Lawson et al., 2020).

There have been calls for suggestions of strategies to mitigate the effects of lockdown on child
abuse (Fore & Cappa, 2020; Holmes et al., 2020; Kovler et al., 2020). Reframing coping
mechanism, an individualized internal factor, has been shown to mitigate the effect of job loss
on child abuse (Lawson et al., 2020). However, no study has directly measured the association
between stress experienced by caregivers and self-reported acts of child abuse in low and
middle-income country settings. Moreover, no study has assessed how COVID-19 lockdown
measures, i.e., external factors present at the community and societal level, can modify the
effect of stress on acts of child abuse.

Thailand is a middle-income country in South East Asia. Thailand has one of the biggest
informal economies in the world, with approximately half of the economy in the informal sector
(Buddhari & Rugpenthum, 2019). Restrictions of movement can immediately affect the

population's ability to earn livelihood. During the early phase of the pandemic, the Thai
government declared a state of emergency in late March 2020 (Thai Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, 2020). The government authorized provincial governors to implement lockdown at
locations where COVID-19 cases are found. These measures included restriction of movement
between communities, school closure, and restriction of business activities. However,
governors were allowed to modify the implementation of these measures as appropriate for
each specific location. Analyses of data from community-based survey of caregivers in these
outbreak areas can provide potentially useful basic information for relevant stakeholders. The
objectives of this study were to assess: 1) the extent that caregiver's self-reported stress is
associated with self-reported verbal abuse and corporal punishment of a child in the household,
and; 2) the extent that this relationship varied according to experienced COVID-19 lockdown
measures.

METHODS
Study Design and Setting
This cross-sectional study was part of a mixed-method rapid assessment survey of the situation
of children during COVID-19 lockdown in the Deep South of Thailand (Jeharsae et al., 2020).
The investigators collected data from villages on lockdown in the provinces of Pattani,
Narathiwat and Yala, near Thailand's border with Malaysia of approximately 7600 sq.km. in
total size and total population of approximately 2 million.

Study Instrument
The study instrument was a web-based interview questionnaire based on the Google Form
platform. The questionnaire included 65 questions divided into 6 sections: 1) Information about
the interviewer (for quality control purpose); 2) Characteristics of the participants; 3) Child
care practices during the COVID-19 pandemic; 4) Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the child;
5) Awareness of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children, and; 6) Stress assessment.
With the exception of the stress assessment section, all sections of the questionnaire were
developed by the investigators. Three experts assessed the study instrument for content validity
after its development. The investigators also pilot-tested the questionnaire online to assess
reliability before actual data collection.

Exposure Measurement: Self-Reported Stress
Self-reported stress was measured by interview in the Stress Assessment section of the
questionnaire. The section was adapted from the Srithanya Stress Scale-5 Items (ST-5), a Thai
language instrument designed for community-based self-assessment of emotional stress
(Silpakit, 2008). Our slightly modified version of the ST-5 was adopted for interview with the
following introduction and questions ("The following is a stress assessment questionnaire.

Please answer as truthfully as possible. Think of how you have felt during the past 2 weeks.
[How often did you...]: 1) Have problem sleeping, not being able to sleep or sleeping too much;
2) Have decreased concentration; 3) Feel irritable; 4) Feel bored; 5) Did not want to see
anyone"). Each question had 4 possible choices ("almost none" (0 point), "sometimes" (1
point), "frequently" (2 points), "regularly" (3 points)).

We summed the points on each question to obtain the ST-5 score. As per official guidelines
(Department of Mental Health, 2016), we considered participants who had 0-4 points on our
modified ST-5 as having "Low" level of stress, participants with 5-7 points as having
"Moderate" level of stress, participants with 8-9 points as having "High" level of stress, and
participants with 10-15 points as having "Severe" level of stress.

Outcome Measurement: Verbal Abuse of Children
We measured self-reported verbal abuse of child(ren) under 18 years of age by caregivers living
in the same household by the first question in Section 4 (Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on
the child), which was "During the past 1 month, have you used profanity or scolded a child
aged under 18 years because you were stressed from economic conditions?". The question had
four possible answer choices: 1) "Never"; 2) "Yes, 1-3 times per week"; 3) "Yes, 4-6 times per
week", and; 4) "Yes, daily". We considered participants who answered "Never" as those who
did not self-report verbal abuse of a child in the household, and everyone else as those who
did. We intended to treat those who did not provide an answer as having missing data, but all
respondents answered the question.

Outcome Measurement: Corporal Punishment of Children
In the second question of Section 4 (Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the child), we asked
"During the past 1 month, have you punished a child aged under 18 years by hitting because
you were stressed from economic conditions?". The question had the same four possible answer
choices as questions on verbal abuse. We considered participants who answered "Never" as
those who did not self-report corporal punishment of a child in the household, and everyone
else as those who did so. We planned to treat those who did not provide an answer as having
missing data, but all respondents answered the question.

Effect Modifier: Experienced Lockdown Measures
In the study area, residents of a village that was “on lockdown” were not allowed to travel to
another village except when purchasing provisions or seeing doctors. Residents were allowed
to conduct trade within the village, but authorities would not allow any person to enter or leave
the village premise.

We measured lockdown measures experienced by caregivers based on three questions in
Section 2 (Characteristics of the participants): 1) "Is your village under quarantine or restriction
of movement (no one moves into or out of the village)?"; 2) "Is someone from your household
currently in quarantine at a quarantine site?", and; 3) "Has someone in your household been
sick with COVID-19?". All questions had binary ("Yes" vs. "No") responses. We divided
participants into 3 "Lockdown Groups": Lockdown Group 1 (those whose village was not
under quarantine or restriction of movement); Lockdown Group 2 (those living in villages on
COVID-19 quarantine or restriction of movement but no household member was quarantined
or infected), and; Lockdown Group 3 (those living in villages on COVID-19 quarantine or
restriction of movement and someone in the household was quarantined or infected). When we

assessed the association between our exposure and outcomes, we stratified all analyses by
lockdown groups to assess effect modification accordingly.

Data Collection
We collected data during the month of June 2020, three months after the first lockdown was
announced in Thailand. The investigators first obtained a list of 98 villages on lockdown in the
study area from the provincial authorities' announcements. The investigators then sampled 4
villages from each province using stratified random sampling. The investigators contacted the
Sub-District Health Promotion Hospital serving the selected villages to obtain the list of
households in the village, filtered only households with at least one child aged less than 18
years according to the Health Promotion Hospital's database, and selected 40 of the filtered
households using simple random sampling, thus we sampled a total of 480 households.

The investigators then asked Health Promotion Hospital staff to recruit field enumerators from
residents of the targeted villages with at least a secondary school education who possessed their
own smart phone knew how to access the internet and use a phone-based internet browser. The
lead investigator then provided distance briefing for the enumerators, including the study
protocols, research ethics, and social distancing protocols in case of need to conduct face-toface interviews.

On the day of data collection. Health Promotion Hospital staff then provided the enumerators
with the phone number of the heads of sampled households in their village. The enumerators
then called the number and asked for the head of household's informed consent and permission
to conduct the survey. Heads of household gave informed consent or declined participation
verbally by phone. Whence the head of household gave verbal informed consent, the

enumerator then asked to speak to a family member who was deemed to be most closely
involved in the care of child(ren) aged under 18 years in the household. If the sampled
household did not have a listed phone number in their record, the enumerators were to visit the
household while following social distancing protocol and other proscribed precautionary
measures. However, such measure was not needed during data collection and all interviews
were conducted via phone conversations.

Statistical Analyses
We described the characteristics of the study participants, including prevalence of the exposure
and outcomes, using descriptive statistics. We assessed the association between stress level and
verbal abuse, and the association between stress level and corporal punishment, using
univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, stratified by level of experienced
hardship to assess effect modification. Given the unique characteristics of the social and
economic contexts of the pandemic and the lack of previous findings from the study area, we
decided to use a data-driven approach to identify confounders instead of using findings from
studies conducted a priori. We assessed associations between participants’ basic characteristics
and prevalence of the outcomes, and included all variables whose p-value of the association
was less than 0.15 in the respective multivariate logistic regression models. Whereas inclusion
of all variables resulted in malfunctions of the multivariate model, we excluded variables that
crashed the model before obtaining the final multivariate model. For quality control purpose,
we decided to exclude participants who indicated that their sub-district did not have a COVID19 infection from all analyses.

RESULTS
Among the 480 sampled households, 473 head of households gave verbal consent and
caregivers in the household agreed to participate. Among the 473 caregiver participants, there
were 7 participants who indicated that their sub-district did not have someone infected with
COVID-9 and were excluded from the study (n=466 participants). The majority of the
participants were women and a parent of at least one child in the household. Participants were
mostly Muslims, married, had secondary education or less, had household monthly income of
10,000 THB or less, and the primary source of the income was not from fixed salary (Table 1).
The majority of participants lived in a village under lockdown, although a small minority
reported that someone in their household was quarantined or infected with COVID-19. Most
participants reported low level of stress during the past month. Slightly more than one-fourth
of participants reported verbal abuse of a child in the past month, and one-tenth reported
corporal punishment.

Self-reported verbal abuse of children was positively associated with number of children in the
household, household primary income not coming from fixed salary, and perceived inadequacy
of household income (Table 2). Verbal abuse was negatively associated with caregiver's higher
level of education. The same patterns of association existed with regard to self-reported
corporal punishment of children (Table 3).

Caregivers with moderate or higher level of stress during past month had 3.1 times higher odds
of self-reported verbal abuse of children due to stress from economic conditions (Table 4). The
association was strongest among caregivers in Lockdown Group 2 (living in villages on
quarantine or restriction of movement but no household member was quarantined or infected)

and weakest among caregivers in Lockdown Group 3 (living in villages on quarantine or
restriction of movement and someone in the household was quarantined or infected). Similar
patterns existed for corporal punishment of children due to stress from economic conditions
(Table 5). Caregivers with moderate or higher level of stress during the past month had 2.8
times higher odds of corporal punishment. The association was strongest among caregivers in
Lockdown Group 2 and weakest among caregivers in Lockdown Group 3.

DISCUSSIONS
We found that associations between caregivers’ stress level and verbal abuse and corporal
punishment of a child in the household. We also found that experiencing lesser hardship (i.e.,
living in villages not on COVID-19 quarantine or restriction of movement, or living in villages
on COVID-19 quarantine or restriction of movement but with quarantined or infected family
members) buffered the stated associations. The findings of this study can potentially contribute
to the understanding of child abuse in the context of COVID-19 pandemic, although several
considerations should be made in the interpretation of the findings.

The Srithanya stress scale 5-items version (ST-5) was developed for rapid screening of stress
in community settings in Thailand, which suited the context of our study. However, responses
to the ST-5 correlates with those of tools used to measure depression and anxiety (Silpakit,
2008), thus those with higher score on the tool could have other mental health comorbidities
that were not measured. Stress is correlated with anxiety and depression (Brown et al., 2020),
and parents with anxiety and depression are more likely to maltreat their children (Brown et
al., 2020; Lawson et al., 2020), thus it is possible that the effect of confounding by
comorbidities could have influenced the observed findings. Furthermore, the answer choices
in the adapted ST-5 tool regarding frequency of stress symptoms were non-specific and
subjective to the respondent's own perception. The perceived frequency could be underestimated or over-estimated, which then affected the ST-5 score and stress categorization. If
the inaccuracies were systematically different between outcome and no-outcome groups, then
information bias could have been present in the findings. Future studies should consider
providing concise definitions for the categories (e.g., "The term 'Sometimes' refers to between
3 and 7 occasions during the past 2 weeks").

Our participants reported verbal abuse and corporal punishment due to stress, including among
those who reported infrequent or no symptom of stress according to the ST-5. Such findings
could have been influenced by differing windows of measurement for the outcomes and
exposure (history in past month for verbal abuse or corporal punishment, and history in past
two weeks for stress). In multiple settings, reports of child abuse decreased after lockdown
implementation (Barboza et al., 2020; Caron et al., 2020; Martins-Filho et al., 2020; Rapoport
et al., 2020) possibly due to school closure and consequent lack of reporting by school staff
(Barboza et al., 2020; Caron et al., 2020; Fore & Cappa, 2020; Jacob, 2020; Rapoport et al.,
2020; Thomas et al., 2020), despite worsening family dynamics(Tener et al., 2020) and drastic
increase in contact with helplines(Petrowski et al., 2020). In our study, social desirability as
well as the respondents' own perception of whether stress was the attributing factor for the act
of verbal abuse or corporal punishment could have led to under-reporting of the outcomes. In
that regard, we decided to use the context of corporal punishment of children under 18 years in
the household due to economic stress as proxy for direct question about physical abuse with
the intention to circumvent the influence of social desirability. Although corporal punishments
with extensive injury to the child can be considered physical abuse if the punishment results in
extensive injury(Coleman et al., 2010), our measurement question did not include details of the
punishment. Some acts of corporal punishment reported in our study might not be acts of child
abuse, and caveat is advised in the interpretation of these findings.

The associations between stress and verbal abuse and corporal punishment were weakest
among caregivers living in villages on quarantine or restriction of movement with quarantined
or ill family members. In other words, there seem to be effect modification by lockdown

experience, although we are not quite sure of the mechanism behind it. It is possible that some
of the household's children were quarantined or treated and placed in an area designated by the
state with chaprones instead of staying at home, which reduced the amount of contact between
the caregivers and the children and, subsequently, the opportunities where abuses could occur.
It is also possible that lockdown experiences were associated with economic or material
hardship, which was found to be associated with parenting stress (Xu et al., 2020). In that
regard, we did not directly ask participants about the extent that they experienced material
hardship, and future studies should consider making such measurements using tools recently
developed for household surveys (Fallon et al., 2020). In addition, the study area has
experienced by decades-long armed conflict with as many as 20,000 casualties(Deep South
Watch, 2020). Casualty was particularly heavy during the first decade of the conflict (Abuza,
2015; Human Rights Watch, 2007). The security situation deterred investment and created a
uniquely complex setting for this survey. Interpretation and generalization of findings from this
study should consider these contexts accordingly.

This is one of the first studies to assess how lockdown measures modifies the association
between stress and child abuses in a post-conflict setting. However, a number of limitations
should be considered in the interpretation of the study findings. Firstly, the cross-sectional
design of the study as well as the inconsistent windows of measurement for the exposure and
outcomes precludes the ability to make causal inferences. Secondly, abuses tended to be underreported, particularly by the abuser, thus the study findings are prone to social desirability bias.
Prevalence of the outcomes also could have been affected by the subjectivity of what the
respondents considered as acts of verbal abuse and corporal punishment attributable to stress.
Lastly, mental illness co-morbidities could have accounted for parts or all of the observed

17

associations, but these co-morbidities were not assessed. In other words, uncontrolled
confounding could have accounted, at least partially, for the study findings.

CONCLUSION
In a phone-based survey of residents in sub-districts of southern Thailand with COVID-19
cases, we found association between level of stress among caregivers and self-reported verbal
abuse and corporal punishment of children in their households, and that living in villages
without quarantine or restriction of movement and having family members under quarantine or
infected with COVID-19 mitigated the strength of these associations. However, a number of
limitations existed in the study, including potential under-reporting due to social desirability,
lack of details and ability to draw causal inferences, and potential confounding by mental
illness co-morbidities. Caveat is advised in the interpretation of the study findings.
