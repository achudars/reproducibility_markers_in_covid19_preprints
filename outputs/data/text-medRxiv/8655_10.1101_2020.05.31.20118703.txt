Abstract. We formulate three basic assumptions that should ideally guide any welldesigned COVID-19 prevalence study. We provide, on the basis of these assumptions
alone, a full derivation of mathematical formulas required for statistical analysis of testing
data. In particular, we express the disease prevalence in a population through those for its
homogeneous subpopulations. Although some of these formulas are routinely employed in
prevalence studies, the study design often contravenes the assumptions upon which these
formulas vitally depend. We also designed a natural prevalence estimator from the testing
data and studied some of its properties. The results are equally valid for diseases other
than COVID-19 as well as in non-epidemiological settings.

1. Introduction
Uncovering the true scale of COVID-19 pandemic is critical for shaping public health
policy and planning the comeback of economic and educational activities. This requires
conducting large-scale testing studies for the ongoing and past disease aimed at determination of the prevalence of the disease in a given population. Knowledge of this parameter
is also indispensable for estimating the true infection mortality rate of COVID-19.
A number of recently published studies of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and COVID-19 seroprevalence have stirred a considerable scientiﬁc and public controversy. The reasons include
suboptimal study design and ritualistic use of not fully disclosed statistical methods that
depend on various untestable assumptions. This creates an urgent need for methodological
clarity regarding mathematical, statistical and epidemiological foundations of testing for
COVID-19. The present article is a step in this direction. In particular, we explicitly state
three fairly minimal, yet very essential assumptions underlying our analysis and discuss
possible reasons for their violation using studies [1, 2] as an illustration. We provide detailed proofs of all the results that everyone can verify. The proofs depend on the three
aforementioned assumptions alone, and we specify which assumptions are required for each
of the results. Although it is uncommon for epidemiological studies to disclose all the details of statistical analysis, there is little doubt that some of our formulas were employed

in published prevalence studies; however, the design of these studies often contravenes the
assumptions upon which these formulas vitally depend.
In this article, we describe basic mathematical and statistical tools required for the
analysis of data resulting from a population disease prevalence study. In particular, we
compute in closed form (1) the distribution of the number, n, of recorded positive test
results when testing N individuals using a test with sensitivity α and speciﬁcity β; (2) the
conditional distribution of the number of true and false positive test results given that n
positive test results were observed; and (3) the expected value and variance of the true
number of infected individuals among those tested conditional on n, see Sections 3 and 4.
We also prove in Section 5 an Equivalence Principle that extends all the above results to
heterogeneous populations. Finally, we derive in Section 6 a natural statistical estimator
of the disease prevalence and discuss some of its properties.
Based on our results, the prevalence of the current or past disease reported in a population study can be checked for self-consistency by comparing the observed number of
positive cases with its theoretical prediction and by computing the expected number of
false positive and false negative test results and all the associated probabilities, see Sections 3 and 4 for more details. Finally, the basic assumptions formulated in Section 2 may
inform the design of future COVID-19 studies.
Given the current acute interest in SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, we will be using the
terminology and biological considerations pertaining to COVID-19 testing. However, all
the results are applicable in equal measure to testing for other diseases or conditions as
well as in non-epidemiological settings.
The mathematical exposition in this article is accessible to biomedical scientists and
health practitioners with a basic knowledge of discrete probability.
2. Basic Assumptions
We start by spelling out our assumptions. Their formulation and discussion are tailored
to testing for COVID-19.
A. Independence. The events of a current or past infection in all tested individuals are
stochastically independent.
Although this assumption is indispensable for a valid statistical analysis, its violations
in prevalence studies are common. One particular reason is excessive inclusion of members
of the same household in a data set used for prevalence estimation. Among the aims of the
Gangelt study [1], that was conducted on March 31-April 6, 2020 in the community of Gangelt in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, was to determine the excess risk of contracting
COVID-19 for someone who lives in the same household with an infected individual. It

was found that the risk of such secondary infection increases by 28.1%, 20.2% and 2.8% for
households with two, three and four people, respectively, relative to the 15.5% risk of the
primary infection [1]. Given that 919 participants of the Gangelt study for whom valid test
results for SARS-CoV-2 and/or IgA, IgG antibodies were obtained belonged to only 405
households, the validity of Assumption A for this study is questionable. The same applies
to the Santa Clara study, conducted on April 3-4, 2020 in Santa Clara county, CA [2].
In that study, among 3,390 participants whose specimens were analyzed there were 2,747
adults and 643 children living in the same household with some of these adults [2]. The
validity of Assumption A is also problematic if disproportionately many study participants
attended a known COVID-19 super-spreading event. In fact, investigation of the eﬀects of
one such event, carnival festival held around February 15, 2020 in Gangelt, revealed that
the infection rate among the event participants was 2.6 higher than among non-participants
and that the course of the disease was much more severe in the former than in the latter
[1].
B. Test Uniformity. Both sensitivity and specificity of the test are identical for all tested
individuals.
Although almost universally accepted, this assumption may prove in ceratin cases questionable. For example, in some asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic carriers of COVID-19,
the number of viral particles on a nasal or pharyngeal swab may be too low to be detectable
by PCR test while the titer of IgA or IgM antibodies that serve as a marker of an ongoing
disease may not exceed the detection threshold of a serological test. As yet another example, in convalescent COVID-19 patients the virus may already be undetectable while the
titer of IgG antibody may be not detectable yet. In all such cases, the diagnostic sensitivity of the test will be reduced. Also, cross-reactivity with viral fragments or antibodies to
another virus may increase the rate of false positive responses in those subjects who at the
time of testing are, or have recently been, infected with another similar pathogen, e.g. a
coronavirus causing the common cold. Such cross-reactivity would lead to a reduction in
test speciﬁcity.
C. Random Sampling. N tested individuals were recruited by random sampling from the
population of interest.
The validity of this assumption may be thwarted by over-sampling from the same household. It may also prove suspect if recruitment for testing involves signiﬁcant opportunity
for self-selection making it likely that people who surmise that they have, or have had, the
disease volunteer for the study. For example, the Santa Clara study recruited volunteers
who responded to an advertisement posted on Facebook [2]. By contrast, the Gangelt
study’s initial recruitment involved generating a random sample of 600 community members with distinct last names and mailing them an invitation to participate in the study,

clearly in line with Assumption C. However, the research team allowed the participants to
bring in other members of their household for testing. Out of these 600 individuals, 407
responded, which resulted in 1,007 study participants from 405 households who underwent
testing for COVID-19 [1].
It is helpful to realize that the prevalence of present or past disease in a population may
be quite heterogeneous across its various subpopulations. These subpopulations may be
determined by such observable attributes as the presence of speciﬁc co-morbidities, age, sex,
race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and occupation, or their combinations. In the case of
COVID-19, the eﬀects of these attributes on the infection risk have been well-documented.
For example, health care workers are generally exposed to much higher doses of SARS-CoV2, and more frequently, than members of the general population and as a result have much
higher prevalence of the disease. Other presently unknown variables associated e.g. with the
genetic make-up or functioning of the immune and circulatory systems may prove important
for proper prevalence stratiﬁcation and estimation. Selection of subpopulations for a given
study depends on the current knowledge about the epidemiology of the disease and the
practicality of recruiting a suﬃcient number of study participants from each subpopulation.
In the Gangelt study, no explicitly deﬁned subpopulations were speciﬁed except for those
deﬁned implicitly by the number of household members, co-morbidities and participation
in the COVID-19 super-spreading event. In the Santa Clara study, the subpopulations
were determined by sex, race and zip code. To mitigate signiﬁcant violation of Assumption
C (resulting, for example, in the fact that 63.7% of study participants for whom valid test
results were obtained were females while the overall fraction of females in the Santa Clara
county is 49.5%), the test results were subsequently re-weighted [2].
The overall logic and ﬂow of exposition in the rest of the article is as follows. In Sections
3 and 4, we derive all our results, under Assumptions A and B, for a single homogeneous
population where it can be assumed that the probability to have a current or past infection
is the same for all individuals. Next, in Section 5, we establish, based on Assumption C, the
Equivalence Principle for heterogeneous populations. This allows us extend all our results
under Assumptions A-C to the general case of a heterogeneous population consisting of any
number of homogeneous subpopulations. Finally, in Section 6 we use our results to design
a prevalence estimator and discuss some of its properties.
3. Distribution of the Number of True and False Positive Test Results
Consider a test with a binary outcome (positive/negative) administered to N individuals. Let α be the sensitivity and β be the speciﬁcity of the test. Suppose that the test
resulted in n, 0 ≤ n ≤ N, positive outcomes. Let X, Y, Z be the respective unobservable
numbers of true positive, false positive and false negative test results and U = X + Y be

the observed total number of positive results. Denote by M the unknown true number of
presently or previously infected individuals (depending on the nature of the test) among
N individuals selected from a population thought of, for the time being, as homogeneous
with regard to prevalence of the disease. Below we seek to compute, under Assumptions
A and B stated in Section 2, the distribution of random variables X, Y, Z, U and the conditional distributions of X and Y given that U = n. Additionally, in the next section we
will compute in closed form the conditional expectation and variance of random variable
M given that U = n.
It follows from Assumption A that the distribution of random variable M is binomial
B(N, p), where p is the disease prevalence in the tested population:
(
)
N
P (M = m) =
pm (1 − p)N −m , 0 ≤ m ≤ N.
(1)
m
If M = m is ﬁxed then each infected individual receives a positive test result, independently
of other individuals (Assumption A), with the same probability α, the sensitivity of the test
(Assumption B), or a negative test result with probability 1 − α. Then for the respective
numbers, X and Z, of true positive and false negative test results we have
(
)
m
P (X = x|M = m) =
αx (1 − α)m−x , 0 ≤ x ≤ m,
(2)

(

and
P (Z = z|M = m) =

m

)
(1 − α)z αm−z ,

0 ≤ z ≤ m.

Similarly, according to Assumption B every healthy individual receives a false positive result
with the same probability 1 − β, where β is the test’s speciﬁcity. Thus, for the random
number, Y, of false positives we have
(
)
N −m
P (Y = y|M = m) =
(1 − β)y β N −m−y , 0 ≤ y ≤ N − m.
(3)
y
Importantly, it follows from Assumption A that, for every m, random variables X, Y and
Z are conditionally independent given M = m.
Due to Assumptions A and B the number, X, of true positive test results is a thinning
of the binomial random variable M with probability α. In general, thinning of a sequence
of random events is their independent marking, or ﬁltration, with the same probability; for
more on thinning, see [3]. It is well-known, and easy to verify formally by compounding
distributions (1) and (2), that X has binomial distribution B(N, αp). Likewise, Y is a
thinning of the binomial random variable N − M with probability 1 − β and has the
distribution B[N, (1−β)(1−p)] while the distribution of random variable Z is B[N, (1−α)p].

We now compute the joint distribution of random variables X and Y. Notice that if
X = x and Y = y then any admissible value, m, of random variable M must satisfy the
inequalities x ≤ m ≤ N − y. Using the formula of total probability, invoking equations (1)(3), rearranging the factors, making a change of variable j = m − x and ﬁnally employing
Newton’s binomial formula we have for all x, y ≥ 0 such that 0 ≤ x + y ≤ N

(4)

Thus, random vector (X, Y, N − X − Y ) has trinomial distribution
M ult[N ; αp, (1 − β)(1 − p), (1 − α)p + (1 − p)β].
From this we conclude by lumping together true and false positive test results and combining the probabilities of these outcomes that the distribution of U = X + Y, the total
number of positive test results, is binomial B(N, λ), i.e.
(

P (U = n) =

where
λ = αp + (1 − β)(1 − p) and 1 − λ = (1 − α)p + β(1 − p).

true and false positives given the observed total number of positive results:

Therefore, the posterior distributions of the number of true and false positives given the
observed number, n, of positive test results are B(n, θ) and B(n, 1 − θ), respectively.
Formula (7) is remarkably similar to the one describing the conditional distribution
P (X = x|X + Y = n), 0 ≤ x ≤ n, in the case of two independent Poisson random variables
X and Y [4, Section 9.3, pp. 277-278].
Distributions (7) and (8) have three notable features:
(a) They are independent of the number, N, of tested individuals;
(b) Parameters θ and 1 − θ given by (9) represent the predictive positive and negative values
that can be obtained by applying the Bayes formula to the prior probabilities 1 − p and p,
respectively;
(c) Distributions (7) and (8) depend on a single parameter
αp
(1 − β)(1 − p)
that combines the basic parameters p, α, β.
The extraordinary simplicity of formulas (5), (7) and (8) should not becloud the fact
that their validity depends critically on Assumptions A and B.
4. The Expected Number of Infected Individuals for a Given Number
of Positive Test Results
As will be shown in Section 6, population prevalence can be estimated based on a
formula for the conditional expectation of the number, M, of infected individuals given
U = n positive test results. The conditional distribution of random variable M given that
U = n has the following form
P (M = m|U = n) =

where P (U = n) was speciﬁed in (5)-(6) and x must satisfy the inequalities 0 ≤ x ≤ m, x ≤
n and n − x ≤ N − m or equivalently
a(m, n) := max{n + m − N, 0} ≤ x ≤ min{m, n} =: b(m, n).

(11)

Although formulas (1)-(3) and (5) combined with (10) lead to an explicit expression for
the conditional probability P (M = m|U = n), the latter does not seem to be reducible to
a simple form. However, the corresponding expectation and variance can be computed in
closed form, as we show below.
According to (10), in order to ﬁnd the conditional expectation E(M |U = n) and variance
V ar(M |U = n), we need to compute, for ℓ = 1, 2, the following quantity:
Aℓ (n) =

mℓ P (M = m)

P (X = x|M = m)P (Y = n − x|M = m),

where the bounds for variable x are given in (11). The range for pairs (x, m) has a simpler
form
{(x, m) : 0 ≤ x ≤ n, x ≤ m ≤ x + N − n}.
Therefore, switching the order of summation, changing the variable in the internal sum to
j = m − x and using formulas (1)-(3) we obtain

binomial distribution B(n, γ). Thus, from (10) we obtain

Therefore, from (13) and (6) we ﬁnally obtain
V ar(M |U = n) = E(M 2 |U = n) − [E(M |U = n)]2

5. The Equivalence Principle for Heterogeneous Populations
In Sections 3 and 4 we considered a population that was assumed homogeneous in
the sense that all individuals in the population had the same probability, p, to have a
current or past infection. The goal of this section is to show how all our results can be
generalized to a heterogeneous population consisting of r homogeneous subpopulations.
∑
Let w = (w1 , w2 , ..., wr ), where ri=1 wi = 1, be the vector of relative sizes (weights) of
these subpopulations and p = (p1 , p2 , ..., pr ) be the vector of their disease prevalences.
For a non-negative integer vector x with r components, we will use the following no∑
tation: | x | = ri=1 xi and x! = Πri=1 xi !. Also, for two such vectors x and y we denote
∑
x · y = ri=1 xi yi , xy = (x1 y1 , x2 y2 , ..., xr yr ) and xy = Πri=1 xi yi . Finally, y ≤ x means that
yi ≤ xi for all i = 1, 2, ..., r.
Let Ni , 1 ≤ i ≤ r, be the number of individuals from i−th subpopulation among N
tested individuals. Then under the random sampling assumption (Assumption C), random
vector N = (N1 , N2 , ..., Nr ) with | N | = N has multinomial distribution M ult(N, w) :
P (N = x) =

N! x
w ,
x!

| x | = N.

(15)

Denote by Mi the number of infected individuals among Ni , 1 ≤ i ≤ r. Random vector
M = (M1 , M2 , ..., Mr ) represents a component-wise thinning of random vector N with
the vector of thinning probabilities p. What is the distribution of random vector M? The
computation given below shows that, by contrast to the binomial case, it is not multinomial!
Assumption A and subpopulation homogeneity imply that that for any i, 1 ≤ i ≤ r,
the distribution of random variable Mi conditional on Ni = xi is binomial B(xi , pi ). Also,
conditional on N = x, where | x | = N, components of random vector M are, according
to Assumption A, independent. Therefore, for any vector y such that | y | ≤ N, we have

Therefore, the total number of infected individuals among N people tested follows
binomial distribution B(N, p · w). Comparison between formulas (17) and (1) leads to the
following Equivalence Principle:
The distribution of the number of infected individuals among N individuals selected at
random from a heterogeneous population consisting of r homogeneous subpopulations with
weights w1 , w2 , ..., wr and disease prevalences p1 , p2 , ..., pr is the same as for a homogeneous
population with prevalence

Thus, all the results in Sections 3 and 4 derived for a homogeneous population with
disease prevalence p are valid for a heterogeneous population if one selects p in accordance
with formula (18). This conclusion is, of course, only natural; however, it depends on
Assumptions A-C in very essential ways.
6. Prevalence Estimation
If N individuals randomly drawn from a population of interest were tested and n positive
test results were observed then a “naı̈ve” estimate of the prevalence of the current or past
disease in the population is p0 = n/N. The testing process can be thought of as the following
mental experiment: for an infected individual, a coin is ﬂipped that lands “heads” with
probability α and “tails” with probability 1 − α while for a healthy individual, another coin
is ﬂipped that lands “heads” with probability 1 − β and “tails” with probability β. In these
terms, p0 is the fraction of “heads” recorded for N independent replications of this random
experiment. Therefore, p0 depends on the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the test and the
prevalence of the disease. To untangle them and ﬁnd an estimator of the prevalence alone,
recall that the distribution of the number of positive test results is binomial B(N, λ), see
Section 3. Because p0 is a consistent unbiased estimator of λ = αp + (1 − β)(1 − p) we can
set for the desired estimate, p̂, of the population prevalence p the following equation
αp̂ + (1 − β)(1 − p̂) = p0 .

Thus, p̂ is the population prevalence that would produce, on average, the same fraction of
positive test results when N individuals are tested as the one actually observed. Solving
this equation and assuming that α + β > 1 (a condition always met in practice) we obtain
p̂ =

p0 + β − 1
.
α+β−1

(20)

Note that this estimator was employed in [2]. Observe that 0 ≤ p̂ ≤ 1 if and only if
1 − β ≤ p0 ≤ α. Thus, estimator p̂ is not feasible in the cases where population prevalence
is smaller than the test’s false positive rate or larger than the test’s speciﬁcity.
Estimator (20) can be obtained alternatively on the basis of the conditional distribution
of the number, M, of infected individuals among those tested given the observed number
of positive test results. Recall that in view of (13)
αp
(1 − α)p
E(M |U = n)
=
p0 +
(1 − p0 ).
(21)

λ
1−λ
The main diﬃculty here is that this estimator depends on the unknown prevalence parameter p that we want to estimate. A natural idea, then, would be to ﬁnd the value of p for
which f (p) = p and take it as a prevalence estimator. Using expression (6) for λ we get
after some algebra
f (p) :=

f (p) − p =

p(1 − p)(1 − α − β)[p(α + β − 1) + 1 − β − p0 ]
.
λ(1 − λ)

Therefore, in view of (20) in the case where α + β > 1, 0 < p < 1 and 1 − β ≤ p0 ≤ α the
required ﬁxed point of function f is exactly the above estimator p̂! Therefore, according to
(21) the estimator p̂ represents the expected fraction of infected individuals among those
tested given the observed number of positive test results.
The estimator p̂ has the following remarkable feature that can be termed the “mixtureinvariance” property. Suppose that the population of interest consists of r subpopulations,
each of which is either homogeneous or a mixture of homogeneous sub-subpopulations. Let
Ni ≥ 1 be the number of tested individuals from i−th subpopulation and ni be the number
of positive outcomes, based on the same test. Denote by p̂i the above prevalence estimate
for i−th subpopulation and set ŵi = Ni /N, where N = N1 + N2 + ... + Nr . Finally, assume
that α + β > 1 and 1 − β ≤ ni /Ni ≤ α for all i. Then for p̂, the prevalence estimate for the
entire population, we have

It follows from (24) that p0 is a weighted average of the ratios ni /Ni , which implies, due to
their above-assumed bounds for these ratios, that 1 − β ≤ p0 ≤ α. We now continue (23)

The invariance property (22) can be used to combine prevalence estimates for several
subpopulations of a given population obtained within the same study, or diﬀerent studies
utilizing the same test, into a prevalence estimate for the entire population.
7. Discussion and Recommendations
In this article, we derived formulas for the distribution of the number of positive test
results for a test with given sensitivity and speciﬁcity administered to N individuals randomly selected from a given population as well as for the conditional distribution of the
unobservable number of true and false positive test results given the observed number, n,
of positive test outcomes. Also, we found closed form expressions for the expected value
and variance of the unknown true number of infected individuals among those tested conditional on the observed value of n. These results led us to a natural estimator, p̂, of the
population prevalence, see formula (20). We initially derived our results in Sections 3 and
4 for a homogeneous population; however, in Section 5 we gave a rigorous proof of the
Equivalence Principle stating that in the case of a heterogeneous population, one has only
to replace the population prevalence with the average of the prevalences of homogeneous
subpopulations of the given population weighted by their relative sizes, see formula (18).
Finally, we proved a similar “mixing-invariance” property for the prevalence estimator, see
formula (22).
Importantly, we spelled out the three assumptions required for the validity of each of
these formulas explicitly, see Section 2. We discussed these assumptions and illustrated
possible reasons for their violation using the well-known Gangelt [1] and Santa Clara [2]
studies as examples. It is somewhere between likely and certain that some of the formulas
derived in this article were used in one form or another in the published COVID-19 prevalence studies. However, it is also certain that suboptimal study design of some of these
studies violated the assumptions upon which these formulas critically depend. This contradiction may cast doubt on the validity of COVID-19 prevalence estimates that resulted
from these studies.
Note that in this article we never used any asymptotic arguments, i.e. those applicable

to large values of N. Therefore, our results can be used for any sample size N, no matter
how small.
We conclude with a list of speciﬁc recommendations regarding the design of testing
studies and statistical methodology informed by our analysis.
1. Including in the same prevalence analysis of multiple groups of subjects from the
same household and disproportionately large groups of individuals who participated in the
same COVID-19 super-spreading event should be avoided. The same applies to individuals
who were in close and/or protracted contact with each other without PPE. Likewise, selfselection of subjects for the study makes prevalence estimates unreliable.
2. Knowledge disease prevalence estimates, resulting from the data obtained on the
same testing platform, for subpopulations with known demographic weights leads automatically, through the aforementioned “mixing-invariance” principle, to a prevalence estimate
for a heterogeneous population comprised of these subpopulations without the need for a
separate de novo study.
3. The “naı̈ve” prevalence estimator p0 = n/N is a function of the true population
prevalence and the test’s sensitivity and speciﬁcity. The correct “disentangled” estimator,
p̂, is given by formula (20). Additionally, p0 may deviate considerably from p̂. For example,
for a perfectly speciﬁc test (β = 1), one has p̂ = p0 /α. Thus, the use of p0 as prevalence
estimator should be discouraged.
4. Prevalence estimation for a population with high prevalence requires a very sensitive
tests while for populations with low prevalence, a very speciﬁc tests should be employed.
