Abstract
COVID-19 testing across India uses a mix of two types of tests. Rapid Antigen Tests
(RATs) are relatively inexpensive point-of-care lateral-flow-assay tests, but they are also
less sensitive. The reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) test has
close to 100% sensitivity and specificity in a laboratory setting, but delays in returning
results, as well as increased costs relative to RATs, may vitiate this advantage.
India-wide, about 49% of COVID-19 tests are RATs, but some Indian states, including
the large states of Uttar Pradesh (pop. 227.9 million) and Bihar (pop. 121.3 million)
use a much higher proportion of such tests. Here we show, using simulations based on
epidemiological network models, that the judicious use of RATs can yield
epidemiological outcomes comparable to those obtained through RT-PCR-based testing
and isolation of positives, provided a few conditions are met. These are (a) that RAT
test sensitivity is not too low, (b) that a reasonably large fraction of the population, of
order 0.5% per day, can be tested, (c) that those testing positive are isolated for a
sufficient duration, and that (d) testing is accompanied by other non-pharmaceutical
interventions for increased effectiveness. We assess optimal testing regimes, taking into
account test sensitivity and specificity, background seroprevalence and current test
pricing. We find, surprisingly, that even 100% RAT test regimes should be acceptable,
from both an epidemiological as well as a economic standpoint, provided the conditions
outlined above are met.

Author summary
Using network models, we study optimal ways of combining low sensitivity, relatively
inexpensive point-of-care rapid antigen tests for COVID-19 with higher sensitivity but
more expensive laboratory RT-PCR tests. We take into account background
seroprevalence and current test pricing for such tests in India, finding that even purely
rapid antigen test-based regimes can produce the same reduction in overall infections
that pure RT-PCR tests are capable of. This is provided one can test at scale and isolate

Introduction

1

The number of COVID-19 cases in India increased at a relatively slow rate for several
weeks after the first case was recorded on January 30, 2020. This was, in large part, due
to an early and stringent country-wide lockdown that stretched to nearly 70 days [1, 2].
After the lockdown was lifted, the pace of increase accelerated. The number of daily
new cases reached a peak of just below 98,000 by the middle of September. There has
been a subsequent sustained decline in incidence and somewhat less than 20,000 new
cases are currently being recorded daily [3].
Multiple serological studies inform our understanding of COVID-19 spread in India,
among them two large-scale serosurveys conducted by the Indian Council of Medical
Research (ICMR) [4]. These indicate that about 0.73% (95% CI : 0.34 – 1.13) of the
adult Indian population may have been infected by early May, 2020. This fraction is
estimated to have risen to 7.1% (95% CI : 6.2 – 8.2) by August, 2020 [4]. These studies,
alongside others, indicate that COVID-19 spread across India has been extremely
inhomogeneous. Among the large Indian cities, for Mumbai, a seropositivity of 57.8%
(slums) and 17.4% (non-slum) was reported in a study conducted between 29 June and
19 July, 2020 [5]. In Delhi, a seropositivity of 23% was obtained in a study conducted
between 27 June and 10 July, 2020 [6]. A subsequent study in Delhi, conducted in early
August, obtained a seropositivity of 29.1% [7]. For Pune, in a study conducted between
July 20 and Aug 5, 2020, an overall seropositivity of 51.3% was reported [8]. For the
state of Karnataka, an overall infected population fraction of 27.3% – with that fraction
including a large number of active cases – was obtained in a study conducted from early
to mid-September, 2020 [9]. These studies point to extensive spread, dominated by the
urban agglomerations that account for about 30% of the Indian population [10].
Surprisingly, the states of Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Bihar, have seen relatively small
numbers of cases relative to the size of their population [11, 12]. Whether case and
mortality numbers in these states reflect reality is a topic of some current debate [13].
The importance of these states derives from their sheer size: if the state of UP were an
independent nation it would be the fifth most populous in the world [14]. (Every
country in Africa, Europe, and South America has fewer people than the state of UP.)
Bihar, India’s third most populous state, is the third largest sub-national entity in the
world by population [15]. Bihar ranks at the bottom of India’s state-level SDG index
while UP fares only a little better, at five slots above [16, 17]. Thus, understanding
mitigation strategies for COVID-19 in these states may hold broader lessons for other
parts of the developing world, in particular for low income countries (LICs.)
Before vaccines become generally available, testing at scale for the presence of
infection can blunt the progress of the pandemic. Testing, in general, serves two
purposes. For clinical purposes, it concentrates on identifying disease in symptomatic
patients, while testing for epidemiological purposes attempts to identify disease in
patients who may be asymptomatic as well, so that spread in the population can also be
assessed. India currently tests 1 – 1.5 million people each day, less than 0.1% of the
Indian population of approximately 1.34 billion. About 49% of these tests are RAT
tests, principally the SD Biosensor test (SD Biosensor Standard Q COVID 19 Antigen
test). This was the first to be certified by ICMR [18–20]. The remaining 51% are very
largely RT-PCR tests. (TrueNat and CBNAAT tests, both PCR-based tests that use a
technology developed for tuberculosis testing, provide a small fraction, of less than 5%,
towards the total.)
While test availability was a major initial concern, the issue of sensitivity of these

tests has attracted more recent attention. RATs have lower analytical sensitivity than
PCR-based tests, but a comparable specificity. For an RAT kit to be approved in India,
the ICMR requires it to have a minimum specificity of 95% and a sensitivity of 50% [18].
An initial advisory from the ICMR indicated that the SD Biosensor RAT performance,
as measured in two independent labs, showed a sensitivity of 50.6% and 84%, with a
specificity of 99.3% and 100%, respectively [18]. A more recent field evaluation yielded a
sensitivity and specificity of 70.0% (95% CI: 60 - 79) and 92% (95% CI: 87 - 96)
respectively [21]. An additional study of the same test obtained 76.6% (95% CI 63-86)
sensitivity and 99.3% (CI 98.6 - 99.6) specificity [22].
It has been suggested that low case numbers in UP and Bihar might reflect that fact
that the rapid antigen tests are missing infections [20, 23, 24]. RAT positivity in both
UP and Bihar is less than 1%, while the RT-PCR positivity is around 2.8% [25]. This
difference has attracted concern, since in both these states the fraction of RATs vs.
RT-PCR tests is larger than the fraction across India, with RAT fractions of
approximately 59% (UP) and 87% (Bihar) [23, 26]. There have been calls for the
reduction in use of RATs and for their replacement by PCR-based tests. Sustained
pressure from the Indian states and central government may account for recent steep
reductions in the costs of the RT-PCR tests, although they remain more expensive than
the RATs. A broader concern with the RT-PCR tests are delays in reporting [27]. These
delays have been reported to be anywhere between 24 hours to a week or more [27].
Testing regimes that are accurate, comprehensive and affordable are clearly
preferable to those that fail on one or more of these counts. However, what is possible
in practice is often only some reasonable triangulation between these. Understanding
what testing regimes are optimal for India requires reasonable estimates of how much
testing levels can be ramped up, the relative costs of the two types of tests, the mix of
the two tests, as well as a target for the reduction of new infections through such
epidemiological screening.
This paper explores, through computational models, the epidemiological
consequences of different testing regimes that combine RAT and RT-PCR tests, in a
situation where population seroprevalence is of order 20%. (This is a reasonable
estimate for the Indian states of UP and Bihar.) We use a network model that combines
a compartmental model of infection spread with movement of individuals between
different locations. Our testing protocol prioritizes symptomatic individuals for testing.
It uses any tests left over on the remaining population at random till all tests allocated
for that day are exhausted. We vary test rates as a fraction of the population between
0.1% and 1.0% per day, the test sensitivity across values believed to be accurate for the
RAT tests, and the mix of RAT and PCR tests given a total amount of testing, ranging
between all RT-PCR to all RAT tests. (RT-PCR tests are treated as the gold standard,
with 100% sensitivity and specificity). We quantify tradeoffs between different testing
regimes by evaluating the total number of people infected at the end of the pandemic
under each regime, comparing this to the scenario where no interventions are made.
This helps us calculate optimal testing scenarios required to reach a specified
suppression of the pandemic, for example a reduction in the total numbers of infected
from 65% to 50%.
We find that testing regimes which rely solely on RAT tests are, surprisingly,
capable of achieving the same suppression of the epidemic as an RT-PCR-based testing
regime can, even with test sensitivities of 70%. What is crucial is to test larger fractions
of the population at more regular intervals. This is consistent with prior work which
also indicated that test sensitivity is secondary to the frequency of testing. In addition,
isolating those who test positive is another important step. Depending on delays in
returning test results, quarantining families of those who are symptomatic can add a
further layer of control. We demonstrate that such testing and quarantining

Model and Methods

Compartmental Model description

104

Our model contains 7-compartments. These are (S)usceptible, (A)symptomatic,
(P)resymptomatic, Mildly Infected (MI), Severely Infected (SI), (H)ospitalized, and
(R)ecovered. These are shown in Fig. 1. Black solid lines with arrows indicate
transitions between states, while dotted lines denote influences. We assume in this
paper that recovered individuals are immune to further infection. We ignore deaths,
although they could be easily incorporated into this general framework [28].

Fig 1. Schematic of the epidemiological model. Boxes show the 7 compartments
of the model, i.e., the set of states that characterise each individual in the population.
The compartments are (S)usceptible, (A)symptomatic, (P)resymptomatic, Mildly
Infected (MI), Severely Infected (SI), (H)ospitalized, and (R)ecovered. Black arrows
indicate possible transitions between states. The dotted lines indicate that the rate of
infection of Susceptible individuals is an increasing function of the number of infected
individuals they are in contact with. Recovered individuals are assumed to be immune
to further infection.

Fig 2. Schematic of the network. Individuals exist on a location network,
consisting of homes and work places, connected by links along which people can move.
For each individual there is a link between their home and their work place. Within
each location, individuals can transition between the different infection states described
in Fig 1. A subset of work places are designated as hospitals, where people are moved
(and quarantined) when they transition from the SI to the H state. When the recover,
they are moved back to their homes and can resume movement between their home and
work. In addition, if a person tests positive they and their home are quarantined, with
no movement being allowed out of the home for 14 days (we explore several variants of
this protocol as described in subsequent sections).

Network Model description

122

Given the disease progression of Fig. 1, we incorporate these elements into a network
model [42–44]. Our schematic network is shown in Fig. 2. It shows two categories of
locations: homes and workplaces. A subset of workplaces are designated as hospitals.
In Fig. 3 we show an example of the kind of network we use as a graph on which
disease dynamics proceeds. The nodes represent locations: nodes indicated in grey are
homes and black nodes are work locations. Hospitals are shown as blue nodes.
Undirected links represent individuals and connect the home of that individual to
their work location. The color of these links represents the infection state of the
individual. Yellow links represent susceptible individuals, red links represent those
infected and green links represent those who have recovered.

Each individual has one home and one workplace. (We make this assumption for
simplicity, but more complex networks, where individuals move between several
locations, can just as easily be modelled within our framework.) Within a 24-hour cycle,
all individuals move once from home to workplace and back. We consider individuals
whose workplace happens to be a hospital as designated health-care workers. Each
location is considered to be a well-mixed system.
At any given time, each location represents a fully connected network of individuals.
However, the number of individuals in any given location varies as they move from
homes to workplaces and back. In the absence of testing, the rate at which a susceptible
person becomes infected is proportional to the product of the number of infectious

people at their current location and the infectivity parameter β, divided by a
normalization factor which is related to the local population at that location as
described below. This corresponds to frequency-dependent scaling of
transmission [29, 45, 46].
Testing, quarantining, and hospitalization of individuals add further layers of
complexity to the model, as described in more detail in subsequent sections. If an
individual transits into the Hospitalized compartment they are immediately moved to a
randomly chosen hospital, where they remain until they have recovered and are moved
back to their home location.
Individuals who test positive are confined to their homes for 14 days (chosen to be
longer than their average recovery time). In this case, they are no longer allowed to
move to their work locations for the duration of confinement. Furthermore, their overall
infectivity is reduced by a factor of ten, to simulate limited contact with the others in
their family. The same holds true for hospitalized individuals, since we assume that
measures have been put in place in hospital locations to ensure that individuals do not
leave until they have recovered, and are less infectious.

individuals currently in that location Ni in all locations except for hospitals, where this
number is changed to an effective N , related to the total number of healthcare workers

For example, a hospital location with 40 healthcare workers and 60 hospitalized
individuals will have a total normalization factor of (40 + 0.1 × 60) = 46, instead of 100.
Here, assigning hospitalized individuals a tenth of the weight in the normalization
factor, as compared to other individuals, accounts for the fact that hospitals have
measures in place to reduce infectivity, such as the compulsory use of PPE.

Eligibility for testing

181
182

183

Except where mentioned otherwise, testing is started when 20% of the population has
recovered from the disease. Each day a fixed number of tests are performed, determined
by the testing rate parameter. These are targeted at symptomatic individuals across all
locations (both severely and mildly infected), who are given first preference for the tests.
(We found purely random testing to be highly inefficient at the daily testing rates
considered, as discussed in Appendix S3.) For an individual to be eligible for targeted
testing, they would have to not be currently awaiting a result of a test nor be currently
confined because of a positive result less than 14 days ago. Note that hospitalized
individuals are not tested, since they are already confined and isolated in hospitals.
Among those that are being tested in this fashion, symptomatic individuals who
receive a negative result in an RAT test over 7 days ago are given first preference (we
have also run simulations without such prioritization, and found that it made little
difference at the testing rates we examined). Once all eligible symptomatic individuals
are tested on any given day, any remaining tests are distributed randomly among the
eligible individuals in the remaining population. To be eligible for random testing an
individual must (i) not currently be hospitalized, (ii) not be awaiting a result of a test
and (iii) not currently be confined because of a positive result less than 14 days ago.

We examine mixtures of tests, i.e. combinations of overall fractions of RAT and PCR
tests. Test sensitivities are varied as follows: The PCR test is assumed to have 100%
sensitivity and specificity, while the RAT test sensitivity is varied from 50% to 95% in
steps of 5%. The RAT specificity is fixed at 98%.
We can also account for test delays, quantifying this in terms of the number of days
that intervene till the result is declared. We compare between mixtures that have no test
delay (results declared immediately) and mixtures that have a PCR test delay of 5 days
i.e. results for PCR tests are declared 5 days after the sample is taken. We will assume
RAT tests to be point-of-care and hence that their results are obtained immediately.

Isolation and quarantine strategies

211

The consequences of testing can be examined using the different isolation and
quarantining strategies listed below:

212
213

(a) Isolate when result declared: Individuals who tested positive are isolated at
their homes for 14 days and not allowed to leave this location. They are assumed
to be 10-fold less infectious, and therefore 10-fold less likely to infect their family
members. No additional constraints are placed on the family.
(b) Home quarantine when result declared: Individuals who test positive are
isolated at their homes. All family members are also quarantined for 14 days from
the day the result is declared.
(c) Home quarantine when sampled: In this case both the individual and the
home are quarantined when the test sample is taken, until the result is declared.
If the result is positive, the quarantine is extended for a further 14 days.
We have also considered the Isolate when sampled case in which individuals who
are tested are immediately isolated (as above) until the result is declared, but family
members from the same home are not confined. If the result is positive, these
individuals are isolated for a further 14 days. While omitted here for the sake of
compactness, we provide related results and discussion in the Appendix S4.

Individual agents are assigned a number of attributes, including their infection state,
home and work locations, current location, status of confinement, last test result, date
last tested, date last isolated, and so on. Each location has a similar set of attributes,
such as the number of individuals in every state in that location, the quarantine status
of the location, and the date it was last quarantined. We use a standard Monte Carlo
algorithm where each individual transits between compartments (infection states) with
an exponentially distributed time spent in each compartment. A suitably small
time-step is chosen (in our case, dt = 0.01 days), and individuals transit out of the
compartment i they are currently in with a probability of λi dt. A second random
number is chosen in the case of branching to decide into which compartment the
individual transits. As a check on our results, we also experimented with Gillespie
methods, including the tau-leap algorithm, but decided finally that the requirements of
large population sizes, extensive averaging and the complexity of the dynamics favoured
simpler Monte Carlo methods. However, we verified that results obtained with these
alternative methods were both qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with our
Monte Carlo results.
Our networks consist typically of 10,000 individuals and 2750 locations, although a
number of our simulations were carried out for 100,000 individuals and 27,500 locations
to check for finite-size effects. (We found that these simulations produced similar
qualitative trends, and even quantitatively similar proportions of total infected
individuals; see Appendix S2). In all simulations, we chose the ratio of home to work
locations to be 10:1, resulting in the number of individuals per home distributed as a
Poisson distribution with mean 4, and the number per work location distributed as a
Poisson with mean 40.
We move individuals between home and work locations synchronously at 12 hour
intervals. (Note that the rates specified in Table 1 are for a day i.e, 24 hours. Our
update probabilities are scaled accordingly.) Once a target fraction of recovered has
been crossed, at the end of every day the population is tested with a fixed number of

Effects of starting testing later in the pandemic

261

We study the effect of testing strategies that are implemented once a certain fraction of
the population has already recovered from the disease, as shown in Fig. 4 and 5. As
expected, starting testing early on in the pandemic has a greater effect in reducing the
infection curves, bringing down the overall peak of incidence and shifting it earlier, as
explained in the caption. The general trend is globally the same for RAT and PCR
tests, with low sensitivity RAT tests being less efficient in shifting the peaks.

(b) Comparing role of daily testing rates

Fig 4. Comparing the effects of testing using two different interventions.
(a) The daily testing rate is fixed at 0.5% of the population per day, but testing is
started at different points during the infection, depending on the number of recovered
individuals present in the population. The greatest advantage is obtained when testing
is started earlier. (b) Testing is started when 20% of the population has recovered from
the disease, and the effects of different testing rates are compared. Higher testing rates
reduce the value of the peak and push it earlier in the infection. The grey curves in
both cases represent the case of no testing. All tests are PCR (sensitivity and specificity
of 100%) with results declared immediately (zero delay), and individuals (but not family
members) are isolated when a test is declared positive. The curves are obtained after
averaging over 100 simulation runs.

Effects of RAT test sensitivity and different test mixtures

268

The effects of varying both the RAT test sensitivity as well as the ratio of RAT to PCR
in the test mixtures are shown in Fig. 6, when the test result is declared immediately
(no test delay). Higher testing rates lead to a greater suppression in the total infected
fraction.
However, as can be seen in Fig. 7, the benefit does not scale linearly with an increase
in testing rates – increasing testing rates has a greater overall effect at lower testing
rates than at higher testing rates. The mixture of tests matters less as we start testing
later in the pandemic. However, for any fixed value of daily testing, the test ratios do
matter. We find that RAT:PCR ratios even as skewed as 80:20 give reasonable results
for mixtures of tests in which the RAT tests have the lowest sensitivity in the range we
consider.

tests, however as the RAT sensitivity is increased, this benefit is soon lost. The tests
were assumed to have no delay between sampling and declaring of results; individuals
who tested positive were confined to their homes and assumed to be ten-fold less
infectious. However, homes were not quarantined, and other family members were
allowed to move to work.

Effects of different testing models and quarantine strategies

280

In this subsection, we compare different testing strategies across different daily testing
rates and test delays, starting once 20% of the population has recovered. We conclude
the following: If there is no delay in receiving test results, the largest reduction in the
total number of infected people (equivalent to the final number of recovered) is obtained
by increasing the daily testing rate. However, small but significant improvements can
also be made by changing the quarantining strategy to not just isolate the individual
who tested positive, but also to quarantine their home and family members for 14 days

(see Fig. 8).
The benefit of greater daily testing is, however, offset when we include a test delay
for the PCR tests (in this case, 5 days) between the test sample being taken and the
result being declared. While larger daily testing rates still lead to an overall reduction
in the total fraction of infected, the effect is much smaller than in the case of no delay.
In this case too, quarantining the entire house generates an improvement, however the
improvement is quite significant, given the low benefits of ramping up testing (see
Fig. 8).

Fig 8. Effects of quarantining homes. Testing is started when 20% of the
population has recovered. (a) Quarantining the home locations of the individuals in
addition to isolating them at home is seen to have a small but not-insignificant benefit
when there is no test delay. (b) If the PCR test has a 5 day delay and the RAT test is
assumed to be a point-of-care test with immediate results, the benefit of increased
testing is greatly diminished. In this case the improvement that comes from
quarantining of homes is much more significant at higher testing rates.
In the case of larger test delays, we considered a further quarantine protocol, in
which we isolate the individual and quarantine the household from at the moment the
test sample is taken, without waiting for the result to be announced. If the result is
negative, both the individual and their homes are released. However, if the result is
positive, both the individual and their homes are isolated and quarantined for a further
14 days. In this case, we make the following two interesting observations (see Fig. 9):
(a) Quarantining houses when the sample is taken is a better option than simply
ramping up testing, leading to lower total fraction infected.
(b) The benefit of using different test mixtures is nearly lost with delays: all test
mixtures give rise to roughly the same total infected fraction.
The downside of this strategy of course is the larger number of individuals and
homes that need to be isolated and quarantined (see Appendix S5), which can result in
severe consequences for certain sections of the population, as was evident during India’s
stringent lockdown.
Fig. 10 shows the effect of these different testing and quarantining strategies on both
the total fraction infected as well as the peak infected fraction. While the former is a
measure of the overall spread of the infection, the latter is important to understand
whether health care systems have the capacity to handle the infections through the
course of pandemic spread. Each point represents the result of a single simulation. The
ellipses are centered around the average (highlighted darker point) and their radii
represent 3 standard deviations of the distribution across simulations.

Fig 9. Effects of quarantining when the sample is taken. Including a test delay
of 5 days for PCR tests while keeping RAT as point-of-care tests diminishes the benefit
of having more PCR tests in the mixture, even when their homes are quarantined, as
shown in Fig. 9b. However, a new quarantining strategy where all tested individuals and
homes are quarantined upon taking the test sample until the result is declared can be
used to make up for this. The difference between the two strategies is most prominent
when only PCR tests are used, and its effect is more significant at higher testing rates.
We find that increasing daily testing rate and/or isolating individuals who have
tested positive or quarantining their homes has more of an effect on the total infected
fraction than on the peak infected fraction, irrespective of whether there is a delay in
declaring the results of tests. This is because we start testing when 20% of the
population has recovered. If we start testing earlier, then we find significant reductions
in the peak infected fraction also (see Fig 5).

Cost benefit analysis of different test mixtures

We now assume that we would like to achieve a some target fraction of recovered
individuals (equivalent to the total number of infected individuals) at the end of the
pandemic, and then ask which strategy might provide the most cost-effective method to
achieve this. In Fig. 11, the dependence of the daily testing rate required to attain a
total infected fraction of 50%, on the RAT sensitivity and specificity is shown: pure
RAT mixtures containing tests with low sensitivity (∼50%) require nearly twice the
daily testing rate of pure PCR mixtures to attain the same target.
Once the daily testing rate needed to attain a certain target is known, the cost of
attaining that target, given a test mixture with an RAT of a particular sensitivity, can
be calculated, as shown in Fig. 12. For a given fraction f of RAT tests in a mixture, the
cost is calculated by


Daily cost = RATcost f + PCRcost (1 − f ) Ntests .
In all cases, we find that the optimum, cost-wise, is always either to use only
RT-PCR tests or to use only RAT tests. PCR tests are only favoured when their

the graphs represents the result of a single simulation run for an RAT:PCR ratio of
80:20, and an RAT sensitivity of 75%. The darker coloured points represent the centre
of mass of the points, and the ellipse radii represent three standard deviations from the
mean in each direction. Ideally, we would require the peak and the total infected
fraction to both be as low as possible, and therefore results closer to the bottom-left are
“better” that those closer to the top-right. The top panel represents the case for a daily
testing rate of 0.1%, while the bottom panel represents 0.5% testing daily. The panels on
the left represent tests which have no delay (the result is declared immediately), while
those on the right represent mixtures in which PCR tests have a 5 day delay and RAT
results are obtained instantaneously. The three quarantining strategies are compared we find that quarantining when the test sample is taken is the most effective strategy.
relative cost is small enough and the RAT sensitivity is also low (see Fig. 12a). If the
relative cost of PCR tests exceeds a threshold value, then irrespective of the RAT
sensitivity (within the range we considered) it is optimal to use only RAT tests to
achieve the desired target total infected fraction.
If there are additional constraints, such as other external factors that limit the
possible daily testing rate or unavailability of high sensitivity RAT tests, then the
location of the optimum strategy might change, but given the shapes of the landscapes
in Figs. 11 and 12 the optima should still either consist of only PCR or only RAT tests.

Fig 11. Daily Testing Rates required to attain a target total fraction
infected of 50% for varying RAT sensitivity and fraction. As expected, when the test
sensitivity is low and the test mixture is pure RAT, the required daily testing rate is
largest, since much more testing is needed to compensate for the poor sensitivity.
increased testing begin to diminish. This threshold depends on how early in the spread
of the disease we begin testing (see Fig. 13a). We can thus ask whether these thresholds
would change if, in addition to testing and isolation of positives, other
non-pharmaceutical interventions were introduced to reduce transmission.
We therefore explore the effect of combining testing with mask use, the latter being
modelled as an effective decrease in the infectivity parameter β. In particular, we asked
whether the combination of testing and masking is better than either separately, and
whether masking can make up for starting later in the infection.
We find that masking reduces the overall number of individuals who contract the
disease, and that the threshold daily testing rate at which diminishing returns set in is
lowered by masking (see Fig. 13b). Fig. 13b also shows that there is indeed a synergy
between masking and testing – at testing rates below the threshold, the total infected
fraction produced by testing and masking is lower than the expected fraction than if the
effects were simply additive (see Appendix S6).

In this paper, we have presented a model for COVID-19 testing in a low-resource
situation, where economic considerations as well as intrinsic limitations of different
categories of tests dictate that a mix of different types of tests be used rather than a
single type. We considered the case of a combination of a relatively inexpensive but less
sensitive point-of-care rapid antigen test (RAT) with a more sensitive but also more
expensive RT-PCR test. We showed that the use of just RAT tests could yield
epidemiological outcomes comparable to those obtained through RT-PCR-based testing,
in terms of reducing both the peak numbers of infected and the total infected by the

cost, taking into account test sensitivity and fraction of RAT and PCR tests in mixture,
as well as the daily testing rate in order to attain a target recovered fraction of 50% of
the population. The daily cost is measured in units of the cost of a single RAT. Clearly,
the highest cost occurs when the RAT sensitivity is lowest (0.5). At this point,
depending on the relative cost of PCR to RAT, it may be more advantageous to choose
a pure PCR or a pure RAT mixture. The optimal mixture may then be decided using
other parameters, for example the largest attainable daily testing rate. At higher RAT
sensitivities, typically it would be cheaper to attain the same target fraction of infected
using a pure RAT mixture, despite the higher daily testing rate that would require.

sensitivity and specificity, background levels of seroprevalence and current test pricing

from both an epidemiological as well as a economic standpoint, provided a number of
conditions were met.

(b) Test efficiency with and without masking

Fig 13. Synergy between masking and testing. Comparing the effects of two
different types of interventions, given an RAT sensitivity of 75%, and an RAT:PCR ratio
of 80:20. On the left, the total number of people recovered is plotted as function of daily
testing rate: for a later start, testing has a weaker effect, and there exists a “threshold”
(here roughly 0.5%, for the green curve) beyond which diminishing returns are gained
from increasing testing. On the right, testing with and without masking are compared,
when the interventions are both turned on when 10% of the population have recovered.
Masking is assumed to bring about a global reduction of 8% in the transmission
parameter λS . The fact that the two curves initially separate as daily testing rate is
increased, shows that the two interventions act in synergy (see also Appendix S6).
testing strategy depends on whether the number of tests administered per day are
sufficient to locate all the new cases each day. A testing rate of 0.5% will be effective in
suppressing the epidemic if the number of daily new cases is less than 0.5% of the
population (for purely PCR tests) or ≈0.6% (for pure RAT with 80% sensitivity), which
explains why we see reasonable results with RAT:PCR mixtures. Variation in the
infection model parameters which result in more asymptomatic cases would reduce the
number of cases caught and increase the required testing rate. Similarly, starting testing
at 20% recovered has less of an effect than starting at 10% recovered because both
situations occur on the upswing of the infection spread and the former has more than
twice the number of new cases appearing per day. This also explains the synergy
between non-pharmaceutical interventions, which reduce the number of new cases per
day, and the testing strategies we examined.
How closely do our assumptions resemble reality? Current ICMR-recommended
testing protocols in India list a number of different categories for which testing is
required [48]. First, for routine surveillance in containment zones and screening at
points of entry, where all symptomatic cases, including health care workers and frontline
workers, are required to be tested. In addition, all asymptomatic direct and high-risk
contacts of a laboratory-confirmed case within a few days of contact, together with all
asymptomatic high-risk individuals in containment zones, are to be prioritized for
testing. The order of priority is, in sequence, an RAT and an RT-PCR test (or TrueNat
or CBNAAT in place of the RT-PCR test). Second, routine surveillance in
non-containment areas involves the testing of all symptomatic cases with a history of
international travel in the last 14 days, testing of symptomatic contacts of a
laboratory-confirmed case as well as of symptomatic health care workers and frontline
workers who are involved in containment and mitigation activities. The RAT is
recommended here as the first choice of test. It is only in hospital settings, for patients
with SARI (Severe Acute Respiratory Infection), symptomatic patients presenting in a
healthcare setting, asymptomatic high-risk patients who are hospitalized or seeking

immediate hospitalization such as immuno-compromised individuals and a number of
related categories, that individuals are to be tested first by RT-PCR and then by RAT.
These protocols prioritize the testing of symptomatic individuals, as we have
assumed here, and largely, also as assumed here, use the RAT test as a first test of
choice [48]. These are consistent with the modeling choices we make in this paper. We
also note that our focus is on the epidemiological consequences of testing strategies.
Thus, in our model we do not explicitly consider testing of individuals who are already
hospitalized, and the testing rates we report should be interpreted accordingly.
We used a multiplier to quantify the relative costs of the RAT and the RT-PCR
tests. The costs discussed below are explicitly for tests at private facilities. (Testing is
offered free of charge at government testing facilities, so the associated costs fall on the
state. We will assume that these costs parallel those outside the government system.)
Current costs of RT-PCR testing in the state of UP are between INR 700 ($9.5) and
INR 900 ($12.28), down from INR 4,500 ($61.38) in private laboratories at the
beginning of the pandemic [49]. The state of Bihar has capped its RT-PCR rates at
INR 800 ($10.91), while RAT tests cost INR 400 ($5.46) [50]. The state of Orissa, as of
Dec 3, offers RATs at INR 100 ($1.36 while RT-PCR test costs are capped at INR 400
($5.46) [51]. (The Supreme Court of India is currently hearing a plea that asks to have
the cost of RT-PCR tests capped at INR 400 ($5.46) across India.)
These rates are somewhat above the threshold where an all-PCR regime is equivalent
to or only slightly more expensive than a mixed regime. As we point out here, the most
important determinant of controlling a pandemic at intermediate levels of
seroprevalance is simply the amount of testing that is possible. It is here that we expect
that all-RAT regimes may make more economic sense, while returning results equivalent
to all-RT-PCR-test regimes. We have pointed out the importance of reducing delays
between tests and their results being available. Such delays decimate any advantage
that RT-PCR tests enjoy vis a vis. RATs.
Our results are consistent with recent work which found that the frequency of
testing was the main determinant of epidemic control at the level of populations, with
only marginal improvement being afforded by the use of a more sensitive test [52, 53].
Our aim in this paper was more specific, though, in that it examined a scenario for
testing that is the one used across India and has been the topic of much discussion in
recent weeks. Our focus is on mitigation rather than elimination strategies, aiming at
reducing the total numbers of infected to the vicinity of a pre-decided target while
quantifying the trade-offs required to do so. This may be a more realistic approach in
resource-constrained situations at intermediate stages of the pandemic.
We point out several caveats: Network models provide an individual-based
representation of disease dynamics, adding a layer of stochasticity to purely
deterministic epidemiological models such as the SEIR model. However, this
stochasticity enters in multiple ways, ranging from the choice of network to the
probability distributions governing the times spent in each state (compartment). We
made relatively simple choices for these, in the absence of more specific information
about interaction networks relevant to COVID-19 spread in a evolving pandemic within
a low-income setting. We also experimented with different networks, with varied degrees
of super-spreading, to ensure that our results remained qualitatively robust. For
simplicity, we chose simple exponential distributions of residence times in each
compartment; these could be generalized to the biologically more relevant log-normal
distributions in a straightforward manner.
Our calculation of the costs of different testing regimes were based simply on the
relative costs of administering an RAT vs a PCR test. We assumed that this differential
remained fixed, irrespective of the quantum of testing and did not change with time.
However, technological improvements, competition and state intervention have helped

to narrow the price gap between RAT and RT-PCR tests considerably in the past few
months. It remains to be seen whether this gap will shrink further.
Finally, our calculations address the contentious issue of whether a testing policy
that is based on having a larger fraction of rapid, less sensitive tests can at all be
justified. We show that it can, demonstrating this result within a individual-based
network model that can be expected to provide qualitative insight. Our work supports
the idea that population-level coverage is more important than test sensitivity, also
pointing to a non-linear synergy between non-pharmaceutical interventions such as
mandatory mask wearing, with testing accompanied by isolation and quarantine [54].
While the pandemic in India appears currently to be in its downswing, and vaccines
may be available for restricted distribution across the first quarter of 2021, reasonable
estimates would suggest that a possible threshold for herd immunity from infection
threshold remains distant. It is in this context that such questions of optimal testing
remain central to India’s response to the pandemic. They are also central to similar
questions in LIC settings.

Appendix S1 Calculation of Reproduction Number: Next Generation
Matrix Method.
Appendix S2 Scaling up our simulation. The results of the main text are
obtained for a population size of 10,000 individuals, with 2,750 locations (2,500 home
locations and 250 work locations). This corresponds to a Poisson distributed population
in the home and work locations with a mean of 4 and 40 individuals respectively. We
also started with an initial infection seed of 10 asymptomatic individuals (0.1% of the
population). However, we also tried a number of runs that were scaled-up to larger
population sizes (while keeping the initial infection fraction the same, and preserving
household and work location sizes) in order to check for finite-size effects. The results of
these simulations are shown in the figure, and they are found to agree remarkably well
with our results for 10,000 individuals, indicating that this problem scales well with the
total population.
Appendix S3 Effects of random testing. For random testing, available tests are
distributed among eligible individuals in the population completely randomly, with no
preference given to symptomatic individuals. The figure shows the effects of purely
random testing, demonstrating the importance of first targeting symptomatics to reduce
the total number of infections over the course of the pandemic.
Appendix S4 Effects of test delays on quarantining strategies. As shown in
the main text, the benefit of the PCR tests’ sensitivity is offset by the introduction of
the delay. However, this can be countered by quarantining individuals or homes when
the samples are taken. When large fractions of RAT tests are used (RAT:PCR ∼ 80:20)
equivalent or marginally better results can be obtained by quarantining the homes of
the tested individual when they are declared positive, instead of isolating them when
they are sampled.
Appendix S5 Cost of imposing interventions when test sample is taken,
rather than when test results are declared. Strategies that involve interventions
being enforced when the individual is sampled are found to require a larger number of
people and homes confined. We consider the case when only PCR tests are used with a

delay of 5 days between sampling and the results being declared, since this leads to the
largest number of people and homes quarantined. In the case of interventions that are
enforced when the individual is sampled for a test, the number of people or homes
confined does not die out even after the pandemic has passed, since people continue to
be tested and remain confined for a duration of 5 days until the PCR result is declared.
The peak number of people confined varies from 4% to 6%, and this translates into a
fraction of homes quarantined between 15% and 25%.

Appendix S6 Synergy between testing and masking is more efficient than
purely additive or multiplicative effects. As shown in the main text, there exists
a synergy between testing and masking, in excess of a simply additive or even
multiplicative effect (see below). In the figure, we compare the effect that masking
would have had if the effect had been purely additive or multiplicative. For a given
daily testing rate of r, let f (r) describe the effect of testing (without masking), and g(r)
describe the effect of testing and masking combined. We define ∆N = f (0) − g(0) to be
the effect of purely masking the population. Then, by an additive effect we mean that:
hadd (r) = f (r) − ∆N,
and by a multiplicative effect we mean that
