Abstract
We investigated the ability of Luminore CopperTouchTM copper and copper-nickel

26

surfaces to inactivate filoviruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-

27

CoV-2). For this purpose, we compared viral titers in Vero cells from viral droplets exposed to

28

copper surfaces for 30 min. The copper and copper–nickel surfaces inactivated 99.9% of the viral

29

titer of both Ebola and Marburg viruses. The copper surfaces also inactivated 99% of

30

SARS-CoV-2 titers in 2 hours to close to the limit of detection. These data add Ebolavirus,

31

Marburgvirus, and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) to the list of pathogens that can be inactivated by

32

exposure to copper ions, validating Luminore CopperTouchTM technology (currently the only

33

Environmental Protection Agency-registered cold spray antimicrobial surface technology) as an

34

efficacious, cost-friendly tool to improve infection control in hospitals, long-term care facilities,

35

schools, hotels, buses, trains, airports, and other highly trafficked areas.

Introduction
Emerging viruses continue to pose a major threat to public health worldwide, as

49

demonstrated by two ongoing outbreaks. Recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome

50

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged from a seafood market in Wuhan, China, and quickly

51

spread around the world. This virus is responsible for millions of infections and over 345,523

52

deaths worldwide and 97,948 in the USA as of May 2020. Viruses from the Filoviridae family

53

have caused several outbreaks and epidemics in the past. Ebolavirus caused an outbreak of Ebola

54

virus disease (EVD) in the West African nations of Liberia, Sierra-Leone, Guinea, Nigeria,

55

Senegal, and Mali in 2014–2015, with a current outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the

56

Congo (1, 2). In total, as of May 2020 at least 32,000 people have been infected and

57

approximately 13,600 people have lost their lives due to these outbreaks. Ebolavirus and

58

Marburgvirus, which cause hemorrhagic fevers, present a substantial global threat to public

59

health. Reports from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and

60

Prevention (CDC) showed shocking fatality rates from Ebola (~70%) and Marburg hemorrhagic

61

fever (~75%) among reported cases during 2015. As of April 2020, a total of 3462 EVD cases,

62

including 3316 confirmed and 145 probable cases, have been reported, with a total of 2279

63

reported deaths (overall case fatality ratio of 66%). Both Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus originated

64

in Africa, which has experienced the bulk of outbreaks and resultant deaths, but healthcare

65

facilities in Europe and the United States have also reported infected patients.

66

Many infectious microorganisms can survive for days or weeks after landing on a

67

surface, presenting a tremendous challenge for infection control. In one study, Zaire Ebolavirus

68

and Lake Victoria Marburgvirus were shown to survive in liquid media at titers above detectable

69

limits for up to 46 days, although the number of viable particles decreased over that time (3).

70

When dried on solid surfaces, such as rubber, glass, or plastic, Ebolavirus survives at detectable

71

levels for 5.9 (4) to 14 days (3). SARS-CoV-2 can survive on plastic or stainless steel surfaces

72

for up to 72 h and on copper for 4 h (5). To control the spread of these infections, many

73

guidelines and regulations have been established in hospitals, healthcare and other facilities.

74

Healthcare authorities have instituted routine questioning of patients and visitors regarding their

75

previous geographical location as they enter healthcare facilities

76

(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/us-healthcare-facilities.html). Barrier nursing,

77

characterized by isolating patients, wearing protective clothing, and disinfecting surfaces, is key

78

to preventing the spread of both filoviruses and coronaviruses

79

(https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/index.html, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-

80

ncov/hcp/infection-control-recommendations.html). To clean healthcare facilities, the CDC

81

requires hospital disinfectants to be effective against certain viruses with genetic structures

82

similar to that of Ebola and coronaviruses. The United States Environmental Protection Agency

83

(EPA) has also created a list of recommended disinfectants that are efficacious against SARS-

84

CoV-2 (https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2-

85

covid-19).

86

Commensurate with the evaluation of these preventive efforts, attention has turned to the

87

feasibility of self-sanitizing surfaces. Copper exhibits a self-sanitizing characteristic, but its

88

weight and bulk have limited its use. To circumvent these challenges, antimicrobial copper

89

coatings have been developed. Luminore CopperTouch™ is an EPA-registered antimicrobial

90

copper surface. Copper and copper–nickel formulations are currently registered and available for

91

application in hospitals, doctor’s offices, airports, buses, trains, and other heavily trafficked

92

areas. These antimicrobial coatings greatly expand the possibility of using copper within the

93

transportation and healthcare settings, particularly for high-touch surfaces, to reduce the spread

94

of infection. Employing these coatings to prevent infection is preferable to attempts at treatment

95

or curing the disease after infection occurs.
Several studies have demonstrated the effect of copper in reducing the bacterial burden in

96
97

hospitals and healthcare facilities. Salgado et al. reported a significant reduction in hospital-

98

acquired infections and/or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or vancomycin-resistant

99

Enterococcus colonization for patients that received treatment in intensive care unit (ICU) rooms

100

with copper alloy surfaces compared with standard ICU rooms (6). Viruses are susceptible to

101

copper surfaces as well, including influenza A virus (7) and norovirus (8, 9), both of which are

102

inactivated by copper. Solid copper surfaces have also been shown to inactivate SARS-CoV-2

103

(5).

104

Because Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus are considered biosafety level (BSL)-4 agents and

105

SARS-CoV-2 is considered a biosafety level (BSL)-3 agent, the capacity to study these viruses is

106

limited to specially equipped, government-registered laboratories. We investigated the effect of

107

copper and copper–nickel surfaces on the viability of Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus. We found

108

that these surfaces begin to inactivate the viruses within 15 min, reducing the viral load to 1%‒

109

3% of the initial titer within 30 min. These findings add Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus to the

110

growing list of infectious microorganisms that are inactivated upon copper exposure. We also

111

investigated the effect of Luminore CopperTouch™ copper-coated surfaces on SARS-CoV-2

112

and observed a significant drop (99%) in viral titer after 2 hours. These findings lend strong

113

support to the use of Luminore CopperTouch™ and other copper surfaces in hospitals, buses,

114

trains, and public areas to reduce the spread of viral infections, with substantial implications for

115

public health.

Results
Copper-coated surfaces inhibit the growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria,

119

as well as influenza virus, norovirus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). To determine

120

whether copper and copper–nickel surfaces can effectively reduce the viral load of Ebolavirus

121

and Marburgvirus after exposure, 10-μl droplets of viral suspension were exposed to Luminore

122

CopperTouch™ surfaces for 30 min at room temperature. Marburgvirus was also tested in 10 1-

123

μl droplets. We measured the viral load using a standard plaque assay in Vero E6 cells. We

124

observed a 99.9% reduction in viral titer on copper surfaces for MARV and EBOV relative to the

125

sham surfaces after 30 min (Fig. 1), approaching the limits of assay detection. These data suggest

126

that the CopperTouch surfaces can effectively inactivate EBOV and MARV particles.

127

To determine how rapidly copper surfaces can inactivate viral particles, we measured

128

EBOV viral titers using plaque assays on Vero cells after viral suspensions had been exposed to

129

surfaces for 1, 15, or 30 min (Fig. 2). At 1 and 15 min, the viral titers decreased by

130

approximately 0.5 log-fold relative to the sham surface. After 30 min, the copper surface had

131

reduced the viral load approximately1.5 log-fold, corresponding to a 97% reduction in viral

132

titers. The copper–nickel surface displayed a decrease of 2.3 log-fold, corresponding to a

133

reduction of more than 99% in viral titers. These data suggest that viral inactivation occurs

134

within 15–30 min and that the viral load is reduced by nearly 99% within that time period.

135

Finally, we assessed the ability of copper surfaces to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 particles.

136

We exposed copper, metal, and plastic surfaces to SARS-CoV-2 for 2, 4, or 8 hours and

137

measured viral titers via TCID50. Regardless of the incubation time, the copper-coated surfaces

138

reduced the viral titers greater than 2-fold, approaching the limit of detection (Fig. 3). This value

139

corresponds to a reduction of more than 99% in viral titers.

140
141

Discussion

142

In this study, SARS-CoV-2 titers were reduced by more than 99% after 2 hours. Both

143

MARV and EBOV viral titers were reduced by more than 99% on copper surfaces within 30

144

min. Previous research has demonstrated that EBOV can persist on dry surfaces for 1‒2 weeks

145

(3, 4). By reducing the persistence rate, Luminore CopperTouch™ copper surfaces can shorten

146

the viral particle survival time by up to 336-fold compared to plastic or metal surfaces. Copper-

147

coated surfaces can also significantly reduce SARS-CoV-2 survival in comparison to plastic or

148

metal surfaces. These findings have far-reaching implications for patient welfare and healthcare

149

costs. Of immediate interest is the use of these coatings in healthcare, public transportation, and

150

other settings to prevent the spread of viruses. By mitigating the presence, growth, and spread of

151

such pathogens on frequently touched surfaces, copper coatings can play an important role in

152

infection control and disease prevention.

153

Research on the antiviral and antibacterial properties of copper alloys and other metals

154

(e.g., silver, iron) has increased tremendously over the past five years. Researchers have turned

155

to self-sanitizing surfaces as a supplementary infection control strategy, given the challenges of

156

vaccine and antibiotic development. In addition to copper, surfaces containing silver and zinc

157

also exhibit antimicrobial properties. Sehmi et al. developed a method for encapsulating silicone

158

and polyurethane with copper, which both exhibited potent bacterial activity (10). By comparing

159

thick (100-μm) and thin (25-μm) rolled copper plates, researchers have noted that thin-rolled

160

sheets are rougher in texture than thick-rolled sheets. However, the data comparing their relative

7

161

effectiveness are contradictory. While Zeiger et al. demonstrated that smoother copper surfaces

162

have more antibacterial activity than rough surfaces (11), Yousuf et al. showed that thin-rolled

163

sheets have more potent activity and attributed this effect to the increased surface area of the

164

rough surfaces (12). More recently, a hybrid coating containing silver, copper, and zinc cations

165

was found to significantly reduce viral titers for HIV-1, human herpesvirus 1, dengue virus type

166

2, and influenza H1N1 virus (13). With these advancing breakthroughs in the design of self-

167

sanitizing surfaces, our finding that Luminore CopperTouch™ copper surfaces inactivate viruses

168

of critical public health concern adds to the enthusiasm for copper surfaces in hospitals and

169

public spaces to aid in infection control.

170

The mechanism by which copper inactivates microorganisms is not completely

171

understood. Winstein et al. demonstrated that copper can donate and accept single electrons,

172

which produces reactive oxygen species and free radicals, causing cell death. In another study,

173

Warnes et al. reported that copper surfaces inhibit the transfer of DNA (i.e., plasmids harboring

174

antibiotic resistance mechanisms) between multidrug-resistant bacteria (14). The ability of

175

copper to inhibit bacteria involves the rapid degradation of genomic and plasmid DNA. This

176

study further showed that DNA degrades rapidly on copper surfaces (14). Thus, it is plausible to

177

hypothesize that the genomes of these viruses are disrupted by the free radicals produced upon

178

contact with copper ions.

179

In conclusion, we have shown that the copper and copper–nickel alloys produced by

180

Luminore CopperTouch™ have a potent antiviral effect against Ebolavirus, Marburgvirus, and

181

COVID-19. These data have significant implications for infection control, particularly during

182

times of regional epidemics, for hospitals and other highly trafficked areas, such as doctor’s

183

offices, prisons, airports, buses, trains, and schools. Additionally, these data could influence

strategies for epidemic relief for both ongoing and future epidemics, such as the current SARS-

Significance and Impact. In this study, data regarding the survival of Ebola, Marburg,

Materials and Methods

193

Viral strains and propagation
Filoviruses were maintained in a government-registered BSL-4 facility at the University

194
195

of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, TX, in compliance with all regulations therein. Zaire

196

ebolavirus (EBOV; Stock) and Angola Marburg virus (MARV; Stock) were utilized, and SARS-

197

CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020) was obtained from the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses

198

and Arboviruses (WRCEVA). All experiments with SARS-CoV-2 were conducted in approved

199

BSL-3 facilities at the University of Texas Medical Branch.

200

Cell culture
Vero or Vero E6 cells were cultured and maintained in Eagle’s minimum essential

201
202

medium (MEM) with Earle’s BSS (balance salt solution) and L-glutamine (EMEM) or

203

Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium. The media were supplemented with fetal bovine serum

204

(FBS; 1%–2%) and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (pen/strep) solution. This same medium

205

was used as dilution medium for plaque assays. The cells were incubated at 37±2°C with 5%

206

CO2.

Surfaces

208

LuminOre(r) is a unique patented cold spray liquid metal. It is a polymetal alloy, not a

209

paint. To the best of our knowledge, LuminOre is the only company that has ever been able to

210

blend cold alloy metals and polymers together to form this type of homogeneous metal matrix.

211

This liquid metal is then cold sprayed onto any substrate to form a solid metal surface. The

212

Luminore CopperTouch™ copper surface is 85% copper, and the copper–nickel alloy is a

213

proprietary blend containing 62.5% copper. For surfaces, 1-mm thick, 1 × 1-cm coupons were

214

employed.

215

Filovirus surface exposure

216

The viral load consisted of 105 plaque-forming units (pfu) and viral suspensions

217

maintained in growth medium solution (DMEM with 1x L-glutamine, 1x pen/strep, 1% MEM

218

vitamins, and 10% FBS). Vero E6 cells were grown to 70%‒80% confluence in 6- or 12-well

219

plates. Ten 1-μl drops (MARV) or one 10-μl drop (MARV and EBOV) of viral suspensions were

220

dispensed on either copper, copper–nickel, or sham coupons (as described above) or on uncoated

221

metallic or plastic surfaces as controls, with a subsequent 30-min incubation at room

222

temperature. The drops were then collected with 100 μl of fresh dilution medium and titrated on

223

Vero E6 cells using a standard plaque assay technique (0.5% agarose overlay) (15). Inoculated

224

Vero E6 cells were incubated at 37±2°C with 5% CO2 for 7 (MARV) or 10 days (EBOV). The

225

titrations were subsequently fixed with formalin. To enumerate the plaques, the wells were

226

stained with neutral red or crystal violet solutions using standard procedures. To minimize the

227

extent of work performed in the BSL-4 laboratory and the production of waste, experiments were

228

conducted in duplicate.

Figure 1. Ebolavirus (Zaire) and Marburg virus (Angola) are inactivated on copper and

301

copper–nickel surfaces. (A) EBOV (10-μl drop) and (B) MARV (10-μl drop or 10 × 1-μl drops)

302

viruses were exposed to the indicated surfaces for 30 min and were then used to infect Vero E6

303

cells. Standard plaque dilution assays were utilized to calculate the viral titer. The dashed

304

horizontal lines indicate the limit of detection.

305
306

Figure 2. Ebolavirus is inactivated within 30 min of exposure to copper and copper–nickel

307

surfaces. Suspensions of Zaire Ebolavirus (EBOV) were exposed to each surface for the

308

indicated amount of time, and the exposed viruses were then used to infect Vero cells. Standard

309

plaque dilution assays were utilized to calculate the viral titer. Copper (triangle), copper–nickel

310

(square), and sham (diamond) surfaces were compared for up to 30 min. Data are reported as the

311

calculated average titers for treatments performed in duplicate to minimize BSL-4-level work.

Figure 3: SARS-CoV-2 is inactivated within 2 hours of exposure to copper-coated surfaces.

314

One 10-l drop of SARS-CoV-2 was added to the indicated surfaces for the denoted amount of

315

time. The samples were collected with media and were used to immediately infect Vero cells for

316

calculating the viral titer via TCID50. The data shown represent the average titers for experiments

317

performed in triplicate. The error bars display the standard distribution, and the dotted line

318

indicates the limit of detection.
