Abstract
Objectives: To evaluate COVID-19 infection and mortality in ethnic and racial sub-groups across
all states in the United States.
Methods: Publicly available data from “The COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic” was
accessed between 09/09/2020 and 09/14/2020. For each state and the District of Columbia, %
infection, % death, % population proportion for subgroups of race (African American (AA),
Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, (AI/AN) and White), and ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino,
and non-Hispanic), were recorded. Absolute and relative excess infection (AEI and REI) and
mortality (AEM and REM) were computed as absolute and relative difference between %
infection or % mortality and % population proportion for each state. Median (IQR) REI is
provided below.
Results: The Hispanic population had a median of 158% higher COVID-19 infection relative to
their % population proportion (median REI 158%, [IQR: 100% to 200%]). This was followed by
AA, with 50% higher COVID-19 infection relative to their % population proportion (median REI,
50% [IQR 25% to 100%]). The AA population had the most disproportionate mortality with a
median of 46% higher mortality than % population proportion, (median REM 46% [IQR, 18% to
66%]). Disproportionate impact of COVID-19 was also seen in AI/AN and Asian population with

≥100% excess infections than % population proportion seen in 35 states for Hispanic, 14 states
for AA, 9 states for AIAN, and 7 states for Asian populations. There was no disproportionate
impact in the white population in any state.
Conclusions: Racial/ethnic minorities (AA, Hispanic, AIAN and Asian populations) are
disproportionately affected by COVID 19 infection and mortality across the nation. These
findings underscore the potential role of social determinants of health in explaining the disparate
impact of SARS-CoV-2 on vulnerable demographic groups, as well as the opportunity to improve
outcomes in chronically marginalized populations.

Introduction
Since January 2020, when the first Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) positive
patient was identified in the United States, there have been over 13 million reported cases and
over 260 thousand reported fatalities [1]. Although COVID-19 can affect all ages regardless of
medical comorbidities, hospitalized patients are more likely to be older and demonstrate at least 1
medical comorbidity [2]. It has also become increasingly evident that in addition to traditional
risk factors, there are widespread racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 infection and
mortality rates, with disproportionately higher impact in vulnerable racial and ethnic minority
populations [3–7]. A recent study based on US Department of Veterans Affairs data showed an
excess burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection in African American (AA) and Hispanic populations
that was not entirely explained by underlying medical conditions, residence, or site of care;
however, the study did not find disparities in excess 30-day mortality across racial and ethnic
subgroups [8]. This observation however is not aligned with a prior Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) report, which showed poor outcomes in the AA population with 1.4 times
increased risk of hospitalization, twice the risk of ICU care or ventilator support, and 1.36 times
increased risk of death compared to Whites [9]. Gross et al, found a robust association between
AA race, Latinx ethnicity, and estimated age adjusted COVID-19 mortality [3]. Overall mortality
was highest in AAs with 1 in 1020 faced death attributed to COVID-19, followed by Indigenous
Americans, Pacific Islanders and Latinos [3]. In addition, a study based on community level
disparities in urban US counties in large metropolitan areas showed excess infections and
mortality that are not explained by income, bolstering the complex causal pathways that
culminate into these striking disparities [10].
Given the demographic diversity of the US population, and the unique challenges faced
by underserved racial/ethnic minorities in each state, it is imperative to examine the extent of
disparities in COVID-19 prevalence and overall mortality by race and ethnicity on a national

scale in a state-wise manner. Further, the racial/ethnic composition of hospitalized patients might
differ considerably from that of the general population. In this context, evidence from populationbased studies is critical from a quality of care, resource distribution and utilization, and health
outcomes standpoint. Consequently, we evaluated the extent of racial and ethnic disparities in
COVID-19 infection and mortality as a function of racial/ethnic composition of the general
population across all US states and the District of Columbia.

Materials and methods
Data source
We used publicly available data from “The COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic”
between September 10, 2020 to September 14, 2020 for this study
(https://covidtracking.com/race/dashboard). The COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic’s data
and website content is published under a Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 license, (CC BY 4.0).
The COVID Tracking Project derived data regarding racial and ethnic composition of U.S. states
and the District of Columbia from United States Census Bureau’s 2018 5-Year estimates. For
each state and Washington D.C., the percentage of each racial and ethnic category in the
population (i.e. population proportion), percent of COVID-19 infections or mortality in each
racial and ethnic subgroup (# COVID-19 infections or deaths in each category/Total # COVID-19
infections or deaths) were recorded. The race was categorized into African American, (AA),
Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN), and White. Ethnicity was characterized into
Hispanic/Latino, and Non-Hispanic. We excluded states that were labeled as “other”, that
combined racial or ethnic subgroups, such as combining Asian, Pacific Islander, and Native
Hawaiian as a pan-racial group or where the numbers were reported as <1%.

Patient and public involvement
There was no direct patient or public involvement in the design and conduct of this study.

Statistical analysis
State-wise absolute excess infection (AEI) and mortality (AEM) was calculated as a
difference in percentage points between % infection or mortality in each racial and ethnic
subgroup and % population proportion of the same racial/ethnic subgroup, (as noted above, %
COVID-19 infection or mortality in each group is the number of infection or deaths in each
group/total number of COVID-19 infections or deaths). In order to account for differences in
population size for racial/ethnic subgroups, relative excess infection (REI) and mortality (REM)
rates were calculated as absolute excess infection (AEI) and mortality (AEM) normalized by
population proportion of each racial and ethnic subgroup in the population based on respective
census estimates for each state. Absolute and relative excess infection and mortality rates were
reported as median and interquartile ranges (IQR). For analytic purposes, percentage estimates
less than 1% were excluded from analyses.
Heat maps depicting AEI, AEM, REI and REM by race and ethnicity were generated for
all 50 states and Washington DC. Missing data on race or ethnicity for a given state (due to low
sample size of less than 1%, indistinct classification or lack of reporting) appeared as a missing
value on the heat map.

Results
Race/ethnicity data were available for between 0-100% of cases and of deaths in each
state. 42 states (including Washington D.C.) reported race/ethnicity data for at least 66% of their
cases. 46 states (included Washington D.C.) reported race/ethnicity data for at least 75% of their
deaths. New York did not report race/ethnicity data for cases. Hawaii and North Dakota did not
report race/ethnicity data for deaths either. Wyoming only reported non-mutually-exclusive
categories for race/ethnicity and was therefore excluded.

Racial/Ethnic Disparities in COVID-19 Infection
COVID-19 infection was disproportionately high in the Hispanic, AA, AI/AN and Asian
American populations, relative to their population proportion in many states. The Hispanic
population experienced the highest AEI and REI, followed by AAs (Figure 1A and 1B). The
Hispanic population had a median AEI of 14%, and IQR of 8% to 19%, and the AA population
had a median AEI of 5%, and IQR of 3% to 9%. Similarly, both Hispanic and AA populations
experienced higher REI. The Hispanic population had a median REI of 158%, and IQR 100% to
200%, in contrast to the AA population median REI of 50%, and IQR 25% to 100 %. The
Hispanic population experienced ≥100% REI in 35 states while the AA population experienced

≥100% REI in 14 states across the nation. In contrast, median AEI in the white population was
-18% and the IQR -23% to -13%, and median REI was -26%, and the IQR -39% to -17%
respectively. Disproportionate impact of COVID-19 was also seen in AI/AN and Asian
populations in many states (Figure 1A and 1B), with 100% or more REI in 9 states for AI/AN
populations, and in 7 states for Asian populations.

Racial/Ethnic Disparities in COVID-19 Mortality
African American populations had disproportionately highest COVID-19 mortality
(Figures 1C, Figure 1D). The African American population had an AEM median of 5% (IQR: 1%
to 11%), and REM median of 46% (IQR: 18% to 66%). Hispanic, White, AI/AN and Asian
populations showed 0 or <0 median AEM or and REM. However, some states showed disparities
in mortality even in these subgroups, such as the Hispanic population with a 17% AEM and 43%
REM in Texas, while the AI/AN subgroups had a 45% AEM and 500% REM in New Mexico.
The Asian American population had a 4% AEM and 50% REM in Nevada.

Discussion
We found widespread racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 infection and mortality.
We summarized these findings in a state-wise manner across the United States. Our findings are
consistent with previous similar reports [3–7,11].

Hispanic and AA populations have most disproportionately higher COVID-19 infection
and AA population has most disproportionately higher COVID-19 related mortality across the
nation. AI/AN and Asian American population also showed disproportionately higher infection
and mortality in some states. Although this is susceptible to underestimation given many states
with less than 1% representation for these minority subgroups were excluded from analyses. In
addition, the excess mortality estimates in our study are not age adjusted, thus they are likely an
underestimate relative to other previously published age adjusted estimates, [3].

While we do not have specific information on social determinants of health (SDOH), to
understand the exact etiologies of these disparities, we infer a significant impact of SDOH in
driving these disparities based on vast body of prior evidence indicating impact of SDOH
mediated via environment, occupation, and access to care, and higher burden of co-morbidities in
chronically marginalized populations [12–14]. The higher burden of co-morbidities are known to
adversely impact disease severity in COVID-19 [15].

Higher levels of obesity, in particular, may result in a chronic, pro-inflammatory state
that compounds the cytokine release syndrome observed in COVID-19 [16] [17]. SDOH such as
food insecurity – with underlying economic instability (low SES, unstable jobs) result in

suboptimal nutrition from inexpensive diets (e.g., high sugar, fats, or high salt) – acting as
predictors of diabetes, hypertension and obesity in racial/ethnic minorities. [18], The impact of
these factors can be further exacerbated by lack of access to quality and timely care in these
minority population subgroups [6,19,20].

Minority populations rely on government funded healthcare facilities, which often have
chronically under-resourced infrastructures, not equipped to mobilize at an operational scale
needed for a rapidly spreading and potentially lethal infection like COVID-19. This is particularly
relevant for the AI/AN population, who rely heavily on the Indian Health Service (IHS) to
provide medical care in tribal reservations, including the Navajo Nation, the largest reservation
severely impacted by COVID-19. IHS facilities are unable to respond to a crisis of this magnitude
due to limited hospital beds and ICU’s. In addition, IHS facility may be inaccessible to those in
remote areas and IHS does not cover care provided by non-IHS providers or facilities; a critical
factor that was not addressed in the funds provided by the CARES act stimulus bill [5].

Communication challenges due to limited english proficiency and lower health literacy
results in additional barriers in seeking and adhering to treatment in minority populations [21–23].
Furthermore, these groups are more likely to be “front-line workers” (e.g., grocery, public
transport, or health-care employees) with greater in person interactions and without the flexibility
of remote employment [24,25]. It is important to note that socio-economic differences are not a
singular explanation for disparities. For example, a recent study found use of public
transportation as an independent predictor of COVID-19 disparities even after adjusting for
income, poverty rates, education, occupation or access to insurance in AA and AIAN populations,
[26]. Commuting to work in public transportation and living in crowding households is not

conducive for physical distancing, which is critical for mitigating exposure to a contagious
respiratory illness such as COVID-19 [5–7].
Our study has several limitations, mostly stemming from inconsistent and incomplete
reporting of race/ethnicity data. There were inconsistencies in race/ethnic categorization across
states. The categories were not mutually exclusive, with overlap between race and ethnicity.
Many states don’t clarify the composition of the category labeled as “Others”, or may include
Asian as “pan-racial,” effectively combining Asian, Pacific Islander and Native American
subgroups. Some states reported race/ethnicity data on only a minority of cases at the time of data
query. Some groups such as AI/AN and Asian populations had low representation in many states,
(<1%) and had to be excluded from analyses. We do not have detailed clinical and sociodemographic information to precisely understand the impact of SDOH, age and other risk factors.

In conclusion, African American, Hispanic, AI/AN, and Asian American populations are
disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 both in terms of burden of infection and mortality. We
provide a state-wise summary of COVID-19 associated disparities across the United
States. Hispanics and AAs tend to experience the greatest disparities in infection while AAs tend
to have the greatest disparities in mortality nationwide. We also observed higher infection and
mortality in AI/AN and Asians in some states. We acknowledge that the assessment of disparities
in groups such as in AI/AN and Asians can be underestimated in states with <1% population
representation of these group and that lack of age adjusted mortality estimates can underestimate
mortality in groups with younger populations such as the Hispanic population.

Our findings reinforce the urgent need for targeted interventions to address COVID-19
infection and mortality disparities tailored to the needs of states based on the specific pattern of

disparity burden. This is key to ensure the minorities in specific states are adequately represented
in resource allocation, and implementation of public health and policy measures. It is also
imperative to address underlying social determinants of health including access to care, health
literacy, housing environments, nutrition, and foster continuous future access to preventive care.
