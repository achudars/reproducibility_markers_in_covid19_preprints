Abstract

28

The role of human behavior to thwart transmission of infectious diseases like COVID-19 is

29

evident. Yet, many areas of psychological and behavioral science are limited in the ability to

30

mobilize to address exponential spread or provide easily translatable findings for policymakers.

31

Here we describe how integrating methods from operant and cognitive approaches to behavioral

32

economics can provide robust policy relevant data. Adapting well validated methods from

33

behavioral economic discounting and demand frameworks, we evaluate in four crowdsourced

34

samples (total N = 1,366) behavioral mechanisms underlying engagement in preventive health

35

behaviors. We find that people are more likely to social distance when specified activities are

36

framed as high risk, that describing delay until testing (rather than delay until results) increases

37

testing likelihood, and that framing vaccine safety in a positive valence improves vaccine

38

acceptance. These findings collectively emphasize the flexibility of methods from diverse areas

39

of behavioral science for informing public health crisis management.

Integrating Operant and Cognitive Behavioral Economics to Inform Infectious Disease

43

Response: Prevention, Testing, and Vaccination in the COVID-19 Pandemic

44

The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred important conversations in nearly all sciences [1-

45

3]. While scientists scramble to find ways to address the crisis, a salient role for behavioral science

46

has emerged. Robust evidence documents how human behavior is central to disease spread

47

insofar as reduced travel and social distancing are predictive of lower infection incidence [4, 5]

48

and face mask use effectively mitigates airborne transmission [6, 7]. As of this writing, only

49

remdesivir has been approved by the FDA as an approved safe and effective pharmaceutical.

50

Importantly, remdesivir and other therapeutics are designed for the treatment of existing COVID-

51

19 symptoms rather than for prophylactic prevention, leaving nonpharmaceutical interventions as

52

critical for flattening the curve of transmission [8]. Furthermore, while effective vaccines have been

53

developed and approved under emergency use authorizations, behavioral science remains

54

necessary for ensuring necessary vaccination rates by informing the development of public health

55

programs to counteract factors like vaccine mistrust, skepticism, and apathy [9, 10].

56

Theoretical commentaries have emphasized the role of understanding human behavior to

57

thwart the transmission of infectious diseases like COVID-19 [11]. Yet, many areas of behavioral

58

science and their accompanying experimental approaches may be limited in the ability to mobilize

59

research to address exponential spread or provide easily translatable findings. For example,

60

methods commonly used in behavioral psychology and the experimental analysis of behavior are

61

limited due to a focus on steady state behavior and within-subject methods [12, 13]. Such designs

62

are hallmarks of rigorous science, to be certain, but these methodological features are sometimes

63

at odds with and constraints on the need for rapid and scalable behavioral solutions. Other

64

behavioral science methods can provide critical data for COVID-19 response, but rely on technical

65

procedures without direct or readily accessible applications that policymakers can act upon [14].

66

Here, we sought to address these shortcomings by showing how well-validated behavioral

67

economic procedures developed in operant psychology frameworks may be combined with more

68

widely recognized cognitive psychology approaches to provide robust behavioral insights, policy-

69

relevant data, and research methods that are helpful to stakeholders during the COVID-19

70

pandemic, specifically, but also for infection disease response, more broadly.

71

Behavioral economics may be defined as an approach to understanding behavior and

72

decision making that integrates behavioral science (commonly psychology) with economic

73

principles [15]. As typically described in the scientific and popular press, this approach

74

emphasizes the contributions of psychology to economics or the behavior of economics. Such a

75

behavioral economic tradition often examines how mechanisms described by cognitive

76

psychology can explain systematic deviations from neo-classical economic predictions (e.g.,

77

status quo biases; loss aversion) [16-19]. Less often considered, but equally relevant, is the

78

reciprocal integration – the contributions of economics to psychology theory or the economics of

79

behavior [20, 21]. Research in this tradition has applied economic principles to understand

80

decision making using methods developed within operant psychology frameworks (e.g.,

81

purchasing of competing goods from an economist’s perspective may be the division of operant

82

behavior among competing reinforcers from a behavioral psychologist’s perspective). This

83

approach involves evaluation of behavioral mechanisms including delay discounting (i.e., the

84

devaluation of an outcome by delay), probability discounting (i.e., the devaluation of an outcome

85

by probability/certainty), and behavioral economic demand (i.e., relationship price and

86

consumption that considers this relation may differ across individuals and contexts) to determine

87

how these measurable factors influence choice and behavioral allocation as well as individual

88

difference variables impacting these relationships.

89

The unique lens by which behavioral economics is used to describes behavior not only

90

provides novel means of interpreting socially important concerns, but also the various facets of

91

the dependent variables generated in these experiments render them especially useful for

92

informing translational public policy [20, 22-24]. For example, operant arrangements can quantify

93

the effective price at which demand for a commodity shifts from inelastic (when a one unit increase

4

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.20.21250195; this version posted February 1, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

94

in price is met with less than one unit decrease in consumption) to elastic (when a one unit

95

increase in price is met with more than one unit decrease in consumption) for the consumer, while

96

also modeling expected revenue on the part of the supplier. Moreover, comparisons of demand

97

metrics have the potential to determine how imposing different environmental contexts (e.g.,

98

availability of reinforcer substitutes, closed economics, framing effects) alters the basic reinforcing

99

value of the commodity for an individual as well as individual factors predictive of that influence.

100

Similarly, discounting procedures can identify the effective delay [25] or probability [26] at which

101

behavior is altered to a given level of performance; for example, the delay associated with, say,

102

a 50% reduction in the value of procuring a COVID-19 test. Such metrics are ripe for modeling

103

policy effects and can provide novel and important behavioral information that is directly relatable

104

to policy makers considering a behavior change program [23, 27, 28].

105

To date, researchers considering the behavior of economics and economics of behavior

106

have remained largely independent. We argue that this separation is not of theoretical necessity

107

and that there are many shared interests in cognitive-behavioral factors affecting decision making.

108

A primary goal of this paper is to provide a clear demonstration of how these approaches when

109

integrated can provide scalable behavioral solutions for public health crisis mitigation. To this end,

110

we provide examples that relate to policy designed to reduce transmission and improve treatment

111

within the COVID-19 pandemic. We translated behavioral economic discounting and demand

112

assays widely used and validated in behavioral psychology [29-34] to study 1) engagement in

113

social distancing, 2) cooperation with face mask use, 3) procurement of diagnostic testing, and 4)

114

intentions for vaccination. Within these examples, we evaluate specific experimental

115

manipulations well characterized by cognitive psychology approaches to behavioral economics

116

(e.g., framing effects) to provide clear and translatable implications for public policy design.

General Methods
Sampling and Study Overview

120

This paper summarizes a programmatic series of seven experiments conducted across

121

four samples recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic (Sample 1 N = 133; Sample 2 N = 414;

122

Sample 3 N = 497; Sample 4 N = 322). Sampling occurred asynchronously in March 2020

123

(Sample 1), May 2020 (Sample 2), July 2020 (Sample 3), and September 2020 (Sample 4). All

124

samples were recruited using crowdsourcing (Amazon Mechanical Turk) with checks used to

125

verify fidelity of responding. One experiment was formally pre-registered (Experiment 7;

126

https://osf.io/56f2z) while others followed standard analyses based on the experimental design.

127

Methods and Results will be presented thematically from prevention behavior to diagnostic testing

128

to vaccination following a general summary of the experimental methods and data cleaning

129

processes.

130

Across all studies, we required participants to be age 18 or older and have United States

131

residence. Additional attention and validity checks were included for each sample. All studies

132

were reviewed and approved by local Institutional Review Boards (University of Kansas or Johns

133

Hopkins University). Participants reviewed a study cover letter to provide electronic informed

134

consent prior to participation.

135

Sample Characteristics and Systematicity Checks

136

Sample 1 (Experiment 1 and 4)

137

Sample 1 was recruited from 13 March 2020 to 17 March 2020. Participants were required

138

to have a 95% or higher approval rate, 100 or more previously approved tasks, and current United

139

States residence to view and complete the study. Compensation for full study completion was $1

140

USD. A total of 227 participants completed the full assessment.

141

Data cleaning consisted of evaluation of behavioral economic tasks for systematic

142

responding as well as evaluation of qualitative responses for English language proficiency and

143

comprehension. Probability discounting task (Experiment 1) and behavioral economic demand

144

tasks (Experiment 4) were evaluated using standardized systematic data checks [35, 36]. A total

145

of 31 participants failed checks on the probability discounting procedure, 18 on the demand

146

procedure, and 44 on both procedures. These results closely corresponded to flagged responses

147

on the qualitative data checks with only one additional participant removed based on inattentive

148

qualitative responses. This resulted in an analyzed sample of 133 participants. The analyzed

149

sample was an average of 39.5 years old (SD = 12.1), 59.8% female, and 80.6% White.

150

Sample 2 (Experiment 5)

151

Sample 2 was recruited from 13 May 2020 to 10 June 2020. Participants were required to

152

have a 95% or higher approval rate, 100 or more previously approved tasks, and current United

153

States residence to view and complete the study. Compensation for full study completion was $1

154

USD. A total of 499 participants completed the full assessment.

155

Data cleaning included evaluation of the diagnostic test delay discounting task

156

(Experiment 5) for reversals (i.e., reversing from stating “No” they would not get a test to “Yes”

157

they would get a test). Any participant with one or more reversal on any task was removed (i.e.,

158

1 task = 7 participants; 2 tasks = 8 participants; 3 tasks = 9 participants; 4 tasks = 61 participants).

159

This resulted in an analyzed sample of 414 participants. The analyzed sample was an average of

160

32.6 years old (SD = 10.9), 58.3% female, and 71.5% White.

161

Sample 3 (Experiment 2, 3, and 6)

162

Sample 3 completed the assessment from 4 August 2020 to 12 August 2020. Participants

163

were initially recruited from mTurk in March 2020 as a part of a longitudinal cohort with repeated

164

assessments throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were required to have a 97% or

165

higher approval rate, more than 100 previously approved tasks, and current United States

166

residence to enroll in the parent study. Data collection for this project occurred in Wave 3 of data

167

collection and included 531 participants who completed the full assessment. Participants were

168

compensated $3.50 USD for completion of this assessment.

169

Data cleaning included evaluation of social distancing discounting tasks (Experiment 2)

170

and vaccine demand tasks (Experiment 6) for systematic responding. Discounting tasks were

171

evaluated using standardized criteria [35] and demand tasks were evaluated for reversals from a

172

“No” response. A total of 12 participants failed checks on the discounting procedure, 12 on the

173

demand procedure, and 6 on both procedures. An added attention check was included asking

174

about recent use of a fake drug (“oxypentone”) that an additional 6 participants endorsed. This

175

resulted in an analyzed sample of 497 participants. The analyzed sample was an average of 40.0

176

years old (SD = 11.4), 56.9% female, and 78.7% White.

177

Sample 4 (Experiment 7)

178

Sample 4 was recruited from 12 September 2020 to 23 September 2020. Participants

179

were required to have a 95% or higher approval rate, 100 or more previously approved tasks, and

180

current United States residence to view and complete the study. Compensation for full study

181

completion was $1 USD. A total of 485 participants completed the full assessment.

182

Data cleaning included evaluation of the vaccine demand tasks (Experiment 7) for

183

systematic responding. Tasks were evaluated for reversals from a “No” response, which were

184

considered non-systematic (i.e., indicating “No” for intention to get a vaccine and then reversing

185

to “Yes” at a lower efficacy). A total of 163 participants failed checks. This resulted in an analyzed

186

sample of 322 participants. The analyzed sample was an average of 38.8 years old (SD = 11.6),

Social Distancing

195

Social distancing is a first-line prevention strategy for reducing COVID-19 transmission. In

196

Experiments 1 and 2 we evaluate how the likelihood of engaging in social distancing varies as a

197

function of probabilistic community COVID-19 risk. In Experiment 1, participants completed a

198

probability discounting task evaluating the likelihood of attending a large social gathering given

199

varying probabilities of community risk for a hypothetical disease under varying symptom framing

200

conditions. In Experiment 2, participants completed a probability discounting procedure

201

evaluating the likelihood of engaging in a social activity based on community COVID-19 risk under

202

different risk framing conditions based on a widely disseminated risk assessment infographic from

203

the Texas Medical Association [37].

204

Methods

205

Experiment 1 (Sample 1)

206

Participants completed a probability discounting task to evaluate likelihood of attending a

207

large social gathering given the probability of disease risk in the community. The study vignette

208

described a situation involving planned attendance at a large social event. The task included two

209

experimental manipulations related to the symptoms’ description. First, the symptom type

210

comprised a within-subject manipulation. A “Mild” version of the task described symptoms

211

including dry cough, fatigue, fever, shortness of breath, and headache. A “Severe” version of the

212

task included these symptoms in addition to difficulty breathing (requiring a medical ventilator).

213

All participants completed these two task manipulations with a randomized order of completion.

214

Second, the symptom framing was a between-subject manipulation. Half of participants saw the

215

two task symptom variations with corresponding labels for the symptom severity (e.g., “this group

216

of symptoms is classified as [mild/severe]”) in the “Label” condition (n=69). The other half of

217

participants saw the same symptoms, but with no labels included in the “No Label” condition

218

(n=64). Participants rated their likelihood of attending the social event at varying probabilities that

219

someone in their community was presenting the symptoms described. Participants emitted

220

responses on a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 (extremely unlikely to attend) to 100 (extremely

221

likely to attend). Symptom probabilities included 0%, 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%, and

222

100%.

223

Group discounting data were analyzed and plotted using the hyperbolic discounting

224

equation that includes a non-linear scaling parameter [38]. Individual discounting data were

225

analyzed as area under the curve (AUC) to provide a model free estimation of the impact of

226

symptom probability on the discounting of event attendance [39]. Lower AUC values indicate

227

greater sensitivity to risk (the desirable outcome from a social distancing standpoint). We

228

standardized responses to the 0% likelihood value to isolate the impact of symptom probability

229

from no-risk event attendance. We used an ordinal variation of AUC, here and throughout, to

230

address concerns with normality and disproportional influence of delay or probability steps [40].

231

AUC values were analyzed using a 2 x 2 mixed ANOVA with the between-subject factor of Label

232

(No Label versus Label) and within-subject factor of Symptom Type (Mild versus Severe).

233

Generalized linear mixed effect models were used to test the likelihood of 100% likelihood of

234

attendance at 0% community transmission risk (a bimodal distribution was observed; therefore,

235

this outcome was dichotomized for analysis).

236

Experiment 2 (Sample 3)

237

Similar to Experiment 1, participants completed a probability discounting task to evaluate

238

likelihood of engaging in a social activity based on community COVID-19 risk. Participants were

239

first asked to select a preferred social activity from a low-to-moderate risk category (i.e., play golf

240

with others, go to a library or museum, or walk in a busy downtown) and from a high risk category

241

(i.e., go to a sports stadium, go to a movie theater, or attend a religious service with 500+ other

242

worshipers). These groupings were based on the risk categorizations made by the Texas Medical

243

Association in June 2020 [37]. Participants then read a vignette describing the opportunity to

244

engage in that activity. A risk framing manipulation (between-subject) varied risk categorization

245

with half of participants (N=246) completing task that included labels for the risk severity (e.g.,

246

“According to health authorities in your area, this activity is of [Low/High Risk]”) and the other half

247

of participants (N=251) receiving no risk information. The two risk categories were completed in

248

a randomized order. Participants rated their likelihood of going to the social activity at varying

249

probabilities that someone at the activity was displaying COVID-19 symptoms. Participants

250

emitted responses on a VAS from 0 (definitely would not go) to 100 (definitely would not go).

251

Symptom probabilities included 0%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 99%, and 100%.

252

Group discounting data were analyzed and individual AUC values calculated as in

253

Experiment 1. AUC values were analyzed using a 2 x 2 mixed ANOVA with the between-subject

254

factor of risk Label (No Label versus Label) and within-subject factor of Risk Level (Low-to-

255

Moderate versus High). Generalized linear mixed effect models were used to test the likelihood

256

of 100% likelihood of attendance at 0% community transmission risk.

Label group significantly lower AUC values (i.e., greater sensitivity to risk) for the High Risk activity

273

than the Low Risk activity, t495 = 2.967, p = .003, d = -0.27. A significant Risk Level by Risk Framing

274

interaction was also observed at the 0% probability of a symptomatic attendee, b = -2.59, p <

275

.001. This interaction reflected no differences by Risk Framing in the likelihood of attendance at

276

0% risk for the Low Risk Activity, OR = 0.84, p = .40, but a lower likelihood of attendance for the

277

High Risk Activity for the Label Risk Framing condition, OR = 0.48, p < .001.

278

Discussion

279

These findings collectively show that social distancing can be effectively modeled using

280

probability discounting procedures. Social activity was systematically devalued by likelihood of

281

non-specific (Experiment 1) and COVID-19 specific (Experiment 2) community disease risk.

282

Importantly, we found that a framing manipulation modeled after popular public health messaging

283

targeting social distancing increased sensitivity to risk likelihood for a high-risk activity while not

284

appreciable changing behavior for a low-risk activity. This is important given the potential for risk

285

framing to have an untoward effect of reducing risk sensitivity for low-risk settings when presented

286

in these kinds of behavioral contrasts (i.e., boomerang effects) [41].

287

Facemask Use

288

Consistent face mask use in social interactions is one of the most widely recommended

289

and effective means of reducing COVID-19 transmission [6, 7]. Despite this effectiveness, the use

290

of face masks remains controversial and underutilized [42]. Evaluating individual and contextual

291

factors that influence face mask use may help to identify areas for intervention – either at a

292

population level (stemming from between-person differences) or at a contextual level (stemming

293

from within-person differences).

294

In Experiment 3 (Sample 3) we evaluated the role of social factors in determining face

295

mask use. The notion that face mask use may relate to social context is reasonable given that

296

one of the primary benefits of mask use is prevention of transmission to others. With respect to

297

behavioral economic theory, social discounting is a well-described behavioral mechanism by

298

which the value of an outcome is devalued by the “social distance” or subjective “closeness” of a

299

person to the participant (e.g., a co-worker would be more socially distant than a sibling or parent).

300

Empirical work on social discounting finds that the value of an outcome is hyperbolically devalued

301

by social distance in a way that is mechanistically similar to delay and probability discounting [43-

302

45]. Participants in Experiment 3 completed a traditional social discounting task using monetary

303

consequences and a novel social discounting task with face mask use as the consequence.

304

Methods

305

Experiment 3 (Sample 3)

306

Participants completed social discounting tasks evaluating responding for face mask and

307

monetary outcomes [45]. Prior to completion of the social discounting tasks, participants were

308

asked to think of the 100 people closest to them with 1 being the dearest friend or relative in the

309

world and 100 being a mere acquaintance. Participants were then asked to record their relation

310

to people at numbers 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 on this list, all of which were people instructed to be

311

someone they did not live with or see in the past month. This information was included in the

312

response options to personalize responding. In the face mask version of the task, participants

313

were instructed to report their likelihood of wearing a face mask when interacting with people at

314

each of these social distances using a 100-point VAS. Three conditions were presented including

315

1) when the participant was COVID-19 asymptomatic, 2) COVID-19 symptomatic without a

316

positive test, and 3) COVID-19 symptomatic with a positive test. These conditions were presented

317

in that order as a means to model the progression that a person may experience in decision-

318

making (i.e., asymptomatic to positive). Participants also completed a social discounting task for

319

money based on prior methods [43]. In this task, participants were asked to select between

320

receiving an amount of money for themselves alone or $75 USD for the N person on the list.

321

Participants completed this task for the 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 on their social list. Participants were

322

also asked about responding for a stranger in each task.

323

Non-systematic data were removed for Experiment 3 specific to Experiment 3 rather than

324

for all experiments using Sample 3 data. This was done given the unorthodox nature of the social

325

discounting task and unusual pattern of response consistently observed (see below), meaning

326

that non-systematic responding was less likely to represent non-specific responding. Of the 497

327

participants in the Sample 3 analyzed set, 45 showed non-systematic responding on any of the

328

social discounting tasks for face masks for an Experiment 3 analyzed sample of 452 participants.

329

Group discounting data were analyzed as in Experiment 1. Generalized linear mixed effect

330

models were used to test the likelihood of using a face mask across all social distances as a

331

function of condition (asymptomatic, symptomatic no test, symptomatic test).

332

Results

333

Prior to data collection, we expected that the likelihood of using a face mask would be

334

devalued by social distance such that the greater the social distance, the lower likelihood of mask

335

use. Surprisingly, an opposite pattern of behavior was observed – participants reported greater

336

likelihood of mask use with increasing social distance in an orderly fashion (Figure 3; bottom

337

right). These data suggesting a systematic discounting pattern, but only if the discounted outcome

338

was social interaction without a face mask rather than use of a face mask. In fact, when recoding

339

responses to measure likelihood of interaction without a face mask, a systematic discounting

340

pattern was observed with the likelihood of interacting without a mask discounted hyperbolically

341

by social distance (Figure 3; bottom left). Critically, responding on the monetary social discounting

342

task followed an expected and typical pattern in which the amount of money foregone to a social

343

partner was systematically and hyperbolically discounted by increasing social distance (Figure 3

344

top panel).

345

A clear effect of symptomatic status was also observed such that face mask use was more

346

likely (i.e., likelihood of forging a mask was lower) when a participant was symptomatic whether

347

with or without a positive test (Figure 3). This pattern of response was attributable, in part, to an

348

increase in the proportion of participants reporting they would wear a mask when interacting with

any social partner in the asymptomatic condition (44.9%) to the symptomatic condition (78.8%,

350

OR = 32.1, p < .001) and positive test condition (94.0%, OR = 604.1, p < .001).

351

Discussion

352

These findings collectively show that face mask use is sensitive to social factors well

353

described by social discounting and behavioral economic procedures. Our assumption based on

354

existing social discounting research was that one would be more likely to wear a mask with those

355

who are interpersonally close given concern about infecting those they care about. However, it

356

appears that the increased value of maskless interaction with those one is interpersonally closer

357

to may overshadow any additional concern for that person’s safety. Unsettlingly, these findings

358

suggest that the value of mask-less social interaction is the more salient factor considered when

359

deciding whether to use or not use a mask based on social relations to others. Relevant to note

360

is that participants were asked to respond to these questions for people that they had not seen in

361

the past month and did not live with. Therefore, these findings cannot be accounted for by

362

responding based on people who they person has already had recent close and mask-less

363

contact with. Although additional work is needed to tease apart specific factors contributing to

364

these findings, these data are in line with other literature emphasizing the value of facial

365

expression for emotional and social interaction [46, 47]. This unexpected, but systematic finding

366

emphasizes that efforts to convey the relevance of mask use even when interacting with those

367

you know well is warranted when promoting consistent face mask use.

368

Diagnostic Testing

369

COVID-19 testing is key for identifying infection status to prevent future transmission as

370

well as to inform contact tracing. However, difficulties in obtaining testing and subsequent delays

371

related to receiving results have been a noted criticism of COVID-19 efforts. Experiments 4 and

372

5 were designed to evaluate these testing decision-making processes. Participants in Experiment

373

4 completed a task evaluating demand for a diagnostic test following possible exposure to a

374

hypothetical disease with the symptoms of cough, fever, and shortness of breath. Experiment 5

375

was designed to build on these findings with direct applications to COVID-19 by evaluating the

376

impact of cost and delay for COVID-19 diagnostic testing.

377

Methods

378

Experiment 4 (Sample 1)

379

Participants completed a hypothetical purchase task procedure to evaluate behavioral

380

economic demand for a diagnostic testing kit for a hypothetical disease. Specifically, participants

381

read a vignette indicating that they had attended a social event with over 200 people and one

382

week later developed symptoms including cough, fever, and shortness of breath. Participants

383

were also instructed that one other person in their county had developed an infection, that a

384

nearby hospital or clinic had a testing kit, but that there were no others in the area, that this kit

385

was approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and that they had their

386

typical income and savings available when making these decisions. Participants were asked to

387

report the likelihood of purchasing a testing kit given a series of out-of-pocket costs ($0 [free], $1,

388

$5, $10, $20, $30, $40, $50, $75, $100, $150, $200, $500, $1,000, $2,000, and $5,000/kit).

389

Participants emitted responses on a VAS from 0 (extremely unlikely to get tested) to 100

390

(extremely likely to get tested).

391

Individual demand data were evaluated using curve observed values including demand

392

intensity (reported likelihood of consumption at zero price), O max (individual maximum expected

393

expenditure), Pmax (price at individual maximum expected expenditure), and breakpoint (BP1; last

394

price at which any likelihood of consumption occurred). Demand intensity was analyzed as a

395

dichotomized variable of 100% likelihood of getting a testing kit at zero price versus < 100%

396

likelihood given the observation of clustering (i.e., 81.2% of participants indicating they would

397

definitely get tested if free). Omax and Pmax were also square-root transformed prior to analysis to

398

reduce variable skew. Bivariate correlations were conducted as Spearman correlations between

399

four preventive health behaviors (i.e., hand washing, face touching, social distancing, and

400

avoiding large groups; recorded on a 1 to 5 scale of never to all the time) and demand measures.

401

Group mean demand curve was also fit using the exponential demand equation [48] to evaluate

402

the analytical Pmax value reflecting the point at which a one-log unit increase in price is met by a

403

one log-unit decrease in consumption [49].

404

Experiment 5 (Sample 2)

405

Participants completed a delay discounting procedure in which decisions to obtain testing

406

were assessed across systematically varied delays (15 minutes to 28 days). We evaluated two

407

within-subject manipulations in a factorial design. First, cost was manipulated with a test as Free

408

or $125 in out-of-pocket expenses (based on the distribution of out-of-pocket costs for COVID

409

testing at the time of the study). Second, delay framing was manipulated with one set of tasks

410

evaluating delay to receiving a test kit with immediate results and the other set evaluating delay

411

to receiving results after an immediate test. Delays were held consistent across these two delay

412

types such that the only stated differences were in the framing of the delay. Participants completed

413

the testing delay condition prior to the results delay condition with price randomized within these

414

two conditions. Participants were asked if they would get a testing kit given a series of delays (15

415

min, 60 min, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 5 days, 7 days, 14 days, and 28 days). Response options for

416

Experiments 5 as well as Experiments 6, and 7 were simplified as dichotomous yes/no choices

417

rather than the VAS used in prior tasks. This design feature was selected to streamline responding

418

and better model actual decision-making in which decisions are a discrete yes or no choice.

419

Group data were modeled as in Experiment 1. Maximum delay for each condition was

420

used as a within-subject measure and calculated as the individual median value between last

421

accepted and first rejected delay. Higher maximum delay values are indicative of acceptance of

422

longer imposed delays. Maximum delay values were analyzed using a 2 x 2 repeated measures

423

ANOVA with the within-subject factors of risk Price (Free versus $125) and Delay Framing (Delay

424

to Test versus Delay to Result).

Experiment 4: Sensitivity of Diagnostic Testing to Cost

428

Demand for a diagnostic test systematically decreased with increases in cost with the

429

exponential demand model describing aggregate demand well (Figure 4; R2 = 0.99). The group

430

average demand curve indicated an analytical P max value of $207 indicating the price at which the

431

demand curve shifts from inelastic or sub-proportional sensitivity of consumption to price to elastic

432

or super-proportional sensitivity of consumption to price. Evaluation of individual demand curve

433

values indicated that greater engagement in hand washing was significantly associated with

434

greater demand when free, r = .23, p = .009, and maximum expenditure for a test, r = .21, p =

435

.015. Similarly, greater avoidance of face touching was significantly associated with greater

436

demand when free, r = .23, p = .009, and maximum expenditure for a test, r = .19, p = .027.

437

Experiment 5: Delay to Test versus Delay to Result in COVID-19 Testing

438

Assessment of aggregate discounting curves showed systematic reductions in testing

439

intentions with increases in delay for each condition (Figure 5). Tests of individual subject values

440

(crossover delay from yes to no testing intention) found significant mains effects of Price, F1,413 =

441

523.8, p < .001, and Delay Framing, F1,413 = 23.1, p < .001, and a Price x Delay Framing

442

interaction, F1,413 = 30.4, p < .001. Evaluation of this interaction indicated that longer delays were

443

tolerated when the delay was to receive a test rather than receive results when tests were free,

444

t413 = 5.64, p < .001, dz = 0.28, but that there were no significant differences by framing when tests

445

had out-of-pocket costs, t413 = 0.73, p = .47, dz = 0.04.

446

These findings are highlighted in differences for ED50 values (Figure 5 vertical lines)

447

summarizing the delay at which half the population is likely to procure a test. Specifically, when

448

participants had to pay $125 for test, ED50s of approximately 1 day (23 and 24 hours) were

449

observed in both framing conditions. In contrast, when Free, the ED50 was 4.25 days longer (102

450

hours) for the shipping delay than results delay condition with lower sensitivity to delay in the

451

shipping delay condition.

452

Discussion

453

Experiments 4 and 5 collectively show that diagnostic testing is sensitive to factors

454

including testing cost and delay. Importantly, these data emphasize how delays imposed on

455

receiving test results may exert a particularly strong impact for discouraging testing, emphasizing

456

how rapid testing may improve testing rates even if a delay is imposed on getting the test. That

457

responding was more sensitive to delayed results than delayed testing is possibly explained by a

458

dominant response (i.e., getting a test) outcome (i.e., receiving a result) contingency at play and

459

how delays for this response-outcome contingency are exaggerated under a delayed results

460

scenario.

461

Vaccination Intentions

462

Recent emergency authorization of and attempts at distribution of vaccines for COVID-19

463

have highlighted challenges related to vaccine skepticism and the role of behavior change and

464

motivation as key steps for encouraging vaccine uptake. Experiment 6 evaluated demand for both

465

a COVID-19 vaccine and an influenza vaccine based on the efficacy of those vaccines. We used

466

an experimental vignette in which the participant was at a health care provider and could “bundle”

467

an additional vaccine with the one they were already receiving. Experiment 7 evaluated a choice

468

framing condition in which COVID-19 vaccination safety was framed positively or negatively.

469

Methods

470

Experiment 6 (Sample 3)

471

Participants read vignettes describing a scenario in which approved influenza and COVID-

472

19 vaccines were available. The instructions indicated these vaccines would be the only ones

473

available, that they would be free of cost, would have to be administered now, and were approved

474

by the FDA. Scenarios were presented to model going to a healthcare provider for one vaccine

475

and having an option to bundle another vaccine at that visit. Participants responded across a

476

series of efficacies defined as percentage reduction in influenza/COVID-19 symptom risk (100%

477

to 0% effective in 10% increments). Participants were randomized to complete different choice

framing conditions (between-subject). In an opt-in condition, the response option was preselected

479

as “No” and participants were required to change the selection to “Yes” if they wanted the vaccine

480

(n = 245). In an opt-out condition, the response option was preselected at “Yes” and participants

481

were required to change the selection to “No” if they wanted the vaccine (n = 252). All participants

482

also completed a version in which no response was preselected and were randomized to

483

complete this before or after the choice framed condition.

484

Group data were modeled using demand methods as in Experiment 4. Individual values

485

for minimum required efficacy for each vaccine task were calculated as the individual median

486

value between last accepted and first rejected vaccine efficacy. Individuals who rejected the

487

vaccine at all values were assigned a value of 100 and those accepting at all values were

488

assigned a value of 0. Higher minimum required efficacy values are indicative of a need for higher

489

vaccine efficacy for vaccine intention. Minimum required efficacy were first analyzed using a 2 x

490

2 x 2 mixed ANOVA with the within-subject factors of risk Vaccine Type (COVID-19 and

491

Influenza), Response Type (Default versus No Default) and the between-subject factor of Framing

492

Condition (Opt-In versus Opt-Out). A secondary analysis was conducted with only the first framing

493

condition completed as a 2 x 3 mixed ANOVA with the within-subject factor of Vaccine Type

494

(COVID-19 versus Influenza) and Response Condition (No Default, Opt-In, and Opt-Out).

495

Experiment 7 (Sample 4)

496

Experiment 7 was conducted with a preregistration (https://osf.io/56f2z). Participants

497

completed demand tasks in which we varied development timeline (within-subject) as either a 7-

498

month (for late October 2020 delivery) or 12-month (for late March 2021 delivery) process to

499

model scenarios presented in news media at the time of data collection (September 2020).

500

Participants were randomized to a safety framing condition (between-subject) in which safety was

501

described using a positive framing (“95% of the scientific community declares the vaccine safe”;

502

n = 161) or a negative framing (“5% of the scientific community declares the vaccine unsafe”; n =

504

years to ensure balance in general vaccination behavior between the two conditions.

505

Group data were modeled using demand methods as in Experiment 4 and individual

506

required minimum efficacy calculated as in Experiment 6. Minimum required efficacy data were

507

first analyzed using a 2 x 2 mixed ANOVA with the within-subject factors of risk Development

508

Timeline (7-month versus 12-month) and the between-subject factor of Framing Condition

509

(Positive versus Negative Framing). A secondary analysis was conducted with only the first task

510

completed as the same 2 x 2 ANOVA with Development Timeline as a between-subjects factor.

511

A sensitivity analyses was also conducted including the covariates of age, gender, and

512

conservativism (Social and Economic Conservatism Scale) [50]. This analysis used a linear mixed

513

effect model including these covariates, the fixed effects of Development Timeline and Framing

514

Condition, and a random intercept term. A deviation from the preregistered analysis plan was

515

made for this sensitivity analyses because education was not collected in the survey, and

516

therefore, not available to include as a covariate.

518

Experiment 6: Opt-In and Opt-Out Procedures for COVID-19 and Influenza Vaccine Bundles

519

Aggregate demand curves showed systematic decreases in demand for a vaccine with

520

decreases in efficacy (Figure 6). The exponential demand model described aggregate demand

521

well across each demand curve and allowed for estimation of vaccine coverage at a critical

522

threshold (e.g., 70% coverage) [51]. Analysis of individual cross-over efficacies (i.e., the efficacy

523

at which a participant went from intending to not intending vaccination) revealed a significant main

524

effect of Vaccine Type, F1,495 = 39.3, p < .001, reflecting vaccine acceptance at lower efficacies

525

for a COVID-19 vaccine than an influenza vaccine. Main effects and interactions involving the

526

framing condition were not significant, p > .10.

Experiment 7: Development Timeline and Safety Framing for COVID-19 Vaccination

528

Aggregate demand curves showed systematic decreases in demand for a vaccine with

529

decreases in efficacy across each condition (Figure 7). At an individual level, significant main

530

effects of Development Timeline, F1,320 = 9.04, p = .003, and Safety Framing, F1,320 = 14.86, p <

531

.001, were observed. These effects reflected acceptance of less effective vaccines under a

532

positive framing condition, d = 0.33, and when developed for longer, dz = 0.22. Controlling for age,

533

gender, and political conservatism did not change the results of these findings. Evaluation of these

534

effects with only the first development time completed (i.e., a purely between-subject design)

536

Development Timeline effect was no longer significant, F1,318 = 2.31, p = .13. Post-hoc analysis of

537

this possible carryover effect indicated that the Development Timeline effect was statistically

significant for participants that completed the 12-month condition first, t160 = 4.77, p < .001, dz =

Discussion

541

Experiments 6 and 7 found that vaccination intentions were systematically related to

542

efficacy, both for a COVID-19 vaccine and an influenza vaccine. Experiment 6 did not reveal a

543

significant effect of choice framing, which is possibly due to the online setting and limitations of

544

modeling these kinds of opt-in/opt-out procedures. A substantive framing effect for vaccine safety,

545

however, was observed such that intentions were lower under a negative than positive framing.

546

These findings are relevant in that news sources – even when presenting the same data – may

547

focus on either positive (% of scientists approve) or negative (% of scientist disapprove) framings

548

when conveying this information to its readership or viewership [for similar issues in climate

549

change messaging see 52]. The current findings show how such framings could adversely impact

550

the likelihood of obtaining a vaccine and ways in which public health messaging should be

551

optimized to avoid such biases.

General Discussion

554

The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized how behavioral science is critical to informing

555

public health crisis management. In the current study, we sought to determine how behavioral

556

economic approaches developed from cognitive psychology and operant behavioral psychology

557

traditions can be integrated to address existing and emerging issues in public health – doing so

558

in a rapid and scalable manner. Adapting well validated methods from behavioral economic

559

discounting and demand frameworks, we evaluated behavioral mechanisms contributing to the

560

engagement in preventive health behaviors relevant to infectious disease transmission, namely

561

those associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. We also evaluated how framing manipulations

562

can alter decision-making in ways relevant to public health and policy implementation. These

563

findings collectively emphasize how merging behavioral economics methods can rapidly generate

564

empirical data to inform public health crisis management while retaining a strength informed by

565

foundational conceptual frameworks for health behavior change.

566

The present study advances behavioral science in several ways with each contribution

567

emphasizing its ability to address critical and acute public health crises that may not be amenable

568

to prototypical experimental methods. First, this study translates operant discounting and demand

569

methods to simulate decision-making in an uncommon context for which an individual has no

570

direct experience. The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health crisis, the likes of which have never

571

been experienced by anyone alive today. Although hypothetical discounting and demand tasks

572

are presumed to reflect verbal behavior shaped by histories of consequences in similar choice

573

contexts [53, 54], some decisions lack formal similarity with actual experience. Decisions

574

regarding social isolation, diagnostic testing, or vaccinations for an infectious disease pandemic

575

are relatively novel and require participants to consider generalized decision-making repertoires,

576

such as deciding to take precautions in avoiding individuals with the common cold or influenza

577

virus. A small, but growing, literature suggests that these kinds of tests of novel or as-yet-

578

unexperienced contexts can nonetheless significantly relate to real-world behavior of interest. For

579

example, in the public health domain, studies on sexual discounting relate to HIV-risk behavior

580

[55, 56] and simulated purchasing of a novel fake ID relate to experienced negative alcohol

581

outcomes in underage drinkers [57]. Moreover, there is evidence that tasks such as hypothetical

582

sexual discounting [58] or hypothetical purchase tasks for drugs [59, 60] significantly predict

583

domain-specific outcomes or behavior beyond general monetary discounting or demand for

584

common commodities. The current study adds to this literature while extending to the study of

585

infectious disease and pandemic response.

586

Second, the data provided by this approach permits safe modeling of potential public

587

health policies. Hursh [20] previously outlined proposed strategies for how behavioral economics

588

can inform health policy, suggesting the quantification of commodity valuation in behavioral

589

economic analyses lend well to informing policy-making. Specifically, experimental research

590

permits controlled and accurate measurement, which may lend new behavioral insights into

591

econometric analyses of market behavior. This information may then inform the creation of

592

experimental model projects to measure scalable policy-level interventions at the community-

593

level. Successful results thereby lead to policy formation, implementation, and evaluation; if there

594

are failures, such results form a feedback loop wherein behavioral scientists can seek to modify

595

procedures and policies to re-evaluate such effects. Related work in psychology and related fields

596

has harnessed hypothetical discounting and demand techniques to provide novel lenses by which

597

to view population-level effects for hard-to-study behavioral questions – from a direct operant

598

perspective, at least – such as tornado warnings [61], incremental cigarette taxation [27], texting-

599

while-driving interventions [62], and happy-hour pricing for alcohol [63];such findings speak

600

directly to potential population-level decisions and have an added benefit of providing accurate

601

quantitative markers for policy development and targets [20, 22, 23].

602

Finally, this study has consequences for understanding behavioral phenomena directly

603

concerning the spread of COVID-19: social distancing, face mask use, testing procurement, and

604

vaccination intentions. Across several examples, we found that framing manipulations impacted

605

the pattern of response on the discounting and demand tasks used. Precisely, framing of high

606

risk social activities increased sensitivity to risk for social distancing, framing delay as a delay to

607

result increased sensitivity to delay for test procurement, and framing vaccine safety in a negative

608

valence increased sensitivity to efficacy (thereby more steeply reducing vaccine acceptance). The

609

use of simulated discounting and demand tasks, furthermore, provided a substantive benefit over

610

traditional single discrete-choice forms of assessment (e.g., “Would you get a COVID-19 test?).

611

Such single discrete-choice methods fail to isolate and control for factors that may contribute to

612

differences observed between and within-people (e.g., differences in hypothesized delays, risk,

613

efficacy, or safety). Responding under such methods may therefore be attributable to any of these

614

uncontrolled factors with differing implications for public policy based on the specific

615

mechanism(s) impacted.

616

These contributions should be considered within the limitations of this study. For one, we

617

restricted sampling to a crowdsourced platform. An extensive body of literature suggests the

618

reliability and validity of data collected through crowdsourced platforms is favorable in

619

comparisons to other convenience methods like undergraduate student pools [64, 65].

620

Nevertheless, crowdsourcing approaches are still convenience sampling and present some bias

621

such that sampling favors towards younger participants [64]. Crowdsourcing in this context served

622

as an ideal data collection method for generating a large and geographically diverse sample in

623

the face of a rapidly changing public health context in which in-person study was challenging, if

624

not impossible, for this purpose. Some tasks were also evaluated in the same sample of

625

participants as noted for each analysis throughout. A relatively high number of participants

626

displayed non-systematic responding, which may be related to the use of a comparably low prior

627

task approval rate and/or the use of a one-step rather than two-step (i.e., screener and survey)

628

sampling approach [66-68]. Relevant to the specific contributions of these data for COVID-19 and

629

related pandemic responses, our findings are potentially limited by the use of a between-subject

630

manipulation, specific features of the vignette, and collection at a single point in time. Decisions

631

on what was a between- and within-subject manipulation came after careful consideration to

632

maximize a preference for within-subject designs while recognizing design options likely to result

633

in substantive carry-over bias. These findings are also limited to the hypothetical scenarios used

634

and it is likely that variations of these scenarios would produce further variations in behavior [69-

635

71]. Although the tasks presented were hypothetical in nature, extensive work have found

636

hypothetical versions of these tasks are a reasonable proxy for procedures using real

637

consequences [32, 72-75]. The flexibility of these procedures and ability to evaluate hypothetical

638

decision-making for which incentivized responding is either unpractical or unethical is a major

639

strength insofar as they afford the opportunity to evaluate and compare in short succession a

640

variety of potential contexts relevant to public health response.

641

The COVID-19 epidemic has challenged a spectrum of sciences to reconsider their ability

642

to quickly translate methods to understand, model, and mitigate contagion. The field of behavioral

643

and decision-making science has a rich and productive history addressing issues of societal

644

importance including disease prevention and health promotion. Behavioral economics is,

645

perhaps, a prime aspect of how behavioral science can leverage its methods toward this end,

646

given its ability to address difficult-to-measure behavior and quantify outcomes that are readily

647

translatable to public health researchers and officials. Here we show how merging conceptual

648

ideas from a cognitive and operant psychology behavioral economics using both discounting and

649

demand methods to provide novel understanding to behavioral components of a global pandemic

650

(COVID-19). Ultimately, these data provide an example of the adaptability and translational utility

651

of behavioral economics when current and future public health crises necessitate behavioral

652

insight and solutions.
