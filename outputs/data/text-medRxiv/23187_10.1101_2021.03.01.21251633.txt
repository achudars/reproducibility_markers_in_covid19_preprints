Summary

Coordinated local mucosal and systemic immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection
protect against COVID-19 pathologies or fail leading to severe clinical outcomes. To
understand this process, we performed an integrated analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific
antibodies, cytokines, viral load and 16S bacterial communities in paired nasopharyngeal
swabs and plasma samples from a cohort of clinically distinct COVID-19 patients during
acute infection. Plasma viral load was associated with systemic inflammatory cytokines that
were elevated in severe COVID-19, and also with spike-specific neutralizing antibodies. In
contrast, nasopharyngeal viral load correlated with SARS-CoV-2 humoral responses but
inversely with interferon responses, the latter associating with protective microbial
communities. Potential pathogenic microrganisms, often implicated in secondary respiratory
infections, were associated with mucosal inflammation and elevated in severe COVID-19.
Our results demonstrate distinct tissue compartmentalization of SARS-CoV-2 immune
responses and highlight a role for the nasopharyngeal microbiome in regulating local and
systemic immunity that determines COVID-19 clinical outcomes.

Introduction

While SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection is
responsible for COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), the regulatory mechanisms
underlying disease pathophysiology remain enigmatic. Clinical manifestations following
SARS-CoV-2 infection are highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic or mild symptoms to
severe pneumonia that can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Huang
et al., 2020b). It is still unclear whether disease progression is related to the viral infection
itself, to the host immune response, to host co-morbidities or to a combination of these
different factors (Williamson et al., 2020). Biomarkers to distinguish disease progression in
COVID-19 include IL-6, CRP, d dimers, and LDH, yet our understanding of their role in
disease pathophysiology remains limited (Fajgenbaum and June, 2020).

Analysis of immune responses in COVID-19 patients showed that SARS-CoV-2 suppresses
activation of the innate immune system, including dendritic cells (Zhou et al., 2020a) and
dampens antiviral type I and type III interferon responses (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020; Hadjadj
et al., 2020), leading to an excessive proinflammatory macrophage activation. Despite overall
peripheral lymphopenia, COVID-19 patients mount efficient SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T
and B cell responses (Mathew et al., 2020). In particular, COVID-19 patients show increased
numbers of plasma cells and generate specific neutralizing antibodies against the SARSCoV-2 spike protein (Long et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020). Virus-specific T cell responses
in the blood increase with disease severity suggesting that defects in adaptive immunity are
not causal during early stages (Grifoni et al., 2020).

One severe clinical manifestation in COVID-19 patients is an extensive systemic immune
reaction triggered by the excessive production of inflammatory mediators such as Monocyte
Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2), Macrophage Inflammatory Protein 1alpha
(MIP1A/CCL3), IL-6, TNF-α and IL-10 (Merad and Martin, 2020). SARS-CoV-2-associated

hyperinflammation can promote a pathological hypercoagulable state with increased
mortality for COVID-19 patients. The systemic hyperinflammation correlates with peripheral
SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads suggesting that it represents a form of ‘viral’ sepsis (Li et al., 2020).
Still, the exact mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains to be determined.

Upon initial exposure, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to infect hACE2-expressing epithelial cells in
the upper respiratory tract (Sungnak et al., 2020). At this stage, early defense mechanisms
likely limit viral replication in most individuals and prevent further disease progression. These
may include physio-chemical barriers (mucus, metabolites), as well as innate immune
defense proteins (cytokines, interferons) that are constitutively produced or induced upon
infection. Adaptive immune mechanisms, including secretory IgA, play a critical role in barrier
function at mucosal sites. In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, several studies have
documented presence of virus-specific IgG and IgA in blood, saliva and nasopharyngeal
samples of COVID-19 patients (Cervia et al., 2020; Isho et al., 2020; Sterlin et al., 2020;
Zohar et al., 2020). Still, how local and systemic immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection is
established and the factors that regulate this process are poorly understood.

Here we applied an integrated systems approach to identify the factors that regulate local
and systemic immunity to SARS-CoV-2 using a cohort of COVID-19 patients with varying
clinical severity. Our results reveal distinct responses between nasal and systemic immunity,
with a strong impact on the nasal cytokine response and microbiome in severe COVID-19
disease. These results may support new strategies for management of patients infected with
SARS-CoV-2.

Results

Systemic and mucosal antibody responses in COVID-19 patients
Little is known about how systemic and nasopharyngeal humoral immune responses are
coordinated during SARS-CoV-2 infection. To better understand the regulatory mechanisms
controlling SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses at the initial site of infection as well as
systemically, we first measured Spike-specific IgG and IgA and total Ig in paired plasma and
nasopharyngeal samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. The
COVID-19 patient cohort consisted of PCR confirmed patients at 8-12 days post-symptom
onset with distinct clinical classification (indicated here as moderate, severe and critical;
(Hadjadj et al., 2020); see STAR Methods) as well as non-COVID-19 controls. To assess
SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses, we used two complementary and sensitive
assays to measure Spike-specific IgG and IgA: an ELISA-based approach using soluble
trimeric CoV-2 spike protein and the ‘S-flow’ FACS-based approach using cell lines stably
expressing surface CoV-2 spike (see STAR Methods for more details; (Fafi-Kremer et al.,
2020; Grzelak et al., 2020). In line with previous reports (Long et al., 2020; Röltgen et al.,
2020), we detected spike-specific IgG and IgA antibodies in plasma of COVID-19 patients
(n= 49) but not in healthy controls with an increasing frequency and intensity dependent on
disease severity (Fig. 1A-C). Robust systemic IgG and IgA responses were detected by
ELISA and ‘S-flow’ approaches with excellent correlations between assays (Supplemental
Fig. 1A) confirming previous reports (Grzelak et al., 2020). We next assessed the
neutralization activity of plasma samples against SARS-CoV-2 using a pseudovirus infection
assay (see STAR Methods (Grzelak et al., 2020). Neutralization capacity was clearly induced
following SARS-CoV-2 infection and increased with clinical severity (Fig. 1D-E). Moreover,
neutralization intensity was highly correlated with frequency of Spike-specific IgG and IgA
(Fig. 1F). We did not find significant differences in plasma total IgM, IgG and IgA levels or in
IgG subclass levels between healthy individuals and COVID-19 patients (Supplemental Fig.
1B).

We applied the same antibody assays to nasopharyngeal samples (n= 42) collected at the
same time as the plasma from a majority of patients in this COVID-19 cohort. As with
plasma, we found significantly increased frequency and intensity of spike-specific IgG and
IgA responses in nasopharyngeal secretions as disease severity increased (Fig. 1G-I).
Strong correlations between different spike-specific antibody assays in nasal samples were
also observed (Supplemental Fig. 1C). Interestingly, nasopharyngeal total IgA (but not total
IgM or IgG or IgG subclass) levels were significantly elevated in critical COVID-19 patients
(Supplemental Fig. 1D). These results confirm and extend previous reports of robust local
and systemic humoral responses against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in acute COVID-19
infection (Cervia et al., 2020).

Heterogeneity of antibody responses in COVID-19 patients
As the majority of the nasopharyngeal samples had a paired plasma sample (n= 41), we next
explored the relationship between local mucosal and systemic spike-specific antibody
production in COVID-19 patients. This analysis confirmed previous reports (Cervia et al.,
2020) but also revealed several unexpected patterns of anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity.
First, the majority (88%) of COVID-19 patients seroconverted with spike-specific antibodies
in their blood, which appeared to be independent of disease severity (Fig. 2A). Both spikespecific IgG and IgA were present in the majority of these seropositive COVID-19 individuals
(Fig. 2B; Supplemental Fig. 2A). Second, overall ‘nasoconversion’ (presence of spikespecific IgG or IgA in nasopharyngeal secretions) was significantly less frequent than that
observed for seroconversion (Fig. 2A). Nevertheless, in these ‘nasoconverters’, spikespecific IgG and IgA were still largely co-detected (Fig. 2B; Supplemental Fig. 2A). Finally,
a small fraction of COVID-19 patients (12.25%; 6/49) did not show IgG or IgA seroconversion
(Fig. 2A), despite having been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (all COVID-19 patients were
confirmed PCR positive). Together, these results suggest a complex patient-specific control

of local mucosal and systemic antibody responses at this early time point (day 8-12)
following SARS-CoV-2 infection.
We next compared systemic and local mucosal spike-specific IgG and IgA responses in
individual COVID-19 patients. Surprisingly, systemic (plasma) and local (nasopharynx) spikespecific responses within individuals were not correlated (Fig. 2C). This was apparent when
comparing spike-specific IgG or IgA responses in plasma versus nasopharynx or when
cross-comparing IgG with IgA responses (Supplemental Fig. 2B-D). This result suggests
independent regulation of mucosal and systemic immune responses to SARS-CoV-2.

We next subclassified COVID-19 patients and controls for which blood and nasal samples
were both available (n = 41) based on the presence or absence of spike-specific IgG and/or
IgA in the plasma (P) or nasopharynx (N) as type ‘A’ (PN+; 29.3%), type ‘B’ (P+; 36.5%),
type ‘C’ (N+; 4.9%) or type ‘D’ (PN-; 29.3%) responders (Fig. 2D, E; Supplemental Fig. 2E).
As expected, all controls were type ‘D’ (sero-/naso-negative), but 2 moderate COVID-19
patients were sero- and naso-negative at this time point (Fig. 1A, D). Interestingly, 2 critical
patients showed an absence of spike-specific antibodies in the plasma but strong spikespecific IgG and IgA responses in the nasopharynx (Fig. 2D, E; Supplemental Fig. 2E)
identifying these patients as type ‘C’ responders. The remaining COVID-19 patients were
split between type ‘A’ and type ‘B’ responders that were not significantly enriched for any
particular disease severity (Supplemental Fig. 2E). Taken together, these results
demonstrate heterogeneous SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses within systemic and local
mucosal sites that suggest tissue-dependent regulation of this process.

Differential systemic and mucosal cytokine responses in COVID-19 patients
In order to better understand the mechanisms that could regulate mucosal and systemic
spike-specific antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2, we measured the concentrations of 46
cytokines in plasma and nasopharyngeal samples. In plasma, 13 cytokines were significantly
different (p<0.05, q<0.2, n=61 samples) between the healthy donors and COVID-19 patients

regardless of disease severity (Fig. 3A, B). This included VEGF, FGF, IL-1RA, IL-6, TNF-α,
IL-10, CCL2/MCP-1, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL3/MIP-1α, CCL19/MIP-3β, PD-L1, G-CSF and
Granzyme B. In contrast, a strikingly different cytokine profile was observed in the
nasopharynx: using the same significance cutoff (p<0.05, q<0.2, n=42 samples), a limited
and largely non-overlapping set of 7 cytokines was found to be significantly different between
the healthy donors and COVID-19 patients (Fig. 3C, D). This included IL-33, IFNα2, IFNλ3,
IFNβ and IFNγ which were decreased in the nasopharynx of COVID-19 patients while IL-10
and CCL2/MCP-1 were increased as compared to healthy controls (Fig. 3C, D). Of the two
plasma and nasopharyngeal cytokines differentially expressed between healthy and COVID19 patients (IL-10, CCL2/MCP-1), both were increased during infection in plasma and
nasopharyngeal samples (Fig. 3B, D). These results confirm and extend previous reports
identifying enhanced inflammatory and diminished interferon responses in the context of
SARS-CoV-2 infection (Bastard et al., 2020; Blanco-Melo et al., 2020; Hadjadj et al., 2020)
but show that nasopharyngeal cytokine responses are regulated in a distinct fashion.

Nasopharyngeal and systemic cytokine responses stratify COVID-19 disease severity
Previous studies have reported perturbed systemic cytokine production as a hallmark of
disease severity in COVID-19 patients (Lucas et al., 2020; Merad and Martin, 2020).
Extending our previous work with this cohort (Hadjadj et al., 2020), we identified 10
circulating cytokines that were significantly different (p<0.05, q<0.2, n=49 samples) between
the critical and non-critical (mild/moderate and severe) COVID-19 cases (Supplemental Fig.
3A, B). This included IL-6, IL-10, CCL20/MIP-3α, VEGF, FGF, PD-L1, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL1RA which increased with disease severity, and IFNα2 which decreased with severity
extending our previous results (Hadjadj et al., 2020).

We also studied whether nasopharyngeal cytokine profiles varied with disease severity.
Using the same significance cutoff (p<0.05, q<0.2, n=32 samples), we found that 13

nasopharyngeal cytokines were differently regulated between the critical and non-critical
COVID-19 cases (Supplemental Fig. 3C, D). Interestingly, only two cytokines (CCL2/MCP1, VEGF) overlapped with the plasma dataset (Fig. 3E), whereas other nasal cytokines
including FLT3-L, EGF, CXCL1/GROα, PDGF-AA, IL-7 and TGF-α were significantly
increased with worsening disease severity (Supplemental Fig. 3C, D). Taken together,
these results suggest that cytokine responses are compartmentalized during SARS-CoV-2
infection and are regulated, similar to spike-specific antibodies, in a tissue-dependent
fashion.

As certain cytokines are known to negatively regulate antibody responses (ie type I
interferons; Hensley et al., 2007; Moseman et al., 2016), we performed hierarchical
clustering of plasma and nasopharyngeal cytokines to identify possible associations that may
explain the distinct spike-specific humoral responses (Fig.

2D,

E). Analysis of

nasopharyngeal cytokines showed higher levels of IL-15, VEGF, PDGF-AA, TRAIL, EGF,
CXCL10, TGF-a, FLT3L, CCL2, CCL3, IL-6, G-CSF, IL-1RA and IL-7 in nasotypes ‘A’ and ‘C’
(with nasal spike-specific Ab) compared to nasotypes ‘B’ and ‘D’ (without nasal spike-specific
Ab) (Fig. 3F) suggesting that inflammation could be involved in local antibody generation.
Notably, the interferon response showed no obvious associations with the presence or
absence of viral-specific antibodies. These results provide further evidence for distinct host
immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection at local and systemic levels.

Viral load drives differential systemic and mucosal immune responses
We next asked the question of whether the virus may be directly influencing this tissue
specific immunity. We correlated spike-specific antibody and cytokine responses with viral
load as measured in nasopharynx by RT-PCR, and in plasma with a droplet digital PCR
assay as previously described (see STAR Methods, (Veyer et al., 2020). We found that viral
load was increased in both local mucosal as well as systemic compartments in COVID-19
patients and were partially correlated (Fig. 4A, B). Interestingly, while plasma viral load

increased with increasing disease severity, nasopharyngeal viral load was largely
independent of the clinical presentation (Fig. 4A) consistent with previous reports (Chen et
al., 2020; Fajnzylber et al., 2020; Zou et al., 2020). In order to gain insight into how viral load
may influence immune responses, we performed multidimensional scaling (MDS) which is a
way of visualizing the level of similarity of individual cases of a dataset (in this case viral load,
cytokines and antibody response characteristics). From the MDS projection and correlation
matrix of our plasma dataset (Fig. 4C; Supplemental Fig. 4A), we could see that viral load
was positively associated with the systemic inflammatory response (IL-6, TNFα, MIP-3β) and
several regulatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-1RA) but not with the anti-viral interferon response
(IFNα2) (Fig. 4C, D). These results are in line with several reports of SARS-CoV-2dependent induction of hyper-inflammation as well as the critical role for interferon responses
in controlling initial infection (Chen et al., 2020; Fajnzylber et al., 2020; Hadjadj et al., 2020).
Interestingly, plasma viral load was positioned distinctly from pseudo-neutralization activity
(that formed a tight cluster with systemic spike-specific IgG and IgA) (Fig. 4C). Nevertheless,
viral load was positively correlated with these virus-specific antibody responses (Fig. 4D;
Supplemental Fig. 4A) indicating a role for viral load in driving spike-specific humoral
immunity.

A similar MDS projection derived from the nasopharyngeal dataset generated a markedly
different pattern. In the nasopharynx, SARS-CoV-2 viral loads were more closely associated
with spike-specific IgG and IgA responses. However, in contrast with the plasma, viral loads
were not positively associated with any inflammatory or regulatory cytokines and showed
strong negative correlations with IL-33, IFNγ, IFNλ3, IFNβ and IFNα2 (Fig. 4E, F;
Supplemental Fig. 4B). These cytokines were decreased in COVID-19 patients (Fig. 3C, D)
suggesting that their loss could be linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, disease
severity-associated cytokines (EGF, VEGF, FLT3-L, CXCL1/GROα, PDGF-AA, TGFα)

clustered away from other variables indicating distinct regulatory mechanisms (Fig. 4E;
Supplemental Fig. 4B).

Microbiome regulation of systemic and mucosal immune responses in SARS-CoV-2
The upper respiratory tract harbors diverse microbial commensal communities that are
implicated in protection against disease-causing pathogens (Brugger et al., 2016; de
Steenhuijsen Piters et al., 2019). We hypothesized that perturbations in nasopharyngeal
microbial profiles might contribute to the diverse outcomes of immune responses and clinical
presentation during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We performed unbiased 16S bacterial rRNA
sequencing in order to better characterize the commensal communities and potential
pathobiont carriage in the nasopharynx of controls and COVID-19 patients (n = 42). V3-V4
region amplicons were sequenced allowing for identification of 464 Operational Taxonomic
Units (OTU). Genus level analysis demonstrated significant (p<0.05) perturbations
comparing healthy controls to COVID-19 patients (Fig. 5A). In addition, analysis of αdiversity (Simpson and Shannon diversity indices; combined measure of evenness and
number of bacteria) showed a decrease in 16S rRNA sequences in severe and critical
COVID-19 patients (Fig. 5B). Richness of microbiota communities (β-diversity) clearly
decreased with disease severity and analysis based on Bray-Curtis distance matrix and
subjected to principal coordinate analysis suggested that 16S rRNA profiles in critical
patients were different from other patients (Fig. 5C). A PERMANOVA test showed that
nasopharynx microbiota of critical patients is significantly different from healthy controls
(Supplemental Fig. 5A). Smoking and sex did not affect this clustering (Supplemental Fig.
5B, C). We also applied a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) using Bray-Curtis
distances and Partial least squares-discriminant analysis which also showed the critical
patients to be different from other patients (Supplemental Fig. 5D, E). While
nasopharyngeal bacterial load did not change (Supplemental Fig. 5F), specific genera
showed striking differences (p<0.05) between patients and healthy controls (Fig 5D, E)
including Corynebacterium and Dolosigranulum that are thought to provide protection against

pathogen and pathobiont invasion (‘beneficial’ commensals; (Brugger et al., 2016; de
Steenhuijsen Piters et al., 2019). These were markedly reduced in COVID-19 patients in a
severity-dependent fashion (Fig. 5D, F). In contrast, the Staphylococcus genus and several
strict anaerobes (including Peptostreptococcus and Prevotella genera) were increased in
critical COVID-19 patients (Fig. 5E, G). These results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2
infection is associated with perturbations in nasopharyngeal bacterial communities and with
accompanying dysbiosis in critical COVID-19 patients.
Finally, we integrated the 16S rRNA bacterial nasopharyngeal microbiome profiles with the
immune response (spike-specific antibodies and cytokines) and performed MDS projections
in an attempt to undercover associations that might explain mechanistic relationships at this
mucosal site. Interestingly, cytokines that decreased with SARS-CoV-2 infection (IL-33,
IFNα2 and IFNγ) were associated with the presence of Dolosigranulum genus in nasal
microbial communities (Fig. 6A, B; Supplemental Fig. 6A), whereas IFNλ3 was linked to
overall microbial diversity (Shannon, Simpson diversity indices) suggesting genus-specific as
well as community-driven regulation of mucosal cytokine production. The previously
identified association of viral load and spike-specific antibody responses remained, whereas

associations of Staphylococcus and Peptostreptococcus genera with viral load, spike-specific
responses, neutralization capacity and inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNFα, MIP-3β) (Fig.

relationship between nasal microbial communities and local, as well as systemic, cytokine
and antibody responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Discussion

Despite widespread studies, we still lack a full understanding of how local and systemic
immune responses are dysregulated following SARS-CoV-2 infection and the individual roles
that they play in determining severe clinical outcomes in a minority of COVID-19 patients. To
address this question, we compared systemic and local immune responses during active
SARS-CoV-2 infection in a well characterized COVID-19 cohort. We measured host antibody
and cytokine responses, determined viral load and characterized nasopharyngeal
microbiome using an integrative approach. Comparative analysis of the systemic and local
tissue responses suggests a model for protective immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection
and identifies potential regulatory nodes where perturbations may lead to more severe
COVID-19 clinical manifestations. First, a healthy nasopharyngeal microbiome (harboring for
example ‘beneficial’ components that confer colonization resistance) appears linked to
production of nasal cytokines including IL-33, IFNγ, IFNα/β and IFNλ3. SARS-CoV-2
infection, either directly or indirectly, appears to disrupt local microbial homeostasis, resulting
in reduced levels of these cytokines that may be important for viral control. Second, while
viral load impacts specific humoral immune responses, the local cytokine milieu is also
important as evidenced by weaker nasopharyngeal antibody responses in individuals that
have lower levels of mucosal inflammatory cytokines. Third, a relative increase in certain
bacterial genera associate with enhanced mucosal and systemic inflammation, mediated
through distinct cytokine profiles, and correlate with worsening clinical outcome. Together,
these findings raise several key questions regarding host mechanisms that can enhance
resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated clinical manifestations.

Resistance to infection by bacterial, fungal and/or viral pathogens is in part mediated through
commensal microbial communities that inhabit mucosal surfaces. Several ‘cornerstone’
members contribute to this effect that include Corynebacterium, Dolosigranulum,
Cutibacterium, Lactobacillus and other genera that generate a ‘front line’ defense against de

novo infection and suppress progression of ‘pathobionts’ that are present as carriage in
normal healthy individuals (Brugger et al., 2016; Claesen et al., 2020; Ridaura et al., 2018;
de Steenhuijsen Piters et al., 2019). The mechanisms for this microbial resistance vary and
include stimulation of mucus layers and elaboration of antimicrobial peptides (Brugger et al.,
2016; Claesen et al., 2020; Ridaura et al., 2018; de Steenhuijsen Piters et al., 2019). How
commensal communities participate in anti-viral defense are poorly defined but our results
suggest that they may be involved in maintenance of basal production of interferon type I, II
and III. Previous studies suggest that microbiota control the constitutive production of type I
and type III interferons (Antunes et al., 2019; Di Domizio et al., 2020; Grau et al., 2020; Lan
et al., 2019; Schaupp et al., 2020) and modulate the resistance to virus infections in mice
(Abt et al., 2012; Bradley et al., 2019; Stefan et al., 2020). Individual variation in microbiomedependent interferon levels may in part provide an explanation as to differential outcome
(resistance versus productive infection and potential spread) after SARS-CoV-2 encounter.

Analysis of the nasopharyngeal antibody response also revealed highly heterogenous
responses. While the vast majority of patients generated systemic viral specific antibodies, a
surprisingly high proportion of patients had neither detectable viral specific IgG or IgA in their
nasopharyngeal compartments despite the use of highly sensitive assays. The presence of
nasopharyngeal antibodies was associated with local viral load but also appeared to be
regulated by local inflammation and cytokine production. As our study relied on a single
sample (taken at day 8-12 post symptom onset), we cannot exclude later ‘nasoconversion’ in
patients lacking mucosal spike-specific antibodies. Additional studies involving replication
cohorts and longitudinal sampling may be required to determine mechanistic interactions.
Recently IgA, and in particular dimeric IgA, were shown to have the most potent neutralizing
activity against SARS-CoV-2 (Wang et al., 2020) especially in the early phase of infection
(Sterlin et al., 2020). Understanding mechanisms that allow for efficient up-regulation of local
IgA production (as in type ‘C’ individuals) and local viral control (Weitnauer et al., 2016) may
provide new avenues for protection against SARS-CoV-2. In light of these and our own

findings, nasopharyngeal immune response should be considered as potential biomarkers for
correlates of protection during SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns.

Multiple studies have recently described a parallel impaired type I interferon activity and
exacerbated inflammatory cytokine response in severe COVID-19 (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020;
Hadjadj et al., 2020). While systemic hyperinflammation is likely detrimental for an uneventful
clinical recovery, such responses may be required during initial infection as reflected by the
poor outcome of clinical studies targeting these cytokine pathways (anti-IL-6, IL-1 therapies)
during the early phase of disease (Huang et al., 2020a). Furthermore, while the importance
of type I interferons has been demonstrated through multiple lines of evidence, including both
genetic variants and presence of neutralizing antibodies in severe patients (Bastard et al.,
2020; Zhang et al., 2020), some uncertainty remains in the literature possibly due to
differences in the site of analysis, methods used, or the time point studied (Galani et al.,
2020; Lee and Shin, 2020; Lee et al., 2020; Lucas et al., 2020) as well as their lack of
efficacy in randomized placebo control trials (WHO Solidarity Trial Consortium et al., 2020).
As such, a comparative in-depth analysis of local and systemic inflammatory cytokines
appeared warranted in order to uncover potential mechanisms that might regulate disease
severity in COVID-19 patients. The main overlap between mucosal and systemic
compartments was an increase in CCL2, a critical cytokine for recruitment of monocytes to
infected and inflamed tissues. These findings support previous reports indicating a general
critical role for this cytokine in COVID-19 (Lucas et al., 2020; Sierra et al., 2020) which was
elevated in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the lungs of Covid-19 patients during
mechanical ventilation (Zhou et al., 2020b). Furthermore, a recent GWAS analysis identified
a polymorphism in the CCL2 receptor (CCR2) as associated with critical COVID-19 illness
(Pairo-Castineira et al., 2020).

However, the main striking result from our study was significant elevations in critical patients
of a cluster of plasma cytokines and growth factors that did not have an obvious role in anti-

viral immunity. Insight into their implication in severe COVID-19 came from the integration of
plasma datasets with the nasal microbiome which revealed positive associations with
opportunistic bacterial genera such as Prevotella and Streptococcus, and negative
associations with key mucosal cornerstone genera such as Corynebacterium and
Dolosigranulum. This hypothesis was supported by additional associations between
presence of nasopharyngeal Staphylococcus genus and plasma inflammatory cytokines such
as IL-6. Whether such nasal dysbiosis drives systemic inflammation will require further study,
but this hypothesis has further support from a recent study documenting a similar mechanism
in the infected intestine (Giron et al., 2020). Previous studies have document ‘pathobiont’
carriage (including Staphylococcus aureus , Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus
influenzae) in up to 40% of healthy individuals (Brugger et al., 2016). Our results suggest that
these individuals may be at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 disease as SARSCoV-2 infection would result in a breakdown of local epithelial barrier function leading to
escape of these potential pathobionts with resultant systemic manifestations. In summary our
study identifies novel host-viral-microbiome interactions during infection with SARS-CoV-2
which may help new strategies for identifying at risk individuals.

STAR Methods
Study design
This non-interventional study was conducted between March 19, 2020 and April 3, 2020 in
Cochin Hospital (Paris, France), in the setting of the local RADIPEM biological samples
collection, derived from samples collected in routine care as previously described (Hadjadj et
al., 2020). Biological collection and informed consent were approved by the Direction de la
Recherche Clinique et Innovation (DRCI) and the French Ministry of Research (N°20193677). Inclusion criteria for COVID-19 inpatients were: age between 18 and 80 years old,
diagnosis of COVID-19 according to WHO interim guidance, and positive SARS-CoV-2 RTPCR testing on a respiratory sample (nasopharyngeal swab or invasive respiratory sample).
Inpatients with pre-existing unstable chronic disorders (such as uncontrolled diabetes
mellitus, severe obesity defined as body mass index greater than 30, unstable chronic
respiratory disease or chronic heart disease) and with bacterial co-infection were excluded.
Since median duration from onset of symptoms to respiratory failure was previously shown to
be 9.5 (interquartile range, 7.0-12.5) days (Yang et al., 2020), we analyzed immune
responses between 8 to 12 days after onset of first symptoms for all patients and before the
initiation of any antiviral or anti-inflammatory treatment. Healthy controls were asymptomatic
adults, matched with cases on age (+/- 5 years), with a negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR
testing at time of inclusion. The study conforms to the principles outlined in the Declaration of
Helsinki, and received approval by the appropriate Institutional Review Board (Cochin-Port
Royal Hospital, Paris, France; number AAA-2020-08018).

Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were
extracted from electronic medical records using a standardized data collection form. Chest
radiographs or CT scan were also done for all inpatients. Laboratory confirmation of SARSCoV-2 was performed at the Cochin Hospital, Virology Department, Paris, France. RT-PCR
assays were performed in accordance with the protocol established by the WHO (World

in

humans

(https://www-who-

int.proxy.insermbiblio.inist.fr/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technicalguidance/laboratory-guidance).

The severity of COVID-19 was classified at the time of admission based on the adaptation of
the Sixth Revised Trial Version of the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and
Treatment Guidance. Mild cases were defined as mild clinical symptoms (fever, myalgia,
fatigue, diarrhea) and no sign of pneumonia on thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan.
Moderate cases were defined as clinical symptoms associated with dyspnea and radiological
findings of pneumonia on thoracic CT scan, and requiring a maximum of 3 L/min of oxygen,
stable for at least the following 24 hours. Severe cases were defined as respiratory distress
requiring more than 3 L/min of oxygen and no other organ failure, stable for at least the
following 24 hours. Critical cases were defined as respiratory failure requiring mechanical
ventilation, shock and/or other organ failure that require an intensive care unit (ICU).

Patient characteristics
Forty-nine Covid-19 patients and 12 healthy controls were included. The demographic and
clinical characteristics of the patients have been previously described (Hadjadj et al., 2020).
The median age of the patients was 55 years (interquartile range, 50 to 63) and 78% were
male, while median age of healthy controls was 51 years (interquartile range, 38 to 60) and
72% were male. Patients were sampled for plasma and nasal swabs after a median duration
of 10 days (interquartile range, 9 to 11) after disease onset. Fever was present in 98% of the
patients, and other most common symptoms were dyspnea (98%), fatigue (96%), cough
(92%), myalgia (62%) and diarrhea (34%). Among the whole population, 44% had at least
one controlled coexisting illness, mainly hypertension and type 2 diabetes.

On admission, the degree of severity of Covid-19 was categorized as moderate in 15
patients (median oxygen requirement 2 L/min), severe in 11 patients (median oxygen
requirement 5 L/min) and critical in 23 patients. Of CT scan available at the time of
admission, all were abnormal, showing ground-glass opacities (100%) with bilateral patchy
distribution (96%). Most of the patients had elevated CRP, ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) levels. Patients with severe and critical disease had more prominent laboratory
abnormalities than those with mild-to-moderate disease, and extension on chest CT scan
was correlated with disease severity. No patients with moderate disease required admission
to an ICU or the use of mechanical ventilation, while 6 out of 11 patients with severe disease
were eventually admitted to the ICU.

Nasopharynx swab processing
Nasopharynx swabs were thawed in a P3 laboratory and vortexed for 1 minute at 2500 rpm
to ensure complete sample recovery. Samples (1 mL media) were transferred in a 96-well
deep-well plate and centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C to pellet the cells and
accompanying microbes for 16S rRNA analysis. Supernatants were recovered and either
heat-inactivated for antibody analysis, or S/D treated for cytokine analysis as described
below. Total protein determinations were performed using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay
(Bradford, 1976) with serum albumin as standard.

Antibody assays
SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were quantified using assays previously described (Grzelak
et al., 2020). Briefly, a standard ELISA assay using as target antigens the extracellular
domain of the S protein in the form of a trimer (ELISA tri-S) and the S-Flow assay, which is
based on the recognition of SARS-CoV-2 S protein expressed on the surface of 293T cells
(293T-S), were used to quantify SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgA subtypes in plasma and
nasal swab supernatants. Assay characteristics including sensitivity and specificity were
previously described (Grzelak et al., 2020). Total IgA, IgM, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 were

according to the manufacturers’ instructions.

Cytokine assays
Prior to protein analysis plasma and nasal samples were treated in a P3 laboratory for viral
decontamination using a protocol previously described for SARS-CoV (Darnell and Taylor,
2006) which we validated for SARS-CoV-2. Briefly, samples were treated with TRITON X100
(TX100) 1% (v/v) and Tri-n-Butyl Phosphate (TnBP) 0.3% (v/v) for 2hrs at RT. TnBP was
removed prior to cytokine analysis by passing the treated samples though C18 columns.
IFNα2, IFNγ, IL-17A, (triplex) and IFNβ and IFNλ3 (both single plex) protein plasma and
nasal concentrations were quantified by Simoa assays developed with Quanterix Homebrew
kits as previously described (Rodero et al., 2017). IL-6, TNFα, and IL-10 were measured with
a commercial triplex assay (Quanterix). For the IFNα2 assay, the BMS216C (eBioscience)
antibody clone was used as a capture antibody after coating on paramagnetic beads
(0.3mg/mL), and the BMS216BK already biotinylated antibody clone was used as the
detector at a concentration of 0.3ug/mL. The SBG revelation enzyme concentration was
150pM. Recombinant IFNα2c (eBioscience) was used as calibrator. For the IFNγ assay, the
MD-1 antibody clone (BioLegend) was used as a capture antibody after coating on
paramagnetic beads (0.3 mg/mL), the 25718 antibody clone (R&D Systems) was biotinylated
(biotin/antibody ratio = 40/1) and used as the detector antibody at a concentration of
0.3ug/mL. The SBG revelation enzyme concentration was 150pM. Recombinant protein (PBL
Assay Science) was used to quantify IFNγ concentrations. For the IL-17A assay, the BL23
antibody clone (BioLegend) was used as a capture antibody after coating on paramagnetic
beads (0.3 mg/mL), the MT504 antibody clone (MabTech), already biotinylated, was used as
the detector antibody at a concentration of 0.3ug/mL. The SBG revelation enzyme
concentration was 150pM. For the IFNβ assay, the 710322-9 IgG1, kappa, mouse

(PBL Assay Science) was biotinylated (biotin/antibody ratio = 40/1) and used as the detector
antibody, and recombinant protein (PBL Assay Science) were used to quantify IFNβ
concentrations. For the IFNλ3 assay, the MMHL-3 IgG1 kappa mouse monoclonal antibody
(PBL Assay Science) was used as a capture antibody after coating paramagnetic beads (0.3
mg/mL), the 567107R IgG2a mouse monoclonal antibody (R&D systems) was biotinylated
(biotin/antibody ratio = 60/1) and used as the detector antibody, and recombinant protein
(PBL Assay Science) were used to quantify IFNλ3 concentrations. The limit of detection
(LOD) of these assays were 0.6 pg/mL for IFNβ, 0.6 pg/mL for IFNλ3, 2 fg/mL for IFNα, 7
fg/mL for IFNγ and 3 pg/mL for IL17A including the dilution factor. An additional 38 cytokines
and chemokines were measured in plasma and nasal supernatants with a commercial
Luminex multi-analyte assay (Biotechne, R&D systems).

Quantification of Nasopharyngeal viral load
Nasopharyngeal viral loads were determined using RdRp-IP4 quantitative RT-PCR designed
at the Institut Pasteur (National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses) to target a section
of the RdRp gene based on the first sequences of SARS-CoV-2 made available on the
Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data database on Jan 11, 2020 (Lescure et al.,
2020). Primer and probe sequences: nCoV_IP4-14059Fw GGTAACTGGTATGATTTCG;
nCoV_IP4-14146Rv

CTGGTCAAGGTTAATATAGG;

nCoV_IP4-14084Probe(+)

TCATACAAACCACGCCAGG [5']Fam [3']BHQ-1. All positive samples were quantified using
a standard curve and expressed as number of RNA copies per mL.

Quantification of plasma viral load
SARS-CoV-2 viremia was quantified in each patient blood sample using the NaicaTM droplet
based digital PCR (ddPCR) machine StillaInc (Villejuif, France) with COVID-19 Multiplex
Crystal digital PCR detection kit (ApexbioInc, Beijing, China) as previously described (Veyer et
al., 2020). Plasma viral RNA was extracted using QIAamp® Viral RNA Mini Kit following the
manufacturer guidelines. Results were automatically analyzed using "Crystal reader"

and "Crystal Miner" software and SARS CoV-2 viral concentration (cp/mL) were finally
calculated considering the extracted volume of plasma (140 µL).

S-Pseudotype neutralisation assay
293T cells stably expressing ACE2 (293T-ACE2) were made by lentiviral transduction and
selection with puromycin (1 ug/mL). To perform the assay, 2x104 cells were detached with
PBS-EDTA and seeded in Flat-bottom 96-well plates. S-pseudotypes were incubated with
the sera to be tested (at 1:100 dilution, unless otherwise specified) in culture medium,
incubated 15 min at RT and added on transduced cells. After 48 hours Bright-Glo

TM

Luciferase Assay System was added to the wells and the luciferase signal was measured
with EnSpire® Multimode Plate Reader (PerkinElmer). The percentage of neutralization was
calculated as follow: 100 x (1 − mean (luciferase signal in sample duplicate)/mean(luciferase
signal in virus alone)). S-pseudotypes incubated without serum and medium alone were used
as positive and negative controls, respectively.

Bacterial DNA isolation and 16S rRNA sequencing
We extract total genomic DNA from swabs samples, using the NucleoSpin® 96 Genomic
DNA kit (Macherey-Nagel ®). Negative control samples included buffers only. Briefly, the
pellets were incubated with Ready-Lyse™ Lysozyme Solution (250 U/μl) (Epicentre,
Hessisch Oldendorf, Germany) for 30 minutes at 37°C followed Proteinase K digestion buffer
at 55°C overnight. Carrier (20 μg glycogen) was added and DNA extraction was performed
as per manufacturers’ instructions. DNA was eluted in 25 μl and immediately frozen at -80°C.
The concentration of extracted DNA is determined using TECAN (QuantiFluor® ONE dsDNA
System, Promega), and DNA integrity and size were also confirmed with the Agilent 2100
Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA). The V3-V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA was
amplified

using

V3-340F

(CCTACGGRAGGCAGCAG)

and

V4-805R

(GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT) primers (Chakravorty, Helb et al. 2007, Castelino, Eyre et
al. 2015). The primers have a primer linker, primer pad, unique 8-mer Golay barcode which

was used to tag PCR products from respective samples and negative control. PCR reactions
consisted of 18 μl of AccuPrime Pfx Super Mix (12344-040; Invitrogen), 0.5 μl of each
primers and 1 μl of DNA (10 ng). PCR was carried out as follows: 95 °C for 2 min, 30 cycles
of 95 °C for 20 s, 55 °C for 15 s and 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension step at 72 °C for
10 min on a Biorad thermocycler. PCR products were cleaned using Nucleo Mag magnetic
purification beads (MACHEREY-NAGEL Kit) following the protocol, quantified with the Quanti
Fluor® ONE dsDNA kit (Promega), and pooled in equal amounts of each PCR product.
Library pools were loaded at 12pM with a 15% PhiX spike for diversity and sequencing
control, onto a v3 300-bp paired end reads cartridge for sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq
NGS platform.

Sequence processing and statistical analysis
After removing reads containing incorrect primer or barcode sequences and sequences with
more than one ambiguous base, we recovered from 42 samples a total of 8.075.384 reads
(192.271 reads on average). The bioinformatics analysis was performed as previously
described (Volant et al., 2020). Briefly, amplicons were clustered into operational taxonomic
units (OTU) with VSEARCH (v1.4) and aligned against the SILVA database. The input
amplicons were then mapped against the OTU set to get an OTU-abundance table
containing the number of reads associated with each OTU. The normalization, statistical
analyses and multiple visualization were performed with SHAMAN (SHiny application for
Metagenomic Analysis (shaman.c3bi.pasteur.fr) based on R software.

Bacterial load quantification by qPCR
To gain further insight into microbiota counts, a qPCR was applied, using universal 16S
rRNA primers to measure total bacteria (16S_F: 5’-ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG-3’ and 16S
and 16S_R: 5’-ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG-3’) and 18S rRNA primers to measure total fungi
(18S_F:

5’-ATTGGAGGGCAAGTCTGGTG-3’

and

18S_R:

5’-

CCGATCCCTAGTCGGCATAG-3’) (Qiu, Zhang et al. 2015). PCR reactions consisting of 10

μL SYBR Green PCR master mix (Roche), 1 μL (10 nM) each primer, 200 ng template cDNA
in 20 μL of reaction carried out on an ABI StepOnePlus Sequence Detection System
(Applied Biosystems). Thermocycling reactions consisted of 1 min at 95 °C followed by 40
cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 15 s at 56 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C.

Statistical analysis
GraphPad Prism was used for statistical analysis. Cytokines were filtered first on variance
(σ>2) to remove analytes where the majority of values were at or close to the limit of
detection (LOD). P values were determined by a Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by Dunn’s
post-test for multiple group comparisons with median reported; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P <
0.001. Correlations between the different assays were calculated using Spearman test.
Heatmaps were generated with Qlucore OMICS explore Version 3.5(26). Correlation
matrices were built using the Spearman correlation, and computed using R (v4.0.3).
Correlation plots were generated with R package `corrplot`(v0.84). The Multi-Dimensional
Scaling (MDS) plots were derived from the correlation matrices by defining a similarity metric
equal to `1-Rs(a,b)` where Rs(a,b) is the spearman correlation between factor a and b. MDS
computation was performed with the 'cmdscale' function from the `stats`package (v4.0.3).
Plots were made using the ggplot2 package (v3.3.2).
