Azithromycin for COVID-19
23

SUMMARY

24

Background: Azithromycin has been proposed as a treatment for COVID-19 on the

25

basis of its immunomodulatory actions. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of

26

azithromycin in hospitalised patients with COVID-19.

27

Methods: In this randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial, several

28

possible treatments were compared with usual care in patients hospitalised with

29

COVID-19 in the UK. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated to either

30

usual standard of care alone or usual standard of care plus azithromycin 500 mg once

31

daily by mouth or intravenously for 10 days or until discharge (or one of the other

32

treatment arms). Patients were twice as likely to be randomised to usual care as to any

33

of the active treatment groups. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. The trial is

34

registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04381936).

35

Findings: Between 7 April and 27 November 2020, 2582 patients were randomly

36

allocated to receive azithromycin and 5182 patients to receive usual care alone. Overall,

37

496 (19%) patients allocated to azithromycin and 997 (19%) patients allocated to usual

38

care died within 28 days (rate ratio 1·00; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0·90-1·12;

39

p=0·99). Consistent results were seen in all pre-specified subgroups of patients. There

40

was no difference in duration of hospitalisation (median 12 days vs. 13 days) or the

41

proportion of patients discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (60% vs. 59%; rate

42

ratio 1·03; 95% CI 0·97-1·10; p=0·29). Among those not on invasive mechanical

43

ventilation at baseline, there was no difference in the proportion meeting the composite

45

CI 0·89-1·07; p=0·54).

46

Interpretation: In patients hospitalised with COVID-19, azithromycin did not provide

47

any clinical benefit. Azithromycin use in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 should be

48

restricted to patients where there is a clear antimicrobial indication.

NOTE:

54

Enrolment to the azithromycin arm of the RECOVERY trial was closed on 27 November

55

2020. Here we report the preliminary findings based on a data cut on 30 November

56

2020. Final results will be made available after the last patient has completed the 28-

57

day follow-up period for the primary outcome on 25 December 2020. As with previous

58

reports, we anticipate >99% follow-up of all patients due to the linkage with routine NHS

59

data. With 1483 deaths among a total of 7764 patients included in the current report, the

60

findings are unlikely to change in any material way.

Azithromycin for COVID-19
62

INTRODUCTION

63

A substantial proportion of individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome

64

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) develop a respiratory illness requiring hospital care, which

65

can progress to critical illness with hypoxic respiratory failure requiring prolonged

66

ventilatory support. Among COVID-19 patients admitted to UK hospitals in the first wave

67

of the epidemic, the case fatality rate was over 26%, and in excess of 37% in patients

68

requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.1

69

Among patients with severe COVID-19, the host immune response is thought to play a

70

key role in driving an acute pneumonic process with diffuse alveolar damage,

71

inflammatory infiltrates, and microvascular thrombosis.2 The beneficial effects of

72

dexamethasone and other corticosteroids in patients with hypoxic lung damage suggest

73

that other drugs that suppress or modulate the immune system may provide additional

74

improvements in clinical outcomes.3,4

75

Macrolide antibiotics, such as azithromycin, clarithromycin and erythromycin, are widely

76

available and their safety is well established. In addition to antibacterial properties, they

77

are known to have immunomodulatory activity, decreasing production of pro-

78

inflammatory cytokines and inhibiting neutrophil activation.5-7 They are widely used both

79

in bacterial pneumonia due to their antimicrobial activity and in chronic inflammatory

80

lung disease due to their immunomodulatory effects.8,9 In addition, azithromycin has in

81

vitro antiviral activity against a range of viruses including SARS-CoV-2.10,11

82

The use of macrolides in influenza-associated pneumonia has been associated with a

83

faster reduction in inflammatory cytokines and, in combination with naproxen,

convincing clinical benefit of macrolides in COVID-19.15-17 Here we report the

hospitalised with COVID-19.

METHODS

90

Study design and participants

91

The Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 therapy (RECOVERY) trial is an investigator-

92

initiated, individually randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial to

93

evaluate the effects of potential treatments in patients hospitalised with COVID-19.

94

Details of the trial design and results for other possible treatments (dexamethasone,

95

hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir-ritonavir) have been published previously.3,18,19 The

96

trial is underway at 176 hospitals in the United Kingdom (appendix pp 2-22), supported

97

by the National Institute for Health Research Clinical Research Network. The trial is

98

coordinated by the Nuffield Department of Population Health at the University of Oxford

99

(Oxford, UK), the trial sponsor. The trial is conducted in accordance with the principles

100

of the International Conference on Harmonisation–Good Clinical Practice guidelines and

101

approved by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)

102

and the Cambridge East Research Ethics Committee (ref: 20/EE/0101). The protocol,

103

statistical analysis plan, and additional information are available on the study website

104

www.recoverytrial.net.

Azithromycin for COVID-19
105

Although the azithromycin, dexamethasone, hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir-ritonavir

106

arms have now been stopped, the trial continues to study the effects of tocilizumab,

107

convalescent plasma, REGEN-COV2 (a combination of two monoclonal antibodies

108

directed against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein), aspirin, and colchicine. Other

109

treatments may be studied in future.

110

Patients admitted to hospital were eligible for the study if they had clinically suspected

111

or laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and no medical history that might, in the

112

opinion of the attending clinician, put the patient at significant risk if they were to

113

participate in the trial. Initially, recruitment was limited to patients aged at least 18 years

114

but from 9 May 2020, the age limit was removed. Patients with known prolonged QTc

115

interval or hypersensitivity to a macrolide antibiotic and those already receiving

116

chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine were excluded from being randomised between

117

azithromycin and usual care. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients,

118

or a legal representative if they were too unwell or unable to provide consent.

119

Randomisation and masking

120

Baseline data were collected using a web-based case report form that included

121

demographics, level of respiratory support, major comorbidities, suitability of the study

122

treatment for a particular patient, and treatment availability at the study site (appendix

123

pp 26-28). Eligible and consenting patients were assigned to either usual standard of

124

care or usual standard of care plus azithromycin or one of the other available

125

RECOVERY treatment arms using web-based simple (unstratified) randomisation with

126

allocation concealed until after randomisation (appendix pp 23-25). Randomisation to

127

usual care was twice that of any of the active arms the patient was eligible for (e.g. 2:1

128

in favour of usual care if the patient was eligible for only one active arm, 2:1:1 if the

129

patient was eligible for two active arms). For some patients, azithromycin was

130

unavailable at the hospital at the time of enrolment or if a macrolide antibiotic was

131

considered by the managing physician to be either definitely indicated or definitely

132

contraindicated. These patients were excluded from the randomised comparison

133

between azithromycin and usual care. Patients allocated to azithromycin were to

134

receive azithromycin 500 mg by mouth, nasogastric tube, or intravenous injection once

135

daily for 10 days or until discharge, if sooner. Allocated treatment was prescribed by the

136

managing doctor. Participants and local study staff were not masked to the allocated

137

treatment. The Steering Committee, investigators, and all others involved in the trial

138

were masked to the outcome data during the trial.

139

Procedures

140

A single online follow-up form was completed when participants were discharged, had

141

died or at 28 days after randomisation, whichever occurred earliest (appendix p 29-35).

142

Information was recorded on adherence to allocated study treatment, receipt of other

143

COVID-19 treatments, duration of admission, receipt of respiratory or renal support, and

144

vital status (including cause of death). In addition, routine healthcare and registry data

145

were obtained including information on vital status (with date and cause of death),

146

discharge from hospital, receipt of respiratory support, or renal replacement therapy.

147

Outcomes

Azithromycin for COVID-19
148

Outcomes were assessed at 28 days after randomisation, with further analyses

149

specified at 6 months. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary

150

outcomes were time to discharge from hospital, and, among patients not on invasive

151

mechanical ventilation at randomisation, invasive mechanical ventilation (including

152

extra-corporal membrane oxygenation) or death. Prespecified subsidiary clinical

153

outcomes were cause-specific mortality, use of haemodialysis or haemofiltration, major

154

cardiac arrhythmia (recorded in a subset), and receipt and duration of ventilation.

155

Among those on invasive mechanical ventilation at randomisation, a subsidiary clinical

156

outcome of successful cessation of invasive mechanical ventilation was defined as

157

cessation within (and survival to) 28 days. Information on suspected serious adverse

158

reactions was collected in an expedited fashion to comply with regulatory requirements.

159

Statistical Analysis

160

An intention-to-treat comparison was conducted between patients randomised to

161

azithromycin and patients randomised to usual care but for whom azithromycin was

162

both available and suitable as a treatment. For the primary outcome of 28-day mortality,

163

the log-rank observed minus expected statistic and its variance were used to both test

164

the null hypothesis of equal survival curves (i.e., the log-rank test) and to calculate the

165

one-step estimate of the average mortality rate ratio. We constructed Kaplan-Meier

166

survival curves to display cumulative mortality over the 28-day period. The 2059

167

patients (27%) who had not been followed for 28 days and were not known to have died

168

by the time of the data cut for this preliminary analysis (30 November 2020) were either

169

censored on 30 November 2020 or, if they had already been discharged alive, were

170

right-censored for mortality at day 29 (that is, in the absence of any information to the

Azithromycin for COVID-19
171

contrary they were assumed to have survived 28 days). [Note: This censoring rule will

172

not be necessary for the final report.] We used similar methods to analyse time to

173

hospital discharge and successful cessation of invasive mechanical ventilation, with

174

patients who died in hospital right-censored on day 29. Median time to discharge was

175

derived from Kaplan-Meier estimates. For the pre-specified composite secondary

176

outcome of invasive mechanical ventilation or death within 28 days (among those not

177

receiving invasive mechanical ventilation at randomisation) and the subsidiary clinical

178

outcomes of receipt of ventilation and use of haemodialysis or haemofiltration, the

179

precise dates were not available and so the risk ratio was estimated instead.

180

Prespecified analyses of the primary outcome were performed separately in seven

181

subgroups defined by characteristics at randomisation: age, sex, ethnicity, level of

182

respiratory support, days since symptom onset, use of corticosteroids, and predicted

183

28-day mortality risk (appendix p 26). Observed effects within subgroup categories were

184

compared using a chi-squared test for heterogeneity or trend, in accordance with the

185

prespecified analysis plan.

186

Estimates of rate and risk ratios are shown with 95% confidence intervals. All p-values

187

are 2-sided and are shown without adjustment for multiple testing. The full database is

188

held by the study team which collected the data from study sites and performed the

189

analyses at the Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford (Oxford,

190

UK).

191

As stated in the protocol, appropriate sample sizes could not be estimated when the trial

192

was being planned at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (appendix p 26). As the trial

193

progressed, the trial steering committee, whose members were unaware of the results

194

of the trial comparisons, determined that sufficient patients should be enrolled to provide

195

at least 90% power at a two-sided p-value of 0.01 to detect a clinically relevant

196

proportional reduction in the primary outcome of 20% between the two groups.

197

Consequently, on 27 November 2020, the steering committee, blinded to the results,

198

closed recruitment to the azithromycin comparison as sufficient patients had been

199

enrolled.

200

Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 and R version 3.4.0. The trial is

201

registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04381936).

Role of the funding source

203

The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data

204

interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding authors had full access to all

205

the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for

RESULTS

209

Between 7 April 2020 and 27 November 2020, 9434 (57%) of 16443 patients enrolled

210

into the RECOVERY trial were eligible to be randomly allocated to azithromycin (that is

211

azithromycin was available in the hospital at the time and the attending clinician was of

212

the opinion that the patient had no known indication for or contraindication to

213

azithromycin, figure 1; appendix p 38). 2582 patients were randomly allocated to

Azithromycin for COVID-19
214

azithromycin and 5182 were randomly allocated to usual care, with the remainder being

215

randomly allocated to one of the other treatment arms. The mean age of study

216

participants in this comparison was 65·3 years (SD 15·7) and the median time since

217

symptom onset was 8 days (IQR 5 to 11 days) (table 1; appendix p 38).

218

Among the 5910 (76%) patients for whom a follow-up form has been completed to date,

219

1760 (89%) allocated to azithromycin vs. 55 (1%) allocated to usual care received at

220

least one dose, and 1836 (92%) vs. 606 (15%) received any macrolide antibiotic (figure

221

1; appendix p 39). The median duration of treatment with azithromycin was 6 days (IQR

222

3-9 days). Use of other treatments for COVID-19 was similar among patients allocated

223

azithromycin and among those allocated usual care, with nearly one half receiving a

224

corticosteroid, about one-fifth receiving remdesivir, and one-fifth receiving convalescent

225

plasma.

226

We observed no significant difference in the proportion of patients who met the primary

227

outcome of 28-day mortality between the two randomised groups (496 [19%] patients in

228

the azithromycin group vs. 997 (19%) patients in the usual care group; rate ratio 1·00;

229

95% confidence interval [CI], 0·90 to 1·12; p=0·99; figure 2). We observed similar

230

results across all pre-specified subgroups (figure 3). In an exploratory analysis restricted

231

to the 6916 (89%) patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, the result was similar

232

(rate ratio 0·99, 95% CI 0·88 to 1·10; p=0·81).

233

Allocation to azithromycin was associated with a similar time until discharge from

234

hospital alive as usual care (median 12 days vs. 13 days) and a similar probability of

235

discharge alive within 28 days (60% vs. 59%, rate ratio 1·03, 95% CI 0·97 to 1·10,

p=0·29) (Table 2). Among those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, the

237

number of patients progressing to the pre-specified composite secondary outcome of

238

invasive mechanical ventilation or death among those allocated to azithromycin was

239

similar to that among those allocated to usual care (21% vs. 22%, risk ratio 0·97, 95%

240

CI 0·89 to 1·07, p=0·54). Allowing for multiple testing in interpretation of the results,

241

there was no evidence that the effect of allocation to azithromycin vs. usual care on time

242

until discharge from hospital alive or on invasive mechanical ventilation or death differed

243

between pre-specified subgroups of patients (appendix p 43-44).

244

We found no significant differences in the prespecified subsidiary clinical outcomes of

245

cause-specific mortality (appendix p 40), use of ventilation, successful cessation of

246

invasive mechanical ventilation, or need for renal dialysis or haemofiltration (Table 2).

247

We observed no significant differences in the frequency of new cardiac arrhythmias

248

(appendix p 41). There was one report of a serious adverse reaction believed related to

249

azithromycin: a case of pseudomembranous colitis from which the patient recovered

250

with standard treatment.

251
252

DISCUSSION

253

The results of this large randomised trial show that azithromycin is not an effective

254

treatment for patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Allocation to azithromycin was not

255

associated with reductions in mortality, duration of hospitalisation or the risk of being

256

ventilated or dying for those not on ventilation at baseline. These results were

257

consistent across the prespecified subgroups of age, sex, ethnicity, duration of

261

immunomodulatory activity.7 Although no major organization or professional society has

262

recommended the routine use of azithromycin in COVID-19 unless there is evidence of

263

bacterial super-infection, it has nevertheless been used widely in COVID-19 patients,

264

particularly in combination with hydroxychloroquine.20-22 Macrolides have long been

265

suggested as potential therapies for inflammatory viral pneumonias but this has been

266

based on in vitro, animal and observational data, with very little clinical trial evidence of

267

benefit.11-13 The benefit of dexamethasone in COVID-19 patients requiring respiratory

268

support suggests that inflammation has a causal role in mortality.3 Noting that the

269

results were consistent regardless of whether patients were also being treated with a

270

corticosteroid or not, we conclude that the immunomodulatory properties of

271

azithromycin are either insufficient or off-target in COVID-19.

272

Macrolides are commonly used to treat bacterial infections of the lower respiratory tract

273

because of their good activity against Gram positive bacteria and atypical pathogens

274

such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella species, and their excellent tissue

275

penetration. More than 75% of hospitalised COVID-19 patients are prescribed

276

antibiotics and the widespread clinical use of macrolides in COVID-19 is likely to be

277

driven largely by concerns of bacterial superinfection rather than purported

278

immunomodulatory activity.23 It is therefore important to highlight that in patients with

Azithromycin for COVID-19
280

secondary bacterial lung infection, there was no observed clinical benefit of

281

azithromycin use. This lack of effect may either reflect the relatively low rate of

282

secondary bacterial infection in COVID-19 or the widespread use of other antibiotics

283

such as β-lactam antibiotics, which may have abrogated any anti-bacterial benefit of

284

allocation to azithromycin in this trial.24,25 Our results show that azithromycin confers no

285

clinical benefit in hospitalised COVID-19 patients, whether that be anti-inflammatory or

286

antimicrobial. Although we detected no harm to individual patients treated with

287

azithromycin, there is a risk of harm at a societal level from widespread use of

288

antimicrobial agents. Azithromycin is classified within the WHO Watch Group of

289

Antibiotics: antibiotics that have higher resistance potential and should be prioritized as

290

key targets of antimicrobial stewardship programs. In light of the new evidence from the

291

RECOVERY trial, the widespread use in COVID-19 patients of macrolides in particular

292

and antibiotics in general must be questioned.26

293

Our trial has some limitations: Detailed information on laboratory markers of

294

inflammatory status, co-existent bacterial infection, or use of non-macrolide antibiotics

295

was not collected, nor was information on radiological or physiological outcomes. This

296

initial report is based on complete follow-up for the primary outcome in 73% of patients

297

(and partial follow-up for the remaining 27%). However, collection of outcome

298

information both through case report forms and linkage to routine NHS records is

299

ongoing and, based on previous reports from this trial, will deliver complete follow-up

300

information for over 99% of patients by early January 2021. However, additional follow-

301

up is unlikely to change the conclusion that azithromycin has no meaningful benefit for

302

hospitalised patients with COVID-19.

Azithromycin for COVID-19
303

Three other randomised controlled trials have assessed the efficacy of azithromycin for

304

the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalised patients, all of which additionally treated

305

patients with hydroxychloroquine.15-17 The COALITION I and COALITION II trials found

306

that allocation

307

hydroxychloroquine, was not associated with any improvement in mortality, duration of

308

hospital stay, or clinical status as assessed using an ordinal outcome scale.15,16 A small

309

trial in Iran that randomised patients to hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir with

310

or without azithromycin also found no significant difference in mortality or intensive care

311

unit admission, but suggested a reduction in duration of hospital stay.17 The total

312

number of patients in all three prior trials combined was 1223, with 130 deaths. The

313

RECOVERY trial, with 7764 participants and 1483 deaths in this assessment of

314

azithromycin, is far better powered to detect modest treatment benefits; none were

315

observed.

316

At the time of writing, 24 trials evaluating the use of macrolides in COVID-19 patients

317

were registered in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, of which two

318

(COALITION I and COALITION II, described above) have published results. Of the

319

remaining 22, 16 are studying macrolides in inpatients either alone or in combination

320

with other putative treatments, whilst 6 are studying non-hospitalised patients with

321

suspected or confirmed COVID-19.

322

Whilst our findings do not address the use of macrolides for the treatment of non-

323

hospitalised COVID-19 patients with early, mild disease, the results do show that

324

azithromycin is not an effective treatment for hospitalised COVID-19 patients.
