Abstract
The rapid expansion of COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic. Although quarantine measures have been
used widely, the critical steps among them to suppress the outbreak without a huge social-economic loss remain
unknown. Hong Kong, unlike other regions in the world, had a massive number of travellers from Mainland
China during the early expansion period, and yet the spread of virus has been relatively limited. Understanding
the effect of control measures to reduce the transmission in Hong Kong can improve the control of the virus
spreading.
We have developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) meta-population model
that can stratify the infections into imported and subsequent local infections, and therefore to obtain the control
effects on transmissibility in a region with many imported cases. We fitted the model to both imported and
local confirmed cases with symptom onset from 18 January to 29 February 2020 in Hong Kong with daily
transportation data and the transmission dynamics from Wuhan and Mainland China.
The model estimated that the reproductive number was dropped from 2.32 to 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66 to 0.86) after an
infected case was estimated to be quarantined half day before the symptom onset, corresponding to the incubation
time of 5.43 days (95% CI, 1.30-9.47). If the quarantine happened about one day after the onset, community
spread would be likely to occur, indicated by the reproductive number larger than one. The results suggest that
the early quarantine for a suspected case before the symptom onset is a key factor to suppress COVID-19.

Introduction

1

The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, originally occurred from Wuhan, China, in December 2019 has caused

2

a global pandemic in March 2020 [1,2]. Regions in East Asia, such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea and Japan, all

3

faced an extremely high risk of community outbreak due to a massive number of travellers from Mainland China

4

during the Chinese new year [3, 4]. However, comparing to many other countries until now (March 2020), the

5

coronavirus outbreak was still considered limited in Hong Kong and Taiwan [5]. The low number of transmission

6

can be due to a successful public health control strategy. To understand how coronavirus can be contained in

7

these places is of great importance to limit the global spread of the virus happening right now.

8

9

Presently, nonpharmaceutical interventions including both mitigation and suppression strategies have been pro-

10

posed to control the outbreak [6]. Suppression strategies were often intensive that can be challenging to fully

11

implemented in many countries such as transportation restriction or city lockdown [4, 7]. How Hong Kong

12

successfully prevent the outbreak without shutting down most of the public services thus offers us a different

13

perspective on how to choose a containing strategy.

14

15

As most countries, quarantine and border control policies were taken in order to stop the spread of the coronavirus

16

from Wuhan. During the Chinese New Year festival, which started on 24 January in 2020, more than one million

17

of travellers (some were Hong Kong residents) arrived Hong Kong from Mainland in a week [8]. Local spread

18

occurred starting from this critical moment when only few initial travellers who carried the disease. Therefore,

19

infected individuals were reported almost every day with travel history from Wuhan or Mainland China from

20

18 January 2020 until 4 February 2020, when most of the border crossings were closed [9]. After 28 January,

21

most the travellers from Mainland require 14 days self-quarantine. Quarantine and border control were the major

22

control measures performed during this period in Hong Kong.

23

24

Assessing the effect of quarantine measures during this period in Hong Kong may provide an opportunity to

25

understand how an outbreak can be suppressed (indicated by a reproductive number below one), by quarantine

26

measures without extremely intensive interventions. However, challenge exists in assessing the effect on trans-

27

missibility in Hong Kong using classical transmission models, such as susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR)

28

or susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) models, because many confirmed cases were identified as

29

imported cases. To obtain the reproductive number, an indication of the transmissibility of the virus, the num-

30

ber of secondary infections of a given infected individual should be estimated. However, with many imported

cases, the observed changes in numbers of cumulative cases are not totally due to those secondary infections

32

happened locally. Because current models cannot distinguish the imported and local infections, overestimation

33

of the reproductive number can be easily happened.

34

35

In order to estimate the reproductive number and other epidemiological parameters of COVID-19 in Hong Kong,

36

here we developed a susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) meta-population model em-

37

bedded with passenger data from Mainland China, that can stratify imported and local cases. We used Hong

38

Kong as an example to demonstrate that the model can successfully recapture the transmission dynamics of both

39

imported and local infections and estimate the reproductive number. Furthermore, the minimum timing and

40

intensity of quarantine to suppress the outbreak were estimated.

Data collection

43

We collected the date of symptom onset time for each daily newly infected case of COVID-19 from 18 January to

44

29 February 2020 in Hong Kong from the Centre for Health Protection, Government of the Hong Kong Special

45

Administrative [10]. Number of daily newly infected COVID-19 cases in Wuhan City and Mainland China

46

outside Wuhan from 16 January to 29 February 2020 were collected from the National Health Commission of

47

China [11]. Daily passenger data from Mainland China during the corresponding period were obtained from the

48

Hong Kong Immigration Department [12].

SEIQR Meta-population model

50

The meta-population model was fitted first to the data from Wuhan and Mainland China (outside Wuhan). Using

51

the reconstructed transmission dynamics from source regions, the model was next fitted to the confirmed cases

52

with symptom onset in Hong Kong with transportation data. Assuming the newly emergence of COVID-19

53

causes an outbreak at location i, during the emergence, the changes of the numbers of infectious cases Ij at a

54

different location j can be determined using a meta-population framework with a mobility matrix (contact mixing

55

+ Ij

where the subscripts imp and loc represent imported and

56

is dependent on the mobility matrix. We developed an SEIQR model to

57

include dynamics of both imported and local cases at a target location (Hong Kong), and linked this model to

Parameter estimation

93

Prior to parameter estimation, the transmission dynamics in Wuhan and non-Wuhan Mainland China were re-

94

constructed using a modified SIR model. The resulting source dynamics were used as an initial condition to

95

seed imported cases for the target region (Figure S1 and Figure S2). Second, the posterior distributions of the

96

parameters of transmission dynamics in Hong Kong were obtained using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)

97

to fit the detected infected cases from the model to the reported cases with symptom onset. The posterior distri-

98

butions were obtained from Metropolis-Hastings in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with 1.2 × 106 steps

99

(Figure S3 and Figure S4) to guarantee an effective sample size (ESS) of greater than 200 for all parameters.

100

The Gelman-Rubin convergence diagnostic was used and all the scores were less than 1.056 and near one, which

101

confirmed the convergence.

102

Prior distributions for all the parameters were set to uniform distributions except the generation time T c and

103

the recontact ratio q. The prior of the generation time was assumed to be normally distributed with mean set

104

to be 7.95 days, the average from two previous studies [15, 16]. The standard deviation was 0.25. The mean

105

recontact ratio of being quarantined and not quarantined in a Gaussian prior was set to be 12% with a standard

106

deviation of 0.05. A recent study has estimated each individual can contact 12.5 persons on average during a

108

possible expected number 1.5 persons, the mean recontact ratio of quarantined individuals to unquarantined in

the prior distribution can thus be determined as q =

Likelihood of symptom onset

112

The likelihood of observing onset dates of both confirmed imported and confirmed local cases in Hong Kong

113

were calculated based on Poisson distribution during MCMC. Newly detected infected cases are defined as the

114

newly infected cases with symptom onset that eventually became quarantined. We assumed all the confirmed

115

cases were quarantined. The daily newly detected imported cases with symptom onset was used as the expected

116

value of the Poisson distribution and can be derived as ∆Iimp (σ)D, where ∆Iimp = τ1 Eimp , and D is the detec-

117

tion ratio, which was defined as the proportion of the number of quarantined imported cases to the total number

118

of infectious and quarantined cases. σ represents the pre-symptomatic transmission period, which produced a

119

delay of onset after an individual has been infected. The same approach can be used to determine the expected

120

value of the Poisson distribution for the detected local cases.

Results

127

Dynamics of imported and local cases

128

Our meta-population model reproduced the COVID-19 transmission dynamics of both imported and local infec-

129

tions in Hong Kong. The number of cumulative imported cases was increasing rapidly in Hong Kong after the

130

first imported case was detected, with onset day on 18 January 2020 until the end of Chinese New Year in early

131

February (Figure 1A). The risk of community spread was highlighted as the number of local cases crossed above

132

the imported cases. In order to understand the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, we devel-

133

oped an SEIQR meta-population model that stratifies imported and local cases (Figure 2). The model recaptured

134

the cumulative numbers with a crossover between the local and imported cases (Figure 1B) and transient dy-

135

namics (Figure 3). The predicted number of imported cases reached to a peak on 26 January (Figure 3A). These

136

imported cases immediately caused a wave of local infections. The number of daily newly detected local cases

137

reached to a peak around 2 February and decreased afterward (Figure 3B).

138

139

Epidemiological parameters

140

Epidemiological parameters of COVID-19 were obtained for Hong Kong from 18 January to 29 February. The

141

effective reproductive number Re was 0.76 (0.66 - 0.86) (Table 2). R0 was 2.32 (1.19 - 4.42), referring to the

142

reproductive number when the quarantine measure was not included. Latent period was 1.94 days (0.34 - 4.17).

143

The pre-symptomatic transmission period before disease onset was 3.49 days (0.48 - 5.80). The incubation time

144

was calculated as 5.43 days (1.30 - 9.47), consistent with recent findings, where a mean or median incubation

145

period of approximately 5 days was reported [16,19,20]. We assumed all the infected persons can pass the border

146

before disease onset, which was defined as the incubation time. The estimated time to quarantine after being

147

infectious Tqr in Hong Kong is 2.92 days (0.65 - 7.81) days, which is nearly two days less than the incubation

148

period. The recontact ratio of quarantined to unquarantined individuals q was 10.26% (5.32 − 17.8). The model

149

estimated only 22% (9 − 41) of total infected cases were documented in Mainland China.

150

151

Effect of quarantine on Reproductive Number

152

The timing of quarantine was an important measurement to determine the risk of community spread. The esti-

153

mated Tqr in Hong Kong was about half day earlier than the symptom onset time and was able to reduce Re to

154

be less than one (Figure 4A). If Tqr was longer than one day after disease onset, Re became greater than one, the

155

community spread could happen. Furthermore, the recontact ratio of quarantined to unquarantined individuals

156

affected the value of Re . If the q became about two and a half larger than the estimated value, Re was greater

158

effects of quarantine measures during an infection generation was illustrated (Figure 5). Sensitivity analysis has

159

been performed to evaluate the impact of initial setting of generation time to the effective reproductive number.

160

For sensitivity analysis, we have tested two alternative model settings, with the generation time fixed at 7.5 or

161

8.4 days. Both of the settings gave the mean Re of 0.76 or 0.77 as well.

162

163

Effects of quarantine on Detection Ratio

164

The results showed that the ratio can be low during the initial period but soon reached saturated values after 3

165

weeks both for imported and local cases (Figure 6AB). Generally the detection ratios of the imported cases were

166

higher than the local cases because the number of the imported cases were low. For local cases, 71%(46 − 90) of

167

which were detected, estimated by our model. One day delay of quarantine reduced about 10% of daily detection

168

ratio to 60%(39 − 74) (Figure 6B). Only 31%(20 − 39) of them could be detected or quarantined if quarantine

169

was delayed 6 days. The results showed that not only early quarantine can reduce reproductive number, but also

170

has a benefit on increasing overall detection ratio.

denote the proportion of daily newly cases with symptom onset that eventually become quarantined among all
infectious cases. Blue, the detection ratio estimated using the posterior distribution of the time to quarantine,
denoted as no delay. Red, the detection ratio estimated using the posterior distribution of the time to quarantine
with one day delay. Green, the detection ratio estimated using the posterior distribution of the time to quarantine
with six days delay. Shared areas are the 95% intervals. (B) Detection ratios of local cases. The ratios denote the
proportion of daily newly cases with symptom onset that eventually become quarantined among all infectious
cases. Same definition of colors are used as (A) but for local infections.

Discussion

173

By characterizing the transmission dynamics with quarantine and border control measures across the Chinese

174

New Year festival in Hong Kong, we have identified the key aspects in containing the outbreak. This is the first

175

study to demonstrate that early time targeted quarantine measures significantly suppress the COVID-19 outbreak

176

and the proper timing of quarantine is feasible. Suppression of the outbreak during the study period is important

177

because global expansion occurred starting from this critical moment when initial travellers who carried the

178

diseases moved to different countries [21–24].

179

180

Until now, how to suppress the outbreak of COVID-19 has been studied only in regions with many infections,

181

such as Wuhan or China [4, 21, 25, 26]. Although certain strict public health policies can suppress the outbreak,

182

these approaches can cause profound social and economic impacts, which may not be feasible by every country.

183

In contrast, our study illustrated that Hong Kong can be a good model to learn how to prevent the community

184

spread through quarantine before many other intensive control policies (such as transportation restriction and

185

closure of public facilities) are required.

186

187

How to impose a large scale quarantine properly to suppress the outbreak remain largely unknown [6]. Our

188

results demonstrated that quarantine of suspected individuals before symptom onset, is critical to contain the

189

COVID-19 outbreak. Given that the incubation period was about 5 days and the confirmation of COVID-19

190

infection can often be delayed, to guarantee an early quarantine of all suspected cases before symptom onset is

191

a critical criterion to reduce the chance of community spread.

192

193

Using a model that can stratify both dynamics of imported and local infections, we demonstrated that many

194

epidemiological parameters, including the reproductive number, latent period and incubation time, along with

195

the reporting ratio in Mainland China can be estimated after fitting confirmed cases with symptom onset in Hong

196

Kong with daily transportation data. Generation time we used are adopted from previous studies studies with

197

the estimated mean of 7.8 days [15, 16]. The values, such as incubation time and reporting ratio are consistent to

198

recent studies [7, 16, 19, 20].

199

200

One of the major challenges to limit the COVID-19 epidemic through quarantine is pre-symptomatic trans-

201

mission. Currently, little is known about when does the transmission occur before the symptom. Our model

202

has found, an individual after latent period, can be infectious without symptoms about 3 days, similar to 1-3

days found by many recent studies through contact tracing and enhanced investigation of clusters of confirmed

204

cases [27–30]. Thus, even if a very intensive contact tracing is proposed, to identify all the contacts made by an

205

infectious individual before symptom onset can be difficult. Thus, how to reduce social contacts and maintain

206

social distancing along with quarantine measures become critical to prevent the spread. To evaluate the bene-

207

fits of different approaches to reduce unnecessary contacts, such as working from home, wearing masks, etc,

208

becomes an important task [31, 32].

209

210

The study highlights the importance of having a time targeted quarantine measure along with travel bans. Inves-

211

tigating the timing and the quality of quarantine in different outbreak regions is a critical factor for prevention

212

and control of COVID-19 outbreak.

Supplementary Methods
Dynamics in source regions
To obtain the number of imported cases, the model has to generate transmission dynamics in source
regions is to seed the target region (Hong Kong). We modified an SIR to construct newly infected
numbers that were close to the observed confirmed numbers in Wuhan and Mainland China (outside
Wuhan).

Where 𝛼𝛼 is a parameter to represent the effect of reduction of social contacts after the Wuhan lockdown
on 23 January 2020 and the closure of the border crossings on 4 February 2020 [1]. As a result, reduction
of susceptible population happens by time. Assuming generation time is 8.4 days thus we have the
recovery rate 𝛾𝛾 =

8.4

. Using 𝑅𝑅0 = 2.92, we can obtain 𝛽𝛽 = 𝑅𝑅0 𝛾𝛾 = 0.3476 in Mainland China. We also

assumed the recovery rate is same for 𝛾𝛾 both transmission dynamics in Mainland China and in Hong
Kong.

Effective reproductive number calculation

The effective reproductive number 𝑅𝑅𝑒𝑒 , was calculated using the next-generation matrix approach after
obtaining the posterior distributions of model parameters. Following the same notation as in the study
by Diekmann et al[2]. We obtained the transmission matrix 𝑇𝑇 and the transition 𝑆𝑆. Elements in 𝑇𝑇
represents the average newly infected cases in exposed group (E) transmitted by a single infected
individual in infectious or quarantined group (I), which can be calculated as 𝛽𝛽
calculated as the first eigenvector of −(𝑇𝑇𝑆𝑆 −1 ) with the following formulas:
