DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DURING COVID-19

Abstract
Purpose: This study explored the COVID-19 pandemic’s impacts on domestic violence (DV)
with the following research questions: 1) Did DV occurring during the pandemic differ on
certain variables from cases occurring on a typical day the previous year? 2) Did DV occurring
after the implementation of shelter-in-place orders differ (on these same variables) from cases
occurring prior to shelter-in-place orders? Methods: Two logistic regression models were
developed to predict DV case differences before and during the pandemic. DV reports (N=4618)
were collected from the Chicago Police Department. Cases from March 2019 and March 2020
were analyzed based on multiple variables. One model was set to predict case differences since
the pandemic began, and another model was set to predict case differences during the shelter-inplace period later that month. Results: Both models were significant with multiple significant
predictors. During the pandemic period, cases with arrests were 20% less likely to have occurred,
and cases at residential locations were 22% more likely to have occurred. During the shelter-inplace period, cases at residential locations were 64% more likely to have occurred, and cases
with child victims were 67% less likely to have occurred. Conclusions: This study offers a rapid
analysis of DV case differences since the pandemic and shelter-in-place began. Additional
variables and data sources could improve model explanatory power. Research, policy, and
practice in this area must pivot to focus on protecting children whose access to mandated
reporters has decreased and moving victims out of dangerous living situations into safe spaces.

When “Shelter-in-Place” Isn’t Shelter That’s Safe: A Rapid Analysis of Domestic Violence
Case Differences During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Stay-at-Home Orders
Purpose
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc across the world since late 2019, causing
nearly 5 million individuals to fall ill and over 300,000 to die, according to the Johns Hopkins
Coronavirus Resource Center as of mid-May 2020 (Dong, Du, & Gardner, 2020). COVID-19’s
impact on the United States (U.S.) began in late January 2020, and the numbers of individuals
impacted is still rising exponentially, with a total of 1,508,291 cases and 90,340 deaths (Dong,
Du, & Gardner, 2020). While research has jump-started to develop testing, treatment, and
vaccines, the impact of the COVID-19 on social factors cannot be ignored. The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have recommended that individuals stay six feet away
apart, not gather in groups, and only venture out for necessities (CDC, 2020b). As a result,
businesses closed or reduced operations, schools moved online, and many individuals began
working from home (CDC, 2020a). In March 2020, a number of states began issuing statewide
stay-at-home or “shelter-in-place” orders further restricting their residents, including Illinois
(Petrella, St. Clair, Johnson, & Pratt, 2020), which, at the time of this study, had the third largest
number of COVID-19 cases of all states (Dong, Du, & Gardner, 2020). Given the unique
circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, research is needed to identify its impacts on
individuals, families, and communities.
With social distancing recommendations and shelter-in-place orders making abrupt
changes to the ways people interact, this study aimed to understand the pandemic’s potential
impacts on one volatile form of interpersonal interaction: domestic violence. Utilizing the U.S.

Department of Justice (DOJ) definition, domestic violence includes violence toward current or
former intimate partners, family members (including children), or anyone with whom the
perpetrator shares a home (U.S. DOJ, 2019). Such violence has far-reaching impacts; 1 in 3
women and 1 in 4 men in the U.S. have experienced some form of violence from an intimate
partner over the life course (Black et. al., 2011), and 68-80% of children have been exposed to
violence in the home (Jaffe, 2018). Domestic violence has devastating effects on its victims and
their loved ones, with mental health consequences and physical injuries being common; Black
and colleagues (2011) noted that women with a history of violence were nearly three times more
likely to rate their physical or mental health as poor, which may be compounded in the midst of a
global pandemic. Domestic violence can also be fatal; approximately 55% of female homicide
victims are killed by an intimate partner (CDC, 2019).
Research on domestic violence prevention and treatment during the pandemic is ongoing.
At the time of this study, scholars had published commentaries regarding COVID-19’s potential
impact on mental health issues broadly (Kumar & Navar, 2020) and domestic violence more
specifically (Abramson, 2020; Bosman, 2020; Usher, Bhullar, Durkin, Gyamfi, & Jackson, 2020;
Van Gelder et. al., 2020). However, at that time, no known peer-reviewed studies had analyzed
domestic violence rates in light of the pandemic. With more individuals at home due to shelterin-place orders, violence may happen more frequently behind closed doors and in increased
isolation. Individuals may also have decreased access to resources, given that especially given
that first responders, service providers, and mandated reporters may experience reduced staffing
and increased virtual interactions (CDC, 2020a).
These changes to access may be felt more acutely by individuals in communities with
strict stay-at-home orders, like in Illinois, where schools were closed the end of the spring

semester (Petrella, St. Clair, Johnson, & Pratt, 2020). During this time of increased stress,
financial strain, and fear for many (Brooks et. al., 2020), changes may then be seen in domestic
violence, the factors comprising it, and the individuals experiencing it. Research is needed to
understand what domestic violence looks like in this unprecedented moment, so that prevention
and treatment can shift in order to appropriately respond.
Research Questions
This study analyzed the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on domestic
violence reports in the U.S. through logistic regression analysis. Two models were developed to
predict changes in domestic violence before and during the pandemic at different time points,
utilizing data from a large Illinois city before and during the height of key policy changes. This
study analyzed relationships between the timeframe of domestic violence occurrence and a
number of key variables. This study poses the following research questions:
1. Will domestic violence occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 differ
on certain variables (the presence of a sex offense, weapon use, resulting arrest, presence
of child victims, and residential locationality) from domestic violence occurring on a
typical day in March 2019?
2. Will domestic violence occurring after the implementation of COVID-19 shelter-in-place
orders on March 21, 2020, differ on these same variables from domestic violence
occurring during the pandemic but prior to shelter-in-place orders?
Methods
Sampling
The study’s sample is comprised of police reports from the Chicago Police Department
(CPD). Data was downloaded from the Chicago Data Portal in early May 2020. Reports on cases

that occurred during the months of March 2019 and March 2020 were utilized. March 2019 was
used as a “usual circumstances” comparison to the March 2020 calls, which occurred as the
COVID-19 pandemic took hold on this city. March 2020 is also the month in which Chicago’s
first shelter-in-place order was put into effect (Petrella, St. Clair, Johnson, & Pratt, 2020), which
became a point of analysis.
There were 19,747 police reports documented by CPD for March 2019 cases, and there
were 15,852 reports for March 2020 cases. The data was narrowed to any reports considered
domestic incidents, for a total of 6,559 reports, and subsequently imported from a CSV file into a
Stata data file. The sample was then reduced only to reports involving some kind of physical or
sexual violence toward a person. These offenses included any kind of assault, any kind of
battery, homicide, criminal sexual assault, any sex offense against an adult, and any physical or
sexual offenses against children. (Arson, damage to property, trespassing, “deceptive practices”
such as identity theft, robbery, theft, and weapons violations were excluded. Stalking,
kidnapping, verbal harassment, and violations of orders of protection were also not included, as
these could not be confirmed to have a component of physical or sexual violence.) The final
sample consisted of 4,618 police reports. This dataset did not include any demographic
information about victims or perpetrators; information was limited to basic case descriptors,
crime code and characteristics, location data, and basic date/time information.
Variables and Instrumentation
Two dependent variables were analyzed: occurrence of domestic violence during the
pandemic or not, and occurrence of domestic violence during shelter-in-place order or not. These
two dependent variables, as well as several independent variables, are described as follows:
Occurrence of domestic violence during COVID-19 pandemic. One dependent

variable for this study was whether or not a domestic violence case occurred during the COVID19 pandemic. For this study, March 2019 and March 2020 police calls were the two groups
analyzed, and these represented the dummy coding for this variable, with March 2020 cases
being the group of interest and March 2019 being the reference group. This coding reflected the
study’s purpose of determining any significant differences in the composition of domestic
violence cases before and during the pandemic. To create this variable, any report for domestic
violence occurring between March 1-31, 2020, was coded as “pandemic” = “1.” Any report for
domestic violence occurring between March 1-31, 2019, was coded as “pandemic” = “0.”
Occurrence of domestic violence during shelter-in-place order. The other dependent
variable for this study was whether or not a domestic violence case occurring during the
pandemic happened before or after Chicago’s shelter-in-place order took effect, as this order
placed additional constraints on individual’s interactions and whereabouts. The shelter-in-place
or “stay-at-home” order went into effect on March 21, 2020, at 5:00pm (Petrella, St. Clair,
Johnson, & Pratt, 2020). Cases occurring on or after this time comprised the group of interest,
and cases between March 1, 2020, and the start time of the shelter-in-place order on March 21,
2020, comprised the reference group. This coding reflected the study’s purpose of determining
any significant differences in the composition of domestic violence cases before and during
shelter-in-place. To create this variable, any report for domestic violence occurring between
March 21 at 5:00pm and March 31 at 11:59pm, was coded as “stayhome” = “1.” Any report for
domestic violence occurring between March 1 at 12:00am and March 21 at 4:59pm was coded as
“stayhome” = “0.”
Presence of sex crime. The presence of a sex crime during domestic violence was one
independent variable analyzed. For the purposes of this research, sex crime was operationalized

as any of the following crimes: criminal sexual assault, sex offense, and any sexual offenses
against children. A variable called “sexcrime” was created. Any case containing one of these
elements was coded as “1,” and any case that did not was coded as “0.”
Use of weapon. Use of a weapon during domestic violence was another independent
variable contributing to these analyses. In CPD records, all cases involving weapons were
designated as “aggravated” per the criminal code. A variable called “weapon” was created. Any
case involving the use of a weapon was coded as “1,” and any case that did not was coded as “0.”
Whether or not arrest was made. The issuance of an arrest during a domestic violence
report was another independent variable contributing to these analyses. In CPD records, all cases
in which an arrest was made were coded as such. A variable called “arrest” was created. Any
case in which an arrest was made was coded as “1,” and any case without was coded as “0.”
Presence of child victim(s). The presence of one or more child victims in a domestic
violence report was another independent variable contributing to these analyses. In CPD records,
cases involving children were categorized as “offenses against children.” A few crimes (n=7) in
which child victims were referenced in descriptions, but not categorized under “offenses against
children,” were manually recoded under this category. A variable called “child” was created, and
any case involving a child victim was coded as “1.” Any cases without a reported child victim
were coded as “0.” An interaction term was also created between presence of child victims and
presence of sex crimes.
Location of offense. A final independent variable was location—more specifically,
whether or not the violence took place at someone’s residence. For the purposes of this research,
residence was operationalized as any of the following locations: apartment; residence; nursing
home facility; or the grounds, parking lot, or yard of any of these locations. Hotels were not

included as residences, nor were any commercial locations or outside spaces unattached to a
place where someone lived. A variable called “residence” was located, and any case taking place
at one of these residences was coded as “1.” All cases taking place elsewhere were coded as “0.”
Data Analysis Plan and Rationale
Logistic regression analysis was chosen as the primary data analysis tool for this study, as
a number of independent variables were of interest, thus justifying the need for a multivariate
analysis. Utilizing a maximum likelihood estimator, logistic regression analysis selects
coefficients that maximize the probability of reproducing the sample data. Since two “whether or
not” situations were being examined, it makes sense to analyze them in terms of probabilities or
likelihood of each event occurring. Two models with dichotomous dependent variables were
developed: one predicted whether or not a domestic violence case took place during the COVID19 pandemic, and the other predicted whether or not a domestic violence case took place after
the shelter-in-place order went into effect. The size of this sample was much greater than the
minimum needed for logistic regression (anywhere from 100-500 observations; Long, 1997). In
addition to ensuring independence of observations and proper sample size, multicollinearity and
influential data checks were performed to ensure these assumptions of logistic regression were
met. Each model utilized in the study and their formal specifications are outlined as follows.
Model 1: Occurrence of domestic violence during COVID-19, regressed on multiple
variables. The first logistic regression model featured occurrence of domestic violence before or
during the COVID-19 pandemic regressed on the following independent variables: presence of a
sex crime, weapon use, resulting arrest, presence of child victim(s), and residential locationality.
Under this model, it is expected that, all other things being equal: when a sex crime is present,
probability of domestic violence occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic changes; when a

weapon is used, probability of domestic violence occurring during this pandemic changes; when
an arrest is made, probability of domestic violence occurring during this pandemic changes;
when a child victim is present, probability of domestic violence occurring during this pandemic
changes; and when the location of the violence is a residence, probability of domestic violence
occurring during this pandemic changes. The intercept in this model is the predicted log odds of
domestic violence’s occurrence before or during the COVID-19 pandemic when there is no sex
crime present, no weapon use, no resulting arrest, no child victim(s), and the location of the
violence was not a residence. The formal model specification is as follows:
𝑃(𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑐 = 1) =

1
1 + 𝑒 !(#! $#" %&'()*+&$## ,&-./0$#$ -))&%1$#% (2*34$#& )&%*4&0(&)

Two-tailed significance testing was performed on each regression coefficient, and odds
ratios and their confidence intervals were reported. Two-tailed testing was chosen due to the
unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and its yet unknown effects on domestic
violence. Given the exploratory nature of this study, this test is appropriate. Joint hypothesis
testing and interaction effects were explored based on various bivariate analyses.
Model 2: Occurrence of domestic violence during shelter-in-place order, regressed
on multiple variables. The second logistic regression model featured occurrence of domestic
violence before or during the shelter-in-place order regressed on the same independent variables
as the first model: presence of a sex crime, weapon use, resulting arrest, presence of child
victim(s), and residential locationality. Under this model, it is expected that, all other things
being equal: when a sex crime is present, probability of domestic violence occurring during
shelter-in-place changes; when a weapon is used, probability of domestic violence occurring
during shelter-in-place changes; when an arrest is made, probability of domestic violence
occurring during shelter-in-place changes; when a child victim is present, probability of domestic

violence occurring during shelter-in-place changes; and when the location of the violence is a
residence, probability of domestic violence occurring during shelter-in-place changes. The
intercept in this model is the predicted log odds of domestic violence’s occurrence before or
during the shelter-in-place order when there is no sex crime present, no weapon use, no resulting
arrest, no child victim(s), and the location of the violence was not a residence. The formal model
specification is below:
𝑃(𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑦ℎ𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 1) =

1
1 + 𝑒 !(#! $#" %&'()*+&$## ,&-./0$#$ -))&%1$#% (2*34$#& )&%*4&0(&)

Similar to the previous model, two-tailed significance testing was performed on each
regression coefficient, with odds ratios and confidence intervals reported. Two-tailed testing was
chosen because of the unprecedented nature of the shelter-in-place orders and their yet unknown
effects on domestic violence. Given the exploratory nature of this study, this test is appropriate.
Similar to the first model, joint hypothesis testing using the likelihood ratio test examined
whether or not weapon use and resulting arrest jointly contribute to the model fit. Also similarly,
joint hypothesis testing and interaction effects were explored based on various bivariate analyses.
Results
Descriptive Statistics
The study’s dataset of March 2019 and March 2020 domestic violence cases contained
4,618 records, with complete information on sex offenses, weapon use, arrests made, child
victims, and crime locations. At this size, the sample was large enough to meet the assumptions
of logistic regression (Long, 1997). All variables were dichotomous, and independence of
observations was met. Descriptive statistics are reported for March 2019 and March 2020
separately and in aggregate (Table 1).
In terms of total domestic violence cases, 51.26% (n=2367) of the sample’s cases

occurred in March 2019 and 48.74% (n=2251) took place in March 2020, meaning that there
were slightly fewer cases during the pandemic month than there were during the previous year’s
“typical” month. During March 2020, 70.32% (n=1583) of cases took place prior to the shelterin-place, and 29.68% (n=668) of cases took place after. This finding is consistent with the fact
that the shelter-in-place began on March 21—just over two-thirds of the way through the month.
In terms of overall trends, the overall sample contained cases with sex crimes 2.84% of
the time, weapon use 14.83% of the time, arrests made 20.23% of the time, child victims
involved 2.97% of the time, and residential locations involved 77.85% of the time. The amount
that these varied by occurrence before or during the COVID-19 pandemic are described in Table
1 and was explored in the multiple logistic regression analyses.
[INSERT TABLE 1]
Bivariate Analyses
Bivariate analyses were conducted on a few independent variables of interest to
determine potential need for interaction terms and joint hypothesis testing.
Several interaction effects were tested preliminarily. The most promising was the
potential interaction between the presence of a sex crime and the presence of child victims, for
both data-driven and theoretical reasons. Victims of sex crimes and child victims are two
particularly vulnerable groups whose need for in-person mandated reporting and emergency
medical resources may be particularly impacted during a pandemic and/or shelter-in-place
period, and the experience of their intersection—child sexual victimization—is prevalent
(Finkelhor, Shattuck, Turner, & Hamby, 2014). Chi-square analysis revealed a strong association
between presence of a sex crime and presence of child victims (Table 2).
Additionally, weapon use and the involvement of an arrest in domestic violence posed an

interesting relationship. Previous research has pointed to a relationship between weapon use in
domestic violence and subsequent arrest in that situation (Sorenson, 2017). Chi-square analysis
revealed a significant association between these two variables (Table 2). Joint hypothesis testing
using likelihood ratio was utilized on these two significantly associated variables, because the
size and significance of their association was smaller than the association between sex crimes
and child victims. Other bivariate relationships were analyzed, but they did not yield statistically
significant results, and thus interactions between those variables were not built into final models.
[INSERT TABLE 2]
Logistic Regression Analyses
Models were constructed for both dependent variables after several experimental runs.
Since chi-square analysis revealed a strong association between presence of a sex crime and
presence of child victims, an interaction term of these two variables was included in preliminary
runs. The interaction term was not significant for either model, so this term was dropped. Results
of each model are presented in Tables 3 and 4 and are detailed as follows.
Model 1: Occurrence of domestic violence during COVID-19, regressed on multiple
variables. The results of the first logistic regression model, predicting occurrence of domestic
violence during COVID-19 regressed on several key variables, provided interesting findings with
low explanatory value per its pseudo R2 (Table 3).
In terms of overall model appropriateness, Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test
indicated that the logistic response function was appropriate with a non-significant chi-square
value of 9.07, p=.97. To check for multicollinearity problems, a variance inflation factor (VIF)
test was run, resulting in a low mean VIF of 1.09, indicating no problems. Influential data was
assessed with Cook’s distance and was not a problem for this model.

A chi-square test was then performed on the log-likelihood ratio, resulting in a
statistically significant overall model (X2=24.12, df=5, p<.001). In addition to the significant
intercept, the variables of resulting arrest and residential location were both significant. Odds
ratios were then interpreted for arrest (.804) and residential location (1.224). All other things
being equal, a domestic violence case with an arrest made was approximately 20% less likely
(than cases without arrests) to have occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, all
other being equal, a domestic violence case occurring at a residential location was 22% more
likely (than cases at other locations) to have occurred during the pandemic. The pseudo R2 was
.004, meaning that the model only accounted for .4% of the variation in the dependent variable.
A joint hypothesis test was also conducted to determine whether or not weapon use and
resulting arrest jointly contributed to the model fit. The model was run with all variables, and
then run again with weapon use and arrest dropped from the model. In comparing the -2 loglikelihood between the two models and obtaining a test chi-square, a significant chi-square of
X2=8.95, df=2, p=.01 was found, indicating that at least one of the variables tested—either
weapon use, resulting arrest, or both—was significant.
[INSERT TABLE 3]
Model 2: Occurrence of domestic violence in shelter-in-place, regressed on multiple
variables. The results of the second logistic regression model, predicting occurrence of domestic
violence during the shelter-in-place period regressed on several key variables, provided
additional significant findings, but again with low explanatory value pseudo R2 (Table 4).
In terms of overall model appropriateness, Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test
indicated that the logistic response function was appropriate with a non-significant chi-square
value of 13.66, p=.62. To check for multicollinearity problems, a VIF test was run, resulting in a

low mean VIF of 1.05, indicating no problems. Influential data was assessed with Cook’s
distance and was not a problem for this model.
A chi-square test was then performed on the log-likelihood ratio, resulting in a
statistically significant overall model (X2=27.08, df=5, p<.01). In addition to the significant
intercept, in this model, residential location was once again significant. This time, however,
resulting arrest was not at all significant, whereas the presence of a child victim was. Odds ratios
were then interpreted for residential location (1.638) and child victim (.329). All other being
equal, a domestic violence case occurring at a residential location was thus approximately 64%
more likely (than cases at other locations) to have occurred during the shelter-in-place. Similarly,
a domestic violence case with a child victim was 67% less likely (than cases without child
victims) to have occurred during the shelter-in-place order. The pseudo R2 was .01, meaning that
the model only accounted for 1% of the variation in the dependent variable. This was a slight
improvement over the previous model.
A joint hypothesis test was conducted once more to determine whether or not weapon use
and resulting arrest jointly contributed to the model fit. This model was run with all variables,
and then run again with weapon use and arrest dropped from the model. This time, in comparing
the -2-log-likelihood between the two models and obtaining a test chi-square, the chi-square
value was not significant at X2=1.95, df=2, p=.38, so the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, and
the conclusion is that that neither variable was significant. Weapon use and resulting arrest did
not jointly contribute to this model, unlike the previous one.

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DURING COVID-19

16

This study offers a rapid comparison of domestic violence cases occurring in a large
midwestern city before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to the lack of literature
in this critical area. The two models—one predicting occurrence of domestic violence during the
pandemic, and the other predicting occurrence of domestic violence during the shelter-in-place
period—offer multidimensionality in analyzing the pandemic’s impact, taking its rapidlychanging nature (both epidemiologically and policy-wise) into account. While both models had
low explanatory power (.4% and 1%, respectively), the models were statistically significant at
p<.001 (model 1) and p<.01 (model 2). More important, multiple key characteristics (also
significant at p<.01 or better) were identified as important predictors of how domestic violence
may differ during the pandemic and under shelter-in-place orders.
Residential location was a significant predictor in both models. Location had an even
greater impact during the shelter-in-place period, as residential cases were 64% more likely to
have occurred during the shelter-in-place order than during the pandemic but before the order.
During both periods in 2019 and 2020, cases occurring in a residential location comprised over
75% of all domestic violence cases analyzed, so this study’s finding is not all that notable given
the already high numbers of cases occurring in the home. However, this finding also suggests
that domestic violence first responders and service providers may need to focus their efforts on
residential areas and additional methods of reaching individuals who are staying at home. This
finding may also suggest that individuals in this particular area at this particular time were taking
precautions and staying at home, which may suggest compliance with shelter-in-place orders.
Two other predictor variables were significant. Arrests were less likely during the
pandemic, but only by 20%; this impact did not hold when shelter-in-place was ordered. What
did change during shelter-in-place was the presence of child victims—by quite a margin. With

cases with child victims being 67% less likely to have occurred during the shelter-in-place order,
the question here may be less about occurrence and more about reporting, a point referenced by
Piquero and colleagues (2020) in their exploration of domestic violence in Dallas during stay-athome orders. This finding illuminates a need for further research to understand the relationship
between the COVID-19 pandemic and reporting for child victims of domestic violence,
particularly around its impacts on mandated reporting numbers and access.
While a minor focus of this analysis, one more notable finding is the total number of
reported domestic violence cases during the pandemic as compared to the previous year. With
51.26% (n=2367) of these cases occurring before the pandemic, in this sample, police reports of
domestic violence actually went down. This finding contradicts previously reported statistics of
domestic violence increases during the COVID-19 pandemic (Bosman, 2020; Leslie & Wilson,
2020), but is corroborated by Mohler and colleagues’ (2020) finding that the overall effect of the
pandemic on crime in Los Angeles and Indianapolis was less than expected. It also adds weight
to Piquero and colleagues’ (2020) finding of a two-week spike and subsequent drop in domestic
violence in Dallas, as well as Bullinger and colleagues’ (2020) estimation of underreporting of
domestic violence in Chicago during the period of this study. (For more on crime rates during
COVID-19, see also Stickle & Felson, 2020.) While variables and case types may differ across
reports, greater attention may be needed on the source of the report—police versus hotline
data—than has been available in the U.S., which is an area now being explored by SilverioMurillo and colleagues (2020) in Mexico City.
Limitations and Strengths
This study is limited in a few key ways. A major limitation is the lack of available data.
Several data sources in Chicago were searched and contacted throughout the research process,

but only administrative police data was available at the time of the study. Additionally, this data
was limited in the number of available variables, and extensive and rapid data management was
needed to ready it for logistic regression analysis. Particularly concerning was the lack of
demographic information about perpetrators and victims, which limited the richness of the
analysis and the ability to understand the pandemic’s impact on domestic violence for certain
communities. It is understandable that data would be sparse during this time, with reduced
staffing and competing priorities. Some data, especially confidential domestic violence
organization data, is simply not available as quickly as a pandemic would necessitate.
Additionally, there were time and methodological constraints that impacted the depth of
analysis with the data available. With more time to explore different crime codes, types of abuse
such as telephone harassment, stalking, and order of protection violations could have been
included. Finally, low pseudo R2 results and the limitation to one metropolitan area reduce
generalizability and explanatory power of the findings, significant though they may be.
The study’s strengths are the large sample, the innovation in working with available data,
and the rapidness of response. Utilizing a large city’s data allowed for nearly 5,000 domestic
violence cases to be analyzed, offering great statistical power for this exploratory study. The
study was also able to adapt to available data through a rapid data management strategy that
recoded crime codes into dichotomous variables. The use of both pandemic and shelter-in-place
timeframes for analysis, with a direct comparison group to the year prior, made for a more robust
analysis and provides a glimpse at the rapid changes that data can take on during this
unprecedented time. Lastly, the study was able to make quick use of data that was available only
a month prior to analysis. Its rapid approach to analysis and writing during such limitations and
strain can serve as a model for other social work research during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Implications
This study provides a glimpse at how domestic violence may differ during the COVID-19
pandemic and its shelter-in-place orders, as well as a few key ways in which those differences
manifest. Domestic violence first responders and service providers, as well as researchers, must
pivot their approaches to understanding, preventing, and treating this problem given the rapidlyevolving nature of COVID-19 and its impacts on social and economic crisis (Sharma & Borah,
2020). Given the significant findings of cases more likely to occur in residences and less likely to
involve child victims during shelter-in-place, additional resources are needed in this critical
areas, both to make residential areas safer and to protect children who are vulnerable at this time.
The latter point is perhaps the study’s most notable finding, and one in which urgent responses
may be needed. With in-person access to mandated reporters like teachers and social workers
being restricted due to stay-at-home orders, innovative ways of understanding and responding to
children’s experiences in the home are needed to adapt to these new circumstances.
The low explanatory power of the two regression models could be improved with the
identification of additional important predictors. For future research to improve, additional
sources of data are needed, as are greater availability of variables that might contribute to model
explanatory power. Davis and colleagues (2020) made gains in this area by quickly attaching a
four-item tool to an actively-running intimate partner violence survey to assess self-reports of
COVID-19 and risk of perpetration and victimization. Other information such as the length of
wait time for police response, location of first contact with police and service providers, cooccurring protective order violations, and elements of virtual/cyber abuse would be useful to
further understanding the problem. Future research could compare domestic violence reported to
police, to hotlines, and both during the pandemic, compared to usual reporting rates, to determine

which services individuals are accessing during this time that looks so different from the norm.
Open data sharing between research and practice realms would assist in this regard.
Lastly, funding must be directed to service providers, to move victims out of dangerous
living situations, where more violence is being reported, and into safe spaces. Sheltering in place
may create safety from COVID-19, which is of great public benefit. However, if physical and
emotional safety are put at greater risk as a result, research and resources are needed to make
sure individuals are simultaneously safe from both kinds of threats.
Note Added
Since the initial submission of this work, global case totals of COVID-19 have gone up
by nearly 1000%, and global deaths have more than quadrupled. Given the continued seriousness
of the pandemic and need for rapid data analysis, the author is delighted to see research on
COVID-19 and domestic violence gain further traction in several since-published articles
(Gebrewahd et. al., 2020; Mohler et. al., 2020; Piquero et. al., 2020; Sediri et. al., 2020; Sharma
& Borah, 2020; Stickle & Felson, 2020), as well as forthcoming and working papers (Bullinger,
Carr, & Packham, 2020; Davis, Gilbar, & Padilla-Medina, 2020; Leslie & Wilson, 2020;
Ravindran & Shah, 2020; Silverio-Murillo, Balmori de la Miyar, & Hoehn-Velasco, 2020). The
author is indebted to these scholars for their important contributions in the wake of this study.
