Abstract

14

Objective

15

This living systematic review aims to provide a timely, rigorous and continuously updated summary

16

of the evidence available on the role of remdesivir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 .

17
18

Methods

19

We adapted an already published common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the

20

specificities of this question.

21

Eligible studies were randomised trials evaluating the effect of remdesivir versus placebo or no

22

treatment.

23

We conducted searches in the L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system

24

that maps PICO questions to a repository maintained through regular searches in electronic

25

databases, preprint servers, trial registries and other resources relevant to COVID-19. All the

26

searches covered the period until 25 August 2020. No date or language restrictions were applied.

27

Two reviewers independently evaluated potentially eligible studies according to predefined selection

28

criteria, and extracted data on study characteristics, methods, outcomes, and risk of bias, using a

29

predesigned, standardised form.

30

We performed meta-analyses using random-effect models and assessed overall certainty in evidence

31

using the GRADE approach.

32

A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic.

33

We will resubmit it every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates.

Results

36

Our search strategy yielded 574 references. Finally, we included 3 randomised trials evaluating

37

remdesivir in addition to standard care versus standard care alone. The evidence is very uncertain

38

about the effect of remdesivir on mortality (RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.05; very low certainty evidence)

39

and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.24; very low certainty

40

evidence). On the other hand, remdesivir likely results in a large reduction in the incidence of

41

adverse effects in patients with COVID-19 (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.84; moderate certainty

42

evidence).

43
44

Conclusions

45

The evidence is insufficient for the outcomes critical for making decisions about the role of

46

remdesivir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, so it is not possible to balance the potential

47

benefits, if any, with the adverse effects and costs.

Introduction

71

COVID-19 is an infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus [1]. It was first identified in Wuhan,

72

China, on December 31, 2019 [2]; seven months later, more than fifteen million cases of contagion

73

had been identified across 188 countries [3]. On March 11, 2020, WHO characterised the COVID-19

74

outbreak as a pandemic [1].

75

While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some might progress to pneumonia, acute

76

respiratory distress syndrome and death [4],[5],[6]. The case fatality rate reported across countries,

77

settings and age groups is highly variable, but it ranges from about 0.5% to 10% [7]. In hospitalised

78

patients, it has been reported to be higher than 10% in some centres [8].

79

One of the strategies underway to identify effective interventions for COVID-19 is repurposing drugs

80

that have been used for the treatment of other diseases.

81

Remdesivir is among these investigational medications. It is a directly acting antiviral agent, initially

82

developed for the treatment of Ebola virus during the 2014 outbreak in Western Africa [9].

83

Remdesivir displays antiviral activity against many RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2, in both in vitro

84

[10] and animal studies [11].

85

Following the publication of the ACTT-1, a trial conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and

86

Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the US Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use

87

authorisation of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 [12].

88

However, the results of ACTT-1 were questioned immediately, particularly for the decision to stop it

89

early for benefit [13]. On the other hand, the decision of the government of the United States of

90

buying virtually all stocks of the drug, generated an urgent need of independent, transparent

91

information about the effects of remdesivir for COVID-19.

92

Using innovative and agile processes, taking advantage of technological tools, and resorting to the

93

collective effort of several research groups, this living systematic review aims to provide a timely,

94

rigorous and continuously updated summary of the evidence available on the effects of remdesivir in

95

patients with COVID-19 .

96
97

Methods

98

This manuscript complies with the ‘Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-

99

Analyses’ (PRISMA) guidelines for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses [14] (see

Search strategies

107
108

Electronic searches

109

We used the search strategies already developed in the L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence)

110

platform (https://www.iloveevidence.com), a system that maps the evidence to different research

111

questions. The full methods to maintain L·OVE are described in the website, but the process to

112

devise the search strategies can be briefly described as:

113

●

Identification of terms relevant to the population and intervention components of the

114

search strategy, applying Word2vec technology [17] to the corpus of documents available in

115

Epistemonikos Database.

116

●

Discussion of terms with content and methods experts to identify relevant, irrelevant and
missing terms.

117
118

●

Creation of a sensitive boolean strategy encompassing all the relevant terms

119

●

Iterative analysis of articles missed by the boolean strategy, and refinement of the strategy

120

accordingly.

121
122

All the information in the L·OVE platform comes from a repository developed and maintained by

123

Epistemonikos Foundation through the screening of different sources relevant to COVID-19. At the

124

time of releasing this article, this repository included more than 66989 articles relevant to

125

Coronavirus disease, coming from the following databases, trial registries, preprint servers and

126

websites relevant to COVID-19: Epistemonikos database, Pubmed, EMBASE, ICTRP Search Portal,

137

The last version of the methods, the total number of sources screened, and a living flow diagram and

138

report of the project is updated regularly on the website [18].

139

The repository is continuously updated [18] and the information is transmitted in real time to the

140

L·OVE platform, however, it was last checked for this review the day before release on 25 August

141

2020. The searches covered the period from the inception date of each database, and no study

142

design, publication status or language restriction was applied.

143

The following strategy was used to retrieve from the repository the articles potentially eligible for

145

this review.

152
153

Other sources

154

In order to identify articles that might have been missed in the electronic searches, we proceeded as

155

follows:

156

●

Screened the reference lists of other systematic reviews.

157

●

Scanned the reference lists of selected guidelines, narrative reviews and other documents.

158
159

Eligibility criteria

160

We included randomised controlled trials evaluating patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 of any

161

severity.

162

The intervention of interest was remdesivir at any dosage, duration, timing or route of

163

administration. The comparison of interest was placebo (remdesivir plus standard of care versus

164

placebo plus standard of care) or no treatment (remdesivir plus standard of care versus standard of

165

care).

166

Our primary outcome of interest was all-cause mortality at longest follow-up. Secondary outcomes

167

were invasive mechanical ventilation and adverse effects leading to discontinuation.

168

We also extracted information on the following outcomes: time to viral clearance, length of hospital

169

stay and serious adverse effects.

170

We did not consider the outcomes as an inclusion criteria during the selection process. Any article

171

meeting all the criteria except for the outcome criterion was preliminarily included and assessed in

172

full text.

173
174

Selection of studies

175

The results of the searches in the individual sources were de-duplicated by an algorithm that

176

compares unique identifiers (database ID, DOI, trial registry ID), and citation details (i.e. author

177

names, journal, year of publication, volume, number, pages, article title, and article abstract). Then,

178

the information matching the search strategy was sent in real-time to the L·OVE platform where at

179

least two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts yielded against the inclusion

180

criteria. We obtained the full reports for all titles that appeared to meet the inclusion criteria or

181

required further analysis and then decided about their inclusion.

182

We recorded the reasons for excluding trials in any stage of the search and outlined the study

183

selection process in a PRISMA flow diagram which we adapted for the purpose of this project.

184
185

Extraction and management of data

186

Using standardised forms, two reviewers independently extracted the following data from each

187

included trial: study design, setting, participant characteristics (including disease severity and age)

188

and study eligibility criteria; details about the administered intervention and comparison, including

189

dose, duration and timing (i.e. time after diagnosis); the outcomes assessed and the time they were

190

measured; the source of funding of the study and the conflicts of interest disclosed by the

191

investigators; the risk of bias assessment for each individual study.

192

We resolved disagreements by discussion, with one arbiter adjudicating unresolved disagreements.

193
194

Risk of bias assessment

195

The risk of bias for each randomised trial was assessed by using the 'risk of bias' tool (RoB 2.0: a

196

revised tool to assess risk of bias in randomised trials) [19], considering the following domains of bias

197

for each outcome result of all reported outcomes and time points: bias due to (1) the randomisation

198

process, (2) deviations from intended interventions (effects of assignment to interventions at

199

baseline), (3) missing outcome data, (4) measurement of the outcome, and (5) selection of reported

200

results.

201

Discrepancies between review authors were resolved by discussion to reach consensus. If necessary,

202

a third review author was consulted to achieve a decision.

204

Measures of treatment effect

205

For dichotomous outcomes, we expressed the estimate of treatment effect of an intervention as risk

206

ratios (RR) along with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

207

For continuous outcomes, we used the mean difference and standard deviation to summarise the

208

data along with 95% CI. For continuous outcomes reported using different scales, the treatment

209

effect was expressed as a standardised mean difference with 95% CI.

210
211

Strategy for data synthesis

212

The results of the search and the selection of the studies is presented, by means of the

213

corresponding flow chart, according to recommendations of the PRISMA statement [14]. For any

214

outcomes where it was not possible to calculate an effect estimate, a narrative synthesis is

215

presented, describing the studies in terms of the direction and the size of effects, and any available

216

measure of precision

217

For any outcomes where data was available from more than one trial, we conducted a formal

218

quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis) for studies clinically homogeneous using RevMan 5 [20], using

219

the inverse variance method with the random-effects model. We assessed inconsistency by visual

220

inspection of the forest plots and using the I² index.

221
222

Subgroup and sensitivity analysis

223

As few trials were found, we did not perform sensitivity or subgroup analysis.

224

Assessment of certainty of evidence

225

The certainty of the evidence for all outcomes was judged using the Grading of Recommendations

226

Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group methodology (GRADE Working Group) [21],

227

across the domains of risk of bias, consistency, directness, precision and reporting bias. For the main

228

comparisons and outcomes, we prepared a Summary of Findings (SoF) tables [22],[23].

229
230

Living evidence synthesis

231

An artificial intelligence algorithm deployed in the Coronavirus/COVID-19 topic of the L·OVE platform

232

provides instant notification of articles with a high likelihood of being eligible. The authors review

233

them, decide upon inclusion, and update the living web version of the review accordingly.

234

This review is part of a larger project set up to produce multiple parallel systematic reviews relevant

235

to COVID-19 [15].

Results of the search

241

We conducted searches using L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system

242

that maps PICO questions to a repository, maintained through regular searches in 27 databases,

243

preprint servers, trial registries and websites relevant to COVID-19. All the searches covered the

244

period until 25 August 2020. No date or language restrictions were applied.

245

The search in the L·OVE platform yielded 574 records after removal of duplicates. We considered

246

489 as potentially eligible and obtained and evaluated their full texts. We finally included 3

247

randomised trials (11 references) [24],[25], [26].

248

The reasons for excluding studies at the time of full-text review were the following: not a primary

249

study in humans (396 records); wrong study design (51 records) and wrong comparison (3 records).

250

We also identified 16 ongoing randomised trials.

251
252

The complete study selection process is summarised in the PRISMA flow chart (Figure 1) and the full

253

list of included, excluded and ongoing trials is presented in Appendix 2.

Description of the included studies

258

The three trials identified were the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-1 [24]), the CAP-China

259

remdesivir 2 [25] and SIMPLE 2 [26]. All trials evaluated inpatient adults. ACTT-1 required for

260

inclusion that one of the following criteria were also fulfilled: SpO2 </= 94% on room air, requiring

261

supplemental oxygen, requiring mechanical ventilation or radiographic infiltrates by any imaging

262

test. CAP-China remdesivir 2 required that patients had an oxygen saturation of 94% or lower on

263

room air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or

264

less. Additionally, patients in CAP-China remdesivir 2 had to present within 12 days of symptom

265

onset. SIMPLE 2 [26] required that patients had any radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltrates

266

and oxygen saturation >94% on room air Table 1 and 2 summarises inclusion criteria of the trials and

All trials administered the same doses of remdesivir plus standard care [24] , [25], [26]. One trial

277

included two intervention arms of remdesivir (5-day and 10-day course of remdesivir) [26]. None of

278

the trials provide further details regarding the standard care treatment delivered. Two trials

279

reported that the standard of care was determined by the trial site hospital [24] The other one, only

280

reported that concomitant use of lopinavir/ritonavir, interferons, and corticoids were permitted

281

[25].

guideline for use of other treatments for Covid-19, patients could
receive those treatments. In the absence of a written policy or
guideline, other experimental treatment or off-label use of
marketed medications intended as specific treatment for Covid-19
were prohibited from day 1 through day 29 (though such
medications could have been used before enrollment in this trial).

In total, trials included 1896 hospitalized patients [24], [25], [26]. One trial was conducted in China

284

[25] and the other two were multicenters trials conducted in several countries [24] [26]. All trials

285

included patients with radiologically confirmed pneumonia [25], [25], [26]. Baseline characteristics of

286

participants regarding age, gender, and chronic disease were similar between studies, but the

287

number of patients requiring supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation varied substantially

Risk of bias in the included studies

293

We judge that the overall risk of bias was “high” for all outcomes regarding the ACTT-1 trial [24]. The

294

study was judged to raise “some concerns'' in deviations from the intended intervention domain and

295

“high” in bias due to missing outcome data. CAP-China remdesivir 2 trial overall risk of bias was

the manuscript.

309
310

Primary outcome

311

All-cause mortality.

312

All studies reported this outcome [24],[25],[26] and the evidence is very uncertain about the effect

313

of remdesivir on mortality (RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.05; very low certainty evidence).

Secondary outcomes

319

Invasive mechanical ventilation

320

All studies reported this outcome [24],[25],[26] and the evidence is very uncertain about the effect

321

of remdesivir on the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.24; very low

322

certainty evidence).

327

Adverse effects leading to discontinuation

328

Two trials reported this outcome [24],[25] and remdesivir likely results in a large reduction in the

329

incidence of adverse effects (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.84; moderate certainty evidence).

336
337

Length of hospital stay

338

Two studies reported this outcome [25],[26], but only one was usable for meta analysis [25]. SIMPLE

339

2 trial reported that there were no significant differences between the remdesivir and standard care

340

groups in duration of hospitalisation [25]. Quantitative synthesis showed remdesivir may result in

341

little to no difference in the duration of hospitalisation (MD 1, 95% CI -2.86 to 4.86; Low certainty

342

evidence).

Serious adverse effects

349

355

Discussion

356

We conducted a systematic review and identified 3 randomised trials that reported data on the

357

effect of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19 [24],[25],[26]. Even though remdesivir appears to be

358

safe, the evidence is very uncertain about the impact on the outcomes critical for decision-making in

359

moderate and severe patients, the more relevant clinical scenario for this drug, such as mortality

360

and need of mechanical ventilation.

361

It is unfortunate not knowing yet if one of the pharmaceutical interventions that has sparked more

362

interest is effective or not. One of the limitations comes from the lack of precision of the result for

363

the main outcomes. The early termination of the ACTT-1 trial can be seen as a missed opportunity in

364

this regard [25].

365

In addition, all the trials concluded enrollment before the release of the RECOVERY trial which

366

showed a mortality reduction with dexamethasone [27]. It is not clear if this factor would modify the

367

effect, if any, of remdesivir.

368

By now, clinicians and other decision makers are in a difficult position. The pressure to act is high,

369

particularly after the the US Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorisation of

370

remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 [12]. We anticipate that the range of recommendations

371

from different organisations should range between a suggestion against its use and a weak

372

recommendation for its use in severe cases, especially in settings without resource constraints.

373
374

There are at least 46 ongoing trials that we expect will provide data in the near future. Making sense

375

of this information is not going to be an easy task. Systematic reviews are considered the gold

376

standard to make sense of multiple trials addressing a similar scientific question, but the traditional

377

model for conducting reviews has several limitations, including a high demand for time and

378

resources [28] and a rapid obsolescence [29]. Amidst the COVID-19 crisis, researchers should make

379

their best effort to answer the urgent needs of health decision makers yet without giving up

380

scientific accuracy. Information is being produced at a vertiginous speed [30], so alternative models

381

are needed.

382
383

One potential solution to these shortfalls are rapid reviews, a form of knowledge synthesis that

384

streamlines or omits specific methods of a traditional systematic review in order to move faster.

385

Unfortunately, in many cases, this rapidity comes at the cost of quality [31]. Furthermore, they do

386

not solve the issue of obsolescence. Living systematic reviews do address that issue [32]. They are

387

continually updated by incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available, at a substantial

388

effort. So, an approach combining these two models might prove more successful in providing the

389

scientific community and other interested parties with evidence that is actionable, rapidly and

390

efficiently produced, up to date, and of the highest quality [33].

391
392

This review is part of a larger project set up to put such an approach into practice. The project aims

393

to produce multiple parallel living systematic reviews relevant to COVID-19 following the higher

394

standards of quality in evidence synthesis production [15]. We believe that our methods are well

395

suited to handle the abundance of evidence that is to come, including evidence on the role of

396

lopinavir/ritonavir for COVID-19.

397

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we will maintain the search and selection of evidence for this review

398

continuously updated, and we will every time the conclusions change or whenever there are

399

substantial updates. Our systematic review aims to provide high-quality, up-to-date synthesis of the

400

evidence that is useful for clinicians and other decision-makers.
