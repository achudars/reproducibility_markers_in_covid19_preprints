Estimate of COVID-19 case prevalence in India based on surveillance data of patients with severe
acute respiratory illness

Abstract:
In absence of extensive testing for SARS-CoV-2, true prevalence of COVID-19 cases in India remain
unknown. In this study, a conservative estimate of prevalence of COVID-19 is calculated based on
the age wise COVID-19 positivity rate among patients with severe respiratory illness as reported by
Indian Council of Medical Research. Calculations in the study estimates a cumulative number of
17151 COVID-19 positive cases by the end of April 2, 2020.
Introduction:
The first case of corona virus disease 2019(covid-19) in India due to the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus-2(SARS-CoV-2) was reported on30th January 2020 (1). Despite more than 1.5
million international arrivals to India from January 18 to March 23, India had tested only 5900
individuals for SARS-CoV-2 up until 13th March, 2020 (2,3). Since then, testing was increased but at
total tests of 202551 as of 13th April, 2020, India is still among the countries doing least number of
tests per 1000 people (4,5). In absence of extensive testing, the incidence of COVID-19 cases could
have been vastly underreported. To study the extent of spread of COVID-19 cases, ICMR had tested
for SARS-CoV-2 in samples from patients admitted with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in
multiple centres spread across India from Feb 15 to Apr 2, 2020 (6). In this study I have estimated a
conservative number of possible COVID-19 cases based on the data from ICMR on surveillance of
patients with SARI.
Method:
Data on age wise and total SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate among SARI patients was extracted from
ICMR’s publication of the surveillance (6).
Age wise prevalence of SARI in India during the period of surveillance was estimated as follows. Data
on age wise annual number of deaths due to lower respiratory tract infections (LRI) was extracted
from Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 (GBD 2017) results, available from
http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool. Assuming that the deaths due to LRI would be a
fraction of SARI cases, age wise prevalence of SARI can be estimated with data on case fatality rate
of SARI. Since case fatality rate of SARI was not available for India, data on age wise case fatality rate
of SARI among African countries was used assuming it would be similar to case fatality rate in India
(7). To account for possible seasonality in prevalence of SARI, the resulting number of cases for the
period of surveillance was divided by 2 assuming the prevalence of SARI during the months of March
and April would have been half the average prevalence.
Total number of possible hospitalized COVID-19 cases during the period of surveillance was
estimated age wise from the prevalence of SARI cases calculated as described above and SARS-CoV-2
positivity rate among SARI cases.

Total number of age wise prevalence of COVID-19 cases was estimated from possible hospitalized
COVID-19 cases as calculated above and from published data on age wise hospitalisation rate among
COVID-19 cases (8).
Calculations were done in R.
Results:
Table 1 shows the total number of estimated COVID-19 cases in India. A total of 8100 cases could
have had COVID-19 during the period of March 22 to 28 and another 9051 during the period of
March 29 to Apr 2. Thus, by end of Apr 2, the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases must have been
at least 17151. The actual cumulative number of laboratory confirmed cases stood at 1024 on March
28 and 2545 on April 2 resulting in an ascertainment ratio of 0.13 and 0.15 respectively.
Fig 1 shows plot of estimated number of cases with exponential fit and incidence of laboratory
confirmed cases.
Conclusion:
Conservative estimate of COVID-19 cases in India based on ICMR’s surveillance data of SARI cases
show that low testing rates in India could be vastly underestimating the actual number of cases.
