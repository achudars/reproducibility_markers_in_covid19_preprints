Abstract:
Analysis of COVID-19 cases and prediction of quantity of associated ventilator requirement
is very relevant during this pandemic. This paper presents a method for predictive estimation
of ventilator requirement for COVID-19 patients in Indian states. It uses ARIMA
(Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model for predicting the future cumulative
cases and daily fatality. Taking cue from this, ventilator requirement is estimated for each
state. State wise estimation of ventilator is important because public healthcare system in
India is managed at state level. Dataset on Novel Corona Disease 2019 in India from Kaggle
website is used in this work.
Keywords: COVID-19, Ventilator, ARIMA, Stationarity, fatality rate, prediction
1. Introduction
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus discovered
in 2019.This virus is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person
coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall
on floors or surfaces. People can be infected by breathing in the virus if they are within close
proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then
touching their eyes, nose or mouth. As per clinical management guidelines of World Health
Organization (WHO), most people with COVID -19 develop mild illness (81%), and 14%
develop severe disease that require hospitalisation and oxygen support and 5% require
admission to an intensive care unit [1]. Most of the critically ill patient will require
mechanical ventilation. Most common diagnosis in severe COVID-19 patients is severe
pneumonia. In humans, several corona viruses cause respiratory infections ranging from the
common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [1].
In India first COVID-19 case is reported for a student who returned from Wuhan to Kerala
on 30 January 2020. On 03 February 2020, India reported 3rd case and there was no increase
in cases till 01 March 2020. After that there was an increase in the number of reported cases.
Cumulative cases in the end of June reached 5.48 lakhs. From 25 January 2020 to till date,
India has taken the preventive measures such as health screening at airports and state borders,
introduction of quarantine policies, visa restrictions etc. to contain the virus spread. Indian
government also started five phases of lockdown from 25 March 2020 to 30 June 2020 with
several restrictions such as restricting the movement of entire population of India, closure of
all places of worship, all services and shops closed except pharmacies, hospitals, banks,
grocery shops and other essential services etc. and relaxations given based on zone basis such
as green (areas with zero confirmed cases till date or no confirmed case in the last 21 days.),
red (areas or the hotspots classified as those with the highest caseload) and orange (areas
which have reported a limited number of cases in the past and no surge in positive cases
recently) [2].
As per press release by Press Information Bureau (PIB), on 8 May 2020, on average 4.7% of
COVID-19 patient required ICU, 1.1% required ventilator support and 3.2% were on oxygen
support [3]. Until 01 May 2020, India had 19,398 ventilators available for COVID-19 care
and Government ordered additional 60,000 ventilators [3]. Rishabh Tyagi et. al, proposed a

requirement is calculated based on the five percent of the forecasted active cases [4]. As per
worldometer, serious/ critical patient out of total case is 1.5% for India [5]. Most of the
serious/critical patient require ventilators support. In this paper, a method for predicting the
ventilator requirement for each Indian state by using predicted cumulative confirmed cases
and daily fatality of each Indian states is presented. Estimating the ventilator requirement for
all Indian states is necessary because each state has different number of confirmed cases,
fatality and infection rate and also each state has public health care system managed by the
state itself. And the estimation of ventilator in each state will help the local authorities in
states to make the decision on ventilator requirement in future. So, the prediction of
ventilator requirement is very relevant at this stage.
2.Data Source
Data used for this model is taken from Kaggle website [6]. This data is verified by using the
daily dataset available in Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Govt. of India website [7].
This is a time series data with date, state/union territory, cured, death and confirmed as data
field. Daily fatality for each day is calculated from the cumulative death data. The data is
accessed on 29 June 2020 and data used for this study is from 31 January 2020 to 29 June
2020 (151 days).
3. Methodology
Model selected to predict the future points of in this data is ARIMA model and it is
implemented in Python language. ARIMA is a forecasting algorithm based on the idea that
the information in the past values of the time series can alone be used to predict the future
values. This model is represented by various parameters and model is expressed as ARIMA
(p, d, q) [8]. Here, p stands for the order of auto-regression, d is the degree of trend
difference while q indicates the order of moving average. This model is implemented in
Python.
Parameters such as p and q for ARIMA model is arrived by plotting the Autocorrelation
graph (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation (PACF) of confirmed cases of all states. Augmented
Dickey Fuller (ADF) test is used for finding the d value for ARIMA model [8]. If p value of
ADF test is greater than the significance level 0.05 then the time series is not stationary.
Stationarity of data is achieved by differencing of data. Initial parameters of ARIMA model
is arrived by using the above method and model is evaluated based on how well it fits the data
or its ability to accurately predict the future data points. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)
value is used for evaluating the model [9]. A model parameter that fits the data very well
while using lots of features will be assigned a larger AIC score. Aim is to find the model with
fewer features that yield lowest AIC value.
Ventilator requirement for each state is calculated by using the fatality rate.
Fatality Rate = fatality in i th day / cumulative confirmed cases
Fatality rate for the training data and predicted data is calculated and mean of that value is
used for calculating the ventilator requirement in each state.
4.Result and Discussion
Prediction for the period 30 June 2020 to 01 August 2020 is carried out for all states in India.
State which has the highest number of confirmed case (Maharashtra) is considered for
discussion. Similar way other states study is carried out for the prediction. Figure 1 shows the
ACF and PACF plots of Confirmed cases for Maharashtra. According to PACF and ACF
plot, p and q values are selected and further tuning of the p and q parameters are carried out
according to the AIC value of the model. Final selection of p and q parameters are done by
using the lowest AIC values given by the model.

Daily fatality in each state and UT are predicted and it is shown in Table 2. Andaman and
Nicobar Islands, Dadar Nagar Haveli, Ladakh, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura are having
zero daily fatality in all reported dates. ADF statistics of these states are giving not a number
as the result and this data is analysed and found that mean of the data is one, variance of the
data is zero and lagged difference between the values are zero. In this case, not able to find a
linear regression model for fitting this value for ADF test. Because of that prediction is not
with possible for these data with ARIMA model. Maharashtra will have the highest number
of daily fatality compared to all states followed by Delhi, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. Table 2
shows the predicted value and lower limit and upper limit of predicted value with 95% CI.
Negative value is considered as zero for reading.

Proposed methodology for ventilator quantity requirement is calculated from the fatality rate.
Fatality rate is calculated as the ratio of daily fatality and confirmed case. Mean of the
fatality rate is calculated along with predicted confirmed upper limit value is used for finding
the ventilator requirement. Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Dadar Nagar Haveli, Ladakh,
Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura state prediction for fatality with ARIMA model is not
possible because of the property of the data as discussed earlier (death case). Daily fatality
for these states is zero for all reported dates. These states are assigned three as ventilator
requirement which is the minimum value from all other states because these states are
having zero as the fatality. Total number of ventilators required in India as on 01 August
2020 is 60,504.

5. Conclusion
COVID 19 has been declared as a pandemic by WHO and is currently a major global threat.
This study have conducted to find the cumulative confirmed cases, fatality rate and ventilator
requirement for Indian states in near future. This study helps the administrators in each state
to take decision regarding the induction of ventilators in each state and this will help the
health workers to prepare for future. ARIMA model is selected for predicting the future
confirmed cases and fatality in Indian states. As per the model, confirmed cases are
increasing in the future and the requirement for ventilators are also increasing. But the actual
numbers can go high due to the following factors such as social distancing, testing capacity,
population density, age structure, societal collectivism, repatriation flights from different
countries and movement of informal workers.
