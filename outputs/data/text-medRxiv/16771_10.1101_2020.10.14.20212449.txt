Abstract
Background: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a virus that
causes COVID-19, which has become a worldwide pandemic. However, until now, there is no
vaccine or specific drug to prevent or treat COVID-19. Objectives: To find out the effective
treatment as an antiviral agent for COVID-19, to determine the correlation between sociodemography
with clinical outcomes and duration of treatment, and to determine the relationship between
comorbidities with clinical outcomes and duration of treatment for COVID-19 patients. Methods: A
prospective cohort study was conducted in this study. This study included only confirmed COVID-19
patients who were admitted to the hospital during April-May 2020. Convenience sampling was used
to select 103 patients, but only 72 patients were suitable for inclusion. Results: The survival analysis
for COVID-19 patients using the Kaplan Meier method showed that patients receiving Oseltamivir +
Hydroxychloroquine had an average survival rate of about 83% after undergoing treatment for about
ten days. Gender (p = 0.450) and age (p = 0.226) did not have a significant correlation with the
duration of treatment for COVID-19 patients. Gender (p = 0.174) and age (p = 0.065) also did not
have a significant correlation with clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients. Comorbidities showed a
significant correlation with duration of treatment (p = 0.002) and clinical outcome (p = 0.014) of
COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: The most effective antiviral agent in this study based on treatment
duration was the combination of Oseltamivir + Hydroxychloroquine.The higher the patient's average
treatment duration, the lower the average survival rate for COVID-19 patients.

INTRODUCTION
Coronaviruses (CoV) is a single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Coronaviridae
family. They spread between multiple hosts, clinically presenting with various symptoms,
from flu-like to severe, sometimes deadly respiratory infections (Drożdżal et al., 2020). The
new virus, which is responsible for this pandemic, was initially referred to as "2019-nCoV"
but has been renamed "SARS-CoV-2" by the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG). This body is
part of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. (ICTV), It is believed to be
familiar with SARS CoV, the pathogen that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(SARS). SARS-CoV-2 was recently closely related to SARS-CoV, sharing 80% identity in
the RNA sequence (Gorbale et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020).
With the first case in humans recorded in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 is responsible
for an outbreak of a respiratory disease called COVID-19 (Coronavirus Diseases 2019). The
full spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from mild self-limiting respiratory disorders to severe
progressive pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death (Huang et al., 2020). In the central
Chinese province of Hubei, Wuhan's city has been declared the pandemic epicenter, with the
Huanan seafood market being one of the first locations where SARS-CoV-2 could potentially
cross the species barrier at the animal-human interface. Initial research conducted in
Shenzhen, by a group of doctors and scientists from the University of Hong Kong, provided

the first evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from human to human (Chan et al.,
2020).
The Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in a study of 44,672
people (1,023 deaths) that cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, respiratory disease,
and cancer were associated with an increased risk of death (Deng et al., 2020). Advanced
age, the presence of comorbidities, especially hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and smoking,
are factors that increase the risk of severe disease presentation (Lippi et al., 2020). However,
the characteristics of COVID-19 may differ depending on the demographic and
epidemiological profile of each country (Drożdżal et al., 2020). In Indonesia, 51.9% of
confirmed cases are men, 31.4% of confirmed cases are aged between 31-45 years, with the
highest percentage of deaths between 46-59 years of age at 39.4% and 50.5% of confirmed
cases of having hypertension as a comorbid disease (Task Force COVID-19, 2020).
Assessing the instantaneous mortality rate at any time during follow-up for specific risk
factors is essential for determining the suitability of mitigation strategies and for setting
priorities for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. This is especially the case in countries
that are currently focusing their efforts on tackling a pandemic (Drożdżal et al., 2020).
The COVID-19 pandemic requires the rapid development of a useful therapeutic
strategy, in which three concepts are applied: (i) The first approach relies on testing is
currently known antiviral agents and verifying their clinical utility (Kim et al., 2016; Lu,
2020). (ii) Other modalities are based on molecular libraries and databases, enabling high
computing power and simultaneous verification of millions of potential agents (Lu, 2020;
Channappanavar et al., 2017). (iii) The third strategy involves targeted therapy, which is
intended to disrupt the viral genome and function. Properly particles designed to interfere
with important steps of viral infection, such as binding to cell surfaces and internalization.
Unfortunately, in vitro activity does not necessarily mean success in vivo testing, due to
different pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties (Lu, 2020; Zumla et al., 2016).
The main group of therapeutic agents that can be useful in the treatment of COVID-19
involves antiviral drugs, certain antibiotics, antimalarials, and immunotherapy drugs
(Drożdżal et al., 2020).

METHODS
Research Design
This research is descriptive, a study conducted to provide an accurate description or
description of a situation. The study design used a cohort design. A cohort study was
undertaken to support an association between suspected cause and disease, which was
measured prospectively. The reason researchers use prospective measurements is to get real
data and can avoid bias. The type of data collected is primary data in the form of medical
records.
Samples
Samples used in this study were patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were undergoing
treatment and receiving antiviral agent therapy. The inclusion and exclusion criteria in this
study are:
Inclusion criteria:
a. Patients demonstrated positive for COVID-19 are undergoing treatment at the
hospital.

Based on Table 1. it can be seen that based on gender, most of the patients were male,
as many as 45 people (62.5%). Data from the Task Force for the Acceleration of Handling
COVID-19 in Indonesia as of August 6, 2020, the number of male patients with confirmed
COVID-19 was 52.1% and women 47.9% (COVID-19 Task Force, 2020). There is no
consistent pattern in who is more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19. A confirmed
diagnosis means that laboratory tests have been carried out. In other words, globally, there is

almost the same number of cases between men and women. There is no evidence from this
national survey data that men are more likely to contract it than women (Global Health 50/50,
2020).
Based on age, most patients were in the 39-58 years age group, as many as 32 people
(44.4%), and the least number in the 79-85 years age group was 2 people (2.8%). Data from
the Task Force for the Acceleration of Handling COVID-19 in Indonesia as of August 6
2020, the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 patients was in the 31-45 year age group
as much as 31.4% (COVID-19 Task Force, 2020). In the 2020 Chinese study, the mean age
of COVID-19 patients was 56 years, ranged from 18-87 years, and most patients were male
(Zhou et al., 2020). Whereas in the study of Guan et al., the patients' mean age was 47 years,
and 41.9% of patients were women (Guan et al., 2020).
Sig value. Gender and age showed a value of> 0.05, which means that sex and age
had no effect on the length of treatment for COVID-19 patients. There are still few studies
investigating the duration of hospitalized COVID-19 patients during the pandemic. The mean
duration of stay due to COVID-19 has been reported in several studies in China as 10-13
days (Guan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). However, the length of stay depends on various
factors, such as the time elapsed from exposure to the onset of symptoms, and from the time
of onset to the time of hospital admission, as well as various factors related to the countryspecific context (Thai et al., 2020).

Based on Table 2. above, it is known that of the 45 male patients, most of them get
clinical outcomes, as many as 30 people (66, 7%), and 15 people (33.3%) died. Likewise,
most of the 27 people with female patients also received clinical outcomes, namely as many
as 22 people (81.5%) and 5 people (18.5%) died. Gender has no influence on the clinical
outcome of COVID-19 patients with P-value 0.174> 0.05.
Furthermore, it is known that out of 16 patients aged 19 - 38 years, most of them
received clinical outcomes, namely 14 people (87.5%), then from 32 patients aged 39 - 58
years, most of them received clinical outcomes, which were 23 people (71, 8%). Most of the
patients aged 59-78 years received clinical outcomes, as many as 15 people (59.1%) and the
two patients aged 79-85 all (100%) died. S value. Age has no influence on the clinical
outcome of COVID-19 patients with P-value 0.065> 0.05. So it can be concluded that
sociodemography does not affect the clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients.

Older age, higher SOFA scores, and d-dimers of more than 1 μg / mL are associated
with an increased likelihood of death (Zhou et al., 2020). In Chenstudy et al.'s, the number of
patients infected with COVID-19 was more male than female (Chen et al., 2020). MERSCoV and SARS-CoV were also found to infect more men than women (Badawi et al., 2016
and Channappanavar et al., 2017). The reduction in women's susceptibility to viral infections
can be attributed to the protection of the X chromosome and sexual hormones, which play an
essential role in innate and adaptive immunity (Jaillon et al., 2019). Chen et al. .showed that
SARS-CoV-2 was more likely to infect older adult men with chronic comorbidities due to the
weaker immune function of these patients (Chen et al., 2020).

Based on Table 3., it is known that of the seven patients who did not have
comorbidities, most of them underwent treatment ≤ 14 days, as many as six people ( 85.7%).
Another case with patients with comorbid pneumonia is that most of the ten people also
underwent treatment duration of more than14 days, as many as nine people (90.0%), while
patients who had comorbid pneumonia - degenerative diseases mostly underwent treatment
duration, less than 14 days as many as 35 people (63.6%). Comorbidities have a relationship
with the treatment length for COVID-19 patients with a P-value of 0.002 <0.05. Based on the
study of Wang et al., The median duration from first symptoms to dyspnea, hospital
admission, and ARDS was 5 days, 7 days and 8 days, respectively (Wang et al., 2020).

many as 35 people (63.6%) and the remaining 20 people (36.4%) died. Sig value shows a
value of 0.014 <0.05, which means that comorbidities have a relationship with the clinical
outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Several reports suggest that COVID-19 can cause severe, sometimes fatal pneumonia
(Wang et al., 2020 and Chen et al., 2020). Besides, about half of the patients infected with
SARS-CoV-2 had a chronic underlying disease, particularly cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes, similar to MERS-CoV (Badawi et al., 2020). The risk
of death at any time during follow-up was significantly higher in men, individuals in the
older age group, with chronic kidney disease, and people who were hospitalized (SalinasEscudero et al., 2020).
The Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in a study of 44,672
people (1,023 deaths) that cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, respiratory disease,
and cancer were associated with an increased risk of death (Deng et al., 2020). However,
correction for association with age is not possible (Williamson et al., 2020). A cross-sectional
survey in the UK of 16,749 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 showed that the risk of
death was higher in patients with heart, lung, and kidney disease, as well as cancer, dementia
and obesity (Docherty et al., 2020).

Based on Table 5. it can be seen that from 16 patients who received Oseltamivir
therapy Most of them got clinical outcomes cured, namely 13 people (81.3%). From 28
patients who received combination therapy of Oseltamivir + Chloroquine, 16 people (57.1%)
got clinical outcomes. Of the patients who received combination therapy of Oseltamivir +
Hydroxychloroquine, 4 (50%) received clinical outcomes, and 4 (50%) died. Of the 8 patients
who received the combination of Favipiravir + Chloroquine therapy, all (100%) had a clinical
outcome. Most of the patients who received combination therapy Favipiravir + Oseltamivir +
Chloroquine received clinical outcomes, as many as 11 people (91.67%). Sig value shows a
value of 0.025 <0.05, which means that COVID-19 Antiviral Agent Therapy has an influence
on the clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients.
The Indonesian Lung Doctors Association recommends Oseltamivir for the treatment
of COVID-19 because the drug is easily accessible in Indonesia and has been produced
domestically (Rossa, 2020). In a previous study, a combination of low-dose favipiravir with
Oseltamivir showed a synergistic response to influenza virus infection in white mice (Smee et
al., 2010). The results of a study led by the China Pneumonia Research Network prove that
favipiravir combined with Oseltamivir is better than Oseltamivir alone in the treatment of
severe influenza (Wang et al., 2019). Oseltamivir has also been used in clinical trials in
various combinations with Chloroquine and favipiravir, a nucleoside analogue known as a

broad-spectrum antiviral drug that has shown EC50 61.88 µM against SARS-CoV-2 and low
toxicity (CC50> 400 µM) (Cao et al. ., 2020).
To date, no specific treatment has been recommended for coronavirus infection except
for careful supportive care (de Wit et al., 2016). The approach taken for this disease is to
control the source of infection, use of personal protective precautions to reduce the risk of
transmission, and early diagnosis, isolation, and supportive care for infected patients.
Antibacterial agents are not sufficient. Besides, there are no antiviral agents that are useful for
treating SARS and MERS (Wang et al., 2020). All patients in the study received antibacterial
agents, 90% received antiviral therapy, and 45% received methylprednisolone. The doses of
Oseltamivir and methylprednisolone vary depending on the severity of the disease. However,
no significant results were observed (Wang et al., 2020).
Chloroquine (CQ) and its hydroxyl analog, Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), are weak
bases used as antimalarial agents for half a century. Apart from these antimalarial activities,
Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine have gained interest in other areas of infectious
diseases. For viruses, Chloroquine causes coating inhibition and/or changes in posttranslational modification of newly synthesized proteins, especially inhibition of
glycosylation (Rolain et al., 2020). Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine may also have
indirect antiviral effects. Chloroquine was found to be effective in preventing the spread of
coronavirus (CoV) associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in cell
culture by interfering with terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor, angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Vincent et al., 2005); and sialic acid, whose biosynthesis can
be inhibited by Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine, is a component of the SARS-CoV
receptor and orthomyxovirus (Savarino et al., 2006).
Research in China studied Chloroquine's effects in vitro, using Vero E6 cells infected
with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) 0.05. This study shows that
Chloroquine is very effective in reducing viral replication, with an Effective Concentration
(EC) of 90 of 6.90 μM, which can be easily achieved with standard doses, due to its good
penetration in tissues, including in the lungs. Chloroquine is known to block viral infection
by increasing endosomal pH and by interfering with the glycosylation of SARS-CoV cellular
receptors. The authors also speculate that a known immunomodulatory effect of the drug
might enhance the in vivo antiviral effect (Wang et al., 2020).
Oseltamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor approved for influenza treatment; there is no
documented in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 (Sanders et al., 2020). The COVID-19
outbreak in China initially occurred during the peak influenza season, so most patients
received empiric oseltamivir therapy until SARS-CoV-2 discovered the cause of COVID-19
(Wang et al., 2020). Several clinical trials are currently including Oseltamivir in the
comparison arm but not as a proposed therapeutic intervention (ClinicalTrialsgov, 2020).
Favipiravir, formerly known as T-705, is a drug from the purine nucleotide group,
favipiravir ribofuranosyl-5′-triphosphate. The active agent inhibits RNA polymerase,
stopping viral replication. Most of the favipiravir's preclinical data come from influenza and
Ebola activity. However, these agents have also demonstrated broad activity against other
RNA viruses (Furuta et al., 2017). In vitro, EC50 favipiravir against SARS-CoV-2 was 61.88
μM/L in Vero E6 cells (Cao et al., 2020). Favipiravir first enters infected cells through
endocytosis and is then converted to active ribofuranosyl phosphate favipiravir through
phosphoryibosylation and phosphorylation (Furuta et al., 2017). Antiviral activity selectively
targets the conservative catalytic domain of RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) which
can inhibit RNA polymerization activity, disrupting the nucleotide incorporation process of
Curr Pharmacol Rep during viral RNA replication (Furuta et al., 2017). Dysregulation in
viral RNA replication results in an increase in the number and frequency of transition
mutations, including replacement of guanine (G) by adenine (A) and cytosine (C) by thymine

(T) or C by Uracil (U), which induces lethal mutagenesis in viral RNA (Furuta et al. al.,
2017). Randomized controlled trials have shown that COVID-19 patients receiving
favipiravir therapy had a higher recovery rate (71.43%) than those treated with umifenovir
(55.86%), and significantly more duration of fever and cough relief,shorter in the favipiravir
group than in the umifenovir group (Chen et al., 2020).

Survival Analysis Among COVID-19 Patients
Figure 1. Survival Analysis with Kaplan Meier Methods

Based on Figure 1. above, it can be seen that patients who received combination therapy of
Oseltamivir + Hydroxychloroquine had an average survival rate of about 83% after
undergoing treatment for about ten days. Patients receiving Oseltamivir therapy had an
average survival rate of about 18% after about 27 days of treatment. Patients receiving the
combination Oseltamivir + Chloroquine therapy had an average survival rate of about 17%
after about 23 days of treatment. Patients who received combination therapy Favipiravir +
Chloroquine had an average survival rate of about 17% after about 31 days of treatment.
Meanwhile, patients who received combination therapy Favipiravir + Oseltamivir +
Chloroquine had an average survival rate of about 10% after undergoing treatment for about
39 days.
A significant association was found among the overall comparisons between the
analysis of survival and length of hospitalization of COVID-19 patients. In a study conducted
by Thai et al., It was shown that the mean duration of hospital stay was 21 (IQR: 16-34)
days. The multivariable Cox regression model shows that age, place of residence, and
contamination source are significantly associated with longer duration of stay (Thai et al.,
2020).
In Wang, Z, et al., The mean length of stay in the hospital was 19 days (IQR: 14-23, range: 341). Adjusted multivariate analysis showed that longer length of stay was associated with a
factor of age 45 and over; who is admitted to a provincial hospital; and those who are

CONCLUSION
The most widely used antiviral agent therapy for patients with confirmed COVID-19
was the combination of Oseltamivir + Chloroquine in 28 patients (38.9%). Based on the ChiSquare test, it was found that there was a significant relationship between COVID-19
antiviral agent therapy and the clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients (p = 0.025). The
antiviral agent therapy that was rated the most effective based on the length of treatment was
the combination of Oseltamivir + Hydroxychloroquine which had the highest survival rate at
around 83% after undergoing treatment for about 10 days (p = 0.027). The number of
COVID-19 patients who died was 20 people (27.8%), while 52 people recovered (72.2%).
Based on gender, most of the patients were male, as many as 45 people (62.5%), and
by age, most patients were in the 39-58 years age group as many as 32 people (44.4%). In the
Chi-Square test, it was found that there was no significant effect between gender (p = 0.450)
and age (p = 0.226) on the length of treatment for COVID-19 patients. Based on the ChiSquare test, there was no significant effect between gender (p = 0.174) and age (p = 0.065) on
the clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Most patients had comorbidities with pneumonia-degenerative diseases, as many as
55 people (76.4%). The Chi-Square test showed a significant relationship between the types
of comorbidities and the length of treatment for COVID-19 patients (p = 0.002). Based on the
Chi-Square test, there was a significant relationship between the types of comorbidities and
the clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients (p = 0.014).
LIMITATION
The limitations that occur in this study are the relatively short research time; the
extraordinary volume and speed of published literature on the treatment of COVID-19 means
that research findings and recommendations continue to evolve as new evidence emerges;
and treatment data published to date have come exclusively from observational data or small
clinical trials (none of which had more than 250 patients), which presented a higher risk of
bias or inaccuracy concerning large treatment effect sizes.
