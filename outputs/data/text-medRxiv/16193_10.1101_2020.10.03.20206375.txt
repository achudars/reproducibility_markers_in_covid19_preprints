ABSTRACT

Background: Early observational studies suggested that the use of the renin angiotensin
system (RAS) inhibitors, specifically angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin
receptor blockers, may increase the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and adversely affect
the prognosis or survival of infected patients. To explore the impact of RAS inhibitor use on
the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, from
all published studies.
Methods and Findings: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the use of RAS inhibitors
in relation to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and/or the severity and mortality associated with
COVID-19 was conducted. English language bibliographic databases PubMed, Web of
Science, OVID Embase, Scopus, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, searched from Jan 1st, 2020 to July 20th,
2020. 58 observational studies (69,200 COVID-19 patients and 3,103,335 controls) were
included. There was no difference in the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection between
RAS inhibitor users and non-users (unadjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.21), (adjusted OR
0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.02), (adjusted HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.31). There was no
significant difference in the severe Covid-19 case rate between RAS inhibitor users and
non-users (unadjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.36), (adjusted OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.52 to
1.12), or in mortality due to COVID-19 between RAS inhibitor users and non-users
(unadjusted OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.44), (adjusted OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23),
(adjusted HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.14).
Conclusions: In the most comprehensive analysis of all available data to date, treatment with
RAS inhibitors was not associated with increased risk of infection, severity of disease, or

Introduction
Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the observation that angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) was the binding site through which SARS-CoV-2 gained cellular entry1,
prompted much speculation about the safety of renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors,
such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker
(ARBs). This concern arose because previous studies had suggested that RAS inhibitors may
lead to increased ACE2 expression on the cell surface2, and it was assumed that this might
increase the susceptibility of patients using these medications to SARS-CoV-2 infection and
when infected, increase the risk of an adverse outcome from COVID-19.
RAS inhibitors are widely used to treat patients with hypertension, heart failure, chronic
kidney disease and diabetes, all of which are co-morbidities associated with more severe
disease and a worse outcome from COVID-19. These concerns led to many patients at risk of
severe COVID-19 infection due to these co-morbidities, to discontinue their treatment with
RAS inhibitors. This prompted several professional medical and scientific societies to caution
against withdrawing RAS inhibitors therapy, whilst acknowledging that more data was
needed.3 Other commentators suggested a pragmatic solution to continue ACEi or ARBs in
patients at highest short term cardiovascular risk but consider stopping these treatments in the
majority of patients at lower CVD risk, if they tested positive for Covid-19.4
Subsequently, a series of impressive observational and case-controlled studies rapidly
emerged that have provided some reassurance about the safety of RAS inhibitors in the
context of COVID-19 infection. However, the studies vary in size and region and no
individual study has been able to address all of the key questions about the potential impact of

RAS inhibitors on the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the severity of infection and
risk of mortality. Moreover, questions have remained about the impact of hypertension per se
on the risk of COVID-19 and the impact of RAS inhibitors in this large cohort of patients. We
therefore undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of all existing clinical data to
provide the most definitive report to date on the association between RAS inhibitors and the
susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection (18 studies), the severity of the resulting disease (29
studies) and mortality (30 studies) due to COVID-19.

Methods
This meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Protocols (PRISMA) 5 and the Meta-analysis of
Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines (MOOSE).6

Eligibility criteria, search strategy and study selection

We performed a systematic literature search for studies of any design and in any setting in
electronic bibliographic databases including PubMed, Web of Science, OVID Embase, and
Scopus from Jan 1st, 2020 to July 20th, 2020, using a comprehensive search strategy as
described in eAppendix 1 in the Supplement. We also manually searched preprint platforms
(MedRxiv and BioRxiv), coronavirus resource centers of N Engl J Med, JAMA, BMJ and the
Lancet, and checked reference lists of eligible studies to find additional studies. We limited
our search by language (English). Since COVID-19 topic was a novel disease, any study that
reported the associations of the susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and severity and

mortality of COVID-19 with the use of RAS inhibitors was eligible. Two authors (S.Y. and
Y.Z.) independently screened and examined eligible studies. Disagreements were resolved by
consensus.

Outcomes

There were three outcomes of interest; (i) susceptibility to infection with SARS-Cov-2; (ii)
the severity of COVID-19 infection; and (iii) mortality from COVID-19. Cases of COVID-19
were defined as those with a positive test result from a real-time
reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasopharyngeal swab
samples. Definitions of disease severity of COVID-19 varied among studies (eTable 4 in the
Supplement) and it was not feasible to provide a single consistent definition. Most studies
from China used the National Health Commission of China guideline, which categorized
patients into four types of severity (mild, common, severe, and critical). In these Chinese
studies, severe and critical were classified as severe cases and mild and common as
non-severe cases. The other studies defined severe cases as admission to an ICU and/or death
and/or long hospitalization (eTable 4 in the Supplement). We pooled the result across all
included studies based on different definitions of severity and performed subgroup analyses
according to the countries of origin (China and Non-China).

Data extraction and risk of bias

Two reviewers (S.Y. and Y.Z.) independently extracted study data and evaluated studies for
risk of bias. The following information was extracted from each study: study identifier, study
design, country, study size, mean/median age, male sex proportion, quantitative outcomes,

effect estimators (Odds ratios [ORs] or Hazard ratios [HRs]) and adjusted covariates if
available. The comparison of outcomes comparing ACEi or ARB treatment with non-ACEi or
ARB treatment was our primary interest, but several included studies reported data for ACEi
and ARB separately. For those studies, we used the additional data for ACEi and ARB to
calculate the corresponding data for ACEi or ARB as a single entity, which was a reasonable
approach considering the very small possibility of combined use of ACEi and ARB in clinical
practice.
Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS)7 was used to evaluate the risk of bias (or quality) of each
observational study. NOS was calculated according to three major components: selection (0-4
points), comparability (0-2 points) and outcome (0-3 points). A total score of 7 or more was
considered as low risk of bias. We planned to use the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool to evaluate
the risk of bias in any randomized clinical trials (RCTs), but only one retrospective interim
analysis of an unfinished RCT study was identified for this meta-analysis which was treated
as a cohort study and evaluated with NOS.

Statistical analysis

The primary analysis estimated the associations of susceptibility to infection with
SARS-Cov-2 and the severity and mortality from COVID-19 with the use of ACEi or ARB.
Pooled unadjusted ORs were calculated with the Mantel-Haenszel method with a
random-effects or fixed-effects model (wherever appropriate), pooled adjusted ORs were
calculated with the generic inverse variance method with a random-effects or fixed-effects
model. In terms of mortality, some studies reported ORs, others reported HRs, thus we pooled

ORs and HRs separately. We performed a series of subgroup analyses in hypertensive patients,
Chinese/non-Chinese, case-controlled studies, and non-severe and severe patients, wherever
data was available for the three outcomes of interest. Additionally, we calculated the pooled
estimates for outcomes with ACEi and ARB separately.
Inter-study heterogeneity was assessed with the χ2 based-Q-statistic test and I2 statistic. I2 <
25%, 25%-50% and >50% suggested low, moderate, and high heterogeneity, respectively. We
examined the potential publication bias using Funnel plots and Egger’s test. Leave-one-out
sensitivity analyses were applied to evaluate the robustness of our findings after excluding
each included study on the pooled results. All statistical analyses were conducted using
Reviewer Manager 5.3 (The Nordic Cochrane Center, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2018,
Copenhagen, Denmark) and STATA version 12.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX).

Patients and Public Involvement:
This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of previously published data and there was no
involvement of patients or the public in this study.

Results
The search strategy identified 536 published articles from the PubMed, 600 from the Web of
Science, 424 from the OVID Embase and 390 from the Scopus, and 24 electronically
published articles from the preprint platforms (Figure 1). After duplication and eligibility
screening, 81 articles remained. 23 articles were further omitted because of unrelated topic,
unavailable or overlapping data, ineligible design, or journal retraction. A total of 58 studies

were included in the final meta-analysis, 18 provided susceptibility data (7 with adjusted ORs
and 3 with adjusted HRs), 29 provided disease severity data (13 with adjusted OR and 1 with
adjusted HRs), and 30 provided mortality data (8 with adjusted ORs and 3 with adjusted
HRs).
The Table describes the cohort characteristics of the included studies. Our analysis comprised
69,200 COVID-19 patients and 3,103,335 controls from 58 studies (35 published in journals
and 23 available as preprints via MedRxiv). Since not all studies provided three major
outcomes of interest i.e. susceptibility to infection, disease severity and mortality, we collated
the studies into 3 groups, according to the availability of data for the three major outcomes
(Table).
Use of RAS inhibitors and susceptibility to infection with SARS-Cov-2
Eighteen studies (3,128,679 participants) were included in the susceptibility analysis, of
which 7 reported adjusted ORs and 3 reported adjusted HRs. The adjustment strategies for
individual studies are listed in the Table. There was no significant difference in the incidence
of COVID-19 infection between RAS inhibitor users and non-users, before and after
adjustment (unadjusted OR 1.05, 0.90 to 1.21; adjusted OR 0.93, 0.85 to 1.02; adjusted HR
1.07, 0.87 to 1.31; Figure 2.)
Use of RAS inhibitors and the severity of COVID-19
We assessed the Covid-19 case severity from 29 studies, including 18,959 COVID-19 patients,
of which 3840 were severe cases (20.3%). Adjusted ORs were reported for 13 studies and
adjusted HRs were reported for 1 study. The definitions of severe COVID-19 are listed in
eTable 4 in the Supplement. There was no significant difference in severe case rate between

RAS inhibitor users and non-users before (OR 1.05, 0.81 to 1.36) and after adjustment for
confounders (OR 0.76, 0.52 to 1.12), especially age and gender (Figure 3).
Use of RAS inhibitors and mortality from COVID-19
30 studies were included in the unadjusted analysis and 11 studies in the adjusted analysis of
mortality from COVID-19 (8 with adjusted ORs and 3 with adjusted HRs). In 33,441
COVID-19 patients, 4234 deaths (12.7%) occurred. There was no significant difference in the
mortality between RAS inhibitor users and non-users before (OR 1.12, 0.88 to 1.44) and after
adjustment for age, gender and other covariates (OR 0.97, 0.77 to 1.23, Figure 4). Three
studies reported adjusted HRs, for which the pooled HR showed no difference in mortality in
RAS inhibitor users when compared with non-users in COVID-19 patients (HR 0.62, 0.34 to
1.14).

Subgroup analyses:
1. A comparison of the association of ACEi versus ARB with susceptibility and severity
of COVID-19
When ACEi and ARB were analyzed separately (eFigures 1 and 2 in the Supplement), before
and after adjustment for confounders, there was no significant difference in the incidence of
COVID-19 infection between ACEi users and non-users (unadjusted OR 0.94, 0.89 to 1.00
and adjusted OR 0.90, 0.79 to 1.04) or between ARB users and non-users (unadjusted OR
1.05, 1.00 to 1.11 and adjusted OR 1.12, 0.96 to 1.32). There was also no difference in the
severe case rate between ACEi users and non-users (OR 0.93, 0.59 to 1.48), or between ARB
users and non-users (OR 0.91, 0.71 to 1.17, eFigure 3 in the Supplement). When COVID-19

disease severity was subdivided into mild-to-moderate or severe cases, with 2 studies
reporting data after adjustment, and using non-COVID-19 subjects as reference, (eFigure 4 in
the Supplement), ACEi use was not associated with increased mild-to-moderate case severity
(OR 0.97, 0.88 to 1.06), or severe case severity (OR 0.82, 0.67 to 1.01) and neither was ARB
use associated with increased mild-to-moderate case severity (OR 0.96, 0.88 to 1.06) or
severe case severity (OR 1.01, 0.67 to 1.50).
2. Impact of RAS inhibitor use in patients with hypertension on susceptibility to
Covid-19 and disease severity
In the susceptibility analysis without adjustment, 4 studies reported data specifically in
hypertensive patients (eFigure 5 in the Supplement). There was no difference in the incidence
of COVID-19 infection between RAS inhibitor users and non-users (OR 1.13, 0.80 to 1.61) in
patients with hypertension. Similar findings were observed after adjustment (OR 0.87, 0.73 to
1.04, eFigure 6 in the Supplement).
Seventeen studies reported unadjusted data on disease severity in hypertensive COVID-19
patients and there was no difference in the severe case rate between RAS inhibitor users and
non-users (OR 0.82, 0.63 to 1.06). Similarly, in 6 studies that reported adjusted ORs, there
was also no significant difference after adjustment, with a OR 0.64 (0.40 to 1.02) (eFigure 6
in the Supplement).
Ten studies reported mortality in hypertensive COVID-19 patients and there was no
difference in mortality between RAS inhibitor users and non-users before (OR 0.83, 0.60 to
1.13, eFigure 5 in the Supplement) and after adjustment (OR 0.93, 0.61 to 1.42 and HR 0.61,
0.33 to 1.12, eFigure 6 in the Supplement)

3. Association of susceptibility of COVID-19 with use of RAS inhibitors in
case-controlled studies
Eight case-controlled studies and eleven retrospective cohort studies reported the
susceptibility data without adjustment, which showed no difference in the incidence of
COVID-19 infection between RAS inhibitor users and non-users, with OR 0.95, 0.78 to 1.15
and OR 1.14, 0.90 to 1.43, respectively, eFigure 7 in the Supplement).
4. Association of severity of COVID-19 with use of RAS inhibitors in Chinese and
non-Chinese cohort
There were 12 studies reporting the severity data in Chinese cohorts without adjustment
(eFigure 8 in the Supplement), which showed no difference in the incidence of severe case
rate between Chinese RAS inhibitor users and non-users before (OR 0.79, 0.57 to 1.09,
eFigure 8 in the Supplement) and after adjustment (OR 0.54, 0.23 to 1.26, eFigure 9 in the
Supplement). In 14 studies in the non-Chinese cohorts, RAS inhibitor users had a higher
severity rate than non-users before adjustment for confounders (OR 1.41, 1.02 to 1.96,
eFigure 8 in the Supplement), but after adjustment, the associations were not significant (OR
0.80, 0.53 to 1.20, eFigure 9 in the Supplement).
5. Association of susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 with hypertension status
After adjustment for confounders, hypertension was not associated with the increased
susceptibility to COVID-19 (OR 1.09, 0.95 to 1.25). Hypertension was significantly
associated with the increased Covid-19 severity rate (OR 1.44, 1.10 to 1.89) and increased
mortality after adjustment (HR 2.14, 1.46 to 3.14; eFigure 10 in the Supplement). However,
when we included recently published UK national data (n=17,278,392) which focused on the

association between co-morbidities (including hypertension) and COVID-19 mortality but
without RAS inhibitors data8, there was no significant association between hypertension and
COVID-19 mortality, with a HR 1.53, 0.78 to 2.99 (eFigure 10 in the Supplement).
Sensitivity Analyses and Risk of Bias
The main outcomes of this meta-analysis remained unaltered in the sensitivity analysis by
excluding each individual study. Considering the retrospective and observational setting for
all of these studies, the risk of bias was high (eTables 1-3 in the Supplement) and the I2 values
were large in some pooled analyses. However, Funnel plots and Egger’s test indicated that
there was no substantial publication bias (eFigures 11-13 in the Supplement).

Discussion
In this systematic review and meta-analysis of observational and case-controlled studies, the
use of RAS inhibitors was not associated with increased susceptibility to infection with
SARS-CoV-2 and was not associated with increased risk of severe disease or mortality from
COVID-19. Moreover, when ACEi or ARB were analyzed separately versus non-users of
these drugs, there was no evidence that either treatment’s association with susceptibility,
severe disease or death from COVID-19 was different from the other when compared to
non-users. Similar results were obtained when specifically examining RAS inhibitor users
versus non-use in people with hypertension, or when comparing Chinese and non-Chinese
patient cohorts and when the analysis was restricted to case-controlled studies.
Due to the fact that the earliest studies characterizing co-morbidities most likely to be
associated with poor outcomes from COVID-19, cited pre-existing hypertension as one of the

most important,9 we also examined whether hypertension was independently associated with
increased susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and increased risk of severe disease or
mortality in those infected. Mindful of how common hypertension is and its strong association
with ageing, we had concerns that the Covid-19 risk associated with hypertension might have
been exaggerated because the earliest reports had not been adjusted for potential confounding,
especially age, the latter being a potent risk factor for death from COVID-19.8 Thus, it was
important to examine the association between COVID-19 and hypertension independent of
age, other demographics, and comorbidities. Our pooled studies with available data on
hypertension (6 studies for susceptibility) showed no significant independent association
between hypertension and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, we did find a
significant association between hypertension and case severity and mortality from Covid-19.
Subsequently, we incorporated a new analysis by Williamson et al8, of the relationship
between patient demographics and comorbidities (including hypertension) and Covid-19
mortality in 17 million people in the UK. The addition of this data to our analysis, attenuated
the association between hypertension and mortality, however, the pooled results still revealed
a trend towards an approximately 50% increased probability of an adverse outcome in
patients with hypertension, although the corresponding confidence interval crossed the
reference line. Interestingly, the report of Williamson et al8, reveals the complexity and the
importance of confounding in the relationships between hypertension and Covid-19 outcomes.
Notably that much of the risk association between hypertension and Covid-19 outcomes could
be accounted for by age, diabetes and obesity, which are all independent risk factors for
poorer outcomes and are commonly associated with hypertension. There was also an

intriguing interaction between age and hypertension whereby hypertension was associated
with increased risk of an adverse outcome from Covid-19 up to the age of 70 years but
reduced risk beyond 70 years of age. This illustrates the complexity of interpreting
associations for common comorbidities when there is often complex or unmeasured residual
confounding from the many cardiac, vascular and metabolic comorbidities associated with
hypertension., rather than attributing risk to an elevated blood pressure per se.
Although often considered similar in their RAS inhibiting effects, ACEi and ARBs block the
RAS pathway at different levels which could theoretically differentially influence the level
and activity of ACE2, the availability of angiotensin II at the AT-2 receptor and the
angiotensin II cleavage product, angiotensin 1-7. Hypotheses have been presented to explain
how these differential effects of ACEi and ARBs could influence the susceptibility to
SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or severity and mortality from COVID-19. For the purposes of
our analysis, many studies reported results with ACEi and ARB separately and we found that
the pooled results of either ACEi or ARB showed no association with COVID-19 for any
outcomes of interest. One study directly compared the effects of ACEi and ARB on mortality
from COVID-19. By comparing 124 COVID-19 patients taking ACEi with 248 matched
patients taking ARB, no significant difference in 28-day all-cause mortality were found
between groups.10 Our findings suggest that there neither RAS-inhibition overall, or ACEi or
ARB treatment individually are associated with increased risk from COVID-19.
The concept that ACEi or ARB might increase the risk of infection or severity of COVID-19
arose from the observation that ACE2 is the binding site that facilitates the cellular entry of
SARS-CoV-2. This led to speculation that treatment with RAS inhibitor drugs might increase

the cellular expression of ACE2 and thereby increase the risk of infection and severity of
disease. This speculation cited previous experimental studies that had shown that RAS
inhibitor could increase the expression of ACE2 in heart and kidney2, however, there was no
data on the effect of RAS inhibitors on lung ACE2 expression in either animals or human.
Moreover, the concept that RAS inhibitors increases ACE2 expression is now being contested.
A recent study, Sama et al.11 showed that use of an ACEi or an ARB was not associated with
higher plasma ACE2 concentrations. Whilst circulating ACE2 may not be a good indicator of
tissue ACE2 levels, other recent evidence suggests that there is increasing expression of
ACE2 with age in both human lungs and kidney but no association between the expression of
ACE2 with either hypertension or RAS inhibiting drugs.12 Thus, the hypothesis that RAS
inhibitors could increase risk from COVID-19 by increasing ACE2 expression is unsupported
by the limited pathophysiological data available, or the more extensive clinical data from the
cohort studies of patients included in this meta-analysis. This in turn, reinforces the
recommendations made by medical societies, for patients to continue with their RAS inhibitor
medications throughout this COVID-19 pandemic. 3
The present finding needs to be interpreted, mindful of the limitations of observational cohort
studies. It is noteworthy that in most analyses, there is substantial risk of bias indicated by the
high I2 value in both main and subgroup analyses. This was mainly attributable to the inherent
weakness of observational studies and the inevitable possibility of confounding. The
association of various outcomes or with prior pharmaceutical treatments are commonly
influenced by numerous confounders, especially the indication for treatment, which often
varies according to comorbidities. The fact that RAS inhibitor medications are recommended

as a foundation treatment for hypertension or many of the comorbidities associated with
increased risk of mortality from COVID-19, i.e. diabetes, cardiac disease and chronic kidney
disease, and the fact that all of these conditions are more common with advancing age,
highlights the obvious potential for confounding in the relationship between RAS inhibitor
use and adverse outcomes from COVID-19. These confounding can only really be overcome
by randomized allocations to treatments in controlled trials and such trials are ongoing.13
Conclusions
In this systematic review and meta-analysis of all existing clinical data during the Covid-19
pandemic, we found that treatment with RAS inhibitors, specifically ACEi or ARBs, was not
associated with increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2, or increased risk for the
development of severe disease, or mortality from COVID-19, when compared to non-users of
RAS inhibition. Our study suggests that ACEi or ARBs should not be discontinued solely on
the basis of concerns about potential risks associated with COVID-19.
