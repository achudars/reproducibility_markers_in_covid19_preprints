ABSTRACT. Vaccine is the only way out towards an effective action against
Covid-19. Nevertheless, for many underdeveloped countries, ordinary people's
access will occur late within or even after the second disease wave. In this
context, strategies implemented by social communities allied to the scientific
knowledge may attenuate the rapid spread of cases and allow access of
treatments at health care services to the population. Here, we present results of
coordinate actions combining the aerosol SARS-Cov-2 virus monitoring and
sanitization at Santa Marta slum in Rio de Janeiro city, where profits were
significantly achieved.

Around 13.6 million people, which represents 6% of the population, live in
slums or similar agglomeration households in Brazil, according to the latest
official 2019 census by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics
(IBGE). More than 13 thousand slums were identified throughout Brazil, in 734
of the 5,570 Brazilian municipalities. According to the World Health
Organization (WHO), 1 billion people live in such conditions worldwide. It is
estimated that nearly 89% of people living in slums are concentrated in Brazil's
capitals and metropolitan regions. In these places, health is impacted by factors
arising from the shared physical and social environment, despite poverty alone.
One of these factors is the sewage treatment network that currently left
attended 43% of the Brazilian cities' population. In the north of the country, this
number climbs to 90%. Among the diseases of highest incidence associated
with this lack of sewage treatment network are leptospirosis, schistosomiasis,
parasitoids, and worsening of epidemics dengue, chikungunya, and zika.
Presently, in several countries of Europe, USA, Australia, and Brazil (1-5), one
important finding related to the environmental issue of the Covid-19 pandemic is
the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in sewage samples. Diarrhea has been
described as a symptom of Covid-19 disease, and human excreta may contain
important viral loads derived by infected people. Additionally, most SARS-CoV2 carriers exhibit none or mild non-specific symptoms, and therefore they
represent a group of mostly silent contributors to the virus's environmental
release.
In Brazil, especially in the City of Rio de Janeiro, slums were historically
established and enlarged on the slopes of hills, following the urban landscapes'
complex geomorphology. This population comprises 1.3 million people living in
poor households in several areas controlled by drug dealers with an evident
absence of public power. In between agglomeration of houses, we find open
sky sewage ditches spread at each corner. The sewage discharged on the
inclined plane of the slums passages produces turbulence in the water flow
resulting in the production of sprays (a cloud of droplets containing every kind of
organic matter particle). In this condition, sewage droplets microparticles are
launched and dispersed in the slum's atmosphere, reaching the inside of homes
(where people do not use masks) and encompassing the walkways passersby
use daily, where kids play and do their social life.

Several studies have been investigating the viral loads at urban sewages
of most developed countries. It is conducted as a strategy to monitor infected
populations or act as an alarm to trigger sanitization actions. In these developed
countries, people do not have direct contact with the sewage treatment network,
which configures the opposite situation of several slums in underdeveloped
countries. In addition to that, very narrow alleys existing in slums impose
permanent agglomeration of their inhabitants, and therefore it is argued that
Covid-19 dissemination would develop faster. In Brazil, during the Covid-19
pandemic, governmental actions were basically devoted to the general
population with the unsatisfactory response what lead Brazil to be the second in
the world death by Covid-19 by the end of December 2020. Here we present a
case study where the voluntary social sanitization initiative broke that trend. It
was conducted at Santa Marta slum (population: 7,356 habs; density: 134,000
hab km-2) in the City of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In this context, under the absence
of governmental support, locals' social engagements became the main weapon
against Covid-19. Wearing appropriate clothing and using the cationic
surfactants quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), a team of volunteers
manually sprinkle the disinfectant in the slum atmosphere, floor, and surfaces
since these substances impact microbes cell walls and membranes after
contact. The daily observation shows that sanitization activity cannot be
considered as a merely cleaning procedure; it also creates in the community a
sense of self-preservation and motivation to the population to face the
adversities of the virus dispersion.
In parallel and aiming to investigate airborne contamination's potential
due to sewage spraying and living in agglomeration, we conducted atmospheric
samplings at slum alleys where sewage aerosolization and habitants' passage
are constant, Fig.1.

December 21 , 2020 (database from https://covidporcep.rio.br/). Higher densities were
observed in the bottom part of the slum where there is more transit of inhabitants and
lesser insolation and ventilation; (b) topography of Santa Marta slum.

For the air samplings, we used a set of field instrumentations appropriate
to virus collection that employed solid, liquid, and gelatinous substrates
(described in the Methods section), taking into account previous protocols
conducted at the City of Wuhan in China and other sites by the end of 2019
(6,7). Despite initial surveys in Brazil have reported SARS-CoV-2 detectability in
sewage around 41% (5) of attempts, the virus detection (away from any hospital
Center) in the free atmosphere is challenging. However, we were able to detect
the virus in the Santa Marta slum atmosphere during normal daily conditions,

SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the aerosol fraction between 0.25 and 0.5
µm (low virus load – Ct: 40). Droplets smaller than 5-10 µm, emitted by human
and sewage discharged tend to dehydrate fast enough to form droplet nuclei
that range within the airborne size category. These nuclei are easily transported
through air currents. In this fraction, virus particles may reach the interior of
homes (where people do not wear masks) in the breathable fraction and
therefore be able to be deposited as more profound as the bronchiolar lung
compartment according to several lung deposition models (8).
As illustrated in Fig. 3, along the year 2020, the Santa Marta slum
sanitization passed through different communitarian support stages. Along with
the first Covid-19 wave from April to August, sanitizations took place two times
in a week with great social engagement (100% activity), between September
and November activities halved (50% activity) and during December, a
combination of fatigue, relaxation of social distances and reduced, or lack, of
investments in the project, lead to a break down in the activities (0% activity). It

is also interesting to observe that the second wave of accumulated death
presented two peaks. The second one in early December coincided with the
official release of the discovery of the new variant of SARS-CoV-2, named
B.1.1.7 (9), which was first detected in Brazil in mid-December. Based on
England's available preliminary statistical data, it is estimated that the new
variant could be 50% to 74 % more transmissible. Comparing these stages with
the statistics of accumulated death for both locally and the Rio de Janeiro
municipality depicts a picture of high social engagement interference in lowering
death numbers. While the city of Rio de Janeiro was under a high number of
deaths and cases in May and June (first Covid-19 wave), mortality at Santa
Marta slum was maintained at very low levels (Fig. 3). Although death in Rio de
Janeiro city stabilized during August-September-October, death at Santa Marta
increased significantly 1 order of magnitude, reaching a peak when none social
action is under course.

To many underdeveloped countries, Covid-19 highlighted unsolved long
term sanitary problems. The sanitary issue enclosing the Covid-19 is part of a
problem that governments have been neglecting for decades or even centuries
in the countries. The Santa Marta case study exhibits evidence that sanitization,
and other social activities that accompany such activity, maybe a solution to
break contamination routes (not only for SARS-CoV-2 but many other viral
pathologies). A partial socio-epidemiological bulletin for Covid-19 specific for
slums ("favelas"), 01/2020, edited by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation/FIOCRUZ
(an institution from the Brazilian Ministry of Health), showed that Covid-19
lethality during the first wave in non-slum neighborhoods was estimated to be
9,23% until June 2020, while the neighborhoods with high slum concentrations

this value climbed to 16,43 to 19,47%. Our results and observations show that
top to down governmental rules to the population in underdeveloped counties
may not be enough against the Covid-19 breakout as occurs in developed
countries, and mortality can only be reduced with the additional aid of social
engagements that daily implement basic actions.
Methods
1. Aerosol sampling
1.1. One Stage Bioaerosol Impactor, Model N6 (also known as "Andersen
head"). This instrumentation allows the collection of viable viruses and
microorganisms in general in the air (10). Bioaerosols were collected in sizes
ranging from 0.6 to 22 µm and deposited in a standard Petri dish containing
agar.
1.2. "BioSampler" (or bioflask), this sampler consists of a flask subdivided
into three compartments: collector spout, the central part of "microorganism
trapping," and air outlet (11). The collector nozzle is a moving part that functions
as an "inlet" through which atmospheric air passes. This compartment is fitted
over a central part, which contains tangential nozzles designed to form a vortex
inside the sampler itself. A liquid solution (e.g., glycerol) is placed in this
compartment where viruses and microorganisms can be fixed.

1.3. MAS100 sampler, this sampler uses the same principle as the Andersen
sampler. It is a compact and integrated suction system in which air is forced
through a flat cover with 400 equally spaced holes, which acts as an "inlet" (12).
The diameter of each hole is 0.7 mm. Just below the holes, a Petri dish
containing a solid culture medium (e.g., agar) is arranged so that the
bioaerosols captured by the suction of the air directly impact the surface of the
medium that holds them.

1.4. Cascade Impactor, is a selective instrumentation for airborne particles. It
collects particles according to their aerodynamic diameter. In this work, we used
a PIXE impactor that allowed discriminate bioaerosols according to the following
fractions under a constant airflow of 1.5 Lpm for 24 hours of integration: 16 µm

to 8 µm; 8 µm to 4 µm; 4 µm to 2 µm; 2 µm to 1 µm; 1 µm to 0,5 µm; 0,5 µm to
0,25 µm; 0,25 µm to 0,12 µm; 0,12 µm to 0,06 µm and < 0,06 µm.
2. Molecular analysis. The samples collected in PTFE, agar, and glycerol
filters containing aerosol were transported in cryotubes and refrigerated to
laboratory conditions. 2 mL of saline solution was added to each cryotubes and
left for 30 min for absorption. After that period, the samples were mixed by
vortexing for 1 min to prepare the extraction. The extraction of the material was
carried out with the commercial Bio-Gene kit to extract viral nucleic acid by the
silica membrane method. After the extraction process, reverse transcription,
amplification, and detection of the Coronavirus viral RNA were performed with
the molecular kit for SARS-Cov2 (E) - Bio-Manguinhos according to the Berlin
protocol. RT-PCR was performed with primers and probes directed to the E and
RP genes. The result was considered valid only when the cycle threshold (Ct)
value of the reference gene E was ≤ 40.
