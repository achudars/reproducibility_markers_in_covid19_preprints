Abstract
Objective Severity of the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has been previously reported in
terms of absolute mortality in SARS-CoV-2 positive cohorts. An assessment of mortality relative
to mortality in the general population is presented.
Design Retrospective population-based study.
Setting Individual information on symptomatic confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients and subsequent
deaths from any cause were compared to the all-cause mortality in the Swiss population of 2018.
Starting February 23, 2020, mortality in covid-19 patients was monitored for 80 days and compared to the population mortality observed in the same time-of-year starting February 23, 2018.
Participants 5 169 071 inhabitants of Switzerland aged 35 to 95 without covid-19 (general population in spring 2018) and 20 769 persons tested positively for covid-19 during the first wave in
spring 2020.
Measurements Sex- and age-specific mortality rates were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. Absolute probabilities of death were predicted and risk was assessed in terms of
relative mortality by taking the ratio between the sex- and age-specific absolute mortality in covid19 patients and the corresponding mortality in the 2018 general population.
Results Absolute mortalities increased with age and were higher for males compared to females,
both in the general population and in positively tested persons. A confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection substantially increased the probability of death across all patient groups at least nine-fold.
The highest relative risks were observed among males and younger patients. Male covid-19 patients exceeded the population hazard for males (hazard ratio 1.23, 1.03 to 1.47). An additional
year of age increased the population hazard in covid-19 patients only marginally (hazard ratio

1.01, 1.00 to 1.02).
Conclusions Health care professionals, decision makers, and societies are provided with an
additional population-adjusted assessment of covid-19 mortality risk. In combination with absolute measures of risk, the relative risks presented here help to develop a more comprehensive
understanding of the actual impact of covid-19.

Strengths and limitations of this study
• An assessment of covid-19 risk in terms of relative mortality rates comparing a cohort of
symptomatic and confirmed covid-19 patients to the general population is provided.

• Relative mortality for quantifying sex- and age-specific covid-19 risk is unaffected by seasonal effects, cause of death (covid-19 related or not), impact of public health interventions,
or testing coverage.

• The study excluded patients younger than 35 years and older than 95 years, as well as
patients tested posthumously or after having been admitted to a hospital for reasons other
than covid-19.

• Information about the distribution of relevant comorbidities was not available on population
level and the associated risk was not quantified.

• Differential covid-19 risk for relevant patient subpopulations, such as pregnant women, lowincome residents, ethnic or cultural minorities, was not assessed.

Introduction
Early reports from China and Italy 1–7 on disease severity of covid-19 caused unprecedented public health interventions around the world, ranging from social distancing measures or school and
university closings to complete lockdowns of societies. The absolute mortality in patients diagnosed with covid-19, i.e., the case-fatality rate, has been the main entity used for communicating
risks associated with the disease 2–6 . Risk factors for mortality risk, most prominently higher age,
being male, and preexisting medical conditions, have become publically known 1,3,4 .
On the current occasion of liberalisation of the most stringent public health interventions in many
countries, an assessment of the actual impact of the covid-19 pandemic is called-for. Health
care professionals, politicians, and societies at large currently engage in a discussion about
the appropriateness of the mitigation measures taken, and the first scientific contribution on the
matter has arisen 8 .
The probability of death estimated from hundreds of thousands of covid-19 patients are constantly reported from many countries 2–4,9 . These numbers can, however, be hard to compare,
due to differences in testing regimes, varying ascertainment of mortality, different age structures
of societies, or different health-care and public health systems 10 . As an alternative risk difference
of disease impact, excess numbers of deaths has been reported for some populations, i.e., the
number of observed all-cause deaths during the time of the covid-19 pandemic (end of February
to mid-May 2020 in most European countries) minus the expected number of deaths in the given
population. Reports on the number of excess deaths observed since the onset of the pandemic
are available from Portugal 11 , Spain 12 , northern Italy 13,14 , various other European countries 15 ,
and the United States 16 . However, cross-country comparisons are again difficult, because the
success or failure of public health interventions and possible overruns of hospital capacities will
be reflected in the presence and magnitude of excess mortality 14 .
The emergence of mature data on the course of the covid-19 pandemic from many countries
allows its actual impact on societies and health-care systems to be discussed in light of the shortterm relative mortality. This relative risk compares the absolute all-cause mortality observed in
patients diagnosed with covid-19 during the spring 2020 outbreak with the absolute all-cause
mortality in the uninfected population of earlier years during the same calendar time of year.
The population mortality varies between females and males, and over attained age, with males
and older individuals experiencing a higher short-term risk of dying. How much of the increased
mortality reported for male and older covid-19 patients 1,4,6,7 can be attributed to the increase in
population mortality risk in general is an important question awaiting an answer. Furthermore,
sex- and age-specific relative covid-19 mortality allows a stratified assessment of risk-increase
caused by a SARS-CoV-2 infection 17 .
We report an assessment of age-adjusted relative covid-19 mortalities for females and males
based on an analysis of individual population level and covid-19 death records from Switzerland

covering the time between 2020-02-24 and 2020-05-14.

Methods
Study design and data sources
For this population-based study, Swiss general population data from 2014–2018, including individual death records, were obtained from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (Bundesamt für
Statistik). In addition, covid-19 surveillance reports from the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health
(Bundesamt für Gesundheit) on an unselected group of individuals tested positively for SARSCoV-2 during the first wave between 2020-02-24 and 2020-05-14 were available, also including
individual dates of tests and occurred deaths.
Official SARS-CoV-2 testing in Switzerland was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
only, based on lower and upper respiratory tract samples from symptomatic persons. Individuals
experiencing the following symptoms were eligible for testing 18 : cough, sore throat, muscle pain,
dyspnea (with or without fever), and acute anosmia or ageusia. Testing of asymptomatic persons
was only recommended to control local outbreaks in hospitals or nursing homes. A number of
hospitals started to test all patients admitted to the hospital at different time points regardless
of symptoms. Information of whether or not a person experienced symptoms during an infection
was not available for this analysis. All positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 test results were directly
reported to the Federal Office of Public Health, patients were followed-up subsequently, and all
positive cases were included in this analyis.

Study population
The study population consists of two cohorts. The first cohort consists of persons with a SARSCoV-2 positive PCR test between 35 and 95 years of age at time of testing. We excluded younger
covid-19 patients because no deaths were observed in this group. Individuals tested post-mortem
or after hospitalisation for other reasons were not included as the aim was to study relative mortality in a cohort of newly infected people who did not have a short-term increased mortality risk.
Very old persons (older than 95) years were also excluded for this reason. We refer to this cohort
as the “Swiss covid-19” cohort in the sequel. The second cohort was defined as all inhabitants of
Switzerland alive on February 23, 2018 aged 35 to 95 years.
Table 1 describes the selection process defining the study population. For an additional sensitivity
analysis, the Swiss 2014 to 2017 study populations were defined analogously.

Statistical analysis
Exploratory analyses were performed comparing the sex- and age distributions between the
Swiss population cohort and the Swiss covid-19 cohort. Absolute numbers and ratios were computed for females and males. In addition to mean ages (Table 2), nonparametric density estimates
of age stratified by sex were computed and compared between the two cohorts (Figure 2).
Mortality data was analysed using survival analysis. For the Swiss population cohort, follow-up
started on February 23, 2018, and ended at date of death or on date of administrative censoring
(May 14, 2018). The underlying time scale for all analyses was time since February 23, measured
in days. The Swiss covid-19 cohort was handled in two different ways. Throughout, follow-up
started on the day of the positive test and ended at time of death or on date of administrative
censoring (May 14, 2020). When estimating relative rates (contrasting to the general population),
the underlying time scale was time since February 23 (measured in days), using a delayed entry
approach. For predicting the probability of death, number of days since positive test was used as
the underlying time scale.
Sex- and age-specific hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated
using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model, allowing for separate baseline rates in the
Swiss covid-19 and Swiss 2018 population cohorts, with 65-year old females as reference. Sex
and age were modelled with main effects only for the Swiss 2018 cohort, whereas for the Swiss
covid-19 cohort, interaction effects between SARS-CoV-2 status and sex and age were included
to capture the additional mortality effects among the patients. P -values and 95% confidence
intervals for hazard ratios were adjusted for multiplicity (see Online Supplement).
To quantify the impact on mortality associated with a SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, the 60-day probability of death was predicted from the fitted model estimates, which captures deaths occurring
within 60 days of February 23 or positive test, for the Swiss 2018 population cohort and Swiss
covid-19 cohort, respectively. Using these probabilities, the sex-specific relative mortality (and
associated 95% confidence bands) was calculated by taking the ratio between the two, along
an age gradient between 35 and 95 years. The relative mortality incorporated uncertainty in the
Swiss covid-19 cohort only 19 .
The assumption of proportional hazards was assessed by fitting models allowing for time-varying
effects. Potential deviations from the linear age effect were assessed in a Cox model allowing
nonlinear effects of age. The main-effects only model was compared to a model including sex ×
age interactions. As a sensitivity analysis, all models were re-fitted using the Swiss 2014 to 2017

general populations as reference. Further details on the statistical analyses performed can be
found in the Online Supplement.
All analyses were performed in the R system for statistical computing 20 (version 4.0.2) with the
survival 21 and mlt 22,23 add-on packages and independently replicated in Stata 24 (version 16),
using the stpm2 25,26 and merlin 27 commands.

Results
The daily number of deaths observed during the 80-day study period (2020-02-24 to 2020-05-14)
in the Swiss covid-19 cohort increased rapidly from mid-March and peaked during the first days
of April, in both males and females (Figure 1). The numbers reduced to less than ten reported
deaths per day during the last week of the study period.
[Figure 1 about here.]
Characteristics of the Swiss covid-19 cohort, the Swiss 2018 population cohort, and the earlier
Swiss population cohorts (2014-2017) are presented in Table 2. The ratio of females to males
indicate that patients in the Swiss covid-19 cohort were more likely female. The mean age was
similar between the two cohorts, with SARS-CoV-2 positive patients being between one (females)
and up to three years (males) older than individuals in the Swiss population cohort. The similarity
was further observed when comparing the whole age distribution among females and males,
between cohorts (Figure 2). However, there was a slight over-representation of older people,
between 85 and 95 years of age, in SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals.
[Table 2 about here.]
[Figure 2 about here.]
The all-cause mortality rate among 65-year old males from the Swiss 2018 population cohort was

1.46 times that among females of the same age. The mortality rate further increased by a factor
of 1.13 for each additional year of age (Table 3). In 2018, males experienced the same mortality
as females aged 3.15 years older.
The additional increment in the mortality rate for individuals in the Swiss covid-19 cohort were
smaller than the sex- and age-effects observed in the Swiss 2018 population cohort (difference
in log-HRs between population and patients 0.17, 95% CI: 0.00 − 0.34, for the sex effect and 0.11,

95% CI: 0.11 − 0.12, for the age effect). Being a male covid-19 patient was associated with a
HR of 1.23, relative to males in the general population (Table 3). The hazard ratio comparing the
hazard of males to females in the Swiss covid-19 cohort was 1.46 × 1.23 = 1.80 (HR, 95%
CI: 1.58 − 2.06). On the log-hazard ratio scale, the sex effect for male covid-19 patients is
0.38 + 0.21 = 0.59 and thus roughly two-thirds of the increased risk in a direct comparison of
male to female covid-19 patients can be attributed to the higher mortality of males in the general
population. The confidence interval for the covid-19 × Male term (HR 1.23, 95% CI: 1.03 − 1.47)
reflects a substantial uncertainty regarding the prognostic relevance of being male with respect
to covid-19 mortality.
Each additional year of age increased the covid-19 mortality rate by a factor of 1.13 × 1.01 = 1.14

(HR, 95% CI: 1.13−1.14). Formulated alternatively, the age-related hazard doubled every 5.75 life

years in the Swiss 2018 population cohort and every 5.42 life years in the Swiss covid-19 cohort.
This additional effect of age in covid-19 patients was rather small (HR, 95% CI: 1.00 − 1.02) and

not significant at the 5% level. Hazards of male patients were comparable to hazards of female
patients 4.60 years older.
[Table 3 about here.]
The 60-day sex- and age-specific probability of death (absolute mortality) was considerably larger

in the covid-19 cohort (Figure 3, top panel and Table 4). The absolute number of expected deaths
per 100000 persons within 60 days ranged from 3 and 4 (35 year old females and males) to 3658
and 5303 (95 year old females and males) in the 2018 population cohort. In covid-19 patients,
these numbers increased to 43 and 82 expected deaths in 35 year old females and males and to

38127 and 60177 expected deaths in 95 year old females and males.
The short-term death probability for 42-year old females diagnosed with covid-19 was about
0.1%, comparable with 65-year old females in the 2018 population cohort. Similarly, 55-year old
infected males were associated with a probability of death around 1%, equivalent to the probability
of 81-year old not infected males in the general population. The probability of death in infected
individuals was above 10% for females older than 82 and males older than 76 years.
The probabilities of death implied a nearly log-linear function of age, for both females and males,
and in both cohorts of the study population. Hence, it follows that the relative risk comparing the
mortality in young patients to the mortality in patients aged 20 years older, for example, would
be constant regardless of the age of younger group of patients. The slope of the probabilities of
death as a function of age was about the same in the Swiss covid-19 cohort due to the models’
negligible age effect attributable to the infection (Table 3, covid-19 ×Age − 65).
[Figure 3 about here.]
The sex- and age-specific relative mortality (Figure 3 bottom panel and Table 4) was largest in
young male patients and declined with increasing age for both females and males. A relative
mortality of 15 (in 50 year old females) is interpreted as 50 year old infected females being 15
times more likely to die within 60 days after the positive test than 50 year old uninfected females
were likely to die within 60 days following February 23, 2018. However, the 95% confidence bands
demonstrated substantial uncertainty in the estimates of this relative risk; the lower confidence
band was as large as 9 for 95-year old females and 10 for 95-year old males. The data were
consistent with an at least 11-fold risk increase in younger females (40 to 85 years old) and with
an at least 15-fold risk increase in younger males (45 to 75 years old).
[Table 4 about here.]

Sensitivity analyses (see Online Supplement) demonstrated that results reported for the 2018
study population were very close to the results for the 2014 to 2017 study populations. Model
diagnostics did not reveal relevant deviations from proportional hazards nor the main effects
model, but indications of a nonlinear age effect in the Swiss covid-19 cohort were found. The
nonlinear model suggested a continuously and monotonically increasing hazard of age lacking
any clear cut-off points for binary risk stratification.

Discussion
The at least nine fold increase in probability of death found in female and male, young and old,
symptomatic covid-19 patients from Switzerland in comparison to the Swiss population of 2018
provides novel sex- and age-specific information on the severity of this pandemic. Short-term
covid-19 mortality has never previously been reported as a relative risk in direct relation to the
short-term mortality in the general population. The comparison of absolute mortalities and casefatality rates between risk groups of covid-19 patients without any population adjustment are likely
to over-estimate the increased mortality in males and older people. As presented here, two-thirds
of the risk increase observed in male patients could be attributed to the generally increased
population mortality.
The population-based setting with matched calendar time allows for estimation of covid-19 related mortality in an unselected cohort of symptomatic and diagnosed patients, without the need
to differentiate between deaths caused or not caused by covid-19 in terms of death certificate
information 28 . Seasonal effects were implicitly accounted for by comparing cohorts over the
same time-of-year. Unlike other population studies estimating excess mortality, the probability of
death in these cohorts could not be confounded by ongoing public health interventions or testing
coverage 28 . Using data from Switzerland was especially useful for this type of analysis. The
borders to northern Italy and Austria caused covid-19 outbreaks early in the pandemic, broad
and uniform symptom-based testing overseen by federal authorities was implemented quickly,
and all test results were reported. A symptom-based testing regime was carried out, with testing
of asymptomatic persons only recommended to control local outbreaks in hospitals or nursing
homes.

In contrast to reports from northern Italy 14 , the number of covid-19 patients in need

for hospitalisation never exceeded health-care capacities, and every patient received the best
possible treatment under the circumstances.
Absolute mortalities in the Swiss covid-19 cohort were smaller than those reported for Italian
and Chinese covid-19 patients 3–5 between 40 and 80 years old. The numbers are expected to
be higher than in Germany, where the overall case fatality rate was only 1.2% and more tests
were performed in younger patients with mild symptoms 29 . Due to differences in testing protocol, substantially higher or lower relative mortality may therefore be expected in other countries.
The Swiss covid-19 cohort excluded persons with known increased mortality risks (those tested

posthumously or while being hospitalised), as well as very old and thus a priori frail persons. The
figures presented here can nevertheless inform models developed for computing prognoses on
the number of expected deaths in real or hypothetical populations, because relative mortality is
not affected by public health interventions which lead to a reduced or even nonexistent excess
mortality in many European countries. For the UK, prognoses assumed a 1-year relative mortality risk not larger than two, uniformly for females and males of all ages 30 . A short-term 60-day
relative mortality larger than nine, as found here, suggests that the actual risk might be larger
than assumed based on prognostic models or reported elsewhere 31 . However, the more general
question of the true covid-19 relative mortality will be lower than that reported in this study, as
the inclusion criteria for the covid-19 cohort was defined on being symptomatic and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. The true proportion of asymptomatic cases and the actual prevalence are
ongoing questions 32 .
The sex- and age effects on all-cause mortality attributable to covid-19 are, however, still relevant
and males and older persons were associated with higher risk. Males had a 23% higher mortality
rate than females, however, the uncertainty around this hazard ratio was large and the effect
was absent in some populations of earlier years and in a model with sex × age interactions (see
Online Supplement). The relative mortality (ratio of the probabilities of death) was approximately
between ten and twenty across all age groups. This population-adjusted comparison of the risk
between young and old patients suggest a less drastic relative impact of age on mortality than
previously reported 8 . Stratification into low and high risk groups using a cutoff at 65 years of age,
as seen in several published reports and recently advocated for 33 , seems hard to justify based on
the continuously increasing age-specific absolute mortalities and almost constant relative mortalities reported here. Relative mortality can also help to explain an increased mortality in younger
patients reported from countries with different age structure: In Chile, 8% of those who died after
an SARS-CoV-2 infection were less than 50 years old 34 , a number much higher than observed in
Europe. Potential deviations from these sex- and age-specific covid-19 risks in relevant patient
subgroups, such as patients with preexisting conditions 1 , pregnant women 35 , and racial, ethic, or
cultural minorities 36 , were not modelled because of lack of information on related variables.
In summary, the results suggest that covid-19 risk assessment in terms of case-fatality rates
and excess mortalities should be complemented by population-adjusted relative mortalities such
that a more complete picture can emerge, potentially leading to improvements for age-based risk
stratification.

A. Online Supplement
A.1. Statistical analysis
For the population cohort of a given year, all inhabitants of Switzerland alive and aged between
35 and 95 years old at February 23 enter the risk set. Inhabitants surviving 80 days were
censored after 80 days, and those who died within 80 days after February 23 were recorded as
an event. To be able to evaluate mortality rates and ratios on the same timescale, allowing
for seasonal effects, for the covid-19 cohort, a delayed entry approach was taken, as patients
do not become at risk of death until their date of positive test. All deaths in this cohort were
treated as events. Individuals without a death record were administratively right-censored 80
days after February 23.
We therefore modelled time-to-death from any cause within 80 days after February 23 (the
first positive SARS-CoV-2 test was recorded February 24, 2020; the database was closed on
2020-05-14). The mortality rate in the Swiss covid-19 cohort was compared to the mortality
rate in the Swiss 2018 population cohort during the same time of year. Hazard ratios were
estimated by a Cox proportional hazards model expressing the distribution of time-to-death
after February 23 in days t > 0. We fitted a Cox model allowing separate baseline hazard
functions, assuming
h(t | male,age, covid-19) =

h2018 (t)1−δ × hcovid-19 (t)δ

× exp(β1 male + β2 (age − 65) + β3 (δ × male) + β4 (δ × (age − 65))

where h2018 (t) is the baseline mortality rate at time t, for a 65 year old female in the Swiss
2018 population cohort, hcovid-19 (t) describes the mortality rate in the Swiss covid-19 cohort
for (on the same calendar timescale to account for seasonal effects), and δ takes the value of
1 if the individual is in the covid-19 cohort, and 0 if the individual is in the 2018 cohort. The
linear predictor is parameterised in such a way that we can quantify the effects of age and
being male in the general population by the hazard ratios exp(β1 ) and exp(β2 ), respectively,
and the additional increase/decrease in the hazard attributable to age and being male in the
covid-19 cohort, described by the exp(β3 ) and exp(β4 ), respectively. The proportional hazards
assumption was assessed by comparing the in-sample log-likelihood of the model described
above to the in-sample log-likelihood of a Cox model with time-varying sex- and age-effects.
The simpler model assuming proportional hazards maximised the log-likelihood at −5386·64
and the model not assuming proportional hazards at −5379·64, suggesting that mortalities
were appropriately modelled under proportional hazards.
For the estimation and comparison of absolute risk, i.e. the probability of dying by time t,
we model the mortality rate in the covid-19 cohort on the time since diagnosis timescale.
Therefore, the model for the 2018 cohort remains the same, and we are interested in the
probability of death 60 days after February 23, 2018. In the covid-19 cohort, we are interested
in the probability of death 60 days after diagnosis. Two separate Cox models were fitted to
the cohorts with the appropriate timescales. Relative mortality (RM), at time t, is then
defined as,
RM(t | sex, age) =

P(t | sex, age, 1)
·
P(t | sex, age, 0)

Relative covid-19 Mortality
which is the ratio of the probability P(t | sex, age, 1) to die within t days after a positive
SARS-CoV-2 test and the probability P(t | sex, age, 0) to die within t days after February 23,
2018 without an infection for female or male persons of a specific age. We used a time horizon
of t = 60 days. A relative mortality RM(60 | female, 65) = X means that the probability to
die within 60 after an SARS-CoV-2 infection is X times larger than the population probability to die within 60 days after February 23, 2018, for 65 year old females. Proportional
hazards models for absolute risk were estimated with log-cumulative baseline hazard functions
parameterised in terms of a Bernstein polynomial 22 , that is, using a parametric equivalent of
the semiparametric Cox model.
In all models, the assumption of a linear age effect was assessed by comparing the linear
Cox proportional hazards model to a Cox proportional model featuring a nonlinear additive
effect of age on the log-hazard (Figure 1). For the 2018 population cohort, differences were
marginal and justified the use of a linear age term. For the Swiss covid-19 cohort, the nonlinear
model suggested a stronger age effect up to 80 years, which then levelled-off for older people.
The discrepancy between the nonlinear and the linear Cox model in terms of the estimated
probability of death at day 80 can be inferred from Figure 2. For the 2018 population cohort,
the probability of death from both models were very similar, with some variation for people
older than 90 years, which can be explained by the sharp increase of the corresponding loghazard ratio (Figure 1). In the age range between 60 and 90 years, the two models were
relatively similar (±25%), however, the nonlinear model suggested the probability of death
was 50% reduced compared to probability of death from the linear model. This means that
the relative mortalities assuming a linear effect of age on the log-hazard scale (Figure 3 and
Table 4) could be up to two times smaller for people younger than 60 and up to two times
larger for persons around 80 years old in a more complex model allowing a nonlinear effect
of age. We also considered an interaction between sex and age, found significant effects yet
hardly relevant effect sizes (HR, 0·99 for the 2018 population and 1·02 for the covid-19 cohort,
see Table 1). It should be noted that the confidence interval for the hazard ratio of the covid19 × Male effect is very wide and includes one. Thus, the interaction model suggests that all
covid-19 patients suffer the same hazard increase, compared to the 2018 population.

A.2. Computational details
Computations were performed in R version 4.0.2 20 . Cox proportional hazards models were
fitted semiparametrically to estimate log-hazard ratios using the survival 21 package. Absolute
mortalities were obtained from Cox models, parametrically parameterised with flexible logcumulative baseline hazard function, using package mlt1 . Multiplicity adjusted P -values,
confidence intervals, and confidence bands for Cox models were computed using the multcomp
package2 .

A.3. Sensitivity analysis
The primary analyses were conducted in R; however, to ensure validity and robustness, all
analyses were replicated independently in Stata by using a flexible parametric survival model 25
using the stpm2 26 and merlin 27 commands, which can be considered a parametric equivalent to the Cox model but use restricted cubic splines to directly model the baseline (log
