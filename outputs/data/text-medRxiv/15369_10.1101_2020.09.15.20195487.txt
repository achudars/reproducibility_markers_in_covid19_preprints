Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) has overwhelmed many health systems globally. Here, we aim to
identify biological markers and associated biological processes of COVID-19 using a
bioinformatics approach to elucidate their potential pathogenesis. The gene expression
profile of the GSE152418 dataset was originally produced by using the high-throughput
Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG)
and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses were applied to identify functional
categories and biochemical pathways. KEGG and GO results suggested that biological
pathways such as “Cancer pathways” and “Insulin pathways” were mostly affected in
the development of COVID-19. Moreover, we identified several genes including EP300,
CREBBP, and POLR2A were involved in the virus activities in COVID-19 patients. We
further predicted that some inhibitors may have the potential to block the SARS-CoV-2
infection based on the L1000FWD analysis. Therefore, our study provides further
insights into the underlying pathogenesis of COVID-19.

Introduction
COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, has affected a large number of countries
with increasing morbidity and mortality1. Most COVID-19 patients exhibited mild-tomoderate symptoms and small groups of patients typically within a week turned into a
severe stage. Early reports showed 21% of COVID-19 patients died in New York City
during March 20202. The aged patients or those with medical comorbidities such as
diabetes, hypertension, lung diseases and cardiovascular diseases have a higher
mortality rate3. Currently, there are no curative therapies for COVID-19. Therefore,
understandings of the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis are critical to the development of
therapeutics.
Recent studies have suggested that uncontrolled inflammation leads to disease severity
in COVID-194. Most COVID-19 patients are characterized by increased numbers of
neutrophils and exhibit increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL6, IL1

and MCP-1 in the plasma5. The uncontrolled pro-inflammatory cytokines may lead to
shock, respiratory failure and multiple organ failure in COVID-19 patients6. However,
little is known about the mechanisms underlying COVID-19, and whether individuals in
different parts of the world respond differently to SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown.
The SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus with spike-like glycoproteins7. The development of
vaccines for COVID-19 patients are largely dependent on the specific RNA and protein
structure8, 9. Modern antiviral drug discovery is expected to be impacted dramatically by
analyzing genomics10. High-throughput microarray methodologies and advanced drug
development such as remdesivir have drawn extensive attentions 11. Thus, there is an
urgent need to identify potential targets or biomarkers for COVID-19 patients by
genomics.
In this study, we investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We analyzed and identified several DEGs, inhibitors and
the relevant biological processes of COVID-19 by utilizing comprehensive bioinformatics
analysis. We performed the functional enrichment, pathway analysis, and proteinprotein interaction for finding COVID-19 gene nodes in PBMCs. These key genes and
pathogenetic factors could be critical to guide future clinical and therapeutic
interventions.

Methods
Data resources
Gene expression profile dataset GSE152418 was obtained from the GEO database
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The data was produced by using an Illumina
NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens) (Developmental and Cognitive Neuroscience, Yerkes
National Primate Research Center, Atlanta, GA30329-4208, US). The GSE152418
dataset contained data including 17 COVID-19 subjects and 17 healthy controls.

The raw microarray data between SARS-CoV-2 positive samples and negative controls
were subsequently conducted by R script. We used a classical t test to identify DEGs
with P<.01 and fold change ≥1.5 as being statistically significant.
Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis
Gene Ontology (GO) analysis is a widely used approach to annotate genomic data and
identify characteristic biological information. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) database is commonly used for systematic analysis of gene
functions and annotation of biological pathways. GO analysis and KEGG pathway
enrichment analysis of DEGs in this study were analyzed by the Database for
Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (http://david.ncifcrf.gov/).
P<.05 and gene counts >10 were considered statistically significant.
Module analysis
The Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) was used to analyze the densely
connected regions in PPI networks. The significant modules were from constructed PPI
networks using MCODE. The function and pathway enrichment analyses were
performed by using DAVID, and P<.05 was used as the cutoff criterion.
Inhibitor analysis prediction
The L1000FWD, a NIH Common Fund program, is used to identify potential novel
inhibitors. L1000FWD calculated the similarity between an input gene expression
signature and the LINCS-L1000 data to rank inhibitors which can regulate the
transcriptional signature12. The adjusted p-value of 0.05 has been considered as
threshold for statistical significance.
Cell culture and treatment
The RAW 264.7 cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC® TIB-71™). Cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The cells were
induced with 1µg/mL LPS for 24 hours and treated with different potential inhibitors for
24 hours: anisomycin (20µM, Sigma), BRD-K60870698 (20µM, Santa Cruz), QL-X-138

(20µM, Probechem), BMS-345541 (20µM, Sigma), homoharringtonine (20µM, Sigma)
and kinetin-riboside (20µM, Sigma).
Real-time PCR
The total RNA from cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) as
described previously13. The cDNA was obtained using a reverse transcription kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (TAKARA, US). PCR amplification was
carried out for a total of 40 cycles and normalized to GAPDH expression. All reactions
were performed in triplicate, and the relative expression was determined using the 2ΔΔCT method. The primers used are listed as follows:
GAPDH(F):AGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTG,GAPDH(R):TGTAGACCATGTAGTTGAG
GTCA;IL1(F):GCCCATCCTCTGTGACTCAT,IL1(R):AGGCCACAGGTATTTTGTCG;IL6
(F):AGTTGCCTTCTTGGGACTGA,IL6(R):TCCACGATTTCCCAGAGAAC;TNFα(F):CG
TCAGCCGATTTGCTATCT, TNFα(R):CGGACTCCGCAAAGTCTAAG.
Statistical analysis
For statistical analysis, Prism 7 software (GraphPad Software, USA) was used. The
data were expressed as the mean ± S.E.M. A two-tailed Student’s t-test was performed
to determine the significance of the difference between the two groups. One-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett’s post hoc test was used to compare more
than two groups. P values < 0.05 were considered significant.

Results
Identification of DEGs in COVID-19 patients
To gain the insights on host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the modular
transcriptional signature of COVID-19 patients was compared to that of the healthy
controls. A total of 1254 genes were identified to be differentially expressed in COVID19 samples with the threshold of P<0.001. The top 10 up- and down-regulated genes for
COVID-19 and negative samples are list in Table 1.

To further analyze the biological roles and potential mechanisms of DEGs from the
COVID-19 samples versus healthy controls, we performed KEGG pathway and GO
categories enrichment analysis. KEGG pathways (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) is an
encyclopedia of genes and genomes for understanding high-level functions. Our study
showed top ten enriched KEGG pathways including “Pathways in cancer”, “Insulin
signaling pathway”, “Neurotrophin signaling pathway”, “T cell receptor signaling
pathway”, “Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis”, “Pancreatic cancer”,
“Phosphatidylinositol signaling system”, “Inositol phosphate metabolism”, “Acute
myeloid leukemia”, and “Chronic myeloid leukemia” (Figure 1).
Gene Ontology (GO) analysis is a major bioinformatic initiative to unify the
representation of gene and gene product, which includes cellular components,
molecular functions, and biological processes. We identified top ten cellular components
including “Non-membrane-bounded organelle”, “Intracellular non-membrane-bounded
organelle”, “Membrane-enclosed lumen”, “Organelle lumen”, “Intracellular organelle
lumen”, “Nucleolus”, “Nuclear lumen”, “microtubule cytoskeleton”, “Nucleoplasm”, and
“Nucleoplasm part” (Figure 1). We then identified top ten biological processes: “Cellular
macromolecule catabolic process”, “Regulation of transcription”, “Regulation of RNA
metabolic process”, “Regulation of transcription, DNA-dependent”, “Protein catabolic”,
“Cellular protein catabolic process”, “Proteolysis involved in cellular protein catabolic
process”, “Modification-dependent protein catabolic process”, “Modification-dependent
macromolecule catabolic process”, and “Transcription” (Figure 1). We also identified top
ten molecular functions: “Metal ion binding”, “Transcription regulator activity”,
“Transcription factor binding”, “Transition metal ion binding”, “DNA binding”, “Protein
serine/threonine kinase activity”, “Zinc ion binding”, “Transcription cofactor activity”,
“Transcription activator activity”, and “Transcription coactivator activity” (Figure 1).
PPI network and Module analysis
The PPI network was constructed to further explore the relationships of DGEs at the
protein level. We set the criterion of combined score >0.7 and created the PPI network
by using the 1198 nodes and 3137 interactions between negative controls and COVID-

19 positive samples. Among these nodes, the top ten genes with highest scores are
shown in Table 2.
The top two significant modules of COVID-19 versus control samples were selected to
depict the functional annotation of genes (Figure 2). We identified top ten signaling
pathways in module 1: Antigen processing, Neddylation, Class I MHC mediated antigen
processing and presentation, Adaptive Immune System, Immune System, Posttranslational protein modification, Metabolism of proteins, MAP3K8 (TPL2)-dependent
MAPK1/3 activation, Conversion from APC/C:Cdc20 to APC/C:Cdh1 and Inhibition of
the proteolytic activity of APC/C. We also identified top ten signaling pathways in
module 2: mRNA Splicing (Major), mRNA Splicing, RNA polymerase II transcribes
snRNA genes, Processing of Capped Intron-Containing Pre-mRNA, Metabolism of
RNA, mRNA Splicing (Minor), RNA Polymerase II Transcription, Transcription of the
HIV genome, Gene expression (Transcription), RNA Polymerase II Pre-transcription
Events by using Reactome Pathway Database (https://reactome.org/) (Supplemental
Table S1).
Potential inhibitors for COVID-19 disease
We highlighted top ten inhibitors (Table 3) and further selected six potential anti-COVID19 inhibitors with the highest scores identified by using the L1000FWD analysis (Figure
3). Among them: anisomycin is used as a DNA synthesis inhibitor; BRD-K60870698 is a
protein synthesis inhibitor; QL-X-138 is used for PARP inhibition; BMS-345541 is used
as an IKK inhibitor, homoharrringtonine is used as a protein synthesis inhibitor; kinetinriboside is used for EGFR inhibition. Macrophages are key players during SARS-CoV-2
infection in innate immunity: they produce cytokines and lead to the activation and
regulation of immune response14, 15. We then determined the anti-inflammatory effects
of the six predicted inhibitors by using the LPS induced macrophages (Figure 4). We
found the anisomycin, QL-X-138 and BMS-345541 can inhibit the IL1, IL6 and TNFα
expressions during the LPS induction (Figure 4). It is suggested that the potential
inhibitors, anisomycin, QL-X-138, and BMS-345541, may block the SARS-CoV-2
infection and inflammation in COVID-19 patients.

Discussion
The COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 has turned into a worldwide
catastrophe. Understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is highly urgent and critical
for diagnosis and treatment.
In the study by Lee LY et al16, the phenotype of COVID-19 disease in over half of the
cancer patients is mild, but the mortality is higher than that in the general non-cancer
population. And based on our KEGG studies, we found the COVID-19 patients were
highly relevant to the cancer related pathways including acute myeloid leukemia and
chronic myeloid leukemia. Besides cancer, diabetes is also associated with decreased
host defense immunity and disordered glucose metabolism, which increases the
susceptibility to COVID-19 infection17. Additionally, our KEGG studies indicated that
COVID-19 took part in the regulation of insulin pathways. It is probable that patients with
COVID-19 may aggravate the disorders of insulin and glucose metabolism. Thus,
protecting patients with cancer related diseases or diabetes from exposure to SARSCoV-2 is crucial. Wearing mask, self-isolation, keeping safe distance and avoiding
crowded work environments are the best ways to minimize the risk of COVID-19.
In addition, the infection of COVID-19 is also associated with the cellular macromolecule
catabolic process including the regulation of RNA metabolic process and the proteolysis
involved in cellular protein catabolic process based on our GO analysis. Entry of the
SARS-CoV-2 is mainly dependent on proteolytic activation of the spike protein 18. During
the process of viral infection, the spike protein is cleaved into the S1 and S2 subunits
and the S2 subunit is released19. The other evidence indicated that SARS-CoV-2 S
protein can activate protease-independent and receptor-dependent cellular fusion to
promote viral spreading20.
In our study, the subsequent construction of the PPI network identified several DEGs as
potential critical genes during COVID-19 which could be considered as active targets.
EP300 and CREBBP target a significant number of proteins for acetylation, including
cytosolic proteins involved in essential metabolic processes 21. POLR2A is a key virus
polymerase-interacting protein and is required for viral replication and transcriptional

activity22. Cell division cycle 20 (CDC20) encodes a regulatory protein and plays
important roles in tumorigenesis23. Autophagy and the ubiquitin–proteasome system
(UPS) are two major intracellular quality control pathways that are responsible for
cellular homeostasis in eukaryotes24. Here, we identified the UPS related gene UBE2C,
BTRC, CUL3, FBXW11, DCAF and autophagy related gene ATG7 were related to
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In our study, we identified a number of anti-COVID-19 inhibitors by using L1000FWD.
Interestingly, among these inhibitors, we found that anisomycin, QL-X-138, and BMS345541 can also block the inflammation in macrophages, which may further inhibit the
cytokine storm in COVID-19 disease. Anisomycin inhibits protein synthesis and
substantially depresses the levels of the conventional early mRNAs 25. In the study by V
M Quintana et al, anisomycin strongly inhibits the replication of reference strains and
clinical isolates of all DENV serotypes and ZIKV virus in Vero cells 26. QL-X-138 was
identified as a selective and potent BTK/MNK dual kinase inhibitor, which exhibited
covalent binding to BTK and noncovalent binding to MNK27. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)
is a critical molecular which is involved in numerous inflammatory processes and
diseases28-30. The inhibition of NF-κB by BMS-345541 prevents the TNFα-induced rise
in PTPN2 protein, independent of apoptotic events 31. Moreover, BMS-345541 can
inhibit the IKKbeta kinase activity from HTLV-1 infected cells32.
In summary, we provided the basis for the identification of potential biomarkers for the
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cancer and diabetes are the two major kinds of diseases
triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Future studies will focus on single and combined
administration of potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors in vivo and in vitro studies. Our
study thus provides further insights into the mechanism of COVID-19, which may
facilitate the diagnosis and treatment.

Figure 4. Potential inhibitors decrease the inflammation in macrophages. The
RAW264.7 cells were induced with LPS (1µg/mL) for 24 hours and treated with the
predicted inhibitors (anisomycin 20µM, BRD-K60870698 20µM, QL-X-138 20µM, BMS345541 20µM, homoharringtonine 20µM and kinetin-riboside 20µM) for 24 hours. The
relative mRNA expression level of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1, IL6 and TNFα were
determined by real-time PCR. **P < 0.01 and *P < 0.05 versus control (n = 5). Note that
the anisomycin, QL-X-138 and BMS-345541 depicted anti-inflammation effect in LPS
induced macrophages.
