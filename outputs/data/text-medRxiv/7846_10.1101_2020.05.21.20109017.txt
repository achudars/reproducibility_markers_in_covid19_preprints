Abstract
COVID-19 point prevalence PCR community testing allows disease burden estimation. In a
sample of London residents, point prevalence decreased from 2.2% (95%CI 1.4;3.5) in early
April (reflecting infection around lockdown implementation) to 0.2% (95%CI 0.03-1.6) in early
May (reflecting infection 3-5 weeks into lockdown). Extrapolation from reports of confirmed
cases suggest that 5-7.6% of total infections were confirmed by testing during this period.
These data complement seroprevalence surveys improving the understanding of
transmission in London.

Conflict of interest: None declared
Funding statement: This study was conducted as part of Public Health England routine COVID19 surveillance activities. No specific funding was received.

Background
The World Health Organization declared COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by SARSCoV-2, a pandemic on March 11th 2020. The UK reported its first case on January 31st; and
as of May 18th 2020 243,695 confirmed cases had been reported[1]. At the beginning of the
study in early April, UK policy was to prioritise available tests for patients requiring
hospitalisation and outbreaks in institutional settings. Evidence suggests that over 80% of
COVID-19 cases are mild[2] and that the proportion who are asymptomatic when tested may
be as high as 80%[3]. Therefore, using laboratory confirmation in hospitalised cases will
severely underestimate disease incidence. Repeated testing among individuals in the
community will help estimate trends in COVID-19 point prevalence and help to describe the
characteristics of milder infection. We assessed COVID-19 point prevalence in London

between early April and early May 2020, which approximately reflect infection around the
time of the lockdown and 3-5 weeks into lockdown.

Use of a participative cohort

Flusurvey (Flusurvey.net) is a participative surveillance cohort set up for influenza
surveillance[4] and adapted for COVID19. Any member of the UK public can register and
report on symptoms weekly. On March 27th 2020, all Flusurvey participants resident in
London were asked for their consent and the consent of their household members, to
receive a nasal swab for COVID-19 testing. Self-swabbing has previously been shown to be
acceptable to Flusurvey participants[5] and uses packaging compliant with UN3733[6].
Together with the swab, Flusurvey participants and their household members were asked to
report any cough, fever, shortness of breath and loss of smell in the two weeks prior to the
swab using a short questionnaire. The first set of swabs and questionnaires were posted to
participants on 31/03/2020 (wave 1). In the second phase of swabbing, half of the
participants were randomly selected and sent a swab between 29 and 30/04/2020 (wave 2).
In order to ascertain pre-lockdown point prevalence in the first wave of sampling, we divided
wave 1 samples between timely (collected before 7/04/2020) and late (collected or received
7-29/04/2020) samples.
Nasal swabs were tested for viral RNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at the Public
Health England Respiratory Virus Unit using primers targeted to either the RdRp and/or Orf
gene[7,8].
The age and sex distribution of the initial respondents were compared with the London
population[9], and positivity rate by sex and age group calculated, together with 95%
confidence intervals (95%CIs). We described the symptoms that timely wave 1 participants
reported and their association with being a case, using risk ratios together with 95%CIs. We
calculated the positive predictive value of each of the reported symptoms as well as for fever
and cough as a cluster. We calculated the positivity rate among participants who returned
their first swab late and their second swab, with 95%CIs.

Characteristics of participants

1,373 individuals (582 London Flusurvey participants and 791 household members)
consented to self-swabbing. By 12/05/2020, 1081 first wave samples were received
(response rate: 79%) of which 17 were excluded because the participant no longer reported
a London address. The participants who sent the remaining 1064 samples were distributed
across each London Borough, although the sample underrepresented children (table 1). Age
distribution of participants did not differ significantly by sex (p=0.8). Of the 698 individuals
who received a second swab, 444 had returned them by 12/05/2020 (response rate 63.6%).
Of the 1064 wave 1 samples received, 816 were timely and 248 were late.
Table1. Age distribution of sample compared with London population

Of the 816 timely samples from the first wave, 18 were positive in 14 households (positivity
2.2%, 95%CI 1.4-3.5). Positivity was higher among females and among 10-19 year olds
(Table 2). Of the 18 positive individuals, 14 (78%) had experienced symptoms in the last 2
weeks and 4 (22%) had not. Symptom onset among symptomatic participants ranged from
March 15-30th and time from symptom onset to sample collection ranged from 4-19 days.
Cough was the most commonly reported symptom among cases and all symptoms were
significantly associated with being COVID19 positive (table 3). The positive predictive value
of these symptoms ranged 7.1-13.5% (table 3). Of the 248 late wave 1 samples, 2 (both
female and symptomatic) were positive (0.8%, 95% CI 0.2-3.2) and only 1/444 samples
received from wave 2 was positive (0.2%, 95% CI 0.03-1.6). The case was female,
asymptomatic, not a household contact of a previously identified case, and had tested
negative in early April. Of the 20 positive participants in phase 1 of swabbing, five (including
three asymptomatic) were retested and all were negative. Of the 3 asymptomatic cases that
were retested, none reported symptoms when asked again. Thirty-seven individuals lived in
the 16 households which had a least one case. Household size ranged from 1-4 individuals.
Five households had 2 cases (Table 4). No additional cases were found during wave 2 in the
5 households that were tested in both waves and had an individual who tested positive in
wave 1.

Impact of the lockdown on point prevalence
This study is the first to describe changes in the point prevalence of COVID-19 infection in
the community in London, and England more generally. The 2.2% point prevalence reflects
infections acquired in London shortly before and after the lockdown on March 23rd 2020, and
the positivity rate of 0.2% reflects infections during the second half of April, three to five
weeks into the lockdown. The decrease in incidence suggests the lockdown was effective at
reducing COVID-19 transmission in London. Positivity is likely to be an underestimate; apart
from the usual limitations of PCR diagnostics, self-testing may be slightly less sensitive than
administered swabs[10].
Around the time of our second swab, a pilot survey across England found a similar infection
prevalence of 0.27% in early May[11]. In Iceland, a PCR-based screening in a random
sample of the population had a 0.6% positivity[12]. In Vo, a town in the Veneto region of
Italy, screening of the entire population around the time of the lockdown showed a 2.6%
positivity[13]. The London point prevalence in early April was expected to be higher than
other UK regions, based on the numbers of hospitalised cases per population at the time of
swabbing[1].

Implications of findings
Evidence suggests that, in mild cases, the virus is detectable in the upper respiratory tract by
PCR from approximately 2 days before to 10 days after the onset of symptoms in over 90%
of cases[14,15]. A further 10% are positive at 14 days, with occasional reports of longer-term
detection[14]. Based on these values, a community PCR point prevalence survey, which
only identifies acutely infected individuals, is broadly equivalent to the number of cases
acquired over a 12-day period plus an additional 10% of cases acquired in the 4 days before
that. Assuming a 5 day lag between disease onset and hospital admission (and testing), and
using April 3 as the most common date for the first set of swabs, our infections should
correspond to those presenting to hospital and getting tested between March 23 – April 7.
Over that time, 10,007 cases were reported in London[1], corresponding to a point
prevalence of 0.11%. Compared with the 2.2% positivity from our survey, this suggests that,
in London, only 5% of cases were being confirmed through the testing strategy at that time.
During the time period around the second swabbing (April 23rd to May 8th, determined using
a similar approach) there were 2254 reported cases in London, a point prevalence of
0.025% suggesting that 7.6% of infections were detected. These crude figures should be
interpreted with caution because viral shedding likely declines over time, affecting test
sensitivity in a more complex way. Nevertheless, this figure is consistent with a model that

estimated that between 4 and 8.4% of symptomatic cases were being confirmed through
testing in hospitals[16].
Two findings were unexpected. First the positivity was higher among females than males,
whereas sex-disaggregated data for COVID-19 show equal numbers of cases between men
and women[17]. This could be due to a higher proportion of mild cases among females as
higher severity among males is well documented[18]. Second, 45% of the cases with a date
of symptom onset tested positive more than 10 days after the beginning of their symptoms;
this compares published data suggesting 90% of mild cases testing negative 10 days post
symptom onset[14]. These findings warrant further investigation.
The repeated questionnaire and swabbing enabled us to confirm that all retested positive
cases who reported no symptoms were genuinely asymptomatic rather than presymptomatic.
There are limitations to our data. First, the sample is relatively small and purposive (as
individuals self-select to register with the cohort) and is therefore likely to not be
representative on characteristics beyond age and sex. Secondly, limited information about
timing and symptoms makes reconstructing timelines among households difficult. Thirdly, we
made a number of assumptions when estimating under-ascertainment, and did not fully take
into account the temporal distribution of likelihood of PCR detection. Linking the swabbing
results with information collected weekly in Flusurvey may enable us to reconstruct timelines
for each case and to document the duration of symptoms and risk factors associated with
becoming infected. This data should be interpreted in conjunction with seroprevalence
studies, which are ongoing.
Ethics statement
Ethics approval for inviting participants for self-swabbing was obtained when Flusurvey was
initially set up in 2008/9, and each participant was individually re-consented.
