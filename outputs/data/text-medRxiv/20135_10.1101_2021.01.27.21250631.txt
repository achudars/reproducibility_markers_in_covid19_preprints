ABSTRACT (249 words)
Purpose: The awake prone position (PP) strategy for patients with acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) is a safe, simple, and cost-effective technique used to improve hypoxemia.
We aimed to evaluate the relationship between awake PP (AP) and endotracheal intubation in
patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Methods: In this retrospective, multicentre observational study conducted between 1 May and
12 June 2020 in 27 hospitals in Mexico and Ecuador, non-intubated patients with COVID-19
managed with AP or awake supine positioning (AS) were included to evaluate intubation and
mortality risk in AP patients through logistic regression models; multivariable adjustment,
propensity score analyses, and E-values were calculated to limit confounding. A CART model
with

cross-validation

was

also

built.

This

study

was

registered

at

https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04407468
Results: 827 non-intubated patients with COVID-19 in the AP (n=505) and AS (n=322)
groups were included for analysis. Less patients in the AP group required endotracheal
intubation (23.6% vs 40.4%) or died (20% vs 37.9%). AP was a protective factor for intubation
even after multivariable adjustment (OR=0.39, 95%CI:0.28-0.56, p<0.0001, E-value=2.01),
which prevailed after propensity score analysis (OR=0.32, 95%CI:0.21-0.49, p<0.0001, Evalue=2.21), and mortality (adjusted OR=0.38, 95%CI:0.25-0.57, p<0.0001, E-value=1.98).
The main variables associated with PP failure in AP patients were age, lower SpO2/FiO2, and
management with a non-rebreather mask. In the CART model, only two variables were used:
SpO2/FiO2 (F 97.7, p<0.001) and PP (X2 50.5, p<0.001), with an overall percentage of 75.2%.
Conclusion: PP in awake hospitalised patients with COVID-19 is associated with a lower risk
of intubation and mortality.

INTRODUCTION

The prone position (PP) in awake, non-intubated patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory
failure results in improved oxygenation, as demonstrated by an increase in arterial partial
pressure of oxygen (PaO2), peripheral arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), and PaO2/inspired
oxygen fraction (PaO2/FiO2), without deleterious effects on the level of partial arterial pressure
of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), pH, respiratory rate (RR), or haemodynamics (1,2). PP combined
with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in patients with
moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been shown to be safe and
effective and may prevent intubation (3,4). The pathophysiological mechanism by which PP is
useful for ARDS is by increasing functional residual capacity, reducing dead space, reducing
intrapulmonary shunts, increasing ventilation in areas dependent of gravity, and relieving the
weight that the heart exerts over the lungs (5).

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has unleashed a high global demand for
respiratory support, a reason why PP in awake non-intubated patients has become popular and
clinical interest has rapidly increased. An early strategy combining PP together with NIV or
HFNC has been reported to be associated with reduced intubation and mortality and improved
oxygenation (6–8). One further advantage of PP without intubation is that it allows patients to
interact with their family during hospitalisation, thereby favouring humanisation of healthcare
(9). Nonetheless, few observational studies have included control groups (i.e. awake supine
patients managed with NIV or HFNC) and have had conflicting findings. While Ferando et al.
(10) and Padrão et al. (11) found no differences in intubation risk between prone and supine
patients, Jagan et al. (12) found a reduction in intubation risk for PP patients. Thus, the utility of
awake PP remains to be further elucidated in larger observational or randomised studies.

In this multicentre retrospective observational study, we sought to explore the relationship
between awake PP and the need for orotracheal intubation, and to develop a model to predict
this outcome. The secondary objective was to compare and explore the association between
awake PP and mortality risk in the APRONOX study.

METHODS

Study design

A multicentre retrospective cohort study was conducted with patients diagnosed with COVID19 admitted to the emergency department in 27 hospitals in Mexico and Ecuador (Appendix 2).
The study was approved by the Health Services Research Committee of the State of Querétaro
(registration number 1178/SESEQ-HGSJR/08-05-20) and all other participating centres. This
study was prospectively registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04407468); STROBE
recommendations were followed during the reporting of this study.

Study population and data collection

In each participating hospital centre, data collection was carried out by medical specialists in
emergency medicine, respiratory medicine, anaesthesiology, and intensive care medicine, who
collected information from patients’ medical records. A separate group of physicians were
appointed to review the data obtained and check for plausibility. In cases of doubt physicians in
charge at each hospital centre were contacted.

Patients were deidentified by assigning them a code. All patients admitted to the emergency
department during the period between 1 May and 12 June 2020 who met the following criteria
were ultimately included in the study: 1. Age >18 years; 2. Positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis; 3.
Full inpatient stay at the centre until final outcome; 4. Full clinical records in accordance with
the

official

Mexican

standard

NOM-004-SSA3-2012

(http://dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle_popup.php?codigo=5272787); and 5. Partial oxygen saturation
(SpO2) < 94% at room-air partial fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) upon admission to the
emergency department.

Due to the differences in funding and infrastructure between centres, two criteria were employed
to standardise SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis: 1. A positive RT-PCR test from a respiratory tract
sample; and 2. Positive chest computed tomography (CT) scan with a COVID-19 Reporting and

Data System (CO-RADS) score > 3 (Appendix 3) (13), together with two or more of the
following symptoms: eye pain, cough, fever, dyspnoea, headache, arthralgia, or odynophagia.
Patients who self-discharged or who were referred to another hospital centre prior to outcome
ascertainment, and those with incomplete clinical records, were excluded from the study.

Data recorded were demographic (age, sex) and clinical variables including comorbidities
(diabetes, systemic arterial hypertension, obesity, heart disease, lung disease, cancer, liver
disease, chronic kidney disease), pre-prone SpO2/FiO2 ratio (14), supplemental oxygen delivery
device used, need for orotracheal intubation, and lethal outcome. FiO2 was calculated based on
the type of supplemental oxygen delivery device employed: low-flow nasal cannula, high-flow
nasal cannula or non-rebreather mask (Appendix 4) (15).

The decision to place patients in the prone position and perform orotracheal intubation was
based on individualised medical criteria and was not priorly defined or standardised. The
objective of this study was to explore the relationship between orotracheal intubation as the
dependent variable and the prone position in awake patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 as an
independent variable.

Due to the observational nature of the study and the fact it posed no risk to study participants,
convenience sampling was employed with the goal of recruiting the largest number of
participants to maximise statistical power.

Statistical analysis

The clinical and demographic characteristics of the patients were examined for all patients and
for those in the awake PP (AP) or awake supine position (AS) groups. Descriptive results for
quantitative variables are presented as mean with standard deviation (SD), and frequencies with
percentage (%) for qualitative variables. Asymmetry and kurtosis were calculated for
quantitative variables. Quantitative comparisons were performed with the independent-samples
t-test; qualitative comparisons were done with chi-squared or Fisher’s exact test. Baseline and
post-AP SpO2/FiO2 ratios were compared with the dependent-samples t-test.

To reduce the risk of bias due to unbalanced groups, propensity score analysis was performed
through a logistic regression model adjusted for age, sex, the presence of 3 or more
comorbidities and baseline SpO2/FiO2 ratio. Patients were matched in a 1:1 ratio according to
the nearest-neighbour matching algorithm; changes in density functions are shown in Appendix
5. All inferential analyses were performed for all patients in the original cohort and for the
propensity score-matched cohorts.

Distinct multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the risk of
orotracheal intubation and mortality associated with AP. Variables included in the models were
selected by the Enter method; adjustment variables were those which had a p value <0.1 in
univariate analyses which have been reported to be associated with higher risk for adverse
events (age, sex [men], diabetes, systemic arterial hypertension, obesity, heart disease, cancer,
chronic kidney disease), pre-prone SpO2/FiO2 ratio, and supplemental oxygen delivery device).
A multivariable logistic regression model was subsequently created for AP patients to determine
the risk of failure to pronation; the variables included in this model were selected with the
Stepwise Forward method, including those with a p<0.1 in the final model. Odds ratios (OR)
with their 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated. The goodness of fit of the final
model was evaluated with the Hosmer-Loemeshow statistic, and the discrimination of the model
was determined by calculating the area under the curve (AUC). The risk of failure to AP
according to age and baseline SpO2/FiO2 ratio were graphed through the smoothing spline
method. E-values for the lower bound of the confidence intervals were calculated to determine
the value at which an unmeasured confounding factor could potentially alter the observed effect
of AP on the outcomes and drive them to a non-significant value (16). Regression analyses were
verified through residual analysis.

A classification and regression tree (CART) model were constructed with cross-validation, the
QUEST (Quick, Unbiased, Efficient, Statistical Tree) growing method, and pruning control to
prevent overfitting (reduce standard error). This methodology is based on developing
hierarchical binary classification trees with sensitivity analysis based on the Gini index (17).

A systematic review of studies of AP was conducted; the search strategy and inclusion criteria
for studies are provided in Appendix 6. Results of eligible studies were summarised alongside
the propensity score-matched cohort of APRONOX in a forest plot and the overall risk for
intubation for patients in AP vs AS was calculated.

Missing values were not imputed. A p-value <0.05 was used to define bilateral statistical
significance. All analyses and graphs were created with the SPSS software v.21, R software
v.3.4.2, and RevMan 5.3.

RESULTS

Out of 932 patients identified across all 27 hospital centres, 827 patients were ultimately
included for analysis (Figure 1). Descriptive results for all patients are provided in Table 1.
Among all 927 patients, 227 (27.4%) were female and mean age was 54.3 (SD:14.2) years, with
most patients being in the 50 to 59-year category (25.3%). The most prevalent comorbidities
were diabetes (38.1%) and hypertension (34.5%). Most patients were managed with low-flow
nasal cannulas (48.6%). The characteristics of patients in the AP and AS groups, in both the
unmatched and matched cohorts, are provided in Table 2. A lesser proportion of patients in the
AP group required endotracheal intubation (23.6% vs 40.4%) or had a lethal outcome (20% vs
37.9%). After propensity score matching, these differences prevailed. The SpO2/FiO2 ratio in the
AP group was statistically significantly higher after PP (217.42, SD: 81.9) compared with
baseline values (182.39, SD: 81.91), with a mean difference of 35.03 (95%CI: 29.99-40.06,
p<0.0001) units.

The results of univariable logistic regression models for orotracheal intubation risk are provided
in Table 3, for both the unmatched and matched cohorts. The main risk factors identified were
age, diabetes, arterial hypertension, obesity, heart disease, cancer, a baseline SpO2/FiO2 <100 or
between 100 and 199, and management with a non-rebreather mask. Ventilation in AP was a
protective factor for orotracheal intubation even after multivariable adjustment Table 4 for
confounding variables (Adjusted OR=0.39, 95%CI:0.28-0.56, p<0.0001, E-value=2.01), which
prevailed after propensity score analysis (Adjusted OR=0.32, 95%CI:0.21-0.49, p<0.0001, E8

value=2.21). Similarly, ventilation in AP was a protective factor for mortality (Adjusted
OR=0.38, 95%CI:0.25-0.57, p<0.0001, E-value=1.98, Goodness of fit: Hosmer-Lemeshow
X2=11.7, p=0.1 AUC=0.80, 95%CI:0.77-0.84, p<0.0001) even after multivariable adjustment in
propensity score analyses.

The CART model is shown in Figure 2 and the main characteristics are broken down in
Appendix 7. Of all variables, only two were statistically significant, in hierarchical order:
SpO2/FiO2 (F 97.7, p = 0.00) and PP (X2 50.5, p = 0.00), with an overall percentage of 75.2%.
The main variables associated with PP failure in AP patients were age (OR=1.02, 95%CI: 1.355.72, p=0.005), SpO2/FiO2 <100 (OR=2.78, 95%CI: 1.35-5.72, p=0.005), SpO2/FiO2 100-199
(OR=2.18, 95%CI: 1.31-3.64, p=0.003), and management with a non-rebreather mask
(OR=2.17, 95%CI: 1.34-3.49, p=0.002), Goodness of fit: Hosmer-Lemeshow X2=10.52, p=0.2;
AUC=0.70, 95%CI:0.64-0.74, p<0.0001. The distribution of risk for increases in age and
baseline SpO2/FiO2 are shown in Figure 3.
After the search of the literature, 54 records were obtained, of which only 3 studies were
comparison-group studies including both AP and AS patients for which sufficient information
was available to the overall risk for intubation, which are summarised alongside the APRONOX
study in Figure 4.

DISCUSSION

In this multicentre observational study, we aimed to evaluate the association between awake
prone positioning and orotracheal intubation, as well as predictors of failure to prone positioning
and mortality in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Even after multivariable adjustment and
propensity score analyses, prone positioning in non-intubated patients was associated with lower
intubation and mortality risk. We further developed a CART model to evaluate the relationship
between AP and intubation.

Patients in our cohort were younger (mean age 53.4 years) than those in other studies (56.065.8) (10–12); hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Mexico have been reported to be young
(18). The prevalence of comorbidities in our study is similar to that reported in a populationbased sample of Mexican patients hospitalised with COVID-19, although diabetes was more
common in our study (38.1% vs 29.2%), whereas obesity (14.4% vs 22.5%) and heart disease
(2.1% vs 4.4%) were less frequent (18).

The overall intubation rate in the APRONOX cohort was higher (30.1%) than that reported for
hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Mexico City (20.2%) (18); however, limited access to
beds with ventilators in Mexico has been reported (19). Intubation rates for patients in the
unmatched AP (23.6%) and AS (40.4%) cohorts fall within those reported in previous studies
(10–58% and 27.7–49%, respectively) (10–12). Awake prone positioning in our study was
associated with decreased intubation risk even after multivariable adjustment in both the
unmatched and propensity-score matched cohorts, with an E-value of 2.01 and 2.21,
respectively, which reflects that in order to drive this association to be non-significant, an
unmeasured risk factor should have a lower-limit confidence interval that at least doubles the
risk of the outcome between both groups. Out of all comorbidities, only diabetes and heart
disease were associated with increased intubation risk after multivariable adjustment, although
diabetes was no longer a risk factor after propensity score analysis. Baseline SpO2/FiO2 was
associated with reduced intubation risk. The mortality rate reported in our study was 19.8%,
comparable to 23.4% (12) and 27% (10) in other studies.

Regarding variables associated to failure to awake prone positioning, age, SpO2/FiO2, and the
use of a non-rebreather mask were the main variables associated. The distribution of risk for
quantitative values of age show that the risk of failure is higher with increasing ages, whereas
higher baseline SpO2/FiO2 have the lowest failure risks.
The decision rules obtained from the CART model were as follows:
1.- Regardless of sex, patients with an initial SpO2/FiO2 ratio <177.6 have a 43.5%
chance of being intubated, while patients with an initial SpO2/FiO2 ratio >177.6 have only a
15.9% chance of being intubated.

2.- Among patients with an initial SpO2/FiO2 ratio <177.6, when prone positioning is not
used, the likelihood of intubation increases to 66.4%, while PP reduces this figure to 30.8%.

Thus, when the SpO2/FiO2 ratio upon admission is under 177.6, risk of intubation is increased.
This is comparable to findings by Thompson et al., who found that the mean difference in the
intubation rate between patients with SpO2 at 95% or greater and patients with SpO2 less than
95% one hour after initiation of PP was 46% (8).

PP has been presented as one the most cost-effective strategies to treat patients with COVID-19.
In countries with limited oxygen delivery devices, and a shortage of ventilators, AP has been
routinely used to avoid intubating patients with COVID-19 (20). Nonetheless, conflicting
evidence from observational studies for AP exists.

The supine position alters pulmonary function in patients with respiratory insufficiency due to
the gravitational differences between dependent and non-dependent regions, resulting in a more
negative pleural pressure (Ppl), increasing transpulmonary pressure (TPP) in non-dependent
areas (more distension), and producing the opposite effect in dependent areas where Ppl is less
negative and TPP is lower (less distension). Ventilation in the PP causes even distribution of
TPP, favouring uniform ventilation (21). Approximately 45 years ago, PP was shown to
increase oxygenation in patients with respiratory insufficiency, primarily by improving the
ventilation-perfusion ratio (V/Q) (22).

PP has been evaluated in hospitalised patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19, having
observed improvements in SpO2 and PaO2, decreased respiratory rate (RR), decreased need for
intubation and possible reductions in mortality, in addition to being cost-free (8,23–25). As
summarised in Figure 4, only three other studies to date have evaluated intubation risk among
AP compared with AS. While Ferando et al. and Padrão et al. found no differences in intubation
risk, Jagan et al found reduced intubation risk in AP patients (10–12). The APRONOX study is
the largest study to date evaluating the effect of AP on intubation risk.

Regarding modality of ventilation, the use of a non-rebreather mask was associated with greater
risk of intubation and failure to prone positioning, whereas other modalities of ventilation were
not. There is documented evidence of the correlation between the oxygen saturation/fraction of
inspired oxygen (SaO2/FiO2) ratio and the partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen
(PaO2/FiO2) ratio, with the advantage that the SaO2/FiO2 ratio only relies on a pulse oximeter,
with no need to perform a blood gas test, thereby highlighting the value of validated costeffective strategies (14).

Unsupervised machine learning algorithms are being increasingly used in medicine as
techniques to support the development of models to improve clinical decisions. Such models
have been used in attempts to achieve early, adequate predictions of ARDS with the goal of
improving diagnosis, treatment and monitoring, using clinical and demographic data (26), or by
adding genomic information to evaluate response to treatment (27) or to identify different
phenotypes of a disease (28). Our model contributes valuable information that may be used to
decide whether to initiate PP in a patient or not. Although no statistically significant association
was found between types of O2 delivery device, it was shown that PP determines whether
intubation is needed or not, regardless of the type of device used. These prediction techniques
could serve as a guide for healthcare workers in resource-strained settings to guide decision
making (29).

Our study has the following limitations: 1) O2 delivery devices were not standardised to a
unique device; 2) the number of hours of PP varied between hospitals and patients; and 3) no
precise criteria were established to consider intubation in patients requiring IMV. Nonetheless,
this reflects how PP is used in real-world settings. The strengths of our research include: 1) this
is the largest study evaluating AP to date; 2) the large number of hospitals included; and 3) the
fact that various O2 delivery devices were employed, showing that the benefits of PP are not
necessarily unique to NIV or HFNC devices, which are costlier and not always available.

PP in spontaneously breathing patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency may be a
justifiable treatment modality, given the improvements in oxygenation and its physiological
benefits, but the decision to intubate is based on the clinician’s best judgement and intubation

should not be delayed if under consideration. Close clinical evaluation of patients is key to avoid
poor outcomes. Studies of PP in non-intubated patients are challenging and randomized
controlled trials are warranted to fully elucidate their usefulness since this is an easy to
administer, safe, and reproducible intervention (30).

CONCLUSION
PP in awake hospitalised patients with COVID-19 is associated with a lower risk of intubation
and mortality.

Appendix 6. Search strategy
We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE through OVID, PubMed, BioRxiv and MedRxiv for
research on COVID-19 published until 20 January 2021. We used the publicly available
COVID-19 Living Evidence on COVID-19 dataset (31). Search terms for the search strategy
were: (‘severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2’ [supplementary concept] OR
‘COVID-19’ [supplementary concept] OR ‘coronavirus’ OR ‘HCoV’ OR ‘nCoV’ OR ‘2019
nCoV’ OR ‘covid’ OR ‘covid19’ OR ‘severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2’ OR
‘SARS-CoV-2’ OR ‘SARS-CoV 2’ OR ‘SARS coronavirus 2’) AND (prone) AND (awake).
The following filters were applied for study design: case series, case-control study, cohort
study, trial, other, or unclassified. Studies were chosen regardless of language, provided an
abstract in English was available, and if the study included and clearly differentiated patients
undergoing awake prone positioning from those in awake supine position, as well as intubation
rates for both groups.
