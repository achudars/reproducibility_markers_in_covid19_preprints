the

during

April–May 2020 are unknown. These four have a relationship with the shape of the daily mortality
curve once one considers the intervals from infection to death or recovery. Without an understanding
of this relationship we cannot say that an earlier lockdown would have saved lives. Using a small
stochastic model, the lockdown had to be weakened, in April and May, for simulated deaths to match
ongoing actual daily deaths. Google mobility data was found to be consistent with the weakening
required in the model with similar changes from baseline in time and magnitude. If in an earlier
lockdown,

mobility

and

interactions

would

have

followed

a

similar

course,

then

with a

large

epidemic curve an earlier lockdown might be associated with many more deaths than some currently
believe. This was confirmed in the stochastic model and in two modified SIR models of epidemics of
various sizes. The first SIR model had a fixed period to recovery and the second used random
periods, both models had random periods to death. Weakening of the mitigations was required to
tune the output in large but not in small epidemics. This gives weight to the epidemic having affected
many more individuals than some reports currently suggest. In both one and two-week earlier
lockdowns,

total

deaths

were

found to depend

on

the

size of

the epidemic and to vary

from

2,000–49,000 deaths. There was a linear relationship between the peak proportion of the population
infected and the reciprocal of the case fatality rate. This work questions the low prevalence of < 0.1%,

1. Introduction
A plot of the time course of the proportion of the population who are currently infected—active
cases—is known as the epidemic curve. During mitigated Covid-19 epidemics nations have counted
deaths in different ways and the UK have altered its reporting. However, if a mortality data set has
been consistently ascertained then the shape of that data maintains some fidelity with its antecedents
and inferences may be generalisable. The principal antecedents are those elements that underly the
mechanics generating the epidemic curve and the timing and effectiveness of the mitigations and
importantly any unintended weakening of the mitigations. In the absence of a tight confidence interval
on the case fatality rate the shape, but not the size, of the epidemic curve can be estimated from the
mortality data. The size of the infected population may not be required to answer some questions.
However, it is required if one asks ‘What might have happened if the mitigations had been introduced
earlier?’ This requires an understanding of the size of the epidemic curve since the efficacy of any
weakening

in

the

mitigations

will

be

sensitive

to

the

susceptible

proportion

of

the

population.

Importantly, the size of the epidemic curve and knowing the residual susceptible population are
central to understanding the risks of a second-wave and planning relaxation of lockdown rules.

This author previously

reported a stochastic model which simulated mainly UK in-hospital

deaths [1]. That model was revised to include out-of-hospital deaths after Public Health England
(PHE) changed its reporting system in late April 2020 [2]. Subsequent but modest revisions were
issued [3]. In this work a first SIR model [A] used a fixed period to recovery of 12.8 days and PHE data
up to a revision in late June whilst the second SIR model [B] which used a random period to recovery
was tuned following a PHE revision accessed on 26 June [4].
A UK national newspaper, reported that 75% of UK Covid-19 deaths might have been avoided if
the lockdown had begun one week earlier [5]. Dagpunar, using a case fatality rate of 1%, describes a
SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Removed) model which generated 39,000 deaths for a mitigated
epidemic, reducing to around 11,000 if mitigated one week earlier, see Table 1 [6].

Table 1. Results from modeling by Dagpunar [6].
The UK introduced its lockdown when a total of 359 deaths had been reported, whilst Germany
locked down after reporting a total of 86 deaths. On 17 March there had been a total of 81 deaths in the
UK.

It

is

an

important

question

to

ask;

‘What

might

have

happened—if

all

else

remained

the

same—but the lockdown was announced at a different time?’ This work simulated earlier and later
lockdowns starting from 3–20 March 2020 using the previously described stochastic model.
In this stochastic model, just as in a SIR model, the size of the susceptible proportion of the
population at any one time influences the efficacy of an intervention, be it a mitigation or a weakening
of a lockdown. For this reason, if a set of parameters influencing a model’s behaviour are allowed to
act on a population with a substantially different susceptible proportion then their influence will also
be quite different. Caution is therefore needed in moving parametric changes earlier or later in an
epidemic if the true magnitude of the epidemic curve is not known. Early in an epidemic when
exponential growth is seen then the size of the susceptible population may be ignored but this does not
apply later on.
Though we know something of the shape of the mortality data, and from this we can infer
something of the shape of the epidemic curve, we cannot determine the magnitude of the epidemic
curve without other information. The areas under the epidemic curve and the mortality curve give us
the case fatality rate.
In this author’s previous simulations around 20% of the population were infected at the peak, but
this is higher than the consensus of current opinion. According to the Office for National Statistics
(ONS) between 17–30 May 2020, an average of 0.10% of the population in households had Covid-19
(95% CI: 0.05% to 0.18%) [9]. A second estimate between 25 May to 7 June found 0.06% (95% CI : 0.02%
to 0.12%) of the population in England had Covid-19 [7]. This second estimate was based on 11
individuals in 8 households from a total of 19,933 participants.
In this work modelling is presented for different sized epidemics. The early parameters are the
same, as the susceptible populations have not fallen sufficiently, but later parameters necessarily
differ.

A thought experiment
Though it is unlikely that the UK epidemic was initiated with a single index case we will consider
this in a simple thought experiment. If the rising phase is neither mitigated nor yet influenced by the
falling susceptible population then it is exponential, and if the doubling was every 3 days then there
would have been 25.5 days to get to 360 deaths at lockdown on 23 March placing the first death on 27
February. PHE record the first UK death on 5 March. The antecedent infections (perhaps 20 days

(CFR). If we imagine CFR’s of 1:1000 and 1:100 these place the hypothetical first cases on the 7 and 18
January respectively, see Figure 1.

Figure 1. A thought experiment is illustrated. Assuming a 3-day doubling in deaths (green) arising

from antecedent infections 20 days previously (dashed green line) producing a total of 359 deaths on 23
March the parent populations can be imagined for different case fatality rates. This crude
approximation places the start of the epidemic curves in early January.

2. Materials and Methods
Two modified SIR epidemics [A] and [B] were given start dates from 2–23 January. In [A] there
was a fixed period of 12.8 days to recovery for those becoming immune and in [B] a randomly chosen
period from two lognormal distributions. In both [A] and [B] the period to mortality was randomly
chosen. Each epidemic had its weakening tuned such that the daily mortality represented actual daily
mortality with social distancing and lockdown taking place on 17 and 24 March. Tuning was a visual
fit with one run of the model. Once tuned, each epidemic was re-run with social distancing taking
place either one or two-weeks week earlier (10 or 3 March). Lockdown likewise was earlier on the 17 or
10 March.

The stochastic model
The stochastic model has been previously described [1,2]. The model is written in Microsoft Excel
VBA v7·1 operating in Windows 10. Individuals were assigned an age, sex, risk of mortality if infected,
a measure of daily viral exposure, a susceptibility factor, an incubation period, and two contagious
periods. One contagious period was for mild illness and the other for serious, critical or fatal illness.
Each individual had a 2-dimensional location, a

status

for

symptoms,

immunity

and

a flag

for

alive/dead. Individuals had two clocks; one for an assigned contagious period and one for a virtual
twin, 80% of whom were assigned a lognormal fatal illness contagious period to represent in-hospital
deaths (meanlog 2.99, sdlog 0.223), and 20% a shorter, lognormally distributed period to represent
out-of-hospital deaths (meanlog 2.639, sdlog 0.2). The 80:20 ratio matches the PHE ascertainment of
deaths [2]. Incubation periods were based on Covid-19 data (meanlog 1.621, sdlog 0.418) [8]. Age and
sex followed the 2011 UK census. Knowing the age and sex, an individual was designated to die, if
infected, based on a probability taken from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention [9].
The demographic details do not influence the outputs reported in this paper but were maintained in
case they prove useful in later developments.
A random 5% were assigned to be critically ill, and together with the dying individuals, this
group had the longer contagious period (meanlog of 2.99, sdlog of 0.223). A random, normally

An alternative explanation is that the modelled epidemic curve was too large. This work aimed to

No single change of any one parameter, on a single date following the lockdown was sufficient to
tune the stochastic model. With two changes in the same direction on two separate days tuning was
improved. A small number of sets of parameters were then tested on three days. When applied
following the lockdown (24 March) on days 16, 23, and 33 respectively, the sets

The parametric changes used to tune the model represent a gradual but progressive weakening of
the lockdown in real life. Google mobility data [11] was examined and changes in mobility at the time
of the mitigations of 17 and 23–24 March were found. After the lockdown the percentage change from
baseline of all relevant activities was similar to the changes required for tuning the model, see Figure 4.

In Figure 4, the percentage change from baseline for UK mobility activity, for 5 domains [11], is
shown for the period of the mitigated epidemic, plotted against the left-hand axis as smoothed data. In
the Google mobility data, there is evidence of activity gradually, and progressively rising through a

M

few percentage points. On the right-hand axis, the parameter {

n

} is plotted such that a fall from 18 to

9 movements a day equates to a 50% fall in baseline activity on the left-hand axis.
Interestingly, the weakening of the lockdown which was modelled to tune the mortality output to
fit the actual daily deaths, is similar to the weakening evident in the Google mobility data.

Locking down earlier or later
A series of epidemics were simulated in the stochastic model with lockdowns starting on different
days between 10 March and 1 April. Social distancing was initiated 7 days before each lockdown and
the lockdown was weakened in three steps as described above. The total mortality is plotted against
the day of the lockdown (not the introduction of social distancing) and appears in Figure 5.

Figure 5. Simulated total deaths from 40 epidemics for lockdowns starting on different days, each with

social distancing introduced 1 week earlier and weakening of the lockdown as described. This was
output from the stochastic model with social distancing starting with S=91%. The peak in infections
was about 20%.
In Figure 5 the distribution of data points suggests that an earlier lockdown may not have been
associated with fewer deaths, but this is in the context of a significant epidemic curve .

With a late start and a small epidemic curve, the mortality was a good fit without any weakening

curve increased then weakening of the mitigations was required to tune the mortality data.

The parameters required to weaken each of the epidemics were compared with Google mobility
data. The comparison is a challenge as we are comparing different phenomena. In Figure 11, Google
mobility data is shown with smoothed data as % change from baseline on the left-hand axis for a
number of domains. We cannot combine these curves, but together, they give an indication of the
depth and timing of changes in activity. On the right-hand axis, with  = 0.023 being the base line and
the scale logarithmic, the values for weakening of the mitigations are plotted for epidemics A2–A11 in
Model [A].

A simple stochastic model of the mitigated UK Covid-19 epidemic was developed to simulate
daily mortality data and test assumptions about the mechanics of the epidemic and its mitigations.
Actual daily deaths started to exceed the mean of simulations and a weakening of the lockdown was
hypothesised. With modest but progressive changes in parameters, the model was successfully tuned.
The timing and percentage change in the model’s baseline movement parameter was similar to
changes published by Google for UK mobility data over the same period.
The principal reason for modelling is to test one’s assumptions about how the real-world works.
One may learn more from a failing model than from a model that, by good fortune, produces output
that happens to simulate the real world. Models can be criticised if they become over-elaborate or
over-parametised or if they are tweaked, simply to produce a desired output. The stochastic model,
with its large epidemic curve was tuned to bring its simulated deaths into line with actual deaths by
weakening earlier mitigating parameters as the epidemic curve progressed. The impact of the
parametric changes on the epidemic curve were necessarily sensitive to the proportion of the
population who were susceptible at the time of the change and thereafter. For this reason, advancing
or delaying parametric changes had a marked impact on the epidemic curves. Furthermore, it is clear
that a small epidemic that is swiftly mitigated, and which barely reduces the susceptible proportion,
will be less sensitive to later changes in those parameters compared to larger epidemics which
dramatically reduce the susceptible population. If one is to ask about the impact of moving the
lockdown on a mitigated epidemic that has weakened, it is crucial to understand the size of the
epidemic curve and something about the weakening.
The stochastic model might be considered to have naive parameters making it a poor
approximation for human behaviour but the step-wise changes that were introduced to reshape the
mortality data have some similarity to real-world changes seen in Google mobility data. If the
stochastic model’s parameters are considered naïve then modelling with  and particularly are
clearly far more abstract. In the SIR model , has some statistical mechanical elegance in that it relates
to a reasonable real-word understanding of the probability of spread of a contagious disease but is
for the same reasons far less attractive. It is for this reason that the fall in , in Model [B], was modelled
by Ψ .
The modified SIR model that generated an epidemic curve with an average of 0.1% of the
population infected between 17-30 May, in line with the ONS figures, was so small that the CFR was
1:26 which seems far too low a figure. The largest modified SIR epidemics had peaks around 20%,
close to the stochastic model, and required a significant weakening of the mitigation. For the SIR
models this weakening was considered to be more marked than that found in the Google mobility
data. Though there is no simple way of determining a relationship between  and mobility, except in
direction and time, it was felt that epidemics with peak infections between 8–14% and CFR’s 1:300–500
were most likely to share the weakening found in Google’s data.
If the susceptible proportion of the population in early July is as high as this work requires for
consistency with the ONS data, or for consistency with a CFR of around 100, then the risks of a
second-wave are very high. If the susceptible proportion of the population in early July is lower and
consistent with a larger epidemic curve and a lower CFR then the risks of a second-wave are lower.
