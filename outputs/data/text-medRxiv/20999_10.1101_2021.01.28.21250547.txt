Abstract
Background: The adult social care sector is being increasingly outsourced to for-profit providers,
but the impacts of privatisation on service quality and resident outcomes are unclear. During the
COVID-19 pandemic, for-profit providers have been accused of failing their residents by
prioritising profits over care, prevention, and caution, which has been reported to result in a higher
prevalence of COVID-19 infections and deaths in for-profit care homes. Although many of these
reports are anecdotal or based on news reports, there is a growing body of academic research
investigating ownership variation across COVID-19 outcomes, which has not been systematically
appraised and synthesised.
Objectives: To identify, appraise, and synthesise the available research on ownership variation in
COVID-19 outcomes (outbreaks, infections, deaths, shortage of personal protective equipment
(PPE) and staff) across for-profit, public, and non-profit care homes for older people, and to update
our findings as new research becomes available.
Design: Living systematic review.
Methods: This review was prospectively registered with Prospero (CRD42020218673). We searched
17 databases and performed forward and backward citation tracking of all included studies. Search
results were screened and reviewed in duplicate. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed in duplicate
according to the COSMOS-E guidance. The results were synthesised according to RoB, model
adjustment, and country context and visualised using harvest plots.
Results: Twenty-eight studies across five countries were included, with 75% of included studies
conducted in the Unites States. For-profit ownership was not consistently associated with a higher
probability of COVID-19 outbreaks across included studies. However, there was compelling
evidence of worse COVID-19 outcomes following an outbreak; with for-profit care homes having
higher rates of accumulative infections and deaths. For-profit providers were also associated with
shortages in PPE, which may have contributed to the higher incidence of infections and deaths.
Chain affiliation was often found to be correlated with higher risk of outbreaks, but not consistently
associated with an elevated number of deaths and infections. Private equity ownership was not
consistently associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes.
Conclusion: For-profit status was a consistent risk factor for higher cumulative COVID-19
infections and deaths. Thus, ownership among providers may be a key modifiable factor which can
be regulated to improve health outcomes in vulnerable populations and reduce health disparities.
This review will be updated as new research becomes published, which may change the conclusion
of our synthesis.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected people living in residential care, who are
estimated to account for approximately half of all COVID-19 deaths 1–3. This disproportionate
impact can be understood, in part, in terms of the vulnerability of people residing in such facilities
and a lack of early intervention and support 4. However, the structural and institutional risk factors
are not yet well understood. In many countries, adult social care services are delivered by a
combination of for-profit, non-profit, and public providers 5. While it is well documented that quasimarket provision has increased the market share of private, and in particular, for-profit care
providers 6,7, it is unclear if this provision design has improved service quality. The question of
whether ownership influences quality of care across different provider types is well researched. For
example, a 2009 systematic review of 82 studies on ownership variation among nursing homes
showed that non-profit providers typically delivered higher quality services compared to for-profit
providers8; a finding that has since been replicated 6,7,9.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, for-profit providers have been accused of failing their residents
by prioritising profits over care, prevention, and caution 10, resulting in reports of higher rates of
COVID-19 infections and deaths in for-profit care homes 11,12. Although many of these reports are
not peer-reviewed – located, for example, in newspaper publications – there is a growing body of
academic research that investigates ownership variation across COVID-19 outcomes, such as
outbreaks, infection rates, and mortality 13,14.
The COVID-19 pandemic has tested the capability of not only individual social care providers, but
also the commissioning system in which they operate. It is known that funding for adult social care
has been characterised by years of austerity 15 at the expense of staffing, quality, and support, which
may have been detrimental to the ability of care homes to cope with the pandemic 16. As such, the
experiences of the adult social care sector during the pandemic must not be forgotten, and the
growing body of research on ownership variation across COVID-19 outcomes offers an important
opportunity to revisit the impact of outsourcing social care services to FP providers.
Research Question/objectives:
The aim of this living systematic review is to identify, appraise, and synthesise the available research
on ownership variation in outbreaks and infections across for-profit, public, and non-profit care
homes for older people, and to update our findings as new research becomes available. A review
protocol was registered prospectively on OSF 17 and on Prospero (CRD42020218673).
Methods
COVID-19 related research is published at a high frequency and the time between submission and
publication is substantially shorter than for non-COVID-19 research18, which makes it particularly
important that this rapidly growing body of evidence is critically appraised and systematically
synthesised regularly. To ensure that this review will represent a recent and relevant synthesis of the
available evidence on the topic, it will be conducted as a living systematic review, which is defined as
“a systematic review that is continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available” 19.
Specifically, we plan to update our results every 3 months for the first year of publication and twice
in the second year. An update will entail (1) running the below search string for the time period, and
(2) forward and backward citation tracking of included studies. Any studies added throughout this
process will be incorporated in the review and the synthesis, results, and interpretation will be
adapted accordingly.

Inclusion criteria

We assessed study eligibility based on three criteria. First, studies must investigate variation in
COVID-19 outbreaks, infection rates, and/or excess or COVID-19 related mortalities or outcomes
related to personal protective equipment (PPE) use and availability, staff shortage, preparedness, and
infection and mortality among staff and visitors. Second, studies must investigate variation in any of
the above outcomes across ownership categories, which is conventionally understood as for-profit,
non-profit, and public providers. However, ‘ownership’ is often understood and interpreted in
different ways and in the below section we specify how we define this concept. Third, studies must
employ an observational research design, including, but not limited to, cross-sectional studies,
cohort studies, and secondary analyses of registry data. Both published and unpublished manuscripts
(e.g., preprints and reports) were eligible for inclusion.
A note on ownership terminology
The literature on ownership variation is characterised by inconsistent and variable terminology, and
terms such as ‘for-profit’, ‘non-profit’, ‘private’, ‘chain affiliated’, and ‘public’ are rarely clearly
defined. In consequence, original ownership archetypes such as for-profit and non-profit are often
merged as ‘private’ providers, while public (e.g. government or local authority providers) and nonprofit (registered private not-for-profit) providers are often categorised as ‘non-profits’. Table 1
displays our definition of different ownership terms and outlines how these overlap.
Table 1: Ownership categorisation and overlap.
Ownership categories
Definition
Traditional ownership archetypes
For-profit
Private profit pursuing providers of
social care. This usually includes
both individually owned,
partnerships, and corporate
providers.
Non-profit
Private not-for-profit providers of
social care. These providers are
usually registered as charities.
Public

Alternative ownership categories
Private
Multifacility chain affiliation
Private equity owned

Care providers operated and
organised by government bodies and
employees. These providers are
usually operated at the municipal,
council, or local authority level.
Providers that are privately owned,
including both for-profit and nonprofit providers.
Providers that are part of a multilocation chain of social care facilities.
Providers that have been
acquisitioned by private equity firms.

Potential overlap
This term may include chain
affiliated and private equity owned
providers. For-profits and nonprofit providers are sometimes
categorised as private providers.
This term may include chain
affiliated providers. For-profits and
non-profit providers are sometimes
categorised as private providers.
Public and non-profit providers are
often categorised as not-for-profit
providers.

This may include for-profit, nonprofit, chain affiliated, and private
equity providers.
This may include both for-profit,
private equity, and non-profit
providers.
This may include for-profit and
chain affiliated providers.

Important nuances are lost by not defining ownership consistently, which is a challenge in this
review (as it has been in previous reviews 8). Yet, since the objective of this review is to appraise and
synthesise research on ownership variation, we consider any definition of ownership. However, all

categorisations are scrutinised, and our results incorporate different conceptualisations where
applicable.

Searches and screening process

Before developing our search strategy, we hand-searched Google Scholar and preprint repositories
for relevant articles and performed citation searches on all relevant articles. This preliminary sample
of includable studies were used to design our search strategy and to test its specificity. The full
search strategy can be found in the supplementary material. Our search string was implemented in
the following databases: ABI/INFORM Global, Coronavirus Research Database, Criminology
Collection International (criminal justice database and NCJRS abstracts database), International
Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS), Politics Collection (PAIS index, policy file index, political
science database, and worldwide political science abstracts), Social Science Database, Sociology
Collection (applied social science index and abstracts, sociological abstracts, and sociology database)
via ProQuest. We searched Embase, Global Health, Medline, and PsycINFO via Ovid. Two authors
(ABM and MDE) double-screened all search results using Rayyan and subsequently reviewed the full
text versions of potentially eligible studies. We undertook a citation search of all studies included as
a result of the screening and full-text reviewing.

Data extraction, (selection and coding)

Descriptive information on the citation details (author, title, journal) and study characteristics
(research design, analysis, sample details) were retrieved from all included articles. We also extracted
detailed information on the data (e.g., country, source, and period of data coverage) and the
outcome and exposure variables (e.g., definition, operationalisation, and cut-offs). The results related
to ownership variation across COVID-19 related outcomes and accompanying interpretations were
extracted for all studies. The results were extracted by ABM with feedback from BV and MDE.

Risk of bias assessment

Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using the COSMOS-E guidance 20. We employed this guidance
rather than, for example, ROBINS-I for non-randomised intervention studies, as it is specifically
designed for systematically reviewing observational and correlational research. Specifically, we
evaluated the following bias domains: confounding, selection bias, and information bias. In line with
the consistent recommendation to avoid quantitative scoring of risk domains20,21, all RoB
assessments were based on the qualitative subjective assessment of the reviewers, which were
decided through discussion and in consensus. All assessments were conducted with the focus of our
review (variation in COVID-19 outcomes across ownership) in mind, and the assessments may thus
not represent the risk of bias across other investigated associations and outcomes. The overall RoB
assessment for each study was based on the lowest assessment in any bias domain. We did not
exclude studies based on the RoB assessments.

Data synthesis

Due to a high degree of heterogeneity among the included studies in terms of differing model
specifications, operationalisation of outcomes, inconsistent ownership categorisation of the
reference group, and overlapping data, we did not perform a statistical meta-analysis of the included
results. This decision was made with attention to the pitfalls of employing statistical methods and
assumptions designed for the analysis of very homogenous data or randomised controlled trials of
interventions to observational and correlational research 22. If appropriate, we may, however, metaanalyse the results in later versions of this living review. In this version, our synthesis can be

described as follows.
First, we narratively summarised key characteristics of the included studies, such as publication type,
sample details, ownership categorisation, and data sources. Second, we assessed the risk of bias across
all included studies. Third, we developed an overview of the outcomes and model adjustments of all
included studies. The model adjustment categories were developed according to aspects known to
influence the relationship between ownership and care homes. Fourth, we constructed a harvest plot
to graphically illustrate the direction of the results across different outcomes and ownership
categories with attention to the model specifications and risk of bias of the studies supporting a
particular direction of effect 23. Harvest plots serve as a way to synthesise and describe a
heterogenous body of evidence, which cannot be meaningfully synthesised by means of metaanalysis. Last, we thematically analysed the text of all studies that discuss and interpret results
relating to ownership.
Results

Search results

Our search strategy yielded 3,845 results, of which 3,514 were left after removal of duplicates. These
were double-screened by ABM and MDE, after which 81 were assessed in full-text. Of these, 19
studies were deemed eligible for inclusion. A citation search was then conducted on this sample, in
which an additional 9 eligible studies (primarily preprints and government reports) were identified.
Twenty-eight studies were thus included in the first version of this review.
[Figure 1 here]

Description of studies

The descriptive information on all included research can be found in Table 2. Most of the included
studies were peer-reviewed publications (22/28), with 2 government reports 24,25 and 4 preprints or
working papers. The unit of analysis across all included studies was care homes. For-profit providers
were the largest ownership group across all studies that provided detailed sample information. All
except for two studies 26,27 were published in July and after. The majority of studies were conducted
in the United States (21/28), followed by Canada (3/28), England (2/28), Scotland (1/28), and
France (1/28). Most of the studies were cross-sectional in nature, as only three studies included
more than one time-point in their analysis 28–30.
The most common way ownership was categorised was to compare for-profit (FP) and non-profit
(NP) providers (16/28), usually with FPs as the reference category. Ten studies compared FPs and
NPs (11/28), in which NPs included both private NPs and public providers, although this was not
always explicitly described. Two studies focused on private equity (PE) providers in their
categorisation of ownership 31,32. Eighteen studies also included chain affiliated (CA) providers as a
separate covariate to investigate COVID-19 related outcomes.
The most commonly investigated outcome was COVID-19 outbreaks (15/28), followed by
COVID-19 related mortality (13/28), and incidence of COVID-19 infections (12/28). Five studies
investigated staff access to PPE and/or shortage of PPE. Three studies included investigated
COVID-19 related outcomes among care home staff. Most studies investigated multiple COVID-19
related outcomes.

Data sources
Most of the included research merged multiple data sources across COVID-19 outcomes,
information on the care facilities, and area characteristics to construct their dataset. Less than 15%
of included studies (4/28) collected primary data on the investigated COVID-19 outcomes. The
majority of studies used data routinely reported by care homes to public health departments and
other government-collected data. Almost a third of the included studies (9/28) used data from the
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), who require American nursing homes to report
COVID-19 related data, including confirmed and suspected infections and deaths among residents
and staff 50 from May 24. Providers were encouraged, but not required, to retrospectively self-report
COVID-19 outcomes before this date. Table A1 in the supplementary material provides an
overview of the data sources and the time period of the dependent variables across all included
studies.

Risk of bias assessments

The RoB assessments are detailed in Table A2 in the supplementary material. The main concerns
related to systematic missing data and selection bias in the included studies. For example, studies
that investigated the characteristics of care homes excluded from the CMS dataset (due to missing or
incomplete data) found that such facilities were more likely to be FPs and also correlated to many
risk factors, such as the ethnicity and socio-economic status of residents (discussed in detail below)
29,41,43,45. This is a potentially serious limitation of the studies using this data (for the purpose of this
review), as it suggests that poorly performing FPs may be systematically underrepresented in the
sample, which may underestimate the observed effect of ownership on COVID-19 outcomes.
Because of this limitation, all studies using this dataset were downgraded to (at least) moderate risk.
For all studies using public and government data, we assumed the risk of information bias to be low.
All assessments of the risk of bias of confounding were based on consideration of factors known to
exacerbate the effect of COVID-19 51,52 and the performance of care homes for older people 6,7.
Almost all studies adjusted for the size of the care homes (24/28), and characteristics on quality and
staffing were also commonly included. Nineteen studies adjusted for the ethnic composition and
17/28 included information about the socio-economic status of residents. Rurality and/or
population density was included in 11/28 of the studies. See Table A3 in the supplementary material
for details on the direction of effect and model adjustment of all included studies.

Direction of effects

Figure 2 displays the direction of effect for all included studies across different ownership and
outcome categories. Bar height indicates overall risk of bias (with taller bars indicating lower RoB)
and colour denotes study context. See Figure A1 in the supplementary material for a harvest plot on
the direction of effect across different data sources and Table A4 for details on the confidence of
each finding.
In most studies investigating outbreaks (11/14), FP status was not associated with a higher risk of
outbreak, suggesting that FP providers were not more or less likely to have at least one infected
resident. The evidence on COVID-19 incidence was mixed – though most of the studies found FP
providers to be associated with a higher number of cumulative COVID-19 infections. This direction
of effect (i.e., positive effect) was consistent across multiple contexts, including the US, England and
Canada. Null effects were only reported in US studies.

Higher rates of COVID-19 related deaths were consistently associated with FP status in Canadian
and US contexts. Five studies using state data in the US and in England did not find a positive
effect. However, the study conducted in England only investigated variation in the probability of
having at least 1 COVID-19 related death and did not analyse variation in the cumulative numbers
of deaths 30. Studies using CMS data usually reported a statistically significant relationship between
FP and mortality, which was less frequently identified in studies using data from individual states.
Studies conducted in Canada generally found FP status to be associated with a higher incidence of
infections and deaths among residents, whereas the direction of effect was mixed in the English
studies 27,36,49.
All studies that investigated PPE outcomes found FP status to be positively associated with
insufficient access to or shortage of PPE 29,32,35,45. FP status was not consistently associated with
staffing shortages.
[Figure 2 here]
Chain status was often correlated with a higher likelihood of COVID-19 outbreaks, but not with a
higher incidence of infections. Five studies from Canada, England, and the US found chain
affiliation to be associated with a higher incidence of COVID-19 deaths, but most studies that
included this variable did not identify any statistically significant variation. The one Canadian study
that investigated this category found CA to be associated with higher incidence and mortality 36. The
two studies conducted in England did not identify any variation in outbreaks and incidence across
chain status 49, but one found CA to be associated with higher risk of at least one COVID-19 deaths
among residents 30.
Care homes owned by private equity (PE) firms were not found to be consistently associated with
worse outcomes than other ownership categories, and one study even found PE providers to be less
likely to report PPE shortages and confirmed COVID-19 outbreaks 32.
Evidence on the relationship between ownership variation and risk of infection among staff was
scarce, with only three studies investigating this population. In England, FP status was associated
with a higher risk of infection among staff 49, but there was no difference for CA providers. The two
studies conducted in the US did not identify any statistically significant variation related to FP status,
but one study found CA status to be correlated with a higher risk of infection and deaths among
staff 32.

Indirect ownership effects

In most studies, ownership was treated as a covariate for model adjustment, and the specific results
relating to this variable were not often directly discussed and interpreted. In the studies which
discussed the implications of ownership (16/28), the most common theme involved reflections
about mediating pathways through which for-profit status indirectly influenced COVID-19
outcomes.
Importantly, FPs were more likely to report PPE shortages 29,31,45, which was interpreted by some to
mean that this provider type was less willing to challenge the financial bottom-line by making
additional investments, even during a pandemic 13,29. Yet private equity did not report PPE shortages
31,32, raising questions about whether the profit motive is the main driving factor. FP providers were
more likely to be affiliated with corporate chains, which was reported by some to mediate the effect

of FP status on COVID-19 outcomes. For example, one Canadian study found the effect of FP
status to dissipate when controlling for chain status, which was interpreted by the authors to mean
that CA mediates the effect of FP status on COVID-19 36. The only study that controlled for union
membership among care homes did not find FP status to influence COVID-19 deaths.
FP facilities were also more likely to be larger (in terms of number of served clients)13, to serve
minority groups and people on Medicaid 41, to have lower quality ratings and a history of regulatory
deficiencies 24,40, and to be more crowded 27. This multicollinearity between ownership and important
mediating characteristics may have biased the observed correlations, in that most of these factors are
known to influence COVID-19 outcomes. However, a substantial body of studies with low to
moderate risk of bias identified a significant difference across ownership, even when controlling for
these characteristics 47, indicating a direct effect of ownership independent of mediating variables.
Importantly, this direction of effect is consistent with previous research on care quality and FP
ownership 8,53. See Figures A2-A3 in the supplementary material for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
of the hypothesised relationships between ownership, risk factors, and COVID-19 outcomes.
Discussion

Summary of findings

Our synthesis and critical appraisal of 28 studies suggests that FP ownership is not consistently
associated with a higher probability of COVID-19 outbreaks. Yet, there is compelling evidence
suggesting that the consequences of outbreaks, in terms of cumulative infections and deaths, may be
exacerbated by FP ownership. The finding that FP providers are consistently associated with PPE
shortages, may help to explain why these care homes suffer from higher rates of infections and
deaths following a COVID-19 outbreak – because these care homes were often ill-prepared and
underequipped.
However, there are other factors that may instead be mediating this relationship, as FP status is
associated with other risk factors, such as resident ethnicity, socio-economic status, low quality
ratings, and facility size.
Chain affiliation was often found to be correlated with higher risk of outbreaks, but was not
consistently associated with elevated numbers of infections. There was some evidence
demonstrating a higher incidence of COVID-19 deaths among chain affiliated providers. PE
ownership was not consistently associated with inferior COVID-19 outcomes.

Implications

The findings of this review highlight the importance of ownership in accounting for poor COVID19 outcomes across care homes. It is known that the adult social care sector found itself exceedingly
exposed in the beginning of the pandemic 54, in large part due to delayed government support and
intervention, but also as a result of many years of political and financial neglect 10. With this review,
we do not suggest that the challenges faced by care homes during the pandemic can (or should) be
understood through the lens of ownership alone (as illustrated in the Figures A2-A3 in the
supplementary material). It is clear that providers of all types have faced severe challenges, which
cannot be reduced to ownership status. However, outsourcing to for-profit providers has become
the status-quo in many care markets, often based on the rationale that open market competition will
optimise the functioning of these facilities. This claim has been extensively criticised and is not
supported by empirical work 6–8,53,55. This review adds to this evidence base by systematically
appraising and synthesising the available research on how the consequences of the COVID-19

pandemic in care homes has varied by their ownership status. Although our results represent
multiple national settings, most of the included research was conducted the US due to the availability
of the national CMS dataset. Efforts are currently being made in the UK to create a similar type of
systematic, live, and linked dataset on care homes 56, which is an important endeavour if the
consequences of this pandemic are to be understood and addressed going forward.

Limitations

Our findings should be interpreted in light of certain caveats, most of which relate to the
characteristics of the included studies. First, most studies were conducted in the US and Canada and
relied on CMS data, which means that (1) the results primarily relate to North America, and (2) there
may be overlap in the analysed data across certain studies. Second, the body of included research
was too heterogenous to be meaningfully meta-analysed and this version of the review thus
represents a critical appraisal and narrative synthesis conducted in line with best practice standards
20,57. Last, throughout our risk of bias assessments, we assumed that the reporting of COVID-19
outcomes was not systematically related to ownership. However, there is some suggestive evidence
of a longer turnaround period for resident test results among for-profit providers 58, which if
generally true, may bias the effect of FP status towards the null due to underreporting.
Conclusion and future research
This review constitutes the first version of a living appraisal and synthesis of evidence on ownership
variation across COVID-19 outcomes. It will be updated as new research becomes available, which
may change the conclusion of our synthesis. Based on our synthesis of the available research, we
find FP status to be a consistent and credible risk factor of higher cumulative COVID-19 infections
and deaths. Therefore, ownership among care home providers may be a key regulatable factor that
can be addressed to improve health outcomes in vulnerable populations and reduce health
disparities. Going forward, we hope future research will incorporate other national contexts and
clearly define their ownership categories of interest.

Figure 1: Prisma flow diagram.
Figure 2: Harvest plot on the direction of effect across ownership, risk of bias, and study context.
Bar height indicates overall risk of bias and colour denotes study context. Positive and negative effects
are understood as associations in either directions that are statistically significant at the 5% level.
Note that positive effects refer to elevated COVID-19 outcome values. Null effect is understood as
differences that are not statistically significant at the 5% level. Outbreaks usually refer to the
presence of any COVID-19 infections, except for one study that defined outbreaks as at least two
cases 24. COVID-19 incidence usually refers to the cumulative number of COVID-19 infections, but
also includes binary outcomes on large outbreaks (e.g. 44,49). COVID-19 mortality usually refers to
cumulative cases, except for one study which used a binary indicator of at least 6 deaths 26, and
another which analysed a dichotomised outcome of any number of deaths vs no deaths 30.
