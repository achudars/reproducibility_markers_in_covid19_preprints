Abstract
Background: Frequently SARS-CoV-2 results in mild or moderate disease with
potentially lower concentrations of antibodies compared to those that are
hospitalised. Here, we validated an ELISA using SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike
glycoprotein, with targeted detection of IgG, IgA and IgM (IgGAM) using serum and
dried blood spots (DBS) from adults with mild or moderate disease.
Methods: Targeting the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike, a combined anti-IgG, IgA and
IgM serology ELISA assay was developed using 62 PCR-confirmed nonhospitalised, mild or moderate COVID-19 samples, >14 days post symptom onset
and 624 COVID-19 negative samples. The assay was validated using 73 PCRconfirmed non-hospitalised COVID-19 and 359 COVID-19 negative serum samples
with an additional 81 DBSs, and further validated in 226 PCR-confirmed nonhospitalised COVID-19 and 426 COVID-19 negative clinical samples.
Results: A sensitivity and specificity of 98.6% (95% CI, 92.6–100.0), 98.3% (95%
CI, 96.4–99.4), respectively, was observed following validation of the SARS-CoV-2
ELISA. No cross-reactivities with endemic coronaviruses or other human viruses
were observed, and no change in results were recorded for interfering substances.
The assay was stable at temperature extremes and components were stable for 15
days once opened. A matrix comparison showed DBS to correlate with serum
results. Clinical validation of the assay reported a sensitivity of 94.7% (95% CI, 90.997.2%) and a specificity of 98.4% (95% CI, 96.6-99.3%).
Conclusions: The human anti-IgGAM SARS-CoV-2 ELISA provides accurate and
sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in non-hospitalised adults with mild or

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic resulting from severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was declared an international public health
emergency in early 2020 (1). Unlike previous coronavirus infection outbreaks, such
as SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, the lack of rapid, overt
symptomatic presentation in 80% of patients (2, 3), has meant seroconversion rather
than molecular testing has become an established method to understand SARSCoV-2 epidemiology.
Asymptomatic or even mild infection cases represent a challenge for in vitro SARSCoV-2 diagnostic assays, both in terms of understanding the required sensitivity and
specificity (4), and for obtaining samples from molecular tested positive patients. In
addition, as seroconversion to different immunoglobulin types is not a synchronous
process, testing of the major humoral immune system components may be
preferable to limiting assessment to individual isotypes such as IgG, IgA & IgM
(IgGAM).
Here we describe the validation of an ELISA, utilising recombinant SARS-CoV-2
trimeric spike glycoprotein (5, 6), with targeted detection of IgG, IgA and IgM
antibodies in non-hospitalised adults with mild or moderate disease.
Materials & Methods
Samples
Serum and Dried Blood Spot (DBS) samples were collected from consenting nonhospitalised polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive adults, presenting with mild or
moderate symptoms of COVID-19 disease, >14 days post symptom onset, and from
individuals COVID-19 negative (7, 8). Serum samples were stored at -20°C and
thawed before analysis.

Residual anonymised samples were used in this study from several sources. For the
specificity and sensitivity analysis residual samples were from commercial sources
(BioIVT, approved by Western Institutional Review Board - IRB20161665; TCS
Bioscience approved by The Diagnostics Investigational Review Board- IRB11201501.1; anonymised normal samples provided by Plasma Services Group were
collected with patient consent via an FDA registered blood establishment
(registration number 3005275238)) and further residual samples collected in
accordance with REC 2002/201; South Birmingham Research Ethics Service. For
dried blood spot comparison, residual anonymised samples were collected from
University of Birmingham (REC 2002/201; South Birmingham Research Ethics
Service). For cross reactivity analysis, samples were provided by the Amsterdam
University Medical Center of the University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands
(approved by the Medical Ethics Committee; MEC 07/182MEC 07/182).Samples
were used in accordance with the world medical association declaration of Helsinki
Ethical principles for Medical Research involving human subjects.
ELISA
A stabilised trimeric spike protein preparation with 95% purity (6), assessed by silver
stain, was coated onto ELISA plates (Nunc High Bind, Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Loughborough, UK) at 1.0 µg/ml in PBS for 24hr. Plates were blocked using 2%
BSA blocking reagent (Sigma, Gillingham, UK) prepared in PBS-0.1% Tween 20 and
incubated for 1hr at room temperature. Subsequently, plates were washed three
times with PBS-1% Tween + 0.08% Proclin300 and air dried before packing in
airtight in aluminium-coated packs with drying agent (IDS, Gateshead, UK).
High, low, negative and cut-off calibrator controls were generated using COVID-19
negative pooled normal human and specific human monoclonal IgG1, IgA and IgM

anti-SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein (CR3022, Absolute Antibodies, Upper Heyford, UK)
(9). 100 µl of either the controls (neat dilution), calibrator (neat dilution) or serum
samples (diluted 1/40) were added to the coated plate and incubated for 30 minutes
at room temperature. The plate was then washed three times with PBS-0.1% Tween
and purified horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labelled polyclonal rabbit antibody to
human IgG, IgA, IgM (DAKO, USA) (100 µl) was added to each well and then
incubated for a further 30 minutes at room temperature (RT). The plate was washed
a further three times and substrate solution containing 3,3’5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine
(100 µl, Surmodics Inc, Eden Prairie, MN, USA) was added to each well and then
incubated at RT in the dark for 10 minutes. The reaction was stopped by the addition
of phosphoric acid (100 µl) and the plate read at 450nm using an automated liquid
handler (Dynex Technologies, USA).
Pilot study: sensitivity, specificity and cut-off co-efficient
COVID-19 negative samples (n=624, median 63 years of age, range 18-98) and
PCR-confirmed non-hospitalised, mild or moderate COVID-19 samples, >14 days
post-symptom onset (n=62, median 44 years of age, range 19-63) were analysed
using the human anti-IgGAM SARS-CoV-2 ELISA. The cut-off coefficient was
determined, and the clinical study powered.
Validation of the manufacturing process
Sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA
Sensitivity and specificity of the human anti-IgGAM SARS-CoV-2 ELISA was
assessed using COVID-19 negative serum samples (n=359), and PCR-confirmed
non-hospitalised, mild or moderate COVID-19 samples (n=73), >14 days post
symptom onset.

Precision of the ELISA
Precision was measured in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute guidelines EP12-A2 (10). Forty COVID-19 negative serum samples
replicates were spiked (<1%) with specific human monoclonal IgG1 anti- SARS-CoV2 S glycoprotein (CR3022), at C5, C50 and C95. The C50 level was defined as a
response of 1.0, C5 0.8 and C95 1.2, +/- 5% of the target response. Acceptance
criteria was defined as, C5: ≥36 negatives out of 40 replicates; C50: 14-26 positives
out of 40 replicates; C95: ≥36 positives out of 40 replicates. The coefficient of
variation (% CV) was additionally calculated for each cut-off.
Interference with the ELISA
Interference analysis was performed by spiking haemoglobin (2000 mg/L), bilirubin
(200 mg/L), triglyceride (3000 mg/L) into quintuplicate serum samples that were
either antibody positive or antibody negative, (normal human serum spiked
with/without CR3022). Controls were generated by spiking samples with equivalent
volumes of saline. The assay was deemed to have passed the interference
assessment if there was no change in the reportable value following the addition of
the interfering agent.
Cross reactivity of the ELISA with other respiratory diseases
Cross-reactivity of the assay was assessed in patients with known respiratory
diseases; endemic coronaviruses (n=11), influenza and parainfluenza (n=14),
enteroviruses (n=5), Epstein Bar virus (n=4), adenovirus (n=1) or respiratory
syncytial virus (n=4). Positive cross-reactivity was identified if the cut-off index value
was >1.

Stability of the ELISA
Extremes of temperature stability was determined in triplicate following 24 hour
storage at either 37°C or -20°C. Open vial stability was assessed over 15 days with 5
day interval sampling. Briefly, ELISAs were opened in parallel and components recapped and stored at 4°C.
Dried blood spot versus serum samples
Paired DBS and serum samples (49 PCR-confirmed non-hospitalised, mild or
moderate COVID-19 samples and 32 COVID-19 negative samples), were assayed
using the human anti-IgGAM SARS-CoV-2 ELISA. Capillary blood samples (50 µl
per spot) were collected onto 226 grade forensic collection cards (Ahlstrom Munksjo,
Germany). Individual 12 mm diameter pre-perforated DBS spots were isolated using
a sterile pipette tip and placed into a universal tube at a ratio of one spot to 250 µL
0.05% PBS Tween-20 (Sigma). Tubes were briefly vortexed and incubated overnight
at room temperature. DBS eluate was subsequently harvested into a microtube and
centrifuged at 10,600 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature and stored at 4ºC until
used (11). DBS samples were applied to the assay at a 1 in 4 dilution, resulting in a
1 in 40 overall dilution. Results were analysed using Bland Altman, Passing-Bablok
and Cohen’s kappa statistic.
Clinical study
COVID-19 negative (n=426) and PCR-confirmed non-hospitalised, mild or moderate
COVID-19 samples (n=226), > 14 days post symptom onset, were assayed using the
human anti-IgGAM SARS-CoV-2 ELISA.
Statistics
All graphs and statistical analysis were generated using Graph Pad Prism statistical
software version 5.04 or Analyse-it® for Microsoft Excel. Assay validation sensitivity,

specificity and precision (95% CI and % CVs) were calculated using Analyse-it. The
matrix comparison was analysed using Bland-Altman, Passing Bablok and Cohen’s
kappa statistics (Analyse-it). To achieve an expectant 98%, minimum 93%,
sensitivity in the clinical study, a 90% power with 5% alpha error was determined
from the pilot study. A p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Pilot study to determine sensitivity, specificity and cut-off co-efficient of the
ELISA
The pilot study with 624 COVID-19 negative and 62 PCR-confirmed nonhospitalised, mild or moderate COVID-19 samples, which were at least 14 days from
symptom onset were analysed on the human anti-IgGAM SARS-CoV-2 ELISA. The
ELISA output result was reported as a ratio to the cut-off calibrator (run in parallel)
and multiplied by the cut-off co-efficient, which was also determined from the pilot
study and would maintain batch-to-batch consistency, defined here as 1.15. A
sensitivity of 98.5 % (95% CI 91.8-100%) and specificity of 97.6% (95% CI 96.198.7%) was achieved, (Table 1 & Figure 1).
From the pilot study a minimum of 167 PCR-confirmed non-hospitalised, mild or
moderate COVID-19 samples, >14 days post symptom onset would be required for
the clinical study to determine whether the ELISA test delivered the expected
sensitivity of 98% (minimum of 93%) with an alpha error of 5% and power of 90%.
Validation of the manufacturing process
Sensitivity and specificity were assessed in COVID-19 negative samples (n=359)
and PCR-confirmed non-hospitalised, mild or moderate COVID-19 samples, >14
days post symptom onset (n=73). COVID-19 negative samples were identified as
negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies when assay results were less than 1 and PCR

confirmed COVID-19 positive samples were identified as positive when the assay
results were greater than 1, using the human anti-IgGAM SARS-CoV-2 ELISA
(Figure 2). This resulted in an assay sensitivity of 98.6% (95% CI 92.6-100.0%) and
specificity of 98.3% (95% CI 96.4-99.4%), (Table 1).
Assay precision was assessed in 40 replicates by following the CLSI EP12-A2
guidelines to determine whether the C5 to C95 response range (range of responses
at which imprecision around the C50 occurs) falls within 20% of C50. The precision
of the assay was demonstrated at +/- 20% of C50 as C5 gave a mean of 0.77 (40
negatives out of 40 replicates, 4.56% CV), C50 gave a mean of 1.02 (25 positives
out of 40 replicates, 5.07% CV) and C95 gave a mean of 1.13 (40 positives out of 40
replicates, 3.97% CV), (Figure 3).
No change in result outputs were observed following potential analytical interference
from increased haemoglobin, bilirubin or triglyceride concentrations, (Figure 4 A).
Assessing cross-reactivity with other human viruses and coronaviruses, 39 samples
tested negative covering 8 disease categories, (Figure 4 B). Kit components were
stable once opened for 15 days and for one day at extremes of temperature (Figure
4 C & D).
Dried blood spot versus serum samples
Responses were measured in 81 matched serum and DBS samples. A strong
correlation was observed between the two matrices when assessed using the ELISA
(Passing Bablok r=0.959, y=0.16-0.91x), with a mean positive bias towards the DBS
compared to serum (Bland Altman 0.05, 95% CI -0.773 to 0.679), (Figure 5). An
almost perfect agreement, 0.83 (Cohen’s kappa) was observed between the two
sampling matrices.

Clinical study
The assay was validated in clinical samples from an independent group of COVID-19
negative samples (n=426) and PCR-confirmed non-hospitalised, mild or moderate
COVID-19 samples, >14 days post symptom onset (n=226). The sensitivity of the
anti-IgGAM SARS-CoV-2 ELISA in this cohort was 94.7% (95% CI, 90.9-97.2%) and
specificity 98.4% (95% CI, 96.6-99.3%), (Figure 6 & Table 1).
Discussion
Seroepidemiological studies are essential in understanding population-level
exposure to SARS-CoV-2, determining correlates of protection from re-infection and
guiding public health policy. The accuracy of such studies is determined by the
performance characteristics of the immunoassay used to determine serostatus.
Using samples derived from non-hospitalised adults with mild or moderate COVID19 disease we developed a highly sensitive (98.6%) and specific (98.3%) antiIgGAM SARS-CoV-2 ELISA. The assay showed no cross reactivity with endemic
coronaviruses or other respiratory diseases, even though 30% of common colds are
caused by alpha and beta coronaviruses (12)
By validating this assay using samples from non-hospitalised adults, we demonstrate
the human anti-IgGAM SARS-CoV-2 ELISA to be a reliable assay for future
seroepidemiological studies of the general population, the majority of whom will not
require hospitalisation following infection with SARS-CoV-2. Current testing in the
community has been problematic due to the inadequate sensitivities and specificities
of current point of care tests in non-hospitalised patients with mild or moderate
disease (4).
The assay targets nearly the entirety of the trimeric spike protein, and thereby offers
a greater range of epitopes, as reports suggest neutralising antibodies to SARS-

CoV-2 are not only targeted towards the receptor binding domain but also elicit high
affinity and cross-reactivity to other sites across the spike (5, 13-16). Faustini et al.
compared the receptor binding domain, S1 domain and nucleocapsid and although
these targets were excellent at detecting antibodies in severe COVID-19 patients,
they were not as effective when antibody concentrations were more limited (17).
Serological assays have been developed to detect the antibody response present in
severe disease (hospitalised patients). This assay was therefore developed and
tested in non-hospitalised adults, at least 14 days post-symptom onset, with mild or
moderate COVID-19, where the antibody concentrations are much lower than in
hospitalised patients with severe disease (4, 17, 18).
The assay measures anti-IgG, IgA and IgM as reports suggest an asynchronous
serological response. In adults, Seow et al. showed that the kinetics of IgGAM only
occurred synchronously in 50% patients, with 9.7% developing either IgG, A and M
first, 9.7% developing IgM and IgG together, 3% developing IgA and IgM together,
and 3% developing IgA and IgG together (19). Valdivia et al. reported that 3.5%
asymptomatic patients presented with IgM while negative for IgG (20). Long et al.
showed that seroconversion for IgG and IgM occurred synchronously or
simultaneously (21). Additionally, the longevity of the antibody responses is still
under investigation. Studies by Iyer et al. showed that adult patients were IgA and
IgM seronegative by 51 and 47 days, respectively, while IgG persisted to the end of
their evaluation period (75 days) (22). Gudbjartsson, reported IgG persisting without
reduction up to 4 months after diagnosis (23).
This assay benefits by being able to assess SARS-CoV-2 IgGAM antibodies in both
mild and moderate disease, while also being compatible with remote sampling. Here,
antibodies obtained from DBSs were shown to correlate well with serum results.

DBSs are readily used in analytical assays for viruses such as those for human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B and C (24-26) They are also frequently
used for other applications such as screening of neonates, metabolic profiling,
pharmacokinetic, forensic and environmental assays (24, 27, 28). The major
advantages with using DBS’s include: the requirement for a smaller volume of blood,
reduced risk of potential bacterial contamination, non-invasive blood collection, easy
delivery-to- test centre, low cost and stability for prolonged periods of time with
minimal deterioration of analytes (11, 24, 27).

The additional advantage in the

current COVID-19 pandemic include, ensuring patients do not have to attend
hospitals and sites with greater risk of infection. Rickman et al. reported in a major
London Teaching Hospital 15% of in-patient COVID-19 cases developed as a result
of varied transmission routes within the hospital (29) and Meredith et al. also
reported strong and plausible epidemiological links following the identification of 35
clusters of identical viruses associated amongst patients in their hospital (30).
Therefore, when using DBSs, the test becomes accessible to all, including those that
are vulnerable and those beyond developed countries.
In conclusion, utilising the trimeric spike protein and measuring IgG, IgA and IgM
simultaneously, the human anti-IgGAM SARS-CoV-2 ELISA assay provides accurate
and sensitive detection of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in adults with mild or
moderate disease. The use of dried blood spots makes this assay more accessible
to the wider community.

Figure 4. Stability and cross reactivity of antibody positive or antibody
negative serum samples on the anti-IgGAM SARS CoV-2 ELISA
The assay was assessed for (A) interfering substances, bilirubin, haemoglobin and
triglyceride (n=5 replicates per test) in antibody positive or antibody negative serum
samples; and (B) evaluated for cross reactivity with human viruses and other
endemic coronaviruses (n=39). Additionally, the kit components were tested for (C)
stability at extreme temperatures (-20oC, 4oC and 37oC) (n=3) and (D) stability once
opened (n=4).
