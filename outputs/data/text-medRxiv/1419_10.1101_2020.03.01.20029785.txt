Abstract

37

The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection began in

38

December 2019 in Wuhan, and rapidly spread to many provinces in China. The

39

number of cases has increased markedly in Anhui, but information on the clinical

40

characteristics of patients is limited. We reported 75 patients with COVID-19 in the

41

First Affiliated Hospital of USTC from Jan 21 to Feb 16, 2020, Hefei, Anhui Province,

42

China. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR of respiratory

43

nasopharyngeal swab samples. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data were

44

collected and analyzed. Of the 75 patients with COVID-19, 61 (81.33%) had a direct

45

or indirect exposure history to Wuhan. Common symptoms at onset included fever

46

(66 [88.0%] of 75 patients) and dry cough (62 [82.67%]). Of the patients without

47

fever, cough could be the only or primary symptom. The most prominent laboratory

48

abnormalities were lymphopenia, decreased percentage of lymphocytes (LYM%),

49

decreased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and

50

lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Patients with elevated interleukin 6 (IL-6) showed

51

significant decreases in the LYM%, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts. Besides, the

52

percentage of neutrophils, CRP, LDH and Procalcitonin levels increased significantly.

53

We concluded that COVID-19 could cause different degrees of hematological

Introduction

62

Since Dec 2019, a series of acute respiratory illness outbreaks in Wuhan, Hubei

63

Province, China [1, 2]. The disease has been subsequently identified in other

64

provinces in China, and other counties. On Jan 7, a novel coronavirus was identified

65

by deep sequencing analysis of samples from throat swabs and lower respiratory tract.

66

The disease caused by the novel virus is now named by WHO as novel coronavirus

67

disease 2019 (COVID-19). Epidemiological research shows that all infected patients

68

had travel or residence records in Wuhan, suggesting the possibility of

69

person-to-person transmission [3]. By Feb 22, 2020, more than 75,000 confirmed

70

cases, including 1716 health-care workers, have been identified in China. And 989

71

patients have been diagnosed in Anhui Province, including 6 deaths.

72

The novel coronaviruse is an enveloped non-segmented positive sense RNA virus

73

belonging to the betacoronaviruses. The well-known atypical pneumonia virus

74

(SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Virus (MERS-CoV) are also

75

betacoronaviruses [4]. Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough,

76

myalgia and fatigue. Symptoms of headache, expectoration, and diarrhea seem to less

77

common. Radiographic evidence suggested pneumonia. About half of patients have

78

developed severe pneumonia. Nearly one third of patients require intensive care

79

because of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ failure [1,

80

5].

81

At present, there are relatively few reports about novel coronavirus pneumonia in

Anhui Province. Here, we described the epidemiological, clinical and laboratory

83

characteristics of 75 COVID-19 confirmed patients admitted to the First Affiliated

84

Hospital of USTC, Hefei. This study will be beneficial for the diagnosis and treatment

85

of COVID-19 patients in clinical practice.

86

Methods

87

Patients

88

In this study, we eventually enrolled 75 patients from the First Affiliated Hospital

89

of USTC between Jan 21, and Feb 16, 2020. Most patients came to the hospital

90

because of fever or respiratory symptoms. Our clinical team consulted and recorded

91

their epidemiological history in detail regarding to whether they had been to Wuhan

92

or exposed to people who came from Wuhan recently. Nasopharyngeal and throat

93

swabs were taken for respiratory pathogens test. The physical findings, hematological,

94

biochemical and radiological results were also recorded. All patients were identified

95

as laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection. All patients enrolled in this study were

96

diagnosed according to World Health Organization interim guidance. The study was

97

approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC .

98

Procedures

99

Respiratory nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and the presence of COVID-19

100

was detected by next real-time RT-PCR methods. Viral RNA was extracted using

101

QIAamp RNA virus Kit (Qiagen, Heiden, Germany). The diagnostic test was done

102

using a commercial coronavirus test kit (Shenzhen Huada Yinyuan Pharmaceutical

103

Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen). The specific primers and probe targeted to

104

nucleocapsidprotein (N) were used and the sequences were as follows: forward primer

115

We also examined other respiratory viruses, including influenza, avian influenza,

116

respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, SARS-CoV and

117

MERS-CoV, with realtime RT-PCR. Hematological parameters including blood

118

routine, blood biochemistry, coagulation profile, and infection-related biomarkers

119

were recorded. Plasma cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels were detected by ELISA.

120

And the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets were counted using flow cytometry.

121

Statistical analysis

122

We presented continuous measurements as median (IQR) and categorical variables

123

as number (%). Continuous variables were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test.

124

For laboratory results, we also assessed whether the measurements were outside the

125

normal range. Graphpad prism 8.3 was used for all analyses. A two-sided α of less

126

than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

127

Results

128

Totally, 75 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in this study. Among

129

them, 61 (81.33%) patients had been to Wuhan or exposed to people who came from

130

Wuhan. The median age of the patients was 47 years. Among them, 36 (48%) were

131

aged 40-59 years, 25 (33.3 %) were aged 20-39 years, 11 (14.67%) were aged 60-79

132

years. The youngest patient aged 16 years and the oldest aged 91 years. More than

133

half of the participants were men (42 [56%]). Twenty-nine (38.67%) patients had one

134

or more chronic diseases, including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease,

135

diabetes, chronic kidney disease, respiratory system disease, nervous system disease,

136

chronic liver diseases, and malignant tumor (Table 1).

137

Most patients admitted to hospital because of fever (66 [88.0%]) and dry cough (62

138

[82.67%]). Nearly a third of patients had chest tightness (24 [32.0%]). And 20

139

(26.67%) patients had all the three symptoms mentioned above. Less common

140

symptoms included sputum production (22 [29.33%]), fatigue (17 [22.67%]), muscle

141

soreness (9 [12.0%]) and poor appetite (9 [12.0%]). Other symptoms included

142

diarrhea, sore throat, headache, shortness of breath and stomach ache. Nine patients

143

had a body temperature below 37.3℃, and all of them had symptom of dry cough.

144

Only a small proportion had sputum, fatigue, poor appetite and chest tightness (Table

145

2).

146

The blood counts of patients on admission showed leucopenia (white blood cell

147

counts below the normal range; 12 [16.0%]). Twenty-nine (38.67%) patients showed

148

increased neutrophil percentage (NEU%). Over half of the patients (40 [53.33%])

149

showed lymphopenia (lymphocytes counts less than 1.1×109/L). However, no patients

150

had increased lymphocytes counts. Thirty-one (41.33%) and 28 (37.33%) patients

151

showed decreased counts of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell levels, respectively. The

152

CD4+/CD8+ ratio was below the normal range in 11 (14.67%) patients. Haemoglobin

153

were decreased in 11 (14.67%) patients and increased in 18 (24%) patients. Platelets

154

were below the normal range in 14 (18.67%)) patients and above the normal range in

155

only 2 (2.67%) patients. Most patients showed impaired coagulation function.

156

Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was longer in 44 (58.67%) patients and

157

prothrombin time (PT) was longer in 30 (40%) patients (Table 3).

158

Fifteen patients had differing degrees of liver function abnormality, with alanine

159

aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) above the normal range.

160

One patient with no underlying disease had a serious liver function damage (ALT 171

161

U/L, AST 60 U/L). Nearly half of patients showed abnormal myocardial zymogram,

162

with the elevation of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in 33 (44%) patients and the

163

elevation of Troponin I in 13 (17.33%) patients. Fifteen (20%) patients had different

164

degrees of renal function damage with elevated serum creatinine. One patient with

165

uremia had creatinine level of 1561 μmol/L (Table 3). These findings suggested that

166

the internal organs could also be potential targets of COVID-19.

167

Regarding the infection index, most patients showed elevated C-reactive protein

168

(CRP) and Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels. Procalcitonin (PCT) was

169

elevated in 2 out of 59 patients. Forty-nine patients were tested for IL-6, and 14

170

(28.57%) of them showed levels above the normal range (Table 3). Further analysis

171

showed that the 14 patients had significant decreases in lymphocytes percentage,

172

CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts, compared to those with normal IL-6 range. Besides, the

173

NEU%, CRP and LDH levels increased significantly (Table 4; Figure 1). PCT values

174

were within normal range in both two groups. These data indicated that there might be

175

correlation between the increased IL-6 level and the severity of viral infection. And

176

we will continue paying attention to this point in the future.

177

Discussion

178

This report, to our knowledge, is the first case series of patients with COVID-19 in

179

Anhui Province. As most patients remain hospitalized, we focus on the clinical and

180

laboratory profiles upon their admission. Epidemiological research shows that most

181

patients have been to Wuhan recently. Common symptoms were fever, cough, and

182

chest tightness. However, a significant proportion of patients presented with atypical

183

symptoms such as fatigue, muscle soreness and diarrhea. We also pay attention to

184

patients without fever in which cough may be the only or primary symptom.

185

Therefore, to avoid further transmission, screening and closely monitoring of each

186

suspect remain important. Further studies on the epidemiological characteristics of

187

these atypical cases are recommended.

188

The most common laboratory abnormalities observed in this study were decreased

189

total lymphocytes, prolonged APTT, elevated LDH, CRP and ESR. Similarities

190

abnormalities between COVID-19 and previously observed betacoronavirus,

191

MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection, have been noted [3, 6, 7]. These findings

192

suggest that COVID-19 can cause different degrees of hematological abnormalities

193

and damage of internal organs. The absolute value of lymphocytes was reduced in

194

more than 50% patients. The most significant was the decreased CD4+ T cell counts.

195

Previous studies of patients in Wuhan suggested virus invasion could induce a

196

cytokine storm syndrome (CRS) [5, 8]. Of the 14 patients with elevated IL-6, LYM%,

197

CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts were significantly decreased and NEU%, CRP and

198

LDH levels increased significantly. Elevated IL-6 may be an important factor leading

199

to T lymphocytes damage and cellular immune deficiency. IL-6 could also be used as

200

an indicator to evaluate infection severity. Therefore, we conclude that IL-6 may be an

201

effective target for prevention or treatment of serve COVID-19 infection. Future

202

large-scale studies are needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms of disease

203

pathogenesis.

204

COVID-19 belongs to the betacoronavirus. As a single-stranded positive-sense

205

RNA virus, COVID-19 has 79.5% homology with SARS-CoV [9]. Similar to

206

SARS-CoV, angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) is also the cellular entry

207

receptor of COVID-19 [9, 10]. ACE2 is highly expressed in human lung tissue,

208

gastrointestinal tract, vascular endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells [11].

209

Therefore, all of the organs above may be targets for virus attack. ACE2 effectively

210

hydrolyzes the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II to angiotens and is related to

211

hypertension, cardiac function and diabetes [12]. Liu et al. discovered that the

212

Angiotensin II level in the plasma samples increased markedly, suggesting that

213

COVID-19 could induce imbalanced renin-angiotensin system. Drugs of ACE

214

inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) may be used as potential

215

treatment of COVID-19 infection [13]. As we can see, in patients with underlying

216

diseases, most of them have hypertension. However, no report has focused on the

217

correlation between antihypertensive agents with COVID-19 infection or disease

218

severity. Studies are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of ACEI and ARB in the

219

future.

220

Currently, there is no specific therapy for patients with new coronavirus pneumonia.

221

The pathologic mechanisms of disease progression and exacerbation are also unclear.

222

How to relieve the clinical symptoms of critically ill patients, and reduce the severity

223

and mortality of patients still remains challenging. Considering the similarities

224

between SARS-CoV and COVID-19, some pre-clinical drugs against SARS-CoV

225

have been applied to COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir (RDV), a broad-spectrum

226

antiviral nucleotide analogue, is reported to treat MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV

227

infections effectively [14, 15]. A randomized controlled trial was initiated to

228

determine the safety and efficacy of RDV in patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan,

229

China recently. It is crucial to determine host tropism and transmission capacity in

230

terms of prevention of the virus infection [16]. Spike (S) protein mediates membrane

231

fusion through binding with ACE2. Monoclonal antibody against the S protein may

232

efficiently block the virus from entering the host. Convalescent plasma had also been

233

reported to be clinically useful to SARS and MERS patients [17, 18]. If available,

234

convalescent plasma should be used for critically ill patients with COVID-19.

235

However, the appearance of therapeutic plasma requires time and exists only in

236

recovered patients. In our opinion, comprehensive and supportive treatments are

237

essential in the early stage. Additionally, antiviral treatment in early stage and immune

238

activation blockers such as IL-6 blockers, IL-1 blockers in late stage could be tried to

239

control further disease progress leading to ARDS due to excessive immune activation.

240

Targeted treatment should depend on individual differences due to various disease

241

characteristics.

242

This study has several limitations. First, only 75 patients with confirmed

243

COVID-19 were included. It would be better to include as many patients as possible

244

to get a more comprehensive understanding of COVID-19. Second, more detailed

245

patient information, particularly treatment strategies and clinical outcomes, was

246

unavailable at the time of analysis. Regarding the inflammatory factors, we only

247

measured IL-6 level changes. Future studies should focus on changes of various

248

pro-inflammatory factors, ie IL-1, which may provide precise target treatment options

249

for different patients.

250

In conclusion, this study provides an early assessment of the clinical and laboratory

251

profiles of COVID-19 patients in Hefei, China. The clinical manifestation of

252

COVID-19 was nonspecific. Specific coronavirus antivirals show proven efficacies in

253

humans are unavailable to date. Antiviral therapy requires a comprehensive and

254

supportive treatment. Targeted therapy should also be determined based on individual

255

clinical manifestations and laboratory indicators.
