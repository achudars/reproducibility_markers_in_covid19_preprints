Abstract
In 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was first discovered in Wuhan,
Hubei, China, causing severe respiratory disease in humans, and has been identified as
a public health emergency of international concern. With the spread of the virus, there
are more and more false negative cases of RT-PCR nucleic acid detection in the early
stage of potential infection. In this paper, we collected the epidemiological history,
clinical manifestations, outcomes, laboratory results and images of a SARS-CoV-2
carrier with no significant past medical history. The patient was quarantined because of
her colleague had been diagnosed. After the onset of clinical symptoms, chest CT
results showed patchy ground-glass opacity (GGO) in her lungs, but it took a total of
nine nucleic acid tests to confirm the diagnosis, among which the first eight RT-PCR
results were negative or single-target positive. In addition to coughing up phlegm
during her stay in the hospital, she did not develop chills, fever, abdominal pain,
diarrhea and other clinical symptoms. Since initial antiviral treatment, the lung lesions
were absorbed. But the sputum nucleic acid test was still positive. In combination with
antiviral and immune therapy, the patient tested negative for the virus. Notably,
SARS-CoV-2 was detected only in the lower respiratory tract samples (sputum)
throughout the diagnosis and treatment period. This is a confirmed case of
SARS-CoV-2 infection with common symptoms, and her diagnosis has undergone
multiple false negatives ,suggesting that it is difficult to identify certain carriers of the
virus and that such patients may also increase the spread of the SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan (Hubei, China) in December 2019 [1], it has spread rapidly
across the globe and has become a major public health emergency worldwide. The
international commission classification of viruses (ICTV) announced that 2019-nCoV
was officially classified as SARS-CoV-2[2]. The world health organization (WHO)
announced that the official name of the disease caused by this virus is coronavirus
disease (COVID-19) [3]. The outbreak has led the Chinese government to take drastic
measures to contain the outbreak, including isolating millions of residents in Wuhan
and other affected cities. According to the "Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19
(Trial Version 7)", the disease must be confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) or pathogen gene sequencing from respiratory, digestive and
blood samples. The RT-PCR test is often used for clinical detection. Recently, it has
been reported that the patients had clinical symptoms but their nasopharyngeal swab
showed negative RT-PCR results[4]. Thus, it is necessary to study the causes of these
multiple RT-PCR negative results.
In order to better diagnose COVID-19, this study analyzed a case whose eight
RT-PCR tests were negative. According to the epidemiological history and clinical
data of the case, this study aimed to better diagnose the incubation period and
asymptomatic patients by combining different diagnostic methods, thus reducing the
spread of the disease.
Methods
This study investigated a case of highly suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection
admitted to a hospital. The results of RT-PCR were negative for eight times and positive
for the ninth time.

Data Collection
The epidemiological and clinical data from the information system of the hospital,
including possible exposure to pathogens, visits to health facilities, hospitalization,
treatment, pathogens and laboratory tests, and clinical results etc. were collected by an
investigator. The records were verified by another investigator. A third researcher
further verified the data by cross-checking the information in the medical records
system and attending physician.
The original image of chest computed tomography (CT) was provided by the local
county people's hospital.
SARS-CoV-2 Real-Time Quantitative PCR
According to the guidelines released by the National Health Commission of
People’s Republic of China (NHC of China), nucleic acid testing kits were used. The
samples were throat swabs, sputum, anal swabs, feces and plasma. The detection kit
simultaneously detected three target genes of SARS-CoV-2, including RdRp, envelop
protein (E) and nucleocapsid protein (N).

Results
Epidemiological information
The reported case was a middle-aged woman who worked in a hotel and returned
home on January 23. She has not been to any other places since returning home, has no
contact with people returning from the affected areas, has no travel history to Wuhan
and has denied any contact with wild animals. The patient had been admitted to a local
health clinic for coughing after a cold. After her colleagues were diagnosed with
COVID-19, the patient was transferred to the local county people's Hospital for
isolation and observation on February 2. It was later learned that about 8 colleagues
were diagnosed with COVID-19.

During intensive medical observation on February 2 to February 6, the patient
showed no other clinical symptoms. The tests of nucleic acid from pharyngeal swab
were negative on February 7, 8, 11 and 13. But the CT reports of her lung (Fig 1) on
February 12 and 15 showed patchy ground-glass opacity (GGO) in her lung, indicating
that the patient was highly suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subsequently, the
results of two RT-PCR tests were negative.

In order to further improve the relevant examination and treatment, the patient was
transferred to our hospital on February 21 for further isolation treatment. The tests of
nucleic acid were still negative on February 22 and single-target positive on February
23. Until February 24, the ninth practical sputum nucleic acid test was positive, and the
hospital confirmed COVID-19 infection to her clinical symptoms and laboratory test
results. Nucleic acid tests were then performed on those who were in close contact with
the patient. However, all results were negative.
Clinical information and follow-ups
This patient had no chronic history of hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart
disease, etc. At the time of admission, the patient presented acute symptoms, with body
temperature at 36.6℃, pulse rate at 78 beats per minute, respiratory rate at 20 beats per
minute, blood pressure of 136/79mmHg, and subcutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2)
of 98.6%. No other abnormalities were detected in pneumonia-associated nucleic acid
tests and respiratory pathogenic nucleic acid tests. The remaining laboratory results
were shown in table 1. At the time of admission, the patient had been coughing for more
than 20 days and had no symptoms of dyspnea, diarrhea or vomiting. There were no
clinical symptoms such as fever, diarrhea and vomiting except cough during the
hospitalization. The body temperature changes between admission and February 25
were shown in Fig 2.

Arbidol tablets were given on the day of admission for 10 consecutive days and

chloroquine phosphate tablets were continuous used for 8 days. Imaging examination
showed that the lung lesions were absorbed before comparison (Fig3). But the nucleic
acid test of sputum fluid was still positive. On March 3, arbidol tablets were
discontinued and lopinavir/ritonavir tablets were used instead. Meantime she was
treated with aerosolized interferon α1β to continue antiviral treatment. Combined with
moxifloxacin antibacterial therapy and immunotherapy, the patient's symptoms were
alleviated.

After 20 days hospitalization, the patient’s physical examination showed good
results that the vital signs were normal, clear in mind, mentally acceptable, no dry and
wet rales in both lungs, no positive signs were found in heart and abdomen, and the
pathological signs were negative. Although the patients still had occasional cough and
sputum, a small amount of white foam-like sputum, fearless of cold, fever, dyspnea, but
had no abdominal pain and diarrhea, indicating that the general condition of the patient
was normal. After discussion by the expert group, the patient met the discharge
standards. She was discharged on March 12.
SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results
Since admission on February 21, a total of eleven SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests
have been performed on the patient. The samples that tested positive were sputum, and
the rest were negative. The specific test results were shown in Table 2.
Discussion
This article reported a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection that was negative for eight
RT-PCR tests. The patient has had close contact with a confirmed patient and belongs to
the third or fourth generation of transmission patients [5]. Other than cough, there were
no other clinical symptoms such as fever, fatigue, muscle pain, and the infection status
was hidden at early stage. The patient has been infected for at least 32 days, and a total
of eight RT-PCR tests were negative or single-target positive before the diagnosis. The

number of tests was more than the current report and took a long time. Although the
nucleic acid test was negative or single-target positive, the low number of white blood
cells and lymphocytes in laboratory tests, and GGO in the lungs by CT examination
indicated SARS-CoV-2 infection. It can be seen that using RT-PCR as a nucleic acid
test cannot completely rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are several factors that
may cause the negative results when troubleshooting sampling and transportation
issues.

First, sample collection. Same as SARS-CoV[6,7], the functional receptor
targeted by SARS-CoV-2 is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [8]. ACE2 is
found mainly in type I epithelial cells and type II epithelial cells in the alveoli, and it is
less abundant in cells such as airway epithelial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells and
macrophages, so the amount of virus in the lower respiratory tract is significantly
higher than that in the upper respiratory tract. Due to the reason that RT-PCR detection
requires the cells containing a sufficient amount of virus, the virus-containing cells
must be sampled when collecting specimens. Recent studies have shown that the viral
load in sputum was greater than that in throat swabs[9]. The patient's RT-PCR positive
nucleic acid samples during the hospitalization were all deep sputum collected after
being atomized by 3% sodium chloride injection. Combined with the reported cases
[10], it is suggested that the cause of several negative nucleic acid tests in highly
suspected patients may be related to the sample collection site.

Compared with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has a higher load in the upper
respiratory tract [11], and the virus in the upper respiratory tract is more likely to fall off
and spread, which may make it easier spread when asymptomatic. However, in the case
of the patient, no virus was detected in samples other than sputum during the entire
nucleic acid detection process. It can be seen that the virus in this patient mainly existed
in the lower respiratory tract, and the viral load in the nasopharynx was low. It may also
be one of the reasons accounting for its several false-positive RT-PCR tests and not
infection of her close contacts. Similarly, no virus detected in anal swabs and stool

samples proved that the virus did not infect the digestive tract, so the patient did not
experience symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhea. But whether the
distribution of the virus affects the spread of the virus needs more studies.

Most notably, although the patient was undiagnosed by eight nucleic acid tests in
this case, the patient's clinical manifestations, imaging examinations, and other
laboratory tests showed that he had SARS-CoV-2 infection. For such multiple "false
positive" cases, specific antibody detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the patient's blood can
be used as a supplement to nucleic acid detection. In the latest "Diagnosis and
Treatment of COVID-19 (Trial Version 7)", it is mentioned that the serological
antibody testing is used as the basis for diagnosis. COVID-19 is a new infectious
disease and is throughout the course of disease same as SARS. The specific IgM of
SARS-CoV mainly exists in the early and middle stages of infection and specific IgG
mainly exists in the middle stage of infection and recovery period [12, 13]. Because
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV belong to the same family, the detection of IgM and IgG
antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 may cause the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in patients
with negative nucleic acid tests. Therefore, the negative result of several nucleic acid
tests may be due to the high specific IgM in the early stages of onset. The high specific
IgM makes the SARS-CoV-2 low load in the body and amount of virus insufficient in
the sample, leading to RT-PCR result is negative. But the virus does exist in the patient
and is infectious at early stage. Considering that the production of specific antibodies
takes time, and antibody detection is easily affected by rheumatoid factor, non-specific
IgM, autoantibodies in blood samples, the RT-PCR result could be false positive. So
even if the antibody is positive, continue to take samples to detect the viral nucleic acid.
With the outbreak in many places around the world, more and more infected people,
like the patients in this study, may have no obvious clinical symptoms or even no
clinical symptoms after infection[14], and have negative or single-target positive
RT-PCR results[4]. For such infected persons, it is necessary to combine the efficient
SARS-CoV-2 capture sequencing to detect viral nucleic acids, helping clinical
diagnoses. In addition, because the RNA virus is susceptible to mutation, sequencing of

pathogenic nucleic acid genomes from samples of asymptomatic and occult infected
patients is also conducive to studying the virus mutations in the pathogenic genes
providing a basis for subsequent virus tracing and epidemiological investigations.

As the virus spreads, research data from Chen et al [15] showed that the initial
symptoms of newly infected patients seemed to be more subtle, and the virus may lie in
asymptomatic carriers for a long time. Similarly, our study also showed that it is also
difficult to detect infections due to the reason that the clinical symptoms of the
COVID-19 in the early stage of infection were mild or even absent. Such unknown
infection has caused 79% of the overall infection [16], and is the main reason for the
widespread spread of this virus. The patient in this case was isolated in a timely manner
after her colleague was diagnosed, reducing the risk of transmission. Therefore, it can
be seen that the follow-up of COVID-19 patients’ contacts or experience areas is
necessary to control the disease. Considering asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic
infections, it is recommended that contacts of confirmed patients should be screened
and tested for viral nucleic acid regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms, and
preventive use of effective antiviral drugs for asymptomatic patients to reduce viral
load and reduce the risk of virus transmission from asymptomatic carriers. Such
measures may help control the spread of COVID-19. Similarly, it is not yet possible to
determine whether patients have virus or are still infections in the recovery period
although RT-PCR tests are negative. Therefore, it is recommended to increase the
number of tests and the interval between each test.
Conclusion
We report the epidemiological history and clinical information of a patient with
negative (or single-target positive) SARS-CoV-2 infection with multiple RT-PCR tests.
The present case indicates that mild patients with virus-free or low-load in the upper
respiratory tract may mainly cause several RT-PCR results false negatives during the
diagnosis. Therefore, it is recommended to strengthen the detection and isolation of
