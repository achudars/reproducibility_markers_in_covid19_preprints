Abstract

Background: Covid-19 Serology may document exposure and perhaps protection to
the virus and serological test may help understand epidemic dynamics. We tested
health workers form a public laboratory to evaluate previous exposure to the virus and
estimate the prevalence of antibodies against-SARS-CoV-2 in Adolfo Lutz Institute,
State of São Paulo, Brazil. Methods: This study was an open , prospective evaluation
among professionals of Adolfo Lutz Institute some administrative personnel from the
Secretary of Health that shares common areas with the institute. We used a lateral flow
immunoassay (rapid test) to detect IgG and IgM for SARS-CoV-2; positive samples
were further evaluated using Roche Electrochemiluminescence assay. SARS-CoV-2
RNA by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was also
offered to participants. Results: A total of 406 HPs participated. Thirty five (8.6%)
tested positive on rapid test and 32 these rapid test seropositive cases were confirmed
by ECLIA. 43 HPs had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected at a median of 33 days, and the
three cases not reactive at Roche ECLIA had a previous positive RNA. Outsourced
professionals (34% seropositive), males (15%) workers referring COVID-19 patients at
home (22%) and those living farther form the institute tended to have higher prevalence
of seropositivity, but in multivariable logistic analysis only outsourced workers and
those with COVID patients at home remained independently associated to
seropositivity. We observed no relation of seropositivity to COVID samples handling.
Presence of at least one symptom was common but some clinical manifestations as
anosmia/dysgeusia. Fatigue, cough and fever were associated to seropositivity.
Conclusions: We documented a relatively high (8.6%) of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological
reactivity in this population, higher among outsourced workers and those residing with
COVID-19 patients. COVID related work did not increased seropositivity. Some
symptoms show strong association to COVID-19 serology and may be used in scoring
tools for screening or diagnosis in resort limited settings.

1. Introduction

Over one million deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic have been reported in
by the end of September 2020 (OMS, 2020). Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of COVID-19, has spread across Brazil and
since the first recorded case in February 26, 2020 (Brasil1, 2020). Contrary to places as
China and parts of Europe, Brazil never achieved a true decline in new cases
incidence, and the country has plateaued at a high rate of about 32.058 new cases
every day (OMS, 2020). In Brazil, there have been over four millions documented
cases of COVID-19 and more than 140 thousand deaths at the end of September 2020
(Brasil2, 2020) across all its territory, but numbers of cases are probably
underestimated due to testing limitations.
The search for markers of immunity and diagnosis with serology has led to
development of different assays, but specificity and sensibility issues have been
reported (Castro et al., 2020). Along with the unknown nature of a protective immunity
and the fact that antibodies emerge at the end, or after, infectiousness phase of the
disease, has hamper the use of serology as a diagnostic clinical tool. However, it
remained valid to evaluate population exposure to the virus, guiding public health
policies and may provide a general framework for understanding virus exposure.at a
population level. The performance of systematic and comprehensive tests to identify
the infection in health professionals (HP) and other key areas is important, even if they
are not in direct contact with patients, and available to estimate the prevalence of
infected and virus transmission in within health services. A meta-analysis of eleven
studies showed that almost 10% of COVID-19 positive patients are health
professionals (Sahu et al., 2020).
The Adolfo Lutz Institute, the Central laboratory of public health of State of São
Paulo, has increased its activities to fight COVID since early in the pandemic.
Nowadays, the institute and it regional centers receives most respiratory tract samples
collected in the São Paulo State, processes part of the daily load and distribute the
remaining to associated clinical laboratories. São Paulo is the most populous State and
accordantly has the largest number of COVID-19 cases in the country, with 985.628
documented cases and 35.622 thousand deaths by the end of September 2020
(SEADE, 2020).

COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil spread quickly among health workers (Valente et
al., 2020; Faíco-Filho et al., 2020) and the increase in infection rates among those
professionals has the potential for compromising the health system (Barranco et al.,
2020). There is limited data on how the professionals of public health diagnostic and
research services / institutes, an example of an active sector during the epidemic, in
areas both linked or not to COVID-19 laboratory work. We evaluated the presence of
antibodies against-SARS-CoV-2 among professionals of Adolfo Lutz Institute, State of
São Paulo, Brazil.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Study population
This study was performed among professionals of Adolfo Lutz Institute in São Paulo,
Brazil and administrative personnel of the Secretary of Health that shares common
work buildings.

2.2. Laboratory tests of SARS-CoV-2 infection

2.2.1. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies
During the period from June 5, 2020 to July 31, 2020, workers we invited to participate
in this voluntary survey answered a brief questionnaire, containing demographic data,
work activities, symptoms and exposure to COVID-19. Those agreeing to collect
peripheral blood samples to test for the presence of antibodies against-SARS-CoV-2 in
serum were included. The blood was collected both with and without out anticoagulant
and was centrifuged (2000 g x 15 min). We used a commercial antibody test lateral
flow immunoassay (LFIA) method, (SARS-CoV-2 Wondfo, Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech
Co., Ltd., China) to perform the immunochromatographic assay following the
manufacturer's instructions. This test detects IgG and IgM isotypes that are specific for
the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). Reagent samples at LFIA were
further evaluated using Electrochemiluminescence assay (ECLIA) Elecys Anti-SARS

CoV-2 (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) which is an immunoassay for the in
vitro qualitative detection of antibodies (as IgA, IgM and IgG isotypes) that uses a
recombinant protein representing the nucleocapsid (N) antigen in a double-antigen
sandwich assay format.

2.2.2. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR
SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) was offered to participants at the time of this survey. Some individuals tested for
SARS CoV-2 2 in other laboratories using swab collections and those were also
counted as RNA tested in this analysis. RNA was obtained from nasopharyngeal or
oropharyngeal secretions either by regular swab collection method (Brasil3, 2020) , or
throat wash (López-Lopes et al., 2020) , used for most in-site collections due to swabs
sort supply, Briefly, participants received a 5 mL chilled sterile 0.9% saline in a 50 mL
falcon tube The contents of the gargle were returned to the tube after approximately 5+
seconds. Participants were instructed to perform the procedure outdoors, at a safe
social distance. The tubes were kept at approximately 4-8º C before and after
collection, and were processed in the same day. TNA was extracted with a RNA
extraction method (Quiagen, USA, Bio Gene, Quibasa, or by automated extraction at
Abbott M2000) more recently Quick ExtractTM Solution, Lucigen) was used. COVID-19
RNA was retrotranscribed and amplified using the commercial Allplex kit (Seegene,
Corea), which is based on the Charité protocol (Corman, et al., 2020). The samples
with amplification in the three viral targets (E, RdRP and N) were considered positive.
As recommended for the Influenza assay, human RNAse P was used to assess the
quality control of the sample and the presence of inhibitors, and human RNAse P cycle
thresholds (CTs) up to 37 were considered valid.

2.3. Statistical Analysis

We evaluated seroprevalence and its association to demographic and other available
information including age, sex, workplace characteristics, contact with confirmed or
suspected cases of COVID-19, history of comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes,
obesity, autoimmune diseases, among others) and presence of symptoms.

Professionals were classified according to the area of activity as (i) Administrative 82
(20%), (ii) BioMedical laboratories 224 (55%), (iii) Chemistry laboratories 68 (17%) and
(iv) 32 (8%) Outsourced workers (including security guards, car valets, cleaning
assistants and other support areas). Exposure to individuals symptomatic for COVID19, or diagnosis was reported by 272 (67%) of the participants.

3.2. Antibody response
Thirty five (8.6%) individuals tested positive for (IgM / IgG) serology for SARSCoV-2. 32 these rapid test seropositive cases were confirmed by ECLIA. Three not
reactive at Roche ECLIA had a previous positive RNA, and were considered true
positive for the purpose of this analysis. Males, outsourced workers and those referring

3.3. Correlation between RNA detection results and serology rapid test result
Three hundred and twenty-one participants also had a RNA test collected at the
day of serology test or before, with 44 individuals RNA positive. Seropositivity was
associated to SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, with 55% of seropositive cases with
previous RNA detection whereas only 4% of those RNA negative were seropositive
(p<0.001). Detection of RNA occurred at a median of 33 days (IQR 17-47) before
serology.
In table 2 we describe referred clinical symptoms according to serology and
RNA results.

results(G4, R- S-).

3.4. Correlation between Seropositivity and professional activity
One hundred and forty (34%) of the participants perform activities related to the
diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, of which 102 (73%) perform one or more activity handling
biological samples: sample screening (51, 36%), RNA extraction 42 (30%), material
preparation 22 (16%), RT-PCR perform 19 (14%), and research 7 (5%). Other
activities, which did not involve biological samples, were also mentioned: sample
registration and diagnostic report 25 (18%), administrative activities and supply chain
management 16 (11%) and, cleaning and decontamination of areas 8 (6%). There was
no association COVID-19 serology results and COVID-19 related activity. The
differences are not statistically relevant (p=0.122), even when activities were assessed
separately: Sample screening (p=0.8), RNA extraction (p=0.3), Material preparation
(p=0.4), RT-PCR perform (p=0.6) and research (p=0.4). Considering the handling of in
natura samples (sample preparation and RNA extraction).
The frequency of comorbidities among participants were: High blood pressure

individuals reported smoking. Having some comorbidity or smoking was not associated
to serology (p=0.88 and p=0.35, respectively).
Three hundred and eighty-eight (97%) disclosed home address and the median
distance between the workplace and the home of the interviews was 15 km (IQR 1020). Considering only those that live in the metropolitan area (circa 50 km from the
institute), there was a strong correlation of living far from the institute and doing
outsource work (23 km, IQR 16-33) vs (14 Km IQR 10-21) (p=0.0001).

Longer

distance traveled show some association to seropositivity (p = 0.041). Using public
transportation (bus, train and/or subway) to get to the workplace was associated to
seropositivity (p=0.3).

4. Discussion

The institute is a research and diagnostic reference service of the São Paulo
State Health Department kept many working activities during the restriction of nonessential activities, at the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in São Paulo, from
March to early June 2020. Although a true lockdown was never attained in this and
other metropolitan areas of Brazil, an important decrease in social and economic

activities could be noted during this period. The institute, on the other hand, actually
increased some of its activities to cope with the fight against the COVID. Now, most of
activities in the metropolitan region have been reestablished, albeit with rules for social
distance and mask wearing. In this study we documented a seroprevalence of 8.6% in
after about 4 month of circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in the region.
Few studies on SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence are available in Brazil. The larger
is a nationwide seroprevalence survey at households, showing much lower of
seropositivity, with estimates of 1·9% (95% CI 1·7-2·1) for May to 3·1% (2·8-3·4) for
June (Hallal et al., 2020). For the São Paulo area, this study estimated a prevalence
from 2% to 4.9% (Hallal et al., 2020). The national estimates included some cities in
the amazon basin with prevalence up to 25%, associated to a high case fatality in this
period. Another study in southern State, that were not so much affected in this initial
phase, showed lower estimates, around of 0.05% to 0.2% (Silveira et al., 2020). Both
studies used the same rapid test of our study, but contrary to our study, that used
serum, both surveys used blood drops from finger prick that have been documented to
underestimate the seroprevalence (Santos et al., 2020).
Surveys that include health workers are more limited in Brazil. In a study with
health professionals working on the front line to combat COVID-19 at North of country,
the prevalence of antibodies were 21,5% [Melo et al., 2020]. A blood bank detected 4%
seropositivity to COVID-19 (Amorim Filho et al., 2020).
A large study in Denmark showed an overall seroprevalence of 3.4% (CI: 2.5%3.8%) among health care workers. The rates varied from as high as 29.7% among
those with contact with patients to as low as 2.2% in those that not involved in direct
contact (Jespersen et al., 2020), which is more close to the characteristics of our study
population. Studies in other countries with healthcare workers show prevalence ranging
from 1.07 – 17.14% (Lahner et al., 2020; Jeremias et al., 2020; Psichogiou et al.,
2020; Pallet et al., 2020; Korth et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Garcia-Basteiro et al.,
2020), but laboratory workers were not specifically evaluated.
At the study set up one of the questions was to evaluate if handling biological
samples for diagnosis of COVID-19 was related to infection. We evaluate both
professional received clinical samples as well as those that perform more risk related
activities as preparation of samples for RNA extraction and found no significant
association seropositivity. This was also observed in relation to documented infection
by rt PCR (López-Lopes et a., 2020).

Previous or current symptoms were commonly reported by either seropositive
and negative individuals, but some were associate to seropositivity and can be
considered more specific, as cough, fever, fatigue and particularly anosmia and/or
dysgeusia. Alterations in smell and taste, although can occur in other pathologies, has
been associated as a COVID-19 (Rocke et al., 2020; Russel et al., 2020; Makaronidis
et al., 2020) with high prevalence among infected participants (Gómez-Ochoa et al.,
2020).
We observed in our study that the presence of symptoms was more reported in
those in which RNA was detectable (groups 1 and 2). Cough, myalgia, fatigue, and
fever were the most frequent symptoms among participants with detectable RNA.
Particularly the presence of cough was also more frequent in-group 4 (negative results
in RT-PCR and LFIA) than in group 2, which suggests that presenting this symptom is
a criterion for conducting an investigation for COVID-19. Anosmia or/ and dysgeusia
and shortness of breath was observed more frequently in the group in which serology
was positive (group 1 and 3), suggesting that this symptoms may be correlated with the
induction of humoral response (Makaronidis et al., 2020). The median time reported
among participants who had anosmia and / or dysgeusia in these groups (1 and 3) was
17 days and 60 days (IQR 8.5-25.5 and IQR 15-90, respectively).
The minority in our study did not report having symptoms before positive
serology (14, 40%) and rt-qPCR positive (16, 34%) diagnosis.
Beyond the usefulness of serology to understand the pandemic, the professionals had
the opportunity to know their diagnosis, favoring a decrease in the anxiety associated
to the pandemic. Moreover, RNA detection allowed swift isolation from colleagues and
limited local spread, especially for those asymptomatic.
Transmission is more likely in indoor than outdoor environments (Nishiura et al.,
2020) and that home confinement and isolation measures influence due to economic
and social aspects, and vary between regions in a country that is heterogeneous like
Brazil (Nadanovsky et al., 2020). Our data indicate that living with diagnosed or
symptomatic people was more relevant in domestic environment than in the workplace,
which can be justified by more intimate contact and extensive sharing of areas, in spite
the guidelines advising family members to distance themselves.
Our data point to a similarity with others study about health workers in São
Paulo that evaluated positive cases among professionals from different areas of the
hospital, regardless of their activities. Thirty-six percent (169/466) of workers who had
influenza-like symptoms with suspected COVID-19 tested positive on RT-PCR.

Professionals from laboratory areas were 25% while workers who had no direct contact
with patients (administrative areas, security and cleaning staff) had a higher infection
rate, especially in the areas of logistics (Faíco-Filho, et al., 2020)
In our study, we chose to use a rapid test for preliminary results, despite the its
reported performance (Sensitivity: 86, 43% [95% CI: 82, 51%~89, 58%] and Specificity:
99, 57% [95% CI: 97, 63%~99,92%]).. We chose to use the serum obtained from the
peripheral blood because the test performance was better in terms of sensitivity when
used in serum and not in blood capillary, as suggested in others studies (Santos et al.,
Wu et al., 2020; Serrano et al., 2020). This test may be performed with whole blood,
plasma and serum.
We recognize some limitations in our study, as : 1- we used the LFIA method as
a preliminary assessment and although confirmed most cases with a second, high
throughput ECLIA method, false negative cases would not be identified and we can be
under estimating the true prevalence, however, the use of serum instead of finger prick
drops may have improved sensibility. 2- Despite our efforts, not all employees joined
the study and the prevalence does not reflect the actual SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence
of the institute, but more than half of the workers did contributed to this work. 3- The
collection of blood samples was in some cases performed in parallel with the gargle /
oropharyngeal smear samples, so we cannot exclude that professionals with a
detectable RNA result with a negative LFIA test may have become positive over time.
4- some of the

questionnaire were not completed by participants limiting the

interpretation of some of the results, but the associations reported were very strong
and possibly results were not influenced by missing data.

5. Conclusion

We documented a relatively high (8.6%) of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological
reactivity in this population, with higher rates among outsourced workers and those
residing with COVID-19 patients. COVID samples handling was not related to
increased seropositivity. Some symptoms how strong association to COVID-19
serology and may be used in scoring tools for screening or diagnosis in resort limited
settings.
