Abstract
Background
The antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties of azithromycin suggest
therapeutic potential against COVID-19. Randomised data in mild-moderate disease are
lacking. We assessed whether azithromycin is effective in reducing hospitalisation in patients
with mild-moderate COVID-19.
Methods
This open-label, randomised superiority clinical trial at 19 centres in the United Kingdom
enrolled adults, ≥18 years, presenting to hospitals with clinically-diagnosed highly-probable or
confirmed COVID-19 infection, with <14 days symptoms, considered suitable for initial

for 14 days) or to standard care without macrolides. The primary outcome was the difference
in proportion of participants with death or hospital admission from any cause over the 28 days
from randomisation, assessed according to intention-to-treat (ITT). Trial registration:
ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04381962, Study closed.
Findings
298 participants were enrolled from 3rd June 2020 to 29th January 2021. The primary outcome
was assessed in 292 participants. The primary endpoint was not significantly different between
the azithromycin and control groups (Adjusted OR 0·91 [95% CI 0·43-1·92], p=0·80). Rates
of respiratory failure, progression to pneumonia, all-cause mortality, and adverse events,
including serious cardiovascular events, were not significantly different between groups.
Interpretation
In patients with mild-moderate COVID-19 managed without hospital admission, adding
azithromycin to standard care treatment did not reduce the risk of subsequent hospitalisation
or death. Our findings do not support the use of azithromycin in patients with mild-moderate
COVID-19.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)
with the terms (“azithromycin”) AND (“COVID” OR “COVID-19”) AND (“clinical trials”), until
March 25, 2021, with no language restrictions. We identified 42 studies, among which there
were four completed randomised trials of azithromycin (with or without hydroxychloroquine) in
hospitalised patients with severe disease, and three completed randomised trials of
azithromycin in mild COVID-19 in primary care. The four trials in hospitalised patients
randomised 8,988 participants to azithromycin or standard care or hydroxychloroquine and
found no evidence of a difference in mortality, duration of hospital stay or peak disease
severity. Of the three trials in primary care, these randomised participants with early disease
to 3 or 5 days of therapy, of which only one assessed azithromycin as standalone therapy.
This large, adaptive platform trial in the UK randomised 540 participants in primary care to 3
days treatment with azithromycin versus 875 to standard care alone and found no meaningful
difference in time to first reported recovery, or of rates of hospitalisation (3% versus 3%) and
there were no deaths. We did not identify any randomised trials in patients with COVID-19
managed in ambulatory care.
Added value of this study
The ATOMIC2 trial was uniquely-designed to assess azithromycin as a standalone therapy in
those with mild-moderately COVID-19 presenting to emergency care, but assessed as
appropriate for initial ambulatory management without hospital admission. ATOMIC2 also
uniquely assessed high-dose, long-duration treatment to investigate the efficacy of putative
anti-inflammatory effects. We found that azithromycin 500 mg daily for 14 days did not reduce
the proportion of participants who died or required hospital admission from any cause over the
28 days from randomisation.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our findings, taken together with existing data, suggest there is no evidence that azithromycin
reduces hospitalisation, respiratory failure or death compared with standard care, either in
early disease in the community, or those hospitalised with severe disease, or in those with
moderate disease managed on an ambulatory pathway.

Introduction
Azithromycin (AZM) is an orally-active synthetic macrolide antibiotic with a wide range of
antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties1. Early in 2020 it was highlighted by in
silico and in vitro2 screens as a potential candidate therapy to be repurposed for treatment of
COVID-19. Indeed macrolides, particularly azithromycin, had previously been used to treat
other viral infections including one in three severe cases of MERS-CoV3 although randomised
controlled trial data for its use in any coronavirus disease were lacking4. Azithromycin is
inexpensive, safe and widely available, and stimulated by a small, non-randomised clinical
report5 its use in the context of COVID-19 has become widespread in clinical practice and a
number of clinical trials.
In vitro azithromycin has broad antiviral activity against human viruses including human
rhinovirus, Zika, enteroviruses, Ebola, SARS1, and against SARS-CoV-2, being shown to
reduce viral replication alone2 or in combination with hydroxychloroquine6. Azithromycin was
also associated with reduced viral load of non-SARS-CoV-2 alpha- and beta-coronaviruses in
children receiving azithromycin during a mass distribution programme7. Although antivirals are
likely to have limited efficacy in severe disease after viraemia has peaked8-10 azithromycin also
has anti-inflammatory properties including dose-dependent suppression of lymphocyte
expression of perforin, and a range of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1b, IL-6 and
TNF, IL-8(CXCL8), IL-18, G-CSF and GM-CSF11,12 and other components of the IL-1b,/IL-6induced acute phase response such as serum amyloid protein A12.
Despite these theoretical considerations, large scale clinical trials of azithromycin
either alone or co-administered with hydroxychloroquine have not shown clinical efficacy in
reducing mortality, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalisation, or
clinical status on ordinal outcome scores amongst patients hospitalised with COVID-1913-16.
However, these trials were all conducted in late-stage, severe disease with 17-40% mortality.
They did not study patients at earlier stages of disease in the community and are not able to
make conclusions about the effectiveness of azithromycin outside the hospital setting. The
efficacy of therapies in COVID-19 depends on the timing in the course of disease and in the
populations being studied. Dexamethasone showed a strong survival benefit with treatment in
severe patients but no benefit, or even potential harm, in those not requiring oxygen therapy17.
Conversely studies of neutralising antibodies showed benefits in early disease18 but not in
hospitalised patients19. The antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties of azithromycin are
suited to earlier stage disease, thus we studied an ambulatory population to establish whether
it averts disease progression.
We conducted a randomised, open-label clinical trial to determine whether
azithromycin is effective in preventing hospitalisation or death in adult patients with clinicallydiagnosed COVID-19 infection being managed on an ambulatory care pathway.
Methods
Study design
ATOMIC2 was a prospective, open-label, two-arm, randomised superiority clinical trial of
standard care and Azithromycin with standard care alone, conducted at 19 hospitals in the
United Kingdom. The trial was conducted according to the published protocol v7.020 (Appendix
1) and all applicable laws and regulations including, but not limited to, the principles as stated
in the International Council for Harmonisation Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, the

standards set out by the Research Governance Framework, the Medicines for Human Use
(Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004, and the ethical principles that have their origin in the
Declaration of Helsinki. Safety data were reviewed and monitored by an independent data
safety monitoring committee. The trial protocol was reviewed and approved by the UK
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and an independent ethical committee
(London – Brent Research Ethics Committee, Research Ethics Committee reference number
20/HRA/2105).
Participants
Eligible participants were adults, ≥18 years of age assessed in an acute hospital with a clinical
diagnosis of highly-probable or confirmed COVID-19 infection made by the attending clinical
team, with onset of first symptoms within the last 14 days, and assessed by the attending
clinical team as appropriate for initial ambulatory (outpatient) management. Key exclusion
criteria included known hypersensitivity to any macrolide or the excipients, fructose
intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrose-isomaltase-insufficiency, current
therapy with a macrolide antibiotic, hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, significant myocarditis,
prolongation of a corrected QT interval (QTc) >480 msec, significant electrolyte disturbance,
clinically relevant bradycardia, ventricular tachycardia, unstable severe cardiac insufficiency,
and inability to understand written English. The full protocol including a complete list of
inclusion / exclusion criteria are provided in appendix 120. All patients provided electronic
informed consent before randomisation.
Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either azithromycin plus standard care or standard
care alone using a web-based automated service, with a minimisation algorithm to ensure
balanced allocation across treatment groups, stratified by centre, sex and presence of
hypertension and diabetes. To ensure the unpredictability of treatment allocation the first 30
participants were randomised by simple randomisation and the minimisation algorithm
included a probabilistic element (participants had an 80% chance of being allocated to the
treatment which minimised imbalance between the groups). Patients, investigators, and
health-care providers were not masked to study drug assignment.
Procedures
Data on demographics, medical history, symptomatology, risk factors for disease progression
and disease severity were collected on all patients at baseline. Results were recorded for vital
signs (temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation),
physical examination (including chest auscultation) with clinical assessment including the
COVID Core Outcomes Set21, and a nine-level severity score of respiratory illness (0-8, where
0 indicates “Ambulatory. No limitation of activities” and 8 indicates “Death”). Participants also
had a 12-lead electrocardiogram. Optional study samples were taken at baseline and on one
further occasion if the participant was admitted: oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 PCR,
nasal and blood samples for RNA transcriptomic analysis. Bloods and chest x-rays were done
if clinically required.
Patients in the azithromycin group received 500 mg azithromycin once daily orally plus
standard care for 14 days and those in the control group received standard care according to
local guidelines. Use of corticosteroids, other immunomodulators, antibiotics, and antivirals
was permitted after randomisation in the control group, but the protocol excluded concomitant

use of quinolone or macrolides antibiotics at enrolment or during follow-up. Subsequent
assessments were carried out by telephone at days 14 and 28, and radiology results and
review of notes daily during hospital admission if this occurred.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with hospital admission or death from
any cause within 28 days from randomisation.
Secondary outcomes included the proportion of participants with hospital admission with
respiratory failure requiring Non-Invasive Mechanical Ventilation (NIV) or Invasive Mechanical
Ventilation (IMV) or death from any cause within 28 days from randomisation; the proportion
of participants with hospital admission with respiratory failure requiring IMV or non-IMV
support or death from any cause over 28 days from randomisation amongst those with a PCRconfirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 at randomisation; mortality or all-cause hospital admission
amongst those with a PCR-confirmed diagnosis; all-cause mortality; the proportion
progressing to clinician-diagnosed pneumonia; the proportion progressing to severe
pneumonia; differences in the peak severity of illness according to a nine-level ordinal severity
score for clinical condition described in the protocol (Appendix 1). We also assessed safety
and tolerability of azithromycin based on adverse events.
Statistical analysis and Protocol changes
We had originally planned for the trial to recruit up to 800 participants and use the following
primary outcome: the proportion participants with hospital admission with respiratory failure
requiring Non-Invasive Mechanical Ventilation (NIV) or Invasive Mechanical Ventilation (IMV)
or death from any cause within 28 days from randomisation. However, a decision was made
at the pre-planned interim analysis of 109 participants reaching the 28-day post-randomisation
time-point to update the primary outcome as no primary outcomes had at that stage occurred.
This implied that the original primary outcome, specified early in the pandemic when data on
hospitalisation rates in this population were unknown, proved incorrect for this population. The
change was adopted in line with advice from the data safety monitoring committee and in
accordance with the recommendations of the World Health Organisation Blueprint for Covid19 Therapeutic Trials22 that the primary endpoint should be responsive to the eligible patient
population and the definition of the endpoint should be fine-tuned for the Pivotal Phase, based
on the Pilot Phase of the Trial. This change was approved by the research ethics committee
and the MHRA on February 4th 2021 and implemented before final analyses were performed.
Two other protocol amendments were performed while the trial was ongoing to broaden
inclusion criteria to include and ensure the safety of participants taking serotonin-specific
reuptake inhibitors (Appendix 1).
Based on WHO recommendations that a pilot phase with 100 patients would be
sufficient to inform follow-on clinical research22 an interim analysis was planned to determine
definitive sample size. Following the revision to the primary outcome and based on blinded
data from the pilot phase, the definitive sample size was determined. Assuming a 15% rate of
all cause hospitalisation or death in the standard care arm, we estimated a minimum of 276
participants providing primary end-point data, would provide 80% power and 5% (2-sided)
significance to detect a difference from 15% to 5% in the Azithromycin arm, a relative reduction
of 66%. To allow for 5% loss to follow-up we therefore aimed to recruit a minimum of 291
participants. The full statistical analysis plan is provided in Appendix 2.

For the primary outcome the difference in proportions between the treatment arms was
assessed using a chi-squared test and a 5% (2-sided) significance level. Adjusted analysis
was undertaken using logistic regression with progression as the binary outcome, adjusting
for stratification factors: centre, hypertension, diabetes and sex. A supporting analysis was
also undertaken to further adjust for other important prognostic variables: age ≥65 years,
presence of chronic lung disease, and treatment for cancer. Time to event analysis was also
undertaken to explore whether the active treatment delays progression. The success of the
trial was based on the adjusted analysis. Both relative and absolute differences in proportions
are reported together with 95% confidence intervals. Other binary outcomes were assessed
using similar methods. Peak severity of illness was considered a categorical variable and
assessed using ordinal logistic regression analysis. The change in severity scale score from
baseline was summarised on a continuous scale using means, standard deviations, medians,
interquartile ranges and ranges. Analyses were performed using Stata IC V15.1 (StataCorp
LP, www.stata.com).
Efficacy and safety analyses were based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population,
defined as all randomised patients analysed according to their randomised allocation. A
supplementary ITT population (ITT +ve) was defined as all randomised patients with a positive
baseline COVID-19 test based on baseline swabs. This trial was registered with
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04381962) and EudraCT (2020-001740-26).
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data
interpretation, or writing of the report. TSCH, LC, AW, SJD, RK and DR had full access to all
the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.

Results
From 3rd June 2020 to 29th January 2021 1192 patients were screened, of whom 649 were
ineligible, 84 declined consent, 161 were excluded for other reasons and 298 were enrolled in
the trial (Figure 1, and Appendix 3 Table S1). Three participants withdrew consent and
requested removal of all data collected so are not presented in baseline data. 295 of the 298
randomised participants (99%) were included in the ITT population, of whom 147 were
randomised to azithromycin plus standard care and 148 to standard care alone. Three of the
295 remaining patients withdrew consent after randomisation (Appendix 3 Table S9). Data on
the primary outcome were available from 292 participants.
Characteristics of participants assigned to azithromycin and to standard care were similar
(Table 1, and Appendix 3 Tables S2 to S7). The mean participant age was 45·9 years (SD
14·9) and 51·5% were male. 68·1% were of White ethnicity, 15·9% Asian or Asian/British,
3·7% Black or Black/British, and 12·2% of Mixed or Other ethnicity. 70 (24·6%) of 284
participants had comorbidities, and the median duration of symptoms before enrolment was
6·02 (3·52) days. Enrolment was based on a clinical diagnosis of highly-probable Covid-19,
but the definitive results of nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 PCR were available from
231 individuals, of which 152/231 (65·8%) were positive, and constituted the ITT +ve
population, of whom 76 were randomised to azithromycin (50%) and 76 to standard care alone
(50%). 143/147 participants allocated to azithromycin (97·3%) commenced treatment, with 76
(51· 7%) achieving full compliance (taking a median 28 tablets), 51 (34·7%) non-compliant,

taking a median 6 tablets (IQR 2 to 17), and compliance unknown in 20 (13·6%)(Appendix 3
Table S8).
15 (10·3%) of 145 participants randomised to azithromycin and 17 (11·6%) of 147 participants
randomised to standard care were hospitalised or died. The primary endpoint was not
significantly different between the azithromycin and control groups (adjusted OR 0·91, 95%
CI 0·43–1·92, p=0·80; Table 2 and Appendix 3 Table S10 to 12; Figure 2 and Appendix 3
Figure S1). There was no difference in the time to hospitalisation after adjusting for
stratification factors (centre, hypertension, diabetes and sex) using logistic regression
assessed by Cox’s proportional hazard ratio (HR) 0·95 (0·46 to 1·96, p=0·89; Appendix 3
Table S12; Figure 3a). There were also no differences in the combined primary outcome of
hospitalisation or death (adjusted OR 1·02, 95% CI 0·40-2·57, p=0·97), or on time to
hospitalisation (HR 1·17, 95% CI 0·49 to 2·77), p=0·72; Figure 3b) when these analyses were
repeated on the ITT+ve population (Appendix 3 Table S12). In addition, unadjusted and fully
adjusted analyses (further adjusted for age, chronic pulmonary disease and presence of
cancer) were performed as well as analyses on the per protocol population. None of these
demonstrated significant differences (Appendix 3 Tables S21 and S22).
Only two participants in each arm required level 2 or level 3 ventilation or died. Due to the very
low number of events Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the azithromycin and control
groups which were not significantly different (Table 2). The level of oxygen support required
by each participant during hospitalisation is also summarised (Appendix 3 Figure S2). The
number of both deaths from all-causes and participants progressing to pneumonia were
similarly very low with no differences between the two groups identified (Table 2). No
participants progressed to severe pneumonia during the trial. Full details of pneumonia status
at baseline and follow-up is provided in Appendix 3 Table S14. Analyses of these outcomes
were also repeated on the ITT +ve population with no significant differences identified
(Appendix 3 Table S13).
Severity scores at baseline, days 14 and 28 are summarised in Figure 4 and Appendix 3 Table
S15 and Figure S3. The peak severity score during follow-up was calculated for each
participant. 62 (50·0%) of 124 participants randomised to azithromycin and 60 (46·2%) of 130
participants randomised to standard care reported no limitation of activities as their highest
follow-up severity score (Table 3, Appendix 3 Tables S16 and S18 and Figure S4). There was
not a significant difference between the two groups in terms of peak severity score (adjusted
OR 0·91, 95% CI 0·57-1·46, p=0·69; Table 3). Analysis was repeated for the ITT +ve
population with no significantly differences observed (Appendix 3 Table S17). The COVID-19
Core Outcome Set Plus (COS Plus) scores were similar in the two groups at both 14 days
(7.62 in the azithromycin group versus 7·47 in the standard care group) and 28 days (3·06 in
the azithromycin versus 3·38 in the standard care group) post-randomisation (Appendix 3
Table S19 and Figures S5 and S6).
During follow up additional antibiotics were co-prescribed in 23/147 (15·6%) participants in the
azithromycin arm and 38/148 (25·7%) in the standard care arm (Appendix 3 Table S23). No
SAEs were recorded in either treatment group during the course of follow-up. Three (2·1%) of
145 participants randomised to azithromycin and 4 (2·7%) of 147 participants randomised to
standard care reported a complication during hospitalisation (Appendix 3 Table S20).

Discussion
In this trial of people with clinically-diagnosed mild-moderate COVID-19 managed without
hospital admission, adding azithromycin to standard care treatment did not reduce the risk of
subsequent hospitalisation or death, or of time to hospitalisation.
Three recent, large, open-label, randomised controlled trials have assessed the use of
azithromycin in patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19, and none have found a clinicallysignificant benefit in those populations. COALITION I randomised 667 patients hospitalised
with COVID-19 to standard care, hydroxychloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin
500mg for 7 days and found no difference in clinical status on an ordinal score at 15 days
between hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine (odds ratio (OR),
0·82; 95% CI, 0·47 to 1·43; P=1·00)16. Likewise, COALITION II randomised 447 hospitalised
patients to azithromycin 500 mg daily for 10 days or standard care, and again found no
difference in day 15 ordinal score (OR 1·36, 95% CI 0·94–1·97, p=0·11).)13. RECOVERY
randomised 7,763 of its participants to azithromycin 500 mg for 10 days or standard care and
found no difference in 28-day mortality (rate ratio (RR) 0·97, 95% CI 0·87–1·07; p=0·50),
length of stay, or invasive mechanical ventilation and death15. However, none of these trials
assessed the potential for efficacy in early, milder disease.
Three trials in primary care have randomised participants with early disease to three23
or five24,25 days of therapy. Azithromycin was assessed as standalone therapy only in the
PRINCIPLE trial23: a large, adaptive platform trial in the UK, which randomised 540
participants to 3 days treatment with azithromycin 500 mg daily versus 875 to standard care.
This study found no difference in time to first reported recovery (hazard ratio (HR) 1·08, 95%
Bayesian credibility interval 0·95 to 1·23), and, though only 3% of participants were
hospitalised, there was no significant difference between groups (absolute benefit in 0·3%,
95% BCI –1·7 to 2·2). The remaining two trials also used short courses of azithromycin of 500
mg for one day followed by 250 mg for 4 days and taken in conjunction with
hydroxychloroquine. Q-PROTECT recruited healthy, SARS-CoV-2-positive men in a
quarantine site in Qatar and found no difference in time to virological cure (p=0·82)24, with low
rates of hospitalisation in all groups (2·4%). A study in the USA assessed progression to lower
respiratory tract infection, hospitalisation or death and time to viral clearance in SARS-CoV-2positive outpatients, but was stopped early for futility due to a low rate of clinical outcomes in
this population also, and found no difference in the co-primary outcome of time to virologic
clearance (HR=1·25, 95% CI 0·75 to 2·07, p=0·39)25. No studies have assessed azithromycin
in those presenting to hospital with significant symptoms, but early enough in the disease
process to be managed in ambulant care, and neither have previous studies assessed high
dose, long-duration azithromycin therapy in early disease.
Our study investigated this intermediate population with early disease, but at high risk
of deterioration, in whom 10·6% required subsequent hospitalisation, and therefore represents
a population with the optimal chance of demonstrating clinical benefit in early disease. This,
taken together with clear negative results across the disease course from early, low risk
patients, to severe hospitalised disease, provides strong confirmation that azithromycin is not

A unique feature of ATOMIC2 was its successful implementation at the interface
between community and secondary care – often a challenging location to recruit due to
pressures for rapid clinical decision making – which was made possible by electronic
screening, consent and recruitment. This platform, along with simplicity and broad inclusion
criteria, have facilitated a second strength of the study: inclusion of an ethnically diverse
population with 31·8% of participants recruited from Black and minority ethnic (BAME)
backgrounds. This is important as COVID-19 is a global pandemic, with a disproportionate
impact on BAME groups, yet these groups are underrepresented in many COVID-19 trials,
which may reduce external validity26. Thirdly in contrast to other studies the high dose (500
mg daily) and long duration (14 days) of azithromycin was selected in our study to ensure that
we adequately assessed potential antiviral, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory benefits.
COVID-19 is considered to have a distinct early viraemic phase and a late inflammatory phase
in some individuals, and therefore assessment of antiviral activity needs to be early in the
disease course prior to onset of severe disease20. Conversely it was not known what doses
might be required to produce an adequate anti-inflammatory effect and so it was necessary to
give a high dose of long duration to ensure the anti-inflammatory effect was tested throughout
the late stage of innate/ acute phase inflammatory cytokine dysregulation1. An additional
strength is that we were also able to exclude a significant benefit from azithromycin’s antibiotic
effects, which was not possible in hospitalised studies where co-prescribing of !-lactam and
other antibiotics was common15. Our data show that secondary bacterial infection is not a
major driver of admission in this population.
A limitation of our trial is that it was open-label, due to the difficulty obtaining
appropriate placebos early in the pandemic, and is therefore at risk of bias particularly on
patient reported outcomes. However, our choice of hospitalisation and death as the primary
outcome is unlikely to be markedly influenced by selection, detection or observer bias.
Detection of hospitalisation episodes has benefitted from restricted movement during
lockdowns, from use of regional and national electronic health records and by systematic
contacting of all participants, with >95% follow-up. Moreover, a placebo effect from perceived
benefits of treatment would tend towards a positive effect of azithromycin which was not
observed. Knowledge of treatment allocation may also lead to a tendency to more antibiotic
prescribing in the placebo group – an effect we observed – which would tend to prejudice
against azithromycin as an antibiotic, although concomitant use of macrolides specifically was
prohibited by the protocol. A second limitation is that, like other studies23, we used a clinical
diagnosis for inclusion, rather than requiring PCR confirmation, and PCR data were not
available on all participants – particularly at the early stages of the pandemic in the UK where
limited testing capacity was directed to patients who needed admission to hospital. Whilst it is
likely some participants who did not ultimately have COVID-19 may have been enrolled, this
decision reflects the situation in many urgent care settings globally where PCR confirmation
is not immediately available, and enhances the generalisability of our findings. Nonetheless,
SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 65·6% of those with successful PCR assays, much higher than
the 31% PCR-positive rate observed in PRINCIPLE23, and study results were similar in the
overall ITT group and the predefined PCR-positive subgroup analysis. Two other limitations
are lack of data on microbiology and on long term outcomes beyond 28 days.
In the past year over 40 clinical trials of azithromycin in COVID-19 have been
registered1. Given positive data from in silico and in vitro2 screens and data showing
suppression of innate inflammatory cytokines in vitro, and clinical trial data in non-SARS-CoV-

2 alpha and beta coronaviruses7, why might these have not translated into clinical efficacy?
Other antiviral molecules have had little clinical effect in COVID-19 compared with
immunosuppressive therapies, except in very early disease. In common with influenza, it is
likely that antivirals are only efficacious in the early viraemic disease stage and are ineffective
in severe disease which is more closely linked to differences in host immune factors. In
contrast to influenza A pandemics, the antibacterial effects of azithromycin are unlikely to
translate into significant clinical benefit in a disease where secondary bacterial pneumonia is
rare27. Whilst many studies have shown azithromycin suppression of innate cytokines
including IL-1β, IL-6, CXCL-8, TNF and GM-CSF – known to be key mediators of severe
disease – some of these data may be confounded by antibacterial effects in the original
studies, and it may be that the suppression achieved by azithromycin is simply insufficient to
overcome the overwhelming cytokine production triggered by this virus in susceptible
individuals.
We found no evidence of harm to individuals, despite the relatively high-dose and long
course prescribed, and in particular there were no adverse cardiac events; a concern raised
by studies of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine co-prescribing28. In a Danish cohort
analysis of 10·6 million prescriptions, azithromycin prescribing has been associated
cardiovascular death (rate ratio 2·85) compared with no antibiotics, but this is likely to result
from the underlying indication as, when compared with penicillin V, there was no increased
risk once adjusted for propensity scores (rate ratio 0·93)29. This analysis was performed in a
population with a low baseline risk of cardiovascular death, and it should be noted we excluded
patients with a prolonged QT interval at baseline electrocardiogram. Nonetheless, there are
considerable population risks of unwarranted prescribing of azithromycin, which is a highly
valuable antimicrobial and yet has a particularly high propensity for inducing antimicrobial
resistance, both to macrolides and to other drug classes including β-lactam antibiotics30.
In conclusion, our findings in mild-moderate COVID managed in ambulatory care,
taken together with trials in early disease in primary care and from trials severe hospitalised
disease, suggest there is no evidence that azithromycin reduces hospitalisation, respiratory
failure or death compared with standard care, and should not be used in the treatment of
COVID-19.
