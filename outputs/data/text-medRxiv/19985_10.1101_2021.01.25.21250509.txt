Summary
Background: Airport quarantine is required to reduce the risk of entry of travelers
infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However,
it is challenging for both high accuracy and rapid turn-around time to coexist in testing;
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is time-consuming with high accuracy, while antigen
testing is rapid with less accuracy.
Methods: 88,924 (93.2%) of 95,457 arrivals at three international airports in Japan
were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using self-collected saliva by a screening strategy with
initial chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) followed by confirmatory
nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) only for intermediate range antigen
concentrations.
Results: 254 (0.27%) persons were found to be SARS-CoV-2 antigen positive (≥ 4.0
pg/mL) by CLEIA. NAAT was required for confirmatory testing in 513 (0.54%) persons
with intermediate antigen concentrations (0.67-4.0 pg/mL) whereby the virus was
detected in 34 (6.6%) persons. This two-step strategy dramatically reduced the
utilization of NAAT to approximately one out of every 200 test subjects.
Estimated performance of this strategy did not show significant increase in false
negatives as compared to performing NAAT in all subjects. Further reduction in
imported cases may be achieved by post-screening quarantine.
Conclusions: Point of care testing by quantitative CLEIA using self-collected saliva is
less labor-intensive and yields results rapidly, thus suitable as an initial screening test.
Reserving NAAT for CLEIA indeterminate cases may prevent compromising accuracy
while significantly improving the logistics of administering mass-screening at large
venues.

Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, PCR, CLEIA, quarantine
Introduction
The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced many countries to
introduce border closures to prevent the entry of infected travelers from regions where
COVID-19 is rife1-3. However, this decision has brought on heavy social and economic
repercussions. Now several countries have been increasingly accepting international
flights, albeit with quarantine for any traveler suspected of infection by various tests4-7.
Testing measures include PCR before departure, temperature and symptom check at
airports, and PCR testing at arrival.
Due to the high volume of international air travel, performing the virus tests
with high accuracy in rapid turnaround time has been challenging. Currently, the “gold
standard” of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection
is nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), such as the quantitative reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples8, 9.
Recently, self-collected saliva has attracted attention as an alternative sample with
significant logistic advantages over NPS10. Specifically, self-collection eliminates the
requirement of specialized medical personnel and allows simultaneous parallel sample
collection thus more suitable for mass screening9, 11. We and others have shown that the
accuracy of self-collected saliva and NPS samples are equivalent in large scale direct
comparative studies 12-14. However, although PCR is highly accurate and reliable, results
may take 24-48 hours to return. Such delays may lead to further transmission of
disease15, especially in the confines of airport transit. Recently, we and others have
shown the utility of a novel quantitative antigen test using chemiluminescent enzyme
immunoassay

amplification (LAMP) to detect SARS-CoV-2 proteins and nucleic acids, respectively,
within 30 minutes14, 16. Accordingly, a novel two-step strategy using these tests have
been implemented for mass screening of SARS-CoV-2 at airport quarantines in Japan17.
We herein evaluated utility of this strategy in 88,924 persons and estimated its
performance in several clinical scenarios.

Methods
Design and Population
Testing for SARS-CoV-2 using either self-collected saliva or NPS samples obtained by
medical officers was mandatory for all international arrivals between July 29 and
September 30, 2020. Due to logistical advantages, vast majority of tests were performed
using self-collected saliva. Samples were collected in a sterilized 15mL polystyrene
sputum collection tube (Toyo Kizai, Warabi, Japan) and all specimens were analysed at
the airport quarantine laboratories. This study was approved by the Institutional Ethics
Board (Hokkaido University Hospital Division of Clinical Research Administration
Number: 020-0116) and anonymously processed data were provided by the quarantine
stations.

Two-step strategy using CLEIA and NAAT
Initially, all specimens were tested by CLEIA with positive and negative thresholds of
4.0pg/mL and 0.67pg/mL, respectively, as previously reported17. Concentrations in
between the thresholds were considered indeterminate, and only these specimens
underwent confirmatory testing by NAAT.

CLEIA
Lumipulse SARS-CoV-2 Ag kit (Fujirebio, Tokyo, Japan), a sandwich CLEIA using
monoclonal antibodies that recognize SARS-CoV-2 N-Ag on LUMIPULSE G1200
automated machine (Fujirebio), was used as previously described17. The detection range
is between 0.01 pg/mL and 5000 pg/mL.

NAAT
Saliva was diluted 4-fold with phosphate buffered saline and centrifuged at 20,000 × g
for 5 min to remove cells and debris. RNA was extracted from 200 µL of the
supernatant using QIAsymphony DSP Virus/Pathogen kit and QIAamp Viral RNA Mini
Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Then, nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2 were detected
by either PCR or LAMP. PCR tests were performed as previsouly described14. The cycle
threshold (Ct)-values were obtained using N2 primers (NIID_2019-nCOV_N_F2,
NIID_2019-nCOV_N_R2) and a probe (NIID_2019-nCOV_N_P2). LAMP was carried
out to detect

SARS-CoV-2 RNA using Loopamp®

2019-SARS-CoV-2 Detection

Reagent Kit (Eiken Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) and the Loopamp Real-time Turbidimeter
(Eiken Chemical) as previously described14.

Statistical analysis
We compared the estimated effectiveness of three mass-screening strategies at border
quarantine: the two-step strategy, NAAT only for all entrants (without CLEIA), and
test-free entry, expressed as the rate of false negatives per 100,000 persons and the
number of NAATs performed. The rate of false negatives by NAAT was estimated by p
× FN/Pos where p is the assumed proportion of the test population with positive NAAT,

and FN/Pos defined as the ratio of false negatives to all positives (i.e. the ratio of
undetected infectees to persons diagnosed as infected). Four scenarios with p values of
0·1%, 0·2%, 0·5%, and 1·0% were used for analyses, with a factor of 0.76 (probability
of CLEIA positivity given NAAT positivity) applied to the p values for the two-step
strategy, consistent with our previous report17. FN/Pos was set at 0·4 in accordance to a
recent report showing 136 and 52 positive results at airport screening and during
post-entry compulsory quarantine, respectively18. Additional analyses were performed
for FN/Pos set at 1.0 and 2.0. The impact of 14-day quarantine was calculated in all
cases as a linear variable of adherence rates with all false negatives becoming apparent
with adherence rate of 100%. By expressing a as the probability of CLEIA-positive
given NAAT-positive, the rate of false negatives by CLEIA may be calculated as p ×
[FN/Pos + (1 - a)]. All statistical analyses were conducted by R 4·0·2 (R Foundation for
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

Results
88,924 persons screened by the two-step strategy using self-collected saliva accounted
for 88.0% of all arrivals to Japan during the period. Initial CLEIA was found to be
positive in 254 (0.29%) persons (Fig. 1). The 513 samples (0.58%) with antigen
concentrations in the indeterminate range (between 0·67 pg/mL and 4·00 pg/mL)
proceeded to NAAT with 34 (6.6%) positive results. 254 (99.2%) of the 288 positive
results were diagnosed by the initial CLEIA, with only 34 (11·8%) diagnosed by NAAT.
On the other hand, of the 88,636 persons who tested negative, NAAT was performed in
only 479 (0·54%). The median [IQR] antigen concentrations were 9·70 [4·98-34·11]
pg/mL and 0·10 [0·01-0·19] pg/mL in the NAAT-positive and -negative samples,

respectively. In specimens negative by NAAT, the frequency of high antigen
concentrations monotonically approached zero, while NAAT positives did not follow
any trend (Fig. 2).
Comparing the effectiveness of the three strategies, the number of false
negatives was greater in the two-step strategy compared to NAAT only in all scenarios
of NAAT positivity, although both tests reduced false negative rates by more than half
compared to test-free entry (Table 1). Conversely, the two-step strategy allowed the
reduction of NAAT by approximately 95% compared to when NAAT was used in all
persons. For example, in the scenario when p=0.1%, the NAAT only strategy detected
40 false negatives by 100,000 NAATs, whereas the two-step strategy resulted in 64 false
negatives but only required 549 NAATs to be performed. Furthermore, as the majority
of CLEIA indeterminates were NAAT negative, the number of NAATs needed did not
significantly increase with varying scenarios of p.
When FN/Pos was set at 0.4, 0.1, and 2.0 in the scenario where p = 0.1%, the
ratio of false negatives by NAAT only : two-step : free entry was 40 : 64 : 140 (i.e. 1 :
1.6 : 3.5), 100 : 124 : 200 (i.e. 1 : 1.2 : 2.0), and 200 : 224 : 300 (i.e. 1 : 1.1 : 1.5),
respectively, showing increasingly diminished relative difference in efficacy between
the three screening strategies (Table 2). Regardless of FN/Pos, post-screening 14-day
quarantine substantially reduced imported false negatives, although the efficacy of
quarantine was highly dependent on the degree of adherence (Table 2).

Discussion
Although PCR is a standard of care for the detection of SARS-CoV-2,
mandatory mass-screening should ideally avoid time-consuming and labor-intensive

procedures. In this regard, quantitative antigen test by CLEIA is rapid albeit with
slightly less accuracy than PCR17. Therefore, our two-step strategy combined the utility
of initial CLEIA with the accuracy of NAAT only for diagnosis of indeterminate cases.
This two-step strategy has been adopted in quarantine stations at the international
airports in Japan, especially for the prevention of long waiting times spent in closed
spaces in crowds and close-contact situations. Here, we showed the benefits of this
strategy using 88,924 samples, providing numerical estimates of undetected infectees
under various circumstances. The quantitative antigen testing allows for setting
appropriate positive and negative thresholds to freely define the indeterminate range
with a trade-off; a wider range improves test performance but at the expense of
increasing the requirement of confirmatory NAAT. These thresholds may be altered to
suit different clinical situations19, most importantly the local prevalence of disease.
Initial CLEIA has excellent specificity with the upper cutoff value at 4·00
pg/mL, as increasing antigen concentrations of NAAT negative samples consistently
approach zero (Fig. 2b). Assuming that the frequency continues to decrease by one for
every 0·5 pg/mL, 36 NAAT-negative samples would be included between 4 pg/mL and
8 pg/mL, giving specificity as high as 99·96% (=88,636/(88,636+36)). To further reduce
the false positive rates, the upper cutoff may be set at higher values, but at the expense
of increased requirement for confirmatory NAAT. For example, raising the upper cut-off
from 4 pg/mL to 8 pg/mL would increase the number of indeterminate results and hence
the number of NAAT from 513 to 603 (Fig. 2a). The main objective of screening for
SARS-CoV-2 is to detect all transmissible persons, and this has been a great challenge
with presymptomatic false negative PCR at 67% one day prior to and 38% on the day of
symptom onset20. Therefore, in order to accurately identify presymptomatic infectees,
8

pre-departure testing should be conducted several days before departure. Assuming that
all passengers were asymptomatic with negative results before departure, infectees will
most likely be in the latent phase at the time of screening. Given the median incubation
period of 5 days21-23, testing five days prior to departure should reveal half the infections
(i.e. FN/Pos ≃ 1.0) as false positives are very rare. Shorter intervals between
pre-departure testing and inbound screening would yield more presymptomatic false
negatives, and reduce operational test sensitivity3, 20. Illustrating this point, our results
showed the ratio of false negatives comparing NAAT only to the two step strategy was
40 : 64 (i.e. 1 : 1.6) and 200 : 224 (i.e. 1 : 1.1) setting FN/Pos at 0.4 and 2.0,
respectively. This trend was consistently seen in all scenarios of p and between any two
strategies, indicating the vulnerability of depending on any test at a single time-point.
Regardless of testing strategy, post-screening quarantine performed very well at
limiting import cases of false negatives in any scenario. However, perfect adherence to
two weeks of compulsory isolation by all travelers is unrealistic, with detrimental
psychological, social, and economic impact for those who do comply24-26. Recently,
Wells et al. reported that testing on day 6 may reduce the duration of a 14-day
quarantine by 50% while effectively preventing expected transmission events27. As with
pre-departure, the timing of testing is essential as infected individuals very early in
the incubation period may not be detected due to low viral loads. Nevertheless,

mass screening at airport has benefits in reducing false negatives, especially in
combination with well-timed pre-departure testing (i.e. when FN/Pos is small).
Furthermore, screening is useful in monitoring the dynamics of test positivity, which
may influence various immigration and health policies as well as suggest the possibility
of viral mutations.

The main limitation of our study was the lack of clinical information after
screening to assess the rates of observed false positivity. Post-screening investigation of
more than 80,000 persons was simply out of the scope of this study. An additional
limitation was that the probability of CLEIA-positive given NAAT-positive could not be
validated, as NAAT was not performed for CLEIA-negative samples (antigen levels
below 0·67pg/mL). Finally, although not truly a limitation of our study, we alluded to
NAAT positivity as infectiousness, whereas this may not be true in cases of high Ct
values28, 29.
In summary, we examined the data from mass screening of more than 88,000
persons at airport quarantines and showed the effectiveness of the two-step strategy. We
believe the logistic advantage of reducing the burden of NAAT by approximately 95%
far outweigh the cost of slightly higher imported cases of false negatives. Two-step
testing by CLEIA followed by NAAT is effective in real-world situations, especially
when combined with appropriately timed pre-departure testing and/or with quarantine
optimized with repeat testing.

Figure Legends
Figure 1. Flow chart of mass screening of international arrivals by the two-step strategy
88,924 arrivals at international airports were screened using self-collected saliva. Initial
CLEIA results were positive in 254 (0.28%) and negative in 88,157 (99.14%) persons.
Confirmatory NAAT was only performed for samples in the indeterminate range (n=513;
0.58%).

Figure 2. Barplots of viral antigen concentrations
(a) The frequency of viral antigen concentrations of the entire test population sorted by final
diagnosis by the two-step strategy (288 positives and 88,636 negatives). (b) The frequency of
antigen concentration in 513 persons judged to be indeterminate by initial CLEIA.
NAAT was only performed for CLEIA results with antigen concentrations between 0.67 and
4.0pg/mL. The frequency of NAAT negative samples consistently approach zero with
increasing antigen concentrations, while NAAT positives did not show any trend.
