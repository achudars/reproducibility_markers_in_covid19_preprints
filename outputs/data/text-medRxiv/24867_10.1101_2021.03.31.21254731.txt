ABSTRACT
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted learning as many institutions switched to
remote or hybrid instruction. An in-depth assessment of the risk of infection that takes into
account environmental setting and mitigation strategies is needed to make safe and informed
decisions regarding reopening university spaces. A quantitative model of infection probability
that accounts for space-specific parameters is presented to enable assessment of the risk in
reopening university spaces at given densities. The model uses local positivity rate, room
capacity, mask filtration efficiency, air exchange rate, room volume, and time spent in the space
as parameters to calculate infection probabilities in teaching spaces, dining halls, dorms, and
shared bathrooms. The model readily calculates infection probabilities in various university
spaces, with mask filtration efficiency and air exchange rate being among the dominant
variables. When applied to university spaces, this model demonstrated that, under specific
conditions that are feasible to implement, in-person classes could be held in large lecture halls
with an infection risk over the semester < 1%. Meal pick-ups from dining halls and the use of
shared bathrooms in residential dormitories among small groups of students could also be
accomplished with low risk. The results of applying this model to spaces at Harvard University
(Cambridge and Allston campuses) and Stanford University are reported. Finally, a user-friendly
web application was developed using this model to calculate infection probability following
input of space-specific variables. The successful development of a quantitative model and its
implementation through a web application may facilitate accurate assessments of infection risk in
university spaces. In light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on universities, this tool
could provide crucial insight to students, faculty, and university officials in making informed
decisions.

INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic has immensely impacted academia, with many higher learning
institutions switching to remote or hybrid learning models for the first time (Smalley, 2020).
While these policies have reduced widespread transmission, they have adversely affected
learning, admissions, enrollment, athletics, campus activities, and housing. With the shift to
virtual classes and students divided across the globe, challenges have arisen for instructors and
students, including decreased academic engagement, syphoned access to academic resources,
inability to recreate in-person activities, and obstacles for synchronous learning. A primary
question university administrators face is the possibility of resuming some form of in-person
classes while keeping infection risk low. This paper details how severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection risk is impacted by various university settings,
such as dining, residential, and teaching spaces, and presents a user-friendly web application for
assessing infection risk in these spaces.
Infection by SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 (Yuen et al., 2020), and the mechanism of
SARS-CoV-2 transmission is impacted by viral particle movement. SARS-CoV-2 virions are
approximately 0.1 μm in diameter (Bar-On et al., 2020). They are emitted as droplets and
aerosols by infected individuals during turbulent respiratory events (e.g., coughing and sneezing)
and while breathing and speaking (Jayaweera et al., 2020; Mittal et al., 2020). Droplets are
typically larger particles (>5 µm) and rapidly fall to underlying surfaces. In contrast, aerosols
(particles <5 µm) evaporate faster than they fall (Augenbraun et al., 2020; Jayaweera, et al.,
2020). Consequently, aerosols containing viral particles can remain suspended for hours or days
and travel farther than droplets, increasing infection risk (Augenbraun et al., 2020; van
Doremalen et al., 2020). Even after an infected individual has left a room, others can inhale viral

particles emitted earlier. Aerosols therefore appear to pose the greatest risk of SARS-CoV-2
transmission (Augenbraun et al., 2020; van Doremalen et al., 2020). This study focuses on
SARS-CoV-2 transmission through aerosols.
Key parameters impacting airborne transmission include face mask usage and ventilation.
Face mask usage is recommended to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission (CDC, NCIRD, 2021b),
as masks filter incoming airborne particles and trap outgoing respiratory secretions (Mittal et al.,
2020). There are three main classifications of protective face masks: respirators, surgical masks,
and cloth face coverings (The Royal Society, 2020). Different masks of varying filtration
efficacy may best suit the levels of risk for particular settings, activities, or individuals. For
instance, N95 respirators, which have 95% filtration efficiency, provide greater protection than
surgical and cloth masks (CDC, NIOSH, 2020). Numerous studies have analyzed mask filtration
efficacies and their impact on mitigating infection risk (Fischer et al., 2020; Konda et al., 2020).
Aerosolized viral particles can linger in closed spaces for extended durations, so ventilation can
also decrease infection risk (CDC, NCIRD, 2021a). HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air
Conditioning) systems aid in circulating air and diluting viral particle concentrations (EPA,
2020). HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filters, often used in combination with
ventilation, can efficiently remove particles from the air.
A straightforward risk analysis method is needed to better understand the SARS-CoV-2
infection risk in university spaces. A mathematical model exists for calculating infection
probabilities (Watanabe et al., 2010) and has recently been utilized for assessing SARS-CoV-2
infection risk in laboratories and office settings (Augenbraun et al., 2020). Here, that model is
adapted to calculate output parameters relevant to the re-opening and occupancy of university
spaces, including teaching, dining, and residential spaces. A web application has been developed

that allows users to input the necessary metrics into the model, which outputs the infection
probability in a given space.

METHODS
General Approach for Calculations in University Spaces
Approaches for calculating infection probabilities were developed for three types of
university spaces: teaching spaces, dining halls, and residential spaces. These approaches
followed the steps in Figure 1.

Teaching Spaces
In-person classes in both large lecture halls and smaller classrooms were analyzed. Input
parameters include:
1. University’s COVID-19 positivity rate, RP
2. Normal seating capacity, NS
3. Face mask filtration efficiency, F
4. Air exchange rate (hr-1), r
5. Teaching space volume (L), V
6. Class length (min), tf
7. Number of classes attended in that space over the semester, NCls
Assuming students follow 6 feet social distancing guidelines and each seat is approximately 2
feet x 2 feet, the maximum number of students in the space (NStu) is:
! ∗ $ %& " /()*&

NStu = +,! %& " /(&-.)/&

It is made available under a CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license .

Assuming the number of infected students is proportional to the university’s positivity rate,
the number of infected students in the space (NInf) is:
NInf = RP * NStu

(2)

Assuming students wear the designated face mask at all times during the class, the amount of
dilution of particles in the air, i.e. the dilution factor, due to the mask (𝐷0*(1 ) is:
𝐷0*(1 = 1 – F

(3)

The dilution factor due to HVAC system (𝐷2345 ) is:
𝐷2345 (𝑡)= e-rt

(4)

where t is the time point of measurement (hr) and r is the air exchange rate of the space.
(Augenbraun et al., 2020).
Assuming perfect mixing of particles in the total air in the room volume, the increase in viral
particle density (𝛥⍴) in air each minute is:
# of viral particles exhaled each minute = NVP= NInf * 70 particles
𝛥⍴ =

𝑁𝑉𝑃
𝑉

× 𝐷𝑀𝑎𝑠𝑘

(5)

At each time point t, up to the duration of one class period, the local density n(t) of viral
particles (particles/L) in the air inhaled by a healthy individual in the teaching space is
incremented by a factor proportional to 𝛥⍴, 𝐷0*(1 , and 𝐷2345 .
For example, if measuring the local density n(t) in the air inhaled at the time point of 3
minutes, assuming each minute is a discrete time point, viral density from t = 1 minute has been
diluted by the HVAC system for 3 minutes, viral density from t = 2 minutes has been diluted for
2 minutes, and viral density from t = 3 minutes has been diluted for 1 minute. Therefore:
n (3 min) = ⍴ (1 𝑚𝑖𝑛) × 𝐷2345 (3 𝑚𝑖𝑛) × 𝐷0*(1 + ⍴ (2 𝑚𝑖𝑛) × 𝐷2345 (2 𝑚𝑖𝑛) × 𝐷0*(1 +
⍴ (3 𝑚𝑖𝑛) × 𝐷2345 (1 𝑚𝑖𝑛) × 𝐷0*(1

(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
It is made available under a CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license .

Since each time is being treated as a discrete interval, ⍴(1 min), ⍴(2 min) and ⍴(3 min) all
equal 𝛥⍴, resulting in the relationship:
𝑛 (3 𝑚𝑖𝑛) = 𝛥⍴ × 𝐷2345 (1 𝑚𝑖𝑛) × 𝐷0*(1 + 𝛥⍴ × 𝐷𝐻𝑉𝐴𝐶 (2 𝑚𝑖𝑛) × 𝐷𝑀𝑎𝑠𝑘 + 𝛥⍴ ×
𝐷𝐻𝑉𝐴𝐶 (3 𝑚𝑖𝑛) × 𝐷𝑀𝑎𝑠𝑘
Thus, the local density n(t) in inhaled air at time point t is determined. Using the volume of
air inhaled per minute, 7.5 L/min (derived from volume inhaled per hour, 450 L/min), the viral
dose inhaled each minute is determined. The summation of the viral doses inhaled during each
minute gives the total viral dose inhaled over the class period:
&%

𝑑5?*(( = - [𝑛(𝑡) × 7.5𝐿/𝑚𝑖𝑛]

(6)

&@A

Then, the viral dose inhaled over the semester is:
𝑑B)C = 𝑑5?*(( × 𝑁5?(

(7)

Finally, probability of infection, as described by Watanabe et al. (2010) is:
𝑝 (𝑑B)C ) = 1 − 𝑒𝑥𝑝(

−𝑑B)C
)
100

(8)

To calculate required wait times between classes held in the same teaching space, the
following process was utilized:
The contribution to infection probability made by the viral density from the previous class
must be negligible to avoid additive effects for students in the next class. Therefore, the
threshold for the maximum probability of infection from one class to the next over the semester
was set as 0.1%.
The following parameters are first defined:
Final viral density in the air at the end of this class: ⍴D
Viral density in the air at the start of the next class: ⍴!5

The local density of residual viral particles from the last class (particles/L) in air inhaled by a
healthy individual during the next class, 𝑛!5 (𝑡), is:
𝑛!5 (𝑡) = ⍴!5 × 𝐷2345 (𝑡) × 𝐷0*(1

(9)

The residual viral dose inhaled by a healthy individual in the next class, dNC , is:
&%

𝑑!5 = - [𝑛!5 (𝑡) × 7.5 𝐿/𝑚𝑖𝑛]

(10)

&@A

Using this information and the previously described procedure for calculating infection
probability, a value for ⍴!5 that produces a probability of infection from the next class over the
semester that is < 0.1% can be found.
Finally, the required wait time (𝜏) for the viral density to dilute from ⍴D to ⍴!5 is:
⍴!5
𝜏 = −𝑙𝑛 >
? /𝑟
⍴D
where r is the air exchange rate of the space.

Dining Halls
For dining halls, both in-person dining and meal pick-up scenarios were analyzed. The
approach taken was very similar to that of teaching spaces. Input parameters include:
1. University’s COVID-19 positivity rate, RP
2. Normal seating capacity, NS
3. Filtration efficiency of face masks worn (if any), F
4. Air exchange rate (hr-1), r
5. Dining hall volume (L), V
6. Amount of time spent in dining hall per meal (min), tf
7. Number of weeks in the semester, NWks

Furthermore, it was assumed that students eat 3 meals per day, 7 days per week, and that face
masks are not worn in the in-person dining scenario. In the meal pick-up scenario, it was
assumed that students remain 6 feet distanced at all times, adhere to the length of meal pick-up
windows, and do not pause to interact with others during the meal pick-up.
With these parameters and assumptions, the same approach used for teaching spaces was
implemented to calculate infection probabilities for in-person dining and meal pick-ups, as well
as required wait times between meal pick-up batches.

Residential spaces
Dorm rooms and bathrooms, two of the largest sources of interaction between students in
residential buildings, were analyzed.
Dorm Rooms.
Input parameters include:
1. Number of students sharing the dorm room, NStu
2. Air exchange rate (hr-1), r
3. Dorm room volume (L), V
4. Amount of time spent in the dorm room per day, tf
It was assumed that face masks are not worn within the dorm room. The infection probability
was calculated over a 2-week period rather than the entire semester as was done for the other
spaces. This was done to cover the typical 2-week infection period of an individual with COVID19.
With these parameters and assumptions, the same approach to calculating infection
probability that was used for teaching spaces was implemented.

Bathrooms.
Input parameters include:
1. Number of students per dorm room, NStu
2. Number of dorm rooms sharing the bathroom, NRms
3. Air exchange rate (hr-1), r
4. Bathroom volume (L), V
5. Amount of time per bathroom use (min), tB
6. Amount of time per shower use (min), tS
7. Wait time between bathroom uses (min), 𝜏WB
8. Wait time between shower uses (min), 𝜏WS
9. Number of bathroom uses per day, NB
10. Number of shower uses per day, NS
It is important to note that unlike other university spaces, bathroom wait times are an input
parameter rather than a calculated output parameter. This is because wait times between
bathroom uses and shower uses are interrelated, i.e. if the wait time between shower uses is
lengthened, the wait time between bathroom uses may be shortened safely. Therefore, the exact
balance between these parameters must be a user decision rather than a calculated output.
It was assumed that face masks are worn at all times in the bathroom, except during shower
use. It was also assumed that showers are located in the bathroom. The infection probability was
again calculated over a 2-week period rather than the entire semester to cover the typical 2-week
infection period of an individual with COVID-19.
With these parameters and assumptions, a similar approach to that used for teaching spaces
was used to calculate the infection probability.

The final density ⍴% of viral particles in the air at the end of a bathroom use by an infected
student is calculated using the parameters, 𝛥⍴, 𝐷2345 (𝑡), and 𝐷0*(1 .
The diluted density ⍴EF? after the wait time between bathroom uses is:
⍴EF? = ⍴% × 𝑒 GHI&'

(12)

During the next bathroom use by an uninfected student, the local density n(t) of viral particles
(particles/L) at time t in air inhaled by the uninfected individual is:
𝑛(𝑡) = ⍴EF? × 𝐷2345 (𝑡) × 𝐷0*(1

(13)

The viral dose, 𝑑J , during this bathroom visit is again calculated as:
&'

𝑑J = - [𝑛(𝑡) × 7.5𝐿/𝑚𝑖𝑛]

(14)

&@A

This process can be repeated for shower uses with duration (tS) and wait time (𝜏WS). In this
case, 𝐷0*(1 would not be included, as mask-wearing while showering is unfeasible. The viral
dose during a shower visit would be 𝑑B .

Probabilities of Infection in Specific University Spaces
These approaches were applied to specific teaching spaces, dining halls, and residential
spaces in the Harvard College Cambridge campus, Harvard University Allston campus, and
Stanford University campus. Data regarding air exchange rates, seating capacities, and room
dimensions was collected for various spaces in these university campuses.

There is more variability in air flow in small classrooms due to doors/windows opening, foot
traffic, etc. For this reason, it was conservatively estimated that these spaces have air exchange
rates similar to those of office spaces, i.e. 3 air exchanges per hour (Augenbraun et al., 2020).
For large lecture halls and dining halls, however, air exchange rates were collected and used for
calculations.
Two extremes of university-wide COVID-19 positivity rates were tested. A low infection rate
(LIR) case was tested, with a 0.1% positivity rate, as well as a high infection rate (HIR) case,
with a 1% positivity rate.
Since exact numerical results depend heavily on scenario-dependent variables, a few example
scenarios in the university spaces tested (i.e. teaching spaces, dining halls, and residential spaces)
were selected. The specific scenarios to which this model was applied in different universities
are:
Teaching spaces:
1. 1.5 hours per class
2. 180 classes in the space over the semester
Dining Halls:
In-person dining
1. 1 hour per meal
2. 3 meals per day
3. Eating in dining hall 7 days per week
4. 12 weeks per semester
Meal pick-ups:
1. 10 minutes per meal pick-up

Residential spaces:
Dorm rooms:

Evaluation of Impact of Face Masks
The risk assessment model estimates the infection probability. By setting the maximum risk
of infection as 1%, this model can be used to evaluate the ability of a face mask to sufficiently

mitigate infection risk. Filtration efficiencies for these masks were assigned based on the usual
range of values observed (Hao et al., 2020; Konda et al., 2020).
1. Procedural mask with filtration efficiency of 70%
2. Cotton mask with filtration efficiency of 45%
3. Cotton mask with filtration efficiency of 15%
4. N95 respirator with filtration efficiency of 95%
5. KN95 mask with filtration efficiency of 90%

Web Application Development
A web application implementing the mathematical model was deployed using Amazon Web
Services. The web application was developed using HTML, Javascript, and Python. This website
was designed to be user-friendly and efficient in obtaining infection probabilities for different
university spaces (Figure 2). It also provides users with CDC information and university policies
aimed at mitigating viral transmission on campus (Figure 2). Like the algorithm described,
conservative assumptions were used to output infection probabilities. The COVID-19 dashboard
for each university, in which student, faculty, and staff infections are tracked, was either
embedded or linked in the web application to allow users to input their universities’ most up-todate positivity rates.
To ensure the validity of the web application’s algorithm, cross-data comparison between the
results of the web application algorithm and manual calculations through the approaches detailed
previously were continuously performed throughout the development of the web application.

RESULTS
Model Development
The model to calculate infection probability is based on a previously developed, exponential
dose-response model of infection probability for SARS coronavirus, which has recently been
used to calculate infection probability with SARS-CoV-2 (Watanabe et al., 2010; Augenbraun et
al., 2020). This model defines infection probability as:
𝑑
𝑝 (𝑑) = 1 − 𝑒𝑥𝑝(− )
𝑘

(17)

where d is the viral dose and k is the infection constant for the respective virus (Watanabe et al.,
2010; Augenbraun et al., 2020)
To calculate viral dose, the local density of viral copies in air inhaled by an individual must
be determined (Augenbraun et al., 2020). On average, an individual infected with SARS-CoV-2
exhales 35-70 viral particles/minute (Augenbraun et al., 2020). By the time the viral particles
spread and reach a healthy individual, there is a specific local density n of viral particles
(particles/L) in the inhaled air. The inhaled viral dose is then calculated as:
d = nV

(18)

where the inhaled viral dose (d) is a product of the local viral density (n) in inhaled air and the
volume of air inhaled (V).
Factors that dilute viral density are face mask usage, HVAC filtration systems, and elapsed
time, making it essential to quantify their effect on the local density n of viral particles in inhaled
air. In the case of face masks, the dilution factor DMask is the degree of viral density dilution that
results from passage through the mask. Therefore, DMask is simply the fraction of viral particles
that pass through the mask and is defined as:

DMask = 1- F

(19)

where the dilution factor (DMask ) is a function of the mask filtration efficiency (F) for particles ≥
0.3 microns in size.
For HVAC filtration systems, when low flow rates result in a mixing of contaminated and
fresh air, the dilution factor DHVAC follows the relationship:
DHVAC (t) = e-rt

(20)

where the airborne viral particle dilution factor (DHVAC) is dependent on the number of air
exchanges per hour (r) and the duration of time in hours (t). (Augenbraun et al., 2020).
The general approach to calculating infection probability in a desired setting was based on the
assumption that the number of infected individuals sharing a particular space is representative of
the university’s infection positivity rate. The number of viral particles emitted was calculated
using the assumed number of infected individuals and a viral particle exhalation rate of 70
particles/minute. The filtration efficiency of the face mask worn, if any, was used to calculate
DMask, and the room’s air exchange rate was used to calculate DHVAC, which in turn were used,
along with the room volume, to calculate the local density of viral particles, n, in inhaled air.
Using the average breathing rate of 450 L/hr, the viral dose inhaled in a given amount of time
was calculated. This viral dose and an infection constant of k = 100 (i.e. each inhaled viral
particle contributes 1% infection probability) were used to calculate infection probability.

Analysis Using Risk Assessment Model for Generalized University Spaces
The model was first applied to generalized university spaces. Values for different space
parameters (positivity rate, room volume, air exchange rate, mask filtration efficiency, normal
room capacity, time spent in the space per visit, and total number of visits to the space over a
semester) were selected such that they fall within the range of reasonable values for university

spaces while still providing wide variation. Thus, five generic university spaces were created (S1
Table), to which the model was applied. In general, mask filtration efficiency, air exchange rate,
room capacity, and campus COVID-19 positivity rate were dominant parameters influencing
infection probability (Figure 3).
In spaces that are used sequentially by different groups of students (e.g., consecutive classes
in teaching spaces, meal pick-ups in dining halls, bathroom uses) the infection probability during
the next use of the space over a semester was determined, through application of the model, to
depend on many of the same parameters. However, wait time between uses also plays an
important role (Figure 4).

Analysis Using Risk Assessment Model for Specific University Spaces
The model was applied to specific university spaces and scenarios, using values specific to
particular spaces at Harvard and Stanford Universities. Both Low Infection Rate (0.1%) (LIR)
and High Infection Rate (1%) (HIR) scenarios were used for all calculations.

Required Filtration Efficiency Results
For each university campus, specific parameter value ranges are required to ensure safety (p <
1%) and feasibility of reopening spaces (e.g., cannot have exorbitant wait times > 5 minutes
between meal pick-up batches to ensure all students receive meals in a timely fashion). To
determine the required mask filtration efficiencies, multiple specific spaces of each type (e.g.
teaching spaces) in each university were analyzed to determine the minimum filtration efficiency
required to ensure safety and feasibility across all spaces of a single type for a given university.
For example, the required filtration efficiency for lecture halls at Harvard was determined by
testing multiple Harvard lecture halls and finding the single filtration efficiency required to meet

the p < 1% criteria for all. Through this analysis, mask filtration efficiencies required to ensure
safety and feasibility for each space type in each university were determined (Table 1).
Understandably, required filtration efficiencies were greater in the HIR case than the LIR case
(Table 1), as there is greater exposure to infected individuals in the HIR case. Differences
between required filtration efficiencies across universities and space types occurred due to
variations in the space parameters of different universities and space types. For example,
required filtration efficiencies for meal pick-ups from dining halls were much lower for the
Stanford University campus compared to the Harvard University Cambridge campus (Table 1)
due to factors such as greater room volumes in Stanford dining halls. Similarly, required
filtration efficiencies were generally lower in small classrooms than large lecture halls (Table 1)
due to factors such as lower seating capacities and greater air exchange rates.
It is important to note that these were the required filtration efficiencies to ensure that the
infection risk at the time of maximum exposure is <1% over the relevant time period. For
example, for teaching spaces and meal pick-ups, Table 1 presents the necessary filtration
efficiencies for ensuring that an individual present in the space at the same time as an infected
individual will have <1% infection probability over a semester. For bathrooms, since individuals
from different rooms were assumed to not be permitted to be present at the same time, maximum
exposure occurs during the subsequent visit (after the constant wait times previously defined)
following a bathroom visit by individuals from an infected room. Therefore, filtration
efficiencies in Table 1 for bathrooms are those that are necessary during subsequent visits.

Efficacy of Existing Face Masks
Comparison of the performance of existing masks relative to these required filtration
efficiencies allowed for the determination of their ability to successfully maintain an infection

probability <1% over the relevant time period in these specific university spaces and
aforementioned scenarios. The N95 respirator and KN95 mask have high filtration efficiencies
and therefore were found to be acceptable across all the spaces and university campuses (Table
2). Typical procedural masks have sufficient filtration properties to maintain p < 1% across all
the spaces when infection rates are low but not when they are high (Table 2). The cotton mask
with 15% filtration efficiency was found to provide insufficient protection in almost all spaces
and university campuses (Table 2).

Other Output Parameters
Assuming the calculated values for required mask filtration efficiencies are enforced, specific
wait times and infection probabilities were calculated for each university space (Tables 3-5).
Infection probabilities were, as expected, <1% in all spaces where masks with the required
filtration efficiency listed in Table 1 for the given space type are worn (Tables 3-5). However,
due to variations between specific spaces, the magnitude of the infection probability differs
between spaces (Tables 3-5). Therefore, while Table 1 provides the filtration efficiencies
required to ensure p < 1% over the relevant time period across spaces of a given type in each
university, Tables 3-5 provide the specific output parameter values for each individual space.
In the case of teaching spaces, new room capacities were derived from original capacities to
follow 6 feet social distancing in the three university campuses. Using these capacities and the
filtration efficiencies for each case listed in Table 1, infection probabilities over a semester in
these teaching spaces (Table 3) were calculated. It is important to note that these probabilities
were obtained for the case in which infected individuals are present in the teaching space at the
same time as healthy individuals. These probabilities are independent of wait times between

classes (Table 3), which are necessary to maintain acceptably low infection probabilities for
individuals attending subsequent classes in the teaching spaces.
For dining halls, room capacities following 6 feet social distancing were again determined
from original capacities for specific dining halls in Harvard and Stanford universities. Using
these capacities and the filtration efficiencies for each case listed in Table 1, infection
probabilities over a semester in these dining halls (Table 4) were calculated both for in-person
dining and meal pick-up scenarios previously described. Notably, infection probabilities for inperson dining were frequently >1% (Table 4) because mask usage cannot be enforced during inperson dining. In contrast, infection probabilities for meal pick-ups were significantly <1%
(Table 4), largely due to mask use and the short duration spent in the dining hall during the pickup. It is also important to note that these probabilities are once again for the case in which
infected individuals are present in the dining hall at the same time as healthy individuals. These
probabilities are independent of wait times between meal batches (Table 4), which are necessary
to maintain acceptably low infection probabilities for individuals picking up meals in subsequent
batches.
For residential spaces, using the required filtration efficiency listed in Table 1 and variables
specified by the scenarios previously described, infection probabilities over a 2-week infection
period were calculated for typical dorm rooms and bathrooms of two different sizes and levels of
ventilation (Table 5). For bathrooms, individuals from different rooms were assumed to never be
present at the same time. Unlike teaching spaces and dining halls, infection probabilities in
bathrooms were dependent on the wait time between uses. For this reason, infection probabilities
for bathrooms listed in Table 5 were calculated for the constant wait times previously defined
(40 minutes between bathroom uses and 80 minutes between shower uses).

Web Application Based on Risk Assessment Model
The web application allows users to calculate infection probabilities in teaching spaces in a
way that is tailored to their settings. The user is required to input the space dimensions, the
length of time inside the space per class, and the number of times they will attend this class over
the semester (Figure 5). A user can also input the filtration efficiency of their mask and the air
exchange rate (Figure 5). However, if the user does not know or fails to input either, a base-case
scenario is calculated. This calculation assumes a mask filtration efficiency of 70%, the filtration
efficiency of a surgical mask (Hao et al., 2020), and an air exchange rate of 1.2 cycles per hour.
While the model was initially used to identify conditions necessary to maintain <1% infection
risk, the web application allows more creativity by allowing conditions to be input by the user
and producing an infection probability based on the inputs (Figure 5).

DISCUSSION
A model for quantifying SARS-CoV-2 infection risk in university spaces has been created. Its
application to teaching, dining, and residential spaces can provide critical information regarding
safety in university facilities and guide university mandates to increase safety. The web
application provides the added functionality for any user to determine infection risk in a setting.
This model and tool were formulated using several assumptions. An infection probability
<1% over a semester was assumed to be a reasonable threshold for acceptable risk, similar to
Augenbraun et al. (2020). At this threshold, the risk of death due to COVID-19 is smaller than
the all-cause mortality rate for the university-age demographic (Augenbraun et al., 2020). It was
presumed that the number of infected students is proportional to the positivity rate. This yields
fractional numbers of infected individuals, which is mathematically equivalent to whole numbers

of infected individuals present for a fraction of the duration. The model included the assumption
of perfect mixing of particles in a space, which is more appropriate in small spaces. It is likely
not feasible to calculate a person-by-person risk assessment based on an individual’s location
relative to an infected person. The approach to the HVAC dilution factor (DHVAC) assumes low
air flow rates that cause mixing of fresh and contaminated air, which is especially likely in larger
spaces with inefficient air exchange. The model conservatively assumes k = 100 as the infection
constant (Augenbraun et al., 2020). A higher value may be appropriate for more infectious
SARS-CoV-2 strains (Johns Hopkins Medicine, 2021).
It was determined that in-person classes can be safely held in large lecture halls, over the
levels of infection rate included in this analysis. However, doing so is not feasible in small
classrooms. Although infection probabilities in small classrooms are <1%, the limiting factor is
the social distancing requirement. In large lecture halls, this limits student numbers but permits
enough students to maintain effective learning environments. Most small classrooms, however,
would have insufficient seating capacities following social distancing. This analysis is only valid
if universities enforce regulations regarding face mask filtration efficiency, seating capacities, air
exchange rates, social distancing, lengths of classes, wait times between classes held in each
space, and total number of classes attended in each space over the semester. As evidenced by
calculations for Harvard-Cambridge, Harvard-Allston, and Stanford lecture halls, infection risks
and required wait times vary by space and should be calculated on a case-by-case basis. These
guidelines must also be adapted as infection positivity rates evolve.
In-person dining is largely unsafe, but meal pick-ups can be safely accommodated. The high
risk for in-person dining is largely attributable to face mask removal while eating and the
significant amount of time involved in this activity. The risk is likely further increased compared

to the calculations performed here because the act of eating may increase emissions compared to
normal breathing (Papineni & Rosenthal, 1997). Dining halls typically have insufficient air
exchange to mitigate this risk. In contrast, meal pick-ups can occur safely if universities enforce
regulations regarding face mask filtration efficiency, social distancing, number of students in
each meal pick-up batch, length of each meal pick-up window, and wait times between meal
pick-up windows. Dining practices observed at universities offering meal-picks are consistent
with these findings.
Living in a dorm room with a roommate is highly unsafe if one roommate is infected.
Because roommates are in close proximity, and mask wearing is unlikely in personal living
spaces and impractical while sleeping, the infection probability is extremely high if one
roommate is infected. These findings are consistent with the Harvard College Spring 2021 Plan,
which established a maximum of one student per bedroom (Harvard Faculty of Arts and
Sciences, 2020).
Bathrooms in university dormitories can be safely shared if universities enforce the conditions
used in the modeling of this study. The conclusion of a 40-minute waiting time to minimize
infection between uses is consistent, in order of magnitude, with previous analyses, which
suggested a 20-minute waiting time (Augenbraun et. al, 2020). The discrepancy is likely related
to differing assumptions regarding air exchange rates, mask efficacies, and presence of showers
in bathrooms.
The web application developed here allows users to determine infection risk upon inputting
several parameters and may provide significant advantage over current risk-assessment methods.
Tools such as the Mathematica 19 and Me COVID-19 Risk Calculator (Mathematica, 2020),
only provide risk scores based on demographic factors and basic behavioral practices. Other

approaches (Augenbraun et al., 2020; Khan et al., 2020) use a variety of infection models and
focus on various space types. However, the tool described here is targeted for universities and
provides a measure of risk for any teaching space.

CONCLUSION
With this research, the goal was to quantify SARS-CoV-2 infection risk in various university
settings. To that end, a quantitative framework with clear and reasonable assumptions has been
created. By creating a web-based tool for users to quantitatively understand the risk they face by
inputting the specifications of the space, the model is more accessible to the general public. This
tool will continue to be relevant after widespread vaccination because an appreciable risk still
exists; vaccines are not 100% effective and some individuals may abstain from vaccination.
Given the infection constant and surveillance testing information, this model can be easily
adapted to other viruses since the infection constant is the only SARS-CoV-2-specific parameter.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The model and web application that have been developed can be utilized to assess the safety
of university spaces with regards to SARS-CoV-2 infection risk. Doing so will enable an
assessment of the risk of infection for students, faculty, and staff in these spaces and will inform
the development and reshaping of university regulations as the COVID-19 pandemic continues
to evolve. This model and tool can be used to determine the necessary conditions for safely
reopening campuses in order to prevent viral transmission across campuses and maintain safe
environments for students, faculty, and staff. Application of this model to specific university
campuses and spaces revealed that it is feasible to safely accommodate in-person classes in large

lecture halls, meal pick-ups from dining halls and sharing of bathrooms in residential dormitories
among small groups of students. However, these conclusions are only true if specific university
regulations are enforced. It is especially essential that regulations regarding face mask usage,
room capacities, times spent in spaces, wait times between uses of the same space, and air
exchange rates are enforced. While several other parameters may also influence the risk of
infection, these variables, in particular, must be controlled in order to sufficiently mitigate the
risk of transmission. Utilization of the model and web application that have been developed will
enable the identification of the exact combination of these parameters that impact the safety of
individuals present in each space. While the model and web application have been specifically
applied to university spaces, they can also be readily adapted and deployed for the purpose of
assessing the level of risk and methods of mitigating this risk in any indoor settings.

C. Mask-wearing cannot be required during in-person dining
D. Residential spaces such as dorm rooms and bathrooms are assumed to be, on average, similar across university
campuses and not university-specific
E. Required filtration efficiencies needed to ensure p < 1% during a subsequent bathroom use (after a 40-minute
wait time for bathroom and 80-minute wait time for shower) following a bathroom use by an infected individual
F. Mask-wearing cannot be required in dorm rooms

A. Magnitude of wait times is much smaller for meal pick-ups so they are provided in order of magnitude ranges,
which likely carry greater utility for guiding university policies
B. Wait times required to ensure safety in a meal pick-up batch subsequent to one in which an infected individual
was present
C. Probabilities of infection over a semester for individuals in the same meal pick-up batch as an infected individual
