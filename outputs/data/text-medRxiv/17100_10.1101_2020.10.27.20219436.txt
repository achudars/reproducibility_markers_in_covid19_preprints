Key Points:
Question: What was the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on childhood asthma outcomes?
Findings: During the first wave of the pandemic, children with asthma have experienced improved

outcomes, as evidenced by fewer asthma attachks, hospitalizations, improved scores in validated
asthma control measures and improved pulmonary function.
Meaning:

This is the first study to show a positive impact of COVID-19 pandemic on childhood

asthma activity. This is probably the result of reduced exposure to asthma triggers and increased
treatment adherence. The decreased frequency of acute episodes does not support the
hypothesis that childhood asthma may be a risk factor for COVID-19.

ABSTRACT
Importance:

Importance: The interplay between COVID-19 pandemic and asthma in children is

still unclear.
Objective: We evaluated the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on childhood asthma outcomes.
Design: The PeARL multinational cohort included children with asthma and non-asthmatic controls

recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic and compared current disease activity with data
available from the previous year.
Setting: Pediatric outpatient clinics.
Participants: The study included 1,054 children with asthma and 505 non-asthmatic controls, aged

between 4-18 years, from 25 pediatric departments, from 15 countries globally.
Exposures:

COVID-19 pandemic first wave, starting from the date of the first fatality in the

respective country.
Main outcomes and measures:

We assessed the pandemic’s impact on the frequency of

respiratory infections, emergency presentations and hospital admissions in asthmatic versus nonasthmatic participants, controlling for confounding factors including the pandemic’s duration and
the frequency of such acute events during 2019. Using paired analyses, we evaluated the impact
of the pandemic on the annualized frequency of asthma attacks and the previously mentioned
acute events, asthma control, and pulmonary function in children with asthma, compared to their
baseline disease activity, during the preceding year.
Results:

During the pandemic, children with asthma experienced fewer upper respiratory tract

infections, episodes of pyrexia, emergency visits, hospital admissions, asthma attacks and
hospitalizations due to asthma, in comparison to the preceding year. Sixty-six percent of asthmatic

children had improved asthma control while in 33% the improvement exceeded the minimally
clinically important difference. Pre-bronchodilatation FEV1 and peak expiratory flow rate were also
improved during the pandemic.
When compared to non-asthmatic controls, children with asthma were not found to be at
increased risk of LRTIs, episodes of pyrexia, emergency visits or hospitalizations during the
pandemic. However, an increased risk of URTIs emerged.
Conclusions and relevance: Childhood asthma outcomes, including control, were improved during

the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, probably because of reduced exposure to asthma
triggers and increased treatment adherence. The decreased frequency of acute episodes does not
support the notion that childhood asthma may be a risk factor for COVID-19. Furthermore, the
potential for improving childhood asthma outcomes through environmental control becomes
apparent.

INTRODUCTION

A series of studies have demonstrated that the morbidity from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) is lower in children compared to adults1,2,3. Risk factors for severe disease include older age,
male sex, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, coronary artery disease, obesity and ethnicity
(black, Asian and mixed)4,5,6. Chronic respiratory diseases are among these high-risk pre-existing
conditions and asthma represents the majority of such patients4,5,7. Initial clinical reports did not
identify asthma to be over-represented among COVID-19 patients8, but severe, uncontrolled
asthma is included in most guidance documents among conditions which may increase the risk for
severe COVID-199. Analysis in more than 17 million adults and ~11,000 COVID-19 related deaths
identified severe asthma (defined as asthma with recent oral corticosteroid use) as a significant
associate of COVID-19 death6. It is however unclear what is the impact of asthma on the risk of
SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 in children, and what is the impact of COVID-19
pandemic on asthma-related outcomes in children. Survey data among pediatric asthma
specialists suggest that there is no apparent increase in asthma-related morbidity in children with
asthma10; it is even possible that due to increased adherence and reduced exposures due to
confinement, such children may have improved outcomes10. Furthermore, it is also possible that
allergic sensitization can have some protective effect against COVID-1911. However, this needs to
be further explored12,13.
Recent systematic reviews have concluded that there are limited data on pediatric asthma as a risk
factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID severity and called for data2,14,15. For the above reasons,
Pediatric Asthma in Real Life (PeARL), a think tank initiated by the Respiratory Effectiveness Group
(REG), comprising of pediatric asthma experts globally16, opted to evaluate the interplay between
childhood asthma and COVID-19 infection in a multi-national cohort of children with asthma and

non-asthmatic controls. We aimed at assessing asthma activity (asthma control, respiratory
infections, asthma attacks, lung function) during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic and
exploring whether children with asthma had excess morbidity during this period, in comparison to
prerecorded historical data.
The primary study objective was to assess differences in the impact of the pandemic on the
frequency of upper (URTIs), lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), episodes of fever,
emergency visits and hospital admissions between asthmatic and non-asthmatic children.
Secondary objectives to evaluate were: (i) the impact of the pandemic on the frequency of asthma
attacks, as well as the previously mentioned events among asthmatic children, compared to the
baseline frequency of these events, during the preceding year (2019); (ii) the impact of the
pandemic on disease control, evaluated using validated asthma clinical questionnaires, among
children with asthma, compared to the baseline asthma control, during the preceding year (2019).

METHODS
Study design, setting and participants

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on disease activity in children with asthma was evaluated in
data collected as part of a multinational audit. Ethics review was not required for this audit, in
most participating countries. When required, an ethics approval was acquired. The cross-sectional
case-control study was designed and managed by the PeARL Steering Committee, was conducted
in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice Guidelines and reported following the Strengthening
the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology (STROBE) statement17. Participating centers
were identified among members and collaborators of the PeARL think-tank.
Eligibility criteria, sources and methods of selection of participants

Eligible subjects were children aged between 4 and 18 years, diagnosed with asthma and
monitored in one of the participating asthma clinics. Non-asthmatic controls included children of
the same age range, monitored at the same healthcare setting for a non-respiratory condition,
who did not clinically suffer from asthma. Children with other chronic respiratory conditions,
diabetes, hypertension, immunodeficiency, or any other chronic disease deemed by the
responsible clinician that could impact the main outcomes of this study, were excluded. Each
participating center was asked to contribute data from at least 45 participants, including twice as
many children with asthma, compared to controls.
Definition of variables

For the purposes of this study, the onset of the pandemic in each participating center was defined
as the date of the first fatality due to COVID-19 in the respective country. For each participant, the
duration of the pandemic period was defined as the period between the onset of the pandemic
and the captured clinical visit. Historical data (before the pandemic) were captured during 2019
and the duration of observation before the onset of the pandemic was one year, for all
participants.
We collected basic demographic data for all participants and data on the main outcomes of
interest. The frequency of acute events (URTIs, LRTIs, asthma attacks, episodes of fever,
emergency visits, for any reason, and hospital admissions, for any reason) during and before the
pandemic were reported as recalled by the participants or their parents. Asthma attacks were
defined as the need for systemic glucocorticoids administration for at least 48 hours or an
emergency visit or a hospitalization for asthma. Need for additional treatment was defined as any
treatment escalation, including increased use of short-acting bronchodilators, increased dose of
inhaled corticosteroids or the administration of systemic corticosteroid courses. Asthma activity

during and before the pandemic was measured using validated disease control questionnaires
(asthma control test: ACT18, childhood asthma control test: C-ACT19, asthma control questionnaire:
ACQ20, or composite asthma severity index: CASI21). For each participant with asthma, at least one
questionnaire was administered at least 2 months after the onset of the pandemic in their country
and at least once during 2019 (the same questionnaire in both occasions). Physiological
measurements, including forced expiratory value in 1 second (FEV1), before or after
bronchodilation and the peak expiratory flow rate (PFR), during and before the pandemic, were
also captured when available.
Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using R statistical software (version 3.4.3 or newer; R
Foundation for Statistical Computing; Vienna; Austria). We did not perform power calculations, as
this was an exploratory analysis. Shapiro-Wilk test was used to evaluate normality of the
distribution of continuous data. Student’s t-test and Mann-Whitney test were used for comparing
means of normally or non-normally distributed variables, respectively. Chi-squared test was used
for comparing dichotomous data. The level of significance was set at 0.05 for all analyses.
We used a generalized linear model for evaluating the impact of the pandemic on the frequency of
acute events in asthmatic versus non-asthmatic participants. We assumed a negative binomial
distribution, with the number of events during the pandemic as the response variable and the
natural logarithm of the duration of the pandemic for each participant as an offset variable. At
first, based on established theory, we considered as potential covariates the age, gender, and the
number of acute events each participant experienced during 2019. In an additional model we also
accounted for the race (if it was available, according to the participating countries’ ethics
regulations), passive smoking history (cigarettes smoked per day by the parents), concomitant

allergic rhinitis, IgE sensitization, food allergy and history of flu vaccination during the preceding
year.
For evaluating the impact of the pandemic on the frequency of each acute event in asthmatic and
non-asthmatic children, we extrapolated an annualized event count based on the number of
observed events during the pandemic (365 * events / pandemic duration [in days]). We then
compared this with the actual number of acute events observed during 2019 using the Wilcoxon
Signed-Rank test. In addition, we present the number of participants who had at least one event
during the pandemic and during the preceding year.
Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test was also used to assess the impact of the pandemic on asthma control.
As previously described, different standardized measures of asthma control were used in each
center, depending on the measures that were evaluated during 2019, to facilitate comparisons.
Firstly, we compared asthma control during versus before the pandemic in subgroups of
participants, depending on the available asthma control tools. Next, we used Z-scores to estimate
standardized differences by dividing the differences in the values during versus before the
pandemic, with the standard deviation of all differences, for every test. In a sensitivity analysis, we
only included subjects with a previous asthma control assessment between March-June 2019,
during the same period as the pandemic, to account for seasonal variation.
Paired t-test was used to compare pulmonary function measurements during versus before the
pandemic. As previously, we conducted a sensitivity analysis only including subjects with a
previous pulmonary function test, between March-June, 2019.
Finally, in a subgroup analysis we repeated all previously described analyses only including data
from participating centers that are in countries that were more severely hit by the pandemic (>200
deaths per million of inhabitants by 13/07/2020).

RESULTS
Participants and descriptive data

The study included 1,054 children with asthma and 505 control subjects, from 25 pediatric
departments from 15 countries globally (supplementary table 1). The baseline characteristics of
the participants were generally balanced between the groups with a few, anticipated exceptions
(Table 1-2). A higher proportion of males (62.8% versus 51.9%) was observed in the asthma group
compared to the controls, which is consistent with epidemiological characteristics of the disease in
this age group. Allergic diseases such as allergic rhinitis (79.4% vs 39.4%) and food allergy (22.8%
vs 15.6%) were also more prevalent in the asthma group. A higher proportion of children with
asthma had a confirmed IgE sensitization and were vaccinated for the flu in the preceding year.
Finally, children with asthma suffered a higher number of episodes of URTIs, LRTIs, emergency
visits or hospital admissions during 2019, compared to the control group (Table 3).
Outcome data

Acute events frequency among asthmatic versus non-asthmatic controls during the pandemic

Using generalized linear models, we evaluated between group differences in the frequency of
acute events during COVID-19 pandemic (table 3). Children with asthma were not found to be at
increased risk of LRTIs, episodes of pyrexia, emergency visits or hospitalizations during the
pandemic. However, the second model, that accounted for more variables (race, comorbidities, flu
vaccination history and passive smoking history), revealed an increased risk of URTI among
children with asthma, compared to the control group, during the pandemic (p=0.005).
The strongest predictor for each type of acute events was the number of such events experienced
by the participants during the preceding year (p<0.001 for all analyses). In addition, older age was

associated with a decreased risk of pyrexia (p=0.025), while the race of the participants was also
associated with the frequency of these events.
Impact of the pandemic on the frequency of the acute events, compared to the preceding year

Next, using paired statistics, we compared the frequency of each acute event during the
pandemic, compared to the preceding year (table 3). Children with asthma experienced fewer
URTIs, episodes of pyrexia, emergency visits, hospital admissions, asthma attacks and
hospitalizations due to asthma during the pandemic, compared to the preceding year. No
differences were observed in the frequency of LRTIs during versus before the pandemic.
On the other hand, the pandemic did not appear to impact the frequency of emergency visits or
hospital admissions of non-asthmatic controls. In this group, we observed a decreased frequency
of URTIs and episodes of pyrexia, but also a significantly increased risk of LRTIs during the
pandemic.
Asthma control during the pandemic

We then compared asthma control during versus before the pandemic (table 4). A validated
asthma control tool was used, following the local practice in every participating center, to ensure
the availability of a measurement of the same tool during the pandemic and one during 2019. At
least two asthma control measures (during and before the pandemic) were available for 90.9% of
participants in the asthma group. ACT was used in 756 (78.9%) of these children, while cACT, ACQ,
or CASI was used in the remaining cases.
Improved or unchanged asthma control during pandemic was reported by 90.2% of the
participants, while 65.9% experienced an improvement. Importantly, one in three children with
asthma (33.2%) reported an improvement in control that exceeded the minimal clinically
important difference of the test used.

Given the seasonal differences in asthma control, we conducted a sensitivity analysis where we
only included historical asthma control measurements conducted during the same months with
the first months of the pandemic (March-June 2019), with consistent findings (table 4).
Analyses of subgroups

Pulmonary function during the pandemic

Pulmonary function during the pandemic compared to 2019 was evaluated in a subgroup of
asthma children with available data (table 5). Adequate measurements of pre-bronchodilatation
FEV1, post-bronchodilatation FEV1 and PFR were available in 155, 90 and 106 children,
respectively. Paired analyses suggested pre-bronchodilatation FEV1 and PFR were significantly
improved during the pandemic, while there was also a non-significant trend for improved postbronchodilatation FEV1.
In a sensitivity analysis only including historical pulmonary function evaluated during the same
months with the pandemic (March-June 2019), pre-bronchodilatation FEV1 was significantly
improved during the pandemic, while the remaining measures showed non-significant, numerical
improvements.
Subgroup analysis only including countries that were more severely hit by the pandemic

In this subgroup analysis, all previously described analyses were repeated, including data from
participating centers from countries that were more severely hit by the pandemic (>200 deaths
per million of inhabitants by 13/07/2020). More specifically, we included data from France, Italy,
Mexico, Spain, UK, and the USA. This subgroup analyses, which involved 597 children with asthma
and 298 non-asthmatic controls, yielded consistent results with the main analyses (supplementary
tables 2-5).

DISCUSSION
Key results

In the multinational PeARL childhood asthma cohort, we evaluated the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on asthma activity. During the pandemic, children with asthma experienced improved
disease control (two thirds of the patients), as evidenced by improved scores in validated asthma
control measures (>MCID in one third), fewer asthma attacks, fewer hospitalizations, and
improved pulmonary function. The multifaceted etiology of this observation may include the
avoidance of major asthma triggers including outdoor allergens, viral infections, physical exercise
and air pollution, due to social distancing, home sheltering and reduced school days10,12,22,23,24,25.
Increased treatment adherence during the pandemic26, could have also contributed and is
consistent with the high adherence levels observed during the pandemic in our cohort. However,
along with these ‘protective’ effects of the pandemic, children were also more exposed to indoor
allergens and pollutants and possibly adverse psychological factors and this could have
precipitated worse asthma control, nevertheless in a minority of children (1/10 children in our
cohort).
Interpretation

The interplay between asthma and COVID-19 infection is being extensively investigated. Several
studies explored the prevalence of asthma among children and adults with confirmed COVID-19
infection and failed to find an increased risk of contracting the infection or of adverse outcomes
among asthmatic patients27,28. A recent review with meta-analysis done in adults with COVID-19
(744 asthmatic and 8151 non-asthmatic) showed that the presence of asthma had no significant
effect on mortality (OR=0.96 [0.70-1.30], I2=0%, p=0.79), duration of hospitalization, or the risk of

ICU admission29. However, COVID-19 infection was significantly underdiagnosed during the initial
months of the pandemic due to limited availability of diagnostic tests, that led most countries to
recommend home isolation without testing in case of non-severe symptoms consistent with
COVID-19. The PeARL asthma cohort is the first large, multinational cohort to demonstrate that
children with asthma do not experience more frequent events of disease deterioration that could
have potentially resulted from increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, not even in countries with
an increased COVID-19 burden. In contrast, most outcomes were improved. In addition to
suggesting that pediatric asthma is not a risk factor for COVID-19, these findings strongly reinforce
the need and potential of compliance to treatment30,31, as well as the prospect of improved
outcomes with environmental control in asthma, an area of some discrepancy32.
The role of different viruses as asthma attack triggers has been investigated extensively. While
rhinoviruses represent the main viral trigger of attacks, coronaviruses also trigger asthma attacks,
albeit less frequently33. However, and in line with our findings, the outbreak of SARS in Singapore
and Hong Kong were not associated with increased asthma attacks in children34,35. On the
contrary, and in line with our results, the incidence of acute respiratory tract infections and acute
asthma attacks declined dramatically, likely due to the closure of schools for a period of time,
stepped-up public hygiene measures and the use of facemasks36,37.
On the other hand, improved outcomes among asthmatic children during SARS/COVID-19
epidemics may also support the hypothesis of a protective effect of asthma against COVID-19. This
hypothesis is based on several observations, including changed in the immune

response or

decreased risk secondary to chronic medications such as inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). In-vitro
models have shown that ICS may suppress both coronavirus replication and cytokine
production38,39. Analysis of induced sputum samples in a well-characterized cohort of adults with
severe asthma found reduced ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) and TMPRSS2

(transmembrane protease serine 2) gene expression among patients taking ICS, and especially
among those on higher doses40; and we know ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mediate SARS-CoV-2 cell
infection. Similarly, a recent study done in children and adults showed that patients with asthma and
respiratory allergies had reduced ACE2 gene expression in airway cells, suggesting a potential
mechanism of reduced COVID-19 risk11.

Limitations and strengths

Evaluation of the frequency of acute events during the pandemic is challenging, but we believe our
methodology was rigorous. Firstly, the accuracy of parent-reported frequency of acute events has
been previously validated41. We assumed a potential under-reporting of acute events during 2019,
due to recall bias, however we do not anticipate between group differences in this bias. In
addition, potential under-reporting of acute events prior to the pandemic would have led to an
overestimation of the relative risk during the pandemic. Since we did not find an increased risk, we
suggest the impact of recall bias was minimal.
For estimating the duration of the pandemic, we considered the onset of the pandemic to coincide
with the first fatality in each respective country. This usually followed a few days to weeks after
the identification of the first case. We chose this time-point as an objective marker that could
better identify the onset of the impact of the pandemic in each community. Since we were
inquiring for acute episodes during the epidemic, we wanted to avoid a potential underestimation
of the frequency of the events that could have been caused by accounting for a wider time-period
of the epidemic.
Extrapolating an annualized asthma attack rate based on the events that were observed during
the pandemic is complicated by the seasonal variability of asthma attacks42,43. However, numerous

high-quality studies demonstrate a peak in childhood asthma attack during autumn and schools
reopening, which is counter-balanced by a low frequency during summer42,44. Interestingly, these
studies consistently show that the frequency of asthma attacks and asthma hospitalizations during
spring and early summer levels with the median frequency of asthma attacks throughout the
year42,43. The study period coincided with these months, suggesting that the frequency of acute
events equals to their frequency throughout the year. This observation enhances our confidence
on the accuracy of our annualize estimates and our findings, however the limited observation
period during the pandemic remains a limitation of this study.
The over-representation of atopic diseases in the control group shall be mentioned as a potential
limitation, but it has been accounted for in our analyses. Finally, different validated questionnaires
were used for assessing asthma control across the study centres, depending on the availability of
historic measurements, to allow for paired comparisons. While the results of different tools are
not directly comparable, our study revealed consistent results in the subgroups evaluated with
different tools. On the other hand, the extensive, multinational study population with a good
geographic balance across 4 continents, was a major strength of our study, increasing our
confidence in our findings.

Conclusion

Overall, this analysis of the PeARL childhood asthma cohort revealed improved health and asthma
activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, probably associated with decreased exposure to asthma
triggers and increased treatment adherence. It also demonstrated that during the pandemic,
children with predominantly mild to moderate atopic asthma did not suffer from an increase in

that childhood asthma is a risk factor for COVID-19.
