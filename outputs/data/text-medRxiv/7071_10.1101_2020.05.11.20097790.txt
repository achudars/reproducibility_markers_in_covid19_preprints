Abstract:
Objectives:

To describe the presenting features and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in a UK

hospital, with a focus on those patients over 80 years and patients with hospital onset

infection.

Design:

Retrospective cohort study with data extracted from the electronic records of patients with

PCR-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to our institution.

Setting:

Suburban general hospital serving London’s most populous borough.

Participants:

The first 450 inpatients admitted to our hospital with swab-confirmed COVID-19 infection.

Primary outcome:

The primary outcome measure was death during the index hospital admission.

Results:

The median (IQR) age was 72 (56, 83), with 150 (33%) over 80 years old and 60% male.

Presenting clinical and biochemical features were consistent with those reported elsewhere.

The ethnic breakdown of patients admitted was similar to that of our underlying local

population with no excess of BAME deaths. Inpatient mortality was high at 38%.

Patients over 80 presented earlier in their disease course and were significantly less likely to

present with the typical features of cough, breathlessness and fever. Cardiac co-morbidity

and markers of cardiac dysfunction were more common, but not those of bacterial

infection. Mortality was significantly higher in this group (60% vs 28%, p < 0.001).

31 (7%) of patients were classified as having hospital-onset COVID-19 infection. The peak of

hospital-onset infections occurred at the same time as the overall peak of admitted

infections. Despite being older and more frail, the outcomes for this cohort were no worse.

Conclusions:

Inpatient mortality was high, especially among the over-80s, who were more likely to

present atypically. The ethnic composition of our caseload was similar to the underlying

population. While a significant number of patients presented with COVID-19 while already

in hospital, their outcomes were no worse.

No funding was received for this study.

Strengths and Limitations of this Study
•

This study captures almost 80% of the admitted cases in our institution providing an

accurate representation of the experiences of a London hospital during the early

peak of the COVID-19 pandemic

•

The focus on the clinical and biochemical presentation and outcomes in patients

over 80 years of age has a high relevance to UK population which is older and frailer

than previously reported cohorts from elsewhere

•

The ethnicity of patients admitted to our hospital was similar to that of the

underlying local population

•

To our knowledge this study is the first to report the prevalence and outcomes of

hospital onset disease in the UK

•

This study is subject to the usual limitations of retrospective observational research,

including a proportion of missing data

Introduction

In December 2019, a febrile respiratory tract illness was reported in a cluster of patients in

Wuhan City (Hubei Province, China)

1

which we now recognise as a novel pathogenic strain

2

of coronavirus (SARS-coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2]) . The World Health Organisation (WHO)

subsequently declared coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) a public health emergency of

3

international concern . The infection has spread rapidly across the globe with nearly 3

million infections reported worldwide and nearly 200,000 deaths by 25

th

4

April .

The first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom was reported on

January 30

1

st

th

2020

5

with a subsequent rapid rise in the number of cases nationally. As of the

May 2020, 177,454 patients have tested positive and of those hospitalised in the UK who

6

tested positive for coronavirus, 23,229 have died . Infection numbers peaked in London two

to three weeks ahead of much of the rest of the UK.

The first COVID-19 cases in Barnet were reported on 5th March 2020. Barnet is the most

7

populous London Barough with a 2017 estimate of 406,600 inhabitants , and an elderly

population with a large number of care homes. Barnet Hospital, a busy suburban hospital

with 440 beds, confirmed its first PCR positive COVID-19 patient on 9th March 2020. Since

this initial case numbers have risen rapidly with the number of laboratory confirmed COVID-

19 inpatients admitted at 587 by 25

nd

inpatients was 48, on 2

274 on the 6

th

th

April. The peak daily number of positive tests on

April, and the number of confirmed COVID-19 inpatients peaked at

April.

8

Since the early case reports there have been numerous publications from China , the US

and elsewhere

10

9

describing presenting features and outcomes of the disease and, more

recently, from the UK

11

. However, few prior publications have examined the presentation of

Covid-19 in the over-80s and none have reported rates of hospital-onset infections. There

are also significant concerns in the UK about an apparent excess in COVID-19 related

mortality among ethnic minorities

12

.

We therefore report here a detailed profile of our first 450 laboratory-confirmed cases of

Covid-19. This comprises 77% of our cases as of 25

th

April. We examine the demographics,

Methods

Inpatients returning consecutive positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for SARS-

CoV2 on nasopharyngeal, nose or throat swabs during their hospital admission were

included for analysis. Data were collected retrospectively from the electronic patient record.

Patients with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 without PCR confirmation were not included.

Standardised data were collected on demographic features, ethnicity and the presence of

co-morbidities (prior diagnosis of cardiac disease [any], hypertension, diabetes, respiratory

disease [any], and immunosuppression). In those patients over 65 years of age the Clinical

Frailty Score (CFS)

13

was recorded where available. The presence of care needs prior to

admission, including carers at home and institutional care, was recorded.

Community-onset infection was defined as a positive test within 14 days of hospital

admission and hospital-onset infection if the patient had continuously been an inpatient for

14 days prior to the positive PCR test. Data were recorded at the point of presentation,

defined as the day of hospital admission (community-acquired infections) or documentation

of first symptom presentation in the medical notes (hospital-acquired infections). Clinical

data included symptom duration, and presenting symptoms and signs. Fever was defined as

a temperature > 37·8 Celsius.

Biochemical data included serum lymphocyte and neutrophil counts, C-reactive protein

(CRP), procalcitonin, cardiac troponin T, lactate, D-dimer, and glucose. The presence of

acute kidney injury was defined according to 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global

Outcomes guidance

14

. These tests were analysed by the hospital clinical laboratory; details

including normal limits and detection thresholds are included in the supplementary

appendix (Table S1). Values outside the detection thresholds were entered at the threshold.

The primary outcome assessed was death vs discharge from hospital at the end of the

hospital episode, where the patient had reached this point. Some ventilated patients were

transferred to other centres including NHS Nightingale and outcome data was unavailable at

the time of analysis. Early outcomes at Day 5 following presentation were also captured and

defined as discharged, non-intubated inpatient, intubated inpatient, or dead. Other

outcomes included length of stay and whether antibiotics were given.

Most variables were not expected to be normally distributed and non-parametric tests were

used throughout. Continuous between-group variables were analysed using the Wilcoxon

signed-rank test. The Bonferroni correction for multiple analyses was used for comparisons

within tables. Categorical variables were analysed using the chi-squared test. Analysis was

performed using R Statistics version 3·6·3. Missing data were not imputed; a summary table

can be found in the Supplementary Appendix (Table S5).

The data presented here were collected during routine clinical practice and formal Research

Ethics Committee review was not required. Approval for the study was granted by the chair

of the Trust Clinical Ethics Committee. The full data can be accessed at (to be confirmed).

Patient and public involvement

This was data routinely collected during clinical practice, and as such patient and public

involvement was not required.

Results
Demographics, Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes

476 positive swabs were identified; 26 were excluded as they were either too young (less

than 16 years old) or were not admitted as inpatients to the hospital. 450 inpatients who

underwent consecutive PCR tests confirming Covid-19 between 10

th

March 2020 and 8

th

April 2020 were analysed. This represents 77% of the PCR-positive caseload admitted to our

hospital to date.

Table 1 displays the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients, subdivided by

outcome. The median (IQR) age was 72 (56, 83) years and, in keeping with the elderly

population local to our hospital, 70% (313) were over the age of 60 and 33% (150) over 80.

There was a male predominance. Patients who died were significantly older (median (IQR)

age 80 (72, 88) vs 61 (49, 79), p < 0·001) and more likely to be receiving care in the

community (69 (40%) vs 45 (19%), p < 0·001), with a trend towards greater frailty by CFS. 31

of these patients (7%) developed clinical features of Covid-19 while already admitted to

hospital for ≥ 14 days.

59% overall were white, similar to the 59·7% of the local population who were classified as

7

ethnically white according to 2020 projections from 2011 census data . There was a trend

towards a difference in ethnicity, with a higher proportion of white ethnicity among those

who died (

χ2 p = 0.07), but this reflects documented age-related differences in our local

population with a higher proportion of our older residents being white

15

.

Hypertension was present in 43% (195) of patients admitted, with cardiac disease in 31%

(141), diabetes in 30% (134), respiratory conditions in only 19% (85) and

χ2 p =

immunosuppression in 9% (42). Pre-existing cardiac disease (78 (45%) vs 55 (23%, (

χ2 p = 0.003), but not diabetes, respiratory

0.005) and hypertension (87 (37%) vs 90 (52%, (

conditions or immunosuppression were more prevalent in those patients who died than

those who were discharged. Further detail may be found in the Supplementary Appendix

(Tables

S2, S3 and S4).

Cough and breathlessness were reported at presentation in 70% (317) and 63% (282)

respectively. Diarrhoea was reported by 16% (70) patients. The median duration of

symptoms was 5 (2, 8) days. At presentation, those who died had a higher respiratory rate

(26 (22, 33) vs 23 (19, 28), p < 0·001) and lower oxygen saturations (92 (88, 95) vs 95 (92,

96), p < 0·001) than those discharged. Presenting temperature, heart rate and the presence

of hypotension were no different between these groups although there was a trend towards

lower median temperature in those who died. The majority (74%) of patients received

antibiotic therapy for a median (IQR) duration of 5 (3, 7) days.

At Day 5 following admission 18% (79) of patients had been discharged, 54% (243) were not

intubated but remained in hospital, 12% (56) were intubated and receiving mechanical

ventilation and 16% (70) had died. Of those intubated at Day 5, 46% (26) had died, 18% (10)

gone home, 13% (7) remained in hospital and 23% (13) had unknown outcomes, usually

following transfer to another centre (Figure 1). The median length of stay was 5 (2, 8) days.

At the time of data analysis 38% (173) patients had died, 53% (237) had been discharged,

3% (12) remained in hospital and 6% (28) had unknown outcomes.

Biochemical disease characteristics by outcome

Table 2 summarises the biochemical presenting features overall and by outcome of hospital

stay.

Inflammatory markers that differed significantly between those that died and those that

were discharged were neutrophil count (6·6 (4·178, 9·750) vs 5·32 (3·48, 7·82), p = 0·001),

CRP (131 (74, 199) vs 68 (31, 140), p < 0·001) and procalcitonin (0·37 (0·17, 1·35) vs 0·20

(0·11, 0·44), p <0·001. Cardiac troponin (1422 (506, 4473) vs 12 (6, 33), p < 0·001) and

lactate (1·5 (1·1, 2·25) vs 1·2 (0·9, 1·6), p <0·001). Acute kidney injury (10% (24) vs 31% (54),

χ2 p < 0·001)) was more prevalent in those who died.

COVID-19 in the over-80s

33% (150) of patients were aged 80 years or over and the characteristics of COVID-19 in

these patients was examined. The median (IQR) age in this group was 86 (83, 91) and the

oldest was 101. 53% (70) were male.

When compared with those patients under 80 years, these patients were more frail (median

(IQR) CFS 5 (4,6 vs 3 (2, 5), p <0·001)), more likely to have been receiving care prior to

admission (51% (76) vs 14% (42),

χ2 p <0·001), and had lower BMI (median (IQR) 24 (21, 40)

vs 28 (25, 32), p <0·001). Ethnicity breakdown was significantly different in the over-80s, (

χ2

p <0·001)), with the proportions of White patients (72%) higher than in the overall caseload,

similar to the age-related ethnic composition of our older local population.

Prior diagnosis of a cardiac condition was significantly more common in those >80 years

(53% (79) vs 21% (62),

χ2 p <0·001), as was hypertension (51% (76) vs 40% (119), χ2 p = 0·02)

but diabetes, respiratory conditions and immunosuppression were not.

Patients over 80 were significantly less likely to present with the typical syndrome of

breathlessness (48% (72) vs 70% (210),

χ2 p <0·001), cough (58% (87) vs 77% (230), χ2 p

<0·001), or fever (50% (75) vs 62% (186),

χ2 p = 0·02). Median (IQR) respiratory rate was

lower at presentation (23 (19, 28) vs 26 (20, 32) p = 0·001), as was heart rate (84·5 (77·25,

96·75) vs 95 (80, 106), p < 0·001). The median (IQR) symptom duration prior to presentation

was significantly lower in the older group (4 (1, 6·25) vs 7 (2, 9) days, p <0·001).

Biomarker profiles were compared between the older and younger groups for those

biomarkers listed in Table 2. Median (IQR) troponin (56 (35·5, 94·5) vs 14 (7, 32), p < 0·001),

D-dimer (1966 (1136, 2768) vs 1120 (538, 2058), p < 0·001), and lactate (1·45 (1·1, 2·1) vs

1·3 (0·9, 1·7) were significantly higher in the over-80s while the lymphocyte count was lower

(0·76 (0·53, 1·14) vs 0·89 (0·62 vs 1·28, p = 0·007). Notably there were no differences in CRP,

procalcitonin, neutrophil count, or glucose between age groups.

Mortality was significantly higher in the older age group (60% (90) vs 28% (83),

χ2 p <0·001).

However, of the over-80s, those that died were not significantly older than those that did

not (median (IQR) age 87·5 (83·25, 91) vs 86 (82·75, 90·25), p = ns), although they were

more frail (median (IQR) CFS 6 (5, 7) vs 5 (4, 6), p = 0·002). Median (IQR) respiratory rate (24

(20, 30) vs 21 (18, 25.25), p < 0·001) and heart rate (88 (78, 99) vs 83 (74, 88), p = 0·03) were

significantly higher in those that died. Median (IQR) CRP was significantly higher in those

that died than those that survived (125 (73·25, 199·75) vs 67·50 (25·75, 119), p < 0·001));

other biomarkers were not significantly different.

Hospital-acquired infections

7% (31) of infections were hospital-onset. The median (IQR) duration of hospital stay prior

to Covid-19 testing was 20 (14, 36) days. The first hospital-onset infection was recorded 8

days after the first positive test on an inpatient; the peak of hospital-onset infections

occurred approximately 3 weeks later and mirrored that of the community-onset infections

(Figure 2).

These patients were older (median (IQR) age 80 (72·5, 88·5) vs 71 (55·5, 83), p = 0·002),

slightly more frail (median (IQR) CFS 5 (4, 6) vs 5 (3, 6), p = 0·047) and more likely to have

required care prior to admission (55% (17) vs 24% (101),

χ2 p <0·001). Median (IQR)

symptom duration was much shorter than in community-onset infections (1 (1, 2) vs 5 (2, 8)

days, p < 0·001) likely reflecting the enhanced monitoring of these hospital inpatients.

Median CRP (38·5 (12.25, 72·50) vs 104 (50, 127), p < 0·001) was significantly lower in the

hospital-onset group.

7 (23%) patients with hospital-onset infections died compared to 40% (166) of those with

community-onset infections (

χ2 p = 0·09) suggesting that despite their vulnerability their

overall outcomes were no worse. 32% (10) patients with hospital-onset infections were

asymptomatic at the time of their swab, which was performed based low oxygen

saturations or pyrexia.

Discussion

We report here the characteristics of nearly 80% of the patients with confirmed COVID-19

presenting to our busy suburban London hospital during the first six weeks of the UK peak.

The presenting features of COVID-19 in our population were similar to those seen in reports

elsewhere in terms of presenting characteristics; cough (70%), fever (58%) and

breathlessness (63%). Markers of inflammation at presentation (CRP, neutrophil count,

procalcitonin and lactate) were elevated in patients who died compared to those who were

discharged from hospital, as was the presence of elevated troponin and acute kidney injury.

CRP, in particular, seemed to be markedly associated with death independent of age, and a

cutoff of 100 was almost twice as prevalent (62% vs 35%) in those who died. This requires

further validation. A high mortality rate of 38% was seen for all inpatients, similar to

recently published UK data

11

, with a mortality of 60% in the over-80s.

The ethnic profile of the admitted patients (59% White, 41% Black and minority ethnic

[BAME]) was almost identical to that of our underlying population, which in 2020 was

7

projected to be 59·7% White and 40·3% BAME . The percentage of White patients was

higher in those who died and was 72% in those over 80 years old, again consistent with the

15

higher proportion of White people in those who are older in the borough

. This is hugely

topical presently; we did not observe the excess of morbidity and mortality recently

reported

12

among BAME patients.

Our cohort included older, frailer patients than has been seen in other studies

16

. Those

patients over 80 were less likely to present with typical symptoms of COVID-19 infection and

were more likely to have coexistent cardiac disease and elevated biochemical markers of

cardiac dysfunction. 31 (7%) of patients were classified as having hospital-acquired COVID-

19 infection, but despite being an older, frailer cohort, outcomes were no worse than those

seen in community acquired disease.

The size of this cohort, in addition to the breadth of clinical and biochemical data collected,

has allowed us to present a reasonably complete picture of COVID-19 as it presented to our

UK hospital. Whilst other studies, notably the ISARIC in the UK

11

, have reported on larger

cohorts, there has been a paucity of matched clinical and biochemical data specific to a UK

population.

In addition, we provide insight into two under-reported groups; the over-80s

and those with hospital acquired COVID-19. Despite these strengths, there are several

limitations to this study. We did not collect data on some presenting features that are

important, notably atypical symptoms at presentation and more detail on pre-existing

comorbidities and medications. Furthermore, this was an observational study and therefore

data collection was not standardised. Owing to this, and the fact that we only introduced a

clinical care bundle specifying laboratory tests two to three weeks into the outbreak, there

is a proportion of missing data in some of the biochemical variables. This will have affected

our ability to detect more subtle signals, although does not diminish the significance of

those we have reported. We also did not have follow-up data on those patients discharged

and were therefore unable to assess subsequent deaths or readmissions.

Whilst many of the findings from our study correlate with other UK reports

11

, notably a high

inpatient mortality and an increasing risk of death with increasing age and cardiac

comorbidity, striking differences were observed compared to non UK studies. This reflects

the severity of disease in those hospitalised with COVID-19 in the UK as well as the

underlying age of our population which was older with an associated increased frailty. The

UK experience therefore differs dramatically from the initial reports from China

16

, with a

reported in-hospital mortality of 1·4%. It is also higher than the 21% reported in the USA by

9

Richardson and colleagues , although that population was younger and their follow-up

duration shorter meaning that fewer patients may have reached this endpoint by the time

of analysis. It seems that, at least in the early stages of the epidemic in Wuhan, all patients

with COVID-19 were hospitalised regardless of disease severity. Hospital practice in the UK

has been to only admit those patients medically requiring hospitalisation and this is

therefore a much sicker cohort overall.

Previous studies of COVID-19 in the older population are small and have used differing

variations for ‘elderly’ ranging from 60-65 years

17, 18

; even these have included only small

numbers of patients that would be classically considered ‘elderly’ in the UK, usually over 80

but little evidence that these patients are more likely to

present atypically. Our findings confirm this and also demonstrate these patients present

earlier in their disease course suggesting lower physiological reserve. Lymphocyte count was

lower in the over-80s, possibly reflecting age-related immune dysfunction or more severe

disease. While age is independently linked to mortality

11

, above the threshold of 80 years

the exact age did not differ between outcomes. Although troponin differed significantly

between age groups, consistent with the higher incidence of cardiac disease in the over-80s,

it did not differ significantly by outcome in the elderly population. This may suggest that

although cardiac dysfunction is present in the older population it is not the cause of death

per se, although the smaller numbers here may mean that a statistically significant

association may have been missed. CRP was associated with poor outcome in this age group

but neither this nor procalcitonin differed between the age categories, suggesting that

bacterial infection is not a greater driver of disease in older patients.

The incidence of nosocomial COVID-19 has been estimated in other cohorts

20

as 44%, far

higher than we found in our patients. Data have been of poor quality, however, and

information from outside Hubei is lacking. For our analysis we used a stringent definition,

including only those patients with continuous inpatient admission for the whole of the 14-

day incubation period prior to symptoms, and the true incidence may therefore be higher.

These patients had already had prolonged admissions for unrelated reasons and

correspondingly were an older and more frail group than the population as a whole. Despite

this, CRP was lower and their outcomes were no worse, reflecting the fact that they

effectively acquired COVID-19 incidentally while in hospital rather than presenting due to

severe infection. The peak incidence of nosocomial infections mirrored the overall peak of

community infections and the mode of transmission remains unclear; this may include

relatives visiting before they were excluded and asymptomatic infected healthcare workers.

It may also have included transmission from other patients either directly or via healthcare

workers.

The data presented here contribute to the understanding of COVID-19 as it applies to a UK

population. In particular, the focus on differences in the presentation and outcomes in the

elderly is of utmost importance given the significantly higher mortality seen in this

population and the emerging picture of how COVID-19 has affected care homes. Further

research to elucidate the mechanisms by which age related biological variance impacts on

the pathogenic response in COVID-19 is vital to enabling effective therapeutic interventions.

Likewise, exploring the mechanisms by which COVID-19 infection is transmitted to and

acquired by vulnerable inpatients is crucial to enabling robust infection control policy in the

ongoing management of this and future pandemics.
