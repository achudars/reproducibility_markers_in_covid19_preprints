Abstract
Introduction: Within the UK, COVID-19 has contributed towards over 103,000 deaths.
Multiple risk factors for COVID-19 have been identified including various demographics, comorbidities, biochemical parameters, and physical assessment findings. However, using this
vast data to improve clinical care has proven challenging.
Aims: to develop a reliable, multivariable predictive model for COVID-19 in-patient
outcomes, to aid risk-stratification and earlier clinical decision-making.
Methods: Anonymized data regarding 44 independent predictor variables of 355 adults
diagnosed with COVID-19, at a UK hospital, was manually extracted from electronic patient
records for retrospective, case-controlled analysis. Primary outcomes included inpatient
mortality, level of ventilatory support and oxygen therapy required, and duration of inpatient
treatment. Secondary pulmonary embolism was the only secondary outcome. After balancing
data, key variables were feature selected for each outcome using random forests. Predictive
models were created using Bayesian Networks, and cross-validated.
Results: Our multivariable models were able to predict, using feature selected risk factors, the
probability of inpatient mortality (F1 score 83.7%, PPV 82%, NPV 67.9%); level of ventilatory
support required (F1 score varies from 55.8% “High-flow Oxygen level” to 71.5% “ITUAdmission level”); duration of inpatient treatment (varies from 46.7% for “≥ 2 𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠 𝑏𝑢𝑡 <
3 𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠" to 69.8% “≤ 1 𝑑𝑎𝑦”); and risk of pulmonary embolism sequelae (F1 score 85.8%,
PPV of 83.7%, and NPV of 80.9% ).
Conclusion: Overall, our findings demonstrate reliable, multivariable predictive models for 4
outcomes, that utilize readily available clinical information for COVID-19 adult inpatients.
Further research is required to externally validate our models and demonstrate their utility as
clinical decision-making tools.

1. Introduction
On Thursday the 5th of March 2020, within the UK, COVID-19 claimed the life of its first
victim and has since contributed towards over 103,000 deaths [1,2]. The Office of National
Statistics (ONS) has since issued statements, based on population data, in conjunction with the
National Health Service (NHS), indicating an increased risk of mortality from COVID-19
amongst poorer socioeconomic groups, Black and Minority Ethnics (BAME), males and the
elderly [3–6]. In addition to demographics, various biochemical parameters and co-morbidities,
such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and
malignancy, have been identified as risk factors for poor COVID-19 outcomes [7–10].
However, using this vast data to improve clinical care has proven challenging. One particular
challenge that remains is relatively quantifying the impact of various prognostic indicators on
COVID-19 outcomes, especially whilst in the presence of combinations of other variables, in
order to assist clinical decision making and risk stratification.
Due to the limited nature of healthcare resources, such as hospital beds and ventilators,
clinicians are often faced with difficult decisions where they must ration resources between
patients, often having ethical implications [11]. Currently, clinicians are allocating healthcare
resources to COVID-19 patients semi-quantitatively, and often as a response to clinical
deterioration. Various risk stratification models have been described in the literature such as
the 4C tool [12], but are currently not being used clinically due to criticism in recent systematic
reviews [13,14]. Some of the key problems with existing risk-stratification tools are unclear
methodologies, the exclusion of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 using CT imaging but with
negative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) nasopharyngeal swabs, small
sample sizes, many patients not reaching a study outcome, automated data extraction relying
on clinical coding and many studies only exploring inpatient mortality as a primary outcome.
In addition, many predictive models have been developed using patient data from other parts
of the world, which may not be generalizable to the UK population due to patient factors,
hospital factors and virus factors. Finally, only a small selection of risk-stratification tools
analysed a wide host of independent variables including vital observations, biochemical
markers, demographics, and co-morbidities.
The aim of this study was to develop a reliable, multivariable, predictive model, which utilizes
readily available clinical data, to serve as a quantitative tool to aid risk-stratification, and earlier
clinical decision-making for adult, hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

2. Methods
2.1 Study Design and Setting
This retrospective, case-controlled study was conducted at Milton Keynes University Hospital
(MKUH), which is a medium sized, 550 bed, and district general hospital in the United
Kingdom. Data was collected during the routine clinical care of patients for auditing purposes,
and upon receiving Health Research Authority (HRA) approval, the anonymous data was then
also used for research purposes. The study aimed to follow the Transparent Reporting of a
multivariable prediction model for Individual Prediction of Diagnosis (TRIPOD) checklist [15]
and was conducted according to a pre-defined study protocol.

2.2 Study Population
Adult patients diagnosed with positive RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swabs or Computed
Tomography (CT) scans with changes suggestive of COVID-19 [16], between 01/03/2020 and
22/04/2020 at MKUH, were included in this study. 69 patients were excluded which is shown
below in Table 1, to produce a final n number of 355. The sample size was determined by using
the maximum number of COVID-19 patients diagnosed during the study period. The study end
date was the date of initiating independent predictor variable data collection (22/4/2020)
whereas the study start date was the date of the first COVID-19 patient diagnosis (1/3/2020).
Patient characteristic information is shown in Supplementary Table 1.

2.3 Data Collection
The hospital Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) was searched to get the
details of the CT scan reports of patients with suspected COVID-19 changes, from 01/03/2020
till 22/04/2020. Reports dictated by a consultant radiologist, and CT scan images where
required, were screened for all patients who have changes suggestive of COVID-19 [17]. The
radiologically positive cases were included in the study. A record of all the COVID-19 RTPCR positive swabs was obtained from microbiology department. After removing the
duplicates, the CT positive and RT-PCR swab positive cases were populated to a Microsoft
Excel spreadsheet. Further patient data from the hospital Electronic Patient Record System
(EPR), or eCare, was collected in accordance with data protection and Good Clinical Practise
(GCP) guidelines, on a hospital computer, by a team of physicians. Specific instructions were
issued to the team of physicians to use during the collection of data to ensure homogenous,
standardized interpretation of data from eCare. Healthcare staff who had historically recorded
patient information on the EPR during clinical assessment were, of course at the time, blind to
the outcomes and hypotheses of this study. All data was checked for systematic error by at least
1 other physician. After data collection, data was fully anonymized.

2.4 Independent Predictor Variables
Independent predictor variables were selected for inclusion in this study a priori based on
three criteria; (i) having a postulated role for influencing COVID-19 severity based on
surrounding literature, (ii) values expected to be available for at least one-third of study
participants and (iii) values being collected during the routine care of study participants. 44
independent predictor variables were used for analysis in this study, which are shown below
in Table 2.

2.5 Outcomes
All patients were either discharged or deceased and thus achieved all four outcomes; (i)
inpatient mortality (IPD), (ii) duration of COVID-19 treatment (ADT), and (iii) maximum level
of oxygen or ventilatory support during inpatient stay (MOoVS), which was divided into 4
categories: (A) requiring room air or oxygen, (B) requiring high-flow oxygen defined as using
a venturi mask, (C) requiring non-invasive ventilation (continuous positive airway pressure
(CPAP) or bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP)) and (D) requiring intubation. A new
confirmed diagnosis of pulmonary embolism during inpatient stay (NCPE) was the fourth
outcome. The outcomes were selected for this study a priori based on 3 criteria: (i) All patients
will be able to reach one of the pre-defined study outcomes, (ii) The pre-defined study

outcomes are representative of COVID-19 severity based on the surrounding literature at the
time of study design and (iii) The pre-defined study outcomes will involve data collected in the
routine care of study participants. The follow-up period was defined as 2 months to give all
patients ample time to achieve a study outcome prior to outcome data collection. During the
above-mentioned data collection time-period, if a patient was admitted more than once, and
both times were for COVID-19 related reasons within 5 days of each other, this was counted
as a failed discharge and thus 1 admission. Days spent in hospital for social reasons or
alternative diagnoses prior to developing COVID-19 were subtracted from the duration of
inpatient stay to derive the duration of inpatient treatment outcome. The day of COVID-19
clinical presentation was retrospectively determined by physicians during data collection, after
careful analysis of the patient notes, in order to determine the first day during the inpatient stay
where COVID-19 was diagnosed clinically, based on the full repertoire of available clinical
information.

2.6 Data Pre-processing
In this study, for a small sample size of n=355 patients, we wish to model the outcomes
described in Section 2.5 based on 44 independent variables described in Table 2. However, it
was desired to develop a hybrid Bayesian network or other types of probabilistic supervised
machine learning methods for modelling continuous and categorical random variables together
but learning a suitable model for this messy and small dataset would be almost impractical. As
a result, we first convert all the continuous random variables to the categorical variables based
on the discretisation method proposed in [18] and taking into account the medical experts’
opinions. In the next stage, we need to deal with the considerable missing values of several
variables, which could have a significant impact on the derived results and conclusions made
for the health decision makers. The strategies to overcome missing data impact will be
discussed in Section 2.7.
2.6.1 Missing data analysis
Observing missing values in a real-world research is quite common to happen due to various
reasons [19]. It is of great importance to either appropriately estimate or fill the missing values
before a suitable statistical or machine learning method was selected to data, or appropriate
adjustment must be made to the selected model to make them robust against the missing values
impact [20].
There are various techniques to handle missingness including listwise deletion, pairwise
deletion, dummy variable adjustment, marginal mean imputation, regression imputation,
maximum likelihood (ML), and multiple imputation (MI) [21,22]. The listwise deletion
technique that results in unbiased estimations is recommended by [21] to deal with the missing
data mechanism, which depends on the values of the independent variables only. In this study,
no outcome (or dependent) variable was missing, but there were several independent variables
with high number of missing values. The biochemistry features, including max CRP levels at
the different days were among the independent random variables with the highest percentages
of missing values ranging from 40% to 70%. However, limited number of missing values could
be observed on the rest of independent variables. Due to the high number of missing values in
many of the independent random variables, the multiple imputation technique was selected as
the most suitable technique and used to estimate the missing values in the dataset.

2.6.2 Balancing Outcomes
As discussed in Section 2.6, we first need to convert all the continuous random variables to the
categorical variables based on the discretisation method proposed in [18] and taking into
account the medical experts’ opinions. After converting the continuous and multi-scale discrete
independent and dependent random variables into the categorical ones, and estimating the
missing values using the MI technique (see Section 2.6.1 and [21,22]), it was observed that the
resulting outcome variables suffer from a considerable imbalance. For example, only 4.8% of
NCPE outcome responses were “Yes” and 95.2% were “NO”. The other outcomes, including
IPD, ADT and MOoVS were also severely imbalanced (see Section 3 for the details). The
predictions resulted from fitting a suitable ML/Statistical model (e.g., BN) to the imbalanced
datasets, whereby one class is dominant, would be inherently biased towards the dominant
class, thus decreasing the reliability of the predictions made by the models [23–25]. In
supervised machine learning, different methods can be used to address the issues caused by an
imbalanced dataset [24,25]. These include: (i) Cost-sensitive learning, which involves
manipulating the threshold values, (ii) Imbalanced dataset pre-processing, which can involve
oversampling, under-sampling, or Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), (iii)
Algorithm level approaches, such as active learning and kernel modifications, and (iv)
Ensemble learning, such as cost-sensitive boosting [25]. The literature suggests that there is no
best strategy to deal with the issues caused by imbalanced datasets [25].
In this study, the authors used the SMOTE to overcome the imbalance in the dataset [26]. The
advantage of this technique over other oversampling methods is that it decreases the imbalance
in a dataset by synthetically creating new examples of the minority class, and not duplicating
them [26,27]. The authors applied the SMOTE on the entire dataset, in concordance with the
surrounding literature [28–31]. The details of the balanced outcomes resulted from performing
SMOTE are given in Sections 3.1-3.4.
2.6.3 Feature selection
One essential stage in the development of predictive models using supervised Machine
Learning (ML) techniques is the selection of relevant variables [23]. This process, which is
known as feature selection, includes identifying and choosing the best combination of
independent variables in a dataset for efficient and optimum analysis of the problem at hand
[23,24] .The rationale behind it is that in a dataset, some variables can be redundant, for
example due to multicollinearity, or not relevant to the response. The presence of redundant
and irrelevant features in a dataset can seriously hamper the accuracy of the predictions. By
performing robust feature selection, predictive models that perform optimally on both seen and
unseen data could be developed effectively. Hence, feature selection attempts to discard
irrelevant and redundant independent variables that do not contribute to the development of a
reliable predictive model [25]. It is noteworthy that in the process of selecting variables, only
the training data are considered to avoid inaccurate estimates of the test errors [25,26].
There are three methods for selecting a subset of features [27,28]. Filter methods use statistical
properties of the features, such as correlation coefficients, F-test, T-test, or information-theory
based measures, such as mutual information and interaction information, in order to rank
features based on their relevance to the response and other variables [23,27,29,30]. These
methods can be grouped into univariate filter methods and multivariate filter methods.
Univariate filter methods rank features only based on their relevance to the response, whereas
multivariate filter methods consider the interaction between features as well [27].

Wrappers are the second method for feature selection [23]. In this group of techniques, a
machine learning model is used to score subsets of features based on the predictive power of
the method. The process of feature selection can be categorized into forward-selection,
backward-elimination, and mixed selection [26]. Forward-selection methods start modelling
with zero predictors (a base model), choose features step-by-step, and evaluate the
performance. Whereas, backward feature elimination methods start with the complete set of
independent variables and look for an optimum subset of variables with the best performance
through stepwise elimination of non-informative features [26]. Mixed methods combine
forward-selection and backward elimination techniques. Wrappers use cross-validation to
optimise the performance of the learning method in order to select the optimum subset of
variables [27].
A third approach that is sometimes grouped with wrappers [23] is the embedded or intrinsic
method [27,31]. Similar to wrappers that select a subset of variables based on a learning model,
embedded methods embed this process into its predictive model development [27]. For
instance, if the variable importance measure of the random forest method is used to improve
the performance of a random forest model, then it is an embedded method. Whereas, if this
capability is used to select features and develop predictive models with methods other than the
random forest, then it is a wrapper method.
For its feature selection, this study adopts the recursive feature elimination (RFE) method,
which is a backward variable selection wrapper technique [31]. For this purpose, the authors
computed the RFE method in R (version 4.0.2) using the random forest (RF) function
embedded in the Caret package [32,33]. As the first stage, the dataset is randomly split into
70% training and 30% testing using the validation set approach [26]. Subsequently, using the
training data, a predictive model containing all features is developed based on the random forest
method. This model then ranks the features based on a measure of importance. Consequently,
the RFE method eliminates the least important feature, develops a new model based on a
smaller number of independent variables, and re-ranks the remaining predictors [31]. RFE
identifies two parameters: the number of subsets to evaluate and the number of predictors in
each of the subsets. For each subset, the process of eliminating the least-important features
continues until it reaches a determined subset size. Eventually, RFE compares the predictive
performance of all subsets and determines the best subset size with the best accuracy [31]. In
this study, the performance of the wrappers is assessed using k-fold Cross-Validation (k=10),
which repeats five times.
Since the RFE uses a supervised Machine Learning method to perform feature selection, it is
essential to evaluate the performance of the resulting RF model. In supervised ML, the
validation set approach, k-fold Cross-Validation (kfCV), and Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation
(LOOCV) are the three main methods to perform this task [26]. The kfCV method randomly
divides the dataset into k groups of observations (folds) with roughly equal sizes. The kfCV
method uses the first fold for testing the model and the remaining k-1 folds for training it. This
process repeats k times until all folds are once used for testing the performance of the model
developed with the remaining k-1 folds. These k performances are averaged to calculate the
mean performance of the predictive model [26]. While k is an arbitrary number and can take
any number less than the number of observations in a dataset, empirically, values of 5 or 10
show resistance against high bias or variance [26]. In this paper, k=10 guarantees a higher

number of training observations in each fold to improve the predictive performance of the
model [26].
The kfCV is advantageous over the validation set approach and LOOCV for the following
reasons. In the case of the former, since the dataset is randomly divided into a training and a
testing set, if the process repeats, it could result in different predictions. And in the case of the
latter, the LOOCV tends to result in higher variance on the unseen observations [26].
The result of the feature selection using the RFE method for each of these responses is shown
in Table 3. Moreover, Figure 1 shows the performance of the RFE method based on the ranks
of the variables. In this figure, the red circle shows the maximum achievable performance based
on the best combination of variables. For instance, in panel (a) (NCPE outcome); the accuracy
of the model using only ‘UoB’ is approximately 81%. By adding variables based on their rank
(Table 3), the accuracy of the model improves. In the case of NCPE (panel (a)), after adding
“Age”, the accuracy increases to 84%, and so on (Figure 1).

Table 3 and Figure 1 (a)-(d) show that for each outcome, there is a specific combination of
independent variables that produce the highest predictive performance among all other possible
combination of variables for the selected outcome. For instance, UoB, Age, MADA, LyDP,
NDP, temperature, gender, D-Dimer (MDD), MCRP7, MCRP5, obesity and LDP, covering
93% accuracy, would be sufficient to model the NCPE outcome. Therefore, these variables
will be used for developing the probabilistic predictive model. The numbers against each
variable for the corresponding response indicates the predictive importance of that factor. The
details of the most relevant variables affecting each response variable will be provided in
Section 3.

2.7 Bayesian Networks
A Bayesian network (BN) is a probabilistic graphical model that is used to represent knowledge
about an uncertain domain [34]. Each random variable is represented by a node in the BN. A
conditional probability table (CPT) is attached to each node. A link, or ‘edge’, between two
nodes represents a probabilistic dependency between the linked nodes. The ‘directed’ links are
shown with an arrow pointing from the causal node to the effect node. There must not be any

directed cycles: one cannot return to a node simply by following a series of directed links. This
means that BNs are Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Nodes without a child node are called
leaf nodes, nodes without a parent node are called root nodes, and nodes with parent and child
nodes are called intermediate nodes. A BN represents dependence and conditional
independence relationships among the nodes using joint probability distributions, with an
ability to incorporate human oriented qualitative inputs. The method is well established for
representing cause-effect relationships.
Applications of BN methods are found in a growing number of disciplines and policies [35,55].
BNs are particularly useful for evaluation because of their capability of classification based on
observations. Moreover, a BN can do unsupervised learning from a dataset and allow the
learning algorithm to find both structure and probabilities. This means the policy-, or decisionmaker does not need to know how to learn the BN, although it is possible to aid the learning
algorithm with a priori knowledge about relations and probabilities. Dealing with uncertainty
when evaluating policy is a challenge that can be addressed using BNs because some uncertain
probabilities of variables may be safely ignored to get to the desired probabilistic quantity of a
random variable. Furthermore, BNs engage directly with subjective data in a transparent way.
Hence, the method could be considered as a tool to explore beliefs, evidence, and their logical
implications, as opposed to a means of proving concepts in some absolute sense.
BN learning consists of two general steps:
•
•

Finding DAG (or the network structure) which illustrates the inter-dependency
between the variables/nodes, and denoted by G:
Finding CPT (or conditional probability density) for each node given the values of its
parents on the learned network structure G.

Finding the best DAG is the crucial step in BN design. Construction of a graph to describe a
BN is commonly achieved based on probabilistic methods, which utilize databases of records
[29,36,46, 54], such as the search and score approach. In this approach, a search through the
space of possible DAGs is performed to find the best DAG. The number of DAGs, 𝑓(𝑝), as a
function of the number of nodes, 𝑝, grows exponentially with p [37].

3. Results
3.1 Modelling inpatient mortality (IPD) using BNs
In this section, we provide the details of modelling inpatient mortality (IPD) using BN as
described in the methods. Modelling the IPD based on the massively incomplete and
imbalanced data using BN models is very challenging. Prior to learning the BN structure and
corresponding CPTs, the original categorised data was completed by estimating the missing
values of the independent variables using the multiple imputation technique (see also Section
2.6.1). We then used the ML-based technique known as “SMOTE” which is briefly explained
in Subsection 2.6.2, to balance data with respect to “IPD” response variable. It should be noted
that 30% of IPD outcome responses were “Yes” and 70% were “NO”. We then perform the
feature selection approaches as described in Section 2.6.3, to identify the most important risk
factors affecting the inpatient mortality (IPD). The results of the feature selection are reported
in Table 3, Figure 1, and Figure 14 in appendix A.

The BN structure learned from the data only for IPD based on the most important factors
affecting IPD (as illustrated in Table 3) is shown in Figure 2. This network structure was

learned from the completed data by evaluating the best model out of various score-based or
constraints-based methods [38]. From this model, it is evident that the way that several
independent variables affecting IPD is not correct, and it should be in reverse. For example,
Age, MADA and OS are among the most important risk factors, which affect IPD rather than
be affected by IPD. Therefore, it was important to discuss the resulting BN model, illustrated
in Figure 2 with the domain medical experts, and consequently revise this BN by considering
experts’ opinions. The revised BN model learned based on the combination of data and expert
opinions, whilst also validated using several model diagnostic algorithms, such as k-fold cross
validation, is illustrated in Figure 3.

In the BN model proposed for modelling IPD, the strength of the link, as well as the associated
uncertainty, is captured using probabilities and statistical distributions, which are estimated or
derived based on the observed data. Figure 4 shows the learned BN with the estimated marginal
probabilities shown on each node. In this BN, three nodes (Age, CKD, and Ethnicity) are
considered as root nodes, and their parameters are learned by estimating these probabilities
using the maximum likelihood method (MLE) or Bayes estimate. The estimated marginal and
conditional probabilities for the variables can be updated in the light of new evidence or data
using a statistical algorithm known as the Bayes rule [36]. Hence, the BN can compute the
probability of surviving or dying due to COVID-19, based on the different combination of the
parent nodes, including Age, the minimum Albumin level during admission (MADA), and the
mean CRP level during days 7-8 since clinical presentation of COVID-19 (MCRP7). For
example, Table 4 shows the probabilities of death and survival of patients at different age
groups. It confirms the reported findings that as the age of a patient increases; the risk of
mortality also increases. To be precise, the death rate of Covid-19 patients’ ≥70 years is 5 times
larger than patients’ ≤40 years. These probabilities can be updated by observing more evidence
about the states of other influencing variables.

Table 5 shows the conditional probabilities of IPD given the selected configurations of its
parent nodes, including Age, MADA and MCRP7. It can be concluded that for the patients in
the first age group (<40 years) if the MADA is above 35 g/L, they will survive the Covid-19
regardless of MCRP7. For a patient in this age group and with the MADA level less than 30
g/L, they would more likely survive if their MCRP7 were less than 50 mg/L. This means that
when the MADA level is less than 30 g/L, reflective of malnourishment and frailty, patients
are at a particularly high risk especially if their MCRP7 level is above 50 mg/L. Interestingly,
similar patterns can be found for the patients aged >70 years old, but the corresponding survival
probabilities are considerably lower. Overall, these results indicate how albumin negatively,
whilst CRP and age positively, correlate with inpatient mortality in an additive manner.

Table 6 shows the probabilities of IPD given the lowest recorded oxygen saturation (OS) on
the day of clinical presentation with COVID-19, computed from the learned BN model
illustrated in Figure 4. As OS decreases, the risk of mortality increases, suggesting that there
is a negative association between these two variables.

Table 7 illustrates the conditional probability of IPD given different configurations of OS,
Ethnicity, changes on chest X-ray (CCX), and age of patients. The illustrated results in this
table suggest that the risk of inpatient mortality is elevated for patients with reduced oxygen
saturations and older patients. Ethnicity seems to increase the risk of death in patients 70<
years, which is concordant with surrounding literature [4], however the results were not true
for younger patients. This may have been due to a skewed population demographic whereby
older patients tended to be Caucasian and younger patients reflected a more multicultural
demographic. CCX did not seem to significantly affect the risk of IPD, perhaps because the
presence of changes is more likely an indicator of the time-point that an individual is along
their COVID-19 infection rather than an indicator of severity.
The next important research question is that how the trend in CRP levels at the different days,
in addition to the individual CRP levels, can be incorporated and evaluated using an appropriate
model. This is because CRP levels can often correlate with infection severity, with a small
associated lag time, and therefore the trend in CRP is useful clinically for predicting what will
happen to the patient. For example, if the gradient between the latest two CRP variables were
positive, it would indicate that the infection is getting worse, whereas if the gradient were
negative, it would indicate infection resolution. To account for the gradient between the CRPs,
a dynamic version of BN needs to be developed, which is not possible due to the lack of training
data. However, the BN model illustrated in Figure 4 can be used to compute the risk of inpatient
mortality for different levels of CRP at the different days during the clinical course of COVID19 infection, as shown below in Table 8.
Table 8 provides the probabilities of inpatient mortality for the selected configurations of the
mean CRP on days 1-2 (MCRP1) and 7-8 (MCRP7) since clinical presentation with COVID19, as well as Age and MADA. As shown, if the level of MADA is 35<, increases or decreases
in CRP levels during the clinical course of COVID-19 infection will not impose a mortality
risk in patients <40 years. However, in patients aged 70< years, any increase in CRP levels
(mg/L) between days 1-2 and days 7-8, would significantly increase mortality risk. In this age
group, if MADA levels are also below 30 g/L, and their MCRP increases from <30 mg/L,
during days 1-2 since clinical COVID-19 presentation, to 100< mg/L during days 7-8 since
clinical COVID-19 presentation, our data in Table 8 indicates that the risk of inpatient mortality
can increase as high as 86.5%.

F1 Score is the Harmonic Mean between precision and recall and Table 9 indicates the high F1
score (83.7%) and accuracy (84.1) of our BN model developed for IPD, despite the small
dataset used to train and test our BN model. 82% (PPV) of adult patients predicted to die as
inpatients during clinical COVID-19 infection, by our model, will die. However, only 67.86%
(NPV) of adult COVID-19 patients predicted to survive the inpatient admission will indeed
survive. This indicates that our model may fail to predict inpatient death a sub-set of adult
COVID-19 patients, but we expect this to improve with a larger dataset, which also
incorporates more variables such as socioeconomic factors.

3.2 Modelling Duration of Treatment for COVID-19 using BNs
The next outcome of interest is the duration of treatment for Covid-19 in days (ADT). Like the
IPD variable, ADT outcome data was imbalanced. Out of the 355 patients in this study, 100,
88, and 167 patients were admitted to hospital for up to one day (‘1’), 2 to 3 days (‘2’) and 4
days or more (‘3’), respectively. As a result, the dataset was first balanced in terms of the ADT
variable, using the methods described in Section 2.61. We then conducted the feature selection,
as per methods described in Section 2.62, to identify the most important risk factors affecting
ADT. The results of the feature selection are reported in Table 3, Figure 1, and Figure 15 in
appendix A. The first 11 most relevant independent variables influencing ADT were then
selected, based on the feature selection results to learn a BN for ADT based on the observed
processed data. This was then combined with the elicited expert opinions about the network
structure. The BN model learned based on the combination of data and expert opinions, and
also critically validated against other suitable BNs learned based on the observed data only,
using several model diagnostic algorithms, including k-fold cross validation, is shown in Figure
8. This illustrates interdependencies between ADT and the most relevant independent
variables.

Figure 4 The BN with conditional probability tables learned for “ADT” outcome based on the combined elicited
domain expert opinions with the (balanced) data.

Table 10 illustrates several metrics to assess predictive performance of the proposed BN for
the 3 different categories of ADT. Examining the raw classification accuracy is the first step
in assessing the performance of a model. This can be done by computing the overall
classification accuracy rate that corresponds to the proportion of observations that have been
correctly classified. Despite the small sample size and high percentages of missing values of
the raw data, the computed overall accuracy of 61.5% is very promising. However, the original
data transformed to be balanced with respect to the ADT outcome variable, but the ADT
variable and the selected test data set are still quite imbalanced. As a result, the balanced
accuracy for each state of ADT was computed which are reported in Table 10. The lowest
balanced accuracy is computed for ‘2 ≤ 𝐴𝐷𝑇 < 3′ days which indicates that this class
represented a minority in comparison to the other classes. The computed sensitivity measures,
which is the metric to evaluate the learned BN ability to predict true positives of each available
category of ADT, suggest that “ADT > 3” days has the highest rate (77%), and ‘2 ≤ 𝐴𝐷𝑇 < 3′
days has the lowest sensitivity rate (41.4%). We also compute specificity, which is the metric
to evaluate the fitted BN ability to predict true negatives of each ADT category. The results
suggest “ADT < 1” days (83.5%) and “ADT > 3” days are the categories with the highest and
lowest specificity rates, respectively. The next important metric is F1-score that can be
interpreted as a weighted average of the precision and sensitivity values, where an F1 score
reaches its best value at 1 and worst value at 0. Since, the F1-score takes both false positives
and false negatives into account; it will be usually more useful than accuracy, especially if the

Understanding the simultaneous impact of MADA, obesity, and MCRP1 on the duration of
COVID-19 treatment in patients is increasingly important to manage the growing, unrelenting
pressures on hospitals and the NHS. Table 11 shows the probabilities of several important
queries computed from the learned BN illustrated in Figure 8. As it is evident from this table,
the duration of treatment of 71% of non-obese COVID-19 patients with normal MADA levels
(>35 g/L) and low MCRP1 (<30 mg/L) is up to one day. In addition, the treatment duration of
95% of the patients with the above characteristics would be less than 3 days. In comparison to
the obese patients, it can be observed this probability (i.e., probability that the duration of
treatment is up to one day) will be reduced to 54.4% (with the same characteristics). On the
other hand, the predicted probabilities for duration of treatment of the obese and on-obese
patients, with very low levels of MADA (<30 g/L), regardless of levels of MCRP1, are not
significantly different from each other. Furthermore, the model and results reported in Table
11 suggest that the levels of MCRP1 alone would not be adequate to accurately predict the
probabilities of treatment duration of more than 3 days. These probabilities must be updated
by adding more evidence about the levels of MCRP at other days. It would be straightforward
to revise and update the BN illustrated in Figure 8 by augmenting the other outcomes, for
example “IPD”, to understand what proportion of patients with a treatment duration < 3 days
may not survive. Overall, it can be observed that the COVID-19 treatment duration is higher
for obese patients with high CRP levels and low Albumin levels.

categories are ‘1’ (< 1 day), ‘2’ (>2 days but < 3 days) and ‘3’ (> 3 days). MCRP1 has been divided into 3

Similar to the IPD outcome, it is of great interest to understand how the trend in CRP at
different days along the course of COVID-19 infection, in addition to the individual CRP
levels, can be incorporated and evaluated using the learned BN for ADT, as shown in Figure
8. By a similar argument discussed above, the conditional probabilities of ADT given CRP
levels at different days are computed for the ADT variable. Table 12 illustrates the conditional
probabilities of ADT given different levels of MCRP1 and MCRP7. The results provided in
this table suggest that if there is an increasing gradient from MCRP1 to MCRP7, which
represents a worsening infection, the probability that the patient will require at least 3 days of
treatment will consequently increase from 28% to 41%. On the contrary, if there is a decreasing
gradient from MCRP1 to MCRP7, which represents a resolving infection, the probability that
the patients require at least 3 days of treatment will correspondingly decrease from the early
prediction of 37%, to less than 26%.

categories are ‘1’ (< 1 day), ‘2’ (>2 days but < 3 days) and ‘3’ (> 3 days). MCRP1 has been divided into 3

3.3 Modelling Max Oxygen or Ventilatory Support (MOoVS) using Bayesian
networks
Modelling MOoVS based on the provided data using a BN model was very challenging, as this
variable was severely imbalanced; Not requiring High Flow Oxygen (NHF) (63.4%), requiring
High Flow Oxygen (HF) (25.9%), requiring CPAP/NIV (CPN) (4.5%) and requiring ITU
Admission (ITU) (6.2%). The BN was first fitted to this imbalanced and small dataset, but the
predictive performance metrics were poor. In order to resolve this issue, we use the ML-based
technique known as “SMOTE" which is briefly explained in Subsection 2.61, to make data
balanced with respect to “MOoVS”. The results presented in this section are derived after the
MOoVS variable was balanced using the SMOTE method.
We then conduct the feature selection approaches as described in Section 2.62, to identify the
most important risk factors affecting MOoVS. The results of the feature selection are reported
in Table 3, Figure 1, and Figure 16 in appendix A. The first 10 most relevant independent
variables affecting MOoVS were then selected based on the feature selection results (Table 3)
to learn a BN for MOoVS. This BN was learned based on the observed processed data,
combined with domain expert opinions about the network structure and model predictions. The
performance of the resulting BN model was critically examined and compared against other
suitable BN candidates which were learned based on the observed data only, using several
model diagnostic algorithms, including k-fold cross validation. The BN model illustrated in
Figure 10, explaining interdependencies between MOoVS and the most relevant independent

Figure 6 The BN with conditional probability tables learned for “MOoVS” outcome based on the combined
elicited domain expert opinions with the (balanced) data.

Table 13 illustrates several metrics to assess predictive performance of the proposed BN for
the different states of “MOoVS”. The overall classification accuracy suggests that over 60%
of cases have been correctly classified. Despite the small sample size of data and high
percentages of missing values of the raw data, the computed overall accuracy (60.25%) is quite
promising. As stated above, the original imbalanced database was transformed using the
SMOTE method to balance the dataset with respect to the ADT outcome variable. However,
the resulting MOoVS variable (comprising of NHF (24.5%), HF (28%), CPN (27%) and ITU,
20.5%), and the selected test dataset are still quite imbalanced. As a result, the balanced
accuracy for each category of MOoVS is computed and reported in Table 13. It can be observed
that the balanced accuracy of each state is significantly improved (compared to the overall
accuracy), varying from 63.6% (“CPN”) to 80.7% (“ITU”). The ability to predict true positives
of each available category of MOoVS is measured by Recall, or Sensitivity, which suggests
“ITU” has the highest rate (89%), and “CPN” has the lowest sensitivity rate (36%). We also
compute specificity whereby “CPN” (91%) and “ITU” (73%) are the categories with the
highest and lowest rates, respectively. Since the original raw data has an uneven class
distribution, F1-score as a weighted average of the precision and sensitivity values would be
very useful. The computed F1-scoures for most of MOoVS categories, except “High flow O2”
(56%) are promising.

It is of great important to understand how the right level of Max oxygen (HF, or NHF), or
ventilatory support should be selected, depending on the level of MADA, state of Oxygen
Saturations (OS), and levels of MCRP11, to enhance the survival rate and recovery speed of
COVID-19 patients. Table 14 shows the probabilities of requiring different levels of oxygen
or ventilatory support given different states of MADA, OS and MCRP11 levels. The illustrated
results in this table suggest that most of the patients with the better health characteristics such
as high MADA (>35 g/L), high OS (≥ 92%), and low MCRP11 (≤100 mg/L) are likely to only
require no-high flow O2 (73%) or high flow O2 (12.5%). These patients are thus suitable for
ward-based care and will not need ITU admission. On the contrary, when MADA and OS levels
respectively drop to below 30 g/L and 91%, and MCRP11 level increases to over 100 mg/L,
the need is increased for these patients to receive CPAP/NIV (37%) or ITU admission (49%).

The probabilities given in Table 14 can be significantly altered in the light of new evidence,
such as patient age. The updated probabilities are shown below in Table 15. For example, all
young patients with OS ≥92, MADA≤30 & MCRP11≤100, require either NHF (80%) or HF
(20%) to recover. If MADA levels of young patients increase to over 35 g/L, with the same
levels of OS (≥92) and MCRP11 (< 30), they will more likely need to use only NHF (93%) to
recover. However, if the health of the patients start to deteriorate, as MADA and OS levels
respectively drop to <30 g/L and <92%; and MCRP11 level increases to over 100 mg/L, their
need for HF, CPN or ITU will significantly increase depending to the age of patient. For the
young patients, CPAP/NIV (36.5%) or ITU (63.5%) would be recommended. However, for
patients > 70 years, either HF (22%) or CPAP/NIV (76%), and paradoxically not ITU (0%),
would be recommended usually because they are deemed unsuitable for ITU admission due

3.4 Modelling New Confirmed Pulmonary embolism during Admission (NCPE)
using Bayesian networks
Modelling the new confirmed pulmonary embolism during admission (NCPE) based on the
massively incomplete and imbalanced data using BN models, similar to modelling of other
outcomes of interests discussed above, was very challenging. In order to resolve this issue, we
used the ML-based technique known as “SMOTE" which is briefly explained in Subsection
2.61, to balance data with respect to “NCPE”. We then perform the feature selection approaches
as described in Section 2.62, to identify the most important risk factors affecting the NCPE.
The results of the feature selection are reported in Table 3, Figure 1, and Figure 17 in appendix
A. The first 12 most relevant independent variables affecting NCPE were then selected based
on the reported feature selection results, to learn a BN model for NCPE. This BN was learned
based on the observed processed and balanced data, combined with the expert opinions elicited
from the domain experts about the network structure and the effective covariates on the NCPE.
The performance of the resulting BN model was critically examined and compared against
other suitable BN candidates (which were learned by including the observed data only), using
several model diagnostic algorithms, including k-fold cross validation. The BN model
illustrated in Figure 12, explaining interdependencies between NCPE and the most relevant
independent variables, is the final selected model after critical model checking and considering
the domain experts’ feedbacks.

We first use different metrics, including PPV, NPV, sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy,
and F-Score, to evaluate the predictive performance of the BN suggested to model the NCPE
in terms of the related factors as illustrated in Figure 12. The values of these metric for the
learned BN for NCPE are computed in Table 16.
The computed F1-score of almost 86% shows the classification prediction of the learned BN
for NCPE is quite precise and is robust (in the sense that it does not miss a significant number
of instances). In addition, the PPV (83.7%), sensitivity (88%) and NPV (80.9%), which
collectively represent the BN model’s ability to predict inpatient NCPE, was high.

One of the hypotheses of interest is whether there is a significant association between the extent
of COVID-19 changes on CT scan (UoB) with NCPE. Table 17 shows the conditional
probability of NCPE given the different states of UoB. The reported results in this table suggest
that there is strong association between “bilateral” states of UoB with NCPE, based on the
computed conditional probability, of 72.4%. This suggests that more extensive ground-glass
or consolidative changes on CT scan secondary to COVID-19 may be associated with the
development of PE sequelae secondary to COVID-19.

Another research question that can be verified using the BN developed for the NCPE is to
explore whether there is a significant association between the maximum D-Dimer during
admission (MDD levels) with NCPE. Table 18 shows the conditional probability of NCPE
given the different states of MDD. It can be concluded that there is a moderate association
between high values of MDD with NCPE (54.5%).

Table 19 reports the joint impact of UoB and MDD on NCPE. The results suggest that the
presence of NCPE is more significantly influenced by the presence of bilateral ground-glass or
consolidative CT scan changes secondary to COVID-19, rather than levels of MDD. This may
be explained by the fact that many other conditions can also increase D-Dimer such as
disseminated intravascular coagulation, deep vein thrombosis and infection, which could thus
be leading to high rates of PE false positives amongst COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, not
all patients with raised D-dimers would have had CT-scans to investigate for PE, especially if
it was deemed futile and the patient was palliative.

We finally investigate the impact of obesity alongside of MADA and MCRP7 levels on NCPE.
Table 21 illustrates the conditional probabilities of NCPE given various configurations of
interest of MADA and MCRP7 levels for obese and non-obese patients. It can be concluded
that there is a strong association (70%) between the presence of NCPE and MADA <30, as
well as MCRP7 >100, for the non-obese patients. If the patient is obese, MADA <30 seems to
be more influential in contributing towards the risk of NCPE, as opposed to MCRP7 > 100.

4. Discussion
In this study, in addition to quantifying the significance of feature-selected risk factors, we
showcase the use of Bayesian Networks to accurately predict four different COVID-19
inpatient outcomes: inpatient mortality (IPD), maximum level of oxygen or ventilatory
requirement (MOoVS), duration of inpatient COVID-19 treatment (ADT), and new confirmed
diagnoses of pulmonary embolism (NCPE), all whilst using a relatively small sample-size. The
models can predict these outcomes using different combinations of readily available clinical
data which serve as the independent predictor variables, whilst also accounting for
interdependency between these variables.
Various COVID-19 prognostic indicators have been described in the literature, such as
neutrophil: lymphocyte ratio, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), age, gender, ethnicity, oxygen
saturation on admission, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, malignancy, obesity and COPD [39].
However, drawing insights from this information is impeded by the lack of clarity as to the
relative influence each of these indicators has on mortality. In the clinical setting, patients often
present with different combinations of these risk factors and biomarkers. Consequently,
weighing them all up in order to allocate scarce healthcare resources can be challenging. This
highlights a role for a predictive, quantitative risk-stratification tool. Our model has been
constructed so that it can utilize data at first clinical presentation, for example, in the emergency
department, but also after 3 days, and 7 days of inpatient treatment. This can allow clinicians
to risk stratify at different time-points during an inpatient stay. In addition, our model can also
predict the duration of inpatient COVID-19 treatment and maximum level of oxygen
requirement that a patient may need during their inpatient stay. This may aid emergency
physicians with the decision as to whether to admit a patient to hospital and avoid failed
discharges, but also medical physicians with the decision as to whether to refer to ICU prior to
a patient’s clinical deterioration. The predicted duration of inpatient COVID-19 treatment can
be especially useful for bed managers in orchestrating patient flow which is essential to prevent
the growing problem of hospital acquired COVID-19 secondary cross-contamination [40].
Furthermore, within the context of hospitals which have reached their maximum ITU capacity,
by using our predictive model to identify high-risk patients earlier on in their disease course,
clinicians can transfer these high-risk patients to neighbouring hospitals prior to their clinical
deterioration.
One of the major strengths of our machine learning based predictive model is that it can predict
4 outcomes. This increases the amount of clinical utility that can be offered to guide clinical
decision making. Secondly, this data set has incorporated 44 different variables from 355
patients who all received the primary study outcomes, reducing the risk of confounding error
and selection bias. Another strength of this study is that data extraction was conducted and
checked manually by trained medical physicians rather than by using coding. It has been well
documented that hospital clinical coding is still not entirely accurate within the UK [41,42] and
therefore insights drawn from national databases may be prone to significant information bias
and thus systematic error. Furthermore, it has now been estimated that the sensitivity of the
SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab is likely to be 50-75% [43–47]. This has created

a huge global problem in diagnosing and identifying COVID-19 patients, especially because
not all patients exhibit symptoms [48–52]. To overcome this issue, the cohort of patients with
COVID-19 who had negative RT-PCR swabs but positive CT scan imaging (n=55) were also
included in this study.
The biggest limitation to our study is that since the study was conducted in a single centre, not
only is the n number limited, but the data only reflects the demographics of the surrounding
population. Within the UK, geographical location and socio-economic factors are heavily
influencing death rates [53] and, thus, our data may have limited generalizability to the wider
UK population by not accounting for these factors. Furthermore, our data has only been
collected from hospital inpatients and therefore our model is not generalizable to the wider
community either. Secondly, data was not always available, or accurate, for all patients. This
was sometimes due to a lack of documentation, usually if the attending physicians at the time
did not deem the information relevant, or if the information was not available, especially in
patients who were cognitively impaired without any next of kin to provide collateral histories.
Moreover, not all investigations, such as CT scans, were required for every patient and may
have not been done due to the limited resources available in the NHS. Subsequently, only
patients deemed to have abnormal results would have been the patients to receive the
investigation. Also, with regards to palliation, some patients clearly had different treatment
goals to others. For example, this would suggest that patients with severe COVID-19 who could
have had ventilatory support may have not had it because their treatment goal was palliation
instead. All these factors together introduce information bias secondary to data measurement.
Finally, although most parameters were objectively documented on the electronic patient
record system, some data, such as ethnicity, was self-reported by patients thus also introducing
a modest element of recall bias.

5. Conclusion
Overall, our findings demonstrate reliable, multivariable predictive models for 4 outcomes, that
utilize readily available clinical information for COVID-19 adult inpatients. The models, if
provided with more training data, have the potential to be refined even further. Future research
is required to externally validate our models and demonstrate their utility as clinical decisionmaking tools.
