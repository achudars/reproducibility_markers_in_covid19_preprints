Abstract

24

Cognitive improvement after critical illness is complex. Neuro-stimulants are used to speed up physical

25

and mental processes through the increase in arousal, and wakefulness. In this case series, we reviewed

26

the literature and described the effect of modafinil for wakefulness in a cohort of adult patients admitted

27

to our COVID and non-COVID intensive care unit (ICU) between January 2017 and June 2020. A total of 8

28

patients included; 3 admitted to COVID-19, 4 surgical, and 1 transplant ICU. Obstructive sleep apnea was

29

noted in 2 (25%), 2 patients (25 %) had an initial neuroimaging that showed hemorrhagic stroke, and 1

30

(12.5%) showed ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic transformation. Modafinil 100-200 mg daily was

31

started for a median duration of 4 days and the median initiation time in relation to ICU admission was 11

32

(IQR 9-17) days. Glasgow coma Scale improvement was noted on 5 patients (62.5%). The median duration

33

of mechanical ventilation was 17.5 (IQR 15-31.75) days, and the median ICU stay was 28.5 (IQR 20.25-48)

34

days. All-cause mortality rate was 25 % at 28 days and 62.5 % at 90 days. Modafinil prevented

35

tracheostomy in 1 COVID-19 patient. No significant adverse drug reactions were documented. In our case

36

series, we described our experience for modafinil use for wakefulness in ICU ventilated patients including

37

COVID-19 patients. Based on our observations, the known effects of modafinil, and its safety profile, it

38

holds the potential to facilitate recovery from cognitive impairment. Larger studies are warranted to fully

39

evaluate its role for this indication.

1. Introduction

50

Intensive care unit (ICU) patients are susceptible to neurocognitive and musculoskeletal complications

51

because of various factors, such as the nature of critical illness, medications, over-sedation, and pain [1].

52

Moreover, sleep disruption in ICUs remains an elusive and pervasive problem. The 2018 pain, agitation/ sedation,

53

delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption (PADIS) guidelines included a brief overview of risk factors contributing

54

to disrupted sleep quality (e.g., architecture, fragmentation, sleep quality score), quantity (e.g., latency, and

55

duration), or circadian rhythm in ICUs [2,3]. Additionally, clinical experience from severe acute respiratory

56

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) suggests its neuro-invasive potential [4-6]. Approximately 36.4%

57

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) inpatients in a Wuhan hospital exhibited neurological signs and/or

58

symptoms during infection [7]. Manifestations included delirium, confusion, executive dysfunction, anosmia,

59

stroke, headache, Guillain Barr√© syndrome (GBS), Miller Fisher syndrome, encephalitis, acute necrotizing

60

encephalopathy, myelitis and CNS demyelinating lesions [7,8]. Moreover, critical illness polyneuropathy and ICU-

61

acquired weakness have been observed in 25-46% of ICU patients. Duration of ventilation, corticosteroid

62

administration, multi-organ dysfunction, sepsis, hyperglycemia, and renal replacement therapy have all been

63

correlated with ICU-acquired weakness [9-11]. However, their incidence is unknown in patients with SARS-CoV-

64

2 infection. Case reports of critical-illness polyneuropathy and/or myopathy are rare in patients with SARS-CoV-

65

1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), which can be attributed to the low number of correlation

66

studies between these illnesses and the prolonged ICU stay [12,13].

67

Early mobilization of these patients has become the standard of care; however, somnolent, fatigued, and

68

depressed patients may not be able or willing to comply and may have a delayed recovery [3]. Neuro-stimulants

69

are used to speed up the physical and mental processes through the increase of dopamine, serotonin,

70

norepinephrine, and acetylcholine. This in turn translates to improved neuro-cognition, enhanced arousal,

71

wakefulness, attention, memory, mental, and motor processing speed [14]. Although, the prescribing trends of

72

neuro-stimulants are yet to be fully elucidated, their use is increasing in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients

73

especially those with coma, vegetative state (VS), or minimally conscious state (MCS). Neuro-stimulants are

74

sometimes prescribed for off label use, to help in arousal and promote wakefulness in ICUs. The clinical rationale

75

is to facilitate transition from VS, and increase participation in physiotherapy and ambulation, thereby,

76

decreasing ICU-related complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and ICU-acquired delirium, while

77

facilitating self-expression, accelerating recovery, hastening liberation from the ventilatory support, and

78

decreasing ICU length of stay. Selected neuro-stimulants use in neuro-ICU are summarized at Table S1 [14-25].

79

Modafinil is approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea,

80

and shift work sleep disorder. Although the mechanism of action of modafinil remains uncertain, its cognition

81

enhancing properties are attributed to the modulation of glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and

82

alpha1B noradrenergic receptors while it has minimal effect on serotonin [26]. Modafinil also offers several

83

advantages over other conventional neuro-stimulants as it does not exhibit the same level of sympathomimetic

84

effects, such as behavioral excitation or rebound hypersomnolence, suggesting that its mechanism of action is

85

distinct. It also has a minimal potential for abuse, and does not appear to disrupt normal sleep architecture. Its

86

favorable safety profile makes it an attractive agent for use in critically ill patients. Side effects include insomnia,

87

anxiety, and cataplexy. At our institution, modafinil is approved for improving wakefulness in adults with

88

excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) associated with narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia, shift work sleep

89

disorder and as an adjunctive therapy for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)/hypopnea syndrome. Prescribing

90

privilege is restricted to neurologists, psychiatrists, and sleep medicine consultants. The efficacy of modafinil on

91

wakefulness has been studied in TBI and post-stroke patients [17, 27-32] [Table 1]. In ICU setting, a case series

92

by Gajewski and colleagues demonstrated clinical improvement after the start of modafinil therapy in 3 non-

93

intubated ICU patients [31]. A retrospective cohort study by Yoonsun et al evaluated whether modafinil improved

94

cognitive function for ICU patients by promoting wakefulness [32]. A total of 60 patients required ventilatory

95

support at a 336-bed community hospital were included. Modafinil resulted in small, nonsignificant increase in

96

Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) by 0.34 points after controlling for age, baseline severity of illness, and changes in

97

sedation and analgesia over time (95% CI, ‚àí0.34 to 0.73 points; p = 0.0743). There was a reduction in exposure

98

to sedatives and analgesics after modafinil was started, resulting in an increasing trend of GCS over time. No

99

major adverse effects were observed. The authors concluded that modafinil did prove beneficial in promoting

100

wakefulness in ICU patients. Its impact on overall patient outcomes in the ICU remains unclear and needs further

101

investigation. In order to gain insight on modafinil use for wakefulness in ICU, we reviewed the literature,

102

described 8 patients, and provided additional clinical data about COVID-19 cases admitted to the ICU. Our aim to

103

describe the clinical characteristics for patients who received modafinil to promote wakefulness and improve

104

cognition, and describe the median change in GCS before and after modafinil therapy. The author also sought to

105

describe the safety, ICU course, and outcomes including duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay

106

(LOS), hospital LOS, and all-cause of mortality rate.

2. Methods

108
109

2.1 Study design and setting:

110

This was an observational, retrospective, case series performed at a single tertiary care center King Faisal

111

Specialist Hospital and Research Centre (KFSH & RC), Riyadh, the primary referral center in Saudi Arabia. During

112

the COVID-19 pandemic, ICU units were expanded and approximately 1Ã¥ 41 COVID ICU beds were added, in

113

addition to approximately 4
Ã¥ 5 beds in non-COVID ICU units (medical, surgical, transplant/oncology ICUs). The

114

study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee and Clinical Research Committee. The patient's written

115

consent to publish was taken for each case included in the series. Data were collected and managed using

116

institutional Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap). The inclusion criteria were 1) ICU patients 18 years and

117

older 2) admitted to COVID and non-COVID units between January 2017 and June 2020 3) ICU stay for at least 48

118

h, 4) started on modafinil during ICU stay for at least 48 h, and 5) required ventilatory support. Those who did

119

not receive modafinil or received modafinil for indications other than ICU wakefulness were excluded. The CARE

120

(CAse REport) guidelines checklist was followed in describing each case included in this study [33]. The trial

121

registered retrospectively at clinical trial. gov [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04751227]

2.2 Variables and statistical approach:

124

Patient demographic data including ICU admission diagnosis, ICU type, comorbidities, and other ICU support

125

[tracheostomy, renal replacement therapy (RRT), steroids, COVID-19 treatment regimen, and vasopressors] were

126

obtained from the electronic medical record (EMR). The status of ventilator use before and after modafinil

127

administration, modafinil initiation time in relation to ICU admission, dose and duration of treatment were also

128

recorded. Severity of illness was evaluated using Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Acute

129

Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHEII) scores. The worst value for baseline laboratory tests was

130

chosen. These data were collected within the first 24 h after admission to the ICU. If that data were not available,

131

then data closest to admission were recorded. Work up for decreased level of consciousness (LOC) was recorded

132

including metabolic abnormalities, neuroimaging [brain computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance

133

imaging (MRI)], electroencephalogram (EEG), lumbar puncture, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. The

134

findings of nerve conduction studies (NCS), electromyography (EMG), and other complications during ICU stay

135

were documented. The GCS 48 h before and 168 h (7 days) after modafinil therapy, ICU LOS, hospital LOS,

136

discharge disposition, duration of mechanical ventilation, and mortality rate were recorded. We defined

137

responders for GCS change as a 2 points increase from baseline post modafinil initiation up to 7 days. Duration

138

of mechanical ventilation was recorded as the number of calendar days from intubation to extubation or until

139

ICU discharge, or death whichever occurs first. All-cause mortality rate was reported at 28 and 90 days. The

140

documentation in the EMR was reviewed to identify the patients started on antipsychotics and possible adverse

141

drug reactions (ADRs) related to modafinil including nervousness, agitation, delirium, hypersensitivity, and drug

142

rash. Naranjo scale was used to evaluate the causality of ADRs and modafinil therapy [34].

143

Continuous variables were presented as mean ¬± standard deviation (SD) or median (interquartile range [IQR]) as

144

appropriate, and categorical variables were presented as number and frequency (%). The changes in GCS was

145

examined graphically over time. Owing to the retrospective and exploratory nature of this case series, no sample

146

size justification is provided. Instead we wish to report all the patients meeting the inclusion criteria which might

147

be useful to other researchers who may want to combine these results with their own in a meta-analytic

148

approach. Descriptive statistical analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics, windows version 25.0 (IBM

149

Corp., Armonk, NY).

Results

151

3.1.

Patient characteristics

152

A total of 8 patients who met the inclusion criteria were described in this case series. The demographics and clinical

153

characteristics are summarized in Table 2. The median patient age was 76 (IQR 64.75-80.25 ) years, 7 (87.5 %)

154

were men, 3 (37.5%) admitted to COVID ICU, and 5 (62.5%) admitted to non-COVID ICU. Regarding the

155

comorbidities, OSA was noted in 2 (25%), and ischemic stroke in 2 (25%). The median SOFA and APACHE II scores

156

were 9.5 (IQR 7.25-11) and 27.5 (IQR 19.5- 33), respectively. The median time from ICU admission to modafinil

157

administration was 11 (IQR 9-17) days. Seven patients (87.5%) started on modafinil 100 mg orally every morning

158

while one patient received 200 mg daily for a median duration of 4 days [IQR 3.25-5]. The main indication for

159

modafinil initiation was decreased LOC and altered mental status that potentially preclude successful extubation

160

or liberation from mechanical ventilation. All patients received vasopressors during the ICU stay, and 5 patients

161

(62.5%) started on RRT for pre-existing chronic kidney disease or acute kidney injury. All COVID-19 patients were

162

treated according to our institution protocol for antivirals and immunomodulatory therapies for possibility of

163

cytokine storm. One patient received 5 days of IVIG as part of COVID-19 regimen (patient #1) and one patient

164

received it for possible GBS (patient #8).

hemorrhagic transformation; EEG was performed for 6 (75%) patients and none showed epileptic activity. The

170

cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was done in 4 patients (50%) and 3 patients showed evidence of nosocomial

1 patient (12.5%) for the critical illness myopathy ‚Äì neuropathy [patient # 8].

173

Complications arising in the ICU included intra-abdominal infections in 2 (25%) [patients # 4,8], Clostridium difficile

embolism in 1 (12.5%) [patient #2], disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in 1 (12.5%) [patient #2], heparin-

176

induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) in 1 (12.5%) [patient #2], and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and hemorrhagic

177

shock in 3 (37.5%) which required massive transfusion [patients # 2, 4,8].

increased initially after modafinil administration then remains unchanged after that. Patient # 2 and 7, no

184

improvement was noted in GCS after modafinil therapy.

and fraction of inspired oxygen (PO2/FiO2) prior to modafinil administration was 223.5 (IQR 175.75-265) which

187

changed slightly after administration, to a median of 195 (IQR 170-390). The median duration of mechanical

188

ventilation was 17.5 [IQR 15-31.75] days; 6 patients (75%) were alive after 28 days and 3 (37.5 %) were alive after

189

90 days. The median ICU stay was 28.5 (IQR 20.25-48) days, and the median hospital stay was 36.5 (IQR 26.75-

190

115.25) days. Tracheostomy was done in 5 patients (62.5%) and we were able to avoid it in one COVID-19 patient

4. Discussion

195

In our case series, we described our experience with modafinil for wakefulness in the critical care units including

196

COVID-19 patients at a tertiary care hospital. In majority of the cases, nonpharmacologic measures to

197

encourage a healthy sleep cycle were employed prior to modafinil initiation. Moreover, we addressed multiple

198

potential etiologies for altered mental status prior to modafinil initiation including primary CNS process,

199

metabolic derangements, hypoxemia or hypercarbia due to respiratory failure, renal or hepatic dysfunction,

200

nutritional deficiencies (e.g. thiamine) in patients with poor nutritional status, infection and sepsis induced

201

encephalopathy, medication effects [sedation required for prolonged intubation], EEG to rule out non-

202

convulsive seizure, lumbar puncture if the patient‚Äôs neurological findings were not explained by above studies,

203

and NCS to rule out neuromuscular disorders that could preclude successful extubation. Although we cannot

204

state with certainty that modafinil was the primary reason for improvement of cognition function, the temporal

205

relationship between starting modafinil and patients‚Äô improvement makes it a potential contributing factor.

206

The use of modafinil in a population with neurological findings had been examined before and summarized in

207

table 1 [27-32]. The first trial examined the efficacy of modafinil in treating fatigue and EDS in individuals with

208

TBI [27]. This was a single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial, where 53 participants were

209

randomly assigned to receive up to 400 mg of modafinil, or placebo. After adjusting for baseline scores and

210

period effects, there were no statistically significant differences between improvements seen with modafinil

211

212

Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) for daytime sleepiness, average changes were significantly greater with modafinil

213

than placebo at wk 4 (‚Äì1.2 ¬± 0.49; p = 0.02) but not at wk 10 (‚Äì0.5 ¬± 0.87; p = 0.56). Modafinil was safe and well

214

tolerated, although insomnia was reported significantly more often with modafinil than with placebo (p = 0.03).

215

Another trial in mild to severe TBI patients in ICU used lower dose of modafinil of 100-200 mg or placebo every

216

morning for 6 wk [28]. This prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study was aimed at

217

studying the effect of daily modafinil on post traumatic EDS and fatigue. The EDS improved significantly in

218

patients with TBI receiving modafinil treatment, compared to the placebo group. Modafinil, however, had no

219

impact on posttraumatic fatigue. Clinically relevant side effects were not observed.

220

A systematic review for amantadine and modafinil as neuro-stimulants during post‚Äëstroke care identified 12,620

221

publications including 12 modafinil publications (n = 120 patients) [17, 29, 30]. Modafinil was initiated 170 (17,

222

496) days post-stroke, with initial and final daily doses of 100 (100, 350) mg/day and 200 (100, 350) mg/day,

223

respectively. The most common indication was fatigue for modafinil (n = 5/12; 42%). Only 1 randomized study

224

analyzing the effect of modafinil (8%; n = 21 patients) on acutely hospitalized or ICU patients, witnessed

225

improvement in neurocognitive function. The authors concluded that modafinil may improve cognitive and

226

functional recovery post-stroke, but higher quality data are needed to confirm this conclusion, especially in the

227

acute care setting.

228

Focusing on ICU setting, Gajewski et al published a case series of 3 non-ventilated patients in thoracic surgery

229

ICU without a prior diagnosis of any sleep disorder and receiving a dose of 200 mg modafinil each morning [31].

230

The primary outcome was to expedite recovery through early rehabilitation. The 1st case was 77-year-old male

231

with a medical history of small non-cancerous lung cells who was readmitted for respiratory distress requiring

232

intubation, then extubated and continued to require intermittent noninvasive ventilation for dyspnea and he

233

was not participating in physical therapy due to hypersomnolence. He was prescribed 200 mg modafinil every

234

morning for 13 d. At day 2, he was weaned on 3-L nasal cannula and made advances in rehabilitation. The 2nd

235

case was a 67-year-old male with a medical history of esophageal cancer. He was admitted to ICU for

236

management of pneumonia and sepsis and received washouts for gastro-pleural fistula. After his initial surgery,

237

he was noted to be extremely fatigued and expressing wishes to withdraw care. Modafinil 200 mg every morning

238

was started and on day 2, the patient was more engaged in his care. No side effects were noted throughout the

239

8 days course. The 3rd case was a 70-year-old male with a medical history of esophageal cancer was admitted to

240

the ICU for respiratory failure which was improved and eventually extubated. His rehabilitative status was

241

complicated by his overall lack of energy, and his waxing and waning mental status. Modafinil was started at a

242

dose of 100 -200 mg. At day 6, the patient did not need his home lorazepam 1.5 mg at night and he engaged

243

more in his care. The author concluded that modafinil was beneficial in the ICU owing to its effects on improving

244

sleep efficiency, adjusting circadian sleep-cycle disruption, and decreasing EDS which subsequently reduce

245

delirium, improve day-time cognition, improve wakefulness, and facilitate engagement with physical therapy

246

and rehab. Compared to those findings, our observations suggested that modafinil improves cognition and

247

increases GCS in 5 (62.5%) patients in our series, suggesting it might be reasonable for promoting wakefulness

248

in ICU patients especially in mechanically ventilated patients which have not been described in the prior case

249

series [31]. Moreover, we included more diverse cohort from transplant, surgical, and COVID-19 ICUs which had

250

not been reported in the prior literature [31,32]. Mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients may require higher

251

doses of opioids and sedatives to mitigate ventilator-induced lung injury, and prevent self-extubation. Deep

252

levels of sedation may also require prior to initiation of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMB) in moderate-to-

253

severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [35]. All these factors could potentially delay the recovery of

254

neurocognitive function and increase risks of ICU acquired weakness particularly when corticosteroids are used

255

with aminosteroidal NMB [36]. However, clinicians should also be cognizant that COVID-19 patients are

256

predominately presented with hyperactive delirium, and agitation due to multiple factors including direct virus

257

invasion to CNS, prolonged mechanical ventilation, social isolation, and restricted family visitation [37].

258

Therefore, comprehensive assessment is warranted to identify those who might benefit from modafinil as

259

wakefulness agent prior to initiation of therapy. Moreover, the most common dose of modafinil that was used

260

in our series 100 mg oral once every morning with a median duration of 4 days and was fairly tolerated. Based

261

on published data, the usual dose of modafinil is 100-400 mg (starting dose 100-200 mg oral daily with a lower

262

dose recommended for patients with cardiovascular diseases and liver cirrhosis) [31, 32]. Therefore, a less ideal

263

response in term of GCS improvement was observed in patients # 2, 7, and 8 which might be due to inadequate

264

modafinil dose. Hence, a higher dose might be reasonable to use in these situations. Regarding the safety and

265

ADRs, we used the Naranjo scale for assessment of causality and a score of 0 to -1 indicated a doubtful causality

266

of ADRs and modafinil therapy in our series [34]. The ICU complications were most likely attributed to underlying

267

comorbidities.

268

Interestingly, modafinil prevented tracheostomy in one patient with COVID-19 (case 1) who was then

269

successfully extubated. A previous report showed that patients with COVID 19 who required prolonged

270

mechanical ventilation had a high mortality rate. Therefore, tracheostomy might be considered when prolonged

271

mechanical ventilation is anticipated [38]. On the other hand, studies showed that tracheostomy carries

272

significant risk of viral transmission to the healthcare workers [39]. Hence, preventing tracheostomy provided

273

advantages including shortening duration of critical care resource use (ventilators) and ICU length of stay during

274

COVID-19 outbreak, and minimizing aerosolization risks associated with this procedure for healthcare workers.

275

Furthermore, 2 patients (case # 5, and 7) has a neuroimaging that showed hemorrhagic stroke, 1 patient (case

276

#6) showed ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic transformation, a population which had not been assessed for

277

modafinil treatment in the prior literature [17, 27-32]. Moreover, 2 (25 %) of the patients (case #4, and 5) had

278

a history of OSA. We speculated that the observed improvements in cognition and GCS of these patients

279

possibly were related to enhanced nocturnal sleep based on the drug mechanism of action; however, further

280

evaluation is still needed. The 28 d all-cause mortality rate in our series was 2 (25 %) and 90 d all-cause mortality

281

rate was 5 (62.5%) and this is possibly expected as we are a tertiary care hospital. Therefore, it is likely that our

282

patients were sicker, as the APACHEII and SOFA scores suggest that these data were derived from a cohort of

283

critically ill patients. This is comparable to the mortality rate in patients admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis

284

and shock [40-42].

285

Our study limitations were small sample size, single institution experience, retrospective and observational in

286

nature, and lack of a control group which precludes causal interpretations. Similar to other observational

287

studies, our findings can be biased by confounding from unmeasured factors that influence cognitive function

288

and recovery such as the effect of physiotherapy and rehabilitation. It is also plausible that the increasing trend

289

in GCS over time was largely owing to the result of reduced exposure to other sedatives and analgesics and

290

spontaneous recovery. Moreover, patient-family interaction has a great impact in patient recovery as shown in

291

the recent report [43, 44]. In our series, the intensivist on service had the patient described in case 1 interact

292

with the patient‚Äôs family through video calling, which likely uplifted his spirit and played a potential role in his
12

293

recovery. Additionally, the small sample size prohibited us from performing statistical analysis to assess and

294

adjust for confounders or perform analysis of what factors might be associated with response or lack thereof.

295

This may have led to an overestimation or underestimation of modafinil effect for wakefulness in the critical

296

care unit [45]. As is always the case with observation type study, association does not prove causality, but there

297

are reasonable data showing that modafinil might have potential benefits when administered to certain critically

298

ill patients especially those who appear hypoactive, lethargic, and depressed and particularly when conservative

299

treatment has failed, which provides biological plausibility [17, 27-32]. Its daily cost is insignificant compared

300

with the high cost of an extended ICU stay although it is difficult to conclude from our experience that patients‚Äô

301

length of ICU stay was shortened. Nonetheless, we felt that it is important to report our experience to help

302

rationalize and understand the role of neurostimulants to promote arousal and wakefulness in the ICU which

303

subsequently facilitate self-expression, accelerate recovery, increase participation in physiotherapy and

304

ambulation, hastening liberation from the ventilatory support, and decrease ICU-related complications such as

305

DVT, and ICU-acquired delirium.

306

Based on our observations of these patients, the known effects of modafinil, its safety profile, and the published

307

experiences of others, we believe that modafinil might has potential benefits and that the consequences of

308

delayed patient recovery and a prolonged ICU stay may outweigh the risks of potential modafinil side effects.

309

Although we cannot state with certainty that modafinil improves cognition function and GCS in our series, it

310

seems that the timing of drug administration in concert with the putative benefits of the medication makes it a

311

plausible conclusion.

312

There are many unanswered questions that we believe would be a good starting point for a larger randomized

313

controlled trial to substantiate the ideal time of modafinil initiation, identify the population that most likely

314

benefit from therapy, define the optimal drug dose and duration, and identify the role of a combination therapy

315

and its impact on clinical outcomes. Future studies with appropriate sample size, adequate power are needed

316

to better describe its role in the ICU patients post hemorrhagic stroke. Additionally, the impact of modafinil

317

therapy on overall ICU outcomes, such as mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, and ICU length of stay

318

should be evaluated in future prospective studies. Lastly, further studies are needed to provide more insights

319

and understand modafinil use in critically ill COVID-19 patients. However, in this pandemic setting, evidence of

320

some physiological safety and possible benefit might be considered for hypothesis generation, as shown in our

321

series.

322

5. Conclusion

323

Cognitive improvement after critical illness is complex. In our case series, we reviewed the literature and

324

described our center‚Äôs experience for modafinil use for wakefulness in the ICU ventilated patients including

325

COVID-19 patients. Based on our observations of these patients, the known effects of modafinil, and its safety

326

profile, we believe that modafinil might has potential benefits when administered to certain critically ill patients

327

especially those who appear hypoactive, and lethargic after comprehensive assessment of potential etiologies

328

for altered mental status. Though our observations are intriguing, they result from uncontrolled, retrospective

329

chart review and confounding bias is likely which preclude definitive statements. Nevertheless, this initial

330

experience is promising and may provide preliminary evidence and hypothesis warrant to be assessed in

331

randomized controlled trials.
