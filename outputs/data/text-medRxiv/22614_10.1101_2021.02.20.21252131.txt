THE ASSOCIATION OF OPENING K-12 SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES
WITH THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 IN THE UNITED STATES:
COUNTY-LEVEL PANEL DATA ANALYSIS
VICTOR CHERNOZHUKOV, HIROYUKI KASAHARA, AND PAUL SCHRIMPF

Abstract. This paper empirically examines how the opening of K-12 schools and colleges
is associated with the spread of COVID-19 using county-level panel data in the United
States. Using data on foot traffic and K-12 school opening plans, we analyze how an
increase in visits to schools and opening schools with different teaching methods (in-person,
hybrid, and remote) is related to the 2-weeks forward growth rate of confirmed COVID19 cases. Our debiased panel data regression analysis with a set of county dummies,
interactions of state and week dummies, and other controls shows that an increase in visits
to both K-12 schools and colleges is associated with a subsequent increase in case growth
rates. The estimates indicate that fully opening K-12 schools with in-person learning is
associated with a 5 (SE = 2) percentage points increase in the growth rate of cases. We
also find that the positive association of K-12 school visits or in-person school openings
with case growth is stronger for counties that do not require staff to wear masks at schools.
These results have a causal interpretation in a structural model with unobserved county
and time confounders. Sensitivity analysis shows that the baseline results are robust to
timing assumptions and alternative specifications.

1. Introduction
Does opening K-12 schools and colleges lead to the spread of COVID-19? Do mitigation
strategies such as mask-wearing requirements help reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2
at school? These are important policy relevant questions. If in-person school openings
substantially increase COVID-19 cases, then local governments could promote enforcing
mitigation measures at schools (universal and proper masking, social distancing, and handwashing) to lower the risk of COVID-19 spread. Furthermore, the government could prioritize vaccines for education workers in case of in-person school openings. This paper uses
county-level panel data on K-12 school opening plans and mitigation strategies together
with foot traffic data to investigate how an increase in the visits to K-12 schools and colleges/universities is associated with a subsequent increase in the growth rates of COVID-19
cases in the United States.

Notes: (a)-(b) plot the evolution of weekly cases or deaths per 1000 persons averaged across counties within each
group of counties classified by K-12 school teaching methods and mitigation strategy of mask requirements against
the days since K-12 school opening. We classify counties that implement in-person teaching as their dominant
teaching method into “In-person/Yes-Mask” and “In-person/No-Mask” based on whether at least one school district
requires staff to wear masks or not. Similarly, we classify counties that implement hybrid teaching into
“Hybrid/Yes-Mask” and “Hybrid/No-Mask” based on whether mask-wearing is required for staff. We classify
counties that implement remote teaching as “Remote.” (c) and (d) plot the evolution of per-device visits to K-12
schools and full-time workplaces, respectively, against the days since K-12 school opening using the same
classification as (a) and (b).

We begin with simple suggestive evidence. Fig. 1 provides visual evidence for the association of opening K-12 schools with the spread of COVID-19 as well as the role of school
mitigation strategies. Fig. 1(a) and (b) plot the evolution of average weekly cases and
deaths per 1000 persons, respectively, against days since school opening across different
teaching methods as well as mask requirements for staff. In Fig. 1(a), the average number of weekly cases starts increasing after 2 weeks of opening schools in-person or hybrid,

especially for counties with no mask mandates for staff. This possibly suggests that mask
mandates at school reduce the transmissions of SARS-CoV-2. In Fig. 1(b), the number
of deaths starts increasing after 3 to 5 weeks of opening schools, especially for counties
that adopt in-person/hybrid teaching methods with no mask mandates. Alternative mitigation strategies of requiring mask-wearing to the student, prohibiting sports activities, and
promoting online instruction also appear to help reduce the number of cases after school
openings (see SI Appendix, Fig. S1(i)-(p)).
Fig. 1(c) shows that opening K-12 schools in-person or hybrid increases the number
of per-device visits to K-12 schools more than opening remotely, especially when no mask
mandates are in place. Fig. 1(d) and SI Appendix, Fig. S1(e)-(f) show that visits to
full-time and part-time workplaces increase after school openings with in-person teaching,
suggesting that the opening of schools allow parents to return to work. On the other hand,
we observe no drastic changes in per-device visits to restaurants, recreational facilities, and
churches after school openings (SI Appendix, Fig. S1(b)-(d)).
Fig. 2 and SI Appendix, Fig. S2 provide further descriptive evidence that opening colleges
and universities with in-person teaching lead to the spread of COVID-19 in counties where
the University of Wisconsin(UW)-Madison, the University of Oregon, the University of
Arizona, the Michigan State University, the Pennsylvania State University, the Iowa State
University, and the University of Illinois-Champaign are located.
What happened in Dane county, WI, is also illustrative. The left panel of Fig. 2 presents
the evolution of the number of cases by age groups, the number of visits to colleges and
universities, and the number of visits to bars and restaurants in Dane county, WI. The first
panel shows that the number of cases for age groups of 10-19 and 20-29 sharply increased
in mid-September while few cases were reported for other age groups. The second to
the fourth panels suggest that this sharp increase in cases among the 10-29 age cohort
in mid-September is associated with an increase in visits to colleges/universities, bars, and
restaurants in late August and early September. The fall semester with in-person classes at
the UW-Madison began on September 2, 2020, when many undergraduates started living
together in residential halls and likely visited bars and restaurants. This resulted in increases
in COVID-19 cases on campus; according to the letter from Dane County Executive Joe
Parisi to the UW-Madison Parisi (2020), nearly 1,000 positive cases were confirmed on the
UW-Madison campus by September 9, 2020, accounting for at least 74 percent of confirmed
cases from September 1 to 8, 2020 in Dane county.
While Fig. 1-2 as well as SI Appendix, Fig. S1-S2 are suggestive, the patterns observed
in them may be driven by a variety of confounders. Therefore, we analyze the effect of
opening K-12 schools and colleges/universities by panel data regression analysis with fixed
effects to capture unobserved confounding.
We conduct the analysis using county-level data in the United States. As an outcome variable, we use the weekly growth rate of confirmed cases approximated by the log-difference
in reported weekly cases over two weeks, where the log of weekly cases is set to be −1 when
we observe zero weekly cases. The main explanatory variables of interest are 2-weeks lagged

traffic data has the advantage over school opening data in that it provides more accurate
information on the actual visits to schools over time, possibly capturing unrecorded changes
in teaching methods and school closures beyond the information provided by MCH Strategic
Data. Furthermore, foot traffic data covers all counties while there is missing information
for some school districts in MCH Strategic Data, which may possibly cause sample selection
issues.
To investigate the role of mitigation strategies at school on the transmission of SARSCoV-2, we examine how the coefficients of K-12 school visits and K-12 school opening depend on the mask-wearing requirement for staff by adding an interaction term, for example,
between K-12 school visits and mask-wearing requirements for staff at schools.1
As confounders, we consider a set of county fixed effects as well as interaction terms
between state and week fixed effects to control for unobserved time-invariant county-level
factors as well as unobserved time-varying state-level factors. County fixed effects control
permanent differences across counties in unobserved personal risk-aversion and attitude
toward mask-wearing, hand washings, and social distancing. Interaction terms between
state dummy variables and week dummy variables capture any change over time in people’s
behaviors and non-pharmaceutical policy interventions (NPIs) that are common within a
state; they also control for changes in weather, temperature, and humidity within a state.
We also include county-level NPIs (mask mandates, ban gathering of more than 50 persons, stay-at-home orders) lagged by 2 weeks to control for the effect of people’s behavioral
changes driven by policies on case growths beyond the effect of state-level policies.2 Furthermore, the logarithm of past weekly cases with 2, 3, and 4 weeks lag lengths are included to
capture people’s voluntarily behavioral response to new information of transmission risks.
The growth rate of the number of tests recorded at the daily frequency for each state is also
added as a control for case growth regression.
Because the fixed effects estimator with a set of county dummies for dynamic panel
regression could be severely biased when the time dimension is short (Nickell, 1981), we
employ the debiased estimator by implementing bias correction (e.g., Chen, Chernozhukov,
and Fernández-Val, 2019). Our empirical analysis uses 7-day moving averages of daily
variables to deal with periodic fluctuations within a week. Our data set contains 3144
counties for regression analysis using foot traffic data but some county observations are
dropped out of samples due to missing values for school opening teaching methods and staff
1MCH Strategic Data provides the school district level data on whether each school district adopts the

following mitigation strategies: (i) mask requirements for staff, (ii) mask requirements for students, (iii)
prohibiting sports activities, and (iv) online instruction increases, among other measures. We decided to use
mask requirements for staff as the main variable for school mitigation strategy because it has a relatively
smaller number of missing values. For regression analysis with the mask requirement variable, we drop
counties from the sample when more than 50 percent of students in a county attend school districts of
which mask requirements for staff is unknown or pending. Similarly, for specification with different teaching
methods, we drop counties from the sample when more than 50 percent of students in a county attend school
districts of which teaching methods are unknown or pending.
2The decision to reopen schools in some states such as California and Oregon depended on trends in local
case counts or hospitalizations (Goldhaber-Fiebert, Studdert, and Mello, 2020).

mask requirements in some regression specifications.3 Our sample period is from April 1,
2020, to December 2, 2020. The analysis was conducted using R software (version 4.0.3).

Results
Table 1 reports the debiased estimates of panel data regression. Clustered standard
errors at the state level are reported in the bracket to provide valid inference under possible
dependency over time and across counties within each state. The results suggest that an
increase in the visits to K-12 schools and colleges/universities as well as opening K-12
schools with in-person learning mode is associated with an increase in the growth rates of
cases with 2 weeks lag when schools implement no mask mandate for staff.
In column (1), the estimated coefficient of per-device visits to colleges is 0.14 (SE =
0.07) while that of per-device visits to K-12 schools is 0.47 (SE = 0.07). The change in
top 5 percentile values of per-device visits to colleges/universities and K-12 schools between
June and September among counties are around 0.1 and 0.15, respectively, in SI Appendix,
Fig. S4(d)(e). Taking these values as a benchmark for full openings, fully opening colleges/universities may be associated with (0.14×0.1=) 1.4 percentage points increase in the
growth rates of cases while fully opening K-12 schools may have contributed to (0.47×0.15=)
7 percentage points increase in case growth rates. Column (3) indicates that openings of
K-12 schools with the in-person mode are associated with 5 (SE = 2) percentage point increases in weekly case growth rates. It also provides evidence that openings of K-12 schools
with remote learning mode are associated with a decrease in case growth, perhaps because
remote school opening induces more precautionary behavior to reduce transmission risk.
In column (2), the estimated coefficient of the interaction between K-12 school visits and
no mask-wearing requirements for staff is 0.24 (SE=0.07), providing some evidence that
mask-wearing requirements for staff may have reduced the transmission of SARS-CoV-2
at schools. Similarly, in column (4), the coefficients on the interaction of in-person and
hybrid school openings with no mask mandates are positively estimated as 0.04 (SE=0.02)
and 0.05 (SE=0.02), respectively. These estimates likely reflect not only the effect of maskwearing requirements for staff but also that of other mitigation measures. For example,
school districts with staff mask-wearing requirements frequently require students to wear
masks.
Other studies on COVID-19 spread in schools have also pointed to the importance of
mitigation measures. In contact tracing studies of cases in schools, Gillespie et al. (2021)
found that 6 out of 7 traceable case clusters were related to clear noncompliance with
mitigation protocols, and Zimmerman et al. (2021) found that most secondary transmissions
were related to absent face coverings. Hobbs et al. (2020) find that children who tested
positive for COVID-19 are considerably less likely to have had reported consistent mask use
by students and staff inside their school.
3Our regression analysis uses 2788 counties for specification with K-12 school opening with different

teaching modes while the sample contains 2204 counties for specification with mask requirements for staff.

OPENING K-12 SCHOOLS AND THE SPREAD OF COVID-19

Consistent with evidence from U.S. state-level panel data analysis in Chernozhukov,
Kasahara, and Schrimpf (2021), the estimated coefficients of county-wide mask mandate
policy are negative and significant in columns (1)-(4), suggesting that mandating masks
reduces case growth. The estimated coefficients of ban gatherings and stay-at-home orders
are also negative. The negatively estimated coefficients of the log of past weekly cases are
consistent with a hypothesis that the information on higher transmission risk induces people
to take precautionary actions voluntarily to reduce case growth. The table also highlights
the importance of controlling for the test growth rates as a confounder.
Evidence on the role of schools in the spread of COVID-19 from other studies is mixed.
Papers that focus on contract tracing of cases among students find limited spread from
student infections Zimmerman et al. (2021), Brandal et al. (2021), Ismail et al. (2020),
Gillespie et al. (2021), Falk et al. (2021), Willeit et al. (2021). There is also some evidence
that school openings are associated with increased cases in the surrounding community.
Bignami et al. (2021) provides suggestive evidence that school openings are associated with
increased cases in Montreal neighborhoods. Auger et al. (2020) use US state-level data to
argue that school closures at the start of the pandemic substantially reduced.
Two closely related papers also examine the relationship between schools and countylevel COVID-19 outcomes in the US. Goldhaber et al. (2021) examine the relationship
between schooling and cases in counties in Washington and Michigan. They find that inperson schooling is only associated with increased cases in areas with high pre-existing
COVID-19 cases. Similarly, Harris, Ziedan, and Hassig (2021) analyze US county-level
data on COVID-19 hospitalizations and find that in-person schooling is not associated with
increased hospitalizations in counties with low pre-existing COVID-19 hospitalization rates.
As discussed in SI Appendix, our regression specification is motivated by a SIRD model,
and the dependent variable in our analysis is case growth rates instead of new cases or
hospitalizations. Consistent with Goldhaber et al. (2021) and Harris, Ziedan, and Hassig
(2021), our finding of a constant increase in growth rates implies a greater increase in cases
in counties with more pre-existing cases.
We next provide sensitivity analysis with respect to changes to our regression specification
and assumption about delays between infection and reporting cases as follows:
(1) Baseline specifications in columns (1) and (2) of Table 1.
(2),(3) Alternative time lags of 10 and 18 days for visits to colleges and K-12 schools as
well as NPIs.
(4) Setting the log of weekly cases to 0 when we observe zero weekly cases to compute
the log-difference in weekly cases for outcome variable.
(5) Add the log of weekly cases lagged by 5 weeks and per-capital cumulative number
of cases lagged by 2 weeks as controls.
(6) Add per-device visits to restaurants, bars, recreational places, and churches lagged
by 2 and 4 weeks as controls.
(7) Add per-device visits to full-time and part-time workplaces and a proportion of
devices staying at home lagged by 2 weeks as controls.
(8) All of (5)-(7).

Notes: Dependent variable is the log difference in weekly positive cases across 2 weeks. Regressors are 7-days
moving averages of corresponding daily variables and lagged by 2 weeks to reflect the time between infection and
case reporting except that we don’t take any lag for the log difference in test growth rates. All regression
specifications include county fixed effects and state-week fixed effects to control for any unobserved county-level
factors and time-varying state-level factors such as various state-level policies. The debiased fixed effects estimator is

OPENING K-12 SCHOOLS AND THE SPREAD OF COVID-19

9

Because the actual time lag between infection and reporting cases may be shorter or
longer than 14 days, we consider the alternative time lags in (2) and (3). Specification (4)
checks the sensitivity of handling zero weekly cases to construct the outcome variable of the
log difference in weekly cases.
A major concern for interpreting our estimate in Table 1 as the causal effect is that a
choice of opening timing, teaching methods, and mask requirements may be endogenous.
Our baseline specification mitigates this concern by controlling for county-fixed effects,
state-week fixed effects and the log of past cases but a choice of school openings may be still
correlated with time-varying unobserved factors at the county-level. Therefore, we estimate
a specification with additional time-varying county-level controls in (5)-(8).
Fig. 3(a) takes column (1) of Table 1 as a baseline specification and plots the estimated
coefficients for visits to colleges and K12 schools with the 90 percent confidence intervals
across different specifications using the debiased estimator; the estimates using the standard
estimator without bias correction are qualitatively similar and reported in SI Appendix, Fig.
S3. The estimated coefficients of K-12 school visits and college visits are all positive across
different specifications, suggesting that an increase in visits to K-12 schools and colleges
is robustly associated with an increase in case growth. On the other hand, the estimated
coefficients often become smaller when we add more controls. In particular, relative to
the baseline, adding full-time/part-time workplace visits and staying home devices leads to
somewhat smaller estimated coefficients for both K-12 school and college visits, suggesting
that opening schools and colleges is associated with people returning to work and/or going
outside more frequently.
In Fig. 3(b), the estimated interaction term of K-12 school visits and no mask-wearing
requirements for staff in column (2) of Table 1 are all positive and significant, robustly
indicating a possibility that mask-wearing requirement for staff may have helped to reduce
the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at schools when K-12 schools opened with the in-person
teaching method.

Association between School Openings and Mobility. As highlighted by a modeling
study for the United Kingdom (Panovska-Griffiths et al., 2020), there are at least two
reasons why opening K-12 schools in-person may increase the spread of COVID-19. First,
opening K-12 schools increases the number of contacts within schools, which may increase
the risk of transmission among children, parents, education workers, and communities at
large. Second, reopening K-12 schools allow parents to return to work and increase their
mobility in general, which may contribute to the transmission of COVID-19 at schools and
workplaces.
To give insight on the role of reopening K-12 schools for parents to return to work and
to increase their mobility, we conduct panel data regression analysis by taking visits to
full-time workplaces and a measure of staying home devices as outcome variables and use
a similar set of regressors as in Table 1 but without taking 2 weeks time lags.

Table 2(a) shows how the proportion of devices at full-time workplaces and that of staying
home devices are associated with visits to K-12 schools as well as their in-person openings.
In columns (1) and (2), the estimated coefficients of per-device K-12 school visits and
opening K-12 schools for full-time work outcome variables are positive and especially large
for in-person K-12 school opening. Similarly, the estimates in columns (3) and (4) suggest
the negative association of per-device K-12 school visits and opening K-12 schools with the
proportion of devices that do not leave their home. This is consistent with a hypothesis
that opening K-12 school allows parents to return to work and spend more time outside.
This result may also reflect education workers returning to work.
Table 3 presents regression analysis similar to that in Table 1 but including the proportion
of devices at full-time/part-time workplaces and those at home as additional regressors,
which corresponds to specification (7) in Fig. 3. The estimates indicate that the proportion
of staying home devices is negatively associated with the subsequent case growth while the
proportion of devices at full-time workplaces is positively associated with the case growth.
Combined with the estimates in Table 2(a), these results suggest that school openings may
have increased the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by encouraging parents to return to work
and to spend more time outside. This mechanism can partially explain the discrepency
between our findings and various studies that focus on cases among students. Contract
tracing of cases in schools, such as Falk et al. (2021), Zimmerman et al. (2021), Willeit
et al. (2021), Brandal et al. (2021), and Ismail et al. (2020), often finds limited direct
spread among students. On the other hand, Vlachos, Hertegård, and B. Svaleryd (2021)
finds that parents and teachers of students in open schools experience increases in infection
rates.
In columns (1)-(2) of Table 3, the estimated coefficients on K-12 school visits remain
positive and large in magnitude even after controlling for the mobility measures of returning
to work and being outside home which are mediator variables to capture the indirect effect
of school openings on case growth through its effect on mobility. The coefficient on K-12
school visits are approximately 75% as large in Table 3 as in Table 1. This suggests that
within-school transmission may be the primary channel through which school openings
affect the spread of COVID-19.
One likely reason why college openings may increase cases is that students go out for bars
(KA et al., 2020; Chang et al., 2021), where properly wearing masks and practicing social
distancing are difficult. Table 2(b) presents how visits to restaurants and bars are associated
with colleges/universities from panel regressions using per-device visits to restaurants and
bars as outcome variables. These results indicate that bar visits are positively associated
with college visits, consistent with a hypothesis that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 may
be partly driven by an increase in visits to bars by students.
Death Growth Regression. Many county-day observations report zero weekly deaths in
our data set (SI Appendix, Table S4 and Fig. S4(4)). We approximate the weekly death
growth rate by the log difference in weekly deaths, where the log of weekly deaths is replaced
with −1 when we observe zero weekly deaths. We also consider an alternative measure of
death growth rates by replacing the log of weekly deaths by 0 for zero weekly deaths. For

death growth regression, we use the sub-sample of larger counties by dropping 10 percent of
the smallest counties in terms of their population size for which zero weekly death happens
more frequently.
Fig. 4 illustrates the estimated coefficients of visits to colleges and K-12 schools across
different specifications for death growth regressions. SI Appendix, Table S3 presents the
estimates of death growth regression under baseline specification with a time lag of 21 days.4
Fig. 4(a) shows that the coefficient of visits to colleges and K-12 schools are positively
estimated for (1) baseline, (3) an alternative time lag of 35 days, (4) an alternative measure
of death growth, and adding more controls in (5)-(8), providing evidence that an increase
in visits to colleges and K-12 schools is positively associated with the subsequent increase
in weekly death growth rates. The magnitude of the estimated coefficient of K-12 school
visits becomes smaller when the time lag is set to 28 days in (2). Fig. 4(b) shows that the
association of K-12 school visits with death growth is stronger when no mask mandate for
staff is in place.

Limitations. Our study has the following limitations. First, our study is observational
and therefore should be interpreted with great caution. It only has a causal interpretation
in a structural model under exogeneity assumptions that might not hold in reality (see
the Model and Method in SI Appendix). While we present sensitivity analysis with a
variety of controls including county dummies and interactions of state dummies and week
dummies, the decisions to open K-12 schools and colleges/universities may be endogenous
and correlated with other unobserved time-varying county-level factors that affect the spread
of COVID-19. For example, people’s attitudes toward social distancing, hand-washing, and
mask-wearing may change over time (which we are not able to observe in the data) and their
changes may be correlated with school opening decisions beyond the controls we added to
our regression specifications.
Our analysis is also limited by the quality and the availability of the data as follows.
The reported number of cases is likely to understate true COVID-19 incidence, especially
among children and adolescents because they are less likely to be tested than adults given
that children exhibit milder or no symptoms.5 County-level testing data is not used because
of a lack of data although state-week fixed effects control for the weekly difference across
counties within the same state and we also control daily state-level test growth rates.
Because foot traffic data is constructed from mobile phone location data, the data on K12 school visits likely reflects the movements of parents and older children who are allowed
4The time lag of 21 days is taken as a baseline to take into account the time lag of infection and death
reporting but we also report the estimates for the time lag of 28 and 35 days in specifications (2) and
(3). These choices of time lags are motivated by the numbers reported in Table 2 of https://www.cdc.
gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html. For the age group above 65, the days from
exposure to onset range up to 6 days; the interquartile range of days from symptom onset to death is given
by 8 and 21 days; the interquartile range of days from death to reporting is 5 and 44 days.
5This is consistent with CDC data which shows the lower testing volume and the higher rate of positive
test among children and adolescents than adults (Leidman et al., 2021).

to carry mobile phones to schools and excludes those of younger children who do not own
mobile phones.6
Because COVID-infected children and adolescents are known to be less likely to be hospitalized or die from COVID, the consequence of transmission among children and adolescents
driven by school openings crucially depends on whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2
from infected children and adolescents to the older population can be prevented.7 Our
analysis does not provide any empirical analysis on how school opening is associated with
the transmission across different age groups due to data limitations.8 Vlachos, Hertegård,
and B. Svaleryd (2021) show that teachers in open schools experience higher COVID-19
infection rates compared to teachers in closed schools. They also show that this increase in
infection rate also occurs in partners of teachers and parents of students in open schools,
albeit to a lesser degree.
The impact of school openings on the spread of COVID-19 on case growth may be different
across counties and over time because it may depend not only on in-school mitigation
measures but also on contact tracing, testing strategies, and the prevalence of community
transmissions (Goldhaber-Fiebert, Studdert, and Mello, 2020; Ziauddeen et al., 2020). We
do not investigate how the association between school openings and case growths depends
on contact tracing and testing strategies at the county-level.
The result on the association between school opening and death growth in Fig. 4 is suggestive but must be viewed with caution because the magnitude of the estimated coefficient
of K-12 school visits is sensitive to the assumption on the time lag from infection to death
reporting. The time lag between infection and death is stochastic and spreads over time,
making it difficult to uncover the relationship between the timing of school openings and
subsequent deaths. Furthermore, while we provide sensitivity analysis for how to handle
zero weekly deaths to approximate death growth, our construction of the death growth
outcome variable remains somewhat arbitrary.
Finally, our result does not necessarily imply that K-12 schools should be closed. Closing
schools have negative impacts on children’s learning and may cause declining mental healths
among children. The decision to open or close K-12 schools requires careful assessments of
the cost and the benefit.

6We also focus on limited Points-Of-Interest: K-12 schools, colleges and universities, restaurants, drinking
places, other recreational places including gyms, and churches. We check the robustness by including visits
to assisted living facilities for the elderly as well as nursing care facilities as additional controls but the
results are not sensitive to their inclusion.
7In the meta-analysis of 54 studies on the household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Madewell et al. (2020),
estimated household secondary attack rate to child contacts was 16.8%. Miyahara et al. (2021) reports that
household secondary attack rate from children and adolescence to other family members was 23.8% and
higher than other age groups in Japan.
8CDC collects the data on the number of reported cases by age groups from each state whenever such
data is available. However, for many counties, the reported cases by age groups are missing or there exists a
substantial gap between the sum of cases across different age groups reported by CDC and the total number
of cases reported in NYT case data (see, for example, the case of Ingham, MI, in SI Appendix, Fig. S2).

Materials and Methods
Data. Cases and the deaths for each county are obtained from the New York Times. SafeGraph provides foot traffic data based on a panel of GPS pings from anonymous mobile
devices. Per-device visits to K-12 schools, colleges/universities, restaurants, bars, recreational places, and churches are constructed from the ratio of daily device visits to these
point-of-interest locations to the number of devices residing in each county. Full-time and
part-time workplace visits are the ratio of the number of devices that spent more than 6
hours and between 3 to 6 hours, respectively, at one location other than one’s home location to the total number of device counts. Staying home device variable is the ratio of the
number of devices that do not leave home locations to the total number of device counts.
MCH Strategy Data provides information on the date of school openings with different
teaching methods (in-person, hybrid, and remote) as well as mitigation strategies at 14703
school districts. We link school district-level MCH data to county-level data from NYT
and SafeGraph using the file for School Districts and Associated Counties at US Census
Bureau. School district data is aggregated up to county using the enrollment of students
at the district level. Specifically, we construct the proportion of students with different
teaching methods for each county-day observation using the district level information on
school opening dates and teaching methods. We also construct a county-level dummy
variable of “No mask requirement for staff” which takes a value of 1 if there exists at least
one school district without any mask requirement for staff and 0, otherwise. Our regressors
are 7 days moving averages of these variables. A substantial fraction of school districts
report “unknown” or “pending” for teaching methods and mask requirements. We drop
county observations for which more than 50 percent of students attend school districts that
report unknown or pending for teaching methods or mask requirements when these variables
are included in regressors.
NPIs data on stay-at-home orders and gathering bans is from Jie Ying Wu Killeen et al.
(2020) while the data on mask policies is from Wright et al. (2020). These NPI data contain
information up to the end of July; in our regression analysis, we set the value of these policy
variables after August to be the same as the value of the last day of observations. Cases by
age groups for Fig. 2 is from CDC. SI Appendix, Tables S5-S6 present summary statistics
and correlation matrix. Fig. S4. presents the evolution of percentiles of these variables over
time.

Methods. Our research design closely follows Chernozhukov, Kasahara, and Schrimpf
(2021). Fig. 5 is a causal path diagram for our model that describes how policies, behavior, and information interact together:
• The forward health outcome, Yi,t+` , is determined last after all other variables have
been determined;
• The policies, Pit , affect health outcome Yi,t+` either directly, or indirectly by altering
human behavior Bit , which may be only partially observed;

• Information variables, Iit , such as lagged values of outcomes can affect human behavior and policies, as well as outcomes;
• The confounders Wit , which vary across counties and time, affect all other variables;
these include unobserved but estimable county, time, state, state-week effects.
The index i denotes the county i, and t and t + ` denotes the time, where ` represents the
time lag between infection and case confirmation or death. Our health outcomes are the
growth rates in Covid-19 cases and deaths and policy variables include school reopening in
various modes, mask mandates, ban gathering, and stay-at-home orders, and the information variables include lagged values of outcome (as well as other variables described in the
sensitivity analysis).
The causal structure allows for the effect of the policy to be either direct or indirect.
For example, school openings not only directly affect case growth through the within-school
transmission but also indirectly affect case growth by increasing parents’ mobility. The
structure also allows for changes in behavior to be brought by the change in policies and
information. The information variables, such as the number of past cases, can cause people
to spend more time at home, regardless of adopted policies; these changes in behavior, in
turn, affect the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Our measurement equation will take the form:
0
∆ log(∆Cit ) = Xi,t−14
θ + δT ∆ log(Tit ) + it ,

where i is county, t is day, ∆Cit is weekly confirmed cases over 7 days, Tit is the number
of tests over 7 days, ∆ is a 7-day differencing operator, it is an unobserved error term.
Xi,t−14 collects other behavioral, policy, and confounding variables, where the lag of 14
days captures the time lag between infection and confirmed case (see MIDAS (2020)). In
SI Appendix, we relate this specification to the SIRD model.

their interactions with mask requirements for staff. As confounders, Xi,t−14 includes a set
of county dummies and a set of all interaction terms between state dummies and week
dummies. We also consider 2, 3, and 4 weeks lagged log values of weekly cases as well as
three NPI policy variables. The growth rate of tests, ∆ log(Tit ), is captured by the observed
growth rate of tests at state-level as well as interaction terms between state dummy variables
and week dummy variables. The standard errors are computed by clustering at the statelevel, where its rationale is that the county-level stochastic shocks may be correlated across
counties especially within the state.
Our specification effectively contains the lagged dependent variables in a set of regressors
because the log of past weekly cases with different lag lengths can be transformed into the
log-differences of past weekly cases. Our model is a dynamic panel regression model in
which the fixed effects estimator with a set of county dummies may result in the Nickell
bias (Nickell, 1981). To eliminate the bias, we construct an estimator with bias correction
as follows.
Given our panel data with sample size (N, T ), denote a set of counties by N = {1, 2, ..., N }.
We randomly and repeatedly partition N into two sets as N1j and N2j = N \ N1j for
j = 1, 2, ..., J, where N1j and N2j (approximately) contain the same number of counties. For
each of j = 1, ..., J, consider two sub-panels (where i stands for county and t stands for the
day) defined by Sj1 = Sj11 ∪ Sj22 and Sj2 = Sj12 ∪ Sj21 with Sj1k = {(i, t) : i ∈ Nk , t ≤ dT /2e}
and Sj2k = {(i, t) : i ∈ Nk , t ≥ bT /2 + 1c} for k = 1, 2, where d.e and b.c are the ceiling and
floor functions. We form the estimator with bias correction as

where βb is the standard estimator with a set of N county dummies while βeSj ∪Sj denotes the

estimator using the data set Sj1 ∪Sj2 but treats the counties in Sj1 differently from those in Sj2
to form the estimator— namely, we include approximately 2N county dummies to compute
βeSj ∪Sj . We choose J = 2 in our empirical analysis.9 We report asymptotic standard errors

with state-level clustering, justified by the standard asymptotic theory of bias-corrected

2. Supplementary Information Appendix
The Model and Methods.
The Structural Causal Model. Our approach draws on the framework presented in our previous paper Chernozhukov, Kasahara, and Schrimpf (2021). Here we summarize the approach
for completeness, highlighting the main difference (here we do not assume that all relevant
social distancing behavioral variables are observed).
We begin with a qualitative description of the model via a causal path diagram shown
in Figure 6, which describes how policies, behavior, and information interact together:
• The forward health outcome, Yi,t+` , is determined last, after all other variables have
been determined;
• The adopted vector of policies, Pit , affect health outcome Yi,t+` either directly, or
indirectly by altering individual distancing and other precautioanry behavior Bit ,
which may be only partially observed;
• Information variables, Iit , such as lagged values of outcomes and other lagged observable variables (see robustness checks) can affect human behavior and policies,
as well as outcomes;
• The confounding factors Wit , which vary across counties and time, affect all other
variables; these include unobserved though estimable county, time, state, state-week
effects.
The index i denotes observational unit, the county, and t and t + ` denotes the time, where
` represents the typical time lag between infection and case confirmation or death.

and stay-at-home orders, and the information variables include lagged values of outcome
(as well as other variables described in the sensitivity checks).
The role of behavioral variables in the model is two-fold. First, the presence of these variables in the model requires us to control for the information variables – even when information variables affect outcomes only through policies or behavior. In this case conditioning
on the information blocks the backdoor path (see, Pearl (2009)) creating confounding

Yi,t+` ←− Bit ←− Iit −→ Pit .
Therefore conditioning on the information is important even when there is no direct effect
Iit −→ Yi,t+` . This observation motivates our main dynamic specification below, where
information variables include lagged growth rates and new cases or new deaths per capita.
Second, while not all behavioral variables may be observable, we can still study as the matter
of supporting analysis, the effects of policies on observed behavioral variables (the portion of
time in workplace, restaurants, and bars) and of behavioral variables on outcomes, thereby
gaining insight as to whether policies have changed private behavior and to what extent
this private behavior changed the outcomes (for the analysis, of early pandemic data in this
vein, see our previous paper).
The causal structure allows for the effect of the policy to be either direct or indirect.
The structure also allows for changes in behavior to be brought by the change in policies
and information. These are all realistic properties that we expect from the context of
the problem. Policies such as closures and reopenings of schools, closures or reopening of
non-essential business, and restaurants, affect the behavior in strong ways. In contrast,
policies such as mandating employees to wear masks can potentially affect the Covid-19
transmission directly. The information variables, such as recent growth in the number of
cases, can cause people to spend more time at home, regardless of adopted policies; these
changes in behavior, in turn, affect the transmission of Covid-19.
The causal ordering induced by this directed acyclical graph is determined by the following timing sequence:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)

information and confounders get determined at t,
policies are set in place, given information and confounders at t;
behavior is realized, given policies, information, and confounders at t;
outcomes get realized at t+` given policies, behavior, information, and confounders.

The model also allows for direct dynamic effects of information variables on the outcome
through autoregressive structures that capture persistence in growth patterns. We do not
highlight these dynamic effects and only study the short-term effects (longer-run effects get
typically amplified; see our previous paper Chernozhukov, Kasahara, and Schrimpf (2021)
for more details.)

Our quantitative model for causal structure in Figure 6 is given by the following econometric structural equation model:
Yi,t+` (b, p, ι) :=α0 b + π 0 p + µ0 ι + δY0 Wit + εyit ,
0
:=β 0 p + γ 0 ι + δB
Wit + εbit ,

Bit (p, ι)
Pit (ι)

:=p(η

0

(SEM)

ι, Wit , εpit ),

which is a collection of structural potential response functions (potential outcomes), where
the stochastic schocks are decomposed into an observable part δ 0 W and unobservable part
ε. Lower case letters ι, b and p denote the potential values of information, behavior, and
policy variables. The restrictions on shocks are described below.
The observed outcomes, policy, and behavior variables are generated by setting ι = Iit
and propagating the system from the last equation to the first:
Yi,t+` :=Yi,t+` (Bit , Pit , Iit ),
Bit

:=Bit (Pit , Iit ),

Pit

:=Pit (Iit ).

The orthogonality restrictions on the stochastic components are as follows: The stochastic
shocks εyit and εpit are centered and furthermore,
εyit

⊥ (εbit , Pit , Wit , Iit ),

εbit

⊥ (Pit , Wit , Iit ),

εpit

⊥
⊥

(O)

(Wit , Iit ),

where we say that V ⊥ U if EV U = 0. This is a standard way of representing restrictions
on errors in structural equation modeling. The last equation states that variation in policies
is exogenous conditionally on confounders and information variables.
The system above together with orthogonality restrictions (O) implies the following collection of stochastic equations for realized variables:
Yi,t+` = α0 Bit + π 0 Pit + µ0 Iit + δY0 Wit + εyit ,

εyit ⊥ Bit , Pit , Iit , Wit

0
Bit = β 0 Pit + γ 0 Iit + δB
Wit + εbit ,

εbit ⊥ Pit , Iit , Wit

(BPI→Y)
(PI→B)

As discussed below, the information variable includes case growth. Therefore, the orthogonality restriction εyit ⊥ Pit holds if the government does not have knowledge on future
case growth beyond what is predicted by the information set and the confounders; even
when the government has some knowledge on εyit , the orthogonality restriction may hold if
there is a time lag for the government to implement its policies based on εyit .
We stress that our main analysis does not require all components of Bit to be observable.
Main Implication. The model stated above implies the following projection equation:

OPENING K-12 SCHOOLS AND THE SPREAD OF COVID-19

Yi,t+` = a0 Pit + b0 Iit + c0 Wit + ε̄it ,

ε̄it ⊥ Pit , Iit , Wit ,

25

(PI→Y)

where
a0 := (α0 β 0 + π 0 ),

b0 := (α0 γ 0 + µ0 ),

0
c0 := (α0 δB
+ δY0 )

This follows immediately from plugging equation (PI → B) to equation (BPI → Y) and
verifying that the composite stochastic shock ε̄it obeys the orthogonality condition stated
in (PI→Y).
The main parameter of interest is the structural causal effect of the policy:
a0 = (α0 β 0 + π 0 ).
It comprises direct policy effect π 0 as well as the indirect effect α0 β 0 , realized by the policy
changing observed and unobserved behavior variables Bit . This coefficient a and b can
estimated directly using the dynamic panel data methods described in more detail below.
As additional analysis, we can estimate the determinants for the observed behavioral
mobility measures– the observed part of Bit .

Identification and Parameter Estimation. The orthogonality equations imply that the main
equation is the projection equation, and parameters a and b are identified if Pit and Iit have
sufficient variation left after partialling out the effect of controls:
Ỹi,t+` =a0 P̃it + c0 I˜it + ε̄it , ε̄it ⊥ P̃it , I˜it ,

(1)

where Ṽit = Vit −Wit0 E[Wit Wit0 ]− E[Wit Vit ] denotes the residual after removing the orthogonal
projection of Vit on Wit . The residualization is a linear operator, implying that (1) follows
immediately from the above. The parameters of (1) are identified as projection coefficients
in these equations, provided that residualized vectors have non-singular variance matrix:
Var(P̃it0 , I˜it0 ) > 0.

(2)

Our main estimation method is the fixed effects estimator, where the county, state, stateweek effects are treated as unobserved components of Wit and estimated directly from the
panel data, so they are rendered (approximately) observable once the history is sufficiently
long. The stochastic shocks {εit }Tt=1 are treated as independent across states and can be
arbitrarily dependent across time t within a state. In other words, the standard errors will
be clustered at the state level. When histories are not long, substantial biases emerge from
cit of Wit (known as the Nickel bias (Nickell, 1981)) and
working with the estimated version W
they need to be removed using debiasing methods. In our context, debiasing changes the
magnitudes of the original biased fixed effect estimator but does not change the qualitative
conclusions reached without any debiasing.

Formulating Outcome and Key Confounders via SIR model. Letting Cit denote
the cumulative number of confirmed cases in county i at time t, our outcome
Yit = ∆ log(∆Cit ) := log(∆Cit ) − log(∆Ci,t−7 )

(3)

approximates the weekly growth rate in new cases from t − 7 to t.10 Here ∆ denotes the
differencing operator over 7 days from t to t − 7, so that ∆Cit := Cit − Ci,t−7 is the number
of new confirmed cases in the past 7 days.
We chose this metric as this is the key metric for policymakers deciding when to relax
Covid mitigation policies. The U.S. government’s guidelines for state reopening recommend
that states display a “downward trajectory of documented cases within a 14-day period”
(White House, 2020). A negative value of Yit is an indication of meeting these criteria for
reopening. By focusing on weekly cases rather than daily cases, we smooth idiosyncratic
daily fluctuations as well as periodic fluctuations associated with the days of the week.
Our measurement equation for estimating equations (BPI→Y) and (PI→Y) will take the
form:
0
∆ log(∆Cit ) = Xi,t−14
θ + δT ∆ log(Tit ) + it ,

(M-C)

where i is county, t is day, Cit is cumulative confirmed cases, Tit is the number of tests over
7 days, ∆ is a 7-days differencing operator, it is an unobserved error term. Xi,t−14 collects
other behavioral, policy, and confounding variables, depending on whether we estimate
(BPI→Y) or (PI→Y), where the lag of 14 days captures the time lag between infection and
confirmed case (see MIDAS (2020)). Here
∆ log(Tit ) := log(Tit ) − log(Ti,t−7 )
is the key confounding variable, derived from considering the SIR model below. We describe
other confounders in the empirical analysis section.
Our main estimating equation (M-C) is motivated by a variant of SIR model, where we
add confirmed cases and infection detection via testing. Let S, I, R, and D denote the
number of susceptible, infected, recovered, and dead individuals in a given state. Each of
these variables are a function of time. We model them as evolving as
S(t)
β(t)I(t)
N
S(t)
İ(t) =
β(t)I(t) − γI(t)
N
Ṙ(t) = (1 − κ)γI(t)
Ṡ(t) = −

Ḋ(t) = κγI(t)

(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)

where N is the population, β(t) is the rate of infection spread, γ is the rate of recovery or
death, and κ is the probability of death conditional on infection.
10We may show that log(∆C ) − log(∆C
it
i,t−7 ) approximates the average growth rate of cases from t − 7

to t.

Confirmed cases, C(t), evolve as
Ċ(t) = τ (t)I(t),

(8)

where τ (t) is the rate that infections are detected.
Our goal is to examine how the rate of infection β(t) varies with observed policies and
measures of social distancing behavior. A key challenge is that we only observed C(t) and
D(t), but not I(t). The unobserved I(t) can be eliminated by differentiating (8) and using
(5) as
S(t)

τ̇ (t)

β(t) − γ +

We consider a discrete-time analogue of equation (9) to motivate our empirical specification
by relating the detection rate τ (t) to the number of tests Tit while specifying S(t)
N β(t) as a
linear function of variables Xi,t−14 . This results in

Our measurement equation for the growth rate of deaths is based on equation (10) but

where
∆ log(∆Dit ) := log(∆Dit ) − log(∆Di,t−7 )

approximates the weekly growth rate in deaths from t − 7 to t in state i. Sensitivity analysis
also provides results for the case of 28 and 35 lag.
Debiased Fixed Effects Dynamic Panel Data Estimator. We apply Jackknife bias
corrections; see Chen et al. (2020) and Hahn and Newey (2004) for more details. Here, we
briefly describe the debiased fixed effects estimator we use.
Given our panel data with sample size (N, T ), denote a set of counties by N = {1, 2, ..., N }.
We randomly and repeatedly partition N into two sets as N1j and N2j = N \ N1j for
j = 1, 2, ..., J, where N1j and N2j (approximately) contain the same number of counties. For

each of j = 1, ..., J, consider two sub-panels (where i stands for county and t stands for the
day) defined by
Sj1 = Sj11 ∪ Sj22 and Sj2 = Sj12 ∪ Sj21
with Sj1k = {(i, t) : i ∈ Nk , t ≤ dT /2e} and Sj2k = {(i, t) : i ∈ Nk , t ≥ bT /2 + 1c} for k = 1, 2,
where d.e and b.c are the ceiling and floor functions. Each of these two subpanels, Sj1 and
Sj2 , includes observations for all cross-sectional units and time periods.
We form the estimator with bias-correction as
J
1Xe
βbBC := 2βb − βe with βe :=
βSj ∪Sj ,
2
1
J
j=1

where βb is the standard estimator with a set of N county dummies while βeSj ∪Sj denotes

the estimator using the data set Sj1 ∪ Sj2 but treats the counties in Sj1 differently from those
in Sj2 to form the estimator— namely, we include approximately 2N county dummies to
e is the approximation to the bias of β,
b subtracting which
compute βeSj ∪Sj . Thus, (βb − β)
1
2
from βb gives the formula given above. We set J = 2 in our empirical analysis. When we
choose J = 5 for some specifications, we obtained similar results.
P
An alternative jacknife bias-corrected estimator is βbCBC = 2βb − J1 Jj=1 (βeSj + βeSj )/2,
1
2
where βe j denotes the fixed effect estimator using the subpanel Sj for k = 1, 2. In our
Sk

k

empirical analysis, these two cross-over jackknife bias corrected estimators give similar result; in simulation experiments, the first form performed somewhat better, so we settled
out choice on it.
We report asymptotic standard errors with state-level clustering, justified by the standard
asymptotic theory of bias corrected estimators. The rationale for state-level clustering is
that the stochastic shocks in the model can be correlated across counties, especially within
the state. A simple way to model this is to allow for the arbitrary within-state correlation
and adjust the standard errors to account for this (state-level clustering).

Notes: Dependent variable is the log difference in weekly positive cases across 2 weeks. Regressors are 7-day moving
averages of corresponding daily variables and lagged by 2 weeks to reflect the time between infection and case
reporting except that we don’t take any lag for the log difference in test growth rates. All regression specifications
include county fixed effects and state-week fixed effects to control for any unobserved county-level factors and
time-varying state-level factors such as various state-level policies as well as 2, 3, and 4 weeks lagged log of cases.
The standard fixed effects estimator without bias-correction is applied. Asymptotic clustered standard errors at the
state level are reported in the bracket. ∗ p<0.1; ∗∗ p<0.05; ∗∗∗ p<0.01

Notes: (a)-(h) plot the evolution of corresponding variables in the title before and after the day of school openings
and corresponding to figures reported in Fig. 1(c)(d) in the main text. (i)-(p) corresponds to Fig.(a)(b) and plot the
evolution of weekly cases or deaths per 1000 persons averaged across counties within each group of counties classified
by K-12 school teaching methods and different mitigation strategies (mask requirements for students, mask
requirements for staffs, allowing for sports activities, and increase in online instructions) against the days since K-12
school opening. In (i) and (m), counties that implement in-person teaching are classified into “In-person/Yes-Mask”
and “In-person/No-Mask” based on whether at least one school district requires students to wear masks or not. In
(k) and (o), counties that implement in-person teaching are classified into “In-person/Yes-Sports” and
“In-person/No-Sports” based on whether at least one school district requires students to allow sports activities or
not. In (l) and (p), counties that implement in-person teaching are classified into “In-person/No-Online” and
“In-person/Yes-Online” based on whether at least one school district answer that no increase in online instruction.
(q)-(x) are similar to (i)-(p) but classify counties by the volume of per-device K-12 school visits and take the
calendar dates instead of the days since opening schools as x-axis, where ”Low,” ”Middle,” and ”High” are
county-day observations of which 14 days lagged per-device K-12 school visits less than the first quartile, between
the first and the third quartiles, and larger than the third quartile, respectively. In (q) and (u), ”Low/No-Mask,”
”Middle/No-Mask,” and ”High/No-Mask” are a subset of low, middle, and high visits groups of counties for which
at least one school district does not require students to wear masks.

Notes: Figure corresponds to Fig. 2 in the main text but for Pima, AZ, Ingham, MI, Centre, PA, Story, IA, and
Champaign, IL. Across various counties, we also report the evolution of visits to recreation facilities and K-12 school
visits. The last panel at the bottom compares the sum of weekly cases across all age groups reported in CDC
dataset with the weekly reported case in NYT dataset.

Notes: Dependent variable is the log difference in weekly reported deaths across 2 weeks. Regressors are 7-day
moving averages of corresponding daily variables and lagged by 3 weeks to reflect the time between infection and
case reporting. All regression specifications include county fixed effects and state-week fixed effects to control for any
unobserved county-level factors and time-varying state-level factors such as various state-level policies. The debiased
fixed effects estimator is applied. Asymptotic clustered standard errors at the state level are reported in the bracket.
Estimates are based on the sample of counties after dropping the smallest 10 percent in population sizes because the
number of reported deaths is zero for many observations in small counties. ∗ p<0.1; ∗∗ p<0.05; ∗∗∗ p<0.01
