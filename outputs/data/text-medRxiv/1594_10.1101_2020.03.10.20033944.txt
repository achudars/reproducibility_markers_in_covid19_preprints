Abstract
The outbreak of COVID-19 become enormous threat to human beings, showing
unclear virus mutation during dissemination. We found, in our 788 confirmed
COVID-19 patients, the decreased rate of severe/critical type, increased liver/kidney
damage and prolonged period of nuclear acid positivity, when compared with Wuhan.
To investigate underlining mechanisms, we isolated one strain of SARS-CoV-2 (ZJ01)
in mild COVID-19 patient and found the existence of 35 specific gene mutation by
gene alignment. Further phylogenetic analysis and RSCU heat map results suggested
that ZJ01 may be a potential evolutionary branch of SARS-CoV-2. We classified 54
strains of viruses worldwide (C/T type) based on the base (C or T) at positions 8824
and 28247. ZJ01 has both T at those sites, becoming the only TT type currently
identified in the world. The prediction of Furin cleavage site (FCS) and the sequence
alignment of virus family indicated that FCS may be an important site of coronavirus
evolution. ZJ01 had mutations near FCS (F1-2), which caused changes in the structure
and electrostatic distribution of S protein surface, further affecting the binding
capacity of Furin. Single cell sequencing and ACE2-Furin co-expression results
confirmed that Furin level was higher in the whole body, especially in glands, liver,
kidney and colon while FCS may help SARS-CoV-2 infect these organs. The
evolutionary pattern of SARS-CoV-2 towards FCS formation may result in its clinical
symptom becoming closer to HKU-1 and OC43 (the source of FCS sequence-PRRA)
caused influenza, further showing potential in differentiating into mild COVID-19
subtypes.

Introduction
The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and its infected Disease
(COVID-19) in Wuhan since the end of 2019 and quickly spreading over the whole
country, has put severe threat on public health and economic retardation to China1, 2.
Through quick response and drastic measures even including quarantining Wuhan city
on Jan 23, 2020, the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 was effectively controlled.
Nevertheless, its ensuing global sporadic appearance3,

4

and quick dissemination in

Japan, South Korea, Iran and Italy raised world alert of SARS-CoV-2 pandemics5, 6, 7.
Therefore, it is urgent to continuingly illustrate the clinical and virological
characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 during its dissemination.
An important and common feature of virus is that its increased transmissibility
usually accompanies with decreased virulence, which also holds true for
SARS-CoV-2 and is reflected in the disease trajectory. On one hand, COVID-19 was
more severe in Wuhan at its early stage, reaching approximately 32% of
severe/critical types and 11% of fatality8, 9. In contrast, data out of Wuhan showed
more mild type of COVID-19, as presented in Zhejiang province10 and nationwide11.
On the other hand, its transmissibility was increased from varied basic reproductive
number (R0) of 2.212 and 2.686 based on Wuhan data to that of 3.7713 in national level.
Furthermore, the observation of similar viral load between COVID-19 patients with
and without symptoms revealed its capacity of occult transmission14.
It is well acknowledged that change in the epidemiological and clinical features of

COVID-19 roots from virological change of SARS-CoV-2, in which its spike (S)
surface envelope protein plays an important role15. Generally, its surface unit (S1) is
responsible for host entry by binding to cell receptor while its transmembrane unit (S2)
takes charge of the fusion of viral and cellular membranes16. Therefore, it is of great
value to focus on the sequence mutation and conformation change in S protein for
SARS-CoV-2 evolution in a finely established model, aiming to explain the related
change of COVID-19.
In this study, we identified 9.9% severe/critical type in 788 confirmed COVID-19
patients of Zhejiang province and median 11 days of positive nuclear acid in 104
patients from our hospital, showing the tendency of COVID-19 progression towards
mild but more infective direction. Based on these clinical findings, we performed
in-depth bioinformatics analysis by comparing the virological features of previously
reported 52 strains of SARS-CoV-2, including Bat coronavirus, SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan and ZJ01 (SARS-CoV-2 we firstly reported in one patient
with mild COVID-19 in Zhejiang province). We demonstarated that the specific
mutation of ZJ01 may represent a de novo evolution trend of SARS-CoV-2, which
might be related with Furin. Besides, the establishment of a novel SARS-CoV-2
categorization system may facilitate our understanding of virus evolution and its
influence on disease severity and progression.

features of COVID-19 in designated hospitals of Zhejiang province between Jan 17
and Feb 7, 2020 was performed, followed by calculating the period of positive nuclear
acid of COVID-19 in our hospital. All patients were diagnosed as COVID-19
according to WHO interim guidance17. and the preliminary data were reported to the
authority of Zhejiang province. The study was approved by the Clinical Research
Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang
University (NO. IIT20200005C). Written informed consent was waived by the ethics
commission of the designated hospital, as this study was carried out for emerging
infectious disease and to be part of a continuing public health outbreak investigation
under national authorization. The subtypes of COVID-19 were categorized into mild,
severe and critical, as recently reported11. The period of positive nuclear acid is
defined as the date of confirmed nuclear acid positivity minus the date of confirmed
nuclear acid negativity.
Procedure and virus strain collection
SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed from samples of throat-swab and sputum in our
hospital and local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) of Zhejiang
province, by real-time RT-PCR8. All patients received chest x-rays or CT scan on
admission, with excluding other respiratory viruses such as influenza A (H1N1, H3N2,
H7N9), influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The
epidemiological, anthropometrical, clinical and laboratory data were collected on
admission, with specific attention paid to the period between symptom onset and
outpatient visiting/PCR confirmation/hospital admission. One strain of SARS-CoV-2

was successfully isolated from the sputum of COVID-19 patient with mild type in our
hospital, followed by whole genome sequencing with previously reported method18.
Sequence data collection and alignment of SARS-CoV-2
Current available coronavirus sequences (n=85) were collectively achieved from
NCBI viral genome database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, n=65), Genome
Warehouse (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/gwh/, n=12), CNGBdb (https://db.cngb.org/, n=3)
and NMDC (http://nmdc.cn/#/coronavirus, n=6). Sequence of ZJ01 (BataCov/Zheji
ang/ZJ01/2019) was provided according to our sequencing result. The 52 sequences
of SARS-CoV-2 were collected from China (n = 30), Japan (n = 5), Nepal (n = 1),
South Korea (n = 1), Australia (n =1), Finland (n=1) and United States of America
(n = 13). The collection period was between December 26, 2019 and February 5,
2020. The Furin protein sequence was downloaded from NCBI. Multiple sequence
alignment of all coronavirus genomes was performed by using MEGA v7.0.26.
Phylogenetic and Relative synonymous codon usage analysis
Phylogenetic analysis was performed on a total of 80 coronavirus strains,
covering 6 species (human, bat, mink, camel, rat and pig). The source of SARSCoV-2 comes from 17 cities in 7 countries, with periods between virus outbreak
and dissemination (2019.12.23-2020.2.5). The evolutionary history was constructed
based on the S protein of coronavirus by Neighbor-Joining method. The bootstrap
consensus tree inferred from 2000 replicates was taken to represent the
evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed. Branches corresponding to partitions
reproduced in less than 30% bootstrap replicates were collapsed. The evolutionary

distances were computed using the Kimura 2-parameter method and were in the
units of the number of base substitutions per site. Evolutionary analyses were
conducted in MEGA7 v7.0.26. Relative Synonmous Codon Usage (RSCU) analysis
was applied to compare the differences between 49 strains of SARS-CoV-2 and
Homo, with further heat map drawing by MeV 4.9.0. All available coding
sequences (minimum>28 kbp) were calculated with Codon W1.4.2.16, followed by
inter-relationship calculation based on Euclidean distance method.
Mutation site analysis and FCS prediction
SimPlot v.3.5.1.15 was used to analyze the potential genetic recombination. The
visualization of the mutation site between RATG13 and ZJ01 was performed by
Multalin (http://multalin.toulouse.inra.fr/multalin/multalin.html). Multiple sequence
alignment was applied by using the Muscle (codons) function of MEAG v7.0.26.
Genetic mutation sites were analyzed by DNAMAN v9.0.1.116. The visualization of
the functional domain distribution of SARS-CoV-2 and S proteins was plotted by IBS
v1.0.3. The FCS prediction was carried out in ProP 1.0 Server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/
services/ProP/)19 and presented as Furin score (range 0-1), where the closer to 1, the
higher possibility of having FCS.
Homology modeling and APBS analysis
Target protein was downloaded from NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
protein/1791269092) and corresponding homology models were predicted by
SWWISS-MODEL(https://swwassmodel.expasy.org/). Protein sequences alignment

and Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solve (APBS) analysis were performed by
PyMOL v2.3.3 on Intel i7 9700F processor. APBS was calculated and evaluated by
PyMOL v2.3.3, as previously reported20.
Single cell transcriptome data analysis
The raw counts or processed data were download from Tissue Stability Cell Atlas
(https://www.tissuestabilitycellatlas.org/),

Gene

Expression

Omnibus

(GEO;

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Lung, colon and liver data were respectively obtained
from Tissue Stability Cell Atlas21, GSE11622222 and HCA23, including samples of 5
lung, 3 colonic epithelium and 5 hepatic tissues from healthy volunteers and organ
donors. Lung and liver data had been processed before downloading, and directly
used for data analysis and visualization. For liver data, cells with less than 100
expressed genes and 1500 UMI counts and higher than 50% mitochondrial genome
transcript were removed. Genes expressed in less than three cells were also removed.
Normalization and principal component analysis were performed in the R
package Seurat24, with different datasets based data processing methods. For liver,
the first 40 principal components resulted in principal component analysis were

used to perform cell clustering and non-linear dimensionality reduction (Uniform
Manifold Approximation and Projection, UMAP). For colon, R package Harmony25
was used to remove batch effects with default settings. Then we used first 40
components resulted in harmony to perform cell clustering and nonlinear dimensionality reduction as same as liver data. Depending on the expression

scRNA-seq datasets, we further estimate which cell types the cell clusters belong to.
Annotated clusters were then visualized using UMAP plots with “DimPlot”
function in Seurat. Normalized gene expression levels were presented in the UMAP
and violin plots by R package ggplot226.

Results
Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 788 enrolled COVID-19
patients and ZJ01 patient
As shown in Table 1, 51.65% of the 788 enrolled patients were male, with low
rate of smoking (6.85%). The top three co-existing conditions were hypertension
(15.99%), diabetes (7.23%) and chronic liver disease (3.93%). The median period
from illness onset to outpatient visiting, PCR confirmation and hospital admission
were 2, 4 and 3 days, respectively. The most common symptoms were fever
(80.71%) and cough (64.21%) while the highest rate of CT/X-ray manifestation
was bilateral pneumonia (37.56%). The rates of mild, sever and critical types of
COVID-19 were 90.1%, 7.74% and 2.16%, respectively. The ZJ01 patient is male,
30y, and had neither smoking history nor any co-existing condition. He visited
outpatient clinics 1 day after symptom onset and was admitted in hospital
confirming with COVID-19 in the same day by PCR test. He had no exposure
history to Wuhan and none of his family members was reported to be virus positive
till now. Consistent with other COVID-19 patients, he had the symptoms of fever,
cough and sputum production, with CT image showing bilateral pneumonia. This

patient was categorized into mild type of COVPD-19, with normal blood routine
test and examination of inflammation marker (CRP and PCT). The higher level of
ALT and serum creatinine in this patient indicated potential liver and kidney injury.
Unusually, the period of continuing positive nuclear acid was 24 days, longer than
most patients reported from Wuhan27.

Phylogenetic and RSCU analyses revealed potential evolutionary divergence in
SARS-CoV-2 and the unique feature of ZJ01
Phylogenetic analysis suggested that SARS, RATG13 and SARS-CoV-2
exhibited remarkable evolutionary divergence, with potential evolutionary branches
within SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 1A). For instance, there existed minor evolutionary
divergence

between

and

MT0270641 (2020-1-29)/ZJ01(2020-1-23) that were respectively collected in the
early and widely spread stages of the epidemic, indicating the potential of forming
evolutionary branches during dissemination. The relative synonymous codon usage
(RSCU) analysis showed that there were various differences among 8 strains
(MN938384, CNA0007334, WIV06, ZJ01, NMDC60013002-05, CNA0007332,
MN988668, WIV07) and other members of SARS-CoV-2 family (Fig 1B), where
MN938384, CNA0007334, WIV06 and ZJ01 were the closest to human RSCU.
Among aforementioned 8 strains which were collected in Wuhan, Guangdong and
Hangzhou, six were collected at the early stage of COVID-19 (2019-12-26 to 2020

Figure 1. The existence of potential evolutionary divergence in SARS-CoV-2 family. (A),
Phylogenetic analysis indicates that SARS and SARS-CoV-2 are totally separated branches in
evolution while ZJ01 may be a representative of a potential evolutionary subtype of the
SARS-CoV-2 family. (B), RSCU heatmap indicates that 8 strains of SARS-CoV-2 family are more
close to human RSCU, differing from other strains. The RSCU of ZJ01 might be one representative
of potential branches.

Sequence alignment analysis identified ZJ01 as a novel viral pattern of
SARS-CoV-2
The whole sequence of ZJ01 was deposited in Appendix. Sequence alignment
analysis suggested that ZJ01 had 38 mutation sites compared with other
SARS-CoV-2 family members (Fig 2A), in which 35 mutations were unique to
ZJ01, including 7 deletions, 4 insertions and 24 substitutions. For the rest 3

mutation sites, NO.20 was caused by a sequencing error while NO.14 and No. 38
widely existed in SARS-CoV-2 family. Among ZJ01 unique mutations, 10
(NO.22-31) were located on the S protein, including 3 samesense mutation, 2
deletion mutation and 5 missense mutation, which led to amino acid changes of
Ser596, Gln613, Glu702, Ala771, Ala1015, Pro1053 and Thr1066. Further
similarity analysis indicated that the main difference among various coronaviruses
located in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) region of S1. Intriguingly, the
differences between ZJ01 and other members of SARS-CoV-2 mainly resided in in
the S1/S2 and S2 (Fig 2B).
Further analysis showed the significant association of gene mutation between
nucleotide positions 8824 and 28247 in SARS-CoV-2 family (Fig 3A). In detail,
when the 8824 was T, its corresponding 28247 was C and vice versa. This pattern
was confirmed in 52 out of 54 (96.3%) strains of SARS-CoV-2 and the only two
exceptions were from ZJ01 (8824T/28247T) and MN988713 (8824Y/28247Y),
where Y meant C or T. Interestingly, Bat coronavirus RATG13 (currently most
similar to SARS-CoV-2) and Pangolin coronavirus MP789 (suspicious intermediate
host of SARS-CoV-2) both had 8824C/28247T. There were near 20,000 base

largest possibility was that certain strain of SARS-CoV-2 carrying 8824C/28247T

had a mutation in early stage of dissemination, becoming 8824T/28247C. Those
two ancestor strains kept replication during virus spreading and forming their own
cladistics (Fig 3B). Though it is still unclear whether the appearance of
8824T/28247C happened in intermediate host stage or human infection stage, we
speculated that SARS-CoV-2 kept mutation in human transmission and formed the
specific strain of ZJ01 (8824T/28247T).
We proposed a novel categorization system for SARS-CoV-2, and defined type C
for 8824C, type T for 8824T and type TT for ZJ01 as a special case, respectively.
According to this system, we further categorized 54 strains of SARS-CoV-2-related
virus (Fig 3C). We found 83.3% and 95.7% T type in China (n=30) and Wuhan
(n=23); 60% and 100% C type in Japan (n=5) and Tokyo (n=3); 53.8% C type in
the USA (n=13), 83.3% T type in California (n=6) and 100% C type in Washington
D.C (n=3). Intriguingly, of two cases from Illinois, one was T type and the other
was named as Y type for Y in both nucleotide positions 8824 and 28247 , indicating
the possibility of co-infection with both T and C types. Furthermore, TT type was
only reported in Hangzhou. Whether this is an occasional single mutated strain or a
novel potential subtype of SARS-CoV-2 warrant more in-depth virological analysis
in the future.

Figure 2. The mutations of ZJ01 when comparing with other strains of SARS- CoV-2 by
sequence alignment. (A), ZJ01 has a large number of base mutations far above average while some
mutations are unique for ZJ01 and appears across every structural domain. Among them, 10 base
mutations appears on the S protein, where 7 cause amino acid changes. (B), Coronavirus mutations
between different species are mainly concentrated in the S1 segment, while the mutations of ZJ01
and other members of SARS-CoV-2 are mainly concentrated in the S2 segment.

SARS-CoV-2 into type C (68.5%), type T (27.8%), type TT (1.9%) and type Y (1.9%) of available
54 strains. (B), BaTG13 and MP789, the possible ancestor of SARS-CoV-2, was belong to type C.
Therefore, the C/T pattern may appear in the intermediate host or early human transmission stage.
(C), From the angle of global C/T categorization, China, especially Wuhan, presented with T type
while Japan and the USA presented with C type. The difference in the rate of C/T type may help
tracing the transmission route of SARS-CoV-2.

Evolutionary divergence in SARS-CoV-2 strongly correlated with Furin
protein
There were 3 potential furin cleavage site (FCS) on S protein, where F1, F2 and
F3 separately located in S1/S2, S2 and the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S1 (Fig
4A). Further comparative alignment analysis on GZ02 (SARS viral strain),
Wuhan-Hu-1 (the earliest sequenced SARS-CoV-2), RaTG13, HKU9-1 (the
potential ancestor of SARS and SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV-2 (HKU-1 and
OC43) showed that FCS exhibited a clear sequence and rule in coronavirus
evolution (Fig 4B). In detail, there was no FCS in HKU9-1, but one potential FCS
in F2 locus of GZ02 (Furin score 0.366) showed effective furin binding capacity28.
For RaTG13, F2 locus was slightly changed (Furin score 0.333) and a novel FCS
was formed in F1 locus (Furin score 0.279). Though the changes in these two sites
were inherited in SARS-CoV-2, there still existed huge differences in F1 site
between RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2.
Strikingly, we found an additional PRRA sequence in the F1 site of SARS-CoV-2
when compared with RaTG13, forming a strong and reliable FCS (Furin score
0.62). Though the source of insertion was unknown, the PRRA sequence was
common in Avian Influenza virus29. We deduced that its source might inherit from

HKU1 and OC43, which had effective FCS in F1 site (Furin score 0.878 and 0.744)
and respective amino acid of SSRRKRR and TKRRSRR, with high similarity of
NSPRRAR in SARS-CoV-2. HKU1 and CO43 could cause human upper
respiratory tract infection but the symptom was milder than SARS and
SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we reckoned that the ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 may
exchange gene with HKU1 or OC43 to obtain FCS in F1 site during evolution to
human transmission (Fig 4C). ZJ01 had Glu702 to Lys702 substitution at the site 18th
amino acid behind F1 site, and deletion (Ala771 to -) at the site 37th amino acid
ahead of F2 site. These mutations may influence the tertiary and quaternary
structure of S protein and finally change the Furin binding capacity. F1-3 sites were
conservative in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS (Fig 4D), indicating the importance of
mutation in these sites.
Protein structure analyses implied the mutation in F1 and F2 related area of
ZJ01 may influence its binding capacity with Furin protein
Homology modeling clearly revealed the position of F1-3 sites in S protein of
SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 5A). Briefly, F1-3 all located on the surface of S protein and
protruded outward, exhibiting high potential as substrate binding sites. F1 located
on the transition area of S1 and S2 (S1/S2) with obvious outward protrusion, F2
located on the mid-lower position of S2, while F3 located on the top of S1-NTD.
Further homology modeling of the S protein of GZ02, RaTG13, Wuhan-Hu-1 and
ZJ01 showed big differences in protein structure conformation of F1 locus. From
SARS, RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2, the F1 site showed the tendency of outward

protrusion (Fig 5B). Though Wuhan-Hu-1 and ZJ01 shared same amino acid
sequence in F1 site, the mutation (Glu702 to Lys702) nearby F1 site of ZJ01 may
still change its protein structure conformation and result in further outward
extension by 11.6 Å. Furthermore, RaTG13, Wuhan-Hu-1 and ZJ01 owned high
degree of consistency in F2 site. The F2 site of GZ02 was deeply buried in the
inner place of S protein, that was the biggest difference of SARS-CoV-2 whose F2
site was on the surface of S protein. Finally, RaTG13, Wuhan-Hu-1 and ZJ01
showed high similarity in F3 site that was missing in GZ02.
Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS)analysis revealed that furin was a
protease with negative charge. Its substrate binding site (191-192, 253-258,
292-295) was covered with a large number of negative charges (Fig 6). The F1 site
from SARS-CoV-2 related virus (ZJ01, Wuhan-Hu-1 and RaTG13) were
predominantly covered with positive charge while SARS was mixed with negative
and positive charge. Compared with Wuhan-Hu-1, F1 site of ZJ01 had more
positive charge in its protruding head and more negative charge in its basal part.
The F2 site of GZ02 was covered with negative charge while F2 site of
Wuhan-Hu-1 and RaTG13 were covered with low level of positive charge. ZJ01
had more positive charge in F2 site than the other strains, probably caused by
nearby gene deletion (Ala 771 to -). GZ02 had many negative charges in F3 site
while few negative charges were identified in SARS-CoV-2 related virus. Therefore,
we speculated that, though ZJ01 shared gene similarity with Wuhan-Hu-1, its

mutation near FCS changed protein structure conformation and surface electrostatic
potential, which further influenced its binding capacity with Furin.

similarity to SARS-CoV-2, SARS had F2 site, HKU1 and OC43 had F1 site while HKU9-1 had no
FCS. (B), the location and number of FCS may play an important role in coronavirus evolution. (C),
The sequence of F1 shared high similarity among HKU1, OC43 and SARS-CoV-2, which may be
caused by the Furin cleavage site translocation during the evolution of SARS- CoV-2 ancestor and
finally resulted its human transmission. (D), F1-3 showed high conservation in different coronavirus,
hinting the potential role in virus invasion and replication.

of F1-3 on S protein. F1 locates at S1/S2, F2 locates at S2 and F3 locates at NTD of S1. (B), There
are differences in the tertiary structure of the protein at the F1-3 sites of GZ02, RaTG13,
Wuhan-Hu-1, and ZJ01. The difference between ZJ01 and Wuhan-Hu-1 may be caused by the
mutation of ZJ01 near FCS.

Higher expression of Furin than ACE2 in different organs at single cell level
The protein and RNA expression level of ACE2 and Furin in human major tissues
were explored in The Human Protein Atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/). We found
that ACE2 was predominantly expressed in small intestine, duodenum, colon, kidney
and testis, while was relatively lowly expressed in lung (Fig. 7A). Furin was
expressed in most tissues and organs of the human body, and exhibited highest
expression levels of RNA in salivary gland, placenta, liver, pancreas and bone marrow
(Fig. 7B). Of note, Furin had extremely low protein expression level in lung compared
with other tissues.

Figure 6. APBS analysis indicates the mutation near Furin cleavage site may cause surface
electrostatic potential change of S protein. Furin presents with negative charge, especially its
inner substrate-binding pocket. The APBS analysis on the F1-3 sites of GZ02, ZJ01, Wuhan-Hu-1
and RaTG13 reveals the existence of great difference in electrostatic potential, which may be caused
by protein structure change in F1-3 and nearby locus. The mutation in F1-2 sites of ZJ01 may cause
its differed binding capacity with Furin, when compared with Wuhan-Hu-1.

To further explore the correlation between ACE2 and FURIN expression, we
reanalyzed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data in lung, liver, colon as

described in Methods (Figure 7C). Since ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expression were
reported recently30, we also examined TMPRSS2 expression levels in these tissues.
In the scRNA-seq datasets, ACE2, FURIN and TMPRSS2 showed higher
expression levels in liver or colon than in lung (Fig. 7E). Consistently with
previously report31, ACE2 was mainly expressed in alveolar type 2 cells in lung
(Fig. 7D-E). ACE2 was highly expressed in liver cholangiocytes, liver hepatocytes,
colon colonocytes and colon CT colonocytes compared with other liver or colon
cell types respectively. This expression pattern was the same as TMPRSS2, but
TMPRSS2 had a higher expression level in each cell type. In contrast, FURIN was
expressed in all cells types of three tissues, but had little co-expression with ACE2.

Discussion
The outbreak of COVID-19 has been rapidly spreading over the recent 2 months,
causing

enormous

damage

to

China. With

nationwide dissemination,

its

epidemiological and clinical features have changed. Accumulating evidences indicate
the appearance of several unique characteristics distinct from Wuhan8, 9, 32, including
higher rate of mild type, lower rate of severe/critical type and mortality and longer
period of nuclear acid positivity10, 11, 27, 33. Moreover, the increased transmission route
of SARS-CoV-2 has been gradually unmasked, from previous recognition of
respiratory transmission to through feces34 and even tears and conjunctival
secretions35 All these data indicate the possibility of virus evolution during its
spreading, towards the direction of decreased severity but increased transmissibility.
However, according to recently published virus sequencing results18, the
SARS-CoV-2 family members shared similar gene sequences and few, if there is any,
essential changes occurred. How to explain the contrary phenomenon in change of
clinical features and virus conservation? We selected one COVID-19 patient with
mild type and isolated his virus (ZJ01) for comparative analysis. We found a total of
37 gene mutations, with 35 unique to ZJ01. Further bioinformatics analysis showed
the difference between ZJ01 and other strains of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the
important roles of Furin. Thereafter, we conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is undergoing
evolution towards mild direction with increased furin cleavage sites.
Through analysis on 788 COVID-19 patients in Zhejiang province, we found that
there existed mild and severe types of SARS-CoV-2. Though we didn’t currently

have evidence to prove whether patients with mild COVID-19 are directly caused
by virus mutation or other factors, we indeed found the significant difference
between ZJ01 and other members of SARS-CoV-2. ZJ01 had relative high number
of 37 mutations and its RSCU was closer to humans than most members of
SARS-CoV-2. More importantly, ZJ01 was the only TT type of total 54 strains in
our C/T categorization system. Though the sequence of ZJ01 was still close to
Wuhan-Hu-1 (the earliest identified SARS-CoV-2) and its mutations were not
sufficient to reach the threshold of forming an independent subtype, our evidence
indicated ZJ01 may represent a specific evolution direction of SARS-CoV-2.
In this study, we first developed the C/T categorization system of SARS-CoV-2,
which revealed the occurrence of possibly inheritable mutation at the very early
stage of its evolution and the potential of continuing C/T subtype formation. The
TT type of ZJ01 was unique in our system. Though a similar categorization system
has been recently proposed36, they did not report such TT type in their 120 strains
of SARS-CoV-2. Besides, the C/T pattern could also be used to trace the route of
virus infection and evolution. For instance, we found 8 strains of T type with
29198T, including RaTG13, MP789, 2019-nCoV_HKU-SZ-005b_2020 and
2019-nCoV_ HKU-SZ-002a_2020 from ShenZhen (China), 2019-nCoV/USAAZ1/2020 from Arizona/Phoenix (the USA), 2019-nCoV/Japan/TY/WK-501/2020,
2019-nCoV/Japan/TY/WK-012/2020

and

2019-nCoV/Japan/TY/WK-521/2020

from ToKyo (Japan) while the other 43 strains of SARS-CoV-2 had 29198C. Since
RaTG13 and MP789 both had 8824C/28247T/29198T, we could speculate that

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.10.20033944; this version posted March 17, 2020. The copyright holder for this

these 8 strains of 29198T appeared earlier than strains of 29198C. Using this
method, we reckoned that the earliest strains of SARS-CoV-2 was one patient
admitted in Shenzhen hospital on 2020-1-10, whose entire type was
8824C/28247T/29198T/2682C/3812C/9606C/11125G/15667T/29808G.

Besides,

the earliest strain in the USA was from Phoenix, Arizona on 2020-1-26, whose
entire type

was

8824C/28247T/29198T/2682C/3812C/9606T/11125G/15667C/

29808G. Patients with these two earliest strains both had exposure history to
Wuhan. Therefore, we surmised that the origin of SARS-CoV-9 was still in Wuhan,
but the earliest virus was still vague due to lack of enough samples (Supplementary
Figure 1).
Furin is well recognized as an important serine protease, which has a minimum
enzyme restriction site of Arg(R)-X-X-Arg (R) and plays an essential role in
influenza infection. The binding capacity change of Furin in Avian Influenza may
influence its pathogenicity37. Though Furin is not the most common protease in
coronavirus, previous studies indicated its pivotal roles in SARS and MERS28, 38.
RaTG13 was the strain closest to SARS-CoV-2 with 96% sequence similarity39.
However, SRAS-CoV-2 had PRRA insertion in 690 amino acid site of S protein,
with high conservation40. This insertion may become critical point for the host of
RaTG13 turning from animal to human. Through sequence alignment, we found
this inserted sequence may arise from the translocation between human coronavirus
HKU1 and OC43 (Figure 4).

SARS-CoV-2 had three FCS (F1-3), where F1 hydrolyzes S protein to S1 and S2
and promotes virus-cell fusion, F2 hydrolyzes S2 and participates in virus
pathogenicity after cell entry, while F3 functions through NTD and promotes
adhesion between virus and cell surface. However, whether F3 site really exists and
what is the function need further investigation. Furthermore, the target cell binding
site of HKU1 and OC43 was on their SA segment of S protein while its
corresponding site in SARS-CoV-2 was NTD. Therefore, except for the potential
interaction in F1 site, there also exists the possibility of interaction in NTD segment
between SARS-CoV-2 and HKU1/OC43.
Viruses frequently undergo mutation and adjust its RSCU under evolutionary
selection pressure to adapt to the host, facilitating better replication and
dissemination41. The choice of Furin cleavage site might be an outstanding marker for
coronavirus evolution. Meanwhile, we found that the mutation in ZJ01 may cause
binding force change of FCS. All these data indicate that Furin might play a pivotal
role in the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The evolution trends of increasing FCS in
SARS-CoV-2 we found in this study are more prone to influenza-like clinical
manifestations such as human HKU1 and OC4342.
Single cell sequencing analysis showed that Furin had higher expression level and
wider organ distribution than ACE2, especially in salivary gland, lachrymal gland,
colon, liver and kidney. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 might evolve to utilize this specific
feature by increasing FCS to become more infectious on multi-organ levels. Our
hypothesis was in consistent with changed clinical characteristics of COVID-19 from

published data and our observation, including detection of virus in feces34 and
conjunctival secretions35, decreased severity/fatality, increased liver/kidney damage
and symptoms of gastrointestinal tract, increased transmissibility and prolonged
period of nuclear acid positivity. Since ACE2 expression was quite low in the whole
body including lung, we speculated that, on one hand, it might be the inflammatory
reaction whereas not the viral road itself triggering severe respiratory damage; on the
other hand, the utilization of Furin may help scatter virus attack from lung to other
organs, contributing to the phenomenon of decreased severity but increased
liver/kidney dysfunction. Nevertheless, all these speculations warrant further
investigations.
To sum up, ZJ01 isolated form mild COVID-19 patient of Zhejiang province
represents a potential branch in virus evolution. SARS-CoV-2 may adopt a similar
mechanism by depending on Furin for invasion as HJU1 and OC43. Such potential
evolution direction may promote the appearance of mild subtype of COVID-19.

was MN938384 that was isolated on 2020-1-10 from Guangdong province, China, which was more
primitive than the T types from the USA and Japan. The patient with MN938384 had exposure
history to Wuhan but there was no strain identified with such primitive feature in Wuhan. Therefore,
we may confirm the origin of SARS-CoV-2 through enlarged and thorough screening the strains of
T type in Wuhan.
