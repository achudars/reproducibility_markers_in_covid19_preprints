ABSTRACT

Wastewater-based epidemiology is a powerful tool to understand the actual incidence of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a community because severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of COVID-19, can be shed in
the feces of infected individuals regardless of their symptoms. The present study aimed to
assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and river water in Yamanashi
Prefecture, Japan, using four quantitative and two nested PCR assays. Influent and
secondary-treated (before chlorination) wastewater samples and river water samples were
collected five times from a wastewater treatment plant and three times from a river,
respectively, between March 17 and May 7, 2020. The wastewater and river water samples
(200–5,000 mL) were processed by using two different methods: the electronegative
membrane-vortex (EMV) method and the membrane adsorption-direct RNA extraction
method. Based on the observed concentrations of indigenous pepper mild mottle virus RNA,
the EMV method was found superior to the membrane adsorption-direct RNA extraction
method. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was successfully detected in one of five secondary-treated
wastewater samples with a concentration of 2.4 × 103 copies/L by N_Sarbeco qPCR assay
following the EMV method, whereas all the influent samples were tested negative for SARSCoV-2 RNA. This result could be attributed to higher limit of detection for influent (4.0 ×
103–8.2 × 104 copies/L) with a lower filtration volume (200 mL) compared to that for
secondary-treated wastewater (1.4 × 102–2.5 × 103 copies/L) with a higher filtration volume
of 5,000 mL. None of the river water samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
Comparison with the reported COVID-19 cases in Yamanashi Prefecture showed that SARSCoV-2 RNA was detected in the secondary-treated wastewater sample when the cases peaked

1. Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent
of the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first identified
in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 (World Health Organization, 2020a). SARS-CoV-2 has
spread to 216 countries, areas, or territories with more than 8,006,427 cases and 436,899
deaths worldwide as of June 17, 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020b). A significant
amount of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles were successfully cultured in enterocytes of
human small intestinal organoids, where the cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is expressed (Lamers et al., 2020). This report suggests that
SARS-CoV-2 actively replicates in enterocytes of human intestine and the virus is
subsequently shed in feces. The brush border of intestinal enterocytes is the region where the
highest expression of ACE2 can be observed in the human body (Qi et al., 2020). Recent
studies reported the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in feces (Wolfel et al., 2020) and urine of
COVID-19 patients (Sun et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020) at an early onset of
infection (Chen et al., 2020; Holshue et al., 2020). A previous study investigating a total of
4,243 COVID-19 patients reported that 17.6% of the patients exhibited gastrointestinal
symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in stool samples from higher proportion
(48.1%) of the patients (Cheung et al., 2020). This result indicated that the virus could be
shed in feces of infected individuals without gastrointestinal symptoms in addition to patients
with diarrhea. The reported proportion of asymptomatic infection of COVID-19 ranges from
18% to 31% (Mizumoto et al., 2020; Nishiura et al., 2020; Treibel et al., 2020), and 21% of
COVID-19 patients showed diarrheal symptoms (Wan et al. 2020), which means a large
number of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals shed the virus in stool, which
ultimately reaches a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) through sewage pipes. Even after a

patient recover from the respiratory symptoms, viruses can still be shed in feces for several
days (Wu et al., 2020).
A recent study reported that SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected for longer duration in
feces (median, 22 days) than in respiratory airways (18 days) and in serum samples (16 days)
(Zheng et al., 2020). While the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater has yet not been
studied, the time to achieve 99.9% die-off at 23 °C for other coronaviruses (feline infectious
peritonitis virus and human coronavirus 229E) was reported to be 2–3 days in sewage (Gundy
et al., 2009), while the other coronaviruses persisted for longer duration at low temperature
(Casanova et al., 2009). All these pieces of evidence suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can be
detected from wastewater and the data can be utilized for wastewater-based epidemiology
(WBE). The detection of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater in a low COVID-19 prevalent
area and detection even before COVID-19 cases was reported by the local authority
highlights the importance of wastewater surveillance to monitor the prevalence of the virus
(Kitajima et al., 2020; Medema et al., 2020; Randazzo et al., 2020). These recent reports
suggested that WBE could provide an early warning sign of possible disease outbreaks in a
community (Orive et al., 2020; Xagoraraki and O’Brien, 2020). Such WBE is of particular
importance to analyze the data retrospectively in estimating the probable population affected
by the virus, because asymptomatic patients who are underdiagnosed by clinical surveillance
may also shed the virus in feces.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in wastewater in Australia, Italy, Spain, the
Netherlands (Ahmed et al., 2020; La Rosa et al., 2020; Medema et al., 2020; Randazzo et al.,
2020). The first case of COVID-19 in Japan was reported on January 16, 2020, followed by
the first reported case in Yamanashi Prefecture on March 6, 2020. Yamanashi Prefecture is
located in the suburbs of Tokyo, and the total cumulative cases of COVID-19 in Tokyo
Prefecture reached 5,249 and 64 in Yamanashi Prefecture as of June 1, 2020 (Ministry of

Health, Labour and Welfare, 2020). Considering the neighboring prefectures and frequent
movement of people between these two prefectures, there is a possibility of the spread of
COVID-19 cases in Yamanashi Prefecture, which is currently considered a low prevalence
area of COVID-19.
Based on this background, this study aimed to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
in wastewater and river water in Yamanashi Prefecture using selected currently available
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and nested PCR assays. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study reporting the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a water
sample in Japan.

2. Materials and methods
2.1 Collection of water samples
A total of thirteen grab water samples, including five samples each from influent and
secondary-treated wastewater before chlorination of a WWTP where conventional activated
sludge process was utilized and three river water samples from a river in Yamanashi
Prefecture, were collected on five and three different occasions, respectively, between March
17 and May 7, 2020. Secondary-treated wastewater was further treated by chlorination before
discharge to the environment; however, the final effluent samples were not collected in this
study. Samples were collected in sterilized 1-L plastic bottles taking precautionary measures
and transported to the laboratory on ice and processed within 6 h of collection.

2.2 Enumeration of Escherichia coli
E. coli in wastewater samples was enumerated by a culture-based method using a
CHROMagar ECC (Kanto Chemical, Tokyo, Japan), while both the CHROMagar ECC
method and a most probable number (MPN) method using a Colilert 18 reagent (IDEXX

Laboratories, Westbrook, CA, USA) were used for river water samples, according to the
manufacturers’ instructions.

2.3 Virus concentration, RNA extraction, and reverse transcription (RT)
Concentration of viruses and RNA extraction were performed by using two methods. In
one method, viruses in water samples were concentrated using the electronegative membranevortex (EMV) method (Haramoto et al., 2011, 2012) with slight modifications as described
previously (Malla et al., 2019). Briefly, 2 mL and 50 mL of 2.5 M MgCl2 were added to
200 mL of influent wastewater and 5,000 mL of secondary-treated wastewater samples,
respectively, prior to the filtration. For the river water samples, 50 mL of 2.5 M MgCl2 was
added to 5 L of water samples, which was filtered through a membrane until the membrane
clogged. The wastewater and river water samples were filtered through a mixed celluloseester membrane (pore size, 0.8 µm; diameter, 90 mm; Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).
Subsequently, 10 mL of an elution buffer containing 0.2 g/L sodium diphosphate decahydrate
(Na4P2O7 10H2O), 0.3 g/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid trisodium salt trihydrate
(C10H13N2O8Na3 3H2O), and 0.1 mL/L Tween 80 (polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitanmonooleate)
was added in a 50-mL plastic tube containing the membrane. The elution step was performed
by vigorous vortexing of the membrane with a football-shaped stirring bar. This procedure
was repeated using an additional 5 mL of the elution buffer to obtain a final volume of
approx. 15 mL. This was followed by a centrifugation step at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to
obtain the supernatant. A disposable membrane filter unit (pore size, 0.45 µm; diameter,
25 mm; Advantec, Tokyo, Japan) was used for the filtration of the supernatant. The filtrate
was subsequently concentrated using a Centriprep YM-50 ultrafiltration device (Merck
Millipore) to obtain a virus concentrate. One hundred and forty microliters of the virus

concentrate was for viral RNA extraction with a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany) in a QIAcube automated platform (Qiagen) to obtain a 60-µL RNA extract.
In the second method, which is termed here as the adsorption-direct RNA extraction
method, the water samples with 25 mM MgCl2 were filtered through a mixed cellulose-ester
membrane (pore size, 0.8 µm; diameter, 90 mm; Merck Millipore) and RNA was extracted
directly from 1/4 of the membrane that was inserted in a 5-mL PowerWater bead tube of an
RNeasy PowerWater Kit (Qiagen). Finally, 50-µL RNA extract was obtained according to
the manufacturer’s instruction.
A High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA) was used to obtain a 60-µL cDNA from a 30 µL of viral RNA for both methods,
following the manufacturer’s protocol.
As recommended previously (Haramoto et al., 2018), coliphage MS2 (ATCC 15597-B1)
was added to the sample prior to RNA extraction as a molecular process control. In the case
of the EMV method, 1 µL of coliphage MS2 was added to 140 µL each of the virus
concentrates and a non-inhibitory control (NIC) sample (PCR-grade water). For the
adsorption-direct RNA extraction method, 1 µL of coliphage MS2 was added in a 5-mL
PowerWater bead tube containing the filter membrane and 1 mL of the Solution PM1 from
the RNeasy PowerWater kit (Qiagen) and β-mercaptoethanol. The concentration of coliphage
MS2 in a sample and NIC tubes were determined using qPCR (Friedman et al., 2011) and the
extraction-RT-qPCR efficiencies were calculated as the ratio of the concentration of cDNA in
a sample qPCR tube to that in an NIC tube.
The calculated extraction-RT-qPCR efficiencies were 71.6 ± 25.2% (n = 13) and 8.5 ±
3.7% (n = 11) for the EMV and the adsorption-direct RNA extraction methods, respectively,
indicating that there was no substantial loss and/or inhibition in the water samples during
RNA extraction, RT, and qPCR. The resultant low extraction-RT-qPCR efficiency of the

adsorption-direct RNA extraction method could be due to an assumption that there was a
100% recovery of virus by the EMV method.

2.4 qPCR and nested PCR assays
As shown in Tables 1 and 2, a total of six recently published assays, including four
qPCR assays (N_Sarbeco, NIID_2019-nCOV_N, and CDC-N1 and -N2 assays) (Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, 2020; Corman et al., 2020; Shirato et al., 2020) and two
nested PCR assays (ORF1a and S protein assays) (Shirato et al., 2020), were applied for the
detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the wastewater and river water samples. In addition, an
RT-qPCR assay targeting pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), a plant virus originating from
pepper products, which is considered as a potential viral indicator of human fecal
contamination, was tested (Rosario et al., 2009; Hamza et al., 2011; Kuroda et al., 2014;
Kitajima et al., 2018; Symonds et al., 2018).
RT-qPCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 were performed in 25-µL qPCR reaction volume
containing 12.5 µL of Probe qPCR Mix with UNG (Takara Bio, Kusatsu, Japan), 0.1 µL each
of 100 µM forward and reverse primers, 0.05 µL of 100 µM TaqMan probe, and 2.5 µL of
template cDNA. Nested PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 were performed in a 50-µL reaction
mixture. First PCR amplification reaction mixture contained 25 µL of Premix Ex Taq Hot
Start Version (Takara Bio), 0.15 µL each of 100 µM forward and reverse primers, and 5.0 µL
of template cDNA, while in second PCR amplification, 2 µL of first PCR product was used
in a total volume of 50 µL. The thermal cycling conditions of the qPCR assays were as
follows: initial incubation at 25 °C for 10 min and initial denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s,
followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 5 s and primer annealing and extension
reaction at 60 °C for 60 s (for N_Sarbeco, NIID_2019-nCOV_N, and PMMoV), or at 60 °C
for 30 s (for CDC-N1 and -N2). The thermal cycling conditions for both first and second

rounds of nested PCR assays were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min,
followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s and primer annealing at 56 °C for 30 s,
and extension reaction at 72 °C for 60 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min.
A Thermal Cycler Dice Real Time System TP800 (Takara Bio) was used for the
quantification for the qPCR assays, while gel electrophoresis was performed in 2% agarose
gel to visualize the nested PCR products under ultraviolet light. Five to six 10-fold serial
dilutions of gBlocks gene fragments containing the amplification region sequences of the
qPCR assays (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA) were used to generate a
standard curve. Negative and positive controls were included in every qPCR run, and all
samples were tested with duplicated qPCR reactions. For the nested PCR assays, one
negative and one positive control (gBlocks) was included in each gel electrophoresis run.

2.5 Statistical analysis
The paired t-test was used to compare the performance of the two different
concentration-RNA extraction methods. One-tenth of the lower limit of detection (LOD)
value of PMMoV (1.0 × 101 copies/L) was used for the negative sample for the statistical
analysis, as described previously (Malla et al., 2018). Microsoft Office Excel 2013 (Microsoft
Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) was used to perform the statistical analysis, and a
significant value was set at 0.05.

3. Results
3.1 Detection of E. coli and PMMoV in wastewater and river water samples
The influent and secondary-treated wastewater samples (n = 5 each) were tested to
determine the reduction efficiency of E. coli, a conventional fecal indicator bacterium, and
PMMoV, the most abundant virus in wastewater (Kitajima et al., 2014) and proposed as an

indicator of virus reduction (Kitajima et al., 2018; Symonds et al., 2018; Tandukar et al.,
2020). The geometric mean concentrations of E. coli and PMMoV RNA in the influent
samples were 3.7 × 104 colony forming-units (CFU)/mL (range, 1.8 × 104–6.7 × 104
CFU/mL; n = 5) and 4.8 × 107 copies/L (range, 3.2 × 107–9.4 × 107 copies/L; n = 5),
respectively. The log10 reduction ratios (mean ± standard deviation (SD)) of E. coli and
PMMoV RNA based on their concentrations in influent and secondary-treated wastewater
samples were 2.7 ± 0.3 log10 (n = 5) and 1.8 ± 0.2 log10 (n = 5), respectively. E. coli was
detected in all river water samples (n = 3) by the CHROMagar ECC method and the MPN
method with geometric mean concentrations of 1.2 CFU/mL (range, 0.2–5.0 CFU/mL) and
3.8 MPN/100 mL (range, 9.1 × 101–1.2 × 103 MPN/100 mL), respectively. PMMoV RNA
was detected with a geometric mean concentration of 2.7 × 105 copies/L (range, 1.8 × 105–4.3
× 105 copies/L; n = 3) in the river water samples.

3.2 Comparison of concentration-RNA extraction methods
Table 3 summarizes the comparison of the two concentration-RNA extraction methods,
based on the observed concentrations of indigenous PMMoV RNA. Using the EMV method,
PMMoV RNA was detected in 100% (13/13) of wastewater and river water samples, while
using an adsorption-direct RNA extraction method, it was detected in 91% (10/11) of the
samples. The geometric mean concentration of PMMoV RNA using the EMV method (2.6 ×
106 copies/L; range, 1.8 × 105–1.0 × 108 copies/L; n = 11) was significantly higher than that
using the adsorption-direct RNA extraction method (1.3 × 104 copies/L; range, < 1.0 × 101–
1.3 × 106 copies/L; n = 11) (paired t-test; p < 0.05). Assuming the concentration-RNA
extraction-RT-qPCR efficiency of PMMoV by the EMV method as 100%, the efficiency by
adsorption-direct RNA extraction method was 1.5 ± 2.3% (n = 11).

3.3 Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and river water samples
The collected wastewater (n = 10) and river water samples (n = 3) were processed with
both the EMV and the adsorption-direct RNA extraction methods and tested for SARS-CoV2 RNA using six qPCR/nested PCR assays. As summarized in Figure 1 and Table 4, SARSCoV-2 RNA was detected in one (20%) secondary-treated wastewater sample, which had
been collected on April 14, 2020 and concentrated by the EMV method, using the N_Sarbeco
qPCR assay. Meanwhile, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in any of the influent (n = 5)
and river water samples (n = 3) using six qPCR/nested PCR assays by the EMV and the
adsorption-direct RNA extraction methods.
The threshold cycle (Ct) of the positive secondary-treated wastewater sample was 39.96,
which corresponds to 2.4 × 103 copies/L in the original water sample. This result was further
confirmed to check for any accidental contamination of the sample with the gBlocks positive
control by using a VIC-labeled check probe (5′-VIC-AGCTAGCGCATTGGATCTCG-NFQMGB-3′) (Shirato et al., 2020), where the VIC fluorescent signal was detected from the
positive control containing the check probe sequence but not detected from the positive
sample. Furthermore, the positive qPCR mixture was purified using a QIAquick PCR

In the current study, two different methods (EMV and adsorption-direct RNA extraction
methods) were applied for concentration-RNA extraction of SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose,
PMMoV was selected as an indicator virus, considering its extremely high abundance in
wastewater (Kitajima et al., 2018). The EMV method outperformed the adsorption-direct
RNA extraction method with approx. 2.4-log10 higher observed concentrations of indigenous
PMMoV RNA in the samples. The adsorption-direct RNA extraction method was expected to
work well as the recovery of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) was high in a recent comparison
study, although HA filter (0.45-µm pore-size, 47-mm diameter electronegative membranes)
was used (Ahmed et al., 2020b), while AA filter (0.8-µm pore-size, 90-mm diameter
electronegative membranes) was used in the current study. However, unlike SARS-CoV-2,
PMMoV is a non-enveloped RNA virus. Besides, PMMoV is negatively charged, whereas
coronaviruses are positively charged at neutral pH. Thus, the recovery of an enveloped
surrogate virus with a similar structure to SARS-CoV-2, such as MHV, transmissible
gastroenteritis virus, and Pseudomonas phage Φ6, should be evaluated in future studies
(Kitajima et al., 2020).
Of the ten wastewater samples tested, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected only in 20%
(1/5) of secondary-treated wastewater samples by N_Sarbeco qPCR assay following the
EMV method, which had been collected on April 14, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been
detected in wastewater in Australia by N_Sarbeco assay (Ahmed et al., 2020), , in the
Netherlands by CDC-N1, -N2, -N3, and E_Sarbeco assays (Medema et al., 2020), and in
Spain by CDC-N1, -N2, and -N3 assays (Randazzo et al., 2020).).
None of the river water samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using six
qPCR/nested PCR assays, following the EMV and the adsorption-direct RNA extraction
methods. The possible reason for this could be a low prevalence of COVID-19 infections in

In the present study, despite the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the secondarytreated wastewater sample, it was not detected in any of the influent samples tested following
the same procedure. This discrepancy in the results could be due to the difference in the
initial volume of water samples used for concentration. The volume of secondary-treated
wastewater samples (5,000 mL) filtered was 25 times greater than that of the influent samples
(200 mL), which leads to higher LOD for the influent samples (4.0 × 103–8.2 × 104 copies/L)
as compared to LOD for the secondary-treated wastewater samples (1.4 × 102–2.5 × 103
copies/L). In addition, hydraulic retention time for the wastewater treatment process was not
considered while collecting the samples (i.e., both influent and secondary-treated wastewater
were collected almost at the same time). The SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in the
positive secondary-treated wastewater sample was two orders of magnitude lower (2.4 × 103
copies/L; Ct of 39.96 in only one of two PCR wells) than that reported in a previous study in
Spain (2.5 × 105 copies/L) (Randazzo et al., 2020). Randazzo et al. (2020) reported
comparable level of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations between influent and treated
wastewater samples in Spain (both approx. 2.5 × 105 copies/L). Thus, there is a necessity to
perform further studies on reduction of SARS-CoV-2 virus in a WWTP.
Out of five sampling dates of this study, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in four dates
(March 17, April 22, 30, and May 7) and detected only on April 14. Before March 17, the
reported cumulative cases of COVID-19 in Yamanashi Prefecture was only 2. As of April 14,
when SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the current study, 36 cumulative cases had been
reported, corresponding to 4.4 cumulative cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The curve of
cumulative cases started to rise after March 30. The highest daily new reported cases (5
cases/day) were recorded on April 7 and 11 after which the daily new cases reduced
noticeably. The curve of cumulative COVID-19 cases started to flatten after April 16. Thus,
we could observe the correspondence between the time of detection of the virus in our

samples and the time of the highest peak in the number of daily cases of COVID-19 infection
in the prefecture.
As of June 1, Yamanashi Prefecture has been one of the prefectures with relatively low
COVID-19 prevalence in Japan. Lower infection prevalence could be responsible for the
lower detection ratio of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater samples in this study. Nevertheless,
detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (even in low concentration) that corresponded to the peak of
daily new cases of infection provided an assurance that even in the areas of low prevalence,
WBE can be used as tracking or warning tools for monitoring the status of COVID-19
prevalence in a community. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in wastewater has been reported
from a country with a low prevalence of COVID-19 cases, and even prior to COVID-19 cases
had been reported (Randazzo et al., 2020). WBE could be an effective and economical tool to
monitor the status of SARS-CoV-2 circulating within a community to reduce the risk of
future outbreaks (Ahmed et al., 2020; Hart and Halden, 2020; Kitajima et al., 2020; Medema
et al., 2020; Orive et al., 2020; Xagoraraki and O’Brien, 2020). More in-depth investigations
on the spread of the virus through wastewater and on ascertaining the role of water and
sanitation interventions to prevent waterborne transmission have been suggested (Heller et al.,
2020; Nunez-Delgado 2020).
Considering the low concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, further studies to
explore a more effective concentration-RNA extraction method is recommended. Detection
of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater can be affected by many factors, including
concentration-RNA extraction methods, RT-qPCR assay, and the prevalence of COVID-19
infections in the community. Besides these determinants, some country-specific factors, such
as differences in per-capita water use or the sewer systems channeling domestic sewage and
stormwater to WWTPs (e.g., combined or separate sewer), might influence the concentration
of viral RNA in wastewater reaching a WWTP.

Despite the successful detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in secondary-treated wastewater,
it is uncertain if the detected viral RNA was infectious at the time of sampling. Besides,
secondary-treated wastewater is further chlorinated before being discharged to an open water
body. Coronaviruses are generally known to be sensitive to chlorine and inactivated relatively
faster in water compared to non-enveloped viruses, such as PMMoV (La Rosa et al., 2020).
Wang et al. (2005) reported a complete inactivation of SARS-CoV in wastewater with
chlorine (10 mg/L for 10 min; free residual chlorine, 0.4 mg/L) or chlorine dioxide (40 mg/L
for 30 min; free residual chlorine, 2.19 mg/L). Chlorine-based disinfectants, such as
household bleach, chloroxylenol, chlorhexidine, and benzalkonium chloride, were found
effective for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 (Chin et al., 2020). Furthermore, comparable levels
of reductions of E. coli and PMMoV between the current study and a previous study
(Tandukar et al., 2020) supported that these pathogens are removed substantially at the
WWTP and the treatment systems are functioning appropriately. However, unfortunately, in
the current study, SARS-CoV-2 RNA reduction could not be calculated because it was not
detected in the influent samples.
There are other cities in Japan that have low reported cases of COVID-19. Because
asymptomatic cases are less likely to be reported to public health officials, WBE could be an
effective disease surveillance tool for such cities. In addition, WBE could serve as a large
scale, population-wide surveillance in near real-time (Sims and Ksprzyk-Hordern, 2020),
especially in resource-limited regions and to alert emergency response teams for
preparedness. A unified platform, such as ‘COVID-19 WBE Collaborative’ consisting of
scientists from multiple discipline that aims to facilitate timely and high-impact WBE studies
for public benefit , is required to fight against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

•

SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in one of five secondary-treated wastewater samples
collected from a WWTP (2.4 × 103 copies/L) by N_Sarbeco qPCR assay following the
EMV method, which serves as the first case of detection in wastewater in Japan.

•

SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in any of the five influent and three river water
samples tested using four qPCR (N_Sarbeco, NIID_2019-nCOV_N, and CDC-N1 and N2) and two nested PCR (ORF1a and S protein) assays.

•

Even when the number of reported COVID-19 cases was low (4.4 cumulative cases per
100,000 inhabitants), SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in a secondary-treated wastewater
sample when the weekly reported cases in the community were high.

•

Based on the observed concentrations of indigenous PMMoV RNA, the EMV method
followed by RNA extraction using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit performed better
than the adsorption-direct RNA extraction method followed by RNA extraction using the
RNeasy PowerWater Kit, suggesting the applicability of the EMV method for detection
of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater.
