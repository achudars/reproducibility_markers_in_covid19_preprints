Background
This study aimed to investigate the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown (March-April
2020) on risk for stress/depression and functional impairment in a representative
sample of adult individuals in Denmark, and whether the impact of lockdown was
heterogeneous across living situation.
Methods:
Using a representative, randomly drawn sample from the complete Danish adult
population interviewed in March 2 to April 13, 2020 (n=2,836) and again in July 2020
(n=1,526, 54% retention rate), we study how the imposed lockdown announced March
11 following the onset of the first Danish wave of COVID-19 infections affected mental
wellbeing. We use the World Health Organization Five Well-being Index (WHO-5) and
the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) to capture wellbeing and functioning.
Using covariate adjusted ordinary least squares linear probability models and exploiting
variation in the timing of responses occurring just before and just after the introduction
of lockdown, we compare respondents before lockdown to respondents that answered
during lockdown, as well to answers in re-interviews in July.
Results:
We find reduced depressive symptoms among adults immediately after the shutdown,
concentrated in adults with children living at home. Measures of functional impairment
also decline immediately after the March shutdown among adults with children living at
home. Impairment intensified for the entire sample between March and July, but
depressive symptoms remained at lower rate in July.
Conclusions:
Findings in Denmark indicate that living with children at home may have, in the short
term, buffered the potential mental health sequelae of the COVID-19 shutdown.

INTRODUCTION

78

As of mid-October 2020, more than 90 countries across the world imposed some form

79

of lockdown in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic [1]. Lockdowns range in scope and

80

duration, but all imply a degree of social isolation as well as disruption from routine

81

social, educational, and/or work activity. Previous research which predates COVID-19

82

indicates that, following social isolation and disruptions from work routines, mental

83

wellbeing may decline [2–5], and whether people live together with others or not can be

84

an important stratifying factor [6]. In addition, a review of mental health following more

85

extreme measures of quarantine finds long-term psychological sequelae [7]. Taken

86

together, this literature has raised the concern of a “second pandemic” of morbidity due

87

to mental health problems following COVID-19 [8].

88

Recent research examines mental wellbeing following COVID-19 and the associated

89

lockdowns. Three population-representative studies—in the UK, the US, and France—

90

appear in the literature. All studies report worse mental health in Spring 2020 relative to

91

previous years [8–11]. Ettman and colleagues, for instance, find a much greater

92

prevalence of depressive symptoms among adults in the US in April 2020 relative to

93

2017/2018.

94

This work, while important, has two key limitations. First, the UK, the US, and France all

95

rank in the top 15 worldwide in COVID-19 deaths per population as of November 30,

96

2020 [12]. This circumstance leaves open the question of whether experienced national

97

severity of the pandemic (through media reports [8] or through direct experiences), or

98

the social and work restrictions imposed by a lockdown per se, drive results. Second,

99

none of these studies includes measures of mental health and/or wellbeing immediately

100

before the lockdown. The absence of “baseline” mental health information in weeks

101

before the lockdown raises the concern of confounding by trends over time in mental

102

health that coincide with, but are not caused by, the COVID-19 lockdown. Third, unlike

103

for previously studied countries, the Danish lockdown was imposed uniformly and

104

rapidly following the first infections and came into effect before the first Danish

105

registered COVID-19 fatality (see Figure 1).

106

We address these limitations and extend prior work by examining mental wellbeing in

107

Denmark, a country that imposed a lockdown in March 2020 but reports a substantially

108

lower COVID-19 burden (i.e., 14.3 deaths per 100,000 population) than does France,

109

the US, or the UK (i.e., 78 to 87 deaths per 100,000 population) [12]. We also exploit

110

variation in the timing of responses to a nationally representative survey collected in

111

March 2020. On March 11, Denmark imposed nationwide school closures and the

112

closing of public institutions. Survey responses occurred immediately before and after

113

the date when the first COVID-19 lockdown was ordered and imposed.

114

We measured mental wellbeing among the adult Danish population through the World

115

Health Organization Five Well-being Index (WHO-5) and the Work and Social

116

Adjustment Scale (WSAS). These scales capture both pre-clinical measures of mental

117

disorder as well as impairment. Further, we re-interviewed the sample in July 2020

118

when COVID-19 precautions were substantially lessened compared to the lockdown

119

period in March. Given that previous research on some subgroups finds improved

120

wellbeing following COVID-19 [13], we specified all tests as two-tailed. We, moreover,

121

explored the relation between the lockdown and mental wellbeing by family structure,

122

given that state-imposed limitations on social activity may affect persons living alone

123

differently than for persons living with family members as suggested by prior research.

124

BACKGROUND

125

Lockdown timeline for Denmark

126

Figure 1 provides a timeline of the Danish COVID-19-restrictions, the number of

127

confirmed cases for March and start of April 2020, and the data collection window for

128

the first wave of the survey [1, 14]. Denmark reported its first confirmed SARS-CoV-2

129

case on February 27, 2020 [1]. On March 11, Denmark initiated nationwide school

130

closures and the closing of public institutions, as the cumulative number of confirmed

131

infections had increased to 264. Lockdown measures were further strengthened over

132

the following six days to include border closures, the closure of restaurants, malls and

133

hairdressers, and general encouragements to work from home. Financial aid packages

134

to businesses and furloughed employees were launched in the same six-day period.

135

Unlike other European countries, Denmark did not introduce curfews, stay-home orders,

136

or mandatory use of masks during the Spring lockdown. The Danish government began

137

easing lockdown measures from April 15, 2020. Lockdown measures were continuously

138

eased over the summer, and not re-introduced until September 2020. Based on this

139

timeline, we defined the beginning of the lockdown measures as March 11, 2020.

140

METHODS

141

Variables and Data

142

To consider how measures of wellbeing and impairment changed following the imposed

143

lockdown, we used a representative survey carried out by Statistics Denmark on behalf

144

of the Capital Region of Denmark’s Mental Health Services during March-April 2020.

145

Using a random draw from the present population database of all Danish residents aged

146

18 and above, Statistics Denmark initially contacted 8,300 people through personal

147

digital postboxes that are linked directly to people’s unique social security numbers and

148

used for communications between Danish residents and governmental institutions.

149

Respondents answered through computer assisted web interviews (CAWI), with those

150

initially failing to respond receiving prompts by message to their digital postbox. The

151

response rate to the first wave of the survey was 34 percent (N=2,836); 1,127

152

respondents completed the survey prior to the lockdown announcement and initiation on

153

March 11, and 1,709 respondents completed it after March 11. These numbers reflect

154

respondents who provided valid responses to all items of our dependent variables.

155

Respondents who completed the survey before and after March 11 were generally alike

156

across the background characteristics, although the proportion of respondents age 60+

157

decreased and the proportion of respondents with children living at home increased

158

slightly (see Appendix Table A1).

159

With permission from the Capital Region of Denmark’s Mental Health Services, we then

160

carried out a follow up survey in July 2020, where the same respondents were re-

161

interviewed. Of respondents participating in the first wave, 1,526 (54%) also participated

162

in the second wave collected in July 2020. Younger respondents and respondents with

163

children living at home were less likely to participate in the second wave, as were

164

respondents who experienced significant functional impairment in early March (which

165

will likely cause us to underestimate a potential increase in functional impairment from

166

March to July), but respondents in the second wave generally resemble respondents in

167

early March (see Appendix Table A1). Answers to the survey can be linked at the

168

individual level with administrative data from Statistics Denmark. In addition to survey

169

data on mental wellbeing and functioning, our data therefore contain information on age,

170

gender, living arrangement (single/in a relationship), whether respondents were living

171

with any children in the home, region of residents (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for

172

Statistics, level 2 ([NUTS-2]), and employment status (employed, unemployed, outside

173

the labor force).

174

To capture wellbeing and experienced functional impairment, the survey included two

175

validated measures—the WHO-5 and the WSAS—that both have distinct clinically

176

relevant threshold values. The WHO-5 is a sensitive and specific clinical screening tool

177

for risk of stress and depression that uses five items to capture risk of depression

178

measured between 0-100, with each scale contributing 0-20 points. For this measure, 0

179

indicates the most severe depressive symptoms and 100 indicates no symptoms. The

180

WHO-5 has strong construct validity as a unidimensional scale [15]. For Denmark, the

181

population norm is established as 70 for adults [16]. For the WHO-5 index, we

182

(consistent with work in clinical settings) used the established cutoff point at 50 to create

183

a binary category for whether a respondent is at risk for depression and stress (i.e.

184

WHO-5 < 50, [15, Table 2]).

185

The WSAS is a functional impairment measure designed to measure a patient’s

186

perceived functional impairment following health problems across five items [17].

187

Although not originally intended for non-clinical populations, the WSAS displays valid

188

psychometric properties across different patient populations that cover both mild and

189

more severe (psycho-)somatic [18–20] and mental health [17, 21–23] conditions.

190

Furthermore, the WSAS captures a dimension of impairment distinct from depression

191

[23]. Although not validated in a Danish version, it has previously been used both in

192

Danish clinical and research settings [21]. WSAS measures impairment on a scale from

193

0 (no impairment) to 40 (most severe impairment). Given that we study a non-clinical

194

sample, we use the cutoff point at a WSAS score of 10, with any score above 10

195

indicating at least significant functional impairment with or without additional

196

psychopathologies (WSAS > 10 [17]).

197

Analytical strategy

198

Our analytical strategy exploits the fact that data collection took place across the

199

announcement and initiation of lockdown in Denmark in March 2020. First, we use

200

ordinary least squares linear probability models to compare the outcomes between

201

respondents who answered the survey before and after lockdown began. We adjust all

202

models for gender and age. Next, in fully adjusted regression models, we control for

203

NUTS2-region of residence, labor market status (employed, unemployed, outside the

204

labor force), relationship status (single, married/cohabiting), and whether respondents

205

had children at home.

206

The impact of lockdown could differ according to the home environment. Persons living

207

with family, for instance, may experience relative more social interaction than would

208

persons not living with family during the imposed lockdown. To explore this possibility,

209

we performed sub-sample analyses that compares single individuals to individuals who

210

are living with a partner, as well as sub-sample analyses that compare people living

211

without children in the home to people living with children in the home, and test for

212

differences between subgroups using a Chow-test.

213

In addition, to fully leverage our data structure with re-interviews in July 2020, we then

214

compared the reported levels of risk of depression and stress and significant functional

215

impairment measured prior to lockdown in March to the levels experienced by the same

216

persons in July accounting for repeated measures of the same individuals with clustered

217

standard errors. The latter exercise captures the development in the outcomes across

218

the first wave of COVID-19 in Denmark. Here, we control for relatively few variables in

219

the regression because we use within-individual variation across survey waves (e.g.,

220

the age of the individual does not change substantially from March to July). All

221

calculations were carried out using Stata 15/MP.

222

We then performed several robustness checks. First, we evaluated whether our choice

223

of thresholds in the outcome variables (WHO-5 < 50 and WSAS > 10) affect inference.

224

Second, because our sample is not fully identical to the Danish population on

225

characteristics such as gender and age, we replicate main results using population

226

weights provided by Statistics Denmark instead of controlling for covariates. Third,

227

selective survey participation across the lockdown in March and across the two survey

228

waves (if, for example, people who experience increased mental distress due to the

229

lockdown are less likely to participate than before the lockdown or they are more likely

230

to not respond to survey wave 2) could invalidate our results (Appendix Table A1

231

showed some sign of such selection from wave 1 to 2, although not to any discernable

232

degree from early to late March, on observed characteristics). To address this, we use

233

the within person changes in response between March and July. As there was very little

234

change in lockdown measures in July, all returning respondents recompleted the survey

235

under identical lockdown circumstances. If our main pattern of results between

236

respondents who answered prior to and during lockdown in March persist once we take

237

into account individual change up to the post-lockdown July wave, it would indicate

238

results are robust to differential selection in the first wave of response across the

239

lockdown period, and results would thus at least be internally valid. Fourth, the items of

240

the WHO-5 ask respondents to consider their experiences during the preceding two

241

weeks. To account for the possibility that respondents answering within two weeks after

242

lockdown have to consider both time before and after lockdown, as a robustness check

243

we weighted answers given in the two weeks after lockdown with the amount of time

244

since the lockdown announcement. If people considered a full two-week horizon it

245

would mean that our main estimates of the impact of the lockdown order in March will

246

be biased toward zero—that is, our main estimates would be conservative. Last,

247

because our main results focus on respondents with children living at home, and

248

because there may be different requirements and worries associated with having

249

children at different ages at home, we checked whether results differ by age of the

250

children (which we obtained from the general registers).

251

RESULTS

252

Table 1 describes the sociodemographic characteristics of the survey participants and

253

the population. Respondents (n=2,836) are similar to the broader Danish adult

254

population in terms of geographical region and socioeconomic status. We observe

255

some dissimilarities for gender and age, which we therefore control for in all reported

256

results. Over half (54%) of participants in the first survey wave in March 2020 completed

257

the survey in July 2020 (Appendix Table A1). In addition, during the first survey wave,

258

40% completed the survey before the lockdown (March 11th), and 60% completed the

259

survey after the lockdown, which permits adequate sample size to estimate mean levels

260

of depressive symptoms and functional impairment during these two distinct periods in

261

March.

262

Bivariate comparison of our outcomes across the lockdown do not reach conventional

263

levels of statistical detection. Still, adults interviewed after the lockdown in March have a

264

slightly lower prevalence of depression and stress when compared to those interviewed

265

before the lockdown (i.e., 20% vs. 22%, see Appendix Table A1), and this finding is

266

statistically detectable when controlling for age and gender (column 1 of Table A2) yet

267

does not reject the null in the fully adjusted model that controls for additional individual

268

covariates, such as household structure (to which we return; see Appendix Table A2,

269

column 2). If we expand the data to include respondents with valid responses to the

270

WHO-5 items but who had not responded to the WSAS, the decline becomes

271

statistically detectable (i.e., 20% after the lockdown and 23% before, p<.05, N=3,110).

272

Functional impairment scores from the WSAS also show a slight decline in late March

273

relative to pre-lockdown (i.e., 17% vs. 16%, see Appendix Table A1), but this difference

274

does not reach conventional levels of statistical detection when we control for age and

275

gender (Appendix Tables A1 and A2).

276

Following the state-imposed limitations on social activity, adults may have relied more

277

on family members for social interaction than they did before the lockdown. Persons

278

living alone, however, may have experienced fewer interactions during the lockdown,

279

which implies the possibility of heterogeneous impact of the lockdown orders. We

280

therefore classified the sample by cohabitation status, and then by whether the adult

281

respondent reported children living at home. Of these subgroups, only adults with

282

children living at home (upper panel of Figure 2) show a lower prevalence of depressive

283

symptoms in late March (i.e., 17% vs. 32% in early March; p<.01, see Table A3 for

284

adjusted regression results). Using a Chow-test, we found that the decrease for adults

285

with children in the home compared to adults without children in the home is larger to

286

statistically detectable degree (p <.05). All other subgroups report no difference in

287

depressive symptoms between early to late March.

288

The time course of WSAS functional impairment scores largely coheres with that of the

289

subgroup trends for depressive symptoms. Adults with children living at home show a

290

lower prevalence in functional impairment in late, relative to early, March (lower panel of

291

Figure 2; p<.05, see Appendix Table A4). Again, using a Chow-test, we found that the

292

decrease for adults with children in the home compared to adults without children in the

293

home is larger to statistically detectable degree (p <.05). The lower prevalence of

294

functional impairment among adults with children living at home remains relatively

295

constant across WSAS sub-domains of work, social, and home functioning (Appendix

296

Figure A1). We, by contrast, find no difference in functional impairment scores among

297

other subgroups when comparing pre- vs. post-lockdown periods in March (lower panel

298

of Figure 2 and Appendix Table A4).

299

Lockdown restrictions eased on April 15th. We examined whether depressive symptoms

300

and functional impairment differed among respondents several months later—arguably

301

once COVID-related social, economic, and institutional conventions in Denmark

302

stabilized for a while. We restricted the study sample to persons who completed the

303

survey in early March (i.e., pre-lockdown) and again in July 2020 (Appendix Figures A2-

304

A4 show results including late March respondents). In aggregate, depressive symptoms

305

among these adults fell, but functional impairment rose, in July relative to early March

306

(p<.05 for both tests—see Appendix Table A5).

307

When disaggregating the July responses by family structure, only adults with children

308

living at home and adults in couples reported a reduction in depressive symptoms in

309

July relative to early March (upper panel of Figure 3; p<.05, see Appendix Table A6). By

310

contrast, adults with no children at home as well as singles show no change in

311

depressive symptoms over time (p=.713 and p=.081, respectively, see Appendix Table

312

A6). Functional impairment, however, increased in July for all groups, albeit to a much

313

greater extent for adults without children living at home (i.e., 13% to 35% in July; see

314

lower panel of Figure 3 and Appendix Table A7). The increase in functional impairment

315

in July among adults with children living at home was much lower (but still statistically

316

significant, p<.05).

317

The results from our robustness checks do not raise concern over the validity of our

318

main results. First, modifying the thresholds used to define depressive symptoms and

319

functional impairment did not substantially change results (see Appendix Table A8).

320

Second, using statistical weights provided by Statistics Denmark instead of controlling

321

for covariates did not affect inference (see Appendix Figure A5). Third, relying on within-

322

individual differences in the outcomes pre- and post-lockdown in March compared to

323

July answers did not change main results (see Appendix Table A9). Fourth, down-

324

weighting “exposure” to the lockdown among respondents who participated on March

325

12th to 25th, as described in the Methods section, did not affect inference (see Appendix

326

Figure A6; we ran the same robustness check for the WSAS and again found results

327

similar to the main Tables (Appendix Figure A7). Results from our last robustness check

328

(focusing on age of children) shows that our main results for respondents with children

329

living at home are robust across age of the children when focusing on the risk of

330

depression or stress, but that the early to late March decrease in the proportion

331

experiencing significant functional impairment is driven by respondents with children

332

older than 6 years (see Appendix Figures A8 and A9).

333

DISCUSSION

334

We exploit the unique timing of a population-based behavioral survey to examine

335

whether a COVID-19 related shutdown preceded an acute change in depressive

336

symptoms and functional impairment. We examined these responses in Denmark, a

337

country that experienced relatively low incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections, but which

338

instituted strong lockdown restrictions in March 2020. Contrary to reports in other

339

countries, we find reduced depressive symptoms among adults immediately after the

340

shutdown. This reduction, moreover, concentrates in adults with children living at home.

341

Measures of functional impairment also decline immediately after the March shutdown,

342

but only among adults with children living at home. Findings in Denmark indicate that

343

living with children at home may have, in the short term, buffered the potential mental

344

health sequelae of the COVID-19 shutdown. If others replicate our work, strengthening

345

the type of social support that already seems to be present in families may serve as one

346

potential avenue for minimizing the mental health sequelae of extended COVID-19

347

shutdowns.

348

Raabe and colleagues’ survey of scientists in three European countries coheres with

349

our findings in that they report improved wellbeing immediately after the COVID-19

350

lockdown [13]. Similarly, Mari and colleagues find results that mirror ours across

351

residential patterns, although they are limited to studying Italians during lockdown [11].

352

In contrast, a multinational study using data collected late March to early April 2020

353

generally find that families report the most stress during lockdown [24], but these results

354

may simply reflect differences already existing prior to the pandemic (as our results also

355

suggest). Whereas we hesitate to draw population-based lessons from this select

356

survey of well- educated scientists, the authors note that strong security of employment

357

may have contributed to their short-term satisfaction with a slower pace and a flexible

358

work-life organization. This financial security may be similar to the situation of most

359

Danish households during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, social cohesion may

360

increase following adverse events given that shared adversity can connect individuals to

361

a broader goal and purpose than before the event [25, 26]. This social cohesion

362

explanation seems consistent with reports of fewer than expected suicide deaths

363

immediately following the first set of COVID-19 restrictions in Germany and Japan [27,

364

28]. We note, however, that this explanation is necessarily post hoc and requires further

365

refinement and testing before being considered as anything other than informed

366

speculation. We also point out that the reductions in depressive symptoms among

367

Danes appear confined to adults living with children.

368

Whereas adults living with children show reduced depressive symptoms in July (relative

369

to pre-shutdown), they are more likely to report significant functional impairment in July.

370

We suspect that, as they habituate to the reality of a prolonged COVID-19 pandemic,

371

the ability to flexibly balance work, family, and social expectations may become

372

strained. Interestingly, of any subgroup, adults living with children show the lowest rise

373

in significant functional impairment in July 2020. This result should encourage further

374

investigation, in both Denmark and elsewhere, of elements of family life that may benefit

375

social connectivity and general mental health functioning during COVID-19.

376

Strengths of our study include the population-based nature of the survey, the use of two

377

different measures of mental wellbeing and functioning, and the fact that survey

378

responses fall immediately before and after the announced lockdown. Limitations

379

involve the fact that the March comparisons of mental wellbeing before and after the

380

lockdown examine serial cross-sections rather than a panel. We, however, controlled for

381

compositional changes of the panel in our analyses. The WHO-5 also asks about 14-

382

day recall of depressive symptoms, which may have biased pre- vs. post March 11

383

responses towards the null. We, however, controlled for this circumstance using a

384

weighted analysis as a robustness check; findings, moreover, rejected the null, which

385

precludes a type II error. Lastly, we cannot rule out the possibility of seasonal

386

confounding in that late-March coincided with Spring and better temperature than in

387

early March. This seasonal confounding, however, cannot explain the distinct nature of

388

the subgroup responses in which depressive symptoms and functional impairment fall in

389

late-March only among adults with children but not among adults living alone.

390

Our findings diverge from previous population-based reports in the UK, the US and

391

France. This circumstance could arise for several reasons. First, Denmark underwent a

392

much less severe COVID-19 pandemic in Spring 2020 than did these countries, as

393

measured by overall cases or deaths per population. Danes, therefore, may not have

394

had to contend as heavily with the associated fear and anxiety of COVID-19-related

395

morbidity as did other countries. Second, Denmark’s strong social safety net largely

396

protects adults and families against large financial “shocks” that appear more common

397

in other countries (e.g., the US) when adults lose jobs [29]. Third, the work expectation

398

for adult Danes with children, when the school closures occurred in March, may have

399

been tempered in the short term. As a result, home life with children (at least in the early

400

weeks of the lockdown) may have promoted social interaction and reduced the risk of

401

depression without imposing additional work strain. Future work may want to explicitly

402

consider these important country-level differences when determining what components

403

of the COVID-19 pandemic—the morbidity, the social and educational disruptions, the

404

loss of work—affect changes in mental health and wellbeing. Such work would appear

405

to be critical not only for design of future public health efforts to enhance resilience and

406

recovery, but also for development of theory concerned with collective behavioral

407

responses to adversity.
