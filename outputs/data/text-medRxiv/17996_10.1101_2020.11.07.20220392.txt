Universal epidemic curve for COVID-19 and its usage for
forecasting
Aryan Sharma · Srujan Sapkal · Mahendra K Verma∗

Received: date / Accepted: date

Abstract We construct a universal epidemic curve for
COVID-19 using the epidemic curves of eight nations
that have reached saturation for the first phase, and
then fit an eight-degree polynomial that passes through
the universal curve. We take India’s epidemic curve up
to September 22, 2020 and overlap it with the universal
curve by minimizing square-root error. The constructed
curve is used to forecast epidemic evolution up to January 1, 2021. The predictions of our model and those of
supermodel for India are reasonably close to each other
considering the uncertainties in data fitting.

1 Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most devastating
natural disaster in the last 100 years and it is still raging around the world [52]. As of October 25, 2020, the
total infection count is around 43 million and the total
death cases crossed 1.1 million [51]. The whole world
is engaged in mitigation efforts of COVID-19. An important activity in this direction is the prediction of

epidemic evolution. Towards this aim, in this paper,
we construct a universal epidemic curve for COVID-19
and use this curve to forecast the epidemic evolution in
India.
The SIR model. constructed by Kermack and McKendrick [21], is one of the first models for epidemic evolution. In this model, the variables S and I describe
respectively the numbers of susceptible and infected individuals, while the variable R represents the removed
individuals who have either recovered or died. SEIR
model, which is a generalization of SIR mode, includes
exposed individuals, E, who are infected but not yet
infectious [6,14]. Researchers have constructed derivatives of the above models to include lockdowns and
travel restrictions, asymptomatic infections, etc. For
example, Peng et al. [34] constructed a seven-variable
model that includes quarantined and death variables
and predicted that the daily count of exposed and infectious individuals in China will be negligible by March
30, 2020. Chinazzi et al. [12] and Hellewell et al. [19]
studied the effects of travel restrictions and isolation
on epidemic evolution. Mandal et al. [29] constructed
a India-specific model that includes intercity connectivity. Shayak et al. [41] modelled epidemic evolution
using delayed-differential equations. In addition, Rahmandad et al. [35] has also used a model to predict Indian epidemic growth. Schüttler et al. [39] showed that
I(t) or total death count could be modelled using the
error function.
Asymptomatic carriers play a major role in the spread
of COVID-19 epidemic, hence there have been many
attempts to model this effect. In particular, Ansumali
et al. [2] and Robinson et al. [38] have created SAIR
model that takes into this important factor. Recently,
Vidyasagar at al. [49] and Agrawal et al. [1] have adopted
SAIR model to construct an epidemic evolution for In-

dia; this model, termed as supermodel, has many predictions. For example, it predicts 10.6 million cases by
the end of this year.
Data-driven models are also used for epidemic forecast. Recent analysis of COVID-19 data reveals that
the epidemic curve begins with an exponential growth,
after which we it follows a sequence of power laws [53,
22,28,7,11,10,48,31,42,3]. The epidemic curve flattens
after square-root growth. Motivated by this observation, in this paper we construct a universal epidemic
curve for COVID-19 by appropriate normalization. We
use the epidemic data of the first phases of epidemic
growth.
The above universal behaviour [28, 32] can be utilized for the predictions of epidemic in various countries. In this paper we overlap India’s epidemic curve on
the universal curve by appropriate normalization. We
observe that the model predictions describe the past
data quite well. In particular, the model forecast for
last five weeks are in good agreement with the observed
data within 12.3%.
In the next section we construct the universal epidemic curve using the epidemic data of several countries.

2 Construction of the universal epidemic curve
To construct the universal curve for the COVID-19 epidemic, we take the epidemic evolution curves of eight
countries: France, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Turkey, Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. We chose these countries
because they have reached saturation for the first phase.
We obtained the data from ’EU Open Data Portal’ [13]
and WorldOMeter [51] websites. The starting dates of
the data collection for these countries are given in Table 1. We take the same end date, 30 June 2020, for all
the nations.
We consider the curves for cumulative infection counts Fig. 1 The normalised I(t) vs. t plots of eight countries considered for the construction of the universal curves. The solid

versal curve, we normalize the curves for the selected
countries by dividing I(t) and t with Imax and tmax rethan fitting with various power laws at different stages
spectively. Imax and tmax for each country are defined as
of the epidemic, we fit a large-degree polynomial that
the value of I(t) and t as on 30th June 2020 (see Table
passes through the universal curve after the exponential
1). The normalized I(t) curves indeed exhibit a uniregime. This polynomial is listed in Table 2.

Fortunately, the process converges towards the unique
minimum. The numerical procedure yields Imax = 26.85
million and tmax = 850 days for which the value of error
in equation 1 is 0.1023. These values yield a maximum
overlap for India’s normalised curve on the Universal
curve (Fig. 4). We expect to get a better fit with more
data (after later date).

count were accessed from ’EU Open Data Portal’ from
4th March to 5th October. Note that India’s I(t) curve
is yet to reach saturation, hence we cannot determine

For optimization purpose of our algorithm, we used India’s data from 4th March to 22nd September, 2020.

In Table 3, we list weekly new cases, along with the
model predictions, for India. We also illustrate these
numbers in Fig. 6. The model predictions are close to
the actual data, with the maximum error if 12.3%. A
closer look however reveals that the model’s peak for
the daily cases is delayed compared to the actual cases.
This is somewhat expected due to uncertainties in determination of the universal curve. On the whole, our
model predictions appear to be reasonably robust.

5 Comparison with other leading epidemic
models for India
As described in the introduction, there are interesting low-dimension models of epidemic evolution. These
models are refinement of SEIR model. In this section,
we compare our model predictions with some of the
leading epidemic models for India. In one such model,
Rahmandad et al. [35] forecasted that in early 2021, the
daily infections count in India will reach 0.287 million
(2.87 lacs). Also, refer to Song et al. [43]. Our model
predicts that the daily count will much lower than the
above numbers, unless India faces a devastating second
wave.
India’s supermodel [49, 1], which is based on SAIR
model [2,38], has gained major prominence recently.
This model predicts that India may have reached herd
immunity with around 38 crores of the population either infected or having antibodies. One of the predictions of the supermodel is that the infection counts
at the end 2021 would be 10.6 million. For January
1, 2021, our prediction for the total infection count is
approximately 14.57 million, and that for daily cont is
81 thousands. These are over-predictions compared to
supermodel, but the predictions are reasonably close.
We believe that our present model could be improved
significantly by employing machine learning algorithms.

6 Discussions and Conclusions
We construct a universal epidemic curve for COVID-19
using the first-phase epidemic curves for the eight countries: France, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Turkey, Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. The curves for the individual countries collapse to a single curve within a stan-

5

dard deviation of 0.089 indicating a generic behaviour
of the epidemic. We also construct a eight-degree polynomial that fits with the universal curve.
Universality of the epidemic curve is an important
landmark considering that many major physical phenomena exhibit universality (e.g., law of gravitation,
phase transition, etc.). Note however that the universality in epidemic is somewhat surprising considering
major differences in demography, government actions,
lockdown conditions, etc.
The discovery of the universal epidemic curve gives
us an interesting handle for forecasting the epidemic
evolution. An advantage of this approach over others is
that it is purely data-driven. Hence, we do not need to
model the differential equation. A disadvantage of this
method is that we do not have any control parameter.
For example, SAIR model can be tuned by changing the
coefficient of some terms of the differential equations,
but we cannot do so in our model because we do not
have any control over the data.
We compared India’s reported epidemic curve with
the universal curve with appropriate scaling. We observed that India’s present epidemic curve fits with the
part of the universal curve. This discovery enables us
to forecast the epidemic evolution. We observe that our
forecasts for 5 weeks match with the observed data
within 12.3%, which is quite encouraging considering
so many uncertainties. Note however that our predictions tend to be systematically larger than the actual
data, which could be due to errors in the construction
of the universal curve.
Our model predicts that the daily cases for India’s
COVID-19 epidemic are falling, which is consistent with
the observations. This result indicates the cumulative
I(t) has reached a linear regime for India’s epidemic.
The predictions of our models and those of the supermodel are reasonably close to each other.
The universal curve could be further refined using
more advanced algorithm, such as machine learning and
deep neural networks. Also, we believe that this model
is robust for modelling the second and third waves of
COVID-19 as well. In addition, it will be interesting to
work out the universal curves for the daily cases, as well
as for the active cases. We are in the process of such
extensions.
