Abstract

28

The pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in Wuhan,

29

China, where a first wave of intense community transmission was cut short by

30

interventions. Using multiple data source, we estimated the disease burden and

31

clinical severity of COVID-19 by age in Wuhan from December 1, 2019 to March 31,

32

2020. We adjusted estimates for sensitivity of laboratory assays and accounted for

33

prospective community screenings and healthcare seeking behaviors. Rates of

34

symptomatic cases, medical consultations, hospitalizations and deaths were estimated

35

at 796 (95%CI: 703-977), 489 (472-509), 370 (358-384), and 36.2 (35.0-37.3) per

36

100,000 persons, respectively. The COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan had higher burden

37

than the 2009 influenza pandemic or seasonal influenza, and that clinical severity was

38

similar to that of the 1918 influenza pandemic. Our comparison puts the COVID-19

39

pandemic into context and could be helpful to guide intervention strategies and

40

preparedness for the potential resurgence of COVID-19.

Introduction

42

As of 26 July 2020, 188 countries have been affected by the novel coronavirus disease

43

2019 (COVID-19), with 15,745,102 COVID-19 cases and 644,661 deaths reported

44

worldwide1. COVID-19 has a broad spectrum of severity. The bottom of the severity

45

pyramid includes serological-confirmed infections, of which only a fraction will

46

develop symptoms. A fraction of symptomatic cases may seek medical care, when

47

they can be identified via surveillance systems, require hospitalization and die.

48

Hospitalization is an important metric as it determines the strain exerted by an

49

epidemic on the health care system. Further, deaths are highly relevant to planning

50

pandemic response, as mortality is an outcome that health authorities typically aim to

51

minimize. (Fig.1a)

52
53

Estimates of disease burden and clinical severity of COVID-19 are critical to identify

54

appropriate intervention strategies, plan for healthcare needs, and ensure the

55

sustainability of the health system throughout the duration of the pandemic. However,

56

quantifying these estimates based on surveillance data is challenging due to changes

57

in health seeking behaviors during the pandemic, as well as underdiagnoses. For

58

instance, the detection of a novel pathogen may give a high rate of false negatives.

59
60

Historically, two influenza pandemics had far-reaching influence to humankind

61

worldwide: the 1918 and 2009 influenza pandemics2. The 1918 influenza pandemic is

62

typically considered as the worst-case pandemic scenario for pandemic planning. In

63

contrast, the 2009 influenza pandemic is considered mild but provides a benchmark

64

for a pandemic in modern times, as the health systems, supportive care, and

65

populations, are comparable with those of today. Comparing the COVID-19 burden

66

and clinical severity with past influenza pandemics can help public health officials

67

interpret the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic and the success of the response

68

efforts. A further comparison between the COVID-19 pandemic and seasonal

69

influenza can be useful to optimize health resource allocations, considering their

70

overlapping circulation periods.

71
72

Wuhan is a particularly well-suited location to assess the health burden of COVID-19.

73

Firstly, Wuhan experienced intense community transmission of severe acute

74

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); secondly, the first wave has

75

ended, with only seven sporadic cases reported between March 24 and May 183.

76

Therefore, the first epidemic wave in Wuhan (for the period December 1, 2019-March

77

31, 2020) is an opportunity to comprehensively quantify the disease burden and

78

clinical severity of COVID-19. Here we used multiple data sources to estimate age-

79

specific rates of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, medically attended cases,

80

hospitalizations, and deaths, accounting for health seeking behaviors and

81

underdiagnoses. We also estimated rates of medically attended influenza-like-illness

82

(ILI) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections; hospitalizations with severe acute

83

respiratory infection (SARI), and pneumonia hospitalizations associated with SARS-

84

CoV-2 infections by dividing the number of ILI consultations, SARI hospitalizations

85

and pneumonia hospitalizations by the number of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2

86

infections. Moreover, we estimated the clinical severity of COVID-19 including the

87

symptomatic case-fatality risk (sCFR), medically attended case-fatality risk (mCFR),

88

hospitalization-fatality risk (HFR), symptomatic case-hospitalization risk (sCHR), and

89

medically attended case-hospitalization risk (mCHR). The rates of symptomatic cases,

90

medically attended cases, hospitalizations, and deaths with SARS-CoV-2 were

91

calculated by dividing the number of cases at each level of severity by population

92

size. Clinical severity was obtained by dividing the numbers of cases in the

93

corresponding severity pyramid. (Fig.1a) Finally, we compared our estimates with

94

those of the 1918 and 2009 influenza pandemics, and with seasonal influenza.

105

any breathing problems, finger oxygen saturation, and low PaO2/FiO2 (PaO2 denotes

106

partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood; FiO2 denotes fraction of inspired oxygen),

107

etc. Critical cases refer to cases having any respiratory failure, shock, and any other

108

organ failure that requires ICU admission. Clinically-diagnosed cases included

109

suspected cases with pneumonia as indicated by chest radiography, but without

110

virological confirmation of infection6. (Supplementary Information File 1) These

111

clinically-diagnosed cases were included in our study, recognizing the value of a

112

clinical definition at the peak of a pandemic and in the context of limited laboratory

113

testing capacity. A total of 50,333 COVID-19 cases were reported in the four-month

114

epidemic in Wuhan. Of them, 32,968 (65.5 %) were laboratory-confirmed cases. As

115

of July 20, 3,869 cases have died, and all others recovered. These cases were recorded

116

from passive surveillance which was launched at the start of the outbreak in late

117

December 2019 in Wuhan9, and from active door-to-door and individual-to-individual

118

screenings for fever (Supplementary Information File 2) 10, 11.

RT-PCR sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection varies based on the interval between

125

fever with any symptoms of cough, and/or sore throat) sought medical care during the

126

epidemic of COVID-1913. All cases from passive surveillance were considered as

127

medically attended cases. In the baseline analysis, we assumed that a proportion of

128

mild cases, and all moderate-to-critical cases (had radiographic evidence of

129

pneumonia) captured by active screening in the community would eventually seek

130

medical care given that the health system was not overwhelmed. It was assumed that

131

the cases from passive surveillance had the same health seeking behavior as those

132

captured by active screening in the community. Laboratory-confirmed cases

133

(moderate-to-critical) and clinically-diagnosed cases had radiographic evidence of

134

pneumonia, and thus were considered as requiring hospitalization. (Fig.1b)

135
136

After adjusting for sensitivity of RT-PCR testing, and accounting for the probability

137

of seeking medical care and prospective screening in the community, we estimated

138

that a total of 52,300 (95%CI 50,500-54,500) medically-attended cases and 39,600

139

(95%CI 38,300-41,100) hospitalizations were associated with COVID-19. In Wuhan,

140

over the period from December 2019 to March 2020, the rates of symptomatic cases,

141

medical consultations, hospitalizations and deaths for COVID-19 were 796 (95%CI

142

703-977), 489 (95%CI 472-509), 370 (95%CI 358-384) and 36.2 (95%CI 35.0-37.3)

143

per 100,000 individuals respectively. A consistent increasing trend with age was

144

observed across all metrics, with the highest rates occurring in adults aged 60 years

145

and over (Fig.2a, Fig.3a, Fig.4a and Supplementary Information File 3).

147

The rate of medical consultation for COVID-19 (mean: 489 per 100,000 individuals)

148

was lower than that of the 2009 influenza pandemic in China and the US (680 and

149

1,030 per 100,000 individuals, respectively). The rate of medical consultation was

150

intermediate between that of the 2012-2013 influenza season in the US (1,070 per

151

100,000 persons) and the 2006-2015 influenza seasons in China (mean: 250 per

152

100,000 individuals per year) 14, 15. (Fig.2a-2e and Supplementary Information File 3-

153

4)

154
155

The hospitalization rates of COVID-19 in Wuhan were 3.1-fold higher than that of the

156

2009 influenza pandemic, and 1.8-2.6 times that of seasonal influenza16, 17, 18, 19.

157

Higher hospitalization burden was found among older adults for COVID-19, while the

158

hospital burden was shifted towards children for seasonal influenza in China20 and the

159

2009 influenza pandemic in the US16. (Fig.3 and Supplementary Information File 3-4)

160

The overall mortality rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan was much higher than that of 2009

influenza pandemic and seasonal influenza (36.2 vs. 3.6-6.5 per 100,000 individuals)

analysis of data from eight US localities, the sCFR was estimated at 1.61% and 1.98%

168

for the first and second wave, respectively23, 24. Such a figure is substantially higher

169

than that of the 2009 influenza pandemic (<0.1% in the US) 25. The sCFR of COVID-

170

19 was higher for adults aged ≥60 years than for the other age groups (9.09% vs.

171

0.36%-1.97%). (Fig.5a-5c and Supplementary Information File 5) In contrast,

172

younger age groups were the most affected segment of the population during the 1918

173

and 2009 influenza pandemic, while both young and old individuals were the most

174

affected during seasonal influenza epidemics14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26.

Sensitivity analyses

182

To assess the robustness of our findings, we conducted four sensitivity analyses: In

183

scenario i) we assumed that moderate cases had the same health seeking behavior as

184

mild cases, i.e., only a proportion of moderate cases sought medical assistance; in

185

scenario ii) we excluded clinically-diagnosed cases; in scenario iii) we used the upper

186

limit of 95%CI of the probability of seeking medical care; and in scenario iv) we used

187

the lower limit of 95%CI of the probability of seeking medical care. Compared to the

baseline analysis, the mean rates of symptomatic cases for COVID-19 increased from

189

796 to 935 per 100,000 persons in scenario i) and 960 per 100,000 persons in scenario

190

iv), while rates decreased to 634 per 100,000 persons in scenario ii) and 719 per

191

100,000 persons in scenario iii). The sCFR decreased from 4.54% to 3.87% in

192

scenario i) and 3.77% in scenario iv), while it increased to 5.38% in scenario ii) and

193

5.03% in scenario iii). Similar patterns were observed for the other metrics of interests

194

(Supplementary Information File 3). Overall, the estimated variations did not change

195

our findings, particularly for comparison of COVID-19 with pandemic and seasonal

196

influenza.

ILI consultations and SARI/pneumonia hospitalizations

199

We quantitatively assessed the impact of COVID-19 on the healthcare sector using

200

the local number of ILI consultations and SARI/pneumonia hospitalizations in the

201

absence of COVID-19 as a reference. The rate of medically attended COVID-19 was

202

approximately 1.3 times the baseline ILI consultations among adults of ≥60 years of

203

age. The hospitalization rate of COVID-19 was 3-6 fold higher than baseline SARI

204

hospitalizations among adults of ≥20 years of age, and 25-132 fold higher than

205

pneumonia hospitalizations as a reference (and Supplementary Information File 6).

208

This study uses multiple sources of data to estimate different levels of the COVID-19

209

severity pyramid. We find that the mean rates of symptomatic cases, medical

210

consultations, hospitalizations and deaths were respectively 796, 489, 370, and 36.2

211

per 100,000 persons in Wuhan from December 2019 to March 2020. All burden

212

metrics increased with age, with adults ≥60 years of age most affected. Similarly, the

213

highest sCFR and HFR were found in older adults.

214
215

Our study is strengthened by adjustment for several potential biases. First, rates of

216

medical consultations were adjusted by the sensitivity of RT-PCR assays12.

217

Sensitivity was only 30-40% before January 23 due to delayed detection, which could

218

lead to important underdiagnoses and has not been considered in previous studies.

219

Second, we accounted for the health seeking behaviors among the Wuhan population

220

during the epidemic13. The probability of seeking medical treatment conditionally on

221

symptoms of acute respiratory diseases is a critical parameter to estimate the true

222

number of COVID-19 cases in community. Accordingly, our estimates of disease

223

burden may be the most accurate for Wuhan so far.

224
225

Two studies reported on COVID-19 disease burden in the US and Canada by the end

226

of May, at which time local epidemics are still ongoing (Supplementary Information

227

File 7) 27, 28. The overall rate of symptomatic cases (796 vs. 404-534 per 100,000

228

persons) in Wuhan was much higher than that in the US and Québec, a severely

229

affected province of Canada. Variation in testing strategies likely contribute to the

230

difference in rate of symptomatic cases, in addition to true difference in epidemic

231

dynamics. Unlike in Wuhan, only individuals with signs or symptoms consistent with

232

COVID-19, and asymptomatic individuals with suspected exposure were

233

preferentially tested in the US. Moreover, in contrast to our study, the US and

234

Canadian estimates were not adjusted for the sensitivity of RT-PCR assays and health

235

seeking behavior, and thus may be underestimated.

236
237

Our estimated hospitalization rate for a four-month COVID-19 outbreak was much

238

higher than that for a three-to-six-month COVID-19 outbreak in the US and Québec

239

(370 vs. 47-114 per 100,000 persons) 27, 28, 29, 30. We estimated that 76% of medically-

240

attended cases were hospitalized in Wuhan, while only 18% were hospitalized in the

241

US30. The difference between these estimates could be explained by the potential

242

different clinical thresholds for hospitalization. We assumed that moderately ill cases

243

with radiographic evidence of pneumonia and more severe cases would be

244

hospitalized in the context of medical practices in China, based on the probability of

245

progression from disease to death31. However, such results may not apply to other

246

countries with different healthcare practice and general health seeking behaviors. For

247

example, Chinese patients are less likely to seek care at primary health institutions

248

than hospitals32.

249
250

The mortality rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan was lower than the excess mortality in

251

New York City (24,172 excess deaths33 among 19,746,286 individuals, and thus 122

252

per 100,000 individuals), and Québec (52 per 100,000 persons)28, but similar to the

253

national excess all-cause mortality in the US (122,300 excess deaths among

254

332,382,720 individuals, and thus 36.8 per 100,000 individuals)34. In our study,

255

patients who died at home or died before being diagnosed were not considered, which

256

could have been important in the early phase of the epidemic due to under-

257

ascertainment. A recent comprehensive correction of official tallies of cases and

258

deaths by the Wuhan Authorities, included in this study, could minimize this under-

259

ascertainment. Further research should use excess mortality approaches33 to capture

260

the full burden of the outbreak, when vital registration data for this period become

261

available.

262
263

Our estimates of sCFR (4.54% vs. 1.2-1.4%) and mCFR (7.40% vs 5.91%) for Wuhan

264

are higher than in prior modeling studies35, 36. This is likely explained by the addition

265

of revised statistics on cases and deaths, and a more complete dataset with no right-

266

censored outcomes in our study. Large variations in mCFR were observed between

267

countries, which have not been systematically analyzed. Qualitatively, these

268

variations could be explained by differences in the sensitivity of surveillance systems

to detect cases at different levels of the severity pyramid, differences in clinical care

270

of severe and critical patients, and in age structure and underlying conditions of the

271

population.

272
273

Our HFR estimate (9.77%) is higher than the estimate obtained by Wang et al. in a

274

highly censored sample in Wuhan in the very early stages of the epidemic (4.3%)37.

275

However, it is much lower than the 28% estimate obtained in two COVID-19-

276

designated hospitals for severe COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, probably due to the

277

particularly high proportion of severe and critical patients hospitalized in these

278

facilities (64% vs. 28%)38. Our HFR estimate was lower than the 18.1% estimate in

279

France39, probably due to aforementioned loose threshold for hospital admissions in

280

China and preference of seeking care in hospitals rather than outpatient settings.

281
282

We systematically compared the burden of the COVID-19 outbreak with that of the

283

1918 and 2009 influenza pandemics and seasonal influenza. Our COVID-19 estimates

284

are substantially higher than those of the 2009 influenza pandemic and seasonal

285

influenza, and similar to the 1918 influenza pandemic. However, the age pattern of

286

severe disease was clearly different. Our COVID-19 severity estimates increased with

287

age. In contrast, younger age groups were the most affected by 1918 and 2009

288

influenza pandemic, and both youngest and oldest individuals were the most affected

289

by seasonal influenza. Small changes were observed when we adjusted the overall

290

burden and clinical severity of seasonal and pandemic influenza using Wuhan age

291

profile as a reference (Supplementary Information File 5 and File 8). Comparison of

292

severity estimates between pandemics was difficult to standardize, particularly for

293

1918 influenza pandemic23. The 1918 sCFR is based on data from a single US study

294

from more than a 100 years ago, at a time when awareness of viral diseases was

295

inexistent, case ascertainment and disease surveillance were limited, and definition of

296

clinical outcomes varied. Therefore, our comparison was not intended to quantify the

297

absolute value of differences, but to put the COVID-19 pandemic into perspective.

298
299

To put our results in perspective, it is important to stress that our COVID-19 estimates

300

refer to the first epidemic wave in Wuhan - a four-month long period. The epidemic

301

was controlled by intense interventions4. If the epidemic rebounds, as one would

302

expect if the infection was reintroduced in a population with low immunity, the

303

disease burden would rise. Moreover, given that the epidemic lasted only four months,

304

the stress on the healthcare system was tremendous, as severe cases and

305

hospitalizations were concentrated over a relatively short period of time. Furthermore,

306

neither seasonal nor pandemic influenza outbreaks were controlled, as vaccination

307

was either low or delayed until after the main wave had passed, and no social

308

distancing was put in place.

310

Using a simple data-driven approach, we quantitatively assessed the impact of

311

COVID-19 on the healthcare sector using the local number of ILI consultations and

312

SARI/pneumonia hospitalizations in the absence of COVID-19 as a reference. The

313

number of COVID-19 hospitalizations was several folds higher than that of baseline

314

SARI hospitalizations and 25-132 folds higher than that of pneumonia

315

hospitalizations among adults ≥20 years of age. This indicates that during this time

316

period, the Wuhan healthcare system considerably exceeded surge capacity,

317

highlighting the importance and necessity of preparedness for sufficient healthcare

318

resources. Moreover, there is a winter peak of consultations and hospitalizations

319

related to respiratory diseases such as seasonal influenza and respiratory syncytial

320

virus14, 40, 41, which may have contributed to overwhelm the healthcare sector during

321

the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic.

322
323

Our study has some limitations. Firstly, health seeking behavior maybe not constant

324

throughout the epidemic. In this survey, study participants in Wuhan were asked to

325

review their history of ARI between December 2019 and March 2020, and whether

326

they sought medical assistance for these symptoms13. However, since we did not

327

obtain the onset date of these symptoms, and hence we could not stratify health-

328

seeking behavior by COVID-19 epidemic phase. Instead, we calculated the overall

329

proportion of ARIs cases who sought medical care during the epidemic. If the

330

distribution of onset dates of ARIs cases in our sample was skewed towards the early
17

331

phase (late January) of the epidemic, the proportion seeking medical care may be

332

underestimated due to the overwhelmed health system. That would lead to an

333

overestimation of the number of symptomatic COVID-19 cases. Conversely, if the

334

distribution of onset dates was skewed towards the late phases of epidemic, we may

335

have underestimated the number of symptomatic COVID-19 cases. We conducted a

336

sensitivity analysis on the probability of seeking medical care, using the lower and

337

upper limits of the 95%CI of our survey. This analysis resulted in minor changes in

338

the disease burden and clinical severity estimates compared to the baseline analysis.

339
340

Secondly, missing or incorrect records of COVID-19 cases are inevitable during an

341

outbreak, particularly in the period when the healthcare capacity is overwhelmed. A

342

verification of reported COVID-19 cases was conducted by Wuhan Authorities to

343

correct for late reporting, omissions and mis-reporting, with 325 laboratory-confirmed

344

cases and 1,290 deaths added to official tallies. Due to the high specificity of RT-PCR

345

assay (almost 100%), false positives were rare42, 43, 44, 45. We included in the analysis

346

clinically-diagnosed cases that were reported for a brief one-week period, when

347

testing could not keep up, so we inevitably overestimated the true number of COVID-

348

19 cases. Our sensitivity analyses showed that the exclusion of these clinically-

349

diagnosed cases led to decreased estimates of disease burden and increased estimates

350

of clinical severity. However, our conclusions are robust to these changes. Moreover,

351

while reporting of cases changed at the beginning of the pandemic as the definition of

352

COVID-19 suspected cases broadened to include a milder spectrum, we expect

353

reporting was relatively stable throughout the rest of the outbreak although this would

354

be difficult to prove conclusively.

355
356

Additionally, it is difficult to extrapolate our findings to other countries/regions since

357

estimates of clinical severity and disease burden of COVID-19 are influenced by

358

multiple factors such as the evolution of the epidemic, intervention policies, case

359

detection strategy, surge capacity of healthcare systems, differences in presentation,

360

triage, and treatment, and health seeking behavior over time and across locations. A

361

modelling study has revealed that containment has proved to be successful to control

362

the local COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan. Without containment efforts, the number of

363

COVID-19 cases would have been an estimated 67-fold higher than that has been thus

364

far46. Therefore, our estimates in Wuhan could represent the disease burden and

365

clinical severity in a region with 1) wide-spread community transmission of SARS-

366

CoV-2; 2) strict non-pharmaceutical interventions, referred as to “wartime measures”

367

in the study by Leung et al.47; 3) extensive detection of all outpatients with fever10; 4)

368

enhanced healthcare capacity. Indeed, Wuhan experienced remarkably rapid and

369

extensive support from top-level medical staff drawn from all over China, as well as

370

rapid establishment of medical facilities like the Leishenshan and Fangcang shelter

371

hospitals48, 49, 50. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has already spread across the

372

world, and the scale of epidemics in western countries, like the US and Brazil,

373

exceeded that in Wuhan by far, the pandemic in other countries is still ongoing and

374

any estimate is bound to be revised. Our estimates represent the full impact of a short

375

but intense first wave, and could be considered as benchmarks to plan intervention

376

strategies for a potential second wave of the pandemic.

377
378

In the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic from December 2019 through March

379

2020 in Wuhan, China, intense community transmission caused higher disease burden

380

than the 2009 influenza pandemic and seasonal influenza. Overall, we find that the

381

clinical severity of COVID-19 seems to be in the same order of magnitude as that of

382

the 1918 influenza pandemic. In contrast to the age pattern of influenza virus

383

infection, however, the highest burden and clinical severity of COVID-19 is observed

384

among older adults, while children are less affected. During the epidemic of COVID-

385

19, the Wuhan healthcare system considerably exceeded surge capacity. This study is

386

helpful to guide intervention strategies and healthcare preparedness for the potential

387

re-emergence of COVID-19 in China and beyond.

455

Case definitions

456

Case definitions for laboratory-confirmed-cases were issued by the National Health

457

Commission of China, and included mild, moderate, severe, and critical cases. Cases

458

were confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-

459

PCR) or by viral sequencing indicating genomes highly homologous to SARS-CoV-

460

25, 6, 7, 8. Clinically-diagnosed cases included suspected cases with pneumonia as

461

indicated by chest radiography, but without virological confirmation of infection6.

462

The “clinical” definition was only used for one week in Hubei province as laboratory

463

testing capacity was insufficient, and led to a large number of clinical cases to be

464

isolated and treated without delay. These clinically-diagnosed cases were included in

465

our study, recognizing the value of a clinical definition at the peak of a pandemic and

466

in the context of limited laboratory testing capacity. The laboratory-confirmed cases

467

include mild-to-critical cases, while the clinically-diagnosed cases include moderate-

468

to-critical cases. Definitions are presented in detail in Supplementary information file

onset and diagnostic test12. The distribution of lags varied at different phases of the

476

epidemic in Wuhan due to laboratory testing capacity4. Accordingly, the daily number

477

of COVID-19 cases by symptom onset date was preferred to the aggregated

478

cumulative data.

479
480

We obtained the following data: The daily number of laboratory-confirmed cases

481

based on date of symptom onset in Wuhan extracted from a study which included

482

32,583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as of March 8 (D1), and 17,365

483

clinically-diagnosed COVID-19 cases during February 9-19 (D2)4. The daily number

484

of laboratory-confirmed cases in Wuhan based on reporting date on March 9-April 3

485

were extracted from the Hubei Health Commission (D3).3 The total number of

486

COVID-19 deaths in Wuhan as of April 24 was obtained from the Hubei Health

487

Commission (D4)3. To correct the late reporting, omissions and mis-reporting of

488

COVID-19 cases due to the healthcare capacity being overwhelmed during the

489

outbreak, Wuhan Authorities conducted a comprehensive and systematic verification

490

of reported COVID-19 cases between late March and middle April. A total of 325

491

laboratory-confirmed cases (D5) and 1,290 deaths (D6) were added on April 173. The

492

number of COVID-19 cases stratified by age and clinical category was obtained from

493

the above sources data D1 and D2, while the age profile of fatal cases was obtained

494

from the China CDC Weekly report4, 51.

496

All of these datasets were registered through a surveillance system, which was

497

launched to record information on COVID-19 cases in China at the start of the

498

outbreak in late December 2019 in Wuhan9. These data were collected from passive

499

surveillance, and active door-to-door and individual-to-individual screenings for

500

fever. The active screening was implemented twice in Wuhan on a daily basis from

501

January 24-February 10, and February 17-1910, 11. A total of 16,781 laboratory-

502

confirmed cases were identified through active screening (D7, Details shown in

503

Supplementary information file 2)10, 11.

505

Sensitivity of RT-PCR

506

A study retrospectively analyzed the RT-PCR assays of 301 patients with 1,113

507

specimens in Wuhan, and found that RT-PCR sensitivity varied at different phases of

508

the epidemic due to the difference of interval between symptom onset and laboratory

509

testing (Pse) (Supplementary information file 9). The sensitivity of RT-PCR assays

510

was highest (97.9%) at an interval of <7 days12.

511
512

Health seeking behavior surveys

513

A population-based telephone and online survey was conducted to understand the

514

health seeking behaviors of patients suffering from acute respiratory infections (i.e.,

515

fever with any symptoms of cough, and/or sore throat) during the epidemic of

516

COVID-19 in Wuhan. Of patients with acute respiratory infections, 35.4% (95%CI

In the baseline analysis, we considered COVID-19 cases in Wuhan as those with

540

laboratory-confirmation or with a clinical diagnosis (for the brief period where the

541

clinical definition was in place) and tabulated data by symptom onset date. The

542

interval between symptom onset and diagnosis was obtained from data D1 4. Then, we

543

randomly simulated 10,000 draws from a gamma distribution representing these time

544

intervals to estimate onset dates for laboratory-confirmed cases reported between

545

March 9-April 3 (data D3), and added laboratory-confirmed cases (data D5). This

546

allowed us to impute onset dates for cases that did not have this information.

547
548

Medical consultations

549

All cases from passive surveillance were considered as medical attendance (data

550

D1+D3+D5, and D2). In the baseline analysis, we assumed that a proportion of mild

551

cases, and all moderate-to-critical cases captured by active screenings in the

552

community (data D7) would eventually seek medical care given that the health system

553

was not overwhelmed (Assumption 1). The health seeking behavior of mild cases was

554

assumed to be the same as aforementioned patients with acute respiratory infections

555

during the COVID-19 epidemic (Pmed.care)13. Hence, to estimate medically attended

556

cases, we only excluded a proportion of (1-Pmed.care) mild cases identified by

557

community screening from the total reported COVID-19 cases. Moreover, the number

558

of laboratory-confirmed cases from official reports (data D1+D3+D5, and D7) was

559

divided by the sensitivity of RT-PCR (Pse) to account for underdiagnoses.

560
561

Symptomatic cases

562

In the baseline analysis, we assumed the cases from surveillance system (data

563

D1+D3+D5, and D2) had the same health seeking behavior as those captured by

564

active screenings in the community (data D7) given that the health system was not

565

overwhelmed (Assumption 1). Accordingly, the number of mild symptomatic cases

566

was estimated by dividing reported mild COVID-19 cases by the probability of

567

seeking medical care, conditionally on self-reported acute respiratory infection13.

568

Adjustment of sensitivity of RT-PCR was considered as well.

569
570

Hospitalized cases

571

Moderate-to-critical COVID-19 cases had radiographic evidence of pneumonia, while

572

mild cases were defined as those without radiographic evidence of pneumonia5, 6, 7, 8.

573

Chest x-ray confirmed pneumonia is a threshold for hospital admissions in China.

574

Accordingly, in our study, estimates for SARS-CoV-2 related hospitalizations

575

excluded patients defined as mild cases in the baseline analysis. (Assumption 2)

576
577

In above analyses, to account for the uncertainty of two parameters (RT-PCR

578

sensitivity and probability of seeking medical care), we conducted a Monte Carlo

579

Simulation by drawing 10,000 samples on the basis of Binomial distributions. We

580

generated 10,000 estimates for the number of COVID-19 cases, based on which we

581

calculated the median, and 95% CIs (the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles) for the

582

outcomes of interest in this study.

583
584

Additionally, below sensitivity analyses were conducted: in scenario i) for above

585

Assumptions 1) and 2), we assumed moderate cases had the same health seeking

586

behavior as mild cases, i.e., only a proportion of moderate cases sought medical

587

assistance (Pmed.care); and in scenario ii) we excluded clinically-diagnosed cases. Chi-

588

square tests were used to compare the estimates of baseline and sensitivity analyses.

589

Two-sided P values <0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.

590
591

Disease burden

592

We used the number of ILI consultations, and the number of SARI/pneumonia

593

hospitalizations in the absence of COVID-19 outbreak as a reference to estimate

594

COVID-19 related ILI medical consultations, and COVID-19 associated

595

SARI/pneumonia hospitalization rate. Estimation of the number of ILI cases and

596

SARI/pneumonia hospitalizations during the periods are shown in Supplementary

597

Information file 11-14.

599

Moreover, for comparison with historical outbreaks, we conducted a narrative review

600

on estimates of disease burden and clinical severity for the 1918 and 2009 influenza

601

pandemics, as well as seasonal influenza in China and USA (Summary of studies

602

shown in Supplementary Information file 4-5). The age profile of COVID-19 cases

603

was obtained from data D14, in which COVID-19 cases were broken down into 20-

604

year age categories. We could not generate disease burden and clinical severity

605

estimates for influenza using the same age stratification because numerators and

606

denominators were not available from the literatures.

The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data

610

interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all

611

the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for
