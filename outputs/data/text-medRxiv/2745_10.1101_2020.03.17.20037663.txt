We review the Kermack and McKendrick model of epidemics and apply it to Covid-19. Despite
the simplicity of this model, solid conclusions are extracted that can assist potential decisions on
the strategy to combat the outbreak, essentially configuring a scenario ranging from short-term
suppression to long-term mitigation depending on the achieved reduction in the contact number.

dr/dt = i/T,
where T is a characteristic lifetime defining the 1/e decay
in the probability of an individual to transit from infected
(i) to recovered or dead (r). Also, the uninfected fraction
is depleted according to
ds/dt = −σ si/T,
which describes an exponential transit from susceptible
(s) to infected (i) at a rate that is σ times faster than the
decay from infected to recovered. We can roughly understand T as the average time during which an infected individual remains contagious, while σ is the contact number, also known as transmission number (i.e., the number of individuals that become infected on average due
to exposure to one previously infected specific individual). The expansion of Covid-19 presents a dynamical
scenario and we expect it to remain so and to depend
on local habits, implementation of social distancing, and
response of the population in each specific region. This
model can then be used to estimate the evolution of the
outbreak at a local scale over a limited period of time in
which σ remains approximately constant. Extrapolations
to the global scale are more challenging and may require
an extension of the model combined with the availability
of reliable relevant parameters.
The above equations for the SIR model can be conveniently solved as a function of the normalized time
τ = t/T , in terms of which we have
dr/dτ = i,
di/dτ = (1 − r − i) σ i − i,

Recovered fraction, r

In their so called SIR model, Kermack and McKendrick
[1] formulated a rate equation describing the expansion
of infections in the population under the assumption of a
uniform transmission rate and exposure of all individuals.
In brief, they examined the fraction of susceptible people
s(t) who have not been infected at a given time t, as well
as the fraction of infected people i(t) that can still be
contagious and the fraction of recovered people r(t) =
1 − s(t) − i(t) that have been previously infected but are
no longer contagious because they are either cured or
dead. The latter evolves in time according to [2]

FIG. 1: Solutions of the SIR model for different values of the
contact number σ. We show the infected (top) and recovered
(bottom, including deaths) fractions as a function of time t
normalized to the active time T over which an infected person
remains contagious. We take r(0) = 0 and i(0) = 10−3 at
t = 0. The obtained curves are simply displaced to the right
if smaller values of i(0) is assumed.

together with s = 1 − r − i. Initial conditions at the
beginning of the outbreak (t = 0) are r = 0 and i  1.
The actual value of i at t = 0 determines the time needed
to reach a maximum in i, but not the magnitude of this
maximum. Solutions of the above equations are widely
available in the literature, including phase diagrams of
epidemics for fixed σ [2]. We base the remainder of the
present analysis of Covid-19 on the solutions shown in
Figs. 1 and 2.
We are currently at the beginning of the outbreak, so
the infected and recovered fractions i and r are still small.
The evolution of the infection should then depend on the
contact number σ, for which values in the 1.5-3 range
have been estimated, although conclusive data are still
lacking. This number might be affected by mutated variants of the virus, which should also require a more sophisticated analyses beyond the SIR model.

Contact number, s

FIG. 2: Evolution of the asymptotic fraction of recovered
(top) and infected (middle) people as a function of contact
number σ. The bottom plot shows the normalized time at
which the peak of infection is reached for r(0) = 0 and i(0) =
10−3 .

For an order-of-magnitude estimate of the impact of
the outbreak, assuming a likely value of σ ∼ 2.5, the
peak in infected fraction exceeds 0.2 (Fig. 1, top). This
figure has to be considered together with the mortality of
the infection, currently believed to be ∼ 1% with medical
assistance for the most serious cases (∼ 10%) and > 3%
without medical assistance. With a  1% fraction of
hospital beds per inhabitant in most countries, and even
lower capacity of the required type of help (e.g., oxygen
concentrators and respiratory assistance) for the most
serious cases of Covid-19 infection, the evolution with
a maintained contact number σ ∼ 2.5 implies a 0.03 ×
0.89 ≈ 2.7% final death toll.
Social distancing can bring down the peak infected
fraction, and consequently, also the overall impact of the
infection, both because medical treatment can be provided to a larger fraction of the infected population and
because herd immunity is reached with a lower recovered fraction (Fig. 1). Effectively, social distancing can
be understood in the light of the SIR model as a reduction of the value of σ. Still, the simulations presented
in Fig. 1 show that even with a reduction from σ ∼ 2.5
to σ ∼ 1.3 (a level similar to seasonal flu), the infected
fraction stays well above hospital capacity, implying a 3%
mortality rate of the infection, and eventually resulting
in a 1.2% final death toll.
A pertinent question in this respect is whether the
measures adopted by different countries can bring the

effective value of σ down to a range sufficiently close to
1, or even below 1 (i.e., the condition for exponential attenuation of the outbreak), in order to reduce the above
levels of final death toll. In this respect, the media have
speculated that summer conditions could push σ below
1, a possibility that seems to be unlikely when examining the current evolution of the outbreak in the Southern
hemisphere.
Here, we presented results normalized to the average
time T during which an individual remains contagious.
Currently, no conclusive values exist for this quantity,
so for a rough estimate we can assume T ∼ 2 − 4 weeks.
The fastest outcome of the pandemic (free evolution with
σ ∼ 2.5) then requires ∼ 20−40 weeks to reach a low fraction of infected people after maximum expansion of the
virus (Fig. 1, top). With social distancing measures that
bring σ down to a value reasonably close to 1, the process should take even longer, eventually extending over
the period needed to develop a vaccine and produce a sufficient number of doses to reach herd immunity (ignoring
the effect of eventual mutations). Additional information
on the final fraction of the population that becomes infected, the peak fraction of infected people, and the time
at which such peak occurs in units of T is provided in
Fig. 2 as a function of the contact number σ. We should
stress again the relevant question that arises, are the measures taken by different countries sufficient to produce a
substantial departure down from the value of σ ∼ 2.5
that seems to rule the outbreak in the absence of social
distancing? Are those measures enough to push σ close
or below 1 in order to avoid a collapse of our medical
systems?
Two models are being proposed at the moment: controlled spreading (UK, The Netherlands); and lockdown
(China, Italy, Spain). While the former is a social experiment that goes beyond the scope of this short report, the
latter could work if one approaches σ  1. To illustrate
that, at the current early state (i, r  1), the evolution of
the infected fraction can be approximated by a simplified
version of the SIR model: di/dτ = −(1 − σ) i. In contrast to the long times required to deal with the
situation by reducing σ, but staying above 1, the
strategy of making σ < 1 leads to an exponential
attenuation of i ∼ e−(1−σ)τ with a characteristic
decay time T /(1 − σ). This model thus supports
the recommendation of making σ  1 to deal with
the problem in a time interval stretching a few
times T (the Hubei solution).
