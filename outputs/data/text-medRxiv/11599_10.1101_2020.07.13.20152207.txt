Abstract
Background and Purpose
Reports have suggested that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
causes neurologic manifestations including encephalopathy and seizures. However, there has
been relatively limited electrophysiology data to contextualize these specific concerns and to
understand their associated clinical factors. Our objective was to identify EEG abnormalities
present in patients with SARS-CoV-2, and to determine whether they reflect new or preexisting
brain pathology.

Methods
We studied a consecutive series of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 who received an
EEG, obtained using tailored safety protocols. Data from EEG reports and clinical records were
analyzed to identify EEG abnormalities and possible clinical associations, including neurologic
symptoms, new or preexisting brain pathology, and sedation practices.

Results
We identified 37 patients with SARS-CoV-2 who underwent EEG, of whom 14 had epileptiform
findings (38%). Patients with epileptiform findings were more likely to have preexisting brain
pathology (6/14, 43%) than patients without epileptiform findings (2/23, 9%; p=0.042). There
were no clear differences in rates of acute brain pathology. One case of nonconvulsive status
epilepticus was captured, but was not clearly a direct consequence of SARS-CoV-2.
Abnormalities of background rhythms were common, and patients recently sedated were more
likely to lack a posterior dominant rhythm (p=0.022).

Conclusions
Epileptiform abnormalities were common in patients with SARS-CoV-2 referred for EEG, but
particularly in the context of preexisting brain pathology and sedation. These findings suggest
that neurologic manifestations during SARS-CoV-2 infection may not solely relate to the
infection itself, but rather may also reflect patients’ broader, preexisting neurologic
vulnerabilities.

Introduction
As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has grown, there has been concern about
its possible neurologic consequences1. COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, whose presentations range from asymptomatic to
severe2. One early series of patients with severe infection described neurologic findings of
impaired consciousness (14.8%) and seizure (1.1%)3, while another noted that 27% of patients
had seizure risk factors, though clinical seizures appeared rare4. However, routine EEG data to
support or contextualize these concerns has been limited to smaller series5–8, with some series
abstaining from EEGs altogether due to safety concerns4, including limited personal protective
equipment (PPE), risks of technician exposure, and possible iatrogenic spread through personnel
or equipment contamination. A paucity of EEGs could underestimate the rate of seizures and
epileptiform activity in SARS-CoV-2, given reports of seizures in other coronavirus outbreaks9
and reports of patients with SARS-CoV-2 with nonconvulsive or focal status epilepticus10,11. It is
therefore imperative to understand what EEGs might reveal in a broader series of patients with
SARS-CoV-2.
Concerns have also been raised about the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-212. In some
cases, the presence of neurologic symptoms has even been used to infer central nervous system
(CNS) invasion13, and there is at least one possible case of meningoencephalitis with a positive
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)14. Autopsy
series, however, have been conflicting regarding rates of neuroinvasion15, with the largest series
suggesting that neuroinvasion is limited16. It is therefore unclear whether seizures or
encephalopathy in SARS-CoV-2 are due to new CNS injury, reflect increased sensitivity in

patients with preexisting vulnerabilities, or are associated with aspects of clinical care such as
sedation.
We may be able to disambiguate this etiologic complexity by determining the burden and clinical
associations of EEG abnormalities in SARS-CoV-2. We therefore undertook a study of all
patients at our institution with SARS-CoV-2 who received an EEG, to test the hypothesis that
there is a moderate rate of epileptiform discharges in patients with SARS-CoV-2, but that they
are most common in patients with preexisting, rather than new, brain pathology.

Methods
Patient Cohort
We retrospectively identified all inpatients who received an EEG at an academic medical center
in Boston, Massachusetts, starting after identification of the second case of COVID-19 statewide
(March 2, 2020 – May 6, 2020). Patients receiving EEGs were cross-referenced against a
centralized hospital database of COVID-19 status and SARS-CoV-2 results, detected using RTPCR from nasopharyngeal samples. All patients with at least one positive SARS-CoV-2 result
and a clinically interpreted EEG were included. To minimize bias, there were no further
inclusion or exclusion criteria. The sample size was determined by the number of cases during
the review period.

Protocol Approvals and Patient Consents
This study of human subjects was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at
Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA), including review of EEG and other clinical data.

The Partners Healthcare Human Research Committee provided a waiver of consent for this
retrospective study.

EEG Recordings
Protocols were developed to perform EEGs in the context of institutional guidance on care for
patients with COVID-19, consistent with the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society’s
recommendations17. EEGs were recorded using disposable Ag/AgCl scalp electrodes
(Rhythymlink) using standard international 10-20 electrode placement. Care was taken with the
angle of the head of the bed and manipulation of intubated patients was minimized. Although
electrode placement in prone patients was anticipated, with a plan to use disposable printed
electrodes and related supplies (Spes Medica TechSystem), no patient was prone at the time of
electrode placement; though two were proned prior to removal. Single use bags were made for
all items including skin prep (NuPrep) and conductive paste (Ten20). No air hoses or collodion
were used. Leftover supplies were kept in patient rooms for possible later use and to minimize
cross-contamination. Activation procedures, such as photic stimulation and hyperventilation,
were not performed. Following use, computers and devices were wiped down using germicidal
disposable wipes (Sani-Cloth). Portable EEG equipment was kept in a separate room for at least
one hour after cleaning, away from people and other EEG machines.
All EEGs for patients with SARS-CoV-2 were performed by a single, experienced EEG
technician, who sequestered at least two meters away from all other staff and had an exclusive
computer. EEG technicians worked on a limited hour basis in the hospital depending on daily
inpatient needs. All hospital employees were required to wear a surgical mask for their entire
shift while on-site, except when working in private individual offices or in areas where

employees were reliably separated by more than two meters. Additional precautions in rooms of
patients with known or suspected COVID-19 included an N95 respirator, gloves, gown, and eye
protection (goggles or face shield). All hospital employees had to attest daily to not having
COVID-19 related symptoms, including fever, sore throat, new cough, new nasal congestion,
muscle aches, new loss of smell, or shortness of breath.

EEG Interpretation
EEG recordings were reviewed by two clinical electroencephalographers (one board-certified
attending physician and one fellow) before reports were finalized in the electronic medical
record. Electroencephalographers interpreted recordings remotely via secure Internet
connections, which also allowed access to routine clinical data. Clinical disagreements were
resolved through virtual discussion.

Medical Record Review
Clinical EEG reports were reviewed by two neurologists to identify various possible
abnormalities (listed in Table 3), including Background/Rhythm abnormalities, Rhythmic and
Periodic Patterns, Sporadic Discharges, and Seizure activity. The characteristics of sporadic and
periodic discharges were recorded, including whether they were identified as focal, multifocal, or
generalized, and with triphasic morphology present or absent. If more than one morphology was
reported then all were extracted. Patients with epileptiform findings were those with status
epilepticus or seizures, with burst suppression with epileptiform activity, and with focal,
multifocal, or generalized discharges, without triphasic morphology present.
Medical records were reviewed to extract clinical information including age, dates of symptom
onset and hospitalization, medications, epidemiological risk factors18, bedside assessments of

arousal and sedation (Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale, RASS)19, neurologic exams, chest and
brain imaging, and initial COVID-19 related labs. We also noted the clinical questions
prompting EEG. Any disagreements were resolved through virtual discussion.

Statistical Analysis
Proportions, medians, and inter-quartile ranges (IQR) were calculated for descriptive analyses.
Quantitative data was compared using rank-sum tests, and proportions were compared using
Pearson Chi-square (χ2) tests with Yates’ continuity correction. The significance level for all
tests was p<0.05. No corrections for multiple comparisons were performed given the exploratory
nature of the study. Analyses were performed in MATLAB (R2018b, MathWorks).

Results
Patient Characteristics
We studied EEG findings in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2. A total of 307 patients
received an acute care EEG during the study period, of which 37 tested positive for SARS-CoV2, all before EEG. From the date of the first EEG in a patient positive for SARS-CoV-2
(3/27/2020), 25% of subsequent EEGs were in patients with SARS-CoV-2 (37/149 patients). The
patients’ clinical characteristics are displayed in Table 1. Most patients had chest imaging
findings consistent with COVID-19 (32/37, 86%), and most were intubated (28/37, 76%).
Laboratory studies revealed elevated inflammatory markers (Supplemental Table 1).

Neurologic Context for EEG Studies
Patients had diverse neurologic characteristics (Table 2). Only one patient had a history of
epilepsy prior to presentation (1/37, 3%), secondary to prior intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Seven other patients had a history of central nervous system (CNS) disease. One patient had
Dementia with Lewy Bodies, and six patients previously had ischemic strokes, including one in
the context of cerebral aneurysm coiling and one in the context of metastatic small cell lung
cancer. Acutely, most patients had altered mental status, even in the absence of sedation or
persistently during sedation weans (28/37, 76%). Some patients were reported to have anosmia
(4/37, 11%). New focal signs were relatively rare: two had patients had gaze preferences and one
had hemiparesis (3/37, 8%).
Based on clinical evaluation, neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies, nine patients
were determined to have acute CNS pathology (9/37, 24%), including three with ischemic stroke,
three with intracerebral hemorrhage, and one each with cryptococcal meningitis in the setting of
virally unsuppressed HIV infection, paraneoplastic encephalitis in the setting of small cell lung
cancer, and subacute combined degeneration in the setting of nitrous oxide abuse. The latter
three non-vascular events were thought not to be direct results of SARS-CoV-2 per care teams.
Several concerns prompted EEG, including convulsions with unresponsiveness concerning for
seizures (11/37, 30%), altered mental status (24/37, 65%), and monitoring during post-cardiac
arrest hypothermia (2/37, 5%). Most EEGs involved long-term monitoring (LTM; 23/37, 65%),
with a median of 22.5 hours (IQR 0.4 – 43.4 hours). Most patients had received recent sedation,
either on the day of EEG or the day prior (27/37, 73%), and patients had a median RASS of -3
(IQR -4 to -2). Only 10 patients could have sedation weaned during EEG. Sedation was often

specifically targeted to deep levels due to ventilator dyssynchrony in the context of acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (13/27 deeply sedated for dyssynchrony, 48%).

EEG Results
EEG revealed findings in all patients (Table 3). The most common EEG findings were
generalized abnormalities of background rhythms, including absent posterior dominant rhythms
(34/37, 92%) and generalized delta and theta slowing (Figure 1A). Due to the possible effects of
sedation on background rhythms, we stratified patients according to whether they had recently
received sedation. Patients who had recently received sedation were more likely to lack a
posterior dominant rhythm (absent in 27/27, 100%), compared to 7/10 (70%), of patients who
had not recently received sedation (χ2 p=0.022).
EEG studies in seven patients included capture of convulsive or concerning events, but none had
electrographic correlates of discrete seizures. Electrographic seizures were also uncommon, with
only one case of nonconvulsive status epilepticus (2.7%; 95% confidence interval 0-7.9%). This
patient was a woman in her 60s with a history twenty years prior of a left posterior
communicating artery aneurysm, whose coiling was complicated by a left precentral gyrus
infarct. She had no prior history of seizures. She presented acutely with syncope, and Chest CT
revealed an ascending aortic dissection with rupture and tamponade, but no signs of viral
pneumonia. She tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. She underwent emergent repair, and aortic
pathology revealed focal chronic inflammation composed primarily of CD3+CD4+ T-cells and
CD68+CD163+ macrophages, but no diagnostic features of active aortitis. Post-operatively she
developed left sided head and arm twitching while being weaned from propofol. CT did not
reveal acute pathology. Her EEG demonstrated right frontal and generalized periodic sharp

waves, without convulsive activity but with frequency increasing to 4 Hz when propofol was
held, which was determined to be electrographically and clinically consistent with nonconvulsive status epilepticus (Figure 1B). After treatment of non-convulsive status epilepticus,
an MRI revealed small acute infarcts in right middle frontal gyrus and left superior parietal
lobule, consistent with emboli from her dissection. Following care, she was discharged to a
rehabilitation facility.
Sporadic and periodic discharges were also observed in the EEG studies (Figure 1C). Discharges
were morphologically classified by clinical EEG readers, and patients sometimes had more than
one morphology. There was no definite frontal or temporal predominance. We identified patients
with epileptiform findings as those with focal, multifocal, or generalized discharges, excluding
those with triphasic morphology, as well as patients with electrographic seizures, status
epilepticus, or burst suppression with epileptiform activity. 38% of patients had epileptiform
findings (14/37, Table 4). We evaluated what clinical characteristics were more common in
patients with epileptiform findings. A history of CNS pathology was more common in patients
with epileptiform findings (6/14 patients with epileptiform findings had a history of CNS
pathology, compared to 2/23 patients without epileptiform findings, χ2 p=0.042). EEGs with
epileptiform findings were also obtained earlier in patient’s courses (p=0.044).
Care was escalated in four patients with epileptiform findings. Two patients received increased
antiepileptic therapy. Two additional patients received benzodiazepine trials for generalized
periodic discharges, one of which improved clinically but was ultimately thought to be more
consistent with catatonia than nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

EEG Safety
To date, none of our EEG staff has tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, including the technician
performing the studies, other EEG technicians, and interpreting neurophysiologists. Additionally,
there have been no known cases nor safety reports in our institution regarding crosscontamination of other patients as a result of EEG testing.

Discussion
SARS-CoV-2 and Epileptiform EEG Findings
All patients with SARS-CoV-2 in our study who received EEGs for clinical purposes had EEG
abnormalities, including epileptiform findings in just over a third of the patients, despite only one
patient having a history of epilepsy. These findings have been seen in other types of critical
illness20,21, suggesting that direct neuroinvasion need not occur to explain such findings.
Epileptiform activity appeared to be associated with preexisting brain pathology, but not acute
clinical or radiographic findings. Case reports of status epilepticus in SARS-CoV-2 have been
described both with11,22 and without10,23 prior CNS pathology. Although several patients had
acute CNS pathology, a direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 was sometimes hard to ascertain, even for
our patient with nonconvulsive status epilepticus.
Epileptiform abnormalities were relatively diverse including multifocal and generalized
discharges, and other potentially epileptiform findings such as discharges with triphasic
morphology. While there has been concern that intranasal infection may be a potential route for
coronavirus neuroinvasion24, there was no clear association between epileptiform findings and
anosmia, nor was there a fronto-temporal predominance to suggest specifically limbic

involvement. Other groups have noted frontally predominant abnormalities in patients with
SARS-CoV-27,8,25,26, but in at least one paper frontal slowing appeared similar to that seen in
metabolic encephalopathies and correlated with systemic lab findings7. Although a few
encephalitides are associated with suggestive EEG findings, such as very low frequency periodic
complexes in measles-related subacute sclerosing panencephalitisis27 or lateralized periodic
epileptiform discharges in HSV encephalitis28, neither finding is necessarily specific. Our study
did not identify an EEG finding more specific to SARS-CoV-2 than other syndromes.
Several EEGs included capture of convulsive or concerning events, but none had electrographic
correlates. This suggests the need for care regarding the diagnosis of seizures solely based on
convulsions in patients with SARS-CoV-2, which can also manifest with myoclonus29. More
detail may be necessary when seizures are diagnosed or reported in COVID-19 without
description of ancillary data.

SARS-CoV-2 and EEG Background Rhythms
In addition to epileptiform abnormalities, the most common EEG findings were background
rhythms abnormalities, a nonspecific finding that can be associated with poor prognosis30. Some
abnormalities, for example generalized theta slowing, were frequent even in patients who had not
recently received sedation, and this can be seen in non-encephalitic conditions such as toxicmetabolic encephalopathies31. However, the increased lack of a posterior dominant rhythm in
patients recently receiving sedation suggests that some background rhythm abnormalities in
SARS-CoV-2 may not simply reflect direct effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but may include
contributions from its management, such as sedation.

A consideration that was unexpected at the outset of this study was how frequently patients were
deeply sedated, beyond typical sedation goals (for example to a RASS of -3, rather than -1 to 0).
While ICU sedation can unintentionally become deeper than intended, especially when the
number of bedside evaluations are limited32, sedation was also intentionally deep and rarely
lifted successfully due to ventilator dyssynchrony. The risks and benefits of deep sedation in
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) are complex33, and the sedation strategy that most
effectively balances patient-specific risks and benefits in SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown. Heavy
sedation is likely to affect EEG sensitivity and specificity and has not been considered in all prior
SARS-CoV-2 EEG reports. Given that several of our EEGs were prompted by convulsions in the
setting of weaning sedation, we recommend anticipating whether and when attempts will be
made to decrease sedation during long-term EEGs.

EEG and SARS-CoV-2 Safety Considerations
As the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 continues, there will be increasing need to
safely perform diagnostic tests that were previously routine34,35. To date there has been no clear
transmission within or from our division. However, there is limited data to guide safety protocols
and limit iatrogenic spread, including among healthcare workers36. Protocols are likely to depend
on local PPE availability and evolving understandings of COVID-19 spread. The benefits of
masking patients remains uncertain, and exhalation airflow is redirected by masks, potentially
flowing superiorly, with unclear consequences for EEG technicians who often stand above
patients’ heads37. Tracking healthcare related cases of SARS-CoV-2 would be helpful to
understand risks of transmission to and from specific provider roles.

Limitations
Our study has several imitations. This case series was drawn from a single center in order to
evaluate data efficiently, albeit from a hospital with the largest caseload in a state considered one
of the United States’ early epicenters. The series was also relatively small, though to our
knowledge, this is the largest known series to date of patients receiving standard EEGs for any
coronavirus. All EEGs were ordered at the discretion of providers, which may introduce clinical
biases that may limit generalizability to patients who do not prompt such studies. Our rate of
electrographic seizures and estimated confidence interval, however, agrees with other, smaller
series, suggesting a ≤8% rate of seizures even in such selected populations3,38–40. This series
included a heterogeneous population, including some patients who appeared asymptomatic from
a respiratory perspective. Asymptomatic patients will likely form an increasing portion of SARSCoV-2 studies as both viral spread and testing increase. Additionally, while we have shared the
specific safety protocols undertaken by our division at this time, we anticipate that protocols will
evolve as more is learned.

Conclusion
EEG provides a dynamic window into the dramatic ways in which the minds and brains of our
patients are affected by the systemic, neurologic, and psychosocial consequences of SARS-CoV2. Epileptiform abnormalities were common in patients with SARS-CoV-2 referred for EEG and
were associated with preexisting brain pathology. These findings suggest that the neurologic
consequences of SARS-CoV-2, including seizures and encephalopathy, may not relate solely to
infection itself, but also to how neurologically vulnerable patients are affected more broadly,
including the ways in which we care for them.

Figure Legends

Figure 1 Representative EEGs from Patients with SARS-CoV-2
(A) Example EEG of a patient with SARS-CoV-2 who was not intubated and not receiving
generalized sedation, with absent posterior dominant rhythm and the presence of
generalized theta slowing. For all panels, data was filtered with a bandpass filter between
1-70Hz and a notch filter at 60 Hz. EEG is shown in black in a longitudinal bipolar
montage, EKG is shown in red. The sensitivity is indicated in blue for each panel.
(B) Example EEG of a patient with SARS-CoV-2 who had nonconvulsive status epilepticus
as described in the Results, with generalized periodic discharges with sharp wave
morphology at a frequency of 3-4 Hz when propofol was held.
(C) Example EEG of a patient with SARS-CoV-2 with multiple discharge morphologies,
including both triphasic and otherwise generalized sharp wave morphologies.
