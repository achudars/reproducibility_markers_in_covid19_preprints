Abstract
Background: The epidemiology of COVID-19 in retirement homes (also known as assisted living

facilities) is largely unknown. We examined the association between retirement home and

community level characteristics and the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks in retirement homes during

the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic.

Methods: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of licensed retirement

homes in Ontario, Canada, from March 1st - September 24th, 2020. Our primary outcome was a

≥1 resident or staff confirmed case by validated nucleic acid amplification

COVID-19 outbreak (

assay). We used time-dependent proportional hazards methods to model the associations

between retirement home and community level characteristics and COVID-19 outbreaks.

Results: Our cohort included all 770 licensed retirement homes in Ontario, which housed

56,491 residents. There were 172 (22.3%) COVID-19 retirement home outbreaks involving

1,045 (1.9%) residents and 548 staff (1.5%). COVID-19 cases were distributed unevenly across

retirement homes, with 1,593 (92.2%) resident and staff cases occurring in 77 (10%) of homes.

The adjusted hazard of a COVID-19 outbreak in a retirement home was positively associated

with homes that had a large resident capacity, homes that were co-located with a long-term

care facility, large corporate owned chains, homes that offered many services onsite, increases

in regional COVID-19 incidence, and a higher community-level ethnic concentration.

Interpretation: Readily identifiable retirement home-level characteristics are independently

associated with COVID-19 outbreaks and may support risk identification. A higher ethnic

concentration of the community surrounding a retirement home is associated COVID-19

outbreaks, with an uncertain mechanism.

Introduction
Frail older adults living in congregate care settings have been at the centre of the

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Canada and internationally (1,2). Long-term

care (LTC) facilities—the congregate living population most affected by COVID-19—have been

the subject of immense scientific and public interest during the pandemic (3). Retirement

homes (often known as assisted living facilities) have received far less examination despite also

housing a large population of vulnerable older adults (4–7). Retirement homes are

predominantly private residential complexes that provide a range of services (e.g., ADL

assistance, meals, medication management) that are typically less-intensive compared to LTC

facilities. They are almost exclusively financed through out-of-pocket payments by residents or

their families (8), and the lack of consistent regulation throughout Canada and the United

States has limited research into the epidemiology of COVID-19 in retirement homes (9).

There are close to 800 licensed retirement homes in Canada’s most populous province

of Ontario that house over 50,000 older adults, a population size that approaches the number

of Ontario LTC home residents (10). Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, the

number of positive cases and deaths in retirement homes continued to grow. As of November

16th, 2020, retirement home residents accounted for approximately 8% of COVID-19 deaths in

Ontario (287/3505) (11). COVID-19 outbreaks have surged in retirement homes during the

second wave in Canada and the United States (11,12), with limited examination beyond early

reports of case identification (13).

We examined the association between home and community level characteristics and

the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Ontario’s

retirement homes. Consistent with our previous population-level work in Ontario LTC homes

(2,14), we hypothesized that home size and regional COVID-19 incidence would be associated

with the risk of an outbreak.

Methods
Study design

We conducted a retrospective cohort study across all retirement homes in Ontario,

th

Canada from March 1st, 2020 until September 24

2020; spanning the entirety of Ontario’s first

wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (15). In Ontario, retirement homes are defined in legislation

(similar to other North American jurisdictions) as residential complexes that are occupied

primarily by persons who are 65 years of age or older and have at least two of thirteen care

services available (Appendix 1)(16,17). Our study was approved by the Hamilton Integrated

Research Ethics Board. We adhered to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational

Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline and the Reporting of Studies Conducted

Using Observational Routinely-Collected Health Data (RECORD) statement guidelines (Appendix

2) (18,19).

Data sources

Data used for this study were obtained from the Ontario Retirement Homes Regulatory

Authority (RHRA) and Ontario Ministry of Health as part of the COVID-19 Ontario Consensus

Modelling Table. We obtained home-level daily COVID-19 case counts and deaths among

retirement home residents and staff (in home or hospital) from the RHRA through their COVID

Tracking Tool. These data, which include the date on which a COVID-19 outbreak was declared

and deemed resolved, were collected through daily direct inquires by the RHRA and through

self-reports by licensed retirement homes to the RHRA and have recently been publicly

reported (11). Licensed retirement homes are required to report COVID-19 outbreaks to the

RHRA at the same time they are reported to their local public health units. Data from the

tracking tool correlated closely with other provincial data sources including the integrated

Public Health Information System, the Ontario Laboratory Information System, and a death

database maintained by the Ontario Chief Coroner’s office, and have been used in COVID-19

research in LTC homes (2,14).

Exposures

We obtained home-level exposure data from the provincial registry of licensed

retirement homes, which contains data on resident capacity, co-location with a LTC facility, and

the availability of care services onsite for all retirement homes in Ontario. The RHRA is

legislatively mandated to maintain the registry as the provincial retirement homes regulator.

Home size was based on reported resident capacity and assigned to quintiles. Co-location of the

retirement home with a LTC facility was identified by RHRA records as those homes sharing the

same physical building or situated on the same site. Information on chain ownership was

supplied by the RHRA, and homes were classified as being members of a small (2 to 5 homes),

medium (6 to 20 homes) or large (>20 homes) chain, or not part of a chain. The RHRA maintains

a list of 13 services offered (Appendix 1) and a home’s services were summed and assigned to

the following categories: ≤6, 7, 8, or ≥9 services.

We obtained data on home level occupancy, staffing counts, and external care providers

from an RHRA survey of all retirement homes conducted in May 2020 (home level response =

92.7%). External care providers come into the home either as contracted workers of the

publicly funded home care program, or by private pay arrangement with residents. A staff to

resident ratio comprising both types of external care providers was calculated based on the

home survey response values and assigned to quartiles.

We obtained the daily incidence of COVID-19 across Ontario’s 36 public health regions

from Public Health Ontario’s integrated Public Health Information System (20,21). Time varying

COVID-19 incidence was calculated each day as the rolling 14-day incidence per 1000

population for the public health unit in which the retirement home resided. We chose a rolling

14-day incidence based on the trend of community incidence rates (See Appendix 3 and 4). We

conducted a sensitivity analysis using a 30-day time period, as well as by centering the index

day in the rolling average period. We obtained linked data on community-level median

household income and ethnic concentration from the Ontario Ministry of Health based on the

2016 Canadian Census and the Ontario Marginalization Index, respectively. We obtained the

neighbourhood-level ethnic concentration surrounding each retirement home, which is

defined as the combined proportions non-white and non-Indigenous residents and immigrants

that arrived in Canada within the past five years, based on the 2016 Canadian Census (22,23).

The population size situating each retirement home was calculated using Statistics Canada’s

Postal Code Conversion File Plus (PCCF+), using postal codes from the Canada Post Corporation

which were current up to and including November 2018; communities with a population size of

<10,000 individuals are rural (24).

≥1 resident or staff case confirmed by

Our primary outcome was a COVID-19 outbreak (

validated nucleic acid amplification assay)

Statistical Analysis

Summary statistics were computed to compare, by COVID-19 outbreak status,

retirement home and community level characteristics. The Chi-square test was used for

categorical variables and the Kruskal-Wallis test was used for continuous variables. Case fatality

rates were calculated as the proportion of residents who died of COVID-19 compared to the

total number of residents infected with COVID-19.

We used Cox proportional hazards to model the associations between retirement home

and community level characteristics and the risk of a COVID-19 outbreak. Community incidence

of COVID-19 was a time-varying covariate, with all other measures being fixed. A retirement

home was at risk of experiencing an event on all days (March 1 to September 24, 2020), except

for days in which the home was experiencing an outbreak. When an outbreak was over the

home returned to being at risk for a future outbreak. To account for correlation between

observations within public health units and multiple outbreaks within the same retirement

homes, we applied a robust sandwich estimator for the covariance matrix. We built

multivariable models using a manual, forward selection approach, with community size forced

into the model given its strong association with risk of outbreak in previous work. Selection

proceeded in ascending order of bivariate p-values, retaining only variables with a p <0.05 in

the multivariable model. After the initial forward selection, all unselected variables were again

tested individually in the model, and retained if p <0.05. Finally, two-way interactions among

selected covariates were examined. We examined the proportionality of hazards assumption

using Kaplan-Meier plots and time-varying covariates. Some explanatory variables represented

as quintiles were collapsed to three-levels to comply with proportionality requirements.

Results
COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in Retirement Homes

The analysis included all 770 licensed retirement homes in Ontario as of March 1st 2020.

Overall, 172 (22.3%) retirement homes experienced one or more COVID-19 outbreaks as of

th

September 24

2020, with 154 (20.0%) having one outbreak and 18 (2.33%) having two

outbreaks. COVID-19 outbreaks in this period involved 1,045 (1.9%) infected residents and 548

infected staff (1.5%) (Table 1). Over 90% of outbreaks occurred before June 2020 (Appendix 3).

Almost half of all outbreaks involved both staff and resident cases, with outbreaks involving

staff cases being more common than those that involved resident cases. The crude cumulative

incidence of COVID-19 among residents was 18.5 per thousand. In homes with a resident

infection, the median number of residents infected was 2 (IQR: 1-13). COVID-19 infection was

distributed unevenly across retirement homes: 1,593 (92.2%) resident and staff cases occurred

in 77 (10%) of homes. There were 51 (6.6%) retirement homes with outbreaks resulting in one

or more resident deaths, accounting for a total of 215 resident COVID-19 deaths (3.8 per 1,000

residents in Ontario) and a case fatality rate of 20.5%.

Retirement Home Characteristics by Outbreak Status

Retirement homes housed 56,491 residents with an average of approximately 73

residents and 48 staff per home and an overall occupancy rate of 74.2% (Table 2). The majority

of retirement homes had a capacity of over 100 residents, had external care providers that

entered the home daily, were corporate-owned chains, were located in communities with

larger populations and lower ethnic concentration, and offered more than 6 services to their

residents on-site. The minority of retirement homes were co-located with a LTC facility.

Compared to retirement homes without outbreaks, those that experienced one or more COVID-

19 outbreaks were more likely to have larger capacity, be part of a corporate-owned chain,

have external care providers entering the home on a daily basis, have more services available to

their residents onsite, and be located in larger communities with a higher ethnic concentration.

Risk of a COVID-19 outbreak

Increases in regional COVID-19 incidence during the Wave 1 period were strongly

associated with COVID-19 outbreaks in retirement homes, where a 1 case per 1,000 person

increase in the previous 14 days was associated with a 5.83-fold increase in the hazard of an

outbreak (Table 3). In addition to regional COVID-19 incidence, the adjusted hazard of a COVID-

19 outbreak was positively associated with homes that had a large resident capacity, large

corporate owned chains, homes that were co-located with a LTC facility (adjusted hazard ratio

[aHR], 1.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-2.74), homes that offered many services onsite,

and a higher community-level ethnic concentration. There was pattern of more COVID-19

outbreaks in retirement homes with a higher community-level ethnic concentration across

public health regions (Figure 1).

Interpretation
In this study of all 770 retirement homes in Ontario, Canada, we found that the hazard

of a COVID-19 outbreak was positively associated with increases in regional COVID-19

incidence, homes that had a large resident capacity, homes that were co-located with a LTC

facility, large corporate owned chains, homes that offered many services onsite, and a higher

community-level ethnic concentration. We identify risk factors for COVID-19 outbreaks in

retirement homes that can inform risk identification at the provincial and regional level, as has

been done for the LTC sector (25).

Consistent with LTC facilities (26,27), our findings support that the incidence of COVID-

19 in a public health region, large chains, and the size of retirement homes are important risk

factors for COVID-19 outbreaks. We found a strong association between retirement home

outbreaks and the 14-day rolling incidence of COVID-19 in the surrounding public health region,

which aligns with the temporal relationship between community COVID-19 incidence and LTC

outbreaks (28). Also consistent with the literature on COVID-19 and LTC (2,14), we found that

home capacity was associated with risk of COVID-19 outbreaks such that retirement homes

with a capacity greater than 100 residents had more than a 5-fold increase in risk of outbreak.

Larger homes require more staff, which likely increases the number of potential individuals who

are unknowingly importing COVID-19 into homes. Given that the majority of COVID-19 cases

were accumulated early in Wave 1 during the period when visitors to retirement homes were

severely restricted (Appendix 3), it is probable that retirement home staff and care providers

were the main vectors for seeding COVID-19 infection into retirement homes (29). The lack of

an adjusted association between the external care providers and COVID-19 outbreak might be

explained by the lack of variability between retirement homes of the same size. Homes that

offered 9 or more services had an almost 2-fold increase in risk for a COVID-19 outbreak. This

likely reflects the additional exposure to SARS-COV-2 associated with additional and more

lengthy interactions between staff and residents who require such services.

Retirement homes that are co-located with a LTC facility had an almost 2-fold increase

in risk for a COVID-19 outbreak. This finding could reflect staff working between homes, which

has been linked to the transmission of COVID-19 between LTC facilities (25,30). Despite

provincial orders restricting work at multiple healthcare settings within a 14-day period,

emerging evidence suggests that residual connectivity between congregate living settings exists

and could represent temporary agency workers and contract staff which are exempted from

the provincial order (31). A reduction in mobility of staff between retirement and LTC homes

may reduce the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks in co-located retirement homes during successive

waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We observed an association between levels of ethnic concentration in the community

surrounding a retirement home and the risk of COVID-19 outbreak, even after adjusting for

regional COVID-19 rates and community level household income. Public Health Ontario reports

demonstrate that ethno-culturally dense neighbourhoods experience disproportionately higher

rates of COVID-19 (32). LTC facilities that care for more racial and ethnic minority residents

report higher COVID-19 cases and/or deaths (33). Our finding may relate, at least partly, to

cultural patterns of care and connection for older family members. However, we could not

examine the complex relationship between COVID-19 and ethno-cultural characteristics in our

analyses, and further data collection and analysis are needed to understand this mechanism.

Comparable to many emerging and rapidly collected sources of COVID-19 data, we

could not independently validate completeness with respect to COVID-19 infections and deaths

at the home level. We also could not account for temporal changes in infection prevention and

control practices and changing provincial policies that may have influenced these results. Our

study was limited by the lack of individual level data on clinical, organizational, and

sociocultural characteristics that may differ across homes. A better understanding of the

complex relationships between COVID-19 and ethno-cultural characteristics require further

data at the individual level. Our adjustment of regional COVID-19 incidence may have caused

over-adjustment given that some community cases may have been secondary to retirement

home cases.

In conclusion, we find that the risk of a COVID-19 outbreak in retirement homes is

associated with larger resident capacity, co-location with a LTC facility, large corporate owned

chains, a higher availability of services onsite, and increases in regional COVID-19 incidence. For

retirement homes co-located with a LTC facility, a reduction in staff mobility between settings is

a potentially modifiable factor that may reduce the risk of future COVID-19 outbreaks.

Increased ethnic concentration of the community surrounding a retirement home is associated

COVID-19 outbreaks, with an uncertain mechanism. Identifying and understanding observed

differences in COVID-19 outbreaks across retirement homes may inform risk identification and

prevention.
