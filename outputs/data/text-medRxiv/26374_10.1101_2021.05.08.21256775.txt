Summary
Variants of concern (VOC) in SARS-CoV-2 refer to viral genomes that differ
significantly from the ancestor virus and that show the potential for higher
transmissibility and/or worse clinical progression. VOC have the potential to disrupt
ongoing public health measures and vaccine efforts. Yet, little is known regarding
how frequently different viral variants emerge and under what circumstances. We
report a longitudinal study to determine the degree of SARS-CoV-2 sequence
evolution in 94 COVID-19 cases and to estimate the frequency at which highly
diverse variants emerge. 2 cases accumulated ≥9 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs)
over a two-week period and 1 case accumulated 23 SNVs over a three-week period,
including three non-synonymous mutations in the Spike protein (D138H, E554D,
D614G). We estimate that in 2% of COVID cases, viral variants with multiple
mutations, including in the Spike glycoprotein, can become the dominant strains in
as little as one month of persistent in patient virus replication. This suggests the
continued local emergence of VOC independent of travel patterns. Surveillance by
sequencing for (i) viremic COVID-19 patients, (ii) patients suspected of re-infection,
and (iii) patients with diminished immune function may offer broad public health
benefits.

Introduction
The B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) (20I/501Y.V1, S
mutations N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A, D1118H) arose because
of long-term viral replication in an immunocompromised person in the UK . Several
other case studies also attribute the emergenes of highly divergent variants to
suggesting that intra-host evolution reflects a
persistently infected patients
general mechanism for the continued emergence of highly divergent, potentially
more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants. Each of these singular events has been
linked to extraordinary clinical circumstances.
The rapid spread of the Spike protein D614G variant, which only had a single
point mutation as compared to the earliest human isolate (SARSCoV2/hu/CHN/Wuhan-Hu-1/2019), shows that novel SARS-CoV-2 variants can
rapidly take over the population . Viral varients are more transmissible due to a
variety of phenotypes, such as higher genome copy numbers in nasal secretions,
increased environmental stability, or better / broader receptor utilization. Other
mechanisms are possible as well, including the ability to maintain longer shedding
periods, which we define as persistence, upon infection. Exactly, how frequent new
VOC arise in persistently infected COVID-19 patients is unknown.
VOC refer to viral genome sequences that differ dramatically from their most
common recorded ancestor, typically by ≥3 single nucleotide variations (SNVs),
typically with non-synonymous mutations in the Spike (S) glycoprotein. In the
literature, VOC display increased infectivity in tissue culture, increased human-tohuman transmission patterns, and worse clinical outcome. VOC are predicted to
have decreased vaccine-induced neutralization and to be resistant to therapy using
monoclonal antibodies. As, VOC have the potential to render ongoing public health
measures and vaccine efforts ineffective it is important to identify situations that
foster the emergence of VOC.
In addition to B.1.1.7 (20I/501Y.V1) first recognized in the UK, the US CDC
lists B.1.351 (20H/501.V2, S mutations: K417N, E484K, N501Y, D614G, A701V),
first recognized in South Africa, and B.1.1.28.1 (P1/20J/501Y.V3, S mutations:
L18F, T20N, P26S, D128Y, R190S, K417T, E484K, N501Y, D614G, H655Y, T1027I)
first reported in Brazil as VOC. Sequencing surveys identify new VOCs almost daily
such as B.1.429 and B.1.427 (CAL.20C, S mutations: S13I, W152C, L452R, D614G
or S mutation: L452R), which are rapidly expanding and are associated with worse
clinical outcome .
An open question in the field is whether VOC emergence represents a
singular, low frequency event in time and space , in which case travel restrictions
would be an appropriate measure of containment, or if VOC continuously and
repeatedly emerge in local communities. In the latter case, surveillance by whole
genome sequencing would be an urgent and prudent course of action. This study
estimates that approximately 2% of persistently infected COVID patients develop
highly divergent variants in as little as three weeks.

Results
We identified n=94 cases of COVID-19 with 2 or more positive SARS-CoV-2
tests (Figure 1A). The case definition included cases where intermittent viral load
assays were negative, as it is not possible, a priori, to distinguish between
persistent replication below the level of detection and independent reinfection. The
median age was 52.6±17.4 years (mean ± sd); 3 participants were under the age
of 18. 40/94 (43%) of participants were female. The cases covered the period from
April 1, 2020, to October 17, 2020. During that time the COVID-19 epidemic was
accelerating in the local community and was primarily driven by symptomatic
transmission events . As most of the data were from de-identified patient records,
the clinical presentations of each case could not be conclusively established. The
inclusion criterion was solely based on viral detection (positive/negative) by CLIA
assay in two consecutive NP swabs.
All participants had detectable viral load at baseline. At subsequent time
points, relative log viral genome copy number, as measured in RT-QPCR cycle
number threshold (CT), declined in most cases as indicated by higher CT values
(Figure 1B). In many samples, genome copy numbers at late time points were
near the limit of detection (CT>30). This was expected since even during acute
symptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2, genome copy numbers peak during a few
days over the course of infection. All samples were subjected to targeted
amplification of SARS-CoV-2 and next-generation sequencing (NGS) as described
previously .
Most participants did not have high enough viral RNA levels at time points
subsequent to baseline to generate sufficient reads to yield complete genome-wide
coverage at the required sequencing depth. Nevertheless, NGS conclusively
confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the real-time RT-QPCR positive
samples and in none of the RT-QPCR negative samples. The number of mapped
reads showed a log-linear relationship to CT (Figure 1C) for CT values ≤ 24.71
( CI: 19.11-33.60) and was uncorrelated for samples with CT > 24.71. As
expected. more mapped reads correlated with higher overall genome coverage
(Figure 1D). These performance characteristics are in line with other studies.
To ascertain the linear range for SNV calling a dilution series of SARS-CoV2/hu/USA/WA1/2020 was generated (Table 1). Only single nucleotide variants
(SNV) with QUAL scores > 200, as called by samtools , were included in
subsequent analyses. The SARS-CoV-2/hu/USA/WA1/2020 stock has 8 SNVs as
compared to SARS-CoV2/hu/CHN/Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 (NC_045512). These 8 SNVs
were recovered over a dilution range of 4 log orders of magnitude down to a limit
of detection of 7 pfu/ml. The experiment was repeated with an artificial RNA
substrate carrying 428 single point mutations and the same dilution range. From
this, 423 single-point mutations were consistently sequenced over the entire
dilution range. This experiment demonstrates that the limit of detection for NGSbased SNV typing is at or below the detection limit of viral culture. By implication
every variant sequence reported here represents infectious virus, rather than
residual fragments of viral RNA.
Sequence diversity in the data set is based on individual SNV that could be
ascertained with high confidence. A total of n = 882 SNVs passed the QC filters.
Figure 2A shows the average number of SNVs for each sample (n=86). The mode

was 11, two samples had n≥20 and n≥40 SNVs, respectively, which indicate a
highly divergent viral variant. The majority of SNVs detected had >90% frequency
in the sample (Figure 2B), although a subset of samples also had SNVs with lower
frequency. SNVs with <50% frequency were excluded from the analyses presented
here, although minority variants down to 10% frequency were reliably identified.
Hence, pair-wise comparisons between samples represent a lower limit of sequence
divergence over time. Figure 2C depicts the counts of non-synonymous SNVs for
each SARS-CoV-2 gene across all samples. As expected total SNV counts correlate
with the gene size. Also indicated are the SNV frequencies for each gene.
It is not possible, a priori, to decide whether a new SNV is the result of de
novo mutation during persistence in the host or selection of a strain that was
present at with a frequency below the limit of detection at the initial time point of
infection. Figure 2D shows the empirical density distribution of Hamming distances
among all samples. The Hamming distance is defined as the minimum number of
substitutions between any two sequences. It is less or equal to the genetic distance
and not dependent on the time or the rate of evolution. Hence, it represents a
lower limit on genetic diversity. Paired samples, i.e., samples from participants with
two consecutive timepoints that each yielded enough material for sequencing are
indicated by blue lines. The majority of pairs had smaller than mean Hamming
distances, consistent with the hypothesis that intra-host replication accumulates
fewer mutations than inter-host transmission. Two paired samples had Hamming
distances that were larger than the mode, indicative of accelerated intra-host
evolution during persistence or a second, independent re-infection event.
The null hypothesis stipulates that upon infection SARS-CoV-2 replicates
rapidly, synchronously, and without accumulating mutations due to the intrinsic low
error rate of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of the Coronaviridae as well as
limited host selection pressure prior to the onset of adaptive immunity. Most
symptomatic COVID-19 cases are viremic for two weeks or less
. Consistent
with this hypothesis, 4 pairs of participant sequences were identified with ≤ 1 SNV
difference across the entire genome. These represent the prototypical infection
scenario for coronaviruses.
Other cases accumulated more SNVs. Figure 3A depicts a phylogenetic tree
obtained from the multiple alignments of n=48 completely-sequenced SARS-CoV-2
genomes (data available at GISAID). In addition to samples from this study the first
two SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases in the catchment area were included: hCoV19/USA/NC-CDC-6999/2020 from March 3, 2020 (2020-03-03), which is a Spike
(S) 614D variant and hCoV-19/USA/NC-CDC-0034/2020 from March 8, 2020
(2020-03-08), which is an S 614G variant. The reference genome SARS-CoV-2
SARS-CoV2/hu/CHN/Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 was set as root. The tree was generated
from a MAFFT alignment further processed by MrBayes (HKY85 substitution model
with unconstrained branch length using SARS-CoV-2 SARS-CoV2/hu/CHN/WuhanHu-1/2019 as outgroup). The monophyletic sequence pairs in blue
(LCCC0230/LCCC0235, LCCC0246/LCCC0247, LCCC0220/LCCC0224, LCCC0192/
LCCC0228) conform to the null hypothesis of limited intra-host evolution. These
pairs accumulated ≤1 SNV over a two-week period (range: 7-19 days) and
represent stable, canonical infection events.
The two sequence pairs LCCC0233/ LCCC0239 and LCCC0238/ LCCC236
represent cases where 9 SNVs accumulated over 15 days and 23 SNVs over 18

days, respectively. This resulted in the sequences being distant on the phylogenetic
tree. LCCC0233/ LCCC0239 differed by the presence of the S D614G mutation that
is associated with high transmissibility and biological fitness in culture
. Their
pattern was inconsistent with the null hypothesis and supports scenarios of either
accelerated intra-host evolution or independent superinfection.
It was difficult to obtain high-quality, whole-genome sequences from samples
with low genome copy numbers. To expand the set of paired samples available for
analysis, additional genomes were analyzed even if they were incomplete (> 1000
N at 1x coverage). This was possible because even for incompletely covered
genomes, individual SNVs, relative to the reference, could be ascertained with high
confidence (QUAL scores > 200). This yielded an extended pool of n=67 samples,
including the prior samples with complete genomes, which were used to construct a
Hamming-distance matrix. Figure 3B shows a neighbor-joining tree based on this
matrix and rooted at SARS-CoV2/hu/CHN/Wuhan-Hu-1/2019. The clustering by
informative SNVs alone was consistent with the clustering based on analysis of the
entire viral genome sequences as expected. The expanded data identified 6 paired
samples, which diverged only minimally from each other during the observation
period of 7, 10, 15, 19, 26, 31 days, respectively. By contrast, 3 sample pairs that
were not consistent with the null hypothesis of limited intra-host evolution. These
three pairs represent SARS-CoV-2 strains that have diverged significantly from the
initial isolate over a period of 15, 17, and 18 days, respectively. Note how the
observation periods for the two groups overlap: over a time range of 7-31 days, the
majority of patients accumulated ≤1 SNV, a minority accumulated ≥ 9 SNV in the
SARS-CoV-2 genome. This demonstrates that the conditions under which VOC could
evolve are present in a significant fraction of COVID-19 patients with detectable
viral loads at greater two weeks past infection.
To put these samples in the context of the local sequence diversity, an
additional 226 whole-genome sequences that were generated from the same
participant pool by the same technology and bioinformatic pipeline were assembled
and a timed consensus tree generated using BEAST (Figure 4). The result was
consistent with exponential growth during the observation period. The SARSCoV2/hu/CHN/Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 genome was set as root. The two initial isolates in
the state of North Carolina, one representing the D614 clade (SARS-CoV2/human/USA/NC-CDC-6999/2020) and the other the G614 clade (SARS-CoV2/human/USA/NC-CDC-0034/2020) were added for orientation. The resultant
phylogram again identified the same four pairs as before, representing minimal
intra-host evolution as well as the two pairs that did not cluster together and
represent accelerated intra-host evolution. The paired samples belonged to
different lineages (PANGO classification), as evidenced by their distribution among
the other samples. This suggests that different evolutionary speeds are not the
property of a rare mutator varient of SARS-CoV-2 but represent independent
events that took place repeatedly.
Two scenarios could account for these observations. First, in some patients,
SARS-CoV-2 evolution and mutation rates were accelerated as compared to rates
determined by molecular clock phylogenies of inter-host events. This scenario also
includes the sequential emergence and/or disappearance of dominant
subpopulations. Second, an independent infection event, i.e., superinfection, took
place prior to the last sampled time point. Sequence analysis alone cannot

distinguish between these two scenarios. Assuming that the patients were in
isolation during hospitalization and followed CDC guidelines regarding quarantine
and masking for patients who have recovered from COVID-19, a superinfection
event seemed less likely than persistent infection, but it remains a formal
possibility. In sum, this study supports the idea of intra-host evolution during the
persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in a significant number of infections that can server as a
reservoir for the continued emergence of highly divergent variants, including VOC.

Discussion
The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in NC was seeded by two singular events, one
introducing the D614 variant strain on March 03, 2020, and another event
introducing the G614 variant strain on March 13, 2020 . Since then, we surveyed
SARS-CoV-2 infected persons by NGS. This cohort identified 94 patients who were
SARS-CoV-2 positive on at least two occasions as determined by real-time RT-QPCR
under CLIA-compliant diagnostic testing. 6 patients had ≤1 SNV difference for
samples drawn approximately 14 days apart. 3 patients had accumulated ≥1 SNV
during the same time period. One participant had accumulated 23 SNV over a 19day period. The three participants with extensive viral evolution had potentially
comorbid conditions: one participant had a history of infections, another had
diabetes mellitus.
First, these data demonstrate that the majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections
follows a paradigm of limited intra-host viral evolution consistent with the absence
of selection in a naïve host and are consistent with the reported mutation rate of ~
.
1 SNV per genome per 14 days
Second, these data demonstrate that reinfection is a possibility in persons
previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, which is consistent with an ever-increasing
. It is curious that the one potential reinfection case
number of case studies
with the largest numbers of SNV displayed the earliest isolate carrying the S D614
SNV and the second infection was with the more transmissible and infectious S
G614 variant, akin to the report by To et al. . We speculate that natural infection
with one receptor-binding domain (RBD) variant may not protect extremely well
against infection with an RBD second variant, even though vaccination does .
This finding affirms the recommendation for universal vaccination even for persons
previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
Third, these data demonstrate that variants with a large number of SNVs
regularly emerge in persons that carry SARS-CoV-2 as early as two weeks after
primary exposure. Accelerated evolution has been described for coronaviruses, e.g.,
those carrying a mutator polymerase or exposed to a mutating drug . Accelerated
evolution can also be achieved by sequential bottlenecks, such as generated during
persistent low-level infection where the host immune responses dramatically
. Even under the conservative
decimate, but never fully eradicate the virus
assumptions of (a) the one most divergent sample in our study being due to
reinfection with an unrelated strain and (b) the other persistently positive patients
in the cohort, for which a second genome sample was incomplete, having no SNVs,

we estimate that highly divergent variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge at a frequency of
2/94 (2%) among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
There are limitations to this study. First, it is a single center study biased
towards patients with severe clinical disease rather than a population-based
sample. This contrasts with the majority of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons, who do
not require hospitalization. Second, many participants did not have enough viral
RNA at time points subsequent to baseline for NGS to yield complete genome
coverage. This was expected as in most cases, viral RNA is detectable by swab of
the nasopharyngeal cavity (NP-swab) 2-3 days before onset of symptoms (presymptomatic), but rapidly disappears within 5 days after clinical symptom onset
. The genome copy numbers reported here are consistent with a report of 35
RT-QPCR positive specimens that were collected at >10 days after symptom onset,
and that failed to yield infectious virus upon culture
. Control experiments
established that complete genome coverage and confident SNV detection was
possible down to a limit of 7 pfu/ml; however, it is possible that persistent intrahost replication predominanty leads to the accumulation of fragmented viral
genomes or debilitated viral particles with low transmission potential as the intrahost selection pressures differ from the selection pressures that lead to increased
transmissibility between hosts.
In sum, this study suggests that widely divergent SARS-CoV-2 variants,
including VOC, will continually emerge spontaneously as long as there is significant
community infection (often stipulated as above 100/100.000 cases over a 1 week
period). Intensified, repeat monitoring by sequencing of hospitalized COVID-19
patients and infected at-risk persons, such as persons on immunosuppression or
cancer chemotherapy , is useful in identifying new VOC. It may have direct clinical
as well as public health benefits. This study also supports the notion that wide-scale
vaccination efforts are needed at a global level to lower the spread of SARS-CoV-2
in the human population and thus prevent the emergence of new VOC.

Experimental Model and Subject Details
Sample Collection and Deidentification
This study used remnant samples of universal transport media (UTM) from
provider-collected deep nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs after their clinical purpose had
been completed. The SARS-CoV-2 status of each sample was determined at The
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Medical Center (UNCMC) McLendon
Clinical laboratories. None of the samples carried any identifiers other than the date
of testing, age, and sex. Sample use was approved under human subjects
approvals # 20-2448 and # 13-2140 by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the
University of North Carolina; CB 7097, 720 Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. Bldg # 385,
Second Floor, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7097.

Method Detail
RNA isolation
RNA was isolated using a Roche Magnapure 24 instrument and kits according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, 200 µL of UTM were neutralized with the
addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 (proteomics grade, VWR: 97063-864) and 1X
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Life Technologies, Catalog # 14190-144) to a final
volume of 1.0 mL. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes in
a barcoded 2.0 mL screw cap tube (Roche, 07857551001) vortexing every 5
minutes for 15-second pulses. The solution was then processed through the
Magnapure 24 instrument using the total nucleic acid extraction protocol. The
MagNA Pure 24 Total NA Isolation kit was used for RNA extraction (Roche,
07658036001). Carrier RNA (Macherey-Nagel, 740514) was added to a final
concentration of 9 ng/µL. For each processing batch, a negative reagent control and
a negative cell pellet control were used. The reagent control consisted of 250 µL of

1X PBS instead of 250 µL of the sample in UTM. The 100 µL of purified RNA was
processed for sequencing and viral load as described below.
Real-time qPCR
Relative viral genome copy number and cycle thresholds (Ct) was
ascertained by real-time qPCR using primers and procedures previously published
and a protocol previously described . In brief, 30 µL input RNA was subjected to
random hexamer-primed reverse transcription using the High-Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, 4368814). 9 µl cDNA was used for
qPCR containing 125 nM for each primer and SYBR green as the method of
detection on a Roche LC480II Lightcycler and Ct values determined by an
automated threshold method.

Next-Generation Sequencing
Amplicon-based next-generation sequencing was performed using the
Thermo SARS-CoV-2 Ampliseq kit. We used Genomic RNA from SARS-CoV-2,
Isolate USA-WA1/2020, as a positive control (BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH: NR52285). All samples were sequenced using random hexamer/oligo dT priming
according to the manufacturer’s protocol on an Ion Torrent Chef (ThermoFisher
4484177) using Ion S5 Chef Solutions (ThermoFisher A27754). Samples were then
loaded onto the IonTorrent S5 sequencer (ThermoFisher A27212) equipped with
530 Chip (ThermoFisher A27763). The amplicons are tightly tiled and overlapping.
Amplicon sizes ranged between 68 and 232 nucleotides after trimming of lowquality sequences (Q20) and primer sequences (125-275 before trimming).
Bioinformatic analysis
Following primer trimming according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations, additional, custom steps were added. Specifically, all sequences
were quality trimmed using the bbduk script (arguments: qtrim=rl trimq=20
maq=20 minlen=40 tpe tbo) from bbmap version 37.36. The trimmed reads were
mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence (Accession: NC_045512) using
bbmap. From each mapping, the following was collected: sequence variants,
mapping coverage, and a consensus sequence. Sequence variants were called from
the mapping file using samtools and bcftools . Mapping coverage was generated
using ‘Deeptools’ bamCoverage . Sequence variants and mapping coverage were
used to build the consensus sequences using bcftools. Only variants with a reported
QUAL greater than 200 were included in the consensus and any region with 0x
coverage were masked with Ns inserted for ambiguity. All consensus sequences
derived from this study were curated to revert poly-nucleotide-tract mutations to
the reference sequence. Lineages were assigned using Pangolin v.2.0 . Complete
genomes have been submitted to GISAID and raw reads to SRA archives.

nucleotide rate variation with unequal branch lengths. NC_045512 was used as an
outgroup.
For alignment of all NC sequences as obtained from GISAID, MAFFT, and
RAxML or FastTree was used for initial alignment. The alignment was exported and
used as input for a time-scaled Bayesian Tree was generated using BEAST v1.10.4,
with the BEAGLE v3.1.0 library program . Estimated base frequencies using the
Gamma distribution site model was selected. For the tree prior, the coalescent
exponential growth rate was selected, using a random starting tree and a strict
molecular clock. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chain length was set to
10,000,000 steps sampling after every 1000 steps (5-7). Trees were annotated
using TreeAnnotator v1.10.4 and viewed on FigTree v1.4.4. Trace files were viewed
on Tracer v1.7.1 and all ESS parameters were > 200. The neighbor-joining tree
based on SNVs was generated using the R phangorn library based on hamming
distances calculated using the R 1071 library. All other visualizations and
calculations were using R version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22).
