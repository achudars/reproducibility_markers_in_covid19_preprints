Abstract
In the absence of sufficient testing capacity for COVID-19, a substantial number of
infecteds are expected to remain undetected. Since the undetected cases are not quarantined,
they are expected to transmit the infection at a much higher rate than their quarantined
counterparts. That is, under the lack of extensive random testing, the actual prevalence and
incidence of the SARS-CoV-2 infection may be entirely different from that being reported.
Thus, it is imperative that the information on the percentage of undetected (or unreported)
cases be considered while estimating the parameters and forecasting the transmission
dynamics of the epidemic.
In this paper, we have developed a new version of the basic susceptible-infectedremoved (SIR) compartmental model, called the susceptible-infected (quarantined/ free) recovered- deceased [SI(Q/F)RD] model, to incorporate the impact of undetected cases on the
transmission dynamics of the epidemic. Further, we have presented a Dirichlet-Beta statespace formulation of the SI(Q/F)RD model for the estimation of its parameters using
posterior realizations from Gibbs sampling procedure. As a demonstration, the proposed
methodology is implemented to forecast the COVID-19 transmission in California and
Florida.

Introduction
As per the scientific brief of the World Health Organization (WHO) published on its

website on 9 July 2020, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs primarily between people
through direct, indirect, or close contact with infected people through infected secretions such
as saliva and respiratory secretions, or through their respiratory droplets, which are expelled
when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks or sings; refer [1]. That is, in order to break
the chains of transmissions of SARS-CoV-2, the objective of the preventive measures should
be to minimize the contact of susceptibles with infected people. The first step towards this
goal is to identify the infecteds so that they can be kept in quarantine till they are no longer
infectious. However, high variability in the level and the nature of symptoms in infecteds,
coupled with a significant length of incubation period, poses a difficult challenge to frame a
targeted testing strategy which can serve the purpose effectively. Although contract tracing
can help in identifying the chains of transmission associated with detected cases, presence of
a high proportion of asymptomatic cases, also capable of transmitting infection [2, 3], flags
concerns about the reliability of the strategy. Further, in the presence of high proportion of
asymptomatic cases, limiting testing to the symptomatic individuals will also fail to serve the
objective of detecting and quarantining all infecteds. So, apart from testing symptomatic
individuals (mild or severe), and identifying and testing high risk individuals having history
of contact with infected people, the situation demands aggressive random testing to isolate
even the asymptomatic cases from the population. In the absence of adequate amount of
random testing, a significant number of infecteds, especially asymptomatic individuals, may
remain undetected (i.e., number of cases will remain significantly underreported). Since the
undetected cases are not quarantined, they are expected to remain infectious in the population

for a relatively much longer as compared to those who are detected and quarantined. Lack of
any visible symptom in the undetected cases increases the likelihood of susceptibles spending
prolonged period in their proximity. Thus, the undetected cases can exhibit a strikingly higher
reproduction rate as compared to that of their quarantined counterparts. To be precise,
aggressive random testing is imperative towards fulfilling the objective of breaking the chains
of transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 using non-medical containment measures.
Despite repeated appeals and advisories to all countries from the WHO to employ
extensive random testing, only few countries have shown intentions to conduct adequate
number of COVID-19 tests [4]. Rate of positive tests at a place can give an indication about
the adequacy, or inadequacy, of the number of tests being carried out in the region. New
Zealand has set an extraordinary example in quickly containing the epidemic by efficiently
adhering to the strategy of aggressive testing and isolation of infecteds to break the chains of
infection. As on 25 August 2020, New Zealand has reported a total of 1690 confirmed cases
of which 1539 have recovered, 129 are active and 22 have died. These are very encouraging
figures, especially when compared with those of the countries like USA, Brazil, UK, India,
Russia, and many others. Till 19 August 2020, the overall percentage of positive tests in New
Zealand is reported to be 0.23% [5]. While in USA, the percentage of positive tests has
remained quite high since the beginning, with the overall positive percentage staring at 9%.
Also, there is a lot of variation between the percentages of positive tests reported by different
states in the United States, which varies between 0.53% (Vermont) to 100% (Washington) as
reported on 26 August 2020 by the Johns Hopkins University [6]. As per the recommendation
of the WHO, the rates of positivity in testing should remain at 5% or lower for at least 14
days at a stretch before governments decide about relaxing the containment/ lockdown
measures. This advisory from the WHO is based on the rationale that very high positive rates
may indicate that people with only severe symptoms are getting tested and all the

asymptomatic cases or cases with mild symptoms are being left out. That is, a high rate of
positivity may imply that the testing capacity of the state/ country is insufficient to gauge the
actual size of the outbreak, leading to a significant proportion of cases being unreported. As
of now, underreporting of cases in the USA has been confirmed and reported by few
published scientific studies. Wu et al. [7] have used a semi-Bayesian probabilistic bias
analysis to account for incomplete testing and imperfect diagnostic accuracy. As per their
estimate, there were 6,454,951 true cumulative infections compared to 721,245 confirmed
cases (reported) as of 18 April 2020 in the United States. For different states, the actual
number of infections was reported to be 3 to 20 times higher than the confirmed cases. Lau et
al. [8] used a simple intuitive method based on crude case fatality risk and adjusted case
fatality risk to evaluate extent of underreporting in various COVID-19 epicentres across the
world. Their study was based on early-stage data of COVID-19 and they reported severe
underreporting of cases in most of the countries worldwide. For USA, they found the estimate
of actual number of infections to be around 53.8 times the reported number of confirmed
cases. This extraordinarily high estimate of underreporting can be explained by the fact that
their study was based on the data reported till 17 March 2020. In general, underreporting is
expected to be high at the initial stage of any epidemic owing to the lack of proper system at
place, and lack of knowledge and awareness about the infection. Citing their findings, they
suggested that due to limited testing capacities, mortality numbers may serve as a better
indicator for COVID-19 case spread in many countries.
Although some studies have been done so far to estimate true burden of the disease,
the literature lacks any attempt at forecasting true trajectory of infection by dynamically
accounting for underreporting of cases. For example, the two papers cited above [7, 8] have
been able assess the extent of underreporting till a fixed past date, but they have not presented
any methodology to predict the true number of cases under the dynamically changing rates of

underreporting. In this paper, we have developed a comprehensive methodology to estimate
the true parameters of an epidemic and forecast its transmission dynamics under serious
underreporting of cases. To materialize this objective, we propose a new compartmentalised
epidemic model called the susceptible-infected (quarantined/ free) - recovered- deceased
[SI(Q/F)RD] model. To induce uncertainties in this mathematical model, we have developed
its Dirichlet-Beta state-space (Bayesian hierarchical) formulation. The Bayesian hierarchical
formulation is implemented in JAGS through the R package ‘R2Jags’ to obtain posterior
estimates of the unknown parameters. To demonstrate the implementation of the
methodology, we have considered the cases of two of the worst COVID-19 affected states of
USA, California, and Florida, which have very high percentages of positive tests. Since the
level of testing, and protocols/ procedure of reporting of number of deaths may vary between
different state jurisdictions, the level of underreporting of deaths and cases can also be
expected to vary between states. This is the reason that we have performed state-wise
analyses, rather than analysing the combined data of USA. It should be noted that, although
underreporting of cases can occur because of various other reasons, like poor communication
between state and hospitals, conscious data manipulation to conceal failures of
administration, anomalies in protocols used for declaring epidemic related deaths, lack of
proper digital infrastructure to keep reliable records, to name a few, we have assumed that
lack of sufficient testing is the sole (or at least major) reason for underreporting. This
assumption holds for a developed country like USA, where other reasons like lack of proper
communication or digital infrastructure can be conveniently crossed off.

Methodology
To realize the objective of our study, we propose the following sequence of steps,

which are then implemented on the COVID-19 time-series data of California and Florida.
2.1. Calibrating daily number of deaths using weekly excess deaths due to COVID-19

Underreporting of deaths has been estimated using the estimates of excess deaths.
Excess deaths due to an epidemic (COVID-19 in our case) can be estimated as the difference
between the total number of deaths reported in the period of epidemic (from all causes) and
the expected number of baseline deaths due to all other causes in the absence of COVID-19.
One popular method to calculate the expected number of baseline deaths in the absence of
COVID-19 is to fit a Poisson regression to the time-series (weekly) data of death counts, and
then projecting the baseline death counts till the required future point in time. An overdispersed Poisson generalized linear models with spline terms is used to model trends in
counts, accounting for seasonality; refer [9-11]. The model is also adjusted for year-to-year
baseline variation and any pre-existing epidemic, like influenza epidemic. In our study we
have used weekly estimates of excess deaths published by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) for the two states under consideration for the analyses [9]. The
estimated excess death counts in the presence of COVID-19 are taken as the estimates of
actual (or true) number of deaths due to the pandemic. The reported daily deaths due to
COVID-19 are summed over weeks to find weekly reported deaths. The difference between
the weekly excess deaths and weekly reported deaths give us the estimate of the unreported
deaths due to the pandemic. For further analysis, the weekly estimate of unreported deaths
due to COVID-19 is distributed among each day of the corresponding week as per the
proportion of the number of pandemic related deaths reported on a day out of the total
number of deaths due to the pandemic reported in that week. If all days of a week have zero
reported deaths, the total number of unreported deaths is equally distributed among all seven
days. Combining the additional death counts assigned to each day to the already reported
death counts for the day gives us the calibrated daily time-series data on actual number of
deaths due to COVID-19. The calibrated data is smoothed using the method of LOESS
regression before proceeding with further calculations.

2.2. Estimation of underreporting of number of infecteds
Actual daily number of infecteds can be estimated using a reliable estimate of case
fatality rate (CFR). As the reported data on number of cases is expected to suffer from
underreporting, CFR based on the population level data will be misleading. If we assume that
the level (or proportion) of underreporting of deaths and infecteds are same, the CFR
estimated from the reported data will be a reliable estimate of the true population CFR.
However, this is hardly the case, and the proportions of underreporting of deaths and
infecteds usually differ considerably. An estimate of CFR based on an individual patient level
(follow-up) data is deemed as most reliable [12]. So, a simple rule of thumb to know if the
levels of underreporting of deaths and infecteds can be assumed to be same is to compare the
delayed CFR obtained from reported data with the one obtained from the individual patient
level data. If they vary significantly, we should infer that the levels of underreporting are
different for number of deaths and number of infecteds. In such a situation, it is advisable to
use the CFR obtained from the individual patient level data as the best estimate for the true
CFR of the epidemic. Once a reliable estimate of the CFR is obtained, it can be used to
calibrate the data for the number of true infecteds on each day using the estimated counts of
true deaths and the average delay between infection and death. That is, if the average duration
between infection (or detection/ reporting of infection) and death associated with COVID-19
is known to be, say, h days, and suppose that Dt number of people have died of the infection
on a particular day t, then Int-h+1 = (Dt / CFR) number of new cases are expected to be
infected h days prior to the day of death.
If daily reported data on the number of recovered cases (Rt) is available, it can be
inflated according to the proportion of underreporting estimated in the number of infecteds as
follows.

where, 𝑝𝑡 is the estimated proportion of underreporting of infecteds at time t, 𝐼𝑡𝐶 is the
calibrated number of infecteds at time t, 𝐼𝑡 is the reported number of infecteds at time t, 𝑅𝑡𝐶 is
the calibrated number of recovered cases at time t, 𝑹𝒕 is the reported number of recovered
cases at time t and r is the average duration from infection to recovery of patients. If the daily
number of recovered cases is not reported, or if it is not reliable, a viable calibration can be
done using r and (1- CFR). Calculations will be like that used for the calibration of number of
infecteds. Further, sum of calibrated counts of total infecteds, total recovered and total deaths
till a day will give us the estimate of the cumulative number of confirmed cases till that day.
2.3. The proposed SI(Q/F)RD epidemic model
This variation of the popular Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) compartmental
model is designed to account for underreporting and its impact on the trajectory of the
epidemic. Underreporting is assumed to be the result of some infected cases not getting
detected because of the lack of adequate testing capacity. That is, a proportion of the
infecteds are detected (p) and quarantined (mostly symptomatic cases), while the rest of the
infecteds (mostly asymptomatic cases) are undetected and roam freely among the
susceptibles. This leads to the belief that the undetected cases are expected to infect the
susceptibles at a higher rate (β2), than that of their quarantined counterparts (β1). The
proportion of detected cases, p, can vary with time if testing capacity is increased or
decreased over the period of the epidemic, and can be taken as a function of time t, say, pt.
The overall structure of this model is presented in Figure 1. Since the quarantined infecteds
consist mostly of symptomatic cases, including critical cases, quarantined infecteds can be
expected to be at a higher risk of death on an average. Consequently, different death rates can

be assumed for quarantined and undetected cases. Different recovery rates can be assumed
for quarantined and undetected cases if any scientific evidence exists in its favour. Otherwise,
we can assume that both groups of infecteds have equal average recovery rate.

quarantined, 1-pt is the proportion of infecteds who are undetected and roaming freely
among the susceptibles, β1 is the transmission rate associated with quarantined infecteds
and β2 is the transmission rate associated with undetected infecteds, ϒ1 and d1 are rate
of recovery and rate of death for quarantined cases and ϒ2 and d2 are rate of recovery
and rate of death for undetected cases.
The set of differential equations quantifying the transitions defined in Figure 1 can be

respective compartments at time t. Also, let 𝜽𝑡 = (𝜃𝑡𝑆 , 𝜃𝑡𝐼 , 𝜃𝑡𝑅 , 𝜃𝑡𝐷 )𝑇 be the latent population
prevalence.
Solution of this set of differential equations can be obtained using Runge-Kutta
approximation. Let 𝑓(𝜽𝑡−1 , 𝜷, 𝜸, 𝒅) denotes the solution of the set of differential equations
for time t, where the function takes the values of the vectors 𝜽𝑡−1, 𝜷 = (𝛽1 , 𝛽2 )𝑇 , 𝒅 =
(𝑑1 , 𝑑2 )𝑇 and 𝜸 = (𝛾1 , 𝛾2 )𝑇 as the arguments. Then the fourth order Runge-Kutta
approximation for the solution of these differential equations can be expressed as follows.

2.4. Dirichlet-Beta state-space formulation of the SI(Q/F)RD model
To account for the uncertainties in the epidemiological parameters and the transmission
dynamics of the epidemic, we define a flexible state-space probabilistic model based on the
deterministic SI(Q/F)RD model. Osthus et al. [13] introduced a Dirichlet-Beta state-space
model based on the basic SIR model. We have extended the Dirichlet-Beta state-space model
in accordance with the SI(Q/F)RD structure to estimate the model parameters, and forecast
the transmission dynamics of the epidemic. Let 𝑌𝑡𝑆 , 𝑌𝑡𝐼 , 𝑌𝑡𝑅 and 𝑌𝑡𝐷 be the observed proportion
of susceptibles, infecteds, recovered and deceased respectively. Then the Bayesian
hierarchical state-space SI(Q/F)RD model can be defined as follows.

From equation (12) it is apparent that 𝜽𝒕 , 𝑡 = 1,2 … , 𝑇, is a first-order markov chain.
Also, the equations (9), (10) and (11) suggest that, for 𝑡 ≠ 𝑠, 𝑌𝑡𝐼 is independent of 𝑌𝑠𝐼 , 𝑌𝑡𝑅 is
independent of 𝑌𝑠𝑅 , and 𝑌𝑡𝐷 is independent of 𝑌𝑠𝐷 , given 𝜃𝑡𝐼 , 𝜃𝑡𝑅 and 𝜃𝑡𝐷 respectively.
Prior distributions of the model parameters can be defined as follows.

The hyperparameters of these Gamma prior distributions can be assumed according to

be the variance of the respective Beta and Dirichlet distributions. If limited prior information
is available regarding these parameters, a relatively flat Gamma prior distribution with a high

hyperparameters a’s and b’s. Hyperparameters of the prior distribution of pt are obtained

underreporting. Hyperparameters of the lognormal distributions defined in the expressions
(14) and (15) can be either based on historical knowledge on a similar epidemic, or can be
estimated based on the observed data. In our study, we have used a time-series SIR (TSIR)

for the hyper parameters 𝜸 and 𝒅 are calculated using required information from published
literature on COVID-19. 𝛾1 = 𝛾2 = 𝛾 (𝑠𝑎𝑦) is taken as the inverse of the average recovery
period. We have assumed equal recovery rates for both groups, quarantined and undetected.
The components of 𝒅, viz., d1 and d2 are estimated as, 𝑑1 =

, where h is the

average number of days from infection till death and IFR is the infection fatality rate. CFR is
the ratio of the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases of disease. While,
IFR is the ratio of deaths divided by the number of actual infections with SARS-CoV-2 and is
generally expected to be lower than CFR.
2.5. Estimation of the hyperparameter 𝜷 using TSIR model
The two components of the vector 𝜷 = (𝛽1 , 𝛽2 )𝑇 must be estimated separately, such
that they conform to their definitions. To do so, we have made some assumptions about the
reported data, based on certain practical considerations. If it is known that the government of
the country or the state under consideration did not take any significant action to quarantine
infecteds or to promote physical distancing during the initial period of the epidemic, the
transmission rate observed during that period can be safely considered as an initial estimate
of 𝛽2 (the transmission rate due to infecteds who are not quarantined). Once the containment
measures are imposed, the transmission rate based on the reported data is expected to change
(reduce) and average transmission rate observed over the entire period of reporting can be
considered as a safe initial estimate (hyperparameter estimate) for 𝛽 (the overall average

transmission rate as a result of both quarantined and undetected infecteds). This logic can be
implemented using the TSIR model to estimate the hyperparameters as follows.
In TSIR model, the response, being a count variable, is assumed to follow certain
discrete count process distribution like Poisson distribution or Negative Binomial
distribution. The basic structure of TSIR model can be defined as follows; refer [15-17].
𝑆𝑡+1 = 𝑆𝑡 − 𝐼𝑡
𝜆𝑡+1 = 𝛽0

where, St and It are the number of susceptibles and infecteds (or infectives) at time t, N is the
population size, β0 is the transmission rate and 𝜆𝑡+1 is the expected number of new infecteds
at time t+1. New number of infecteds is assumed to follow Negative Binomial (or Poisson)
distribution and a generalized Negative Binomial (or Poisson) linear model with log link is
𝑆

fitted with 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝐼𝑡 as a covariate and 𝑙𝑜𝑔 ( 𝑁𝑡 ) as an offset variable. The exponent α is expected
to be just under 1 (i.e., close to 1) and is meant to account for discretizing the underlying
continuous process. However, we use an alternative interpretation of α based on the basic SIR
model defined in equation (21). This method is drawn from our prior work where we have
proposed a new method for obtaining time-varying estimates of transmission rate using TSIR
model [14]. It is to be noted that the transmission rate is assumed to be time-varying, and
hence, denoted as 𝛽𝑡 .

Using (21), the expression for expected number of new infecteds at time t+1 (taking α = 1)
with a time-varying transmission rate can be written as follows.

Comparing equations (19) and (22), we can see that if α = 1 (or close to 1), βt = β0
(constant over time). However, if the value of α deviates considerably from 1, it has impact
on the effective value of transmission rate, thus making the effective rate of transmission
time-dependent. That is, in such cases α assimilates the empirical changes in transmission
rate over time. Further, using equations (19) and (22), we can write,
𝛽̂𝑡 = 𝛽0 𝐼𝑡𝛼−1

(23)

Now, suppose T1 represents the initial period of the epidemic, when proper quarantine
protocols were not in place, and T represents the entire period for which the reported data on
the epidemic is available. The estimates of α and β0 obtained from the fitting of the TSIR
model shall be used in equation (23) to find estimates of transmission rate at each time t, 𝛽̂𝑡 , t
= 1,2,3…,T. Average of these estimates over a time period will give us the estimate of
average transmission rate for that period. That is, the estimates of the transmission rates will
1
1
be taken as, 𝛽̂ = 𝑇 ∑𝑡𝜖𝑇 𝛽̂𝑡 and 𝛽̂2 = 𝑇 ∑𝑡𝜖𝑇1 𝛽̂𝑡 . Then a reliable estimate of 𝛽1, the

transmission rate due to the infecteds who are quarantined, can be obtained using the relation,
1
𝛽̂ = 𝛽̂1 𝑝̅ + 𝛽̂2 (1 − 𝑝̅ ); 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑝̅ = 𝑇 ∑𝑇1 𝑝𝑡 . As a simpler, but logical, alternative to this step

for finding 𝛽̂1, we can make use of the fact that the infecteds who are quarantined are
expected to spread infection for, approximately, only one-third of the duration as compared to
those who are not quarantined. This is because quarantined patients spread infections mostly
in the incubation period of around 4-5 days, prior to getting quarantined, while infecteds who
are not quarantined are expected to spread infection for the entire average infectious period of
̂

𝛽
14 days. So, after estimating 𝛽̂2using the method described above, we can take 𝛽̂1 = 32 , as

the initial estimate.

2.6. Estimating parameters of the state-space SI(Q/F)RD model and forecasting
Posterior realizations on the parameters of the state-space model are generated using
Gibbs sampling MCMC approach. The model is adopted in JAGS format and implemented in
R using the package R2jags. Mean of posterior realizations of a parameter is taken as its
posterior estimate. Further, 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles of the posterior realizations are taken as
the limits of 95% credible intervals (CI) of the posterior estimates. Let t0 be the time till
which the observations are available, and suppose that we wish to forecast the values of
observed process (𝑌𝑡𝑆 , 𝑌𝑡𝐼 , 𝑌𝑡𝑅 , 𝑌𝑡𝐷 ) from t0+1 till the time T. We follow the following iterative
steps to achieve our goal.
a.

We generate L posterior realizations on the latent prevalence process 𝜽𝑡 (𝑙) , 𝑙 =

1,2 … , 𝐿 using Gibbs sampling approach, at each time point t = t0 +1,2…..,T. Here L is
a sufficiently large number, say 1000 or more.

obtained using the 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles of the L values.

Implementation and Results

3.1. Data
Daily time-series data on total confirmed cases and total deaths for the states California
and Florida are obtained from the github repository of the Centre for Systems Science and
Engineering (CSSE), Johns Hopkins University, Maryland, USA (https://github.com/
CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). Daily time-series data till 11 July 2020 was available at the
time of procurement of data, and the same has been used for the entire analyses. Data on
weekly state-wise estimates of excess deaths associated with COVID-19 till 11 July 2020,
calculated as a difference between expected and reported number of deaths from all causes, is
obtained

from

the

website

of

CDC

(https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/

excess_deaths.html). Data on rates of positivity of COVID-19 testing for the two states,
California and Florida, are obtained from the official website of Johns Hopkins University on
29 July 2020 (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/ testing/testing-positivity).
3.2. CFR and data calibration to account for underreporting
To avoid the initial period of uncertain reporting due to the absence of sufficient
government measures and proper reporting system at place, we have used the data from 02
March 2020 onwards for all analyses. The weekly excess death estimates are used to
reconstruct the daily time-series data of deaths using the procedure discussed in section 2.1.
According to the results reported by Verity et al. [18] based on patient level data from
mainland China, the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death is 17.8 days (95%
credible interval 16.9–19.2). They reported the best estimate of case fatality ratio in China as
1.38% (1.23- 1.53), with substantially higher CFR in older age groups (0.32% [0.27–0.38] in
those aged <60 years vs 6.4% [5.7–7.2] in those aged ≥60 years), up to 13.4% (11.2–15.9) in
those aged 80 years or older). Their estimate for overall IFR in China is 0.66% [0.39-1.33],

with an increasing profile with age. Yang et al. [19] reported that the median time from
symptom onset to radiological confirmation of pneumonia is 5 days (interquartile range
[IQR] 3–7 days); from symptom onset to intensive care unit (ICU) admission is 11 days (IQR
7–14 days); and from ICU admission to death is 7 days (IQR 3–11 days). That is, the estimate
of median time from onset of symptoms to death can be taken as 11 + 7 = 18 days. This
estimate of time-to-event of death is consistent with the results of Verity et al. [18]. So
according to these results, the estimate of average duration from onset of infection to death
should be around 17.8 + 5 ≈ 23 days, where 5 days is the average incubation period.
However, for estimating delayed CFR based on the reported data and for estimating actual
number of infecteds from the calibrated data on number of deaths, we have taken average
duration from infected/ reported to death as 18 days. This is because infecteds are generally
tested on the onset of symptoms, i.e., after the incubation period.
The delayed CFR values calculated based on reported data came out to be quite high in
both states. For California, the delayed CFR was 3.36%, while for Florida it came out to be
3.17% (Table 1). Both estimates are quite higher than 1.38%, the estimate based on
individual patient data as reported by Verity et al. [18]. In fact, some other reports have
suggested even lower actual CFR of COVID-19. The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine
(CEBM) at the University of Oxford currently estimates the CFR globally at 0.51%, with all
the caveats pertaining thereto; refer (https://www.virology.ws/2020/04/05/infection-fatalityrate-a-critical-missing-piece-for-managing-covid-19/). Since the estimate of CFR based on
follow up data of individual patients is deemed as most reliable, especially during initial
stages of the epidemic, as a conservative estimate, we have taken 1.38% as the standard CFR
due to COVID-19. Thus, the results of CFR based on the reported data point at
underreporting of number of infecteds in both states. Also, significantly high rates of
positivity of COVID-19 testing in the two states- 7.47% in California and 18.96% in Florida-

amount of random testing. That is, it corroborates our assumption that the current testing
strategy employed by the two states largely aim at targeted testing.

Table 1: Delayed CFR estimates for the two states based on the reported data.

Using a delay of 18 days (between detection of infection and death), and a CFR of
1.38%, we employ the method discussed in section 2.2 to estimate the actual number of daily
infected cases (new cases). It should be noted that due to the lag of 18 days in the formula,
number of daily infected cases could be calculated till 24 June 2020 only (18 days prior to 11
July 2020). Data on number of recovered people is not reported by the two states. So, we
have calibrated the data for number of recovered cases using the logic that if 1.38% is the
average CFR, 98.62% will be the average case recovery rate. Following formula is used to
estimate the daily count of recoveries.

(24)

Here, 𝐼𝑡𝑛 represents new number of infecteds at time t. The recovery rate, 𝜌, is randomly
generated between 0.975 and 0.99 to introduce some amount of uncertainty into the
calibrated data. The average duration of recovery, r, is taken as 14 days based on a WHO
report [20]. However, at this juncture we should also note that some other studies have
reported higher average duration of recovery from COVID-19. Verity et al. [18] have
estimated mean duration from onset of symptoms to hospital discharge to be 24.7 days [95%
CI: 22.9–28.1]. Recovery time also varies according to the severity of symptoms. Since small
recovery time implies faster recovery rate, our choice of 14-day average recovery period

(from the onset of symptoms) can be called as a conservative estimate, and the forecasts of
transmission dynamics based on it can also be expected to be slightly on the conservative
side. Since the formula given in equation (24) cannot give us the estimates of the first 13
days, we have constructed the daily recovery data for these initial days using daily recovery
rate taken as the inverse of the average duration of recovery. Again, to induce some
uncertainty in the data, we have randomly generated recovery rate, 𝜑𝑡 , between 0.042 (1/24)
and 0.071 (1/14), for each day. Following formula has been applied to implement the idea.
𝑹𝒕 = 𝐼𝑡 . 𝜑𝑡 , where, 𝜑𝑡 ~𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚(0.042,0.071), 𝑡 < 14

(25)

It is the number of (active) infecteds at time t. For t < 14, the already calculated values of
recovered cases at time t + 13 using equation (24), Rt+13, is adjusted by subtracting Rt from it.
For further analyses, the reconstructed/ calibrated data on number of cases in each
compartment is treated as the true data. The ratio of reported number of infecteds and true
number of infecteds gives us the estimates of daily proportion of reporting pt ( Qt = pt. It ).
The calibrated data is provided in Appendix-B. Graphs of LOESS smoothed calibrated data
on total number of deaths due to COVID-19 for the two states are presented in Figure 2.
Summary statistics of pt are provided in Table 2.

3.3. Evaluating parameters and hyperparameters of the state-space SI(Q/F)RD model
In California, the first official lockdown measure was implemented on 19 March 2020,
while in Florida it was implemented from 01 April 2020. So, the period till 18 March 2020 is
considered as initial period of transmission for California, while the period till 31 March
2020 is taken as the initial period of transmission in Florida, for finding initial estimate of the
transmission rate in the absence of proper quarantine measures for infecteds (𝛽̂2 ). TSIR
model described in section 2.5 is fitted assuming both Poisson and Negative Binomial
distributions for the count process. Because of lower model deviance, model with Negative
Binomial distribution is chosen over the Poisson model. These models are fitted in IBMSPSS version 24. The estimated coefficients of the Negative Binomial TSIR models [model
defined in equation (20)], for both states, are provided in Table 3. Using these coefficient
estimates in equation (23) and taking average over respective initial periods of the COVID-19
epidemic, 02 March 2020- 18 March 2020 for California and 02 March 2020- 31 March 2020
for Florida, we have obtained the estimates of 𝛽2 for the two states. Initial estimate of 𝛽1 is
calculated as one-third of the estimate of 𝛽2. These estimates are also provided in Table 3.

Using the estimates of CFR and IFR, and the average duration from onset of symptom

Also, the estimate of recovery rate is

𝛾̂1 = 𝛾̂2 = 𝛾̂(𝑠𝑎𝑦) = 14 = 0.071. These

estimates remain same for both states. So, the initial estimates of average reproduction
numbers, R1 and R2, will be given as,

These estimates of 𝛾, R1 and R2 are used to obtain informed hyperparameters of their
prior distributions defined in equations (14) and (15). To decide on the hyperparameters of
the Beta prior distribution of the time-varying proportion of quarantined infecteds, pt, we use
the descriptive statistics of its estimates over the observed period. Till the observed time
period, the Beta prior distribution of pt is assumed to have mean equal to 𝑝̂𝑡 , the estimate of pt
based on the calibrated data, and variance equal to the overall variance of the estimates. It is
observed that after initial period of around one month, the values of 𝑝̂ 𝑡 tend to first increase
and then settle around some central value. So, for forecasting beyond the observed time
period, sample mean and sample variance of the estimates corresponding to the last ten days

The Dirichlet-Beta state-space SI(Q/F)RD model defined in section 2.4 is fitted on the
calibrated data, using the parameters and hyperparameters obtained in section 3.3. The model
is implemented in JAGS platform using R2jags package. Three parallel markov chains were
run, each with 20,000 iterations of which first 10,000 were discarded. After thinning at an

Discussion

Some key insights from the results of the SI(Q/F)RD model
Estimates of the proportion of reported cases, pt, based on the calibrated data give us a
good idea about the seriousness of the problem of underreporting. As can be seen from the
summary provided in Table 2, the first 30 days of the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic
have experienced extremely high level of underreporting (i.e., for the month of March as per
the timeline of this study), with the average percentages of underreporting rate for the two
states being 96.6% (California) and 93.9% (Florida). Similar results have been reported by
Lau et al. [8]. Based on the reported data till 17 March 2020, they estimated the true number

of infecteds to be 53.8 times higher than the reported number of cases in the United States,
i.e., overall, 98.1% unreported cases. Similar trend was also reported by Wu et al. [7] and as
per their findings the ratios of estimated cases to confirmed infections in California and
Florida were around 17.5 (94.3% underreported cases) and 10 (90% unreported cases),
respectively, till 18 April 2020. This can be attributed to the lack of appropriate testing
facilities, including resources like testing kits, and absence of proper response from the
government (or lack of seriousness and foresightedness on the part of the policy makers)
during the initial stage of the pandemic. With time, the proportion of reported cases has
increased steadily, and after a couple of months, it tends to fluctuate around the average
values of 57% for California and 39% for Florida. These average values of pt, calculated at
the later stage of the pandemic, are representative of the nature and capacity of testing policy
of the states. For the same reason, the hyperparameters of the prior distributions of pt for the
purpose of forecasting are based on these later-stage averages. That is, due to the lack of
extensive random testing in these states, around 43% infected cases in California and 61%
infected cases in Florida, on an average, are expected to go unreported. These percentages of
infecteds are undetected and are not quarantined, and they remain infectious for a much
longer period than their quarantined counterparts, moving freely among the susceptibles. The
SI(Q/F)RD epidemic model proposed by us is based on this hypothesis and the hypothesis is
strongly supported by the posterior estimates of the transmission parameters obtained from
the Dirichlet-Beta state-space SI(Q/F)RD model. Posterior estimates of average reproduction
numbers associated with quarantined infecteds are 0.497 (sd: 0.262) and 0.359 (sd: 0.224),
and for the undetected infecteds are 1.464 (sd: 0.155) and 1.612 (sd: 0.097) for California and
Florida respectively. This clearly indicates that if almost all infecteds were quarantined; the
number of active cases would have declined sharply, and the total size of the epidemic would
have reduced drastically in both states. However, quarantining almost all infecteds, in the

presence of a large proportion of asymptomatic cases, requires extensive amount of daily
testing. This is clearly missing in both states under consideration, as indicated by very high
rates of positivity of tests and high CFR values based on reported data for the two states.
Comparing forecasted deaths with post-study published estimate of excess deaths
Since the true number of infecteds, detected plus undetected, remain latent in the
population, it is not possible to compare forecasted values with the true values. However,
comparing cumulative number of deaths forecasted by the state-space SI(Q/F)RD model with
the estimated values of excess deaths can serve as a potent alternative to assess predictive
efficiency of the model. Estimates of epidemiological parameters and predictions obtained
from the state-space SI(Q/F)RD model in section 3 are based on the daily time-series data on
number of cases reported till 11 July 2020 and the weekly estimates of excess deaths
available till the same date. Predictive accuracy of the model will be determined by its ability
to forecast true values beyond the training period of the model. From this perspective, we
have plotted the forecasted time-series of cumulative number of deaths obtained from the
fitted SI(Q/F)RD model along with the weekly estimated excess deaths due to COVID-19 till
14 November 2020. The estimates of excess deaths due to COVID-19 have been retrieved
from the website of CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/ excess_deaths.html)
on 4 December 2020. Striking difference in the estimated values of average reproduction
numbers associated with detected (quarantined) cases and undetected cases suggest that the
assumption regarding future values of proportion of detected cases plays a crucial role in
ascertaining high predictive accuracy of the model. In other words, accuracy of the
predictions from the proposed SI(Q/F)RD model relies greatly on the validity of the
assumption regarding future testing policy in the region- i.e., on whether the testing capacity
relative to the number of true cases is expected to increase, remain unchanged or decrease
over time. To stress upon this argument, observed time-series of rates of positivity of

COVID-19 tests are also plotted alongside the comparative plots of the forecasted number of
deaths. Figure 5 and Figure 6 present these plots for California and Florida, respectively. In
both figures, the left panel shows the comparative trends of cumulative number of deaths
(predicted and excess) and the right panel presents the rate of positive tests over time. The
trend line in blue in the right panel shows the average percentage of tests that were positive
over the last seven days, i.e., a seven-day moving average of percentage of positive tests.

In the case of California, there is a considerable difference between the predicted
number of deaths and estimated excess deaths due to COVID-19. However, the difference is
majorly in the scale of the values, and the two trend lines look similar in shape over time.
Possible reason for the difference in the scale can be explained by analysing the trend line of
rate of positive tests. The percentage of positive tests in California was extremely high during
March-April, but although it started dropping exceptionally towards the end of April, it
remained around 10% till July. However, September onwards the rate of positivity came
down below 5%, the WHO recommended threshold. The steep rise in total number of tests
performed daily, as shown by the pink towers in the graph, clearly explains this change. That
is, California experienced a drastic change in testing capacity in the period of forecasting.
Since, the hyperparameters of the model corresponding to the proportion of detected cases
were defined based on the status of rate of positivity till July, the model tends to give
overestimated forecasts of total number of deaths. Increasing the proportion of detected cases
in the model as per the increase in testing capacity of the region would result in decrease in
the total number of deaths. This is because the estimated rate of transmission for detected
(quarantined) cases is relatively much lower than that of the undetected cases.

The scenario of rate of positive tests over time looks entirely different for Florida.
Percentage of positive tests dipped below 5% for only two brief periods and it remained high
for most of the time. That is, except for few short periods, the testing capacity has remained
below par. Insufficient testing is also indicated by the fact that the trend line of the rate of
positive tests is mostly parallel to the changes in the peaks of the total number of tests
conducted per day. That is, it suggests that increase in the number of tests was not sufficient
to reduce the rate of positive tests. Ideally, in the presence of sufficient amount of random
testing, rate of positive tests should decrease with increase in the number of tests- as can be
seen in the case of California. In other words, no significant change in the testing policy of
Florida is observed in the forecasting period. This further implies that the hyperparameters
defined for the proportion of detected cases in the state-space SI(Q/F)RD model remained
valid for most of the forecasting period. Consequently, the forecasted values of cumulative
number of deaths are much closer to the estimates of excess deaths in the case of Florida as
compared to that of California. These results reaffirm the inevitable impact of testing capacity
on the transmission dynamics of the pandemic, which forms the conceptual backbone of the
proposed state-space SI(Q/F)RD model.

predicted by the SI(Q/F)RD model with the estimates excess deaths due to COVID-19.

Conclusion
We have provided a comprehensive framework of data calibration and flexible

epidemic modelling for forecasting the transmission dynamics of epidemics in the presence
of serious underreporting of cases. The structure of the proposed SI(Q/F)RD model allows for
adjusting the trajectory of the epidemic in terms of time-varying levels of underreporting. The
Dirichlet-Beta state-space formulation of the SI(Q/F)RD model provides a dynamic approach
to the estimation and prediction of both time-invariant and time-varying transmission
parameters of the epidemic. Further, the proposed method, based on TSIR, for estimating
hyperparameters of prior distributions of transmission rates (or reproduction rates) improves
the posterior estimates by enriching the state-space model with strong prior information.
Posterior estimates of the transmission parameters of the COVID-19 pandemic obtained for
California and Florida emphasise on the need to incorporate different transmission rates for
detected (quarantined) and undetected (not quarantined) cases in epidemic models. The
findings also highlight the importance of extensive testing in the fight against pandemics like
COVID-19. The proposed methodology will play an essential role in assessing and
forecasting the true burden of any epidemic, irrespective of the level of underreporting of

cases, even at a very early stage. Such reliable information is indispensable for policy makers
for successful planning and implementation of containment measures.
Limitations and further scope of research
We have taken the rate of death as a fixed (known) parameter in the state-space
SI(Q/F)RD model. Finding its posterior estimates may improve the overall predictions from
the model. Further, time varying transmission rates can be introduced in the model using the
modifier functions to make the model more dynamic. The TSIR based method proposed for
the construction of modifier functions by Deo et al. [14] can play an important role in
implementing the SI(Q/F)RD state-space model with time-varying transmission rates.
