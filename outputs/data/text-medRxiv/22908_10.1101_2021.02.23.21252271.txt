Objective
Acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine will impart a pivotal role in eradicating the virus. In
Pakistan, health care workers (HCWs) are the first group to receive vaccination. This survey
aimed at the level of acceptance to the COVID-19 vaccine and predictors of non-acceptance in
HCWs.
Method
This was a cross-sectional study design and data were collected through 3rd December 2020 and
February 14th, 2021. An English questionnaire was distributed through social media platforms
and administration of affiliate hospitals along with snowball sampling for private hospitals.
Results
Out of 5,237 responses, 3,679 (70.25%) accepted COVID-19 vaccination and 1,284 (24.51%)
wanted to delay until more data was available. Only 0.05% of HCWs rejected being vaccinated.
Vaccine acceptance was more in young (76%) and female gender (63.3%) who worked in a
tertiary care hospital (51.2%) and were direct patient care providers (61.3%). The reason for
rejection in females was doubtful vaccine effectiveness (31.48%) while males rejected due to
prior COVID-19 exposure (42.19%) and side effect profile of the vaccine (33.17%). Logistic
regression analysis demonstrated age between 51-60 years, female gender, Pashtuns, those
working in the specialty of medicine and allied, taking direct care of COVID-19 patients, higher
education, and prior OCVID-19 infection as the predictors for acceptance or rejection of
COVID-19 vaccine.

A high overall acceptance rate was observed among HCWs, favoring a successful nationwide
vaccination program in Pakistan.
Keywords: COVID-19, vaccine acceptance, health care workers

Introduction
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared as a global pandemic and an
emergency was initiated by World Health Organization (WHO) on 30th January 2020[1]. The
outbreak revealed itself as clusters of pneumonia of unknown etiology in China[2]. A systematic
review has outlined a severe form of the disease in 20% of the affected individuals with a
mortality rate of 3%[3]. As of February 2021, COVID-19 has affected 108 million people
worldwide, leading to 2.38 million deaths[4] while Pakistan reported 560,000 cases and 12,218
deaths[5]. Hence, in addition to social distancing measures and personal protective equipment[6],
there is a vital need to be vaccinated for COVID-19 to curb community transmission of COVID19 in Pakistan.
Health care workers (HCWs) have an important part in educating the general public about the
source of the vaccine and its implications in the coming years[7]. In Pakistan, HCWs are being
prioritized for an early Chinese-based COVID-19 vaccination program[8]. This is being mandated
throughout the West, prioritizing high-risk groups, and HCWs being recognized as such.
Therefore, it is vital to consider HCW attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine as it will lead to
a better dissemination of knowledge among the general public.

Methods
Study Design and Sampling
This study was a cross-sectional design to assess the acceptability of HCWs towards the COVID19 vaccination program in Pakistan. An English questionnaire was designed on Google Forms
from a previous study and modified for HCWs. No identifying information was collected in the
survey. The Foundation University Ethical Review Committee approved the study design
(Number: FFH/51/DCA/2020).
The questionnaire was distributed on social media platforms and a large coverage was made
available by our affiliate institutes in major cities of Pakistan. Snowball sampling was also
encouraged for dissemination of the survey questionnaire in primary care and private hospitals.
Data were collected through 3rd December 2020 and February 14th, 2021. Informed consent was
taken before final form submission and all adults (age ≥ 18 years) working as HCW were
considered eligible to participate in the survey. Incomplete questionnaires were excluded from
the final analysis.
Study Variables and Measures
Demographic data was presented on the first page of the survey questionnaire. It included age,
gender, ethnicity, marital status, type of designated work, education, type of medical facility,
chronic medical conditions, and prior COVID-19 infection. To assess the acceptance of the
COVID-19 vaccine, the respondents were provided the brand name and effectiveness of the
vaccine (CanSino Biologics, Tianjin, China; 65.7% effective in preventing symptomatic cases).
Respondents were given a question of whether they would accept the above-labeled vaccine as
yes or no. As for demographic variables, age was grouped into five categories (18-30, 31 – 40,
41 – 50, 51 – 60, >61 years old); ethnicity was grouped as Punjabi, Sindhi, Balochi, Pashtun, or

other; and designation of work was divided into direct patient care providers (Specialists, general
practitioners, medical students, and nursing staff) and non-patient care providers (hospital
supporting staff, administration, and pharmacists). Type of education and specialty were broken
down into medicine/allied, surgery/allied, diagnostics, or other. Place of work was designated as
either a tertiary care hospital, primary care center, or a private clinic.
Statistical analysis
For analysis of the data, Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26 (IBM,
Armonk, NY, USA.) was used and logistic regression was employed to determine the predictors
of HCWs acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine. Univariate analysis was done for unadjusted
estimate of odds ratio (OR) and multivariate analysis for adjusted OR. A p-value of less than
0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Respondent Demographics
We received 5,381 responses. One-hundred and forty-four were excluded because of the
incomplete survey questionnaire. A total of 5,237 responses were included in this study. More
than two-thirds of the respondents were younger than 50 years (76%) and 63.3% were females
who had either a bachelor’s (28.2%) or a master’s degree (11.6%). Overall, 51.2% of
respondents worked in tertiary care hospitals and 61.3% were direct patient care providers. The
majority of the responses were received from Punjab (43.1%) in the specialty of medicine and
allied (37.9%). Sixty-three percent had a history of COVID-19 disease before this survey.
Vaccine Acceptance and Predictors
Out of 5,237 respondents, 3,679 (70.2%) accepted the vaccination process while only 274
(0.05%) rejected it. One-fourth of the HCW’s would review data on COVID-19 vaccine before
moving further with the vaccine (24.5%). This is expressed in Figure 1. There was a significant
association between vaccine acceptance and respondent demographics. Respondent demographic
details, chronic medical conditions, and percent acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine are presented
in Table 1 along with adjusted and unadjusted response variables.
Acceptance rates of COVID-19 vaccination increased with increasing age. In the 18-30 age
group, 64.6% of the respondents accepted the COVID-19 vaccine which increased to 71.2% in
31-40 years and 91.2% in 51-60 years. Other factors predictive of vaccine acceptance were
female gender and single relationship status. The female gender had a higher vaccine acceptance
(80.7%) as well as those with a single relationship status (71.9%). A marked difference was seen
in the vaccine acceptance among different ethnic groups. Pashtuns (85.2%) had the highest
COVID-19 vaccine acceptance while Balochi’s had the lowest acceptance rate (36.1%). Vaccine

acceptance varied among various specialties in healthcare. Those working in the specialty of
medicine and allied (91.9%), in primary and tertiary healthcare settings (75% and 74.7%) had the
highest vaccine acceptance and HCW’s with no direct patient contact had a high refusal rate
(55.8%).
Among the two genders, there were different reasons for rejection of the COVID-19 vaccine
(Figure 2). Females had religious concerns (2.3%) as compared to males (1%) and they were not
convinced about the effectiveness of the vaccine (31.48%). The males not willing for the
COVID-19 vaccine had prior COVID-19 infection (42.1%) and they were not sure about the side
effects of the vaccine (33.1%). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated age between 51-60
years, female gender, Pashtuns, those working in the specialty of medicine and allied, taking
direct care of COVID-19 patients, higher education, and prior OCVID-19 infection as the
predictors for acceptance or rejection of COVID-19 vaccine (Figure 3).

Discussion
As the COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed health systems around the world, Pakistan has
been spared the worst of this disease’s high mortality. With its younger population and early
adherence with mask and social distancing mandates, Pakistan’s cases have been lower than the
developed countries. Other South Asian countries, having similar socioeconomic and
demographic characteristics to Pakistan have fared worse in terms of COVID-19-associated
morbidity and mortality. [9–11] In contrast to Pakistan’s difficult history in controlling Polio, due
to vaccine reluctance in many of its endemic regions [12–14], our study results seem to indicate
that COVID-19 vaccination did not elicit such hesitancy prior to mass vaccination efforts by the
government.[15]
The importance of healthcare workers in being strong advocates for eliminating vaccine
hesitancy among vulnerable populations has previously been recognized by the WHO. [16] Recent
evidence from research into this population subgroup shows that vaccine hesitancy in healthcare
workers is often the result of lack of information regarding the vaccines, lack of confidence in
communicating information about vaccines to parents and concerned family members, lack of
trust in government authorities providing the vaccine and influence of social media posts on their
decision making process. [7,17–19]
The incidence of COVID-19 in Pakistani HCWs, particularly in the population subset of our
study, was consistent with other countries. This may indicate the need for more robust infection
control practices in healthcare facilities on a global scale.[10,20] It also reflected a reduced lack of
risk perception, especially by male HCWs, who felt decreased need for COVID-19 vaccination
in light of a previous infection. This is consistent among HCWs worldwide due to the limited

data available about the severity of COVID-19 re-infection[21] and long-term health impairment
even after recovery from COVID-19. [22]
In contrast to a study of US healthcare workers [23], where HCW identifying as female were less
likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccine as compared to male HCWs, our study found female
HCWs to be more accepting of vaccination. Furthermore, similar to the findings of their study,
we found HCWs in direct patient care to be more accepting of vaccination against COVID-19
compared to those HCWs who were involved in indirect patient care. Acceptability by age in our
study was higher among the 51-60 years’ group, which is similar to other studies where
increasing age and education are both positive factors in vaccine acceptance.[17,24,25]
The variation in hesitancy by ethnicity showed a marked difference from previously performed
studies in Pakistan, where Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has often been singled as being more vaccine
resistant than the rest of the country.[13] However, our study showed that HCWs of Pashtun
ethnicity were more likely to get vaccinated compared to their counterparts from other provinces
of Pakistan.
Being a predominantly Muslim country, religion has often been a strong factor in rejecting
vaccination for various vaccine preventable diseases in Pakistan, with many citing the contents
of the vaccines to be non-compliant to Sharia law and therefore religiously unacceptable to them.
[12,13,26,27]

These findings were also reflected in our study, even among highly educated HCWs,

particularly those who were female. However, recent public statements by major Islamic
organizations have outlined that no such incompatibility exits [14].
Although, not directly addressed in our study, one important aspect of COVID-19 vaccine
hesitancy in Pakistan, was the impact of social media as a source of information for HCWs
during this pandemic. Social media posts have been implicated in similar studies carried out in

Muslim majority Middle Eastern countries.[17,28] Combatting this ‘infodemic’ with timely,
evidence based communication is necessary to ensure that misinformation does not hamper
national vaccination efforts[29].
A major strength of our study was the robust sample size of HCWs who responded to the
questionnaire and this survey represents a diverse group of individuals working as health care
providers. However, there were some limitations to this study. A snowball sampling method
could have created a selection and social desirability bias among HCWs. Furthermore, English
questionnaire can produce a selection bias towards English-literate HCWs, particularly those
active on social media. Despite these limitations, an overall positive response to vaccine
acceptability is a positive sign towards attaining herd immunity worldwide, and increasing
information and health communication from healthcare workers to the general population will
decrease hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccines.
Conclusion
Acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine in Pakistan is influenced by the evidence of vaccine
effectiveness and while the acceptability among HCWs in Pakistan is higher than other surveys,
a clear communication by the government, using the experience of HCWs as trusted sources of
medical information, is needed to ensure the success of a national vaccination strategy.
