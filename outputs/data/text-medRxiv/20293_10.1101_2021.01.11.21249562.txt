Abstract

20

Increasing number in global COVID-19 cases demands for mathematical model to

21

analyze the interaction between the virus dynamics and the response of innate and

22

adaptive immunity. Here, based on the assumption of a weak and delayed response of

23

the innate and adaptive immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection, we constructed a

24

mathematical model to describe the dynamic processes of immune system. Integrating

25

theoretical results with clinical COVID-19 patients’ data, we classified the COVID-19

26

development processes into three typical modes of immune responses, correlated with

27

the clinical classification of mild & moderate, severe and critical patients. We found that

28

the immune efficacy (the ability of host to clear virus and kill infected cells) and the

29

lymphocyte supply (the abundance and pool of naïve T and B cell) play important roles

30

in the dynamic process and determine the clinical outcome, especially for the severe and

31

critical patients. Furthermore, we put forward possible treatment strategies for the three

dynamical mechanism of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to

be useful for the treatment strategies and vaccine design.

Introduction

36

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has

37

spread globally, having a huge impact on global politics, economy and society.

38

Compared to other viral infectious diseases, such as influenza, severe acute respiratory

39

syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and acquired immune

40

deficiency syndrome (AIDS), COVID-19 exhibits multiscale different characteristics.

41

Epidemiologically, COVID-19 has a relatively longer incubation period (~5.8 days) with

42

a number of asymptomatic patients, which intensifies the difficulty of management and

43

prevention (1). For the within-host viral infection, about 80% COVID-19 patients exhibit

44

mild symptoms and recover within 3~4 weeks after regular treatments (2). The severe

45

and critical COVID-19 patients (~20%) are related to lymphopenia, high neutrophil

46

counts and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or cytokine storm, characterized by

47

elevated inflammatory cytokines levels like IL-6. CRS and succeeding comorbidities

48

usually cause bad clinical outcome and even death, although the overall intensity of the

49

cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients is milder than SARS patients (3).

50

More studies and evidences show that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, compared to SARS-

51

CoV and MERS-CoV, in the early infection period tends to induce less effective anti-

52

viral innate immune responses with a delayed or lower type-I interferon (IFN) response

53

and lower HLA-II expression level (4, 5). Furthermore, marked lymphopenia and

54

impaired humoral immunity with the loss of germinal centers (6) suggest that the weak

55

adaptive immune response could contribute to damped clearance of virus and thus

56

chronic infection.

57

Though the knowledge and clinical data of COVID-19 is increasing, a systemic view

58

of immunologic response in SARS-CoV-2 infection remains necessary. Due to the

59

variance in immune status and response dynamic processes among patients, it is hard to

60

make up an effective therapeutic schedule, for example, the effects of remdesivir, IFN-γ

61

and antibodies remain controversial (7-13).

62

Here, we investigated the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection by

63

analyzing the longitudinal hemogram data of 194 patients from Wuhan Union Hospital

64

and also by mathematical modeling the within-host immune dynamics. We constructed

65

within-host virus-immune interaction network, together with a mathematical model

66

depicting the dynamic processes and the response of the innate immunity and adaptive

67

immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. We simulated and classified the different

68

modes of patient’s immune responses, which correspond to the longitudinal data of

69

COVID-19 patients, and we propose the possible treatment strategies to improve the

70

immune status of COVID-19 patients.

71

Immune network and model, immune efficacy and T cell supply

72

The human immune system is a complex defense system involving dozens of

73

different cell types and hundreds of interacting molecular pathways, protecting human

74

body from dangerous pathogens. A mathematical model, which describes the complex

75

interactions in immune system and the demographic differences in patient’s health

76

status, should help us to understand the underlying immune response, to classify the

77

patients based on their immune response processes, and provide possible definitive

78

treatment strategies.

79

We analyzed 194 COVID-19 patients’ longitudinal data from Union Hospital of

80

Tongji Medical College in Huazhong University of Science and Technology (Wuhan,

81

P. R. China), including the hemogram, the serum cytokine profile and treatments at

82

different time points, as well as their clinical classification and outcome. We found that

83

among mild, severe and critical COVID-19 patients, the time sequences of counts of

84

white blood cell, neutrophil and lymphocyte, together with IL-6 levels in peripheral

85

blood behave significant different, indicating the severity of patients (Fig. 2B). In

86

critical patients, the elevated neutrophil counts and myeloid-derived suppressor cell

87

(MDSC) fraction are significantly greater than the mild and severe patients, which

88

could be accredited to the chronic viral and bacterial co-infection (Fig. S5B).

89

Based on the recent evidences and clinical data about COVID-19, we put forward a

90

possible immune mechanism during SARS-CoV-2 infection: a slow innate immune

91

response in the early infection stage leading to extensive tissue damage and

92

inflammation, and a weak adaptive immune response in later stage resulting in the

93

chronic infection and bad clinical outcome.

94

We simplified both innate and adaptive immune response processes within-host

95

caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and constructed a virus-immune interaction

96

network with the viral infection module, innate immunity, cellular immunity, humoral

97

immunity, and immunosuppression modules (Fig. 1). During the SARS-CoV-2 infection,

98

infected lung epithelial cells recruit innate immune cells through chemokine secretion,

99

including neutrophils (Neut), macrophages (MΦ), dendritic cells (DC), and natural killer

100

cells (NK). These cells serve as the initial immune defense in the virus-immune

101

interaction network against the virus, and secrete the inflammatory cytokines like IL-6

102

and TNF-α. The DC and MΦ engulf and process SARS-CoV-2 specific antigens they

103

encounter, and then they work as antigen-presenting cells (APC) to activate naïve T and

104

B cells. The activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells proliferate and differentiate into effective

105

helper T cells (Th) and cytotoxic T cells (CTL), then travel to the airway and lung

106

fighting against the pathogens. Meanwhile, the germinal centers in lymph nodes form

107

around the pathogen-loaded dendritic cells, where naïve B cells go through affinity

108

maturation with clonal selection and differentiate into plasma cells that produce

109

immunoglobulin (Ig) to clear the virus. During this process, regulatory T cells (Treg) are

110

also activated to prevent the over activation of immune system and turn off the immune

111

response when the virus is cleared.

112

For the sake of simplicity and clarity of the model, we made the following main

113

simplifications and assumptions. (1) We focus on the host immune response in lung

114

and nearby draining lymph nodes (lung area). (2) IL-6 is selected as the key indicator

115

of inflammation. (3) To compare with clinical data, we add the antiviral drug term

116

(parameter  in Eq.2) in our model. (4) We discuss the primary virus infection and

117

immune response, and ignore the process and function of SARS-CoV-2-specific

118

memory T and B cells. (5) The cytokine level in lung is estimated to be 10 times of the

119

peripheral blood cytokines, providing a reference for comparison between modeling

120

results and clinical data. More details about the interactions among virus, immune cells

121

and cytokines can be found in Table 1 of Supplemental Material (SM), and our other

122

assumptions are listed in section 1.2 of SM.

When the naïve CD8+T cells meet and interact with antigen-loaded APCs in the

Modeling typical modes of immune response against SARS-CoV-2
Demographically, the immune system’s capability and response vary individually,

189

susceptible to age, fitness and gender differences (14, 15). In Fig. 2A, we adopted

190

Latin hypercube sampling method (16) to search across the parameter space and

191

identified three typical modes of the immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 infection,

192

where they differ in the extent of tissue damage, final state viral load and immune

193

response, in particular the levels of host immune efficacy e and supply ability sCD 8 .

194

We also defined asymptomatic patients by underactive immune and inflammatory

195

response. Full trajectory of the three immune modes and asymptomatic patients can be

196

found in Fig. S2A and their definitions in Table S2 of SM. Parameter sample range and

197

initial value choice can be found in section 7 of SM. Sampled curves are aligned at

198

[nCoV]=106/mL.

199

During the early stage of infection, the post admission days (PAD) 0~7, a faster and

200

stronger innate immunity is evoked in the mode 1 patients, protecting lung tissue from

201

viral damage. For the mode 2 and 3 patients, delayed and weaker innate immunity

202

brings about more extensive damages with higher viral load, manifested in Fig. S2C

203

and D of SM. During the middle stage (PAD 7~14), the adaptive immunity of mode 1

204

and 2 patients is built up successfully, providing the patients with strong immune

205

efficacy, averaged at emax  12 , which is enough to clear the virus and kill the infected

206

cells. For the mode 2 patients, the accumulated tissue damage at early stage over-

207

activates the innate immunity, especially neutrophils and monocytes and thus causes

208

temporary cytokine storm. The mode 3 patients’ immune response stays low at about

209

e  3.5 , possibly attributed to limited antibody production and inadequate CD8+ T cell

210

supply. During the late stage (PAD 14+), the mode 1 and 2 patients recover from the

211

infection, however the mode 3 patients experience chronic infection and 23% end up

212

with naïve CD8+T cell pool insufficiency (denoted as insufficient sCD8 ). Time course of

213

1/ sCD 8 and e of the three modes are shown in Fig. 2C and Fig. 2D.

214

In comparison to mode 2, mode 3 is more likely to appear in older patients with

215

underlying diseases, including but not limited to hypertension and diabetes mellitus,

216

for their fragile immune systems. This view is also supported by recent study on the

217

association between adaptive immunity and age (18). In addition to these, in mode 3,

218

long-termed damage of lung epithelial cells and inadequate immune efficacy could

219

possibly induce secondary bacterial or fungal infection, discussed in section 7 of SM,

220

thus lead to overactive inflammatory response and cytokine storm. Therefore, patients

221

with mode 3 response are more likely to be critical and should be paid with extra

222

attention.

Classification of patients and relevant treatment strategies

To understand the dynamical features and processes of COVID-19 patients’

241

immune response, we investigated the longitudinal data of hemogram and cytokine

242

profile of 64 patients (out of 194 patients) with multiple cytokine data points (≥4)

243

from Wuhan Union Hospital in China. All patients were divided into mild & moderate,

244

severe and critical groups based on their clinical symptoms, according to the 7th

245

Version of the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Guidance (19).

246

Here we mainly focus on the immune response features of the COVID-19 patients,

247

which imposes huge impact on patient’s clinical status. Similar to the immune efficacy

248

e , we define the clinical efficacy of innate and adaptive cellular immunity of patients

249

as e* (t )  Neut %(t )   Monocyte%(t )  Lymphocyte%(t )  , where Neut %(t ) ,

250

Monocyte%(t ) , Lymphocyte%(t ) are respectively the proportion of neutrophils,

251

monocytes and lymphocytes in peripheral blood at time point t .

252

In Fig. 3A, we classified the patients by their IL-6 level and averaged e* value ( e* )
e*  0.15

253

into three classes. The class 1 profile (31 patients) has

254

IL-6max < 200 pg/mL , includes 15 mild patients and 16 severe patients. The class 2

255

profile (20 patients) has e*  0.15 and IL-6max > 200 pg/mL , includes 9 mild, 10

256

severe and 1 critical patient. The class 3 profile (8 patients) has e*  0.15 and

257

IL-6max > 200 pg/mL , includes 1 severe and 7 critical patients. 5 patients belong to none

258

of the above groups and are taken as exceptions.

259

and

In Fig. 3B, we aligned and averaged the time course of the three classes patients’

260

peripheral blood cell and cytokine profile. We particularly fixed the class 2 and 3

261

patients’ IL-6 peak at the 30th day and smoothed the curve using a triple-window

262

averaging method (see this method in section 5.1 of SM). Time series data of the three

263

classes patients differ significantly in the neutrophil, lymphocyte, IL-6, IL-10 level and

264

immune efficacy. The class 1 patients exhibit low neutrophil counts, low IL-6 level

265

(milder inflammatory response), high lymphocyte counts and high e* level, indicating

266

mild symptom and effective immune response. The class 1 patients are less likely to

267

temporarily stronger inflammatory response (higher IL-6 level) than the class 1, whose

269

IL-6 peak usually has a 3-day full width at half maximum (FWHM). The class 3

270

patients show a longer period of cytokine storm status with IL-6 peak and a 13-day

271

FWHM. In addition, the class 3 patients with lymphopenia and low e* value suggest

272

the incompetent immune response and possible exhaustion of T cells; the significantly

273

elevated level of neutrophils and IL-10 peak with a 7-day FWHM might indicate the

274

occurrence of secondary bacterial infection and the emergence of MDSC, both could

275

attribute to chronic infection and poor clinical outcome.

276

Thus, we correspond the class 1, 2 and 3 COVID-19 patients to the in silico mode

277

1, 2 and 3 immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection respectively. We hope our

278

immunity-based classification method can serve as an indicator of patient’s immune

279

response and clinical conditions.

blood. (A) We identify 31 patients as the class 1 profile (15 mild & moderate patients, 16 severe patients),
20 patients as the class 2 profile (9 mild & moderate patients, 10 severe patients and 1 critical patient) and
8 patients as the class 3 profile (1 severe patient and 7 critical patients). (B) Averaged time series of the
class 1, 2 and 3 patients. Compared to the steady curve of class 1 patients, class 2 and 3 patients show
different extent of inflammation, characterized by the level and width of IL-6 peak. In addition, the class
3 patients show low e* level.

291

with different immune response modes, we simulated their disease processes and

292

possible clinic outcomes, and try to put forward the available treatment strategies.

293

The main treatment strategies of COVID-19 are to prevent the potential chronic

294

infection and cytokine storm, increase the immune efficacy, and moderately inhibit

295

excessive inflammatory response. Here we consider several mostly discussed agents for

296

COVID-19: (1) Antiviral drugs (AntV), preventing viral cell entry or inhibiting the

297

production of new progeny virus (20). (2) IFN-γ, increasing innate immune response and

298

augmenting the successive adaptive immune response (21). (3) Monoclonal antibody

299

(Ig), blocking viral receptor activation, suppressing the virus and modifying the

300

inflammatory response (22). (4) Glucocorticoids (GC), preventing excessive immune

301

response that causes extensive tissue damage and inhibiting cytokines from production

302

and taking effects (23, 24).

303

We simulated the course of disease of in silico patients without any treatments, and

304

examined the outcome of different treatment strategies to determine the effect of the

305

above drugs and find reasonable combination of treatments. To quantify our results, we

306

defined a model-based Q value to assess patient’s status and examine the effects of the

307

above medications. The scoring function Q includes patient’s maximum immune

308

*
efficacy emax
, respiratory capacity (defined by minimum healthy lung epithelial cells

309

[ H ]min ), inflammation level (defined by maximum IL-6 level [ IL  6]max ), and whether

310

chronic infection happens. It is formulated as:

313

[ IL  6]c  2000 pg / mL . The Kronecker function [ nCoV ] equals to 1 when final viral

314

load is zero, equals to 0 when virus is not cleared.

315

We first assessed the effect of the above drugs used singly on the in silico patients

316

in different modes, illustrated by the change in Q value, as in Fig. 4A. Treatment

317

periods are divided into early (PAD 0~7), middle (PAD 7~14) and late stage (PAD

318

14+) referred to the estimation in (17). Effects of AntV, IFN-γ, Ig are positive during

319

early stage for their role in limiting virus invasion and tissue damage, effect of GC is

320

also positive during early stage for prevention of CRS. During middle stage, AntV and

321

IFN-γ change little of the patients’ score, but AntV is still recommended during the

322

whole course of disease for preventing superinfection (this situation is seen in our

323

simulation results). Usage of GC on mode 1 and 2 patients during middle stage

324

decreases patient’s Q score and is not recommended. Middle and late stage Ig benefits

325

the most on mode 3 patients for their role in cooperating with host’s immunity.

326

We next tested all combinations of treatment strategies with different kinds of drugs

327

used during different stages of in silico patients with reasonable treatment strategies

328

summarized in Fig. S8. Antiviral drugs are recommended during the whole course of

329

infection. The mode 1 patients only need antiviral drugs for their recovery. For mode 2

330

patients, usage of IFN-γ accents innate immune efficacy and helps contain the initial

331

tissue damage, while usage of GC can reduce inflammation in advance of cytokine storm.

332

For mode 3 patients, cytokine storm lasts longer thus it is desired to prolong the usage

333

of GC during early and middle stage, while during the late stage monoclonal antibodies

334

act as backup for adaptive immunity and help clear the virus. Simulation results

335

(ensemble averaged) for mode 2 and 3 patients with the above treatment strategies are

336

shown in Fig. 4C and D. To assist with the formation of treatment plans, we adopted

337

CPCA on our simulation results and identified several early stage biomarkers

338

distinguishing the patients into mode 1, 2, and 3, including viral load, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-

339

α and Ig, shown in Fig. S5 in SM.

340

Bacterial co-infection is tested positive in more than 50% of the deceased patients

341

(2, 25), which we also found clinically. We simulated the course of disease with

342

bacterial co-infection arising from mode 2 and 3, and denoted them as mode 2*, mode

343

3.1* and mode 3.2*, where mode 3.1* patients end up with uncleared virus, while

344

mode 2* and mode 3.2* patients become virus-negative. Detailed assumptions,

345

definitions and time courses concerning bacterial co-infection are in section 7 in SM.

346

In bacterial co-infection, antibiotics (AntBio) is also included into treatment plans.

347

Similar to Fig. 4A, we assessed the effect of each drug in mode 2*, 3.1* and 3.2*

348

patients, shown in Fig. 4B. Effect of early usage of GC alone turns negative due to its

349

immunosuppressive effect, which in turn increases tissue damage and chances of

350

bacterial co-infection, leading to extensive inflammatory response induced by bacteria.

351

However, early and middle usage of GC, accompanied by AntBio, still makes a

352

favorable plan, as shown in Fig. 4E.

Discussion

370

The immune system is a complex defense system that protects us from the pathogens,

371

including virus, bacteria, parasites and other invaders. The response and regulation of

372

immune system involve dozens of cell types and hundreds of signal molecules with

373

different ligand-receptor interactions, while these lymphocytes and molecules circulate

374

in the whole body to clear invaders and kill infected cells. The immune system usually

375

works quickly, effectively and resiliently. It prepares in advance through lymphocyte

376

abundance and pool; it learns from experience by memory lymphocyte. On the other

377

hand, it has checks and balance to prevent the over activation of immune system.

378

However, when a new virus or invader infect the host and there is no effective drug

379

treatment, the host immune system might lose the balance and exhaust the lymphocyte

380

abundance and pool. This may result in poor clinical outcome and even the epidemic

381

spread. In the last decade of the twentieth century, during the treatment of HIV, hepatitis

382

B virus and hepatitis C virus infection, the mathematical modeling interpreting

383

quantitative clinical data has made a significant contribution to understand the dynamics

384

of these viruses and the drug treatment strategy (26-30).

385

Since 2019, the ongoing of COVID-19 pandemic has sickened millions and killed

386

more than 1 million people worldwide. There is still a lack of reliable effective treatment

387

strategies toward the different immune status in patients. In this study, we constructed a

388

mathematical model to describe the dynamic response of immune system. We classified

389

the COVID-19 development processes into three typical modes of immune responses,

390

and put forward effective treatment strategies for relevant immune response processes.

391

In this work, we only focus on the immune response, and ignore other clinical symptoms

392

such as multiple system and organ failure and pathological damage of other organs. We

393

simplified the innate and adaptive immune network and chose CD4+ and CD8+ T cells

394

to motivate and orchestrate the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. More

395

quantitative and multiple time point clinical data are needed to verify our model and

396

predictions, especially the treatment strategies for different modes of immune response.

397

In our recent unpublished work, we are investigating more types of immune cells

398

including the memory T and B cells, the bacteria infection and MDSC, together with the

399

recirculation among blood, lung, lymph node, spleen and bone marrow. In addition, we

400

hope our work can help to classify the patients clinically by their early period hemograms

401

and cytokine profiles, and to choose effective treatments based on their dynamic immune

402

status. Furthermore, we hope that our approach can be adapted to other kinds of viral

403

and bacterial infections, and can be applied to describe and predict the cytokine storm

404

on CAR-T immune treatment (31, 32).

405

In summary, our work provides a quantitative framework about the complex

406

interactions between virus infection and host immune response. More feedbacks with

407

clinical treatment and data will help us to obtain the systemic and quantitative

408

understanding of dynamics that immune system responds to the infection of SARS-Cov-

409

2 virus.
