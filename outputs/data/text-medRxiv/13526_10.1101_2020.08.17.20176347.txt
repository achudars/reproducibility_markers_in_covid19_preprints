Abstract

12

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak is the biggest public health challenge in the last 100

13

years. No successful pharmaceutical treatment is yet available, thus effective public health interventions

14

to contain COVID-19 include social distancing, isolation and quarantine measures, however the

15

efficiency of these containment measures varied among countries and even within states in the same

16

country. Despite Brazil being deeply affected by coronavirus, the federal government never proposed a

17

coordinated action to control COVID-19 and Brazilian states, which are autonomous, each imposed

18

different containment measures. The state of Goiás declared strict social distancing measures in March

19

13, but gradually relaxed many of its first measures due specially to public pressure. Here we use a

20

Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model combined with Bayesian inference and a time-dependent

21

spreading rate to assess how past state-level interventions affected the spread of COVID-19 in Goiás.

22

The interventions succeeded in decreasing the transmission rate in the state, however, after the third

23

intervention the rate remained positive and exponential. Thus, other stricter interventions were made

24

necessary to avoid the growth of new cases and a collapse in the health system. Governmental

25

interventions need to be taken seriously by the population in order for them have the proposed outcome.

26

Our results reflect the population’s disregard with the measures imposed and the need for cooperation

27

between governments and its citizens in the fight against COVID-19.

Introduction

33

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caught the world by surprise, as in three

34

months it went from a public health emergency of international concern to a global pandemic (1).

35

This is the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus, since the severe acute respiratory syndrome

36

coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) is highly transmissible and causes a pathogenic viral infection (2).

37

Human to human spread occurs mainly through respiratory droplets and contact routes (2), but

38

the virus can remain infections in aerosols and surfaces up to days (3). While therapies and

39

vaccines are still not available, preventions of disease spread and mitigation of the pandemic

40

relies in non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) such as social distancing, isolation, face

41

covering and quarantine measures (4, 5).

42

43

Despite being recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), the adoption of NPIs

44

varied greatly between countries. The virus emerged first in China, where strict social distancing

45

rules were enforced early and only three months later the spreading was contained (6, 7). Timing

46

of intervention during the outbreak can explain discrepancies in the number of deaths in

47

European countries, where Italy had 525 deaths per million population in contrast to Germany’s

48

95 deaths per million population in the same month (8). As of June, the three countries with the

49

highest number of COVID-19 related deaths are the US, Brazil and the UK (9), all countries

50

where heads of state and government openly spoke against social distancing measures (10–12).

51

52

The first confirmed COVID-19 case in Brazil was registered on February 25, in the city of São

53

Paulo (13). By March, it had already reached all 26 states and the Federal District (14). By June

54

25 Brazil reported over one million confirmed cases and a total of 58,314 deaths (9). The states

55

with the higher and lower confirmed cases were São Paulo and Mato Grosso do Sul, with

56

275,145 and 7,965 cases, respectively (9). States are autonomous under the Brazilian constitution

57

(15), nonetheless, there was no coordinated action to control COVID-19 by the federal

58

government.

59

60

Most state governors enforced restrictive contact measures in mid-March, when the virus began

61

spreading. However, the president of the Federal Government has been vocally against state-

62

level social distancing policies, citing frequently his fear of an economic collapse (16). In fact,

63

president Bolsonaro passed a provisional measure in April which entrusted to the Union

64

prerogatives concerning isolation, quarantine and the interdiction of locomotion, public services

65

and essential activities during the pandemic (17). This measure was quickly overruled by the

66

Supreme Federal Court of Justice, instating the Union could legislate on the subject but must

67

always safeguard the autonomy of states and municipalities (17). This political confrontation

68

deepened an already existing rift in the population, with Bolsonaro’s supporters positioning

69

themselves against states and municipalities’ COVID-19 containment measures.

70

71

Brazil is a continental sized country with substantial regional socioeconomic inequalities, all

72

factors that further reduce support for social distancing measures (14), and results in different

73

containment measures in different states. In April, while cities such as Manaus, Fortaleza,

74

Brasília, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo faced an exponential growth of COVID-19 cases (18),

75

southern states Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul started to reopen their economies without

76

many registered cases (Pellegrini, 2020; Silva et al., 2020 [in press]). The state of Goiás was

77

amongst the leaders of social isolation, registering in March over 60% of reduced mobility

78

monitored via geolocation in smartphones (21). That percentage eventually dropped and, more

79

recently, Goiás recorded only 37% of reduced mobility, one of the worst rates of isolation in the

80

country (21). As a consequence, cases and deaths started to increase fast.

81

82

The first confirmed COVID-19 case in Goiás was registered on March 12. By March 13, the

83

state government issued a decree declaring public health emergency and instituted strict social

84

distancing measures. However, due to public and economic pressure, the government gradually

85

relaxed many of its first measures (22). Thus, in this paper we seek to detect if change points in

86

the effective growth rate of COVID-19 correlates with governmental interventions made in

87

Goiás. We use a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model combined with Bayesian inference

88

and a time-dependent spreading rate (23) to assess the early transmission dynamics and evaluate

89

the effectiveness of the state-level interventions. Short-term forecasts such as this are key to

90

estimate medical requirements and capacities, and here we use it to assess how past mitigations

91

affected the spread of COVID-19 in the state.

and parameters accordingly.

101

102

SIR models have been used broadly to model epidemic spreads (24, 25), and recently gained

103

strength in efforts to model the spread of COVID-19 worldwide (23, 26, 27). SIR models specify

104

the rates that population recover and become infected by a disease. Bayesian inference with

105

MCMC sampling assimilates prior knowledge available and accounts for data uncertainties into

106

forecasts. An integration between Bayesian inference and SIR models provide a better

107

assessment of more complex and realistic models (28). Here we ran (1) an SIR model for the

108

initial onset period with stationary spreading rate (simple SIR model) and (2) a time-dependent

109

SIR model with weekend correction (full SIR model) (23).

110

111

Goiás characterization and data

112

The state of Goiás is located in the mid-west region of Brazil and has a population of

113

approximately 7 million people (29). The Federal District, along with the country’s capital

114

Brasília, is geographically embedded within the State of Goiás, but due to administrative

115

differences and independence of public health policies, here we analyze only data for Goiás.

116

Daily number of COVID-19 confirmed cases in Goiás came from the Goiás State Health

117

Department (SES-GO; acronym in Portuguese). SES-GO systematically monitors suspected

118

cases throughout the state and provides daily updates of confirmed cases (30). We used data until

119

May 22.

120

121

Governmental interventions

122

As of May 22, Goiás had amounted 14 decrees regarding the coronavirus pandemic. Most of

123

these decrees are relaxations of the first decree, such as reopening churches and temples. To

124

implement and maintain the model simple, we chose the three main decrees capable of

125

influencing public behavior (Fig. 1).

126

127

The first intervention chosen was the first decree announced on March 13. In this decree the state

128

declares a public health emergency and institutes strict social distancing measures, such as the

129

shutdown of public and private events of any nature, including educational institutions at all

130

levels, daycares, suspension of commercial activities such as malls, fairs, gyms, dental health

131

services, religious meetings and all other non-essential services and activities (31).

132

133

The second intervention chosen was the decree from April 3rd, which was already the eighth

134

decree announced and the fourth relaxing the measures stated in the first one. This decree

135

accumulates all prior flexibilizations, including reopening of religious activities, beauty salons,

136

vegetable and fruit fairs, car workshops and restaurants on highways, administrative activities in

137

public and private educational institutions (31).

138

139

On April 19, the government launched a new decree extending the health emergency in Goiás for

140

another 150 days. However, on April 24, they announced another decree altering the decree from

141

04/19, legislating on the private sphere as well (suspending activities of common use in closed

142

condominiums), regulating a channel for reporting disobediences to any of the decrees, and

143

legislating specific days for religious celebrations (31). We chose the intervention on April 24 as

144

the third changing point, as we see it to be more rigorous than previous ones.

145

146

Simple SIR model: stationary spreading rate

147

We considered the initial onset transmission phase as being between March 6 and 20,

148

approximately seven days before and after the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Goiás. Central

149

epidemiological parameters for this model are the spreading rate (λ), recovery rate (μ), reporting

150

delay (D) and number of initially infected people (I0) (23). We chose informative log-normal

151

priors of λ = 0.3 and μ = 0.11 (Table 1), as these priors cannot be estimated independently and

152

these values maintain the effective growth rate (λ* = λ - μ) with a median of 0.19 and the basic

153

reproduction number (R0 = λ / μ) with a median of 2.72, consistent with global (32) and local

154

(33) estimates. We chose for the reporting delay a prior that incorporates the virus’ incubation

155

period between 1-14 days and the delay of infected people awaiting tests confirmation or medical

156

appointments. Flat priors were chosen for the I0 and scale factor.

157

158

Full SIR model: weekly reporting modulation and change points in spreading rate

159

To simulate the effect of governmental interventions, we use a SIR model with incorporated

160

change points capable of altering the transmission rate (23). The aim of interventions is to reduce

161

the effective growth rate, thus if the rate becomes negative, new infections will begin to

162

decrease. Dehning’s model assumes new spreading rates for each change point, inferred after

163

supposed behavioral changes in the population.

164

165

We chose the same log-normal distributed priors for λ0, μ and D as in the simple model, with

166

added parameters for the change points and their spreading rates (Table 2). We assumed the first

167

government intervention reduced the spreading rate by 50% from the initial estimate λ0 = 0.3, so

168

the prior for the first change point is λ1 ~ logNormal (log (0.15), 0.5). Given the flexibilizations

169

in the following decrees, we assumed the spreading rate would increase again by 15%, thus λ2 ~

170

logNormal (log (0.22), 0.5). For the third intervention, there was more rigidity in the social

171

distancing measures, which we presumed was embraced by the population. Therefore, we

172

assumed the prior decreases the spreading rate and is closer (but slightly inferior) to the rate of

173

the first intervention λ3 ~ logNormal (log (0.11), 0.5).

174

175

We chose normal distributed priors for the timing of change points (Table 2). Respectively t1 ~

176

Normal (2020/03/13, 3), t2 ~ Normal (2020/04/03, 1) and t3 ~ Normal (2020/04/24, 1), where 3,

177

1 and 1 are the respective transient days. Following the logic of the aforementioned decrees, we

178

assumed the first intervention as a strict contact ban, the second as a mild contact ban and the

179

third as again a strict contact ban. The change points take effect after a period of time (Δti), for

180

which we chose a median of 3 days. During these 3 days, spreading rates are expected to change

181

for interventions to take effect. Furthermore, time is needed to ensure a smooth transition capable

182

of absorbing the changes in the population's behavior (23).

183

184

Priors chosen for the recovery rate, reporting delay and initial number of infected people were

185

the same as those applied in the simple SIR model (Table 1). The number of tests and reported

186

cases varies throughout the week, with the number of records expected to be lower on weekends

187

(23). To implement the weekend effect in the model, we modulate the number of cases inferred

188

by the absolute value of a sine function with the total period of 7 days (23). This function was

189

chosen by Dehning et al. (2020) because it is a non-symmetrical oscillation, adjusting the weekly

190

variation of cases. We chose flat priors for the I0, scale factor and weekly modulation phase.

191

192

Model comparison

193

Following (23), we ran a model comparison using the leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation

194

method to avoid an over-fitting forecast. We compared four full SIR models with zero, one, two,

195

and three change points, respectively. The full SIR model with three change points presented a

196

better match between model and data (Table 3), as indicated by a lower LOO score. Full SIR

197

models with zero, one and two change points performed poorly and will not be further discussed

198

(but see Fig.S1-S2).

199

200

We also ran a model comparison with three change points but no weekend modulation and three

201

sensitivity analyses by choosing wider priors to different parameters (23). The model without a

202

weekend modulation removes the assumption that daily reporting of new cases happens mainly

203

during weekdays. The inferred parameters for this model are similar to the model that has the

204

modulation, except for the number of initial infections (Fig. S3), but had a higher LOO-score

205

when compared. For the sensitivity analysis, all parameters and priors were maintained exactly

206

as the full SIR model, except were indicated. We ran a model with a prior four times wider for

207

the reporting delay (Fig. S4), a model with a prior 14 days wide for the change times (Fig. S5)

208

and a model with a prior four times wider for the change duration (Fig. S6). The full SIR model

209

with three change points and weekly modulation again performed better than other models given

210

the lower LOO-score (Table S1).

211

212

Results

213

The daily reported cases in Goiás did not present an exponential curve in the simple SIR model

214

with stationary spreading rate (Fig.2A), and the total reported cases (accumulated cases) show a

215

tendency to be exponential (Fig.2B). The spreading rate was adjusted by the model as λ = 0.16

216

(95% credible interval (CI [0.07, 0.33]; Fig.2E)) and the effective growth rate as λ* = 0.04

217

(Fig.2H), values lower than our prior. Further, μ and D histograms match the priors (gray line),

218

as expected by the model (23). The data for the initial phase is scarce and noisy, partly because

219

the initial cases were not local infections, but of contaminated people arriving in Goiás. We

220

expect the initial onset phase to be better explained by another phenomenon, such as migration of

221

people coming from other states, not captured by our model. Thus, we will not be discussing

222

these results further.

223

224

In the full SIR model with change points and weekly reporting modulation, we found evidence of

225

the influence of the three change points (Fig.3). First, the spreading rate decreased from λ0 = 0.28

226

(CI [0.12, 0.42]) to λ1 = 0.21 (CI [0.16, 0.29]). The date for the first change point was inferred as

227

March 13 (CI [9, 21]), a date that marks the first state decree with strict contact ban measures.

228

After this intervention, the effective growth rate was a median of λ0 - μ = 0.18 to median λ1- μ =

229

0.11, given μ was inferred as 0.10 (CI [0.07,0.14]).

230

231

At the second change point, λt decreased from λ1 = 0.21 to λ2 = 0.14 (CI [0.11, 0.19]), lower than

232

assumed by our prior. This date was inferred as April 3 (CI [2, 6]), which marks the

233

accumulation of flexibilizations from four decrees to first decree of March 13, including the

234

reopening of religious events and fruit and vegetable fairs. After the second intervention, the

235

median growth rate was λ2 - μ = 0.04, in the vicinity of a critical point (close to zero), but still

236

positive.

237

238

The third change point increased λ2 = 0.14 to λ3 = 0.19 (CI [0.14, 0.25]). This change point was

239

inferred to be April 24 (CI [23, 27]), a stricter decree compared to the previous ones. After this

240

measure, the effective growth rate was of λ3 - μ = 0.09, indicating an increase in the growth,

241

remaining above zero and thus not decreasing the number of new infections.

242

243

Discussion

244

Given our results, the first two state-level interventions drastically reduced the COVID-19

245

spreading rate in Goiás. We expected the second intervention to increase the spreading rate,

246

given prior relaxations, but the rate dropped. A plausible explanation could be that despite the

247

relaxations of non-essential stores and services, the population obeyed social distancing.

248

Nonetheless, the third intervention, although stricter than the second, brought the transmission

249

rate back to a rate similar to that of the first intervention. We expected the third intervention to

250

result in a similar transmission rate to that of the first intervention, but in the model, the

251

transmission rate increased. This result probably reflects an accumulation of all fourteen state-

252

level decrees and the population’s fatigue of being isolated, which probably resulted in more

253

people eventually circulating in public spaces.

254

255

The transmission rates found in our model match the patterns found in a study that calculated

256

time-series of the effective reproductive number (Rt) in Goiás (Diniz-Filho, Jardim, Toscano, &

257

Rangel, 2020 [in press]). They found Rt to be around 2.0 in mid-March, dropping to

258

approximately 1.2 in mid-April and increasing slowly to 1.4-1.5 in May. If we convert our

259

transmission rates to R (R = 1 + λ * 5.2; where 5.2 is the serial interval) we get R = 2.1 for the

260

first intervention in March 13, R = 1.2 for the second intervention in April 3 and R = 1.5 for the

261

third intervention in April 24. Both our models reflect the effects of the early social distancing

262

measures implemented in Goiás in reducing the diseases’ onset transmission.

263

264

When this model was applied to Germany it demonstrated that following a gradual linear path of

265

interventions, first banning major public events, later announcing mild social distancing

266

measures and finally a strict contact ban (23), aided in decreasing the transmission rate, bringing

267

it to almost zero. Goiás followed an almost inversed path, imposing a first decree with strict

268

social distancing measures at an early stage, but eventually reopening many specific services and

269

activities. Nonetheless, if no social distancing measure had been imposed in Goiás, up to 62% of

270

the population would have been infected by June 2nd (35), representing approximately 4 million

271

people in the state. Further, it was also estimated that the interventions in Goiás prevented

272

between 2.834 and 3.407 COVID-19 deaths (35).

273

274

Although state-level interventions succeeded in decreasing the transmission rate, it remained

275

high and exponential. Thus, other stricter interventions were made necessary to avoid the growth

276

of new cases and a collapse in the health system. Nonetheless, more restrictive measures for the

277

containment of COVID-19 were not adopted and were only discussed again in late June, when

278

confirmed cases spiked. Our model forecasted for June 14 approximately 8.187 total reported

279

cases (Fig. 3C), at that date, the state registered 7.944 confirmed cases (30), a difference of 243

280

cases that could be explained by under testing and reporting delays.

281

282

Because no countries reached herd immunity (8), second waves of infections are expected as

283

well as more interventions to control them. Unfortunately, the accordion effect in COVID-19

284

spreading rate is not exclusive to Goiás. There have been new local outbreaks in 11 European

285

countries, regions that previously lowered infection rates and were starting to lift restrictions

286

(36). Melbourne, in Australia, had to reimpose stay-at-home measures after a high increase of

287

positive cases, including a border closure (37). Governmental interventions need to be taken

288

seriously by the population in order for them have the proposed outcome. Our results reflect the

289

population’s disregard with the measures imposed. In contrast, countries with non-compulsory

290

measures, such as Japan and Uruguay, experienced relatively low numbers of confirmed cases

291

and deaths, as population self-isolated (38, 39).

292

293

The COVID-19 outbreak poses itself as the biggest public health challenge in the last 100 years.

294

Many countries around the world took drastic measures of social distancing and even complete

295

lockdowns to contain it. Biomedical research on COVID-19 has boosted in the last six months

296

and had many advances in clinical testing, drug repurposing and candidate vaccines (40). While

297

no effective treatment is made available, the better and safest way to successfully fight this

298

pandemic is still social distancing and isolation, perhaps for an undetermined period of time.

299

Governments (on any level) need cooperation from its citizens to succeed in containing COVID-
