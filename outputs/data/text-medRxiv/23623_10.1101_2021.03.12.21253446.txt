Abstract
The implementation of Non Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI), triggered by the emergence
of covid-19, decrease the RSV circulation. Data, from our ongoing surveillance; show a late
introduction of RSV at the end of December and a 4 month delayed epidemic start without
significant change in our NPI policy. This data indicates that RSV still have the potential to
give a late season outbreak in northern hemisphere. RSV surveillance should be reinforced
and RSV Pharmaceutical Interventions maintained for at risk neonate

The emergence of COVID-19 triggered the massive implementation of NonPharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) including social distancing, school closures, travel
restrictions, and the use of masks in public spaces. It is now certain that these policy measures
have reduced the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 but have also affected other circulating
respiratory viruses such as Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Influenza Virus (1). Indeed,
no active circulation of RSV or Flu was observed at the end of January 2021 in the northern
hemisphere although initial incidence cases in 2019 and 2020 were observed as soon as
september (2). Recent reports from Australia (3) described an inter-seasonal RSV epidemic in
Australian children following the reduction of COVID-19–related public health measures from
September 2020 to January 2021. This unexpected inter-seasonal RSV resurgence was also
reported in South Africa (4).
As previously described, we prospectively collected hospital laboratory data (5) and
newborn cohort data (6) from the University Hospital of Lyon (HCL; Hospices Civils de Lyon)
for the purpose of RSV surveillance in the Lyon metropolitan area (approximately 1.5 million
inhabitants). A case was defined as any laboratory-confirmed RSV detected by nucleic acid
amplification. A severe case was defined as an admission in the first year of life to one of the
conventional paediatric hospital departments with a RSV positive sample. The incidence rate
of severe cases was estimated per 1,000 births in the HCL newborn cohorts (8 958 births in
2020).
The RSV epidemics have had a major annual seasonal pattern in Lyon with the first
cases usually detected at week 41 followed by a peak at the end of the year around week 51 (6).
In 2020, the first RSV cases of the 20/21 season were detected in Lyon at week 46 and 47
(Figure 1) at the same time of the southern hemisphere outbreak. A sustained detection of cases
was observed from week 51, which is the expected time of the epidemic peak, to week 5. On
week 6, the RSV epidemic was declared in the first French region (Ile de France) while the

number of RSV cases has continued to increase in the Lyon population (7). Subtyping indicated
a predominant RSV-A epidemic (50 RSV-A/52 RSV subtyped by week 9). A late peak in RSV
circulation had already been observed in February in our population during the 2010/2011 RSV
season. The reason for such late circulation remain unknown so far. The fact that it was the first
season after the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic or the extreme climatic event observed during
December 2010 (one of the colder december ever record) may have play a role. Taken together,
these 2 atypical seasons highlight the potential for late RSV transmission when collective
immunity is not reached.

Figure 1: Number of RSV cases per week at the Lyon hospital virology department during
the 2020/21, 2019/20, 2010/11 winter. Our surveillance data indicates that the first RSV were
introduced in Lyon when an inter-seasonal RSV epidemic start in the southern hemisphere with
a 8-month delay. The RSV epidemic is finally starting in Lyon with a 4-month delay at the end
of the winter season without a significant change in the NPI strategy.
No obvious change in COVID-19 NPI measures since September 2020 could explain
the increased number of RSV cases in our community by the end of February 2021. For
example, the Oxford calculated stringency level for France varied from 63.89 in January to
72.22 end of February (8). The 2-week school closure due to spring holidays in our region

(Weeks 7 to 8) may have delayed the start of the RSV epidemic with a significant increase in
the number of cases observed on week 9.
At the time of this report (08/03/2021), the incidence rate for severe cases is still low in
the 2020 birth cohort (4.8 (95% CI 4.0–7.0) severe cases per 1,000 live births) compared with
the 2019 birth cohort (16.6 (95% CI 14.0–19.0) severe cases per 1,000 live births). As already
reported, the incidence rate for severe cases is higher in premature newborns, defined as <37
weeks of gestational age (GA), (9.1 (95% CI 0.4–1.9) severe cases per 1,000 live births (6).
Usually the incidence rate of severe cases is higher for the infant born before the peak (October
and November) compared with those born after (January and February) (6) (Figure 2). For this
late RSV season, we already observe a higher incidence rate of severe cases for the infant born
in December 2020 and January 2021 (Figure 2).

(severe case) is calculated per 1000 births and stratified per month of birth. *Provisional data,
estimated at the time of the report (08/03/2021).
This observation highlights the risk of a late RSV outbreak for northern hemisphere
cities or countries experiencing low levels of RSV circulation despite the implementation of
COVID-19 NPI measures. It can be hypothesized that the seasonal transmission drivers
combined with the increased susceptibility of the infant cohort and the waning RSV immunity
in adults have the potential to overcome the NPI reduction in RSV transmission. NPI may still
contribute to greatly reduce the RSV incidence in an at-risk population (infant and elderly), but
it is too soon to measure its impact. Combined efforts of modelling, genome sequencing, and
sero-epidemiological testing could shed an unprecedented light on the global RSV dynamic and
the NPI impact. This is a major issue as the delayed circulation of RSV and Influenza in an
increasingly susceptible population may have uncertain consequences on our public health
system (9). Northern hemisphere countries should be aware of this probability and ensure that
RSV pharmacological prevention is maintained for at-risk neonates and that RSV and Influenza
surveillance is reinforced.
