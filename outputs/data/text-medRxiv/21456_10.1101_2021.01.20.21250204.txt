Abstract
Background: The COVID-19 outbreak in Japan exhibited its third peak at the end of
2020. Mathematical modelling and developed AI cannot explain several peaks in a
single year.
Object: This study was conducted to evaluate a rule of thumb for prediction from past
wave experiences.
Method: We rescaled the number of newly infected patients as 100% at the peak and
checked similarities among waves. Then we extrapolated the courses of the third and
later waves.
Results: Results show some similarity around the second and the third waves. Based on
this similarity, we expected the bottom of the third wave will show 2131 newly positive
patients including asymptomatic patients at around the end of February, 2021.
Discussion and Conclusion: We can infer the course of the third wave from similarity
with the second wave. Mathematical modelling has been unable to do it, even when AI
was used for prediction. Performance of the rule of thumb used with human intelligence
might be superior to that of AI under these circumstances.

Introduction
Three waves of the COVID-19 outbreak have affected Japan since the emergence
of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China in December, 2019. The third wave peaked at the end of
2020, then declined as of January 17, 2021 (Figure 1).
Prediction of the course of the outbreak is expected to be most important for
countermeasures and preparations for it. Some mathematical modelling [1–3] including
developed AI [4] has been proposed. Nevertheless, it principally cannot explain several
waves in a single year.
By contrast, a “rule of thumb” used with human intelligence reflects information,
knowledge and experience obtained in the past. Such a rule can predict outcomes of the
near future with no rational process necessary. In this sense, a rule of thumb used with
human intelligence has some probability of surpassing the performance of an AI. For
the present study, we apply a rule of thumb with human intelligence to prediction of the
COVID-19 outbreak in Japan.

Method
The numbers of symptomatic patients reported by the Ministry of Health, Labour
and Welfare (MHLW) for January 14 – November 30, published [5] as of December 25

were used. Some patients were excluded from data for Japan: those presumed to be
persons infected abroad or infected as Diamond Princess passengers. Those patients
were presumed not to represent community-acquired infection in Japan. For onset dates
of some symptomatic patients that were unknown, we estimated their onset date from an
empirical distribution with duration extending from onset to the report date among
patients for whom the onset date had been reported.
The following procedure is similar to that used for our earlier research [6,7]. First,
we estimated the onset date of patients for whom onset dates were not reported. Letting
f(k) represent this empirical distribution and letting Nt denote the number of patients for
whom onset dates were not available published at date t, then the number of patients for
whom the onset date was known is t-1. The number of patients for whom onset dates
were unavailable was estimated as f(1)Nt. Similarly, the number of patients with onset
date t-2 and for whom onset dates were not available was estimated as f(2)Nt. Therefore,
the total number of patients for whom the onset date was not available, given an onset
date of s, was estimated as Σk=1f(k)Ns+k for the long duration extending from s.
Moreover, the reporting delay for published data from MHLW might be
considerable. In other words, if s+k is larger than that in the current period t, then s+k
represents the future for period t. For that reason, Ns+k is not observable. Such a

reporting delay leads to underestimation of the number of patients. For that reason, it
must be adjusted as Σk=1t-sf(k)Ns+k /Σk=1t-sf(k). Similarly, patients for whom the onset
dates were available are expected to be affected by the reporting delay. Therefore, we
have Ms|t /Σk=1t-sf(k), where Ms|t represents the reported number of patients for whom
onset dates were within period s, extending until the current period t.
We defined R(t) as the number of infected patients on day t divided by the number
of patients who were presumed to be infectious. The number of infected patients was
calculated from the epidemic curve by the onset date using a distribution of the
incubation period. The distribution of infectiousness in symptomatic and asymptomatic
cases was assumed to be 30% on the onset day, 20% on the following day, and 10% for
the subsequent five days [8].
We rescaled the newly infected symptomatic patients as percentage of the peak in
each wave. The time horizon was also adjusted as peak date was 0. Then we checked
some similarity among waves. If we found some similarity, then we extrapolated it to
the third and later waves. The study period extended from February 10, 2020 to January
10 as of January 17, 2021.

Results
From Figure 1, we found the first peak as March 28. The second was July 28. The third
one was December 28. We defined the first wave as lasting until May 15. The second
wave extended until September 15, 2020. When we rescaled the newly infected
symptomatic cases and adjusted the date, the three lines were aligned as portrayed in
Figure 2. Results showed that the second and third wave were almost identical around
the peak. Therefore, we expected that the line in the third wave declined following the
line in the second wave. Then it can be expected to reach the bottom about 50 days after
the peak. It was expected to be 35% of the peak at the bottom.
The lead time from the bottom to the peak in the following wave was 70 days in the
second wave and 106 days in the third wave. That period corresponds to the end of
April extending to the beginning of June 2021.

Discussion
We expected the bottom of the third wave as around the end of February and starting the
fourth wave at that time. At that time, the newly infected symptomatic patients are

expected to be about 35% of the peak, which was approximately 1,400 symptomatic
patients. Because asymptomatic patients were one third of all tested-positive patients,
one can infer 2,100 positive patients.
Some researchers provided their predictions and policy evaluations [9]. However,
the baseline scenario with no aggressive policy such as requirement of voluntary
restriction for going out or shorter business hours in restaurants was increasing
monotonically for more than three months. Therefore, they certainly failed to
incorporate the fact that the peak of the third wave had already been passed at the end of
last year, 2020.
Google provided AI prediction in Japan [10], as shown in Figure 3. Their prediction
was for the number of newly tested-positive patients each day, which is not the same as
newly infected symptomatic patients inferred in the present study. The Google AI
clearly predicted a monotonic increase until mid-February. Therefore, it is clearly
inconsistent with our prediction based on our rule of thumb. It remains unclear which is
the better prediction at this time. However, as shown in Figure 3, the number of newly
tested-positive patients also appears to be declining in January, although the day of the
week affects the result heavily. Tentatively, as of January 17, 2021, the rule of thumb in
human intelligence appears to be better than AI.

In principle, AI presents greater advantages at finding a rule of thumb than human
intelligence because it can use greater amounts of information and knowledge on many
dimensions. It can evaluate any association at lower cost than human intelligence can.
An AI that is able to use a rule of thumb can be expected to be more powerful than a
rule of thumb with human intelligence. However, at least to date, AIs have been
restricted to using mathematical modelling. They have been abandoned for use in
ascertaining some rule of thumb. Therefore, a rule of thumb used with human
intelligence might be more powerful than an AI restricted to mathematical modelling. In
other words, mathematical modelling appears to be insufficient for predicting the course
of a COVID-19 outbreak.
For the present study, the authors inferred rule of thumb from the prior two waves.
However, only two waves can be expected to provide insufficient information for
precise prediction. Improving and accumulating experience of waves of infection is
expected to improve the precision of the rules of thumb.
Especially, by definition, a rule of thumb can be expected to be very weak for new
situations that one has not experienced, such as vaccine initiation or virus mutation.
Mathematical modelling might resurge in importance for assessing such situations.

Conclusion
We predicted the bottom of the third wave to occur around the end of February,
with approximately 1,400 symptomatic patients at that time. A rule of thumb used with
human intelligence might be better than AI using the mathematical model.
The present study is based on the authors’ opinions: it does not reflect any stance or
policy of their professionally affiliated bodies.
