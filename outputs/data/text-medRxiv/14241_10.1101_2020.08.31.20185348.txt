ABSTRACT Background: Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure (AHRF) is a common
complication of Covid-19 related pneumonia, for which non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with
Helmet Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is widely used. During past epidemics of
SARS and MERS pneumomediastinum (PNM) and pneumothorax (PNX) were common
complications (respectively 1.7-12% and 16,4%) either spontaneous or associated to ventilation.
Methods: Aim of our retrospective study was to investigate the incidence of PNX/PNM in COVID19 pneumonia patients treated with CPAP. Moreover, we examined the correlation between
PNX/PNM and Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) values. We collected data from patients
admitted to “Luigi Sacco” University Hospital of Milan from 21/02/2020 to 06/05/2020 with
COVID-19 pneumonia requiring CPAP. Results: One-hundred-fifty-four patients were enrolled.
During hospitalization 3 PNX and 2 PNM occurred (3.2%). Out of these five patients 2 needed
invasive ventilation after PNX, two died. In the overall population, 42 patients (27%) were treated
with High-PEEP (>10 cmH2O), and 112 with Low-PEEP (≤10 cmH2O). All the PNX/PNM
occurred in the High-PEEP group (5/37 vs 0/112, p<0,001). Conclusion: The incidence of PNX
appears to be lower in COVID-19 than SARS and MERS, but their occurrence is accompanied by
high mortality and worsening of clinical conditions. Considering the association of PNX/PNM with
high PEEP we suggest using the lower PEEP as possible to prevent these complications.

Section 2: What this study adds

•

Incidence of PNX/PNM is lower in COVID19 pneumonia patients during CPAP (3,2%)
than SARS and MERS.

•

Considering mortality rate and need of ETI, occurrence of PNX/PNM worsens prognosis.

•

All the PNX/PNM occurred in the High-PEEP (>10 cmH2O) group (5/37 vs 0/112,
p<0,001).

•

Considering the association of high PEEP (>10 cmH2O) with PNX/PNM, the use of low
PEEP values has to be taken into consideration.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which causes severe disease (with dyspnoea, hypoxia, or
>50 percent lung involvement on imaging within 24 to 48 hours) in 14% of patients, even leading to
critical disease – Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure (AHRF) or Acute Respiratory Distress
Syndrome (ARDS) – in 5%1.
During this novel coronavirus pandemic, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and Continuous Positive
Airway Pressure (CPAP) was widely used to treat AHRF gaining respiratory support2. NIV was
already been used during SARS and MERS epidemic with some evidence of efficacy3-5 and some
works support its use in pneumonia6,7. Moreover, during COVID-19 outbreak the overcrowding of
the ICUs pushed to use a bridge or alternative respiratory support in medical wards. During SARS
epidemic in 2002 NIV was used to treat acute respiratory failure in SARS pneumoniae with
different device: Helmet CPAP, Nasal CPAP, BiPaP3,4. Between many interfaces available for
CPAP therapy, the helmet has been proposed to reduce droplet dispersion and consequently
preventing health care worker’s infection8 during COVID-19 pandemic. For the same reason, the
antimicrobial filter was adopted. In the past epidemics 4 to 15 cmH2O3,4 of positive end-expiratory
pressure (PEEP) have been administered, being higher PEEP contraindicated because of the
elevated incidence of pneumomediastinum (PNM) and pneumothorax (PNX) occurring during
SARS and MERS pneumonia (respectively 1.7-12%9,10 and 16,4%11), either spontaneous or
associated to ventilation. Conversely, these complications have not been reported when NIV was
used for the treatment of common pneumonia patients6,7.
Some cases of PNX and PNM have been recently reported in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia,
most of them spontaneous12-14, in some cases related to NIV15,16 or endotracheal intubation
(ETI)17,18.

The first aim of our study was to assess the incidence of PNX and PNM in COVID-19 pneumonia
patients treated with Helmet CPAP. Moreover, we investigated the correlation between the
incidence of PNX or PNM and the PEEP values used during treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design and setting
We retrospectively analysed data from patients admitted in Hospital Wards of “Luigi Sacco”
University Hospital of Milan from the Emergency Department (ER) or transferred from other
hospitals of Lombardy region from 21/02/2020 to 06/05/2020.
The inclusion criteria were: 1) Chest X-Ray positive for pneumonia SARS-CoV-2 related. SARSCoV-2 infection was defined by the positivity of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction test (rt-PCR) at nose-pharyngeal swab with pneumonia 2) acute hypoxemic respiratory
failure requiring helmet CPAP treatment, according to clinical judgement.
The exclusion criterion was the need of endotracheal intubation (ETI) for any reason except those
who needed ETI after PNX/PNM.
We divided the index population in two groups according to PEEP level used under CPAP ( ≤10
cmH2O and >10 cmH20).
PNX and PNM were documented with chest X-ray, usually carried out for worsening of clinical
conditions .
The study (“REGISTRO DELLE INFEZIONI SOSPETTE E ACCERTATE COVID-19/Studio
Sacco COVID-19)” was approved by the local ethical committee with the registration number
2020/16088.
Statistical Analysis
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was done to evaluate the normality of distribution of data. Qualitative
data were expressed as number and percentage. Chi square or Fisher exact tests were used in
group’s comparison. Quantitative data were expressed as mean, standard deviation, median and

range. Student T-test and Mann-Whitney test (for non-parametric data) were used for comparison
between groups. P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
The statistical analysis of data was done by using Excel (Office program 2010) and SPSS
(statistical package for social science-SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL version 20).

RESULTS
During the observational period 1016 patients were admitted to our Hospital, 194 (19,1%) met the
inclusion criteria. Of them, 40 patients (20,62%) were excluded because they needed ETI. In the
end 154 (15.2%) patients were enrolled.
In Table 1 are summarized clinical characteristics of the examined population; the average age was
68.8 years (± 14.7), 107 were men (69.5%). CPAP was performed with PEEP set up between 5 to
15 cmH2O (modal value 10 cmH2O) and FiO2 from 30% to 100%. The average duration of CPAP
treatment was 174 hours – 6,4 days – with a great inhomogeneity (± 141). Mortality rate for the
whole population was 25.3%.
During the observational period 5 events occurred, of which 3 were PNX and 2 PNM. Between
cases, 3 were male patients, no one had a passed story of smoking or underlying lung disease,
nobody has undergone invasive manoeuvres (as positioning central venous catheter or
thoracentesis). The most relevant features of these five patients are reported in Table 2.
After the event, every patient needed higher FiO2 (from 50-60% to 100%); 2 underwent chest
drainage and subsequently ETI (Figure 1) and then died with a mortality rate of 40%. The average
time elapsed from starting CPAP to the occurrence of PNX/PMN was 180 hours with great
inhomogeneity (±137).
No difference was found in the duration of CPAP treatment between PNX/PMN group and NoPNX/PMN patients (p-value 0.931).
High-PEEP (>10 cmH2O) was administered to 42 (27,3%) patients, and Low-PEEP (≤10 cmH2O)
to 112 (72.7%). As shown in Table 1, no statistical differences in term of characteristics were found

comparing High-PEEP vs Low-PEEP group. The PNX/PNM occurred only in the High-PEEP
group (5/42, 12% vs 0/112, 0%, p<0,001).

DISCUSSION
In our retrospective observational study PNX/PMN occurred in 3.2% of patients; apparently,
nobody had previous risk factors for PNX (no smokers, no lung diseases, no positioning central
venous catheter or thoracentesis). Among these cases, the incidence of negative outcome (mortality
and ETI) is relevant. Moreover, even in survived patients, events were associated with worsening of
clinical conditions with a higher need of FiO2 (50-60% before vs 100% after).
PNX and PNM occurred only in the High-PEEP group (11.9%). Considering the homogeneity of
these groups in terms of clinical and biochemical features, we may suppose that elevated PEEP may
represent a risk factor for PNX/PNM in COVID-19 patients. Conversely, in our population duration
of CPAP treatment was quite variable and does not seem to play a determinant role as risk factor for
events.
The possible effect of barotrauma has to be considered as superimposed to the direct effect of lung
damage related to Covid-19 pneumonia. PNX and PNM occurred rather frequently in SARS and
MERS patients. Some study addressing evolution of lung lesions on CT imaging showed that in
many cases spontaneous PNM occurred when ground glass opacity and consolidations began to
resolve11,19. The pathogenesis of this phenomenon has been interpreted as the effect of the
peribronchiolar inflammatory nodule formation, leading to interstitial pulmonary emphysema,
tracking back along the broncho-vascular sheath and reaching the mediastinum19. On the other
hand, histologic findings (alveolar damage with pulmonary oedema and hyaline membrane
formation) appear to support the hypothesis that severe pulmonary injury predisposes the patient to
spontaneous pneumothorax20. The diffuse alveolar damage may give rise to dilated cystic air spaces
and honeycombing predisposing the lung to air leakage from the rupture of the cystic lesions, with
the consequent development of a pneumothorax. Possible shared mechanisms may underly

PNX/PNM in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia considering the presence of similar lung
damages and imaging features as described for SARS21,22.
In our study PNX/PNM happened after a long time from onset of symptoms (18 days in average)
resembling what previously described in SARS patients10 and suggesting that a sustained period of
lung inflammation might be required. Conversely, we did not find significant differences in the
biochemical elements of disease severity (peak LDH and neutrophil count) that seemed to be
predictable of spontaneous pneumothorax in SARS patients10.
Finally, in the past SARS epidemic someone conjectured that steroid therapy may play a role in the
pathogenesis of spontaneous pneumothorax because it could delay wound healing and perpetuate air
leakage10. In our study only 2 out of 5 patients have been treated with steroid therapy, so we can not
speculate about this hypothesis.
Our study has several limitations. First of all, the number of events is low and for this reason our
results, and in particular the association of PNX/PNM with higher PEEP, has to be confirmed in
multicentric studies with a wider population. Moreover, our study is retrospective: PEEP values
were decided by the clinician for each patient and in particular higher PEEP values have been set in
the first weeks and subsequently lowered on the basis of clinical experience and data emerging from
literature. In the end, we did not collected data about pneumoperitoneum or subcutaneous
emphysema which can be classified as possible barotrauma even if rare.

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, our study indicates that incidence of PNX/PNM is lower in COVID-19 pneumonia
patients than SARS and MERS 9. Nevertheless, the occurrence of these events significantly worsens
the prognosis. Considering the association of high PEEP (>10 cmH2O) with PNX/PNM, the use of
low PEEP values has to be taken into consideration.
