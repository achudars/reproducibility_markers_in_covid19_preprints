Abstract
Brazil has been recording a frightening exponential curve of confirmed cases of
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cancer patients with COVID-19 are likely to have a greater
risk of complications and death. A retrospective search in the electronic medical
records of cancer inpatients admitted to the Brazilian National Cancer Institute from
April 30, 2020 to May 26, 2020 granted identification of 181 patients with COVID19 confirmed by RT-PCR method. The mean age was 55.3 years (SD ±21.1). The
most prevalent solid tumors were breast (40 [22.1%]), gastrointestinal (24 [13.3%]),
and gynecological (22 [12.2%]). Among hematological malignancies, lymphoma
(20 [11%]) and leukemia (10 [5.5%]) predominated. The most common
complications were respiratory failure (70 [38.7%]), septic shock (40 [22.1%]) and
acute kidney injury (33 [18.2%]). A total of 60 (33.1%) patients died due to COVID19 complications. By multivariate analysis, cases with admission due to symptoms
of COVID-19 (p = 0.027) and with two or more metastatic sites (p <0.001) showed
a higher risk of COVID-19-specific death. This is the first study in a cohort of
Brazilian cancer patients with COVID-19. The rates of complications and COVID19-specific death were significantly high. Our data prompts urgent and effective
public policies for this group of especially vulnerable patients.
Statement of Significance
COVID-19-specific mortality in cancer inpatients is markedly higher than in
the general population and the cases with advanced cancer are particularly in a
more vulnerable group. Adaptations of cancer management guidelines and more
intensive preventive measures should be a priority for this group of patients.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19)1, was first detected in Wuhan, the provincial capital of Hubei, China, in
December 2019. SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread to many other countries
worldwide becoming an unprecedented astounding and devastating pandemic in a
short period of time.
Following an exponential upward trend, the increasing number of cases and
death toll remain to concern the scientific community around the globe. Currently,
more than 8.99 million cases are confirmed worldwide, with more than 469,500
deaths2. The first case of COVID-19 in Brazil was detected on February 26, 2020.
Standing out worldwide for having one of the steepest epidemiological curves, the
country has already reached the second place in incidence with almost 1.08 million
cases and second place in mortality with more than 50,500 deaths so far3. As the
most populous areas, the states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro have predictably
concentrated the highest numbers of cases and deaths. Thus far, Brazil has been
considered the new epicenter of the global pandemic4.
In general, the vast majority of COVID-19 patients develop mild symptoms
or remain asymptomatic over the course of the disease. An intermediate group of
patients have moderate symptoms requiring hospitalization and some noninvasive
intervention. A few number of patients have a more severe course of the disease
with desaturation, dyspnea, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction leading
to life-threatening consequences or death5.
Patients with cancer are more likely to have severe complications and even
death when affected by COVID-196–8, mainly due to the effects of the
immunosuppressive anticancer treatments, frequent use of corticosteroids,
advanced age, comorbidities and pulmonary involvement (primary tumors or
secondary lung metastases). Particularly in low- and middle-income countries,
COVID-19 has brought a heavy burdening to the public health systems and
induced new planning and adjustments in the clinical approach to cancer patients9.

Based on a few series previously published around the world, data
evaluating the impact of COVID-19 outbreak in management and survival of
patients with cancer are still very scarce, incomplete, with heterogeneous
outcomes and descriptions10–15. Brazilian data in this specific field are still unknown
due to the lack of publications.
The aim of this report was to describe the demographics, clinical
characteristics and laboratory abnormalities of cancer inpatients with COVID-19
admitted to the hospital ward of the Brazilian National Cancer Institute (INCA),
exploring factors associated with death.
Methods
Study design and participants
This retrospective cohort was performed through a search on electronic
medical records and compiled data of cancer inpatients admitted to INCA with
laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between April 30, 2020 and May 26,
2020. The hospital admission occurred for various medical reasons, including
COVID-19 symptoms or any other clinical condition (for those cases with onset of
symptoms throughout hospitalization or cancer inpatients who had contact to other
COVID-19 cases). Outpatients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and
patients with only non-invasive cancer (or pre-malignant conditions) were not the
object of this study.
COVID-19 was diagnosed on the basis of the WHO interim guidance16, in
which confirmation was defined as a positive result on real-time reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal- and
oropharyngeal swab specimens using the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) reagents and protocol17. Specimens were collected right after
the hospital admission from those patients with COVID-19 symptoms and
immediately after clinical suspicion from those admitted to hospital for diverse
reasons unrelated to COVID-19.
The study was approved by the National Commission of Ethics in Research
(CONEP) and conducted in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice guidelines.

Written informed consent was waived due to the retrospective design and the
emergency feature of the research. Only anonymized data was analyzed.

Data collection and outcomes
The demographic and clinical characteristics, including tumor site,
histological subtype, staging, site of metastases, cancer treatment within the last
60 days, the presence of comorbidities, COVID-19-related clinical signs and
symptoms, and laboratory tests at diagnosis and throughout hospitalization were
obtained from the electronic medical records. COVID-19-specific clinical treatments
were also collected. The variables analyzed in order to feature disease severity
were admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation, renal
failure, hemodialysis, septic shock, and death. Patients transferred out from INCA
to another hospital were censored on the date of transfer. Patients who had not
been discharged from hospital were censored in the date of the last follow-up on
May 31, 2020.

Statistical analysis
The statistical software package SPSS, version 21.0 (São Paulo, Brazil)
was used for the analyses. All continuous variables were evaluated by the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of normality. Categorical variables were shown in
percentages or absolute values. The study endpoint was COVID-19-related
mortality. Time of follow-up was calculated from the date of swab collection to
hospital discharge, death, or censorship of patients who were transferred or still
hospitalized at the end of the study.
Risk factors for death were assessed using logistic regression. Crude and
adjusted odds ratios (OR) were calculated. Variables with a p-value <0.20 at the
univariate analysis were included in the multivariate model by stepwise forward
selection with the entry order based on their level of significance. All p-values
<0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
A total of 181 patients had the diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed at INCA
and were considered eligible for this study (Figure 1). The median follow-up for the
general population was 5 days (interquartile range, IQR 2-10.3).
The clinical and demographic characteristics are described in detail in Table
1. The mean age was 55.3 years (standard deviation, SD ±21.1) and 92 (50.8%)
patients aged 60 or older. Female gender was more prevalent (110 [60.8%]) and
40 patients (22.1%) were former or current smokers. Comorbidities were found in
110 (60.8%) cases, of which the most common were hypertension (77 [42.5%])
and diabetes (31 [17.1%]), and 21 (11.6%) patients had three or more
comorbidities. Long-term use of corticosteroids was seen in 21 (11.6%) cases.
The baseline oncological characteristics of the study patients are displayed
in Table 2. The median time from cancer diagnosis to COVID-19 was 1.5 years
(IQR 0.3-4.1). The most prevalent solid tumors were breast (40 [22.1%]),
gastrointestinal (24 [13.3%]), gynecological (22 [12.2%]) and urological (17 [9.4%]).
Lung cancer patients made up only 7 (3.9%) cases. Among hematological
malignancies, lymphoma (20 [11%]) and leukemia (10 [5.5%]) predominated.
Patients with metastatic disease accounted for almost half of the cases (90
[49.7%]) and 32 (17.7%) patients had lung metastases. More than a third of the
cases (63 [34.8%]) had recently undergone cytotoxic chemotherapy within the last
60 days before the COVID-19 diagnosis, 32 (17.7%) were in best supportive care
and 27 (14.9%), in post-treatment clinical surveillance. Only nine patients (5%)
were receiving targeted therapy or immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors as the
current treatment line.
Information regarding the conditions of hospital admission and clinical
evolution of patients are summarized in Table 3. More than half of the patients (98
[54.1%]) were admitted due to clinical worsening related to COVID-19 and 151
(83.4%) were symptomatic at the time of diagnostic confirmation. The most
frequent symptoms were dyspnea (94 [51.9%]), cough (87 [48.1%]) and fever (66
[36.5%]). Admission to the ICU occurred in 32 (17.7%) cases, 130 (71.8%) patients
required supplemental oxygen, and 35 (19.3%) cases progressed unfavorably with

the need for mechanical ventilation. Ten patients (5.5%) were transferred out from
INCA during the course of COVID-19. Figure 2A shows, from the day of swab
collection, the timeline of events during hospital stay for COVID-19 patients and
highlights that some patients had a rapidly deterioration of their clinical course
once infected with SARS-CoV-2.
The most common complications during hospitalization were respiratory
failure (70 [38.7%]), septic shock (40 [22.1%]) and acute kidney injury (33 [18.2%]),
with 19 (10.5%) patients requiring hemodialysis support. As for laboratory results,
the median absolute lymphocytes count was 988/μL (IQR 588-1488), the mean Creactive protein levels were 19.4 mg/dL (SD ±15.0) and median D-dimer levels
were 2099 ng/mL (IQR 909-5948).
Under the clinical diagnosis of a severe acute respiratory syndrome, where
influenza infection was considered one of the causative hypotheses and before the
final RT-PCR result was confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection, oseltamivir was
administered to 41 (22.7%) cases. During the course of COVID-19, more than half
of the patients (98 [54.1%]) received corticosteroids, 148 (81.8%) were treated with
antibiotics (including those against bacterial coinfections), and therapeutic
anticoagulation was prescribed to 39 (21.5%) patients. Only eight (4.4%) patients
received chloroquine and 36 (19.9%), ivermectin.
At the time of analysis, a total of 60 patients (33.1%) had died due to
COVID-19. For solid tumors, the COVID-19-specific mortality rate was 37.7%
(52/138) and for hematological malignancies (leukemia, lymphoma and multiple
myeloma) was 23.5% (8/34). Four out of seven (57.1%) patients with lung cancer
died from COVID-19, as well 52.5% (21/40) of breast cancer patients (Figure 2B).
As shown in Table 4, mortality related to COVID-19 was significantly
associated to older age (p <0.001 for patients between 60 to 74 years and p =
0.002 for patients aged 75 years or older), metastatic cancer (p <0.001), two or
more sites of metastases (p <0.001), the presence of lung (p <0.001) or bone
metastases (p = 0.001), palliative or best supportive care intent (p <0.001), higher
C-reactive protein levels (p = 0.002), admission due to COVID-19 (p = 0.009), and

antibiotics use (p = 0.02). Isolated or combined comorbidities and elevated D-dimer
levels did not demonstrate increased risk of dying from COVID-19.

(chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy), surgical

with mortality. Also, specific therapies during the COVID-19 course, such as
oseltamivir, therapeutic anticoagulation, corticosteroids, ivermectin and chloroquine
did not influence the risk of death (data not shown).
According to the multivariate analysis patients admitted due to COVID-19
symptoms (p = 0.027) and with two or more metastatic sites (p <0.001) showed a
significantly higher risk of COVID-19-specific death (Table 5).
Discussion
The findings of this cohort highlight, in detail, several significant aspects of
the COVID-19 course in patients already diagnosed with cancer. Although the
emergency period for case selection was considerably short, due to the large
number of cancer patients admitted to INCA with COVID-19, 181 patients were
successfully included for analysis. Women had greater representation, more than
half of the patients aged 60 years or older and almost a quarter of the patients had
also reported smoking. Patients with two or more comorbidities accounted for more
than a quarter of the study population as well, in which hypertension and diabetes
prevailed.
Almost half of the patients (83 [45.9%]) were hospitalized due to conditions
unrelated to the SARS-CoV-2 infection which can be explained by patients
asymptomatic for COVID-19 having been admitted to hospital for other cancerrelated clinical complications. An intra-hospital transmission may also be
considered, raising an important issue about the remarkable risk of infection to
patients admitted for elective procedures. As for the symptoms present at
diagnosis, similarly to data of other series7,8,10,12,14, in the current cohort, dyspnea,
cough and fever were all highly frequent.

The odds of some COVID-related complications were quite similar to the
findings reported by Kuderer et al.14 in an international prospective series in which
more than 928 patients were analyzed. The rate of ICU admission of 14% (versus
17.7% in the current study) and the mechanical ventilation requirement rate of 12%
(versus 19.3% in the current study) were also alike in proportional terms. Zhang et
al.6 also showed paralleled data with respect to other variables such as the
demand of supplemental oxygen in 78.6% of cases (versus 71.8% in the current
study).
Early data from non-cancer patients suggested that 14-19% of cases
progress with severe complications, such as septic shock, respiratory failure, acute
kidney injury and multiple organ failure5,15,18. In the present study, these rates were
much higher, ranging from 18.2 to 38.7%, highlighting the increased likelihood of
severe complications in cancer patients. Conversely, cerebrovascular and
cardiovascular events were less frequent.
In total, 69 (38.1%) of 181 patients died. Herein, COVID-19-related mortality
was considered as the endpoint. Consequently, nine patients who clearly have
recovered from COVID-19, and died due to other cancer-related reasons, were
excluded from this mortality analysis. Therefore, the overall COVID-19-related
mortality rate reached almost one third of the cases (60 [33.1%]), which was higher
than that reported by other series with cancer patients7,8,10,12,14, and far exceeding
the mortality reported for non-cancer patients5. It is important to point out that some
patients had the definition of non-invasive support after or even before the
diagnosis of COVID-19 due to the severity of their advanced malignancies, which
may have overestimated the mortality rate. In addition to this, a noticeable number
of the analyzed patients (103 [56.9%]) were under palliative or best supportive care
at the time, reflecting the advanced stage of their respective diseases.
Unlike in the multicenter studies recently published by Mehta et al.10 and Dai
et al.15, the mortality rate was higher in patients with solid tumors than in patients
with hematological malignancies, possibly due to the small number of
hematological patients in this cohort. But likewise, lung cancer, breast cancer and

gastrointestinal cancer stood for the highest numbers of cases progressing to
death.
In line with the results published by Kuderer et al.14, the characteristics
associated with clinical fragility, such as being elderly, having advanced stage, a
greater number of metastases, pulmonary metastases, palliative or supportive
treatment and symptomatic patients at hospital admission were significantly
associated with a higher risk of death. In this same context, the type of anti-cancer
treatment received by patients within the previous 60 days did not influence
survival outcome.
Except for the association of C-reactive protein with mortality (OR 1.04; p =
0.002), none of the laboratory markers were likely to predict a higher risk of
mortality. Other laboratory exams, including inflammatory markers such as lactate,
ferritin, fibrinogen, and lactate dehydrogenase were not regularly collected in this
cohort, preventing related analyses. A prospective study in order to evaluate the
immune response markers in our cohort of cancer patients with COVID-19 is being
currently conducted.
As in the study performed by Kuderer et al.14, none of the specific therapies
prescribed such as antiviral oseltamivir (used for the initial suspicion of influenza
infection), therapeutic anticoagulation, ivermectin or chloroquine influenced the risk
of death in the current cohort. The strong association between the use of
antibiotics and the outcome of death can be explained by the fact that these
patients showed a more serious condition than COVID-19, including coinfections.
Some important limitations are also worth mentioning in this study. As a
single-center cohort in a country of continental proportions, such as Brazil, a
selection bias may well exist, hindering an external validity. The missing data rate
for some variables was considerably high due to the retrospective design of the
study. There was no paired sample with non-cancer patients with COVID-19 or
cancer patients without COVID-19 to provide a better comparison between the
outcomes of morbidity and mortality. Due to the in-hospital follow-up only, there
was no report of long-term morbidity. Finally, the general population of the study

was very heterogeneous with several types of neoplasia and anti-cancer treatment,
making it difficult to design a more reliable portrait by tumor site.
Lastly, finishing on a positive note, some strengths of the current study can
also be recognized. The Brazilian National Cancer Institute is the most important
national reference center for the treatment of cancer patients through the Brazilian
Public Health System (SUS), with a high admission charge, enabling a quick
inclusion of patients for this study. This was one of the largest series ever
undertaken to explore the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection specifically in cancer
patients. Throughout the analysis, many variables were presented, allowing us to
explore the possibility of their association with risk of death. Ultimately, this is the
first set of Brazilian data in this field, ever.
Conclusively, like other comorbidities, cancer is suggested to be an
important prognostic factor for patients with COVID-19, probably due to the greater
clinical fragility and the negative impact of immunosuppressive treatments. Despite
having formulated early institutional emergency measures, since the onset of the
pandemic in Brazil, to reduce the exposure of this group of patients to SARS-CoV2, INCA struggled with the considerable burden of infected patients in need of
hospitalization. There is an urgent demand for an ostensible national strategy in
order to lower the spread of virus among cancer patients, prioritizing social
isolation, surveillance and mass testing for SARS-CoV-2.
