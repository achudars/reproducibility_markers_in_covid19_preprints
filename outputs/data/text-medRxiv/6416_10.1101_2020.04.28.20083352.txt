Abstract
The Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein is the receptor for different
coronaviruses, including Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), the causative agent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Previous studies
suggested the hypothesis that nicotine could downregulate the expression of the ACE2.
Due to the high level of nicotine intake, the objective of this preliminary study was to
assess, at the ecological level, the correlation between tobacco smoking and the attack
rate and severity of COVID-19 in the European Union (EU). We have found that there is
a statistically significant negative correlation between the age-standardized prevalence of
tobacco smoking and the attack rate of COVID-19 in member states of the EU
[Spearman’s correlation coefficient = -0.476 (95% confidence interval -0.117, -0.725) (pvalue = 0.012)], meaning that in member states with a higher age-standardized prevalence
of tobacco smoking the attack rate of COVID-19 has been so far lower. Further research
is needed to understand the possible effect of nicotine exposure in the expression of the
ACE2 protein.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly discovered
virus, belonging to the family Coronaviridae (Gorbalenya et al., 2020), and causative
agent of the disease Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As of April 14th, around 2
million cases and 120,000 deaths of COVID-19 have been confirmed globally (Johns
Hopkins University & Medicine, 2020). Although the origin of the virus was the city of
Wuhan, China, the center of the pandemic of COVID-19 is currently in Europe, with four
out of the five countries accumulating more deaths worldwide located in this continent
(i.e., Italy, Spain, France and United Kingdom).

The Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein is the receptor for different
coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020). However, evidence is
still sparse on the effect of different exposures on the interaction ACE2 – SARS-CoV-2.
Specifically, there is not conclusive evidence on the regulation of the ACE2 in the lungs
after exposure to nicotine (Oakes et al., 2018)(Brake et al., 2020), one of the thousands
of substances present in the tobacco smoke (Rodgman and Perfetti, 2013), and how this
regulation could impact the outcomes associated with the COVID-19 infection,
eventually. Preliminary epidemiological data indicate that the prevalence of current
smokers in hospitalized patients in China due to COVID-19 was lower than at the national
level (Farsalinos et al., 2020) and that current smokers with COVID-19 seem to be at
higher risk of negative progression than non-smokers (Vardavas and Nikitara, 2020),
although other authors concluded that severity is not associated with active smoking
(Lippi and Henry, 2020).

Assuming the hypothesis that smokers, due to the high level of nicotine intake,
underexpress the ACE2 protein, countries with a higher prevalence of smoking may have
lower attack rates of COVID-19. Hence, the objective of this preliminary study was to
assess the correlation between tobacco smoking and the attack rate and severity of
COVID-19 at the national level in the European Union (EU).

Material and methods
This is an ecological study. The unit of analysis is each of the 27 member states of the
EU. Data on confirmed cases and deaths due to the COVID-19 for each member state of
the EU were retrieved from the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center
(Dong et al., 2020) using metadata accessible from GitHub until April 14th 2020 (Johns
Hopkins University & Medicine, 2020). Age-standardized prevalence of tobacco
smoking at the national level among persons 15 years and older in 2016 were retrieved
from the World Health Statistics on Tobacco control (World Health Organization, 2018).
Population on January 1st 2019 for each of the member states of the EU was retrieved
from Eurostat (Eurostat, 2019).

The attack rate (cumulative cases/100,000 population) and the case fatality ratio (CFR)
(deaths/cumulative cases) were computed for each member state. Due to the nonnormality of data, we computed Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients, and their 95%
confidence intervals (95% CI), of the age-standardized prevalence of tobacco smoking
and the attack rate and of the age-standardized prevalence of tobacco smoking and the
CFR for each of the member states. Univariate linear regression models were computed
to obtain crude regression coefficients (b), and their 95% CI, for both associations.

Scatterplots were designed to graphically depict both associations. P-values were
considered significant when <0.05.

Results
Table 1 contains descriptive data at the national level. The Spearman’s rank correlation
coefficient of the age-standardized prevalence of tobacco smoking and the attack rate was
-0.476 (95% CI -0.117, -0.725) (p-value = 0.012), with b = -7.325 (95% CI -15.028,
0.378) (p-value = 0.061) (Figure 1, panel A). The Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient
between the age-standardized prevalence of tobacco smoking and the CFR was -0.205
(95% CI -0.543, 0.196) (p-value = 0.304), with b = -0.119 (95% CI -0.377, 0.139) (pvalue = 0.351) (Figure 1, panel B).

Discussion
Our preliminary analyses show that there is a statistically significant negative correlation
between the age-standardized prevalence of tobacco smoking and the attack rate of
COVID-19 at the national level in the EU, meaning that in member states with a higher
age-standardized prevalence of tobacco smoking the attack rate of COVID-19 has been
so far lower. These preliminary results would support the hypotheses, at the ecological
level only, that nicotine could downregulate the expression of ACE2 (Oakes et al., 2018).
Importantly, due to the ongoing nature of this recent pandemic and the shortness of
available data, our results should be taken with caution.
We want to highlight that tobacco smoke contains thousands of substances, not only
nicotine, including systemic irritants and toxins, such as hydrocyanic acid, sulfur dioxide,
carbon monoxide, ammonia and formaldehyde, as well as around 70 carcinogenic and
mutagenic substances, such as arsenic, chromium, nitrosamines and benzopyrene

(Rodgman and Perfetti, 2013). In this sense, and as other authors state (Vardavas and
Nikitara, 2020)(Gorini et al., 2020), in the absence of more data, tobacco smoking should
be considered as associated with poorer prognosis of COVID-19.
This study contains some limitations, which should be addressed. Firstly, this is an
ecological study, meaning that conclusions at the individual level should not be drawn.
Also, data are still preliminary due to the outbreak being still ongoing and adjustment for
confounders was not possible (public health measures such as lockdowns, population
density of the member states, etc.). Besides, quality and accuracy of numbers on COVID19 cases and deaths may vary between member states due to differences in capacities in
national surveillance systems and definitions of case and death.

In conclusion, with data available as of April 14th 2020, and at the ecological level, in the
member states of the EU with higher rates of smoking, the attack rate of COVID-19 has
been lower. In this sense, further research is needed to understand the possible effect of
nicotine exposure in the expression of the ACE2 protein, and eventually in the outcomes
of COVID-19.

We would like to thank Prof. Josep Clotet i Erra for sharing with us his research
hypothesis that nicotine could downregulate the expression of ACE2. Without his
research idea, we would not have done this paper.
