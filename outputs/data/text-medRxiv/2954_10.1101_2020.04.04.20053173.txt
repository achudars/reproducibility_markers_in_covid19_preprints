Abstract
Recently the World Health Organization has declared the outbreak of a severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) as a pandemic, and declared it as Public
Health Emergency of International Concern. More than 683,536 positive cases and 32,139
deaths caused by novel corona virus 2019 (COVID-19) has affected 199 countries and
territories. This pandemic can transform into an extremely destructive form if we still do not
take it seriously. In the present study, we propose a generalized SEIR model of COVID-19 to
study the behaviour of its transmission under different control strategies. In the model, all
possible cases of human to human transmission are taken care and its reproduction number is
formulated to analyse accurate transmission dynamics of the coronavirus outbreak. Optimal
control theory is applied in the model to pretend the impact of various intervention strategies,
including voluntary quarantine, isolation of infected individuals, improving an individual’s
immunity and hospitalisation. Also, effect of the control strategies on model is analysed
graphically by simulating the model numerically.
Keywords: COVID-19 outbreak, SEIR-modeling, basic reproduction number, optimal

Introduction

In December, 2019, the pandemic outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease named
COVID-19 raised intense attention not only within China but internationally [11]. Doctors
and scientists tested the previously developed drugs to treat the infected people, but that
failed to succeed. Then, in February, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared
the outbreak of this highly contagious COVID-19 as pandemic globally [13]. To control the
human to human virus transmission, the central government of China as well as all local
governments had tightened preventive measures. However, the virus had spread rapidly
across most of the regions in China and in other countries and territories around the world.
One major cause of the quick spread of COVID-19 is the lack of information and awareness
about the virus during its early stages of infection. As on March 29, 2020, 13:29 GMT, has
affected 199 countries and territories around the world with 683,536 confirmed cases, of
which 32,139 have passed away, and 25,422 are serious or critical (worldometers.info). Still
there is a possibility that spread of this virus could be more intense and cause high mortality.
While the New Year was enjoying their spring vacations, the outbreak of COVID-19 has
accelerated, as most of the people were on their way to hometown or else travelling to
different places for relaxation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 takes at least 2 to 10 days, which makes it is tough to isolate
infected individuals during initial stage of the infection. The major symptoms of COVID-19
include dry coughing, high fever with difficulties in breathing [16]. The virus may spread in
the environment through respiratory droplets of infected individuals when they cough or
sneeze. Further an unaffected population becomes infected when they are exposed by
touching the infected surface or while breathing in an infected environment [10]. During the

initial stages of COVID-19 outbreak, such human transmissions were taking place because,
wide-range of public was unaware of these risk factors, and the infected individuals were also
not isolated and were spreading the virus unknowingly to other individuals. Moreover, the
risk factor of contamination is very high since the virus can remain viable in environment for
several days in favourable conditions [3, 12]. Several studies reveal that old-aged people,
children and those with major diseases are having low immunity and tend to seriously
affected once they become infected [8, 17]. Still, we lack with any proper treatment or
vaccines as a cure for this disease. Hence to control its transmission further, isolating the
infected individuals in special quarantine cells has been implemented in most of the
countries. Despite of these prevention strategies, we are in danger as the transmission is still
ongoing and the mortality due to the virus maintains a high level.
To combat this situation, studies like mathematical modelling play a crucial role to
understand the pandemic behaviour of the infectious disease. Several studies have already
been undertaken to analyse the COVID-19 transmission dynamics. Based on these database
studies of COVID-19 outbreak since 31st December, 2019 to 28th January, 2020, Wu et. al.
(2020) introduced a SEIR-model to estimate the spread of the disease nationally as well as
globally [18]. Tang et. al. (2020) proposed a compartmental model by dividing each group
into two subpopulations, the quarantined and unquarantined. Moreover, they re-designed
their previous model by using diagnose and time-dependent contact rates, and re-estimated
the reproduction ratio to quantify the evolution in better way [14, 15]. Peng et. al. (2020)
planned a generalized SEIR model that suitably incorporates the intrinsic impact of hidden
exposed and infectious cases of COVID-19 [9]. Chen et. al. (2020) presented the incubation
period behaviour of local outbreak of COVID-19 by constructing a dynamic system [2]. Khan
& Atangana (2020) described brief details of interaction among the bats, unknown hosts,
humans and the infections reservoir by formulating the mathematical results of the
mathematical fractional model [7]. Chen et. al. (2020) have also developed a Bats-HostsReservoir-People transmission network model for simulating the potential transmission of
COVID-19 [1]. Zhao et. al. (2020) divided susceptible people from Wuhan City into different
age groups and developed a SEIARW-model based on market to person and person to person
transmission routes [20]. Zhong et. al. (2020) constructed a mathematical model using
epidemiological data and examined characteristics of the historical epidemic to make an early
prediction of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in China [21]. Yang & Wang (2020) have studied the
multiple transmission pathways in the infection dynamics and formed a mathematical model
that describes the role of the environmental reservoir in the transmission and spread of
COVID-19 [19].
In this work, a COVID-19 model is constructed to study human to human
transmission of the virus in section 2. Optimal control theory is introduced and applied to the
model to develop in section 3 and in section 4, the model is simulated numerically to observe
effect of control strategies on the model.

COVID-19 Model Formulation

To analyse the human to human transmission dynamics of COVID-2019, a
compartmental model is constructed. The model consists all possible human to human
transmission of the virus. The COVID-2019 is highly contagious in nature and infected cases
are seen in most of the countries around the world, hence in the model the susceptible
population class is ignored and whole population is divided in five compartments, class of
exposed individuals E (t) (individuals surrounded by infection by not yet infected), class of
infected individuals by COVID-19 I(t) , class of critically infected individuals by COVID-19
C (t) , class of hospitalised individuals H (t) and class of dead individuals due to COVID-19

Optimal Control Theory

Control measures have made significant role to control the epidemic of COVID-19 at certain
level. In this control theory, five control variables are used as five possible control strategies.
Since the virus is highly contagious, it quickly infect any people come in contact with an
infected individual. To avoid this situation we have taken u1 control variable to selfquarantine exposed individuals and u2 control variable as an isolation of infected individuals.
Moreover, to minimise mortality rate of COVID-19, u3 control variable is taken which helps
to reduce critically infected cases by taking extra medical care of infected individuals. u 4 and
u5 control variables are taken to improve hospitalisation facility for infected and critically
infected individuals respectively. Purpose of this study of control theory is to protect people
from the outbreak by applying control or treatment in each stage. Objective function for the
required scenario is,
T

J ( ci , Ω ) = ∫ ( A1 E 2 + A2 I 2 + A3C 2 + A4 H 2 + A5 D 2 + w1u12 + w2u22 + w3u32 + w4 u42 + w5u52 ) dt
0

where, Ω denotes the feasible region for the set of compartmental variables, A1 , A2 , A3 , A4 , A5
denote non-negative weight constants for compartments

E, I , C, H , D respectively.

w1 , w2 , w3 , w4 and w5 are the weight constants for each control ui , where i = 1, 2,...,5
respectively. The modified model is,

As the weight parameter wi , i = 1, 2,...,5 are constants applied on the control variable
respectively from which the optimal condition is normalized. Now, calculate every values of
control variables from t = 0 to t = T such that,
J (ui (t )) = min{ J (ui * , Ω) / (ui ) ∈ φ}, i = 1, 2,...,5
where, φ is a smooth function on the interval [0,1] . The optimal effect is found by using
results of Fleming and Rishel (2012) [6]. Associated Langrangian function with adjoint
variable λ1 , λ2 , λ3 , λ4 , λ5 is given by,

L ( Ω, A ) = A1 E 2 + A2 I 2 + A3C 2 + A4 H 2 + A5 D 2 + w1u12 + w2u22 + w3u32 + w4u42 + w5u52

+ λ5 ( β5C + β 6 I − β 7 DE )

The partial derivatives of the Lagrangian function with respect to each variable of the
compartment gives the adjoint equation variables Ai = (λ1 , λ2 , λ3 , λ4 , λ5 ) corresponding to the
system which are:

Figure 3 variation in all compartments
Figure 3 represents the variations in all the compartments of COVID-19 model with respect
to time. Also, the pandemic behaviour of the COVID-19 outbreak can be clearly seen here.
We can say that, a large population of exposed individuals become infected before a week.
Moreover, the critically infected cases and hospitalisation cases also increase with matter of
time. Further, it clearly shows that after one week the mortality rate is also increased.

Figure 4 Variation in compartments with and without optimal controls
Figure 4 (a) shows variation in each compartment under influence with and without control
variables. It is observed that COVID-19 outbreak can be controlled up to a certain level in
seven weeks after applying control strategies. While, figures 4 (b) and (c) represent number
of infected and critically infected individuals decreasing; which is further leading to a
decrease in hospitalised class as shown in figure 4 (d). Thus, reduction in mortality rate under
the effect of control strategies can be clearly observed in figure 4 (e).

Figure 5 Variation in control variable with time
Variation in intensity of control strategies with time is shown in figure 5. Moreover, the
figure also demonstrates which control can be applied at how much intensity to control
COVID-19 outbreak in seven weeks. The high fluctuation in u3 control variable at an initial
stage suggests that it is very important to control infected individuals to move at critical stage
to reduce mortality due to COVID-19. And, this can be achieved easily if an infected
individual gets proper vaccination for this disease. Since effective vaccination is not available
for coronavirus, one should take proper care of infected individuals to improve their
immunity so that their body becomes capable to fight against the virus and not reaching to a

infected individuals is an effective step to reduce infected cases of COVID-19. Figure 6(c)
suggests that to reduce critical cases of COVID-19, first we should make control on infected
individuals to become critically infected and we should improve hospitalisation and medical
facility for critically infected individuals to save their lives. Figure 6(e) shows that mortality
rate due to COVID-19 can be reduced effectively within three weeks of outbreak by applying
u1 , u 2 and u3 control strategies. That means self-quarantine for an exposed individual,
isolation of an infected individual and reducing critical cases by taking extra care of infected
individuals are effective strategies to control further transmission of COVID-19.

effect of all the controls gives fruitful effect on the model.

mortality ratio in class of infected individuals is higher and much quicker than in the class of
exposed individuals. The chaotic figure 8(c) represents a very high mortality rate of critically
infected individuals. Hence, in the absence of vaccination for COVID-19, it becomes a
challenging situation to cure critically infected individuals.

Conclusion

In this study, a compartmental model is constructed to examine transmission of COVID-19 in
human population class. Moreover, basic reproduction number is formulated to calculate
threshold value of the disease. In order to develop strategies to prevent the epidemic of
COVID-19, optimal control theory is applied to the model. Further to advance control theory,
five control variables are introduced in the model in the form of control strategies. These
strategies include self-quarantine of exposed individuals, isolation of infected individuals,
taking extra care of infected individuals to reduce critical case of COVID-19, increase
hospitalisation facility for infected and critically infected individuals. Distinctive and
combined effects of these control variables on all the compartments are observed and
examined graphically by simulating the COVID-19 model. Numerical simulation of the
model reflects that quarantine and better medical treatment of infected individuals reduce the
critically infected cases, which will further reduce the transmission risk and demises.
