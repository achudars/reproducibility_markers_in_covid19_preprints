Abstract Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are used extensively in malaria and
rheumatological conditions, and now in COVID-19 prevention and treatment. Although generally
safe they are potentially lethal in overdose. In-vitro data suggest that high concentrations and
thus high doses are needed for COVID-19 infections, but as yet there is no convincing evidence
they are clinically effective. Bayesian regression models were Ô¨Åtted to survival outcomes and
electrocardiograph QRS durations from 302 prospectively studied French patients who had taken
intentional chloroquine overdoses, of whom 33 died (11%), and 16 healthy volunteers who took
620 mg base chloroquine single doses. Whole blood concentrations of 13.5 ùúámol/L (95% credible
interval 10.1-17.7) were associated with 1% mortality. Prolongation of ventricular depolarisation
is concentration-dependent with a QRS duration >150 msec independently highly predictive of
mortality. Pharmacokinetic modelling combined with these lethality data predicts that the
majority of chloroquine regimens trialled in COVID-19 should not cause serious cardiovascular
toxicity.

Introduction
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are closely related 4-aminoquinoline drugs used for the treatment of malaria, amoebiasis and rheumatological conditions (World Health Organization, 2015).
Until the late 1990s chloroquine was the drug of choice for the treatment of malaria. Hundreds
of tonnes corresponding to over 200 million doses were consumed annually. Since then its use
has declined because of widespread resistance in Plasmodium falciparum. Today there is greater
use of hydroxychloroquine in rheumatoid arthritis and discoid and systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE). Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are both weak antivirals with a broad range of activities (including Ô¨Çaviviruses, retroviruses, and coronaviruses) (Savarino et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2020;
Wang et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020; M√©garbane and Scherrmann, 2020). As of the 11th June 2020,
77 interventional clinical trials for evaluating these drugs in both the prevention and treatment of
COVID-19 were registered and recruiting participants on ClinicalTrials.gov. The relatively weak antiviral activity against SARS-CoV2 in vero cell cultures has motivated trialling of higher loading and
maintenance doses than usually given in malaria or hepatic amoebiasis (World Health Organization, 2015). This has caused concern over the potential for cardiovascular toxicity. Nevertheless,
despite the lack of any convincing evidence of clinical beneÔ¨Åt, these drugs are now being used

extensively in COVID-19 prevention and treatment across the world. Sadly, patients who need hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for the treatment of malaria and rheumatological conditions are
often having diÔ¨Éculty obtaining them (Straits Times, 2020).
Borba et al. reported results from a randomised trial in Brazil of two dose regimens of chloroquine in COVID-19 treatment (CloroCovid-19 study, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04323527) (Borba et al.,
2020). The trial was stopped early after recruiting only 81 patients because of cardiac toxicity and
greater mortality in the higher dose group; two of 41 patients given the higher dose regimen developed ventricular tachycardia before death and 7 of 37 patients in this group developed electrocardiograph QTcF intervals over 500 msec compared with 4 of 36 in the lower dose group. The
higher dose regimen, comprising 600 mg base chloroquine administered twice daily for ten days,
is substantially higher than recommended in malaria or rheumatological conditions (World Health
Organization, 2015) and represents the standard malaria loading dose repeated 19 times at 12
hour intervals.
Chloroquine is dangerous in overdose and has been used extensively for suicide. High concentrations of chloroquine cause hypotension, arrhythmias, coma, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and fatal cardiac arrest (Riou et al., 1988; Clemessy et al., 1995, 1996; M√©garbane
et al., 2010). In Zimbabwe the mortality of chloroquine in overdose was approximately six times
higher than for other drugs (Ball et al., 2002). In France in the early 1980s there was a suicide
epidemic (Riou et al., 1988; Clemessy et al., 1995, 1996; M√©garbane et al., 2010) following the publication of a book entitled Suicide: mode d‚Äôemploi (Suicide: a how-to guide) (Guillon and Le Bonniec,
1982). This unfortunate experience allowed characterisation of the factors associated with death
from chloroquine overdose. Outcome in chloroquine self-poisoning depends on the dose ingested,
the delay in reaching hospital and the quality of intensive care support. Using the blood concentration measurements taken from self-poisoning patients managed by experienced intensivists in
the French National referral centre allowed development of a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic
model to estimate the relationship between chloroquine dosing and a fatal outcome. A pooled analysis using electrocardiograph QRS interval data from healthy volunteers (Pukrittayakamee et al.,
2014) and from the French self-poisoning cohorts helped characterise the contribution of QRS prolongation to the recorded QT prolongation. These models were used to estimate the safety of
the main treatment regimens currently used in COVID-19 clinical trials and to a standard malaria
treatment regimen for comparison.

Predicting mortality in self-poisoning from peak chloroquine concentrations
We pooled individual patient whole blood chloroquine + desethylchloroquine concentrations and
outcomes from three large prospectively studied hospital self-poisoning cohorts (n=302, Figure 1,
top panel) (Riou et al., 1988; Clemessy et al., 1995, 1996; M√©garbane et al., 2010). All the patients
included in this analysis were treated in the same hospital in Paris and all had whole blood concentrations measured on admission. The overall mortality was 11% (33 of 302). Of the patients with
multiple concentration measurements (ùëõ = 173), 61 (35%) reached their peak whole blood chloroquine concentrations after admission. The distribution of differences on the log scale between
admission concentrations and peak concentrations in patients who peaked after hospital admission was used to estimate a correction term for all other patients. Bayesian logistic regression was
used to estimate the relationship between mortality and inferred whole blood peak chloroquine
concentrations (Figure 1, bottom panel) speciÔ¨Åcally adjusted for the desethyl metabolite levels and
for the non-observed peak concentrations in 241 (80%) of the patients. The model also adjusted for
differences in treatment received between cohorts. The whole blood chloroquine concentration
associated with 1% mortality was 13.5 ùúámol/L (95% C.I. 10.1 to 17.7). This is the lowest mortality for
which a reliable estimate can be derived from these data. This threshold value was then used to
evaluate the risk of fatal toxicity in chloroquine treatment regimens under evaluation in COVID-19.

Predicting mortality from peak concentrations in COVID-19 treatment regimens

134

We used two pharmacokinetic models to predict peak chloroquine concentrations for six chloroquine regimens. Five of the simulated regimens are potential COVID treatment regimens, and one
is the standard malaria treatment regimen. A very wide range of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine regimens are currently in use for the treatment of COVID-19 (Appendix 5). The COVID-19
regimens we simulated correspond to the highest chloroquine treatment regimen (in terms of total dose) registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Borba et al., 2020); the regimen given in the World Health
Organisation SOLIDARITY trial (NCT04330690); a lower 7 day adaptation of the SOLIDARITY regimen; and weight-optimised equivalent regimens.
The pharmacokinetic model estimated from whole blood concentrations (H√∂glund et al., 2016)
predicted a slightly wider range of values for maximum chloroquine concentrations (Cmax ) than the
plasma based model (Appendix 3 shows the predicted Cmax distributions for both models in a 70 kg
adult). Assuming a whole blood to plasma concentration ratio of 4, the whole blood based model
and the plasma based model predicted approximately identical median Cmax values. Thus, the
whole blood pharmacokinetic model provides higher estimates for fatal toxicity because it predicts
a larger variance for the Cmax distribution and hence more extreme outliers. As a sensitivity analysis,
the equivalent outputs for the plasma based model are shown in Appendix 4.
Based on the whole blood model, the median Cmax following a chloroquine dose of 600 mg base
equivalent given twice daily for ten days to a 70 kg adult is 10.7 ùúámol/L (Figure 2, panel A). This is
more than 3 times higher than the median Cmax for the chloroquine malaria treatment regimen at
the same body weight. Approximately 60% of 70 kg adults continuing to receive the twice daily
600 mg dose enter the ‚Äòdanger zone‚Äô deÔ¨Åned as whole blood concentrations above 10 ùúámol/L. In
comparison, only 2 in 1000 70 kg adults receiving the twice daily 310 mg maintenance dose (as
given in the SOLIDARITY trial) for ten days would reach concentrations above 10 ùúámol/L. Taking
into account the uncertainty around this threshold value, the model estimates that fewer than 1
per thousand receiving the twice daily 310 mg dose would have peak concentrations above the 1%
mortality threshold (Figure 2, panel B). At most, 2 in a thousand 40 kg adults receiving the 3 day
malaria treatment regimen (an unusually high mg/kg dose for malaria treatment) are predicted to
reach peak concentrations above 10 ùúámol/L.
Coupling the pharmacokinetic model with the pharmacodynamic model, we estimated the expected weight-dependent fatality ratios for the Ô¨Åve COVID-19 chloroquine treatment regimens,
truncating the concentration-fatality curve at the 1% mortality threshold (only taking into account
concentrations going above this threshold). Administering 600 mg base equivalent of chloroquine
phosphate twice daily for ten days as in the CloroCovid-19 trial is predicted to result in absolute
mean fatality ratios ranging between 0.05% (90 kg, 95% credible interval (C.I.), 0 to 0.3%) and 3.5%
(40 kg, 95% C.I. 1.0 to 8.0%), Figure 2, panel C. In comparison, only the Ô¨Çat dosing regimens are
predicted to result in fatality ratios greater than 1 per thousand and then only for weights less
than 55 kg: for a 40 kg adult the 10 day SOLIDARITY regimen could result in 0.2 per thousand mortality (95% CI, 0 to 0.8). The 10 day Ô¨Çat regimen (without a loading dose) was recommended by
the Health Commission of Guangdong Province for adults weighing more than 50 kg (Multicenter
collaboration group of Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province and Health
Commission of Guangdong Province for chloroquine in the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia., 2020). The model predictions suggest that reduced doses should be given at the lower end
of the adult weight spectrum.

hierarchical Bayesian Emax sigmoid regression model to the paired concentration-QRS data and
the steady state QRS data (healthy volunteers only), a total of ùëõ = 514 datapoints. A whole blood
chloroquine concentration of 3 ùúámol/L (usually observed in malaria treatment) is associated with
a slight QRS prolongation of 6.7 msec (95% credible interval, 5.5 - 7.8). Clinically signiÔ¨Åcant intraventricular conduction delay (QRS prolongation), resulting in durations greater than 150 msec, was
strongly associated with observed chloroquine concentrations above 10 ùúámol/L. In self-poisoning,
1 out of 108 patients with admission whole blood concentrations less than 10 ùúámol/L had a QRS
interval longer than 150 msec (this accounts for the bias term estimated in the Clemessy cohort).
In comparison, QRS durations longer than 150 msec were recorded in 36 out of 182 (20%) of the
patients with whole blood concentrations greater than 10 ùúámol/L. In self-poisoning patients, QRS
duration was an independent predictor of death (adjusted odds ratio for death of 1.3 for each 10
msec increase in QRS, ùëù < 10‚àí5 ).

Chloroquine is dangerous in overdose. The risk of death is proportional to drug exposure. Mortality rises steeply at whole blood chloroquine concentrations above 10 ùúámol/L. This corresponds
very approximately to a plasma concentration of 3 ùúámol/L, and a combined chloroquine and desethylchloroquine concentration (as in a spectrophotometric assay) of 14 ùúámol/L. Importantly the
electrocardiograph is a valuable indicator of toxicity as potentially lethal levels are associated with
signiÔ¨Åcant QRS complex widening. A QRS duration of less than 100 msec makes lethal toxicity very
unlikely. When using high-dose treatments weight adjusted dosing is important to avoid toxicity.

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are already being used extensively, and often in high doses,
to prevent and treat COVID-19 despite the current lack of convincing evidence of beneÔ¨Åt. Use of
these drugs has become extremely politicised. The Ô¨Årst large randomised trial in the treatment of
hospitalised patients has just reported (RECOVERY, NCT04381936: press release only at the time of
writing, results are not yet peer reviewed). The prevention trials will take longer to report. Confusion over the risks associated with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine has been compounded by
a recent high proÔ¨Åle claim of increased mortality and high rates of ventricular arrhythmia in a very
large observational data set that was almost certainly fabricated (and the paper subsequently retracted), and by misunderstanding of their clinical pharmacology. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have unusual pharmacokinetic properties with enormous total apparent volumes of distribution (Vùëë ) (chloroquine > hydroxychloroquine) and very slow elimination (terminal half-lives exceed
one month). Thus, distribution processes, rather than elimination, govern the blood concentration
proÔ¨Åles in the Ô¨Årst days following the start of treatment. Large single doses (as in self-poisoning) are
very dangerous because they result in high blood concentrations as the drugs distribute out from a
central ‚Äúcompartment‚Äù that is hundreds of times smaller than the total apparent Vùëë (compartmental modelling of chloroquine pharmacokinetics provides only an approximation of the distribution
processes). These high concentrations can cause potentially lethal cardiovascular and nervous
system toxicity. Chloroquine affects cardiac muscle depolarisation, repolarisation and contractility
and also causes vasodilatation. There is concentration dependent electrocardiograph QRS widening and JT prolongation (Clemessy et al., 1995, 1996) which both contribute to QT prolongation.
Death usually results from refractory hypotension or ventricular Ô¨Åbrillation. Self-poisoning with
chloroquine has provided an unfortunate opportunity to correlate drug exposure with the risk of
iatrogenic death.
As chloroquine has weak antiviral activity, if there is beneÔ¨Åt in COVID-19 infections, it is likely
to require high drug exposures. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic a large number of investigators started studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The toxicity thresholds were
not well deÔ¨Åned and a range of dose regimens were evaluated, some of which have been very
high (Appendix, Figure 5). The high dose chloroquine regimen evaluated by Borba et al. which did

The data shown in the scatter plot are from 16 healthy volunteers who took a single 620 mg base oral dose
(green circles, 192 paired concentration-QRS data-points, plasma concentrations were multiplied by 4) and
290 chloroquine self-poisoning patients (red and blue, hospital admission concentrations). Random normal
jitter (standard deviation of 1 msec) was added to the Clemessy cohort self-poisoning QRS values for
improved visualisation. Survivors are shown as circles and fatal cases as triangles. The self-poisoning QRS
values from the Clemessy series (Clemessy et al., 1995, 1996) were manually read and are adjusted for a bias
term (see Methods, non-adjusted data are shown in Appendix 6). The grey line (grey area) shows the
estimated median QRS duration (range) in the 16 healthy volunteers in absence of measurable drug. The
thick black line shows the mean posterior Emax sigmoid regression model, Ô¨Åtted to the pooled data. The
dashed green and blue lines show the posterior predictive distribution under the error distributions for the
healthy volunteers and Megarbane self-poisoning cohort (smaller measurement error than in the Clemessy
cohort), respectively (see Methods for the full speciÔ¨Åcation of the model). Note that the Emax regression
model does not account for concentration-dependent heteroskedasticity but only inter-individual variation
for healthy volunteers and inter-study variation (differences in measurement).

encounter cardiac toxicity referenced the recommendations by the Health Commission of Guangdong Province, but there may have been confusion between salt and base weights (Multicenter
collaboration group of Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province and Health
Commission of Guangdong Province for chloroquine in the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia., 2020). The Chinese authorities recommended 500 mg salt twice daily (two tablets of 250
mg, comprising 155 mg base each) whereas the Brazil study (Borba et al., 2020) gave doses in
base equivalent (which were consequently much higher) . Importantly the patients in the Brazilian study also received azithromycin (which also prolongs the QT interval, and this may well have
contributed to ventricular arrhythmias Saleh et al., 2020; Lane et al., 2020). Nevertheless this pharmacometric analysis of the self-poisoning cohorts provides an evidence-based toxicity threshold
and it does suggest that a continued regimen of 600mg twice daily can be directly lethal. Lower
dose regimens such as those evaluated in the large RECOVERY and SOLIDARITY trials, and the original Guangdong study, are predicted to be safe. Doses of chloroquine alone, resulting in peak
concentrations greater than 10 ùúámol/L are associated with more than 1% risk of fatal toxicity.

Limitations
There are several limitations to this study. It is a retrospective individual patient data analysis.
In the suicide attempts, other drugs or alcohol were often taken as well, although none with the
acute lethal toxicity of chloroquine. Patients were managed by experienced intensivists on intensive care units where there was close clinical and laboratory monitoring. Mortality might be higher
in less well supported settings, or in overloaded hospitals in high-income settings. The age range
in self-poisoning is also younger than in the majority of more seriously ill COVID-19 patients. The
spectrophotometric assay method does not separate chloroquine from its desethylated metabolite, and is relatively insensitive. Desethychloroquine has generally similar biological properties,
and the assay performs well at the high concentrations of relevance to this study. We corrected
for the presence of the metabolite under the Bayesian model, but this correction increases uncertainty around the threshold concentration associated with 1% mortality. The predictions of absolute mortality under the regimens simulated in this work are sensitive to the parameterization of
the pharmacokinetic model. Cmax is not observed directly but is an output model-based quantity
estimated from data. There are no large population pharmacokinetic studies to verify the precision
of the Cmax predictions, especially for the critical upper tails of the distribution.
The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model developed here was based on the largest prospective series of chloroquine self-poisonings studied in a single referral centre. However, it was not
possible to apply a standard pharmacokinetic model to the observed data in order to estimate the
individual ùê∂max values. Mainly because of vomiting, admission blood concentrations only weakly
correlate with the self-administered chloroquine doses (Clemessy et al., 1995). Our model was
based on a majority of admission whole blood concentrations. The data from patients whose peak
drug concentrations occurred after hospital admission were used to approximate the difference
between unobserved peak concentrations and admission concentrations in the remaining patients.
Overall, the admission concentrations were estimated to be approximately 5% lower on average
than the peak concentrations. This corresponds to prior expectations: the mean interval to hospitalisation for this large self-poisoning cohort was 4.5 hours compared with an average time to
peak concentration after oral administration of 3 hours (range 1-6 hours) (Pukrittayakamee et al.,
2014). The outcome of chloroquine poisoning depends on the quality of intensive care support.
Over the period of this retrospective review, in addition to the experience gained in this one referral centre, there were signiÔ¨Åcant improvements in intensive care which would have improved
the prognosis for a given drug exposure. Sustaining the cardiorespiratory system mechanically
with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (M√©garbane et al., 2007) while toxic concentrations
decline as the drug distributes may have made a signiÔ¨Åcant contribution to improved survival.
Our analysis does not make speciÔ¨Åc predictions for the toxicity of hydroxychloroquine regimens
currently in use for the treatment of COVID-19. The majority of clinical trials are evaluating hydrox-

ychloroquine, not chloroquine, as it is considered to be slightly safer and is more widely available
in the countries where most trials are being conducted. Although hydroxychloroquine has a wider
therapeutic margin in experimental animals (McChesney, 1983), it has generally similar pharmacokinetic properties and, although there are limited data, the pharmacodynamic properties are
also generally similar to chloroquine. The clinical features of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine
in overdose are also similar. But unlike chloroquine, there are no large cohorts of hydroxychloroquine self-poisoning on which to deÔ¨Åne toxicity thresholds. Thus, given available toxicity data, it
is very unlikely that equivalent hydroxychloroquine concentrations to chloroquine are more dangerous, but rather that the safety margins are wider. Our systematic review of regimens currently
being used for the treatment of COVID identiÔ¨Åes one trial currently recruiting patients (PATCH,
NCT04329923) which is administering very high doses of hydroxychloroquine (Appendix 5). This
dose of 1200mg/day (930 mg base/day) for 14 days would be predicted to have a signiÔ¨Åcant risk of
incurring dangerous toxicity were hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to have molar equivalent
toxicities. However the majority of regimens currently being tested for COVID-19 treatment are
predicted to be safe.

Concerns over QT prolongation dominate the reasons for not endorsing or not participating in
COVID 19 trials with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Many recent articles on COVID-19 therapeutics caution against the risks of iatrogenic ‚Äútorsade de pointes‚Äù (TdP) with these drugs (Pastick et al., 2020; Monzani et al., 2020; Chary et al., 2020; Guzik et al., 2020; Guastalegname and
Vallone, 2020; van den Broek et al., 2020; Jeevaratnam, 2020; Sapp et al., 2020). Both drugs do
cause signiÔ¨Åcant QT prolongation and, whilst they block several different cation channels affecting myocardial depolarization (resulting in QRS prolongation) and repolarization (resulting in JT
prolongation), the multichannel block is considered unbalanced, and both drugs are regarded as
‚Äútorsadagenic‚Äù (Vicente et al., 2018). Many of the recent reports rediscovering this well known
effect omit description of the contribution of QRS widening to QT prolongation (and thereby overestimate JT prolongation). Approximately 350 tonnes of hydroxychloroquine are manufactured
each year, almost all of which is used for rheumatological conditions, so millions are receiving long
term regimens. Many of these have systemic lupus erythematosus which is commonly associated
with myocarditis, QT prolongation, and a high prevalence of arrhythmias (Gawa≈Çko et al., 2020;
Bourr√©-Tessier et al., 2015). Reviews and authoritative websites all state that hydroxychloroquine
causes TdP. Yet despite this enormous use in a systematic review of the literature we can Ô¨Ånd only
a single reported case of TdP outside of COVID-19 treatment. This was in a 67 year old Taiwanese
female with systemic lupus erythematosus, cirrhosis and a previous myocardial infarct who was
receiving hydroxychloroquine (Chen et al., 2006). The patient survived. The WHO pharmacovigilance database (VigiBase) contains reports of 83 episodes of ventricular tachycardia associated with
hydroxychloroquine over a 52 year period of which 7 were fatal (this does not distinguish acute toxicity from the well described chronic toxic cardiomyopathy associated with use over many years).
Overall, in systemic lupus erythematosus, patients receiving chloroquine have fewer arrhythmias
than those on other medicines (Alkmim Teixeira et al., 2014; Wozniacka et al., 2006). In a very
large retrospective observational study of 956,374 patients with rheumatoid arthritis starting hydroxychloroquine, there were signiÔ¨Åcantly less arrhythmias in the Ô¨Årst month of treatment with hydroxychloroquine compared to patients (N=310,350) started on sulphasalazine (Lane et al., 2020).
This reÔ¨Çects the under-recognised anti-arrhythmic effects of these drugs (Harris et al., 1988). In
COVID-19 treatment there have been two reports so far of TdP. An 84 year old Israeli woman with
metastatic breast cancer who was taking bisoprolol, letrozole and memantine and received chloroquine treatment (Szekely et al., 2020), and a 68-year-old American male given hydroxychloroquine
and azithromycin (Chorin et al., 2020). Neither of these episodes were fatal. In Europe and the
USA, where chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are allowed for compassionate use, there have
been more than 250,000 deaths from COVID-19. The apparently low rates of reported ventricular

arrhythmia are surprising given that evidence of myocarditis in lethal COVID-19 is common (Kang
et al., 2020; Long et al., 2020). Except in deliberate self-poisoning TdP has not been reported with
chloroquine either, despite billions of malaria treatments and extensive use in rheumatological
conditions and hepatic amoebiasis for over 70 years. Thus it appears that the individual risk over
the short term with currently used doses is very low. Subjects with pre-existing long QT intervals,
electrolyte imbalance, concomitant QT prolonging medications (notably azithromycin in COVID19) and structural heart disease are likely to be at greater individual risk. The very low risks of
drug induced arrhythmia over the short term should be distinguished from long term cumulative
cardiotoxicity. The main cardiac concerns with long term usage of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are conduction defects and cardiomyopathy (T√∂nnesmann et al., 2013).
In summary, despite causing signiÔ¨Åcant QT prolongation, there is no evidence that the risks
of TdP and sudden death with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine at currently recommended
doses over the short term are increased above those of the background population. Restricting
the evaluation of these drugs in COVID-19 for this speciÔ¨Åc concern therefore seems unwarranted.
In assessing the potential toxicity of these drugs QRS widening correlates with severity.

COVID-19 ranges from very mild illness to severe disease necessitating intensive care. Case fatality
ratios are highly age dependent (Wu et al., 2020). The potential toxicity of a treatment regimen
has to be balanced against the severity of illness. If chloroquine is to beneÔ¨Åt patients with COVID19 it is likely to require high exposures. Understanding the concentration-dependent toxicity of
chloroquine is essential in assessing the risk-beneÔ¨Åt trade-off in COVID-19 clinical trials. This is
evidence based whereas the presumption of risk from lethal TdP derived from the measurement
of electrocardiograph QT prolongation (which dominates the current literature) is not. From a
clinical perspective there are several practical implications of these observations in self-poisoning.
If high doses of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are being given to hospitalised patients and
blood concentrations cannot be measured rapidly (which is the usual situation) then electrocardiographic monitoring is informative. QRS interval widening can be used as an indicator of toxicity.
If the QRS interval is less than 100 msec then serious cardiovascular toxicity is very unlikely. JT
interval prolongation is expected, but it is often harder to assess (as the end of T wave deÔ¨Ånition is
often unclear). Hypokalaemia is an important manifestation of chloroquine poisoning and a contributor to tachyarrhythmias (Clemessy et al., 1995). With high dose regimens plasma potassium
concentrations should be maintained over 4.0 mmol/L and plasma magnesium concentrations
over 0.8 mmol/L. Overall treatment regimens for hospitalised COVID-19 patients which result in
whole blood chloroquine concentrations below 10 ùúámol/L for more than 95% of patients have an
acceptable safety margin.

Patient data
The largest prospectively studied cohorts of self-poisoning with chloroquine have all been assembled by the national clinical toxicology unit in Paris, France (R√©animation M√©dicale et Toxicologique,
H√¥pital Lariboisi√®re). The clinical and laboratory characteristics of these cohorts have been published in detail previously (Riou et al., 1988; Clemessy et al., 1995, 1996; M√©garbane et al., 2010).
The extensive experience gathered in this clinical toxicology unit established the standard of care
for chloroquine poisoning, including mechanical ventilation, appropriate sedation and optimum
use of inotropes and vasopressors. Pre-hospital care was provided by emergency physicians in
mobile intensive care units. These units could perform 12-lead electrocardiograms as well as advanced life support. Whole blood chloroquine concentrations were measured on admission and at
varying times subsequently. The whole blood chloroquine concentrations following self-poisoning
were determined using ultraviolet spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 343 nm. This analytical

method does not differentiate between chloroquine and the biologically active desethyl metabolite.
Original drug concentration measurements, electrocardiograph QRS durations and outcome
data were available for all prospectively studied patients from 1987 to 1994 (Clemessy et al., 1995,
1996) and a later cohort studied from 2003 to 2007 (M√©garbane et al., 2010). Patients were included in the prospective studies if there was a history of attempted suicide and chloroquine was
present in the admission whole blood sample. For all patients studied prospectively between
February 1987 and January 1992 (ùëõ = 167 Clemessy et al., 1996) multiple whole blood chloroquine measurements were taken during the Ô¨Årst 48 hours of hospital stay. The number and timing of samples varied between cases. Original data were not available for Riou et al. (1988) so
concentrations and outcomes were extracted from graphs in the publication (Figure 3 in Riou
et al., 1988). Whole blood chloroquine concentrations and outcome could be determined approximately for all 102 patients. Data were extracted using the web version of WebPlotDigitizer
(https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/).
Electrocardiograph QRS durations were manually read for all patients in Clemessy et al. (1995,
1996). Automated and manual readings were used for patients in M√©garbane et al. (2010). We
did not have reliable QT interval measurements for the chloroquine self-poisoning patients. It is
often impossible to determine accurately the end of the T wave in the presence of the extremely
high chloroquine concentrations observed in self-poisoning (in the 10-100 ùúámol/L range). Several
case reports of massive chloroquine overdose show illustrative electrocardiograms in which the
QT interval is diÔ¨Écult or impossible to measure accurately, e.g. Gunja et al. (2009); de Olano et al.
(2019). An ECG typical of chloroquine self-poisoning, with substantial QRS widening and moderate
JT prolongation, is shown in Appendix 7.
To characterise the relationship between chloroquine concentrations and QRS prolongation,
we used plasma chloroquine concentration measurements (from solid phase extraction and high
performance liquid chromatography with UV detection) and electrocardiograph QRS interval measurements from 16 healthy volunteers who took single 620 mg dose of chloroquine base orally
(Pukrittayakamee et al., 2014, we note that in the original publication it states that this was a
600mg single dose, but this is a typographic error). The healthy volunteer QRS data consisted of
32 measurements in the absence of drug (two separate occasions for each volunteer) and 192 (12
per volunteer) paired chloroquine concentration-QRS measurements.

Literature review
We conducted a literature review of all published case reports and hospital cohorts on chloroquine poisoning. We extracted data from 12 case reports (13 patients) in which whole blood or
plasma chloroquine concentrations were reported. We analysed only case reports in which blood
or plasma concentrations were obtained ante-mortem as the post mortem redistribution of chloroquine from tissues to the blood is unknown. However, the data from the case reports exhibited
signiÔ¨Åcant bias towards patients with high concentrations who survived (i.e. unusual cases) so
these were excluded from the Ô¨Ånal model. To review reports of Torsade de Pointes associated
with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine PubMed and EmBase were searched using the terms ‚ÄòHYDROXYCHLOROQUINE‚Äô or ‚ÄòCHLOROQUINE‚Äô AND either ‚ÄòTORSADE‚Äô, ‚ÄòARRHYTHMIA‚Äô, ‚ÄòSUDDEN DEATH‚Äô
or ‚ÄòCARDIAC ARREST‚Äô.
We searched ClinicalTrials.gov on the 11th of June 2020 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/home) for
clinical trials using hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 (search
terms: condition=COVID; other terms=hospital; intervention=hydroxychloroquine OR Chloroquine;
status=recruiting). This gave 77 results. After Ô¨Åltering out prevention studies, we could determine
the total dose in base equivalent for 55 treatment studies (these are presented in a supplementary
Ô¨Åle).

Pharmacokinetic modelling
Chloroquine has complex pharmacokinetic properties characterised by an enormous volume of
distribution and a terminal elimination half-life of over a month. Whole blood (the currently preferred matrix) concentrations are signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than plasma concentrations because of binding to red blood cells, leukocytes and platelets. Two models were used for simulation in NONMEM
(v.7.4.3, Icon Development Solution, Ellicott City, MD; the NONMEM simulation code is available
online; see github repository link below). The Ô¨Årst was a published two-compartment disposition
model with a transit compartment absorption model using whole blood measurements from adult
vivax malaria patients treated with a standard 25 mg base/kg regimen over three days (H√∂glund
et al., 2016) (ùëõ = 75, with over 1000 concentrations measurements). Allometric scaling of body
weight, with the exponent Ô¨Åxed to 0.75 for clearance parameters and 1 for volume parameters,
was added to the published model to predict concentrations at different body weights. The second was a three-compartment model with the absorption described by a transit compartment
model Ô¨Åtted to plasma chloroquine concentrations from healthy adult volunteers who took oral
single 600 mg base equivalent doses of chloroquine on two separate occasions with or without
primaquine (Pukrittayakamee et al., 2014, ùëõ = 16, a total of 640 concentration measurements:
each volunteer was sampled 20 times at two separate dosing occasions; the model is not yet published). This model included allometric scaling as described above. Published estimates for the
plasma to blood ratio vary considerably (reviewed in M√©garbane et al., 2010). We choose a scaling
ratio of 4 as this resulted in equal median concentrations for both pharmacokinetic models and is
approximately the median value from the review in M√©garbane et al. (2010).
Five potential chloroquine COVID-19 adult treatment regimens, and one malaria treatment regimen were simulated:
1. 600 mg base, twice daily for 10 days, as trialled in Brazil, no loading dose was given (Borba
et al., 2020).
2. 620 mg base loading dose at 0 and 6 hours, followed by 310 mg base twice daily (starting at
12 hours) for nine days. Except for the loading dose, this is equivalent to the regimen recommended by the Health Commission of Guangdong Province (Multicenter collaboration group
of Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province and Health Commission
of Guangdong Province for chloroquine in the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia.,
2020). This is the regimen given in the World Health Organisation SOLIDARITY trial.
3. 620 mg base loading dose on day 1 at 0 and 6 hours, followed by 310 mg base twice daily
(starting at 12 hours) for six days.
4. Weight-adjusted dosing regimen targeting loading doses at 0 and 6 hours of 10 mg base/kg,
followed by maintenance doses of 5 mg/kg for 9 days (starting at 12 hours), approximated to
the nearest 155 mg base whole tablets.
5. Weight-adjusted dosing regimen targeting loading doses at 0 and 6 hours of 10 mg base/kg,
followed by maintenance doses of 5 mg/kg for 6 days (starting at 12 hours), approximated to
the nearest 155 mg base whole tablets.
6. A ‚ÄúÔ¨Çat‚Äù standard malaria dosing regimen of 620 mg base on days 1 & 2, followed by 310 mg
base on day 3, for the same range of weights.
Regimens 1-3 & 6 are ‚ÄúÔ¨Çat‚Äù dosing regimens (i.e. not weight-based). All regimens were simulated
for weights ranging from 40 to 90 kg at intervals of 5 kg.

Concentration-dependent model of death in chloroquine self-poisoning
We compared the relationship between admission whole blood chloroquine + desethyl metabolite
concentration and death using logistic regression (maximum likelihood Ô¨Åt) for data gathered retrospectively (ùëõ = 91 Riou et al., 1988) and data collected prospectively (ùëõ = 302 Riou et al., 1988;
Clemessy et al., 1995, 1996; M√©garbane et al., 2010). The retrospective data gave substantially different results with much higher probabilities of death (approximately 60% versus 5% at 20ùúámol/L,

see Appendix 1). We therefore excluded the 91 retrospectively studied patients reported in Riou
et al. but retained the 11 prospectively studied patients from that publication. This gave a total of
302 unique patient observations.
We modelled the probability of death as a function of the log whole blood peak chloroquine
concentration (ùúámol/L) using Bayesian logistic regression. The peak concentration is considered
a latent variable (unobserved) for patients whose blood concentrations peaked before hospital
admission or for patients who only had their whole blood concentration measured on admission
(ùëõ = 241). The peak concentration is considered observed for those who had multiple concentration measurements and for whom the peak occurred after hospital admission (ùëõ = 61). The model
does not attempt to estimate individual peak concentrations for the patients whose peak concentrations were unobserved, but rather an average difference ùõø, on the log scale, between peak and
admission concentrations (this can be considered as a bias correction term). This assumes that the
probability of death, conditional on the peak drug concentration, was the same for those whose
blood concentrations peaked before and after hospital admission. This assumption is likely to be
incorrect. Patients whose levels peaked after hospital admission would have received supportive
hospital care more rapidly (relative to time of peak concentration) than those who peaked before
admission. However, the extent of this bias is unmeasurable.
In addition, the model adjusted for differences in hospital treatment received between the
three cohorts: cohort 1 was the 11 prospectively studied patients in Riou et al. (1988); cohort 2
was the 247 studied in Clemessy et al. (1995, 1996) (named herein ‚Äòthe Clemessy cohort‚Äô); cohort 3
was the 44 patients studied in M√©garbane et al. (2010). Substantial differences in standard of care
occurred between these three cohorts. For example, the use of emergency extracorporeal life support started in the early 2000s and is thought to considerably reduced mortality M√©garbane et al.
(2007). The prior over the study speciÔ¨Åc intercept terms was a normal distribution with mean 0 and
standard deviation 0.5.
To model the relationship between whole blood chloroquine concentrations and a fatal outcome we use a correction factor ùõæ to account for the desethyl metabolite included in the assay
measurement. Between 1 and 6 hours post ingestion, the desethyl metabolite will account for approximately 30% of the total concentration measured (Pukrittayakamee et al., 2014). The values
of ùõæ and ùõø are not directly identiÔ¨Åable from the data, but there are good a priori estimates for ùõø
(Pukrittayakamee et al., 2014). The data from the individuals whose levels peaked after hospital
admission were used to construct an informative prior distribution for ùõæ.
The Bayesian posterior distribution over the model parameters used informative prior distributions for all four parameters. For the intercept term ùõº, this was a normal distribution with mean
-15 (e.g. 1 in 107 chance of dying at a whole blood concentration of 1ùúámol/L), and standard deviation 1; for the ùõΩ coeÔ¨Écient on the log concentration, it was a normal distribution with mean 4 and
standard deviation 1. The bias term ùõø was given an exponential prior with rate 8 (estimated from
the 57 individuals whose levels peaked after hospital admission). The metabolite correction factor
ùõæ was given a normal prior with mean 0.7 and standard deviation 0.065 (the standard deviation
was estimated from chloroquine and metabolite measurements in 107 malaria patients from Chu
et al. (2018)).

For each chloroquine regimen and each weight category considered, we simulated 1,000 pharmacokinetic proÔ¨Åles. The simulation was run from the time of the Ô¨Årst dose until 7 hours after the
last dose (7 hours will adequately capture the Cmax value). Each simulated pharmacokinetic proÔ¨Åle
was summarised by the peak concentration denoted Cmax . The set of Cmax values were then used
to predict mean fatality ratios using the concentration-fatality model estimated from the chloroquine self-poisoning data (herein referred to as the pharmacodynamic model). We propagated
uncertainty from the pharmacodynamic model by estimating desired quantities using 4000 random draws from the posterior distribution. For the estimation of mortality under the different reg-

imens, we truncated the concentration-dependent mortality prediction at 1% (the concentration
at which this truncation occurs will vary depending on the draw from the posterior distribution).
This is because estimating mortality ratios below 1% is unreliable given a sample size of a few hundred and will be highly dependent on the prior distribution chosen and the parametric form of the
concentration-fatality curve. For example, the posterior predictive model estimates a mortality of
the order of 1 per 100,000 at 2ùúámol/L. This is approximately the background rate of sudden unexplained death in a young adult population (Chan et al., 2018), therefore rendering the prediction
essentially unveriÔ¨Åable (non-scientiÔ¨Åc).

We estimated the relationship between chloroquine concentrations and QRS interval duration by
Ô¨Åtting a Bayesian sigmoid Emax model. The likelihood function of the regression model was speciÔ¨Åed as:
(
)
Emax ‚àí Emin
(ùëó)
QRSùëñ ‚àº Normal Emax ‚àí
,
ùúñ
, ùëó = {1, 2, 3}
(1)
1 + ùëíùëò(log10 ùë•ùëñ ‚àíE50 ) ùëñ
where QRSùëñ is the observed QRS duration and ùë•ùëñ is the chloroquine concentration for individual ùëñ. This concentration is simultaneously measured (plasma converted to whole blood) for the
healthy volunteers, and is the admission chloroquine concentration (70% of measured whole blood
concentration to remove the metabolite contribution) for the self-poisoning patients. The standard
error ùúñ is modelled separately for the self-poisoning patients and the healthy volunteers. This helps
to partially adjust for the concentration-dependent heteroskedasticity in QRS values and the differences in measurement error between pooled datasets (manually read ECGs in the Clemessy cohort
and much harder to correctly read at the high concentrations seen in self-poisoning (cohorts & 3)
versus automated reading in the healthy volunteer data).
The data from the self-poisoning patients are considered independent and identically distributed
conditional on the sigmoid regression model and the study cohort. The prior for the error term
ùúñùëñ(1) for the Clemessy cohort was a normal distribution with mean 25 and standard deviation 5. The
prior for the error term ùúñùëñ(2) for cohort 3 was a normal distribution with mean 20 and standard
deviation 5.
The data from the healthy volunteers are analysed with a hierarchical error model (also known
as a mixture model). We estimate an individual intercept term for each volunteer (the prior distribution over intercept terms was a normal with mean 0 and standard deviation ùúéùêªùëâ ; the prior over
ùúéùêªùëâ was an exponential distribution with rate parameter 0.2 corresponding to a standard deviation of 5 msec in normal QRS values between individuals). The measurement error model, ùúñùëñ(3) , was
then given a normal prior with mean 5 and standard deviation 3). The QRS interval data from the
healthy volunteers taken in absence of drug were used to estimate the mean increase in QRS at
detectable drug levels (the difference between Emin and the mean QRS when no drug is detectable).
From a visual check of the raw QRS data (Appendix 6), the QRS values from the Clemessy series
appear to slightly biased downwards, and so we model this with an additional bias term (prior is a
normal distribution with mean -20 and standard deviation 5). Emax is the maximum mean QRS duration (prior is a normal distribution with mean 180 and standard deviation 10); Emin is the minimum
mean QRS duration (prior is a normal distribution with mean 90 and standard deviation 4); E50 is
log10 chloroquine concentration that results in a mean QRS duration of half the maximal increase
(prior is a normal distribution with mean 1.3 and standard deviation 1); the slope parameter ùëò is
modelled on the log scale (prior is a normal distribution with mean 1 and standard deviation 1).
The prior distribution over the hierarchical intercept terms for the healthy volunteers was a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation ùúéùëñ which was given an exponential prior with
rate 0.2.

Statistical analysis

536

Both Bayesian regression models were Ô¨Åtted to data using stan (Carpenter et al., 2017), implemented in R. Uncertainty around each Ô¨Åt was reported as centred 95% credible intervals. For
each model 105 posterior samples were drawn from 8 independent chains, the Ô¨Årst half were discarded for burn-in and second half thinned every 100 samples. This resulted in 4000 posterior samples used to characterise the posterior distributions. Mixing was assessed by agreement between
chains and traceplots. Comparison of prior and posterior distributions are given in Appendix 2.

Appendix 2 Figure 1. Comparison between prior distributions (thick red lines) and posterior
distributions (shown as histograms) for the parameters of the concentration-fatality model. The top
three histograms show the estimated intercept terms for the three cohorts (cohort 1: Riou et al.
(1988); cohort 2: Clemessy et al. (1995, 1996); cohort 3: M√©garbane et al. (2010)). ùõº is overall intercept
term; ùõΩ: log-concentration coeÔ¨Écient; ùõø: bias term for patients whose peak concentration was not
observed; ùõæ: fraction of concentration that is due to chloroquine and not the metabolite. This shows
that the data are informative with respect to the ùõΩ coeÔ¨Écient on the log concentration. This is the
desired behaviour given we know that chloroquine at low doses is very safe. See the meta-analysis of
the related bisquinoline compound piperaquine showing that under normal dosing, the mortality is
unlikely to be greater than the background mortality rate (Chan et al., 2018).

Appendix 4 Figure 1. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model of chloroquine induced mortality
under the plasma pharmacokinetic model of chloroquine. Top: pooled whole blood chloroquine +
desethylchloroquine concentrations from admission samples in prospectively studied self-poisoning
patients (Riou et al., 1988; Clemessy et al., 1995, 1996; M√©garbane et al., 2010). The data are shown
as overlapping histograms for survivors (blue, ùëõ = 269) and fatal cases (red, ùëõ = 33). The overlapping
areas are shown by the intermediate burgundy colour. Bottom: Bayesian posterior distribution over
the concentration-response curve (mean and 95% credible interval) describing the relationship
between admission whole blood chloroquine concentrations (after adjustment for the deseythl
metabolite) and death, with the chloroquine concentration shown on the log10 scale. The vertical lines
show the upper 99 percentiles of the predicted Cmax distribution in a 70 kg adult under the plasma
pharmacokinetic model for the six regimens considered (yellow: 10 day regimen with maintenance
dose of 310 mg; pink: 10 day regimen with maintenance dose of 600 mg; brown: 7 day regimen with
maintenance dose of 310 mg; grey: malaria regimen). The vertical light pink shaded area shows the
posterior credible interval over the concentrations associated with 1% mortality. This is the equivalent
output of the whole blood model shown in Figure 1, main text.

Appendix 4 Figure 2. The predicted risk of fatal toxicity across the six regimens simulated under the
plasma pharmacokinetic model. Panel A shows the simulated distribution of Cmax values in a 70 kg
adult for the six regimens considered. The vertical red shaded area shows the 95% credible interval
for the 1% mortality threshold concentration. Panel B shows the probability that an individual will
cross the 1% mortality threshold value as a function of body weight for the different regimens (log10
scale on the y-axis). Panel C shows the predicted mortality per thousand for the six regimens as a
function of body weight.

Appendix 5 Figure 1. The total doses (in grams) and duration of 55 COVID-19 treatment trials
currently recruiting participants which extracted from ClinicalTrials.gov on the 11th June 2020. The
black square boxes show the four ‚ÄòÔ¨Çat‚Äô dosing chloroquine regimens simulated in this paper. Note
that multiple trials give the exact same dose regimen so there are fewer than 55 unique points on the
graph. Some multi-country trials such as SOLIDARITY use both hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine
depending on the countries included. As the majority of countries worldwide use hydroxychloroquine
we have coloured these trials in red. The extracted data can be found in the supplementary materials.

Appendix 6 Figure 1. Raw concentration-QRS scatter plot without any bias adjustment or truncation
for the QRS data. To model the relationship between concentrations and QRS we truncated the QRS
values at 200 msec (durations longer than 200 msec are physiologically very unlikely) and estimated a
bias term for the data from the Clemessy series (Clemessy et al., 1995, 1996).
