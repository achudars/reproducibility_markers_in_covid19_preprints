Abstract

18

Background:

19

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to the development of various vaccines. Real-life

20

data on immune responses elicited in the most vulnerable group of vaccinees over 80

21

years old is still underrepresented despite the prioritization of the elderly in vaccination

22

campaigns.

23

Methods:

24

We conducted a cohort study with two age groups, young vaccinees below the age of

25

60 and elderly vaccinees over the age of 80, to compare their antibody responses to

26

the first and second dose of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination.

While the majority of participants in both groups produced specific IgG antibody titers

29

against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, titers were significantly lower in elderly

30

participants. Although the increment of antibody levels after the second immunization

31

was higher in elderly participants, the absolute mean titer of this group remained lower

32

than the <60 group. After the second vaccination, 31.3 % of the elderly had no

33

detectable neutralizing antibodies in contrast to the younger group, in which only 2.2%

34

had no detectable neutralizing antibodies.

35

Conclusion:

36

Our data suggests that lower frequencies of neutralizing antibodies after BNT162b2

37

vaccination in the elderly population may require earlier revaccination to ensure strong

38

immunity and protection against infection.

Introduction

42

In December 2019, authorities in China’s Wuhan province reported a lung disease of

43

unknown cause. Back in January 2020, the sequence of a novel coronavirus was

44

published and identified as the causative agent of this disease [1]. In March of the

45

same year, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the spread of this virus a

46

public health emergency of international concern. With limited drug treatment options

47

available, research on prophylactic immunization, especially for high-risk groups,

48

became a priority [2].

49

The zoonotic beta-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to severe acute

50

respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome

51

coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused outbreaks in 2002/2003 and 2012

52

respectively [3]. SARS-CoV-2 and its associated disease COVID-19, however, show

53

distinct characteristics [4] including a highly variable severity of clinical symptoms, from

54

asymptomatic infection to severe COVID-19 with lung manifestation and acute

55

respiratory distress syndrome. Viral replication usually begins and continues in the

56

upper respiratory tract for up to 14 days after the onset of symptoms, which contributes

57

to the rapid spread of the virus. While the clinical course of COVID-19 is usually quite

58

mild and often presents with flu-like symptoms, up to 14% of patients show a severe

59

course of infection [5]. The elderly population is primarily at risk for severe disease, as

60

adults over 65 years of age account for approximately 80% of hospitalizations [6, 7]

61

and higher death rates have been reproducibly reported in this population [8, 9].

62

Additionally, prolonged disease from hospitalization, delayed viral clearance, and/or a

63

higher fatality rate is also reported to be age-related [9]. Comorbidities such as

64

cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity are discussed as the primary cause of

65

a more severe COVID-19 course, however, these comorbidities alone do not explain

66

why age is such a strong risk factor.

67

Aging is accompanied by changes in the immune system, particularly affecting

68

adaptive immunity’s three fundamental pillars, i.e. B cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T

69

cells [10]. Although hallmarks of immunosenescence depend on multifaceted factors

70

and vary greatly between individuals, they are generally considered to be related to i)

71

the decreased ability to respond to new antigens associated with a reduced peripheral

72

plasmablast response; (ii) decreased capacity of memory T cells and (iii) a low level of

73

persistent chronic inflammation [11-14]. This leads to declining immune efficiency and

74

fidelity, resulting in increased susceptibility to infectious diseases and decreased

75

response to vaccinations. Additionally, it contributes to increased susceptibility to age-

76

related pathological conditions including cardiovascular diseases or autoreactive

77

diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis [12, 15].

78

In December 2020, the first vaccines for COVID-19 were approved worldwide and the

79

first vaccinations were carried out [16-19]. While the German Standing Committee on

80

Vaccination (STIKO) recommends immunization against SARS-CoV-2, access to the

81

vaccine in Germany and many other countries worldwide at the beginning of 2021 is

82

offered in a prioritization procedure due to limited availability. First, groups of people

83

who are at particularly high risk for severe courses of COVID-19 disease or who are

84

professionally in close contact with such vulnerable people were vaccinated. These

85

two prioritized groups include senior residents of nursing homes aged ≥ 80 years, and

86

their caregivers typically aged ≤ 65 years. A recent, thorough study using mathematical

87

modeling to investigate vaccine prioritization strategies supports the preferential

88

vaccination of the elderly [20]. This study describes a scenario where cumulative

89

incidence rates were minimized when vaccination of the population aged 20-49 years

90

was prioritized, while mortality was decreased when the population aged 60 years or

91

older was prioritized. This model took age-structure, age-related efficacy, and

92

infection-fatality rates into account. They conclude that prioritizing the population aged

93

> 60 years, thus directly protecting the vulnerable population, would decrease mortality

94

rates, a strategy that is currently employed by various nations but without the support

95

of recent and thorough data [20].

96

The current vaccination strategy for the Biontech/Pfizer Comirnaty (BNT162b2) is a

97

two-step "prime and boost" procedure in which the first vaccination is followed by a

98

second vaccination with the same dose at least 21 days later [18]. Initial experience

99

shows high effectiveness of the vaccines in preventing clinical symptoms after the first

100

dose [21].

101

Immediately after the start of the official vaccination campaign in Germany at the end

102

of December 2020, we started a daily practice study in a retirement home. To

103

accommodate two clearly distinct populations in this study, we compared the induction

104

of immune responses between young and elderly vaccinees (< 60 years of age and >

105

80 years of age respectively) who received their first and second vaccines on the same

106

day. For this purpose, the IgG titers against SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 as well as

107

neutralization titers were determined after both the first and second vaccination. Self-

108

reported side effects were scored according to the sum of symptoms post-vaccination.

Characteristics of the study population are summarized in Table 1. The ethics

114

committee of the Medical Faculty at the Heinrich-Heine University Düsseldorf,

115

Germany (study no. 2021-1287), approved the study. Informed consent was obtained

116

from all volunteers (N = 179) before sampling. All blood samples were collected on

117

January 15th, 2021 (first collection, 17—19 days after first immunization) and February

118

5th, 2021 (second collection, 17 days after second immunization) and stored at 4 °C.

119

Medical questionnaires including the following categories were scored according to the

120

sum of symptoms post-vaccination: i) elevated temperature and fever, ii) chills, iii) pain

121

at the injection site, iv) head/limb pain, v) fatigue/tiredness, vi) nausea/dizziness, vii)

122

other complaints (unscored).

Commercially available Anti-SARS-CoV-2 tests systems

126

Samples were tested for Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using two commercially

127

available test systems: Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2-QuantiVac-ELISA measuring

128

IgG levels against SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 subunit and Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2

129

IgG recognizing SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) antibodies.

130

Euroimmun ELISA was performed on the Euroimmun Analyzer I-2P according to the

131

manufacturer's instructions. Results < 25.6 BAU/ml were considered as negative, ≥

132

25.6 BAU/ml ≤ 35.2 BAU/ml as indeterminate, and > 35.2 BAU/ml as positive (BAU =

133

Binding Antibody Units). The upper detection limit for undiluted samples was > 384

134

BAU/ml, the lower detection limit was < 3.2 BAU/ml. For samples over the detection

135

limit, 1:10 or 1:100 dilutions were performed in IgG sample buffer according to the

136

manufacturer’s instruction. The SARS-CoV-2 IgG chemiluminescent microparticle

137

immunoassay (CMIA) from Abbott was performed on an ARCHITECT i2000 SR. The

138

relation of chemiluminescent RLU and the calibrator is given as the calculated index

139

(S/C). An index (S/C) <1.4 as was considered negative, ≥1.4 was considered positive.

142

In-house SARS-CoV-2 neutralization test

143

A neutralization test with the infectious SARS-CoV-2 isolate (EPI_ISL_425126) was

144

performed in a BSL-3 facility to determine the SARS-CoV-2 neutralization capacity of

145

the serum samples after the first and second vaccination. A serial dilution endpoint

146

neutralization test for SARS-CoV-2 was performed as previously described [22]. Serial

147

dilutions of heat-inactivated (56°C, 30 minutes) serum samples were pre-incubated in

148

cell-free plates with 100 TCID50 units of SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour at 37° C. After pre-

149

incubation, 100µl of cell suspension containing 7×104/ml Vero cells (ATTC-CCL-81)

150

were added. Plates were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 4 days before microscopic

151

inspection for virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE). The neutralization titer was

152

determined as the highest serum dilution without CPE. Tests were performed in

153

duplicate for each sample. Positive, negative, virus only, and cell growth controls were

154

run during each assay.

Statistical analysis

158

The data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 25 (IBM ©) and GraphPad Prism 9.0.00

159

(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Categorical data were studied using

160

Fisher’s exact test or Pearson’s chi-square test, depending on the sample size.

161

Quantitative data were analyzed by the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test for two

162

groups of paired and unpaired samples. Simple linear regression was performed using

163

GraphPad Prism version 9.0.0 (the coefficient of determination R 2 and p-values are

Participant characteristics

170

In total, blood samples from 176 volunteers, young and elderly vaccinees (<60 / >80

171

years of age) were analyzed for vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2 spike specific IgG titers

172

and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies after a prime and boost vaccination

173

campaign using BNT162b2 (Comirnaty BioNTech/Pfizer) to screen for age-related

174

differences in their immune response. Therefore, samples were collected at two time

175

points, 17—19 days after the first vaccination and 17 days after the second

176

vaccination. To be able to distinguish the immune response of the vaccinees from

177

those

using the SARS-CoV-2 IgG chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA).

Vaccination-induced SARS-CoV-2 spike specific IgG levels differ between young and
elderly vaccinees after the first and second vaccination

190
191

The first sample collection was carried out 17—19 days after the volunteers received

192

their first vaccination in late December 2020. At this timepoint, quantitative SARS-CoV-

193

2 spike S1 specific IgG levels between the two groups differed significantly (p <

194

0.0001). For the younger group of vaccinees, IgG titers ranged between 0—3840.0

195

BAU/ml with a mean of 313.3 BAU/ml after the first vaccination. Only 4.4 % of the

196

participants had titers below the cut-off, and 2.3% were indeterminate (Figure 1A). The

197

mean titer for the group > 80 years of age was 41.2 BAU/ml with titers ranging from

198

0—484.7 BAU/ml. In this group, 65.9% showed titers below the cut-off (>35.6), and

199

9.4% were indeterminate.

200

The second sample collection was carried out 17 days after the volunteers received

201

their second vaccination, at a time point when full protection is suggested (>7 days

202

according to [18]). Nevertheless, there was still a significant difference in IgG levels

203

between the two groups. The mean titer of the younger group increased more than 10-

204

fold (3702.0 BAU/ml) and ranged from 81.6—32000.0 with no participant testing below

205

cut-off (Figure 1B). While the mean titer for elderly vaccinees increased to 1332.0

206

BAU/ml (0—16891.0 BAU/ml), 10.6% of the participants in this group still had titers

207

below the cut-off.

208

The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 spike specific IgG titers showed an extremely

209

significant (p<0.001) difference between the two age groups, after both the first and

210

second vaccination, suggesting an attenuated antibody response in the group of

211

elderly vaccinees > 80 years of age. While the gap in mean values narrowed after the

212

second vaccination, which in particular underlines once again the necessity of a

213

second vaccination, several elderly participants remained below the detection limit of

214

the anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay. A general age-dependent negative correlation in SARS-

236

We next determined the neutralization capacity in our cohort after the first and second

237

dose of vaccination. At 17—19 days after the first vaccination, the majority of

238

participants, regardless of their age, failed to display neutralizing antibody titers. In the

239

group of younger vaccines, 16.1 % displayed neutralizing antibodies with titers ranging

240

between 1:10 to 1:2560. In the group of elderly vaccinees, only 1.2 % had developed

241

neutralizing antibodies after the first vaccination (Figure 2A).

242

After the second dose, a neutralization titer was attained by 97.8% of the younger

243

vaccinees. In the elderly group, 68.7% showed titers ranging from 1:10 to 1:320.

244

Remarkably, in 31.3% of the elderly vaccinees neutralizing antibodies were not

245

detectable after the second vaccination, and thus, were potentially without

246

seroprotection (Figure 2B).

To assess differences in post-vaccination symptoms between the age groups and to

evaluate a potential correlation with antibody titers, medical questionnaires were

257

completed at the two collection time points.

258

After the first vaccination, half of the younger cohort (51.6%) reported no symptoms,

the remaining vaccinees recorded post-vaccination symptoms with a score ranging

260

between 1 and 4. In turn, 93.9 % of elderly vaccinees reported no symptoms; the

261

remaining 6.1% reported either one or two of the scored symptoms (Figure 3A).

262

After the second dose, only 25.8% of the younger vaccinees had no symptoms. While

263

38.7% of this group reported only one of the scored symptoms, 35.5% reported a

264

combination of symptoms scoring between 2 and 6. Among the elderly, 83.1% reported

265

no symptoms, and the remaining 16.9% of this group reported symptoms up to a score

266

of 3 (Figure 3B). However, there was no general correlation between vaccination-

Discussion

276

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to the development of various vaccines and

277

vaccine strategies, which have been made available to the public by either emergency

278

use designation or conditional marketing authorization. Inevitably, data on populations

279

that are difficult to enroll including immunocompromised or cohorts <16 years or >80

280

years who might show reduced vaccine reactiveness are limited. The main goal of this

281

real-life study was to investigate the efficacy of the current vaccination strategy in the

282

most vulnerable group of vaccinees (>80 years old) compared to those younger than

283

60 years. We compared the induction of immune responses in these two age groups

284

after the first and second BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination by measuring vaccine9

285

induced SARS-CoV-2 spike specific IgG and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies.

286

While the majority of both young and elderly vaccinees raised IgG responses after their

287

second vaccination, the induction of ELISA-IgG and in particular neutralizing antibody

288

levels were significantly lower in the elderly vaccinees.

289

The main differences between the two groups of vaccinated individuals are likely a

290

consequence of immunosenescence, which describes the phenomenon of reduced

291

adaptive immune responses e.g. antibody responses in the elderly [23]. It is well

292

described that elderly individuals not only have higher rates of morbidity due to

293

infection but also respond less to vaccination [24-26], mainly due to a decline in cellular

294

as well as humoral immunity.

295

The notion that humoral vaccination responses are impaired with increasing age is well

296

depicted in our cohort, as the mean titer of SARS-CoV-2 spike specific IgG remains

297

2.8-fold lower after the second vaccination for the elderly group of vaccinees compared

298

to the younger cohort (Figure 1B). Additionally, a general intra- and inter-group trend

in negative correlation between age and IgG titer is visible after both vaccinations

300

(Figure 1C/1D). More importantly, a similar age-dependent trend can be seen for

301

SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing antibody titers: While neutralization antibody titers

302

were attained by 97.8% of the younger vaccinees, 31.3% of the elderly remained

303

without neutralization antibody titers after the second vaccination (Figure 2B).

304

The lack of neutralizing antibody responses in about one-third of the elderly group

305

raises the questions whether the effectiveness of vaccine-induced immune protection

306

may be transferred to this population without explicit testing. Especially since

307

neutralizing, antibody levels correlate with protection against many viruses including

308

SARS-CoV-2 in humans [27, 28] and recent data suggest that high neutralizing titers

309

are particularly important for protection against novel circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants

310

confering immune escape [29-31].

311

Although it is well known that the response to primary vaccination is weaker in the

312

elderly [24, 32], it is remarkable that this observation also expands to the younger

313

cohort. While there are reports that high neutralization titers were attained after

314

receiving both doses of the Biontech/Pfizer Comirnaty (BNT162b2) vaccinations [18,

315

33, 34], which is in line with our data for the younger cohort, there is a lack of

316

information on the antibody responses after the first vaccination. The latter gains

317

particular importance since different vaccination schedules for the same vaccines have

318

been adopted in several countries. These include a delay of the second vaccination,

319

as implemented by the UK or Israel, to allow for the initial primary vaccination to a

320

larger proportion of the population, a strategy which is controversially discussed [35,

321

36]. The observation that single-dose vaccinees broadly lacked neutralizing antibody

322

responses quickly raises the question, whether these individuals might still acquire

323

infections and may transmit the disease while remaining asymptomatic. This

324

assumption is supported by recent results of a large Israeli study which reports a 46%

325

effectiveness in preventing a documented infection 14 to 20 days after the first dose,

326

the BNT162b2 vaccine [37].

327

While this study was in progress, the first promising reports on the experience with

328

COVID vaccination came from Israel and Scotland [38]. It appears that even after the

329

first SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, a significant decrease in hospitalizations is seen in the

330

overall vaccinated population but also the >80 year old group. However, it is not yet

331

clear how long this protective effect of vaccination lasts. Our data presented here

332

suggests that it might be necessary to define strategies to overcome age-related

333

limitations for COVID-19 vaccination. Moderna has recently demonstrated an

334

increased immune response determined by higher binding and neutralizing antibody

335

titers by increasing the dose of the second vaccination from 25 µl to 100 µl [39].

336

Strategies to enhance immunogenicity such as the use of adjuvants, application of

337

increased amounts or multiple doses of the same vaccine, or the combination of

338

different vaccines for a heterologous prime/boost should be rapidly tested and

339

implemented in COVID-19 vaccination protocols. Furthermore, since the majority of

340

vaccinees did not obtain neutralizing antibody titers after the first vaccination, we

341

suggest that postponing a second vaccination with this vaccine is neither advisable for

342

younger nor elderly populations.

343

This study provides insight into age-dependent limitations of immune responses

344

elicited after the first and second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. By comparing similar-

345

sized cohorts of vaccinees aged < 60 years and > 80 years, we found that more than

346

30% of elderly vaccinees did not attain neutralizing antibody responses after their

347

second vaccination. Nevertheless, recent studies show that even after the first

348

vaccination, severe courses of COVID-19 are attenuated. The elderly population is

349

prioritized by many vaccination schedules, despite the fact that this age group is

350

underrepresented in previous studies, and hence, there is still a lack of data concerning
