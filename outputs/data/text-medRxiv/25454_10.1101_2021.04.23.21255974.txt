Abstract

16

Background: While vaccines ensure individual protection against COVID-19 infection, delay in receipt

17

or refusal of vaccines will have both individual and community impacts. The behavioral factors of

18

vaccine hesitancy or refusal are a crucial dimension that need understanding to implicate appropriate

19

interventions. The aim of this study was to assess the behavioral determinants of COVID-19 vaccine

20

acceptance and to provide recommendations to increase the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in Bangladesh.

21

Methods: We employed a Barrier Analysis (BA) approach to examine twelve potential behavioral

22

determinants (drawn from the Health Belief Model and Theory of Reasoned Action [TRA]) of intended

23

vaccine acceptance. We conducted 45 interviews with those who intended to take the vaccine (Acceptors)

24

and another 45 interviews with those who did not have that intention (Non-acceptors). We performed data

25

analysis to find statistically significant differences and to identify which beliefs were most highly

26

associated with acceptance and non-acceptance with COVID-19 vaccines.

27

Results:

28

COVID-19 vaccine Acceptors in Dhaka were different from Non-acceptors in terms of many of their

29

beliefs and responses. The behavioral determinants associated with the behavior included perceived

30

social norms, perceived safety of COVID-19 vaccines and trust in them, perceived risk/susceptibility,

31

perceived self-efficacy, perceived positive and negative consequences, perceived action efficacy,

32

perceived severity of COVID-19, access, and perceived divine will. In line with the Health Belief Model,

33

beliefs about the disease itself were highly correlated with vaccine acceptance, although not the only

34

determinant.

35

government health facilities, schools, and kiosks, and having vaccinators maintain proper COVID-19

36

health and safety protocols as to ways to make it easier to boost acceptance.

37

Conclusion:

Other responses of Acceptors provide clues such as providing vaccination through

38

An effective behavior change strategy for COVID-19 vaccines uptake will need to address multiple

39

beliefs and behavioral determinants, reducing barriers and leveraging enablers identified in this study.

40

The national plans on COVID-19 vaccination should adopt culturally and community label acceptable

and appropriate evidence-based behavior change interventions strategies to promote high vaccination

Introduction

47

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, popularly known as

48

COVID-19, has infected more than 14 million people with more 3 million deaths in 224 countries (1).

49

The pandemic poses an immense threat to the global public health system and is causing social and

50

cultural disruptions (2,3). Bangladesh reported its first clinically-confirmed COVID-19 case on March 8,

51

2020, and as of 19 April 2021, Bangladesh has reported 718,950 COVID-19 cases with 10,385 deaths (4)

52

and the counts are increasing with the passage of time. The social and economic costs of COVID-19 have

53

been significant in the developing countries like Bangladesh (5). As the pandemic is expected to continue

54

to impose enormous burdens of morbidity and mortality, and to severely disrupt societies and economies,

55

the introduction of effective COVID-19 vaccines is the only clinical preventive measure (6). As of 22

56

April 2021, Bangladesh has administered 7 080 699 doses of Oxford/AstraZeneca (COVISHIELD)

57

vaccine were administered in the whole country, out of which, 5 714 090 population received their 1st

58

dose, and 1 366 609 competed for their two doses schedule (7). However, like many other countries, the

59

government has focused the vaccination administration to very specific group of people and general

60

public expected to include in the vaccination program subsequently.

61

Nevertheless, vaccine hesitancy or refusal around COVID-19 vaccines is a growing concern worldwide.

62

The World Health Organization (WHO) identified vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten global health

63

threats in 2019 (8) and this is not exceptional in the case of COVID-19 vaccines. In Bangladesh, a survey

64

reported that 81% of urban (metropolitan, district and municipalities) people would get vaccinated when a

65

COVID-19 vaccine is available (9). In a multi-country survey, it was found that only 71.5% of

66

participants reported that they would be very or somewhat likely to take a COVID-19 vaccine (10). A

67

rapid systematic review of 23 peer-reviewed studies and 103 additional syndicated surveys around

68

COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the US and globally showed that perceived risk, concerns over vaccine

69

safety and effectiveness, doctors’ recommendations, and inoculation history were common factors

70

influencing hesitancy around vaccination (11). Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy was found to be growing

71

between March and November 2020 (12), but improvements in vaccine acceptance have been noted in

72

some parts of the world since November (13). A growing number of studies have identified demographic,

73

socioeconomic, and behavioral factors that are linked with levels of vaccine acceptance (10,14,15). These

74

factors include age and marital status (16,17), level of education and ethnic origin (17–19), previous

75

vaccination with the influenza vaccine (15,20), and gender (16). Moreover, trust, misconceptions,

76

misinformation, and lack of knowledge among the community on vaccine-preventable diseases have been

77

considered influential determinants of the lower level of acceptance (10,11,14,15,21). These factors have

78

influenced vaccine uptake during previous pandemics and outbreaks caused by H1N1, MERS, SARS, and

79

Ebola virus (22–25).

80

A meta-analysis demonstrated that the use of social psychological health behavioral change models (e.g.

81

the HBM and Theory of Planned Behavior) would be useful for identifying the influencing determinants

82

of vaccine acceptance (21). The use of economic models when studying vaccine acceptance or hesitancy

83

exhibit some shortcomings in describing the determinants (21,26,27). Behavioral studies have shown that

84

the decision to vaccinate is often based on perceived benefits, effectiveness, and perceived risk of vaccine

85

side-effects versus infection (28). Systematic reviews on behavioral determinants of health have shown

86

that the HBM was useful in identifying determinants associated with the acceptance of Human

87

Papillomavirus (HPV) (26) and influenza vaccination uptake (29). This model has also been found to be

88

effective in predicting intention to vaccinate against influenza among health care workers in Jordan (30).

89

Similarly, a study using Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) (which was developed from the TRA)

90

showed that vaccine intentions were determined by attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral

91

control regarding vaccinations among the college students (31). In a comparative study of TPB and TRA,

92

it was found that attitudes and perceptions of social support were determinants for HPV vaccination

93

uptake (27).

94

Vaccine hesitancy and acceptance are complex in nature, and vaccine decisions can vary according to

95

context, time and place (32). Global studies on demographic determinants can have limited value when

96

looking at determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in a given country, time, and geographical area.

97

The Technical Advisory Group on Behavioral Insights and Sciences for Health of WHO has identified a

98

number of behavioral drivers including enabling environment, social influences and motivation and

99

recommended to contextualize these drivers into national plans of COVID-19 vaccination (33).

100

Understanding how different behavioral attributes affect individual preferences about vaccination at as

101

granular level as feasible can help inform public health authorities about the actionable activities and

102

messages that will be necessary to achieve broader community uptake of vaccines. Therefore, the primary

103

objective of this study was to explore the behavioral determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance

104

among people of different societal structures in urban communities in Bangladesh. The secondary

105

objective of this study is to provide policy recommendation of culturally acceptable behavioral change

106

intervention points to address these determinants to improve COVID-19 vaccine uptake.

107

Materials and methods

108

Study site and context

109

This Barrier Analysis study was conducted in different urban areas of Dhaka – the capital city in

110

Bangladesh – from January 09-15 2021. Dhaka is the residence of more than 10.3 million people – 6.29

111

percent of total population of the country (34). Between 8 March 2020 and 19 April 2021, there were

112

736,074 COVID-19 confirmed cases with 10,781 reported death (4). While Dhaka makes up about 6.29%

113

of the total population of Bangladesh, almost 71% of the COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh reported as of

114

19 April in Dhaka (61% in Dhaka city alone) (4) and which found as one of the largest hotspots of

115

spreading COVID-19 (35).

116

Study tool

117

A Barrier Analysis (BA) study was conducted to better understand the behavioral determinants of

118

COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Dhaka. BA is a research tool that was developed in 1990 by Davis (36).

119

Based on HBM and TRA, BA studies explore respondents’ beliefs about a behavior. Sometimes certain

120

beliefs about a behavior (e.g., possible COVID-19 vaccination side effects) are common in a population,

121

but are not necessarily associated with vaccine acceptance. BA is meant to , identify the most likely

122

determinants of that behavior(37) . A key feature of BA is that responses from those accepting a behavior

123

(‘Doers’ or ‘Acceptors’) are compared with those who are not (the ‘Non-doers’ or ‘Non-acceptors’) to

124

identify behavioral determinants associated with a particular behavior (e.g., handwashing with soap,

125

getting a vaccine) so that practitioners can develop more effective behavior change messages and

126

activities. BA has been used in more than 40% of low-to-middle-income countries and used extensively

127

by World Vision and other organizations during both the Ebola (38) and COVID-19 pandemics (39). The

128

beliefs and other responses regarding behavioral determinants assessed during BA (see Box 1), are

129

identified with a focus on the most actionable findings. The other details of BA approach can be found

130

elsewhere (40–45). There are BA studies in the peer-reviewed literature on exclusive breastfeeding (46)

131

HWWS among internally displaced women in the Kurdistan region of Iraq (40) timely oral polio

132

vaccination agricultural extension behaviors in India (47), dietary salt reduction in Nepal (48) transition

133

from the lactational amenorrhea method to other modern family planning methods in Bangladesh (36) and

134

cervical cancer screening in Senegal (49).

135

Questionnaire development

136

This study modified the standardized Barrier Analysis questionnaire from the Designing for Behavior

137

Change (DBC) training manual (45).

easier and more difficult to get a COVID-19 vaccine are also assessed
under this determinant.

Perceived social norms

The perception that people important to an individual think that he/she
should get a COVID-19 vaccine when it is available. Questions on who

approves and disapproves of the respondent getting a COVID-19 vaccine
are also assessed under this determinant.
Perceived positive

The positive things a person thinks will happen as a result of getting a

consequences

COVID-19 vaccine (including the perceived advantages of getting a
COVID-19 vaccine).

Perceived negative

The negative things a person thinks will happen as a result of getting

consequences

vaccine (including the perceived disadvantages of getting a COVID-19
vaccine).

Access

The availability of the needed services required for getting a COVID-19
vaccine. This includes perceived barriers related to the cost of
transportation, distance to vaccination posts, queue time, etc.

Perceived susceptibility

A person’s perception of how vulnerable or at risk they are to getting a
disease or problem that the behavior is meant to prevent (i.e., COVID-19
disease in this study).

Perceived severity

The extent to which a person believes it would be serious if they (or
members of their family got) the disease or problem that the behavior is
meant to prevent (i.e., COVID-19 disease in this study).

Perceived action efficacy

The extent to which a person believes that doing the behavior will prevent
the disease/problem that the behavior is meant to prevent (in this study,
that getting a COVID-19 vaccine will prevent COVID-19 infection).

Perceived divine will

The extent to which a person believes that it is Allah approves (or God or
the gods’ will) for him/her to do the behavior (e.g. to get a COVID-19
vaccine). Beliefs about personal agency and “God’s will” are also
explored under this determinant.

Policy

The presence of laws and regulations that may affect whether people do

the behavior (i.e., going for a COVID-19 vaccine in this study).
Culture

The extent to which cultural rules or taboos that may affect whether people
do the behavior (e.g., cultural and religious beliefs about COVID-19
vaccination).

139

140

The BA questionnaire is divided into three parts. The first part includes a set of screening questions to

141

identify whether the participant as either an ‘Acceptor’ or a ‘Non-acceptor’. In the screening section of

142

the questionnaire, self-reported intention questions were used. (Please see Supplementary file 1.) In the

143

second part of the questionnaire, information on the respondents’ age, gender, level of education and

144

profession are obtained. In order to assess 11 of the usual 12 determinants assessed with BA (see Box 1),

145

the third section consists of a set of open- and closed-ended questions (37,44). Based on input and a

146

literature review from NGO experts who worked on increasing vaccine acceptance in the Ebola Vaccine

147

Deployment and Compliance Project, several questions were also added to the standard BA questionnaire

148

to explore respondent’s beliefs on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, trust in vaccine

149

information provided by both community and religious leaders, exposure to misinformation, and level of

150

education. Based on local social media listening, one question was added on perceptions around herd

151

immunity. The questionnaire was developed in English and then was translated into Bengali and back-

152

translated into English to check for accuracy.

153

Sampling

154

We interviewed adult men and women for this BA study and selected them randomly through a

155

convenience sampling strategy from five different areas of Dhaka – the capital city of Bangladesh. The

156

Barrier Analysis approach recommends a minimum sample size of 45 Doers (Acceptors) and 45 Non-

157

doers (Non-acceptors) in order to detect statistically-significant Odds Ratios of 3.0 or higher, an alpha

158

error of 5%, and a power of 80% (37). The data collection team approached adult men and women until

159

they reached 90 respondents (45 Acceptors and 45 Non-acceptors).

Data collection, management and analysis

161

We collected data between 9 to 13 January 2021 through individual interviews with responses recorded

162

on paper-based questionnaires by two teams composed of one female and one male member. Male

163

enumerators interviewed male respondents, and female enumerators interviewed female respondents. A

164

research supervisor assured the quality of data. Following data collection, the data collection team and the

165

lead author coded the open-ended responses thematically, using both an inductive and deductive coding

166

process. At the end of this process, the team quantified the responses in each category for Acceptors and

167

Non-acceptors separately. These categories and the number of responses registered for each were then

168

entered into a standardized BA tabulation sheet that revealed whether differences in the proportion of

169

Acceptors and Non-acceptors providing each response were statistically significant and should be

170

addressed through the behavior change strategy. For each question and category of responses, the BA

171

tabulation calculates the percentage of responses for both Acceptors and Non-Acceptors; the Odds Ratio,

172

the Standard Error, and its confidence interval; the Estimated Relative Risk (ERR); and p-values (see

173

supplementary file 2). This allows identify those differences between Acceptors and Non-acceptors that

174

are statistically significant (at p<0.01) and to see the strength of the associations between each response

175

and the behavior (based on the ERR).

176

Ethical considerations

177

We performed all procedures in studies in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or

178

national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or

179

comparable ethical standards. The study protocol was approved by the institutional Ethics Committee of

180

the Chattogram Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Bangladesh (permit ref. no. CVASU/Dir (R

181

and E) EC/2020/169). We informed respondents about the study objectives, and obtained their written

182

consent before conducted interview. The data collection activities have performed following the COVID-

183

19 safety protocols in Bangladesh that enacted by Directorate General of Health Services in Bangladesh

184

(50) .

187

The statistically significant differences in responses and beliefs were found between Acceptors and Non-

188

acceptors of COVID-19 vaccine are shown below. The categories of determinants are organized from

189

higher to lower estimated relative risk ratios (ERR).

190

3.1 Perceived Social Norms:

191

Some of the strongest predictors of vaccine acceptance in this population are beliefs around both

192

injunctive and descriptive social norms, who the respondent thinks approve or disapproves of COVID-19

193

vaccination, and the proportion of people that they think will go for a COVID-19 vaccine when it is

194

available. The results are shown in Table 1. Specifically, Acceptors were 3.2 times more likely to say

195

they would be “very likely” to get a COVID-19 vaccine if a doctor or nurse approved (p<0.001), while

196

Non-acceptors were 2.6 more likely to say it would be “not likely” that they would get a vaccine if a

197

doctor or nurse recommended it (p<0.001). Acceptors were twice as likely to say that “most people” they

198

know will get a vaccine (p<0.001), and 1.3 times more likely to say that “most close family and friends”

199

will get a vaccine (p=0.003), while conversely, Non-acceptors were 3.5 times more likely to say that

200

“very few people” they knew would get a vaccine (p<0.001) and 1.3 times more likely to say that “most

201

of their close family and friends” would not get a COVID-19 vaccine (p=0.003). In terms of respondents’

202

impressions concerning who disapproves of their getting a COVID-19 vaccine, Acceptors were 1.7 times

203

more likely (than Non-acceptors) to say that “no one” would disapprove (p<0.001). Non-acceptors were

204

1.5 times more likely to say that “my mother” (p<0.004), 1.4 times more likely to say “elderly people”

205

(p=0.009), and 1.7 times more likely to say “people who will not get the vaccine” (p=0.006) would

206

disapprove of their getting a COVID-19 vaccine. In addition, Acceptors were and more likely to say their

207

mother would approve of their getting a COVID-19 vaccine (p<0.001). With regards to community and

208

religious leaders’ influence on the decision to get a COVID-19 vaccine, Acceptors were 1.3 times more

209

likely to say that “most community and religious leaders” would want them to get a vaccine (p=0.007),

210

while Non-acceptors were 1.5 times more likely to say that most community leaders and religious leaders

211

would not want them to get a COVID-19 vaccine (p=0.002).

212

3.2 Perceived Safety of COVID-19 Vaccines:

213

As in many places in the world, concerns about safety of COVID-19 vaccines are affecting intention to

214

accept vaccination in this population. When asked how safe the COVID-19 vaccines are, Non-acceptors

215

were 1.8 times more likely to say that COVID-19 vaccines are “not safe at all” (p<0.001) while Acceptors

216

were 1.4 times more likely to say that COVID-19 vaccines are “mostly safe” (p<0.001) (Table 2).

217

3.3 Perceived Risk / Susceptibility (to COVID-19):

218

Perceived risk of getting COVID-19 – and the level of emotional concern about getting COVID-19 – also

219

appears to be driving intended vaccine acceptance in Dhaka. Acceptors were 1.4 times more likely to say

220

they it was “very likely” that someone in their household would get COVID-19 over the next 3 months

221

(p<0.001) while Non-acceptors were 1.3 times more likely to say that was only “somewhat likely”

222

(p=0.005). When respondents were asked how concerned they were about getting COVID-19 (or

223

someone in their household getting COVID-19), Acceptors were 1.3 times more likely to say that they

224

were “very concerned” (p=0.002) while Non-acceptors were 1.7 times more likely to say that they were

225

only “a little concerned” (p<0.001). Additionally, Non-acceptors were 1.7 times more likely to say that

226

“very few people” have had COVID-19 in their communities (p<0.001) (Table 2).

227

3.4 Perceived Self-efficacy:

228

The respondents were asked two open-ended questions to understand what would make it easier or more

229

difficult to get a COVID-19 vaccine. From the results (Table 3), factors related to how and where the

230

vaccine would be given affects intention to vaccinate, including whether or not proper COVID-19 social

231

distancing and prevention measures are maintained during vaccination.

232

Concerning what made it easier, Acceptors were 1.4 times more likely to say “if vaccination is provided

233

by government health care facilities” (p=0.000), 1.2 times more likely to say “school-based vaccination”

234

(p=0.003), 1.3 times more likely to say “if the vaccines are provided by establishing kiosks” (p=0.001)

235

and 1.2 times more likely to say “if proper health & safety (COVID-19) protocols are maintained while

236

giving the vaccine” (p=0.006) all would make it easier to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Conversely – and

237

interestingly – Non-acceptors were 1.2 times more likely to say “when vaccines are given at home”

238

(p=0.010), and 1.7 times more likely to say “when the vaccine has no side effects” (p=0.002) would make

239

it easier for them to get a COVID-19 vaccine.

240

When asked what would make it more difficult to get a COVID-19 vaccine, Acceptors were 1.3 times

241

more likely to say either “if there are no health measures in the vaccination center due to overcrowding”

242

or “risk of getting infected with COVID-19 while vaccinating” (p=0.001), and 1.2 times more likely to

243

say “if the vaccinator does not follow proper COVID-19 preventive measures” (p=0.005) would make it

244

difficult to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Non-acceptors were 2.4 times more likely to say “when the vaccine

245

has severe side-effects” (p<0.001) and 2 time more likely to say “if there is bribery” (p=0.004) would

246

make it difficult to get a COVID-19 vaccine.

247

3.5 Perceived Positive Consequences and Perceived Negative Consequences:

248

Respondents were also asked what the positive and negative consequences (e.g., advantages and

249

disadvantages) would be of getting a COVID-19 vaccine. While reducing the reduced risk of infection

250

was important, Acceptors were more likely to point out benefits related to livelihood and economic

251

benefits and life getting back to normal. Specifically (Table 4), Acceptors were 1.3 times more likely to

252

say that reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection (p=0.003), 1.3 times more likely to say “we can attend

253

social and cultural activities” (p=0.003), 1.2 times more likely to say “children can start school again”

254

(p=0.003), 1.3 times more likely to say “reduction in COVID-19 related costs” (e.g. masks, hand

255

sanitizer, tests; p<0.001), 1.3 times more likely to say “employment and income opportunities will be

256

increased” (p<0.001), and 1.3 times more likely to say “attending prayers in congregation” (p<0.002)

257

were all reported advantages of getting a COVID-19 vaccine.

258

When asked about the negative consequences (disadvantages), Acceptors were 1.3 times more likely to

259

mention mild side effects of vaccination such as “weakness” (p<0.002) and 1.3 times more likely to say

260

“itching and skin problems” (p<0.001) were disadvantages of getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Meanwhile,

261

Non-acceptors were 1.6 times more likely (than Acceptors) to mention life-threatening side effects

13

262

(p<0.001), 1.5 times more likely to say “unknown/new diseases” (p<0.004), and 1.9 times more likely to

263

say “infertility” (p<0.001) were all disadvantages of getting a COVID-19 vaccine.

264

3.6 Perceived Action Efficacy:

265

Counter-intuitively, Acceptors were 1.3 times more likely to say they were “somewhat likely” to get

266

COVID-19 once they were vaccinated against it (p<0.001) while Non-acceptors were 2.8 times more

267

likely to say that they were “not likely at all” to get COVID-19 once one was vaccinated against it

268

(p<0.001) (Table 5). Focus group discussions may be used at a later point in time to explore this finding.

269

Related to perceived action efficacy, respondents were asked if they agreed or disagreed with the

270

statement “Most people will eventually get infected with COVID-19, so getting a COVID-19 vaccine is

271

unnecessary.” Non-acceptors were 1.7 times more likely to say that they “agree a little” or “agree a lot”

272

with the statement (p<0.001) while Acceptors were 1.5 times more likely to “disagree a lot” with the

273

statement (p<0.001).

274

3.7 Trust in COVID-19 vaccines:

275

As expected, trust in COVID-19 vaccines is a key driver of intended vaccine acceptance in Dhaka.

276

Acceptors were twice as likely to say that they trust the COVID-19 vaccines “a lot” or a “moderate

277

amount” (p<0.001). Conversely, Non-acceptors were 1.7 times more likely to say that they “trust them a

278

little” (p<0.001) and 2.3 times more likely to say that they “do not trust [COVID-19 vaccines] at all”

279

(p=0.001) (Table 6).

280

3.8 Perceived Severity (of COVID-19)

281

The perceived severity of COVID-19 was also highly correlated with intended vaccine acceptance.

282

Respondents were asked how serious it would be if they or someone else in their household got COVID-

283

19. Acceptors were 1.3 times more likely (than Non-acceptors) to say that it would be “very serious”

284

(p=0.001) (Table 6).

285

3.9 (Perceived) Access:

286

Perceived difficultly in reaching clinics that normally provide vaccines is associated with intended

287

COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Dhaka. Non-acceptors were 1.6 times more likely to say that it was

288

“very difficult” to get to the facility that normally provides vaccines (p=0.000), while Acceptors were 1.3

289

times more likely to say it was “somewhat difficult” to get to that facility (p=0.000) (Table 6).

290

3.10 Perceived Divine Will

291

Personal agency and religious beliefs often come into play with vaccine acceptance. In this study (Table

292

7), we asked for respondents’ degree of agreement or disagreement with the statement: “Whether I get

293

COVID-19 or not is purely a matter of God’s will or chance -- The actions I take will have little bearing

294

on whether or not I get COVID-19.” Personal agency was correlated with intended vaccine acceptance:

295

Acceptors were 1.2 times more likely to say that they “disagree a lot” (p=0.005) that “whether I get

296

COVID-19 or not is purely a matter of God's will or chance” (p<0.001). Respondents were also asked

297

whether they believed that Allah (or God or the gods) approves or disapproves of people getting COVID-

298

19 vaccines. While 80% of Acceptors and 78% of Non-acceptors said that a deity approves, there were no

299

statistically significant differences between Acceptors and Non-acceptors for this question.

300

3.11 Rumors/ Culture

301

Respondents were asked if there were any cultural or religious reasons that they would not get a COVID-

302

19 vaccine (results are in Table 7). Acceptors were 1.2 times more likely to say that there were no

303

cultural or religious reasons they would not get a COVID-19 vaccine (p=0.01), while Non-acceptors were

304

1.3 more likely to say that there were reasons (p=0.002). When asked what those reasons were, Non-

305

Acceptors were 1.6 more likely to say that they had heard that ‘the vaccines were made with pork fat

306

which is not allowed (haram) by Islam’ (p=0.001) and 1.4 times more likely to say that ‘vaccines were

307

made with haram ingredients’ (p=0.003). Respondents were also asked if they had seen or heard of

308

anything that would stop them or others from seeking to get a COVID-19 vaccine. If they said yes, they

309

were asked a follow-up question on what would stop them or others from seeking the vaccine. Regarding

310

that question, Acceptors were 1.3 more likely to say that producers' “hide and seek activities” related to

15

311

vaccine accuracy in the clinical testing would stop them or their peers from getting a COVID-19 vaccine

312

(p<0.002).

313

314

315

4. Discussion

316

This Barrier Analysis study on intended acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines revealed important

317

differences in responses and beliefs between Acceptors and Non-acceptors regarding behavioral

318

determinants of vaccine acceptance in this urban setting of Bangladesh. One important finding is that

319

even if one or two determinants or barriers are addressed, there are a multitude of important determinants

320

and barriers that may affect vaccine acceptance, and deserve attention. Access, for instance, was among

321

other determinants found to be important in our study in along with perceived social norms (75% of the

322

studies) and positive/negative consequences of the behavior (56%) (51).

323

The largest behavioral driver in this population, based on responses to questions on the 11 determinants

324

studied, was around perceived social norms. Perceived social norms, depending on the context, may

325

hinder or inspire one to get a vaccine (52). In this study, Acceptors were more likely (than Non-

326

acceptors) to say that most people they know and most of their close family and friends will get the

327

COVID-19 vaccine, that no one would disapprove of their getting a vaccine, and that they would be very

328

likely to get a vaccine if a doctor or nurse recommended it. Similarly, one systematic review showed

329

health care professionals are influential in promoting vaccinations (53). Acceptors were also more likely

330

to say that most of their community and religious leaders will want them to get a vaccine.

331

Other beliefs, for example safety and trust, about the vaccines themselves were important, as well (54,55).

332

In this study, Non-acceptors were much more likely to say that COVID-19 vaccines are “not safe at all”

333

and to say that they only “trust them a little.” Conversely, Acceptors were more likely to say that the

334

COVID-19 vaccines are “mostly safe” and to say that they trust them “a lot.”

335

In line with the Health Belief Model, beliefs about the disease itself were highly correlated with vaccine

336

acceptance (26). Acceptors were much more likely (than Non-acceptors) to say it was “very likely” that

337

someone in their household would get COVID-19 over the next three months and to be “very concerned”

338

about getting COVID-19. Conversely, Non-acceptors were much more likely to say that it would be only

339

“somewhat likely” that someone in their household would get COVID-19 and that “very few people”

340

have had COVID-19 in their community. In alignment with what Patrick et al (56) showed regarding

341

perceived risk as structural feature of vaccine decision, Acceptors of this study were also more likely to

342

believe that it would be “very serious” if someone in their household got COVID-19.

343

Perceived behavioral control (which is influenced by things that make it difficult or easy to perform the

344

behavior) also influence vaccine uptake (31). The barriers and enablers which were mentioned more often

345

by Acceptors provide clues as to ways to make it easier to boost acceptance. When asked what would

346

make it easier to get a COVID-19 vaccine, Acceptors were more likely (than Non-acceptors) to mention

347

providing vaccination through government health facilities, schools, and kiosks, and having vaccinators

348

maintain proper COVID-19 health & safety protocols. Responding to the question about what would

349

make it difficult to get a COVID-19 vaccine, Non-acceptors were much more likely say “when the

350

vaccine has severe side effects.” Personal agency also came into play: Acceptors were much more likely

351

to say that they disagreed a lot with the statement, “whether I get COVID-19 or not is purely a matter of

352

God’s will or chance – the actions I take will have little bearing on whether or not I get COVID-19.”

353

Aligned with other studies on vaccination uptake (57,58), the results of this study showed that perceived

354

effects of vaccines are a key factor in the vaccine decision. Acceptors named several positive

355

consequences of getting a COVID-19 vaccine more often than Non-acceptors including (1) reduced the

356

risk of Covid-19 infection, (2) being able to attend social and cultural activities, (3) children being able to

357

start school again, (4) reduction in COVID-19 related costs, (5) increased employment and income

358

opportunities, and (6) being able to attend prayers in a group setting. Conversely, Non-acceptors asked

359

about negative consequences of getting a COVID-19 vaccine were more likely to say (than Acceptors)

360

that (1) life-threatening side effects, (2) unknown / new diseases, and (3) infertility were all disadvantages

17

361

that they would expect if they were to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Surprisingly, Acceptors were 1.3 times

362

more likely to say they were “somewhat likely” to get COVID-19 once they were vaccinated against it

363

(p<0.001) while Non-acceptors were 2.8 times more likely to say that they were “not likely at all” to get

364

COVID-19 if they were vaccinated.

365

Lastly, Non-acceptors were more likely to hold beliefs about herd immunity that could reduce acceptance,

366

saying that they agree a little or a lot with the statement that “most people will eventually get infected

367

with COVID-19, so getting a COVID-19 vaccine is unnecessary.”

368

Implications for Behavior Change Interventions

369

Aligned with WHO’s Technical Advisory Group on Behavioral Insights and Sciences for Health

370

recommendation on social and behavioral drivers on COVID-19 vaccination (33), our study identified

371

important beliefs and responses associated with different determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance

372

among urban population in Bangladesh which could be valuable to informing contextualized behavioral

373

intervention and engagement strategies to support COVID-19 vaccination. For example, to increase

374

perceived positive social norms, especially for those who found to be important influencers of this

375

behavior (e.g., medical staff and mothers), videotaping individuals giving testimonials in each

376

neighborhood on why they plan to get the vaccine, and distributing them over media is one possible

377

approach. Other activities can be used to make acceptance more visible (e.g., stickers on households that

378

say, “We plan to vaccinate!” or lapel pins with the same message). To increase the perception that

379

COVID-19 is serious (to address perceived severity), testimonials by people who have lost or almost lost

380

family members due to COVID-19 disease could be used. To address perceived divine will, religious

381

leaders can be assisted in creating sermon outlines on maintaining one’s health (and linking that with

382

COVID-19 vaccines), and supported in creating radio spots to promote COVID-19 vaccines. In addition

383

to the COVID-19 prevention, other positive consequences of immunization mentioned by Acceptors

384

should be disseminated. While not repeating any misinformation, it will be important to provide clear

385

information on the known minor risks of COVID-19 vaccination as a way to combat misinformation on

18

386

side effects that were mentioned more often by Non-acceptors (e.g., life-threatening conditions, new

387

diseases, infertility). Information on how vaccines are made should be disseminated to counter

388

misinformation (e.g., that vaccines are made with pork fat or other haram ingredients). Stakeholders

389

should also take into account the findings on things that may make vaccination easier for people, such as

390

providing the vaccine in schools and kiosks (in addition to government health facilities) and to assure that

391

the population understands that proper COVID-19 health and safety protocols will be maintained in

392

places where vaccines are given.

393

Limitations of the Study

394

This study has a number of limitations. First, given that this study was only done in a limited urban area,

395

the results should not be generalized to the rest of Bangladesh or other countries. Second, by design (as a

396

means to make the analysis easier for practitioners and the method replicable by more practitioners), the

397

BA approach does not consider respondents’ socio-economic information including level of income,

398

living conditions, or other factors which may lead to some confounding or interaction of variables.

399

Finally, while many studies these days recognize that there is a spectrum of acceptance between those

400

who accept, those who are undecided or hesitant, and those who refuse, for the purposes of this study and

401

for ease of analysis, we defined vaccine acceptance in a binary way

402

Conclusion

403

This BA study revealed a host of important behavioral determinants associated with intended COVID-19

404

vaccine acceptance among the study population in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Particularly, social norms, beliefs

405

on safety and trust about the vaccines, perceived risk of getting COVID-19, perceived severity, perceived

406

action efficacy and behavioral control. The responses were significantly varied between Acceptors and

407

Non-acceptors which urges to address these behavioral drivers. The study also revealed some important

408

beliefs on the positive consequences from both Acceptors and Non-acceptors, which could be used in

409

developing behavior change messages. The results from the present study suggest that an integrated

behavior change strategy needs to be incorporated into existing COVID-19 vaccination plans to increase

the uptake.
