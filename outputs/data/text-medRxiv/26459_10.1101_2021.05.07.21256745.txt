Abstract
Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the ensuing COVID-19
pandemic present significant challenges to current diagnostic and therapeutic patient care pathways including
whether new in vitro diagnostic tests can accurately identify and rule out current SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The gold standard diagnostic test to identify a current SARS-CoV-2 infection is a central laboratory-based
molecular assay using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with very high accuracy of
detection but which typically requires 1-2 days turn-around for results. Therefore, rapid RTPCR assays and
systems have been developed which can be deployed locally (near-patient or point of care (POC), provide faster
results and not impact on already stressed central laboratory capacity. Rapid test results can be returned within

the same clinical encounter, facilitating timely decisions that optimise the patient care pathway and support more
rapid COVID-19 diagnosis, isolation and contract tracing activities1.
Direct-to-PCR is an evolution of RT-PCR in which the patient sample is added directly to an amplification
reaction without being subjected to prior nucleic acid extraction, purification, or quantification to reduce the time
and monetary resources required to process samples.1 Rapid, direct-to-PCR systems further increase the speed of
testing by combining rapid PCR instruments with direct-to-PCR assays, to generate results in less than two hours.
This appears to be the first meta-analysis assessing the accuracy of rapid direct-to-PCR in the detection of SARSCoV-2. In total, 10,957 unique records were identified and screened using a search string evaluation, 420 full-text
reports and/or supplemental materials were assessed for inclusion. This resulted in 14 studies reporting 20 datasets
with 4593 patient samples (1391 positive) included in the analysis.

The overall agreement between the rapid direct RT-PCR and gold standard centralised laboratory RT-PCR was
97.1% with 93.60% positive percent agreement and 98.63% negative percent agreement. The Cohen’s kappa
statistical coefficient k = 0.93, indicating an almost perfect agreement and Youden Index = 0.92. These results
indicate that direct-to-PCR assays can perform equivalently to the standard centralised laboratory PCR systems
for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.

Objectives
To assess the efficacy of rapid direct-to-PCR assays and systems for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital,
care home and medical research population in England from November 2020 to April 2021.

Search methods
Electronic searches of the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (which includes daily updates from PubMed and
Embase and preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv) were undertaken on the 30th of April 2020. Please see the
PRISMA flow diagram below (figure 2).

Selection criteria
Studies of subjects with either suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, known SARS-CoV-2 infection or known
absence of infection, or those who were being screened for infection were included. Commercially available and
research use rapid direct-to-PCR assays (without RNA extraction and purification reporting results within two
hours) were included in the study.

Data collection, extraction and analysis
Studies were screened independently, in duplicate with any disagreements resolved by discussion with a third
author. Study characteristics were extracted by one author and checked by a second; extraction of study results
and assessments of risk of bias and applicability were undertaken independently in duplicate.
Where studies were not publicly available, sites that undertook in-service evaluations of rapid direct-to-PCR
system were contacted and asked to supply anonymised datasets. Both reviewers independently performed data
extraction and verification and calculated 2x2 contingency tables of the number of true positives, false positives,
false negatives and true negatives. They resolved any disagreements by discussion and by review with the third
reviewer.

Main results
Twenty study cohorts were included (described in 14 study reports, including 4 unpublished reports), reporting
results for 4593 samples (1391 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2). Studies were mainly from Europe and North
America, and evaluated nine direct-to-PCR assays.

Conclusions
This appears to be the first meta-analysis assessing the accuracy of rapid direct-to-PCR in the detection of SARSCoV-2. In total, 10,957 unique records were identified and screened using a search string evaluation, 420 full-text
reports and/or supplemental materials were assessed for inclusion. This resulted in 14 studies reporting 20 datasets

with 4593 patient samples (1391 positive) included in the analysis.
The overall agreement between the rapid direct RT-PCR and gold standard centralised laboratory RT-PCR was
97.10% with 93.60% positive percent agreement and 98.63% negative percent agreement. The Cohen’s kappa
statistical coefficient k = 0.93, indicating an almost perfect agreement and Youden Index = 0.92. These results
show that direct-to-PCR assay perform equivalently to the gold standard centralised laboratory RT-PCR systems
for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.

Plain language summary
What is a rapid direct-to-PCR tests for diagnosing COVID-19?
Rapid direct-to-PCR tests are rapid tests that aim to confirm or rule out the presence of SARS-CoV-2 within 2
hours without complicated processing of the sample.

How accurate is a rapid direct-to-PCR tests for diagnosing COVID-19?
We compared the accuracy of rapid direct-to-PCR tests with gold standard centralised laboratory RT-PCR for the
detection of SARS-CoV-2 and found that direct-to-PCR was as accurate as standard RT-PCR assays.

Why is this question important?
People with suspected COVID-19 need to know quickly whether they are infected, so that they can self-isolate,
inform close contacts and possibly receive treatment. Currently, COVID-19 infection is confirmed by a laboratory

test called RT-PCR, which uses specialist equipment and often takes at least 24 hours to produce a result. If they

are accurate, faster diagnosis could allow people to take appropriate action more rapidly, with the potential to
reduce the spread of COVID-19.1

What did we aim to find out?
Our goal was to determine if commercially available and research use rapid direct-to-PCR tests are accurate
enough to detect SARS-CoV-2 compared to gold standard laboratory RT-PCR.

What did we do?
We looked for studies that measured the accuracy of any commercially produced and research use rapid direct-

to-PCR tests, in people tested for COVID-19 using RT-PCR. People could be tested in hospital or in the
community. Studies could test people with or without symptoms.
Tests had to use minimal equipment, be performed safely without risking infection from the sample, and have
results available within two hours of the sample being collected.

What we found?
We included 420 studies in the review. They investigated a total of 4593 nose or throat samples; COVID-19 was
confirmed in 1391 of these samples. The studies investigated nine different direct-to-PCR tests. They took place
mainly in Europe and North America.

What did we find?
Although overall results for diagnosing and ruling out COVID-19 were good (93% of infections correctly
diagnosed and 99% correctly ruled out), we noted a difference in COVID-19 detection between tests, but we
cannot be certain about whether results will remain the same in a real-world setting. We could not investigate
differences in people with or without symptoms, nor time from symptom onset because the studies did not provide
enough clinical information about their participants.

How reliable were the results of the studies?
In general, the studies included followed rigorous methods in accordance with the tests intended use to detect
COVID-19 and included at least two independent results to confirm or rule out COVID-19 infection. The results

from different test brands varied and few studies compared multiple rapid-PCR tests. Most of the studies did not
provide sufficient information to determine whether the detection levels would vary in people with COVID-19
symptoms versus without symptoms.

What does this mean?
On average the rapid direct-to-PCR were shown to be equivalent to gold standard laboratory-based RT-PCR tests
and several direct-to-PCR tests show very high accuracy. However, for most of the tests, more evidence is needed
particularly in people without symptoms, on the accuracy of repeated testing, testing in non-healthcare settings
such as schools (including self-testing),

Background
Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the ensuing COVID-19
pandemic present significant challenges diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. These range from: understanding
the value of signs and symptoms in predicting possible infection; assessing whether existing biochemical and
imaging tests can identify infection or people needing critical care; and evaluating whether in vitro diagnostic
tests can accurately identify and rule out current SARS-CoV-2 infection, and identify those with past infection,
with or without immunity.1
The standard diagnostic test to identify a SARS-CoV-2 infection is a central laboratory-based molecular assay

using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
Direct-to-PCR is an evolution of PCR in which a sample is added directly to an amplification reaction without
being subjected to prior nucleic acid extraction, purification, or quantification. It allows for maximum source
quantities of RNA to be targeted, minimises opportunities for error and contamination, and may be less expensive,
provide results more quickly and not require the same laboratory capacity, avoiding the need for centralised testing
facilities.
Rapid direct-to-PCR systems further increase the speed of testing by combining rapid-PCR instruments with faster
cycling times and data analysis with direct-to-PCR assays to generate results <2 hours.
If sufficiently accurate, rapid tests returned within the same clinical encounter can facilitate the timely decisions
concerning the need for isolation and contract tracing activities1 and to facilitate novel patient care pathways for

the rapid diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, and supporting infection prevention and control.

Description of the condition
COVID-19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The target condition for this metaanalysis is current SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosed by a positive RT-PCR detection of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

Description of the test
Direct-to-PCR is an evolution of RT-PCR in which a sample is added directly to an amplification reaction without
being subjected to prior nucleic acid extraction, purification, or quantification. It allows for maximum quantities
of source RNA to be targeted, minimises opportunities for error and contamination, and reduces the time and
monetary resources required to process samples. Rapid direct-to-PCR systems further increase the speed of testing
by combining rapid-PCR instruments with faster cycling times and data analysis with direct-to-PCR assays,
generating results in <2 hours.

Index test(s)
The primary consideration for the eligibility of tests for inclusion in this review is that they were aimed at the
detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in samples without being subjected to prior nucleic acid extraction,
purification, or quantification and with results in <2 hours.

Clinical pathway
Patients may be tested for SARS-CoV-2 when they present with symptoms, have had known exposure to a
confirmed case, or are part of a screening program, with no definite known exposure to SARS-CoV-2. The
standard approach to diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is through laboratory-based testing of swab samples
taken from the upper respiratory (e.g., nasopharynx, oropharynx) or lower respiratory tract (e.g., bronchoalveolar
lavage or sputum) with RT-PCR.1

Rationale
It is essential to understand the clinical accuracy of tests and clinical features to identify the best way they can be

used in different settings to develop effective diagnostic and management pathways for SARS-CoV-2 infection
and disease. Estimates of accuracy from these reviews will help inform diagnosis, screening, isolation, and patientmanagement decisions.1

Objectives
To assess the efficacy of rapid direct-to-PCR systems for the qualitative diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital,
care home and medical research population in England from November 2020 to April 2021.

Methods
Criteria for considering studies for this review
Methods
The review was conducted following the Cochrane Rapid Review process and workflow (v.4) and we have
referenced and followed the approach of the 2021 Cochrane Rapid, point-of-care antigen and molecular-based
tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection review1. We conducted the preliminary literature search for existing
or ongoing systematic reviews using the Cochrane Library and estimated review feasibility. The protocol was
drafted, and a team of systematic review authors screened the titles and abstracts of all records retrieved from the
literature searches following the search string optimisation described in the appendix. Two review authors
independently screened studies and a third, senior review author resolved any disagreements. We tagged all

records selected and obtained the full texts for all studies flagged as potentially eligible. Two review authors
independently screened the full texts, and we resolved any disagreements on study inclusion through discussion
with a third review author.

Assessment of Risk of Bias
The authors assessed and discussed the risk of bias and applicability concerns using the RoB 2.0 algorithm tailored
to this review2, and concluded that the categorization ‘some concerns’ was appropriate (Figure 1 below).

Statistical analysis and data synthesis
We analysed rapid direct-to-PCR assays and computed estimates by summing the counts of TP, FP, FN and TN
across 2x2 tables and verifying the supplemental information in publications or source data for the unpublished
studies. We made comparisons between analyses using the rapid direct-to-PCR assay and standard centralized lab
assay. Any discrepant results were adjudicated using a 3rd reference assay.

Assessment of reporting bias

We made no formal assessment of reporting bias but have indicated where we were aware that study results were
available but unpublished.

Duration
The Minimum study duration was 1 month, and the target population encompassed symptomatic and
asymptomatic residents and staff in care homes, patients in hospitals, healthcare workers and medical researchers.

Intervention
Paired nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal or nasal patient swabs were collected. One swab from each pair was
analysed using the rapid direct-to-PCR system and the other swab was tested using the gold standard centralised

The overall agreement between the rapid direct PCR and standard centralised laboratory PCR was 97.1% with
93.60% positive percent agreement and 98.63% negative percent agreement. The Cohen’s kappa statistical
coefficient k = 0.93, indicating an almost perfect agreement and Youden Index = 0.92. These results show that
direct-to-PCR assays perform equivalently to the standard centralised laboratory PCR systems for the diagnosis
of SARS-CoV-2.

Discussion
Summary of main findings

Rapid direct-to-PCR systems further aim to reduce the speed of testing by combining rapid-PCR instruments with
direct-to-PCR assays, to generate results in <2 hours. If sufficiently accurate, rapid tests returned within the same
clinical encounter can facilitate timely decisions concerning the need for isolation and contract tracing activities1
and create novel patient care pathways for the rapid diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19,and support infection

prevention and control.
[Background and here]
This appears to be the first meta-analysis assessing the accuracy of rapid direct-to-PCR in the detection of SARSCoV-2 and is the first iteration of this living review and will be updated in 3-6 months. In this meta-analysis
10,957 unique records were identified and screened using a search string evaluation, 420 full-text reports and/or
supplemental materials were assessed for inclusion. This resulted in 14 studies reporting 20 data-sets with 4593
patient samples (1391 positive) included in the analysis.
Through this analysis, several potential sources of heterogeneity in the comparative evaluation methodology,
whereby a new RT-PCR assay is compared with a reference RT-PCR assay were identified. Firstly, the direct-toPCR reaction involves a dilution step whereas the more traditional RT-PCR involves a concentration step. In the
dilution step, the quantity of nucleic acid in the sample is diluted potentially increases the likelihood of a false
negative result. Conversely for the same viral load in an extracted PCR reaction, the concentration step
concentrates or enriches the quantity of RNA potentially. Therefore, this could present a significant source of
systematic bias. Furthermore, comparing assays with different gene targets adds another fundamental source of
bias because detection of sub-genomic RNA may not be a suitable indicator of active replication/infection. Subgenomic was found to have accumulated and remain detectable 17 days after infection.15 Therefore, the
comparison of an assay that detects genomic RNA (ORF1ab) versus an assay detecting sub-genomic RNA (Egene) may introduce a further systematic bias.
Nevertheless, overall agreement between the rapid direct PCR and standard centralised laboratory PCR was 97.1%

with 93.60% positive percent agreement and 98.63% negative percent agreement. The Cohen’s kappa statistical
coefficient k = 0.93, indicating an almost perfect agreement and Youden Index = 0.92. These results show that
direct-to-PCR assays perform equivalently to the gold standard centralised laboratory PCR systems for the
diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2.

Authors ’conclusions
This meta-analysis of the accuracy of rapid direct PCR for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 included fourteen reports
encompassing 21 datasets with a total of 3348 patient samples (1007 positive). The overall agreement between
the rapid direct PCR and standard centralised laboratory PCR was 97.1% with 93.60% positive percent agreement

and 98.63% negative percent agreement. The Cohen’s kappa statistical coefficient k = 0.93, indicating an almost
perfect agreement and Youden Index = 0.92. These results show that direct-to-PCR assays perform equivalently
