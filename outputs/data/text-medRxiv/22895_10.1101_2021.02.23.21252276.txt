Abstract

24

Background: The restructuring of healthcare systems to cope with the demands of the COVID-19

25

pandemic has led to a reduction in clinical services such as cancer screening and diagnostics.

26

Methods: Data from the four Northern Ireland pathology labs was used to assess trends in pathological

27

cancer diagnoses from 1st March to 12th September 2020 overall and by cancer site, gender and age.

28

These trends were compared to the same timeframe from 2017-2019.

29

Results: Between 1st March and 12th September 2020 there was a 23% reduction in cancer diagnoses

30

compared to the same time period in the preceding three years. Although some recovery occurred in

31

August and September 2020, this revealed inequalities across certain patient groups. Pathological

32

diagnoses of lung, prostate and gynaecological malignancies remained well below pre-pandemic

33

levels. Males and younger/middle-aged adults, particularly the 50-59 year old patient group, also

34

lagged behind other population demographic groups in terms of returning to expected numbers of

35

pathological cancer diagnoses.

36

Conclusions: There is a critical need to protect cancer diagnostic services in the ongoing pandemic to

37

facilitate timely investigation of potential cancer cases. Targeted public health campaigns may be

38

needed to reduce emerging inequalities in cancer diagnoses as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.

41

Background

42

The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented global challenge that has had profound effects on

43

healthcare systems. The rapid transformation of clinical services across the world, such as the opening

44

of Nightingale Hospitals in the UK, has required a significant effort from healthcare personnel and

45

governments. The redeployment of staff and resources directed towards managing COVID-19 has had

46

a significant impact on provision of routine medical care, with many such services being reduced or

47

cancelled.

48

Screening for breast, cervical and colorectal cancer was paused across the UK, and in Northern Ireland

49

this occurred from the second week of March 2020 for 4 months.(1) Furthermore, emergency

50

department attendances also dropped by approximately 30% in March 2020 compared to March

51

2019,(2) illustrating a reduction in health seeking behaviour by the general public. In addition, a

52

national shift to remote clinics and telephone consultations has reduced face-to-face time between

53

patients and healthcare professionals.(3) A national lockdown was instigated from the 23rd March,

54

accompanied by various levels of public restrictions, and public health messaging about protecting the

55

NHS has been prominent in the UK throughout 2020. All of these factors have implications for cancer

56

care, where early diagnosis and timely treatment are essential in improving outcomes.

57

Attention is now broadening from the acute concern of COVID-19, to recognition of the collateral

58

damage and excess deaths from other causes that may be a consequence of the necessary changes to

59

healthcare systems as a result of the virus. Of major concern are the delays in cancer diagnoses.

60

Predicted trends of later stage at diagnosis of cancer are likely to lead to poorer outcomes for patients,

61

thus reversing years of progress in improving cancer survival.(4) Two modelling studies have estimated

62

the number of cancer deaths as a result of delays in diagnosis during the COVID-19 pandemic in

63

England. One study investigated breast, lung, colorectal and oesophageal cancer diagnosis via urgent

64

and emergency care pathways, and estimated 3291-3621 additional deaths in England over the next

65

five years from these cancers.(5) Another study specifically assessed the effect of delays in the two

66

week wait referral pathway for the 20 most common types of cancer. It was estimated that 181-542

67

additional lives would be lost as a result of a delay in presentation.(6) Whilst figures from these studies

68

differ due to variation in methodology and cancer sites studied, the estimated loss of life from cancer

69

resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic based on these models is considerable.

70

Provisional data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry found the number of cancer cases dropped by

71

9-27% per week from the 24th February to 12th April 2020 compared to the pre-pandemic period.(7) A

72

subsequent modelling study estimated the effect of suspending colorectal and breast cancer screening

73

programmes in the Netherlands during the initial stages of the pandemic. They found a reduction in

74

observed breast and colorectal cancer diagnoses in the population as a whole, but particularly in the

75

screening age groups, with recovery to expected levels by late June 2020.(8) In contrast to this, a Korean

76

study of lung cancer cases in three hospitals found that the number of lung cancer diagnoses from

77

February to June 2020 did not differ significantly from the previous 3 years.(9) Finally, a Danish study

78

investigating all-cause mortality rates (including cancer mortality) from 1st January through to 5th July

79

2020 found that there was no excess mortality as a result of COVID-19 or the resulting lockdown in

80

Denmark.(10) This is in contrast to several other European countries, including the UK, which had shown

81

excess all-cause mortality by May 2020.(11)

82

Given the findings of modelling studies(5, 6) and limited data published to date, there remains an urgent

83

need to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on cancer diagnoses using real-world data. The aim of this

84

study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on pathological diagnoses of cancer using data collated

85

by the population-based Northern Ireland Cancer Registry (NICR). A secondary aim was to evaluate

86

potential inequalities in the pathological cancer diagnosis trends observed by subgroups of cancer

87

type, patient age, sex and for screen-detected cancer.

88

Methods

89

The NICR is a population-based register covering approximately 1.8 million people, and has collected

90

information on all patients diagnosed with cancer in Northern Ireland since 1993. The NICR is the

91

officially recognised provider of cancer statistics for Northern Ireland, and the high quality of the NICR

92

data, including its validity and completeness have been previously reported.(12) Ethical approval for

93

the NICR databases (including the waiving of requirement for individual patient consent) and for data

94

analysis has been granted by the Office for Research Ethics Committees of Northern Ireland (ORECNI

95

reference 15/NI/0203), recently renewed in October 2020 (ORECNI reference 20-NI-0132).

96

Data from the four NHS pathology laboratories in Northern Ireland are usually provided to the NICR

97

on a monthly basis. These data were used to compile a summary of trends in the number of patients

98

with pathology samples indicating cancer, from 1st March to 12th September 2020 during the COVID-

99

19 pandemic. This time period reflects both the temporary suspension of breast, colorectal and

100

cervical screening programmes, which were paused for four months from March 2020, as well as

101

referral pathways for symptomatic patients. Data was recorded using the number of pathology

102

samples indicating cancer. In the instance of an individual having more than one pathology sample,

103

patients were only included once per cancer type unless they have had pathology samples separated

104

by more than two years. The NICR produces monthly reports of these trends, which are available

105

online.(13) The methodology used in this study differs from usual NICR registration practices which

106

collects information electronically from a number of sources including the Pathology Laboratory

107

System alongside the hospital Patient Administration System, multidisciplinary team meeting system,

108

Death Certificates and Radiology Systems.

109

Statistical analysis

110

Descriptive statistics (frequencies and proportions over time) are presented for the number of

111

patients diagnosed with cancer, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, in Northern Ireland between

112

1st March and 12th September 2020. Comparisons were made to the same week range for 2017-2019,

113

for which a three year average was estimated. Data during the most recent five weeks for which data

114

was available, from 9th August to 12th September 2020, was also evaluated separately to assess for any

115

signs of recovery in pathological cancer diagnoses. Subgroup analysis was conducted by age, sex and

116

cancer site, including screen-detected cancers. For analysis by age category, we have restricted the

117

data to adults aged 18 years and older. The monthly trend in patients diagnosed pathologically from

118

2017 to 2019 was used to estimate the number of patients that would normally be expected to have

119

a pathology sample indicating cancer during March-August 2020. An estimate of the number of

122

Results

123

During the time period from 1st March through to 12th September 2020, there were 3,561 pathology

124

samples indicating a cancer diagnosis in people of all ages in Northern Ireland. During the same time

125

period in 2017-2019 there were, in each year, an average number of 4,607 pathology samples

126

indicating a cancer diagnosis. This corresponds to a 22.7% reduction in cancer cases diagnosed during

127

the six month peak period of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Ireland. Based on

128

monthly trends, there was an estimated absolute shortfall of 1,130 patients during March to August

129

2020 inclusive, compared to the same period for 2017-2019 (Figure 1). In April 2020, new cancer

130

diagnoses reached their lowest point during the pandemic, with a decrease of 45.2%, but some signs

131

of recovery were evident by June 2020.

132

Analysis by cancer site

133

The distribution of cancer diagnoses by site is shown in Figure 2. The number of diagnoses across all

134

cancer sites was reduced during the overall period from 1st March to 12th September 2020 compared

135

to the same time period in the preceding three years. However, in August and September, there were

136

signs of recovery in the number of diagnoses across several cancer sites, with colorectal cancer, breast

137

cancer and haematological malignancies showing a 12%, 6% and 30% increase respectively compared

138

to previous years. Of concern though, lung, prostate and gynaecological cancer diagnoses remained

139

considerably lower than expected during this most recent five week time frame, at 21%, 10% and 18%

140

respectively below expected numbers of pathological diagnoses.

141

Analysis by screen-detected colorectal and breast cancers

142

Trends for colorectal cancer and breast cancer for the general population and for the screening age

143

population (60-74 years for colorectal cancer and 50-70 years for breast cancer) are shown in Figure

144

3. The number of colorectal cancer diagnoses was reduced for all ages and for the screening age

145

population during the overall six month period studied compared to previous years. From 9th August

146

to 12th September 2020 the total number of colorectal cancer diagnoses increased by 12%, compared

147

to previous years, indicating some recovery for the population as a whole. However, in the screening

148

age population, the number of diagnoses remained significantly reduced, by 18% lower than previous

149

years. The number of breast cancer diagnoses was reduced for both the general and screening age

150

population during the overall six month period studied in 2020 compared to previous years. In the

151

more recent five week period studied however, recovery was evident in both groups, with an increase

152

of 6% overall and 14% in the screening age group, in the number of breast cancer cases compared to

153

previous years.

154

Analysis by age and sex

155

Both sexes were relatively equally affected overall, with a 22% and 23% reduction in cancer diagnoses

156

in males and females during the overall pandemic time period (Figure 4). However, when studying the

157

most recent five week time period from 9th August to 12th September 2020, males lagged somewhat

158

behind females, with observed 8% and 2% lower numbers of pathological cancer diagnoses,

159

respectively.

160

The number of cancer diagnoses across age categories recorded from 1st March to 12th September

161

2020 is shown in Figure 5A. The largest proportional decrease in pathology samples indicating cancer

162

was in the 50-59 years old age group, in which cancer cases reduced by 27.4% in 2020 compared to

163

previous years. The number of cancer diagnoses per month by age category are shown in Figures 5B-

164

F, both during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 and the average number per month

165

from 2017-2019 for comparison. Some recovery is shown over the summer months, although not to

166

pre-pandemic levels in any age group. While the relative decrease in cancer diagnoses was greatest

167

for the 50-59 years age group, the absolute decrease in the number of cancer cases was greatest in

168

the 70-79 years age group (275 cases) followed by the 60-69 years age group (229 cases) and the 50-

169

59 years group (217 cases).

Discussion

171

Our data demonstrate the considerable effect that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on reducing the

172

number of people being pathologically diagnosed with cancer in Northern Ireland. We were able to

173

quantify this as a 23% drop in expected pathological cancer diagnoses in Northern Ireland during the

174

first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic taking hold in the UK, translating to 1,130 ‘missed’ cancer

175

patients over this time period.

176

Likely causation is complex, with factors involving patients, primary care and secondary care all

177

contributing. Some cases are likely due to failure by the patient to report concerning symptoms for

178

investigation. Failure to engage with the healthcare system may reflect patient fear regarding

179

contracting COVID-19, or an effort on their part to “protect the NHS”, given national guidance to this

180

effect, or limited ability to use telephone consultations.(3, 14) Primary care has seen a shift away from

181

face-to-face consultations towards telephone consultations,(15) which may have led to missed

182

detection of concerning symptoms or signs, or to a delay in appropriate diagnostic investigations such

183

as radiology or endoscopy. In secondary care the capacity for diagnostic investigations has been

184

limited by COVID-19, both in terms of resources and staffing levels, as well as the need for infection

185

control precautions.(16) Staff absence due to illness or self-isolation is likely to also be a contributing

186

factor in both primary and secondary care, reducing the number of patient assessments able to be

187

carried out. It should be noted that a proportion of these ‘missed’ patients may have been diagnosed

188

clinically instead of pathologically (for example, as a result of an emergency admission to hospital)

189

and, if their subsequent treatment did not generate a diagnostic pathology specimen, such cases will

190

be excluded from the data presented. However, these cases are likely to be a small number of the

191

total.

192

Some recovery in cancer diagnoses has occurred during the 2020 summer months, but this has

193

revealed important inequalities in recovery across cancer sites and population groups. In the more

194

recent time period studied, some recovery in pathological cancer diagnoses was observed across most

195

cancer sites. However, lung, gynaecological and prostate cancers continue to lag behind the expected

196

number of pathological diagnoses in 2020 compared to the preceding three years. The reasons behind

197

this are unclear, and are likely multifactorial. Most concerningly, reduced lung cancer diagnoses may

198

reflect an overlap and confusion with COVID-19 symptoms, and ‘stay at home’ advice for individuals

199

with persistent coughs, rather than referral for radiological investigation. In addition, a nationwide

200

survey of endoscopy units in Germany in April 2020 revealed that two thirds of units had cancelled at

201

least 20% of scheduled bronchoscopy procedures.(17)

202

procedure which carries a risk of transmitting COVID-19 infection. The British Thoracic Society has

Bronchoscopy is an aerosol-generating

203

made recommendations to mitigate this, which includes triage guidelines for patients, comprising

204

symptom enquiry and COVID-19 testing, along with personal protective equipment for healthcare

205

professionals,(18) both of which could contribute to lower numbers of bronchoscopies being done.

206

Little data exist on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on specific cancer sites to date. A hospital-

207

based case series from South Korea reported that the number of lung cancer cases diagnosed from

208

February to June 2020 did not differ significantly from the previous three years.(9) However, this study

209

did also report that the number of stage III-IV non-small-cell lung cancer cases was significantly higher

210

in 2020 compared to previous years (74.7% compared to 57.9-66.7% in 2017-19).(9) Unfortunately we

211

do not have staging information for the cancer data presented in this article as yet, but a shift in

212

distribution to later stage at presentation is likely to be seen for cancer patients in the coming months

213

and years. There is limited generalisability between the UK and South Korea in terms of experience

214

during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, it is concerning and predicted that these ‘missed’ cancer

215

patients are likely to present with a more advanced cancer, and therefore have poorer outcomes, at

216

some point in the future.

217

The increased number of breast cancer diagnoses from 9th August to 12th September 2020 for the

218

whole population, and in those of screening age, suggests the successful resumption of cancer

219

screening is contributing to the observed recovery in numbers of cancer diagnoses. In contrast to

220

investigation of other cancers, such as lung cancer, diagnosis of breast cancer does not require an

221

aerosol-generating procedure and personal protective equipment, therefore capacity for breast

222

cancer investigations is likely to be nearer normal pre-pandemic levels. These results are in keeping

223

with trends in the Netherlands, which showed a steep decline in breast cancer cases during the initial

224

stages of the pandemic, with the screening age population more affected than women of non-

225

screening age.(8) However, in the Netherlands the non-screening age group recovered more quickly to

226

expected levels, whereas our results suggest a more rapid recovery in the screening age group.

227

In contrast to breast cancer screening which resumed in mid-July 2020, colorectal cancer screening

228

invitations did not resume in Northern Ireland until mid-August 2020. Furthermore, the colorectal

229

cancer screening pathway involves the secondary step of colonoscopy prior to cancer diagnosis and

230

cessation of non-urgent endoscopy at the height of the pandemic generated a significant and ongoing

231

backlog of individuals awaiting screening colonoscopy. Therefore recovery of diagnoses in screen-

232

detected colorectal cancers is not yet evident within the timeframe of this study.

233

Pathological cancer diagnoses in males have shown less recovery than females in recent weeks. This

234

finding is in keeping with prostate cancer diagnoses lagging behind some other cancer sites. While all

235

age groups have been affected, the reduction in cancer cases varied from -18.8% to -27.4%, with the

236

worst affected group being the 50-59 year age group. Two UK-based studies of adults aged 50 years

237

and older found that women were more likely than men to consult their GP regarding symptoms

238

possibly indicative of cancer,(19) and that people of an older age (aged 60-69 compared to the youngest

239

age group) were more likely to have sought help for cancer ‘alarm’ symptoms.(20) Our findings are in

240

keeping with this. However, how interactions with healthcare providers during the COVID-19

241

pandemic vary across gender and age categories remains mostly unknown. The reasons for observed

242

disparities in gender and age require evaluation in other population settings to understand if these

243

trends are occurring elsewhere. Targeted public health campaigns may be required to reduce such

244

inequalities as the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to grow across the UK and

245

internationally.

246

Health professionals recognise the need to rebuild and protect cancer services during the ongoing

247

COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the areas of diagnostic procedures and surgery.(21) Communicating

248

key messages to the public around awareness of cancer symptoms and uptake of screening invitations

249

is of utmost importance, along with emphasis on seeking medical attention if required. An example of

250

this is the NHS “Open for business” campaign run by Public Health England earlier this year.(22) Social

251

media has the potential to be effective in cancer prevention(23) and could be employed for public

252

health messaging, particularly for younger adults. Communication directed at older age groups could

253

comprise more traditional media channels, but given the unique challenges regarding health

254

communication globally in 2020,(24) the optimal mode of campaigning remains to be determined.

255

A key strength of this study is its population coverage. The NICR was able to mobilise and alter their

256

working practices in the initial stages of the pandemic, to retrieve rapid data on pathological cancer

257

diagnoses in order to assess the impact of COVID-19 across the region. Limitations include basing our

258

data on pathology diagnoses rather than following usual cancer registration methods, and thus have

259

not been as rigorously validated. Further pathology samples taken during January to September 2020

260

may not yet have been recorded if a result was not available by the end of September 2020. Therefore,

261

the presented figures may represent an underestimation, particularly for later weeks. However, the

262

data for 2017-2019 was also based on pathological samples indicating cancer, in order to provide

263

consistency and to attempt to control for solely clinical diagnoses. The interpretation of the trends

264

observed in the most recent 5 week time period studied, the 9th August to the 12th September, should

265

be interpreted with caution given the instability of health services and rapid changes in restrictions

266

seen during the pandemic so far, as numbers may change on a monthly basis. Prior to the submission

267

of this article, we obtained a brief update for the 5 week period from 6th September to 10th October

268

2020, which showed that while lung and prostate cancer diagnoses remained 30% and 19% below the

269

level of previous years, diagnoses of gynaecological cancers appeared to have recovered to near

270

expected levels. In addition, some cancer sites such as melanoma, head & neck and upper GI cancers

271

have seen the numbers of diagnoses reduce by 37%, 27% and 23% respectively, despite showing

272

recovery in the previous 5 week period studied. This illustrates the unpredictable nature of cancer

273

diagnostics during an international pandemic, the need for ongoing data collection, and the realisation

274

that the impact of COVID-19 won’t be fully understood until several more months, if not years, have

275

passed. Nevertheless, the need for timely understanding of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on

276

cancer diagnoses has required such approaches to be undertaken.

277

In summary, this population-based study has quantified the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on

278

reducing by 23% the number of cancer diagnoses during the first six months of the pandemic in a UK

279

region. There are emerging inequalities by cancer site and population subgroups in cancer diagnoses

280

which require further investigation to optimise recovery pathways. Additional variables, such as

281

socioeconomic status, may also be contributing to the observed inequalities, and could be included in

282

future research. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, measures to mitigate the impact on cancer

283

diagnoses must be taken in the areas of public education and awareness campaigns, rapid access to

284

healthcare professionals, referral pathways and diagnostic capacity. It is expected that the observed

285

reduction in cancer diagnoses, and particularly screen-detected cancers, will translate into diagnosis

286

at more advanced stages of disease for those patients in whom investigations were delayed, and

287

therefore poorer survival outcomes. Longer-term data are needed, including information on cancer

288

site, stage, treatment and outcomes, to fully assess the impact of COVID-19 on cancer care, and to

289

assist with ongoing service recovery planning.
