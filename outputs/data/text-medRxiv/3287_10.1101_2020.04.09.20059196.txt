Abstract
Background: In spite of the global containment on prevention efforts, the spread of coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) is continuing to rise, with 1.1 million confirmed cases and 60,124
deaths recorded worldwide since 04 April 2020. The outbreak has a significant threat to
international health and economy. At present, there is no approved vaccine or treatment for the
disease, while efforts are underway. Remdesivir, a nucleotide-analogue antiviral drug developed
for Ebola, is determined to prevent and stop infections with COVID-19, while results are yet
controversial. Here, we aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized
controlled trials to compare the effectiveness of remdesivir and placebo in patients with COVID19.
Method and analysis: We will search MEDLINE-PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library,
ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google scholar databases without restriction in year of publication. We
will include randomized controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of remdesivir versus
placebo for patients confirmed with COVID-19. We will follow the Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA 2015) guidelines for the design and
reporting of the results. The primary endpoint will be time to clinical recovery. The secondary
endpoints will be all cause mortality, discharged date, frequency of respiratory progression, and
treatment-emergent adverse events. Two independent authors will perform study selection, data
extraction, and methodology quality assessment. RevMan 5.3 software will be used for statistical
analysis. Random/fixed effect model will be carried out to calculate mean differences for
continuous outcomes and risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes between remdesivir and placebo.
Ethics and dissemination: This study does not require ethical approval, because no participant’s
data will be involved in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The findings of this study will
be published in reputable and peer-reviewed journal.
Registration: This review protocol is submitted in PROSPERO database for registration and we
will include the registration number in the revised version of the manuscript.

Introduction
Over the course of December 2019, the health authority of Wuhan City, Hubei province, China
reported a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology [1]. The Chinese researcher rapidly
isolated Sever Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from a patient on 7
January 2020 and came out to genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 [2]. On 9 January 2020,
China’s communicable diseases control authority announced that 2019 novel coronavirus (2019nCoV) had been detected as the causative agent for the epidemics [3]. On 11 February 2020
World Health Organization officially named the disease as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19). COVID-19 is caused by a novel β-coronavirus which is named as SARS-CoV-2. SARSCoV-2 shares 79% sequence identity with Sever Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus
(SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which caused a
major outbreak since 2002 and 2012 in China and Saud Arabia respectively [4-6].
In spite of the global containment on prevention efforts, the spread of COVID-19 is continuing to
rise with 1.1 million confirmed cases and 60,124 deaths recorded worldwide since 04 April
2020. [7-8]. The outbreak of COVID-19 infection has a significant threat to international health
and economy [9]. At present, there is no approved vaccine or treatment for COVID-19, so that
identifying the drug treatment options as soon as possible is critical agenda to overcome the
outbreak [10-11].
Despite the lack of approved drugs and vaccine for COVID-19, many scientists are endeavoring
to find medicines specific to the virus and they have been looking into repurposing the already
approved drugs. As of 29 March 2020, there has been 209 clinical trials registered in
clinicaltrials.gov and estimated to be over 500 [12]. Currently, several drugs such as remdesivir,
hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, Ritonavir+Lopinavir, Arbidol and interferon are undergoing
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to test their efficacy and safety for the treatment of COVID19 in many countries [13-18]. Among these investigating drugs remdesivir showed promising
results [18-19]. Remdesivir is nucleotide analog prodrug and shows broad spectrum antiviral
activity against many RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2 [20-21]. Remdesivir has been
reported as a treatment of COVID-19 in United States, China and Italy [13,15, 22]. while results
are yet controversial [9]. To bridge this gap, here we aim to conduct a systematic review and

Eligibility
Study eligibility criteria for this systematic review and meta-analysis will be in accordance with
Participants, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes and Study designs (PICOS) descriptions [23].
Population: The population will be patients confirmed with COVID-19 and with or without
other co-morbid conditions in all age groups.
Intervention: The intervention/ experimental group will be any dose of remdesivir
Comparator: The comparator group will be placebo/ standard of care
Outcomes: The primary endpoints will be time to clinical recovery and proportion of
participants relieved from clinical symptoms defined at the time (in hours) from initiation of the
study treatment. The secondary endpoints will be all cause mortality, discharged date, frequency
of respiratory progression, oxygen saturation and treatment-emergent adverse events in each
groups.
Study design: Only RCTs evaluating effectiveness of remdesivir versus placebo for patients
with COVID-19 will be included.
Study selection
The title and abstract of all searched studies will be examined by two independent review
authors. From the title and abstract of all studies identified by the database search, those studies
duplicated and not meet the eligibility criteria will be excluded. The full texts of the remaining
studies will be further reviewed. Disagreements will be resolved by consensus and if persisted,
we will be arbitrated through discussion with a third review author. We will follow the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA 2015) guidelines [24] for
the design and reporting of the results.

Assessment of risk of bias
The Cochrane risk of bias tool [25] will be used to assess the risk of bias for each included study.
The risk of bias of each trial will be judged by two independent review authors as “Low”,
“Unclear”, or “High” based on the critical domains, including random sequence generation,
allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other source
of biases. Disagreements will be resolved by discussion among all authors. If the disagreements
cannot be resolved through discussion, an arbiter will make the final decision.
Statistical analysis
Meta-analysis will be carried out using the computer software packages RevMan 5.3 [26].
Continuous outcome data will be reported using a mean difference (MD) and a 95% confidence
interval (CI). Binary outcome data will be summarized using risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI.
Mantel-Haenszel method [27] will be used to pool effect estimates of dichotomous outcomes and
inverse variance for continuous outcomes. Cochrane Q test [28] will be used to assess
heterogeneity between studies, and I2 testing [29] will be done to quantify heterogeneity between
studies, with values > 50% representing moderate-to-high heterogeneity. If heterogeneity

between study is acceptable, a fixed-effect model will be used to pool the data. On the other
hand, if unacceptable heterogeneity detected or if the number of studies are small, a randomeffect model will be used to pool the data [30]. Subgroup analysis will be carried out to identify
possible reasons that may cause significant heterogeneity between studies. If we get acceptable
heterogeneity after the subgroup analysis, we will perform meta-analysis. Otherwise, we will do
a narrative description. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to see the robustness of pooled
data by removing low quality studies. Statistical analysis with a p-value < 0.05 will be
considered statistically significant.
Addressing missing data
When individual participant’s data are initially unavailable, we will review the original source,
and/or published trial reports and we will contact the authors to obtain clarification for these
data.
Reporting bias
We will conduct funnel plot and Egger test to check any possible reporting bias if a sufficient
number of included studies (at least 10 trials) are available in this study [31].

Ethics and dissemination
This study does not require ethical approval, because no participant’s data will be involved in
this systematic review and meta-analysis. The findings of this study will be published in
reputable and peer-reviewed journal.
