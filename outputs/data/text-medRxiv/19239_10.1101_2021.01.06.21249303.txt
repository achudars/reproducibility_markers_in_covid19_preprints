Abstract
This paper explores disparities in the effect of pollution on confirmed cases of Covid-19
based on counties’ socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. Using data on all US
counties on a daily basis over the year 2020 and applying a rich panel data fixed effect
model, we document that: 1) there are discernible social and demographic disparities in the
spread of Covid-19. Blacks, low educated, and poorer people are at higher risks of being
infected by the new disease. 2) The criteria pollutants including Ozone, CO, PM10, and
PM2.5 have the potential to accelerate the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. 3) The
disadvantaged population is more vulnerable to the effects of pollution on the spread of
coronavirus. Specifically, the effects of pollution on confirmed cases become larger for
blacks, low educated, and counties with lower average wages in 2019.

1. Introduction

The novel coronavirus was observed initially in a small cluster in Wuhan, China in

December 2019 and spread around the globe during the following year, and claimed about 1.85
million deaths in 2020 (CNN, 2020). While the outbreak of the virus was unprecedented and fast
the factors behind its pace of spread have risen policy-relevant questions. For instance, some
studies point to the fact that there are disparities in the outbreak of the Covid-19 across occupations
(McClure et al., 2020). Blacks, minorities, males, older individuals, low educated, and poorer
individuals are at higher risks of being infected with Covid-19 (Figueroa et al., 2020; Kopel et al.,
2020; McClure et al., 2020; Paul et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020). For instance, Yang et al. (2020)
apply a negative binomial regression at a county-level dataset that covers data on Covid-19 cases
up to June 13th and find that counties with a higher density of racial and ethnicity have higher
confirmed cases. They show that this link is enhanced for counties with higher segregation between
blacks and whites.
On the other end, there are also environmental factors that may affect the spread of Covid19. Temperature and pollution are among the factors that were related to the Covid-19 through
various mechanism channels. For instance, NoghaniBehambari, Salari, et al. (2020) examine the
impacts of ambient air on the spread of Covid-19 across US counties. They use panel data fixed
effect models and GMM models in a panel of county-by-day and find that an increase of one
degree in air temperature is associate with 0.041 more cases per 100,000 population. The results
are robust when they include county-by-week fixed effects and also across various subsamples. In
another study, Contini & Costabile (2020) evaluates the literature on pollution and Covid-19 and
conclude that, although marginally, specific pollutants such as PM10 can explain variations in the
outbreak of Covid-19. However, no study has investigated the heterogeneous effects of pollution

on the spread of Covid-19 based on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. This paper
aims to fill this gap in the literature.
This paper evaluates the effects of demographic and socioeconomic features of counties on
the relationship between pollution and the spread of Covid-19 in the US. Using daily panel data
across all US counties that cover days in the year 2020 and applying a rich panel data fixed effect
model, we find that: 1) Pollution has a small but significant effect on the pace of Covid-19
outbreak. 2) There is heterogeneity in confirmed cases based on demographic characteristics.
Counties with a higher share of blacks, higher share of low educated people, and lower average
wages reveal higher rates of confirmed cases. 3) The marginal effects of pollution on the spread
of Covid-19 is larger among counties with lower wages and a higher share of minorities.
This paper adds to the literature that investigates the sources of variations in the outbreak
of Covid-19 in two ways. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the
socioeconomic disparities in the effect of pollution on Covid-19 confirmed cases. Second, we
update the findings of the literature on pollution and Covid-19 using data from all US counties on
a daily basis that covers all days of the year 2020 while the previous literature exploited from part
of this timeframe.
The findings of this paper have important policy implications. The fact that pollution
causes a mechanism channel for the spread of pandemic suggests that policymakers should reevaluate the abatement structure during the pandemic to protect public health. The evidence on the
racial and demographic disparities also help policymakers design optimal welfare programs during
the pandemic to close the health gap among different groups within a society.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we introduce the data sources
and discuss the final sample. Section 3 provides the econometric framework. In section 4, we go
over the results. Section 5 concludes the paper.

2. Data Sources

This study implements a wide array of data sources. the daily count of new confirmed cases

is extracted from USA-Facts (2020). The daily temperature data is extracted from the Global
Summary of the Day data files produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA). The county population and demographic data are extracted from SEER (2019). The
pollution data comes from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The county average wage
data is from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) and is extracted from
replication codes provided by NoghaniBehambari, Noghani, et al. (2020). Finally, the
unemployment rate data is extracted from Local Area Unemployment Statistics gathered by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics.
First, we show the geographic disparities in Covid-19 and socioeconomic disparities in a
series of figures. Figure 1 illustrates the quartiles of total confirmed cases per county population
(top panel) and the quartiles of daily average cases (bottom panel) across US counties for the whole
year of 2020. The rates of confirmed cases for both outcomes are concentrated mainly in eastern
and western states. Figure 2 depicts the geographic distribution of counties based on quartiles of
the share of people with low education (top panel) and high education (bottom panel). 4 Figure 3
shows the geographic distribution based on the percentage of whites (top panel) and the percentage
of blacks (bottom panel).

Throughout the paper we categorize people with less than high school education as low educated. Similarly, we
consider people with bachelor and above as high educated.

The pollution data reported by EPA has two problems. First, pollutants have different units
of measurement. In order to solve this problem and to make the interpretations easy and intuitive,
we standardize the pollution data. We subtract the variable from the mean and then divide it by its
standard deviation over the sample period. Therefore, all pollutants have a mean of zero and a
standard deviation of one. For this reason, we avoid reporting their summary statistics. Second,
the distribution of pollution monitors across counties is sporadic. Moreover, not every pollution
monitor reports every essential criteria pollutant on a regular basis. To show this fact visually,
Figure 4 illustrates the quartiles of Ozone pollution across counties. While the distribution is
arbitrary across counties they cover a small fraction of counties. For instance, only 356 counties
report Ozone among 3,148 counties covered in the final sample.
A summary statistics of the final sample is reported in Table 1. On average, there have
been 17.8 new confirmed cases per 100,000 population and the total inflicted individuals in 2020
within each county add up to 6,588 persons per 100,000 county population. Roughly 9.9 percent
of people are black and 13.4 percent are low educated.

3. Econometric Framework

We start with a cross-sectional data of counties and explore the cross-tabulation between

county characteristics in 2019 and the rate of spread of Covid-19 in 2020 using the following OLS
model:
𝑦𝑦𝑐𝑐,2020 = 𝛼𝛼0 + 𝛼𝛼1 𝑋𝑋𝑐𝑐,2019 + 𝜖𝜖𝑐𝑐,2020

(1)

The main reason to use the characteristics in 2019 is that socioeconomic characteristics
have not yet been released for the year 2020. In this specification, 𝑦𝑦 is the Covid-19 confirmed
cases per 100,000 population of county 𝑐𝑐 for the year 2020.

In the next step, we use a panel of county-by-day data to assess the effect of pollution on
the rates of Covid-19 using fixed-effect models of the following form:
𝑦𝑦𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 = 𝛼𝛼0 + 𝛼𝛼1 𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡−3 + 𝛼𝛼2 𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡−3 + 𝜉𝜉𝑐𝑐 + 𝜁𝜁𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝜂𝜂𝑡𝑡 + 𝛾𝛾𝑐𝑐 × 𝑡𝑡 + 𝜖𝜖𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐

Where 𝑐𝑐 Indexes the county, 𝑠𝑠

(2)

indexes the state, and 𝑡𝑡 indexes day-by-month of

observation. 𝑦𝑦 is the daily rates of Covid-19 confirmed in the county. 𝑃𝑃 is the standardized variable
of pollution measures including Ozone, Carmon Monoxide (CO), particulate matters less than

10𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇 (PM10), and particulate matters less than 2.5𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇 (PM2.5). The pollution is measured three
days in advance since the literature suggests that the virus has an average incubation period of 3
days (Lauer et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2005). Since temperature is discussed to be one
of the causes that accelerate the outbreak we also control for daily temperature in all regressions
represented by 𝑇𝑇 (NoghaniBehambari, Salari, et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Xie & Zhu, 2020).
The parameter 𝜉𝜉 is the county fixed effect. 𝜁𝜁 is a set of state by day-month fixed effects. The matrix

𝜂𝜂 represents day-by-month fixed effects. In some specifications, we also include a county-specific

linear time trend. Finally, 𝜖𝜖 is a disturbance term. All standard errors are clustered at the county
level. All regressions are weighted using the average of county population in 2020. To assess the
socioeconomic disparities in 𝛼𝛼1 of equation 2, we use an interaction term for each characteristics

using the following formulation:

𝑦𝑦𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 = 𝛼𝛼0 + 𝛼𝛼1 𝑋𝑋𝑐𝑐 × 𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡−3 + 𝛼𝛼2 𝑋𝑋𝑐𝑐 + 𝛼𝛼3 𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡−3 + 𝛼𝛼4 𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡−3 + 𝜉𝜉𝑐𝑐 + 𝜁𝜁𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝜂𝜂𝑡𝑡 + 𝛾𝛾𝑐𝑐 × 𝑡𝑡
+ 𝜖𝜖𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐

(2)

Where all parameters follow the same notation as in equations 1 and 2. The coefficient of
interest s 𝛼𝛼1 that shows the effect of pollution on coronavirus cases per population for the group
with characteristics represented in 𝑋𝑋 compared to the reference group.

4. Main Results

We start by reevaluating the social disparities in confirmed cases of coronavirus. Table 2

shows the results of regressions introduced in equation 1 for total and average daily cases in
columns 1 and 2, respectively. If the share of blacks in a county goes up by 10 percent the
confirmed cases of corona increase by 1.1 cases per 100,000 population, an increase equivalent to
a 6.2 percent change from the mean of daily confirmed cases (column 2, first row). In a similar
manner, if the share of people with at least a bachelor's degree goes up by 10 percent in a county
then the average daily confirmed cases go down by 16.9 cases per 100,000 population. This change
can explain 15.5 percent of the standard deviation of confirmed cases over the year 2020. Overall,
counties with a higher share of blacks, low educated people, and lower-income and wages have
higher rates of confirmed cases.
Next, we reexamine the effect of pollution on Covid-19. Using equation 2, Table 3 reports
the results for models without and with a linear county trend (columns 1 and 2, respectively). Each
independent variable is in a separate row and each cell represents a separate regression. Looking
at the full specification of column 2, one standard deviation increase in CO, Ozone, PM10, and
PM2.5 is associated with an increase in Covid-19 cases by 0.04, 0.29, 0.35, and 0.11 cases per
100,000 population. Although these effects are marginal and economically small they are
significant at 1% level and robust to including or excluding county by time linear trend.
Finally, we report the main results of the paper using equation 3 in Table 4 through Table
7. Interestingly, as areas with a higher share of poor people and minorities reveal higher confirmed
cases they also are more susceptible to pollution-driven confirmed cases. The interaction term
between pollution measures and blacks (Table 4) and low educated (Table 6) are positive implying
that the relationship between pollution and the outbreak of the virus is stronger among these

people. On the other hand, the interaction term between pollutants and whites (Table 5), high
educated (Table 7), and average wages (Table 8) are negative implying the protective effects
against the Covid-19 consequence of pollution among counties with a higher share of whites, high
educated, and income. For instance, the marginal effect of one standard deviation increase in PM10
on confirmed cases for a 10 percent rise in the share of blacks in a county goes up by 6.49 cases
per 100,000 population (column 3, Table 4).

5. Conclusion

Understanding the racial and social disparities in exposure to a pandemic and specifically,

the disparities in the effect of pollution on the outbreak of a pandemic are essential for
policymakers to design optimal welfare programs and effective restriction orders. In this paper,
we explored this aspect of the outbreak of Covid-19 using daily data across all US counties
covering all days of 2020. Applying a rich set of fixed effects that also controls for a linear county
by time trend, we documented that 1) there are discernible social and demographic disparities in
the spread of Covid-19. Blacks, low educated, and poorer people are at higher risks of being
infected by the new disease. 2) The criteria pollutants have the potential to accelerate the outbreak
of the virus. Among others, these pollutants include Ozone, CO, PM10, and PM2.5. 3) The
disadvantaged population is more vulnerable to the effects of pollution on the spread of
coronavirus. Specifically, the effects of pollution on confirmed cases become larger for blacks,
low educated, and counties with lower average wages in 2019. Overall, these results suggest that
the abatement structures should be strengthened during a pandemic with more weight towards
areas with a higher concentration of minorities and poor people.
