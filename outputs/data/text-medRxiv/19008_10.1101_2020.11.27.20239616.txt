Abstract
Background: This meta-analysis sought to determine the estimated association between
obesity and adverse outcomes among COVID-19 patients.

Methods: We followed the recommended PRISMA guidelines. A systematic literature search
was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect for published literature between
December 1, 2019, and October 2, 2020. The data for the study were pooled from studies that
contained the search terms "Obesity" AND (COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV or Coronavirus or SARSCoV-2) AND ("ICU admission" OR "Hospitalization" OR "Disease severity" OR "Invasive
mechanical ventilator" OR "Death" OR "Mortality"). All the online searches were supplemented
by reference screening of retrieved studies for additional literature. The pooled odds ratio (OR)
and confidence intervals (CI) from the retrieved studies were calculated using the random effect
model (Inverse-Variance method).

Findings: Five studies with a combined sample size of 335,192 patients were included in the
meta-analysis. The pooled OR from the final analysis showed that patients who are severely
obese were more likely to experience adverse outcome (death or ICU admission or needing IMV
or hospitalization) compared to the normal patients [OR = 2.81, 95% CI = 2.33 – 3.40, I2 = 29%].

Conclusion: Severe obesity is a risk factor in developing adverse outcomes among COVID-19
patients. The finding of the study signifies promotive, preventive, and curative attention to be
accorded patients diagnosed with severe obesity and COVID-19.

Keywords: Coronavirus, COVID-19, obesity, patients, adverse outcomes

Background
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) a public health emergency of international concern
(PHEIC) on the 30th of January 2020 and further characterized the spread of the novel COVID19 disease a global pandemic on the 11th of March, 2020 [1]. As at 30th January 2020, there were
7818 total confirmed cases globally with only 82 cases recorded outside China – the epicenter of
the pandemic [2]. Between 30th January 2020 and 20th October 2020, over 40.3 million
confirmed cases across 217 countries with over 1.12 million deaths was reported globally
making the pandemic one of the deadliest in the past two centuries [3].
Initial findings from early studies pointed towards age with older individuals being
particularly at risk, those with non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as, diabetes mellitus or
cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, respiratory conditions, and or kidney disease [4].
Further studies have led to the discovery that obesity is a plausible risk factor for severe illness,
hospitalization and even death from COVID-19 [5, 6].
Obesity is known to be a risk factor for many NCDs [7] and other medical conditions
leading to an increased risk of hospitalization, serious illness, and mortality [8]. In 2009, for
example, obesity was highlighted as an independent risk factor for elevated disease severity and
mortality for the HINI influenza virus [8-9] and even though the association between obesity and
increased disease severity is not novel, empirical knowledge about its association with the novel
COVID-19 virus pandemic is important to guide the fast changing efforts being adopted by
health systems globally to halt its spread, severe illness, hospitalizations and mortalities.
Increasingly, obesity is being identified as a predisposing factor for COVID-19 and this is
particularly worrying as obesity affects a large proportion of the world’s population as 39% of

adults globally are overweight (BMI ≥25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2) and 13% have clinical obesity (BMI

≥30.0 kg/m2) [11, 12].
The prevalence of persons with obesity globally is at an all-time high for both higher
income countries and low- and middle-income countries [13]. According to Jones-Smith et al
[14] and Jones-Smith et al [15], more than 70% of persons with overweight/obesity live in low or
middleincome countries, and as a country’s economy grows, the burden of persons with
obesity shifts to the poor. More worrying is the fact that empirical evidence shows that obesity
leads to impaired immunity, chronic inflammation, decreasing lung capacity and reserve making
ventilation more difficult, blood that’s prone to clot, and lower vaccine response as recorded
previously for some diseases such as influenza, hepatitis B and tetanus, and all of which can
worsen COVID-19 illness [12, 16-18]. Moreover, obesity and NCDs in the geriatric population
are significantly associated with polypharmacy, which suppresses immunity leading to increased
risk of morbidity and mortality in acute infections that occur in COVID-19 patients [19]. These
makes obesity especially in an era of a global pandemic, an important phenomenon worth
examining.
There are growing empirical literature on the relationship between obesity and COVID19. For example, in an observational cohort study in the UK which sampled more than 20,000
hospital in-patients with COVID-19, researchers found that obesity was an independent risk
factor for high mortality on COVID-19 patients [20]. In another study in France, the prevalence
of obesity among adult inpatients with COVID-19 was found to be high and obesity together
with other comorbidities were significant in predicting adverse effect and even death for
COVID-19 [21]. A study by Tartof, Qian and Hong [22] has also reported that obesity is a risky
predisposing factor for persons who contract COVID-19, while adding that from their study

findings obesity stood out from racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic factors when they were
controlled for. In that same study, Tartof and colleagues found that data from the 6916 sampled
patients in the study revealed that compared with those at normal body mass index (BMI) of 18.5
to 24 kg/m2, the risk of death more than doubled for COVID-19 patients with a body mass index
(BMI) of 40 to 44 kg/m2 and nearly doubled again for those with a BMI of 45 kg/m2. This
finding by Tartof and colleagues has been corroborated recently by a study in Saudi Arabia by
Herbst et al. [23] who also found that obesity increases the risk of death from COVID-19 by
48%, the risk of hospitalization by 113%, and of needing intensive care by 74%. Herbst et al.
[23] further highlighted a concern that a COVID-19 vaccine may not work for obese people due
to the fact that flu vaccines don’t work effectively in people with BMI of more than 30.
Despite the growing evidence on the effect of obesity on COVID-19 treatment outcomes,
it is important to note that in the past there have been some conflicting findings in relation to
obesity and their effects on treatment outcomes for some respiratory diseases. For example,
findings from a study in the United States which used almost 10,000 cases of seasonal influenza
did not find any significant evidence of obesity as a risk factor for requiring mechanical
ventilation or death [24] unlike the case in 2009 [25]. Furthermore, Umbrello et al. [26] have
also reported that obesity was associated with increased survival rate for patients with acute
respiratory distress syndrome. These conflicting reports in the past makes it relevant today for a
strong synthesis and a meta-analysis of evidence to be established for obesity in the global fight
against the COVID-19 pandemic.
Literature is littered with scattered pieces of evidence on how obesity put one at risk for
adverse outcome of COVID-19. With this growing body of empirical literature owing to the
rapid spread of the novel COVID-19 virus with its accompanying mortalities and the increasing

growth in the proportion of the world’s population living with obesity, it has become imperative
for this study to be conducted to synthetize the evidence, assess the strength of the evidence and
obtain a single summary estimate of the effect of obesity on COVID-19 outcomes through a
meta-analysis of empirical literature. This study is expected to provide conclusive empirical
evidence to guide ongoing measures and programs put in place by health systems globally to halt
the spread, hospitalizations and mortalities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods
Search strategy
A systematic literature search was conducted through databases PubMed, Google Scholar and
ScienceDirect for English language literature published between December 1, 2019 and October
2,2020. The search consisting of the terms "Obesity" AND (COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV or
Coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2) AND ("ICU admission" OR "Hospitalization" OR "Disease
severity" OR "Invasive mechanical ventilator" OR "Death" OR "Mortality") had been used to
find potential papers. More details of the search in each database are presented in Table S1-S3 in
the supplementary file.

Eligibility criteria
The study which categorized BMI as normal (< 25 kg/m2), overweight (from 25 to < 30 kg/m2),
moderate obesity (from 30 to < 35 kg/m2), and severe obesity (≥ 35 kg/m2) and at the same time
reported outcomes such as ICU admission or requiring Invasive Mechanical Ventilation (IMV)or
requiring hospitalization or death among the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. Only English

language research articles published in a peer-reviewed journals were included in this study.
Unpublished articles as well as preprints were excluded in the screening process. The studies
with only cohort study design were included. Therefore, studies with other study designs, review
articles, letters to the editor etc. were excluded. And the studies which reported odds ratio were
only included. So, the studies reporting risk ratio (RR), hazard ratio (HR) etc. were excluded.

Data extraction and study quality assessment
After selecting the relevant articles using the inclusion, exclusion criteria and following the
PRISMA process, data were extracted from the selected articles. From each article extracted data
included name of the first author, study design, country, follow-up period, sample size, age of the
participants, outcome investigated and odds ratio associated with BMI category >=35 kg/m2,
keeping BMI category <25 kg/m2 as the reference category, as well as the confidence interval
associated with the odds ratio. Newcastle-Ottawa technique for the assessment of study quality
for cohort study were used to assess the study quality of the included cohort studies. Studies with
quality score 6 or more were included in the analysis.

Statistical analysis
After extracting the necessary data pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI)
from the included studies were calculated using random effect model (Inverse-Variance method).
Random effect model was selected regardless of the degree of heterogeneity among the included
studies as the result from random effect model is generalizable. Between-study heterogeneity
was assessed by calculating I2 statistic. Forrest plot was drawn to comprehensively present the
information about included studies and between study heterogeneity. Egger’s bias test as well as

funnel plot was drawn to assess the risk of publication bias. And finally, sensitivity analysis
using sequential omission of included studies was performed to assess the consistency of the
result. All the p-values less than 0.05 were considered significant. All the analysis was done
using software STATA 12.

Results
Search results
A total of 2998 articles were identified through online database searching among which 340 were
through PubMed, 2600 were through Google Scholar and 58 were through ScienceDirect (Figure
1). After screening title and abstract of those 2998 articles 18 were selected for full text
screening.
After the full text screening of those 18 articles, 11 articles were excluded due to mismatch of the
categorization of the obesity. Then among the 7 articles, 2 articles were excluded due to lack of
information and duplication. Finally, 5 articles were included for the quantitative analysis.

Study Characteristics
Among the included studies, three studies were conducted in the USA, one in France and one in
the UK. The study design of three studies among the five studies, were retrospective cohort, one
was prospective cohort and one was population-based cohort study. The minimum sample size
among the studies was 103 and maximum was 3,34,329. Two studies investigated the outcome
ICU admission, one investigated needing Invasive Mechanical Ventilator (IMV), one
investigated hospitalization, and one investigated death among the identified COVID-19 patients.

All the included studies had good quality score (Table S4 in supplementary file). More
characteristics of the included studies are presented in Table 1.

Effect of severe obesity on adverse outcome in COVID-19 patients
The pooled OR for the adverse outcome among the COVID-19 patients, heterogeneity statistic
and the result egger’s bias test of publication bias are presented in Table 2. The pooled OR
obtained from the five studies suggesting that the people who are severely obese that is with BMI
>=35 kg/m2 are 2.81 times more likely (OR=2.81, 95% CI= 2.33 – 3.40, I2=29%) to experience
adverse outcome (death or ICU admission or needing IMV or hospitalization) compared to the
normal people that is with BMI <25 kg/m2. The forest plot of the result is depicted in Figure 2.
Publication bias was tested using egger’s bias test and creating funnel plot. The p-value
associated with the egger’s bias test (p=0.873) suggests that no publication bias is present.
Similar result can be seen through funnel plot. The funnel plot is presented in Figure S1 in the
supplementary file.

Sensitivity analysis
The result of sensitivity analysis with the sequential omission of included studies is presented in
Table 3. The result suggests that the pooled OR is not based on only one study; all the studies
contributed to the final pooled result. The graph of the result obtained from sensitivity analysis is
presented in figure S2 in the supplementary file.

The current study found that severely obese COVID-19 patients had higher odds of experiencing
adverse outcomes such as death, ICU admission, needing IMV, and hospitalization. This study
supports the evidence from clinical observations from [28, 32-35] that obesity is associated with
increased risk of severe COVID-19, hospital admission, requiring IMV and death and intubation.
The finding in our study confirms the association between obesity among patients and adverse
effects (SARS-CoV-2 severity, requiring increased attention and intensive care for SARS-CoV2) found in France [27].The result accords the earlier studies which showed that obesity is
associated with the risk of increased hospitalisation, risk of developing adverse complications
[36-39]. Similarly, obesity has been reported to be associated with a greater likelihood of
enhancing transmission and developing adverse complications from disease such as influenza
[40], influenza A (H1N1) infection [41-44].
Despite the significant findings shown in the present study, the exact mechanism
necessitating the association between obesity and adverse effects of COVIDD-19 is not
conclusive. However, several factors could account for the observed findings. First of all, the
results could imply that patients with obesity have altered respiratory physiology, including
decreased functional residual capacity, expiratory reserves volume, hypoxemia, and ventilation
or perfusion abnormalities which could have predisposed them to contracting and developing
severe complications from COVID-19 [28]. Secondly, the risk of obesity in patients with
COVID-19 could have increased because the COVID-19 virus affects the adipose tissue which
serves as a reservoir for human adenovirus Ad-36, influenza A virus, HIV, cytomegalovirus,
Trypanosoma gondii, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This increases the tendency by which
COVID-19 spread to other organs in the body, hence the several complications [45]. Also, the
severe complications associated with COVID-19 among patients with obesity could result from

the consequences of the underlying low-grade chronic inflammation, and suppression of innate
and adaptive immune responses [33]. Another plausible explanation may be that mechanical
dysfunction due to severe obesity could have increased the severity of lower respiratory tract
infection and contribute to secondary infection [33].

Strength and limitations of the study
This meta-analysis strongly reiterates the evidence that obesity is a risk factor for severe
COVID-19 outcomes. However, the cross-sectional nature of the studies included in the present
meta-analysis could limit the findings' generalisability as causal inference is not drawn. Also, the
studies included were from the USA, France, and the UK, which could limit its applicability due
to differences in races, patterns of the severity of COVID-19 infections, and mortality rate.

Conclusion
Our result showed that obesity is a contributory factor associated with increasing COVID-19
adverse outcomes. Among the patients with obesity, the risk of developing COVID-19 adverse
outcomes was close to three folds. This finding underscores the need for obese people to strictly
adhere to the COVID-19 prevention guidelines and minimal exposure to infected persons. Health
promotion regarding physical exercise and balanced diet should be undertaken to prevent
overweight and obesity. There is also the need for early detection and treatment of people with
obesity diagnosed with COVID-19. Further research should focus on the factors influencing the
association between obesity and the severity of COVID-19 outcomes.
