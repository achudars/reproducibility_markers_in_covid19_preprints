Summary:

46

Background On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared its assessment of COVID-19

47

as a global pandemic. Effective therapeutic drugs are urgently needed to improve the overall prognosis

48

of patients, but currently no such drugs are available.

49

Methods The basic information, complete blood count, coagulation profile, inflammatory cytokines

50

and serum biochemical indicators in 42 patients with COVID-19 (21 of whom were treated with low

51

molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and 21 without LMWH) were retrospectively analyzed to compare

52

and evaluate the effect of LMWH treatment on disease progression.

53

Findings 42 patients with COVID-19 treated at the hospital between February 1 and March 15, 2020

were selected for the study, of which 21 underwent LMWH treatment (Heparin group), and 21 did not

55

(Control), during hospitalization. The changes in lymphocyte% in patients in the heparin group before

56

and after LMWH treatment were significantly different to those in the control group (11.10 9.50, 3.08

57

±

±9.66, p=0.011). The changes in D-dimer and fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) levels in the

58

heparin group before and after LMWH treatment were significantly different to those in the control

59

group (-2.85 3.90, -0.05 0.85, p=0.002; -9.05 13.14, -1.78 3.15, p=0.035). In the heparin group, IL-6

60

levels were significantly reduced after LMWH treatment (47.47 58.86, 15.76 25.71, p=0.006). In

61

addition, the changes in IL-6 levels in the heparin group before and after LMWH treatment were

62

significantly different to those in the control group (-32.46 65.97, 14.96 151.09, p=0.031).

63

Interpretation In this study, we found that LMWH can improve the coagulation dysfunction of

64

COVID-19 patients, and has anti-inflammatory effects of reducing IL-6 and increasing lymphocyte%,

65

which can be used as a potential therapeutic drug for the treatment of COVID-19 and provide guidance

66

for subsequent clinical treatment.

Introduction

68

According to Nature, the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is becoming unstoppable.1

69

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared its assessment of COVID-19 as a

70

global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by a long incubation period, high infectivity, and

71

multiple routes of transmission.2,3 According to real-time WHO statistics, the total number of

72

confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide as of April 1, 2020 has exceeded 850,000, with more than

73

40,000 deaths. However, no effective medicines are currently available, and it can only be treated

74

symptomatically. Given the rapid spread of COVID-19 and the high mortality rate in severe cases,

75

there is an urgent need for a better understanding of its clinical characteristics and may help to screen

76

out reliable specific drugs from marketed drugs.

77

Lymphopenia and inflammatory cytokine storms are typical abnormalities observed in highly

78

pathogenic coronavirus infections (such as SARS and MERS),10 and are believed to be associated with

79

disease severity.5-7 Several clinical studies have observed that cytokine storms are important

80

mechanisms of disease exacerbation and death in COVID-19 patients, .5-7 Particularly, IL-6 levels in

81

severely ill patients were significantly higher than that in mild cases.8 IL-6 is one of the core cytokines

82

that are consistently found to be elevated in serum of patients with cytokine storm,9 it contributes to

83

many of the key symptoms of cytokine storm, i.e. vascular leakage, and activation of the complement

84

and coagulation cascade inducing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).10,11 The level of IL-6

85

is closely related to the occurrence and severity of cytokine storms,reducing the level or activity of IL-6

86

may contribute to prevent or even reverse the cytokine storm syndrome caused by the virus, 12 thereby

87

improving the condition of patients with COVID-19.

88

In recent years, a large number of studies have revealed that low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)

89

has various non-anticoagulant properties13 that play an anti-inflammatory role by reducing the release

90

and biological activity of IL-6.14-16 However, the anti-inflammatory effects of LMWH in COVID-19

91

are not currently known. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first retrospective cohort study, to

92

analyze the relieving effect of LMWH in patients with COVID-19. This study aims to review and

93

analyze the treatment course of patients with COVID-19 to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of

94

heparin and delay disease progression to provide guidance for subsequent clinical practice(Fig.1).

95

Methods

97

Research subjects

98

To investigate the therapeutic effect of LMWH on COVID-19, we conducted a retrospective study. All

100

Science and Technology (Wuhan, Hubei Province, China), a designated treatment hospital for patients

101

with COVID-19. This study was approved by the institutional review board of the hospital. In total, we

102

retrospectively collected the electronic medical records of 42 patients with COVID-19, the admission

103

data for these patients was from February 1, 2020, to March 15, 2020 (Fig.2 shows the case inclusion

118

Data collection

119

The basic information, complete blood count, coagulation profile, inflammatory cytokines and serum

120

biochemical indicators (including liver function, kidney function, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive

121

protein (CRP) and electrolytes) in 42 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Two

122

researchers also independently reviewed the data collection forms to double check the data collected.

123

Statistical analysis

124

Data analysis was performed using SPSS 22.0 statistical software. Data were expressed as mean

125

standard deviation (SD). GraphPad 6.0 software was used for plotting. Differences between groups

126

were evaluated using the T-test for measurement data, the Chi-square test for count data, and the

127

Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test between groups (independent samples) and within groups (related

128

samples). Differences of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

129

Results

130

General characteristics of patients with COVID-19

131

As shown in Table 2, the heparin group consisted of 13 males and eight females aged between 42 and

132

91 years (median age was 69.0 years), and the control group consisted of 14 males and seven females

133

aged between 40 and 84 years (median age was 69.0 years); there was no significant difference

134

between the two groups. There were no significant differences in comorbidities, such as hypertension,

135

diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and carcinomas, between the two groups. Similarly, there were no

136

significant differences in novel coronavirus pneumonia onset symptoms, including fever (body

137

temperature

138

and nausea and vomiting. Similarly, there was no significant difference in antiviral treatment between

139

the two groups. These results indicate that the general characteristics of the two groups of patients were

140

consistent and comparable.

141

LMWH has no effect on the days to conversion to negative and the duration of hospitalization of

142

patients with COVID-19

143

As shown in Table 2, the number of days to conversion to negative (time from hospitalization to virus

144

shedding) was 20.0 days (IQR 11.0-31.0) in the heparin group and 19.0 days (IQR 12.0-30.0) in the

146

length of hospital stay was 29.0 days (IQR 17.0-42.0) in the heparin group and 27.0 days (IQR

147

24.0-31.0) in the control group (p = 0.41); the difference between the two groups was not significant.

148

Notably, all patients showed improvement after treatment.

Effect of LMWH on Blood routine in patients with COVID-19

150

As shown in Fig.3A-D, there was no significant difference in red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells

151

(WBC), monocyte% and neutrophil% levels between the two groups. As shown in Fig.3E, there was no

152

significant difference in lymphocyte% between the heparin and control groups before treatment (18.84

153

±8.24, 22.42±8.74, p=0.144). There was no significant difference in lymphocyte% between the heparin

154

and control groups after treatment (29.94 7.92, 25.65 10.10, p=0.215). However, patients in the

155

heparin group had a significantly increased percentage of lymphocytes after LMWH treatment (18.84

156

8.24, 29.94 7.92, p=0.000). In addition, the changes in lymphocyte% in patients in the heparin group

157

before and after LMWH treatment were significantly different to those in the control group (11.10

158

9.50, 3.08 9.66, p=0.011).

159

Effect of LMWH on coagulation function in patients with COVID-19

160

According to the data, there was no significant difference in thrombin time (TT, Fig.3F), activated

161

partial thromboplastin time (APTT, Fig.3G), prothrombin time (PT, Fig.3H) levels between the two

162

groups. As shown in Fig.3I, the levels of D-dimer in the heparin group were significantly higher

163

compared to those in the control group before treatment (3.75 4.04, 1.23 1.15, p=0.009). There was

172

group, FDP levels were significantly reduced after LMWH treatment (14.35 14.6, 2.64 1.16, p=0.001).

173

The changes in FDP levels in patients in the heparin group before and after LMWH treatment were

174

significantly different to those in the control group (-9.05 13.14, -1.78 3.15, p=0.035). However, there

175

was no significant difference in fibrinogen (FIB, Fig.3K), antithrombin

176

international normalized ratio (INR, Fig.3M) levels between the two groups.

177

Effect of LMWH on CRP in patients with COVID-19

178

As shown in Fig.3N, there were no significant differences in CRP levels between the two groups of

179

patients before treatment (31.15 26.62, 29.00 23.79, p=0.497). There were no significant differences

180

in CRP levels between the two groups of patients after treatment (8.95 10.44, 8.76 16.66, p=0.620).

181

Similarly, there were no significant differences in the changes of CRP levels between the two groups of

182

patients before and after LMWH treatment (-22.62 23.79, -20.23 33.91, p=0.660).

183

Effect of LMWH on cytokines in patients with COVID-19

groups. There were no significant differences in the levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, TNF-α and IFN-γ

186

between the two groups. Notably, there was no significant difference in IL-6 levels between the heparin

187

and control groups before treatment (47.47 58.86, 63.27 96.27, p=0.950). The levels of IL-6 in the

188

heparin group were significantly lower compared to those in the control group after treatment (15.76

189

25.71, 78.24 142.41, p=0.000). In the heparin group, IL-6 levels were significantly reduced after

190

LMWH treatment (47.47 58.86, 15.76 25.71, p=0.006). Similarly, the changes in IL-6 levels in the

191

heparin group before and after LMWH treatment were significantly different to those in the control

192

group (-32.46 65.97, 14.96 151.09, p=0.031).

196

studies have revealed that heparin has various non-anticoagulant properties, for instance LMWH can

197

exert anti-inflammatory effects by reducing the release and biological activity of IL-6.14-16,19

198

Meanwhile some results indicate that IL-6 and IL-8 can cause hypercoagulation, leading to scattered

199

fibrin clots, shortening the clot dissolution time and maximum dissolution rate.20 Several clinical

200

researches have observed that severe COVID-19 patients had higher levels of IL-6,8 which suggests the

201

hypercoagulation status of COVID-19 patients may be related to the body increased cytokine levels. In

202

previous studies of patients with COVID-19, D-dimer levels were significantly elevated in patients

203

admitted to the ICU with severe cases.21 The research of Ning Tang et al. showed higher levels of

204

D-dimer and FDP in fatal cases,22 and Li et al. believe that while monitoring for venous

205

thromboembolism, there may have some correlation between D-dimer and COVID-19 severity.23

206

However, there is currently no conclusive evidence supporting the use of D-dimer as an evaluation

207

index.24-26 A large sample analysis is required to determine whether D-dimer is associated with

208

COVID-19 severity. Therefore, the present study does not consider this parameter as an evaluation

209

index for disease progression. The average values of D-dimer and FDP before treatment was greater in

210

the heparin group than in the control group (3·75,1·23,P

211

is a retrospective analysis, we did not intervene in the drug use of the patients, it can be inferred that

212

the purpose of medication in the heparin group is to improve hypercoagulability. Because D-dimer and

213

FDP are not considered as factors for the patient's disease progression, therefore, it has no effect on

214

subsequent analysis of results.

215

Several studies have recommended CRP and lymphocyte%(LYM%)as indices for evaluating the

216

effectiveness of clinical drugs or treatments.27-29 In the difference analysis of this study, there was no

217

statistically significant difference in CRP between the groups, indicating that LMWH treatment has no

218

effect on this parameter, but in the result of LYM%, the mean value of the heparin group was higher

219

than that of the control group (11·10% and 3·08%, respectively). LYM% was higher in the heparin

220

group after treatment compared to the control group (p < 0·001), which is consistent with the results of

221

Derhaschnig et al.30 This suggests that LMWH can increase LYM% in patients with COVID-19 and

222

improve their condition. There are two possible reason: First, SARS-CoV-2 is highly homologous to

223

SARS-CoV, heparan sulfate proteoglycans(HSPGs) is the basic cell surface molecule involved in

224

SARS-CoV cell entry,31 and LMWH is a member of the HSPGs family,32 it has already been confirmed

225

that the addition of exogenous heparin reduced the ability of SARS-CoV to bind to the cell surface and

226

increased cellular resistance to infection.33,34 Mycroft-West et al. also showed that LMWH can bind to

227

the SARS-CoV-2 surface protein (Spike) S1 receptor binding domain and block the replication of the

228

virus, thus, showing potential antiviral effects.35 Additionally, LMWH can reduce lymphocyte death

229

caused by the direct viral infection of lymphocytes.6 The second, preliminary research has confirmed

230

＜0.01;14·35,4·05,P＜0·01). Because this trial

that proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα and IL-6, can induce lymphopenia.7 Therefore,

231

decreases in the number or activity of relevant inflammatory factors may have some significance for

232

the increase in LYM%.

233

IL-6 levels in severely ill patients with COVID-19 are significantly higher than in patients with mild

234

cases,8 and a cytokine storm may occur when cytokines reach a certain threshold in the body.9 The

235

transition from a mild to severe condition in patients with COVID-19 may be caused by cytokine

236

storms. Reducing IL-6 release or activity may prevent the cytokine storm syndrome caused by the

237

virus,10 thereby improving the condition of patients with COVID-19. Studies have shown that LMWH

238

may reduce the release of IL-6 in the body by inhibiting the expression of nuclear factor

239

(NF-κB).

14-16

κB

In the present study, we performed statistical analysis of the levels of inflammatory

240

cytokines in two groups of patients, and the results showed that IL-6 significantly decreased in the

241

heparin group compared to the control group, whereas the changes in other inflammatory factors were

242

not statistically significant; these results are consistent with the conclusions above. In addition, a study

243

by Mummery et al. found that heparincan bind to IL-6, it may serve to reduce the availability of IL-6 to

244

its receptor complex, including IL-6 binding to SIL-6R and IL-6 /SIL-6R binding to sgp130,19 this may

245

reduce the the biological activity of IL-6. This indicates that LMWH reduces the release of IL-6 while

246

also reducing its biological activity, which also explains the increase of LYM% in the heparin group.

247

This study found that LMWH can improve the coagulation dysfunction of COVID-19 patients, and has

248

anti-inflammatory effects of reducing il-6 and increasing LYM%, which can be used as a potential

249

therapeutic drug for the treatment of COVID-19 and provide guidance for subsequent clinical treatment.

250

In addition, to further confirm the conclusions of this study, we conducted a prospective clinical study

251

to evaluate the efficacy and safety of enoxaparin sodium in the treatment of hospitalized adult patients

252

with COVID-19(Chinese Clinical Trial Registry number:chiCTR2000030700), with the expectation of

253

providing a more powerful reference for treatment.

254

Limitations:

255

This study has some limitations. First, due to the retrospective design, we were unable to control the

256

time intervals between examinations of various indices in patients and the LMWH dosing schedule,

257

and we could not estimate the effective dose and timing of LMWH. Second, there were no critical

258

cases in the two groups of patients in the trial; the treatment outcome of all cases was improvement and

259

260

critically ill patients was limited. Finally, the sample size and single-center design may have limited our

findings.

Figure 1. Possible mechanism of anti-inflammatory effects of LMWH in patients with COVID-19.

365

Under conventional antiviral treatment regimens, LMWH improves hypercoagulability, inhibits IL-6

366

release, and counteracts IL-6 biological activity in patients. It has potential antiviral effects and helps

367

delay or block inflammatory cytokine storms. LMWH can increase the LYM% of patients and may be

368

suitable as treatment for COVID-19.

371

Based on strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, 42 patients with COVID-19 treated at the hospital

between February 1 and March 15, 2020 were selected for the study, of which 21 underwent LMWH
