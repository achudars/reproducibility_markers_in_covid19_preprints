ABSTRACT
Background: We characterized SARS-CoV-2 infections in a densely-populated, majority Latinx San Francisco
community six-weeks into the city’s shelter-in-place order.
Methods: We offered SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-PCR and antibody (Abbott ARCHITECT IgG) testing,
regardless of symptoms, to all residents (>4 years) and workers in a San Francisco census tract (population:
5,174) at outdoor, community-mobilized events over four days. We estimated SARS-CoV-2 point prevalence
(PCR-positive) and cumulative incidence (antibody or PCR-positive) in the census tract and evaluated risk
factors for recent (PCR-positive/antibody-negative) versus prior infection (antibody-positive/PCR-negative).
SARS-CoV-2 genome recovery and phylogenetics were used to measure viral strain diversity, establish viral
lineages present, and estimate number of introductions.
Results: We tested 3,953 persons: 40% Latinx; 41% White; 9% Asian/Pacific Islander; and 2% Black. Overall,
2.1% (83/3,871) tested PCR-positive: 95% were Latinx and 52% asymptomatic when tested. 1.7% of residents
and 6.0% of workers (non-census tract residents) were PCR-positive. Among 2,598 census tract residents,
estimated point prevalence of PCR-positives was 2.3% (95%CI: 1.2-3.8%): 3.9% (95%CI: 2.0-6.4%) among Latinx
vs. 0.2% (95%CI: 0.0-0.4%) among non-Latinx persons. Estimated cumulative incidence among residents was
6.1% (95%CI: 4.0-8.6%). Prior infections were 67% Latinx, 16% White, and 17% other ethnicities. Among recent
infections, 96% were Latinx. Risk factors for recent infection were Latinx ethnicity, inability to shelter-in-place
and maintain income, frontline service work, unemployment, and household income <$50,000/year. Five
SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic lineages were detected.
Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 infections from diverse lineages continued circulating among low-income, Latinx
persons unable to work from home and maintain income during San Francisco’s shelter-in-place ordinance.

Introduction
In early 2020, multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the United States laid the foundation for the
ongoing epidemic that has claimed over 100,000 U.S. lives in less than 6 months.1 Some of the earliest clinical
cases of COVID-19 were recognized in California,2 and the state led the nation in issuing a state-wide shelterin-place mandate on March 19.3 San Francisco declared a local emergency on February 25 and issued a series
of increasingly restrictive mandates on sizes of gatherings culminating in a shelter-in place order on March 16.
Although peak hospitalization and death rates in San Francisco over the ensuing month were nearly 10-fold
lower than hard-hit cities such as New York,4 the pattern of disproportionately higher hospitalizations among
communities of color was similar.5 In San Francisco, 45% of reported COVID-19 cases are among Latinx people,
who represent 15% of the city’s population.6
Hospitalizations and deaths represent a small fraction of the total SARS-CoV-2 infections in a
community.7 Estimates of the burden of community SARS-CoV-2 infections from direct measurements have
been difficult to obtain and compare because symptomatic testing programs capture only a proportion of
cases,8 the recognized symptoms associated with COVID-19 expanded over time,9 the assays used to identify
infection have variable performance characteristics, and easily accessible testing programs are not in place for
some of the most highly affected communities. Data on community transmission and ethnic disparities in
SARS-CoV-2 infection, as opposed to COVID-19 disease10, as well as systematic efforts to determine factors
driving these disparities remain limited.11
To characterize ongoing community transmission during a citywide shelter-in-place mandate, we
offered population-based, universal testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection to all residents of a densely-populated
census tract within a majority Latinx community in San Francisco.

Methods
Unidos en Salud is a longitudinal study to characterize SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology and assess impact of
public health measures within a US census tract in San Francisco. Six-weeks into the city’s shelter-in-place
ordinance, we offered SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and antibody testing, regardless of
symptoms, to residents (>4 years) and people who work but may not reside in the census tract.

Study Setting and Community Mobilization
U.S. census tract 022901 is a population-dense, 16-square-block (0.1 square-mile) area in San
Francisco’s Mission District, with 5,174 residents of whom 58% are Latinx, 34% White/Caucasian, 5%
Asian/Pacific Islander, and 1% Black/African American. Median per capita income was $40,420/year in 2018,
with 34% of households earning <$50,000/year and 20% earning >$200,000/year.12 In partnership with the
Latino Task Force for COVID-19, an umbrella organization coordinating local Latinx community-based
organizations, we distributed flyers, mobilized the community on local and social media, and offered online
and door-to-door pre-registration for testing appointments during the week prior to the testing campaign.

Testing Campaign
From April 25-28, 2020, we offered outdoor testing at public parks and schools to those who provided
an address in the tract or worked in the tract. On April 28, we expanded eligibility to residents of neighboring
city blocks, responding to high community demand. One week later, we offered testing to home-bound
residents who could not reach campaign sites. During pre-registration, we conducted a brief survey. At the
time of testing, we obtained verbal consent for participation and conducted COVID-19 symptom screening.
Medical staff performed a fingerstick blood collection (500µL) for antibody testing and an oropharyngeal/midturbinate nasal swab for quantitative RT-PCR. Participants could opt out of either test. We contacted all PCRpositive persons to disclose results and perform a clinical assessment. We provided household support via a

community-led team for PCR-positive participants and evaluated symptoms among all PCR-positive
participants over 2 weeks following testing.

Laboratory assays
Swabs were collected in DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo Research) to inactivate virus and preserve RNA stability. RTPCR of viral N and E genes and human RNAse P gene was performed on extracted RNA at a CLIA-certified
laboratory operated by UCSF and the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub using a Laboratory Developed Test with a limit
of detection of log10 4.5 viral genome copies/mL. SARS-CoV-2-positive RNA samples were subjected to PrimalSeq Nextera XT version 2.0,13 using the ARTIC Network V3 primers,14 followed by paired-end 2 x 150bp
sequencing on an Illumina NovaSeq platform. For antibody testing, the ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG Emergency
Use Authorization (EUA) assay (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA)15 was performed on participants’
plasma from the fingerstick collections, which is a research use of the test.

Study Outcomes
Outcomes included the estimated point prevalence of all PCR-positive infections, recent infections
(PCR-positive/antibody-negative) and prior infections (antibody-positive/PCR-negative). Cumulative incidence
of infection was defined as any PCR or antibody-positive result. Phylogenetics were used to measure strain
diversity.

Statistical analyses
Proportions were compared using chi-squared tests and medians compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum
tests. Cumulative incidence of infection was adjusted for RT-PCR and antibody test characteristics; 95%
confidence intervals incorporating uncertainty in test characteristics were based on bootstrap. For census
tract residents, we further adjusted for differences in age, sex, and race/ethnicity of participants compared to

2018 census estimates (Supplementary Methods). We used multivariate logistic regression for the dependent
outcome of PCR-positivity among participants tested. We did not adjust confidence intervals for multiple
testing.

Bioinformatics and genomic analyses
A phylogenetic tree was constructed containing all 123 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from San Francisco County on
GISAID16 on May 22, 2020 together with the high-quality consensus genomes assembled from this study, using
the nextstrain toolkit.17 Global clade identification and naming follows the Nextstrain proposal,18 and
significance of population structure was computed by a permutation test was used for Hudson's FST

Ethics Statement & Funding
The UCSF Committee on Human Research determined that the study met criteria for public health
surveillance. The study was supported by the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, UCSF, and a Program for Breakthrough
Biomedical Research award. ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 test kits were provided by Abbott Laboratories.

Results
Testing Uptake and Coverage
From April 25-28, 2020, we tested 3,913 people. From May 6-7, we tested an additional 40 homebound residents, for a total of 3,953 persons tested. Of all persons tested, 53% were male, and 40% identified
as Latinx, 41% White, 9% Asian/Pacific Islander, 2% Black, and 7% other/mixed ethnicity (Table 1). Estimated
census tract testing coverage of adult residents (age >20 years) was 60%.

SARS-CoV-2 Infection by PCR testing
Among 3,871 tested by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, 2.1% (83 people) tested PCR-positive: 1.7% (43/2,598;
95%CI: 1.2%-2.2%) of census tract residents, 6.0% (27/450; 95%CI: 4.0%-8.6%) of tract workers and 1.6%
(13/823; 95%CI: 0.8%-2.7%) of residents of neighboring city blocks. Among all persons tested, 237 (6.1%)
reported symptoms compatible with COVID-19 of whom 31 (13.1%) tested PCR-positive.
Among PCR-positive persons, 95% identified as Latinx, median age was 38 years (interquartile range
[IQR]: 28-50 years), and 76% were male. Persons testing PCR-positive were significantly more likely than
persons testing PCR-negative to identify as Latinx, report inability to shelter-in-place and maintain income,
work frontline-service jobs or be unemployed, and live in households with income <$50,000/year and >3
persons/household (Table 2). Given that 95% of PCR-positive persons were Latinx, we limited our multivariate
model to Latinx participants to evaluate risk factors for PCR-positivity within this group, and found significantly
higher odds of PCR-positive infection if male (OR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.1-3.6, p=0.02), working a frontline service job
(OR: 2.6, 95% CI: 1.4-5.1, p=0.004, ref: non-frontline), household income <$50,000/year (OR: 8.9, 95% CI: 1.9158, p=0.03, ref: >$100,000/year), or reporting a COVID-19 contact (OR: 3.6, 95%CI: 2.0-6.3, p<0.001).
Estimated point prevalence of PCR-positive infection in the census tract after adjusting for age and sex
of participants in the testing campaign versus census demographics was 2.3% (95% CI: 1.2%-3.8%): 3.9%
(95%CI: 2.0%-6.4%) among Latinx vs. 0.2% (95%CI: 0.0%-0.4%) among non-Latinx tract residents. Among Latinx

people who worked in the census tract, unadjusted point prevalence of PCR-positive infection was 10.4% (95%
CI: 7.0%-14.8%), compared to 0.0% (95% CI: 0.0%-2.0%) among non-Latinx workers.

Clinical characteristics of PCR-positive persons
Among 83 PCR-positive persons, 43 (52%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing. Two-week followup was obtained for 41 participants who were asymptomatic at the time of testing: 8/41 (20%) recalled mild
symptoms that had resolved by the time of testing, 10 (24%) developed symptoms after testing (presymptomatic) and 23 (56%) remained asymptomatic. Based on reclassified symptom status among PCRpositive people, 39/80 (49%) were symptomatic at time of testing, 8 (10%) were previously symptomatic, 10
(12.5%) were pre-symptomatic, and 23 (29%) remained asymptomatic throughout infection. One PCR-positive
person (1.3%) required hospitalization.

SARS-CoV-2 Cumulative Incidence and Recent vs. Prior Infections
Among 3,861 participants tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 3.4% (131) tested Ab-positive: 3.1%
(80/2,545; 95%CI: 2.5%-3.9%) among census tract residents compared to 7.7% (34/442; 95%CI: 5.4%-10.6%)
among tract workers and 2.1% (17/829; 95%CI: 1.2%-3.3%) among adjacent city block residents. Estimated
cumulative incidence (Ab or PCR-positive) among tract residents was 4.4% (95% CI: 3.2%-5.6%) after adjusting
for test characteristics and 6.1% (95%CI: 4.0%-8.6%) after further adjusting for participation (Table S1).
Among all infections detected by PCR or Ab, 26% (48/182) were recent infection. 53% (96/182) were
prior infection. Of the remaining infections, 18% (32/182) were PCR-positive/Ab-positive, and 3% (6/182) had
PCR or antibody testing alone (Table S2). Compared to individuals with prior infection, people with recent
infection were significantly more likely to be of Latinx ethnicity, report inability to shelter-in-place and
maintain income, work frontline service jobs or be unemployed, and live in households with income

<$50,000/year (Table 3). Moreover, 47% vs. 89% of prior vs. recent infections, respectively, occurred in
households with income <$50,000/year (Table S2).

SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels and phylogenetic analysis
Median levels of virus as estimated by RT-PCR cycle thresholds were significantly higher among PCRpositive/Ab-negative persons compared to PCR-positive/antibody-positive persons, supporting our
classification of recent infection (Figure 1). Among recently-infected individuals, median levels of virus by RTPCR cycle threshold did not differ significantly between symptomatic (24, IQR: 19-25, range 11-35; N=27) and
asymptomatic (24, IQR: 19-26, range 16-32; N=10; p=0.98) persons (Figure 1); additional comparisons by
subgroup are in Figure S1.
We recovered SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 59% (49/83) of the PCR-positive RNA samples. The recovered
genomes were diverse and phylogenetically intermixed with samples from across San Francisco, including
representatives from five globally circulating clades, showing multiple independent introductions (Figure 2,
Panel A). Overall, 58% of PCR-positive participants shared a home with another PCR-positive participant
identified in the testing campaign: sequences from such households were consistent with within-household
transmission (Figure 2, Panel B), with no variants detected in 65% of household links (N = 11/17, 95% CI 41%83%). We found no significant population structure separating the Mission district samples from the rest of
San Francisco (p=0.19).

Discussion
We found stark ethnic and economic disparities in who is at risk for ongoing infection six-weeks into
San Francisco’s shelter-in-place ordinance. The estimated point prevalence of PCR-positive infection among
Latinx residents (3.9%) was twenty times that of non-Latinx residents (0.2%). Perhaps even more striking was
that recent infections were concentrated almost exclusively among low-income, Latinx people working
frontline jobs, whereas prior infections occurred among more ethnically and economically diverse individuals.
In addition, the majority of PCR-positive infections were asymptomatic at the time of testing, and recently
infected individuals had high levels of virus regardless of symptoms. These data show that San Francisco’s
COVID-19 epidemic has continuing transmission in subgroups of the city population that require urgent
attention.
Heterogeneity among populations most affected by the COVID-19 epidemic exists across the U.S.,
within states and cities, and even within neighborhoods as shown here. Population-level epidemiologic data
coupled with phylogenetic analyses can help identify, track and inform testing strategies, public health policies
and measures to mitigate health and economic effects. Low-barrier, community-mobilized testing is
foundational to these efforts. We sought to overcome testing barriers in this census tract through our
partnership with the community-led Latino Task Force in San Francisco, who provided trusted explanations
about COVID-19 and messaging on the importance of testing to the community. Through this approach, we
were able to test a large proportion of the population in a short period of time.
We determined that during shelter-in-place, COVID-19 transmission became increasingly concentrated
in Latinx community members. The risk factors driving recent transmission among Latinx residents were
largely economic and highly correlated: low-income residents working frontline jobs who could not shelter-inplace and maintain their income. Transmission was amplified in Latinx multi-generational and multi-family
households – a byproduct of skyrocketing rental costs in the city. These economic drivers and ethnic

disparities observed at the community level here are reflected in COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths widely
reported in the US.10,20

We observed high sequence diversity of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the census tract, similar to the
diversity seen in San Francisco more broadly, suggestive of multiple independent introductions over time. Our
data suggest that most recent infections during shelter-in-place are due to acquisition of virus when working
or seeking work in the census tract, with subsequent within-home transmission in high-density, low-income
households. These findings should help dispel common, dangerous pitfalls in interpreting ethnic disparities in
infection, such as biological explanations, supposed community behaviors or stigmatizing communities as
transmission “hot spots” about which others have cautioned.11
Our results also highlight the importance of SARS-CoV-2 testing in both symptomatic and
asymptomatic individuals. Symptom-based testing would have failed to detect over 40% of PCR-positive
infections in this community, many of whom had high levels of virus. Overall, 29% of PCR-positive infections
never developed symptoms, slightly lower than the proportion found (43%) in a population-based SARS-CoV-2
screening study from Iceland.21 In our study, recently infected people had high levels of virus that did not
differ significantly based on symptoms. In addition, only one infected individual required hospitalization,
suggesting the vast majority would not have been diagnosed without community-based testing. The clear
implication of these findings is that testing strategies limited to symptomatic individuals and those seeking
testing at health centers alone, will fail to limit transmission.
These results have several implications moving forward as shelter-in-place restrictions are lifted. First,
more efforts are needed to address uncontrolled epidemics among sub-populations, especially vulnerable
populations such as the Latinx community highlighted here. Expanded targeted, but community-led and
mobilized, low-barrier testing not based on symptoms is needed. Testing need to be coupled with social
protection of job security and economic support for self-isolation and quarantine (i.e. “test and respond”) and

culturally responsive contact tracing. Our testing campaign contributed to policy change in San Francisco, with
the mayor announcing on May 4, 2020 that essential workers would be eligible for free SARS-CoV-2 testing
regardless of symptoms,22 and then on May 28, 2020 that low-wage workers with COVID-19 would be
provided funds to stay home and isolate (“Right to Recover”).23 In parallel, longitudinal, population-based
cohorts that couple epidemiologic data with PCR and antibody testing and viral sequencing can provide
evidence of effectiveness of public health measures and viral introductions over time, enabling evidencebased responses in a dynamic landscape.
Our study has several limitations. SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests do not detect all cases and antibody sensitivity
may be lower in asymptomatic infection which could have resulted in underestimation of cumulative
incidence. False positive antibody results could result in overestimation of cumulative incidence and
misclassification of prior infections. Fingerstick sampling could also impact antibody test performance.
However, the EUA antibody test we used has been shown to have a high sensitivity (96.9-100%) at ≥17-22
days post symptom onset, and high specificity (≥99.6%) with venous drawn plasma,24,25 and our estimates of
cumulative incidence accounted for sensitivity and specificity of the PCR and antibody assays used. Second,
selection bias in who chose to test may have affected our estimates. Although we adjusted for demographic
differences between participants and community composition based on 2018 American Community Survey
data, these data may not fully reflect tract demographics in 2020. However, population-based testing in a
census tract allowed for greater clarity in understanding who did not participate. Lastly, we relied on selfreported symptoms and survey responses, which may have resulted in misclassification. With follow-up of
PCR-positive participants over two weeks, we were able to further explore symptom status, allowing for
monitoring and reclassification.
In conclusion, improving access to SARS-CoV-2 testing, regardless of symptoms, through communityled, low-barrier testing programs in vulnerable communities, coupled with economic support and protections

Mission district samples (red) and other San Francisco samples (grey), x-axis marks the number of mutations
with respect to the reference genome from Wuhan. Yellow arrows mark introductions of five major global
clades (right brackets) to the study population. Panel B: tree subset to Mission district samples. Shape
indicates district resident or worker and color indicates antibody status. Households with multiple PCRpositive persons are drawn in green and include markers for samples from which genomes could not be
recovered. Asterisk marks a household outside of the district in which an unhoused person in the district spent

Supplementary Methods: Statistical approach to point estimates and 95% Confidence intervals for cumulative
incidence, adjusted for test characteristics and sample participation
Overview of Approach
We take as our target of inference the cumulative probability of infection by SAR-COV-2 up to three days prior
to the testing period.
Cumulative incidence unadjusted for test characteristics is estimated as the empirical proportion of participants
with either a positive antibody test, a positive PCR test, or both. Corresponding unadjusted 95% CIs are
estimated using an exact binomial approach. In this supplement, we describe the approach used to adjust both
the point estimate and 95% CI to account for imperfect test sensitivity and specificity, as well as uncertainty in
the estimates of these test characteristics. We further describe how, among census tract residents, additional
adjustment for demographic differences between 2018 census tract composition (Manson, 2019) and study
participation is incorporated. Uncertainty due to both forms of adjustment is estimated based on a bootstrapbased approach, related to the methods described in Bendavid, et al (2020), Cherain (2020), and Gelman (2020),
and described in further detail below.
Use of the bootstrap approach requires estimates of test sensitivity and specificity, together with measures of the
uncertainty in those estimates. Because our estimate of cumulative incidence is based on a composite outcome
of two assays (PCR and antibody), we thus require an estimate of the specificity and sensitivity of the
composite test and corresponding uncertainty estimates.
Estimation of specificity (and uncertainty of estimate) for composite cumulative incidence outcome.
Specificity of the composite testing outcome (Antibody-positive or PCR-positive) can be estimated based on
estimates of each of these tests in turn. For PCR specificity, we use data from a recent study in Bolinas in which
1845/1845 persons tested with the identical PCR assays under identical conditions tested negative. Determining
specificity requires knowledge of the true number of uninfected persons, which is unknown but very unlikely to
be less than 18271, PCR point estimate specificity is estimated using a conservative approach applied to these
data: 0.51/1827 = 99.96% (Marill, 2017). For Antibody specificity, we use test characteristics provided by the
manufacturer in the FDA package insert, in which 1066/1070 persons tested negative, implying a specificity
point estimate of 99.63% (95% CI: 99.05%, 99.90%).
We assume that for an uninfected person, the probability of a negative PCR test is independent of the
probability of a negative Antibody test, so joint specificity = PCR specificity * Antibody specificity. Together,
these data provide a point estimate of the specificity of testing Antibody-positive and/or PCR-positive of
99.59% (95% CI 99.16%, 99.91%). The confidence interval is generated by a bootstrap procedure:
1. Repeat 5000 times:
a. Create a vector of 1827 Bernoulli variables with probability of correct 0.51/1827. Take a bootstrap
sample of size 1827 with replacement (Marill, 2017)
b. Take an independent bootstrap sample of 1066 correct and 4 incorrect.
c. The joint result is correct if both bootstrap samples are correct.
2. Find the 2.5th and 97.5th quantile of the joint result.
1

1827 true negatives (18 true negatives) would represent a true recent prevalence of 1% in Bolinas. Even if
sensitivity is 30% and specificity is 100%, the probability of zero test positives in Bolinas given 18 true
positives is less than 0.2%. If sensitivity is higher or specificity is lower, the probability of zero test positives in
Bolinas is even lower.

Estimation of sensitivity (and uncertainty of estimate) for composite cumulative incidence outcome.
Estimation of the sensitivity of the composite test (i.e., probability of testing Antibody-positive and/or PCRpositive given an infection up to three days before testing) is considerably more complex for several reasons.
- First, sensitivity varies profoundly for both assays as a function of time since infection. Based on current
best available data, PCR sensitivity likely peaks around Day 8 after infection (~Day 3 after symptom onset),
and declines quickly; however, it remains greater than 0 for at least three weeks after infection (Kucirka, et
al, 2020). Antibody sensitivity may be zero (0 positive, 4 negative) during the first two days of symptoms,
then increases to close to perfect sensitivity (88 positive, 0 negative) after day 14 following symptom onset
(per FDA package insert). In estimates below, we use these sources for estimated time-varying assayspecific sensitivity. We further assume a sensitivity of zero in the initial three days following infection. Any
individuals in our sample who were infected within the three days prior to testing and tested PCR-positive
on PCR will thus contribute to an overestimate of cumulative incidence; however, the impact of such events,
if any, is expected to be very small.
- Second, because assay sensitivity varies by time, the sensitivity of the combined composite assay on any
given calendar date depends on the distribution of time since infection on that date among persons who have
been infected with SARS-COV-2 in the underlying population. This distribution in turn depends on the
epidemic course to date in the underlying population. For example, high early growth rates followed by
lower recent growth rates will increase the proportion of true positives with longstanding infection; recent
high growth rates will increase the proportion of true positives who have been recently infected. The true
historical underlying growth rate in this population is unknown. Here, we assume a set of time-varying
growth rates generally consistent with regional hospitalization curves, and perform sensitivity analysis
under variations in these assumed rates.
- Third, available data on time dependent-sensitivity curves have, to date, been drawn almost exclusively
from symptomatic individuals. It is possible that sensitivity for either or both assays may be lower among
asymptomatic persons. In the absence of data, we assume equivalent time-specific sensitivity among
symptomatic and asymptomatic persons for each assay. The approach presented can be readily adopted (and
we provide code to do so) if additional data on differential sensitivity become available.
With these basic assumptions, we implement the following approach to estimating the sensitivity of the joint
testing outcome, together with uncertainty.
Repeat 5000 times:
1. Calculate Antibody sensitivity:
a. For Antibody sensitivity by day since symptoms, sample with replacement using data from
the FDA insert for days 1-13 of symptoms: (0/4 positive antibody tests on days 1-2 of
symptoms; 2/8 positive antibody tests on days 3-7 of symptoms; 19/22 positive antibody tests
on days 8-13 of symptoms).
b. For day ≥14 of symptoms, the FDA insert reports 88/88 positive antibody tests2. Create a
vector of 88 Bernoulli variables with probability of correct 0.51/88. Take a bootstrap sample
of size 88 with replacement (Marill, 2017)
c. Antibody sensitivity by day since symptoms is estimated as the mean of the bootstrap sample
2. Calculate PCR sensitivity
a. For PCR sensitivity by day since infection, we use the results of Kucirka et al (2020), posted
on https://github.com/HopkinsIDD/covidRTPCR. Sample one of the 5000 posterior draws of
2

In the package insert it is noted: “Five specimens from 1 immunocompromised patient were excluded from the
study. … When the results from these specimens were included, the PPA at ≥ 14 days post-symptom onset was
96.77% (95% CI: 90.86, 99.33).”

these results. Kucirka, et al provide estimates of PCR sensitivity from day 1 to 21 since
infection.
b. We assume sensitivity on day 31 is zero and use linear interpolation to estimate PCR
sensitivity on days 22 to 30.
Assume that infections start on Feb 20, grow 23% per day (R0 ~ 3.5), and that the growth rate than
decreases linearly starting March 7 to 5% per day on March 23 (Re ~ 1.2), reflecting the imposition
of a Shelter In Place ordinance in San Francisco. These reproductive numbers are supported by
fitting an SEIR model to San Francisco hospitalization data. Calculate the fraction of infections by
day under these growth rates. Assume that symptoms start on 5th day of infection (as in Kucirka, et
al).
Assume that for a truly infected person, the probability of a positive PCR test is independent of the
probability of a positive Antibody test. Then joint sensitivity by day since infection = PCR
sensitivity + Antibody sensitivity - PCR sensitivity * Antibody sensitivity
As noted above, we take as our target of inference cumulative probability of infection by SAR-COV2 up to three days prior to the testing period, and thus assume sensitivity of zero in the initial three
days following infection. Kucirka, et al estimate sensitivity of less than 0.01% on day 1, 0.4% on day
2, 6.6% on day 3, but confidence intervals include zero on all three days.
Joint sensitivity integrated over days since infection is calculated by summing the product of fraction
of infections by day and joint sensitivity by day.

The 5000 repetitions give a mean joint sensitivity of the combined Antibody and PCR assays of 88.4% with a
standard deviation of 2.4%. Only this final mean and standard deviation are used in all adjusted estimates in
main text of the paper. Because there were many assumptions in the estimation of these two quantities, we
conducted sensitivity analysis considering a range of point and variance estimates for composite test sensitivity;
results are shown in Table.
Bootstrap-based approach to adjust point estimate and confidence interval.
Given the above inputs – estimated sensitivity and corresponding 95% CI of the joint test, and specificity
estimates of the PCR and Antibody Tests with corresponding numbers of tests used to generate these estimates
– we implemented the following bootstrap-based procedure to adjust the point estimates and generate
confidence intervals accounting for uncertainty in test characteristics (and optionally allowing for adjustment
for participation).
For each bootstrap iteration j in 1 to 5000:
1. Draw composite test sensitivity, sensj, from a normal distribution with mean 88.4% and standard
deviation of 2.4%
2. Draw composite test specificity:
a. Create a vector of 1827 Bernoulli variables with probability of correct 0.51/1827. PCR specificity
= mean of a bootstrap sample of size 1827 with replacement. (Marill, 2017)
b. Antibody specificity = mean of a bootstrap sample of 1066 correct and 4 incorrect.
c. Composite test specificity = specj = PCR specificity * Antibody specificity
3. Draw H household at random (with replacement), and add all members of that household to the
bootstrap sample, where H is the total number of households. Define qgj as the proportion of people with
positive test results in the jth iteration in the race-sex-age cell g.
4. For each race-sex-age cell g, convert test results to expected rate of actual prevalence using the
following formula (Bendavid et al, 2020): pgj = max(0, (qgj + specj - 1) / (sensj + specj - 1))

Supplementary Methods: Bioinformatics and Genomic Analyses
Consensus genomes were generated by first using minimap21 to align raw reads to the reference genome
MN908947.3, then using samtools,2 mpileup and ivar3 to generate consensus genomes. We used the
augur/auspice4 toolkit with mafft,5 iqtree,6 and treetime7 to construct and visualize maximum likelihood
phylogenies. The inferred topology had a lower bound of 9 transmission events into and out of the Mission,
based on a min-cut separating the Mission district from other San Francisco samples. Branches on the
topology with zero inferred mutations were collapsed into polytomies for the min-cut analysis. To test for
population structure, we used the Python package scikit-allel to compute Hudson’s FST8 between the Mission
District study census tract and sequences from GISAID9 representing the rest of San Francisco (Supplemental
Table S3), including at most 1 sample per household (the first lexicographically), and including all variant sites
in the multiple alignment with at most 5 missing alleles. We failed to reject the null hypothesis of no
population structure, computing FST=.007 with a p-value of 0.192 based on a permutation test with 10,000
random rearrangements of the sample labels.
