Abstract
Background:
Little is known about long-term recovery from severe COVID-19 disease. Here, we characterize
overall health, physical health and mental health of patients one month after discharge for severe
COVID-19.
Methods:
This was a prospective single health system observational cohort study of patients ≥18 years
hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 disease who required at least 6 liters of
oxygen during admission, had intact baseline cognitive and functional status and were
discharged alive. Participants were enrolled between 30 and 40 days after discharge. Outcomes
were elicited through validated survey instruments: the PROMIS® Dyspnea Characteristics and
PROMIS® Global Health-10.
Results:
A total of 161 patients (40.6% of eligible) were enrolled; 152 (38.3%) completed the survey.
Median age was 62 years (interquartile range [IQR], 50-67); 57 (37%) were female. Overall,
113/152 (74%) participants reported shortness of breath within the prior week (median score 3
out of 10 [IQR 0-5]), vs. 47/152 (31%) pre-COVID-19 infection (0, IQR 0-1), p<0.001.
Participants also rated their physical health and mental health as worse in their post-COVID state
(43.8, standard deviation 9.3; mental health 47.3, SD 9.3) compared to their pre-COVID state,
(54.3, SD 9.3; 54.3, SD 7.8, respectively), both p <0.001. A total of 52/148 (35.1%) patients
without pre-COVID oxygen requirements needed home oxygen after hospital discharge; 20/148
(13.5%) reported still using oxygen at time of survey.

Patients with severe COVID-19 disease typically experience sequelae affecting their respiratory
status, physical health and mental health for at least several weeks after hospital discharge.

Introduction
The body of literature on the inpatient course of illness of COVID-19 has rapidly grown
over the past several months; however, little is known about the long-term recovery from severe
COVID-19 disease.1 COVID-19 is characterized by an unusual degree of hypoxia among
hospitalized patients, reports of delirium and encephalopathy, hypercoagulability and a much
higher intubation and death rate than comparable viral pneumonias.2-9 The extent to which
impacts on health persist after hospital discharge, however, is uncertain.
Anecdotal reports have described onset of pulmonary fibrosis in severely ill patients,5
which would be expected to cause long-term disability; however, only one study has
comprehensively assessed duration and severity of dyspnea after recovery.1 This study of 143
patients in Italy found that 43% of patients reported persistent dyspnea an average of 60 days
after symptom onset. Moreover, patients requiring mechanical ventilation have experienced
longer periods of intubation5 than is typical for infectious pneumonia, increasing risk for muscle
atrophy, delirium, pulmonary damage and long-term disability.10 Finally, anecdotes of
neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 disease even without mechanical ventilation, such as
encephalopathy and confusion, have been reported.7,11 Whether these manifestations persist postrecovery is also unknown.
Studying the long-term sequelae of COVID-19 disease is critical for understanding the
full natural history of disease, accurately predicting the cumulative impact of disease beyond
hospitalization and mortality, and determining whether inpatient or post discharge pulmonary
rehabilitation should be considered. Here, we characterize overall health status and the physical
and mental health of patients discharged home after severe COVID-19.

Methods
Study Cohort
This was a prospective single health system observational cohort study conducted at
NYU Langone Health. Eligible patients were those 18 years and older who required at least 6
liters of oxygen at any point during a hospitalization for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, who
were discharged alive to either home or a facility after April 15, 2020, and were still alive at the
time of study contact. We excluded patients with communication impairment or baseline
dementia. This was determined by chart review or if upon consent for this study, the patient was
unable to articulate the purpose of this study and what would be required of them to participate.
We also excluded patients discharged to hospice, patients who resided in long-term care prehospitalization, patients fully dependent in activities of daily living pre-hospitalization, and
patients that opted out of research.
We used the electronic health record to identify consecutive discharges within the prior
30-40 days. Trained study personnel manually reviewed each patient’s chart to verify eligibility.
Eligible patients were then called to solicit interest in the study. Interested patients were
consented and enrolled over the phone. After informed consent was obtained, the study survey
(Appendix) was either conducted by study personnel with the patient over the phone or
independently online by the patient, per the patient’s preference. If the patient was not English
speaking, the survey was conducted over the phone with interpretation services. NYU Grossman
School of Medicine’s Institutional Review Board approved the protocol.

Data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools12 hosted at
NYU Langone Health in order to minimize missing inputs and allow for real-time data validation
and quality control. The survey was designed to reinforce, but not require, responses to all items.
Missing individual item responses were not imputed other than as described below for the
PROMIS® Dyspnea Characteristics instrument.
Outcomes were elicited through validated PROMIS® (Patient-Reported Outcomes
Measurement Information System) survey instruments (Appendix). PROMIS® is a program
developed by the National Institutes of Health that provides rigorous measures of patientreported outcomes for use in clinical studies in patients and in the general population.13 It affords
comparability, reliability and validity, flexibility, and inclusiveness across a range of patients and
diagnoses.14
To evaluate the degree of residual pulmonary impairment, we used the PROMIS®
Dyspnea Characteristics instrument (Appendix).15 This is a five-item instrument that assesses
quantitative and qualitative descriptions of a person’s experience of dyspnea. The first four items
use a 0-10 numeric rating scale (where 0 represents no shortness of breath and 10 represents the
worst possible shortness of breath) and the last item uses a five-point Likert scale. The first item
asks participants to rate their shortness of breath in general. If the participant has no shortness of
breath, the instrument stops there and items 2-3 are assigned a score of 0, and item 5 is assigned
a score of 1. If the participant reports shortness of breath, we asked the remaining four items,
which address the intensity, frequency, duration and severity of dyspnea. This instrument was
administered twice during the survey: once asking patients to reflect on their shortness of breath
in the last seven days and then again to reflect on their shortness of breath before they had
COVID-19. Items in this instrument were scored individually.

To evaluate overall health status and mental health, we used the PROMIS® Global
Health-10 instrument (Appendix).16 This is a 10-item standardized psychometric instrument that
measures an individual’s overall physical, mental, and social health. Each item is converted to a
five-point scale, in which higher scores indicate better health. Physical and mental health
summary scores are produced using four items each. Raw scores for these domains are converted
to normed t-scores. These scores are standardized such that a score of 50 (10) represents the
mean (standard deviation) for the United States general population. The remaining two items are
on general health and how well social activities are carried out; these items are scored
individually. As with the PROMIS® Dyspnea Characteristics instrument, we administered the
Global Health-10 instrument twice, first asking patients to reflect on how they felt in the past
seven days and then again to reflect on how they felt before they became ill with COVID-19.
Statistical Analyses
We used descriptive statistics to illustrate patient characteristics. To make bivariate
comparisons of symptoms before and after COVID-19 and account for paired data, we utilized
the Wilcoxon signed rank test for ordinal data comparisons and the paired t-test for normally
distributed linear data comparisons. Pairwise comparisons were made with patients who had
responded to items reflecting on their experience both before and after COVID-19. For scorebased analyses, patients with incomplete surveys were excluded from the calculation of total
scores. We also conducted a subgroup analysis of patients who had shortness of breath prior to
COVID-19, comparing their shortness of breath severity before and after COVID-19.
Data were analyzed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All analyses were
two-tailed and we treated a p value of <0.05 as significant.

Results
Study Participation and Cohort Characteristics
We screened 538 COVID-19 discharges identified through the electronic health record.
Of these, 137 were deemed ineligible (Figure). Of the remaining 397 eligible discharges, 135
could not be reached, 94 declined to participate, 7 were rehospitalized and too sick to participate,
and 161 patients enrolled, of whom 152 completed the survey. Patients who were eligible but not
enrolled were of similar age as those who consented (median age 64 years [interquartile range
57-72] vs 62 years [IQR 50-67]), had similar median length of stay (17 days [IQR 10-37] vs 18
days [IQR 10-31]), similar intensive care unit use (101 [43.4%] vs 73 [45.3%]), and similar need
for mechanical ventilation (86 [36.9%] vs 59 [36.7]). However, patients who were eligible but
not enrolled were less likely to speak English (153 [65.7%] vs 125 [77.6%]), more likely to need
an interpreter (53 [23.0%] vs 30 [18.8%]), more likely to have Medicare insurance (103 [44.2%]
vs 55 [34.2%]), less likely to have received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during
hospitalization (8 [3.4%] vs 13 [8.1%]), and more likely to be discharged home (133 [55.1%] )
compared to consented patients (73 [45.3%]) (Table 1).
Participants completed surveys at a median of 37 days (range 30-43) after hospital
discharge (equivalent to a median of 55 days (range 38-95) after hospital admission). Of those
who completed surveys, 56/152 (36.8%) required home oxygen on hospital discharge, of whom
52 (92.9%) reported home oxygen as a new requirement; 20/148 (13.5%) participants previously
not oxygen-dependent reported still requiring oxygen at the time of survey. For those with new
current oxygen use, most (16/20, 80%) reported needing 1-2 liters per minute of oxygen.

Most participants (137, 90.1%) had seen a medical professional since discharge. Slightly
more than half received visiting nurse services after hospital discharge; only one person reported
having these services prior to hospitalization. In contrast, only 27 (17.8%) reported receiving
home health aide services after hospital discharge; 5 (18.5%) participants in this group reported
HHA services prior to hospitalization. Only 9 (5.9%) reported an ED visit after hospital
discharge, and 3 (2.0%) reported hospital readmission.
Dyspnea Outcomes
At the time of survey, a total of 113 (74.3%) participants reported some shortness of
breath (median score 3 out of 10, IQR 0-5), compared to only 47 (30.9%) pre-COVID-19
infection (0, IQR 0-1), p<0.001. For those that did have shortness of breath prior to COVID-19,
intensity, frequency, and duration of the shortness of breath worsened after COVID-19 (Table
2). In addition, more patients reported feeling short of breath “quite a bit” and “very much” in the
past 7 days (18 [11.8%]) compared to before COVID-19 infection (4 [2.6%], p=0.028).
Overall Health, Physical Health and Mental Health
The PROMIS® Global Health-10 instrument scores indicated worse general health after
COVID-19 illness (3 out of 5, IQR 2-4) compared to baseline (4, IQR 3-5). Before COVID-19,
participants’ summary t-scores in both the physical health and mental health domains were
slightly above the United States mean of 50 (54.3, standard deviation 9.3; 54.3 SD 7.8,
respectively). One month after COVID-19 infection, both scores were significantly lower
(physical health: 43.8, SD 9.3; mental health 47.3, SD 9.3; p<0.001 for both). For the physical
health score, this represents a decline of more than a full standard deviation. Patients also

reported worsened ability to carry out social activities after COVID-19 (p<0.001). Table 2
further details these outcomes.

Discussion
In our prospective single health system observational cohort study examining postdischarge outcomes of patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19, we found that patients began
with overall health slightly better than the United States average, and typically did not have
shortness of breath prior to hospitalization for COVID-19. However, almost three quarters of
patients reported persistent shortness of breath more than a month post-hospital discharge. For
those who had shortness of breath prior to COVID-19, the intensity, frequency, and duration of
the shortness of breath worsened after COVID-19. In addition, physical health and mental health
were both rated as worse than baseline even one month after hospital discharge.
While anecdotal reports in the lay press have described patients with COVID-19 sequelae
lasting for several weeks,17-19 our study confirms that this is the case for the great majority of
patients who suffer from severe COVID-19 illness, not just isolated cases. The World Health
Organization estimates that the median time from onset of disease to recovery of severe COVID19 is about 3-6 weeks, based on early data from China.20 However, three quarters of our patients
had persistent dyspnea at 7-9 weeks after onset of disease (median of 55 days after hospital
admission, which in turn typically occurs 5-10 days after symptom onset). Recent data from Italy
examining post-discharge outcomes similarly indicate persistent dyspnea in 43% of patients an
average of two months after symptom onset.1 Our cohort by design was more likely to have

experienced intensive care or mechanical ventilation than the Italian cohort, likely explaining the
higher prevalence of persistent dyspnea in our study.
Given the high incidence of intensive care unit stays and long hospitalizations associated
with these cases, these patients are at risk for post-intensive care syndrome21,22 and post-hospital
syndrome.23 This has serious implications for the ability to return to work, downstream effects on
mental health due to sometimes drastic lifestyle and work capacity changes (most notably
persistent shortness of breath), and the ability to engage in activities or hobbies enjoyed prior to
COVID-19 illness.
Prior work examining post-discharge outcomes in acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) demonstrate that while pulmonary function may recover, especially in relatively young
patients, many experience reduced physical quality of life even at 5 years after their critical
illness.24-26 Another study examining long-term outcomes in Influenza A (H7N9) survivors
demonstrated improvement in pulmonary function and imaging findings during the first six
months after hospital discharge but showed that impairment to quality of life persisted even at 2
years post-discharge.27
At this time, the permanence of reported symptoms for COVID-19 survivors is unclear;
however, these early results are worrisome. Furthermore, we observed significant psychological
distress in study participants, almost 20% of whom live alone. Given these findings,
interventions after discharge may be needed to speed recovery.28 As shortness of breath may
affect ability to complete activities of daily living, services to support these individuals during
the post-discharge transition such as home health aide care should be arranged. Interventions for
preventing and treating post-intensive care and post-hospital syndrome should also be

considered. Pulmonary-specific interventions such as pulmonary rehabilitation should be
explored.
Strengths and Limitations
Our study provides a novel contribution characterizing early post-discharge outcomes in
patients who have experienced severe COVID-19 disease. In addition, immigrant communities in
New York City were hit particularly hard with COVID-19 and our study included patients from
diverse backgrounds, with no language exclusions: nearly one in five patients in our study
completed the survey through an interpreter. However, it has some limitations. Our survey does
not include objective measures of pulmonary function. We compared current state to selfreported pre-COVID state, which may be subject to recall bias; however, this would not affect
the post-COVID findings. We also specifically studied the experience of sicker patients---those
who required hospitalization and at least 6 liters of oxygen during admission; our results are not
generalizable to those with mild COVID-19. Of note, our results may underestimate the severity
of post-discharge symptoms among those with severe COVID-19, as we excluded frail elders,
people with dementia, and patients from or eligible for long-term care, who might be expected to
have worse outcomes, and were unable to reach several patients who had been rehospitalized.
Self-reported utilization outcomes such as readmission may also be underreported.29 Longerterm outcomes are still unknown. Generalizability may be limited by its single health system
design; however, our health system does encompass multiple hospitals across urban and
suburban settings, and our patient population was markedly diverse.

The initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic has taxed our healthcare system’s capacity
to deliver acute and critical care. Prior work examining the long-term sequelae of severe ARDS
has demonstrated deleterious effects on pulmonary function and health status even several years
after disease onset.25,26 We found that survivors of severe COVID-19 experience shortness of
breath, and worsened physical and mental health more than a month after hospital discharge.
Whether these harms will persist is presently unknown. Regardless, it is clear that the individual
and social impact of disease is more substantial than would be suggested by hospitalization and
mortality rates alone. Given the volume of patients affected by this disease, plans to care for
these patients longitudinally must be considered.
