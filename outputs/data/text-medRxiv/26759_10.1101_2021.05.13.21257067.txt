Abstract

18

Background: Contact tracing is one of the key interventions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic

19

but its implementation varies widely across countries. There is little guidance on how to monitor

20

contact tracing performance, and no systematic overview of indicators to assess contact tracing

21

systems or conceptual framework for such indicators exists to date.

22

Methods: We conducted a rapid scoping review using a systematic literature search strategy in the

23

peer-reviewed and grey literature as well as open source online documents. We developed a

24

conceptual framework to map indicators by type (input, process, output, outcome, impact) and

25

thematic area (human resources, financial resources, case investigation, contact identification,

26

contact testing, contact follow up, case isolation, contact quarantine, transmission chain

27

interruption, incidence reduction).

28

Results: We identified a total of 153 contact tracing indicators from 1,555 peer-reviewed studies, 894

29

studies from grey literature sources, and 15 sources from internet searches. Two-thirds of indicators

30

were process indicators (102; 67%), while 48 (31%) indicators were output indicators. Only three

31

(2%) indicators were input indicators. Indicators covered seven out of ten conceptualized thematic

32

areas, with more than half being related to either case investigation (37; 24%) or contact

33

identification (44; 29%). There were no indicators for the input area “financial resources”, the

34

outcome area “transmission chain interruption”, and the impact area “incidence reduction”.

35

Conclusions: Almost all identified indicators were either process or output indicators focusing on

36

case investigation, contact identification, case isolation or contact quarantine. We identified

37

important gaps in input, outcome and impact indicators, which constrains evidence-based

38

assessment of contact tracing systems. A universally agreed set of indicators is needed to allow for

39

cross-system comparisons and to improve the performance of contact tracing systems.

Background

41

Contact tracing has become one of the key interventions in response to the coronavirus disease 2019

42

(COVID-19) pandemic in many countries, and is considered an indispensable outbreak response

43

activity to reduce new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections (1,

44

2). Contact tracing systems for SARS-CoV-2 aim to interrupt transmission chains by investigating

45

people who had contact with a probable or confirmed case, and quarantining or isolating infected

46

and exposed individuals in a timely manner, thereby reducing the occurrence of future transmission

47

events (3). While identifying and notifying contacts is a core part of contact tracing, other closely

48

related activities like case investigation, testing of contacts, and case isolation and quarantining of

49

contacts, are commonly understood to be part of contact tracing (4).

50

The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends contact tracing for persons with

51

exposure to a probable or confirmed case during the infectious period, defined as face to face

52

contact within one meter for 15 minutes or more, or direct physical contact regardless of duration.

53

The infectious period is defined as two days before until ten days after symptom onset for

54

symptomatic cases, and two days before until ten days after a positive test for asymptomatic cases

55

(3). The implementation of contact tracing and related activities varies widely across countries

56

depending on local public health guidance and resources. For example, prioritization of high-risk

57

contacts according to risk classification is often done in high burden settings and/or low-resource

58

contexts, e.g. by focusing on household members or other close contacts, contacts exposed during

59

crowded or closed settings, or contacts exposed to cases at the peak of their infectiousness (3).

60

Similarly, local guidance varies on whether or not all contacts should be tested or whether only

61

selective testing of close contacts should be done, and whether or not quarantine is recommended

62

or compulsory, and whether it is organized at designated facilities or at the contacts’ home (2, 5).

63

Despite contact tracing having a pivotal role in the COVID-19 response, there is little guidance on

64

how to monitor and assess performance of contact tracing systems, a gap that was identified early in

65

the global pandemic (6, 7). In particular, no agreed upon or standardized indicators exist to date at

66

global or regional level to assess and monitor the performance and quality of contact tracing systems

67

for COVID-19 (5), which makes it impossible to assess performance over time and to identify

68

benchmarks across similar settings (8). While several contact tracing indicators have recently been

69

proposed both in the peer-reviewed literature as well as in non-peer reviewed documents online,

70

this often occurs without any conceptual framing or systematic development and selection of

71

indicators.

72

No systematic overview of indicators proposed for the assessment of contact tracing systems during

73

the COVID-19 pandemic and no conceptual framework to map and identify gaps in the proposed

74

indicators exist to date (3). This gap, identified already during the WHO consultation workshop in

75

June 2020 (7), hinders the development of a more comprehensive monitoring and evaluation

76

framework, thus ultimately impeding the improvement of contact tracing for COVID-19.

77

We aimed to close this gap by undertaking a systematic scoping review. Our objective was to

78

systematically scope the peer-reviewed and grey literature as well as other online resources for

79

indicators that can be used to assess the performance of COVID-19 contact tracing systems, and to

80

propose a conceptual framework for contact tracing indicators during the COVID-19 pandemic.

81

Understanding the current landscape of proposed contact tracing indicators and to establish a

82

conceptual framework for these indicators is a prerequisite towards the development of an

83

evaluation tool built on a core set of indicators for the systematic reporting of COVID-19 contact

84

tracing activities across countries.

85

Methods

86

We conducted a rapid scoping review using a systematic literature search strategy with the aim to

87

understand the landscape of contact tracing indicators for COVID-19. The design, conduct, and

88

reporting of this study was guided by the WHO guidance on rapid reviews (9) and the PRISMA

89

Extension for Scoping Reviews (10). The study protocol was registered in the international

90

prospective register PROSPERO prior to starting data collection (ref no CRD42020218057).

91

While the search process included locating literature in the three core health sciences databases

92

PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, our search also relied heavily on grey literature sources. The

93

searched grey literature sources ranged from the search engine Google to government COVID-19

94

literature repositories such as the United States National Institutes of Health’s iSearch COVID-19

95

Portfolio, to collections of curated literature from international repositories such as WHO’s GOARN

96

Contact Tracing Document Repository. A complete list of all grey literature resources can be found in

97

Supporting Information File 1. In addition, we searched the internet using various combinations of

98

relevant search terms in the Google search engine. The searches in PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase

99

employed the use of both subject headings and natural language keywords. These three databases

100

were searched without any restrictions on publication dates. Boolean and proximity operators, as

101

well as filters limiting search results to the English language, were utilized. In addition to SARS-CoV-2,

102

the causal agent of COVID-19, the two other known human coronaviruses with epidemic potential,

103

MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, were included in the search since indicators developed to trace contacts of

104

MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV were considered of potential relevance for SARS-CoV-2. The full search

105

strings used in the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases can be found in Supporting

106

Information File 2. All documents containing at least one indicator related to contact tracing

107

performance were eligible for inclusion. The searches were last updated on 5 December 2020.

108

Citations arising from all of searches were compiled in the citation management software EndNote

109

v.X9 (11), and said software was used for detecting and removing duplicate citations. Results were

110

then transferred into the systematic review management software Covidence v.2491 (12) and

111

screened for eligibility by title and abstract. Full texts of all shortlisted results were assessed. A flow

112

diagram showing the screening, selection, and reasons for exclusions was produced. In addition to

113

the indicators of interest, basic information such as title, authors, year/date of publication,

114

journal/publishing site, the digital object identification number or uniform resource locator,

115

geographical scope, and article/document type were extracted.

116

We developed a conceptual framework to map the extracted contact tracing indicators, with

117

indicators being categorized by indicator type and grouped by thematic area. Indicators were also

118

classified by type of measurement. Exact duplications were removed but otherwise indicators and

119

benchmarks, where proposed, were mapped in the framework as presented in the source

120

documents.

121

Results

122

We screened 1,555 peer-reviewed studies and 894 studies from grey literature sources. After

123

screening and merging of results, we retained 9 peer-reviewed studies and 1 non-peer reviewed

124

study. Additionally, 15 sources were retained from the internet searches (see flow diagram in Figure

125

1 and citation details in Supporting Information File 3).

126

We identified a total of 153 contact tracing indicators from the included sources. Our conceptual

127

framework consisted of five types of indicators (input, process, output, outcome, and impact) with

128

ten thematic areas (human resources, financial resources, case investigation, contact identification,

129

contact testing, contact follow up, case isolation, contact quarantine, transmission chain

130

interruption, incidence reduction). All identified indicators were mapped into this conceptual

131

framework (see Supporting Information File 4 and Table 1): Two-thirds of indicators were classified

132

as process indicators (102; 67%), while 48 (31%) of indicators were classified as output indicators.

133

Only three (2%) indicators were input indicators. The identified indicators covered seven of the ten

134

conceptualized thematic areas, with more than half of the indicators being related either to case

135

investigation (37; 24%) or contact identification (44; 29%). There were no indicators for the input

136

area “financial resources”, the outcome area “transmission chain interruption”, and the impact area

137

“incidence reduction”.

138

The majority of indicators (89, 58%) had a percentage, proportion or ratio (e.g. proportion of

139

identified contacts contacted) as type of measurement. Absolute numbers (e.g. number of contacts

140

tested) and time duration (e.g. time from exposure of a contact with a case to notification) were the

141

type of measurement in 41 (27%) and 35 (23%) indicators, respectively. Thirty-eight (24.8%)

142

indicators included a proposed target benchmark to measure success (e.g. proportion of contacts of

143

COVID-19 positive contacts who become COVID-19 positive: target: <1%).

144

Discussion

145

Indicators are means to measure achievements and can be used to assess and monitor the

146

performance of systems as part of a logical framework (13). In the evaluation of public health

147

systems, indicators are often classified as input, process, output, outcome and impact indicators (14).

148

While input indicators are about what is needed to run a system, and process indicators are about

149

the activities undertaken by the system, output, outcome, and impact indicators are three different

150

ways to measure the external effects of a system ranging from immediate effects (output) to higher-

151

level goals (impact) (15, 16).

152

We systematically collated all indicators that have been proposed in the peer-reviewed, grey and

153

online literature to assess the performance of contact tracing systems, and we developed a

154

conceptual framework to assess the coverage of core thematic areas by the identified indicators. We

155

found the 153 identified indicators to focus heavily on the process performance of case investigation,

156

contact identification, and testing of contacts; and on the output performance of case isolation and

157

contact quarantine. We only identified a very small number of input indicators and no outcome or

158

impact indicators (see Supporting Information File 4 and Table 1).

159

The vast majority of our identified indicators were either process or output indicators. This focus on

160

the mid-level indicator types is not uncommon in health systems assessments (17). For process

161

indicators it is often the availability of data that explains their frequent use, and for output indicators

7

162

this is largely due to the immediacy of the measured effects (16, 18). Outcome and impact indicators,

163

on the other hand, measure more distal long-term effects, and are harder to measure and to

164

attribute to a specific system, hence their absence in our study was hardly surprising given that

165

COVID-19 contact tracing systems were built or adapted under immense time pressure in the midst

166

of a global pandemic.

167

Building on the understanding of COVID-19 contact tracing activities as established by WHO, we

168

conceptualized ten core thematic areas which a comprehensive evaluation approach should cover

169

across the different indicator types (see Supporting Information File 4 and Table 1): human

170

resources, financial resources (input); case investigation; contact identification, contact testing,

171

contact follow up (process); case isolation, contact quarantine (output); transmission chain

172

interruption (outcome); and incidence reduction (impact). All thematic areas of process and output

173

indicators were heavily covered by the identified indicators, but we found important gaps in the

174

input, outcome and impact categories. Showing and validly attributing the interruption of ongoing

175

transmission chains and a subsequent decline in incidence to contact tracing requires properly

176

planned research studies, in particular in high-transmission settings, which might explain the absence

177

of indicators in these thematic areas. Lacking such impact indicators puts contact tracing in a

178

disadvantageous position with regards to the strategic distribution of limited resources compared to

179

other interventions such as vaccination, where impacts appear better documented. However,

180

indicators on human and financial resources were clearly underrepresented, which can hardly be

181

explained by lack of data availability for these indicators. Instead, this gap could indicate that

182

efficiency is not a priority. It is likely that program managers were generally more concerned about

183

the middle and proximal front end of the system, i.e. process and output, instead of the back end

184

(input). This is somewhat expected although counterintuitive given the large amount of resources

185

that contact tracing consumes, especially in community transmission settings. Given that adequate

186

human resources and in particular training has been identified as a main factor of successful contact

187

tracing systems, this area requires better evaluation tools. WHO provides specific guidance for

188

member states to estimate workforce needs depending on the specific transmission scenario (19),

189

which could be used to develop additional indicators to address these gaps.

190

Overall, we noticed substantial duplications and strong similarities between indicators, in particular

191

in the thematic areas that were the most heavily covered (see Supporting Information File 4), which

192

can be explained in large parts by a lack of standardized terminology and use of epidemiological

193

concepts in the non-scientific literature. Most of the identified sources did not provide clear

194

definitions of the terms used. There is a need to harmonize the understanding and use of

195

terminology and concepts related to contact tracing. Also, the benchmarks that were proposed for

196

about a quarter of the identified indicators were often not contextualized, which made it difficult to

197

establish whether these were considered minimum standards or indicators of success, and to

198

determine the rationale behind the choice of certain thresholds. Furthermore, indicators using

199

measures of centrality were based either on averages (means) or medians, but none of the identified

200

indicators aimed to measure the dispersion of transmission risks between cases and contacts, which

201

is increasingly recognized as an important factor in the control of COVID-19 (20).

202

Our study was subject to several limitations. First, our search was restricted to English, thus

203

documents in any other language would have been missed. Second, we restricted our search to the

204

three known human coronaviruses with epidemic potential due to their similar epidemiological

205

profiles. Contact tracing indicators for other epidemic-prone infectious diseases were thus missed.

206

Third, we did not assess system-wide indicators, e.g. those relating to coordination across units

207

and/or levels, or governance. Fourth, we were not able to record the total number of websites

208

searched during our internet search, and could therefore only report the number of websites from

209

which indicators were included for this study (see Figure 1). Fifth, it is possible that there is

210

publication bias across indicator categories, with input indicators being underrepresented in

211

published or online documents compared to process and output indicators due to perceived lower

212

operational relevance by public health officials in charge of contact tracing systems. This might be

213

particularly the case for indicators that are more relevant at peripheral levels of health systems

214

compared to priorities at central levels. Sixth, though we applied a very systematic search strategy

215

for the peer-reviewed and grey literature, this was not a full systematic review and therefore did not

216

include or adhere to all items recommended for full systematic reviews (21). We did, however, follow

217

existing guidance for the rapid conduct of scoping reviews (9, 10) and report on all items of the

218

PRISMA-ScR Checklist (see Supporting Information File 5).

219

We provide the first comprehensive mapping of published indicators to assess the performance of

220

contact tracing systems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings can assist countries to develop

221

new indicators for their own contact tracing systems or to complement existing lists of indicators.

222

Despite the recent development of several effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, contact tracing will

223

remain a cornerstone in the public health response worldwide until the very end of the pandemic (3).

224

The importance yet absence of comprehensive guidance on how to assess performance of contact

225

tracing systems across countries has been recognized (2, 5). The centerpiece of such global guidance

226

should be a set of core indicators that are widely accepted, operationally relevant, and easy to report

227

across contact tracing systems. This core set might even be useful in future epidemics with similar

228

epidemiological characteristics as SARS-CoV-2. The development of such a core set of indicators will

229

require a coordinated, methodologically robust ranking and consensus seeking undertaking, and our

230

study provides important insights to inform such initiatives.

231

Conclusions

232

Almost all identified indicators were either process or output indicators with a strong focus on case

233

investigation, contact identification, case isolation or contact quarantine. Important gaps in process,

234

outcome and impact indicators exist. Duplications, inconsistent use of terminology and unclear

235

choice for benchmarks were common. A universally agreed set of indicators is needed to allow for

236

comprehensive cross-system evaluations in order to improve the performance of COVID-19 contact

237

tracing systems.
