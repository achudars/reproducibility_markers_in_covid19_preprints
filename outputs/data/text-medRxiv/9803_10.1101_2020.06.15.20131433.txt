Abstract

1

Accurate prediction of COVID-19 related indicators such as confirmed cases, deaths and

2

recoveries play an important in understanding the spread and impact of the virus, as

3

well as resource planning and allocation. In this study, we approach the prediction

4

problem from a statistical perspective and predict confirmed cases and deaths on a

5

provincial level. We propose the compound Dirichlet Multinomial distribution to

6

estimate the proportion parameter of each province as mutually exclusive outcomes.

7

Furthermore, we make an assumption of exponential growth of the total cummulative

8

counts in order to predict future total counts. The outcomes of this approach is not

9

only prediction. The variation of the proportion parameter is characterised by the

10

Dirichlet distribution, which provides insight in the movement of the pandemic across

11

provinces over time.

Introduction

The global COVID-19 (C19) pandemic has urged governments globally to rapidly

implement measures to reduce the number of infected cases and reduce pressure on the

health care system. Strategic decisions on measures such as quarantine, economic

16

lockdown and social distancing depend on projections of number of infections, people

17

requiring urgent medical attention and mortality. Already early on in the pandemic, it

18

became clear that data on confirmed cases are plagued with uncertainty, because of the

19

high number of asymptomatic cases, varying test protocols per country [1], as well as

20

different symptoms in different regions [2]. For example, one mathematical approach to

21

understanding the spread of infections is compartmental models such as Susceptible

22

Exposed Infectious Recovered (SEIR) and Susceptible Infectious Recovered (SIR)

23

models [3–5].

24

The approach of this paper is to predict the cummulative count of C19 confirmed
cases and deaths across provinces in South Africa. We provide the following arguments

26

for this approach:

27

• The spread of the pandemic in a country is not uniform, but characterized by
regional hotspots such as Northern Italy [6] in Italy and New York in the USA.
• Although the test protocols and definition of infection may vary across

28

29

30

countries [1], it is more likely to be consistent for multiple regions within a single

31

country. Therefore, it makes sense to model the dependencies between provinces.

32

• For the purpose of resource planning and mitigation strategies, it is important to

33

understand how the pandemic spreads and moves across provincial or district

34

borders and how the infection proportions change over time. Our modelling

35

approach shows the change in counts as proportions across provinces.

36

A simple approach to such a model would be the Multinomial distribution, a

June 15, 2020

25

37

multivariate discrete distribution which models multiple mutually exclusive outcomes.

38

The simplest application of the Multinomial distribution is determing whether a

39

six-sided die is biased. This is determined by calculating the probability of throwing

40

each one of the numbers from 1–6 by throwing the die multiple times. Uneven

41

probabilities for one of the numbers might indicate an unfair die. There is, however,

42

uncertainty associated with these calculated probabilities, which can be accounted for

43

by following a Bayesian approach to the problem and fitting a prior to the Multinomial

44

probability parameter. The conjugate prior for the Multinomial distribution is the

Dirichlet distribution which allows us to calculate a posterior distribution over the

46

Multinomial proportions. This approach forms the basis of our methodology which we

47

describe in more detail in the next section. The methodology is followed by a

48

description of the South African data and then the application. We conclude the paper

49

with a discussion of the results and future work.

50

Methodology

51

The structure of the methodology section is as follows: We first describe the nature of

52

categorical count data before introducing the compound Dirichlet Multinomial

53

distribution and describing the methodology in detail according to these steps:

54

1. Update Dirichlet parameter.

55

2. Estimate categorical counts.

56

3. Validate the estimations with Q-Q plots.

57

4. Predict future total counts.

58

5. Validate predictions.

59

6. Predict future categorical counts

60

Categorical data

61

Consider a sequence of N observations x1 , ..., xN where each observation xi is a vector

62

of length K, the number of categories, denoting numbers from 1, ..., M such that
PK
k=1 xik = M .

63

64

Illustration 1: Let’s say K = 4 and M = 123. Then xi = [13, 12, 42, 56] can be an
observation. This is an outcome of the Multinomial distribution with parameters M

66

and Y . N such outcomes are observed and denoted by the matrix X with N rows and

67

K columns. The objective is to estimate a future outcome xN +1 given M . The
PK
unknown parameter Y = y1 , ..., yK (where k=1 yk = 1), however, varies all the time
and this variability is characterized by the Dirichlet distribution [7].

77

Illustration 1 with K = 4 and M = 264, let N = 17 and suppose N is the number of

days in the recorded dataset used to get to nk . The variable of interest is the number of

79

C19 deaths per day. After 17 days of daily observations of the number of C19 deaths,

80

suppose the totals for 4 categories (provinces) are n1 = 34, n2 = 27, n3 = 56, n4 = 153

81

with a total of M = 270 deaths. Daily observations are not important, only the totals

82

after the N = 17 days. This is due to the fact that the likelihood function (discussed

83

next) in the predictive distribution only depends on the numbers nk from the last

observation. In the next section we introduce the compound Dirichlet Multinomial

distribution.

The conditions

88

In a Bayesian framework, the predictive density function of a future X, say Z [10]
where Z|M ∼ MN(M, Y ) and Y |α1 , .., αK ∼ Dirichlet(α1 , .., αK ) is similar to the CDM

90

density function: Given xi with values n(1) , ..., n(N ) of observed x values, the predictive

91

distribution of Z|n(1) , ..., n(N ) ∼ CDM (M, (α1 + n(1) , .., αK + n(K) ). The density

92

function is given by:

Taking the mean E(zk ) =

(3)

k=1

as prediction of zk , we can predict the number of

outcomes for the k th category. We’ve reached our goal of predicting xN +1 using:

M (nk + αk )

Illustration 3: Following up on Illustration 2, assume it is known that the Dirichlet

96

parameters are α1 = 33, α2 = 26, α3 = 55, α4 = 149 with α0 = 263, the prediction of the

18th observations X18 , is pred(X18 ) = [35, 28, 59, 160] and a total of M = 286. For the

purpose of this illustration, the value of M is known.

other [11]. In our case, it is the empirical distribution (observations) against the CDM

109

estimations. A straight line is an indication of a good fit. Figure 1 illustrates the Q-Q

Predict ahead

112

Another application of the CDM model is to predict a number of observations ahead.

113

This is done by estimating the total number of counts (say number of deaths) - y - at

114

day x using an exponential fit y = exp(a + bx), or a straight line log(y) = a + bx. Let

115

x0 be the future day for which a prediction is to be made. The fitted line must thus be

116

extended to x = x0 . The prediction pred(x0 ) can be made from the CDM model under

117

parameters M and αk as defined above.

118

Validate predictions

119

We calculate the variation around the prediction by estimating the distances d of the
points (x0 , log(y0 )) to the line A log(y) + Bx + C = 0. Then

calculate the distances d of the points to the line A log(y) + Bx + C = 0 where

South Africa reported its first confirmed case of C19 on 5 March 2020 and first

June 15, 2020

137

mortality on 27 March 2020. Since then, the number of confirmed cases have grown to

138

34,357 confirmed cases and 705 mortalities by 1 June, 2020. Official numbers of C19

139

confirmed cases, mortalities and recoviers in South Africa are shared by the National

140

Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD). This information is communicated to the

141

public as infographics and during press releases by the Department of Health (DoH).

142

The Data Science for Social Impact (DSFSI) research group at the University of

143

Pretoria, South Africa has developed an open repository for South African C19 related

144

data: https://github.com/dsfsi/covid19za [13]. The data is consolodated and

145

disseminated on a provincial level and linked to a dashboard for visualisation

146

purposes [14]. For the purpose of this study, C19 deaths are summed for these smaller

147

provinces: Limpopo, Mpumalanga, North West and Northern Cape because the numbers

148

are still very low. Although Free State has the second smallest population, the province

149

experienced an early outbreak in March 2020 of the disease. For this reason, Free State

150

is considered individually, and not part of the grouped smaller provinces. The datasets

are visualised in Figures 3 and 4. The counts are also indicated in text boxes at the last

Application

155

We apply the steps as outlined in the methodology section on the two South African

156

C19 datasets, namely cummulative confirmed cases and cummulative confirmed

157

mortalities. In both cases, we use the daily counts for the month of May 2020 to

158

calculate the parameter estimations. We use the available data for the month of June

159

2020 for predictions.

160

C19 confirmed cases

161

The first step in the process is to update the Dirichlet parameter αk for each province k.

162

We use the 31 total counts of confirmed cases in May for M in Equation 4 and update

163

αk at each day. Since the first confirmed case was recorded on 5 March, the 31

164

observations in our training set are day 55 - day 85. The change in proportions over

165

time is illustrated in Figure 5. Western Cape (WC), for example changed from having

166

42% of South Africa’s C19 confirmed cases on day 55 (1 May 2020) to 60% on day 85

167

(end of May).

168

Fig 5. C19 confirmed cases Dirichlet parameter αk for each province.
In order to validate the estimations x55 − x85 , we draw Q-Q plots for each province
which are shown in Figure 6. The Q-Q plots of the larger provinces (EC, GP, WC)

170

confirms a good fit.

171

The next step is to predict new confirmed cases. First, we fit a straight line to the

June 15, 2020

169

172

log transformation of the daily counts. Figure 7 shows the fit of the straight line

173

log(y) = 5.578 + 0.0569x with the upper and lower bounds according to the standard

174

deviation of the distances d between the observed y and the line as described in the

175

methodology section. The std(d) is s = 0.01. Extending x provides us with an

176

estimation of M for future counts. Figure 8 shows this extension (transformed back to

C19 related mortalities

183

As with confirmed cases, we use the month of May as training data for C19 related

184

mortalities. The first death was recorded on 27 March 2020 and the 31 observations in

185

our training set are day 31 - day 61. We apply the same methodology than with the

186

confirmed cases dataset. Figure 10 shows the proportion movement over time. This

proportion deaths than confirmed cases.

From this graph it can be seen that Eastern Cape (EC) and Western Cape (WC) follow

Fig 14. C19 related mortality predictions per province

Conclusion

200

In this paper we present the compound Dirichlet Multinomial distribution to model

201

COVID-19 related count data per province as mutually exclusive categories. Taking into

202

account that test protocols and positive case definitions are more likely to be consistent

203

within a country than across legislative borders, we can assume dependencies of the

204

pandemic’s key indicators across provincial borders. The benefit of this assumption is

205

that we can track the change in Multinomial probabilities over time. This is done by

206

placing a Dirichlet prior over the Multinomial probability parameter. A practical

207

illustration of this in the paper is the change in Western Cape’s C19 confirmed cases

208

over time as a proportion of the total cases in South Africa. The benefit of the Bayesian

209

approach in this case, is that we can express the uncertainty associated with the

210

provincial-level probabilities.

211

We apply this model to the prediction of future cases by assuming that the log
transformation of the total counts follows a straight line. In the application section we

show the prediction results. The total confirmed cases (Figure 8) and dominant

214

provinces (EC, GP and WC in Figure 9) show satisfactory predictions of unseen data.

215

The C19 related mortality predictions follow an exponential pattern for these same

216

provinces (Figure 14)

217

At the core of making future predictions is the assumption that the pandemic follows

218

an exponential growth. As the pandemic progresses, the slope changes and the training

219

data range must be restricted to only include a consistent slope. The implication of this

220

that the predictions are limited to short and medium term. Future work includes using

221

change point detections [3] to determine the training data range. Alternatively, dates of

222

lockdown level changes (with a lag) can be considered in selecting the training data

223

range. Finally, the model can be applied on a district level, such as districts within

224

Western Cape. Such data is available for most provinces on
