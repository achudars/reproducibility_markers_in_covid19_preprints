Summary
Recent studies have provided insights into innate and adaptive immune dynamics in
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Yet, the exact feature of antibody responses that
governs COVID-19 disease outcomes remain unclear. Here, we analysed humoral immune
responses in 209 asymptomatic, mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 patients over time
to probe the nature of antibody responses in disease severity and mortality. We observed
a correlation between anti-Spike (S) IgG levels, length of hospitalization and clinical
parameters associated with worse clinical progression. While high anti-S IgG levels
correlated with worse disease severity, such correlation was time-dependent. Deceased
patients did not have higher overall humoral response than live discharged patients.
However, they mounted a robust, yet delayed response, measured by anti-S, anti-RBD IgG,
and neutralizing antibody (NAb) levels, compared to survivors. Delayed seroconversion
kinetics correlated with impaired viral control in deceased patients. Finally, while sera from
89% of patients displayed some neutralization capacity during their disease course, NAb
generation prior to 14 days of disease onset emerged as a key factor for recovery. These
data indicate that COVID-19 mortality does not correlate with the cross-sectional antiviral
antibody levels per se, but rather with the delayed kinetics of NAb production.

Main
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2, which infects host cells via
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020). While 80% of
infections are mild or asymptomatic (WHO; who.int), moderate and severe COVID-19 patients
develop a wide range of symptoms, including respiratory, vascular and neurological complications
(Chen et al., 2020a; Huang et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020). Several studies have linked cellular and
humoral immune responses to viral clearance and distinct disease trajectories (GiamarellosBourboulis et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Lucas et al., 2020; Rodriguez et al., 2020; Zhou et al.,
2020a). For instance, inflammatory cytokines including IFNs, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-18, are
associated with worse COVID-19 outcome (Del Valle et al., 2020; Lucas et al., 2020). Importantly,
in contrast to the marked decreases in circulating T cells observed in COVID-19 patients
(Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Mathew et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020a),
circulating B cell do not seem to decrease (Chen et al., 2020a; Lucas et al., 2020). Additionally,
several studies reported an overall increase in both IgM and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (anti-S
IgG), as well as with the presence of neutralizing IgG and IgA antibodies in COVID-19 patients
(Barnes et al., 2020; Robbiani et al., 2020; Schmidt et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). However,
information about how antibody responses affect the course of COVID-19 trajectory, and how
they correlate with additional host factors, viral titers and with clinical outcome, is still missing.

Anti-S and anti-RBD antibodies correlate with distinct COVID-19 outcomes
To profile the SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immune response, one hundred and seventy-nine
hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with a total of 280 samples, were enrolled in this study after
admission to Yale-New Haven Hospital (YNHH) between 18 March 2020 and 27 May 2020. In
parallel, we enrolled 41 non-hospitalized participants including asymptomatic and mild
participants. Additionally, 108 healthcare workers (HCWs) samples served as uninfected healthy
controls (SARS-CoV-2-negative by RT–qPCR and serology). Basic demographics and clinical

characteristics for each cohort are summarized in Extended Data Table 1. For our initial analysis,
hospitalized patients were first stratified based on disease severity into moderate and severe
disease groups by supplemental oxygen levels requirements and admission to the intensive care
unit (ICU). Further investigations divided COVID-19 patients according to clinical outcomes,
stratifying patients that ultimately recovered or die from infection, as previously described (Lucas
et al., 2020). The total of 322 samples, collected at hospital admission, include sequential followup measurements with a range of one to seven longitudinal time-points per patient that occurred
3–60 days after the onset of symptoms. We assessed viral RNA load, measured by quantitative
PCR with reverse transcription (RT–qPCR) using nasopharyngeal swabs; levels of plasma
cytokines and chemokines, measured using a Human Cytokine /Chemokine Array 71-403 Plex
Panel; leukocyte populations, profiled by flow cytometry using freshly isolated peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs); and antibodies profile, using both ELISA and neutralizations assays.

Plasma sample analysis showed that 95.1% and 97% of total COVID-19 hospitalized patients had
virus-specific IgG against spike (S1) or RBD region of the proteins, respectively, reaching the
peak of IgG production around day 15 after symptom onset (Extended Data Fig. 1a-b). The
average of anti-S or anti-RBD IgG levels from uninfected control donors, HCW, were used to
determine the limit threshold. There were no differences in antibody levels between hospitalized
patients of different age, sex or BMI (body mass index) in our cohort (Extended Data Fig. 1c-f).
Maximum viral titers from nasopharyngeal swabs were reached approximately 11–13 days after
symptom onset. Overall, maximum nasal viral RNA load did not correlate with disease severity;
no differences were observed between the non-hospitalized group or moderate and severe
patients (Extended Data Fig. 2a). In contrast, hospitalized patients showed a significant increase
in maximum anti-S and anti-RBD IgM and IgG levels when compared to non-hospitalized
individuals (Figure 1a, b). Additionally, anti-S IgG levels correlated with length of hospitalization
among severe, but not moderate patients (Figure 1c). Consistent with this observation, clinical

parameters associated with worsened clinical progression, such as intubation, ferritin and D-dimer
levels were positively correlated with anti-S IgG levels (Figure 1d, e). In contrast, anti-RBD IgG
levels were not correlated with length of hospitalization (Figure 1b-e). Thus, these data indicate
that elevated anti-S IgG levels are associated with worse disease outcome in severe COVID-19
patients, confirming previous observations that antibody responses were consistently higher
among hospitalized subjects (Chen et al., 2020c; Chen et al., 2020d; Hu et al., 2020; Yu et al.,
2020b). Notably, deceased patients did not have higher levels of virus-specific IgG or IgM than
the live discharged patients (Fig. 1a). These results indicated a fundamentally different feature of
their antibody responses compared to severe disease patients who survived the infection.

Due to the correlation observed between anti-S IgG levels and disease severity, as well as
previous reports describing changes in leukocyte populations in severe COVID-19, including
lymphopenia and increased monocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils numbers (GiamarellosBourboulis et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Lucas et al., 2020; Mathew et al., 2020; Zhou et al.,
2020a) we next assessed whether changes in virus-specific antibodies were linked to alterations
in innate and adaptive circulating immune cell types. Anti-S and anti-RBD IgG levels negatively
correlated with T cells and positively with monocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils numbers, but
no correlation was found with circulating NK or B cells (Figure 1f). Furthermore, we observed a
positive correlation between anti-RBD, but not anti-S, IgG levels and circulating T follicular helper
CD4+ T cells (Tfh) as well as CD38+HLA-DR+ TCR-activated CD4 T cells (CD4act) (Figure 1f).
Further stratification of hospitalized patients at their initial collection time point into acute, subacute and convalescent phases of COVID-19, indicated a correlation between anti-S IgG and
clinical disease severity, even among patients with equivalent viral loads in the same phase of
disease onset (Figure 1g). Specifically, between clusters matched for equivalent viral loads and
similar days from symptom onset, we noted an increase in the mean clinical score of the high S
IgG group relative to the low S IgG group, although this was not statistically significant.

Importantly, it was clear that the development of anti-S IgG responses did not correlate with
general improvements in patients clinical scores. Given these results, we conclude that anti-S IgG
antibodies positively correlate with COVID-19 severity and appear to offer a limited ability to
modify disease trajectory once developed during natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. We conclude
that anti-S IgG antibodies positively correlate with COVID-19 severity, along with the circulating
levels of monocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils, but independent of circulating T cells, Tfh or
viral load.

Delayed antibody production in lethal COVID-19
Given the lower levels of antiviral antibodies found in deceased patients, we next addressed
whether the timing of antibody responses differ between severe vs. lethal disease. Longitudinal
analysis revealed distinct kinetics: discharged patients reached an early peak of anti-S and antiRBD IgG levels faster than deceased patients (Figure 2a). In contrast, deceased patients reached
higher maximum levels of anti-S IgM and IgG than discharged in later stages of disease (Figure
2a). Longitudinal antibody trajectories between discharged and deceased groups were consistent
with their distinct capacity to clear the virus; i.e. discharged patients were more efficient in viral
clearance when compared side-by-side with deceased patients (Figure 2b). Additionally, lower
levels of nasal viral RNA load measured at the time of maximum antibody levels were observed
in discharged patients (Figure 2c). We did not observe differences in B cell dynamics in patients
with distinct clinical outcomes (Extended Data Fig. 3a, b). Despite no differences between
discharged and deceased groups at aggregate levels, longitudinal analysis indicated a higher
frequency of Tfh at DfSO 10-15 in discharged than in deceased COVID-19. Thus, death from
COVID-19 correlated with a delay in the development of virus-specific IgG and virus clearance.

We next assessed a possible correlation between cytokines and chemokines levels and virusspecific antibody production. Discharged patients showed a positive correlations between anti-S

IgG and several chemokines, growth factors and tissue repair mediators, including sCD40L,
CXCL5, IL-8, VEGFA, CCL4, CCL17, Eotaxin2 (Figure 2d); consistent with a “protective
signature” we recently observed in these patients, who recover from COVID-19 (Lucas et al.,
2020). Additionally, discharged patients showed a negative correlation between anti-S IgG and
plasma inflammatory markers previously associated with poor disease outcomes and death, such
as IFN-I, II and III, IL-1, IL-6, IL-17 and IL-10 (Figure 2d). Deceased patients in contrast showed
fewer correlations with anti-S IgG levels and overall heightened levels of plasma cytokines and
chemokines (Figure 2d).

Early production of neutralizing antibodies correlates with COVID-19 recovery
Production of anti-S/RBD IgG antibodies is generally associated with virus neutralization
(Robbiani et al., 2020), and have been linked with protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection after
vaccination in animal models (Folegatti et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020a). We next assessed the
kinetics of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) produced against SARS-CoV-2 by performing a
neutralization assay using wild-type SARS-CoV-2 in patients that reached high levels of anti-S
IgG (O.D.>1.2) at any point during their disease course. In addition, all deceased patients were
included in the analysis regardless of whether they reached the limit cutoff point; samples from
health care workers negative for SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR were used as controls samples and
were below the threshold for anti-S/RBD ELISA. Previous studies have reported a low frequency
of convalescent COVID-19 patients showing potent neutralization capacity of over 1:1000 titers
(Robbiani et al., 2020). Indeed, while 89% of patients in our cohort showed some neutralization
capacity during their disease course, 80-86% of hospitalized patients exhibited neutralizing
activity only at lower dilutions (1:10-1:90 titers), and only 7-27% of patients showed neutralizing
activity at higher dilutions (1:810-1:2430 titers) (Figure 3a, b and Extended Data Fig. 4a, b). The
neutralization levels were lower among non-hospitalized participants with mild disease, even at
lower dilutions of 1:90 (31%) and 1:270 (4%) titers (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Based on this

stratification, we designated patients with >1:810 neutralizing titer as high neutralizers (HN). The
half-maximal neutralizing titer (PRNT50) was undetectable for 15.6% of patients, while 25.9% of
patients had PRNT50 at 1:270 and only 1.3% of patient at 1:810. Of note, the levels of PRNT50
were not significantly different between hospitalized patients stratified by disease severity and
outcome (Figure 3c, d). These PRNT50 patterns among hospitalized patients are consistent with
a recent pre-print (Garcia-Beltran et al., 2020).

Importantly, our longitudinal analysis also revealed faster NAb kinetics, as well as higher peak, in
discharged than decease patients. Discharged patients reached 50% of neutralization at 1:90 titer
around day 9 post symptoms onset, while deceased patients peaked 1 and 2 weeks later in 1:30
and 1:90 titers, respectively (Figure 3e, f). We then compared maximum anti-S, anti-RBD IgG
titers and viral load between high neutralizers, discharged and deceased patients, when each
group reached 50% of neutralization. As expected, the levels of anti-S/RBD IgG antibodies
strongly correlated with PRNT50, and no significant differences were observed between
discharged and deceased groups (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Despite equivalent maximum or
PRNT50 NAb titers, distinct temporal antibody dynamics was strongly linked with clinical disease
outcome. Remarkably, the high neutralizers had maximum levels of anti-RBD IgG and NAb from
the very first sampling (5 days post disease onset), and maintained high levels throughout the
hospital stay (Figure 2b). High neutralizers presented lower levels of nasal viral RNA load
measured at the time of maximum antibody level in comparison to deceased or discharged
patients (Figure 2c).

Finally, we asked whether the timing of NAb production dictates disease trajectory. Patients were
grouped into those who developed >50% neutralization activity at 1:90 titer NAb levels before 14
days of symptoms onset (early), and those who did not (late) (Figure 4a). Among patients with
high levels of Anti-S IgG (OD>1.2), 48.2% had >50% of neutralization activity at 1:90 titer, but

only 17.8% at 1:270 (Figure 4b). Early neutralization activity did not correlate with age or BMI and
the frequency of males and females were not significantly different between early or late
neutralizers (Figure 4c). Nevertheless, early NAb production correlated with improving clinical
signs and lower mortality than late neutralizers, which overall showed worst disease progression
and higher mortality (Figure 4d, e). Moreover, the maximum viral loads reached over the disease
course were lower in early neutralizers (Figure 4f). Together, these data indicate that clinical
trajectories and outcomes do not correlate with cross-sectional levels of NAb production per se,
but rather with the timing and kinetics of NAb production.

Discussion
The nature of virus-specific serum antibodies evolves rapidly following infection and has been
previously correlated with disease severity in patients infected with different coronaviruses,
including MERS, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 (Chen et al., 2020c; Chen et al., 2020d; Hu et
al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020b). Our analyses not only confirm a link between SARS-CoV-2-specific
antibody responses and COVID-19 severity, but also suggest a specific time-window in which
neutralizing antibodies must develop in order to improve viral control and diseases outcomes.
Our temporal analyses revealed a distinct antibody kinetics between discharged and deceased
patients. Deceased patients showed slower antibody dynamics even though they reached higher
levels later in the disease trajectory. A recent study performing longitudinal analysis also reported
a delayed and incomplete humoral immune response in COVID-19 deceased patients (Zohar et
al., 2020). Our study confirms and extends these observations by demonstrating that
seroconversion kinetics between discharged and deceased patients can directly impact viral
clearance, with faster viral control or prolonged viral shedding, respectively. Additionally, our
observations that discharged patients show a negative correlation between anti-S IgG and plasma
inflammatory markers uncovers a potential role of antibodies in protecting these patients from

immunopathology, especially in light of our early study describing a severe inflammatory signature
in COVID-19 patients (Lucas et al., 2020). Somehow, this protective role of antiviral antibodies
fail to operate in deceased patients, as we saw loss of correlation between anti-S IgG and
protective tissue repair growth factors. Our data suggest that the loss of protective role of
antibodies in lethal disease is due to their late onset.
Our study demonstrated that neutralizing antibody responses developed within 14 days of
symptom onset correlated with recovery, while those induced at later timepoints appear to lose
this protective effect. It is unclear why antibodies generated after this time point are unable to
promote viral clearance and recovery in COVID-19 patients. We speculate that the virus might
become inaccessible to the antibodies after a certain time point, by establishing infection within
immune privileged tissues. Alternatively, disease may be driven by late-onset antibody-mediated
immunopathology. For instance, antibodies from severe COVID-19 patients show proinflammatory Fc modifications signature, including high levels of afucosylated IgG1 (Abry et al.,
2020), which could potentially drive pathologic responses. Consistent with this notion is our finding
that anti-S but not anti-RBD antibody levels in COVID-19 patients correlate with disease severity,
length of hospital stay, length of intubation and various clinical parameters of disease. In addition,
the levels of anti-S IgG, when matched for similar viral load and days from symptom onset,
correlated with COVID-19 severity. Future studies are needed to address the precise mechanism
of the failure of late antibody responses, and the potential immunopathological roles of anti-S IgG.

Recent post mortem tissue analysis from patients with lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection suggested a
defective induction of germinal centers, including inefficient generation of Tfh cells (Kaneko et al.,
2020); data consistent with our observations. Nevertheless, because our analysis did not include
isolation of secondary lymphoid tissues, we were unable to assess the dynamics of B cell
populations in lymph nodes and may explain why we failed to observe differences in B cell

dynamics despite our observations of general differences in the kinetics of humoral responses
across patient cohorts. We observed a positive correlation between anti-S IgG and Tfh in
discharged but not deceased patients.

The use of convalescent plasma has been proposed as an urgent therapeutic modality for COVID19 patients. However, large clinical trials conducted to evaluate the efficacy of plasma therapy
failed to observe clear benefits (Agarwal et al., 2020; Holliman et al., 1987; Pathak, 2020; Valk et
al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020b), perhaps due to variable amount of neutralizing capacity in the donor
pool. Potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies cloned from B cells isolated from convalescent
individuals were proposed to address this issue in COVID-19 therapeutics. However, a recent
large trial of monoclonal antibodies also failed to observe improvements when administered to
late stage severe or hospitalized patients (Eli Lily); similar observations were made with trials by
Regeneron (Lilly statement; Regeneron statement; FDA; fda.gov). Recently, additional early trials
have shown promising results in people who were newly infected with the virus (Chen et al.,
2020b). Our results demonstrated that anti-S or neutralizing antibodies observed within the 14
days of symptom onset correlated with improved disease trajectory. These data suggest that
antibody-based therapies may benefit patients most when given within this two-week time
window.

METHODS
Ethics statement
This study was approved by Yale Human Research Protection Program Institutional Review
Boards (FWA00002571, protocol ID 2000027690). Informed consent was obtained from all
enrolled patients and healthcare workers.
Patients
One hundred and seventy-nine patients admitted to YNHH with COVID-19 between 18 March
2020 and 27 May 2020 were included in this study. Additionally, forty-one non hospitalized
participants were enrolled in this study, including asymptomatic and mild individuals. This
participants were enrolled by the IMPACT group (25) and an additional 16 serum samples from
mild COVID-19 cases from the Connecticut National Guard. HCW participants, screened serially
(every two weeks) served as uninfected healthy controls (SARS-CoV-2-negative by RT–qPCR
and serology). No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. Patients were
scored for COVID-19 disease severity through review of the electronic health records (EMR) at
each longitudinal time point. Scores were assigned by a clinical infectious disease physician
according to a custom-developed disease severity scale. Moderate disease status (clinical score
1–3) was defined as: SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring hospitalization without supplementary
oxygen (1); infection requiring non-invasive supplementary oxygen (<3 l/min to maintain SpO2
>92%) (2); and infection requiring non-invasive supplementary oxygen (>3 l/min to maintain
SpO2 >92%, or >2 l/min to maintain SpO2 >92% and had a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
(CRP) >70) and received tocilizumab). Severe disease status (clinical score 4 or 5) was defined
as infection meeting all criteria for clinical score 3 and also requiring admission to the ICU and >6
l/min supplementary oxygen to maintain SpO2 >92% (4); or infection requiring invasive
mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in addition to
glucocorticoid or vasopressor administration (5). Clinical score 6 was assigned for deceased
patients. For all patients, days from symptom onset were estimated as follows: (1) highest priority
was given to explicit onset dates provided by patients; (2) next highest priority was given to the
earliest reported symptom by a patient; and (3) in the absence of direct information regarding
symptom onset, we estimated a date through manual assessment of the EHR by an independent
clinician. Demographic information was aggregated through a systematic and retrospective
review of the EHR and was used to construct Extended Data Table 1. Symptom onset and
aetiology were recorded through standardized interviews with patients or patient surrogates upon
enrolment in our study, or alternatively through manual EHR review if no interview was possible

owing to clinical status. The clinical data were collected using EPIC EHR and REDCap 9.3.6
software. At the time of sample acquisition and processing, investigators were completely
unaware of the patients’ conditions. Blood acquisition was performed and recorded by a separate
team. Information of patients’ conditions was not available until after processing and analysing
raw data by flow cytometry and ELISA. A clinical team, separate from the experimental team,
performed chart reviews to determine patients’ relevant statistics. Cytokines and flow cytometry
analyses were blinded. Patients clinical information and clinical scores coding were only revealed
after data collection.
Isolation of patient plasma and PBMCs
Whole blood was collected in sodium heparin-coated vacutainers and kept on gentle agitation
until processing. All blood was processed on the day of collection. Plasma samples were collected
after centrifugation of whole blood at 400g for 10 min at room temperature (RT) without brake.
The undiluted serum was then transferred to 15-ml polypropylene conical tubes, and aliquoted
and stored at −80 °C for subsequent analysis. PBMCs were isolated using Histopaque (SigmaAldrich, #10771-500ML) density gradient centrifugation in a biosafety level 2+ facility. After
isolation of undiluted serum, blood was diluted 1:1 in room temperature PBS, layered over
Histopaque in a SepMate tube (StemCell Technologies; #85460) and centrifuged for 10 min at
1,200g. The PBMC layer was isolated according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were
washed twice with PBS before counting. Pelleted cells were briefly treated with ACK lysis buffer
for 2 min and then counted. Percentage viability was estimated using standard Trypan blue
staining and an automated cell counter (Thermo-Fisher, #AMQAX1000).
SARS-CoV-2 specific-antibody measurements
ELISAs were performed as previously described (Amanat et al., 2020). In short, Triton X-100 and
RNase A were added to serum samples at final concentrations of 0.5% and 0.5mg/ml respectively
and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 30 minutes before use to reduce risk from any
potential virus in serum. 96-well MaxiSorp plates (Thermo Scientific #442404) were coated with
50 μl/well of recombinant SARS Cov-2 S1 protein (ACROBiosystems #S1N-C52H3-100ug) at a
concentration of 2 μg/ml in PBS and were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The coating buffer was
removed, and plates were incubated for 1h at RT with 200 μl of blocking solution (PBS with 0.1%
Tween-20, 3% milk powder). Serum was diluted 1:50 in dilution solution (PBS with 0.1% Tween20, 1% milk powder) and 100 μl of diluted serum was added for two hours at RT. Plates were
washed three times with PBS-T (PBS with 0.1% Tween-20) and 50 μl of HRP anti-Human IgG
Antibody (GenScript #A00166, 1:5,000) or anti-Human IgM-Peroxidase Antibody (Sigma-Aldrich

#A6907, 1:5,000) diluted in dilution solution added to each well. After 1 h of incubation at RT,
plates were washed three times with PBS-T. Plates were developed with 100 μl of TMB Substrate
Reagent Set (BD Biosciences #555214) and the reaction was stopped after 15 min by the addition
of 2 N sulfuric acid. Plates were then read at a wavelength of 450 nm and 570nm.
Cytokine and chemokine measurements
Patient serum was isolated as before and aliquots were stored at −80 °C. Sera were shipped to
Eve Technologies (Calgary, Alberta, Canada) on dry ice, and levels of cytokines and chemokines
were measured using the Human Cytokine Array/Chemokine Array 71-403 Plex Panel (HD71).
All samples were measured upon the first thaw.
Viral RNA measurements
Nasopharyngeal swabs samples were collected approximately every four days, for SARS-CoV-2
RT–qPCR analysis where clinically feasible. RNA concentrations were measured as previously
described (Wyllie et al., 2020). In brief, total nucleic acid was extracted from 300 μl of viral
transport medium (nasopharyngeal swab) using the MagMAX Viral/Pathogen Nucleic Acid
Isolation kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) with a modified protocol and eluted into 75 μl elution buffer.
We used 5 μl of extracted nucleic acid as template in a RT-qPCR assay to detect SARS-CoV-2
RNA (Vogels et al., 2020), using the US CDC real-time RT–qPCR primer/probe sets for 2019nCoV_N1, 2019-nCoV_N2, and the human RNase P (RP) as an extraction control. Virus RNA
copies were quantified using a tenfold dilution standard curve of RNA transcripts that we
previously generated (Vogels et al., 2020). The lower limit of detection for SARS-CoV-2 genomes
assayed by qPCR in nasopharyngeal specimens was established as described (Vogels et al.,
2020). In addition to a technical detection threshold, we also used a clinical referral threshold
(detection limit) to either: (1) refer asymptomatic HCWs for diagnostic testing at a CLIA-approved
laboratory; or (2) cross-validate results from a CLIA-approved laboratory for SARS-CoV-2 qPCRpositive individuals upon study enrolment. Individuals above the technical detection threshold, but
below the clinical referral threshold, were considered SARS-CoV-2 positive for the purposes of
our research.

were plated at 1–2 × 106 cells per well in a 96-well U-bottom plate. Cells were resuspended in
Live/Dead Fixable Aqua (ThermoFisher) for 20 min at 4 °C. Following a wash, cells were blocked
with Human TruStan FcX (BioLegend) for 10 min at RT. Cocktails of desired staining antibodies
were added directly to this mixture for 30 min at RT. For secondary stains, cells were first washed
and supernatant aspirated; then to each cell pellet a cocktail of secondary markers was added for
30 min at 4 °C. Prior to analysis, cells were washed and resuspended in 100 μl 4% PFA for 30
min at 4 °C. Following this incubation, cells were washed and prepared for analysis on an Attune
NXT (ThermoFisher). Data were analysed using FlowJo software version 10.6 software (Tree
Star). The specific sets of markers used to identify each subset of cells are summarized in

VeroE6 kidney epithelial cells) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 1% sodium pyruvate (NEAA) and 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C and
5% CO2. The cell line was obtained from the ATCC and has been tested negative for
contamination with mycoplasma. SARS-CoV-2, strain USA-WA1/2020, was obtained from BEI
Resources (#NR-52281) and was amplified in VeroE6 cells. Cells were infected at a MOI 0.01 for
four three days to generate a working stock and after incubation the supernatant was clarified by
centrifugation (450g × 5min) and filtered through a 0.45-micron filter. The pelleted virus was then
resuspended in PBS then aliquoted for storage at − 80°C. Viral titers were measured by standard
plaque assay using Vero E6 cells. Briefly, 300 µl of serial fold virus dilutions were used to infect
Vero E6 cells in MEM supplemented NaHCO3, 4% FBS 0.6% Avicel RC-581. Plaques were
resolved at 48h post infection by fixing in 10% formaldehyde for 1h followed by with 0.5% crystal
violet in 20% ethanol staining. Plates were rinsed in water to plaques enumeration. All
experiments were performed in a biosafety level 3 with the Yale Environmental Health and Safety
office approval.
Neutralization assay
Patients and healthy donors sera were isolated as before and then heat treated for 30m at 56 °C.
Sixfold serially diluted plasma, from 1:3 to 1:2430 were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 for 1 h at
37 °C. The mixture was subsequently incubated with Vero E6 cells in a 6-well plate for 1h, for
adsorption. Then, cells were overlayed with MEM supplemented NaHCO3, 4% FBS 0.6% Avicel
mixture. Plaques were resolved at 40h post infection by fixing in 10% formaldehyde for 1h followed
by staining in 0.5% crystal violet. All experiments were performed in parallel with negative controls
sera, in a establish viral concentration to generate 60-120 plaques/well.
Statistical analysis
All analysis of patient samples was conducted using Matlab 2020a, GraphPad Prism 9, and JMP
15. Patient heatmaps were clustered using the K-means algorithm. For Figure 1g, patient samples
with positive IgG values were z-scored and subsequently clustered using a spectral clustering
technique with a ‘cityblock’ distance metric (Matlab 2020a). Multiple group comparisons were
analyzed by running both parametric (ANOVA) and non-parametric (Kruskal–Wallis) statistical

between mild (orange), moderate (purple) and severe (pink) at the experimental sixfold serially dilutions
(from 1:3 to 1:2430). Total patients, n=63; Moderate, n=45; Severe, n=19. c, Levels of IgG (left) Anti-S,
(middle) RBD and (right) viral load between high neutralizers, deceased and discharged patients. The
indicated levels were measured at the average day from symptom onset in which each group reach 50%
of neutralization at each experimental serum dilution as specified in Figure 3f. HN, high neutralizers.
Extended Data Fig. 5 | Gating strategies. Gating strategies are shown for the key cell populations
described in Figure 1f and Extended Data Figure 3. a, Leukocyte gating strategy to identify lymphocytes
and granulocytes. b, T cell surface staining gating strategy to identify CD4 and CD8 T cells, TCRactivated T cells, follicular T cells, and additional subsets. c, B cell surface staining gating strategy to
identify B cells subsets.
Extended Data Tables 1-2 | Cohort demographics using two different stratification criteria. a,
IMPACT patients and Connecticut National Guard members (mild only) stratified by disease severity.
Exact counts are displayed in each cell, with standard deviations alongside. Percentages of total, where
applicable, are provided in parenthesis. In cases were specific demographic information was missing, the
total number of patients with complete information used for calculations is provided within the cell. b,
IMPACT patients stratified according to their assignment as high neutralizers, discharged patients, or
deceased patients. As before, exact counts are displayed in each cell, with standard deviations alongside.
Percentages of total, where applicable, are provided in parenthesis. In cases were specific demographic
information was missing, the total number of patients with complete information used for calculations is
