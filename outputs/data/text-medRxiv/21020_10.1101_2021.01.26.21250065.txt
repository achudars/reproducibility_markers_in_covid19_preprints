ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND
In 2020, U.S schools closed due to SARS-CoV-2 but their role in transmission was
unknown. In fall 2020, national guidance for reopening omitted testing or screening
recommendations. We report the experience of 2 large independent K-12 schools (School-A and
School-B) that implemented an array of SARS-CoV-2 mitigation strategies that included
periodic universal testing.
METHODS
SARS-CoV-2 was identified through periodic universal PCR testing, self-reporting of
tests conducted outside school, and contact tracing. Schools implemented behavioral and
structural mitigation measures, including mandatory masks, classroom disinfecting, and social
distancing.
RESULTS
Over the fall semester, School-A identified 112 cases in 2320 students and staff; SchoolB identified 25 cases (2.0%) in 1200 students and staff. Most cases were asymptomatic and none
required hospitalization. Of 69 traceable introductions, 63(91%) were not associated with
school-based transmission, 59 cases (54%) occurred in the 2 weeks post-Thanksgiving. In 6/7
clusters, clear noncompliance with mitigation protocols was found. The largest outbreak had 28
identified cases and was traced to an off-campus party. There was no transmission from students
to staff.
CONCLUSIONS
Although school-age children can contract and transmit SARS-CoV-2, rates of COVID19 infection related to in-person education were significantly lower than those in the surrounding

community. However, social activities among students outside of school undermined those
measures and should be discouraged, perhaps with behavioral contracts, to ensure the safety of
school communities. In addition, introduction risks were highest following extended school
breaks. These risks may be mitigated with voluntary quarantines and surveillance testing prior to
re-opening.

BACKGROUND
SARS-CoV2 is a novel, highly infectious virus spread via respiratory droplets. It first
appeared in December 2019 and has since spread to every country in the world. Infections have
been particularly virulent in the United States, with 19.2 million cases and >398,000 deaths as of
January 20, 2021 1.
The growing pandemic led to school closings throughout the country beginning in March
2020. Large numbers of children were rapidly transitioned to virtual instruction marking the
greatest challenge to the US educational system since the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. One
justification for the closings was concern that children are more likely to contract and spread
respiratory viruses in a congregate setting. However, research showed that schools played a
minor role in previous SARS and MERS-CoV outbreaks.
Although we learned much about the virus in the ensuing months, it remained unclear
how opening schools would affect transmission. Nonetheless, given the continued high levels of
infection in the US, most school districts either delayed in-person education for the first semester
of the 2020-21 school year or opted for a hybrid approach .
During summer 2020,, many political and health officials called for schools to reopen3 In
March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) posted guidelines for
managing school operations during the pandemic, updating them in August 2020 with a section
on the benefits of in-person schooling. Notably missing was any guidance on testing4 and CDC
did not release testing recommendations for schools until December 20205 While state and local
health authorities provided technical guidance consistent with national recommendations, they
were ill-equipped to provide specific advice on school-based testing. Furthermore, absent a
comprehensive national testing strategy and shortages of test kits, , they could not provide

resources to implement such testing. These circumstances left local school officials on their own
to determine reopening plans, including laboratory testing, and to identify the financial and
laboratory testing resources to implement such testing.
We report here on the experience of two independent K-12 schools, one in the Southeast
and one in the Mid-Atlantic, and their collaborative efforts to reopen for the 2020 fall semester.
Each school followed the CDC’s guidelines designed to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV2 while also including aggressive laboratory screening similar to that which colleges and
universities were implementing6. A critical aspect to the reopening was full transparency and
open communication with parents, staff, and students. The schools also recognized that
reopening would require continual reassessment and adjusting to changing community
epidemiology and resources.
We report our experience to identify the challenges and principles that policy makers and
educational leadership could follow to return to in-person learning while protecting students and
staff.

METHODS
Participants
Administrators at 2 independent, K-12 schools located in the South (School A) and MidAtlantic (School B) allowed the investigators to monitor their experiences as they returned to inperson learning during the fall semester of 2020. School A had 2299 students and staff; School B
had 1200. Their reopening plans differed slightly, but both were based on 4 major elements
(Table 1): stakeholder engagement, physical infrastructure, policies and operations, and

laboratory screening and testing of students and staff for SARS-CoV-2. Both plans were
developed in consultation with medical advisors.
Both schools had extensive contingency plans to close in-person learning and transition
to virtual education if needed. Key metrics used to determine whether to invoke these
contingency plans included community positivity rate, in-school positivity rate, and presence of
in-school transmission. In-school transmission was a key differentiator, because school
leadership acknowledged that introductions related to community exposures outside school
would occur at community rates - but a key element was making certain that schools did not play
a role in amplifying cases, i.e. limiting in-school transmission, and closing classrooms or perhaps
entire sections of the school, or changing protocols if in-school transmission started to climb.

SARS-CoV2 Testing
Laboratory screening protocols differed slightly by school and evolved over the course of
the fall semester based on testing options, availability, and logistics. Schools initially collected
nasopharynx samples from the entire student body and staff at biweekly or monthly intervals
depending on schedules and testing capacity. Each universal testing event required 2-3 days to
implement and to obtain all results. As the semester progressed, both schools transitioned from
nasal swab PCR to saliva-based tests by a vendor using the SalivaDirect™ Yale protocol7 ,
enabling more frequent testing..
Pooling of saliva specimens was performed with up to 24 specimens per pool. If a pool
was positive, individual samples were reflex tested either by SalivaDirect™ or a confirmatory
PCR, with results classified as positive, negative, or inconclusive within 48 hours of collection.

School officials then notified test participants of the results. A case was defined as a person with
a positive laboratory test for SARS-CoV-2.
For positive cases, school officials implemented contact tracing in conjunction with local
health authorities to determine the likely source of exposure. The infected person and those
within close proximity or where a potential breach of protective measures could be determined
were tested, quarantined, and asked to quarantine and report any symptoms.
As community rates rose in the fall, the schools tested specific populations such as
athletes more frequently. They also tested the entire school population after the Thanksgiving
break. Officials also encouraged parents to report any test results obtained outside the school.

Case Definitions and Exposure Estimation
Positive cases were identified as self-reported (SR) if the person was symptomatic or had
a known contact and was tested at school or independently; universal test (UT), if the person was
asymptomatic and tested as part of regular screening; or converted during quarantine (CDQ), if
the person was identified as a known contact due to UT or contact tracing and was quarantining
when they received a positive test. We used a cluster analysis for each case to identify common
linkages, source of introduction, and potential route of transmission.
To calculate the rate of asymptomatic versus symptomatic cases, we identified all cases
with symptoms detected through SR, UT, or CDQ and followed all asymptomatic individuals
identified, and asked individuals or their families to report any symptoms. We then calculated the
proportion of symptomatic cases by age cohort. Severe cases were defined as infected persons
requiring hospitalization. We defined a cluster as any event which involved 2 or more linked
cases in school.

Using data from UT and SR, we calculated the rate of virus introduction into each school
and the rate of transmission per introduction. To accurately determine the number of
introductions into the school setting, we excluded students from testing before school started
(Round 1), as those students did not enter the school and were hence not introductions. Selfreported cases occurring more than 1 week before UT; all cases affiliated with an off-campus,
non-school sanctioned event over Thanksgiving break; all secondary cases; and all self-reported
cases occurring after the last round of UT. This likely significantly underestimates transmission,
since we only analyzed cases with tracking data.

Data Analysis
We grouped those who tested positive into clusters based on the site of exposure (family,
community, or school). We then calculated the average reproductive rate as the number of
secondary cases generated by contact with the infectious person.
We calculated the binomial confidence intervals (CI) using Jeffrey’s interval. We used a
CI with accepted multipliers for incidence based on local seroprevalence to compare in-school
versus community cases.
We calculated the average number of infections related to the initial infectious individual
to determine the reproduction number of the virus in the school community8, R0.. Here we
assume that each outbreak represents only one generation of transmission. Since the overall rate
of transmission, conditional on infection, is low, this assumption is valid (assuming that
secondary infections follow the same low rate). With this assumption the estimated rate of spread
will slightly overestimate the real rate. We used the maximum likelihood estimator for negative
binomial distribution of the outbreak sizes to estimate the overdispersion parameter k. Our model

also used the viral reproduction rates to assess the relationship between testing frequency and
delayed detection on the potential number of cases. All analysis was done using the R statistical
computing environment9.

RESULTS
School A reported 109 confirmed COVID-19 cases (4.9% of students, faculty, and staff)
between August 5, 2020 and December 20, 2020 (Table 3). Sixty cases (54%) were identified
through the 9 rounds of UT; 22 (20%) through contact investigation based on UT-identified
cases; and 30 (27.8%) self-reported. Eleven (10%) of cases in school A were identified during
the initial testing (n=11), and 59 (54%) were identified during the 3 weeks following the
Thanksgiving break.
School B reported 25 confirmed COVID-19 cases (2.0% of students, faculty, and staff)
between August 24 and December 20. Twenty-one cases (84%) were identified through UT; 1
(4%) through contact investigation resulting from a UT case; and 3 (12%) were self-reported. In
both schools, cases peaked in the period after school breaks (summer holiday, fall break, and
Thanksgiving break) (Figure 2). The detailed tables of testing results in both schools are
available in the Supplemental Material. Adults in both schools were more likely than lower
school students to demonstrate symptoms at the time of testing (47.6% vs 2.6%) (Table 2). No
cases require hospitalization.
Differences between the schools that may account for disparities in testing results include
size of the student and staff testing; testing frequency; and continuance of sports, since the
largest outbreak at School A was linked to a non-school sanctioned, sports-related event.

Community incidence rates
As Figure 1 shows, community incidence rates correlated with school infections (Pearson
correlation 0.9, p<0.01 for School A; 0.8, p< 0.05 for School B) There was no correlation
between community positivity rates and in-school introduction (School A, correlation 0.57,
P>0.1; School B: correlation 0.27, P>0.1). Using multipliers based on contemporaneous
seroprevalence studies, we found that in-school rates were consistently below community
infection rates.
In-school transmission
Nine percent of the 69 introduced cases in both schools transmitted the virus (Figure 3).
Five secondary infections from the 45 introduced cases occurred in School A; 1 secondary
infection from the 24 introduced cases occurred in School B. The risk of an outbreak per
introduction and per infected individual are described in Table 3, and the R0 (reproduction
number) was consistently low; 0.47 in School A and 0.05 in School B.
The outbreak clusters are described in more detail in Table 4. Of the 6 outbreaks
observed in school A, the minimum number of secondary cases was 3. The relative lack of
transmission singletons, but many non-transmission events suggests an overdispersed chance of
transmission in School A. School B was not overdispersed, since the only outbreak had a single
transmission event - the smallest dispersion possible, although we did not have the statistical
power to conclude this definitively. There was no evidence of student-to-teacher or teacher to
student transmission in either school.

Infection source

Seventy two percent of in-school transmission cases in School A were associated with
noncompliance with school mask wearing rules. Of known off-campus sources, the major ones
identified were family exposure, including siblings returning from college; off-campus activities,
including parties and other gatherings. However, the source of the majority of infections could
not be determined.

DISCUSSION
This study evaluated the experience of two large independent K-12 schools which
implemented in-person instruction accompanied with multifaceted SARS-CoV2 mitigation
strategies which included universal periodic testing of all students and staff. Both schools were
able to successfully maintain in-person schooling for the full fall 2020 semester, despite rising
community numbers and other neighboring school closures.
There were 4 key findings from this study. First, while school-conducted universal testing
showed that children can contract and spread SARS-CoV-2, the majority of cases these schools
identified did not lead to larger chains of transmission.. Indeed, , with the mitigation measures
implemented there was a significantly lower transmission rate than seen, without such measures,
as has been seen in previous respiratory virus seasons with other viruses such as influenza10.
These data are consistent with recent reports from Europe which also found that school-based
transmission is low11,12. The occurrence of many outbreaks when protocols were not fully
followed shows how important these measures are for keeping transmission rates low.
Second, we found no correlation between in-school infections and community positivity
rates, which calls into question the use of community positivity rates as a metric for school
openings and closings. However, we did find a correlation with actual community incidence.

Part of this may represent the realities of community testing. In our schools, the school, positivity
rates (positives/total number of tests) and case incidence (positive tests /population) are the same,
because everybody is tested. In the community they are different, because only a small
proportion of the community are being tested In-school introductions did correlate well with
community cases per 1,000 population.
Third, we also found that the distribution of secondary infections (transmission) is
bimodal, with 91% of identified cases having no secondary transmission, and 9% of introduced
cases accounting for all the identified clusters. The majority of clusters occurred when
mitigation protocols were not followed, whether in or out of school. When secondary
transmission occurred, the resulting clusters in School A included at least 5 additional cases.
These clusters might be considered small “super spreader events” and are consistent with other
studies of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. They also highlight the effectiveness of mitigation
protocols in preventing transmission.
Finally, based on the chronology of infections, the rate of positive cases was highest
following school breaks and when there was clear evidence of students attending social or family
events in the community, and lowest when in-person schooling continued uninterrupted. Indeed,
in-school infections peaked each time students returned from a prolonged school break.
The schools’ testing protocols had additional benefits. They served as a gauge of the
effectiveness of mitigation protocols when adhered to; identified risky activities; enabled school
officials to adjust protocols and processes in real time; and provided reassurance for families and
faculty. Although we believe that our identification of individual sporadic cases prevented the
further development of case clusters, this cannot be quantified with the data we have available.

We found that temperature screening was not useful, because nearly all cases identified were
asymptomatic. School B also implemented SARS-CoV2 sewage surveillance, however, results
from that activity were not useful in real-time in identifying new case incidence due to delays in
obtaining results as well as the difficulty in interpreting positive results in a 1200 person school
community.
Methods to further identify the role of schools in viral transmission include surveillance
screening in schools during periods of more intense community transmission and outbreak
investigations in schools with assessments of secondary household transmission. Until this work
is complete, it would be premature to draw definitive conclusions on the importance of schools
as part of community transmission.

Limitations
Our report has 2 major limitations. First, our data reflect the experience of 2 schools that
were able to invest substantial financial, logistical and organizational resources in a testing
program. We recognize that these resources are not available to the vast majority of institutions.
However, our goal was to assess the experience of these schools and the importance of regular
testing in safely returning children to school.
The second major limitation is the adaptive testing protocol used over the 4-month
period, in which the protocol changed in real time based on availability of testing resources. The
schools initially began with less frequent testing than recommended in settings with a high risk
of transmission13. Modeling results showed that school transmission might have gone undetected
with the lower frequency of testing. However, when less expensive and easier-to-implement
pooled saliva testing became available, each school increased its testing frequency. This design,

wherein each round of testing was used to decide how frequently to repeat the screening process,
was sufficient to confirm the risk of introductions and school transmission.
Our modeling estimates are limited, since the number of outbreaks was small and we
were only able to identify one generation of infection. Therefore, our estimate of R0 is an upper
bound. Nevertheless, we found that our R0 estimates were consistently substantially below 1,
indicating that in-school transmissions did not represent sustainable outbreaks.

CONCLUSIONS
These results highlight that while SARS-CoV-2 is infectious in children, in schools
which implemented a comprehensive strategy, transmission can be controlled. Testing is a key
tool in identifying asymptomatic cases. , with testing being a key tool in the arsenal. Our data
highlights the challenge of asymptomatic infections, out-of-school social activities, violation of
face mask rules, and return to school after extended breaks.
Given that the vast majority of our youngest students were asymptomatic at time of
testing, this presents an additional challenge to schools and requires strict adherence to protective
protocols. However, it does bear highlighting that few cases occurred in staff, and that these all
seemed to have had out-of-school introduction sources. Also, there were no severe cases among
students or staff. Given that both schools are well-resourced, with a population that likely has a
lower burden of chronic disease and better access to medical care, the exact consequence of these
introductions in less well-resourced communities is not known.
In addition, the greatest vulnerability for transmission was a lack of protocol adherence in
school and during off-campus parties, particularly around the holidays. As schools open,
awareness of these key vulnerability points will be crucial.

These results suggest that the transmission of the SARS-CoV-19 virus between children
and adults may differ from influenza virus transmission. In primary and secondary schools with
comprehensive infection mitigation programs SARS-CoV-19 transmission can be either be
prevented or managed effectively, and may represent a different epidemiology compared to
colleges and universities14. However, we recognize that because these institutions are residential
settings, they differ substantially from the typical K-12 school.
The experience of these 2 independent K-12 schools show that in-person schooling can
be conducted relatively safely, but not risk free, even in areas with moderate community
COVID-19 incidence, if structural and behavioral mitigation strategies, augmented by aggressive
testing, are implemented.
These results should encourage educational decision makers to assess their ability to
provide periodic laboratory screening as way to identify virus infections and limit in-school and
community transmission.
However, to bring this level of testing and behavioral change to schools with fewer
resources will require that educators and public health officials provide significant financial and
logistical support to enable schools to institute these protocols.

IMPLICATIONS FOR SCHOOL HEALTH
The experiences of these 2 schools show that structural and behavioral mitigation
strategies together with aggressive testing can safely allow a return to in-person education in K12 grades, even in areas with moderate community COVID-19 prevalence. Such an approach
could also detect the beginnings of larger outbreaks that may require a switch to remote learning.

These findings are particularly important in the context of the growing consensus that in-person
schooling is critical for educational and social development of children3,15.
Our findings also suggest that implementing universal screening and following mitigation
measures could have a behavior-modifying and protective benefit for students, school staff, and
the community. Whether testing can serve an adjunctive role in ensuring adherence to mitigation
measures seems likely but cannot be definitively determined.
Thus, there is a critical need for educational and public health support of rapid expansion
of school-based testing capacity and the resources required if communities are to return to inperson education. Public policies that support in-person education during the SARS-CoV2
pandemic need to recognize these issues, and support lesser resourced schools with the testing,
financial, logistical , staffing, and training resources to safely return children to school.

Potential infectious event

A younger sibling student had been
symptomatic and stayed home; the
older sibling was tested in universal
testing and found to be positive. A
younger sibling then tested and was
found to be positive. A classmate of the
younger sibling was found to be positive
on the next round of weekly testing

Cluster 4
universal laboratory screening, 4
individuals in one lower school class were
confirmed as cases and an additional
person had an inconclusive test result. On
repeat testing, the student with the
inconclusive test result was confirmed as a
case. Repeat testing then found two
additional students in the same class
infected and one sibling who converted in
quarantine.
