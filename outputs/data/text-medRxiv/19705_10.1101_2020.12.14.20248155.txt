Investigating mental and physical disorders associated with COVID-19 in online health forums

Abstract
Objectives: Online health forums provide rich and untapped real-time data on population
health. Through novel data extraction and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we
characterise the evolution of mental and physical health concerns relating to the COVID-19
pandemic among online health forum users.
Setting and design: We obtained data from 739,434 posts by 53,134 unique users of three
leading online health forums: HealthBoards, Inspire and HealthUnlocked, from the period 1st
January 2020 to 31st May 2020. Using NLP, we analysed the content of posts related to
COVID-19.
Primary outcome measures:
(i)
Proportion of forum posts containing COVID-19 keywords
(ii)
Proportion of forum users making their very first post about COVID-19
(iii) Number of COVID-19 related posts containing content related to physical and
mental health comorbidities
Results: Posts discussing COVID-19 and related comorbid disorders spiked in early- to midMarch around the time of global implementation of lockdowns prompting a large number of
users to post on online health forums for the first time. The pandemic and corresponding
public response has had a significant impact on posters’ queries regarding mental health.
Conclusions: We demonstrate it is feasible to characterise the content of online health forum
user posts regarding COVID-19 and measure changes over time. Social media data sources
such as online health forums can be harnessed to strengthen population-level mental health
surveillance.

Article Summary
Strengths and limitations of this study
1. Analysing online health forum data using NLP revealed a substantial rise in activity
which correlated with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
2. Real-time data sources such as online health forums are essential for monitoring
fluctuating population health and tailoring responses to daily pressures.
3. It is not yet possible to establish COVID-19 status or whether concerned posters have
pre-existing mental or physical health issues, are recovered, or have become unwell
for the first time.
4. Online health forums are help-seeking forums, which introduces self-selection bias.

Investigating mental and physical disorders associated with COVID-19 in online health forums

Introduction
Measures to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in unprecedented societal
restrictions worldwide. The mental health impacts of these measures and accompanying
socioeconomic stressors are likely to be extensive; identifying and quantifying these impacts
are now an urgent priority.[1] For example, social distancing restrictions make it harder to
maintain regular contact between individuals and their friends and family as well as health
and social care professionals. Furthermore, the psychological and emotional burden of the
pandemic (and its consequences) may increase risk of relapse or worsen existing mental
health disorders. Conversely, mental disorders can increase susceptibility to infections.[2,3]
Real-world data from online resources may be extracted using natural language processing
(NLP) techniques to provide automated, population-level health surveillance. These methods
can be used to rapidly ascertain discussion related to COVID-19 and associated symptoms
and comorbidities. NLP has previously been used to identify medically relevant information
from web pages and analyse extracted text.[4,5] Applying these techniques to real world data
sources such as social media and online forums may be used to supplement active data
collection from participants in prospective observational research. Recent studies have
applied this approach to Twitter, Facebook and Reddit data to forecast the emergence of
depression and post-traumatic stress disorder,[6] predict depression in the general
population,[7] identify mothers at risk of postpartum depression,[8] and investigate suicidal
ideation.[9]
While social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Reddit are commonly used,
other internet resources such as online health forums have so far been neglected. Online
health forums are enriched for health information and receive millions of posts each year,
therefore providing untapped reservoirs of healthcare data at population level.
In a recent proof-of-concept study we demonstrated that online health forums can be
extracted to detect health discussion trends that correlate with real-life events.[10] Here, we
use the same technology to analyse online health forum data discussing mental and physical
health problems associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. We use NLP techniques to extract
data from online health forum posts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, references to
specific comorbid illnesses, and their direct and indirect impacts on mental or physical health.

Investigating mental and physical disorders associated with COVID-19 in online health forums

Methods
Study Design and Setting
We obtained data from online health forums using NLP. Online forums are discussion
websites hosted on the internet where people hold conversations in the form of posted
messages. A single conversation is called a thread. Threads are chains of posts identified
within a forum by a title and an individual URL. Clicking on the thread title opens the thread
which contains one or more posts which may be from the same user who started the thread
(i.e. the original poster) or different users who have replied within the thread. In this study,
we analysed text data in thread titles and in individual posts within a thread. We analysed
posts written in English only. Depending on the forum's settings, users can be anonymous or
have to register with the forum to post messages, with most users opting not to use personally
identifiable information to register their account. Registration may not be required for readonly access. Most forums recommend that users do not use personally identifiable
information when posting. Online health forums specifically cover health topics and offer
peer support for various health conditions.
We collected data from three major online health forums posted from 1st January 2020 to 31st
May 2020: HealthBoards (www.healthboards.com), Inspire (www.inspire.com) and
HealthUnlocked (www.healthunlocked.com). These forums were chosen on the basis that
they have global user coverage, include subforums on several aspects of healthcare, have a
large user base contributing to regular activity on the forum, and are feasible to extract
information from using NLP.
HealthBoards was founded in California, USA in 1997 and offers patient to patient health
support. Inspire, founded in 2005, is a US healthcare social network managing online support
groups for patients and caregivers. HealthUnlocked is a British online health forum launched
in 2011 with a similar offering to HealthBoards and Inspire. Registration and participation in
all three forums are free of charge to users.
Analysis Using NLP
Definition of search terms
To investigate the potential impact of COVID-19 on users posting in online health forums,
we classified threads and posts using keywords related to the COVID-19 pandemic and
various groups of case-insensitive keywords relating to medical treatment in an intensive care
unit or physical symptoms as a direct consequence of COVID-19 infection or mental health
symptoms as a consequence of measures in response to the pandemic.
Search terms used to identify whether a thread or post was related to COVID-19 were 'covid',
'covid-19', 'coronavirus', 'corona', 'sars-cov-2', 'sars-2', 'shielding', 'pandemic*', 'vulnerable',
'quarantine', 'lockdown', 'distancing', 'isolation', 'isolating' where * indicates a wildcard search
term.

Investigating mental and physical disorders associated with COVID-19 in online health forums

Table 1 provides the final keywords used to search posts within COVID-19 related threads;
the Python coded search terms are provided in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3. We tested the
specificity of keywords by searching for matches occurring before 1st January 2020. For
threads, these were matches in the title and URL, while for posts, these were matches in the
entire text (see Extracting and matching keywords below). Term incidence and excluded
keywords are provided in Supplementary Table 5.
Data pre-processing
Data obtained from different online health forums come in various formats. We standardised
and normalised the data before analysing them. This included normalisation of Unicode
strings and whitespace characters, standardisation of date and time, and standardisation of
location through the GeoNames.org database.
Extracting and matching keywords
We extracted the keywords in thread titles and post content using lemmatisation. For
flexibility and efficiency, search terms in posts and thread titles were matched using regular
expressions that accounted for both inflection and common spelling variants. Matching was
case-insensitive and limited to whole words in the post content and thread title; when
matching thread URLs, parts containing words were considered. To prevent spurious
matches, words shorter than four letters (e.g. ICU) were considered valid matches only if they
were delimited by non-word characters.
Analysis of COVID-19 threads to identify changes in COVID-19 related user activity and
physical and mental health associations over time
We identified the users contributing to a COVID-19 related thread in a given week. We then
retrieved all the other posts made by the same authors in the previous, same and subsequent
calendar weeks. We scanned such posts for physical symptom, mental health symptom or
intensive care keywords as defined in Table 1, and recorded whether each of these topics was
mentioned by the author during the time window. We performed this analysis to establish
variations in the prevalence of concerns relating to physical symptom, mental health
symptom and intensive care keywords over the course of the pandemic during 2020. Weekly
counts were measured each Sunday for the previous week.
Analysis of thread titles
We inspected thread titles to identify how many mentioned a comorbidity in the title. We
searched for terms related to autoimmune disorders, mental disorders or worry, cancer,
cardiovascular problems or stroke, and diabetes as listed in Table 2; the Python coded search
terms are provided in Supplementary Table 4.
Analysis of first-time posters in a COVID-19 related thread
We analysed the first ever post published by a user to determine the proportion of first-time
posters who started out by contributing to a COVID-19 related thread. We performed this

analysis to determine the degree to which new users were motivated to make their first post
in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic and how this varied over time during 2020.
Implementation and computation
All descriptive analyses were performed using bespoke software written in Python. An
outline of the coding approach employed is included in the Supplementary Material.
Ethics and Data Sharing
We consulted and adhered to internet research guidelines from the Association of Internet
Researchers [11] and the British Psychological Society (BPS) [12] to inform study
development.
All data have been provided in aggregate form to protect the privacy of forum users. As we
analysed data in aggregate form, it was not possible to seek individual user consent.
However, users were aware that their data were available for anyone to view online by virtue
of contributing to publicly available online health forums. Of note, the BPS guidelines advise
that “valid consent should be obtained where it cannot be reasonably argued that online data
can be considered ‘in the public domain’ or that undisclosed usage is justified on scientific
value grounds”. This approach is consistent with similar studies examining healthcare related
data from Twitter.[13,14]
QMUL is registered as a data controller with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO;
registration number: Z5507327), which covers all research activities undertaken at the
university. All data were analysed on QMUL IT facilities, which employs a two-layer
security model as per their security policy.
Given licensing and privacy issues, it is not possible to publicly release the aggregate dataset
generated from the three online health forums investigated. However, we welcome
collaboration with other researchers and healthcare policy makers. Anyone interested in
accessing the aggregate data and data analysis code should contact the guarantor
(f.smeraldi@qmul.ac.uk).
Patient and public involvement
As the data were analysed in aggregate form it was not possible to involve individual forum
users in the design or conduct of the study.

Investigating mental and physical disorders associated with COVID-19 in online health forums

Results
Related posts and active threads
HealthUnlocked was the most frequently used forum accounting for 97% of overall posts and
97% of posts mentioning COVID-19 in the thread title or post content during the study period
(Table 3).
Weekly post count for HealthUnlocked peaked in mid-March. Post count for Inspire declined
sharply in the last two weeks of March. Post count for HealthBoards declined slowly across
the entirety of the observation period (Supplementary Figure 1).
Across all three forums, there were a total of 3,342 threads containing a COVID-19 keyword
within the thread title or URL. These contained a total of 44,894 posts during the study
period (1st January 2020 to 31st May 2020). A total of 35,581 posts (whether in COVID-19
related threads or otherwise) contained a COVID-19 keyword during the study period. The
proportion of posts containing COVID-19 keywords increased rapidly across all forums in
early March (Supplementary Figures 2 and 3), corresponding with the World Health
Organisation’s declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11th March 2020. The smaller
online forums (Inspire and HealthBoards) had a greater peak in percentage of total posts
containing COVID-19 keywords. The total number of posts containing COVID-19 search
terms declined from mid-April onwards.
For quite a long period, most posts about COVID-19 (over 90% at the beginning of the
observation period, and remaining above 50% until the week ending 29th March) were written
by users who had not yet posted on the topic. By the end of the observation period, the
percentage of weekly posts in COVID-19 threads written by new entrants to the discussion
reduced to a still quite sizeable 30%. While many of these users may have posted before on
the forum about other topics, Supplementary Figure 4 presents the proportion of posters
whose very first post to a forum appeared in a COVID-19 related thread. This figure peaked
above 20% in the week ending 22nd March. Considering that these forums have a very broad
spectrum, this is a remarkably high fraction. It includes both new joiners and users who were
previously silent members of the forums, possibly for a long time (so-called “lurkers”), and
who may have been spurred into a more active role by the pandemic.
Thread title analysis
Over a quarter of COVID-19 related thread titles mentioned another condition of interest
(Table 4). After cancer and autoimmune diseases, mental health represented a major area of
concern for online health forum users posting about COVID-19, comparable to respiratory
and circulatory diseases (Table 2). Around 0.5% of thread titles mentioned two or more
comorbidities.
User analysis
Posts in threads related to COVID-19 were analysed to determine the number of users
contributing in each given week. For each active user, all posts in the previous, same and

following calendar weeks were scanned irrespective of thread for mentions of physical
symptom, mental health symptom or intensive care keywords. The number of active users
mentioning each of these concerns peaked in the week ending 22nd March and subsequently
declined but still remained elevated above the January baseline. In particular, users
discussing mental health outnumbered users mentioning the other topics (Figure 1).

Investigating mental and physical disorders associated with COVID-19 in online health forums

Discussion
Using a novel technique to analyse data from online health forums, we found a marked
increase in posts related to COVID-19 across the observation period of 1st January 2020 to
31st May 2020. The frequency of these posts increased rapidly in early March 2020
corresponding with the World Health Organisation’s declaration of COVID-19 as a
pandemic.
During this period, we found mental health symptom keywords were most frequently
mentioned by authors of COVID-19 related posts (either contextually or in separate
messages), followed by physical symptoms and intensive care keywords, suggesting that the
pandemic and public health response to it has had a significant impact on posters’ concerns
regarding mental health. The marked increase in mental health symptom related posts in early
March, when the WHO declared the COVID-19 pandemic, correlates with preliminary
worldwide data that show increases in anxiety and depression in response to the outbreak.
The mental health impacts of COVID-19 and associated physical distancing restrictions are
likely to be extensive and wide-reaching. There is a growing body of evidence supporting the
neuropsychiatric effects of coronavirus infections.[15] Restrictions fuel socioeconomic
stressors such as unemployment, loneliness and financial burden, which are all implicated in
the development of mental ill health.[16] Increased rates of bereavement, newfound caring
responsibilities and interruptions to education are likely to be particularly stressful to children
and young adults.[17]
A preliminary survey of 3,545 German respondents found evidence of substantial mental
health burden from travel and physical distancing restrictions, including increased levels of
stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, sleep disturbance and irritability.[18] Worsening
mental health has been confirmed in samples with both pre- and post-pandemic information
for direct comparison: The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC)
study found probable anxiety disorder doubled compared to pre-pandemic sizes (26% vs
13%) and lower wellbeing, particularly in young people, women and those with pre-existing
conditions.[19] The literature on social media mining for COVID-19 mental health related
trends is limited. A study analysing sentiment evolution trends of four emotions across
Twitter – fear, anger, sadness, joy – has been able to identify developing shared distress, and
topics of interest relating to those emotions.[20]
Our findings also suggest that mental and physical health concerns documented in online
forum posts have levelled off following their peak in March 2020. The number of users
active in COVID-19 threads who also wrote posts concerning mental health symptoms
reduced from their peak in March of 1,355 (per week) to 253 by the end of the observation
period (compared to a mean number of 30 per week in January), suggesting that as time went
on most users had begun to adjust to the consequences of the pandemic. Other NLP studies
have also identified a similar trend. An analysis of 10 million Google searches within the
United States found large shifts in mental health symptom searches linked to stay-at-home

orders in the United States across the week commencing 16th March 2020.[21] Searches for
topics related to anxiety, negative thoughts about oneself and the future, insomnia and
suicidal ideation dramatically increased prior to stay-at-home orders, levelling off upon the
announcement of stay-at-home orders. These patterns were relatively unique to searches for
mental health related information and not physical conditions.
Over the entire period, on average 4% of first-time posters (over 20% in the peak period)
made their very first contribution to the forum in a COVID-19 related thread. Furthermore,
77% of COVID-19 threads were started by users who had never posted about the topic
before, and chose to start out by creating their own thread. A certain degree of motivation is
required to take someone to the point of making that first post on a forum, and also for
starting a thread; our finding suggests that the pandemic is driving users to engage more
actively in community forum services in times of uncertainty.
Strengths and weaknesses
Online health forums are an important source of real-world, real-time, population-level data
on people living through the COVID-19 pandemic. Online health forums also afford users
anonymity to discuss aspects of their experience they might otherwise have been embarrassed
or fearful to disclose in identifiable forms of social media. We have demonstrated that it is
possible to automate information extraction from these posts using natural language
processing, providing access to a rich reservoir of previously untapped real-world data from
health-specific online resources.
Our approach was able to automatically extract data from a large sample of over 53,000
unique users at a fraction of the cost of previous approaches that have relied on social media
individual participant recruitment and manual review of posts generating sample sizes in the
low hundreds.[7] Some studies screened users on Twitter via depression symptom
questionnaires and used their tweets to train depression onset classifiers.[6,22] Analogous
approaches have been used with Facebook data.[8]
Our study has some limitations. At present it is difficult to establish whether concerned
posters have pre-existing mental or physical health issues, have experienced confirmed
COVID-19 illness themselves, are recovered, or have become unwell for the first time.
Online health forums are help-seeking communities; this introduces self-selection bias in
which individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds who do not have IT equipment/network
connection to access online resources are under-represented and our results are therefore not
generalisable to the entire population. Furthermore, as these forums have worldwide coverage
we cannot isolate trends to one geographic region. However, future work could utilise the
location data (see Data pre-processing in Methods) to explore this avenue.
Conclusions and future research
Publicly accessible sources of real-world data, such as online health forums analysed in this
study, can strengthen population-level physical and mental health surveillance and provide a
rapid and inexpensive means to inform public healthcare policy. We found that the majority

of posts in online forum data related to COVID-19 concerned features related to mental
health and that the peak in frequency of posts corresponded with the early phase of the
pandemic, indicating the significant impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of susceptible
populations.
As the pandemic evolves, further research using online forum data could improve our
understanding of the long-term consequences of COVID-19 infection [23] and the longerterm socioeconomic consequences of travel and physical distancing restrictions that have
been employed in many countries to manage viral transmission.[24,25] Analysis of realworld data, including social media and online health forums, could provide a useful insight
into attitudes and perceptions towards novel therapeutics. This will be crucial to maximising
uptake of effective preventative approaches such as mask-wearing, physical distancing,
hygiene measures and potential vaccines.
