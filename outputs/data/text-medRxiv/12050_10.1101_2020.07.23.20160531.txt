Infectious disease outbreaks are expected to grow exponentially in time when left unchecked. Containment measures such as lockdown and social distancing can drastically alter the growth dynamics
of the outbreak. This is the case for the 2019-2020 COVID-19 outbreak, which is characterized by a
power law growth. Strikingly however, the power law exponent is different across countries. Here I
illustrate the relationship between these two extreme scenarios, exponential and power law growth,
based on the impact of superspreaders and lockdown strategies to contain the outbreak. The theory
predicts a relationship between the power law exponent and the time interval between the first case
and lockdown that is validated by the observed COVID-19 data across different countries.

Research from the late 90s and the 2000s uncovered
the heterogeneity of social connectivity patterns, causing deviations from common expectations [1–4]. Superspreaders are the manifestation of this heterogeneity in
the contest of infectious disease outbreaks: most infected
individuals infect a few other people, but a few infected
superspreaders infect many people [5]. More precisely,
superspreaders are primary cases generating a number
of secondary cases much larger than the median of secondary cases generated by all infected individuals. The
existence of superspreaders was noticed in the 2002-2004
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, as
well as in the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome
(MERS) outbreak. It is then not surprising that superspreaders have been observed in the ongoing COVID-19
outbreak [6–8].
In an earlier work, I investigated the influence of superspreaders on infectious disease outbreaks [9]. These analyses showed that superspreaders can lead to a new type
of infectious disease dynamics that is better described by
a power law growth. Recent reports indicate that the
COVID-19 outbreak is in fact better fitted by a power
law growth rather than an exponential growth [10, 11].
Here I provide further support for the power law growth
by linking the power law exponent with the timescales of
the outbreak.
Spreading processes are generally modelled using differential equations [3], generating functions [12] or
branching process formulations [9, 13]. I will adopt the
branching process formulation because it provides an intuitive understanding of how the superspreaders and the
lockdown affect the outbreak dynamics. Figure 1A shows
a schematic representation of a causal tree of disease
transmission associated with an epidemic outbreak. The
root of the tree is patient zero. Every other node represents an individual that was infected during the outbreak.
Each link represents the transmission of the disease from
one individual (the primary case) to another individual
(the secondary case).

At the first generation we expect R0 infected individuals, where R0 is the average number of infectious generated by patient zero. At the second generation we expect
R0 R infected individuals, where R is the average number of infectious generated by patients other than patient
zero. By applying the latter rule recursively we will expect
zd = N0 R0 Rd−1

(1)

infected individuals at the generation d of the disease
transmission tree. Here N0 represents the number of patients zero. N0 can be 1 or larger depending how many
individuals got infected from the original source, e.g. an
animal host or another country.
Notice that I have made an explicit distinction between
patient zero and any other infected individual. This is
done to take into consideration that the process of disease transmission introduces a bias in the connectivity
statistics of infected individuals. For example, consider
a model where each individual i is in close proximity
with other individuals at a rate λi , measured in proximity contacts per unit of time. Patient zero is an individual selected with uniform probability 1/N , where N is
the population size. Each time patient zero is in close
proximity with another individual, the latter is infected
with probability r, where r is the probability of disease
transmission upon contact. If T = 1/γ is the infectious
period, the inverse of the recovery rate γ, and βi = rλi
is the rate of disease transmission, then patient zero will
generate the average number of secondary cases given by
R0 =

X 1

rλi =

(2)

In contrast, subsequent infected individuals are not selected at random from the population. In a fully mixed
population, when an infected case is in close proximity
to another individual, the probability that it is the i-th
individual is λi /N hλi. In turn, if i gets infected it will
transmit the disease at a rate rλi = βi . Therefore

which is the average reproductive numbers of the root

link from where the node gets infected.
To determine the number of new infectious at a given
time, we need to make a mapping from generation to
infection time. For an infected individual at generation

where τid is the disease transmission time from the primary case at layer d − 1 to the secondary case at layer

case, then the probability distribution that an infected
individual at generation d gets infected at time t is given
by the d − 1 order convolution of g(t), denoted by

fd (t) = g (d−1)? (t)

If infected individuals are removed at a rate γ, then the
generation time distribution is exponential, g(t) = γe−γt
with average generation time T = 1/γ. In this particular
case we can derive an analytic expression

The latter result is similar to what obtained in static networks [3, 9, 12], where the reproductive number is proportional to the ratio between the first and second moments of the degree distribution. The mapping between
the contact dynamics and static network representation
can be done after taking into account that the number
of contacts in a time interval T follows a Poisson distribution, resulting in the degree distribution

From the latter equation we can calculate the first and
second moment of the degree distribution, obtaining
hki = hλiT and hk(k − 1)i = hλ2 iT /hλi, respectively.
Substituting these values into equations (2) and (3) we

Now we are ready to complete the mapping from generations to time. From equations (1) and (9) it follows
that the average number of new infections at time t is
given by

where D is the final generation, when the outbreak ends

formal derivation of equation (11) can be found in [9, 13].
To understand the impact of superspreaders and lockdown, let us have a look at the two trees of disease transmission in Fig. 1A and B. In Fig. 1A most individuals
transmit the disease approximately to the same number
of other individuals, and the chain of transmissions extends in this manner over several generations. When D is

very large, equation (11) represents the Taylor expansion
of the exponential, resulting in
(12)

This approximation is valid for γtR  D. If R > 1
then the outbreak grows exponentially over time, else if
R < 1 the outbreak decays exponentially. This is the
canonical expectation of infectious disease dynamics. In
this scenario the key quantity is the reproductive number
R and interventions strategies are focused on bringing it
below 1.
However, there are a number of assumptions behind
equation (12) that make it inadequate to model all infectious diseases outbreaks. First, we have just assumed
that D is large, i.e. that the free spreading of the disease
goes over several generations. That would typically be
true for infectious diseases with mild symptoms such as
the common cold, but it is not the case for COVID-19.
The mortality and hospitalization rate of COVID-19 infections have led governments to impose strict lockdown
measures. As a consequence, the tree of disease transmission is truncated after a few generations, as shown in
Fig. 1B.
Second, there are superspreaders. The reproductive
number of individuals other than patient zero is proportional to the ratio between the second and first moments
of the distributions of contact rates. If there is a wide
variation of contact rates in the population, hβ 2 i  hβi,
and the probability of disease transmission upon contact
is high, then according to equation (3) R will be large.
In the specific case of the COVID-19 outbreak, the probability distribution qk of secondary cases k generated by
a primary case has a fat tail. The fat tail is well approximated by the power law qk ∼ k −γ1 , where γ1 ≈ 2
based on world-wide data [14]. The exponent γ1 = 2
is the expectation for a contagion spreading in networks
with multiple topologies and therefore it has a theoretical
P
foundation [15]. When γ1 ≤ 2, the value of R = k qk k
is ill-defined, it will increase as more disease transmissions are allowed. When γ1 ' 2 the value of R is well
defined but it will be very large, diverging as γ1 → 2.
When these two elements are taken into consideration,
a small number of generations D and the existence of superspreaders, then equation (11) is better approximated
by [9]
I(t) ≈

γN0 R0 RD−1
(γt)D−1 e−γt
(D − 1)!

(13)

This approximation is valid for γtR  D. In short, the
number of infected cases from one generation to the next
can increase so dramatically that the number of new daily
infectious will be dominated by the time the individuals
at the last generation get infected. The power law behaviour predicted by equation (13) is so different from
the readily explainable exponential behaviour (12) that
it has been neglected for 14 years.
Equation (13) makes a testable prediction, that the
exponent of the power law growth, I(t) ∼ tα , depends on

In turn, D can be estimated as the number generations

where tL is the time when the lockdown was implemented
and t0 is the time when the first case was reported. T , as

yields

To test equation (16), I collected data for the observed
power law exponents. Singer has conducted an extensive
analysis of the fitting of a power law or logistic growth
to the plot of new infections as a function of time [11].
Here, I focus on those countries were the power law fit
was dimmed a better fit than a logistic function. As
an example, Fig. 2 shows the data for the Netherlands.
The log-log plot emphasizes the power low growth of the
outbreak before lockdown (Fig. 2, red line). The power
law exponents are reported in the Table 3 of Ref. [11].
In parallel, I have estimated the power law exponent
using equation (16). To this end, the time of first confirmed case were retrieved from the World Health Organization (WHO) website at https://covid19.who.int.

COVID-19 incubation time, which is approximately 5
days [17]. Based on these parameter estimates we obtain
the exponent values predicted by equation (16), which
are in very good agreement with the exponents obtained
by Singer from a direct fit to the n(t) vs t data (Fig. 3).
In conclusion, the power law dynamics of the COVID19 outbreak is a validation of the new power law of infectious disease spreading [9]. This is further demonstrated
by the relationship between the power law exponent and
the time interval between first case and lockdown. Furthermore, it can be shown that the power law growth
persists even if there are degree correlations [18] or multiple types of spreaders [19]. Again this study also underscores the crucial importance of early lockdown timing in
the control of an infectious disease in a population with
superspreaders.
These results are relevant for the management of coronovirus outbreaks or any other outbreak with superspreaders. First, the common assumption of exponential growth/decay needs to be revised. Specially when it
comes to estimate the basic reproductive number from
the plot of new infections as a function of time. Second, the theory explains why the power law exponent is
variable across countries. The value of the power law
exponent contains information about the number of generations the outbreak went through.
