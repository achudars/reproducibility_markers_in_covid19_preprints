Abstract
Objective: To verify the impact and findings of the COVID-19 patients' group that underwent brain
scans in comparison to the group which only chest CT was performed.
Method: 876 suspected COVID-19 patients and a subsample of 232 cases with confirmed COVID19 who underwent brain CT/MRI scan (n=35) or only chest CT (n=197) in two radiology
departments, were evaluated.
Results: 5.59% of all suspected COVID-19 patients found had brain scans and 98.74% chest
CT. There was a statistically significant difference with associations regarding the COVID-19 brain
scan group for: admission to ICU, greater severity of lung injuries, the use of mechanical ventilator,
seizure, sepsis, and stroke and statistical tendency for chronic renal failure and systemic arterial
hypertension. 40.0% of COVID-19 patients from the brain scan group were abnormal on brain CT
and/or brain MRI. 22.9% cases with any kind of bleeding or microbleeding, 8.6% with restricted
diffusion lesions. One ischemic stroke case was associated with irregularity at M1 segment of the
right middle cerebral artery. There was a case of left facial nerve palsy with enhancement of left
geniculate ganglia. An analyse of the olfactory bulbs was possible in 12 brain MRIs and 100% had
enhancement and/or microbleeding. There was no statistical difference regarding death (9.1%
versus 5.2%).
In conclusion: the COVID-19 patients group on which brain CT and/or MRI needed to be
performed was statically associated with the more severe COVID-19 disease, an indication to
ICU, a more severe form of lung disease, use of mechanical ventilator, seizure, sepsis and stroke.
Less than half of patients had abnormal brain imaging scans with all of them showing vascular
brain injury lesion, being more frequently microbleeding or bleeding, followed by restricted
diffusion lesions. All the olfactory bulbs evaluated showed injury by vascular phenomenon,
probably methahemoglobine by microbleeding or microthrombus and/or abnormal enhancement

nervous systems were reported in patients with COVID-19, such as vessel wall enhancement and/or
focal cerebral arteriopathy;1 acute ischemic infarct;1, 2 hemorrhage;2, 3 acute hemorrhagic
necrotizing encephalopathy;4 cerebral venous thrombosis;5, 6 diffuse leukoencephalopathy7 with

restricted diffusion lesion;11 edema12, 13 and enhancement and microbleeds of olfactory bulbs;14 as
well as bilateral facial palsy and enhancement of facial nerves15.
Based on the principle that patients with neurological complaints, and possible intracranial
lesions as attributable causes, are evaluated with brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or
computed tomography (CT) , we decided to assess two groups of patients comparatively: A group
of patients with COVID-19 assessed by neuroimaging as compared to a group of COVID-19
patients who underwent only chest CT, without any image evaluation of the brain.
Thus, the purpose of this study was to verify the frequency, the clinical profile and the
radiology findings of the COVID-19 patients “group that underwent brain imaging scans” in
comparison to the “group of patients on which only chest CT was performed” in two radiology
departments.
Method
The Institutional Review Board approved this retrospective study of the Ethics Committee.
Informed consent was waived.
A survey of the cases was carried out to identify the patients with confirmed COVID-19
who underwent chest CT scan and/or brain MRI/CT in two radiology departments.
876 clinical-suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases were collected , being: (a) 261
patients from Radiology Department “A”, from March 28, 2020 to September 3, 2020, (11 patients
underwent brain MRI and/or CT and 255 patients chest CT); and (b) 615 patients from Radiology
Department “B”, from April 1, 2020 to May 24, 2020, (38 patients underwent brain MRI and/or CT
and 610 patients underwent chest CT).

We used a convenience subsample of 232 cases that we were able to collect the clinical data
from medical records in time to analyze and write this study which: (a) had laboratory confirmation of

COVID-19, (b) excluded patients under 18 year old and with co-infection of another viral infection.
The Institution's radiologists initially analyzed all chest and brain scans. Atypical
pneumonia CT patterns for COVID-19 were excluded. The lung opacities qualitative scoring of
COVID-19 (virus pneumonia) patterns was performed independently by the Institution´s
radiologists: (a) less than 25%, (b) between 25% and 50% or (c) equal to or more than 50%. Our
study considered only the evaluation of the Institution´s radiologists of chest CT reports.
Subsequently, all images of brain CT and MRI were reviewed independently by two
radiologists and neuroradiologists who were certified by the Ministry of Education and Culture with
30 and 18 years of experience, respectively. In cases where there was disagreement, results were
resolved by consensus.
The clinical variables data, retrospectively collected from the medical records, were: a) sex;
b) age; c) the percentual extent of pulmonary lesions found in the chest CT; laboratory SARS-CoV2
infection confirmation; abnormalities found in brain CT or MRI, d) presence of cough, headache,
anosmia, ageusia, dyspnoea, systemic arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, renal failure, use
of mechanical ventilation, and a neurological complaint. The origins of patients were also assessed,
whether they were admitted to the Emergency Room, hospitalized or admitted to the ICU. It was
also assessed whether a patient had progressed to death before the assessment date.
An analise of the olfactory bulbs was possible in 12 brain MRIs because 12 had at least a
sequence of coronal thin slices pre- and/or post-contrast fat supressed T1WI and 1 patient had preand post-contrast 3D SPGR T1WI and also 3D FLAIR.
The intensity of olfactory bulbs was defined as normal when the bulbs have the same cortex
intensity, as typically seen in healthy controls. Abnormal olfactory bulb intensity is when the bulbs
are more hyperintense than the cortex on T1WI and STIR.

After gadolinium injection on T1WI, enhancement of the olfactory bulbs is defined when
they become more hyperintense in comparison with their intensity on pre-gadolinium
T1WI. However, when there is only the post-gadolinium T1WI and the bulb is more hyperintense
than the normal cortex, this represents olfactory bulb intensity abnormality and maybe an
enhancement or microbleeding (methaemoglobin), as interpreted in the present study.
Microbleeding (methaemoglobin) in the olfactory bulb is considered when there is hyperintense
olfactory bulb, compared with the normal cortex or the normal contralateral bulb, on pregadolinium fat supression TIWI.

Statistical Analysis

Softwares SPSS 13.0 (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) for Windows and Excel
2010 were used; all tests were applied with 95% confidence.

The results are presented in table form with their respective absolute and relative
frequencies. The numerical variables are represented by measures of central tendency and measures
of dispersion.

To verify the existence of an association: Chi-square Test and Fisher's Exact Test for
categorical variables were applied.

Results

Only 49/876 (5.59%) of all suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients had brain scans
performed in both radiology departments for investigation of COVID-19 neurological
complications.
The chest CT was much more requested for pulmonary complications in COVID-19 patients
being 865/876 (98,74%) in both radiology departments.

In the subsample of 232 confirmed COVID-19 patients, 35 had undergone brain scans.
Thirty of these 35 had chest CT performed as well. It was not taken into account whether a patient
repeated the brain CT and/or MRI or the chest CT.
Thus on Table 1, the profile of the group of all the 35 confirmed COVID-19 patients that
underwent brain imaging scans was compared to the convenience control group of 197 cases who
only underwent chest CT (without brain scans). There were associations regarding the COVID-19
group which underwent brain imaging scans for origin within the hospital (more frequent in ICU
patients), greater severity of lung injuries, the use of mechanic ventilators, complaints of dyspnea
(less frequent), seizures, sepsis and ischemic stroke. There was statistical tendency for chronic
kidney failure.
No statistical differences were found between the two groups concerning fever, cough,
headache, anosmia, ageusia, gastric symptoms, obesity, systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes
mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and death.
Table 2 shows the individual data of demografic, clinical and radiological caracteristics of
the 35 adult patients with COVID-19 on whom brain MRI and/or CT scans were performed because
of clinical neurological complication. Among those 35 patients, 21 cases (60.0%) were normal and
14 (40.0%) were abnormal on brain CT and/or brain MRI (Figures 1-7), being:
-

8/35 (22.9%) cases with any kind of bleeding or microbleeding (Figure 1 K-M and P; Figure
2 E, F and G; Figure 4 A, D and G and Figure 6),

-

3/35 (8.6%) with restricted diffusion lesions, being; one case with restricted DWI small
areas (2.9%) had also associated multiple small areas of microbleeding (Figure 1 , H, I);
another case (2.9%) had restricted diffusion lesion only in the splenium of the corpus
callosun without any microbleeding in the brain (Figure 3 A-E) and with olfactory bulbs
injury (Figure 3 F) ; and one further case (2.9%) of ischemic stroke with 4 months of
evolution at the right middle cerebral artery territory (Figura 4 A and B, arrows) with
irregularity at the right middle cerebral artery (Figures 4I, 4J, arrows), but with remaining

small areas of restricted diffusion (Figure 4 E and F, small arrows), and olfactory bulb injury
(Figure 4 K and L, arrows);
-

2/35 (5.7%) with previous old stroke lesion;

-

There was a case (2.9%) of left facial nerve palsy with enhacement of geniculate ganglia
(Figure 5A and B) and right olfactory bulb/tract injury with enhancement (Figure 5 C and
D).
All 12 brain MRIs (100%) which were possible to evaluate the olfactory bulbs (Table 2)

had injury in the olfactory bulbs suggestive of enhancement and/or methahemoglobine (Figure 3 F;
Figure 4 K, L, Figure 5 C, D and Figure 7 B-D). Six of them (50%) had normal brain MRI and the
other six (50%) showed brain MRI abnormalities as well (Table 2).

Discussion

This study shows the impact which only a small percentage of the patients with COVID-19
attended in two private radiologic institutions underwent brain CT or MRI (5.59%), although almost
all patients (98,74%) underwent chest CT. This may indicate that patients with COVID-19 rarely
have severe neurological complications that require investigation by brain scans, with pulmonary
complications being much more frequent and, therefore, chest CT scans are much more performed.
The profile of COVID-19 patients group which needed to undergo brain CT and/or MRI
were associated with: more severe disease and admission to ICU, severe lung disease, use of
mechanical ventilator, seizure, sepsis and stroke. They had also a statistical tendency for association
with chronic renal failure and systemic arterial hypertension.
Despite the COVID-19 patients group which needed to undergo brain CT and/or MRI have
severe lung disease and use mechanical ventilator, the complaint of dyspnea was statisticaly less

frequent. However, this should be evaluated with caution because dyspnea complaint information
was retrieved retrospectively from the medical record, and there may be underreporting.
When anosmia was being analysed in our study, we did not find statistical differences when
comparing the radiological group with brain scans to the radiological group with chest CT (without
brain scans). This could be explained because anosmia is a frequent symptom in all COVID-19
patients. Another explanation maybe because a bias arose from this information which was
presented as “yes or no” only in 33.2% of the medical records.
Regarding brain imaging findings (without considering olfactory bulbs injury) 40% of the
patients had abnormal imaging scans and all of them had vascular brain lesions. Brain haemorrhage
lesions (some kind of bleeding or microbleeding) were a more frequent finding in our study and all
the patients were 60+ years old. The second finding was the presence of lesions showing restricted
diffusion.
As in previous studies, the most frequent neuroimaging finding was single or multiple T2*
punctiform hypointense lesions (microbleeding)8, 16-19 (frequently associated with white matter
lesions on T28, 19which sometimes have restricted diffusion8 ) located mainly at the subcortical
white matter junction and sometimes at the splenium of the corpus callosum16-19.
Several mechanisms for the SARS-CoV-2-related neurological complications are being
considered: (a) a direct viral invasion of the haematogenic or retrograde axonal route by olfactory
mucosa to olfactory bulbs and to the brain which can lead to intracellular virus accumulation in
endothelial cells (endothelitis with thrombotic microangiopathy16 20), neurons,21 glial cells,
macrophages and etc; (b), an indirect process resulting from hypercoagulability-related 22; (c) an
exaggerated cytokine/19immune-mediated response to viral infection causing damage to blood
vessel walls or cells in the brain23 with (d) ischemia and hypoxic,16 23 and (e) treatment
complications 24or (f) a combination of them16.
We had one case in our study of splenium of corpus callosum restricted diffusion lesion
without microbleeding. This finding was also described in previous studies 25, 26, probably

secondary to a cytotoxic lesion27 due to a cytokine storm26 , but but the possibility of acute
ischemic injury cannot be ruled out.
The Wuhan study found that severe nervous system disease manifestations were more
common in severe infections according to the American Thoracic Society guidelines for
community-acquired pneumonia compared with nonsevere infections (45.5% vs 30.2%).28 Our
study found almost the same information in relation to greater pulmonary extension of injury on
chest CT which was significantly associated with a radiological group of patients on whom brain
scans had been performed because neurological complication.
The primary role of the positive renine angiotensine system is to increase sympathetic
nervous system tension, cause vasoconstriction, increase blood pressure, and promote inflammation,
fibrosis, and myocardial hypertrophy.33 As an organ protector, the whole negative regulatory axis
mediated by angiotensine couvert enzyme 2 (ACE2) can antagonize these effects.33 However, the
ACE2 is known to be a cell receptor for SARS-CoV 33 and now confirmed for SARS-Cov2.34

A study demonstrates that the ACE2 expression is increased in ischemic brains and vessels
of patients with diabetes melitus and exposed to smoking, making them vulnerable to COVID-19
infection.35 However, in our study 25% of the patients had diabetes melitus and we did not find
any differences between the radiological groups studied. With statistical tendency, systemic arterial
hypertension was more frequent in the group submitted to neuroimaging investigation (52.9% vs
22.0%; p = 0.062) maybe for an increased ACE2 expression in this group. It is possible that we did
not find statistical differences between both radiological groups (group with brain scans and group
with only chest CT) in relations to these variables (diabetes melitus and systemic arterial
hypertension) because we are studying patients who needed imaging investigation and for that
reason both groups had more severe clinical picture and maybe increased ACE2 expression.

It is worth noting that in COVID-19 the “flu-like syndrome” and mild neurological
symptoms36 (e.g. headache, anosmia and ageusia) are very common,37 but that these symptoms are

usually transient, disappearing in around half of the cases within 15 days 38,39 and, for this reason,
brain imaging (CT or MRI) is not regularly indicated for diagnostic clarification.
COVID-19 patients have presented symptoms of smell dysfunction that is frequently
reported in various studies, from 5.1% to 88% of patient38,39. However, anosmia in the majority of
studies is higher than the central nervous system symptoms which is reported to be around 25%.28
However, the occurrence of anosmia or hyposmia is around 16% for other viruses, as for
exemple with influenza37 and lower than in COVID-19. So, clinical differences can help the
clinicians during the co-circulation of influenza and SARS-CoV-2.37 Because of this, anosmia is
now considered as a criterion for testing COVID-19.
We found only 12 patients with COVID-19 with brain MRI where it was possible to
interpret the olfactory bulbs, being: 11 with thin coronal sections pre- and/or post-contrast fat
suppression T1 WI in the anterior fossa of the cranium and 1 with pre- and post-contrast SPGR
T1WI and FLAIR. All these patients (12/12) had anormalities in olfactory bulbs suggesting
microvascular phenomenon, such as microbleeding and/or enhancement by blood-brain barrier
breakdown. Of those who had an olfactory bulb injury, 33.33% reported anosmia, 8.33% denied
anosmia and in the remaining 58.33% there was no note in the hospital’s Records/Radiology
Department about this complaint.
Despite these 12 cases having been investigated for a major neurological complication,
only 6 (50%) had other brain lesions and 6 (50%) had normal brain imaging for their age, but all of
them had olfactory bulb injury. This finding can be the MRI documentation of olfactory bulbs
injury related to the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 from the olfactory mucosa through the cribriform
plate into the skull.14
The natural history of SARS-CoV-2-induced anosmia has not yet been fully understood.
Perhaps if the damage to the olfactory epithelium was more related to an inflammatory process or
indirect damage to the neural cells, it would probably explain the cases of evolution with complete

recovery. However, there are patients who evolve partial late recovery or even have not yet
recovered.
So, our study also suggests and supports the hypothesis that vascular phenomenon could be
the main mechanism of COVID-19 in the brain and in the olfactory bulbs injuries14, 40 and may also
be the main mechanism of anosmia.
Another interesting finding is that despite mortality not being statistically different when
comparing the two groups, it was slightly higher among patients investigated by brain neuroimaging
(9.1% vs 5.2%).
The limitation of our study is that it is a retrospective study. The variables analyzed were not
always noted in the medical records of all patients. Patients underwent brain scans because of major
neurological complications and not for anosmia. For this reason, the MRI of most patients did not
have an adequate sequence to evaluate the olfactory bulbs. Despite the anterior fossa region being
analyzed with coronal fat suppression T1WI can have susceptibility artifacts between the interface
with the air, these artifacts are generally well recognized by radiologists and did not hinder the
investigation and the analysis.40 However, future anatomopathological studies are necessary to
confirm our finding.
In conclusion, in COVID-19 patients, the impact of major neurological complication to
indicate brain scans was much less frequent than respiratory complication to need chest CT. The
profile of COVID-19 patients group which needed to undergo brain scans were statistically
associated with the more severe COVID-19 disease, located at ICU, a more severe form of lung
disease, use of of mechanical ventilator, complaints of dyspnea (less frequent), seizure, stroke and
sepsis. There was a statistical tendency to chronic renal failure and systemic arterial hypertension.
Regarding brain imaging findings, less than half of patients had abnormal imaging scans with all of
them showing vascular brain injury lesion, being more frequently microbleeding or bleeding,
followed by restricted diffusion lesions. All the olfactory bulbs evaluated showed injury by vascular
phenomenon, probably methahemoglobine by microbleeding or microthrombus and/or abnormal

Legends of Figures:
Figure 1- Case 31: A male in his 60´s year-old with confirmed COVID19 patient admitted to the ICU with fever, cough, dyspnea which needed a mechanical ventilator;
had sepsis, stroke and in coma and with a history of diabetes
mellitus, systemic arterial hypertension and chronic renal failure. On admission, his chest CT
showed on 3D reconstruction posterior view (arrows, A) and lateral view (arrow, C), and on lung
window axial CT slices (arrows, E) shows areas of alveoellar consolidation and ground glass which
occupy more than 50% of the area of the lungs. Three days later (arrows, B), there was fast
progression with severe increase of the lung disease (arrows, B, D, F). The brain MRI shows some
hyperintense small areas of on FLAIR and in DWI which are hypointense on ADC-Map (restricted
diffusion lesions) in the right semioval center and at left superior frontal gyrus. Small areas
of microbledding are also observed, being hyperintense on T1WI (J, arrows) and hypointense on
T2* (K, arrows) localized on the left superior frontal gyrus and medial part of left precentral gyrus.
There is also a large oval hematoma located at the anterior and superior vermis of the cerebellum
with predominant component of methemoglobin inside, being hyperintense on sagittal T1 (L,
arrow) and on coronal T2WI (M, arrow) with peripheric hypointense ring of hemosiderin. Some
small lesions which represents microbleeding (methemoglobin)are also located on the splenium of
the corpus callosum hyperintense on FLAIR (N, arrow) and sagittal T1WI (L) and in DWI (O,
arrow) hypointense on T2* (P, arrow). The CT (Q-U) without contrast made one month later

showed that the lesions described above on previous MRI are hypointense and that a new sequel in
the right parietal lobe (S and T, arrow) had appeared.

Figure 2- Case 30: A female in her 70´s presented fever, cough, dyspnea, needed a mechanical
ventilator, had sepsis which resulted in death. Her brain MRI shows multiple and confluent
areas of diffuse hyperintensity on FLAIR (A-C, arrows) and liquid in the mastoid cells (A, short
head of arrows). A small linear hyperintense subcortical on sagittal T1 (D, arrow) which
represents methemoglobin is observed. There are multiple small dots of micro bleeds at the
cerebellum and middle cerebellar peduncle (E, arrows), intern capsule (F, long arrows), splenium of
corpus callosum (F, head of arrow) and subcortical white matter (F and G, arrows) of the brain. The
3D chest CT reconstruction shows that there is more than 50% of opacification in both lungs (H).

Figure 3 – Case 18: Male in his 40´s arrived at the hospital with
fever, cough, anosmia, headache and sensory alteration in left dimidium, paresthesia in face and fog
in visual field. On MRI, there is a small round lesion located on the splenium of the
corpus callosun which could represent a cytotoxic lesion due to a cytokine storm and differential
diagnosis is with small acute infartc. It is hypointense on T1 (A, arrow) with restricted diffusion,
being hyperintense on DWI (B, arrow) and hypointense on ADC-Map (C, arrow). This lesion is also
hyperintense on FLAIR (D, arrow) and T2* (E, arrow) without microbleeding.
The olfactory bulbs are hyperintense on coronal fat suppressed T1WI post contrast (F, arrows) 14
in comparison with the gray matter of frontal lobes which can represent enhancement, but we can n
ot exclude microbleeding14.
Figure 4- Case 34: A female in her 30´s contracted and recovered from COVID-19
4 months ago and during the acute phase of disease had two strokes and seizures. Her MRI shows a
predominantly chronic ischemic stroke, compatible with the patient's history, located in the cortical
and subcortical region of the right middle cerebral artery territory, but specifically in the topography
of the right M8 and M10 (A-F). In the right M10, the lesion is a small hyperintense line on T1 (A,
long arrow); enhances with contrast (B, long arrow); is hyperintense on T2 and T2*(C and D, long,
arrow) and facilitates diffusion, being hyperintense in DWI (E, long arrow) and hyperintense on
ADC-Map (E, long arrow), representing T2 shine through effect. Adjacent to this M10 chronic
infarct and at M8 lesion, the white matter is hypointense (A, short arrows), with superficial
enhanced line on post-contrast T1WI (B, short arrows), and has restricted DWI (E, F, short
arrows) being hyperintense on DWI (E, short arrows), and hypointense on ADC-map (F, short
arrows), looking like a more recent ischemic stroke, perhaps still representing cytotoxic edema.
There are other small areas of bleeding with magnetic susceptibility in T2 * (D, arrow head) located
in the right cingulate gyrus and posteriorly and left hypothalamus (G, arrow) which is reduced in
volume on coronal T2WI (H, arrow). In magnetic angioMRI, parietal irregularity and narrowing in
the right M1 is observed (I and J, arrow) and also in the origin of right anterior artery. Small dot of
hyperintensity in the right olfactory bulb (K, arrow) observed on pre contrast fat suppressed T1WI
which seems have increased signal with contrast (L, arrow) representing probably
methahemoglobine and enhancement.

Figure 5- Case 32: A male in his 40´s with COVID- 19 developed left peripheric facial
palsy around 45 days after the infection. The MRI shows both hypointense geniculate
ganglions on axial fat suppressed T1 WI (A, arrows), but the left geniculate ganglion has abnormal
stronger enhancement on axial post contrast (B, arrow) fat suppressed T1 WI. The
coronal fat suppressed T1 WI shows olfactory bulbs with normal hypointense signal,
similar to the gray matter (C, arrows), but the post contrast coronal fat suppressed T1WI
shows abnormal enhancement in the right olfactory bulb (D, arrow).
Figure 6- Case 27: Female with COVID 19 in her 60´s has two cortical and cortical and
subcortical hematomas on transition between left posterior temporal lobe and occipital lobe (long
arrow A-D) and with methemoglobin inside on T1WI (A, long arrow) , FLAIR (B, long arrow),
DWI (C, long arrow) and T2* (D, long arrow) with hemosiderin on the periphery being
hypointense ring. There is vasogenic edema near the left temporal hematoma being hyperintense on
FLAIR (B, short arrow). There is also microbleeding in pale globes (A and D, short
arrows). Another cortical hematoma in the right parietal lobe (E-H, long arrow, with the same
characteristics described above with methemoglobin inside and hemosiderin in the periphery. There
are small dots of subcortical microbleeding in the left frontal and parietal lobes (H, short arrows).
Two months later there was regression on MRI (I-P) of both hematomas in size, but deposition of
hemosiderin remained being hypointense on all sequences [T1, I and M; FLAIR, J; DWI, K and O
(arrow); T2, N, (arrow); and T2*, L and P (arrows) and in the lentiform nuclei (L, small arrows).

Figure 7 40 – The figure 6 continuation of case 27: Her Chest CT (A) shows more than 50% of
typical lung opacity of COVID 19 pulmonary injury, bilaterally (arrows). The MRI shows
hyperintense lesion on 3D FLAIR (B, arrow)40 and also on pre (C, arrow) 40 and post contrast SPGR
T1 WI (D, arrow) 40. This is suggestive of component of probably methemoglobin in this left
olfactory bulb lesion which seems be little bigger and asymmetric compared with the apparently
normal right olfactory bulb. 40 This asymmetry in size is better seen on FLAIR (B). 40 There is also a
small round hyperintense lesion in the subcortical white matter in the left frontal lobe which is
hypointense on T1WI (C, short arrow) and does not enhances on post-contrast T1WI (D, short
arrow) being non specific40. The MRI done 3 months later shows on fat suppression T1 WI (E) that
there is reduction on hyperintensity of left olfactory bulb lesion.
