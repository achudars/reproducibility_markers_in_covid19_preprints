ABSTRACT

Background and Objectives: COVID-19 convalescent plasma is an experimental
treatment against SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of different
pathogen reduction methods on the levels and virus neutralizing activity of the specific
antibodies against SARS-CoV2 in convalescent plasma.
Materials and Methods: A total of 140 plasma doses collected by plasmapheresis from
COVID-19 convalescent donors were subjected to pathogen reduction by three
methods: methylene blue (M)/visible light, riboflavin (R)/UVB, and amotosalen (A)/UVA.
To conduct a paired comparison, individual plasma doses were divided into 2 samples
that were subjected to one of these methods. The titres of SARS-CoV2 neutralizing
antibodies (NtAbs) and levels of specific immunoglobulins to RBD, S- and N- proteins of
SARS-CoV-2 were measured before and after pathogen reduction.
Results: The methods reduced NtAbs titres differently: among units with the initial titre
80 or above, 81% of units remained unchanged and 19% decreased by one step after
methylene blue; 60% were unchanged and 40% decreased by one step after
amotosalen; after riboflavin 43% were unchanged and 50% (7% respectively) had a onestep (two-step respectively) decrease. Paired two-sample comparisons (M vs A, M vs R
and A vs R) revealed that the largest statistically significant decrease in quantity and
activity of the specific antibodies resulted from the riboflavin treatment.
Conclusion: Pathogen reduction with methylene blue or with amotosalen provides the
greater likelihood of preserving the immunological properties of the COVID-19
convalescent plasma compared to riboflavin.

Keywords: COVID-19 convalescent plasma, NtAbs, pathogen reduction, amotosalen,

Introduction
The new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues
its march around the world, causing a global crisis as the number of new cases and
deaths continues to rise. The treatment is supportive care mostly aimed at relieving
symptoms. Candidate vaccines are still going through different stages of clinical trials,
and different classes of drugs are being tested to inhibit virus replication and reduce
inflammation [1, 2, 3].
Passive immunotherapy with polyclonal antibodies from the blood plasma of
convalescents was tested earlier in the outbreaks of SARS-CoV, influenza and other
dangerous infections of the twentieth century [4, 5, 6]. Experts from different countries
came to consider the possibility of using COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) for
therapeutic purposes in patients with COVID-19 [7, 8, 9]. In many countries, national
campaigns have been launched to collect CCP. The use of CCP is still exploratory at
this time as proof of efficacy has not been demonstrated through RCT even if many
RCTs on CCP are ongoing worldwide.
Various mechanisms have been suggested as responsible for the therapeutic effect of
CCP such as virus neutralization and immunomodulation [10]. Virus neutralizing
antibodies (NAbs) of IgG, IgM and IgA classes bind to different parts of glycoprotein S,
including the region of the receptor-binding domain (RBD), spatially blocking its
interaction with the membrane protein ACE2 of host cells, which limits the penetration of
the virus into the cell, thereby limiting viral replication [11, 12, 13]. Along with antibodies
against different fragments of S-protein antibodies against nucleocapsid (N-protein) are
detected in the course of COVID-19 infection. These antibodies are used as additional
diagnostic markers, but do not correlate with virus neutralizing activity in virto [14].

Every plasma transfusion is associated, however, with risks of virus transferral such as
HIV, HBV, HCV, etc. [15]. Donor studies of Cappy et al [16] showed that viremia was
extremely rare in asymptomatic blood donors, viral RNA levels were very low when
detected, and the corresponding plasma was not infectious in cell culture. At the
moment, there are no scientific publications reporting on the transmission of SARS-CoV2 through the transfusion of blood components [17]. The Working Party on Global Blood
Safety of the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT) recommended the use of
pathogen reduction (PR) of convalescent plasma to minimize the residual risk of bloodborne infections and to address the problem of possible superinfection with the SARSCoV-2 virus [8].
Until recently, there was surprisingly very little information on the effect of PR treatment
of plasma on the functional properties of immunoglobulins. This issue has been raised
previously for Ebola convalescent plasma regarding possible impact of PR by Intercept
technology on the neutralizing activity of EBOV IgG, potentially affecting clinical
outcomes [18, 19]. Tonn et al [20] found that PR did not impair the stability and
neutralizing capacity of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in 5 CCP units treated with
psoralen/UVA (Intercept).
To date, there is no sufficient data on how pathogen reduction affects the immunological
properties of CCP and what PR technologies are preferable to use to maintain its quality
and effectiveness.
The objective of this study is to assess the effect of various methods for pathogen
reduction on the levels and virus neutralizing activity of the specific antibodies against
SARS-CoV2 in CCP.

Materials and methods
The COVID-19 convalescent plasma procurement program in Russia was launched on
April 2, 2020 at the Department of Transfusion Medicine of the Sklifosovsky Research
Institute of Emergency Medicine, Moscow. At present, this program involves many
hospitals in several regions and has more than 6,500 donations and about 4,500

transfusions of CCP in Moscow alone. According to the adopted regulations, donors of
convalescent plasma were recruited among the individuals with prior diagnosis of
COVID-19 infection documented by a positive RT-PCR-test who received treatment
either in a hospital setting or on an outpatient basis. Donors fulfilled the standard blood
donor selection criteria. Plasma was collected at least 2 weeks after the complete
disappearance of clinical symptoms.
Ethical approval was granted for this study by the Independent Moscow City Research
Ethical Committee in accordance with national regulations. Informed consent was
obtained in writing from all donors prior to donation.
Plasmapheresis procedures were performed using Auto-C (Fresenius Kabi), Aurora
(Fresenius Kabi) and PCS2 (Haemonetics) machines. Plasmapheresis was carried out
in accordance with standard protocols collecting an amount of 650 ml plasma. During
collection, the same anticoagulant (ACD-A) was added in a ratio of 1:12 in all machines.
Pathogen reduction procedures were carried out immediately after the end of
plasmapheresis. For comparison, three systems for PR were selected:
1. Intercept (Cerus): 15 mL of 6 mmol/L amotosalen hydrochloride solution were
mixed with plasma to a final concentration 150 µmol/L and exposed to UVA light
(3 J/cm2), thereafter residual amotosalen and free photoproducts were adsorbed
in a compound adsorption device (CAD).
2. Mirasol (Therumo, BCT): 35 mL of 500 µmol/L riboflavin solution was mixed with
200±5 mL plasma and exposed to UVB light (6.24 J/mL).
3. Maco-Tronic (MacoPharma): plasma was transferred to the THERAFLEX
MB‐Plasma illumination bag, passing through a chamber containing the
anhydrous MB pill, resulting in a minimum MB concentration of at least 0.8 µmol/L
in 315 mL of plasma, subsequent illumination (120 J/cm2) and removal of MB
using the Blueflex MB removal filter.
All three PR technologies were validated at our blood bank for routine use, prior to
pathogen reduction of CCP for this study. All plasma units were treated under the
specific PR manufacturer’s instructions and met the required specifications for each

pathogen reduction technology. The temperature of plasma units during illumination
were maintained at ≤22C.
After PR plasma was frozen at -40C and became available for clinical use after
receiving negative results of all serology/virology tests for transfusion-transmitted
diseases.
The study included 140 doses of plasma obtained by plasmapheresis from 140 COVID19 convalescent donors. From each plasma unit, samples were collected before and
after pathogen reduction for the determination of the titres of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing
antibodies (NtAbs), as well as quantitative determination of specific IgG to the receptorbinding domain (RBD) of the glycoprotein S of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and specific IgM
and IgG to S- and N- proteins of this virus.
To conduct a paired two-sample comparison in order to assess the effect of each of
these methods on the immunological parameters of CCP, the plasma dose from each
donor was divided into 2 parts, and each part was then simultaneously subjected to a
pathogen reduction procedure by one of the two methods according to the following
scheme:
•

pair 1: methylene blue (M) vs. riboflavin - 48 pairs;

•

pair 2: amotosalen (A) vs. riboflavin (R) - 36 pairs;

•

pair 3: methylene blue (M) vs. amotosalen (A) - 56 pairs;

Since there were 140 samples before treatments, in total 420 (=48*2+36*2+56*2+140)
samples were analysed. Virus neutralization assay and ELISA were performed at a day
of biomaterial collection at the Gamaleya National Research Center of Epidemiology and
Microbiology, Moscow. Samples for chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) were frozen
immediately after the collection in Eppendorf tubes in aliquots of 200 µL in -35C and
thawed and analysed later all at the same time.
NtAb titer was determined by microneutralization test [21]. Vero E6 were cultured
in DMEM - Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (Gibco) containing 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 3,7 g/l sodium bicarbonate (PanEco), 1 mM glutamine

(PanEco), 100 µg/ml streptomycin (PanEco), 100 IU/ml penicillin (PanEco) in 5% CO2
humidified incubator at 37oC.
The SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19/Russia/Moscow_PMVL-1/2020) virus was obtained
from the State Virus Collection of Gamaleya NRCEM. The infectious virus titre was
determined on Vero E6 cells using a 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay.
Serial 10-fold dilutions of the virus stock were prepared in DMEM with 2% heatinactivated FBS and in volume of 100 µl were added to Vero E6 cells in a 96-well plate
in 8 repeats. The cells were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 96 hours and scored
visually for cytopathic effect. The TCID50 titre was calculated by Reed and Muench
method. Neutralization activity of plasma was determined by microneutralization test
using SARS-CoV-2 virus in a 96-well plate. Plasma samples were inactivated by
incubation at 56оС for 30 min and serial two-fold dilutions in DMEM containing 2% heatinactivated FBS at a range 1:20 – 1:1280 were made. Then 100 TCID50 was added to
each sample. The samples were incubated at 37oC for 1 h in a 5% CO2 incubator. After
incubation samples were added to Vero E6 cells and incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator
at 37oC for 96 h. Neutralization titre was defined as the highest serum/plasma dilution
without cytopathic effect in two of three replicable wells.
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG semi-quantitative ELISA test-system developed in
Gamaleya NRCEM and registered for clinical use in Russian Federation (РЗН
2020/10393 2020-05-18) was used for the determination of the IgG specific to the
receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein S [20].
Briefly, the RBD-pre-coated plates (100 ng per well) were washed 5x with 0.1%
wash solution and then blocked with blocking solution. Plasma samples were diluted
1/200 in blocking solution and added in wells, then plates were incubated at 37°C for 1
h. After washing the plates 5x the peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG detection
antibodies diluted in blocking solution were added and plates were incubated at 37°C for
1 h. After washing 5x the substrate TMB was added and plates were incubated at 2025°С for 15 min, the reaction was stopped with the stop solution. The OD signals were
determined with a spectrophotometer Multiskan FC (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, USA)
at 450 nm.

Sensitivity of the test is 96%, specificity 100% and the limit of detection is 0.2 AU
(OD450nm).

The CL-series SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM assays are a two-step chemiluminescent
immunoassays for detection of IgG and IgM SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in human serum or
plasma, performed on the fully automated Mindray CL 1200i analytical system
(Shenzhen Mindray Bio-Medical Electronics Co., Shenzen, China). Samples react with
paramagnetic microparticles coated with SARS-CoV-2 specific antigens - recombinant
N-Protein and Spike (S) Protein. Alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-human IgG or IgM
monoclonal antibodies are added to the reaction to form a sandwich with microparticles
captured anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Finally, a substrate solution is added, resulting in
a chemiluminescent reaction measured as relative light units by a photomultiplier built
into the system. The amount of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies present in the sample is
proportional to the relative light units (RLUs) generated during the reaction. The SARSCoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies concentration can be determined via a calibration curve,
which is built on an encoded Master Calibration Curve and three level product
calibrators. Cut-off values are: IgG positive>10.0 U/mL and IgM positive >1.0 COI,
Positive Percent Agreement 81.7% and 82.2%, Negative Percent Agreement 91.6%
and 94.9%for IgM and IgG respectively, according to the manufacturer’s specifications.

Since the data for NtAbs are presented in the format 10 multiplied by an integer power of
two (i.e., 20, 40, 80, 160 etc.) we log-2-transformed the data: y=log2(x/10), where x is
the reported value of NtAbs

To identify the methods of pathogen reduction which have the least negative effect on
NtAbs levels, we applied the two-sample paired T-tests (M vs A, M vs R, and A vs R) to
the difference in reduction in titres of NtAbs, anti-RBD IgG, and anti-S + N IgG and IgM
titres respectively, after pathogen reduction by different methods. The p-values < 0.05
were considered to be significant. No corrections were made for multi-significance.
Confidence intervals were obtained using the standard methods for estimation of
proportions. The software used for the analysis was MapleTM.

Results
The assessment of the impact of various methods of pathogen reduction on the titres of
SARS-CoV2 neutralizing antibodies (NtAbs) showed a statistically significant decrease
in antibody titres after all pathogen reduction processes (Figure 1, Table 1).
If all plasma units, regardless of the initial titre were included in the analysis, it was
shown that in 88% (n=104; confidence interval 81% - 94%) of units NtAbs titres did not
decrease after pathogen reduction with methylene blue whereas a one-step titre
reduction was observed in remaining 12%. In 70% (n=88; 95% confidence interval 61% 80%) of units treated with amotosalen the NtAbs titre did not change, and in 30% it
decreased by 1 step. Pathogen reduction with riboflavin left NtAbs titres unchanged in
61% (n=83; confidence interval 51% - 72%) of the units, in 35% decreased by one step
and in 4% by two steps.
To compare the impact of different methods of pathogen reduction, we used the data
collected on paired data: the plasma units from the same donor were treated using e.g.
method A and M, and then the resulting NtAbs were noted for both methods. We had
three different datasets: one compared A vs. R, another dataset M vs. R and the third M
vs. A. The results are the following: M is better than R (p-value=0.00002, n=48), A is
better than R (p-value=0.0002, n=36), M is better than A (p-value=0.0012, n=56).
When only units with the initial NtAbs titre 80 or above were chosen (the level
considered to be suitable for therapeutic purposes) the distribution was similar: after
treatment with methylene blue, 81% of plasma samples had unchanged NtAbs titres
(n=53; confidence interval 71% - 92%), while in the remaining 19% of samples the titres
decreased by 1 step. Pathogen reduction with amotosalen gave worse results: 60% of
samples had the same NtAbs after the reduction (n=55; confidence interval 47% - 73%),
while in the remaining 40% samples the titres decreased by 1 step. Finally, after
treatment with riboflavin, only 43% of the samples preserved the level of NtAbs titres
(n=30; confidence interval 26% - 61%), whereas a one-step decrease was observed in
50% samples, and a two-step decrease in 7% of samples.

The decrease in anti-RBD IgG in paired comparison with baseline values was most
pronounced after pathogen reduction with riboflavin followed by methylene blue whereas
after amotosalen there was no significant difference (Table 1).
Plasma pathogen inactivation with methylene blue did not lead to a significant decrease
in anti-S + N IgG and IgM, whereas the use of amotosalen significantly reduced only the
level of anti-S + N IgG (Table 1). In the study of 83 pairs of samples before and after
pathogen reduction with riboflavin, the differences were significant in the anti-S + N
levels of both IgG and IgM (Table 1).
Paired two-sample comparisons (M vs A, M vs R and A vs R) revealed the most
prominent and statistically significant decline in titres of NtAbs, anti-S + N IgG and IgM
(with the exception of anti-RBD IgG titres) resulted from pathogen reduction by riboflavin
compared with two other PR technologies (Table 2).
As the riboflavin is not removed after the illumination phase in the Mirasol technique, the
residual amount of riboflavin or its by-products may possibly affect the in vitro
assessment of the NtAbs. To rule out this possibility we have conducted a series of tests
showing that the viability of the cells used to assess the neutralization was not affected
by riboflavin itself nor its derivatives. We also measured NtAbs titres in several plasma
samples taken after the addition of riboflavin but before the illumination - the titres did
not differ from those in samples before PR. Thus, it seems that the reducing effect of PR
with riboflavin on the level and activity of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 requires both
photosensitizing agent and UVB illumination as this PR technology requires.
Discussion
The key safety issue of using convalescent plasma is played by the choice of a PR
technology that minimizes the residual transfusion risk of transmissible viruses in the
final product, while maintaining a high titre of antibodies to the SARS-Cov-2 virus. A
number of different PR technologies are available today [22]. Ultraviolet (UV) A [23, 24]
and UVB radiation [25], in combination with amotosalen and riboflavin, respectively,
makes it possible to inactivate nucleic acids of pathogenic organisms. These systems
can reduce the activity of SARS and MERS viruses in plasma or platelet concentrates to

varying degrees. Methylene blue is a phenothiazine compound that, in combination with
visible light, is also capable of inactivating coronaviruses in plasma [26, 27]. The
photoactive agents used in these methods have different chemical structures and are
activated at different wavelengths of radiation (visible light with the peak wavelength of
590 nm, UVA from 400 nm - 315 nm and UVB from 315 nm - 280 nm). Consequently,
various mechanisms are involved in ensuring pathogen reduction. The amotosalen
intercalates into DNA and RNA and, when activated by UVA light, causes covalent
cross-linking of those nucleic acids thus preventing the replication. The riboflavin binds
to nucleic acids and, when activated by the illumination step, alters guanine residues via
type I and type II redox reactions. MB can intercalate into DNA or bind to the DNA helix,
depending on the concentration and ionic strength of Mg2+. When exposed to light type I
(redox) or type II (photo-oxidative) reactions occur, with most of the PR activity resulting
from type II reactions [22, 28].

In earlier studies on Ebola convalescent plasma [18, 19] it was shown that PR with
amotosalen/UVA only slightly reduced anti‐Ebola virus IgG titres and Ebola‐specific
neutralizing antibodies. Tonn et al [20] found that PR did not impair the stability and
neutralizing capacity of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in 5 CCP units treated with
psoralen/UVA.
The current study is the first to compare the impact of different PR technologies on
SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and activity in convalescent plasma.
The hypothesis tested in this study is that different types of photo-chemical reactions
used in standard PR technologies can have a different effect on the amount and
neutralizing activity of SARS-CoV2 specific antibodies in the final product - convalescent
plasma. The results obtained indicate a lesser effect on the immunological quality of
CCP of pathogen reduction with methylene blue or with amotosalen, possibly due to the
lesser amount of energy used for illumination and lesser amount of reactive oxygen
species releasing after photoactivation compared with riboflavin [28, 29]. More research
is needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms for the oxidative damage of proteins and
particularly immunoglobulins in course of different PR technologies.

Based on the study, we can recommend using pathogen reduction with methylene blue
or with amotosalen to ensure the safety and quality of CCP, due to the greater likelihood
of preserving the immunological properties of the final product. Since even these
technologies are associated with a risk of reducing the quantity and quality of antibodies
against SARS-CoV-2, it is recommended to transfuse at least 2 units of convalescent
plasma (200-300 ml) from different donors to one patient, especially in those medical
institutions where the routine measurement of NtAbs titres is not possible.
In those blood establishments where pathogen reduction with riboflavin is traditionally
used, it may be worth to consider increasing the dose of transfused convalescent
plasma in order to compensate for the decrease in the baseline neutralizing antibody
titres after this method of pathogen reduction.
