Abstract
A possible association between national Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination policy
and lower COVID-19 incidence has been suggested in some preprint papers. Using publicly
accessible databases, I explored associations of national BCG vaccination policy with
COVID-19 epidemiology in 78 countries. Data collection was conducted from April 25 to
May 5, 2020. I compared countries that have a current universal BCG vaccination policy
(BCG countries), with countries that currently lack such a policy (non-BCG countries). The
mixed effect model revealed national BCG policy decreases in the country-specific risk of
death by COVID-19, correspond to odds ratio of 0.446 (95% confidence interval 0.323 0.614, P=1×10−5). In BCG countries, the case increase rate was attenuated marginally by
25.4% (95% confidence interval 3.0 to 42.7, P=0.029) as compared with those of the
non-BCG countries. Although the protective mechanism of BCG vaccination against
COVID-19 remains unknown, further laboratory and clinical research should be warranted.

Introduction
A possible association between national Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination policy
and lower COVID-19 incidence has been suggested in some preprint papers.1,2,3 Given the
seriousness of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of an effective mitigation
strategy, the protective effect of BCG on COVID-19 epidemic is a matter of great interest.
Although an ecological study can be confounded by various biases and an ecological
fallacy is always concern to understand the results, the findings can provide the evidence to
conduct further prospective clinical researches. I examined the association between national
BCG vaccination policy and the case fatality rate of COVID-19 in 78 countries. I also
explored the relationship between BCG vaccination policy and the speed of COVID-19
increase within the countries.

Methods
Data for the analysis were extracted from publicly accessible databases on websites.4 Data
collection was conducted from April 25 to May 5, 2020. Inclusion criteria of the countries
analyzed were: 1) defined by the World Bank as an upper-income or upper-middle-income
country,5 and 2) country for which the necessary data were available. Countries with less
than 100 confirmed cases were excluded from the analysis. I compared countries that have
a current universal BCG vaccination policy (BCG countries), with countries that currently
lack such a policy (non-BCG countries).6
I focused two outcome measures to evaluate the impact of national BCG policy on
COVID-19 epidemiology. In this study, the case fatality rate (CFR) was defined as the
proportion of reported number of deaths due to COVID-19 compared to the total confirmed
cases on April 25, 2020. The CFRs of the countries were stratified by BCG policy and were
combined by fixed or random effects models to estimate the pooled CFR with 95%

confidence intervals (95% CI). A mixed effect logistic regression model was constructed to
calculate a country-specific odds ratio for the effect of national BCG policy on the CFR.
I also tried to determine whether the speed of COVID-19 case increase within the
countries was associated with their national BCG policy. I summarized the number of
weekly new diagnosed COVID-19 patients in the initial 8 weeks of the epidemic. Because
the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic varied by country, I defined the Day 1 as the day
the first confirmed COVID-19 patients was reported in the respective country. Using a
generalized estimating equation (GEE) with a log-linear link function, I estimated if the
slopes of case numbers were different between BCG and non-BCG countries. In the GEE
analysis, the population of the country was incorporated as an offset term for adjustment,
and robust “sandwich” variance estimators were used.
I did all analyses in R (version 3.6.3, “metaprop” for the CFR pooling, “lme4” for
mixed effect model, “geepack” for GEE). I considered P values of less than 0.05 to be
significant.

Results
A total of 78 countries (BCG countries: n=54; non-BCG countries: n= 24) met for the
inclusion criteria for this study. The total number of deaths in the 78 countries was 198,200
(on April 25, 2020) and this accounted for 97.5% of world COVID-19 mortalities to that
date.
As Figure 1 illustrates, there were significant heterogeneities in the CFR among
the countries analyzed. The pooled CFR stratified by national BCG policy was significantly
lower mortality in the BCG countries than in the non-BCG countries (Figure 1). The mixed
effect model revealed national BCG policy decreases in the country-specific risk of death
correspond to odds ratio of 0.446 (95% CI 0.323 - 0.614, P=1×10−5).

Figure 2 shows the case number trajectories for newly diagnosed patients in the
first 8 weeks of the epidemic in 78 countries. Assuming “independence” correlation
structure, the GEE modeling showed significant time effect and time-by-group interaction.
The coefficients of the GEE model can be translated so that the marginal mean rate ratio of
the case increase in the non-BCG countries was 1.826 (95% CI 1.460 to 2.283, P=1×10−6)
every week in initial 8 weeks. In BCG countries, the case increase rate was attenuated
marginally by 25.4% (95% CI 3.0 to 42.7, P=0.029) as compared with those of the
non-BCG countries.

Discussion
My analysis indicates that countries with national mandatory BCG vaccination policies
have lower reported COVID-19 mortality than those without such policies. Also, countries
with current mandatory BCG policies show slower spread of COVID-19 infection than
those without such policies. Although the protective mechanism of BCG vaccination
against COVID-19 remains unknown, further laboratory and clinical research should be
warranted.
