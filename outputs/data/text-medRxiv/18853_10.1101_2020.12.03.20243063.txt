Summary
During the current pandemic and in the past, shortages of high quality respirators have forced people to protect
themselves with homemade face masks that filter poorly in comparison to N95 respirators 1–4 and are often designed
in ways that makes them susceptible to leaks 5,6 . Nevertheless, there is compelling epidemiological 7,8 and laboratory
evidence 9–12 that face masks can be effective in impeding the spread of respiratory viruses such as influenza and
SARS-CoV-2. Here we show that this apparent inconsistency can be resolved with a simple face mask model that
combines our filtration efficiency measurements of various mask materials with existing data on exhaled aerosol
characteristics. By reanalyzing these data we are able to reconcile the vastly different aerosol size distributions
reported 13–19 and derive representative volume distributions for speech and breath aerosol. Multiplying filtration
efficiency by those aerosol volumes, which are proportional to emitted viral load, shows that electrostatically charged
materials perform the best but that even most uncharged fabrics remove > 85 % of breath and > 99 % of speech
aerosol volume for exhaled particles < 10 µm in diameter. A leak model we develop shows the best uncharged fabric
masks are made of highly air-permeable and often thin materials reducing viral load by up to 45 % and 50 % for
breath and speech, respectively. Less permeable materials provide reduced protection because unfiltered air is forced
through the leak. This can even render some charged materials inferior to uncharged household materials. Our
model also shows that thin fabric masks provide protection for the wearer from aerosols expelled by another person
reducing inhaled viral load by up to 20 % and 50 % and if leaks are avoided up to 35 % and 90 % for breath and
speech, respectively.

ing divergent results 17,19,24 but also reproduced multiple times 14–16,18 , confirming the notion of two breath
modes with average number concentration mode diameters around 0.95 µm and 3.36 µm at the high humidity
inside the respiratory tract (see methods for derivation
of mode diameters from existing data). The larger of
these two modes originates from an area around the vocal cords (larynx mode) where air turbulence ruptures
the laryngeal mucus layer during exhalation 26 , while the
smaller mode originates deep in the lungs. Studies show
that these tiny aerosols form during inhalation when the
lining fluid inside the lungs stretches and ruptures during reopening of the bronchioles that close during exhalation 14,16,27 . A single study found an even smaller mode
created in the lungs with a mean diameter near 0.15 µm 15 ,
which is supported by numerical modeling 27 .
Face masks and respirators are used to prevent exposure to viruses transported on these aerosols, but may be
beneficial if they merely reduce the viral load one is exposed to. It has been shown for influenza that, should
infection occur, exposure to a lower viral load causes a

Respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2
(severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) are detectable in the fluids of the upper respiratory tract of
infected people 9,20,21 and can be expelled from the nasal
and oral cavity within giant liquid aerosols, often referred
to as droplets, that are formed when mucus and saliva
layers break up during sneezing and coughing 22,23 and
even speaking 17,19 . The largest of these, with diameters
> 100 µm, rapidly settle to surfaces. Particles with diameters of a few tens of microns quickly lose water and
shrink in relatively dry ambient air, so fall slowly and
can remain airborne for extended periods. Even smaller
aerosols are generated during these activities 17,24,25 that
can stay airborne for hours but originate from deeper inside the respiratory tract.
Interest in these tiny aerosols, that are in fact the result of normal breathing, reaches back almost a century,
but it was not until the late 1990s that exhaled breath
aerosol was analyzed comprehensively with a laser-based
optical particle counter 13 . These observations have since
been repeated with other measurement techniques yield-

less severe disease 28 . To estimate viral load on expelled
aerosols and potential reduction by face masks, we assume that viral concentration within the liquid particles
is the same as in the respiratory fluid, so the number of
viruses is proportional to particle volume. This assumption is necessary since there are no measurements of virus
concentration per exhaled particle as a function of particle diameter. While different respiratory fluids likely also
have varying virus concentrations, it appears that breath
and speech aerosol volume are each dominated by single
respiratory fluid sources (Extended Data Fig. 6). Thus,
converting the existing number size distribution data to
volume distributions (see methods) yields a size distribution of relative viral load. We further assume that these
exhaled particle size distributions from healthy subjects
are the same as those from infected individuals, as has
been shown in a study on influenza virus 29 .

tors (Extended Data Table 1). Note, the tested KN95type models do not have the rigid hemispheric design of
respirators so are referred to as masks here.
Homemade masks lack electret material, so have considerably worse FPF between 0.7 and 0.85 (Fig. 1c) and
MPPS around 0.3 µm. The other 8 tested household materials (shown in Extended Data Fig. 4g-o) exhibit comparable MPPS and FPF with the exception of the coffee
filter and dust cover fabric, which perform worse. Our
observations agree well with previous household material
studies that reported FPFs around 60 - 90 % near their
MPPS 1–4 . As in earlier observations 1 we observe a sharp
increase in filtration efficiency above 1 µm with efficiency
reaching 100 % near 3 µm for all tested fabrics except the
dust cover.
An electret surgical-style (Berkshire) mask we tested
has FPF values between those for N95 respirators and
household materials (Fig. 1b), because these masks are
generally thinner and more permeable than N95 respirators (compare pressure drops in Extended Data Table 1)
reducing time for particle trapping as air flows through
the material. A lower fiber charge density also plays a role
in its decreased filtration performance 37,38 . Note that
the wide variety of reported FPFs (5 - 95 % at MPPS of
0.04 - 0.35 µm in diameter 6,30,32,39 ) indicates that some
surgical-style masks lack an electret filtration layer.
Three electret air filters were examined as well, showing FPF distributions similar to the surgical-style mask
because these materials are also designed for low air flow
resistance 33 (3M Filtrete 1500 and 2500, Blue Air filter;
see Extended Data Fig. 4). Of the materials only Filtrete 2500 outperforms the surgical-style mask at diameters above 0.1 µm, the approximate size of influenza and
SARS-CoV-2 viruses 40,41 .
Halyard H600 is another electret 42 material tested (Extended Data Fig. 4c). It is used as surgical wrap in hospitals and was proposed by medical professionals as mask
material earlier this year 43 . The material consists of two
easily separable layers (colored blue and white), which
when tested have significantly different air flow resistance
(Extended Data Table 1) but almost identical FPF, comparable to recent findings 42 and to the surgical-style mask
although H600 is harder to breathe through.

Filtration efficacy of various materials
Estimating the reduction of viral load for face masks requires information about the material’s filter penetration
fraction (FPF), which describes filtration efficacy as function of aerosol size and flow rate. It is determined in
the lab by challenging mask materials with laboratorygenerated test aerosols at a range of flow speeds and
subsequently dividing the aerosol concentration measured
downstream by the concentration observed upstream of
the material (see Eqs. 2 and 6 in methods).
Of the 20 materials tested in this study and summarized in Extended Data Table 1, two are cutouts from N95
respirators, 3M models 8210 and 8000. These respirator
types filter aerosol at efficiencies of 95 % 30–33 or close
to this value 34 at NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) standard flow speed around
their worst diameter, commonly referred to as most penetrating particle size (MPPS). For N95 respirators this size
is 0.04 - 0.1 µm in diameter 30–34 , which agrees well with
our results (Fig. 1a in blue and Extended Data Fig. 2 for
the other N95 model). Higher velocity data show FPFs
for both models considerably exceed 5 % (red in Fig. 1a)
consistent with earlier observations 35 .
All filters capture aerosol mechanically by impaction
and interception of larger particles that have too much inertia to avoid the fibers and by Brownian diffusion of very
small particles, leaving particles in the middle, around
0.3 µm, very difficult to capture. N95 respirators add an
electret trapping mechanism that attracts aerosols of opposite charge (Coulomb force) and via charge separation
in neutral particles (dielectric effect) using permanent
electrostatic charges embedded in melt-blown polypropylene fibers during manufacturing. This dramatically improves FPF without increasing resistance to airflow 36 .
The Chinese KN95 masks also use electret material and
show comparable FPF values (see Extended Data Fig.
2). However, one of the tested KN95 models is about
two times harder to breathe through than N95 respira-

Viral load reduction of face masks
By reconciling existing data on exhaled aerosol characteristics we are able to derive representative speech and
breath aerosol volume distributions. We model 4 scenarios that describe these distributions at two relative
humidities (RH) (see Extended Data Fig. 6). The two
“humid” scenarios represent exhalation through the face
mask (protecting others) assuming a humidity of 99.5 %
behind the mask, while the “dry” scenarios represent inhalation of particles through the mask that have shrunk in
50 % RH air after being exhaled by another person (selfprotection). For breath aerosols, the volume-weighted ge-

ometric mean diameters for the scenarios are 0.68 (dry)
and 2.15 µm (humid), and the speech aerosol diameters
are 2.75 and 8.59 µm (Extended Data Table. 3).
Viral load reduction (VLR) is the fraction of virus (as
represented by aerosol volume) removed by the mask. In
the absence of leaks, viral load penetrating the mask for
each of the 4 scenarios is just the integral of the volume
size distribution and the FPF at a particular breathing
rate, shown graphically for dry breath in the bottom row
of Fig. 1. Unfortunately, as we see all around us, few
masks actually fit tightly enough to seal, so some exploration of the effect of leaks is necessary. As a simple
approximation for gaps on each side of the nose in the
absence of a stiff nose bridge strip, we assume two leaks
with a diameter of 1 cm each, comparable to that of a
small finger of a human hand. Our model calculations
also require a mask surface area AM and breathing rate
since FPF is a function of flow velocity. We use 189 cm2
for the two N95 respirators 44 and 31 cm2 for all other face
masks as well as a minute volume of 10 L min−1 (MV; inhaled air per minute) typical for breathing at rest 45 (see
methods for details).
We limit our analysis to aerosol < 10 µm in diameter
because face masks with no leaks have a filtration efficiency of 100 % above 3 µm as discussed above. When
small leaks between face and mask are considered, some
larger particles will slip through, but their number is
likely to be small compared to those inertially impacted
onto the mask because they can not make the sharp turns
required to escape. We consider only breath and speech
since coughing aerosols smaller than 10 µm exhibit a volume distribution similar to that of speech 17,25 .
VLR values for masks and the two respirators are
shown in Fig. 2a-d where colors highlight material categories and darker and brighter shadings no-leak and leak
conditions, respectively. The N95 respirators and KN95
masks (in red and yellow) have identical VLR signatures
for all 4 scenarios because their VLR only depends on the
amount of unfiltered air passing through the leaks (Fig.
2e) since the fraction of air that makes it through the
mask has a VLR value of nearly 100 %. More importantly, these data show N95 respirators only reduce viral
load by about 70 % with leaks present, merely 20 % more
than the average VLR value for non-electret household
materials (in brown and gray) except for the case of dry
breathing. The household materials perform poorly in
this case (VLR < 20 %) because most of the viral load is
on particles below 3 µm above which most materials show
100 % filtration efficiency (Fig. 1c and f).
When leaks are included, the face masks provided by
Hawaiian mask makers show the lowest VLR values of
the tested materials (in brown in Fig. 2, 10 - 25 % VLR)
with exception of the “Allison” mask, even though their
FPF distributions are comparable to the other household
materials, because these masks are made out of multiple fabric layers or very tightly woven cotton (Extended
Data Table 1) reducing the mask’s permeability and con-

sequently forcing unfiltered air through the leaks instead
(Fig. 2e). Their low permeability also makes them about
5 times harder to breath through than a N95 respirator
(Fig. 2f). When properly sealed, these masks provide
exceptional protection with VLR values > 90 % in all
cases except dry breath but are 15 - 37 times harder to
breathe through than a N95 respirator decreasing chances
of their use in the community. Non-woven materials like
felted cotton (cotton pad), rayon (car shop towel) or
polypropylene (dust cover) may be an alternative showing
high breathability and increased VLR performance with
leaks present but slightly lower protection when properly
sealed. Of the household materials tested the “Allison”
mask, made out of two easily breathable rayon layers,
may be the best design compromise since it yields intermediate VLR values in the leak scenario and > 90 % in
all cases except dry breath when properly sealed.
The weakly electret materials (in blue) have VLR values in between those of household materials and N95 respirators in accordance with their FPF (e.g. Fig. 1b).
The surgical-style mask is in the middle of the spectrum
reducing viral load by 50 % with leaks and nearly 100 %
when sealed. Halyard H600 shows the same filtration performance when sealed but decreased VLR values when
leaks are present due to its high pressure drop. Filtrete
and Blue Air filters are at the upper end of the VLR spectrum but it may be challenging to make masks from these
thin materials. Their test results, however, are encouraging indicating effective air filtration in enclosed spaces is
possible with such filters.
Our KN95 masks (in yellow) perform poorly with leaks
present compared to N95 respirators because their AM is
much smaller (1/6 of a N95 respirator), which increases
flow resistance pushing more unfiltered air through the
leak. The small AM is likely an underestimate for some
KN95 models but is intended as worst-case scenario since
the ones tested here deflate during inhalation. The dramatic improvement of KN95 performance with increasing
AM is highlighted in Fig. 3a for dry breath with leaks
present showing VLR values in excess of those observed
for N95 respirators at comparable AM . A similar effect is
observed for the Allison mask (Fig. 3b) so a good mask
design should aim to maximize surface area. The increase
of VLR with increasing AM is small under leak-free conditions (bottom row) because it uniquely depends on FPF
changes with flow rate in this case. VLR is also a function of breathing rate but VLR increases with increasing
minute volume are small compared to the changes induced
by varying AM .
In summary, our model shows that the unexpected efficiency of face masks in reducing viral aerosol transmissions is the synergy of two effects: their excellent filtration
performance above 1 µm and the fact that the majority
of exhaled aerosol volume is found above this diameter.
In other words, face masks let a large portion of exhaled
aerosols through because most of these are smaller than
1 µm in diameter, but block most of the viral load, which

is carried on larger particles. A particle with a diameter of
3 µm has 1000 times the viral load of a 0.3 µm aerosol so is
far more important to filter. While this means the nearly
complete protection required in hospitals is only achieved
with a properly fitted N95 respirator, it also reinforces
the importance of wearing face masks in public during a
pandemic. Our calculations are intentionally pessimistic;
the small surface area, big leaks, and gentle breathing
rate are all reasonable, but bias VLR downward, so these
masks may perform better when worn properly.

Experiment and instrumentation
The Hawaii Group for Environmental Aerosol Research
(HiGEAR) instrumentation suite is repurposed for this
work to challenge a variety of proposed alternative mask
materials with sodium chloride (NaCl) aerosol in a manner similar to the NIOSH certification procedures for respirators. Test aerosol is generated by nebulizing a solution of NaCl (0.02 g ml−1 ) and ultra pure deionized water
with a particle generator (B&F Medical Supplies, LLC)
then adding desiccated filtered air to reduce RH past the
45 % efflorescence point of NaCl. All flows are regulated
by flow controllers (Alicat Scientific) to ensure a stable
aerosol concentration during experiments. This produces
a monomodal log-normal particle size distribution with a
geometric mean diameter of 0.115 µm and a standard deviation of 2.27. The dried particles are then diluted in a
mixing chamber with filtered room air to a concentration
of 1100 cm−3 (see flow chart in Extended Data Fig 1).
The aerosol passes through a 210Po-based charge neutralizer (a custom housing with 3 Staticmaster 2U500,
NRD), before it reaches the sample material clamped
into a filter holder made from NW 25 ISO-KF hose
adapters (MKS Instruments; exposed area of the filter
sample is 6.88 cm2 ). This neutralization of test aerosol is
an extremely important step because air friction charges
test aerosols during the nebulization process 46 . If left
untreated, charged test aerosol can artificially enhance
filtration efficiency of test materials because it induces
charge separation in oncoming particles (dielectric effect)
once trapped on the material fibers. As pointed out by
Ou et al. 42 this may have to be considered as limiting
factor when interpreting recent studies that show unusually high filtration efficiencies of household materials in
the submicrometer aerosol range 47 .
NaCl aerosol number concentration is obtained with
condensation nuclei counters (0.01 - 3 µm, CN 3010, TSI)
up- and downstream of the filter holder during the experiment. Particle size distributions are measured with 3
instruments: a long Differential Mobility Analyzer (0.01 0.5 µm, LDMA 3071A, TSI), an Ultra High Sensitivity
Aerosol Spectrometer (0.06 - 1 µm, UHSAS, DMT) and
an Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (0.5 - 10 µm, APS 3321,
TSI). The UHSAS has been shown to agree well with the
LDMA for NaCl aerosol 48 . APS aerodynamic diameters
are converted to geometric diameter using the dry NaCl
density of 2.16 g cm−3 . For low flow rate tests, the APS
was replumbed to recycle the 4 L min−1 sheath flow from
the exhaust, reducing its inlet flow to 1 L min−1 .

where QM is the mask flow rate and vFH the velocity
through the filter holder. Typical hemispheric N95 8210
respirators have a AM of 189 cm2 as measured earlier 44 ,
so our 3 flow speeds yield M V estimates of 10, 30 and
86 L min−1 , which correspond to resting, moderate and
strenuous activity levels 45 , respectively.

Filter penetration fraction
The UHSAS switches between up- and downstream
aerosol with samples in place, while the higher flow rate
LDMA and APS measurements are obtained with and
without mask material in the filter holder. Filter penetration fraction for each flow setting is then defined as the
ratio of average downstream (Dd ) to upstream (Du ) size
distributions, corrected for any changes in nebulizer output by the ratio of upstream CN concentrations during
the upstream (UCN u ) and downstream (UCN d ) periods:
FPF =

Dd UCN u
.
Du UCN d

(2)

FPF over the complete size range tested (0.02 - 3 µm) is
obtained by joining measurements from individual instruments. Overlapping instrument data are averaged.
Since FPF is a ratio, instrument errors, counting efficiency issues and flow-dependent tubing losses cancel each
other when calculating measurement uncertainty so the
error range ∆FPF depends mainly on the stability of the
aerosol generation over time. Since equation 2 accounts
for overall concentration changes, it is the shape of the
distribution that must be evaluated. Nebulizer variability is certainly the same during upstream and downstream
periods, so we use the size-dependent fractional standard
deviation ε (standard deviation/mean) of the upstream
distributions (Du /UCN u ) over the course of the whole
experiment. The 1σ estimated error range is then

are about 5 % at the high velocity setting (in red), which
amounts to an additional measurement error of about
20 %, consistent with earlier research 49 . Other materials
likely feature similar inhomogeneities but we do not have
sufficient samples to quantify that.

Air flow resistance
Air flow resistance RFlow or breathability is calculated by
measuring pressure drop ∆p across materials using the internal pressure sensor of the UHSAS unit (replumbed to
measure pressure in the sample line). The effect on pressure readings induced by varying tubing length between
up- and downstream setting is accounted for by assessing
pressure drop ∆pt at a given vFH with no material in the
filter holder. RFlow then becomes
RFlow =

∆p(vFH ) − ∆pt (vFH )

aerosol” size distribution, even though it may well include
twice the volume of the smaller modes. That means our
estimates of viral load reduction are pessimistic (biased
low), since these relatively large particles are effectively
filtered by all of the materials tested.
Aerosol emitted while vocalizing (“speech aerosol”) appears to have similar size modes as quiet breathing, but
the larynx mode is much more prominent. We include

of lung 2 mode is inconsequential at only 0.65 % of the larynx mode (Extended Data Fig. 6). Our speech aerosol
distributions only include data from work using APSs,
since the one study with an OPC provides insufficient
data to resolve the two modes. It is not clear whether
the larger lung mode 2 diameters found by the APS are
real or a product of experimental differences (uncertain
RH and quickly dropping APS detection efficiency below 0.9 µm 17,24 ). However, these differences matter little
when only considering aerosol volume as illustrated in the
bottom row of Extended Data Fig. 5 for APS measurements from Asadi et al. 19 . By replacing the log-normal
fits of lung mode 2 with forced fits (Dµ = 0.37 µm and
σ = 1.6) that resemble fit parameters for breathing, we
show both fit types yield almost identical aerosol volume
distributions.
The actual concentration of aerosols and viruses is in
general unknown, but we are interested in the fraction
removed, so only the relative concentrations as a function
of diameter are relevant. Therefore the span of almost 3
orders of magnitude in reported number concentration or
the lack of a reported concentration 16 does not affect our
analysis.
An important source of difference between studies is
the relative humidity at the point of measurement. After exhalation, the concentration of water in particles is
a strong function of RH, particularly at the high humidities at which aerosols are exhaled. Diameter, density,
and refractive index are all dependent on the water concentration, so even small deviations from exhalation RH
change particles significantly (and it is difficult to accurately control very high humidities). One can make more
precise diameter measurements after drying the aerosols,
but then the initial diameter must be calculated. Unlike some studies that used an RH-independent correction factor ψ to obtain the initial diameter 17,51 , here we
use electrodynamic balance studies on NaCl particles 52
to determine changes in diameter as a function of RH
(similar to an earlier report 53 ) because respiratory fluids
can be modeled as an aqueous NaCl solution with a water
activity (equivalent to RH) of 0.995 53 .
We convert our log-fit parameters from reported measurement humidity (when reported, otherwise we calculate RH from measurement temperature, assuming breath
was exhaled at 34 °C 15,54 ) to 99.5 % and 50 % RH by
dividing geometric mode mean diameters by ψ(RH) (Extended Data Table 2). The humid condition is for parti-

cles exhaled through the mask, representing the extent to
which the mask wearer is preventing spread of the virus.
“Dry” conditions show protection offered the wearer to
inhalation of breath and speech aerosol expelled by another person. The humidity-adjusted fit parameters are
converted to aerosol volume then averaged. These volume
fit parameters for breath and speech aerosol are summarized in Extended Data Table 3 and are shown together
with the distributions used in the averaging in Extended
Data Fig. 6. We set breath aerosol volume to an arbitrary
value of 1 µm3 cm−3 since we only consider lung mode 2.

The road to viral load
A key assumption we make is that virus concentration in
exhaled aerosol is equal to that in the respiratory fluids
from which the particles form. That means the amount
of virus on each particle is proportional to its volume and
the overall exhaled viral load VLT is proportional to the
integral of the aerosol volume distribution, which is easily
obtained by converting the number concentration size distribution assuming particles are spherical (see equation 5
and Extended Data Table 2). The viral load penetrating
the face mask VLM is proportional to the integral of the
product of the volume size distribution and filter penetration fraction (see bottom row of Fig. 1). In the absence of
leaks, the viral load reduction (expressed as a percentage)
is then simply the ratio of these two viral loads:
VLR = (1 − VLM /VLT ) × 100 .

(6)

Filter penetration fraction varies considerably with air
velocity (Extended Data Fig. 4) so is included in the calculation of VLM by interpolating between FPF data made
at the 3 flow speeds. FPF values above 3 µm are zero except for the coffee filter and dust cover fabric, which have
been extrapolated beyond 3 µm. The test velocities vM
that are used to create Fig. 2 are calculated via equation
1 based on a M V of 10 L min−1 (breathing at rest) and a
surface area of 189 cm2 for N95 respirators 44 and 31 cm2
for all other face masks (assuming a spherical cap shape
with a diameter and height of 3 cm and 1 cm).

Modeling face mask leakage
To estimate VLR under more realistic conditions, with
poorly fitted masks that leak on either side of the nose,
we model leak paths as a pair of tubes 3 cm long and
1 cm in diameter. Some of the virus-laden air still goes
through the mask, but some fraction will divert through
the leaks and remain unfiltered. VLR including the leak
then becomes
VLR = (1 − VLLM /VLT ) × 100 with

to equation 6 if leaks are eliminated (QL = 0). The flow
rates QL and QM are not immediately known but must
satisfy the requirement that the pressure drops across face
mask ∆pM (see Eqs. 1 and 4) and leak ∆pL are equal.
This condition is described by a set of nonlinear equations, which we iteratively solve for QL and ∆p:

with leak length lL and diameter dL , air density ρair (at
298.15 K and 1013.25 hPa), number of leaks φ, air viscosity µ, and the flow Reynolds number Re, which indicates
laminar flow when below 2100 (∆pL via equations 6.1.4,
6.2.11 and 6.2.12 in chapter 6 of Bird et al. 55 ). Our leak
model reproduces lab measurements of the total inward
leakage of NaCl aerosol 39 , defined as the sum of aerosols
that make it through a N95 respirator as well as leaks,
to within 10 % when we input the study’s test aerosol
distribution and the dimensions of the tubes that were
used as leak paths through a N95 respirator. We assume
their N95 respirator has the same filtration efficiency signatures and pressure drop as the N95 8210 tested here.
While only an estimate, this provides an indication that
our leak calculations are reasonable.
Our choice of a small surface area for all face masks (AM
= 31 cm2 ) but the two N95 respirators assumes that only
a small region around the nose and mouth are available
while inhaling, as many masks tend to collapse against
the face. This is likely to be an underestimate during
exhaling, but the leaks are expected to be smaller too,
and both vary with face contours, mask design, and fit in
ways that are difficult to model. The big leak, small filter
area, low minute volume, and limitation to lung mode 2 in
Fig. 2 all bias the VLRs down; this is intended as a worstcase scenario with ill-fitted masks. If efforts are made
to reduce leaks and increase filtration area, protection is
substantially increased, even with non-electret masks, as
shown in Fig. 3 for two selected face masks.
A detailed error analysis for VLR is not practical
because instrument and measurement errors of existing
breath and speech aerosol studies are not clear, and we
do not know whether the viruses partition uniformly into
aerosol volume. VLR uncertainty is, however, expected
to be small in comparison to changes induced by RH, QT ,
AM and of course leak size, as discussed in the manuscript.

Extended Data Table 2 | Summary of existing breath and speech aerosol observations. Acronyms listed
are as used by authors. Measurements have been adapted from studies and are represented by a log-normal fit
consisting of up to two modes. Each aerosol mode can be expressed by total number concentration N , the geometric
mode mean diameter Dµ , and its geometric standard deviation σ. Corrections provided in the last two columns
adjust Dµ at observation relative humidity (RH) to humid (99.5 %) and dry (50 %) conditions. The humid condition
applies during exhalation through the face mask, while dry conditions represent aerosol inhalation (expelled by
another person) at a moderate ambient RH. Observation humidity shown is either directly provided by the authors
or calculated via temperature of measurement and exhaled air (assuming exhaled air is at 34 °C; marked with ∗).

Extended Data Fig. 6 | Normalized average breath and speech aerosol volume distributions. Mean
breath and speech aerosol volume distributions derived from individual volume fits (in gray) are highlighted in black
and blue, respectively. Mean volume fit parameters are 1
summarized in Extended Table 3 and are calculated from
humidity-adjusted number concentration log-normal fit parameters (provided in Extended Table 2). The data are
normalized to the maximum value to illustrate distribution shape. Aerosol volume in the left column approximates
inhalation of aerosol expelled by another person, while humid conditions represent exhalation through the face mask.
