Abstract
Background: In Japan, as a countermeasure against the COVID-19 outbreak, voluntary
restrictions against going out (VRG) have been applied.
Object: We examined mobility information provided by Apple Inc. to a
susceptible–infected–recovery model.
Method: When applying a polynomial function to daily Apple data with the SIR model,
we presumed the function up to a cubic term as in our earlier study.
Results: Estimation results demonstrated R0 as 1.507 and its 95% confidence interval
was [1.502, 1.509]. . The estimated coefficients of Apple data was 1.748 and its 95%
confidence interval was [1.731, 1.788].
Discussion and Conclusion: Results show that mobility data from Apple Inc. can
explain the entire course of the outbreak in COVID-19 in Japan. Therefore, monitoring
Apple data might be sufficient to adjust control measures to maintain an effective
reproduction number of less than one.

Introduction
Some reasons for how the COVID-19 outbreak peak can be overcome might be inferred
to support planning and evaluation. Two modes are herd immunity [1] and infection
countermeasures [2].
In Japan, in preference to lockdowns such as those instituted in European and North
American countries, voluntary restrictions against going out (VRG) were announced by
national and local governments from the end of March [3]. However, the VRG program
intensity has been changing over time. Public cooperation with VRG has also been
changing. Lockdowns such as those instituted in Europe and North America might
eventually lead to cessation as determined by their respective governments. However, in
Japan, efforts are voluntary: people can adjust their own degree of cooperation
independently. Therefore, the government should monitor current circumstances of an
outbreak when moderating requirements for VRG. However, some delay occurred in
reporting the number of the newly infected patients. One delay is attributable to the
incubation period from infection to onset; another delay is that occurring after onset
until reporting. Taken together, for approximately two weeks, one is unable to observe a
precise daily number of newly infected persons. Therefore, because the latest
information might not be timely, policies might be less effective if a government waits
two weeks to conduct decision-making.

To date, susceptible–infected–recovery (SIR) models for COVID-19 incorporating
countermeasures have emphasized the date of countermeasure initiation [2,4,5].
However, the use of VRG has expanded gradually, at least in the case of Japan.
Therefore, an all-or-nothing approach such as that implied by an SIR model might be
inappropriate. A more continuous variable is expected to be necessary to assess
compliance with VRG over time.
Those variables have been reported from several services, including those of Apple
Inc. and Alphabet Inc. (hereinafter Apple and Google, respectively) worldwide, and
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) and East and West Japan Railway companies
(JR) in Japan. Of those, Apple, as the front-runner of this service, has provided related
data from January 13. The daily information has included the number of trips from
home by type, such as driving and walking [6].
Using mobility information provided by Apple, we examined associations with the
entire course of the outbreak in Japan. It might be sufficient to monitor the mobility data
to control it if one can explain the entire course of the outbreak solely on the basis of
mobility data.

Methods

We applied a simple deterministic SIR model [2,4,5] along with mobility data to
the epidemic curve in Japan, with its 120 million population. We assume an incubation
period that conforms to the empirical distribution in Japan. The number of symptomatic
patients reported by the Ministry of Labour, Health and Welfare (MLHW) for January
14 – May 24 published [7] on May 25 were used. Some patients were excluded from
data: those presumed to be persons infected abroad or infected as passengers on the
Diamond Princess. Those patients were presumed not to represent community-acquired
infection in Japan.
For onset dates of some symptomatic patients that were unknown, we estimated
their onset date from an empirical distribution with duration extending from onset to the
report date among patients for whom the onset date had been reported. We estimated the
onset date of patients for whom onset dates were not reported as follows: Letting f(k)
represent this empirical distribution and letting Nt denote the number of patients for
whom onset dates were not published by date t, then the number of patients for whom
the onset date was known is t-1. The number of patients for whom onset dates were not
available was estimated as f(1)Nt. Similarly, the number of patients with onset date t-2
and for whom onset dates were not available was estimated as f(2)Nt. Therefore, the
total number of patients for whom the onset date was not available, given an onset date

of s, was estimated as Σk=1f(k)Ns+k for the long duration extending from s.
Moreover, the reporting delay for published data from MHLW might be
considerable. In other words, if s+k is larger than that in the current period t, then s+k
represents the future for period t. For that reason, Ns+k is not observable. Such a
reporting delay engenders underestimation bias of the number of patients. For that
reason, it must be adjusted as Σk=1t-sf(k)Ns+k /Σk=1t-sf(k). Similarly, patients for whom
the onset dates were available are expected to be affected by the reporting delay.
Therefore, we have Ms|t /Σk=1t-sf(k), where Ms|t represents the reported number of
patients for whom onset dates were within period s, extending until the current period t.
We defined R(t) as the number of infected patients on day t divided by the number
of patients who were presumed to be infectious. The number of infected patients was
calculated from the epidemic curve by the onset date using a distribution of the
incubation period. The distribution of infectiousness in symptomatic and asymptomatic
cases was assumed to be 30% on the onset day, 20% on the following day, and 10% for
the subsequent five days [8].
To clarify associations among the epidemic curve and Apple data, we incorporated
a polynomial function of daily Apple data into the SIR model. Especially, we presumed
a function up to cubic term as in our earlier study [9]. For analyses of the present study,

R0 was defined as the average secondary infection from one infected person if all
persons are susceptible and if their degree of mobility level is normal, i.e. equal to that
of January 13, 2020.
We sought R0 and the cubic function of Apple data to fit the epidemic curve by
minimizing the sum of the absolute difference. Its 95% confidence interval (CI) was
calculated using 10,000 iterations of bootstrapping for the empirical distribution of
epidemic curves.

Ethical consideration
All information used for this study has been published [6,7]. There is therefore no
ethical issue related to this study.

Results
As of May 25, using data for January 14 – May 25 in Japan, 14,972
community-acquired cases were identified, excluding asymptomatic cases. Figure 1
presents an empirical distribution of the duration of onset to reporting in Japan. The
maximum delay was 30 days. Figure 2 depicts the empirical distribution of incubation
periods among 125 cases for which the exposed date and onset date were published by

MHLW in Japan. The mode was six days. The average was 6.6 days.
Figure 3 depicts the epidemic curves, the fitted line, and its 95% confidential
interval. Estimation results showsthat R0 was 1.507 and its 95% confidence interval (CI)
was [1.502, 1.509]. The estimated coefficients of Apple data was 1.748 and its 95% CI
was [1.731, 1.788]. The range of the 95% CI was a small area that covered almost the
entire epidemic curve, as shown in Figure 3.

Discussion
One can reasonably infer that the four parameters explained the entire course of the
outbreak completely. In other words, the variation of mobility data can include data for
the outbreak. Therefore, the monitoring of Apple data and countermeasures depend on
their probable capability of controlling the outbreak, at least in Japan. Actually, Apple
data were provided with a two-day delay. However, we can infer the current situation of
the newly infected in just two days. The average incubation period and reporting delay
were 6–7 days, respectively. Therefore the delay from new infection to reporting was
almost two weeks. Results suggest that Apple data are the most timely and precise
information sources for newly infected persons.
In this study, R0 was smaller than that reported from an earlier study [10–12]: the

estimated R0 for COVID-19 is 2.24–3.58. However, one study revealed R0 in Japan
through 26 February as just 0.6 [13], meaning that an outbreak would never occur in
Japan. Such estimates might also mislead policies for countermeasures in Japan, which
have so far necessitated adherence to contact tracing to detect clusters. In both cases,
one must be reminded that R0 in this study was defined as normal mobility equal to that
of January 13, 2020. Therefore, it might be difficult or meaningless to compare R0 with
similar figures referred from other reports.
The present study has some limitations. First, we examined the explanatory power
for the COVID-19 outbreak nationwide, but is it applicable at the prefecture level? For
example, did Apple data for Osaka prefecture have sufficient explanatory power to
assess the outbreak dynamics? If so, one must monitor Apple data from Osaka or other
prefectures carefully. Similarly, are these data and methods useful for countries other
than Japan? If these methods hold in the US, for example, Apple data might contribute
to efforts at controlling outbreaks there.
Secondly, one must be reminded that Apple data show a proportion of users leaving
their residence. The data do not directly indicate a number of contacts or even a rate of
contact. In other words, Apple data reflect no intensity of the respective contacts.
However, such measurement of contact intensity is extremely difficult. That

measurement represents a future research objective.
Thirdly, although Apple data was better than others, the users of Apple products and
services might be limited to young or healthy persons. By contrast, information from
NTT or JR might reflect the activities of an otherwise limited scope or number of users.
Therefore, a combination of these data with Apple data might be better than the data
used for the present study. That is anticipated as our next challenge.

Conclusion
We demonstrated that mobility data from Apple can explain the entire course of the
outbreak in COVID-19 in Japan. Therefore, it might be sufficient to monitor Apple data
to adjust control measures to maintain the effective reproduction number as less than
one.
