Abstract
Context Easing social distancing (ESD) is a global public health issue in postpandemic period of COVID-19 and requires a simple index for real time assessment.
Objective We aimed to develop a simple index for ESD to quantify the impacts of
social distancing for reducing confirmed infected cases, optimal triage and care of
patients for recovery, and critical care capacity for reducing death from COVID-19.
Design, Setting, and Participants Data on the retrospective cohort of 185 countries
with reported numbers on confirmed cases, recovery, and death from COVID-19 were
retrieved from publicity available repository. Up to May 31, a total of 5,844,136
confirmed cases, 2,639,961 recovered, and 327,487 deaths were reported globally.
Main Outcome Measures The ESD index measured by cumulative number of
COVID-19 cases and recovery and case-fatality rate.
Results We developed a simple index for the guidance of easing social distancing
(ESD). If the ESD index is less than 1, ESD would be considered. The global ESD
index declined from 3.87 at peak in March to 1.35 by the end of May, consisting of
56.76% countries/regions (105/185) with the ESD lower than one.
Conclusion and Relevance
This simple ESD index provides a quantitative assessment on whether and when to
ease social distancing from local to global community.

Introduction
While border controls and social distancing have been executed since the
beginning of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic1-4 it is time to
ponder over how to ease social distancing in the post-pandemic period with real time
assessment 5 as reviving economic business and normal social activities have been
urgently needed.
Though there are six criteria for countries while considering de-escalation by
reversing restrictions or lockdown6, it is still unclear whether and when to implement
the reopening policy. It is insufficient to merely consider the force of the spread of
COVID-19.2-4,7-11 One has to consider the optimal allocation of COVID-19 with an
efficient triage system to accelerate the rate of recovery from hospitalization or selfisolation and also take into account critical care capacity to avert death from COVID19. To quantify the impacts of these three factors, a simple ESD index was developed
for health decision-makers to do real-time assessment of COVID-19 at global,
country, region, and community level.

Material and Methods

The data for analysis were derived from the web-based real-time GitHub
repository created by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at
Johns Hopkins University.12 CSSE operates daily updates upon publicly available
data, including confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deaths from multiple sources. A
total of 188 countries have reported confirmed COVID-19 cases (including
presumptive positive cases and probable cases) at country and region level that is
aligned with WHO situation reports.13 A total of 185 affected countries and regions
were available from Jan. 22 till May 31, 2020 after excluding three countries or
regions without information on recovery. Data on New York State were abstracted
from GitHub repository.14
An index of easing social distancing (ESD) is expressed as follows.

Cumulative number of cases

ESD= [

(Cumulative number of recovery)×(1−case fatality)

] − 1.

ESD is the ratio of cumulative confirmed cases to cumulative recovered patients
without dying from COVID-19 that is captured by (1-case-fatality (f)) minus one
during a fixed time period. The reason for subtracting one is that in an ideal scenario
the aforementioned ratio would reach 1 when all confirmed cases have been recovered

without death (case-fatality rate=0) and therefore ESD would approach zero,
suggesting the region has a full recovery after the outbreak of COVID-19 and may
return to the normal status.
However, it is impracticable to ease social distancing until the value of ESD
reaches to 0. One has to consider the balance between the spread of COVID-19, the
rate of recovery, and critical care capacity. The first element is to capture the
information on the force in relation to the spread of COVID-19 after the
implementation of social distancing that is often modelled by reproductive number.
The second element is dependent on whether health care systems have the capacity of
offering hospitalization based on efficient triage of COVID-19 patients. The third one
is determined by critical care capacity that can stop the progression from acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to subsequent deaths. If the value of ESD index
is larger than 1 it is still necessary to maintain social distancing because the rate of the
spread of COVID-19 still outweighs the affordable capacity of hospitalization and
critical care. If it is lower than 1 easing social distancing (ESD) can be considered.
The degree of ESD lower than 1 is assessed by the inverse of the decile of ESD index
form the lowest percentile (0.1) to the highest percentile (1). The multinomial
distribution using the reported number of confirmed cases, recovery, and death in
conjunction with Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method was used for the

Results

The ESD index for countries/regions worldwide
As of 31st May, 5,844,136 confirmed cases, 2,639,961 recovered, and 327,487
deaths from COVID-19 were reported globally, which gave a case-fatality rate of
5.6%. The global ESD index was 1.345 (95% CI: 1.343-1.347), which suggests that
easing social distancing has not been reached yet at global level. Namely, the spread
of COVID-19 from hotspot to hotspot still exceeded the capacity of hospitalization
and critical care for COVID-19 cases at global level.
Figure 1 shows the temporal trend of global ESD index. The global ESD index
began from the 1.141 (95% CI: 1.127-1.157) on Mar. 1 just before the announcement
of COVID-19 pandemic and peaked on Mar. 29 (3.870, 95% CI: 3.848-3.892).
Figure 2 shows the distribution of ESD index for 185 countries and regions.
Countries with the color in red are less likely to ease social distancing whereas those
with the color in green are the opposite. Of 185 countries/region, 56.75% (n=105) of
the ESD index was smaller than 1.
According to the decile of the ESD index for each of two categories (≥ 1 and <1),
Figure 3 shows the frequencies on the index of ESD for the countries/regions globally
aggregated by three groups for the ESD ≤ 1, including < 0.1 (n=16), 0.1-0.4 (n=52),
0.5-1 (n=37), and by five groups group for the ESD >1, including, 1.1-1.4 (n=26), 1.57

1.9 (n=10), 2-2.4 (n=4), 2.5-2.9 (n=5) and 3+ (n=35).

The ESD index used for different scenarios
The ESD index can be adapted to different kinds of scenarios featuring with
differential influences of three elements.
Countries and regions show a low ESD index such as Iceland and Taiwan had
high recovery rate (Iceland: 99%, Taiwan: 96%) and low case-fatality (Iceland: 0.6%,
Taiwan: 1.6%), both indicate that the spread of COVID-19 has been contained and
both the patient triage system and critical care capacity were affordable to meet the
needs for COVID-19 cases during the pandemic. For countries such as Germany
(ESD index: 0.163; 95% CI: 0.160-0.166), a moderate case-fatality rate (4.7%) was
compensated by the high recovery rate (90%) through early detection followed by
efficient patient triage and high capacity of hospitalization.
Countries with high ESD index such as France (ESD: 2.257; 95% CI: 2.235 2.278) were attributed to high case-fatality rate mainly resulting from insufficient
capacity of critical care. The high ESD index was, to a greater extent, due to 15.2%
case-fatality rate (around 2.7 times the average worldwide) and, to a lesser extent, due
to modest recovery rate (36.2%, around 0.8 of the average worldwide).
The impact of high transmission of SARS-COV-2 and low recovery rate (17.8%)

would result in extremely higher ESD demonstrated by New York State (ESD: 5.011;
95% CI: 4.967-5.053) even though the case-fatality rate (6.4%) was comparable to the
average worldwide.

Resurgence of COVID-19 epidemic in local community
The ESD index can be also applied to evaluating whether social distancing has to
be re-executed. Using South Korea as an example, although the overall ESD till the
end of April was 0.22, the ESD indices from May 1 up to May 16 and May 31 were
estimated as 2.39 and 4.93, respectively, indicating that the outbreak was re-emerging
and might call for re-strengthening social distancing measures.

Conclusion

In summary, a simple index for easing social distancing was developed to aid
health policy-makers in the assessment of whether and when to ease social distancing
in post-pandemic period from local to global community.
