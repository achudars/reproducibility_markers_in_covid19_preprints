Abstract
Background and Objective: Convalescent plasma (CP) has been embraced as a safe
therapeutic option for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) while other treatments are
developed. However, transfusion-transmitted disease is a risk, particularly in regions
with high endemic prevalence of transfusion-transmissible diseases. Pathogen
reduction can mitigate this risk; thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the
effect of riboflavin and ultraviolet light (R+UV) pathogen reduction technology on the
functional properties of CCP.
Materials and Methods: CCP units (n = 6) from recovered COVID-19 research donors
were treated with R+UV. Pre- and post-treatment samples were tested for coagulation
factor and immunoglobulin retention. Antibody binding to spike protein receptor binding
domain (RBD), S1, and S2 epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed by ELISA.

Neutralizing antibody (nAb) function was assessed by pseudovirus reporter viral particle
neutralization (RVPN) assay and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT).
Results: Mean retention of coagulation factors was ≥ 70% while retention of
immunoglobulins was 100%. Starting nAb titers were low, but PRNT50 titers did not
differ between pre- and post-treatment samples. No statistically significant differences
were detected in levels of IgG (P ≥ 0.3665) and IgM (P ≥ 0.1208) antibodies to RBD,
S1, and S2 proteins before and after treatment.
Conclusion: R+UV PRT effects on coagulation factors were similar to previous reports,
but no significant effects were observed on immunoglobulin concentration and antibody
function. SARS-CoV-2 nAb function in COVID-19 convalescent plasma is conserved
following R+UV PRT treatment.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic bears testimony to the risk
presented by emerging infectious diseases (EID). Few treatment options are available
when novel viruses first arise, but the use of convalescent plasma (CP) may be an
expedient therapeutic approach until other medical countermeasures become widely
available. CP is a treatment in which putatively antibody-rich plasma is taken from those
recovered from the disease and transfused to provide passive immunity to infected
patients or susceptible individuals. Case reports of effective use of CP date back to the
1918 influenza pandemic [1] and more recently to EID outbreaks including severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) [2, 3], Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [4],
H1N1 influenza [5], and Ebola virus disease (EVD) [6]. In the current pandemic COVID19 CP (CCP) has demonstrated safety with minimal side effects [7], though controlled
clinical efficacy data is only beginning to come in [8-10].
While the most effective protocols for treatment with CCP are yet to be defined, plasma
transfusion is a routine medical procedure available globally. However, as with any
blood product, there is a risk of transmitting bloodborne pathogens with CCP
transfusion. The causative agent for COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is itself not believed to be transfusion-transmissible [11].
Yet the possibility of co-infections is present, particularly in regions with a high endemic
prevalence of other infectious diseases [12]. Pathogen reduction technology (PRT)
treatment of CCP is a measure that can be taken to maintain the safety of the blood
supply while providing potential benefits to COVID-19 patients.
PRT systems have been developed over the past decades as a proactive means to
reduce the residual risk of transfusion-transmitted infections that continues to exist
despite the implementation of routine blood safety practices such as donor
questionnaires, travel deferrals, and viral screening tests [13, 14]. Donor infections
could escape these blood safety measures for a number of reasons, including a
“window period” donation where the viral load has not yet reached the detection limit of
screening tests, a lack of testing capability for particular infectious agents, or an
unfavorable cost-benefit ratio for continuing to implement more and more tests. PRT

provides a broad-spectrum means to reduce pathogen loads and inhibit infectivity by
disrupting the microorganism’s ability to replicate. Commercial PRT systems use
chemicals, ultraviolet (UV) light, or the combination of a photosensitizer and UV light to
inactivate pathogens, but pathogen kill must be balanced to preserve the blood product
quality [15]. Recently a PRT system based upon riboflavin and UV light (R+UV) has
been reported to be effective in inactivating SARS-CoV-2 [16, 17]; the work described
herein evaluates the effect of R+UV treatment on functional properties of CCP.
Methods
COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Collection
CCP was provided by an accredited blood center specializing in biomaterial collections
for research (Key Biologics, Memphis, TN, USA). CCP was collected by apheresis
under an IRB-approved protocol from donors determined to have recovered from
COVID-19 and was shipped to Colorado State University. All products were placed into
frozen storage at ≤ -20 °C upon receipt until needed for further processing.
Riboflavin and UV Light Pathogen Reduction Treatment
CCP units were treated using a R+UV PRT system (Mirasol® Pathogen Reduction
Technology, Terumo Blood and Cell Technologies, Lakewood, CO, USA) as previously
described [18]. Briefly, thawed CCP units were transferred to an illumination bag and
mixed with 35 mL of riboflavin solution (500 µmol/L riboflavin in 0.9% sodium chloride,
pH 4.0 to 5.0 [Terumo Blood and Cell Technologies, Larne, Ireland]). The prepared
units were then placed into the UV illumination device (Terumo Blood and Cell
Technologies, Lakewood, CO, USA) and exposed to 6.24 J/mL of energy. Samples for
analysis were taken prior to the addition of riboflavin solution (Post-Collect), after
addition of riboflavin (Pre-Treat), and after UV illumination (Post-Treat). Sample aliquots
were stored frozen (≤ -20°C) in cryovials until testing. CCP units were analyzed for
selected coagulation factors, immunoglobulins, and SARS-CoV-2 antibody binding and
neutralizing activity.

Plasma Protein Assays
Coagulation factors were tested at Terumo Blood and Cell Technologies (Lakewood,
CO, USA) using the STA Compact Max (Diagnostica Stago US, Parsippany, NJ, USA).
Chromogenic assays were used to measure factor VIII activity (Chromogenix Coamatic®
Factor VIII reagent, diaPharma, Group, Inc., West Chester, OH, USA) and antithrombin
III activity (STA®-Stachrom® AT III reagent, Diagnostica Stago). An immunoturbidimetric method was used to assess von Willebrand factor antigen activity (STA®
Liatest® VWF:Ag). Clotting assays included fibrinogen (STA® Fibrinogen 5), Protein C
(STA®-Staclot® Protein C) and Protein S (STA®-Staclot® Protein S). The performance of
the STA Compact Max instrument has been qualified for intra-run and total precision for
all assays performed.
Plasma immunoglobulins and IgG subclasses were measured by standard quantitative
nephelometry (IgG, IgA, IgM at UC Health Anschutz, Aurora, CO, USA; IgG subclasses
at ARUP Laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT, USA). The reference laboratories performing
immunoglobulin analysis are accredited by the College of American Pathologists (CAP)
and maintain Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification.
SARS-CoV-2 Functional Assays
An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed at Colorado State
University to test CCP samples and a negative control (normal plasma sample) for
antibody binding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and
epitopes associated with the spike protein subunits S1 and S2 (catalog numbers 40592V08H, 40591-V08H, and 40590-V08B, Sino Biological US Inc., Wayne, PA, USA). The
protocol for ELISA was adapted from Robbiani et al. [19] with a few modifications.
Briefly, high binding 96-half-well microplates (Corning Life Sciences, Tewksbury, MA,
USA) were coated with 50 ng S1, S2, or RBD protein prepared in PBS and incubated
overnight at 4 °C. On the next day, the plates were washed 5 times with 180 µL wash
solution (PBS + 0.05% Tween 20) and non-specific interactions were blocked using 180
µL blocking buffer (PBS + 0.05% Tween 20 + 2% BSA + 2% normal goat serum
[Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc., West Grove, PA, USA]). After 2 hours the plates were
washed and different CCP sample dilutions prepared in blocking buffer were added to

the wells and incubated for 1 hour. Plates were then washed and incubated for 1 hour
with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated anti-human IgG or anti-human IgM
secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc.) prepared in blocking buffer
(1:10,000 dilution). The colorimetric substrate was developed with the addition of 100 µL
TMB substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA), and the reaction was
stopped by adding 50 µL 1M sulfuric acid. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using
a BioTek Synergy 2 plate reader (BioTek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT, USA).
The neutralizing activity of CCP samples was evaluated by two assays, a pseudovirus
reporter viral particle neutralization (RVPN) assay and a plaque reduction neutralization
test (PRNT). The RVPN assay was performed at Vitalant Research Institute (VRI, San
Francisco, CA, USA) as previously described [20, 21]. In brief, a vesicular stomatitis
virus (VSV)-firefly luciferase pseudotype modified to express the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein was mixed with four-fold dilutions of heat inactivated CCP. A positive serum
control and a negative serum control were also prepared. After incubation for one hour
at 37 °C the preparations were used to infect reporter cells that were plated into black
96-well tissue culture treated plates. The reporter cells were lysed after 24 hours at
37 °C and removal of the supernatant. Luciferase activity was measured to determine
the RVPN result. NT50 titers were estimated by calculating percentages of the no serum
control and performing non-linear regression. Titers measuring < 40 are deemed to lack
nAbs.
The PRNT assay was conducted in a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory at the
Colorado State University Infectious Disease Research Center (Fort Collins, CO, USA).
CCP samples were heat inactivated for 30 minutes at 56 °C and serial 2-fold dilutions
were prepared in a 96-well plate (Greiner Bio One, Monroe, NC, USA). Viral stock
(strain hCoV-19/USA/WA1/2020, BEI Resources, Manassas, VA, USA) containing
approximately 200 plaque-forming units (pfu) per 0.1 mL was added to each well
containing plasma dilutions. Following an incubation period at 37 °C in a 5% CO2
incubator, 6-well plates (Greiner Bio One) containing recently confluent Vero cells
(ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were inoculated with the virus-plasma mixtures. After a
second incubation period at 37 °C, 2 mL of overlay (2X MEM with 4% FBS [Peak
Serum, Wellington, CO, USA] and agarose) was added to each well. After 24 hours

incubation at 37 °C a second overlay containing neutral red (Millipore Sigma, ST. Louis,
MO, USA) was dispensed into each well and the number of plaques was counted 48 to
72 hours after initial inoculation. The highest dilution of plasma that inhibited plaque
formation by 50% (PRNT50) was determined based upon the titer of the viral stock and
the number of plaques present at each dilution. Donors with PRNT50 titers of less than
or equal to 1:20 are considered negative for nAbs.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics including the mean and standard deviation were calculated for all
continuous parameters. To assess the effect of R+UV PRT treatment, Pre-Treat
samples were used as the basis for comparison rather than Post-Collect samples in
order to account for dilution with riboflavin solution. Protein retention percentages were
calculated by taking the ratio of Post-Treat to Pre-Treat values for each sample pair and
multiplying by 100. ELISA results were analyzed by plotting optical density
measurements by dilution and calculating the area under the curve (AUC) using the
trapezoid method.
Comparisons for parameters passing the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality were performed
using a paired, two-tailed t test where statistical significance was defined as α < 0.05.
Data sets exhibiting a non-normal distribution were evaluated non-parametrically using
a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. Statistical analysis was performed using
Prism 8 for Windows (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).
Results
CCP was collected from 6 donors with demographics as described in Table 1. All 6 units
met the incoming product specifications for the R+UV PRT process and were
successfully treated. Protein retention analysis (Table 2) demonstrated that although
there was a statistically significant treatment effect for the coagulation factors, retention
was on the order of 70% or better. Of note is that the immunoglobulin concentrations,
including those for IgG subclasses, were unaffected by R+UV treatment as
demonstrated by retention remaining at 100%.

All 6 CCP units demonstrated binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD as well as the S1 and
S2 subunits of the spike protein when assessed by ELISA using anti-IgG and anti-IgM
secondary antibodies. The levels of IgM antibodies detected were generally lower and
more variable than IgG antibodies, particularly for those targeted against the RBD, but
normalized AUC values did not significantly differ between Pre-Treat and Post-Treat
time points for either IgG or IgM at any of the binding sites (Figure 1). Similarly, SARSCoV-2 neutralizing activity was detected by the PRNT assay in all of the Post-Collect
and Pre-Treat CCP samples, though one unit was at the 1:20 threshold. The PRNT50
titer for one unit (370020801130) dropped by one dilution between Post-Collect and
Pre-Treat, but all CCP units demonstrated stable PRNT50 titers when comparing PreTreat and Post-Treat samples (Table 3). Two units and one additional Pre-Treat sample
tested negative by the RVPN assay, and estimated RVPN NT50 titers were variable
(Table 4).
Discussion
This study evaluated the effect of R+UV PRT treatment on functional properties of CCP.
A treatment effect upon coagulation factors was observed following R+UV treatment,
but the reductions seen were consistent with previously published R+UV literature [18,
22-25]. Moreover, all PRT methods are known to degrade plasma proteins to varying
degrees [26-29]. Minimal effects upon antibodies were demonstrated, from the very
general immunoglobulin retention percentages to the more specific SARS-CoV-2
epitope binding measurements. Neutralizing antibody activity was similarly wellpreserved, with the highest RVPN dilutions positive for neutralizing activity remaining
the same after treatment and Pre-Treat and Post-Treat PRNT50 values being identical
for all CCP units. The PRNT50 titer for one CCP unit dropped when comparing PostCollect and Pre-Treat samples, which is likely an artifact of dilution with riboflavin
solution during the R+UV PRT treatment process. The stability demonstrated in this
study is consistent with previous assessments of antibody function in PRT-treated
plasma [30, 31]. These data suggest that PRT treatment does not impair the passive
immunity provided by CCP.

Some differences were observed between the results provided by the two assays for
nAb activity. An additional unit was deemed negative for nAb activity and lower titers
were reported for two units by the RVPN assay compared to the PRNT assay. The
higher sensitivity of the PRNT assay may stem from greater susceptibility of the wild
type virus to a more diverse set of antibodies or quaternary epitopes that cannot be
replicated with the pseudovirus [32]. While the PRNT assay has higher sensitivity,
working with live SARS-CoV-2 requires BSL-3 containment measures. The RVPN
assay was developed to quantitatively measure SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers safely
in laboratory facilities typical of blood centers to select CCP units for therapeutic use
[21]. RVPN NT50 values were quite variable and most likely were not representative of
R+UV PRT treatment effects. Given the low titer of the CCP units evaluated in the
study, the non-linear regression used to calculate the titer was based upon a limited
non-zero dataset, thereby affecting the accuracy of the estimate. This would not be an
issue at therapeutic antibody titers.
Importantly, the levels of IgG and IgM antibodies to specific viral proteins in the receptor
binding domain (RBD) and spike proteins (S1 and S2) were maintained following
treatment. These antibodies have been shown to have high virus neutralizing capacity.
Robbiani et al. [19] demonstrated that despite variations in the levels of overall
neutralizing antibodies in donors of convalescent plasma, the presence of these specific
subsets of antibodies with potent antiviral activity correlated with improved clinical
outcomes in patients receiving the convalescent plasma products. The data implies that
maintenance of the level of these subsets of antibodies may correlate with clinical
effectiveness more directly than measure of overall neutralizing antibody levels.
CCP is the most readily available source of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and its use
has been widely embraced as a treatment for COVID-19 while other antiviral therapies
and vaccines are in development and can be widely deployed. The ability to safely
utilize convalescent plasma in these settings, however, depends on the safety of the
product collected from donors who may have experienced a period of immune
compromise during acute phases of the disease. Exposure to a variety of transfusiontransmitted diseases during this period or reactivation of latent disease could introduce
additional risk into the use of such products for therapeutic applications. PRT treatment

of CCP may be seen as a prudent safety measure to mitigate the risk of possible coinfections known to be transmissible by transfusion. The ability to limit the risk of
transfusion-transmitted co-infections is of particular importance in areas having a high
prevalence of endemic disease, as is the case in many resource-limited settings. Local
collection of CCP in these environments may be challenged by the need for apheresis
infrastructure and cold chain requirements [33], though success in establishing a CP
supply chain to support an EVD clinical trial in Guinea through the collaboration of
international research consortia, government agencies, charitable foundations, and
blood establishments has been described [34]. Since scale-up of such a system to
serve the needs of the broader population for the COVID-19 pandemic is likely not
feasible, whole blood (WB)-derived CCP or perhaps even convalescent WB may be
more plausible where resources are limited. There is precedent for efficacious use of
convalescent WB against EVD, and WB collection is far simpler to than plasmapheresis
[35]. PRT systems to treat WB are available or in development, including the R+UV
PRT system used to treat CCP in this study [36]. Although the preservation of antibody
function in R+UV-treated WB was not evaluated in this study, R+UV treatment effects
on plasma coagulation factors are similar to those reported herein [37].
Limitations of this study include the small sample size and the generally low anti-SARSCoV-2 titers in the CCP units. In an Emergency Use Authorization for the use of CCP to
treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the United States Food and Drug Administration
defined high-titer CCP to be units with a signal-to-cutoff value of 12 or greater when
tested by the Ortho VITROS SARS-CoV-2 IgG test, which corresponds to an ID50 titer
cutoff of 250 using a SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay similar to the PRNT [38]. The six
CCP units evaluated in this study were collected specifically for research at a time when
blood centers were urgently calling for therapeutic CCP donations. It is possible that the
donors providing research CCP units were unable to donate therapeutic units due to low
antibody titers or other donor deferral factors. Despite the low titers, the various
antibody assays performed in this study consistently demonstrated stability between
pre- and post-treatment samples, whether testing for retention, epitope binding, or
neutralizing activity.

Conclusions
With the worldwide need for treatment options to address the COVID-19 pandemic,
CCP is an expedient therapeutic option that can be implemented globally, whether in
resource-rich or resource-limited environments. The addition of PRT may be warranted
to address possible co-infections in regions experiencing a high prevalence of endemic
transfusion-transmissible diseases, but conservation of the passive immunity conveyed
through CCP must be ensured. Based upon this small study there is no indication that
R+UV PRT treatment compromises SARS-CoV-2 nAb function in COVID-19
convalescent plasma.
