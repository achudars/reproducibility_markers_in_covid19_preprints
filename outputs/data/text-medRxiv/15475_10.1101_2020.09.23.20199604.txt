ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND
The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory

4

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might be controlled by an efficacious vaccine. Multiple

5

vaccines are in development, but no efficacious vaccine is currently available.

6

8

METHODS
We designed a multi-center phase 1/2a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical

9

study to assesses the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S, a non-

10

replicating adenovirus 26 based vector expressing the stabilized pre-fusion spike (S) protein of

11

SARS-CoV-2. Ad26.COV2.S was administered at a dose level of 5x1010 or 1x1011 viral particles

12

(vp) per vaccination, either as a single dose or as a two-dose schedule spaced by 56 days in healthy

13

adults (18-55 years old; cohort 1a & 1b; n= 402 and healthy elderly >65 years old; cohort 3;

14

n=394). Vaccine elicited S specific antibody levels were measured by ELISA and neutralizing

15

titers were measured in a wild-type virus neutralization assay (wtVNA). CD4+ T-helper (Th)1 and

16

Th2, and CD8+ immune responses were assessed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS).

17
18

RESULTS

19

We here report interim analyses after the first dose of blinded safety data from cohorts 1a, 1b and

20

3 and group unblinded immunogenicity data from cohort 1a and 3. In cohorts 1 and 3 solicited

21

local adverse events were observed in 58% and 27% of participants, respectively. Solicited

22

systemic adverse events were reported in 64% and 36% of participants, respectively. Fevers

23

occurred in both cohorts 1 and 3 in 19% (5% grade 3) and 4% (0% grade 3), respectively, were

24

mostly mild or moderate, and resolved within 1 to 2 days after vaccination. The most frequent

25

local adverse event (AE) was injection site pain and the most frequent solicited AEs were fatigue,

26

headache and myalgia. After only a single dose, seroconversion rate in wtVNA (50% inhibitory

27

concentration - IC50) at day 29 after immunization in cohort 1a already reached 92% with GMTs

28

of 214 (95% CI: 177; 259) and 92% with GMTs of 243 (95% CI: 200; 295) for the 5x1010 and

29

1x1011vp dose levels, respectively. A similar immunogenicity profile was observed in the first 15

30

participants in cohort 3, where 100% seroconversion (6/6) (GMTs of 196 [95%CI: 69; 560]) and

31

83% seroconversion (5/6) (GMTs of 127 [95% CI: <58; 327]) were observed for the 5x1010 or

32

1x1011 vp dose level, respectively. Seroconversion for S antibodies as measured by ELISA (ELISA

33

Units/mL) was observed in 99% of cohort 1a participants (GMTs of 528 [95% CI: 442; 630) and

695 (95% CI: 596; 810]), for the 5x1010 or 1x1011 vp dose level, respectively, and in 100% (6/6

35

for both dose levels) of cohort 3 with GMTs of 507 (95% CI: 181; 1418) and 248 (95% CI: 122;

36

506), respectively. On day 14 post immunization, Th1 cytokine producing S-specific CD4+ T cell

37

responses were measured in 80% and 83% of a subset of participants in cohort 1a and 3,

38

respectively, with no or very low Th2 responses, indicative of a Th1-skewed phenotype in both

39

cohorts. CD8+ T cell responses were also robust in both cohort 1a and 3, for both dose levels.

40

CONCLUSIONS

41

The safety profile and immunogenicity after only a single dose are supportive for further clinical

42

development of Ad26.COV2.S at a dose level of 5x1010 vp, as a potentially protective vaccine

43

against COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION

46

The first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory virus

47

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.1, 2 Since then,

48

the virus has infected millions of people globally. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can result in a range

49

of clinical manifestations, varying from asymptomatic infection to severe acute respiratory distress

50

and death. To halt this pandemic, and to stop the pressure on health care systems and the negative

51

effects on the global economy, efficacious COVID-19 vaccines are urgently needed.

52

Several vaccine candidates are currently in different stages of development.3–6 We have developed

53

Ad26.COV2.S, that is based on Janssen’s replication incompetent adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26)

54

vector, and a stabilized SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein. This candidate was selected based on its

55

immunogenicity and manufacturability profile.7 The Ad26 vector is also used for our Ebola

56

vaccine, and RSV, HIV and Zika vaccine candidates and Ad26-based vaccines are generally well

57

tolerated and highly immunogenic.10

58

We recently reported that a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S elicited strong immune responses in

59

rhesus macaques, and upon challenge with SARS-CoV-2, none of the vaccinated animals had

60

detectable viral load (VL) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and only one out of six had transient

61

and low VL in the nose.5 Protective efficacy strongly correlated with the presence of virus

62

neutralizing activity in serum of the animals. In addition, we demonstrated that Ad26.COV2.S

63

provided protective immunity in a Syrian golden hamster severe disease model.11

64

These preclinical data supported the start of a Phase 1/2a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-

65

controlled clinical study to assesses the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of

66

Ad26.COV2.S in one- or two-dose (8-week interval) schedules with 5x1010 or 1x1011 viral

67

particles (vp) per vaccination in adults 18–55 or >65 years of age. Here we report interim blinded

68

safety and reactogenicity data as well as group unblinded immunogenicity data obtained during

69

the first 4 weeks after the first vaccination. Based on these results, we have initiated a Phase 3

70

study that will evaluate the efficacy of a single vaccination of 5x1010 vp of Ad26.COV2.S (Trial

71

Number: NCT04505722).

METHODS

77

STUDY DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS

78

We are performing a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1/2a trial

79

to evaluate safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S at 5x1010 or 1x1011 vp,

80

administered intramuscularly (IM) as single-dose or two-dose schedules, 8 weeks apart, in healthy

81

adults 18–55 years of age (cohort 1a (target n=375; interim safety and immunogenicity results post

82

dose 1 reported here) and cohort 1b (target n=25; interim safety results post dose 1 reported here))

83

and >65 years of age (cohort 3 (target n=375; interim post dose 1 safety on full cohort reported

84

here, as well as interim immunogenicity of first 15 participants that were 65–75 years of age)).

85

Enrollment of Cohort 2 will start later and will allow us to collect additional safety and

86

immunogenicity data (see Supplementary Table 1 for details on cohort 2). Overview of the clinical

87

trial design is given in Table 1 and in the flow chart in Figure 1.

88

Ad26.COV2.S is a recombinant, replication-incompetent Ad26 vector12 encoding the full length

89

and stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S protein7 derived from the first clinical isolate of the Wuhan strain

90

(Wuhan, 2019, whole genome sequence NC_045512). The study is performed at multiple clinical

91

sites in Belgium and the United States. A list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided at

92

ClinicalTrials.gov (Trial registration number: NCT04436276). All participants were screened for

93

COVID-19 by the collection of nasal samples for PCR, which, if positive, would exclude them,

94

and by locally available serological assays for detection of previous infection with SARS-CoV-2

95

with a maximum of 25 seropositive participants allowed between Cohort 1a and Cohort 3. The

96

study was reviewed and approved by local ethics committees (Comité d’Ethique Hospitalo-

97

Facultaire Sain-Luc, Université Catholique de Louvain on July 16, 2020) and institutional review

98

boards (IRB) (approval by Advarra IRB on June 29 and July 10, 2020, for New Orleans Center for

99

Clinical Research and Optimal Research sites, respectively). All participants provided written

100

informed consent before enrollment.

101
102

RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING

103

We randomly assigned 405 eligible participants 18–55 years of age and 405 participants >65 years

104

of age to receive one or two vaccinations with either a 5x1010 or 1x1011 vp dose level of vaccine,

105

or placebo (1:1:1:1:1 per age group): 5x1010vp/5x1010vp; 5x1010vp/placebo; 1x1011vp /1x1011vp;

106

1x1011vp/placebo; or placebo/placebo for the first and second dose, respectively (Figure 1).

107

Randomization was done by an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) and stratified by site

108

using randomly permuted blocks. Participants and investigators remain blinded at individual

109

participant level throughout the study. Vaccine and placebo were provided in masked identical

110

syringes. Sponsor and statisticians were group-unblinded for the interim analysis when all

111

participants completed the day 29 visit or discontinued earlier. Safety results are presented here in

112

a blinded manner in order to prevent accidental unblinding.

113
114

ENDPOINTS

115

Endpoints to support the primary objectives of safety and reactogenicity of each dose schedule

116

were adverse events (AEs) for 28 days after each vaccination, local and systemic reactogenicity

117

for 7 days after each vaccination, and serious adverse events (SAEs) throughout the study. AEs

118

were graded according to FDA Guidance document “Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult

119

and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials”. The secondary

120

endpoint was humoral immune response to the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 as demonstrated by

121

Spike-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and by neutralizing titers against

122

wild type SARS-CoV-2 in a wtVNA, and cellular immune responses as measured by intracellular

123

cytokine staining (ICS) after stimulation with S peptide pools.

124
125

PROCEDURES

126

Participants received intramuscular (IM) injections of 5x1010 vp, 1x1011 vp Ad26.COV2.S or

127

placebo (0.9% saline) in a 1 mL volume in the deltoid muscle at Day 1. Solicited AEs were

128

collected on diary cards for 7 days post vaccination, unsolicited AEs for 28 days after vaccination

129

and SAEs throughout the course of the study. Safety data are included up to the cut-off dates of 27

130

August 2020 (cohort 1) and 7 September 2020 (cohort 3). Baseline seropositivity was assessed by

131

local clinical assays, and blood samples for serum chemistry, hematology, and for immune

132

responses were and will be collected at several timepoints throughout the study; urine samples for

133

pregnancy testing were collected before vaccination.

134

At baseline and on Day 29, Spike (S)-specific binding antibodies were measured by ELISA.

135

Seropositivity was defined as a titer >50.3 EU/mL. SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralizing antibody

136

titers were measured in a microneutralization wtVNA using the Victoria/1/2020 SARS-CoV-2

137

strain at Public Health England (PHE). Seropositivity in the wtVNA was defined as an IC50 titer

138

>58. SARS-CoV-2 S-specific T-cell responses were measured at baseline and on Day 15 by ICS

139

using two pools of S peptide pools of 15mers overlapping by 11 amino acids. A Th1 response was

140

characterized by CD4+ T cells expressing IFN-γ and/or IL-2 and not IL-4, IL-5 and/or IL13; a Th2

141

response was characterized by CD4+ T cells expressing IL-4, IL-5 and/or IL-13 and CD40L by

142

CD4+ T cells. All assays were conducted in a blinded fashion and are described in detail in the

143

Appendix.

144
145

STATISTICAL METHODS

146

This study was designed to assess safety and immunogenicity. Safety data were analyzed

147

descriptively in the full analysis set and immunogenicity data were analyzed in the per protocol

148

immunogenicity population. SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S)-binding antibody titers expressed as ELISA

149

Unit per milliliters (EU/mL), and neutralizing antibody titers in the wtVNA, expressed as the

150

reciprocal serum dilution neutralizing 50% of the test virus dose (50% inhibitory concentration

151

[IC50]), are displayed on a log10 scale and described using geometric mean titers (GMT) and 95%

152

confidence intervals (95% CIs). For both assays, seroconversion was defined as having an antibody

153

titer above the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) post vaccination if the baseline titer was below

154

the LLOQ, or a 4-fold increase over baseline post vaccination if the baseline titer was above the

155

LLOQ. ICS responses were described as percentage of total CD4+ or CD8+ T cell population.

156

Sample positivity was determined with a one-sided Fisher’s exact test comparing non-stimulated

157

versus S peptide stimulated wells. LLOQ was 0.022% and non-quantifiable values were imputed

158

to LLOQ/2. Th1/Th2 ratio was calculated if the Th1 and/or Th2 responses were positive and above

159

2xLLOQ. If the Th1 or Th2 response from a participant was not fulfilling these criteria, the

160

Th1/Th2 ratio was considered >1 if a Th2 response could not be measured and <1 if a Th1 response

161

could not be measured.

RESULTS

165

STUDY PARTICIPANTS

166

Screening of participants started July 13, 2020, first vaccination of cohort 1a participants (age 18–

167

55) was initiated on July 22, 2020 and completed on August 4, 2020, and in cohort 1b participants

168

initiated on July 29, 2020 and completed on August 7, 2020. 575 volunteers were screened, of

169

whom 380 were enrolled in cohort 1a (377 vaccinated) and 28 were screened and 25 enrolled in

170

cohort 1b (25 vaccinated; Figure 1A). Seven (1.7%) participants were seropositive for SARS-CoV-

171

2 at screening, seropositivity rate for Ad26 will be reported later. Vaccinations of cohort 3

172

participants (age >65) were initiated on August 3, 2020 and first vaccinations were completed on

173

August 24, 2020. 660 volunteers were screened, of whom 405 were enrolled and 403 were

174

vaccinated (at the time of database extract, safety and reactogenicity data was available for 394

175

vaccinated participants; Figure 1B). Immunogenicity results of only the first 15 participants of

176

cohort 3 were available at time of this publication.

177

Baseline characteristics were broadly comparable across groups (Table 2).

178
179

VACCINE SAFETY AND REACTOGENICITY OF Ad26.COV2.S

180

Blinded safety data from cohort 1a, 1b and 3 were collected and analyzed. Solicited AEs were

181

collected on diary cards for 7 days post vaccination, unsolicited AEs for 28 days after vaccination

182

and SAEs throughout the course of the study. The study is ongoing, and the second immunization

183

of the primary regimen will not be completed at the time of this submission. To ensure the

184

participants and the investigators evaluating the participants remain blinded in this study until the

185

last dose of the primary vaccination regimen is given, the safety data are presented without group

186

unblinding in this interim report.

187

In cohorts 1a and 1b the investigator’s assessment of reactogenicity is available for 402

188

participants, of whom 288 (72%) participants have reported solicited AEs (Table 3). Solicited local

189

AEs were reported in 235 (58%) participants – mostly grade 1/grade 2. Three participants reported

190

grade 3 pain/tenderness. The most frequent AE was injection site pain. Solicited systemic AEs

191

were reported for 258 (64%) participants, mostly grade 1/grade 2, with grade 3 systemic AEs

192

reported for 46 (11%) participants. The most frequent AEs were fatigue, headache and myalgia.

193

Fever was reported in 76 (19%) participants, with grade 3 fever reported in 22 (5%) participants.

194

All fevers occurred within 2 days of immunization and resolved within 1 to 2 days. Of the

195

participants who experienced grade 1 or 2 fevers, 83% utilized antipyretics at the onset of

196

symptoms. 91% of the participants who experienced grade 3 fevers utilized antipyretics at the

197

onset of symptoms. Overall, 98 participants have reported unsolicited AEs with 12 reporting grade

198

3 AEs (Table 4).

199

In cohort 3, at the time of database extract, investigator’s assessment of reactogenicity is available

200

for 394 participants, of whom 183 (46%) participants have reported solicited AEs (Table 3).

201

Solicited local AEs were reported in 108 (27%) participants, most of which were grade 1/Grade 2,

202

with one participant reporting grade 3 swelling and erythema. The most frequent AE was injection

203

site pain. Solicited systemic AEs were reported in 140 (36%) participants, most of which were

204

grade 1/grade 2, with three participants reporting grade 3 AEs. The most frequent AEs were

205

headache, fatigue and myalgia. Mild or moderate fevers of grade 1 or 2 were reported in 14 (4%)

206

of participants only one of which was a grade 2. There were no high or other fevers that restricted

207

daily living activities (grade 3) reported in cohort 3. Overall, 46 (12%) participants have reported

208

unsolicited AEs. Four (1%) participants have reported unsolicited grade 3 AEs.

209

No grade 4 AEs, solicited or unsolicited, were reported in any cohort.

210

No participant discontinued the study due to an AE. There were two SAEs: one hypotension judged

211

by the investigator to not be vaccine related because of a past history of recurrent hypotension, and

212

one participant with fever who was hospitalized overnight because of suspicion of COVID-19, wo

213

recovered within 12 hours, the fever was subsequently judged by the investigator to be vaccine

214

related. For details see supplementary material.

215

While reactogenicity was acceptable in all groups, there was a trend for higher reactogenicity with

216

the higher vaccine dose (data not shown) and with younger age. This will be reported in more

217

detail upon group unblinding of the data.

218
219
220

IMMUNOGENICITY OF Ad26.COV2.S

221

Immunogenicity data for this interim analysis were unblinded by dose level. Antibodies against a

222

stabilized SARS-CoV-2 full length Spike protein were measured by ELISA. In cohort 1a, 94%

223

and 98% of the participants that received the 5x1010 and 1x1011 vp dose, respectively, at baseline

224

had EU/mL GMTs to SARS-CoV-2 S protein below the LLOQ. By Day 29 after vaccination,

225

GMTs had increased to respectively 528 (95% CI: 442; 630) and 695 (95% CI: 596; 810), with

99% seroconversion in each dose group (Figure 2A). Of the cohort 1a participants who were

227

seropositive at baseline, 7 out of 8 and 2 out of 3 demonstrated the preset criterion of a 4-fold

228

increase in binding antibody titer to be considered a vaccine responder, for the 5x1010 and 1x1011

229

vp dose level groups, respectively. The initial 15 enrolled participants in cohort 3 were

230

seronegative at baseline and had seroconverted by Day 29 post vaccination with GMTs of 507

231

(95% CI: 181; 1418) and 248 (95% CI: 122; 506), for the 5x1010 and 1x1011 vp dose level group,

232

respectively. GMTs of 899 were observed in the human convalescent serum (HCS) panel used in

233

this study, with an overlap in the 95% CI of the GMT for both dose level in each cohort.

234

In a subset of participants (n=50) for each of the 5x1010 and 1x1011 vp dose level group, SARS-

235

CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers were measured by wtVNA. In cohort 1a, GMTs <LLOQ at

236

baseline for both dose groups had increased to IC50 GMTs of 214 (95% CI: 177; 259) and 243

237

(95% CI: 200; 295) for the 5x1010 and 1x1011 vp group, respectively, by Day 29. Similar results

238

were observed in the first 15 participants of cohort 3, with a GMT <LLOQ at baseline that had

239

increased to GMTs of 196 (95% CI: 69; 560) and 127 (95% CI: <LLOQ; 327) for the 5x1010 and

240

1x1011 vp group, respectively, by Day 29 (Figure 2B). For comparison, a GMT of 522 was

241

measured in the HCS panel used in this analysis, with an overlap in the 95% CI of the GMT

242

between HCS panel and both dose groups and cohorts. Several serum samples from trial

243

participants reached the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ = 640) for the vaccine sample

244

analysis run and are currently being reanalyzed at higher dilution, which will raise the overall

245

GMT for each dose level. At Day 29 post vaccination, 98% (97/99) of participants in cohort 1a

246

were positive for neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, independent of vaccine dose level

247

that was given. The seroconversion rate at day 29 was 92% for both the 5x1010 and 1x1011 vp

248

group in cohort 1a and, 100% (6/6) and 83% (5/6) for the 5x1010 and 1x1011 vp group in cohort 3.

249

Importantly, in cohort 1a, a total of 82% and 94% of participants in the 5x1010 and 1x1011 vp

250

group, respectively, reached titers greater than 100, indicative of a robust response induced in the

251

vast majority of the participants after a single vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. The wtVNA and

252

ELISA titers as measured in cohort 1a samples highly correlated, with a Spearman correlation of

253

0.86 (p<0.001, data not shown). Data from a pseudovirus expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein

254

neutralization assay are pending and will be included in the full publication of our post dose 1

255

interim analysis.

257

SARS-CoV-2 S-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were characterized in a subset of study

258

participants at baseline and 15 days post vaccination. Previous studies with SARS-CoV and

259

MERS-CoV vaccines in preclinical models have suggested an association between a Th2 skewed

260

CD4+ T cell response with vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD).13–15 To

261

explore this theoretical risk of VAERD here, we assessed CD4+ Th1 and Th2 responses induced

262

by Ad26.COV2.S. Following stimulation with peptides covering the whole S protein, median

263

CD4+ Th1 responses increased from undetectable at baseline to a median of 0.08% (95% CI: 0.05;

264

0.16) and 0.11% (95% CI: 0.07; 0.16) 15 days post vaccination for the 5x1010 and 1x1011 vp group,

265

respectively, in cohort 1a participants, and from non-detectable at baseline to a median of 0.36%

266

(95% CI: 0.15; 0.89) and 0.13% (95% CI: 0.04; 0.50), respectively, in the first participants of

267

cohort 3 (Figure 2C). In cohort 1a, 76% (95% CI: 65; 86) and 83% (95% CI: 73; 91) of participants

268

had detectable Th1 responses for recipients of the 5x1010 and 1x1011 vp dose levels, respectively,

269

and in the first 15 participants of cohort 3, 100% (95% CI: 54; 100) and 67% (95% CI: 22; 96),

270

respectively. Only one participant in the 5x1010 vp group in cohort 1a had a detectable Th2

271

response. However, the Th1/Th2 ratio for this participant was 28.9, indicative of a Th1-skewed

272

phenotype. In all other participants that had measurable Th1 and/or Th2 responses, the Th1/Th2

273

ratio ranged from 1.0 to 68.5. Overall, these data indicate that Ad26.COV2.S induced Th1-skewed

274

responses in both age groups, suggestive for a low risk of VAERD.

275
276

S-specific CD8+ T cell responses were identified by the expression of IFN-γ and/or IL-2 cytokines

277

upon S peptide stimulation (Figure 2D). 15 days post vaccination, the median magnitude of S-

278

specific CD8+ T cell responses was 0.07% (95% CI: 0.03; 0.19) and 0.09% (95% CI: 0.05; 0.19)

279

for the 5x1010 and 1x1011 vp group, respectively, in cohort 1a, and 0.05% (95% CI: 0.02; 0.24)

280

and 0.07% (95% CI:0.02; 0.14), respectively, in cohort 3. 51% (95% CI: 39; 63) and 64% (95%

281

CI: 52; 75) of participants in cohort 1a had a positive CD8+ T cell response to S peptide stimulation

282

for the 5x1010 and 1x1011 vp group, respectively and 33% (95% CI: 4%; 78%) of participants of

283

both dose level groups in cohort 3 had a detectable vaccine induced CD8+ T cell response.

DISCUSSION

287

The interim analysis of our Phase 1/2a study shows that our vaccine candidate Ad26.COV2.S has

288

an acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile and is immunogenic at both a 5x1010 or 1x1011 vp.

289

Although the safety data in this interim report remain blinded, the overall occurrence independent

290

of dose level of solicited systemic AEs of 64% with a 19% fever rate (5% grade 3) in adults aged

291

18 to 55 (Cohort 1a and 1b) stands in contrast to the solicited systemic AEs of 36% with a 4%

292

fever rate (0% grade 3), found in the participants ≥ 65 years of age. This finding suggests that the

293

vaccine candidate is less reactogenic in older adults. The safety profile is acceptable at any age

294

given the seriousness of the disease the vaccine can potentially protect against and the nature of

295

the pandemic, especially in the elderly which is the most vulnerable population to COVID-19. We

296

did observe a trend for higher reactogenicity with the higher vaccine dose. More details on the

297

safety and reactogenicity profile will be provided immediately upon group unblinding of the study,

298

after vaccine dosing in cohort 1a and 3 has been completed.

299
300

A single dose of Ad26.COV2.S elicited strong humoral responses in the vast majority of vaccine

301

recipients. S-binding antibody titers as measured by ELISA, increased from baseline to Day 29

302

post vaccination in 99% of the participants in cohort 1a and 100% of the first participants in cohort

303

3, independent of the vaccine dose level that was given. Similarly, high response rates were

304

observed in a wtVNA. 29 days post vaccination, 98% of the participants had detectable

305

neutralizing antibodies. 92% of cohort 1a participants and respectively 6 out of 6, and 5 out of 6

306

recipients of the 5x1010 vp and 1x1011 vp dose level in cohort 3, seroconverted for SARS-CoV-2

307

neutralizing antibodies. In cohort 1a, depending on the dose level, 82% to 94% of the participants

308

had a neutralizing antibody titer above 100.

309
310

The lack of standards and the use of different immune assays by different vaccine developers

311

makes it difficult to compare the performance of COVID-19 vaccine candidates that are currently

312

in development. In addition, the level of immune response required to confer protection is

313

unknown and even the least immunogenic vaccine may still elicit sufficient immunity to be

314

protective. All other COVID-19 vaccines currently in development require two doses while

315

neutralizing antibody responses in all participants reported here were obtained after a single dose

316

of Ad26.COV2.S. The potency of a single vaccination with our Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine

317

candidate is supported by our recently reported study in non-human primates where a single dose

318

provided complete protection against SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lung and near complete

319

protection against viral replication in the nose.5 In this prior preclinical study, all sham vaccinated

320

control animals had detectable virus in both lung and nose for 7–14 days. In vaccinated non-human

321

primates, protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection was correlated with neutralizing antibody

322

titers.

323
324

Our clinical data indicate that Ad26.COV2.S at both dose levels induces a strong neutralizing

325

antibody response in the vast majority of the healthy young adult and older participants. Although

326

only a limited number of participants of cohort 3 were included in the analysis so far, comparable

327

immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S in adults aged 18–55 and adults aged 65–75 as observed here

328

is encouraging for elderly individuals, who are at higher risk for developing severe COVID-19.

329

Compared to COVID-19 human convalescent sera, the levels of binding and neutralizing

330

antibodies induced by Ad26.COV2.S are in the same range for most participants. However, the

331

significance of this comparison is not yet established due to the variability in GMTs in different

332

human convalescent serum panels, likely related to the variability of the composition of these

333

panels. Demographics such as age, disease severity, and time of sampling since disease onset and

334

the number of samples in the panel could have an impact on the GMTs of antibody, making a

335

comparison to GMTs in samples from vaccinated participants arbitrary.16

336
337

Previous experience with certain animal models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccines have

338

raised a theoretical concern of VAERD.13–15 An association between this safety concern and poor

339

neutralizing potency of humoral immunity and Th2-skewed cellular immune responses has been

340

suggested. Here we show that all Ad26.COV2.S elicited CD4+ T cell responses were Th1 skewed

341

with no or very low Th2 responses. Indeed, in all responders, the Th1/Th2 ratio was above 1, in

342

line with previous experience with our Ad26-based vaccine platform (data on file).10 This robust

343

CD4+ Th1 response was accompanied by strong CD8+ T cell responses following vaccination.

344

Robust CD4+ Th1 and CD8+ T cell responses, in addition to strong humoral responses elicited by

345

Ad26.COV2.S minimizes the theoretical risk of VAERD.

346

An efficacious single-dose COVID-19 vaccine would have advantages over a two-dose vaccine in

347

terms of implementation, especially during a pandemic. If a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S protects

348

against SARS.CoV.2 infection or COVID-19, the durability of protection will be important to

349

characterize. Data on the durability of the immune response elicited by a single dose of

350

Ad26.COV2.S as well as on the immune response after a second dose of Ad26.COV2.S will

351

become available from our ongoing Phase 1/2a studies (Table 1). In previous studies with the

352

Ad26-based Zika vaccine, durability of neutralizing antibodies after a single dose, defined as

353

seropositivity, was at least 12 months in 56% of vaccine recipients and a second dose further

354

increased this percentage.10 Obviously, durability of immunity is not only reflected in the

355

maintenance of neutralizing antibody titers but also in the quality of vaccine priming of the

356

immune system resulting in immune memory. To this end, we will study the ability of vaccinated

357

participants in our ongoing Phase 2a study (COV2001) to mount an anamnestic response to a very

358

low dose of vaccine as a surrogate for exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

359
360

The interpretation of the interim analysis presented here for immunogenicity is limited by the

361

relatively small sample size in cohort 3, the short follow-up, and the demographic characteristics

362

of the study population, which may limit the generalizability of our findings. However, additional

363

data will become available soon.

364
365

In conclusion, our interim analysis indicates that a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S, either 5x1010 vp

366

or 1x1011 vp, is safe, well tolerated and highly immunogenic. Based on similar immunogenicity of

367

both dose levels, we have selected the lower dose for further clinical evaluation. In our first Phase

368

3 study that has been initiated in the US, and that will later include sites in Africa, and South and

369

Central America (Trial Number: NCT04505722), we will evaluate the efficacy of a single dose of

370

5x1010 vp of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine candidate. An additional Phase 3 study is planned to assess

371

the efficacy and durability of immunity of a two-dose schedule with 5x1010 vp of the

372

Ad26.COV2.S vaccine.

Legend to Figure 1 Participants were enrolled concurrently at Belgian and US sites. Participants

491

were randomized in parallel in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to one of five vaccination groups to receive one or

492

two IM injections of Ad26.COV2.S at two dose levels of either 5x1010 vp or 1x1011 vp, or placebo.

493

For cohort 1 and 3, in the absence of clinically significant findings 24 hours after the first

494

vaccination was administered to five sentinel participants (two per dose level and one placebo),

495

another ten participants were vaccinated across all groups. Safety data up to Day 28 were then

496

reviewed by an internal data review committee before the remaining participants were randomized.
