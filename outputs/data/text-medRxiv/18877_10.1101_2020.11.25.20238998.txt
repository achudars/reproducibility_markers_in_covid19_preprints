Methodology: Subjects (N=275) with a probable COVID19 diagnosis were classified

35

as follows: Symptomatic with chemosensory dysfunction, symptomatic without

was performed by means of the Venezuelan Olfactory Test and taste test. Nasal swabs

39

and blood samples were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis

40

(RT-PCR) and a rapid diagnostic test to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus and antiviral

41

antibodies, respectively. Patients had access to molecular tests and smell and taste

42

evaluations every 3 to 5 days until they recovered.

43

Results: Out of 44 patients that were positive for RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2: 45.83%

44

had smell and taste disorders and COVID19 symptoms, 23.61% did not have smell or

45

taste disorders, but had COVID19 symptoms, and 30.55% were asymptomatic. Mild

46

hyposmia and hypogeusia account for the most frequent chemosensory disorders

47

accompanying common SARS-CoV-2 symptoms. Time to recover from the

48

chemosensory dysfunction ranges from 3 to 14 days, up to a maximum of 5 weeks,

49

while RT-PCR becomes negative after 21 days and up to 35 days in some cases. The

Venezuelan Olfactory Test and taste test has a 61.68% positive predictive value,

51

45.83% sensitivity, and 68.7% specificity for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Conclusions: Smell and taste disorders are frequent symptoms of SARS-CoV-2

infection, but not a significant predictor of the disease, as compared to the molecular

INTRODUCTION

59

At the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, the smell and taste disorders seem

60

to have some predictive value as to the evolution of the infection (1). Since the

61

beginning of the pandemic, multiple studies have reported a very variable association

62

between the smell and taste dysfunction and the presence of other symptoms that are

63

characteristic of the coronavirus infection (1).

64

The first reports of a multicenter study that grouped clinical data from 12 hospitals, a

65

population of 417 patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, list cough, myalgia and

66

loss of appetite as the most common symptoms; while symptoms associated with

67

otorhinolaryngology-related disorders were facial pain and nasal obstruction in at

68

least 86% of the cases; and there were smell and taste disorders in 88% of the cases.

69

The onset of the smell dysfunction was earlier than any other symptom in 11.8% of

70

the cases (2).

The sudden loss of the sense of smell associated with an increasing number of cases

of coronavirus was reported in the United Kingdom recently; however, the evidence

73

seems to be circumstantial, because it was found as information provided in social

74

media by subjects who had had this symptom in an isolated fashion. The authors

75

reported 9 cases of sudden anosmia without other associated symptoms in the first 3

76

weeks of the onset of the coronavirus. It is worth mentioning that none of these

77

patients was evaluated with a specific test to determine the presence of the disorder

78

(3).

79

More recently, another study carried out at Hospital L. Sacco in Milan, Italy with 59

80

of the 88 patients of the hospital, established that 33.9% had at least one smell and/or

81

taste disorder and 18.6% had both. In this group of patients, 20.3% had smell

82

symptoms before they were admitted to the hospital and 13.5% during their stay (4).

83

The presence of smell alterations associated with a viral infection is not new in

84

otorhinolaryngology; many viruses may cause olfactory dysfunction due to an

85

inflammatory process of the nasal mucosa and the development of rhinorrhea. Among

86

the viral agents associated with these alterations are rhinovirus, parainfluenza,

87

Epstein-Bar, and some coronavirus (4,5). However, the fact that olfactory dysfunction

88

associated with SARS-CoV-2 is not essentially related to the onset of rhinorrhea and

89

nasal obstruction suggests a different action mechanism. So far, the physiopathology

90

of smell and taste disorders in the SARS-CoV-2 infection is still under scrutiny.

91

One of the most relevant evidences of the action mechanism of coronavirus was

92

reported as a result of an investigation of the olfactory mucosa of mice and analysis of

93

RNA sequences of humans. It found that the 2 genes that express the information for

94

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the host transmembrane serine protease

95

family member II (TMPRSS2) receptors involved in the entry of COV-2 into the cell

96

are expressed in the cells of the respiratory epithelium of the nasal cavity, support

97

cells, Bowman´s glands, microvilli, and stem cells of the olfactory mucosa, but not in

98

the olfactory sensory neurons. This suggests that the olfactory damage mechanism is

99

non-neural in nature. As to the damage to the sense of taste, it appears to be directly

100

on the taste receptor and as the result of the production of cytokines that irritate the

101

trigeminal and glossopharyngeal nerves that transmit sensory signals to the central

102

nervous system (6).

103

Netland et al. found that, in certain transgenic mice, there was an extensive replication

104

of the virus in the brain, with certain regional differences, and that this brain infection,

105

in turn, was an important factor in the aspiration pneumonia seen in some of the mice

studied. A generalized neuronal infection appeared after intranasal inoculation, which

107

suggests that the entryway for the infection could be through the olfactory bulb. This

108

raises questions about the possible effects of coronavirus on patients infected with

109

SARS-CoV-2 in the future (7).

110

A vast majority of initial reports on smell and taste dysfunction related to coronavirus

111

infection were based on results from patient surveys, without corroborating the

112

diagnosis through psychophysical evaluation of chemosensory dysfunction. Patients

113

were not followed up systematically until recovery, nor was the relationship proven

114

by means of diagnostic tests, such as the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, or rapid

115

diagnostic tests. These factors may have led to an overestimation of the symptom as

116

predictive factor of the disease. Similarly, using the smell test without adjusting it to

117

the population under analysis could result in some false positives and, consequently,

118

an overestimation of chemosensory dysfunction diagnostics.

119

All of the above motivated us to carry out an investigation the distinctive nature and

120

main objective of which was to determine the predictive value of smell and taste tests

121

in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and its relationship with other diagnostic

122

tests, such as SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test and the rapid diagnostic test, as well as the

123

follow up and comprehensive observation of the patient’s recovery from the

124

coronavirus infection. The objective of this study is to determine whether smell and

125

taste disorders are an early and more sensitive biomarker than the RT-PCR test for

126

diagnosing the SARS-CoV-2infection.

127

MATERIALS AND METHODS

128

Population

129

A sample of 275 individuals was selected from a population of 525 subjects examined

130

between March and August 2020 (Table 1). The following were collected for all

131

subjects at the beginning of the study protocol: 1. Full clinical record, including age,

132

gender, epidemiologic background on the basis of travel and contact with positive

133

cases, questions about suggestive respiratory signs and other symptoms, presence or

134

not of smell and/or taste disorders. 2. General otorhinolaryngology (ORL) physical

135

examination, Venezuelan Olfactory Test (VOT), and Basic Taste Test evaluation . 3.

136

Nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR molecular analysis and detection

137

of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by rapid diagnostic test (RDT).

138

In this study, patients were followed-up every 3 to 5 days, to verify their overall

139

clinical condition. In addition, smell and taste tests were carried out, blood samples

were drawn to perform RDTs, and nasopharyngeal swabs for RT-PCR tests, until they

141

met the recovery criterion. The recovery criterion is met when one of the following

142

conditions is fulfilled: 1.-The relative smell and taste test score is at the highest level

143

and the RT-PCR test is negative. 2. - It has been established that there is no permanent

144

smell or taste disorder.

145

Clinical assessment

146

The clinical assessment of patients with probable COVID19 diagnostic followed the

147

guideline suggested by the National Institute of Health of the United States of

148

America (NIH-USA SARS-CoV-2 assessment guidelines). The level of organ

149

compromise is defined as mild or moderate if individuals present with fever, cough,

150

sore throat, general malaise, headache, myalgia, anosmia, ageusia, and diarrhea.

151

When it is a mild condition, patients do not complain of shortness of breath, have

152

more than 94% oxygen saturation, and there is no clinical evidence of respiratory

153

disease, while in the Moderate there is clinical and imaging evidence of mild

154

respiratory disease. The condition is defined as Severe in individuals with less than

155

94% oxygen saturation and respiratory rate at 30 respirations per minute in adults, in

156

addition to more than 50% pulmonary infiltrates or a PaO2/FIO2 ratio lower than 300

157

mmHg. In the case of Critical disease, there is respiratory distress which requires

158

mechanic ventilation, as well as multiple organ failure, septic shock and vasopressor

159

treatment.

160

Venezuelan Olfactory Test (VOT) and Taste Test

161

The VOT is a smell test that was adapted for Venezuela from the smell identification

162

test of the University of Pennsylvania (UPSIT) (8). The Venezuelan short test is

163

composed of 2 notebooks with 10 odorants that are commonly recognized by

164

Venezuelans and which were validated during a prior exploratory study (9, 10). The

165

substances are coffee, chocolate, baby cologne, scented talc, liquid detergent, coconut

166

essence, powdered detergent, cinnamon, acetone, and rum. Every time an odorant is

167

examined, the subject must identify the respective smell and discriminate it among the

168

other substances offered and mentioned in addition to the odorant he is expected to

169

identify.

170

On the basis of identification and discrimination of odors presented to patients, the

171

VOT provides a relative grading scale as follows: Normosmia (8-10), mild hyposmia

172

(6-7), moderate hyposmia (5-4), severe hyposmia (2-3), and anosmia (0-1).

173

The taste test consists in recognizing the 5 universally accepted basic tastes, to wit:

sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami (11). One (1) cc of a sample of each taste is

175

placed on the anterior third of the tongue of the patient who has his eyes closed, and

176

after 10 seconds of period, an identification of the sample may occur. If the patient

177

cannot recognize the tastes, he is diagnosed with ageusia, and hypogeusia if the

178

patient recognized up to 4 tastes.

179

Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) to Determine Antibodies Generated to SARS-COV-2

180

virus antigens

181

Diagnostic tests Nº IFU-COVID3-01 (Nhui deep blue Medical Technology co. Batch:

182

20200307) were used to determine IgG/IgM antibodies. This kit uses a recombinant

183

SARS-CoV-2 antigen conjugated with colloidal gold, which can interact with

184

antibodies circulating in blood or in a serum or plasma preparation. The sample is

185

placed on a nitrocellulose (NC) membrane that has been prepared with rat anti-IgM

186

antibodies and human IgG antibodies, and sheep anti-rat polyclonal antibodies. When

187

the sample diffuses in the membrane it may interact with the IgM antibodies adsorbed

188

in it and an aggregate is produced with the coronavirus antigen marked with colloidal

189

gold. This, in turn, is captured by the rat anti-IgM and produces a colored line. If the

190

sample contains IgG antibodies, it forms a compound with the antigen marked with

191

colloidal gold, this compound is captured by the rat anti-human IgG antibody and

192

produces a colored line. When samples contain IgM and IgG at the same time, there

193

will be 2 lines. When there are no IgM or IgG antibodies in the sample, there is only

194

the quality control line and the result is negative.

195

Sample Collection for RT-PCR Testing for SARS-CoV-2 detection

196

Samples were obtained from patients by nasopharyngeal swab strictly following the

197

biosecurity protocol. Then, they were placed in YOCON viral transport medium,

198

batch Y25200101, and kept at a temperature between 2 and 8o C until they reached the

199

reference laboratory. Samples collected for RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2

200

detection were processed by the Virology Service of the “Rafael Rangel” National

201

Hygiene Institute of the Ministry of the People’s Power for Health in Caracas,

202

Venezuela.

203

Ethical Approval

204

Collection and analysis of data were approved by the Bioethical committee of the

205

“Carlos Arvelo” University Military Hospital of Caracas. All studies were conducted

206

in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and all participants signed an

207

informed consent. The current study included participants for which there was full

information on multiple SARS-CoV-2 measures and key outcomes, including

209

psychosocial factors, chronic medical conditions, and socio-demographic factors.

210

Statistical Analysis

211

Descriptive statistics was used in the analysis by age group and type of chemosensory

212

impairment. The predictive value, sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests used

213

were calculated on the basis of the Wilson score method using the OpenEpi, version 3

214

software. Diagnostic Test Open code Calculator.

215

Χ2-Square tests were used to find the most frequent type of symptom in the SARS-

216

CoV-2 infection. We asked whether there is a relationship between the SARS-CoV-2

217

infection and the presence or absence of symptoms; and to evaluate the relationship

218

among type of olfactory disorder, age and gender. In the case of the association

219

between two variables, when the result of the

220

say, the variables were dependent on, or associated to one another, a standardized

221

residuals analysis was carried out. This analysis allows to determine in a significant

222

manner which cell or frequency contributed more to the rejection of the null

223

hypothesis in the

224

deviated significantly from the expected value. Any deviation value higher than ±1.96

225

from the normal distribution is considered significant.

226

Pearson’s

227

differences in two categorical variables.

228

Χ2-Square tests and standardized residuals analyses were carried out in R with the

229

chisq.test function of the stats. package (12).

230

RESULTS

231

The most frequent age group among study subjects was the 25 - 38 years old, and

232

there were more male (54.90 %) than female (45.09 %) subjects; average age of the

233

population was 33.63 ± 5 years old (Table 2). In Venezuela, the first possible SARS-

234

CoV-2 infection cases were reported in March (Figure 1). Initially, the disease was

235

observed in a group of 28 patients with smell and taste disorders, although only 1 of

236

them was confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 by means of the RT-PCR test. Then,

237

starting in May, the number of individuals positive for SARS-CoV-2 was increasing

238

in parallel with the onset of smell and taste disorders; and finally, in the month of

239

August, a significant number of patients with smell and taste disorders also tested

240

positive for coronavirus infection by means of the RT-PCR test.

241

The observation of a higher incidence of olfactory and taste disorders together with a

Χ2-Square test was positive, that is to

Χ2-Square test. Additionally, it allows to find out which cells

Χ2-Square test and Fisher’s exact test were used to evaluate between-group

242

positive molecular diagnostic suggested that the dysfunction of these senses could

243

happen before or to a greater extent than the expression of viral genes evidenced by

244

the RT-PCR test, and this could imply that the physiology of the chemosensory

245

system is more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

246

To assess this observation, molecular tests were performed on the 275 subjects who

247

had gotten smell and taste tests. It was found that 144 subjects were RT-PCR+ for

248

SARS-CoV-2 while 131 were RT-PCR- for SARS-CoV-2. In the RT-PCR+ group,

249

there were more SyMVOTT+ (66/144; 45.83%) subjects than SyMVOTT- (34/144;

250

23.61%) or ASYM (44/144; 30.55%). In contrast, among the 131 patients that tested

251

negative for SARS-CoV-2 in the RT-PCR test, there were more SyMVOTT+ (41/131;

252

31.30%) subjects than SyMVOTT- (27/131; 20.61%), but less than the ASYM

253

(63/131; 48.10%) (Table 3). These results suggest that there are more individuals with

254

olfactory and taste disorders among the COVID19 symptomatic population.

255

The higher number of RT-PCR+ patients with and without olfactory and taste

256

disorders, and with symptoms of the infection indicates that the relative effectiveness

257

of RT-PCR tests in confirming the COVID19 infection is 75%. In contrast, if the large

258

number of PDR- (197/275; 71.63%) individuals in the whole sample is taken into

259

account, the relative effectiveness of this test is 28%. (Table 3). This confirms the

260

little reliability of PDR tests for diagnosing coronavirus infection.

261

The frequency of subjects in the SyMVOTT+, SyMVOTT- and ASYM groups as a

262

function of the presence of chemosensory symptoms and the positive molecular test

263

results was heterogeneous (X2 = 9.19, gl = 2, p < 0.05), which suggests that the type

264

of symptoms and their association with chemosensory dysfunction is different in the

265

case of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is consistent with what was observed in the

266

analysis of standardized residuals, since, in the SARS-CoV-2 infection, the

267

chemosensory dysfunction is very frequent and, in this sample, very few subjects that

268

presented with the disease were asymptomatic (Table 4.1, Figure 1). On the other

269

hand, olfactory and taste disorders are infrequent in the general population (Tables 3

270

and 3.1).

271

Predictive Value of VOTT

272

When the frequency of patients with olfactory and taste disorders that were diagnosed

273

with the VOTT was compared to the RT-PCR tests positive results, the positive

274

predictive value of the VOTT was 61.68%, while the negative predictive value was

275

53.57%. These results suggested that VOTT+ patients had a 0.62 probability of being

RT-PCR+ for SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, the sensitivity and specificity for

277

COVID-19 diagnosis of the Venezuelan Olfactory Test and basic taste test was

278

45.83% and 68.7%, respectively (Table 4). These findings supported that these tests

279

allow to detect olfactory and taste disorders in 46% of healthy individuals and in 69%

280

of patients who were also clinically SARS-CoV-2 positive.

281

SARS-CoV-2 Affectation and Chemosensory dysfunction

282

Coronavirus infection produces different degrees of affectation, as described in the

283

methods. In this research, it was observed that 98.48 % of the 66 subjects (65/66) with

284

chemosensory impairment (VOTT+) had mild clinical signs and 1.51% (1/66)

285

moderate signs (Table 5).

286

Characteristics of VOTT+, SyVOTT +, and SyVOTT- Patients

287

Clinical signs as a consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection are quite variable. The

288

number of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients presenting with chemosensory disorder

289

only (VOTT+) was 18/97 (18.55%). In contrast, there were 48/97 (49.5%) SyVOTT+

290

according to standardized residuals analysis P < 0.05; (Table 6).

291

The group of VOTT+ patients without any other accompanying symptom (no

292

concomitants), who referred olfactory and taste disorder as their only symptom before

293

the molecular diagnostic and before being admitted to the hospital was 18/97

294

(18.55%) (Table 7). When differentiated on the basis of the type of chemosensory

295

dysfunction, 7 presented with olfactory disorder only, 4 of them anosmia, and 3 with

296

mild hyposmia. Combined smell and taste disorders at various degrees were present in

297

10 subjects, and only 1 had hypogeusia. All these findings suggest a disorder

298

variability that may indicate the presence of coronavirus infection and not only the

299

anosmia or the ageusia. In this group of patients, chemosensory disorders were an

300

early biomarker of the coronavirus disease.

301

Chemosensory dysfunction was a symptom in 31.25% of the subjects of the

302

SyVOTT+ group before being admitted to the hospital. In contrast, 68.75% of the

303

patients of the sample that did not declare the disorder before being admitted to the

304

hospital, were positive for olfactory or taste disorder when the VOT and taste test

305

were used. This confirms the need to use a standardized objective taste for detecting

306

the chemosensory disorder during the hospital stay. On the other hand, the onset of

307

the chemosensory dysfunction in the SyVOTT+ group occurred between the 3rd and

308

5th day in 70% of the cases.

309

Other associated symptoms in the SyVOTT+ group vary. Among them, headache,

310

myalgia, arthralgia, shivering, odynophagia, and hyporexia in 48% of patients; fever,

311

headache, and general malaise in 31%, dry cough and chest pain in 8% dyspnea, and

312

only fever or myalgia in 8% and 2%, respectively.

313

Similarly, in the SyVOTT- patients, which accounted for 32.98% of the sample, there

314

was fever, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and shivering in 46.87% of them; headache,

315

arthralgia and myalgia in 15%, as well as chest pain, dyspnea in 15%, rhinorrhea,

316

fever, nasal congestion, and dysphonia in 12.5%; and cough, general malaise, fever,

317

and shivering in 9%. As relates the variety of symptoms in SyVOTT+ and SyVOTT-

318

groups, no differences were observed in the frequency of presentation that would

319

warrant an additional classification in the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

320

Age, Gender and VOTT

321

In this study, when the presence of chemosensory dysfunction in the subjects of the

322

sample was taken into account, the frequency was similar among them regardless

323

gender or age (Table 7). Furthermore, smell and taste disorders combined were

324

present in 40.90% of VOTT+ patients. The severity of the disorder is anosmia and

325

ageusia in 30% of the cases, while mild hyposmia and hypogeusia were observed in

326

59.25% of the cases. The olfactory disorder alone, was present as anosmia (12.12%),

327

severe hyposmia 6.06%, mild hyposmia 25.75%, and moderate hyposmia (6.06%). It

328

may be concluded from the analysis of the sample that the presence of both disorders

329

is the prevailing clinical sign, and of those two, the most frequent olfactory disorder is

330

mild hyposmia (32 patients). At the same time, anosmia was the second olfactory

331

disorder in terms of frequency (17 patients). In contrast, hypogeusia as the only

332

clinical sign is not frequent in coronavirus infection.

333

Time Course of SARS-CoV-2 Grading by Means of VOT

334

The assessment of chemosensory dysfunction as a function of time by means of the

335

Venezuela olfactory test allowed to establish a group of subjects with anosmia 11/31

336

(35.48%) and another with mild hyposmia 15/31 (48.4%) on day 1. The number of

337

individuals positive for mild hyposmia and normosmia in the VOT increased in

338

frequency with time, as follows: day 5, 8/10 (80%); day 7, 17/19 (89.5%); day 10, 8/8

339

(100%); day 14 8/10 (80%); and day 20, 15/16 (93.75%). Between day 5 and day 20,

340

the sense of smell of 66/142 (46.47%) subjects had been restored (normosmia), as

341

evidenced by the VOT test. The average recovery interval was 8 to 10 days, with a

minimum of 3 days and a maximum of 20 (Figures 2A and 2B). Only one patient did

343

not recover the sense of smell during the time of the study.

344

Time Course of SARS-CoV-2 Grading by Means of RT-PCR Test

345

The frequency analysis of the RT-PCR molecular test for SARS-CoV-2 was carried

346

out for all individuals of the protocol in a systematic manner from day 1 to day 34

347

post infection. The viral gene expression was very frequent from day 1 to day 7, as it

348

was present in 47/78 (60.25%) subjects; it decreased between day 10 and 14, and from

349

day 16 to day 20, when it was evident in 15/78 (19.23%) and 11/78 (14.10%)

350

subjects, respectively. Only 3 individuals had a positive RT-PCR test result on day 26

351

and only one did so until day 30. The frequency of VOTT+RT-PCR+ 66/275, and

352

VOTT-RT-PCR+ 78/275 individuals is different from that of VOTT+RT-PCR-

353

41/275, VOTT-RT-PCR- 90/275 subjects (Fisher´s exact test P < 0.0184). The

354

frequency of RT-PCR+ molecular tests is higher between days 1 and 14 and lower

355

between day 16 and 24. It was observed that the maximum time interval for viral gene

356

expression was 21 days (Figure 3).

357

DISCUSSION

358

The recent onset of this SARS-CoV-2 zoonosis in human populations has led to a

359

significant number of studies aimed at understanding the variety of symptoms as part

360

of the etiology of the disease. In the Venezuelan population, the time course of

361

COVID19 has been lagging behind that of other countries, and this may have given

362

time to establish treatment guidelines as a function of the expression of the disease.

363

This study have evaluated the predictive value of a standardized smell test for the

364

unbiased assessment of the sense of smell and taste in individuals with respect to a

365

molecular diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR test. This is an original

366

and innovative study, as it establishes in an objective and recurrent evaluation, by

367

means of a smell test that is standardized for Venezuela and a classical taste test, the

368

evolution of the chemosensory disorder of subjects until the sense of smell and taste

369

are fully restored. Additionally, the viral genes analysis by means of the SARS-CoV-2

370

RT-PCR test and of the anti-coronavirus antibodies was carried out in symptomatic

371

and asymptomatic patients until these had fully recovered.

372

Clinical signs vary in patients with coronavirus infection, and the severity of the

373

disease is determined by shortness of breath, oxygen saturation, pulmonary infiltrates,

374

multiple organ failure, septic shock, and the need to use vasopressors, as defined by

375

the National Institute of Health of the United States of America (NIH-USA SARS11

CoV-2 assessment guidelines).

377

Anosmia and ageusia were otorhinolaryngological and neurological signs of the

378

coronavirus disease. Currently, the physiopathology of anosmia due to COVID-19 is

379

apparently better understood; however, there is still the question why patients with

380

moderate to severe COVID-19 infection have less olfactory affectation. Findings of

381

this study show that 98% of patients with smell and taste disorders had mild

382

COVID19. These results are in agreement with a recent report of self-described

383

olfactory dysfunction in mild forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection that did not require

384

hospitalization (13). For instance, the chemosensory dysfunction established in this

385

study by means of self-evaluation underestimates the incidence of this symptom;

386

therefore it would be advisable to examine whether anosmia is less prevalent in more

387

severe forms of the infection and, consequently, the mechanism that leads to the

388

physiopathological process that gives rise to this affectation.

389

The definition of a mild or severe form of SARS-CoV-2 infection may imply there is

390

an immune response with more or less contention power thus leading to a milder or

391

more serious viral infection, respectively. This response in the entryway of the virus

392

may also imply that the progression of the infection depends on the time taken by the

393

virus to move towards the upper or lower airways. Therefore, it is possible that, in the

394

mild forms of the coronavirus infection, a more intense and faster immune response

395

will produce more local inflammation that evolves into inflammatory processes

396

involving the neuroepithelium and olfactory bulb. In contrast, in low intensity late

397

immune responses, patients present with mild symptoms in ears, nose and throat; but

398

later, these could also involve higher and lower airways with respiratory compromise

399

(14, 15).

400

These two hypotheses have not been experimentally corroborated, because results

401

show that patients with severe or critical forms have a higher immunoglobulin

402

concentration in the serum and nasal secretions than patients with mild forms; which

403

additionally makes sense, because the severe respiratory compromise has been

404

justified as being a cytokine storm mechanism.

405

Since the beginning of the pandemic, COVID-19 symptoms reports have been about

406

the respiratory tract affectation, with serious and fatal complications in a certain

407

percentage of cases. The first reports involving a nervous system affectation were

408

associated to a sudden decrease in the sense of smell, sometimes accompanied by a

409

decrease in the sense of taste, which patients recovered from regardless whether they

410

had a positive infection outcome or not. Initial reports were based on telephone

411

interviews or online self-assessments by means of a questionnaire. As a result, the

412

incidence of the chemosensory disorder was 19.4% (2); 64% (16); and 85.6% (15).

413

These findings confirmed the initial observation of Lechien et al. who were the first to

414

mention the sudden loss of the sense of smell in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.

415

Subsequent reports expanded on the vision of this author and confirmed the

416

association between the infection by this virus and the chemosensory disorder. Self-

417

assessment of the senses of smell and taste has been proposed as an index of SARS-

418

CoV-2 transmission that could be of value for projecting the need of hospital care

419

units required for compromised patients (17). However, as it is commonly the case in

420

these smell and taste self-assessment studies, sensitivity and specificity are

421

compromised.

422

Applying standardized tests to SARS-CoV-2 infected patients has allowed to

423

determine the level of involvement of the sensory function in the progression of the

424

viral pathology. In a previous study, an UPSIT test for the Persian population applied

425

to a reduced number of patients in Iran established that the olfactory disorder is

426

variable, as there was a reduced rate of anosmic subjects (25%), while the largest

427

percentage had moderate and severe microsmia (60%). Therefore, it was suggested

428

that this degree of sensitivity was not enough to be able to consider the smell test as

429

an indicator of the progression of the infection (18).

430

The senses of smell and taste form a physiological system that is affected by COVID-

431

19; however, the degree of affectation seems to be mild. This has been shown by the

432

studies carried out using as objective evaluator the chemosensory test of the Clinical

433

Research Center of Connecticut, which has shown, just like Moein et al., findings,

434

that a very small number were anosmic, while most had moderate and mild hyposmia

435

(80%). At the same time, the taste test established that the taste affectation was mild

436

to moderate. All patients maintained a normal degree of discrimination and a

437

subjective overall recovery of 66%; but up to 88% presented with a certain degree of

438

chemosensory disorder (19).

439

In contrast with these results, in this study, the results of several smell and taste tests

440

showed the progressiveness of the disorder and time to recover from the onset of the

441

infection. Contrary to what was seen in prior studies, in our sample, mild hyposmia

442

and anosmia accounted for the highest share with a progressive recovery. The onset of

443

the infection and its evolution allowed to make an evaluation until the recovery of the

444

patient.

445

Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its demonstration by virtue of new

446

technologies have given rise to molecular tests with variable sensitivity and

447

specificity. Findings suggesting an asymptomatic infection in significantly frequent

448

cases of negative RT-PCR test results imply several possibilities, which include that

449

individuals have either not been exposed to the infection or they received a reduced

450

viral load. At the same time, the characteristics of the sample, as a result of collection,

451

storage, preservation, and processing, could also contribute to the high number of

452

negative results (20,21).

453

The time course of the infection, and the effectiveness of molecular tests to prove the

454

infection, suggest an order in the events of infection progression that range from 5 to

455

7 days for the first clinical signs to become evident. The sensitivity of the molecular

456

diagnosis increases in a delayed manner, as a function of the increase in the

457

concentration of viral particles that could reach a maximum level on the 7th day and

458

up to the following 14 days, to then decrease gradually as a result of the immune

459

response of the patient.

460

In contrast, in this study, the RT-PCR molecular test leads to suggest a minimum time

461

of 1 day from the date of admission of the patient to the protocol and up to 14 days.

462

This is the first study that established a multiple system for following up the

463

progression of the chemosensory disorder and detecting the infection; be it by means

464

of the molecular test or the SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies detection test. The

465

Venezuelan olfactory test is a tool that has been validated taking into consideration

466

the characteristics of the Venezuelan population.

467

In this research, we corroborate the spontaneous recovery of most patients. Only one

468

patient still has anosmia-type smell disorder; and in her case, other tests were carried

469

out to establish the actual cause of such disorder. In this regard, there is similarity

470

with what has been reported in the literature about recovery time. We did not find in

471

our review of other investigations any relationship between the persistence of

472

chemosensory dysfunction and the negativization of the RT-PCR test. Apparently,

473

there is no relationship between the improvement of the disorder and the viral load

474

detected by molecular and/or serologic tests.

475

The presence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and the fact that the

476

predictive value of the Venezuelan olfactory test and the basic taste test does not

477

exceed 70% may be hypothetically explained, not only by the time when the

478

investigation began - which was too early with respect to the contagion peak in the

479

country- but also by some social, demographic, and genetic characteristics of the

480

sample studied. It could also be due to the virus mutations that affect certain

481

populations.

482

In this regard, the SARS-CoV-2 spike mutation has been described as mediating the

483

infection in human cells. Korber et al. listed 13 mutations that are deemed to be

484

within a wider phylogenetic spectrum that could change with geography and with

485

time, and which could give some populations certain selective advantages as to the

486

transmission or resistance to the infection. In the case of Europe, the spike mutation

487

D614G was dominant and began spreading in February 2020 and had such aggressive

488

impact on the population. There is evidence of recombinant strains circulating locally

489

and that are indicative of infections by multiple strains (22). This is being researched

490

currently in Colombia and Venezuela. Rodríguez-Morales et al. (23) described 3

491

genomic sequences of coronavirus mutations that may explain the behavior of the

492

disease in Venezuela, in specific zones like Zulia, (where there has been significant

493

migratory activity of people to and from Colombia and Brazil) and where the severity

494

of the infection has been higher than in other geographic zones of the country (23).

495

This hypothesis could explain why infections are mild or asymptomatic in some areas

496

and severe in others, or why the penetrance of chemosensory dysfunction is lower

497

than in other reports.

498

We may conclude that there is significant presence of smell and taste disorders, as

499

clinical signs, in the course of the mild coronavirus disease. Therefore, every patient

500

who presents with symptoms, must be isolated and screened for the disease by means

501

of appropriate diagnostic tests. Patients evolve towards the resolution of smell and

502

taste disorders spontaneously and recover in a period of time between 3 days and 5

503

weeks, with an average of 8 to 10 days. Rapid diagnostic tests are not useful for

504

diagnosing the coronavirus infection, but only for following it up. We would suggest

505

including the olfactory test and taste test as part of the battery of tests complementary

506

to the RT-PCR test for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 and following up the progression of

507

the disease.
