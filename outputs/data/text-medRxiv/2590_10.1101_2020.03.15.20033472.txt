Abstract
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is an ongoing global health
emergence, but the pathogenesis remains unclear. We revealed blood cell immune
response profiles using 5’ mRNA, TCR and BCR V(D)J transcriptome analysis with
single-cell resolution. Data from 134,620 PBMCs and 83,387 TCR and 12,601 BCR
clones was obtained, and 56 blood cell subtypes and 23 new cell marker genes were
identified from 16 participants. The number of specific subtypes of immune cells
changed significantly when compared patients with controls. Activation of the
interferon-MAPK pathway is the major defense mechanism, but MAPK transcription
signaling is inhibited in cured patients. TCR and BCR V(D)J recombination is highly
diverse in generating different antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the
interferon-MAPK pathway and TCR- and BCR-produced antibodies play important
roles in the COVID-19 immune response. Immune deficiency or immune overresponse may result in the condition of patients with COVID-19 becoming critical or
severe.

The battles between humans and the pathogenic viruses are never ending. Epidemic
diseases, including Zika (1), severe acute respitatory sundrome ( SARS) (2), and
Ebola (3), strike quickly, often killing hundreds of people during a single outbreak.
On December 31, 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), belonging to the
Orthocoronavirinae subfamily and distinct from middle east respiratory syndrome
(MERS)-CoV and SARS-CoV, emerged in Wuhan, China (4-6). The rapid person-toperson spread of SARS-CoV-2, which causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19), presents an imminent threat to public health and has caused a global health
emergency (7-9). The World Health Organization emergency committee declared this
outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern” because of its 2.1%
mortality rate and person-to-person transmission (10). As of March 7, 2020, over
102,136 people have fallen ill with SARS-CoV-2, leading to 3,492 deaths in 93
countries, and the coronavirus continues to spread quickly all over the world.
Symptoms of COVID-19 included fever, myalgia, and fatigue, as well as dry cough,
shortness of breath, sputum production, headache, hemoptysis, sore throat, and
diarrhea.

Lymphopenia, prolonged

prothrombin time, and

elevated

lactate

dehydrogenase levels have also been observed in the patients with COVID-19 (6). A
computed tomography (CT) can identify bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass
opacity in the lungs (6, 8, 11-13). Despite the high infection and mortality rates, there
is no specific cure for the disease because its pathogenesis remains unclear.
The human adaptive immune system plays a critical role in defending against viral
infections. Many immune cells (such as leukocytes) and immune molecules (such as
specific plasma proteins) are intrinsic components of blood. Therefore, the functions
of blood and the immune system are inseparable. T cells and B cells are important in
the pathogenesis of many—perhaps all—immune-mediated diseases (14-17). A T cell
receptor (TCR) mediates recognition of pathogen-associated epitopes through
interactions with peptide and major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs). TCRs
and B cell receptors (BCRs) are generated by genomic rearrangement at the germline
level, a process termed V(D)J recombination, which has the ability to generate
marked diversity among TCRs and BCRs. Parameterizing the elements of antigenspecific immune repertoires across a diverse set of epitopes may generate powerful
applications in a variety of research fields for the diagnosis and treatment of
infectious diseases. Here, we focus on insights into blood immune responses to
COVID-19 using 5’ mRNA, TCR, and BCR V(D)J recombination analysis with

single-cell resolution.
In this study, 16 participants were recruited from the Sichuan Province of China.
The basic information and clinical features of the patients are listed in Table S1. The
lung CT images of these subjects are shown in Fig. S1. There was one critical case
(patient 1, male, 34 years old), one severe case (patient 2, male, 43 years old), and six
moderate cases (patients 3-8) comprised of two males and four females aged 25-62
years old (Table S1). The two cured patients (patient 9, male, 40 years old and patient
10, female, 20 years old) were on the discharged day from hospital after they tested
negative for SARS-CoV-2 and the disease signs disappeared. Three healthy people
were included as normal controls (NC 1-3, Table S1). In order to differentiate the
COVID-19 immune response from other infectious diseases, thereby identifying the
unique COVID-19 immune response, we also recruited one case of influenza A
(patient 11), one case of acute pharyngitis (patient 12), and one case of cerebral
infarction (patient 13) as controls (Table S1).
The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of each individual were isolated
from the whole blood, and the single-cell mRNA sequencing (ScRNA-Seq) analysis
of the PBMCs was performed on the 10 X genomics platform with Chromium Next
GEM Single Cell V(D)J Reagent Kits v1.1 (Fig. 1A). After quality control, we
obtained 134,620 PBMC cells, 83,387 TCR clones, and 12,601 BCR clones from the
16 samples. In these samples, we identified 17 completely different PBMC cell types,
which could be further divided into 56 cell subtypes according to marker genes of the
134,620 cells (Fig. 1B, 1C, 1D and Table S2). The 17 cell types included CD4+ T
cells identified by LTB and IL7R markers, CD8+ T cells identified by LEF1 and
CD8A, CD1C+_B dendritic cells identified by BSET1 and CD1D, CD4+ cytotoxic T
cells identified by CST7 and CCL4, CD8 cytotoxic T cells identified by CD3D and
CD8A, and other cell types (Fig. 1C, Table S2). This suggests that human PBMCs
have evolved highly differentiated cell subtypes to resist the invasion of pathogens
(18). There were three main states in the analysis process for reconstructing the
developmental trajectories of the 56 cell subtypes, which showed a continuous
trajectory of differentiating PBMCs (Fig. 1E, Fig. S2). In addition, 23 totally new
candidate marker genes linked to 22 cell subtypes were identified (Fig. S3),
suggesting potential roles for these newly discovered cell markers in the identification
and functional study of these subtypes.
To investigate the immune cell behaviors of the 56 cell subtypes in different

conditions of COVID-19, we compared the cell types of the eight patients with
critical, severe, or moderate COVID-19 conditions and the three normal controls (Fig.
2A). We observed that the proportion of the CD1C+_B dendritic cells (clusters 7, 13,
and 30), CD8 cytotoxic T cells (cluster 9), and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (cluster 36)
increased in patients with COVID-19, while the B cells (cluster 16) and CD4+ T
helper cells (cluster 51）decreased in the COVID-19 patients compared to the normal
controls (Fig. 2A), indicating that the number of specific clusters of immune cells
adjusts to fight SARS-CoV-2 aggression.
To further investigate the immune cell behaviors of each cell subtype in different
conditions of COVID-19, we separately compared the critical, severe, moderate, and
cured patients with the normal controls (Fig. 2A). For the critical condition (patient 1),
the proportion of 40 out of the 56 cell subtypes decreased; some subtypes, including
CD8+ T cell (cluster 52), CD4+ T cell (cluster 55,56) and plasmacytoid dendritic cell
(cluster 53), disappeared. These changes may suggest immunodeficiency in the
patient. This is consistent with the lower number of lymphocytes in the patient (0.75 ×
109/L) compared to the normal range (1.1-3.2 × 109/L, Table S1). However, some
other cell subtypes, including CD8 cytotoxic T cells (cluster 9), CD1C+_B dendritic
cells (cluter 7, 13, 19, 30, 39), effector CD8+ memory T (Tem) cells (cluster 14), and
CD141+CLEC9A+ dendritic cells (cluster 45), increased, suggesting the limited
immune response existed. In the severe condition (patient 2), the proportion of 45 of
the 56 cell types increased, which may suggest over-activation of immune cells,
including CD8+ T cells (cluster 1, 4, 18, 28 etc.), CD8 cytotoxic T cells (cluster 1 and
cluster 25), CD4+ cytotoxic T cells (cluster 8 and cluster 21), Naive CD8+ T cell
(cluster 2), plasmacytoid dendritic cell (cluster 53), and others. However,
AXL+SIGLEC6+ dendritic cells (cluster 54) decreased in this patient. In the moderate
condition (patients 3-8), the proportion of various cell types was between that of the
critical and severe conditions. In the cured patients, effector CD8+ memory T (Tem)
cells (cluster 14), megakaryocyte progenitor cells (cluster 23), CD1C+_B dendritic
cells (cluster 39), and CD141+CLEC9A+ dendritic cells (cluster 45) decreased
significantly. These results suggested a wide range of immune responses involved in
the blood circulation system after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Then, we analyzed the gene expression differences in each cell subtype of the
COVID-19 conditions and controls and identified a number of differentially

expressed (DE) genes (External Databases S1-S4). To further explore the enriched
signal pathways of the DE genes in each cell subtype, we analyzed the enriched
pathways of the DE genes in each cell cluster using local string network analysis. In
patients with critical, severe, moderate, or cured conditions, we found that 18 (in eight
cell subtypes), 18 (in 35 cell subtypes), 24 (in 35 cell subtypes), and 15 (in 21 cell
subtypes) signal pathways, respectively, were over-activated or inactivated for each
disease condition (Fig. 2B-F, Table S3-6). These significantly enriched signal
pathways were mainly involved in viral mRNA translation (high gene expressions in
AXL+SIGLEC6+ dendritic cells, CD4+ T cells, and other cells) (Fig. S4-5),
interaction alpha/beta signaling (Fig. S6-7), a mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) pathway (Fig. S8-9), immunology interactions between lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells (CD1C+_B dendritic cells and CD4+ cytotoxic T cells) (Fig. S10-11),
and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II protein complex (B cells and
CD1C+_B dendritic cells) (Fig. S12-13), suggesting that antigen presentation for
targeting the virus was activated.
In the severe condition (patient 2), 18 signaling pathways were significantly
changed in more than half of the cell subtypes compared to the normal controls.
Among these pathways, the most important was over-activation of the interferonrelated signaling pathways, including 2’-5’-oligoadenylate synthase and type I
interferon signaling pathway（naive CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and other cells) and
interferon alpha/beta/gamma signaling (naive CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and other
cells) (Fig. 2C, Table S3). In other COVID-19 conditions, the interferon signal was
also over-activated to varying degrees. However, in the cured patients, the interferon
signal was just mildly activated compared to the patients with severe and moderate
conditions. In the cured condition, the signal pathway related to mRNA translation of
the virus was suppressed, while the signal pathway related to MAPK was significantly
enriched (Fig. 2C, Table S3-6). To detect whether these signaling pathway changes
were specific to COVID-19, we compared the COVID-19 patients with the patients
with influenza A (patient 11), acute pharyngitis (patient 12), and cerebral infarction
(patient 13) and found that the signaling pathways were still enriched after filtering
with these related disease controls (Fig. S14). Among these pathways, the interferonMAPK signaling pathway was the major blood immune response for COVID-19
infection.

The activation of the MAPK signaling pathway by interferon involves a set of
defense mechanisms evolved by human beings to fight against viral infections (19-21).
To further explore the expression differences of genes involved in different cell types
in the various COVID-19 conditions, we analyzed the gene expressions in patients
with COVID-19 and compared them to those of the controls (Fig. 2G-J, Fig. S7). First,
we observed up-regulation expression of the interferon signal genes in the COVID-19
patients. Among them, interferon α-inducible protein 27 (IFI27), originally known to
involve in innate immunity and to intervene in cell proliferation (22), was
increasingly expressed in many cell types, including CD1C+_B dendritic cells,
CD1C-CD141- dendritic cells, CD141+CLEC9A+ dendritic cells, CD8 cytotoxic T
cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Second, the expressions of IFITM1, IFITM3,
and IFI6, which were shown to be related to interferon-related pathway and
associated with Influenza and West Nile Virus (23-26), were strikingly up-regulated
in all of these cells. The expression trends of these genes were similar in the four
COVID-19 conditions. The results indicate that interferon signals, especially
interferon alfa/beta/gamma and interferon type I, are activated in the blood of patients
with COVID-19.
Then, in the downstream of the interferon signaling, we found that MAPK
signaling pathway transcription factors were activated in hospitalized patients with
COVID-19, including high expressions of FOS, JUN, JUNB, and DUSP1 (Fig. 2K-N,
Table S8). These genes were previously shown to regulate cell invasion, migration,
proliferation and innate immunity by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production
(27, 28). In three groups of inpatients with different conditions, the up-regulated
expression of these genes was observed in CD1C+_B dendritic cell, CD1C-CD141dendritic cell, CD141+CLEC9A+ dendritic cell, CD8 cytotoxic T cells, and
plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Interestingly, in contrast to the three groups of inpatients,
the expression pattern of these genes in the two cured patients was the opposite. In the
cured patients, down-regulated expression was detected, indicating that the MAPK
signaling pathway was inhibited in these cells. These results indicate that downregulation of the MAPK signal pathway may be one sign of patient recovery.
To further explore the antibody clonal proliferation of TCR and BCR in COVID-19,
we conducted TCR and BCR V(D)J single cell transcriptome analysis. Using
integration analysis, we detected 83,387 TCR cell clones and 12,601 BCR clones in
the 16 subjects (Fig. 3A). This result revealed the antibody repertoire in patients with

COVID-19 and showed huge diversities of TCR and BCR clones in each individual.
In the critical condition (patient 1), the fewest TCR clones (1,232) were detected,
while, in the severe condition (patient 2), more TCR clones (7,161) were detected. In
one moderate patient (patient 8), the most TCR clones (20,370) were detected.
According to these findings, the fewer the TCR clones, the more severe the COVID19 condition. The distribution of all TCR clones and the number of TCR clones of
each patient are shown in Fig. 3B and Table S9. Using evolutionary analysis of the
top TCR antibody sequences revealed by TCR sequencing, we found that TCRα
sequences of CASSEGVGTPFDEQFF (patient 2), CASSLGLAGDLDEQFF and
CASNQGLAGGRLYNEQFF (patient 4), CASSQERGVYNEQFF (patient 6) and
CASSEVWASDHEQYF (patient 10) were closely related (Fig. S15), suggesting that
these antibody sequences may have a special activity for SARS-CoV-2 (and influenza
A). Compared to TCR, the number of BCR clones detected was much lower (Fig. 3C,
Table S10). However, very strong BCR antibodies were not induced in most of the
patients except in two moderate patients (patients 6 and 8).
In one moderate patient (patient 9) (Fig. 3D-G), we detected 361 clones of CDR3
IGLorK/IGH sequences of CQQYGSSPWTF/CARVAESYYDFWSAKWEGAFDIW
and 119 clones of CQQYNSYSF/CARSGPITIFGVVIKGRGGDAFDIW (Fig. 3C,
Table S10). In another moderate patient (patient 7), four high frequency clones were
identified, including CQQYYSIPSLTF/CATHRTYFDWLLPFDYW (179) (Fig. 3C,
Table S10). These results suggest that the antibodies produced by patients 7 and 9
may have a SARS-CoV-2 specific affinity.
We then analyzed top TCR encoded antibody sequences for known antigens, and
some of them were annotated in the VDJdb antigen categories database (Fig. 3H). In
patients with COVID-19, we detected immune responses to known antigens,
including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), HIV-1, influenza A, yellow fever, and other RNA
viruses, as well as DNA viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV). In addition,
autoantigens were detected in the severe condition (patient 2) and the moderate
condition (patients 4, 8, and 9). In patient 2, the autoantigen response was obvious
activation, which indicated that this severe disease condition may be related to strong
autoimmunity. On the contrary, in the critical condition (patient 1), only two
antibodies against the Ebola EBV antigen were detected. These results further suggest
that the critical condition may be caused by insufficient immunity, while the severe
condition may be aggravated by excessive autoimmunity. In the normal condition, no

immune response to these antigens was detected for NC 1 and NC 3; for the NC 2,
two antigens were detected (HIV-1 and influenza A) (Fig. 3H). For the patient with
influenza A (patient 11), the antigen and autoimmune responses of the yellow fever
virus were detected. For the patient with acute pharyngitis (patient 12), EBV, HIV-1,
influenza A and yellow fever virus antigens were detected, but there was no
autoimmune response. For the patient with cerebral infarction (patient 13), no known
antigens were detected. These results indicate that humans might use known immune
recognition (mainly known RNA viruses) to fight against SARS-CoV-2.
Type I interferon (IFN-I) is crucial for promoting antiviral defenses through the
induction of antiviral effectors (29). In this study, our single cell transcriptome results
revealed that a set of genes involved in the interferon-MAPK pathway were upregulated in the COVID-19 patients. To further validate this finding, we performed
quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
testing to detect the expressions of IRF27, BST2, and FOS in another cohort of three

critical, three server, 19 moderate, three mild and 10 cured patients with COVID-19
and five normal controls (Fig. 4A). IIF27, an immune biomarker which was reported
to be related to cell proliferation and invasion and could discriminate between
influenza and bacteria in patients with suspected respiratory infection (30), showed
the most strongest up-regulation in COVID-2019 patients’ PBMCs in the interferon
signaling pathway in the single cell transcriptome data. The real-time PCR results
showed that IRF27 was up-regulated 8.1 times more in critical patients, 51.7 times in
severe patients, 39.9 times in moderate patients, 38.6 times in mild patients, and 29.5
times in cured patients compared to the normal controls (Fig. 4A). These results
suggest that IRF27 is a candidate marker gene for SARS-CoV-2 infection. BST2,
which was previously shown to play a role in pre-B-cell growth (31), also showed upexpression in COVID-19 patients. Consistent with our single cell transcription data,
the expression profile of FOS, which is a transcription factor mediating MAPK
pathway signaling, showed up-regulation in COVID-19 patients but down-regulation
in cured patients. This result suggests that FOS is a candidate marker gene for cured
COVID-19 patients. We further performed PBMC immunofluorescence testing to
compare the protein expressions of IFI27 between patients with COVID-19 and
controls. Immunofluorescence staining showed that IFI27 was highly expressed in the
whole lymphocyte of patients with COVID-19, but only partially expressed on the
lymphocyte of the controls (Fig. 4B).

In summary, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 can enter the blood through the
circulatory system and cause a blood immune response after infection through the
respiratory system. Therefore, in patients with COVID-19, the damage is related to
multiple organs (32). The leukocyte immune responses involve many cell subtypes,
including CD8+ T cells, CD8 cytotoxic T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD4+ cytotoxic T cells,
CD1C+_B dendritic cells and other cell subtypes. After the virus reaches the blood
immune cells, it might replicate-mainly in AXL+SIGLEC6+ dendritic cells, CD4+ T
cells, and naive CD8+ T cells and might activate multiple cell subtypes of the
interferon signal pathway to produce effectors, such as IFI27, IFITM1 and IFITM3, to
fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The similar process also happened to Influenza and West
Nile Virus infection in human (23, 24). Through downstream activation of MAPK, the
expression of downstream effectors is activated by key transcription factors, such as
FOS, JUN, and JUNB, which lead to a wide range of antiviral responses in the blood
system (Fig. 4C). These results suggested that the immune response may come back
the normal situation when the patients recovery, and the MAPK signal is thus
inhibited.
In conclusion, in this study, we revealed the immune response process of SARSCoV-2 entering the blood circulation system using immune profiling analysis with
single-cell resolution. In the critical condition, the number of different cell types,
expressed genes, and TCR/BCR responses indicated a relationship between the
critical nature of the patient’s condition and his immunodeficiency. On the contrary,
the severe condition was shown to be related to a strong autoimmune response and
over-activated interferon pathway. These results suggested that immune deficiency or
immune over-reacts may make patients with COVID-19 go to worse condition
because of their imbalance adaptive immune response (33-35). Our study also shows
that the activation of the interferon-MAPK signaling pathway and TCR- and BCRproduced antibodies play key roles in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection. These
results will provide important information for COVID-19 treatment and drug
development.

Fig. 4 The interferon-MAPK pathway in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. (A)
Real-time PCR validation of IFI27 and BST2 in the interferon pathway and FOS in
the MAPK pathway. IFI27 and BST2 are up-regulated in patients with COVID-19.
FOS is up-regulated in hospitalized patients but down-regulated in cured patients. (B)
Immunofluorescence staining of IFI27 in PBMCs of patients with COVID-19 and
normal controls. (C) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 response of the blood system. After the virus
reaches the blood immune cells, it can activate multiple cell subtypes of the interferon
signal pathway to produce effectors, such as IFI27, IFITM1, and IFITM3, to fight the
virus. Through downstream activation of MAPK, the expression of downstream
effectors is activated by key transcription factors, FOS, JUN, and JUNB, which lead
to a wide range of antiviral responses in the blood system.
