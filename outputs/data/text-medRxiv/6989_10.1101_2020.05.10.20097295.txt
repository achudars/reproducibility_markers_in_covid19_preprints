Abstract
Background: The spread of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has
reached a global level, creating a pandemic. The government of various countries, their citizens, politicians, and
business owners are worried about the unavoidable economic impacts of this pandemic. Therefore, there is an
eagerness for the pandemic peaking. Objectives: This study uses an objective approach to emphasize the need
to be pragmatic with easing of lockdowns measures worldwide through the forecast of the possible trend of
COVID-19. This is necessary to ensure that the enthusiasm about SARS-CoV-2 peaking is properly examined,
easing of lockdown is done systematically to avoid second-wave of the pandemic. Methods: We used the
Facebook prophet on the World Health Organization data for COVID-19 to forecast the spread of SARS-CoV-2
for the 7th April until 3rd May 2020. The forecast model was further used to forecast the trend of the virus for
the 8th until 14th May 2020. We presented the forecast of the confirmed and death cases. Results: Our findings
from the forecast showed an increase in the number of new cases for this period. Therefore, the need for easing
the lockdown with caution becomes imperative. Our model showed good performance when compared to the
official report from the World Health Organization. The average forecasting accuracy of our model was 79.6%.
Conclusion: Although, the global and economic impact of COVID-19 is daunting. However, excessive
optimism about easing the lockdown should be appropriately weighed against the risk of underestimating its
spread. As seen globally, the risks appeared far from being symmetric. Therefore, the forecasting provided in
this study offers an insight into the spread of the virus for effective planning and decision-making in terms of
easing the lockdowns in various countries.

Introduction

The year 2019 ended on a remarkable note over the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)

[1]. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection can develop

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [2] with an incubation period ranging from 2 to 14
days [1]. The first case of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan,
Hubei province, China in December 2019 [3]. It was reported to have originated in bats and
transmitted to humans through yet unknown animals within Wuhan, China. From the primary
place where it first emerged, it has spread globally. Thus, the World Health Organization
(WHO) declared the outbreak a pandemic [4].
The mode of transmission in humans includes inhalation or contact with infected
droplets where the symptoms include fever, cough, sore throats, difficulty in breathing
properly, fatigue among others [1]. Of note, many people are asymptomatic (showing no
symptoms of the virus), mild symptoms in some people, and severe symptoms in others
especially the elderly and those with comorbidities. These severe symptoms may progress to
multi-organ dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, and
pneumonia [1]. The severe symptoms have usually resulted in high rates of contacts to the
healthcare providers, hospitalization, and admission to the intensive care units (ICU) [5]
Around 96, 000 cases were reported in early March 2020 (05/03/2020) [1]. By early
April, the number of cases globally has increased to 1,603,330 (10/03/2020) [6]. The rise in
the number of cases had resulted in various measures to reduce the spread of this virus. The
example of such measures includes lockdown by countries [7]. Other measures include social
distancing, contact tracing, quarantine, increased handwashing and sanitizing, temporary
closedown of schools, businesses, and international trades. Therefore, the global economic
impact of this pandemic is of great concern.

Entrepreneurs have been rendered temporarily unemployed. Governments have either
introduced laws, update social welfare, or provides palliatives to ensure that the overall
impacts of this pandemic on her citizens are relatively reduced. Though, the long term
sustainability of these approaches remains doubtful. Thus, Government, politicians, and
business owners are eager to get back to their normal daily routine. This eagerness has led to
optimism about the pandemic peaking.
Despite the significant economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic for the past 100
days (since the virus had been identified), reasonable caution against excessive optimism
about the pandemic peaking must be exercised to minimize the overall impacts (economic,
social, and death) [8]. Therefore, this paper introduces an objective approach to forecasting
the global spread of COVID-19 crisis. Accurate forecasting of the associated risks and spread
of the virus is necessary to ensure that the implications can be properly analyzed, planning by
the government and business owners improved, and informed decisions about the pandemic
can be made in terms of easing the lockdown.

Methods

2.1.

World Health Organization (WHO) data

The study data was obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO
COVID-19 data was used to assess the worldwide and country-specific trends of COVID-19
new confirmed and death cases around the world. The data contained cases from 09 January
2020 until 6 April 2020. The input variables contained in the dataset were day, country,
country name, region, death, cumulative deaths, confirmed, cumulative confirmed. As the
data is publicly available, informed consent was not needed.

Trend of the virus

The forecasting of the trend of the virus was done using Facebook’s Prophet in Google
Colaboratory (a free Jupyter notebook environment). The dataset and the corresponding
libraries were imported to Jupyter Notebook. The data was further preprocessed to remove
missing values and ensure that the data is in the proper format. Additionally, the columns
were renamed for convenience in the analyses. The visualization of the top 11 countries,
Finland, and Nigeria (most populous African country) as of 7th May 2020 is given in Figure
1. The actual decomposition of the time series data was done using an additive model. The
additive model has been implemented because it is easy to develop, fast to train, and provides
interpretable patterns 9. We used the last 3 months of the COVID-19 cases to forecast for the
next 5 days (8th until 14th May 2020) using the Facebook Prophet, with a 95% prediction
interval by creating a base model using seasonality-related parameters and additional
regressors. Note that the yearly and daily seasonality was not set since COVID-19 is not a
seasonal disease. The forecast given by our model was compared with the official data
reported on the World Health Organization (WHO) official website for COVID-19 updates
for the same date. The dashboard of WHO’s official website for comparison is available at
https://covid19.who.int/. The result of the comparison for 07.04.2020 – 03.05.2020 is
presented in Table 1. We also presented the model forecast for the 8th until 14th May 2020 to
further validate our model prior to the official release of the cases by the World Health
Organization.

Results

The study cohort included 210 countries at the time of data extraction from WHO official
website (06.04.2020). After building the forecast model, it showed good forecasting accuracy

in predicting the confirmed and death cases for the date of data retrieval (6.04.2020) as
shown in Table 1, respectively. As shown in Table 1, the prediction accuracy of the model for
the confirmed cases was 79.6% and 80.3% (average of 79.9%) for the death cases when its
performance for forecasting for the period 07.04.2020 – 03.05.2020 was compared with the
reported cases on WHO official website for confirmed and death cases, respectively. The
details of the forecast for this period is given in Table 1. As shown in Figures 2-3, there was
increase in the number of cases, although not spike increase in the number of confirmed and
death cases as seen in previous months. Additionally, the next 7 days (8th – 14th May 2020)
prediction of the pandemic COVID-19 showed a rise in the number of confirmed cases and
deaths from COVID-19 globally (Figure 2-3). As shown in Figure 2, few cases were
confirmed between Mondays until Wednesdays. Likewise, most deaths occurred between
Tuesdays and Thursdays (Figure 3). Towards easing the lockdown, the World Health
Organization published six (6) important criteria that includes evidence that the transmission
of COVID-19 is controlled, effective mechanism of contract tracing, quarantine, and testing,
minimized outbreaks amongst the vulnerable in care homes, continuous adherence to
preventive measures (physical distancing, handwashing, etc.), importation risks can be
managed, and proper information and engagement of the communities concerning the
pandemic [9]. Most countries have published tentative plans to ease the lockdown measures
to address the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As shown by our predictive model,
restarting the economies that had been significantly affected by the sudden shutdowns to curb
the devastating effects of COVID-19 this should be done with caution [10]. This is necessary
to avoid a possible second-wave of the virus which could have more damaging consequences
[10].

In this study, we used a time series forecasting approach to forecast the trend of COVID-19
from 07.04.2020 until 03.05.2020 (Table 1) and forecast the trend for the next 7 days (0814.05.2020). This approach was aimed at emphasizing that the easing of lockdowns in
various countries should be done systematically to avoid second-wave of the pandemic. We
produced a forecast model using a Facebook prophet that used additive models [11]. A
Facebook prophet was used as it is accurate, fast, fully automatic, offers tunable forecast, and
compatible with Python or R [12]. Of note, as this is not a seasonal occurrence and the fact
that there is no known vaccine yet, we assume that the trend will continue indefinitely in the
modelling. The average forecasting accuracy of our model was 79.9%. The differences
between our forecast model and the WHO official reported cases may be due to the possible
errors, delay or inadequate reporting by various countries. Despite this variation, our forecast
model still showed reasonable accuracy to forecast the confirmed and death cases for the
target dates. The fact that the confirmed cases increases significantly between Wednesdays
and Saturdays may account for the time taken to get and record the results from these tests.
Similarly, the curve decreased on the weekend as most death cases were usually reported and
recorded during the weekdays.
Our model produced a comparable performance in terms of the trend of the pandemic
as shown in Table 1. It was observed that, there was no spike increase in the number of
confirmed and death cases within this period. This may suggest that the pandemic may have
started to peak in various countries. Despite this, for the period of 8th- 14th May 2002, our
model predicted a rise in the number of confirmed cases globally (Figures 2-3). Therefore,
excessive optimism about the easing the lockdown in various countries should be met with
caution. This is because, at present, the life-and-death pressure on our health facilities is
enormous [13–15]. The testing places and hospitals currently have limited or no resources to
treat COVID-19 patients [14]. Thus, change of policies to relax the lockdown and social

distancing should be done systematically, otherwise, an increase in the number of
hospitalized patients may be inevitable. With the current states of the various hospitals
globally, it may be difficult to properly manage COVID-19 patients.
The global infection is expected to rise to 40-70% in the coming year [16]. The
concern about the rise in the number of confirmed cases was also echoed by the Governor of
Massachusetts echoed when he projected that between 0.7 and 2.5 % of the state’s population
are likely to contract the coronavirus [17]. The main concern is for how long do we continue
to flatten the curve with the lockdown, quarantine, contract tracing, and social distancing
measures? Admittedly, the economic and global impact as a result of these measures is
massive. Therefore, the concerned authorities (government, politicians and other
stakeholders) have started to relax the lockdown policies to minimize the economic impacts.
However, as predicted by our forecast model, a possible rise in the number of
confirmed and death cases emphasize the need to have widespread testing in place and
hospitals have the resources needed to treat COVID-19 patients prior to switching of gears to
allow for controlled exposures [17]. Therefore, the government and policymakers need to get
the trend of the spread of the virus right. The understanding of the trajectory of COVID-19
spread ensures that the right decision regarding public policies is made [17]. As such, with
the forecast of the possible rise in the number of confirmed and death cases as presented by
our model, and the suggestion that only possible COVID-19 vaccine may bring back
normalcy [18,19], informing the citizens of the possibility of spending a year or more at
home prior to the development of a possible vaccine for COVID-19, or get immune in a hard
way becomes pertinent [17].
As pharmaceutical treatments for COVID-19 are yet to be found, the modality of
exposure of citizens to the virus needs to be controlled. With herd immunity (exposure to the

virus), the vulnerable citizens fall to save the less vulnerable. The main question with this
strategy is how this can be done ethically and responsibly. As predicted by our model, the rise
in the cases meant that exposure of the world population should be done reasonably, sensibly
and controllably for the citizens to acquire herd immunity while the world awaits the
breakthrough in the vaccine for COVID-19 [19]. Thus, the government needs to strike a
balance between the health and economic impact of this pandemic. If this is not properly
considered, there is a high risk of viral reintroduction (those tested negative after initial
exposure) [19], intense pressure on health facilities, and increased deaths from COVID-19.
As various countries such as France starts to ease the lockdown, important measures such as
making face masks compulsory, extra vigilance in the capital regions, reducing the number of
public gatherings and events, and temporary closing of place of schools and places worships
may still be in effect to avoid a possible second-wave of the pandemic [20].
In conclusion, despite the economic impact of COVID-19, the government and
policy-makers in various countries should be very pragmatic in the easing the lockdown
measures. Systematic easing of the lockdowns ensures that curve is not only flattened but
crushed with controlled exposure to the virus pending the breakthrough of possible
pharmaceutical treatment. The fact that our model predicted a spike in the rise should not lead
to overly panicking [21] but to understand the trend for the proper decision-making process,
especially in high-risk cases. This ensures that we are not only flattening the curve but
crushing the curve through controlled herd immunity of the world’s population.
