ABSTRACT

34

Introduction: Nurses are considered a trustworthy source of vaccine-related information to build

35

public confidence in vaccination. This study estimated nurses’ influenza vaccine uptake and intention

36

to receive COVID-19 vaccine when available, and examined the corresponding psychological

37

antecedents.

38

Methods : A cross-sectional online survey among nurses was conducted during the main COVID-19

39

outbreak in Hong Kong between mid-March and late April 2020. Demographics, influenza

40

vaccination, intention to have COVID-19 vaccine, the 5C vaccine hesitancy components (i.e.,

41

confidence, complacency, constraints, calculation, and collective responsibility), work stress and

42

COVID-related work demands (i.e., insufficient supply of personal protective equipment,

43

involvement in isolation rooms, and unfavorable attitudes towards workplace infection control

44

policies) were reported.

45

Results: The influenza vaccination coverage and the proportion intending to take COVID-19 vaccine

46

were 49% and 63%, respectively, among 1205 eligible nurses. Influenza vaccine uptake was

47

associated with working in public hospitals and all 5C constructs, whereas stronger COVID-19

48

vaccination intention was associated with younger age, more confidence, less complacency and more

49

collective responsibility towards the vaccine. COVID-19-related demands were associated with

50

greater work stress, and hence stronger COVID-19 vaccination intention.

51

Conclusion: Vaccine uptake/intention was well predicted by the 5C constructs. With less work stress

52

among nurses in the post-pandemic period, the intention to take COVID-19 vaccine will likely drop.

53

The 5C constructs should be infused in vaccination campaigns. While a COVID-19 vaccine could be

54

ready soon, communities are not ready to accept it. More research work is needed to boost the uptake.

INTRODUCTION
Vaccination is considered an effective approach to prevent infection and substantially reduce

58

the mortality of many infectious diseases such as influenza and HPV12. However, vaccine hesitancy, a

59

behaviour with delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccination services,

60

has depolarized the vaccine-supporters and their anti-vaccine counterparts. The World Health

61

Organization (WHO) considered this phenomenon as one of the ten threats in global health in 2019.

62

Three main factors are contributing to vaccine hesitancy: (i) individuals may lack confidence in and

63

be fearful towards vaccines, especially with the misunderstanding that vaccines pose a risk of

64

infection; (ii) individuals do not perceive a need for a vaccine or do not value the vaccine. For

65

example, the disease severity may be underestimated that individuals hold a complacent attitude

66

towards the need for prophylaxis; and (iii) it may be difficult to access the vaccine3. This

67

phenomenon was most conspicuous in the uptake decision for influenza vaccine in the general

68

population. Ten years since the influenza pandemic in 2009, about half of the population in the

69

United States did not have a seasonal influenza vaccine in 20194.

70

During the epidemic, Health Care Workers (HCWs) in the hospital can be considered as one

71

of the high-risk groups. HCWs’ infection risk could be amplified during the ongoing epidemic due to

72

various factors including continuous exposure to patients, shortages of personal protective measure

73

(PPE) supply and inadequate infection control training after immediate response to outbreak among

74

HCWs. During the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Hong Kong, the first

75

large transmission cluster occurred in Prince of Wales Hospital where HCWs accounted for a

76

substantial proportion of infection with 43.6% among cases admitted to this hospital . HCWs were

77

consequently responsible for about a quarter of total SARS infections in Hong Kong . While we were

78

noted for SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in the 2003 epidemic, another five human coronaviruses

79

(OC43, 229E, NL63, HKU1, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV) had been circulating for

80

decades among human populations . With their large genetic diversity and frequent genome

81

recombination, a new emerging coronavirus- SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in Wuhan, China in

82

late December 2019, and resulted in subsequent Coronavirus COVID-19 infections in other provinces

83

in mainland China, Hong Kong and ultimately all over the world. As of 24 February 2020, 3387

84

HCWs in medical facilities of 77262 COVID-19 laboratory confirmed cases in China (4.4%) were

85

recorded, of which 23 died from the infection . With the challenge of possible resurgence of COVID-

86

19 in the near future, increasing the proportion of immune individuals among HCWs and the general

87

population to the disease by vaccination as the indirect protection would be the only viable option to

88

avoid nosocomial infection. A survey conducted during the period of nationwide lockdown in France

89

showed that a quarter of the adult population (26%) refused to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2 when

90

it becomes available and were skeptical about its effectiveness .

Understanding HCWs’ vaccine hesitancy has substantial implications on public health

92

administrations during epidemics. HCWs’ infections take a direct bow on the healthcare system

93

during epidemics in terms of reducing available healthcare workforce. They are usually at the front

94

end of fighting with epidemics, and some of them are required to routinely perform procedures with

95

high risks of contracting with pathogens. HCWs also serve as potential vectors for nosocomial

96

transmission that protection them from epidemics play a pivotal role in infection control. Besides,

97

HCWs were considered as a trustworthy source of vaccine-related information for patients . The

98

WHO vaccine advisory group also highlighted that their role in building public confidence in

99

vaccines . They convey the message of vaccination benefits and address the worries and concerns of

100

the patients on a new developed vaccine. However, the influenza vaccine coverage among nurses was

101

only slightly greater than 30% . In light of this, improving our understanding of determinants

102

favoring vaccine uptake among nurses, a core group of HCWs, could have broader policy

103

implications for future COVID-19 vaccine acceptability and dissemination.

104

In this study, we first estimated the proportion of nurses with the intention in taking COVID-

105

19 and influenza vaccine uptake coverage. Second, a comparison analysis was conducted to examine

106

how well the vaccine hesitancy domains can predict both vaccines uptake decisions. Third, the

107

association of work stress with vaccine uptake decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic and factors

108

associated with the stress were also investigated.

109

110

111

METHOD
A cross-sectional online self-administered survey was conducted among nurses in Hong Kong.

112

The survey collected items including demographics (year of birth, sex, rank, presence of chronic

113

diseases), level of contacts with patients, influenza vaccine uptake and intention to take COVID-19

114

vaccine when available, statements measuring the 5 domains of vaccine hesitancy (see details below),

115

work stress level, supply of PPE, involvement in isolation rooms, and attitudes towards workplace

116

infection control policies.

This study was approved by the Survey and Behaviour Research Ethics Committee of The
Chinese University of Hong Kong (reference number: SBRE-19-251).

121

The required sample size to estimate seasonal influenza vaccine coverage and COVID-19

122

vaccine intention was 1049 based on an estimated population of 60000 registered or enrolled nurses

123

in Hong Kong, a 3% margin of error, a 95% confidence interval, and a prevalence rate at 50%. To

124

account for a 30% loss from invalid cases (ineligible or incomplete cases), the sample size required

125

was 1499. The online survey was disabled when the sample size was achieved.

126

In collaboration with the Association of Hong Kong Nursing Staff (AHKNS), registered

127

nurses, enrolled nurses, nursing students and trainees working in public or private medical facilities

128

were recruited in this study in the period from 16 March 2020 to 29 April 29 2020. Among over

129

50000 registered or enrolled nurses in Hong Kong, over 60% were members of AHKNS. A sample

130

recruited via AHKNS would be rather representative of the nurses in Hong Kong. Participants were

131

compensated with a coupon of HKD 25. Nursing students and retired nurses were excluded from this

132

analysis.

133

134

135

Measures
Vaccine hesitancy was measured using a 15-item tool developed from a “5C model” of

136

psychological antecedents to vaccination . Each of the 5 antecedents including confidence,

137

complacency, constraints, calculation, and collective responsibility, was assessed by 3 rating items on

138

a 7-point scale (1=strongly disagree; 7=strongly agree). Mean scores of items under each domain

139

were computed, with higher average score indicating stronger agreement of the corresponding

140

domain.

141

Work stress was measured by a single item asking participants to self-rate their level of work

142

stress after the outbreak of COVID-19 on an 11-point scale (0=no stress at all; 10=the maximum

143

stress). Insufficient supply of PPE was measured by asking participants to report any shortage of 7

144

PPE and an open option (1=yes; 0=no). The higher the total score, the more insufficient supply of

145

PPE was. A single item asking participants whether their job duties included work in infection

146

isolation rooms (1=yes; 0=no). Attitudes towards workplace infection control policies were measured

147

by 3 items stating if the workplace infection control policies were timely, sufficient, and effective,

148

respectively, on a 5-point rating scale (1=strongly disagree; 5=strongly agree).

149

Seasonal influenza vaccine uptake was measured by self-reported vaccination in 2019/20

150

while COVID-vaccine uptake intention was measured by a single item asking participants how likely

151

they will take the COVID-19 vaccine when available on a 11-point likert scale (0=definitely no;

152

10=definitely yes).

153

154

155

Statistical Analysis
To examine the potential bias on excluded cases, the sample characteristics were compared

156

between those with excluded and analyzed responses. To further examine the sample

157

representativeness, a couple of sample characteristics were compared with those reported in two

158

large-scale Health Manpower Surveys conducted by the Department of Health of the Hong Kong

159

SAR government. We summarized the characteristics of the study participants with descriptive

160

statistics such as mean, frequency, percentage and 95% binomial confidence interval (bCI) and their

161

bivariate correlations. A factor analysis using principal axis factoring approach was conducted to

162

examine the factorial validity of the 5C model in the current population. Multivariate linear and

163

logistic regression models were applied to identify factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine uptake

164

intention and influenza vaccine uptake decision respectively. The mediating effect was also tested

165

using path analysis with 2000 bootstrapped samples. A statistical significance was based on p-value

166

of 0.05. All analyses were conducted in R (v3.6.3) and Stata 16.0.

167

168

169

RESULTS
A total of 1660 attempts to complete the survey were recorded, of which 1205 respondents

170

were retained for the analyses. Excluded cases were those who had retired (n=37) or full-time nursing

171

students (n=95), or provided incomplete responses (n=323). No statistically significant difference was

172

found in sex composition, presence of chronic diseases, being a AHKNS member and ever had

173

influenza vaccination between those from complete and incomplete responses. Those with complete

174

responses, however, were more likely to be degree holders, working in the public service run by

175

Hospital Authority, older, have more frequent contact with patients, and a weaker intention to take

176

COVID-19 vaccine than those with incomplete responses. Registered nurses (80%) were slightly

177

overrepresented in our sample as compared with the percentage of registered nurses in the Nursing

178

Council of Hong Kong (75%), χ (1)=8.62, p=.003. Nurses in this sample were slightly more likely to

179

be women, degree holders, less likely to work in Hospital Authority, and younger as compared with

180

those in the Health Manpower Survey, χ (1)=6.89, p=.009. (Table S1)

184

the participants worked in the public hospitals (56%). Participants reported high exposure to patients

185

(M=4.35 on a scale of 1-5; SD=1.23).

186

The influenza vaccine coverage in the 2019-20 winter season was 49% (95% bCI: 47%, 52%).

187

Univariate associated determinants with higher influenza vaccine uptake were older age, presence of

188

chronic diseases, stronger vaccine confidence, collective responsibility, and work stress; and weaker

189

vaccine complacency and constraints. Intention to take COVID-19 vaccine when available was 6.52

190

(on a scale of 0-10; SD=2.83), which could be translated to 63% (95% bCI: 60%, 66%) reporting they

191

were likely to vaccinate (scored 6 or above). Univariate factors associated with stronger intention to

192

take COVID-19 vaccine were stronger vaccine confidence, calculation, collective responsibility, and

193

work stress; and weaker complacency and constraints. Correlations among the studied variables and

194

Cronbach’s alpha coefficients for composite measures are presented in Table S2.

195

The results of a parallel analysis showed that 5 factors should be retained for the vaccine

196

hesitancy measure (Table S3). Bartlett’s test, χ (105)=7841.71, p<.001, and KMO measure (.82) also

197

supported the factorability and sufficiency of the data. Using Oblimin rotation, all items conformed to

198

the original factor structure, with factor loadings ranging from .63 to .84, except the only reverse item

199

tapping collective responsibility. It was removed and subsequently increased the Cronbach’s alpha

200

coefficient of collective responsibility from 0.62 to 0.82.

To explore the relationship between the progression of number of daily confirmed cases and

202

nurses’ intention to take COVID-19 vaccine, we overlaid the averaged intention of each reporting day

203

over the epidemic curve of Hong Kong (Figure S1). The data collection period covered the main

204

wave of COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong. The data reflected that intention was high and stable

205

during the burst of imported cases and local transmissions. A sudden drop in the intention to take

COVID-19 vaccine was observed when the number of confirmed cases dropped at the end of the

207

main wave of the outbreak. The level of intention was reinstated and less stable afterward.

208

209

Validity of 5C model in influenza vaccine uptake and COVID-19 vaccine intention
The reference models to predict influenza vaccine uptake or COVID-19 vaccination intention

210
211

included only covariates. Adding 5C into the influenza vaccination model increased the pseudo R

212

from 0.71% to 29.91%. In the final logistic regression model, influenza vaccination was associated

213

with working in public hospitals, aOR=1.56 (95%CI=1.16, 2.10), and having stronger vaccine

214

confidence, aOR=2.70 (2.27, 3.22), and collective responsibility, aOR=1.67 (1.40, 1.98), and weaker

215

complacency, aOR=0.69 (0.60, 0.79), constraints, aOR=0.83 (0.73, 0.94), and calculation, aOR=0.62

216

(0.51, 0.75). In comparison, adding 5C into COVID-19 vaccination model increased the R from

217

0.27% to 17.70%. In the final multiple regression model, intention to take COVID-19 vaccine was

218

associated with being younger, β=-.07, p=.02, and having stronger vaccine confidence, β=.29, p<.001,

219

and collective responsibility, β=.12, p<.001, and weaker complacency, β=-.11, p<.001. Table 2

220

shows the coefficients of the two regression models. When COVID-19 vaccination intention was

221

dichotomized as likely (score 6-10) and not likely (score 0-5), the pseudo R of the model was 10.19%.

222

The coefficients of the dichotomized COVID-19 vaccination intention model are presented in Table

226

To assess whether work stress mediated the association between COVID-19-related demands

227

and vaccination intention, we conducted a path analysis with 2000 bootstrapped samples (Figure 1,

228

Table S5). The indirect effects of insufficient supply of PPE, β=.04, p<.001, involvement in isolation

229

rooms, β=.09, p=.005, and attitudes towards control policies of public authorities, β=-.07, p=.001, on

230

COVID-19 vaccination intention via work stress were significant. Insufficient supply of PPE, β=.17,

231

p<.001, involvement in isolated rooms, β=.39, p=.001, and unfavorable attitudes towards control

232

policies of public authorities, β=-.29, p<.001, were associated with work stress. Work stress was

233

subsequently associated with vaccination intention, β=.22, p<.001, controlling for the predictors in

234

the previous COVID-19 vaccination intention model and the influenza vaccination status.

DISCUSSION
With the large-scale cross-sectional online survey with more than 1000 respondents during the

238

main wave of outbreak in the early phase of COVID-19 epidemic, this was the first study presenting

239

the uptake behaviour/intention of both influenza and potential COVID-19 vaccine among nurses in

240

Hong Kong. We report the estimates of both influenza vaccine uptake and intention to have COVID-

241

19 vaccine and identify their associated factors.

242

Despite the uncertainty of vaccine attributes such as effectiveness, side effects and duration of

243

protection, more than half of the respondents (63%) indicated that they were likely to opt for COVID-

244

19 vaccine when it becomes available. Younger age, stronger confidence and collective responsibility,

245

and weaker complacency were associated with stronger intention to be vaccinated. Also, COVID-19-

246

related demands including insufficient supply of PPE, involvement in isolated rooms and poorer

247

attitudes towards workplace control policies among nurses in the early phase of the epidemic in Hong

248

Kong were associated with greater work stress which in turn resulted in stronger intention to have

249

COVID-19 vaccine. Similar to a risk perception survey among the general population of Hong

250

Kong , the experience of SARS contributing to strong psychological responses, as reflected in nurses’

251

pressure level, underlined their vaccine uptake intention for COVID-19. This also applies to influenza

252

vaccination. About half of the respondents (49%) reported to receive influenza vaccine in the

253

2019/2020 season. This estimate is statistically higher than those observed in similar surveys from the

254

same population in 2013/14, 2014/15 , 2015/16, 2016/17 seasons (32%, 28%, 33% and 36%

255

respectively)

256

those observed in influenza or other respiratory diseases . Working in the public hospital, more

257

confidence, less complacency, less constraints, less calculation and more collective responsibility

258

were associated with the decision to have influenza vaccine uptake. The 5C model was more

259

predictive of influenza vaccine uptake than intention to take COVID-19 vaccine based on the pseudo

260

R coefficients of the models.

261

. This high rate may possibly be due to the similarity of COVID-19 symptoms with

Our study has several important public health implications. First, identification of

decision helps inform future vaccination campaigns. Older nurses with less intention to have COVID-

264

19 vaccine may contribute to possible nosocomial infection by their close contact with COVID-19

265

patients in the hospital. As older individuals are more susceptible to COVID-19 than younger

266

individuals , in the absence of vaccine uptake, they will very likely be a high-risk group in the next

267

wave of COVID-19 epidemic. Older and experienced nurses are particularly valuable in public health

268

emergency. The protection to this high-risk and highly valuable subgroup is particularly important

269

during an outbreak. With sporadic cases or fewer imported cases after the major epidemic globally

270

and further improvement in infection control practices, nurses will likely have relatively lower work

271

stress. In this connection, they may be less likely to have intention to take COVID-19 vaccine when

272

the vaccine is available. Another challenge is that age is a mortality risk factor for COVID-19

273

infection, but older nurses are less likely to take the vaccine. With their experience, they are likely to

274

be the role models of the junior nurses. Health authorities should tailor a vaccination program to

275

nurses, in particular older nurses, to have COVID-19 vaccination. Future research is also needed in

276

order to investigate why older nurses have a higher vaccination hesitancy, and explore potential

277

strategies in consciousness raising and attitude changing towards vaccination.

278

Second, uptake of the safe and effective vaccine could only be considered as an additional

279

measure to help control the COVID-19 pandemic. Assuming the population of COVID-19 vaccine

280

coverage is similar to that observed among nurses in this study with a conservative effectiveness of

281

50%, the spread of infection will be halted if the effective reproductive number Rt, a measure to

282

estimate the number of secondary cases generated by an index case in the presence of interventions, is

283

below 1.45. Apart from vaccination campaigns to boost uptake rate and continuous development of

284

antiviral therapy, the health authority should further consider to conduct the modelling studies to

285

explore the optimal levels of assorted interventions including encouragement of social-distancing

286

adoption, border controls, active case surveillance and contact tracing to maintain the epidemic in a

287

manageable level.

288

Third, more emphasis should be put on psychological components when implementing the

289

national-wide vaccination program. Our statistical framework suggested that the variation of

290

psychological constructs in the 5C model contributed a significant proportion to explain both

291

influenza vaccine uptake and COVID-19 vaccine uptake intention. Our findings were consistent with

292

a previous study that the 5C vaccine hesitancy scale could well examine the psychological

293

antecedents of influenza vaccination . However, the power of 5C was weaker in predicting COVID14

294

19 vaccine uptake intention. It is not surprising that calculation and constraints in the 5C hesitancy

295

model were found to be not associated with this intention. Given very limited information related to

296

COVID-19 vaccine during the early phase of the epidemic, respondents were not able to perform an

297

extensive information search and evaluate their synonyms for the possible perceived barriers on the

298

new vaccine. The validity of the 5C model may increase as there is more information about the new

299

vaccine. Further validation work of vaccine hesitancy models on COVID-19 vaccine is warranted.

300

When the strongest interventions such as mandatory vaccination or opt-out policies are not ethically

301

justified, targeting the 5C components through evidence-informed interventions , health

302

communication approaches , and new media may be some viable options.

303

23

This study has a couple of limitations. First, a convenience sampling approach may result in

304

potentially biased estimates. Second, this was a cross-sectional study which could not infer the causal

305

relationship. Third, possible recall bias may occur in self-reporting measurements. Fourth, not all

306

components in the 5C vaccine hesitancy model could address the intention to have COVID-19

307

vaccine hesitancy when the vaccine attributes are not available. Fifth, the intention to receive

308

COVID-19 vaccine may be sensitive to the time-varying infection and mortality rate of the ongoing

309

pandemic.

310

311

312

CONCLUSION
This study provided additional validity evidence for the 5C vaccine hesitancy model and

313

showed its potential in predicting and promoting COVID-19 vaccine when available. While we are

314

cautiously optimistic that the vaccine will decrease the transmission, its ability to control the

315

pandemic is dependent on multiple factors such as uptake rate and vaccine effectiveness. If only 63%

316

of nurses during the main outbreak in Hong Kong intended to take the COVID-19 vaccine, we

317

anticipate that promoting the vaccine to the general public in the post-pandemic period will be much

318

more challenging. While a vaccine could be ready in a few months, our community and many alike

319

are not ready to accept it. More research work is needed to optimize the uptake of the vaccine, our

320

best hope so far.
