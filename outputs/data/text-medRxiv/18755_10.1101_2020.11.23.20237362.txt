ABSTRACT

34

In this retrospective multicenter cohort study, we aimed to investigate the association between

35

antihypertensive agent exposure and in-hospital mortality in patients with Covid-19. Of 8,078

36

hospitalized patients for Covid-19, 3,686 (45.6%) had hypertension including 2043 (55.4%)

37

patients exposed to a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors (RAASi), 1624 (44.1%) to

38

calcium channel blockers (CCB) and 1154 (37.7%) to beta-blockers. Overall in-hospital 30-

39

day mortality was 23.1%. Compared to non-users, the risk of mortality was lower in CCB

40

(aOR, 0.83 [0.70-0.99]) and beta-blockers users (aOR, 0.80 [0.67-0.95]), and not different in

41

RAASi users. These findings support the continuation of antihypertensive agents in patients

42

with Covid-19.

INTRODUCTION

49

The coronavirus disease-2019 (Covid-19), due to the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome

50

coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global pandemic representing a major treat to global health.

51

Data from several cohorts have shown that age and cardiovascular comorbidities, including

52

hypertension, were among the main determinants of severe disease.1,2 As SARS-CoV-2 uses

53

the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor as an entrance door into cells,

54

questions have been raised about the role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)

55

activity on Covid-19 pathophysiology.3 RAAS inhibitors directly acts on RAAS in two

56

different ways, both leading to ACE2 upregulation.3 On the contrary, some authors have

57

hypothesized that the use of RAAS inhibitors may protect against acute lung injury caused by

58

angiotensin II accumulation.4 Therefore, since these drugs such as ACE inhibitors (ACEi) or

59

angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are common treatments for hypertension, controversies

60

about their role on Covid-19 severity have been raised. To date, scientific societies have

61

advised against their discontinuation in patients with hypertension, until robust clinical

62

evidence is available.5 Previous reports showed that RAAS inhibitors do not increase the risk

63

of severe or fatal outcome in Covid-19 patients.1,6,7 The role of other antihypertensive agents

64

is unclear. However, these analyses are retrospective and additional data are needed to

65

ascertain the beneficial or harmful effect of antihypertensive agents on Covid-19 mortality.

66

In order to provide additional information, we performed a multicenter retrospective cohort

67

study in patients hospitalized for Covid-19 in Greater Paris area, France.

METHODS

71

Study population

72

This retrospective cohort study was conducted using the Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de

73

Paris (AP-HP) Health Data Warehouse (‘Entrepôt de Données de Santé (EDS)’

74

https://eds.aphp.fr/). This data-warehouse contains electronic health records (EHRs) of all

75

inpatients from the 39 greater Paris university hospitals. Adult patients having at least one

76

SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR test and hospitalized between February 1st and May 15th, 2020

77

have been included. Patients having a PCR test performed more than fourteen days after

78

hospitalization have been excluded considering they were very likely to be nosocomial

79

infection. Patients have been followed at least 30 days after inclusion (date of first PCR test

80

positive). The Institutional Review Board of the AP-HP Health Data Warehouse approved this

81

study on April 7th, 2020 (CSE-20-18_COVID19).

82
83

Comorbidities and drug exposure

84

Hypertension as well as other comorbidities have been retrieved in EHRs using specific codes

85

from the International Classification of Diseases 10th version, combined with natural language

86

processing (regular expressions) as previously described, within the six months previous to

87

the hospital stay for Covid-19 (Suppl Table S1).8 Antihypertensive agent exposure have been

88

identified in EHRs at admission of the hospital stay for Covid-19 and within the six previous

89

months, using both specific Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification (ATC) codes and

90

deep learning algorithm on clinical narratives as previously described (Suppl Table S2).8 As

91

described in Neuraz et al.8, we extracted drug mentions and their attributes (dose, frequency,

92

duration, route, condition) using a deep-learning pipeline based on fine-tuned multilingual

93

embeddings and bidirectional long-short term memory units combined with conditional

94

random fields.9 The drug mentions were then normalized to ATC using exact string matching.

Statistical analysis

97

The primary outcome was all-cause 30-day in-hospital mortality. We assessed the association

98

between antihypertensive agent class exposure and primary outcome using a multivariate

99

logistic regression. Analyses were adjusted on age, sex and main chronic diseases to take into

100

account confounding factors known to be associated with Covid-19 mortality. Data are

101

presented as median (interquartile range [IQR]) and numbers (%). The results of the logistic

102

regression model are presented as crude odds-ratio (OR) or adjusted OR (aOR) and their 95%

103

confidence interval ([95% CI]). All analyses were performed using R statistical software.

RESULTS

107

In Greater Paris University hospitals, 8,078 patients had been hospitalized for Covid-19

108

between February 1st and May 15th 2020, among which 1,531 (19.0%) died within 30 days.

109

Among hospitalized patients, 3,686 (45.6%) had hypertension and were included in the study.

110

In this population, median age was 75.4 (21.5) years and 57.1 % were male (Table 1).

111

Regarding antihypertensive agents, the main pharmacological classes used were RAAS

112

inhibitors (n=2043, 55.4%), calcium channel blockers (CCB) (n=1624, 44.1%), beta-blockers

113

(n=1154, 37.7%), and centrally acting sympatholytics (n=172, 4.7%). More specifically for

114

RAAS inhibitors, ARB and ACEi were used in 1154 (31.3%) and 998 (27.1%) patients,

115

respectively, and no patient received a renin-inhibitor. In 826 patients (22.4%) no

116

antihypertensive treatment was identified.

117

In total, there were 853 (23.1%) all-cause in-hospital 30-day deaths. Patients who died were

118

older and there were more likely to be men, compared to survivors. They also had chronic

119

diseases more frequently, except for respiratory diseases and obesity. The risk of mortality

120

was lower in CCB (aOR, 0.83 [0.70-0.99]) and beta-blockers users (aOR, 0.80 [0.67-0.95]),

121

and non-significant in ARB (aOR, 0.88 [0.72-1.06]) and ACEi users (aOR, 0.83 [0.68-1.02]),

122

compared to non-users (Figure 1, Suppl. Table S3).

DISCUSSION

126

This study, one of the largest multicenter retrospective to date on more than 3600 hospitalized

127

Covid-19 patients with hypertension, provides two main findings. First, based on more than

128

2,000 patients exposed to RAAS inhibitors, there is no association with the use of ACEi or

129

ARB and the risk of in-hospital death. Second, there is a significant protective effect of

130

calcium-channel blockers (CCB) or beta-blocker use on the risk of death in hypertensive

131

patients with Covid-19.

132

Hypertension and cardiovascular comorbidities have been previously reported as risk factors

133

for severe disease and fatal outcome.1,10,11 The underlying pathogenic mechanisms of these

134

comorbidities remain unclear and may involve the RAAS as being a double-edged sword. On

135

one hand, RAAS inhibitors increase the expression of ACE2, which could promote virus

136

entry.3 On the other hand, RAAS inhibitors, especially ARB, could reverse deleterious effects

137

of unopposed angiotensin II accumulation resulting from ACE2 down-regulation associated to

138

SARS-CoV-2 entry in cells.4,12 Clinical evidence based on a large study including 12,594

139

tested patients for SARS-CoV-2 showed no increase of likelihood to have a positive test

140

among RAAS users.13 Furthermore, in line with our findings, a meta-analysis on four

141

retrospective studies that include 921 ACEi or ARB users found no difference in risk of death

142

compared to non-users (OR, 0.88 [0.68-1.14]).14

143

In our study, we found that CCB and beta-blockers were more frequently used in survivors

144

(OR 0.83 [0.70-0.99] and 0.80 [0.67-0.95], respectively) than in non-survivors. These findings

145

were statistically significant. Previous Covid-19 cohort studies did not found any beneficial or

146

deleterious effect of CCB use on Covid-19 severity or mortality.7,15 However, these studies

147

included few CCB users and were probably lacking power. Recently, an in vitro study on an

148

emerging porcine coronavirus showed that CCB could prevent from infection and intracellular

149

calcium homeostasis dysregulation.16 Regarding beta-blockers, one could hypothesizes that

150

they can counteract deleterious sympathetic activation during the SARS-CoV-2 induced

151

cytokine storm and severe disease. Further clinical data are needed to explore these early

152

findings.

153

Our study has some limitations. First, in this retrospective observational design on

154

hospitalized Covid-19 patients, hypertension or antihypertensive exposure could have affected

155

the chance of hospitalization, which may limit the generalizability of our results. Second,

156

although analyses were adjusted on major comorbidities, some unmeasured or unknown

157

confounders may have not been ruled out, including indication bias. Finally, ascertainment of

158

medication use from EHRs may not capture all drug prescriptions and not reflect actual drug

159

exposure. However, considering antihypertensive agents are chronic treatments, we consider

160

exposure to these drugs up to six months prior to hospitalization for Covid-19.

161
162

CONCLUSION

163

In summary, we did not find any association between the use of RAAS inhibitors and the risk

164

of in-hospital death in Covid-19 patients with hypertension. Interestingly we found a reduced

165

mortality among CCB and beta-blockers users. Further studies are needed to confirm this

166

protective role. Our findings, such as previous reports, support the continuation of

167

antihypertensive agents in Covid-19 patients, in line with the current guidelines.
