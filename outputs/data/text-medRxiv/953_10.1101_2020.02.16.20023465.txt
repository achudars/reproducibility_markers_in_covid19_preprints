The outbreak of novel coronavirus-caused pneumonia (COVID-19) in Wuhan has
attracted worldwide attention. Here, we propose a generalized SEIR model to analyze
this epidemic. Based on the public data of National Health Commission of China
from Jan. 20th to Feb. 9th, 2020, we reliably estimate key epidemic parameters
and make predictions on the inflection point and possible ending time for 5 different
regions. According to optimistic estimation, the epidemics in Beijing and Shanghai
will end soon within two weeks, while for most part of China, including the majority
of cities in Hubei province, the success of anti-epidemic will be no later than the
middle of March. The situation in Wuhan is still very severe, at least based on public
data until Feb. 15th. We expect it will end up at the beginning of April. Moreover,
by inverse inference, we find the outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland, Hubei province
and Wuhan all can be dated back to the end of December 2019, and the doubling
time is around two days at the early stage.

INTRODUCTION
A novel coronavirus, formerly called 2019-nCoV, or SARS-CoV-2 by ICTV (severe acute

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, by the International Committee on Taxonomy of
Viruses) caused an outbreak of atypical pneumonia, now officially called COVID-19 by
WHO (coronavirus disease 2019, by World Health Organization) first in Wuhan, Hubei
province in Dec., 2019 and then rapidly spread out in the whole China1 . As of 24:00 Feb.
13th, 2020 (Beijing Time), there are over 60, 000 reported cases (including more than 1,
000 death report) in China, among which, over 80% are from Hubei province and over 50%
from Wuhan city, the capital of Hubei province2,3 .
The central government of China as well as all local governments, including Hubei, has
tightened preventive measures to curb the spreading of COVID-19 since Jan. 2020. Many
cities in Hubei province have been locked down and many measures, such as tracing close contacts, quarantining infected cases, promoting social consensus on self-protection like wearing
face mask in public area, etc. However, until the finishing of this manuscript, the epidemic
is still ongoing and the daily confirmed cases maintain at a high level.
During this anti-epidemic battle, besides medical and biological research, theoretical studies based on either statistics or mathematical modeling may also play a non-negligible role
in understanding the epidemic characteristics of the outbreak, in forecasting the inflection
point and ending time, and in deciding the measures to curb the spreading.
For this purpose, in the early stage many efforts have been devoted to estimate key epidemic parameters, such as the basic reproduction number, doubling time and serial interval,
in which the statistics models are mainly used4–9 . Due to the limitation of detection methods and restricted diagnostic criteria, asymptomatic or mild patients are possibly excluded
from the confirmed cases. To this end, some methods have been proposed to estimate untraced contacts10 , undetected international cases11 , or the actual infected cases in Wuhan
and Hubei province based on statistics models12 , or the epidemic outside Hubei province
and overseas6,13–15 . With the improvement of clinic treatment of patients as well as more
strict methods stepped up for containing the spread, many researchers investigate the effect
of such changes by statistical reasoning16,17 and stochastic simulation18,19 .
Compared with statistics methods20,21 , mathematical modeling based on dynamical
equations15,22–24 receive relatively less attention, though they can provide more detailed
2

mechanism for the epidemic dynamics. Among them, the classical susceptible exposed infectious recovered model (SEIR) is the most widely adopted one for characterizing the epidemic
of COVID-19 outbreak in both China and other countries25 . Based on SEIR model, one can
also assess the effectiveness of various measures since the outbreak23,24,26–28 , which seems to
be a difficult task for general statistics methods. SEIR model was also utilized to compare the
effects of lock-down of Hubei province on the transmission dynamics in Wuhan and Beijing29 .
As the dynamical model can reach interpretable conclusions on the outbreak, a cascade of
SEIR models are developed to simulate the processes of transmission from infection source,
hosts, reservoir to human30 . There are also notable generalizations of SEIR model for evaluation of the transmission risk and prediction of patient number, in which model, each group
is divided into two subpopulations, the quarantined and unquarantined23,24 . The extension
of classical SEIR model with delays31,32 is another routine to simulate the incubation period
and the period before recovery. However, due to the lack of official data and the change
of diagnostic caliber in the early stage of the outbreak, most early published models were
either too complicated to avoid the overfitting problem, or the parameters were estimated
based on limited and less accurate data, resulting in questionable predictions.
In this work, we carefully collect the epidemic data from the authoritative sources: the
National, provincial and municipal Health Commissions of China (abbreviated as NHC, see
e.g. http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) until the article is completed (Feb. 16th, 2020). Then we
follow the routine of dynamical modeling and focus on the epidemic of COVID-19 in five
most interested regions in China, i.e. the Mainland excluding Hubei province (denoted as
Mainland∗ ), Hubei province excluding Wuhan city (Hubei∗ ), Wuhan, Beijing and Shanghai.
Such a design aims to minimize the influence of Hubei province and Wuhan city on the data
set due to their extremely large infected populations compared to other regions. Without
further specific mention, these conventions will be adopted thorough the whole paper.
By generalizing the classical SEIR model, e.g. introducing a new quarantined state
and considering the effect of preventive measures, key epidemic parameters for COVID19, like the latent time, quarantine time and basic reproduction number are determined
in a relatively reliable way. The widely interested inflection point, ending time and total
infected cases in hot cities and regions are predicted and validated through both direct and
indirect evidences. Furthermore, by inverse inference, the starting date of this outbreak are
estimated. The analysis of other hot spots in China, as well as overseas countries are still

MODEL AND METHODS

A.

Generalized SEIR model

FIG. 1. The epidemic model for COVID-19. The highlighted part shows the classical SEIR model.

To characterize the epidemic of COVID-19 which outbroke in Wuhan at the end of
2019, we generalize the classical SEIR model23–29 by introducing seven different states, i.e.
{S(t), P (t), E(t), I(t), Q(t), R(t), D(t)} denoting at time t the respective number of the susceptible cases, insusceptible cases, exposed cases (infected but not yet be infectious, in a latent
period), infectious cases (with infectious capacity and not yet be quarantined), quarantined
cases (confirmed and infected), recovered cases and closed cases (or death). The adding of a
new quarantined sate is driven by data, which together with the recovery state takes replace
of the original R state in the classical SEIR model. Their relations are given in Fig. 1
and characterized by a group of ordinary differential equations (or difference equations if we
consider discrete time, see SI). Constant N = S + P + E + I + Q + R + D is the total population in a certain region. The coefficients {α, β, γ −1 , δ −1 , λ(t), κ(t)} represent the protection
rate, infection rate, average latent time, average quarantine time, cure rate, and mortality
rate, separately. Especially, to take the improvement of public health into account, such as
promoting wearing face masks, more effective contact tracing and more strict locking-down

of communities, we assume that the susceptible population is stably decreasing and thus
introduce a positive protection rate α into the model. In this case, the basic reproduction
number becomes BRN = β ∗ δ −1 ∗ (1 − α)T , T is the number of days.
It is noted that here we assume the cure rate λ and the mortality rate κ are both time
dependent. As confirmed in Fig. 2a-d, the cure rate λ(t) is gradually increasing with the
time, while the mortality rate κ(t) quickly decreases to less than 1% and becomes stabilized
after Jan. 30th. This phenomenon is likely raised by the assistance of other emergency
medical teams, the application of new drugs, etc. Furthermore, the average contact number
of an infectious person is calculated in Fig. 2e-f and could provide some clue on the infection
rate. It is clearly seen that the average contact number is basically stable over time, but
shows a remarkable difference among various regions, which could be attributed to different
quarantine policies and implements inside and outside Hubei (or Wuhan), since a less severe
region is more likely to inquiry the close contacts of a confirmed case. A similar regional
difference is observed for the severe condition rate too. In Fig. 2g-h, Hubei and Wuhan
overall show a much higher severe condition rate than Shanghai. Although it is generally
expected that the patients need a period of time to become infectious, to be quarantined,
or to be recovered from illness, but we do not find a strong evidence for the necessity of
including time delay (see SI for more details). As a result, the time-delayed equations are
not considered in the current work for simplicity.

B.

Parameter estimation
According to the daily official reports of NHC of China, the cumulative numbers of

quarantined cases, recovered cases and closed cases are available in public. However, since
the latter two are directly related to the first one through the time dependent recovery rate
and mortality rate, the numbers of quarantined cases Q(t) plays a key role in our modeling.
A similar argument applies to the number of insusceptible cases too. Furthermore, as the
accurate numbers of exposed cases and infectious cases are very hard to determine, they will
be treated as hidden variables during the study.
Leaving alone the time dependent parameters λ(t) and κ(t), there are four unknown
coefficients {α, β, γ −1 , δ −1 } and two initial conditions {E0 , I0 } about the hidden variables
(other initial conditions are known from the data) have to be extracted from the time series

FIG. 2. (Color online) (a)-(b) The cure rate λ, (c)-(d) mortality rate κ, (e)-(f) average close
contacts, and (g)-(h) severe condition rate (see SI for their definitions) are calculated based on

Hubei∗ , Wuhan, Beijing and Shanghai separately.

data {Q(t)}. Such an optimization problem could be solved automatically by using the
simulating annealing algorithm (see SI for details). A major difficulty is how to overcome
the overfitting problem.
To this end, we firstly prefix the latent time γ −1 , which is generally estimated within
several days5,33,34 . And then for each fixed γ −1 , we explore its influence on other parameters
(β = 1 nearly unchanged), initial values, as well as the population dynamics of quarantined
cases and infected cases during best fitting. From Fig. 3a-b, to produce the same outcome,
the protection rate α and the reciprocal of the quarantine time δ −1 are both decreasing
with the latent time γ −1 , which is consistent with the fact that longer latent time requires
longer quarantine time. Meanwhile, the initial values of exposed cases and infectious cases
are increasing with the latent time. Since E0 and I0 include asymptomatic patients, they
both should be larger than the number of quarantined cases. Furthermore, as the time
period between the starting date of our simulation (Jan. 20th) and the initial outbreak of
COVID-19 (generally believed to be earlier than Jan. 1st) is much longer than the latent
time (3-6 days), E0 and I0 have to be close to each other, which makes only their sum E0 +I0

matters during the fitting. An additional important finding is that in all cases β is always
very close to 1, which agrees with the observation that COVID-19 has an extremely strong
infectious ability. Nearly every unprotected person will be infected after a direct contact
with the COVID-19 patients5,33,34 .
As a summary, we conclude that once the latent time γ −1 is fixed, the fitting accuracy
on the time series data {Q(t)} basically depends on the values of α, δ −1 and E0 + I0 . And
based on a reasonable estimation on the total number of infected cases (see Fig. 3c-d), the
latent time is finally determined as 2 days.

C.

Sensitivity analysis
In order to further evaluate the influence of other fitting parameters on the long-term

forecast, we perform sensitivity analysis on the data of Wuhan (results for other regions are
similar and not shown) by systematically varying the values of unknown coefficients35,36 .
As shown in Fig. 3e-f, the predicted total infected cases at the end of epidemic, as well
as the the inflection point, at which the basic reproduction number is less than 16 , both
show a positive correlation with the infection rate β and the quarantined time δ −1 and a
negative correlation with the protection rate α. These facts agree with the common sense
and highlight the necessity of self-protection (increase α and decrease β), timely disinfection
(increase α and decrease β), early quarantine (decrease δ −1 ), etc. An exception is found
for the initial total infected cases. Although a larger value of E0 + I0 could substantially
increase the final total infected cases, it shows no impact on the inflection point, which could
be learnt from the formula of basic reproduction number.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A.

Interpretation of the public data
We apply our pre-described generalized SEIR model to interpret the public data on the

cumulative numbers of quarantined cases, recovered cases and closed cases from Jan. 20th to
Feb. 9th, which are published daily by NHC of China since Jan. 20th. Our preliminary study
includes five different regions, i.e. the Mainland∗ , Hubei∗ , Wuhan, Beijing and Shanghai.
Through extensive simulations, the optimal values for unknown model parameters and

initial conditions, which best explain the observed cumulative numbers of quarantined cases,
recovered cases and closed cases (see Fig. 4), are determined and summarized in Table 1.
There are several remarkable facts could be immediately learnt from Table 1. Firstly, the
protection rate of Wuhan is significantly lower than other regions, showing many infected
cases may not yet be well quarantined until Feb. 9th (the smaller α for Wuhan does not
necessarily mean people in Wuhan pay less attention to self-protection, but more likely due
to the higher mixing ratio of susceptible cases with infectious cases). Similarly, although
the average protection rate for Hubei∗ is higher than that of Wuhan, it is still significantly
lower than other regions. Secondly, the quarantine time for Beijing and Shanghai are the

shortest, that for Mainland∗ is in between. Again, the quarantine time for Wuhan and
Hubei∗ are the longest. Finally, the estimated number of total infected cases on Jan. 20th
in five regions are all significantly larger than one, suggesting the COVID-19 has already
spread out nationwide at that moment. We will come back to this point in the next part.

B.

Forecast for the epidemic of COVID-19
Most importantly, with the model and parameters in hand, we can carry out simulations

for a longer time and forecast the potential tendency of the COVID-19 epidemic. In Fig.
4 and Fig. 5a-b, the predicted cumulative number of quarantined cases and the current
number of exposed cases plus infectious cases are plotted for next 30 days as well as for
a shorter period of next 13 days. Official published data by NHC of China from Feb.
10th to 15th are marked in red spots and taken as a direct validation. Overall, except
Wuhan, the validation data show a well agreement with our forecast and all fall into the
95% confidence interval (shaded area). And we are delighted to see most of them are lower
than our predictions, showing the nationwide anti-epidemic measures in China come into
play. While for Wuhan city (and also Hubei province), due to the inclusion of suspected
cases with clinical diagnosis into confirmed cases (12364 cases for Wuhan and 968 cases for
Hubei∗ on Feb. 12th) announced by NHC of China since Feb. 12th during the preparation
of our manuscript, there is a sudden jump in the quarantined cases. Although it to some

extent offsets our original overestimates, it also reveals the current severe situation in Wuhan
city, which requires much closer attention in the future.
Towards the epidemic of COVID-19, our basic predictions are summarized as follows:
1. Based on optimistic estimation, the epidemic of COVID-19 in Beijing and Shanghai
would soon be ended within two weeks (since Feb. 15th). While for most parts of
mainland, the success of anti-epidemic will be no later than the middle of March. The
situation in Wuhan is still very severe, at least based on public data until Feb. 15th.
We expect it will end up at the beginning of April.
2. The estimated final total infected cases (not only total quarantined cases) for Beijing
and Shanghai will be around four hundred. This number is about 13-16 thousand
for mainland (exclude Hubei province), 20-26 thousand for Hubei province (exclude
Wuhan city) and 55 thousand for Wuhan city.
3. According to the basic reproduction number, the inflection date for Beijing, Shanghai,
mainland (exclude Hubei) is around Jan. 30th, which is close to the reported Feb. 3rd
for the last one based on daily new confirmed cases. The inflection point for Hubei
province (exclude Wuhan city) agrees with the reported Feb. 5th. These facts indicate
that the epidemic is now under control in most cities in China.
4. The inflection point for Wuhan city is determined as Feb. 12th (data after Feb. 9th
are not included into parameter estimation). By coincidence, on the same day, we
witnessed a sudden jump in the number of confirmed cases due to a relaxed diagnosis
caliber, meaning more suspected cases will receive better medical care and have much
lower chances to spread virus. Besides, Wuhan local government announced the completion of community survey on all confirmed cases, suspected cases and close contacts
in the whole city.

C.

Inverse inference on the epidemic of COVID-19
Besides the forecast, the early trajectory of the COVID-19 outbreak is also critical for

our understanding on its epidemic as well as future prevention. To this end, by adopting
the shooting method, we carry out inverse inference to explore the early epidemic dynamics
10

of COVID-19 since its onset in Mainland∗ , Hubei∗ , and Wuhan (Beijing and Shanghai are
not considered due to their too small numbers of infected cases on Jan. 20th). With respect
to the parameters and initial conditions listed in Table 1, we make an astonishing finding
that, for all three cases, the outbreaks of COVID-19 all point to 20-25 days before Jan. 20th
(the starting date for public data and our modeling). It means the epidemic of COVID-19
in these regions is no later than Jan. 1st (see Fig. 5d), in agreement with reports by Li
et al.5,33,34 . And in this stage (from Jan. 1st to Jan. 20th), the number of total infected
cases follows a nice exponential curve with the doubling time around 2 days. This in some
way explains why statistics studies with either exponential functions or logistic models could
work very well on early limited data points. Furthermore, we notice the number of infected
cases based on inverse inference is much larger than the reported confirmed cases in Wuhan
city before Jan. 20th.

4.

CONCLUSION
In this study, we propose a generalized SEIR model to analyze the epidemic of COVID-19,

which was firstly reported in Wuhan last December and then quickly spread out nationwide
in China. Our model properly incorporates the intrinsic impact of hidden exposed and
infectious cases on the entire procedure of epidemic, which is difficult for traditional statistics
analysis. A new quarantined state, together with the recovery state, takes replace of the
original R state in the classical SEIR model and correctly accounts for the daily reported
confirmed infected cases and recovered cases.
Based on detailed analysis of the public data of NHC of China from Jan. 20th to Feb.
9th, we estimate several key parameters for COVID-19, like the latent time, the quarantine
time and the basic reproduction number in a relatively reliable way, and predict the inflection point, possible ending time and final total infected cases for Hubei, Wuhan, Beijing,
Shanghai, etc. Overall, the epidemic situations for Beijing and Shanghai are optimistic,
which are expected to end up within two weeks (from Feb. 15th, 2020). Meanwhile, for
most parts of mainland including the majority of cities in Hubei province, it will be no later
than the middle of March. We should also point out that the situation in Wuhan city is still
very severe. More effective policies and more efforts on medical care and clinical research are
eagerly needed. We expect the final success of anti-epidemic will be reached at the beginning

of this April.
Furthermore, by inverse inference, we find that the outbreak of this epidemic in Mainland,
Hubei, and Wuhan can all be dated back to 20-25 days ago with respect to Jan. 20th, in
other words the end of Dec. 2019, which is consistent with public reports. Although we
lack the knowledge on the first infected case, our inverse inference may still be helpful for
understanding the epidemic of COVID-19 and preventing similar virus in the future.
