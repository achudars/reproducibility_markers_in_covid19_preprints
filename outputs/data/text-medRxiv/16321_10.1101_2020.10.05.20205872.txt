1. Abstract:

Background: Surveillance of COVID infection and isolation of infected individuals is one
of the available tools to control the spread of SAR-CoV-2. Asymptomatic and pre
symptomatic are responsible for substantial transmission. RNA or antigen tests are
necessary to identify non-symptomatic individuals. We tested the feasibility of using
samples pooling offering different collection alternatives (swab/throat wash/saliva) to
volunteers of a public health institute.
Methods: We evaluated pool samples from frozen material from previously tested
samples and a prospective collection from asymptomatic volunteers. Some collections
were paired for comparison. Pools and some individual samples were extracted with
QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, USA) and/or

Lucigen Quick Extract DNA

extraction solution (BioSearch, USA) and submitted to rtPCR

(Allplex, Seegene,

Korea).
Results: A total of 240 samples from 130 new collections and 37 samples with known
result were evaluated. Pool CT was generally higher than individual samples. Lucigen
extraction showed higher CT, including false negative results for samples with high CT
at Qiagen extraction. Paired Swab and TW samples showed comparable results. No
volunteer from negative pools reported any symptom in the 2-3 days after collection.
Conclusions: Clinical samples pooling to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA is feasible and an
economical way to test for COVID-19, especially in surveillance strategies targeting
more infectiousness, higher viremia individuals. The use of Lucigen reagents show
lower sensibility that may lead to false negative results with lower viremia samples.
Combining throat wash with saliva may provide and interesting self-collection
alternative, but more comparative work is needed.

2. Introduction

Sars-Cov-2 emergence from a zoonotic transmission (Gorbalenya 2020) has
imposed marked social, medical and economical adaptations to the world since its
description early in 2020. At the end of September, in less than a year of its
recognition, over one million deaths have been associated to the COVID-19 pandemic
(WHO 2020).
Although the pandemic shows signs of relative control in parts of the world,
recrudescence is a constant threat, and it’s been observed in many areas (WHO 2020)
specially were cases are still more substantial and surveillance suboptimal. Different
vaccines products are in an advance state of development (WHO 2020b) and many
show evidence of immunogenicity (reviewed by Alturki 2020), but the actual efficacy is
not yet determined. Real world effectiveness will depend in different aspects that varied
form general conditions, as type of cold chain needed, to more specify aspects as
distinct populations response. Some crucial issues, as the durability of protection, will
only be proper evaluated with time. Therefore, surveillance strategies, even in a postvaccine era, will still be needed.
Circulation of an infected person and subsequent exposed of a susceptible
individual to the virus, from exhaled air or fomites, surfaces with infectious particles
from infected individuals, are the motor of the pandemic. Due to the lack of information
on what constitutes immunity to infection or the durability of immunity in recovered
cases (Hellestein 2020), all individuals may be considered at least partially susceptible
to infection, even those with prior evidence of infection. Cumulative data since early in
the epidemic have suggested that a window of about a week or two, starting 1-2 days
before symptoms, a period associated to high viremia in the airways, is responsible for
much of the transmission (He 2020). A major deterrent to surveillance is the fact that
asymptomatic individuals, along with pre symptomatic cases, are responsible for many
infections (reviewed by Huff & Singh, 2020). Association of transmission to higher
viremia levels (La Scola 2020, Larremore 2020) suggests that even tests less sensible
than the current real-time PCR (rt-qPCR) tests may be useful to curb transmission.
The development of point of care, easy to apply tests to detect viral antigens or nucleic
acid will be necessary to easy life constrains in a no-vaccine or partially effective
vaccine world. Antigen tests may soon work as a surrogate to this situation. Tests that

identifies infectiousness; more than viral components are urgently needed. These tests
are neither available or are too costly to most of the population, so we must resort to
current tools.
One of the limitations of current standard test is the need of a health care
worker, with proper PPE to collect a nasopharyngeal swab. Self-swab collection, along
with alternative collection strategies, as saliva and throat wash, has provided some
flexibility. With the growing literature on saliva detection (Azzy 2020, Khurshid 2020,
Wyllie 2020) and in throat wash efficiency for obtaining viral RNA (Saito 2020, Ali
2020), combining the methods seems adequate.
We introduced a voluntary throat wash plus saliva collection, offered to
asymptomatic individuals from different areas of the institute, and tested the feasibility
of using samples pooling (Abdalhamid 2020, Singh 2020, Yelin 2020) to minimize
reagents and equipment use.

3. Methods
We evaluated pool samples both from reconstituted material from previous positive and
negative tests and a prospective collection of asymptomatic volunteers.
3.1 Reconstituted pools
A total of 6 pools were prepared from frozen samples previously tested individually,
obtained by nasopharyngeal (NP) swab or throat wash, prepared according to
description below:
1st Pool size of 10 samples: used 100 uL of each of the 10 negative samples
(Lucigen), for a final volume of 1mL;
2nd Pool size of 10 samples: used 100 uL of each of the 03 samples of positive
patients added to 100 uL of each of the 07 samples of negative patients, for a final
volume of 1mL;
3rd Pool with size of 10 samples: used 100uL of each of the 02 positive samples added
to 100uL of each of the 8 negative patient samples, for a final volume of 1mL;

4th Pool size of 10 samples: used 100 uL of 01 positive sample added to 100 uL of
each of the 09 negative samples, for a final volume of 1mL;
5th Pool size of 05 samples: used 100uL of 01 positive sample added to 100uL of the
first 04 samples of the 4th Pool, for a final volume of 500uL;
6th Pool size of 05 samples: used 100uL of 01 positive sample added to 100uL of the
04 remaining samples of the 4th Pool, for a final volume of 500uL.
3.2 Prospective pools
Pools were also obtained from samples collected prospectively from volunteers, health
workers from the institute, as described in Figure 1 (flowchart).

Volunteers received a 5 mL cold saline (4-8 ºC) in a 50 mL falcon-like tube and were
oriented to perform a 5+ seconds gargle in an outside place, with safe distance from
other people, followed by addition of 3-5 mL of saliva to the same tube, that was
returned and kept cold or frozen (-20 ºC) if not processed in the same day. Standard
nasopharyngeal (NP) swab were obtained in a set of volunteers for comparison.
Samples were aliquoted in a BSL-2 cabinet and pool of 3 to 12 individuals were
prepared.
Pool samples were thereafter processed together with other clinical specimens
following the Institute´s routine processed on the same day, with extraction using either
QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, USA) according to manufacturer instruction or
Lucigen Quick Extract DNA extraction solution (BioSearch, USA), v/v with 40 uL of
sample, followed by heating at 95 ºC for 5 min and ice cooling. The sample were
submitted to rt-qPCR using similar routine protocols (Allplex, Seegene, Korea), with
amplification of three viral targets (E, RdRp and N) considered positive, with Human
RNAse P as control. Cycle thresholds (CT) up to 37 were considered valid. In some
runs, as for confirmation, the CT for the N region was the only available CT.

3. Results

3.1.

Reconstituted pools

All samples selected originated from swab or throat wash collections tested in the
institute with routine protocols, extracted with either Qiagen or Lucigen : 3 positive and
34 negative. Six pools were prepared, 4 of 10 samples and 2 with 5 samples. Pools
were prepared with one or more positive samples with seven or more negative samples
at the total of 10 samples per pool. The weaker control was further tested alone at two
5 samples pool, using different in negative samples, as shown in Table 1 and Table 2
shows combinations used to prepare pool.

Pools were tested both from Qiagen and Lucigen extracted RNA, and this results,
along with individual positive control samples, are shown in table 2. Poll one, prepared
as a negative control with Lucigen negative samples (LNS), gave a positive result in
the Qiagen extraction procedure, the individual sample form this pool were then retested after Qiagen extraction, as described in Table 3.

Prospective pools

A total of 130 workers were tested, 83% females with a median of 47 of age (IQR 3757), from the BioMedical, chemistry, administrative and outsourced areas. Thirty-four
(26%) collected only TW, 12 (9%) collected only saliva, 22 (17%) individuals collected
paired Saliva and swab samples, and 62 (48%) paired TW and swabs in a total of 214
collections from 130 volunteers.

Samples were analyzed in 32 pools of 3-12

individuals each and tested using both Qiagen and Lucigen extracted RNA kits
reagents.
All but two polls tested negative after Qiagen extraction and were not further
processed. No volunteer from these pools reported any symptom in the 2-3 days after
collection. Two pools from a same 6 individuals group, tested positive both in swab and
TW collections. Results are shown in Table 4.

4. Discussion

In this small study, we documented the feasibility of performing an economical, easy to
collect sampling of asymptomatic health care workers, analyzed in small pools (3-12) of
clinical samples. Early morning collection allowed prompt processing, extraction and rtqPCR test, providing pool results early in afternoon, with individual test of positive pool
executed in an afternoon run that provided results around 7 P.M. on the same day.
This swift process allowed the results to rt-qPCR individual in a short time, favoring
social isolation and other pertinent attitudes.
Apart from the pooling process and contact to positive individual, the procedures
involved are not different from usual routine steps, and the ability to perform the
process in a swift way depends mostly in logistic and additional work load related
mostly to pooling and sample identification steps. On the other hand, not only the
relative high cost, especially to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC) of
equipment and specialized molecular biology work force, but also the current limitations
of these resources, as well as key reagents and demand for rt-qPCR machines, may
suggest an important cost-effective advantage to the pooling option. We used relative
small pools so we could process and give results in a same-day results, but some
groups suggest larger pools, up to 32 individuals (Yelin 2020). Recently the FDA has
recently stimulated the evaluation of pooling strategies (FDA 2020) .
One major drawback in pooling procedure is the number of times one will need to
break a pool to identify one or more positive cases. In epidemiological scenarios with

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.05.20205872; this version posted October 7, 2020. The copyright holder for this

high prevalence, pooling may not be attractive, but in low prevalence scenarios, as
among asymptomatic monitoring in environments were infection is not yet rampant
(Yates, 2020).
Pooling can provide cost effective surveillance and may actually increase testing
capacity. Moreover, in some situations, pooling could be used to identify viral
circulation, and the individual identification step could be omitted. This is especially true
for pooling test of related people, as part of a same “epidemiological bubble”. For
example, in some school returning activity, one positive test in a cohort of students may
lead to home activities, for a couple of weeks, for all the group part of the pool, even in
negative cases identified in individual pool partisans analysis. The current
recommendation to isolate after contact to an infected person, so this may apply to all
pool member when pools are constructed with interacting people. .
The quarantine decision therefore may be based in the pool result itself, and does not
depend on individual test. Although knowing the individual results is legitimate, in the
public health perspective participants in a pool that are not involved in essential work
may be quarantined when in close contact to an infected case unrestricted of the
individual result.
With the lack of objective intervention for asymptomatic and mild disease, and the fact
that a more severe clinical setting demands attention, even if testing negative at the
sample used for the pool or tested negative individually, it may be reasonable to use
pooling without individual identification in a resource limited setting, that today is not
uncommon even in some wealth nations.
The characteristics of which individual should participate in a same pool in a point that
may deserve attention. We tested here mostly people that had some relationship at
work, as having similar activity or sharing rooms or some other kind of epidemiological
link. If a pool includes only specialized people that provide essential work, it may be
disruptive for the working activities to quarantine all pooling participants. In the other
hand, if 4-6 workers that share some essential work activity are split in different pools, if
one pool test positive, even before the individual test of the reactive pool, at least some
workers may be available to perform the tasks.

The pooling strategies should be

customized to each epidemiological scenario and take into account the planned steps
to take in case of positive pool tests.

Polling dilutes the viremia increased the CT, and the detection of low viremia cases
may be compromised. Those however are not the key targets of prevention as their
infectiousness is more limited (Larremore 2020, La Scola 2020). The use of Lucigen
with heat treatment to have access to RNA for rt-qPCR, bypassing an extraction step,
is simpler, cheaper and feasible, but as can be bring important increases the CT. Test
for lower viremia cases, may therefore not be detected and tested as false negative
without adequate extraction. In the current reagent limitations, and considering that fact
that cases with lower viremia, (that is high CT) are not good transmitters ( He 2020, La
Scola 2020) , makes its use acceptable especially in a public heath perspective, but
this limitations must be taken into consideration when interpreting results from this
alternative procedure.
Our work is based mostly in TW enriched with saliva. Actually, it is almost impossible
guarantee a throat wash that is not “contaminated” with some saliva, and we only
stimulated that more saliva is added to the TW tube. As the first step in some saliva
protocols is to dilute it to make processing easier (Vaz 2020), the TW saline may act as
a diluent for saliva, with the advantage to bring into the reaction more viral RNA. A
combination of these methods seems interesting and TW may add to saliva based
testing whenever the patient can and is willing to perform gargle and an adequate area
(open air, far from others) is available. This addition is not proved yet to be relevant
and saliva may perform as well. It is moreover recommended were gargle is not
feasible, as for young children and at close environments.

5. Conclusion

Clinical samples pooling, followed by RNA extraction and routine protocols to detect
SARS-CoV-2 RNA may allow increasing in the testing capability without stressing the
current limitations. Although pooling may decrease sensibility, it may identify more
infectious individuals and allow more frequent testing for more individuals, being a
feasible, economical way to test for COVID-19 for surveillance strategies. The use of
Lucigen reagents lead to a decrease in the sensibility that may lead to false negative
results with lower viremia (higher CT) samples. Combining throat wash with saliva may
increase viral recovery, but more comparative work is needed.
