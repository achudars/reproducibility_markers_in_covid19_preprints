INTRODUCTION
The global community is rapidly mobilizing to develop and license vaccines to prevent SARS-CoV-2
infection. While the timely development and manufacture of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is a public health
imperative, vaccines will have to be deployed rapidly and globally to provide the greatest impact. Health
care system workers are at high-risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 [1], and maintaining essential health
services is critical during a pandemic. Likewise, older adults and adults with chronic medical conditions
are at the greatest risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 disease [1]. Any global pandemic vaccine response will
rely on existing immunization infrastructures to reach adult target groups [2].
While the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends several vaccines for use by adults, global
immunization efforts have traditionally focused on young children. Since 1974, the Expanded Programme
on Immunization (EPI) has been the major platform for vaccine delivery in low-income countries (LICs)
and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) [3]. Built on the global smallpox eradication infrastructure,
EPI originally included four vaccines against six infectious diseases administered in the first year of life:
bacille Calmette-Guerin, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, polio, and measles vaccines [3]. Since then, EPI has
been expanded to include several additional vaccines, with most vaccines still targeting children in the
first two years of life [4]. Exceptions include maternal tetanus toxoid vaccination in settings where routine
paediatric tetanus immunization is suboptimal and where maternal and neonatal tetanus have not been
eliminated [5] and human papillomavirus vaccines (HPV) targeting girls aged nine to 14 years [6]. WHO
also recommends additional vaccines for adults in regions where certain diseases are endemic (such as
Japanese encephalitis and yellow fever vaccines), in high-risk populations (such as influenza and rabies
vaccines), and under special circumstances (such as in outbreak settings with vaccines against Ebola virus
disease, cholera, or yellow fever) [4].
To better understand the status of national immunization programs targeting adults globally, we reviewed
2018 adult immunization data reported by countries through the Joint Reporting Form on Immunization

(JRF) to WHO and UNICEF. We chose five routine vaccines licensed for adult immunization: hepatitis B
vaccine (HepB), herpes zoster vaccine (HZV), influenza vaccine, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine
(PCV), and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) (Table 1). We chose not to review adult
programs for booster doses of routine childhood vaccines, vaccines that target regional endemic
infections, or those that are used primarily in outbreak settings. Our objectives were to identify countries
with routine adult immunization programs, to determine factors associated with having those programs,
and to identify factors that could be addressed in order to strengthen the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic vaccine
response.
METHODS
Primary data source
We collected data on national adult immunization programs from the JRF [7]. The JRF is a monitoring
and evaluation tool that collects national administrative information regarding estimates of immunization
coverage, reported cases of vaccine-preventable diseases, immunization schedules, and vaccination
campaigns, as well as indicators of immunization system performance and financing [8]. The JRF is the
only database of its type to include country-level data on immunization programs globally, making it the
only dataset to our knowledge that would permit a global analysis of adult immunization programs. We
accessed the 2018 JRF database on 12 February 2020, and collected country data on the presence of adult
immunization programs for HepB, HZV, influenza vaccine, PCV, and PPSV. To assess whether countries
are adopting global mandates for new vaccine introductions, we identified countries that had introduced
rotavirus vaccine, HPV, or HepB. Rotavirus vaccine and HPV vaccines are considered “new or
underutilized” and their introduction is prioritized by the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP). Birth dose
HepB is recommended by WHO, but has lower coverage than most other vaccines in the EPI schedule, so
we also included birth dose HepB as an indicator for adoption of recommended vaccination programs. To
assess the general strength of routine immunization, we classified countries according to whether they had

achieved the GVAP goals of maternal and neonatal tetanus elimination (less than one case of neonatal
tetanus per 1,000 live births in every district of a country) [9] and whether they had achieved ≥95%
national coverage of the third dose of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis containing vaccine (DTP3) per
WHO/UNICEF estimates [10]. To evaluate the capacity to make national decisions about vaccination
programs, we used WHO data indicating whether countries had achieved WHO-defined process
indicators for National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs) [9, 11]. NITAGs achieving
these indicators (called “functional NITAGs”) have the following characteristics: 1) legislative or
administrative basis for the advisory group; 2) formal written terms of reference; 3) at least five different
areas of expertise represented among core members; 4) at least one meeting per year; 5) circulation of the
agenda and background documents at least one week prior to meetings, and; 6) mandatory disclosure of
any conflict of interest.
Questions in the 2018 JRF asked whether a country had adult programs for influenza vaccine, HepB,
HZV, or PPSV. No specific questions were included for adult PCV programs, but there were questions
about which groups were targeted for immunization with PCV with free-text fields for responses. For
PCV, when it was clear that adult age groups were targeted by a particular vaccination program (such as
when “adults,” “health care workers,” or persons aged “>65 years” were indicated), we considered that
the country had reported affirmatively that an adult program was present. For countries that did not
indicate the presence or absence of an adult immunization program in the JRF or that did not make clear
whether an adult group was targeted for vaccination (such as when “high-risk groups” was indicated), we
considered that the country did not report that an adult program was present.
Other data sources
We collected additional information to supplement the JRF data. To the extent possible, all covariate data
were also from 2018, the year of the JRF dataset. We sought relevant country immunization program
information from websites of WHO Regional Offices, and we requested information from immunization

staff in each WHO Regional Office. Regional Office immunization focal points are well-informed about
routine immunization programs in their regions, they are a part of the annual JRF data quality review, and
we considered their concurrence to country reports to be an important quality check for this project. We
also accessed immunization schedules for countries in the European Union from the European Centers for
Disease Control (ECDC) website [12]. Next, we collected country economic information. As lowresource countries often rely on financial support from Gavi (the Vaccine Alliance) for new vaccine
introduction, we identified all countries eligible for Gavi funding support in 2018 [13]. For per capita
health expenditures, we used World Bank data for 2016, and we classified country income categories
using the 2018 World Bank designations [14, 15]. For population analyses, we used 2017 population
estimates from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation [16].
Statistical analysis
Because countries are not required to record the absence of immunization programs in the JRF for all the
vaccines we analysed, we could only record affirmative responses for some vaccines. For analyses, we
used the number of relevant WHO Member States as denominators because we were unable to distinguish
country non-responses from negative responses. Further, PCV program questions are not specific for
adults. As many countries indicate presence of paediatric pneumococcal vaccination programs, we could
not simply exclude countries from a denominator if they did not respond to a pneumococcal vaccination
program question. For statistical analyses, income group was defined as a categorical variable, the
presence of adult immunization programs and health system/immunization program indicators were
defined as dichotomous variables, and per capita health expenditure was defined as a continuous variable.
We used descriptive statistics to describe countries with adult immunization programs. We conducted
bivariate analyses to determine whether certain health system/immunization program characteristics were
associated with the reported presence of any adult immunization program using χ2 tests for categorical
variables and Kruskal-Wallis tests for comparisons of medians. We calculated p-values for trends using
an extension of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) using multiple logistic

regression. The bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed on the complete global
dataset and specifically for the European Region. All statistical tests were two-sided, and p-values <0.05
were considered statistically significant. Analyses were conducted in Stata (version 15.1, StataCorp,
College Station, Texas). Human participants were not involved in this study, so institutional review board
approval was not required.
RESULTS
Data missingness
Among the 194 WHO Member States, 176 (90.7%) reported the presence or absence of a national adult
immunization program in the JRF for at least one of the five vaccines -- range by region: 6/11 (54.5%) in
South-East Asia to 35/35 (100.0%) in the Americas. Responses were available for 83 (42.8%) countries
on the presence of an adult vaccination program for HepB, 38 (19.6%) countries for HZV, 114 (58.8%)
countries for influenza vaccine, 157 (80.9%) countries for PCV, and 59 (30.4%) countries for PPSV.
Otherwise country JRF responses were missing (Supplemental Table 1). Our review of ECDC country
policy information identified 20 vaccine policies that were not reported in the 2018 JRF. Supporting
information subsequently obtained from WHO Regional websites and Regional Office immunization
program officers did not identify any new or conflicting data. Percentages of countries with particular
policies are presented as the number of countries reporting or identified through additional efforts to have
a particular vaccination programs as numerators, with all WHO Member States by geographic category as
denominators.
Programs globally and by region
Among the 194 WHO Member States, 71 (36.7%) countries reported having adult immunization
programs for HepB, 15 (8.8%) countries for HZV, 114 (58.8%) for influenza vaccine, 16 (8.3%) for PCV,
and 35 (18.0%)for PPSV (Table 2). A total of 120 (61.9%) countries reported having any of the five

assessed adult immunization programs, while 3 (2.5%) countries reported having programs for each of the
five vaccines studied (Greece, Italy, and the United States).
Adult vaccination program data by WHO Region are in Figure 1 and Table 2. In the African Region (47
countries), 5 (10.6%) countries reported at least one adult vaccination program. Three (6.4%) countries
reported HepB programs, and 3 (6.4%) countries reported influenza vaccination programs. The three
countries reporting influenza vaccination programs in the African Region (Algeria, South Africa, and
Mauritius) were not the same three reporting HepB programs (Eswatini, Kenya, and Mauritius). No
African countries reported adult vaccination programs for HZV, PCV, or PPSV. In the Americas (35
countries), 34 (97.1%) countries reported at least one adult vaccination program. American countries had
programs for PCV (2 countries; 5.7%), HZV (4 countries, 11.4%), PPSV (11 countries, 31.4%), HepB (31
countries, 88.6%), and influenza vaccine (32 countries, 91.4%). In the Eastern Mediterranean (21
countries), 14 (66.7%) countries reported at least one adult vaccination program. Eastern Mediterranean
countries had programs for HZV and PCV (1 country each, 4.8%), PPSV (2 countries, 9.5%), HepB (7
countries, 33.3%), and influenza vaccine (13 countries, 61.9%). In the European Region (53 countries),
50 (94.3%) countries reported at least one adult vaccination program. European countries had programs
for HZV (10 countries, 18.9%), PCV (12 countries, 22.6%), PPSV (18 countries, 34.0%), HepB (25
countries, 47.2%), and influenza vaccine (50 countries, 94.3%). In South-east Asia (11 countries), 1
(9.1%) country reported any adult vaccination program – an adult influenza vaccination program in
Thailand. No other South-east Asian countries reported programs for HepB, HZV, PCV, or PPSV. In the
Western Pacific (27 countries), 16 (59.3%) countries reported any adult vaccination program. Western
Pacific countries had programs for PCV (1 country, 3.7%), HZV (2 countries, 7.4%), PPSV (4 countries,
14.8%), HepB (5 countries, 18.5%), and influenza vaccine (15 countries, 55.6%).
We compared the populations of countries with and without adult vaccination programs. Globally, 38.7%
of the world’s population lives in a country reporting any adult vaccination program (Table 3). The
percentage of the world population living in countries reporting specific adult vaccination programs

includes the following: 13.3% for HepB, 9.0% for HZV, 36.7% for influenza vaccine, 30.9% for PCV,
and 19.1% for PPSV. The percentage of persons living in countries reporting any adult vaccination
program by WHO Region is 13.9% for the African Region, 98.8% for the Americas, 51.2% for the
Eastern Mediterranean Region, 97.2% for the European Region, 3.5% for the South-east Asian Region,
and 24.1% for the Western Pacific Region.
In bivariate analyses, economic indicators were highly associated with having an adult immunization
program (Figure 2 and Table 4). Countries classified by the World Bank as high- or upper-middle income
were more likely to have any adult immunization program than those classified as low- or lower-middle
income (p<0.001), and countries with any adult immunization program had higher median per capita
health expenditures compared to those without a program (p<0.001), with the same being true for the
individual adult vaccination programs (Supplemental Tables 2 and 3). Certain characteristics of the
national immunization system were also associated with a reported adult immunization program in the
JRF (Table 4). Compared to countries without any reported adult vaccination program, those countries
that reported any adult vaccination programs were more likely to have included the HepB birth dose in
their routine immunization schedule (94/120; 78.3%) vs. (34/74; 45.9%, p<0.001), to have eliminated
maternal and neonatal tetanus (120/120; 100% vs. 60/74; 81.1%, p<0.001), and to have achieved national
DTP3 coverage ≥95% (66/120; 55.0% vs. 18/74; 24.3%, p<0.001). Having introduced HPV was
associated with having at least one adult vaccination program (76/120; 46.3% vs. 14/74; 18.9%, p<0.001)
as well as with having each of the five individual adult vaccination programs (Supplemental Table 4). The
introduction of rotavirus vaccine was not associated with the presence of an adult vaccination program
(Table 3). Finally, countries reporting an adult vaccination program were more likely to have a functional
NITAG than those countries not reporting an adult vaccination program (82/120; 68.3% vs. 32/74; 43.2%,
p<0.001).
In a multiple logistic regression model including each of the binary national immunization system
indicators (≥95% DTP3 coverage, presence of a functioning NITAG, HepB birth dose, rotavirus vaccine,

and HPV vaccine), and adjusting for income category, (LIC/LMIC vs. upper-middle-income country
[UMIC]/ high-income country [HIC]), the presence of a functional NITAG (aOR 7.1, 95% confidence
interval (CI) 2.5, 20.7), the use of the HepB birth dose (aOR 3.6, 95% CI 1.4, 10.4), and the use of HPV
(aOR 3.9, 95% CI 4.3, 10.4) remained significantly associated with reporting an adult immunization
program (Supplemental Table 5). Country income status was the factor most strongly associated with
reporting an adult immunization program (aOR 21.9, 95% CI 7.3, 65.3) for HIC/UMIC countries
compared to LIC/LMIC countries. In a model limited to WHO Member States classified as LIC or LMIC,
the aOR for any adult immunization program was 12.0 (95% CI 2.3, 63.4) for countries with a functional
NITAG compared to those without, and the aOR for any adult immunization program was 5.9 (95% CI
1.5, 24.2) for countries that had included birth dose HepB in the EPI schedule compared to those that had
not. Multiple logistic regression models for the individual adult vaccination programs showed similar
trends (Supplemental Table 6).
To gain insight into adult immunization programs in the WHO European Region, we conducted bivariate
and multiple logistic regression analyses restricted to the 53 countries in that region. Of the 53 countries,
three had no adult vaccination program (Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan). In bivariate analyses,
countries with at least one adult vaccination program had greater median per capita health expenditures
compared to those without any adult program ($1,616 vs. $93, p<0.01 and were less likely to be Gavi
eligible (0/50; 0% vs. 2/3; 66.7%, <0.001) (Supplemental Table 7). Having introduced an HPV vaccine
was the only immunization program characteristic associated with having one or more adult vaccination
programs (35/50; 70.0% vs. 0/3; 33.3%, p=0.01). In multivariable analyses adjusting for rotavirus
introduction, having a functional NITAG, having DTP coverage ≥95% and HIC or UMIC country status),
the only characteristic significantly associated with having an adult vaccination program was being a HIC
or UMIC country (45/50; 90% vs. 1/3; 33.3%, aOR=37.3, 95% CI 1.5, 962.2) (Supplemental table 7). In
multivariable analyses of the individual adult vaccination programs, having introduced HPV was
independently associated with having an adult HepB program (20/25; 80% vs. 15/28; 53.6%, aOR=5.6,

1.2, 112.4). In the European Region, being a HIC or UMIC, rather than a LMIC, was independently
associated with having an adult influenza vaccination program (45/50; 90% vs. 1/3 33.3%, aOR=37.3 (1.4
vs. 962.2) (Supplemental Table 8).
CONCLUSIONS
In our review of the 2018 JRF, 61.9% of WHO Member States reported having any adult vaccination
programs, including countries from all WHO Regions and income categories. The most common adult
immunization program was for influenza vaccination, reported by 58.8% of countries, while adult
immunization programs for other vaccines were much less common. The number of adult influenza
immunization programs has increased from an analysis of the 2014 JRF, when 46% of countries reported
programs for adults with chronic disease and 45% reported programs for older adults [8]. In that analysis,
countries reporting influenza immunization programs were wealthier, and they were more likely to have
functional NITAGs, to have introduced new or under-utilized vaccines, and to have stronger
immunization systems. Our study documents and quantifies major limitations to routine adult
immunization programs globally and indicates that the trends seen for influenza vaccination are also true
for adult immunization in general. That 38.1% of countries worldwide lack functional systems to deliver
routine adult vaccinations has major implications for future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine deployment.
WHO immunization position papers are permissive toward national immunization programs for the adult
vaccines we assessed, indicating that countries may choose to target adults for immunization, but no
position paper mandates such programs. However, a 2017 WHO expert convening acknowledged that
there were data gaps hindering adult vaccination program policy-making globally, particularly in LICs
and LMICs [2]. Investment in studies to better measure disease burden and the potential impact of adult
immunization programs are needed to inform the value proposition of adult immunization in low resource
settings. Further, while global vaccine policy has often been driven by estimates of mortality prevention

or cost-effectiveness, the full impact of adult vaccine-preventable diseases may be better understood by
different metrics [2]. The impact on a community when older adults lose independence or functional
capacity after a vaccine-preventable illness is difficult to assess, and the value of missed unpaid work in
the home or as a child caregiver is seldom measured in economic analyses [17]. The presence of
favourable global programs for adult immunization is not sufficient to advance vaccination programs if
impact estimates undervalue older adults’ lives or their contributions.
While we do not necessarily advocate the expansion of routine adult immunization services into low- and
low-middle income country settings, such programs can provide public health value. In addition to the
direct impact of routine immunization, there are additional benefits of strong adult immunization
programs. For example, they can provide platforms for the delivery of other preventive interventions and
strengthen primary care [18]. They can enhance public health responses during public health emergencies
requiring supplemental immunization activities, such as the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In 2009,
having a seasonal influenza vaccination program was significantly associated with the deployment of
pandemic influenza vaccines when they were available [19]. This was attributed both to infrastructure
preparedness as well as individual attitudes regarding vaccination, both of which are enhanced when a
country has a functional adult influenza vaccination program [19]. Finally, strengthening countries’
capacities to provide immunization services across the life course should occur concurrent to the
development of new vaccines targeting adult age groups, so that delivery systems will be in place once
new vaccines become available.
A critical component to strong immunization systems is the NITAG, and we found an association
between adult immunization programs in countries and functional NITAGs. Within an individual country,
the NITAG plays a critical role in evaluating vaccines, interpreting available safety and efficacy data, and
applying relevant data to policy recommendations most appropriate for a given country. NITAGs may
consider targeting health care workers for influenza vaccination as the most logical first step to advancing
immunization in LICs and LMICs. There are existing platforms to transport, store, and deliver vaccines

within health care systems [20], the total population of health care workers is small compared to other
influenza risk groups, and sensitizing health care workers to the benefits of vaccination has effects on
their advocacy of vaccines to patients [21]. A healthy medical workforce is critical to ensuring that
essential health care services continue during disease epidemics.
This study should be interpreted in the context of its strengths and limitations. To our knowledge, the JRF
is the only global source of national immunization data and is therefore the only dataset that would permit
a quantification of global adult immunization programs. The survey is a routine public health instrument
that is completed annually by Ministries of Health with extensive quality checks at the regional and global
levels. It can be an important platform to monitor adult vaccine policy development over time. However,
the JRF relies on national self-reporting, and there may be errors introduced at the country level that
would be difficult to identify or correct. These data capture only what is recommended at the government
policy level, though may not describe vaccine use in the private sector. Further, the questions regarding
the presence of adult immunization programs, particularly for PCV, require free-text responses for
program target groups. WHO has moved to a web-based application to collect the 2019 JRF data, which
will provide opportunities to improve the questionnaire and decrease potential reporting bias. We believe
that engaging WHO Regional Office immunization focal points as a data quality check was a strength to
this study, as they are highly informed about the routine immunization programs within their regions and
are likely to know about any adult immunization programs, particularly in LICs and LMICs.
Finally, the presence of a national adult immunization program does not necessarily indicate substantial
vaccine use. For example, while Estonia has an influenza vaccination program targeting older adults, it
has reported only 2% vaccine coverage for this group in the 2016-2017 season [22]. In a 2015 review of
global influenza vaccine distribution, the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and
Associations estimated that about 95% of global influenza vaccine distribution occurs in the Americas,
European, and Western Pacific Regions [23], despite 17 countries reporting adult influenza vaccination
programs outside of those regions. While the JRF does collect information on influenza vaccination

coverage of older adults and persons with chronic medical conditions, there is substantial data
missingness making analyses of global influenza vaccine use in these risk groups infeasible [8]. Our
analysis determined whether routine national programs are in place to immunize adults, but it could not
ascertain whether systems are sufficient for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns.
If vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 become licensed, they will be deployed in many countries without adult
immunization infrastructures. Substantial resources will be needed to ensure the equitable distribution of
potentially life-saving vaccines to persons at high risk for severe disease and to protect essential workers.
In 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is disproportionately affecting older adults and is a threat to the
safety of health care workers [24], yet nearly 40% of countries globally have no immunization
infrastructures to provide adult vaccination, and nearly 60% of the world’s population lives in countries
without routine adult immunization programs. Further, WHO advises the use of influenza vaccine, where
feasible, for health care workers, older adults, and pregnant women during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic
[1]. The success of campaigns to deliver these vaccines is also threatened by lack of sufficient adult
immunization infrastructures. Systems for social mobilization and outreach, vaccine storage and handling,
delivery, and waste management for adult immunization do not exist in much of the world, and they will
have to be developed to support the pandemic response. WHO is currently planning for an initial tranche
of vaccines to cover 3% of country populations [25]. While this estimate will differ from country to
country based on advanced market purchase agreements, the anticipated low supply of SARS-CoV-2
vaccines early after they gain licensure will limit stress on global immunization systems deploying them.
Our study suggests that the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic response should address disparities in public
health resources now and strengthen immunization systems to maximize the impact and equity of future
pandemic vaccine deployment.

Position for Vaccine Use in Adults
The Position Paper states: “WHO recommends hepatitis B vaccination of persons
at high-risk of hepatitis B virus infection in [adults] and catch-up vaccination of
unvaccinated cohorts if the necessary resources are available.”
Countries that have an aging population and elevated disease burden may choose
to introduce HZV. Citing unknown burden of disease and insufficient data
supporting HZV in most countries, the WHO does not offer any recommendation
regarding the routine use of HZV.
The Position Paper states: “[I]ndividual national decisions on the use of influenza
vaccines will be determined by national capacity and resources… For countries
considering the initiation or expansion of programs for seasonal influenza
vaccination, WHO recommends that pregnant women should have the highest
priority. Additional risk groups to be considered for vaccination, in no particular
order of priority, are children aged 6–59 months, [older adults], individuals with
specific chronic medical conditions, and health-care workers.”
WHO does not currently have recommendations on the use of PCV in individuals
over 5 years of age, although addressing pneumococcal vaccination in adults is on
the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) agenda
for future deliberation.
The Position Paper states: “Many industrialized countries recommend PPSV
immunization of older adults and other high-risk groups. In resource-limited
settings where there are many competing health priorities, the evidence does not
support routine immunization of older adults and high-risk populations with PPSV.
Given the substantial effects of herd immunity in adult age groups following
routine infant immunization with PCV, a higher priority should be given to
introducing and maintaining high coverage of infants with PCV. Countries
considering introducing PPSV to [older adults] or other high-risk populations will
need to develop strategies for reaching these target populations…The optimal
timing, frequency and clinical effectiveness of additional doses of PPSV are poorly
defined, and national recommendations regarding revaccination vary. However, on
the basis of the data on the duration of vaccine-induced protection, WHO suggests
one single revaccination >5 years after a first vaccination.”
