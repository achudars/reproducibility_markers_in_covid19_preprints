ABSTRACT [Word count = 350]

Objectives

– Describe a new England-wide electronic health record (EHR) resource enabling whole

population research on Covid-19 and cardiovascular disease whilst ensuring data security and privacy and maintaining public trust.

Design

– Cohort comprising linked person-level records from national healthcare settings for the

English population accessible within NHS Digital’s new Trusted Research Environment.
Setting

– EHRs from primary care, hospital episodes, death registry, Covid-19 laboratory test results

and community dispensing data, with further enrichment planned from specialist intensive care,
cardiovascular and Covid-19 vaccination data.
Participants

- 54.4 million people alive on 1 January 2020 and registered with an NHS general pracst

titioner in England.
Main measures of interest –

Confirmed and suspected Covid-19 diagnoses, exemplar cardiovascular

conditions (incident stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and incident myocardial infarction
(MI)) and all-cause mortality between 1 January and 31 October 2020.
st

Results

st

– The linked cohort includes over 96% of the English population. By combining person-level

data across national healthcare settings, data on age, sex and ethnicity are complete for over 95% of
the population. Among 53.2M people with no prior diagnosis of stroke/TIA, 98,721 had an incident
stroke/TIA, of which 30% were recorded only in primary care and 4% only in death registry records.
Among 53.1M people with no prior history of MI, 62,966 had an incident MI, of which 8% were recorded only in primary care and 12% only in death records. A total of 959,067 people had a confirmed
or suspected Covid-19 diagnosis (714,162 in primary care data, 126,349 in hospital admission records, 776,503 in Covid-19 laboratory test data and 48,433 participants in death registry records).
While 58% of these were recorded in both primary care and Covid-19 laboratory test data, 15% and
18% respectively were recorded in only one.

Conclusions

– This population-wide resource demonstrates the importance of linking person-level

data across health settings to maximize completeness of key characteristics and to ascertain cardio-

INTRODUCTION

The Covid-19 pandemic has increased awareness of the importance of population-wide person-level
electronic health record (EHR) data from a range of sources for examining, modelling and reporting
disease trends to inform healthcare and public health policy . Key benefits of research using such
1

data on nationwide cohorts include: (i) generalisability of findings across all age groups, ethnicities,
geographical locations and socioeconomic, health and personal characteristics and (ii) inclusion of
very large numbers of people and events, enhancing the precision of findings and enabling a wide
spectrum of novel research studies (e.g., characterising shapes of relationships between risk factors
and disease or studying minority sub-populations and rare disease sub-types) . Whilst EHRs for
whole country cohorts for Wales, Scotland, Denmark and Sweden (populations approximately 3 to
10 million) have been used for research for several years,

2,3,4,5,6

at the start of the COVID-19 pan-

demic, there was no access for bona fide researchers to national linked healthcare data across the
population of England to enable critical research to support healthcare decisions and public health
policy. There were two main reasons for this: there was no national collection of comprehensive,
linkable primary care data; and there was no secure, privacy-protecting mechanism for researchers
to access and conduct population-wide research using national datasets linked across different parts
of the health data system (from primary care, hospitals, death registries, laboratories etc). EHR research in England to date has, therefore, not been able to take advantage of the statistical power of
studying a population of almost 60 million people, while clinical, public health and policy insights
have directly represented only a subset of the population. Hence, there remains a need for accessible, nationwide health data in England for research, whilst ensuring participant safety and maintaining public trust.
Motivated by the public health importance of fully understanding the relationship between Covid-19
and cardiovascular disease (CVD), the British Heart Foundation (BHF) Data Science Centre estab7

lished the CVD-COVID-UK initiative to partner with NHS Digital in the development and secure pro8

9

vision for approved research of linked, nationally collated EHRs for the whole population of the UK.
Here we describe key features of the new English component of this effort: a nationwide linked
health data resource, provided within a new Trusted Research Environment (TRE) for England. We
use descriptive analyses of the currently available data to illustrate the importance for whole population research studies of linking EHRs from across different health settings.

METHODS

Data resources
The newly established NHS Digital TRE for England provides secure, remote access for researchers to
linked, person-level EHR data from national health settings. The data sources currently available include primary care data, hospital episodes (covering inpatient, outpatient, emergency department
and critical care episodes), registered deaths (including cause of death), Covid-19 laboratory tests
and community dispensed medicines (Table 1; CVD-COVID-UK Dataset dashboard; CVD-COVID-UK
10

Dataset TRE asset in Health Data Research Innovation Gateway) . Further incorporation of specialist
11

intensive care, cardiovascular audit and Covid-19 vaccination data is planned in the near future. Datasets from each source include the same set of unique person-level master keys (or pseudoidentifiers) to enable linkage of peoples’ records between datasets.

Data linkage
Linkage between datasets is enabled by NHS Digital’s

Master Person Service,

12

which uses a four-

stage algorithm to match multiple records for each person from different clinical computer systems
(e.g., hospitals and general practices) to a single unique identifier, the National Health Service (NHS)
number representing a single person. The algorithm verifies and cross-checks the NHS numbers with
associated demographic details including age, gender and postcode.

13

Data resource access – NHS Digital TRE for England
On behalf of the CVD-COVID-UK consortium, the BHF Data Science Centre requested access to the
data sources via the NHS Digital online Data Access Request Service and received approval for the
14

CVD-COVID-UK research programme (Ref no: DARS-NIC-381078-Y9C5K) following discussion with
NHS Digital’s Independent Group Advising on the Release of Data (IGARD). A data sharing agree15

ment with NHS Digital allows approved researchers based in UK research organisations (universities
and NHS bodies) that jointly sign this agreement to access the data held within the NHS Digital TRE
service for England. The BHF Data Science Centre coordinates an Approvals and Oversight Board
16

(including representation from NHS Digital, participating research organisations and lay members)
that ensures research projects undertaken fall within scope of the ethical and regulatory approvals
for the CVD-COVID-UK consortium programme. The TRE provides secure storage and remote data
access, avoiding the need for any person-level data to leave NHS Digital (Figure 1). An expanding
suite of tools (currently including SQL, Python and R Studio) supports data management, visualization and analysis.

CVD-COVID-UK Consortium: Aims, Membership and Principles
The CVD-COVID-UK consortium aims to use analyses of UK population-wide linked EHR data to investigate: the effects of cardiovascular diseases, their risk factors and medications on susceptibility to
and poor outcomes from Covid-19; the direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on acute cardiovascular complications and longer-term cardiovascular risk; and the indirect impact of the pandemic on
the presentation, diagnosis, management and outcomes of cardiovascular diseases. Lay summaries
8

of approved projects are published on the consortium’s web page . All consortium members (cur8

rently over 130 people from around 40 research or NHS organisations, including NHS data custodians) commit to: conducting research according to the ‘Five Safes’; an inclusive approach that en17

ables additional researchers to join the consortium as the work evolves; and the open sharing of research protocols and analysis code (via the BHF Data Science Centre Github repository)
phenotype code lists and algorithms (via the HDR UK Phenotype Library).

Data updates
The datasets within the TRE are updated regularly from NHS Digital’s internal systems (between daily and fortnightly depending on the dataset) and have a variable lag behind real time at the point of
update (Table 2). The datasets are currently refreshed on a synchronized monthly schedule, but
more frequent updates (e.g. daily or weekly) can be requested according to clinical, public health
and health policy research needs.

Data security, privacy and confidentiality
The data within the TRE are de-identified (i.e., directly identifying data items, such as each person’s
name, address, NHS number and exact date of birth, are removed) and pseudonymised (i.e., each
unique person-specific NHS number is replaced with a non-identifying unique master key). Postcodes are replaced with lower layer super output areas which can be converted to indices of multiple deprivation. Further, NHS Digital operates a ‘safe outputs’ service: only summary, aggregate
20

results can be extracted from the TRE by approved researchers, subject to approval through disclosure control processes and rules, following similar principles to those used by other established
TREs, such as the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank for Wales

21,22

and the

Scottish National Data Safe Haven. This ensures that no output that might be placed in the public

domain contains information that could be used either on its own or in conjunction with other data
to identify a person.

Ethical approval
The North East - Newcastle & North Tyneside 2 Research Ethics Committee provided ethical approval for the CVD-COVID-UK research programme (REC number: 20/NE/0161).

Patient and Public Involvement
The lay panel of the UK National Institutes for Health Research-BHF Cardiovascular Partnership reviews the CVD-COVID-UK programme every few months and provides feedback that informs ongoing
and future research. In addition, lay people directly affected by cardiovascular disease are members
of the consortium and its Approvals and Oversight Board, enabling co-generations of research ideas
and providing valuable perspective and input on research proposals, lay summaries and research
outputs.

Derivation of participant characteristics and disease diagnoses
For descriptive analyses, we defined a linked cohort including all people in the primary care data
known to be alive on 1 January 2020, excluding those who had either died before or were born on
st

or after that date (as recorded in the death registry and in the primary care records, respectively).
We censored follow-up on 31 October 2020, the latest record date common across the datasets.
st

We defined eligible records within the hospital episodes, death registry and Covid-19 laboratory test
results as those which could be linked by their unique master key to a person included in the primary
care data.

We combined primary care and hospital episodes records (covering inpatient, outpatient, emergency department and critical care episodes) from before the index date of 1 January 2020 to dest

fine key characteristics, including sex, age and ethnicity (categorised into White; Mixed; Asian and
Asian British, Black and Black British and other ethnic groups). For each characteristic, we extracted
the most recent record from the primary care data if available, otherwise we used the most recent
record from the hospital episodes records. Characteristics were classified as “unknown” for people
with no records. Using previously validated phenotypes from the CALIBER resource, we defined

RESULTS

Overview of data resources
Table 2

provides an overview of the currently available primary care, hospital episodes, death regis-

trations, Covid-19 test data and community dispensing data sources.
The primary care dataset includes healthcare information coded with SNOMED-CT concepts for all
people registered with an English NHS general practice (excluding around 1.3 million people with a
registered objection to their general practice records being provided to NHS Digital). It includes
25

data from 98% of all English general practices across all relevant general practice computer system
suppliers (TPP, EMIS, InPracticeSystems and Microtest) and holds approximately 4.9 billion records
on 54.4 million people alive on 1 January 2020 (over 96% of the total population of England based
st

on the UK Office for National Statistics mid-2019 population estimate for England of 56,286,961).

27

Around 34,000 SNOMED codes are included (over 90% of all those currently extracted for a wide
range of purposes by NHS Digital’s GP Extraction Service), covering a broad range of diagnoses and
procedures (from as far back in time as records exist) along with laboratory results, physical measurements, clinical referrals and prescriptions. Of note, while over 900,000 SNOMED codes are listed
in UK and international releases, large numbers of these are either inactive or hardly used.
Administrative and clinical hospital episode data are available from both the Secondary Uses Service
(SUS+) and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) resources. These data include information on length of
27

stay, diagnoses and procedures during hospital admissions as well as on outpatient, emergency department and critical care episodes. Diagnoses are coded with ICD-10 codes and procedures with
Operating Procedure Codes (OPCS-4). The SUS+ resource contains raw data collected from NHS
28

healthcare providers, representing the most up-to-date hospital episodes within NHS Digital
(amongst hospitals making prompt and complete returns). These data are consolidated, validated
and cleaned on a monthly basis to form the HES database. As a result, each month’s HES data be29

come available about two months behind real time. Thereafter, a fixed update is produced for each
full year of HES data. Amongst the 54.4 million people included in our linked cohort, the SUS+ dataset holds 2.5 billion records for 6.3 million people (from November 2019 onwards) and the HES dataset holds 0.2 billion records on 42.3 million people (from 1997 onwards).
Death registration data flow daily to NHS Digital from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Civil
11

Registration dataset, including date, cause (coded with ICD-10) and place of death, and are available
historically from April 1997. Deaths in England should be registered within five days of the date of

st

The Second Generation Surveillance System (SGSS)

11

is the national laboratory reporting system

used in England to capture routine laboratory data on mainly infectious diseases and antimicrobial
resistance, including the SARS-CoV-2 virus. SGSS provides reports daily to NHS Digital on positive
Covid-19 results (including the test date) fed directly from Pillar 1 pathology labs (i.e., established
labs in hospitals for patients as well as NHS key workers), and indirectly from Pillar 2 labs (i.e., new,
centralised, mostly privately-run labs, created specifically for Covid-19 testing for the wider population). In total 884,341 participants have at least one positive Covid-19 test recorded in the SGSS
Covid-19 laboratory test dataset, of which 776,503 participants (88%) are linkable to the 54.4 million
person cohort.
The community dispensing dataset, provided to NHS Digital monthly by the NHS Business Services
Authority, contains person-level information on NHS primary care prescriptions dispensed by community pharmacists, appliance contractors and dispensing doctors in England, including the name
and strength of medication coded from the British National Formulary (BNF) Dictionary of Medicines
and Devices (DM+D). Amongst the 54.4 million person cohort, there are over 40.6 million with dis32

pensed medications and approximately 2.3 billion records (from April 2018).

Demographic characteristics and cardiovascular disease incidence
Characteristics of the linked cohort of 54.4 million people alive on 1 January 2020 are shown in Tast

ble 3;

on 1 January 2020, 51% were female and 14% aged 70 years or older, with a mean age of
st

40.0 years for males and 41.6 years for females. By linking and combining person-level records from
primary care and hospital episodes, ethnicity information is available for over 95% of people, among
whom 63% have their ethnic group recorded in primary care and 92% in hospital episodes data (Figure 2a).

A previous diagnosis of stroke/TIA or MI is recorded for 2.2% and 2.1% of people, respec-

tively, while 7% and 8% people have a record indicating a previous diagnosis of diabetes and obesity,
respectively. Among 53.2 million people with no prior diagnosis of stroke/TIA, 98,721 had a first-ever
incident stroke/TIA between 1 January and 31 October 2020, of which 30% were recorded only in
st

primary care (i.e. not in hospital episodes or death registry data) and 4% only in death registry records (Figure 2b). Among 53.1M people with no prior MI, 62,966 had an incident MI during follow up,
of which 8% were recorded only in primary care and 12% only in death registry records (Figure 2c).

Covid-19 diagnoses
Among people in the linked cohort, a total of 959,067 people had a confirmed or suspected Covid-19
diagnosis between 1 January and 31 October 2020 (714,162 in primary care data, 126,349 in hosst

st

pital admission records, 776,503 in Covid-19 laboratory test data and 48,433 in death registry records). While 58% of these were recorded in both primary care and Covid-19 laboratory test data,
15% and 18% respectively were recorded in only one of these (Figure 3).
Whereas females are more likely to have a confirmed or suspected Covid-19 diagnosis in their primary care records (1.4% females versus 1.2% males) and in Covid-19 laboratory test data (1.5% females versus 1.3% males), they are less likely to have a Covid-19 diagnosis recorded in hospital episodes (0.21% females versus 0.26% males) or on death certificates (0.08% females versus 0.10%
males). Older people are more likely to have a Covid-19 diagnosis from hospital episodes and death
registrations, although young adults are more likely to have Covid-19 diagnoses recorded in Covid-19
laboratory test data and primary care. People with unknown age or sex are over 10 times more likely
to have a Covid-19 diagnosis recorded in hospital episodes or on death certificates. A higher proportion of Asian and Asian British people have a Covid-19 diagnosis in primary care and in the Covid-19
laboratory tests in comparison with other ethnicities. However, such differences are not observed in
information from hospital episodes or death certificates. People with a previous history of
stroke/TIA, MI, obesity or diabetes are more likely to have a Covid-19 diagnosis recorded in all
healthcare settings (Table 3).
When compared with the latest Public Health England reports of Covid-19 laboratory tests, Covid33

19-related hospital admissions and deaths with Covid-19 on the death certificate, our linked co34

35

hort produces statistics which concord with relevant cumulative counts of Covid-19 cases (Supplementary Table 6).

DISCUSSION

Summary
We have described the development and key features of a novel linked EHR resource comprising a
range of current and future planned linked datasets covering the entire population of England and
forming part of wider UK-wide initiative to accelerate UK-wide research on Covid-19 and cardiovascular disease and beyond. We include descriptive analyses of a cohort of 54.4 million people alive at
the start of 2020, including over 96% of the English population. The datasets described are already
being accessed through the new NHS Digital TRE service for England to enable an expanding range of
research projects via the BHF Data Science Centre’s CVD-COVID-UK consortium. Notably, combining
person-level information across data sources delivers approximately 95% complete data on key
characteristics including age, sex and ethnicity and is essential for identifying cardiovascular diseases
of interest, such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Approximately 90% of people with a positive
Covid-19 laboratory test have linkable primary care records, and enriching the Covid-19 laboratory
test data with primary care, hospital episodes and death registry data enables ascertainment of approximately 20% additional confirmed or suspected Covid-19 cases.

Previously, research use of linked EHRs in England has been restricted to subsets of the population,
according to the coverage of various data providers, including the individual primary care computer
system suppliers (e.g., the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, The Health Improvement Network,
36

37

QResearch and, more recently, OpenSafely ). As the national provider of information, data and IT
38

39

systems for commissioners, analysts and clinicians in health and social care in England, NHS Digital
handles larger volumes of health data than any other organisation globally and has extremely well
developed and robust processes for maintaining data security and privacy. Alignment of the new
Trusted Research Environment for England with NHS Digital’s systems therefore maximises security
while minimising the need for transmission of large volumes of linked data to support populationscale research.

Strengths and limitations
The currently available linked data assets comprise the world’s largest single population-based cohort available for research, which will be further enhanced as further datasets are added. The availability of primary care data linked to such a wide range of other data is unparalleled at this scale,
while the resource is also making linked nationwide Covid-19 laboratory testing and community dispensing data available for research for the first time. Unsurprisingly, given the >96% coverage of the

and includes large

enough numbers of people with different characteristics to support a diverse range of statistically
well-powered research studies. For example, the cohort includes large numbers of: people in subgroups typically under-represented in research (e.g., several tens of thousands in each of the ethnic
minority subgroups); younger people for whom poor outcomes of Covid-19 are uncommon but
nonetheless devastating (e.g., over 20 million under 30 years of age, among whom 75 deaths were
recorded by 31 October 2020); people experiencing the common exemplar cardiovascular outst

comes of stroke/TIA and MI (many tens of thousands), suggesting substantial potential to support
studies of the impact of Covid-19 on subtypes of stroke and MI as well as on a wide range of rare
conditions.
The NHS Digital TRE for England ensures secure, privacy-protecting storage of and access to large
volumes of data, while minimizing the expense and security risks of data travel. Provision of data in
this way is enabling a broad programme of collaborative research, encompassing several projects,
which would be challenging to justify under the data dissemination model but which meet the relevant ethics and data access requirements under the TRE model. Researchers from many different
organisations have been able to gain rapid access to the linked datasets via the CVD-COVID-UK consortium and its data sharing agreement with NHS Digital, avoiding lengthy and costly processes for
multiple separate organisational data-access approvals and agreements. The consortium is enabling
collaboration amongst researchers from across the UK, with a wide range of expertise (including clinicians from many different specialist backgrounds, data managers, computer scientists, data wranglers, epidemiologists and biostatisticians). Further, it has encouraged productive interactions between researchers and NHS Digital staff (including project management, data management, data
science and technical development teams), enabling joint approaches to developing the TRE service
and to identifying and solving data provision and linkage challenges. The rich and diverse nature of
this interdisciplinary collaboration supports clinically and methodologically informed data curation
and analysis pipelines and will enhance the interpretation and clinical application of research outputs. Regular dataset updates ensure the contemporary relevance and dynamic nature of the data
resource and will enable ongoing long-term follow-up of the whole population. The development of
publicly shareable, validated phenotyping algorithms and analytic code will avoid duplication of
19

effort by additional groups of researchers working with the same or similar datasets. Although developed with the initial intent of supporting the CVD-COVID-UK consortium research programme,

establishing the NHS Digital TRE Service for England has wider benefits, given its clear potential to
expand to support research more broadly beyond Covid-19 and beyond the cardiovascular domain.
In addition, the work to establish the TRE has generated knowledge about linked EHR data and
routes to their access across the UK health data science research community, benefiting other UKwide initiatives, including: the UK-wide ISARIC study of the clinical characteristics of people hospitalized with Covid-19,

programme, established to coordinate the UK’s Covid-19 research response (in particular its underpinning Data and Connectivity theme led by Health Data Research UK).

Nevertheless, there are some limitations: (i) it is not yet possible to bring external cohort studies or
trials into the environment for linkage (although data can be linked to these through NHS Digital’s
standard data dissemination route); (ii) the primary care data are currently restricted to a large subset of SNOMED codes and limited to people known to be alive from November 2019 onwards, although NHS Digital is currently enacting its plans to obtain a fully comprehensive primary care dataset, to be updated daily, which will become available during 2021 and will eventually replace the
current primary care dataset; (iii) the TRE currently has a relatively limited range of services and analytical tools, although NHS Digital are committed to expanding these; (iv) the descriptive results presented here provide an overview of the available resources with illustrative examples but are not
designed to inform reliable conclusions about the associations between patient characteristics and
COVID-19 outcomes, as the analyses are unadjusted and so prone to confounding; (v) whilst some
data quality checks have been performed before creating the linked cohort, future analyses may require additional checks to minimize influential errors, outliers and inconsistent records.

Combining resources across the four nations of the UK
Similar, albeit not identical, EHR data resources are available in separate TREs provided by SAIL
Databank for Wales, the National Data Safe Haven in Scotland and the Honest Broker Service in
Northern Ireland. Due to differences in data structure and coding procedures between nations, we
advocate the development of analysis plans which aim for maximum consistency but allow for nation-specific differences. Where appropriate, results of nation-specific analyses can be combined to
produce results with UK-wide coverage. Such combined analyses will, increasingly, be able to take

advantage of Health Data Research UK’s plans to provide the infrastructure, methods and tools to

Conclusion
We describe the first-ever provision for research of linked nationwide EHR data for England and
demonstrate the importance of linking person-level data from different health settings for defining
exemplar cardiovascular disease outcomes, Covid-19 diagnoses and key characteristics. By covering
almost the entire English population, the resource includes all age groups, ethnic geographic, and
socioeconomic, health and personal characteristics and can enable statistically powerful populationscale research with very large numbers of outcomes. It is accessible by approved researchers
through a secure TRE hosted by NHS Digital to support research on Covid-19 and cardiovascular disease and can expand to benefit other future research initiatives beyond Covid-19 and cardiovascular
disease.
