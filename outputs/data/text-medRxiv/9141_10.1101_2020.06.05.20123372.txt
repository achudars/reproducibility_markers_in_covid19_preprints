Abstract

23

We used multi-agent simulations to estimate the testing capacity required to find and isolate a

24

number of infections sufficient to break the chain of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Depending on

25

the mitigation policies in place, a daily capacity between 0.7 to 3.6 tests per thousand was required

26

to contain the disease. However, if contact tracing and testing efficacy dropped below 60% (e.g. due

27

to false negatives or reduced tracing capability), the number of infections kept growing

28

exponentially, irrespective of any testing capacity. Under these conditions, the population’s

29

geographical distribution and travel behaviour could inform sampling policies to aid a successful

30

containment.

1. Introduction

36

In December of 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia was recorded among people associated with

37

the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China1. They were infected

38

with a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In a few

39

months, the virus spread rapidly around the world and with no vaccine or identified treatment it has

40

forced a growing number of countries to implement robust non-pharmacological policies of social

41

distancing, such as stay-at-home orders. As of early June 2020, the world health organization

42

(WHO) has reported that these mitigation strategies have been successful in containing new daily

43

infections, where applied 1. However, these measures have determined a high social and economic

44

cost, leading policy makers to consider different follow-up strategies for mitigation and

45

containment. The objective for the months to come has now shifted towards the need to allow as

46

many people as possible to go back to work safely, in order to reduce the economic impact of the

47

pandemic, while avoiding or at least mitigating a second wave of infections that could overwhelm

48

the healthcare system 2.

49

To this end, the WHO has suggested that enhanced capacity for contact tracing and testing is

50

necessary to continuously monitor the intensity and geographical spread of the virus, detect new

51

outbreaks at their onset, isolate (i.e. quarantine) new infections and prevent subclinical

52

transmission. Contact tracing, testing and isolating potential vectors of the disease is the key public

53

health process that has been used for decades to break the chain of transmission of a disease 3-5.

54

This strategy aims at identifying those individuals who have come into contact with an infected

55

person in order to prevent new pre-symptomatic viral shedding 6, promoting targeted isolation

56

whenever necessary. The high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 7 and the understanding that the

57

onset of viral shedding precedes the manifestation of symptoms 8,9 have already led policy makers

58

to vastly increase testing and contact tracing capacity. At the same time, they are also tasked with

59

striking a balance between the need to trace back the movements of anyone who tested positive for

60

the virus (and those of her contacts) and the concern that legitimate health-related tracking policies

61

may deteriorate into a form of mass surveillance. This trade-off comes in a time of crisis for

62

democracies across the world with the associated disenfranchisement of many citizens and mistrust

63

of government communication, a phenomenon that reduces voluntary compliance to tracking

64

methods. Furthermore, despite the general consensus that “more is better”, it remains to be

65

determined the order of magnitude of the resources required to appropriately identify, test and

66

isolate a number of pre-symptomatic infections sufficient to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 transmission

67

to a tolerable societal risk 10. It is also unclear how these estimates may dynamically change as a

68

function of efficacy and reliability of testing and tracing 11,12, or depending on which non3

69

pharmacological policies are implemented, leaving policy-makers to rely on heuristic approaches

70

which may lead to severe and systematic errors.

71

Here we used a series of multi-agent simulations 13,14 to highlight emergent dynamics in the

72

interaction between agents, environment, viral transmission and testing policies. The simulations

73

were aimed at estimating ecologically plausible capacities for contact tracing and testing that would

74

allow to identify and isolate a number of infections sufficient to break the chain of transmission of

75

the virus. In the first set of simulations, we used fifteen conditions in a 3 (disease incidence) x 5

76

(contact tracing and testing efficacy) design. Three different levels of incidence values of the

77

disease, e.g. due to different non-pharmacological mitigation policies in place, determined three

78

growth rates in the number of daily infections. Five different rates of contact tracing and testing

79

efficacy determined the number of infected subjects that were found or missed by the testing

80

process, e.g. due false negatives or untraced contacts. These simulations highlighted a systemic

81

failure with the process of contact tracing and testing, which arises when its efficacy drops below a

82

threshold that varies as a function of the disease incidence.

83

In the second set of simulations, we investigated whether different sampling strategies for testing

84

could be used to aid of the contact tracing process, to find infected agents missed by this process

85

and signal the presence of new outbreaks. For these simulations, we used the lowest value for

86

contact tracing and testing efficacy (20%), jointly with the medium incidence setting (25% increase

87

in daily infections), across three different conditions of population density, geographical

88

distribution and simplified travel habits for the population. These simulations showed a possible

89

solution to overcome the systemic failure reported for low efficacy contact tracing and testing that

90

relies on population-level analysis of geographical distribution and travel behaviour, thus mitigating

91

mass surveillance concerns.

2.1 Estimating the optimal contact tracing capacity.

95

Our first set of simulations covered 60 days across 50 scenarios (i.e. 50 random seeds) and 15

96

environmental conditions, in a 3 (disease incidence) x 5 (contact tracing and testing efficacy)

97

design. Each scenario assumed an initial number of ~50 infected agents15, uniformly distributed in a

98

population of 100,000 simulated agents. Three tested levels of incidence determined a number of

99

new infections equivalent to a daily incidence growth of 35%, 25% or 15% of the number all non-

100

isolated infected agents: i.e. in the absence of any containment strategy the number of infections

101

doubled approximately every 2.5, 3 or 6 days, mimicking different rates of exponential growth of

102

infections reported across countries in early 2020 for COVID-19 1. To simulate the impact of

103

missed contacts or false negative tests, five rates of contact tracing and testing efficacy were

104

examined, controlling the percentage (100%, 80%, 60%, 40% or 20%) of infected agents that would

105

be found positive, among those who had been in contact with and infected by any agent who tested

106

positive. Finally, we assumed virus shedding started three days prior to showing symptoms 9. All

107

symptomatic infected agents were assumed to be isolated (i.e. quarantined at home or in a hospital)

108

and therefore could not further contribute to virus transmission after symptom onset. Based on

109

preliminary reports, we estimated that 20% of infected agents would not show symptoms severe

110

enough to induce self-isolation or hospitalization16,17. Therefore, in our simulations, these

111

asymptomatic agents kept propagating the disease until fully recovered 9 or found positive in a

112

targeted test (e.g. they were found with contact tracing), in which case they would then be

113

considered isolated at home.

114

For eight of the fifteen simulated conditions we found a parameterisation that resulted in the

115

suppression of the virus transmission (effective reproduction < 1; Table 1, Figure 1). These

116

conditions were characterised by high (≥60%) contact tracing and testing efficacy, and a testing

117

capacity between 0.7 (low incidence) and 3.6 (high incidence) per thousand agents. Under four of

118

the remaining conditions (Table 1), the simulations indicated a testing capacity varying between 0.7

119

(low incidence) and 4.5 (high incidence) could contain the virus transmission, but the number of

120

agents tested and isolated was not sufficient to reduce the daily number of new infections to zero.

121

Instead, the daily number of infected agents remained stable or slightly decreased on average across

122

the simulated scenarios (effective reproduction ≈ 1; Figure 1a,e). Similarly, for the remaining three

123

conditions characterised by low contact tracing and testing efficacy (20% and 40%) and medium or

124

high incidence (number of infection growth rate: 35% and 25%), the exponential growth of

125

infections could not be contained, independent of the capacity available (effective reproduction > 1;

126

Table 1, Figure 1c,e).

127

These capacity values were found in a heuristic research (see methods) and they were set as the

128

lowest sufficient to either stabilising or reducing the number of infected agents per day (Table 1).

129

Importantly, for those conditions showing that the process of contact tracing, testing and isolation

130

was insufficient to suppress or halt the virus transmission, the testing capacity was set above the

131

daily number of tests actually performed. Thus, the failure in containing the spread of the disease in

132

presence of low efficacy is systemic: it is not necessarily due to the availability of tests per se, as a

133

further increase in daily capacity did not affect this result (Figure 1d,f). Instead, the high percentage

134

of missed contacts enhanced a predator-prey dynamic (i.e. Lotka-Volterra non-linearity 18; Figure

135

2), where the predators (the tests) lost track of too many preys (the infections), and remained idle

136

(part of the daily test capacity remained unused). As a consequence, the disease spread undetected,

137

thus leading to a minimally mitigated “wave” of infections.

138

2.2 Solutions for the low efficacy contact tracing and testing systemic failure.

139

The straightforward solution to this failure is to increase the efficacy of contact tracing, for instance

140

by enhancing various forms of movement surveillance. Our findings indicated that 60% of contact

141

tracing and testing efficacy allowed for tracing, testing and isolating a sufficient number of

142

infections to contain or suppress the virus transmission, irrespective of the simulated incidence.

143

However, we decided to assess also alternative routes for mitigating the virus transmission,

144

considering that the idle daily testing capacity could be used to find “preys” missed by the contact

145

tracing “predators”, thus providing new traces to follow. To this end, we simulated and compared

146

the effects of multiple testing policies in support of contact tracing (see Methods for details), in a 3

147

(geographical distribution) x 2 (distributions of travel behaviours) design. We simulated the effects

148

of using these mixed policies in three geographical maps of population density (New York

149

metropolitan area, Southeast Italy, and the Midlands in UK, Figure 2), combined with different

150

distributions of travelling behaviours for the agents. We devised three cohorts of travel behaviour

151

(Figure 2a): one marked agents moving in a small size sector (e.g. within one city or one borough),

152

a second for a medium size sector (e.g. comprising two boroughs or two separate towns, depending

153

on the map) and a third of agents freely moving in the entire map. We tested two distributions of

154

agents among the three cohorts: a “quasi uniform” distribution where the three cohorts consisted of

155

40%, 30% and 30% of the simulated agents; a “skewed” distribution, where the small size sector

156

cohort comprised 80% of the population, while 10% of the agents were included in the remaining

157

two. Each member of any of the three cohorts had the potential to shed the virus anywhere in the

158

simulated environment within the limits of their travel range. For these simulations, we kept

159

constant both the incidence (25% daily growth in the number of non-isolated infections) and the

160

contact tracing efficacy (20%), as a proof of concept. This second simulation set covered 60 days,

161

across the same 50 scenarios controlled by random seeds used for the first set.

162

First, the simulations showed the policy of contact tracing, testing and isolation mitigated virus

163

transmission in similar ways across geographical and travel behaviour distribution (Figure 3). The

164

mean number of infected agents recorded at day 60 across the 50 simulated scenarios was

165

104.74±32.04 and 104.94±31.97, respectively, for the New York metropolitan area, with the quasi

166

uniform (NY1) and skewed travel distribution (NY2). Similarly, for southeast Italy, we found

167

100.18±31.76 and 101.46±34.81 infected agents in association with the same two distributions of

168

travel behaviours (seIT1 and seIT2, respectively). Finally, for the map of Midlands, UK, we found

169

109.32±30.36 and 101.4±34.44 infected agents (Mid1 and Mid2, respectively). A 3x2 within

170

scenario repeated measures ANOVA revealed no significant effect for the geographical distribution

171

(Sphericity assumed, F(2,98)=.87, p=.42), distribution of travel behaviours (F(1,49)=.62, p=.43) or

172

interaction effect (F(2,98)=.86, p=.42).

173

Second, we found that the unused capacity available for contact tracing and testing could be

174

employed in further testing policies, marking an improvement in terms of the isolation of infections

175

and thus reducing virus transmission. For instance, contact tracing coupled with random sampling

176

from the entire map significantly reduced the number of infections recorded by the last day of

177

simulation across all scenarios (NY1: 86.62±32.04, NY2: 79.08±31.97, seIT1: 80.6±31.76, seIT2:

178

88±34.81, Mid1: 86.36±28.83, Mid2: 79.74±28.33 for the 3x2 conditions), when compared with the

179

same scenarios under the use of contact tracing, testing and isolation, alone. A 2x3x2 within

180

scenarios repeated measures ANOVA reported a significant effect for the testing policy (Sphericity

181

assumed, F(1,49)=115.59, p<.0001) and no significant effect for any other factor (geography:

182

F(2,98)=.19, p=.83, travel behaviour: F(1,49)=1.65, p=.2) or interaction of factors

183

(policy*geography: F(2,98)=1.04, p=.36, policy*travel behaviour: F(1,49)=.0, p=.97,

184

geography*travel behaviour: F(2,98)=2.58, p=.08, policy*geography*travel behaviour:

185

F(2,98)=1.03, p=.36; Figure 3).

186

Finally, we found geography- and behaviour-specific policies that further improved the containment

187

of the disease beyond the added benefit of random sample testing. In particular, we tested different

188

sampling methods where we limited the targeted area for the sampling to either a small or a medium

189

size cell (equivalent to the small and medium size travel range sectors, Figure 2a) and we sampled

190

the population giving different probability weights to different travel cohorts. We found that travel-

191

weighted sampling of the population localised in a small cell around the most recent outbreaks,

192

determined on a day-by-day basis, would successfully aid contact tracing and testing (Figure 3). We

193

found that the optimal weights of these outbreak-centred sampling policies varied as a function of

194

the population distribution on the maps and the distribution of travel behaviours. In t-test

195

comparisons between these mixed policies and the joint use of contact tracing and random sampling

196

over the entire population, the mixed policies were found to significantly reduce the number of

197

infected agents by day 60 of the simulation, for NY1 (73.3±26.69: t(49)=3.29, p=.002; Figure 3a),

198

NY2 (60.34±29.29: t(49)=4.12, p=.0001; Figure 3b), seIT2 (69.78±30.51: t(49)=4.31, p<.0001;

199

Figure 3d), Mid1 (72.52±27.94: t(49)=2.86, p<.006; Figure 3e) and Mid2 (48.68±27.8: t(49)= 8.49,

200

p<.0001 Figure 3e). We did not find a geography- and behaviour-specific policy -among those

201

tested- that led to significant improvements in comparison with the combined contact tracing and

202

map-wide random sampling for seIT1 (the best option led to a mean of 76.62±31.48: t(49)= .7,

203

p=.48; Figure 3c). For the seIT1, we also did not find a mixed policy that would result in halting or

204

marking a decline in the number of infections by the end of the simulations. Intuitively, where

205

mixed testing policies are in place, an increase in testing capacity does result in an increase in the

206

number of infected agents found and isolated, due to the increased sampling. Our simulations

207

confirmed this expectation as we increased the testing capacity for the condition seIT1, from 3 to 4

208

per thousand agents, determining a successful containment of the disease (supplementary Figure 1).

209
210

3. Discussion

211

The sweeping stay-at-home orders that have been put in place across the world to contain the

212

transmission of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 were urgently needed to avoid overwhelming

213

the healthcare systems, but they have also had a high social and economic negative impact. As

214

multiple countries are planning to re-open or are in the process of re-opening industries and

215

services, policy-makers are developing strategies that are meant to prevent a second wave of

216

infections 2. Here, we estimated the testing capacity required to identify and isolate a sufficient

217

number of infected subjects to break the chains of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, therefore allowing

218

to contain the impact of the disease and avoid the most severe containment measures. For these

219

estimations, we used multi-agent simulations in a soft artificial life approach 13, in place of well-

220

known statistic and mechanistic models 2,10,19,20, so to highlight emergent properties and dynamics

221

resulting from the interaction between simulated agents, environment and containment policies.

222

We found that several variables affect the estimations of the testing capacity. Some of these

223

variables are related to the disease and are yet to be fully understood, e.g. the percentage of

224

asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic among the infected 16,17,21,22, or the timing for the viral shedding

225

8,9

226

policy development. To account for this uncertainty, we simulated different levels of disease

227

incidence, resulting in different rates of growth of the number of infections, putatively simulating

228

the effects of different mitigation policies in place (social-distancing, face masks, etc.). Second, we

229

simulated fifty different starting conditions in terms of the number of imported infections and

230

location of infected agents at day 1 (i.e. at the start of the new policy implementation). Finally, we

231

simulated the efficacy of contact tracing and testing to account for the reliability of the tests 11,12 and

232

the ability of a country or region to trace movements and contacts of new found infections. Despite

233

these substantial simplifications, our simulations indicated a few key insights that can guide policy

234

development.

. Other variables pertain to external factors and should be considered when planning for testing

235

First, we found that at low levels of efficacy (i.e. low reliability of tests and/or low ability to trace

236

contacts), a high capacity of testing dedicated only to contact tracing, testing and isolation remains

237

partially unused, despite a growing number of infections. This is a striking result considering that in

238

most countries indeed failed in uncovering the real dimension of the disease prevalence, as clearly

239

demonstrated by the wide differences among case fatality rates across countries (4.7% in Germany,

240

5.9% in USA, 14% in UK or 14.3% in Italy), including those that were successful in containing the

241

disease (e.g. 0.5% in Iceland, 1.9% in New Zealand, 2.3% South Korea) 1. This result may also

242

explain why several countries prepared for a significant amount of tests per day and a diffused

243

network for contact tracing could not use their available capacity and failed to contain COVID-19,

244

eventually reporting a first wave of infections (e.g. as indicated for Germany 23). The virus

245

transmission may be intrinsically associated with reduced contact tracing efficacy, for instance due

246

to the relevance of indirect forms of propagation (e.g. droplets left on a handle in public transport

247

caught by a passenger hours or even days later 24,25). In this case, our simulations suggest that

248

improvements in contact tracing and testing efficacy, e.g. due to increased reliability of tests or in

249

implementing tracking methods for the population, are required to exceed a threshold of 60%.

250

Beyond this value, jointly with the safe isolation of all symptomatic subjects and those who tested

251

positive, we found a steady decline in the number of infections across all simulated levels of

252

incidence. Importantly, this result is consistent with an estimation recently provided in a

253

mechanistic model 10, demonstrating robustness of the finding across theoretical constructs.

254

Second, our data suggest that improvements in the containment of the disease can be achieved with

255

mixed testing policies. These policies combined contact tracing with independent testing of selected

256

samples of people, so aiding the monitoring of new outbreaks and feeding missed contacts to the

257

main process of contact tracing. Importantly, these mixed policies were designed to use the entire

258

testing capacity that remained after exhausting the needs of the process of contact tracing and

259

testing. Therefore, an increase in capacity in presence of these mixed policies improved the

260

containment of the virus transmission, due to the increased ability to find and isolate new infected

261

agents independent of existing traces. Finally, while the process of contact tracing and testing is

262

agnostic to both the geographic distribution and the population-level behaviours, the simulations

263

showed that optimal aiding policies are shaped by the features of the environment and cohort-level

264

behaviour 26. Thus, the use of these mixed policy would reduce the necessity for mass surveillance,

265

relying instead on anonymized, population-level, information.

266

The current study has a few limitations due to the simplifications that have been incorporated in the

267

simulations. Some of these simplifications have been motivated by the fact that the virus itself is

268

still very well under investigation and is therefore associated with multiple open questions. Further

269

refining of our knowledge of the transmission mechanisms, the viral shedding or the

270

symptomatology can affect the estimations of the testing capacities. Conversely, the described

271

systemic failure under conditions of low contact tracing and testing efficacy is driven by the well-

272

established presence of asymptomatic carriers, jointly with pre-symptomatic viral shedding. Other

273

simplifications, concerning for instance the behaviour of the agents, are motivated by the need to

274

execute a broad investigation across multiple conditions in a reasonably short time. Policy makers

275

could use our findings as a proof of concept while focussing on a single map to include more

276

realistic population-level behaviour (e.g. commuters might move long distances on a map, but

277

follow predictable paths every day). This would allow to simulate context specific effects of

278

tailored policies to aid contact tracing and testing, increasing the predictive power of the findings.

4. Methods

281

4.1 Key parameters for the simulated scenarios

282

All simulations started with a healthy population of 100,000 agents, distributed on a map depending

283

on the population density of the area analysed (Figure 2). For day 1 only, each agent had a .05%

284

probability of becoming infected, resulting in a randomly generated number of infected agents

285

(49.3±7.3 across scenarios) and random geographical distributions of these agents at the beginning

286

of each simulation. These differences in the initial conditions led to diverging scenarios in terms of

287

the number of infected people, active outbreaks and the difficulty of containment, approximately

288

replicating the estimated numbers two weeks to ten days prior to establishing the lockdown

289

measures in France, in March 15. Before the start of the simulation, each agent was pre-assigned to

290

one of five symptomatology categories, used only if the agent became infected. The five categories

291

included: asymptomatic (20%), symptomatic but not requiring hospitalization (65%), symptomatic

292

and requiring hospitalization (10%), symptomatic and requiring intensive care (4%) and

293

symptomatic and requiring intensive care, but will not survive (1%; Figure 4a)16,17,27. Studies and

294

reports do not yet agree on the relative percentages of these categories, due to the differences

295

among regions and countries in the methods for testing and monitoring the infections in the

296

populations and requirements for hospitalization. Thus, to contain the effects that changes in the

297

distribution of symptomatic agents would have on the estimations concerning testing capacities and

298

aiding testing policies, we assumed that all agents were isolated as soon as they showed symptoms.

299

This simplification made the percentage of asymptomatic individuals in the simulation of particular

300

importance for the final estimations. The value of 20% was determined using a weighted mean

301

between two key studies reporting the percentage of asymptomatic infected subjects in the Town of

302

Vo’ 17 and in the cruise ship Diamond Princess 16. The number of days required to develop

303

symptoms, if any (Figure 4b), the number of days to reach full recovery, with a bimodal distribution

304

due to the shorter time of recovery for the asymptomatic 9 (Figure 4c), and the time spent in

305

intensive care units (Figure 4d) were also predetermined 28,29. Finally each agent was assigned to

306

one of three possible “travel cohorts”, defining the range of movement (and range of virus

307

transmission) of each agent: the entire map, a medium size sector or a small size sector (Figure 2a).

308

We simulated two conditions in terms of cohort distribution for the large, medium and small sector

309

travel behaviour, as follows: 5%-5%-90% (skewed distribution) or 30%-30%-40% (quasi uniform

310

distribution). These have been chosen to test the effects the different policies have under

311

significantly different population-wise behaviours. For all conditions, we simulated 50 different

312

scenarios. These were controlled using numbered random seeds, to allow for within-scenario

313

comparisons.

314

4.2 Simulation of disease transmission and contact tracing

315

To avoid overwhelmingly demanding computational resources, we did not simulate an ecological

316

behaviour for the artificial agents, as the artificial agents did not create contacts while navigating

317

the space or creating crowds (e.g. in the limited space of simulated mass transportation or building).

318

Instead, we developed a semi-static transmission mechanism that was aimed at prioritising the

319

simulation of growth in the number of infections. To this end, the transmission of the virus is

320

simulated by extracting a percentage of infected agents daily (15%, 25% or 35%, depending on the

321

simulated condition of incidence) who have not been isolated and starting from 3 days before

322

showing symptoms 9. Each of these agents could then propagate the infection to one contact per

323

day, randomly selected among those in the range of travel. If the randomly selected contact was

324

healthy, it was immediately infected, starting the countdown for symptom manifestation (if any).

325

Conversely, if the contacted agent had been already infected at any point in the past, the

326

propagation of the infection was null. Despite its simplicity, this mechanism replicates the dynamic

327

of growth of number of infections until reaching herd immunity, in keeping with current estimations

328

for the reproduction number R0 of COVID-19 7.

329

To simulate contact tracing, we established a day-to-day pool of all agents displaying symptoms or

330

found positive that had not been already used for contact tracing at an earlier point in time. These

331

were randomly selected, removing them from future pools and adding one positive test to the count

332

of the day. Then, the agent under examination was used to trace the agent (if any) that had been the

333

origin of its infection and the agents (if any) that it had infected at any time during the simulation.

334

Each of these contacts could be either “found” or “missed”, depending on the probability assigned
11

335

for contact tracing efficacy. This mechanism was meant to simulate the fact that a contact may be

336

missed because it is not tested at all (missed trace) or due to a false negative. For instance, a contact

337

tracing and testing efficacy of 20% may be due to a combined ability to trace 25% of contacts, with

338

80% test reliability.

339

The simulations allowed for perfect record keeping of the actual contacts of each infections, so we

340

implemented a system that could simulate the number of negative tests per each positive one. This

341

was performed dynamically to represent the different challenges in finding positive contacts,

342

depending on the percentage of infected in the entire population. For each positive contact, the

343

simulation automatically added a number of negative tests (that contributed to reach the daily

344

maximum capacity) equivalent to the ratio of untested infected over healthy agents for the entire

345

population, up to a maximum of 20 negative tests per each positive one.

346

Finally, to determine the optimal testing capacity for the process of contact tracing and testing, we

347

followed a simple heuristic. We initiated the simulations of the fifty scenarios with a value of 0.1

348

tests for thousand agents, across all conditions. If any of the fifty scenarios resulted in a number of

349

pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic infections above zero by day 60, the capacity was increased by

350

0.1 for that condition, restarting the process. For the conditions showing the number of pre-

351

symptomatic or asymptomatic infections could not converge to zero, irrespective of the testing

352

capacity, we increased this value so that the daily number of tests performed remained below

353

capacity for at least 50 days of simulated time, across all scenarios.

354

4.4 Simulation of testing policies

355

We tested several policies to aid contact tracing: two of these were used as controls and were

356

characterised by either contact tracing and testing, alone, or by the same process aided by random

357

sampling in the entire map. The remaining policies consisted in variations of weighted sampling

358

within a small or medium cell, replicating the dimension of the small and medium sector for the

359

travel behaviour. The cells were centred on the coordinates of highest concentration of new

360

infections, as recorded the day prior to the sampling. For instance, the optimal policy found for the

361

condition NY2 consisted in sampling, within a small sector centred on the latest outbreak, with

362

weights of 60%-20%-20% for the three cohorts of travel behaviour (short, medium, long travel

363

range), whereas the optimal weights found for seIT2 or Mid1 were 20%-40%-40% and 80%-10%-

364

10%, respectively (Figure 3). Agents were extracted one by one as long as the capacity left unused

365

by contact tracing and testing allowed it. The agents found positive would then be isolated (i.e. they

366

could not contribute to the future transmission of the virus) and would be included in the pool of

367

agents to be traced, starting from the subsequent simulated day.

4.5 Code specifics and availability

369

The code was optimised for MATLAB r2019b (MathWorks, Natick, MA) , and it allows loading

370

any black and white dot-map of population density to test the effects of the different policies under

371

realistic conditions of population density and geographic distribution. The maps used in the

372

described case studies have been acquired using screenshots from the dot-maps provided by the

373

Cooper Center of the University of Virginia

374

(https://demographics.virginia.edu/DotMap/index.html), for the metropolitan area of New York,

375

and by Urban Data Visualisation by Duncan Smith, CASA UCL

376

(https://luminocity3d.org/WorldPopDen) for the south-east of Italy and the Midlands in UK. These

377

regions have been chosen to illustrate differences in testing policies can emerge when comparing

378

significantly different population distributions and geographical features. The maps were manually

379

converted (with the free software Gimp, v2.8) into grey scale JPEG -1000x1000 pixel, 300dpi- so to

380

have brightest part of the picture representing the highest population density. The resulting images

381

were automatically converted in the script into a matrix of probabilities that matched the grey

382

scale/distribution in the source dot-map: at the beginning of the simulation agents were randomly

383

assigned a position in the map according to these probabilities. This system allows to freely change

384

the map or the number of agents in the simulation, as the script automatically adjusts the

385

distribution to the new parameters. The entire codebase for these simulations is freely available

386

here: [LINK to be provided upon acceptance]. Ideally, we hope it can be used as a starting point for

387

more realistic simulations that would increase the ecological validity of the described estimations.

Table 1. Simulated testing capacities expressing the availability of tests per thousand
agents. Background colour of an individual cell indicates reported conditions of disease
containment: a white background indicates suppression of the transmission (R effective
< 0), a light grey background indicates containment but not suppression (R effective ≈
1), and dark grey background indicates exponential growth (R effective > 1).

Figure 1. Disease prevalence, agents tested and capacity. Error bands (mean and standard

510

deviation) represent the prevalence of COVID-19 in the population over 60 days of simulated time

511

(a, c, e), and the associated number of daily tested agents in relation with the respective testing

512

capacities (solid and dotted lines respectively in b, d, f). The 3x5 design was used to simulate three

513

conditions of simulated disease incidence, e.g. due to different mitigation strategies in place, which

514

regulated the growth in the number of infections (a-b: 15%, c-d: 25% and e-f: 35%), and five

515

conditions of contact tracing and testing efficacy (100%, 80%, 60%, 40% and 20%).

518

different simulations for the scenario 1 (random seed 1) for the maps of New York metropolitan

519

area (a), southeast Italy (b) and the Midlands in UK (c). All simulations display the (failed)

520

containment of the disease transmission relying only on contact tracing, testing and isolation, under

521

the conditions of medium incidence (25% daily increase in the number of infections), 20% contact

522

tracing and testing efficacy and a distribution of travel cohorts of 40%, 30% and 30% for the short,

523

medium and long travel range (respectively illustrated as black, blue and yellow squares in panel a).

Figure 3. Effects of test and isolation policies on the virus effective reproduction. Mean number

526

of infections per day, associated with different conditions and testing policies. Legends and error

527

bars (standard errors) are depicted for the policies of contact tracing and testing (CT), alone (black

528

triangles), contact tracing and testing jointly with random sampling across the entire map (grey

529

circles) and the combination of contact tracing and testing jointly with the best performing sampling

530

policies. Note that these optimal policies change depending on the simulated conditions of

531

geographical distribution and travel behaviour of the population. Under all conditions, the optimal

532

sampling policy to aid contact tracing focuses on small cells (equivalent to a small sector for the

533

travel behaviour) centred on the coordinates of the most severe outbreak recorded in the previous

534

day of simulated time. For two conditions, the optimal sampling is random within this cell (a, f).

535

For the remaining conditions, the sampling is weighted: 60%-20%-20% (b), 10%-45%-45% (c),

536

20%-40%-40% (d), 80%-10%-10% (e), for short, medium and long distance travel cohort.

Figure 4. Simulation settings. The histograms represent the distribution of symptoms (a), days

539

required for the symptoms onset (b), days required for recovery after symptoms onset (c) and days

540

required in intensive care units (d). Note that the bimodal distribution of the days to recovery is due

541

to the presence of asymptomatic subjects who are characterised by a shorter recovery time (marking

542

the end of viral shedding). The days spent in the intensive care units are considered as part of the

543

time required to recovery, when recovery is possible.

Supplementary figure 1. Increased testing capacity and testing policies. These simulations

546

illustrate the effects of an increase of testing capacity from 3 to 4 tests per thousand agents, jointly

547

with 20% contact tracing and testing (CT) efficacy. The contact tracing and testing process, when

548

considered alone (filled triangles for high capacity and empty triangles for high capacity), does not

549

exhaust the initial testing capacity due to low efficacy, so that an increase in capacity is ineffective

550

as it simply increases the number of unused tests per day. Instead, improved containment of the

551

disease transmission is found both for contact tracing and testing jointly with random sampling over

552

the entire population (filled circles for high capacity and empty squares for low capacity), as well as

553

for contact tracing and testing jointly with random sampling over a small sector centred on the most

554

recent outbreak (filled squares for high capacity and empty squares for low capacity). The latter

555

mixed policy succeeds in keeping the number of daily infections constant (R effective ≈ 1), once the

556

capacity is increased.
