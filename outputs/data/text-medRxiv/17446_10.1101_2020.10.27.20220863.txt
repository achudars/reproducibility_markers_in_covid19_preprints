ABSTRACT

40

Background: The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) gene locus plays a fundamental

41

role in human immunity, and it is established that certain HLA alleles are disease

42

determinants.

43

Methods: By combining the predictive power of multiple in silico HLA predictors, we

44

have previously identified prevalent HLA class I and class II alleles, including

45

DPA1*02:02, in two small cohorts at the COVID-19 pandemic onset. Since then, newer

46

and larger patient cohorts with controls and associated demographic and clinical data

47

have been deposited in public repositories. Here, we report on HLA-I and HLA-II alleles,

48

along with their associated risk significance in one such cohort of 126 patients, including

49

COVID-19 positive (n=100) and negative patients (n=26).

50

Results: We recapitulate an enrichment of DPA1*02:02 in the COVID-19 positive

51

cohort (29%) when compared to the COVID-negative control group (Fisher’s exact test

52

[FET] p=0.0174). Having this allele, however, does not appear to put this cohort’s

53

patients at an increased risk of hospitalization. Inspection of COVID-19 disease severity

54

outcomes reveal nominally significant risk associations with A*11:01 (FET p=0.0078),

55

C*04:01 (FET p=0.0087) and DQA1*01:02 (FET p=0.0121).

56

Conclusions: While enrichment of these alleles falls below statistical significance after

57

Bonferroni correction, COVID-19 patients with the latter three alleles tend to fare worse

58

overall. This is especially evident for patients with C*04:01, where disease prognosis

59

measured by mechanical ventilation-free days was statistically significant after multiple

60

hypothesis correction (Bonferroni p = 0.0023), and may hold potential clinical value.

INTRODUCTION

64
65

Modern history has been plagued by deadly outbreaks, from the recurring influenza

66

(e.g. Spanish, Asian, Hong Kong, Avian) and HIV/AIDS viral pandemics, to bacterial

67

and protist infections causing tuberculosis and malaria. Since the early 2000s, we have

68

faced another threat: novel coronavirus infections causing severe respiratory illnesses

69

such as SARS, MERS and today, coronavirus disease 2019 − COVID-19 [1]. The

70

SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 respiratory disease is of

71

particular concern; not only does SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly, the symptoms of its

72

infection, when exhibited, are very similar to that of the cold and flu making it difficult to

73

diagnose, trace and contain. Further, infected individuals are affected differently. For

74

instance, older men (≥65 years old) with pre-existing medical conditions, such as

75

diabetes, appear at increased risk of progressing into the more severe phase of the

76

disease, yet SARS-CoV-2 infections affect all other age groups evenly except

77

occasionally in children and adolescents [2]. Most peculiar is that a high proportion of

78

individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic – as high as 43%

79

recorded in Iceland, a rate that appears to vary depending on jurisdictions and

80

populations [3-5]. As of now, the disparity in patient response to SARS-CoV-2 infection

81

is still eluding us.

82

The most efficient way to combat pathogens has been through the use of our

83

own defense mechanism: our acquired immunity. This is done by vaccination

84

campaigns that effectively prime our immune systems at the population level before we

85

even encounter pathogens. But design of effective vaccines must consider interactions

86

with host immune genes. The Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) are a group of such

87

genes encoding surface receptors that bind short peptide epitopes derived from

88

endogenous (class I) or exogenous (class II) antigens, including viral antigens, and they

89

facilitate killer or helper T cells to set off an appropriate immune response. The

90

magnitude of this response varies between patients as populations and individuals have

91

different composition of HLA genes and variable T cell repertoires. As such, HLA

92

induces a bias, which is responsible for documented host susceptibility to disease [6].

93

Some of the notable associations between HLA and disease are observed in AIDS

94

patients, with certain HLA alleles conferring protection [7]. In other cases, HLA has been

95

implicated with autoimmune diseases and diabetes [8-11]. The exact underlying

96

mechanisms behind these associations are unclear, but there is mounting evidence that

97

bacterial and viral infection may be the trigger for some [10] and that HLA plays a critical

98

role in the viral infection cycle, including viral entry into host cells [12].

99

Since the beginning of the pandemic, worldwide reports have emerged on HLA

100

associations with COVID-19, including our own [13-19]. Using publicly available

101

metatranscriptomic sequencing data made available at the pandemic onset, we had

102

demonstrated the utility of a high throughput in silico method for characterizing the HLA

103

types of COVID-19 patients from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and blood samples and

104

reported on prevalent alleles, including the DPA1*02:02P - DPB1*05:01P HLA-II

105

haplotype observed in 7 out of the 8 of patients from two small cohorts. Here, using

106

public RNA-seq sequencing data from a larger COVID-19 patient cohort with clinical

107

outcomes and demographics data [20], we report on HLA alleles with potential

108

diagnostic (DPA1*02:02) and prognostic (A*11:01, C*04:01 and DQA1*01:02) value in

METHODS

114

We downloaded Illumina NOVASEQ-6000 paired-end (50 bp) RNA-Seq reads from

115

libraries prepared from the blood samples of 126 hospitalized patients, with (n=100) or

116

without COVID-19 (n=26) (ENA project: PRJNA660067, accessions: SRX9033799-

117

SRX9033924). This data is part of a large-scale multi omics study from the Department

118

of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Albany Medical College, Albany, NY, USA, with

119

aims to analyze COVID-19 Severity and clinical as well as demographics data was

120

made available by the study authors [20] (GEO accession GSE157103). On each

121

patient RNA-Seq dataset, we ran HLA prediction software OptiType [21] (v1.3.4),

122

seq2HLA [22] (v2.3), and HLAminer [23] (v1.4 targeted assembly mode with defaults)

123

as described [19]. We tallied HLA class I (HLA-I) and class II (HLA-II, supported by

124

Seq2HLA and HLAminer only) allele predictions and for each patient we report the most

125

likely HLA allele (4-digit resolution), indicating HLA predictor tool support (Additional

126

file 1, tables S1 and S2).

127

Looking at class I and II alleles predicted in 10% or more of COVID-19 positive

128

patients (class I, n=17; class II, n=11) we calculated Fisher’s Exact Test (FET), first

129

testing for enrichment in COVID-19 positive vs. negative patients (R function fisher.test,

130

alternative = "greater"). For those same alleles (found in ≥10% patients) and inspecting

131

only the COVID-19 positive cohort, we tested for the probability of patient

132

hospitalization, as measured by the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) metric reported by the

133

original study authors, using FET. We looked further into the risk of hospitalization in

134

COVID-19 patients with vs. without these alleles using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimator

135

(R library survival), plotting the probability of remission using the “hospital-free days

136

post 45 day followup (days)” (HFD-45) metric reported by the study author as a proxy

137

for disease severity, with lower HFD-45 numbers indicating worse outcomes. Similarly,

138

we ran the KM estimator using another metric of disease severity, “ventilator-free days”,

139

which captures the most severe cases with COVID-19 patients suffering respiratory

140

deterioration and requiring mechanical ventilation. On each set we calculated the log-

141

rank p-value (R library survminer) and corrected for multiple hypothesis testing

142

(Bonferroni correction) using the number and patient abundance rank of class I (n=17)

143

or class II (n=11) HLA alleles observed in 10% or more of COVID-19 patients. We also

144

inspected the combined influence of HLA alleles and patient demographics data (age,

145

sex, ethnicity) on the hospitalization (ICU negative vs. positive) outcomes of COVID-19

146

patients, using odds-ratio calculations (R function fisher.test, and applying Haldane

147

correction [24] on zero values, when necessary).

RESULTS

150

We collated the HLA class I and class II predictions of three in silico HLA predictors

151

derived from the RNA-seq samples of a recent [20] COVID-19 positive patient cohort

152

(n=100) with control patients (n=26) who tested negative for COVID-19 (Additional file

153

1, Tables S1 and S2). Due to the limiting short read length (paired 50 bp) we chose to

154

first report on OptiType [21] and seq2HLA [22] class I and class II predictions, and count

155

the additional allele support from seq2HLA and HLAminer [23]. In all, we identify 17 and

156

11 HLA class I and class II alleles predicted in 10% or more of COVID-19 patients,

157

respectively (Tables 1 and 2). There were many more alleles predicted (133 class I and

158

101 class II in the COVID-19 positive cohort), but too few patients are represented at

159

lower cut-offs to compute meaningful statistics. First, we looked at the statistical

160

enrichment (Fisher’s Exact Test - FET) of each allele in the COVID-19 positive set,

161

compared to the COVID-19 negative control group. We find HLA-I A*30:02 and HLA-II

162

DPA1*02:02 allele enrichments nominally significant (FET p = 0.0417 and p = 0.0174)

163

at the 5% level (Tables 1 and 2). However, when Bonferroni correction is applied for

164

the number of HLA class I allele tests or when the abundance rank is factored in for

165

A*30:02, the test is not significant (n=17, Bonferroni p = 0.7080; n=10, Bonferroni p =

166

0.4165, respectively). For HLA-II DPA1*02:02, Bonferroni correction finds the test

167

insignificant at the α=0.05 level for the number of hypothesis, but significant for the

168

allele abundance rank (n=11, Bonferroni p = 0.1916; n=2, Bonferroni p = 0.0348).

169

COVID-19 positive patients could be further stratified into those who were

170

hospitalized and admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (Tables I and 2, ICU+), and those

171

who were not (Tables 1 and 2, ICU-). When computing FET statistics, we find HLA-I

172

A*11:01 and C*04:01 and HLA-II DQA1*01:02 significant at the α=0.05 level (Tables 1

173

and 2; p = 0.0078, p = 0.0087 and 0.0121, respectively) but none remain significant

174

after Bonferroni correction. The Overmyer study authors [20] reported important disease

175

severity metrics (HFD-45 and days without needing mechanical ventilation), which we

176

used to assess the remission probability of COVID-19 patients having a specific allele

177

using Kaplan-Meier estimation. We find patients of the Overmyer cohort with either

178

A*11:01 (Figure1a), C*04:01 (Figure 1b) or DQA1*01:02 (Figure 1c) to be at a

179

significant increased risk of hospitalization (log-rank p = 0.0099, p = 0.0082 and p =

180

0.0097). When applying multiple test corrections to account for allele abundance rank,

181

only C*04:01 (n=5, Bonferroni p = 0.0410) and DQA1*01:02 (n=2, Bonferroni p =

182

0.0194) remained significant at the α=0.05 level. When looking at patients needing

183

mechanical ventilators, a severe outcome in COVID-19 disease progression, we only

184

find patients with C*04:01 to be at a statistically significant increased risk (Figure 1d,

185

log-rank p = 0.0019). Multiple hypothesis test correction retains the statistical

186

significance of this allele when factoring both the number of HLA-I alleles tested and

187

C*04:01 abundance rank (n=17, Bonferroni p = 0.0023; n=5, Bonferroni p = 0.0095).

188

Looking at the influence of the aforementioned alleles in combination with simple

189

demographics (sex, age and ethnicity), we find that of the Overmyer cohort patients with

190

the DPA1*02:02 allele, those with a white ethnic background and females appear at an

191

increased risk of testing positive for COVID-19 (Figure 2; odds ratio [OR] = 6.33 [5.33–

192

7.34], FET p = 0.0491 and OR = 7.33 [6.18-8.48], FET p = 0.0326, respectively). The

193

association with gender is also observed in alleles A*11:01, C*04:01 and DQA1:01:02,

194

putting female COVID-19 patients of this cohort at an increased risk of hospitalization

195

for the class I alleles (Figure 2; OR = 12.09 [10.41-13.76], FET p = 0.0105 for both) and

196

male COVID-19 patients at increased risk for DQA1*02:02 (Figure 2; OR = 2.74 [2.69-

197

2.79], FET p = 0.0481). For patients with the latter HLA-II allele, minorities and younger

198

individuals (<65 years old) are also more at risk of hospitalization (Figure 2; OR = 4.08

199

[2.85-5.32], FET p = 0.0222 and OR = 3.62 [2.42-4.83], FET p = 0.0240, respectively).

200

In this cohort, we also find patients with A*11:01 in the younger age group (<65 years

201

old) at increased risk of hospitalization (Figure 2; OR = 9.54 [8.14-10.94], FET p =

202

0.0184) whereas for those with C*04:01, it appears a white ethnic background and a

203

more advanced age (≥65 years old) may be predisposing to ICU hospitalization (Figure

204

2; OR = 14.25 [12.24-16.26], FET p = 0.0053 and OR = 9.66 [8.27-11.05], FET p =

205

0.0188, respectively).

DISCUSSION

207
208

We have previously identified the DPA1*02:02 class II allele as being prevalent in two

209

other and independent cohorts, with patients of undisclosed ethnic background, but

210

hospitalized in Wuhan, China [19]. Of populations with reported allele frequencies and

211

an appreciable sampling size (≥100 individuals), only Hong Kong Chinese and

212

Japanese have DPA1*02:02 allele frequencies (55.8% and 43.5%, respectively; [25,26])

213

above its observed frequency (29.0%) in the COVID-19 positive cohort analyzed herein.

214

The frequency of this allele in other qualifying populations tends to be generally lower,

215

including in South African (Worcester, 15.6%), Norwegians (14.0%), Mexico Chiapas

216

Lacandon Mayans (6.7%), United Kingdom Europeans (4.3%) and Spain Navarre

217

Basques (2.2%). We note that the ethnic background of the Overmyer et al [20] cohort

218

is heterogeneous, and white individuals (of unknown ancestry) represent 45.1% and

219

(11/29) 37.9% of the COVID-19 positive cohort and its DPA1*02:02 subset,

220

respectively. In contrast, Asians represent only a minority of the cohort (1.9%) and

221

DPA1*02:02 subset (1/29~3.4%). It is important to note that, in the Overmyer cohort,

222

DPA1*02:02 is not statistically associated with increased risk of hospitalization. The

223

significant enrichment of this allele in the COVID-19 positive vs. negative cohorts (FET

224

p= 0.0174) across all individuals, but also when looking only at females (FET p= 0.0326)

225

or white individuals (FET p= 0.0491), and not any other demographics, may prove an

226

important disease marker, which would need to be validated with additional datasets

227

and in independent studies.

228

There are reports of disease associations with DPA1*02:02, DQA1*01:02,

229

C*04:01 and A*11:01, but they are few. Of note, the association of all aforementioned

230

alleles with narcolepsy [10,11] and a known trigger for this auto-immune disease

231

includes upper-airway infections and influenza vaccinations [27-32]. Susceptibility to

232

narcolepsy may in fact be an indirect effect of HLA class I and the HLA class II DP

233

isotype in response to viral and bacterial infections, including from influenza and

234

streptococcus [10,27,33,34]. It has since been reported that HLA-A*11 may be a

235

susceptibility allele to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in some populations [35] while

236

another report implicates HLA-I allele C*04:01 with high HIV viral loads [36]. Further, it

237

was recently demonstrated that MHC class II DR, DQ and DP isotypes play a role in

238

mediating the cross-species entry of bat influenza viruses in vitro in human/animal cell

239

lines and in mice where engineered MHC-II deficiency made them resistant to upper-

240

respiratory tract infections [12]. It is therefore not a stretch to envision an involvement

241

from these HLA class II isotypes in controlling the cellular entry of a broader range of

242

viral agents in vivo.

243

In a recent study examining HLA susceptibility based on SARS-CoV-2 derived

244

peptide (epitope) binding strengths [37], the HLA-I allele A*11:01 was in silico predicted

245

to bind a large number of SARS-CoV-2 derived peptides (n=750) with varying affinity

246

[IC50 range 4.95 – 498.19, median = 149.62, mean = 182.28], and has been

247

experimentally validated to bind SARS-CoV-2 peptide GLMWLSYFV (Tables S4 and S7

248

in Nguyen et al. [37]). In contrast, C*04:01 was only predicted in silico to bind six SARS-

249

CoV-2 peptides and at higher IC50 ranges [167.65 – 469.30, median = 291.06, mean =

epitopes to T cells and mount an appropriate immune response.

There have been a number of reports published on HLA alleles − COVID-19

253

associations this past year, and on cohorts from many jurisdictions including China [18],

Italy [13,14,16] and the UK [17]. Wang et al. [18] compared the HLA allele frequencies

255

between a cohort of 82 Chinese individuals and a control population of bone marrow

256

donors previously studied by the same group. Novelli and co-workers [14] HLA typed a

257

cohort of 99 Italian COVID-19 patients, and associated the observed allele frequencies

258

with the HLA types in a reference group of 1,017 Italian individuals also previously

259

studied by the same group. Correale et al. [13] and Pisanti et al. [16] followed a different

260

strategy; these two independent studies leveraged population scale genomics data

261

retrieved from the Italian Bone-Marrow Donors Registry and the National Civil

262

Protection Department. They correlated background HLA allele frequency data with

263

mortality and morbidity rates across Italy to reach at starkly different conclusions on

264

which HLA alleles may play a role in disease etiology and progression. Disagreement

265

between these two studies (also distinct from the results of the other Italian study by

266

Novelli et al.) highlight the importance of large cohorts with matched samples to infer

267

the patient HLA alleles with better statistical significance. Poulton et al. [17]

268

characterized the HLA types of 80 COVID-19 patients in the UK on waiting lists for

269

transplantation, and compared observed allele frequencies in comparison to a cohort of

270

10,000 deceased organ donors and a separate cohort of 308 SARS-CoV-2-negative

271

individuals also on waiting lists for transplantation, the latter representing a matched

272

demographics for the COVID-19 patients in their cohort. Interestingly, this is the only

273

study that had any overlap between the alleles they flagged as being statistically

274

significant and the lists published by other studies cited above. Not surprisingly, the

275

alleles they listed do not intersect with the alleles identified and presented herein and

276

the three alleles we published earlier on a very small group of only eight patients. It is

277

nonetheless intriguing to find little to no HLA allele overlap between these reports,

278

including with those associated with the 2003 SARS outbreak, a related respiratory

279

disease caused by coronavirus [15,38,39]. This could be explained, at least partially, by

280

geographical differences and varying population allele frequencies in those cohorts,

281

relatively small cohort sizes (<100 patients), differences in experimentation setup and/or

282

other factors, including comorbidity status, that may be acting independently of HLA.

CONCLUSIONS

284
285

Here, we predict HLA-I and HLA-II alleles from publicly available COVID-19 patient

286

blood RNA-seq samples and identified several putative biomarkers. In a previous study,

287

we had observed one of these biomarkers (DPA1*02:02), and we postulate that patients

288

with the allele may have an increased susceptibility for COVID-19. Further, other alleles

289

(A*11:01, C*04:01, DQA1*01:02) may be prognostic indicators of poor outcome.

290

However, although it is well established that patient HLA profiles play a significant role

291

in the onset and progression of infectious diseases in general, we caution against

292

drawing overreaching conclusions from regional, and often limited, observations. We

293

note that recently published studies associating HLA alleles and COVID-19, by and

294

large, disagree in their findings. We expect future studies with larger cohort sizes will

295

help bring a clearer picture of the role of patient HLA profiles, if any, in COVID-19

296

susceptibility and disease outcomes.

Figure 1. HLA alleles associated with higher risk of hospitalization in a COVID-19

500

positive patient cohort. COVID-19 positive patients were split into two groups per

501

allele tested, depending on whether they were predicted to have the HLA allele under

502

scrutiny or not. We ran the Kaplan-Meier estimator (R package survival) using the

503

Overmyer et al. cohort [20] HFD-45 metric for estimating the remission probability of

504

patients without or with alleles (a) A*11:01, (b) C*04:01 or (c) DQA1*01:02 and

505

mechanical ventilator-free days to estimate the statistical significance of the more

506

severe disease outcome observed in COVID-19 patients with (d) C*04:01. Log-rank p

507

values were calculated for each (R package survminer) and are indicated on the plots.

Figure 2. HLA alleles – demographics combinations with diagnostic (bottom) or

510

prognostic (top) potential in a COVID-19 cohort. We calculated the odds ratio (OR)

511

for each HLA-I and HLA-II alleles observed in 10% or more of patients, and plotted OR

512

and the influence of demographics for HLA alleles showing significant associations

513

(from Tables 1 and 2). First, looking at the influence of demographic characteristics

514

such as sex (male/female), age (65 years old or above/less than 65 years old) and

515

ethnicity (minority/white ethnic background) on the susceptibility of patients with these

516

alleles to test positive for COVID-19 (lower two panels), and on the risk associated with

517

ICU hospitalization (upper three panels). Red asterisks indicate significant demographic

518

characteristics (Fisher’s Exact Test) not corrected for multiple hypothesis tests.
