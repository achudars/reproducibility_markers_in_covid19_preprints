The Effects of Coronavirus Victimization Distress and Coronavirus Racial Bias on Mental

17

Health Among Black, Indigenous and Latinx Young Adults in the United States

18

Abstract

19

Background. People of color in the U.S. have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-

20

19 pandemic in terms of rates of infection and morbidity. Explanations for these disparities

21

include over-representation as essential workers and long-standing inequities in access to health

22

services. Prior to the pandemic, racial discrimination has been associated with depression and

23

general anxiety. However, the effect of discrimination and racial bias specific to the Coronavirus

24

on mental health has not been examined. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of

25

Coronavirus victimization distress and Coronavirus racial bias beliefs on the mental health of

26

young adult people of color.

27

Method. An online survey administered to a national sample of 350 Black, Indigenous and

28

Latinx adults (18 – 25 years) included Coronavirus health risks, prescription and financial

29

security, measure of depression and anxiety and 2 new psychometrically validated measures for

30

Coronavirus related victimization distress and racial bias.

31

Results. Employment, number of Coronavirus health risks, Coronavirus victimization distress

32

and Coronavirus racial bias were positively correlated with each other and with depression and

33

anxiety. By contrast, household income and perceived financial and prescription security were

34

negatively correlated with Coronavirus victimization, Coronavirus racial bias and with the

35

mental health indices. Structural equation modeling controlling for demographic variables

36

indicated perceived Coronavirus racial bias mediated the effect of Coronavirus victimization

37

distress on both mental health measures across all groups.

38

Conclusions. Results suggest the COVID-19 pandemic has created new pathways to mental

39

health disparities among young adults of color by reversing formerly protective factors such as

40

employment, and by exacerbating structural and societal inequities linked to race. Findings

41

highlight the necessity of creating mental health services tailored to the specific needs of

42

racial/ethnic minorities during the current and future health crises.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified existing racial/ethnic disparities in the United

45

States. People of color have higher risks of COVID-19 infection and mortality. Black,

46

Indigenous and Latinx adults are at disproportionally higher risk. For example, as of July 28,

47

2020, Black, Indigenous, and Latinx people in the U.S. compared with other racial/ethnic groups

48

accounted for greater proportions of Coronavirus infections among young adults ages 18 – 29

49

years (17.7%, 1.3%, 30.28%, respectively) and an even greater proportion of deaths (34.6%,

50

4.5%, 38.66%, respectively) (1). Disparities faced by people of color during the pandemic are

51

rooted in long-standing inequities in access to health services and health outcomes (2-4). These

52

include lower levels of treatment satisfaction and trust, utilization rate, and service outcome

53

resulting in delay and lack of adherence to treatment uptake (3-5). Compared with other

54

racial/ethnic groups Black, Indigenous and Latinx persons in the US also have higher rates of

55

CDC identified medical conditions associated with risk of severe illness from COVID-19,

56

including obesity, diabetes, asthma, and HIV (6-14). In addition, Black, Indigenous, and Latinx

57

adults are more likely to be employed as lower skilled workers, and during the current crises, as

58

essential workers (15, 16), which increases risk of COVID-19 exposure. In 2018, approximately

59

20% of employed Black and Latinx men worked in service occupations, compared to 13% of

60

White and Asian men (16). Although 11.9% of all workers are Black, they account for 17% of

61

workers in Coronavirus frontline industries such as grocery and drug stores, public

62

transportation, trucking, and health care (15). In addition to these longstanding disparities in

63

healthcare, stay at home orders and reallocation of pharmaceuticals for emergency care have

64

created barriers to prescriptions for health conditions related to higher risk for Coronavirus,

65

placing people in lower economic strata and racially segregated communities at higher risk (17).

66

Mental health among people of color

67

People of color also suffer higher mental health risks compared to non-Hispanic whites

68

(5, 18, 19). The National Center for Health Statistics (20) reported that Indigenous populations

69

are 50% more likely to report hopelessness, worthlessness, and feelings of nervousness or

70

restlessness compared to non-Hispanic Whites and 80% more likely to report frequent sadness.

71

Black and Latinx women also report significantly greater depressive symptomatology than non-

72

Hispanic White females (18, 21). Although the prevalence rates of major depression and general

73

anxiety among Black and Latinx are often reported to be similar or lower than non-Hispanic

74

Whites, these findings have been attributed to the fact people of color in the US seek mental

75

health clinical care at rates well below their need and face discrimination during diagnosis and

76

treatment, misdiagnosis and clinician bias (2, 5, 22-24). Other studies suggest the long-lasting

77

effects of depression may be higher for African American and Caribbean Black men compared to

78

non-Hispanic Whites (56% versus 38.6%) (25).

79

Factors contributing to mental health problems among people of color

80

The health, economic and employment disparities described above for people of color

81

also contribute to increased internalizing disorders. Medical disparities currently identified as

82

increasing Coronavirus risk, have previously been shown to be associated with poor mental

83

health in studies on the general population and on people of color specifically. For example,

84

obesity and asthma have been associated with mood disorders and health-related quality of life

85

among Black and Latinx populations in the U.S. (26-30). Relatedly, inadequate access to health

86

care also contributes to depression and anxiety (31). Lower socioeconomic status (SES),

87

financial and food insecurity in general have been associated with higher levels of depression

88

and anxiety among Black and Latinx populations (32-39); although some studies found that

89

higher SES is associated with depression among Black people (40-42). Past research has

90

repeatedly reported on the protective effect of employment on mental health (43, 44). However,

91

during the pandemic, employed individuals, especially those in positions involving in-person

92

contact with others during working hours, are at higher risks of COVID-19 infection (45). Since

93

racial/ethnic minorities are more likely to be employed in health care or low-wage jobs that are

94

considered essential during the pandemic (31, 46), emerging reports indicate they are

95

experiencing higher levels of depression and anxiety (47). Finally, although in general gender

96

and sexual minority status among young adults is associated with increases in depression and

97

anxiety (48, 49), intersecting ethnic and sexual minority identities have been identified as an

98

increased risk factor for depression and suicidal ideation among Latinx and Black sexual

99

minority men and women (50-54) and across people of color identified as transgender females

100

(55, 56).

The relationship between racial/ethnic discrimination and systemic

102

racism on depression and anxiety among people of color

103

People of color experience unique stressors related to their marginalized social identity

104

that adversely contribute to depression and anxiety (57), including explicit racial/ethnic

105

discrimination and microaggressions (58-61). Intergenerational trauma created by American

106

slavery, colonialism, Jim Crow laws, and segregation, has been shown to effect both physical

107

and psychological health among Black people (62-64). Loss and violation of sacred lands and a

108

history of segregation of American Indian boarding schools and food programs is a significant

109

stressor for Indigenous persons (12, 65). For Latinx people, studies have found significant

110

association among documentation status (66, 67), fear of deportation (68), acculturation stress

111

(69-71), and mental health status. Although to date, the effect of racial bias associated

112

specifically with the Coronavirus on mental health has not been examined, the negative impact

113

of racial/ethnic discrimination on physical and mental health has been well documented (58, 72-

114

76). Based on the stress and coping framework (77), racial/ethnic discrimination is a social

115

stressor that affects physiological and psychological responses such as increased levels of heart

116

rate, cortisol secretions, blood pressure, emotional reactivity, and reliance on maladaptive

117

emotion-regulation strategies (72). These in turn lead to higher risks of both physical health

118

problems such as obesity and cardiovascular disease (78-80), and internalizing disorders such as

119

depression and anxiety (73).

120

Prior research on populations facing contagious disease

121

discrimination

122

Research on victimization distress due to contagious diseases such as HIV, H1N1, and

123

the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has found that contagious disease

124

discrimination is associated with long-term negative mental health outcomes including

125

depression and anxiety (81-84). For example, in a study on SARS-related stigma in Hong Kong,

126

residents who lived in the first officially identified site of community outbreak reported they

127

were marginalized in their work, social, and home environments and experienced high levels of

128

psychological distress, which did not decrease during the post-SARS era (85, 86). Prior biases

129

against marginalized social groups also play a role in disease discrimination. For example, in

130

Malaysia, during the HINI Flu epidemic, farmers held misconceptions that societal “out-groups”

131

such as sexual minorities, the homeless and sex workers had higher risks of infections, which in

132

turn led to discrimination against these groups (87).

133

Individuals who have personally experienced a negative event may attribute the

134

victimization to various factors, such as personal reasons and discrimination (88). Following an

135

experience of Coronavirus related bullying or discrimination, people of color may attribute the

136

event to racial/ethnic discrimination based on beliefs that the Coronavirus has increased systemic

137

racism in the US. The attributional ambiguity perspective suggests that attributions to racial

138

discrimination rather than personal attributions may be self-protective, buffer the harmful effect

139

of negative events, and contribute to better mental health (89). However, recent studies have

140

suggested that there are still harmful effects on mental health with attributions to discrimination

141

(73). This suggests that perceived increases in systemic racism as a consequence of the

142

Coronavirus pandemic may not only be directly related to increases in depression and anxiety but

143

may mediate the influence of Coronavirus victimization on these mental health indices.

144

145

146

Although the devastating impact of COVID-19 on the health of people of color in the
U.S. has been well established, there is a paucity of research on how individual and societal

147

factors are affecting the mental health of these populations. The current study conducted an

148

anonymous online survey in April 2020 to examine the association among demographic

149

variables, Coronavirus victimization distress, and Coronavirus racial bias with depression and

150

anxiety among Black, Latinx and Indigenous young adults. The following hypotheses were

151

tested:
1. Employment status, sexual and gender minority identity, lower household income,

152

153

financial and prescription insecurity, and number of COVID-19 health risks will be associated

154

with higher levels of depression and anxiety among young adults of color.
2. Higher levels of victimization distress and perceived racial bias specifically related to

155

156

the Coronavirus will be directly associated with depression and anxiety among young adults of

157

color.

158

3. Coronavirus racial bias will mediate the association between Coronavirus victimization
on

159

distress and depression and anxiety among young adults of color. The conceptual model for this

160

mediating effect is provided in Table 1.

Methods

168

169

170

Participants
Data were collected during April 2020 as part of a larger Internet-based national survey

171

on the biological, psychological and social impact of the Coronavirus pandemic among young

172

adults from diverse racial/ethnic groups. For the current study, eligible participants self-

173

identified as Black, Indigenous, or Latinx; were between 18 – 25 years of age; self-reported they

174

did not currently have the Coronavirus; lived in the United States for more than one year; and

175

could read English at an eighth-grade level.

176

Procedure and data validation

177

Recruitment was conducted by Qualtrics XM. Qualtrics XM is an aggregator of survey

178

panel websites and can recruit individuals who have signed up to take paid surveys across

179

multiple sites. Participants are paid in points which they can exchange for gift cards. For the

180

current study, Qualtrics XM sent emails or provided posts to young adults who had signed up to

181

take surveys through various survey websites and offered compensation worth $16.50 converted

182

into the survey panel’s point system. The emails and posts briefly described the study and

183

provided a link to a screener on another Qualtrics site. The screener included questions on

184

participants’ age, race/ethnicity, assigned sex at birth, gender, sexual orientation, the US state

185

and zip code in which they lived, length of time living in the U.S., geographic region, living

186

situation, employment and student status.

187

The target goal was to recruit a minimum of 100 participants from each of the 3

188

racial/ethnic groups and to over sample for individuals living in rural areas to obtain a

189

representative geographic sample. A Qualtrics system feature excluded participants who did not

190

meet eligibility criteria and prevented them from re-entering the screener. Manual data validation

191

protocols were established to exclude fraudulent or repeat participants; consistency between age

192

and date of birth; inconsistency between reported city in which the survey was taken and zip

193

code, and responses with identical IP addresses. Qualtrics also includes a speed check to exclude

194

participants who respond in less than half the time of the median survey response.

195

Approximately 57,000 people were sent emails or posts. A total of 418 Black, 223 Indigenous,

196

and 195 Latinx participants took the screener, with 469 meeting eligibility requirements. Of

197

those 350 (74.63%) completed the survey and passed the speed check. For the purposes of this

198

study, an additional 38 respondents were eliminated if they reported they had the Coronavirus

199

and 7 were eliminated for missing data on the Coronavirus Racial Bias Scale, resulting in a final

200

sample of 305 (42% Black, 28% Indigenous; 30% Latinx).

201

Following the screener, eligible individuals were immediately sent to a page providing

202

informed consent information. Participants who selected “I agree” at the bottom of the informed

203

consent page, were redirected to the main survey which consisted of 204 items which took on

204

average 14.02 minutes (SD = 33.84); some participants took an hour or more to complete the

205

survey resulting in the large standard deviation. Participants were able to quit the survey at any

206

time by closing the survey window and their data was not included in analysis. At the end of the

207

survey, online resources on health information and Coronavirus prevention were provided.

Qualtrics uses unique identification numbers for each participant so that identifiable information

209

and survey data are not stored on Qualtrics servers. The identity of participants and their contact

210

information were therefore unknown to the investigators. Participants received the agreed

211

amount of incentive within seven days after they completed the survey to allow for data quality

212

checks. The study was approved by the University Institutional Review Board.

Demographic information
Demographic information collected during screening included age, gender, race and

216

ethnicity, sexual orientation, employment (full or part-time; whether one was employed as an

217

“essential worker”), student status, and region (urban, suburban, exurban, rural). Additional

218

information included: household income; financial security; prescription security; and an 8 item

Coronavirus Victimization Distress Scale (CVDS)

223

226

The Coronavirus Victimization Distress Scale (CVDS) is a 5-item scale adapted from

227

items in the Daily Heterosexist Experiences Questionnaire (90), the LGBT People of Color

228

Microaggressions Scale (91), and the Adolescent Discrimination Distress Index (ADDI) (75).

229

The items assess distress in response to different instances of victimization (e.g. “teased or

230

bullied”, “physically threatened”) resulting from other’s believing the participant was a

Coronavirus risk. Each item was formatted as “I have been […] because someone thought I was

232

infected with the Coronavirus.” Responses were on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = It never

233

happened, 2 = It happened but did not upset me; 3 = It happened and upset me a little; 4 = It

234

happened and upset me moderately; 5 = It happened and upset me quite a bit).

235

Coronavirus Racial Bias Scale (CRBS)

236

The Coronavirus Racial Bias Scale (CRBS) is a 9-item scale developed to assess

237

participants’ beliefs about how the Coronavirus is negatively affecting societal attitudes toward

238

one’s race/ethnicity. Sample items include “I believe the country has become more dangerous for

239

people in my racial/ethnic group because of fear of the Coronavirus”; “People of my

240

race/ethnicity are more likely to lose their job because of the Coronavirus”; Negative social

241

media posts against people of my race/ethnicity have increased because of the Coronavirus.”

242

Participants indicated their Coronavirus racial bias beliefs on a 4-point Likert-type scale (1 –

243

Strongly disagree, 4 – Strongly agree).

244

Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)

245

The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess the frequency of

246

past-month experiences with depressive symptoms (92). Sample Items include “Trouble falling

247

asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much” and “Feeling down, depressed or hopeless”.

248

Responses are scored on a 4-point scale, anchored by (0) Not at All and (3) Nearly Every Day.

249

Composite scale scores are computed by the average of item responses. In prior studies,

250

Cronbach’s alpha for this scale ranged from .79 to .91 across adults identifying as Black,

Indigenous, and Latinx (93-95). The measurement invariance of the PHQ-9 across Black,

252

Indigenous, Latinx and Non-Hispanic White young adults has been established (96-98).

253

General Anxiety Disorder Screener (GAD-7)
The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener (GAD-7) (99) was used to assess

254

255

anxiety symptoms of participants during the past month. Sample items include “Being so restless

256

that it is hard to sit still” and “Feeling afraid as if something awful might happen”. Participants

257

respond to a 4‐point scale, anchored by (0) not at all and (3) nearly every day. Composite scale

258

scores are computed by the average of item responses. In prior studies, Cronbach’s alpha for

259

GAD-7 ranged from .79 to .91 across adults identifying as Black, Indigenous, and Latinx (100-

260

104).

261

Data analysis plan

262

Descriptive statistics were calculated for all demographic variables. This was followed by

263

analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Chi-square tests to assess differences on these variables

264

among the 3 racial/ethnic groups. To determine the independence and structure of the

265

Coronavirus Victimization Distress Scale and the Coronavirus Racial Bias Scale, several

266

confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were conducted followed by Cronbach alphas to assess

267

resulting scale reliability. Measurement invariance was then tested to assess whether the

268

constructs of the Coronavirus Victimization Distress Scale and Coronavirus Racial Bias Scale

269

were the same across the three racial/ethnic minority groups (105). Correlational analyses and

270

ANOVAs were then conducted to examine: (1) the associations among Coronavirus

271

victimization distress, Coronavirus racial bias, and demographic variables; and (2) differences on

depression and anxiety levels based on demographic variables, Coronavirus victimization

273

distress and Coronavirus racial bias.

274

Structural equation modeling (SEM) using the R-4.0.1. and lavaan package (106, 107) to

275

test the a priori conceptual model based on research hypotheses, which assessed the hypothesis

276

that Coronavirus racial bias exerted a mediating role of Coronavirus racial bias on the effect of

277

Coronavirus victimization distress on depression and anxiety. Two SEM analyses were

278

conducted, with the first analysis estimated the effect across all racial/ethnic groups, and the

279

second multigroup analysis estimated the effect for each racial/ethnic group separately. An

280

alternative model was then examined, which reversed the relationship between Coronavirus

281

racial bias and Coronavirus victimization distress, with the Coronavirus victimization distress

282

mediated the relationship between Coronavirus racial bias and depression or anxiety.

283

Goodness of fit indices included the comparative fit index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis Index

284

(TLI), and the root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA). A fit of > 0.95 for the CFI

285

and TLI and < 0.06 for RMSEA was considered to indicate adequate fit (108). To test the

286

indirect effects for statistical significance, the bias-corrected bootstrapping approach was

287

adopted as it is robust against the violation of normal distribution assumptions for both the

288

sampling distribution and indirect effect (109). One thousand re-samples were drawn to estimate

289

the standard errors of the indirect effects and their 95% confidence intervals.

The sample included 305 participants (Mean age = 20.84, SD = 2.19, range =18 – 25)

293

self-identified as, Black (N = 128; Mean age = 20.71, SD = 2.15), Indigenous (N = 86; Mean age

294

= 21.30, SD = 2.41) and Latinx (N = 91%; Mean age = 20.58, SD = 1.99). An ANOVA

295

indicated no significant age differences across groups (F2, 203 = 2.80, p = .06). Demographic data,

296

percentages and Chi square tests of significance provided in Table 1 for each racial/ethnic group.

297

Across race/ethnicity the majority identified as cisgender females or cisgender males, reported

298

heterosexual sexual orientation, were full or part-time employed (60.33%; including 35.74%

299

essential workers); and approximately half were students. Nearly one third (29.8%) indicated

300

they felt financially insecure (“can’t make ends meet”). Approximately 45.57% reporting an

301

annual household income below the national poverty rate for a family of 5 ($30,680) (110).

302

On average participants reported 1.52 COVID-19 pre-existing health risks (range = 0 – 8).

303

The mean and standard deviation (SD) for health risks for each group was: Black (Mean = .75,

304

SD = 1.34, range = 0 – 7); Indigenous (Mean = 1.03, SD = 1.85, range = 0 – 8); and Latinx

305

(Mean = .90, SD = 1.43, range = 0 – 6). The distributions are highly skewed (skewness > 2 for

306

each group), as more than half of Black (65.62%), Indigenous (56.98%), and Latinx (53.84%)

307

participants did not report COVID-19 health risks. As indicated in Table 1, across groups thirty-

308

seven percent reported difficulty filling prescriptions during the past month. Chi-square tests

309

yielded no significant differences among the three racial/ethnic groups for the above

310

demographic categories, except for region, which included a higher percentage of Black

311

participants in rural areas.

314

As a prerequisite for the SEM analysis, three confirmatory factor analyses were

315

conducted to determine the independence and structure of the Coronavirus Victimization

316

Distress Scale (CVDS) and the Coronavirus Racial Bias Scale (CRBS). Model 1 included all

317

items on both scales. Table 2 provides factor loadings of items on each scale. In this model,

318

modification indices (MI = 39.54) indicated a strong correlated error between item 7 on the

319

CRBS (“Due to the Coronavirus I have been cyberbullied because of my race/ethnicity”) and the

320

CVDS (111). For that reason, item 7 on the CRBS was removed from the scale. Model 2

321

included all five items on the CVDS and 8 items on the CRBS. Finally, to yield higher reliability

322

and communalities for the SEM (112), Model 3 was developed, with all five items on CVDS and

323

four parcels constructed from the 8-item CRBS, which were created by randomly pairing two

324

items together and calculating the mean.

This item was removed from final scale based on analysis of confirmatory factor analysis.

Table 3 shows the χ2 statistic and the global model fit indices of the three hypothesized

331

CFA models. Model 2 had a relatively good fit based on all three model fit indices including the

332

global fit index root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), the Comparative Fix Index

333

(CFI), and the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI). However, model 3 fit the data best among all tested

334

models, and met rule of thumb criteria for adequate fit (RMSEA < .06, CFI and TLI > .95) (108).

335

Both resultant scales had high demonstrated internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = .91 for

CVDS, Cronbach’s alpha = .86 for CRBS). The two scales were positively correlated (r = .43, p

Measurement invariance of the CVDS and the CRBS across Black, Latinx

344

and Indigenous

345

The measurement invariance of model 3 across Black, Indigenous, and Latinx participants was

346

examined (See Table 4 for detailed results). The sequence of tests of measurement invariance

347

included configural invariance, metric invariance, scalar invariance, and strict invariance. The

348

null hypothesis of the χ2 difference test was that the more restricted invariance model (e.g.,

349

metric invariance) fit the data equally as well as the less restricted invariance model (e.g.,

350

configural invariance). Thus, the χ2 difference test of the two nested invariance models in the

351

sequence should ideally be non-significant or there should be no material change in RMSEA

352

(105, 113). With the exception of the invariance model, the models were not statistically

353

different, and the RMSEA change of strict invariance from scalar invariance did not increase

354

noticeably (change ≤ .01), supporting measurement invariance of the CVDS and CRBS across

355

the three racial/ethnic groups.

Racial/ethnic and demographic differences on the CVDS and CRBS
Mean scores on the CVDS and CRBS among the 3 racial/ethnic groups are illustrated in

360

Table 5. An ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc comparison (p = .001) indicated Black

361

and Latinx participants had significantly higher scores on the CRBS than Indigenous respondents,

362

but no significant racial/ethnic differences emerged for the CVDS. Gender minority persons

363

reported higher scores on the CVDS (F(2,302) = 7.78, p = .001) and CRBS (F(2,302) = 4.39, p

364

= .013) than cisgender females (p=.01, p<.001, respectively), but did not differ from males.

365

There were no significant differences between participants employed as essential workers and

366

those employed in other positions, so employment was combined as one category. Employed

367

participants compared to non-employed reported higher scores on the CVDS (F(1,303) = 15.65,

368

p < .001) and the CRBS (F(1,303) = 4.77, p =.03). There were no significant differences between

369

participants who did not have any prescription needs or were able to fill their prescriptions and as

370

a group these participants reported lower levels of CVDS (F(1,303) = 70.33, p < .001) and

371

CRBS (F(1,303) = 17.15, p < .001) than those reporting prescription difficulties. Pearson’s

372

correlation tests indicated significant positive correlations between the number of COVID-19

373

health risks and scores on the CVDS (r = .39, p < .001) and CRBS (r = 17, p < .01). There were

no differences on CVDS and CRBS based on age, sexual orientation, financial security, or

annual household income.

examine relationships among demographic variables and the CVDS and CRBS and the mental

383

health indices (See Table 6). Consistent with hypotheses 1, employment status, sexual

orientation, and number of COVID-19 health risks were significantly and positively associated

and negatively associated with the mental health indices. There were no racial/ethnic, age,

Tests of the mediation hypothesis
As illustrated in Table 6, consistent with hypothesis 2, scores on the CVDS and CRBS

394

were significantly and positively associated with depression and anxiety measures. Structural

395

equation modeling (SEM) was conducted to test the third hypothesis that perceived Coronavirus

396

racial bias mediates the effect of Coronavirus victimization distress on depression and anxiety.

397

Gender, age, sexual orientation, financial security, COVID-19 health risks, prescription security,

398

and employment status were added as covariates based on significant associations between these

399

factors and studied variables. Household income was not included as a covariate since there were

400

14.43% missing data, and it was unrelated to mental health, CVDS or CRBS. To accommodate

401

the use of categorical exogenous variables, parameters were estimated using weighted least

402

squares with robust standard errors (WLSMV) (107). Missing data (N = 9) on sexual orientation

403

were handled by listwise deletion (107). Model fit statistics are summarized for two SEM

404

analyses in Table 7. The first analysis, which posited Coronavirus racial bias as the mediator of

405

the effect of Coronavirus victimization distress on depression and anxiety, with racial/ethnic

406

groups added as a covariate, showed adequate fit on all three fit indices including the RMSEA

407

(.034), 90% CI [.019 .047], CFI (.980), and TCL (.972). Based on the same model, a multigroup

analysis for three racial/ethnic minority groups was then conducted and adequate fit (RMSEA

The first analysis (Fig 2) which included all participants and race/ethnicity as a covariate

generated the best model fit statistics with sufficient power. Table 8 illustrates the standardized

416

direct, indirect, and total effects of Coronavirus victimization distress on depression and anxiety

417

through Coronavirus racial bias. In this model, Coronavirus victimization distress had significant

indirect effects on depression and anxiety (ß = .102, p =.006, 95% CI [.023, 0.115], ß = .095, p

419

=.006, 95% CI [.024, .117], respectively); direct and total effects were non-significant. The

analysis indicates that Coronavirus racial bias beliefs fully accounted for the influence of

Coronavirus victimization distress on depression and anxiety.

Test of Alternative Hypothesis
To further investigate support for the model above, a third SEM analysis considered an

436

alternative model which posited Coronavirus victimization distress as the mediator of the effect

437

of Coronavirus racial bias on depression and anxiety. We found an acceptable fit based on values

438

of RMSEA and CFI, but the TLI (.927) did not support adequate fit (See Table 7). Moreover, the

439

standardized direct, indirect, and total effects were not statistically significant.

440

Exploratory Analysis

441

The Black subsample had adequate power (=.80) to conduct the SEM; however, the

442

Indigenous and Latinx groups needed another six and two participants, respectively, to achieve

443

sufficient power (114). To inform future studies, we conducted exploratory analysis to examine

444

the same model separately for the three racial/ethnic minority groups. Table 9 presents the

445

standardized direct, indirect, and total effects of Coronavirus victimization distress on depression

446

and anxiety through Coronavirus racial bias for each racial/ethnic minority group. Similar to the

447

results of the main model, significant indirect effects on depression were found for both

448

Indigenous (ß = .146, p =. 083, 95% CI [.011, .226]) and Black (ß = .090, p =.032, 95% CI

Discussion
People of color in the United States have been disproportionately impacted by the

461

COVID-19 pandemic in terms of rates of infection and morbidity. Explanations for these

462

disparities include over-representation as essential workers and long-standing inequities in

463

financial security and access to health services associated with racial/ethnic discrimination. Prior

464

to the pandemic, racial and ethnic discrimination has been associated with poor mental health.

465

Our data demonstrate that in addition to employment and health risks, victimization experiences

466

and perceived increases in systemic racial biases specifically associated with the COVID-19

467

pandemic are related to higher levels of depression and anxiety among Black, Indigenous and

468

Latinx young adults across geographic regions of the U.S.

469

Prior studies have indicated that employment is a protective factor against mental health

470

problems (43, 44). However, as indicated by the present study, the COVID-19 pandemic

471

represents a unique situation in which young adults of color who are employed face greater risk

472

for depression and anxiety. Our study suggests this is due not only to the infection risks

473

associated with work outside the home during this period, but to victimization by others based on

474

social perceptions that people of color are more likely to be infected with the virus. Past research

475

has also shown that sexual and gender minority status, medical conditions and financial

33

476

insecurity have direct impact on depression and anxiety among Black, Indigenous and Latinx

477

young adults (26, 27, 32-42, 48-56). Our results are consistent with past research indicating the

478

above factors are associated with internalizing disorders, and also demonstrates that during the

479

COVID-19 pandemic, prescription insecurity can contribute to mental health risk. Prior research

480

has shown an association between the pre-existing conditions now associated with increased

481

Coronavirus risk. Since the incidence of these pre-existing conditions are disproportionately high

482

among people of color, in particular obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic illness

483

(6-14, 115-119), it is not surprising that our study demonstrated an association between the

484

number of Coronavirus health risks and mental health indices. Of note, is that 28% and 22% of

485

our participants identified as sexual or gender minorities, respectively. As both persons of color

486

and members of sexual and gender minority groups, the current COVID-19 crisis is likely

487

exacerbating mental health stressors due to lack of access to the medical care resulting from

488

multiple barriers such as medical mistrust, provider bias, and lack of insurance (2, 5, 22-24).

489

Coronavirus victimization distress and Coronavirus racial bias

490

This study provides evidence for the psychometric validity of two new scales: The

491

Coronavirus Victimization Distress Scale and the Coronavirus Racial Bias Scale. These

492

scales offered the opportunity to examine the relationship among Coronavirus specific

493

discrimination and perceived racial bias, demographic factors, and mental health. We

494

found that participants who were employed and reported prescription insecurity and more

495

COVID-19 health risks reported higher levels of Coronavirus victimization and

496

Coronavirus racial bias. These findings underscore the fact, that in addition to health and

497

economic disparities, Black, Indigenous and Latinx young adults are bearing a

498

disproportionate social burden during the current health crises.

34

The level of Coronavirus victimization distress and percentage of participants

499

500

reporting other risk factors did not differ across different racial/ethnic groups, with one

501

exception: Black and Latinx respondents reported higher levels of Coronavirus racial bias

502

than Indigenous young adults. This finding may be explained by news and social media

503

reports during April 2020 at the time this study was conducted. These reports identified

504

COVID-19 infections among Black and Latinx as the most vulnerable groups for

505

COVID-19 infection and death (6, 120), with outbreaks on tribal lands largely ignored by

506

the federal government, mainstream media and online tracking (121); although recent

507

studies suggest a relationship between household characteristics and infection rates on

508

reservations (122). Thus, at the time this survey was conducted, Indigenous participants

509

may have been less likely to have been exposed to public expressions of Coronavirus

510

related racial bias against their group.

511

Results of our main SEM analysis for the full sample indicate that Coronavirus

512

victimization distress was not directly associated with mental health, as the effect was fully

513

mediated by Coronavirus racial bias beliefs. This finding was strengthened by the results of the

514

alternative SEM model which did not find any mediation effect of Coronavirus victimization

515

distress on the relationship of Coronavirus racial bias to mental health indices. These findings

516

may be explained by prior work on attribution theory, suggesting that in certain instances

517

members of marginalized groups may attribute negative social experiences to racial

518

discrimination, which in turn has a harmful effect on mental health (73, 88). Thus, participants in

519

the present study may have attributed the bullying, threats, and unfair treatment described in the

520

Coronavirus Victimization Distress Scale items to perceived increases in racial biases created by

521

the pandemic.

522

Although the results of separate group SEM analysis must be viewed with caution given

523

the smaller sample size resulting in lower statistical power, they raise questions for future

524

research. Similar to the results of the main model, for Black and Indigenous participants,

525

Coronavirus racial bias continued to mediate the effects of Coronavirus victimization distress on

526

depression, although the effect was not significant for anxiety. By contrast, for Latinx

527

participants, Coronavirus victimization distress had significant direct effects on depression and

528

anxiety which was not mediated by perceived Coronavirus racial bias. One explanation for this

529

finding, which needs further investigation, is the statistically powerful effect that sexual minority

530

status had on mental health indices among the Latinx respondents. Thirty-three percent of Latinx

531

participants identified as sexual minorities in this sample. Thus, these young adults may have

532

been more likely to attribute Coronavirus victimization to social biases against sexual minorities

533

than to discrimination based on their ethnicity (123).

534

Limitations and future directions

535

To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the relationship to mental health of

536

victimization distress and perceived racial bias directly related to the Coronavirus among Black,

537

Indigenous and Latinx young adults. However, due to the cross-sectional nature of the survey,

538

we are unable to interpret the results as definitive of mediation or causation. It will be important

539

for future studies to examine the longitudinal impact of Coronavirus victimization distress and

540

associated racial bias beliefs on mental health among young adults within these populations. In

541

addition, our data collection and recruitment methods yielded a geographically diverse national

542

sample of Black, Indigenous and Latinx young adults; however, this methodology does not allow

543

for absolute certainty that inclusion criteria were met and also limited participation those with

544

Internet or mobile phone access and who had previously registered for online surveys.

545

This study developed and psychometrically validated new measures of victimization and

546

racial bias associated with the current pandemic. This validation was limited to the sample

547

surveyed and future research will assess the extent to which it will be validated on other Black,

548

Indigenous and Latinx populations as well as other racial/ethnic groups in the U.S. For example,

549

although the infection and morbidity rate of Asian heritage groups in the U.S. has not met levels

550

seen among the populations included in this study, since April, reports of Coronavirus

551

victimization and racial bias against Asian groups has increased and is worthy of study (124).

552

Relatedly we found somewhat different patterns in the relationship of victimization distress and

553

racial bias to mental health indices among the 3 different groups. Studies with larger sample

554

sizes to achieve necessary power for each of these groups will help understand the extent to

555

which these differences will be replicated. Finally, our data also suggest, that for some

556

populations, minority stress associated with sexual orientation may have a greater influence on

557

interpretations of Coronavirus related victimization. It will be fruitful to examine if this is tied to

558

the legacy of HIV/AIDS discrimination among sexual minority young adults (125).

559

Conclusions

560

The mental health of people of color in the United States has been associated with

561

longstanding experiences of racial and ethnic discrimination and systemic bias. This study

562

highlights how the current COVID-19 pandemic has added to these mental health burdens

563

through increases in Coronavirus victimization and perceived racial bias experienced by Black,

564

Indigenous and Latinx young adults. These findings also demonstrate how an infectious disease

565

crisis can reverse the usual protective effects of employment on mental health, when working

566

people of color are more likely to be employed in settings that increase their exposure to

567

infection and subsequent social bias. In addition, this study underscores the deleterious effects on

568

mental health of Coronavirus health risks and associated prescription insecurity and the

569

continuing vulnerabilities associated with financial insecurity and sexual minority status. In

570

addition to ongoing efforts to increase multicultural mental health services, these findings

571

highlight the urgency of mental health services tailored to the specific needs of racial/ethnic

572

minorities during the current and future health crises.
