Abstract
Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused an unprecedented
health crisis around the world, not least because of its heterogeneous clinical
presentation and course. The new information on the pandemic emerging daily has
made it challenging for healthcare workers (HCWs) to stay current with the latest
knowledge, which could influence their attitudes and practices during patient care.
Methods: This study is a follow-up evaluation of changes in HCWs’ knowledge,
attitudes, and practices as well as anxiety levels regarding COVID-19 since the
beginning of the pandemic. Data were collected through an anonymous, predesigned,
self-administered questionnaire that was sent online to HCWs in Saudi Arabia.
Results: The questionnaire was sent to 1500 HCWs, with a 63.8% response rate
(N=957). The majority of respondents were female (83%), and the most common age
group was 31–40 years (52.2%). Nurses constituted 86.3% of the respondents. HCWs
reported higher anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic which increased from 4.91±2.84
to 8.6±2.27 on an 11-point Likert scale compared to other viral outbreaks. HCWs
believed that their own preparedness as well as that of their hospital’s intensive care
unit (ICU) or emergency room (ER) was higher during the COVID-19 pandemic than
during the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus pandemic (2012–2015). About
58% of HCWs attended one or more simulations concerning the management of
COVID-19 patients in their ICU/ER, and nearly all had undergone N95 mask fit testing.
The mean score of HCWs’ knowledge of COVID-19 was 9.89/12. For most respondents
(94.6%), the perception of being at increased risk of infection was the main cause of
anxiety related to COVID-19; the mean score of anxiety over COVID-19 increased from
4.91±2.84 before to 8.6±2.27 during the pandemic in Saudi Arabia.
Conclusions: HCWs’ anxiety levels regarding COVID-19 have increased since a
pandemic was declared. It is vital that healthcare facilities provide more emotional and
psychological support for all HCWs.
Keywords: COVID-19, changing KAP, healthcare worker.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused an unprecedented health
crisis around the world and has surprised healthcare workers (HCWs) because of its
wide dynamic and heterogeneous clinical presentation, from asymptomatic to critical
illness leading to hospitalization and death.[1] The rapid evolution of available literature
and new information on the pandemic emerging daily has made it challenging for HCWs
to stay current with the latest knowledge, which could influence their attitudes and
practices during patient care. Additionally, basic principles of infection prevention and
control (IPC) are more widely recognized and implemented by HCWs in Saudi Arabia,
including hand hygiene, personal protective equipment (PPE) compliance, and N95 fit
testing.[2] The previous experience of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(MERS-CoV) outbreaks at several hospitals [3-9] has enhanced IPC knowledge and
practices among HCW, and commissioning bodies such as the Saudi Central Board for
Accreditation of Healthcare Institutions have updated their definitions and standards for
coronaviruses and acute respiratory syndromes to include COVID‑19.[10] As such,
hospitals in Saudi Arabia were quick to adapt to and prepare for the pandemic before
the first cases appeared in the country.[11]
In the present study, we assessed the anxiety levels and knowledge base of
HCWs in a tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia during the pandemic as compared to its
very beginning in order to determine the degree of preparedness of the healthcare
system to not only to manage patients but also to meet the needs of HCWs, and identify
potential deficiencies that can be improved by focused education and training.
Methods
Data collection
This was the second study for serial cross-sectional surveys among HCWs in
Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was a pilot-validated, selfadministered questionnaire sent online to HCWs that was adapted from our previously
published study.[12] We used multiple professional social media groups and email lists
from our previous surveys during the MERS-CoV outbreak in 2014 and the early phase
of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020.

Data were collected over 2 weeks (April 13–27, 2020). The first part of the survey
addressed respondents’ characteristics (sex, age, etc.) and sources of information used
during the pandemic.
We assessed the following domains for each participant: (1) knowledge
concerning COVID-19; (2) attitudes toward IPC measures; and (3) changes in hygiene
practices. Knowledge on COVID-19 was assessed using 6 questions consisting of true
or false answers, with a score of 0–12 points assigned (Supplementary Table S1). The
degree of change in HCWs’ attitudes was measured using a series of questions on a
Likert-like scale from 1–5 (Supplementary Table S2). Hygiene practices were similarly
measured to assess the degree of behavioral change in HCWs on scale of 1–4
(Supplementary Table S3).
HCW anxiety and preparedness with respect to COVID-19 were evaluated based
on self-reported perceived anxiety over COVID-19 vs MERS-CoV vs seasonal influenza
(11-point Likert scale), along with the level of worry over COVID-19 infection in the
previous 2 weeks. HCWs’ perceptions of their own preparedness as well as that of their
hospital with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic vs the previous MERS-CoV outbreak
were compared using an 11-point Likert scale. Additionally, the availability of a
psychological support system, HCWs’ adherence to seasonal influenza vaccine, and
participation in COVID-19 simulation training, N95 mask fit testing and sources of
anxiety for each HCWs were evaluated. Data collected from HCWs through the online
survey were entered into a secure spreadsheet in SPSS (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).
All data was treated with strict confidentiality, with the anonymity of respondents
maintained throughout the study.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics approaches with mean, median, and standard deviation
were applied to continuous variables, while percentages were used for dichotomous
variables. The 2-sample t test was used to evaluate continuous scores and the Z-test
was used to compare proportions. The multiple response dichotomy analysis was
applied to describe the healthcare workers sources of covid19 Information’s.

A multivariate logistic regression model was used to explore the associations
between the outcome variable the level of anxiety from COVID-19 and demographic
characteristics of HCWs, attitude and hygiene practice scores, and sources of anxiety,
the associations between predictors and the outcome was expressed as Odds Ratio
and 95% Confidence Interval. The SPSS IBM Version21 was used for the data
analysis, the excel program was used for creating figures and depictions, the p-value
statistical significance was considered at 0.050 level. The Institutional Review Board of
King Saud University Medical City approved the study. HCWs gave informed consent
prior to participation.
Results
Of the 1500 HCWs who were contacted, 1453 agreed to participate in the study.
Participants with information missing on more than 50% of the questionnaire were
excluded.
Demographic and sources of information data
Data from the questionnaire were completed by 957 (63.8%) HCWs and were
included in the final analysis. Most respondents were employed at public governmental
tertiary hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; the majority were female (83%) and between
31–40 years of age (52.2%). Nurses constituted 86.3% of the study population. Most
respondents worked in general hospital wards (26.5%), followed by outpatient clinics
(18.8%) and adult emergency rooms (ERs) (14.7%) (Table 1). HCWs obtained
information on COVID-19 from multiple sources (Figure 1).
HCW anxiety and preparedness with respect to COVID-19 during the pandemic
HCWs’ self-reported anxiety levels regarding COVID-19, MERS-CoV, and
seasonal influenza were compared (Figure 2). The highest levels of anxiety were
experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to other viral outbreaks. HCWs
believed that their own preparedness and those of their hospital’s ER or intensive care
unit (ICU) was higher during the COVID-19 pandemic than during the 2012–2015
MERS-CoV outbreaks (Table 2); however, 88% felt more worried about the former.

About 97% of respondents had undergone N95 mask fit testing in 2020 or in the
previous year, but only 58% had attended at least one simulation session related to
managing COVID-19 patients in their hospital’s ICU/ER. About one-quarter of HCWs
worked at hospitals where no psychological support system was available during the
COVID-19 pandemic.
Knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of HCWs with respect to COVID-19
The mean score for HCWs’ knowledge pertaining to COVID-19 was 9.89 out of
12. HCWs’ attitude toward infection control measures were measured on a 5-point
Likert-like scale, with a mean score of 4.42±1.1 (Table 3), which indicated that most
participants agreed or strongly agreed with level of importance of implementing their
hospital’s IPC measures (Supplementary Table S2).
The mean hygiene practice score was 3.8±0.32, representing a moderate-tolarge change in self-rated compliance with hygiene practices and behaviors (e.g., hand
hygiene) (Supplementary Table S3).
Sources of anxiety among HCWs
Sources of perceived anxiety related to COVID-19 in HCWs are shown in Figure
3. Most HCWs (94.6%) were concerned about the risk of acquiring COVID-19 during the
pandemic, while more than half of the group was worried about the depletion of PPE at
their hospital in general or in specifically high-risk departments such as the ICU or ER.
On the other hand, the HCWs described several coping interventions to handle the
stress during the pandemic, as demonstrated in the “word cloud” representation in
Figure 4.
Factors associated with HCWs’ perceived anxiety with respect to COVID-19
Factors contributing to HCWs’ perceived anxiety over COVID-19 during the
pandemic were analyzed using a multivariate logistic regression model (Table 4). The
model was significant overall (f[17,939]=5.98, P<0.001).
Neither sex nor age was correlated with perceived anxiety over COVID-19.
However, the clinical role and work location of the HCW showed positive associations

with perceived anxiety level during the pandemic: resident physicians and nurses had
lower mean perceived anxiety than HCWs in other roles (e.g. consultant or assistant
consultant) (both P<0.010). Additionally, HCWs at general hospitals (including in
COVID-19 wards) and pediatric ER had higher mean perceived anxiety than their
colleagues in other departments (P=0.018 and 0.016, respectively).
Hospital setting and sector were not correlated with mean perceived anxiety of HCWs
during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, HCWs at hospitals equipped with a
psychological support system dedicated to staff during the pandemic reported a lower
mean perceived anxiety than those working in hospitals without such a system
(P=0.001).
HCWs who believed that the medical staff were at higher risk of contracting
COVID-19 and for whom the possibility of shortage of medical supplies and disposable
materials (e.g., ventilator circuits) were a source of anxiety had a significantly higher
mean perceived anxiety level than other HCWs (P=0.015 and 0.010, respectively),
although potential shortages in PPEs or equipment such as ventilators were not a
significant source of anxiety. In addition, the fear of staff shortage during the pandemic
did not significantly affect HCWs’ mean perceived anxiety.
HCWs’ improvement in hygiene practice score was positively and significantly
correlated with mean perceived anxiety over COVID-19 (P<0.001); additionally, their
attitude toward hygiene practices was associated with a significantly higher mean
anxiety (P=0.037)
Additional Bivariate analysis were done and revealed a significantly higher mean
anxiety level over COVID-19 in HCWs at hospitals without support systems than in
those at hospitals where such systems were available (9.02±1.88 vs 8.46±2.37,
P<0.001) consistent with multivariate linear regression analysis. We also found that
HCWs who used social networks as a source of information had a higher mean anxiety
over COVID-19 than those who did not use social media (8.72±2.23 vs 8.39±2.33,
P=0.032) (Table S4).

We compared the results of the present study (Phase II), which was carried out
during the active COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia (April 13–27, 2020), with those of
our previous study (Phase I; February 5–16, 2020), which was conducted by the same
research team immediately before the first case of COVID-19 was reported in Saudi
Arabia.
HCWs’ mean scores of perceived anxiety over COVID-19 increased from
4.91±2.84 to 8.6±2.27 on an 11-point Likert scale (Table 5). The degree of anxiety over
other viral outbreaks, including MERS-CoV and seasonal influenza, similarly increased,
as did concern over contracting COVID-19.
The Knowledge of COVID-19 in the second survey exceeded that measured in
February 2020 (t=33.32, df=1537, p<0.0001 (2-sample t test), which is expected based
on the elapsed time and exposure of the respondents to COVID-19 within that time
frame. Likewise, scores for HCWs’ hygiene practices and attitudes toward hygiene
increased significantly in the current survey compared to those measured in February
(P<0.001).
The proportion of HCWs who received the annual influenza vaccine this year
increased significantly during the pandemic as compared to before (Z=−6.4183,
P<0.0001). The proportion of HCWs who intended to reschedule their annual leave also
increased from 15.3% in February to 45.7% in April 2020 (Z=−12.1816, P<0.001).
Discussion
The participants were predominantly female (83%) and most were nurses
(86.3%), which is comparable to the demographic profile of the previous studies
conducted in early 2020 prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia.[13–16] Most
respondents were between the ages of 31 and 40 years; some studies have shown that
medical staff aged 31–40 years were more worried about becoming infected with severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of
COVID-19) and infecting their families compared to other age groups.[13, 15] A large
proportion of the study participants were from acute care areas (42.42%), which is
similar to other published work.

The current COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by an overabundance
of information that has made it difficult to obtain accurate facts as most individuals rely
on social media for this purpose;[6] this contributes to higher levels of anxiety.[17] Classic
forms of media (i.e., television and newspapers) as well as social media affect the
attitudes of both the public and health professionals, while consulting reliable sources of
information is a basic condition for IPC. Compared to before the COVID 19 pandemic,
hospital announcements were the top source of information used by HCWs during the
pandemic (77.8% vs 86.7%), as was the case for the MERS-CoV outbreak.[12] This
finding highlights the importance of having a dedicated team to provide accurate
information from trusted sources. News on social networks was a source of information
for 61.7% of HCWs before and 66.3% during the pandemic, which may have
contributed to greater anxiety in our study participants as bivariate analysis showed a
higher mean anxiety over COVID-19 found that HCWs who used social networks as a
source of information, although the use of unofficial and nonscientific sources of data
was discouraged in awareness campaigns conducted by hospitals. Use of the Ministry
of Health and World Health Organization websites as a source of information by HCWs
increased from 42.3% to 71.6% and from 50% to 70.8%, respectively, between the 2
surveys.
Healthcare simulation tests have been useful for managing the COVID-19
pandemic. However, there are also practical constraints on running in situ simulations
during a pandemic, such as the need for physical distancing, rigorous sanitization
measures for mannequins and training equipment, and heightened anxiety among
simulation participants; indeed, the fear of acquiring the infection could explain why
41.7% did not attend the simulation tests.[18] In contrast, 97.65% of HCWs underwent
N95 mask fit testing; this high percentage compared to the simulation test may be
explained by the fact that the former was performed individually and therefore elicited
less anxiety in HCWs in terms of the risk of acquiring COVID-19, and that such testing
has been mandated for all HCW.
Surveys are commonly used to identify knowledge gaps and behavioral patterns
in order to implement effective measures for improvement of processes and practices.
We observed that knowledge scores were higher among participants in Phase II (during

the COVID-19 pandemic) than in Phase I (pre-pandemic); the trend is similar to that
observed during the previous MERS-CoV outbreak.[12, 19] Most study participants had a
high level of knowledge concerning SARS-CoV-2 infection and modes of transmission;
this is expected given their profession as healthcare workers. However, previously
published data from a KAP survey in the general population in China during the COVID19 pandemic revealed a high rate of correct responses in the knowledge questionnaire,
which the authors attributed to the high educational level of the participants and the
intensified public health education programs.[20] Other studies have reported variable
findings regarding KAP among HCWs during Ebola and Zika virus outbreaks. For
example, satisfactory knowledge of Ebola virus disease without corresponding good
practices was reported among Nigerian HCWs.[21] This increase in HCWs knowledge
could improve perceptions and positive attitudes that can translate into good practices,
aiding in the prevention and management of infectious diseases. In our previous phase
1 study, the knowledge score was significantly associated with positive attitude and
practice scores: that is, HCWs with a high level of knowledge had more positive
attitudes and perceptions toward preventive measures and engaged to a greater extent
in IPC practices. Others have reported similar associations in KAP surveys of COVID19 and other infectious diseases.[22-24]
The HCWs in our study reported a high level of anxiety with respect to COVID19, with 88% having more anxiety as compared to the previous MERS-CoV outbreak.
Similarly, both local and international studies have found that anxiety levels were high
among HCWs during both pandemics.[25-27] A recent systematic review of 115
publications concluded that all coronavirus outbreaks (SARS, MERS-CoV, and COVID19) had a substantial impact on the physical and mental health of HCWs.[27]
The availability of hospital-based psychological support was associated with
decreased levels of anxiety among HCWs in our survey. Psychological support is critical
for the well-being of frontline HCWs.[28] However, establishing psychological support
services in Hospitals might not be enough to guarantee their efficacy, for instance in the
case where there are obstacles to their access by HCWs who need them.[29] One study
proposed specific measures that healthcare managers should implement to protect the
mental health of healthcare staff: managers must be honest about current and future

situations and have regular meetings to discuss protocols and HCWs’ wellbeing; and
after the crisis has passed, they must actively monitor, support, and—where
necessary—provide treatment to HCWs.[30] In accordance with this issue, the United
Nations issued a policy report on the importance of HCWs’ mental health, and
encouraged all parties to facilitate HCWs’ access to mental health services.[31]
Risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 was the highest source of anxiety
among HCWs in our study, followed by depletion of PPE at their hospital in general or
more specifically in the ICU/ER departments. These findings are similar to those of a
study of 69 HCWs who participated in multiple listening sessions. There were 7 sources
of anxiety, ranging from fear of not having enough equipment and of contracting
COVID-19 or transmitting it to their loved ones, to fear of not performing well when they
were needed in areas beyond their expertise.[32] Such anxiety could affect the
confidence of HCWs in themselves as well as general trust in the healthcare system. In
China, HCWs who were interviewed reported that they did not require psychological
help but needed enough protective supplies and more uninterrupted rest time.[29]
Another study examining factors related to HCWs’ psychological difficulties found that
infection of colleagues and family members, protective measures, and medical violence
were among the main concerns of HCWs in areas affected by COVID-19.[33-34]
This study had some limitations. Recall bias may have affected some
participants’ responses, and most participants were nurses and females. Another issue
is that many HCWs in our cohort had experienced the previous MERS-CoV epidemic;
therefore, additional research in other settings are needed in order to determine
whether our findings are generalizable.
Conclusion
HCWs’ anxiety levels over COVID-19 increased after the pandemic was
declared. Healthcare facilities need to provide more emotional and psychological
support for all HCWs, including psychological first aid delivered through webinars to
each unit on topics such as dealing with anxiety and insomnia, peer support, practicing
self-care, and support for moral distress; as well as providing individual support
sessions.
