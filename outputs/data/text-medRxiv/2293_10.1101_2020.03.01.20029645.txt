Abstract
The fourth outbreak of the Coronaviruses, known as the COVID-19, has occurred in Wuhan city of Hubei province in China in December 2019. We propose
a time-varying sparse vector autoregressive (VAR) model to retrospectively analyze
and visualize the dynamic transmission routes of this outbreak in mainland China
over January 31 ‚Äì February 19, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the influential
inter-location routes from Hubei have become unidentifiable since February 4, 2020,
whereas the self-transmission in each provincial-level administrative region (location,
hereafter) was accelerating over February 4‚Äì15, 2020. From February 16, 2020, all
routes became less detectable, and no influential transmissions could be identified on
February 18 and 19, 2020. Such evidence supports the effectiveness of government
interventions, including the travel restrictions in Hubei. Implications of our results
suggest that in addition to the origin of the outbreak, virus preventions are of crucial
importance in locations with the largest migrant workers percentages (e.g., Jiangxi,
Henan and Anhui) to controlling the spread of COVID-19.

Introduction

Coronaviruses are single-stranded, enveloped and positive-sense RNA viruses, which are
spherical in shape and have petal-like spines [1]. Firstly discovered and identified in 1965
[2], coronaviruses have not caused large-scale outbreaks until the 2003 SARS epidemic
in China, followed by 2012 MERS in Saudi Arabia and 2015 MERS in South Korea [3].
Although the exact origin remains debatable [4], the fourth outbreak has taken place in
Hubei province of China in December 2019 and rapidly spread out nationally [5‚Äì10]. On
January 10, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) temporarily named the new
coronavirus as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Around one month later, the
WHO officially renamed it to coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 on 11 February, 2020
(see https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/
20200211-sitrep-22-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=fb6d49b1_2 for details) and released a comprehensive interim guidance on dealing with this new virus for all countries [11]. On March
11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic [12]. Since China reported its
first cases to the WHO in December 2019, COVID-19 has been spreading rapidly around
the world. As of June 15, 2020, about 7.9 million confirmed cases and 433 thousand deaths
have been reported by authorities in 214 countries and territories [13].
To combat against the rapid spread of the COVID-19, since mid-January 2020, the
central government of China and all local governments have implemented intensive preventions. Examples include tracing close contacts and quarantining infected cases, promoting
social consensus on self-protection like wearing face mask in public area, among others [14].
With the unexpectedly rapidly growing number of confirmed cases, more extreme and unprecedented measures have taken places. On 23 January, 2020, the Chinese authorities
introduced travel restrictions on five cities (Wuhan, Huanggang, Ezhou, Chibi and Zhijiang) of Hubei, shutting down the movement of more than 40 million people [15].
Among existing research, most argues that those interventions have effectively halted the
spread of the COVID-19 [15‚Äì25].
The feasibilities of aforementioned stringent measures adopted by the Chinese government have been widely discussed, and existing studies have preliminarily examined the
effectiveness of these local containment measures (e.g., the lockdown of Wuhan [26‚Äì28],

airport screening and travel restrictions [19, 29‚Äì31], and isolation of cases and quarantine
of contacts [32, 33]). Moreover, different types of infection control measures are enforced in
many other countries to prevent and constrain the spread of the COVID-19, and the effects
of these measures have been analyzed and compared over a rage of affected countries (e.g.,
Australia [34], Germany [35], Italy [36, 37] and South Korea [38]). Among those emerging
large volume of studies, mathematical and statistical modeling plays a non-negligible role.
Also, the classical susceptible exposed infectious recovered (SEIR) model with its various
extensions is the most popular method [39‚Äì52]. SEIR family models are effective in exploring the epidemic characteristics of the outbreak, forecasting the inflection point and
ending time, and deciding the measures to curb the spreading. Despite this, they are less
appropriate in identifying transmission routes of the COVID-19 outbreak, which is also not
thoroughly investigated in existing literature.
In this paper, we fill in this gap and perform a retrospective analysis using the publicly
available data [53]. Rather than employing the SEIR, we develop a time-varying coefficient
sparse vector autoregressive (VAR) model. Using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) [54, 55] and the local constant kernel smoothing estimator [56], our
model is capable of estimating the dynamic high-dimensional Granger causality coefficient
matrices. This enables the detection and visualization of time-varying inter-location and
self-transmission routes of the COVID-19 on the daily basis. The resulting ‚Äúroad-map‚Äù
can help policy-markers and public-health officers retrospectively evaluate both the effectiveness and unexpected outcomes of their interventions. Such an evaluation is critical to
winning the current battle against COVID-19 in China, providing useful experience for
other countries facing the emerging threat of this new coronavirus, and saving lives when
a new epidemic occurs in the future.

Methods

2.1

Model

Throughout this study, we are interested in the growth rate yi,t such that:
yi,t+1 = ln(xi,t+1 ) ‚àí ln(xi,t ),

(1)

where xi,t is the accumulated confirmed cases in the provincial-level administrative region
(location, hereafter) i on day t (i = 1, . . . , N and t = 1, . . . , T ). T and N define the
number of days and number of locations under consideration, respectively. We then define
yt = (y1,t , . . . , yN,t )0 , an N √ó 1 vector of the growth rate on day t. To investigate a
dynamic direct transmission of the growth rate among locations, we propose a time-varying
coefficient sparse VAR model, namely the tvSVAR model, which assumes that Granger
causality coefficients are functions of time, such that:
yt+1 = Œ±t + Bt yt + t ,

(2)

where Œ±t is an N -dimensional intercept vector at time t. Bt is an N √ó N Granger causality
matrix at time t with a dynamic sparse structure, for which entries can be exactly zero
and the locations of zeros can vary with time. t is an N √ó 1 vector of error terms. The
sparsity of Bt is assumed because N could be even larger than T in our case, which leads
to very unstable estimations and problematic interpretations of Bt .
One important benefit of using the proposed tvSVAR to model the transmissions is that
the Granger causality matrix, Bt , can provide both the direction and strength of the route
on day t. For example, the ij th entry in Bt measures the strength of the transmission from
location i to location j on day t. The ith diagonal of Bt represents the self-transmission in
location i that captures the relationship between the growth rate in the current and previous
days. More critically, the sparse structure eases the interpretation of Bt because many weak
transmissions may be of a random nature. The corresponding coefficients, therefore, can
be treated as noises and are shrunk to zeros exactly. Moreover, a time-varying design of
Bt allows us to investigate changes in the identified transmissions over time. For instance,

let 11, 14 and 17 indicate Hubei, Jiangxi and Shanghai, respectively. On day t = 1, the
estimated Œ≤11,14,1 and Œ≤14,17,1 are 0.52 and 0.35, respectively. This suggests on that day,
moderately strong transmission routes of confirmed COVID-19 cases are detected from
Huber to Jiangxi and from Jiangxi to Shanghai, respectively. Further, estimated Œ≤17,i,1 for
all i = 1, ..., 20 are zeros, suggesting that the confirmed cases in Shanghai cannot spread to
other locations on day 1. On day t = 2, we observe estimated Œ≤11,14,1 = 0.61, Œ≤14,17,1 = 0.41
and all Œ≤17,i,1 = 0. Thus, the two detected routes from Huber to Jiangxi and Jiangxi
to Shanghai have become more influential, whereas the cases in Shanghai are still yet to
spread out on day 2. The above results cannot be derived using the classic epidemiological
SEIR model.
To capture both dynamic and sparse structure of the Granger causality coefficients, we
solve the following optimization problem:

We use the Epanechnikov kernel K(x) = 0.75(1 ‚àí x2 )+ and a

unified bandwidth for each i (bi ‚â° b) to avoid a large number of tuning parameters. The
coefficients Œ≤i,j,t denotes the ij th entry of the Granger causality matrix Bt , and Œª is the
tuning parameter that aims to shrink insignificant Œ≤i,j,t to zero and thus controls the sparsity
of Bt . Another essential feature of our proposed model is that the adaptive weights wi,j,t
are employed to penalize Œ≤i,j,t differently in the lasso (L1) penalty [54, 55]. The choice
of weights wi,j,t takes account of the prior knowledge about the transmissions and can be
specified by the users. In this study, we consider wi,j,t as the reciprocal of the accumulated
confirmed in location i on day t ‚àí 1. That is, the growth rate of a location with a smaller
accumulated confirmed cases is less likely to influence the growth rates of others, and thus,
more likely to be shrunk to zero. The final sparsity structure of Bt is still data-driven.
The estimators as in (3) can also be viewed as a penalized version of local constant

Given a bandwidth b and a penalty parameter Œª, we can find the estimator (Œ±

depends on the chosen criterion. Among the existing literature, a popular approach is to
adopt the cross-validation strategy, such that based on the estimated (Œ±t , Bt ), the model
will not ‚Äòoverfit‚Äô yt . As for the time-series analysis, we use an expanding-window sample
to implement the cross-validation [58]. This requires that the chosen b will minimize the
cross-validated forecast error, which is measured by the one-step-ahead root mean squared
forecast error (RMSFE), such that

is analogous to the square root of the popular least squared errors. An interpretation is that
the chosen b will lead to the minimized total out-of-sample forecast errors of the growth
rates of confirmed cases over the last third of the sample period.

tional Health Commission of the People‚Äôs Republic of China [53]. The data-coverage ranges
from January 29, 2020 to February 19, 2020, during which no missing data were recorded
at location-level. The accumulated cases and the associated growth rates, grouped by the
total national number, cases in Hubei and cases in all other locations, are plotted in Figure
1 (a) and (b), respectively. The total national (Hubei) accumulated confirmed cases increased rapidly from 7,736 (4,586) on January 31, 2020 to 75,101 (62,457) on February 19,
2020. Note that on February 12, 2020, confirmed cases in Hubei included those confirmed
by both laboratory and clinical diagnosis, leading to a one-time hump of the accumulated
number. Compared to those of Hubei, confirmed cases of other locations took up a smaller
proportion of the total national number, ranging from 40.7% on January 29, 2020 to 16.8%
on February 19, 2020. This suggests that the growth rate of other locations should be lower
than that of Hubei, which is consistent with Figure 1 (b). Throughout our investigation
period, except for the one-time hump on February 12, 2020, growth rates of Hubei and the
rest steadily declined, from 33% and 25% to 5% and 1%, respectively.

Estimation results: Transmission routes

By taking the difference of the logged accumulated cases and applying one lag, our estimated transmission routes are available from January 31 to February 19, 2020 (two observations are lost). To avoid potential noises caused by small numbers, we only include data
of locations, which had at least 150 accumulated confirmed cases as of February 19, 2020.
Altogether, our modeled sample contains 20 location-level confirmed cases. We firstly test
the stationarity of the 20 growth rates separately. Based on the Augmented Dickey‚ÄìFuller
test, only the rates of 3 locations (Beijing, Hainan and Heilongjiang) are insignificant, which
is in-line with the employed 10% significance level. The detailed results are available upon
request. The model explained in Section 2 is then fitted incorporating all the 20 growth
rates. A non-zero estimate of Œ≤i,j,t , the ij th entry of Bt in (2), indicates that on the tth
day, the growth rate of location j is Granger caused by that of location i. In other words,
there is a transmission route from location i to location j. Among the 20-day results, we
noticed that the estimated transmission routes on days 1‚Äì5 changed considerably on daily
basis. From the sixth day onwards, however, those estimated routes were more steady.

Hence, we plot the estimates on days 1‚Äì5 and those on the every fifth day thereafter, on
Figure 2. Be noted that estimates smaller than 0.2 (none-influential) are not presented
a better visual illustration purpose. Also, this research focuses on the analysis of mainland China only, which excludes Taiwan, Macau, Hong Kong and all important islands of
China‚Äôs territory, such as those located in the South China Sea. The plots presented in
Figure 2 therefore do not present a complete map of the territory of China, nor should they
be used for purposes other than displaying identified transmission routes of COVID-19 in
mainland China. The readers are directed to The National Administration of Surveying,
Mapping and Geographic Information of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, should they need
to precisely explore the scope of maps, national boundaries and the drawing of important
islands of the Chinese territory.
In Figure 2, we use color of light orange (small) to dark red (large) indicating the
accumulated confirmed cases in each location, up to time t. Estimated transmission routes
are colored in blue. Self-transmissions (indicated by Œ≤i,i,t ) are denoted by dots, and a larger
size of dot suggests a larger estimated Œ≤i,i,t . Inter-location transmission (indicated by Œ≤i,j,t ,
where i 6= j) is represented by arrows, with the transparency indicating the magnitude of
estimated Œ≤i,j,t . On the first day (January 31, 2020), there were influential inter-location
transmissions from Hubei to Jiangxi, Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu
and Shaanxi, sorted by the magnitudes of strength (big to small). There were a few
additional detected such transmissions on the second day, including those from Hubei to
Guangxi, from Jiangxi to Fujian, and from Guangdong to Anhui, Yunnan and Hunan. The
number of such identified inter-location routes, however, reduced rapidly over the next three
days. On the fifth day (February 4, 2020), no influential transmission routes were found
from Hubei to directly affect other locations, and there were only three influential routes
identified nationally, including Zhejiang‚ÄìShaanxi, Zhejiang‚ÄìJiangxi and Jiangxi‚ÄìShanghai.
The number of those detected inter-location routes declined again in the next few days, and
on day 13, only Henan‚ÄìHeilongjiang was found influential. On days 19 and 20 (February 18
and 19, 2020), there were no influential inter-location transmissions identified. The above
findings suggest that the number of influential inter-location transmissions overall dropped
quickly in the first five days and then reduced steadily for the rest fifteen days. This is

consistent with the observations of Figure 3 (a), where the time-varying estimates of the
Granger causality of Hubei on other locations are plotted. On each day, we report the
mean, standard deviation (Std. Dev.), the 25% quantile (Q1 ) and 75% quantile (Q3 ) of
those estimates in Table 1, which also leads to consistent findings.
As for the self-transmission, we firstly examine Figure 2 (b). It can bee seen that there
were quite a few detected influential self-transmissions on the first two days. However,
this number dropped quickly over days 3‚Äì5, and only self-transmissions of Heilongjiang,
Guangdong and Zhejiang were found influential on day 5. Since then, the number of
influential self-transmissions increased quickly with growing magnitudes (influence). On
the sixteenth day (February 15, 2020), 16 out of the 20 examined locations had an estimated
Œ≤i,i,20 of at least 0.2. Those large self-transmissions, however, disappeared rapidly again
in the next three days. On February 18 and 19, 2020, there were no influential selftransmissions identified. This is consistent with our findings on Figure 3 (b), where timevarying estimated Œ≤i,i,t are plotted for each location. We report daily descriptive statistics
of those estimates in Table 1, which also results in consistent conclusions.

Discussions

Since 23 January, 2020, many cities on mainland China started to introduce travel restrictions, including five cities (Wuhan, Huanggang, Ezhou, Chibi and Zhijiang) of Hubei [15].
According to WHO‚Äôs situation report [59], the average incubation period of COVID-19 is up
to 10 days. Thus, our estimated dynamic transmission routes supports the significant effectiveness of the interventions taken by the Chinese authorities [15‚Äì25]. This is evidenced by
Figure 2 (a)‚Äì(e), where the number of influential inter-location transmissions from Hubei
to other locations reduced very quickly. Compared to multiple influential routes originating
in Hubei detected on the first two days (January 31 and February 1, 2020), by February 4,
2020 (around 10 days after the travel restrictions), there were already no such transmissions
identified. On the other hand, from February 5 to 16, 2020, Table 1 suggests that the averaged magnitudes of self-transmission on each day were strengthening steadily. This may
also be explained by the interventions, which have effectively blocked inter-location transmissions, such that the growth rate of each location could only be caused by its internal

transmissions.
We now focus on the inter-location transmission routes. Since influential routes from
Hubei were no longer detected since day 5, we calculate the average Œ≤i,j,t of the 19 locations
affected by Hubei over the first four days (January 31 ‚Äì February 3, 2020). The top five
destinations are presented in Panel A of Table 2. Apart from its geographic neighbors
Jiangxi and Henan, Hubei has lead to influential routes to Heilongjiang, Zhejiang and
Shandong directly. This may be explained by the substantial floating population working
and living in Hubei from those locations. Excluding routes originating in Hubei, the Panel
B of Table 2 suggests that the top destinations of transmission routes have not changed
much over the first four days and the rest sixteen days. Despite minor differences in ranking,
Shaanxi, Heilongjiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, Henan and Jiangsu appear to be the destinations
suffered most from inter-location transmissions from origins other than Hubei. Similarly,
the top five sources (excluding Hubei) of those transmissions are basically identical over the
days 1‚Äì4 and days 5‚Äì20, as shown in Panel C of Table 2. This is consistent with the fact
that travel restrictions in Hubei should not affect the connections among other locations. In
all cases, Jiangxi, Henan, Guangdong, Zhejiang and Anhui are the most influential origins
other than Hubei.
It is worth noting that Jiangxi, Henan and Anhui belong to both the top origins and
destinations of the inter-location transmissions, excluding Hubei. Since the impact of Hubei
is not considered, this cannot be explained by the two influential transmission routes of
Hubei‚ÄìJiangxi and Hubei‚ÄìHenan listed in Panel A of Table 2. To see this, over days 5‚Äì20,
the transmissions out of Hubei are no longer significant and thus should not affect routes
from Jiangxi and Henan to another location. In contrast, one explanation is the large
migrant workers from Jiangxi, Henan and Anhui to other locations (excluding Hubei).
According to the Report on China‚Äôs migrant population development of 2017 [60], Jiangxi
(7.25%), Henan (6.30%) and Anhui (6.27%) are among the top five locations in mainland
China, ranked by the percentages of migrant workers in 2017.

Conclusions

Coronaviruses have lead to three major outbreaks ever since the SARS occurred in 2003.
Although the exact origin is still debatable, the current shock, namely COVID-19, has taken
place in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province in mainland China. As the fourth largescale outbreak of coronaviruses, COVID-19 is spreading quickly to all provincial-level administrative regions (locations, hereafter) in China and has recently become a world-wide
epidemic. As a significant complement to existing research, this study employs a tvSVAR
model and retrospectively investigates and visualizes the transmission routes in mainland
China.
Demonstrated in Figure 2, our baseline results review both the dynamic inter-location
and self-transmission routes. Since February 4, 2020, the spread out of Hubei was largely
reduced, leading to no identifiable routes to other locations. Simultaneously, the selftransmissions started to accelerate and peaked on around February 15, 2020 for most
locations. Given an average incubation period of 10 days, those results support the argued
effectiveness of the travel restrictions to control the spread of COVID-19, which took place
in multiple cities of Hubei on January 23, 2020. On February 18‚Äì19, 2020, there existed no
influential inter-location or self-transmission routes. Thus, the growth rates of confirmed
cases are of a more random nature in all locations thereafter, implying that the spread
of COVID-19 has been under control. For the detected inter-location transmissions, our
findings demonstrate that Jiangxi, Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, Henan and Shandong are the
top 5 locations affected mostly via routes directly from Hubei. When the influence of Hubei
is excluded, Jiangxi, Henan and Anhui are among both the top origins and destinations of
transmission routes.
Our results have major practical implications for public health decision- and policymakers. For one thing, the implemented timely ad-hoc public health interventions are
proven effective, including contact tracing, quarantine and travel restrictions. For another,
apart from the origin of the virus, as locations with largest migrant workers percentages,
virus preventions are also of crucial importance in Jiangxi, Henan and Anhui to controlling
the epidemics like the outbreak of COVID-19 in the future. With limited resources, taking
ad-hoc interventions in such locations may most effectively help stop the spread of a new
