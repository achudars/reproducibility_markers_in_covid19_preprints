Wastewater-based epidemiology could be applied to track down SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks at high spatio-temporal
resolution and could potentially be used as an early-warning for emergence of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the
general population. Epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 could play a role in monitoring the spread of the
virus in the population and controlling possible outbreaks. However, sensitive sample preparation and detection
methods are necessary to detect trace levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in influent wastewater (IWW).

Unlike predecessors, method development of a SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration and detection procedure was
performed with IWW samples with high viral SARS-CoV-2 loads (in combination with seeding IWW with a
surrogate coronavirus). This is of importance since the SARS-CoV-2 genome in IWW might have already been

Lowering pore sizes did not improve our limit of detection and quantification. Realtime polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was employed for the amplification of the N1, N2, N3 and E_Sarbecogene.

This is one of the first studies to apply digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2
RNA in IWW. Interestingly, qPCR results were comparable with dPCR results suggesting that qPCR is a valid
method. In this study, dPCR was also used as a proxy to assess the precision of qPCR. In this light, dPCR showed
high variability at low concentration levels (100 copies/µL), indicating that variability in bioanalytical assays for
SARS-CoV-2 RNA might be substantial.

On average, the N2-gene showed high in-sample stability in IWW for 10 days of storage at 4 °C. Between-sample
variability was substantial due to the low native concentrations in IWW. Additionally, the E-gene proved to be
less stable compared to the N2-gene and showed higher variability. Freezing the IWW samples resulted in a 10fold decay of loads of the N2- and E-gene in IWW.

Although WBE can already aid in filling some knowledge gaps in the epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2,
future WBE studies should aim to further validate and standardize bioanalytical assays, especially with regards
to methodological limitations.

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped non-segmented positivesense RNA virus, which is associated with the pathogenesis of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in
humans [1]. Due to the partly asymptomatic transmission and the high infectivity of this virus [2,3], it is crucial
to have timely and accurate figures on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in defined population groups for controlling
possible viral outbreaks. Currently, the extent of SARS-CoV-2 circulation has been monitored by diagnostic testing
of primarily symptomatic patients and contact tracing to also isolate asymptomatic patients [4,5]. However, a
major limitation with these methods is that they depend on participation of individuals, even when they have no
symptoms or only mild aspecific symptoms of COVID-19. Lack of recognition of symptoms or refusal to participate
in detection or quarantine measures allows further spread of the virus in the general population. In Belgium,
contact-tracing is primarily done manually through regional call centers and through the implementation of a
smartphone application. Participation is heavily influenced by personal, social and public trust and requires
additional efforts to connect with lower educated and vulnerable population groups [4]. Contact-tracing efforts
could potentially be biased by reporting and concealment bias and requires from each individual to keep track
of their contact list. Additionally, if contact-tracers fail to track down an individual’s contacts swiftly (for example
due to the prolonged incubation period or time to perform diagnostic testing), it could have limited effect on the
spread of this highly infectious virus [6].

Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) employs the analysis of influent wastewater (IWW) on human
(metabolic) excretion products and has been used as an alternative approach to investigate the circulation and
spread of infectious diseases at the population level (Figure 1) [7,8]. Infectious disease biomarkers (e.g. viral
genomes) are released, pooled and transported in the wastewater system. The abundance of pathogens in IWW
reflects the pattern and spread of infection at the population level and does not depend on participation at the
individual level [9]. For this reason, WBE is an efficient alternative approach for the prevention of infectious
disease outbreaks, to track down possible hotspots and to evaluate the effectiveness of large scale anticontagion
interventions within different communities [10]. In order for WBE to monitor infectious diseases, the
corresponding pathogen should preferentially be causing an enteric infection. Alternatively the pathogen or its
genome should be excreted at sufficient levels in the faeces, urine or other excretions that end up in the
wastewater [10–12]. In this light, several research papers indicated the potential of WBE in surveilling the
transmission of the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 at the population level [13–15].

Thanks to some advantages of this epidemiologic approach, WBE could aid in filling some knowledge gaps.
Asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 also shed the virus via their stool in the sewers [11,16]
enabling WBE to track down the extent of transmission of the virus in different catchments and to predict future
disease outbreaks in communities. Additionally, WBE could potentially be used as an early-warning for
emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the general population [17–19]. WBE is especially useful to invigilate new outbreaks
as it is highly inefficient to test thousands of individuals when detection rates are low. In this light, it is crucial to
have sensitive and robust bioanalytical methods to quantitively measure SARS-CoV-2 in IWW.

The surveillance of wastewater on viral RNA loads of SARS-CoV-2 proposes some analytical challenges. These
primarily include the low detection levels of the virus in IWW and the wastewater matrix potentially harboring a
wide array of organic matter, humic acids and heavy metals that could interfere with the molecular methods of
assaying viruses. Therefore, it is crucial to have reproducible concentration methods and sensitive instrumental
techniques to accurately measure viruses in IWW [9]. At this moment, there has been a broad range of
concentration methods for the extraction of viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 in IWW. Pre-existing concentration
methods for SARS-CoV-2 RNA primarily include ultracentrifugation, ultrafiltration, charged filter membranes or
PEG precipitation [20]. Nevertheless, most of these methods assess efficiency of recovery (RE) by spiking nonenveloped human enteric viruses to IWW [21–23]. Only a limited number of papers on method development and
optimization investigate RE through spiking of enveloped viruses (e.g. coronavirus, the murine hepatitis virus and
the bacteriophage pseudomonas virus phi6) [24]. However, even with enteric viruses, recoveries with
concentrations methods are mostly determined by the virus and the matrix composition. In this light,
coronaviruses (CoV) have quite distinctive structural and physical properties compared to other enteric viruses
[25]. Furthermore, it is not exactly known in what complex the SARS-CoV-2 RNA is present in faeces (virus
particles, cellular fragments…) and viral loads may be broken down in smaller fragments during in-sewer
transport. Therefore such spiking experiments with viruses, although useful, are probably not fully representative
for evaluation of stability and extraction of real IWW.

The aim of this study was to compare different bioanalytical procedures for the concentration of SARS-CoV-2
RNA in IWW. This bioanalytical assay was optimized with IWW originating from 8 Belgian wastewater treatment
plants (WWTPs) with confirmed native levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, in combination with spiking with an animal
Coronavirus. Additionally, in-sample stability at different storage conditions was further investigated. Finally, this
study applied, as one of the first, digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) for assaying SARS-CoV-2 RNA in IWW,
in a direct comparison with traditional qPCR.

Method development was done with IWW samples acquired from eight different Belgian WWTPs with
population equivalents ranging between 25,000 to 200,000 inhabitants and sanitary wastewater (SAW) from a
company that had a high number of positive COVID-19 cases (approximately 17% of the employers) [28]. Daily
IWW samples were collected in the preamble (2nd of August), peak (20th of November) and tail (20th of January)
of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Locations are not further specified due to anonymity constraints,
however, matrix compositions differ substantially between the locations of interest to demonstrate the
robustness of the methodology. It should be noted that in-sewer degradation in the SAW is most likely less
substantial compared to the IWW samples because of minor average residence times.

Daily 24-h composite IWW samples were collected time- or flow proportionally in order to obtain samples that
were representative for an entire day. For time-proportional sampling, 10-minute intervals were applied to
compile daily samples to accurately capture viral RNA loads over the 24-h period [29]. Average residence time
was less than 12 hours in all locations. After sample collection, samples were transported immediately at 4 °C to
the laboratory and analyzed within 24 hours.

Virus concentration is necessary because of the low levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater. The analytical
procedure needs to be sensitive enough to detect viral loads in the beginning or at the tail of the COVID-19 peak
when only a limited number of SARS-CoV-2 infections are present in the catchment area. Several ultrafiltration
methods (for protocols, see figures S1-S3) with different centrifugal devices with varying molecular weight cutoffs (MWCO) and loading volumes were tested for the concentration of viral RNA loads in IWW in order to obtain
high extraction efficiencies. Additionally, PEG precipitation was also tested as an alternative for sample
concentration. It should be noted that co-concentration of PCR inhibitors could also occur when using these
concentration methods which could affect the assay’s sensitivity [23]. The composition of the IWW matrix is
highly variable and contains a range of heavy metals, RNases and polysaccharides that could interfere with qPCR
amplification.

It should be noted that RE was not determined by spiking the IWW samples pre- and post-extraction with an
enveloped enteric control virus. In this study, an alternative approach was proposed in which IWW with
substantial loads of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was tested with different sample concentration methods. The protocol with
the lowest and most reproducible cycle threshold (Ct) levels for the amplification of the different SARS-CoV-2
genes was chosen for sample concentration. This approach was chosen since spiking IWW with enteric enveloped

viruses may not be representative for RE of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in IWW due to different structural properties of
these surrogate viruses or the in-sewer degradation of viral SARS-CoV-2 genome. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2
genome could also be present in a different form (e.g. cell debris) in the sewer system. However, during method
development, IWW samples were spiked in parallel with PRCV to investigate whether the Ct-values for the
amplification of the PRCV_1-gene were in line with the SARS-CoV-2 results when optimizing the different
extraction protocols. Table 2 summarizes the design of experiment with the varying extraction protocols in order
to obtain the most suitable sample concentration method of viral RNA loads in the wastewater matrix.

In the final protocol, samples were firstly centrifuged at 4625g for 30 minutes at 4 °C to remove solids and debris.
The supernatans was transferred to a Centricon Plus-70 centrifugal filter for sample concentration. The sample
was centrifuged for 15 minutes at 2500g at 4 °C in these centrifugal devices. Subsequently, the filter cup was
centrifuged for an additional 2 minutes at 1000g at 4 °C to collect the sample concentrate. Finally, the sample
concentrate was extracted and standardized at a volume of 1.5 mL.

Similar to the sample concentration protocols, different commercially available manual RNA extraction kits were
compared in order to obtain the lowest and most reproducible Ct-values for both SARS-CoV-2 and PRCV. Initially,
a selection of IWW samples was processed with three manual RNA extraction kits (i.e. Viral RNA, RNeasy and
Powermicrobiome). These RNA extraction kits need to be capable of isolating trace levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
from IWW. The RE depends heavily on the composition of the RNA extraction kit. The number of washing steps
to remove PCR inhibitors may vary between the kits and different elution solvents are used for the extraction of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA from the concentrate. These commercialized kits have been proposed in other WBE applications
for the extraction of SARS-CoV-2 in IWW [21].

192
193
194
195

For each RNA extraction kit, each sample concentration method was considered. The Ct-values obtained with
the automated Maxwell PureFood GMO and Authentication RNA extraction kit were compared with the results
from the manual RNA extraction kits to investigate whether it was possible to increase the throughput of the
bioanalytical assay.

In the final method, extraction was performed with the automated Maxwell PureFood GMO and Authentication
RNA extraction kit. 200 µL of the concentrate was added to 200 µL cetylrimethylammonium bromide buffer and
40 µL proteinase K and the total volume was incubated for 10 minutes at 56 °C. This mixture was transferred to
the sample well together with 300 µL lysis buffer. The final elution volume with this RNA extraction kit was 50
µL.

All qPCR amplifications were performed in 20 µL reaction mixtures using a 2x SensiFAST™ Probe No-ROX OneStep kit for further purification from PCR-inhibitors after RNA extraction. Each reaction mixture contained 20%
v/v of the extracted RNA. The final concentration of the primer and probes in the different qPCR mixtures was
given in Table 1. A six-point calibration curve with a concentration between 105 and 100 copies/µL was
constructed in ultrapure DEPC-treated water for quantification of the different genes of interest (Table 1) in
IWW. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was defined as the concentration in the lowest point of the
calibration curve and was 100 copies/µL for all genes. All qPCR reactions were performed in duplicate. For each
qPCR run, two negative controls and a positive control were included. qPCR settings were as follows: 10 minutes

In low-concentration IWW samples, qPCR could potentially be affected by sample inhibitors, poor amplification
efficiency, less precision and the need for relative quantification, which might lead to the occurrence of false
negative results. Therefore, dPCR was tested for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in IWW because of the higher
precision, tolerance to PCR inhibitors and reproducibility compared to qPCR. dPCR could potentially be useful
because of the low sensitivity to PCR inhibitors that are highly present in IWW and possibly co-concentrated
during sample preparation. For this reason, this molecular assay could potentially be more sensitive for the
detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in IWW. Another advantage of dPCR is that absolute quantification is performed
(through Poisson calculations). The same standard curve was injected with dPCR for all genes of interest to
investigate precision with dPCR at different concentration levels as a proxy for validation of the quantitative
results. For each dPCR run a non-template control was included to determine the signal to noise (S/N) threshold.

2.6. Stability experiments

228

During transport in the sewer system, it is possible that the SARS-CoV-2 genome is broken down in smaller RNA
fragments containing the SARS-CoV-2 genes. Therefore, in-sample stability was not investigated through
standard addition with SARS-CoV-2 since stability of the corresponding gene fragments might not be comparable
with the fragments found in IWW. This study only considered in-sample stability and in-sewer stability should be
further investigated as medium to low stability could substantially influence the concentrations of SARS-CoV-2
RNA in the sewer system.

IWW samples from the eight different locations with substantial viral RNA loads were divided in multiple aliquots
of 50 mL and stored at different temperatures (4 °C and -20 °C). These aliquots were subsequently analyzed at
different time points for all genes of interest, as illustrated by Figure 2. Important to note is that all aliquots
stored at -20 °C were only thawed once at the moment of analysis. The effect of multiple freeze-thaw cycles was
not considered in this study. However, it has to be mentioned that multiple freeze-thaw cycles could lead to
extensive breakdown of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RNases present in IWW.

237
238
239
240

For each IWW sample, viral loads for each gene were quantified at each time point and expressed as a relative
percentage of the native concentration present in the corresponding IWW samples at the starting point of this
stability study. The mean and relative standard deviation (%RSD) of all IWW samples were considered for each
gene of interest.

Figures S1 summarizes the results of the different sample concentration methods for each RNA extraction kit.
For this initial comparison, a fresh IWW sample (stored at 4 °C) from location 2 from the 2nd of August 2020 was
divided in different aliquots which were analyzed with different sample concentration methods for SARS-CoV-2
and seeded PRCV. At this time, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 was on the rise in this specific
location, but was still considerably lower compared to the second wave of the pandemic. The Centricon Plus-70
centrifugal filters resulted in the highest yields of PRCV and SARS-CoV-2 for all genes of interest. While PEG
precipitation resulted in detection levels of SARS-CoV-2 above the LLOQ for the E-gene, yields for the N1 and N2
gene were generally low or these genes remained undetected. This was in line with previous studies that
reported poor recoveries of SARS-CoV-2 with PEG precipitation, possibly due to the co-concentration of PCRinhibitors because of the small MWCO with this concentration method [21]. Ct-values measured with the other
centrifugal methods were also low, as presented in Figure S4. However, yields of PRCV were considerably higher
with the ultracentrifugation methods compared to the PEG precipitation. For this reason, PEG precipitation was
excluded from further method optimization. The N3-gene resulted in poor detection levels with both RNA
extraction kits and across all sample concentration methods. For this reason, further amplification of SARS-CoV2 genes in IWW mainly focused on the N1-, N2- and E-gene.

The effect of different pore sizes and different loading volumes was tested with the different ultracentrifugation
methods in order to obtain the highest and most reproducible RE for SARS-CoV-2. SAW from a company with
high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections was used for the optimization of the method, as illustrated by Figure
3A. Overall, increasing the sample volume resulted in the lowest Ct-values for the genes of interest with the
different sample concentration methods. However, higher loading volumes (i.e. two times the maximum capacity
of the filter) often resulted in blockage of the centrifugal filter membrane and, therefore, the IWW sample was
only loaded once to prevent this. Blockage of the filter could also potentially lead to higher concentrations of
PCR-inhibitors which could negatively influence the sensitivity with qPCR. The use of lower sample volumes also
increases the throughput of the bioanalytical assay, since higher loading volumes require multiple centrifugation
steps. Lower pore sizes did also not result in more sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2; only the Amicon centrifugal
filters with a MWCO of 10 kDa showed minor improvements. While sample concentration might be better with
smaller pore sizes, decreasing the MWCO could also potentially lead to co-concentration of PCR-inhibitors. For
this reason, MWCO ranging between 50 and 100 kDa were used for sample concentration. Concentration with
the Centricon Plus-70 centrifugal filters resulted in the lowest Ct-values; the other centrifugal filters were
comparable. Other studies also found acceptable RE of surrogate viruses or seeded SARS-CoV-2 in IWW with
some of these ultracentrifugation methods. Loading volumes ranged between 50 and 500 mL in these studies.
However, the variation of the RE with these sample concentration methods was quite substantial [21,23].

Structural properties of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA found in the SAW might differ from the viral loads measured in
IWW due to in-sewer degradation of viral RNA during sewage transport. Therefore, IWW samples (50 mL)
collected from eight different Belgian WWTPs were processed with the Centricon (100 kDa) and the Macrosep
(100 kDa) centrifugal filters to confirm the results. The effect of direct extraction was also considered because of
the high incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections at the time of sample collection. Figure 4 illustrates the Ct-values for
the different SARS-CoV-2 genes under investigation for the different sample concentration methods. The use of
no concentration step resulted in poor yields of SARS-CoV-2 RNA with Ct-values above the LLOQ only detected
in a few locations, mainly for the N2-gene. This verifies the need for a concentration step to detect the low
concentration levels of SARS-CoV-2 in IWW. The use of the Centricon centrifugal filters resulted in the lowest Ctvalues for the N1- and E-gene. Results for the N2-gene were comparable between the Centricon and Macrosep
centrifugal devices. In the final protocol, ultracentrifugation with Centricon filters was chosen for sample
concentration.

Figure S4 compares the different RNA extraction protocols for both SARS-CoV-2 and PRCV. The use of the
Powermicrobiome kit resulted in low detection levels of the different SARS-CoV-2 genes in IWW. Therefore, this
RNA extraction method was excluded at an early stage. The Viral RNA and RNeasy extraction kit showed
comparable results, with slightly higher detection levels observed with the Viral RNA extraction kit for both SARSCoV-2 and PRCV. The Viral RNA extraction kit also recovered higher viral RNA loads in frozen IWW compared to
the RNeasy extraction kit. However, in frozen IWW viral loads were almost always lower than the LLOQ, as further
discussed in section 3.4.

and more reproducible Ct-values among duplicates observed with the manual RNA extraction kit. However,
automatization of the RNA extraction also significantly increases the throughput of the bioanalytical assay. For
this reason, the Maxwell PureFood GMO and Authentication kit was used for RNA extraction in the final protocol.

3.3. Molecular methods for assaying SARS-CoV-2
3.3.1. qPCR
A surrogate coronavirus (i.e. PRCV) was used as a whole process control. There was an expected repetitive drop
in the Ct-value for the SARS-CoV-2 genes and PRCV_1-gene when amplifying a 10-fold dilution series proving the
applicability of qPCR for the detection of the genes of interest. SARS-CoV-2 genes were not detected in the
negative controls and the positive control tested always positive.

At this moment, investigation of SARS-CoV-2 genes with dPCR remains underexplored [30,31]. IWW samples
from the tail of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic were analyzed with both qPCR and dPCR. dPCR could
potentially be more sensitive in measuring viral RNA loads in IWW because of the higher tolerance to PCR
inhibitors. Due to the high number of partitions (approximately 25,000), chances are low that PCR inhibitors and
SARS-CoV-2 RNA are partitioned in the same reaction well. The positive partition rate was generally low in the
IWW samples (<0.05%). At the low concentration levels observed in these samples, the 95% confidence interval
(CI) with dPCR was also quite broad, as illustrated in Table 3. Concentrations measured with qPCR were the same
order of magnitude as those with dPCR, with the exception of sample 3 and 4 for the E-gene (i.e. 10-fold higher
with qPCR). Overall this indicates that sensitivity of both molecular assays is comparable. D’Aoust et al. also
reported that dPCR did not result in superior detection of SARS-CoV-2 compared to qPCR [31]. In their study
sensitivity was even lower compared to qPCR.

The same calibration curve was processed with both qPCR and dPCR. A major advantage of dPCR is that it allows
absolute quantification and, thus, no standard curve is needed. The different calibration points were amplified
with dPCR as a proxy to validate variability at different concentration levels and Ct-levels with qPCR. This is of
importance because native concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in IWW are in the low copies/µL range. Important
to note is that precision is generally higher with dPCR compared to qPCR because of the higher tolerance to PCR
inhibitors and the use of absolute quantification. Therefore, precision observed with dPCR is used as a proxy for
qPCR, but most likely the actual variability with qPCR will be higher due to methodological differences.

Figure 5 combines the result for the standard curve observed with qPCR with the results of dPCR. At low
concentration levels (10-1 to 100 copies/µL), the width of the CI tends to be rather broad. For the E-gene, no
positive partitions were measured in the reaction well containing the 100 copies/µL calibration point. The width
of the CI for the N1- and N2-gene at this concentration level was 79.0% and 95.7% respectively (see also Table
S1). This further evidences the high variability observed at Ct-values around the LLOQ with qPCR and could
potentially explain why only one single well out of the side-by-side duplicates tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of
course, the high variability observed in WBE applications for SARS-CoV-2 has further implications for the analysis

Figure 6 In-sample stability of the different SARS-CoV-2 genes at (A) 4 °C and (B) -20 °C. The horizontal lines represent
the mean residual percentage for the eight samples. Detection of the N1-gene was generally low in the IWW samples (i.e. 10-1
copies/µL) with Ct-values below the LLOQ in most samples. Therefore, it was not possible to assess in-sample stability for the
N1-gene.

361
362
363
364

In traditional WBE applications, stability is evaluated according to McCall et al. [32]. Generally, WBE biomarkers
are classified as either high (<20% transformation), medium (20-60%), low (60-100%) or variable (i.e. different
results found in WBE studies) stability over a pre-defined time period. However, the variability observed with
native concentrations measured at the LLOQ levels (see section 3.3.2.) complicates this assessment.

365

The N2-gene and E-gene were detected in concentrations above the LLOQ in 100% and 87.5% of the IWW
samples, respectively. The relative standard deviation (%RSD) was relatively high for both SARS-CoV-2 genes, as
illustrated by Figure 6. Additionally, it appears that the variability for the E-gene tends to increase towards the
end of the time period, with the highest %RSD values observed at day 10. On average, the N2-gene shows high
in-sample stability for the entire sampling period, which is in line with the findings of others [17,33,34]. The Egene showed medium to low in-sample stability during the time period, while others reported relatively high insample stability for this gene [33].

373
374
375

377

Most of the stability studies use surrogate viruses to investigate the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater or
often do not include all genes of interest [17,35,36]. Additionally, most of the available stability studies assess
in-sample stability by seeding SARS-CoV-2 or another virus in IWW [33,34]. However, the genome of SARS-CoV2 could potentially be degraded to smaller fragments during in-sewer transport. To our knowledge, only
Hokajärvi et al. and Medema et al. investigated decay of native SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads in IWW [17,33] and
variability reported by Hokajärvi was also substantial.

Freezing the samples drastically influences the in-stability of viral RNA loads of all genes of interest, with a 10fold decrease in SARS-CoV-2 gene copies. This was also observed during method development (Figure S4) where
detection levels were considerably higher in fresh IWW samples (kept at 4 °C) compared to frozen IWW samples.

381
382

During sample transport and storage, IWW samples should be kept at 4 °C to minimize in-sample degradation of
viral RNA loads and IWW samples should be analyzed within three days after sample collection.

At this moment, an ideal external control standard with the same properties as SARS-CoV-2 for quantification is
missing [21]. In this study PRCV was used as a whole process control, but this surrogate might not entirely reflect
the structural properties of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in IWW. In traditional WBE, isotope-labelled analogues are
used for the quantification of chemical biomarkers. However, for biological applications, such controls are
unavailable which could potentially lead to high variability with the current bioanalytical assays. Therefore,
further methodological and molecular assay validation for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in IWW is required to enhance the
accuracy and precision of WBE for SARS-CoV-2. This also further emphasizes the need for surrogate coronaviruses
(e.g. PRCV) as whole process control to ensure overall quality of these bioanalytical assays. The presence of a
whole process control is especially of importance because of the high variability in the composition of the matrix.
The fraction of PCR inhibitors could vary within a single WWTP over time and is potentially very different between
WWTPs. In this study, the %RSD at the low detection levels was still considerable, as indicated with dPCR. The
high variability observed in the LLOQ range also addresses the need for replicates.

To our knowledge, no information is available on the in-sewer degradation of the SARS-CoV-2 genome.
Fragmentation of the genome during in-sewer transport could potentially affect RE with the different
concentration methods found in literature and lead to high variation between WWTPs due to different sewer
structures. In the future, sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in IWW is required to identify the different SARSCoV-2 strains in IWW.

401
402
403

In the final protocol, solids were removed during the pre-centrifugation of the IWW samples. However,
adsorption of the SARS-CoV-2 genome to the pallet could affect RE. In this study, SARS-CoV-2 was detected to
some extent in solids (data not shown), but the overall importance needs to be further explored.

405

The present study proposes an alternative approach to assess RE of SARS-CoV-2 genes in IWW with different
ultracentrifugation protocols. Native concentration levels of the different SARS-CoV-2 genes measured in IWW
from different Belgian WWTPs with the different sample concentration methods were used to optimize RE of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA in IWW. The bioanalytical assay proved to be capable of measuring low concentrations of SARSCoV-2 RNA present in the samples from different IWW sources. The present study is among the first to apply
dPCR for the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in IWW and dPCR results were comparable with the qPCR results.

411
412
413
414
415

The variability observed with the sample concentration methods for SARS-CoV-2 remains substantial due to the
lack of an ‘ideal’ external control standard with similar properties to SARS-CoV-2. At this moment, there is also a
lot of uncertainty regarding the state of SARS-CoV-2 genome (fragments) in IWW due to potential in-sewer
degradation. More research on variability of SARS-CoV-2 in IWW and potential transformation of SARS-CoV-2
RNA in the IWW is necessary to further investigate the applicability of WBE.

416
417
418
419
420

Although WBE can already aid in filling some critical knowledge gaps in the epidemiological surveillance of SARSCoV-2, future research should aim to further validate and standardize bioanalytical assays, especially with
regards to methodological uncertainties. This is especially of importance when the number of WBE applications
on data triangulation with other epidemiological information sources outpace the number of WBE studies that
investigate intrinsic methodological uncertainties.
