Not only does COVID-19 pandemic encourage scientists to look for remedies and treatment
schemes, but also identify the drivers of pathogenicity and spread of the virus.
The scope of this research consisted in identifying recurrence patterns and comparing the
number of daily cases between various countries. Data for countries where at least 500 daily
cases were recorded at least once (17 in Europe, 3 in North America, 7 in South America, 3
in Central America, 17 in Asia and 3 in Africa).
According to our evaluation, the dynamics recorded for 25 countries includes a 7-day
statistically significant component. This statistically significant weekly component has been
identified in 76% of the countries examined in Europe, 66% in North America, 71% in South
America, and 18% in Asia. The range of this rhythmic component is low at the growth stage
and increases at the stabilization and decrease stages.
The weekly phases feature shifting peaks depending on the country. In some cases, the phases
shift, i.e. they are not limited strictly to certain days of the week. Due to range and phase
variation, its explanation cannot be limited to strictly medical and social factors. In some
cases, national incidence dynamics includes 3, 4, 6, 8 and 10-day periods.
Understanding the factors of recurrence patterns in COVID-19 incidence dynamics may help
in the pandemic response.

INTRODUCTION
Studying COVID-10 behaviour in various countries and identifying its rate and spread
drivers are among the most relevant tasks. The solution of these challenges is necessary
both for proper prediction at the practical level and for identifying disease origin and
spread patterns at the fundamental level.
Pandemic response decision-making is frequently related to predictions produced using
various computing models. Such models are based on specific input. The authors of
some recent publications have made attempts to identify COVID-19 drivers [1, 2]. For
example, study [1] offers a statistical analysis of weather-related increase in daily
cases. The authors conclude that disease rate is related to average temperature.
The scope of this study consisted in assessment of COVID-19 daily case increment
dynamics in various countries in order to identify rhythmic components. Identification
of general and specific features in disease dynamics is expected to further insight into
the internal logic of the pandemic spread. This will make prediction, i.e. assessment of

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data sources
Daily COVID-19 case data were obtained from the web site of Center for Systems
Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU)
(https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/) and from Google database of
national agency data ("coronavirus statistics by country" search query). Data
verification for each country was performed through matching data from both sources.
Country selection criteria
The shortlisting criterion required at least a single daily case rate increment equal to or
exceeding 500 at least once within the review period (01.03.2020 - 13.06.2020, 105
days), and the number of zero case days in the above databases not exceeding 3. This
allowed shortlisting the countries where the statistical spread of data did not have
significant impact on the daily increment rates.
Hence, 50 countries with relatively equal distribution across Europe, America and Asia
were included in the sample. The full list of countries is provided in Table 1.
Method
For rhythmical component identification spectrography, wavelet transform and
periodogram method were used.
For LF trend trimming the signal was pre-filtered using a band-pass filter with a
Blackman-Harris window the lower and upper cutoff bandwidth set at 0.1 and 0.95
Nyquist bandwidth respectively.
For comparing results obtained using different tools, the scale parameters obtained
through wavelet transform were converted to temporal characteristics similar to
oscillation periods in spectrography.
In the periodogram analysis, statistical significance of the reviewed periods was
assessed using Wilcoxon distribution-free test.

13.06.2020. See comments in the text.

Figure 1a shows the absolute incidence values for the previous 24 hours. Four time
periods featuring different growth rates are identifiable: (1) a very slow growth at the
initial stage, (2) a rapid increase from 17.03 through 03.04, (3) a plateau from 03.04
through 15.05, and (4) final growth from 15.05 through the end of the period.

that a weekly period has a statistical significance of p<10-7, while its harmonics are 14day (p<10-5) and 21-day (p<10-4) periods. The dotted line indicates a 5% level of
statistical significance (-lg(p)=1.3).
Figure 1c shows the wavelet transform results. X-line is the day scale effective 1 March
2020, and Y-line is the test period scale, the spectral power being shown by coloured
areas. Times scales of figures 1a and 1c match.
All three rhythmic component tests demonstrate the presence of a solid 7-day period.
2nd and 3rd order harmonic components are also evident in the periodogram. Wavelet
and Fourier analysis also reveal periods of about 3 and 15 days. It is arguable that it is
autonomous, rather than a 2nd order harmonic of the weekly period by periodicity,

since the wavelet transform, contrarily to Fourier analysis, has not revealed any
multiple harmonics.
A comparison of figures 1a and 1c reveals that any periodicity is absent in period 1,
where the absolute values are low, with gradual spectral power increase at interval 2,
and is even stronger at intervals 3 and 4, with a slight boundary decrease of the power.
Similar behaviour has been recorded for the 3-day period, despite being much lower in
power. At stage 4 a 15-day period arises and gradually acquires power.
As can be seen from figure 1c, the three and seven day periods have been constant for
two months. Their stability in the dynamics of the global incidence time series, which
is the sum of national autonomous series, is indicative of its existence and need for an
advanced analysis.
Analytical results for 50 countries
In the periodicity analysis of incidence series for 50 countries, we used the level of its
statistical significance in the periodogram method with the boundary value of p<0.05
(-lg(p)>1.3, fig. 1 b). Table 1 represents country samples by continent and shows the
statistical significance of the 7-day period as k=-lg(p).

One of the most likely explanations of the 7-day period could have a social nature, i.e.
inconsistent reporting of new cases on weekdays versus weekends. This hypothesis
was tested by plotting the phases of this period at the global level and for 15 countries
with the most evident weekly period (fig. 3). Since the beginning of the review interval
falls on 1 March (Sunday) and the source data reflect incidence increment reported for
the previous 24 hours, the first two points on the X-line correspond to weekend days
in figure 3 distribution patterns.

Figure 2. National weekly period phases.

As follows from figure 2, phasal dips and peaks occur on different days of the weekly
period depending on the country. The hypothesis related to 7-day period formation due
to decrease in case reporting on weekends can substantiate the dynamics only for some
countries, e.g. USA, Sweden, Brazil and UK. For the rest of the countries this
hypothesis does not provide sufficient substantiation. For example, it does not match
the global weekly periodicity with dips on Thursdays.

Phase coincidence examples
Another argument against the medical and social nature of weekly periodicity consists
in comparing the dynamics between various countries. Figure 3 shows the comparison
between two countries with strongly manifested weekly periods, i.e. the Netherlands
and Spain. This chart includes: (a) superposition of raw time series, (b) superposition
of filtered time series, (c) cross correlation between them, (d) sliding window
correlation by 30 points, (e) and (f) wavelet and Fourier images of the filtered series
for Spain, (g) and (h) equivalent images for the Netherlands. The superposed time
series are shifted against each other by 2 days in figures 3a and 3b.

As follows from figure 3, the pandemic spread phases almost coincide in these two
countries. The curves in figures a and b are shifted against each other by 2 days in order
to better demonstrate the similarity of the weekly phases through the shift. The
existence of the shift is evidenced by cross-correlation, where the peak value of the
function corresponds to -2 days (Fig. 3c). Figure 3d shows a 30 point sliding window
correlation between the two filtered series. Here one can see that there is virtually no
correlation between the series during the first 60 days, or that it is rather negative due
to the phasal differences. However, the correlation ratio increases significantly at the
end of the observation period. This occurs when the oscillations in these two series
synchronize.
Hence, even in incidence time series where the weekly period is the sole and highly
statistically significant one, its phase does not remain constant in some cases.
It is notable that phase periodicity does not depend on the national quarantine policy,
since similar oscillation phases have been recorded for Sweden and Germany, although
not special quarantine restrictions have been introduced in Sweden, by contrast with
Germany. Similar findings have been recorded in the comparison of other countries
differing both in terms of quarantine restrictions and socio-cultural features.
Other periods
Despite the fact that the 7-day period has been recorded in 50% of the countries
included in the sample, presence of other stable periods has been recorded in some
cases. The examples of such countries are provided in figure 4.

Figure 5. Wavelet and Fourier images of incidence time series for countries with other than
weekly incidence dynamics periods. (а) - Poland, (b) - Ireland, (с) - Bangladesh, (d) - Chile.

The examples in figure 4 show an 8-day period in Poland that has been lasting for 2.5
months since the outbreak (early April), and another, less intensive, 3-day period. In
Ireland, where the incidence growth period was rather short and occurred between
April and early May, 10-day and 4-day periods have been recorded throughout the
entire increment interval.
Chile and Bangladesh are among the countries with current rapid increase in daily
incidence. Bangladesh dynamics features 10 and 4 day periods, while Chile - 6 and 3
day periods. An advanced study of the dynamics and identification of the factors related
to such periodicity should become the focus of further exploration.
DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS
A strong weekly period has been identified in 25 countries from the 50 included in the
sample, such weekly period manifesting more evidently at the incidence peak and
decline phases. The weekly period has been identified primarily in European countries
(76% of the countries included in the sample), as well as in North America (66%) and
South America (71%), yet seldom in Asia (18% of the countries included in the
sample). Drawing any conclusions about Africa is difficult, since only three African
counties met the sampling criteria.
The most simple and convincing explanation of the origin of the weekly period in the
incidence dynamics seems to be related to varying levels of epidemiological activity
and admission to hospital over weekdays versus weekends. To some extent it can be
recorded for the relevant structures of all countries included in the sample.
Furthermore, other social or economic factors related to irregularity of case reporting

over the weekly period may exist. However, the factors of phase consistency may only
partially explain the effect, while the rest of it does match this hypothesis.
1. For example, in case of inconsistent intensity of medico-social service activity,
the phase of the effect should remain constant throughout the entire observation
period, with the dip occurring on Saturdays and Sundays. As follows from
figures 3 and 4, this is not true in many cases. Weekly period phase shifts over
the observation period have been recorded in some cases.
2. The weekly period begins to manifest consistently closer to incidence peak and
generally does not manifest at the initial stage. Were this caused by diagnosing
irregularity, periodic existence would not be related to the pandemic phase in a
given country.
3. The weekly period has been detected in the incidence dynamics of countries with
various health care systems and various pandemic response strategies, including
both quarantine-based and quarantine-free (see Table 1).
4. In the incidence dynamics of some countries consistent and statistically
significant periods other than weekly have been recorded, i.e. 6, 8 or 10 days.
Hence, the identified periodicity patterns are not accounted for solely by the
investigated medico-social factors. One could presume that some less obvious medicobiological aspects related to the viral spread underly the observed periodicity patterns.
This problem deserves advanced investigation, since the findings of such investigation
could help to explain the specifics of viral spread in various countries.
