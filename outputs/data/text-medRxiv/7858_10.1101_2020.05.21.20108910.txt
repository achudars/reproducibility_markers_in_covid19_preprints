Abstract

31
32
33

Background: Though ‘infodemiological’ methods have been used in COVID-19 research, an
examination of the extent of infodemic monikers (misinformation) use on the Internet remains
limited.

34
35
36

Objective: To investigate Internet search behavior related to COVID-19 and examine the
circulation of infodemic monikers through two platforms—Google and Instagram—during the
current global pandemic.

37

Methods: Using Google Trends and Instagram hashtags (#), we explored Internet search activities
and behaviors related to the COVID-19 pandemic from February 20, 2020, to May 06, 2020. We
investigated the names used to identify the virus, health and risk perception, life during the
lockdown, and information related to the adoption of COVID-19 infodemic monikers. We
computed the average peak volume (APC) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) during the study
period for the monikers.

Results: The top five COVID-19-related terms in the Google searches were “coronavirus”,
“corona”, “COVID”, “virus”, “corona virus”, and “COVID-19”. Countries with a higher number of
COVID-19 cases had a higher number of COVID-19 queries on Google. The monikers
“coronavirus ozone”, “coronavirus laboratory”, “coronavirus 5G”, “coronavirus conspiracy” and
“coronavirus bill gates” were widely circulated on the Internet. Searches about ‘tips and cures’ for
COVID-19 spiked in relation to the U.S. president speculating about a ‘miracle cure’ and
suggesting the injection of disinfectant to treat the virus. Around two-thirds (66.1%) of Instagram
users used the hashtags “COVID-19”, and “coronavirus” to disperse virus-related information.

54

Conclusion: Globally, there is a growing interest in COVID-19, and numerous infodemic monikers
continue to circulate on the Internet. Based on our findings, we hope to encourage mass media
regulators and health organizers to be vigilant and diminish the use and circulation of these
infodemic monikers on the Internet, to decrease the spread of misinformation.

Introduction

70

Globally, the Internet is an extremely important platform for obtaining knowledge and information

71

about the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic [1-3]. The Google Trends tool provides real-

72

time insights into internet search behavior on various topics, including COVID-19 [4]. Social media

73

platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram allow users to communicate their thoughts,

74

feelings, and opinions by sharing short messages. A unique aspect of social media data from

75

Instagram is that image-based posts are accessible, and the use of topic-related hashtags (#) allows

76

access to topic-related information for all Internet users [5]. In general, there is a growing interest in

77

examining social data to understand and monitor public behavior in real-time [6,7].

78

Research on the Internet and social data are called Infodemiology or Infoveillance studies

79

[8]. Infodemiology is defined as “the science of distribution and determinants of information in an

80

electronic medium, specifically the Internet, or in a population, with the ultimate aim to inform

81

public health and public policy” [9]. Although several studies have been conducted using

82

‘infodemiological’ methods in COVID-19 research, a limited number of studies have examined the

83

extent of COVID-19-related misinformation on the Internet [10-14]. The fake news, misleading,

84

and misinformation circulating on the Internet are referred to as “infodemic monikers”. These

85

monikers can profoundly affect public health communication and also contribute to xenophobia

86

[12-17]. “Infodemic monikers” are defined as substantially erroneous information, which give rise

87

to interpretation mistakes, fake news, episodes of racism, or any other forms of misleading

88

information circulating on the internet [14]. In this context, we aimed to investigate the Internet

89

search behavior related to COVID-19 and the extent of infodemic monikers circulating on Google

90

and Instagram during the current pandemic period in the world.

Methods

95

We used Google Trends and Instagram hashtags to explore internet search activities and behaviors

96

related to the COVID-19 pandemic from February 20, 2020, to May 06, 2020. We investigated the

97

following: names used to identify the virus, health and risk perception, life during the lockdown,

98

and information related to the adoption of infodemic monikers related to COVID-19. The complete

99

list terms used to identify the most frequently searched queries in Google and the hashtag

100

suggestions for Instagram are presented in Supplementary File 1.

101

The obtained infodemic monikers are characterized as follows:

102

1. Generic: The moniker confuses, due to lack of specificity.

103

2. Misinformative: The moniker associates a certain phenomenon with fake news.

104

3. Discriminatory: The moniker encourages the association of a problem with a specific

105

ethnicity and/or geographical region.

106

4. Deviant: The moniker does not identify the requested phenomenon.

107

5. Other specificities: We keep two additional points for special cases that prove

108

exceptionally serious.

109

To determine the severity of various infodemic monikers circulating on the Internet, each

110

moniker was assigned 1 to 2 points on the infodemic scale (I-scale) ranging from 0 (minimum)

111

to 10 (maximum). Based on the sum of the I-scale scores, the infodemic monikers were

112

classified as follows:

113

•

Not infodemic: 0

114

•

Lowly infodemic: 1

115

•

Moderately infodemic: >1- 4

116

•

Highly infodemic: 5-8

117

•

Extremely infodemic: 9-10

118

For each search keyword considered, Google Trends provided normalized data in the form of

119

relative search volume (RSV) based on search popularity ranging from 0 (low) to 100 (highly

120

popular). Using these RSV values, we computed the average peak volume (APC) with a 95%

121

confidence interval (CI) during the study period.

122

Instagram, a platform for image-based posts with hashtags (#) was screened. We retrieved

123

content based on hashtags through image classifiers, every 3-4 days during the study period. All

124

irrelevant content was excluded. The data collected included contents posted on Instagram and self-

125

reported user demographic information. No personal information, such as emails, phone numbers,

126

or addresses, was collected. The data from the Instagram hashtags were collected manually, through

127

the Instagram-suggested tags associated with specific countries.

128

All data used in the study were obtained from anonymous open sources. Thus, ethical

129

approval was not required.

130

Results

131

The top five COVID-19 related infodemic and scientific terms used in Google searches were

132

“coronavirus”, “corona”, “COVID”, “virus”, “corona virus”, and “COVID-19” [Figure 1]. The most

133

frequently used keywords globally were “coronavirus” (APC: 1378, 95% CI: 1246-1537), followed

134

by “corona” (APC: 530, 95% CI: 477-610) and “COVID” (APC: 345, 95% CI: 292-398). Several

135

keywords related to COVID-19 (Table 1) were identified, of the top 10, five had an I-scale value of

136

8: “corona”, “corona Italy”, “corona Deutschland”, “corona China” and “corona Wuhan”.

137

The country-wise dispersion of the scientific and infodemic names of COVID-19 used in Google

138

searches are shown in Figure 2. Countries with a higher number of COVID-19 cases per 1 million

139

population have recorded greater Google search queries related to COVID-19 (Italy, Spain, Ireland,

140

Canada, France, and Qatar). These COVID-19-related search queries were significantly correlated

141

with the incidence of COVID-19 cases across the countries (Pearson R = 0.45, p<0.05).

142

The top COVID-19-related infodemic monikers such as “coronavirus ozone”, “coronavirus

143

laboratory”, and “coronavirus 5G” frequently circulated on the Internet are presented in Table 2.

144

The following are infodemic monikers with the highest I-scores globally, “coronavirus conspiracy”

145

(I-score: 10), “coronavirus laboratory” (I-score: 9), and “coronavirus 5G” (I-score: 9). Additionally,

146

the use of monikers with moderate to high infodemicity far exceeded the use of scientific names

147

(Table 2): 57% of Google web searches are moderately infodemic (total APC: 109, 95% CI: 89 –

148

139) and 16% highly infodemic (total APC: 30, 95% CI: 25 – 34). The circulation of these

149

infodemic monikers was further examined to understand the events associated with these searches.

150

Infodemic monikers related to coronavirus origins, such as SARS-CoV-2 made in the laboratory”

151

went viral (APC: 41) when the National Association Press Agency (NAPA) from Italy posted a

152

2015 video about the origins of SARS-CoV-2 virus on March 25, 2020[18]. In addition, the

153

moniker reached the breakout level (RSV: 100) on April 17, 2020, when the French Noble Prize

154

winner Prof. Luc Montagnier stated that the new coronavirus is the result of a laboratory accident in

155

the Wuhan high-security laboratory in China [19]. Detailed information on the different infodemic

156

monikers and the associated events are shown in Figure 3.

157

The top searches related to health, precautions, and COVID-19 news are presented in Figure

158

4. Google searches related to COVID-19 news remained at the top throughout the pandemic period.

159

However, searches related to ‘tips and cures’ for COVID-19 spiked multiple times when the U. S.

160

president suggested that hydroxychloroquine (an unproven drug) was a ‘miracle cure’ on April 4,

161

2020 (RSV: 70) [20] and also injecting disinfectant to treat COVID-19 on April 24, 2020 (RSV:

162

53) [21]. Other searches related to the use of medical masks and disinfectants (APC: 23, 95% CI: 21

163

– 25), lockdown (APC: 19, 95% CI: 16 – 22), and COVID-19 symptoms (APC: 12, 95% CI: 10 –

164

15), are less frequently used in Google searches.

165

The top 10 COVID-19-related hashtags used on Instagram (country-specific) and groups and

166

topics associated with these hashtags are summarized in Table 3. Around one million users from

167

Italy used ‘covid-19’ as a hashtag 3.6 million times to communicate information related to health,

168

stay-home/safe (93.3 million times). These hashtags remained at the top for use for COVID-19-

169

related communication on Instagram. Similarly, Instagram users from Brazil (551,000), Spain

170

(376,000), Indonesia (298,000), and other countries were mostly used Instagram frequently to

171

distribute COVID-19 related information. Moreover, the contribution of the ‘covid-19’ hashtag for

172

COVID-19 related information was 35.6%, followed by ‘coronavirus’ (30.5%), ‘corona’ (25.6%),

173

and ‘COVID’ (8%) [Figure 5].

174

Discussion

175

In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we are the first to investigate the Internet search

176

behavior of the public and the extent of Infodemic monikers circulated on Google and Instagram

177

globally. Our results suggest that (i). “coronavirus”, “corona”, “COVID”, “virus”, “corona virus”,

178

and “COVID-19” are the top five terms used in the Google searches. (ii). countries (e.g., Italy,

179

Spain, Ireland, Canada, and France) with a high incidence of COVID-19 cases (per million) have

180

recorded greater Google search queries about COVID-19. (iii). “coronavirus ozone”, “coronavirus

181

laboratory”, “coronavirus 5G”, “coronavirus conspiracy” and “coronavirus bill gates” are widely

182

used infodemic monikers on the Internet. However, the “coronavirus conspiracy” was the only

183

moniker that achieved the highest I-score of 10. (iv). though COVID-19 news remains at the top,

184

web searches related to ‘tips and cures’ for COVID-19 spiked when the U.S. president speculated

185

about a ‘miracle cure’ and the injection of a disinfectant to treat COVID-19. (v). Around two-thirds

186

(66.1%) of Instagram users use “COVID-19”, and “coronavirus” as a hashtag to disperse the

187

information related to COVID-19.

188

Exploring research using nontraditional data sources such as social media has several

189

implications. First, our results demonstrated a potential application for using Instagram as a

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.21.20108910; this version posted June 18, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

190

complementary tool to aid in understanding online search behavior and also provided real-time

191

tracking of infodemic monikers circulated on the Internet. The strength of this study is the

192

investigation of various infodemic monikers dispersed on the internet and correlating them with the

193

events associated with that particular day. By characterizing and classifying various infodemic

194

monikers based on the degree of infodemicity scores (I-score), researchers can foster new methods

195

of using social media data to monitor the monikers' outcomes. The analysis and methods used in

196

this study could leverage public health and communication agencies in identifying and diminishing

197

infodemic monikers circulating on the Internet.

198

Findings from this study validate and extend previously published works that used Google

199

keywords [1,12,13]. We also demonstrate the potential for the use of Instagram hashtags to monitor

200

and predict both the cyber behavior and relaying of misinformation on the Internet [22-24]. In 2017,

201

Guidry et al. studied Ebola-related risk perception in Instagram users and identified that a

202

significant proportion of posts on Instagram had rampant misinformation about the Ebola disease

203

during the outbreak [22]. In addition, the percentage of Instagram posts and tweets posted by health

204

organizations (CDC, WHO, MSF) to correct misinformation are less than 5% [22]. In general,

205

negative information posted on the Internet tends to receive a greater weight among netizens. Thus,

206

this should be counter-balanced with evidence-based solution content from health organizations,

207

particularly in the current pandemic situation. For example, when the US president suggested

208

injecting disinfectant to treat COVID-19, the number of Google searches considering it as a cure

209

sharply increased (APC:53) and also implicated 30 cases of disinfectant poisoning within 18 hours

210

in New York City [25]. Health authorities should be vigilant and provide more positive and

211

informative messages to combat the circulation of infodemic monikers on social media. Future

212

studies will need to investigate the influence of infodemic monikers on individual cyber behavior.

213

Limitations

214

Our study used Google Trends, which provides the search behavior of people using their search

215

engines, but not others. We mainly focused on Google and Instagram for data retrieval. Future

216

studies should consider studying the same topic on other social media platforms to capture a more

217

diverse population of users. Instagram searches were conducted manually, introducing a variable of

218

error. Going forward, the use of an automated program can improve the accuracy of the data

219

collected and analyzed. Lastly, Google Trends did not provide any information about the methods

220

used to generate search data and algorithms.

221

Conclusion

222

Using Google Trends and Instagram hashtags, the present study identified that there is a growing

223

interest in COVID-19 globally and in countries with a higher incidence of the virus. Searches

224

related to ‘COVID-19 news’ are quite frequent and two-thirds (66.1%) of Instagram users have

225

used “COVID-19”, and “coronavirus” as hashtags to disperse information related to the virus.

226

Several infodemic monikers are circulating on the Internet, with “coronavirus conspiracy” identified

227

as the most popular moniker (I-score of 10). Given the prevalence of the infodemic moniker use,

228

mass media regulators and health organizers should monitor and diminish the impact of these

229

monikers. These governing bodies should also be encouraged to take serious actions against those

230

spreading misinformation in social media.
