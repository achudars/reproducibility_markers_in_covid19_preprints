Short title: Key to successful treatment of COVID-19
Abstract
Background：
COVID-19 is a new and highly contagious respiratory disease that has caused global
spread, high case fatality rate in severe patients, and a huge medical burden due to
invasive mechanical ventilation. The current diagnosis and treatment guidelines are
still need to be improved, and more excellent clinical experience is needed to provide
reference.
Methods：
We analyzed and summarized clinical data of 97 confirmed COVID-19 adult patients
(including 26 severe cases) admitted to the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen
University from January 17, 2020 to March 10, 2020,included laboratory examination
results, imaging findings, treatment effect, prognosis , etc, in order to put forward
prediction index of severe COVID-19 patients, principles of early intervention and
methylprednisolone usages in COVID-19 patients.
Results：
1. Hypoxemia, hyperlactic acid, hypoproteinemia, and hypokalemia were prevalent in
COVID-19 patients.The significant low lymphocyte count, hypoproteinemia,
hypokalemia, the persistent or worsen high CRP, high D-dimer, and high BNP, and
the occurrence of hemoptysis and novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) viremia were
important indicators for early diagnosis and prediction of severe disease progression.

2. Characteristic images of lung CT had a clear change in COVID - 19, Ground-glass
opacity (GGO) and high-density linear combinations may indicate different
pathological changes. Rapid lobular progression of GGO suggests the possibility of
severe disease.
3. Basic principles of early intervention treatment of COVID-19: on the premise of no
effective antiviral drugs, treatment is based on supportive and symptomatic therapy
(albumin supplementation, supplement of potassium, supplement blood plasma, etc.)
in order to maintain the stability of the intracellular environment and adequately
reactivate body immunity to clean up SARS-CoV-2 .
4.

According to severity, oxygenation index, body weight, age, underlying diseases,

appropriate amount methylprednisolone application on severe/critical COVID-19
patients on demand, improved blood oxygen and reduced the utilization rate of
invasive mechanical ventilation, case fatality rate and medical burden significantly.
The most common indications for invasive mechanical ventilation should be strictly
control in critical COVID-19 patients.
Conclusions:
1.Accurate and timely identification of clinical features in severe risks, and early and
appropriate intervention can block disease progression. 2.Appropriate dose of
methylprednisolone can effectively avoid invasive mechanical ventilation and reduce
case fatality rate in critical COVID-19 patients.

Introduction

COVID-19 is a new and highly contagious respiratory disease caused by Severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Sudden and rapid progression to
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the severe and fatal feature of
COVID-19. The current outbreak of COVID-19 has caused global pandemic. Up to
March 24, 2020, there are 812,18 confirmed patients and 3,281 deaths in 31 provinces
in China[1]. In all world, there are 1051,635 confirmed cases and 56,985 confirmed
deaths[2], COVID-19 has a high case fatality rate in severe patients and a huge
medical burden caused by invasive mechanical ventilation[3,4], National Health
Commission of the People’s Republic of China has issued the relevant diagnosis and
treatment guidelines for COVID - 19, which have been updated to the 7th
edition[5],WHO also referred to the Chinese COVID - 19 guidelines for diagnosis and
treatment, and proposed internationally oriented advice on diagnosis and treatment[6].
However, with the continuous recognition of this new disease, we believe that the
current diagnosis and treatment guidelines still need to be improved, such as the
characteristic clinical symptoms of COVID-19, meaningful laboratory examination
indicators, the diagnosis basis of covid-19 pneumonia, the limitation of glucocorticoid
usage and dosage in treatment, and the choice of mechanical ventilation timing. More
excellent experience in clinical diagnosis and treatment is needed for reference.
The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, as the only designated
COVID- 19 hospital in Zhuhai city, has admitted 97 cases of COVID-19 patients, all
of whom have been successfully cured and discharged. Through the analysis and
summary of the diagnosis and treatment process of these patients, we hope to provide
some reference advice on the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, especially how
to accurately identify the risk of severe disease and early block disease progression,
and rationally apply glucocorticoid to reduce the rate of invasive mechanical
ventilation and case fatality rate of severe patients.

Material and method
1. Data sources
This study was a retrospective single-center study, which included 97 confirmed
COVID-19 adult patients (more than 14 years old) admitted to the Fifth Affiliated
Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from January 17, 2020 to March 10, 2020. This
retrospective observational study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of
The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and the need for informed
consent was waived, considering the retrospective study design. Clinical data were
extracted from electronic medical records, including basic demographic data,
symptoms, vital signs, clinical classification, complications and the SARS-CoV-2
RNA of nasopharyngeal swab and blood samples clearance time which was defined as
the time of after two consecutive negative real-time PCR results with 1-day interval.
2. Diagnostic basis
COVID-19 was diagnosed and clinically classified according to the new coronavirus
pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan (trial version 7)[5].
3. Statistical analysis
Categorical variables were described as frequency rates and percentages, and
continuous variables were described using mean (±SD, standard deviation), median
and interquartilerange (IQR) values. Means for continuous variables were compared
using independent group t tests and one way ANVOA when the data were normally
distributed and homoscedasticity; otherwise ,the Mann-Whitney U test and
Kruskal-Wallis H were used when the data were nonnormal distribution. Proportions
for categorical variables were compared using the chi-squared test, although the
Fisher exact test was used when the data were limited. All Statistical analysis was

performed using SPSS software (Version 26.0, IBM). For unadjusted comparisons, a
two-sided P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
1.Demographic and clinical characteristics on admission of COVID-19 patients
A total of 103 patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab test in
Zhuhai, 5 of whom were younger than 14 years old, belonged to pediatric diagnosis
and treatment; the first case (death case) among adults was not treated by our medical
team. A total of 97 patients treated by the diagnosis and treatment team included in
the analysis of this report, of which 26 were severe, accounting for 26.8%. Among the
cases of COVID-19 in Zhuhai, 69 of the 97 patients were local residents of Wuhan or
had lived in Wuhan within 14 days before the onset, 8 cases were from Hubei area
outside Wuhan, 14 had a history of direct contact with personnel from Hubei, and
another 6 cases did not have a clear epidemiological history. The proportion of severe
cases of patients directly from Wuhan was lower than that of non-severe cases
(P=0.028), but the proportion of severe cases of patients who had no clear
epidemiological history was higher (P=0.023). This coincides with the possibility of
multiple origins of the new coronavirus. Clinical symptoms found in these COVID-19
patients were: fever, shortness of breath, cough, diarrhea, loss of appetite,
hemoptysis ,fatigue, nasal congestion, runny nose, chest tightness, and sputum.
Hemoptysis was a distinctive symptoms of severe patients (26.9% vs 0, p <0.001
table1); shortness of breath was more common in severe patients (100% vs 9.9%, p
<0.001 table1), and the incidence of fever symptoms was more in severe patients than
non-severe (80.8% vs 50.7%, p = 0.008 table1). There was no any clinical symptoms
in 12.4% of non-severe COVID-19 patients. The underlying diseases of these patients
were: hypertension in 16 cases, diabetes mellitus in six cases,
(Progression-Free-Survival)lung cancer in two cases,

cured bladder cancer in one case, old

tuberculosis in two cases, mental illness in two cases, hypothyroidism in two cases,
coronary heart disease in two case, hyperlipidemia in one case, and renal failure in
one case. There was no statistical difference between non-severe and severe patients
(P> 0.05). The basic information and clinical symptoms of patients included in this
study are shown in Table 1.
2. Characteristics of laboratory findings during the whole course of COVID-19
patients
Routine examinations were performed in almost all 97 COVID-19 patients, including
total blood count, liver and kidney function, electrolyte, blood gas analysis, LDH, CK,
CK-MB,α-HBDH,CRP, BNP, D-dimer, lung CT.
We selected and analyzed the most significant abnormal changes in the relevant
laboratory indicators over the course of COVID-19. Throughout the disease course,
hypoxemia (93.8%), hyperlactic acidemia (89.7%), hypoproteinemia (89.7%),
hypokalemia (70.1%), and high CRP(53.6%) were common in 97 COVID-19 patients.
Above indicators (except lactic acid) also showed significant differences between
non-severe and severe (P<0.05, Table2).
In addition, the valley value of lymphocyte count and PCO2 was lower, while the
peak value of BNP and the D-dimer were higher in severe COVID-19 patients than
the non-severe ones(P<0.05, Table2).
In addition, we found the proportion of abnormal of Lactic dehydrogenase, Total
protein, Pondus Hydrogenii, Glutamic oxalacetic transaminase, Creatine kinase MB,
Creatine kinase, Urea nitrogen was low (< 30%, Table2) in these patients. The
abnormal of Glutamic oxalacetic transaminase, Lactic dehydrogenase and Creatine
kinase MB tend to occur in severe COVID-19 patients (P<0.05, Table2).

3. Significant laboratory and clinical predictors of severe/critical COVID-19
For the above indicators with significant differences in COVID-19, we are more
concerned about their changes in the course of disease, especially for the prediction of
severe disease. Lymphocyte count, CRP, D-dimer, BNP, albumin, and potassium
were abnormal throughout most of the course of the severe COVID-19 patients
(Figure 1). It suggested that abnormalities in these indicators can early predict the
progression of the severe disease. Lymphocyte and CRP recovery were slow in severe
patients (Figure 1). So it must be attention to the balance between early immune
response and lateral inflammatory reaction, especially during the first 2 weeks of the
course of the disease. The level of D-dimer and BNP gradually increased during the
first week of the course of the disease, and reached the peak at day 8-9 of the course
of the disease, and then slowly decreased, which suggested that the risk of secondary
thrombosis and myocardial injury should be paid attention to during the peak period.
The recovery of hypoalbuminemia was still slow in the case of continuous
supplementation (20g-40g albumin per day), lasting the whole course of

severe

patients, which also suggested that the consumption and loss of albumin may persist.
Hypokalemia was also more obvious in severe patients, but it can be basically
maintained in the normal range after active potassium supplementation.The overall
course of the disease in severe patients lasted about three weeks before most
indicators return to normal levels(Figure 1).
As shown in Table3,COVID-19 patients were classified as mild (OI> 300mmHg),
severe (150≤OI≤300mmHg), critical (OI<150mmHg) stage. Among the 26 severe
patients, three patients were severe on admission, the other 23 patients all progressed
rapidly from non-severe to severe stage, and 10 cases developed to critical stage with
oxygenation index further decreased to less than 150mmHg.
We compared the characteristic symptoms and laboratory results of these groups at

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.06.20054890; this version posted April 11, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

different stages. In addition to the oxygenation index which was an important
indicator, we are more concerned about the predictive effect of changes in clinical
symptoms and relevant laboratory indicators.
We also selected and analyzed the most significant abnormal changes in the relevant
symptoms and laboratory indicators in three stages over the course of COVID-19.
Hemoptysis, dyspnea, hyperbilirubinemia, high α-HBDH and high LDH were more
common in severe and critical stage than in mild stage (P<0.05). Lymphocyte count,
CRP, D-dimer, BNP, and Albumin were generally abnormal in the course of
COVID-19 patients, and the abnormal changes were more significant with the
aggravation of the disease. (P<0.05).The deterioration of the above indicators
indicated that the patient's condition was rapid progress, which required close
monitoring and early intervention.
Blood SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 33 of the 97 COVID-19 patients enrolled
in this study. The results of Viral nucleic acid were interpreted as positive results in
four patients, and the oxygenation index of all the 4 patients was lower than
150mmHg.It is suggested that patients with positive blood SARS-CoV nucleic acid
test had a high potential risk, and are likely to progress to severe or critical disease, so
the changes of the condition should be closely observed.
4.Characteristics of lung CT of COVID-19 and prediction of severe risk
The pneumonia like change is important lung sign in COVID-19. If there is no change
in lung CT, it will not progress to severe disease. The common sign in lung CT is
ground-glass opacity (GGO) and some high-density line-like and flake-like
consolidation. If GGO enlarged fast or new GGO lesions appeared in multiple lobes
(as shown in Figures 2-A-B), high-density line-like consolidation appeared in the
central part of GGO lesions or fusioned quickly into a sheet (as shown in Figures
3-A-B), we should pay attention to the acute deterioration of COVID-19. As for

lesion range on lung CT scans, we saw a greater frequency of bilateral lung
involvement, and a greater number of pulmonary lobes involved, higher frequency of
consolidation and more mediastinal lymph node enlargement in severe COVID-19
cases than in non-severe ones (5 vs 1, P <0.001, Table 4), suggesting that both lungs
involved, multiple lobes involvement and rapid lesion progression are important
indicators for predicting disease progression to severe disease.
5、Basic principles of early intervention treatment of COVID-19 patients
On the basis of respecting the clinical characteristics and current known pathological
process of COVID-19, our team mainly adopts symptomatic supportive treatment
measures. Blind medication was avoided during the treatment. All medicines used are
considered to effectively protect and support the patient's own immune function
against viruses. As shown in table 5, due to the common hypoproteinemia (89.7%)
and hypokalemia (70.1%), we provided corresponding supplements to maintain body
fluid electrolytes and internal environment and nutrition balance. Especially in all
severe patients, 20-40g albumin / d was given, adjusted according to the heart
function. Appropriate plasma supplementation had been applied in 68.8% severe and
all critical cases, which could supply immunoglobulins and lymphokines to support
the body's normal antiviral effect. We think that plasma (especially fresh plasma)

had been given in 89.7% of all patients at early stage. When OI declined below
300mmHg ， medium-high flow rate to inhale oxygen through the nasal catheter to
maintain SaO2 higher than 95%, but if OI declined continually ， high-flow nasal
cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) should be applied as early as possible. We found that

HFNC could achieve good blood oxygen maintenance effect even in severe and
critical patients, with better tolerance than non-invasive mechanical ventilation. With
early and appreciated intervention and treatment, only one case took invasive
mechanical ventilation for short time.
6 、 Application principles and effects of methylprednisolone in severe/critical
COVID-19 patients
In this study, 22 patients were treated with methylprednisolone, of which 7 cases were
for dealing with high fever in small doses of 40mg. And the other 15 cases were for
rescuing, when theyhad sudden respiratory distress and a sharp decrease in OI. In
these patients with OI <150mmHg or close to 150mmHg, the application of
methylprednisolone varied from 1 to 3 times, but single or as few times as possible
application was recommended, rather than continuous and long-term applications.
And the single dose of methylprednisolone was 40mg-500mg, according to severity,
oxygenation index, speed of progression, production of inflammatory factors, body
weight, age and underlying diseases condition. As shown in Figure 4, after treatment
with methylprednisolone, the patient's OI improved significantly, and all but one
avoided invasive mechanical ventilation. The most important application principles of
methylprednisolone had been shown in table 6.
Otherwise, it is important to prevent possible side effects in advance, with proton
pump inhibitor, appropriated anticoagulation, monitoring blood pressure, blood
glucose, electrolyte disorder. All 22 patients treated with methylprednisolone had no
gastrointestinal bleeding manifestations; no obvious change in blood glucose and
blood pressure, no osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) in one-month-follow
up.
We analyzed the effect of methylprednisolone to time for Negative-conversing in
2019-nCoV testing of nasopharyngeal swab. The time for Negative-conversing in

SARS-CoV-2 testing were 10.0 ± 5.3d and 10.0 ± 7.9d

in patients with or without

methylprednisolone respectively, and there was no statistical difference between the
two groups (P> 0.05 ,Figure 5), indicating that application of methylprednisolone
according to above principles does not extend SARS-CoV-2 clearing up time.
Discussion
COVID-19 is respiratory infectious diseases with global outbreak currently. Up to
March 24, 2020, the global case fatality rate was 4.4% [2]. In the cohort study of 41
COVID-19 patients in Wuhan at early stage of epidemic, 13 cases were admitted to
the intensive care unit (ICU) , and 6 cases died at last [3]. In another cohort study of
138 COVID-19 patients, 36 cases had been transferred to ICU, and of which 4 (11.1%)
cases died [7]. The fatality rate was significantly higher in the severe COVID-19
patients. The treatment of mechanical ventilation in critical patients brings also huge
medical burden[4].So far, no specific anti- SARS-CoV-2 drug has been found
successfully [8,9].Therefore, it is extremely important to recognize the predictive risk
factors of disease aggravation, identify severe disease early, give scientific and
effective treatment programs, block the progression to severe disease, and avoid
intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation in critical disease to reduce the case
fatality rate. Based on successfully treatment of 97 COVID-19 patients (including 26
severe, 10 critical) in our hospital, we would like to share and discuss our experience
in recognizing and intervention of severe early and timely.
Consistent with previous research[10-15], persisted or worsen hypoxemia, low
lymphocyte count, hypoalbuminemia, hypokalemia, high CRP, high D- dimer, and
high BNP were important indicators of predictive risk factors of disease aggravation
in our study. Hypoxemia is the most common clinical feature throughout the course of
disease (93.8% of all patients ) in COVID-19 cases, even if someone have no
shortness of breath on admission. The declining of OI in severe patients was more

significantly than that in non-severe cases. Shortness of breath was shown in all
severe patients, which was 92% of ICU patients in the research of Huang et al[3] . A
large scale multicenter research [12] of 1099 COVID-19 patients from 31 provinces
reported 95.5%, 81.5% and 59.6% of severe cases had low lymphocyte count, high
CRP and high D- dimer respectively, which were significant difference from
non-severe ones.

In the research of Huang[3] , low lymphocyte count,

hypoalbuminemia and high D- dimer had been found common in severe COVID-19
patients, particularly in critical cases in ICU. In addition , we also found the
hypokalemia and high BNP were more significant in severe cases than non-severe
ones. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 viremia should also be paid attention to, as a
predictor for progression to severe. Except for the abnormal values of above
indicators, we found that it was more important to observe the changing trend of these
indicators during course of disease. More significant low lymphocyte count and high
CRP appeared in severe patients from the beginning and continued the whole course,
which indicated the imbalance between early immune response and lateral
inflammatory reaction. Liu[11] et al reported that mean days from illness onset to ICU
admission were 8d in the severe or critical type. In our study, the peak of obvious
abnormality of D-dimer and BNP appeared at day 8-9 of the disease course and then
decreased slowly, which indicated early recognition of critical signs and the risk of
secondary thrombosis and myocardial injury. The persistent hypoalbuminemia and
hypokalemia suggested that the imbalance of homeostasis , at the same time
instructed treatment.
Some characteristic imaging findings, such as GGO, nodules, stripe and
patchy consolidation , bronchial abnormalities, were consistent with previous studies
[3,12,16].

The abnormal images on lung CT were corresponding to the pathological

features of COVID-19 pneumonia[17]. Two types of acute exudative pathological
changes had been considered corresponding to imaging change in these COVID-19

patients:

mainly serous exudation (mainly albumin exudation and manifested as

GGO in lung CT), and fibrinous exudation (fibrin exudation and manifested as
stripe and patchy consolidation in lung CT). Otherwise, bleeding exudation might
happen on a few severe patients with hemoptysis, but no obvious damage of lung
structure showed in lung CT. As for the characteristic imaging findings and the
progress of imaging change on lung CT in COVID-19 patients, it is more meaningful
to judge the severe risk of the disease. In my opinion, lung CT should be reviewed
and evaluated timely. Multi-lobar or rapidly progressing GGO and consolidation on
chest CT were important indicators of predictive risk factors of disease aggravation in
our study.
According to the clinical characteristics of COVID-19, early and timely intervention
is important. In this study, none of the 97 patients had basic diseases of immune
dysfunction. Therefore, it is considered that immune dysfunction and internal
environmental disorder are transient after the virus infection. So in the treatment, we
mainly focused on symptomatic and supportive treatment in the early stage, such as
adequate supplementation of albumin, plasma and potassium, in order to maintain the
stability of the intracellular environment and adequately reactivate body immunity to
clean up sars-cov-2 by themselves, which is consistent with Lei Zhang's opinion

[18].

At the same time, continuous application of small doses of glucocorticoid should be
avoided in case of suppressing the body's immune function at this stage.
HFNC should be applied as early as possible, if patients had progressive decline of
OI. We found that HFNC could achieve good blood oxygen maintenance effect even
in severe and critical patients, with better tolerance than non-invasive mechanical
ventilation. The most common indications for invasive mechanical ventilation should
be strictly control in critical COVID-19 patients. Based on our experience,
appropriate pulse methylprednisolone application on severe/critical COVID-19

patients on demand, improved blood oxygen and reduced the utilization rate of
invasive mechanical ventilation, case fatality rate and medical burden significantly. A
meta-analysis

[19]

shows that glucocorticoid is a more effective drug for suppressing

the occurrence of inflammatory storms, and it is safe within a certain dose range. The
emergence of COVID-19 inflammatory storm is often life-threatening in a short time,
with a variety of inflammatory factors[3] , so the effect of single IL-6 mAb on
COVID-19 should be further evaluated [20] . If the inflammatory storms could not be
suppressed timely, multiple organ failure and death might be caused. So far,
glucocorticoid may be unique effective medicine suppressing the progress of the
inflammatory storm with appropriated and reasonable application. The application of
glucocorticoids in viral pneumonia is currently controversial. A retrospective cohort
study about SARS showed that glucocorticoids can reduce case fatality rate and
hospital stays

[21],

but there are also studies that show that glucocorticoids may

increase the case fatality rate of SARS patients and delay the virus clearance time [22,
23].In

patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and influenza virus

pneumonia, the use of glucocorticoids is also controversial

[24,25,26,27,28].

Application

indication and dosage of corticosteroid had been strictly controlled from the
beginning of epidemic of COVID-19, and corticosteroid had be recommended not be
used for the treatment of 2019-nCoV-induced lung injury or shock outside of a
clinical trial [29]. Although this issue has always been controversial [30]，clinical usage
of corticosteroid was obviously restricted, and the role was underestimated greatly.
The most obvious effects of methylprednisolone therapy in our study were that
invasive mechanical ventilation had been avoided in 14 patients, the time to use
invasive mechanical ventilation had been shortened significantly in one patient,
medical expenses had been reduced greatly, and no death happened. There were no
obvious adverse reactions during one-month follow up. According to some reports,
we find that there are too many critical patients admitted in ICU at the same time or

there is no qualification or condition of invasive mechanical ventilation treatment in
some hospital admitting COVID-19 patients. In this case, methylprednisolone therapy
might be an effective choice. Based on the data and experience of our team, it is
recommended to improve the status of glucocorticoids in the treatment of severe
COVID-19, and organize multi-center large-scale retrospective studies and possible
prospective studies.
Conclusion:
After summarizing the successful treatment of 97 COVID-19 patients (26 severe
cases) by our team, we found accurate and timely identification of clinical features in
severe risks, and early and appropriate intervention could block disease progression.
Appropriate dose of methylprednisolone can effectively avoid invasive mechanical
ventilation and reduce case fatality rate in severe and critical COVID-19 patients.
