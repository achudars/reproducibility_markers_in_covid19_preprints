Abstract

During the recent Covid-19 pandemic, additive Technology and Social Media were used to tackle the

shortage of Personal Protective Equipment. A literature review and a social media listening software

were employed to explore the number of the users referring to specific keywords related to 3D

printing and PPE. Additionally, the QALY model was recruited to highlight the importance of the PPE

usage. More than 7 billion users used the keyword covid or similar in the web while mainly Twitter

and Facebook were used as a world platform for PPE designs distribution through individuals and

more than 100 different 3D printable PPE designs were developed.

Keywords: Covid – 19, 3D printing, PPE, Social Media.

1. Introduction

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) or SARS – CoV – 2 has already spread worldwide and affected

more than 2.000.000 people, with almost 137.000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University

(April 16, 2020) [1]. The case fatality range for the ages between 40 – 49 estimated at 0.4% and

increased at 14.8% for the 80+ age range. The epidemiological statistics were similar for most cases

with some notable exceptions, such as Italy which did not follow the general rule [2]. One of the

most important factors enabling the wide spread of COVID 19 is its very short diameter size, ranging

between 60 and 140 nm, which renders the use of Personal Protective Equipment crucial for the

protection of health professionals[3]–[6].

On October 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) updated the PPE instructions, suggesting

the use of boot covers, inner and outer gloves, masks, face protectors, surgical hood coverall, outer

apron and face shield [7]. PPE is used as a shield between the health professionals and germs and

must be used by the hospital staff during serious situations like a pandemic. PPE are one of the

measures for the improvement of occupational health and safety [8] Special care must be taken to

avoid contamination at the disposal of it [9]. PPE can generally be described as nonpharmaceutical

barriers against the virus dissemination and one of the parameters accounted for in the Quality

Adjusted Life Year (QALY) model [10]. The QALY allows for the combined study of outcomes of any

health-related

actions

and

their

effect

on

mortality

into

a

single

indicator,

thus

establishing

a

method that enables comparisons across multiple disease areas.

The most significant government measure for the control of Covid -19 is social distancing. Social

distancing has resulted in an increase

of social media use. Social media is the modern way of

communication and allows people to interact with each other via text, videos, pictures and music.

More than 40% of the world’s population is a social media user and more than 1.5 billion are daily

active users [11]. One of most impressive use of social media is for health – related purposes [12]. A

large part of the population is informed for health issues and communicate with health professionals

through social media [13]. The best advantage of that form of contact is that it is a means of mass

communication and offers the ability to facilitate disease surveillance [12], [14].

At the same time, medical applications for 3D printing are expanding rapidly and are expected to

revolutionize health care [15]. The first 3D printers were invented from Hideo Kodama and Charles

Hulls in the early 1980s [16]. Additive technology used in various sections such as the Aerospace and

Automotive industry, military, Sports field,

architecture, toys industry and

bioengineering with

different benefits and disadvantages [17]. Since then, different 3D printing methods have been used,

based on extrusion, powder solidification and liquid solidification, with different types of materials

as building materials [18].

The aim of the present article is to explore the relationship between social media and 3D printing, in

the context of the recent Covid-19 pandemic. We will analyze which types of Personal Protective

Equipment can be printed, and how the 3D printing users can be coordinated to achieve mass

printing volumes.

2. Methods and Materials

2.1 Overview
Two independent searches have been conducted, in order to examine the degree that social media

has affected the development and dissemination of PPE and medical equipment parts. They explore

how 3D printed designs were utilized to address the Covid-19 pandemic, as well how the QALY

model can be applied in this case to measure the effects of the use of PPE. In the first in depth

search,

social

media

was

studied

using

targeted

keywords,

while

an

official

database

was

implemented and the QALY model was applied.

2.2 Social Media and 3D printing of PPE
Since Covid – 19 appeared in the Wuhan district in China, several drawings of PPE were shared

between

social

media

users,

3D

community

and

individual

citizens.

A

specialized

social

media

software (Awario) was recruited for gathering information about content which refers to Covid-19,

3D printing and PPE. Targeted queries were performed on popular social media such as Facebook,

Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Reddit and also on News/Blogs and the Web in general. The searches

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.27.20081372; this version posted June 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

were conducted between January 1, 2020 through April 14, 2020. The results were further examined

for details on the representative designs of PPEs.

The search strategy consisted of using two generic lists of terms with one specific keyword. The first

keyword set refers to the

different names of

the novel coronavirus and will be referred

to as

Keywords Set 1 (KS1), with the following syntax:

“Covid OR Covid 19 OR Coronavirus OR Covid_19 OR Covid-19 OR SARS-CoV-2”,

The general Keywords Set 2 (KS2) comprised of terms which correlate to 3D printing technology and

have the following Boolean syntax:

“Design” OR “3D” OR “Additive Technology” OR “3D printing” OR “Print”

The specific keyword is related to the PPEs and specific medical equipment, which for this study are

“PPE”,

“Personal

Protective

Equipment”,

“Face

Shield”,

“Goggles”,

“Gloves”,

“Boots”,

“Surgical

Hood”, “Valves”, “Ventilator” and “Respirator”.

The

syntax

of

the

queries

that

were

submitted

in

the

social

media

listening

software

has

the

following format:

“KS1” AND “KS2” AND “X”,

where X is one of the specific keywords mentioned. For example, when looking into which social

media post includes the keywords Covid (or similar)” and 3D printing (or similar) and PPE, the

following query syntax “KS1” AND “KS2” AND “PPE” was used.

2.3.PPE and QALY

There are two major parameters that have been studied, the life expectancy of health professionals

and the average life expectancy until the death of someone who became ill with Covid - 19 which

suggests that hygiene rules or Personal Protective Equipment have not been used or are being

misused. Data on life expectancy were obtained from WHO and OECD, while the calculation of the

average lifespan was researched in the scientific databases PubMed and Scopus with the keywords

“Symptoms” AND “Death” AND “Covid” AND “Days”

[19], [20]. The results of the

search were

analyzed and summarized in the next section.

3. Results

Table 1 provides the results from the social media listening software. The first three columns are

comprised by the aforementioned Keyword sets used in the query, the columns 4 -10 are the social

media and web sources, while column 11 contains the result of how many users in the social media

have impacted the query. For example, for the query Face Shield AND KS1 AND KS2, 3.1Million users

reacted (like, share, post, etc.) in the Social Media. The first line presents the results for the query of

KS1 which refers to the different expressions of the novel coronavirus. More than 7 billion users

reacted in the social media, web, blogs and news website for the mentioned timeframe. 3.9 million

and 4.2 million users reacted when using the KS1, KS2 and the keywords PPE or “Personal Protective

Equipment” respectively. For each PPE the number of the users varied between 50.6K to 9.1M, while

for valves and ventilators the numbers ranged between 1.4 M and 3.1M. The bolded percentages

indicate the highest percentages in Social Media, Blogs or Web appearance on listening results.

Fig. 1 illustrates the results described in Table 1. Goggles, Gloves, boots and surgical hoods have the

lowest resonance in social media and web, in contrast to respirators and face shields (9100 K and

3100K users respectively used combinations of keywords). Ventilators and valves are also prominent

in the results. Fig 2 is a graphical representation of table 1 results where each combination of

keywords is presented in relation to the percentage of appearances in the corresponding social

media or web. In many cases, zero results were returned, while in most of the cases with high

percentages, those were found through websites and blogs.

Table 2 shows which of the WHO proposed PP equipment are printable with personal or university

laboratory 3D printers. The third column of the table shows whether they can be sterilized while the

fourth column shows the number of the different designs appeared in Social Media. 109 different

designs of face masks (similar in many cases) were proposed in order to help the health workers

avoid exposure. More than 30 designs were proposed for respirators, two designs for goggles, while

there were not any design for boot covers.

showed that life expectancy for men is 77.7 years while for women it is 83.1 years. By the time of

this study, more than 200 healthcare professionals have died from the novel coronavirus disease

[21]. 29% were physicians in the USA, with ages ranging between 56 – 65 years old and 17% were

over 66 years old, while in Europe 38% of healthcare professionals were older than 55 years old [22],

4. Discussion

In

this

study,

the

relationship

between

the

epidemic,

the

social

media

and

the

use

of

three-

dimensional printing is presented. The ultimate goal of the article is to highlight the use of Social

Media and additive technology in general from common users, to address the lack of basic personal

protective equipment or even parts of machinery used by health professionals. The QALY model was

employed to illustrate the necessity of PPE use.

More than 5000 scientific articles, for the role of social media during different crisis types (terrorist

attacks, hurricanes, tsunamis, earthquakes, etc.) appear in scientific databases (Scopus, PubMed and

Google Scholar). In many cases, social media can operate as a crisis platform to generate community

crisis maps [24], [25]. There are four types of connection between the users of social media during a

crisis: i) the authorities communicate with citizens (statements, information, instructions, etc.), ii)

authorities communicate with other authorities for an inter-organizational crisis management, iii)

citizens to citizens (photographs, information, communities) and iv) the citizens communicate with

authorities [26].

As was expected, social distancing due to Covid – 19 resulted in an increase in social media use.

Only in March 11, 2020, more than 19 million mentions related to the new coronavirus. In general,

social media are used for communication between citizens or simply to kill time and to reduce

distancing. On the other hand, healthcare organizations like WHO used social media to provide

information and rules of hygiene to battle Covid – 19. Almost all platforms set at the main page a

joint statement for the fight of the pandemic [27].

The spread of Covid – 19 in the global community, in a short period of time, has resulted in the

rapid depletion of PPE. Risk to health or the danger of accident of professional health workers can

be minimized with the use of PPE [28]. The choice of the appropriate PPE must be done according to

the degree of exposure in gems, the material of PPE and the ergonomics of it [29]. Many healthcare

professionals, from different countries use social media to express the lack of respirators, gowns and

face masks [30]–[32]. WHO also uses social media to ask from government and industry to increase

the manufacturing process of PPE by 40% [33].

The interaction between authorities and other authorities, as well as authorities and citizens and

vice versa was as expected. The reaction was impressive between the citizens, who used social

media to tackle the shortage of PPE and to help the doctors and nurses during the pandemic.

Worldwide, social media groups exchanged ideas, drawings, schematics and technical instructions, in

order to produce face shields, reusable respirators, ventilators and other PPE [34]. One of the most

important actions of social media users is the use of 3D printing technology to produce specific PPE.

Social

networks have

the

potential

to

combine

both information

from

the

official

sources and

popular information from citizens in a short period of time, making them a valuable tool in crisis

management

[35].

Previous

that

in

times

of

citizens

seem

to

be

more

cooperative and better able to respond to authorities’ instructions via social media [36]. The main

advantage

of

using

these

tools,

is

the

dynamic

capability

they

provide

to

disseminate

the

information [37]. Unfortunately, the use of media has not only advantages, but also disadvantages,

such as unreliability of the information, and inefficiency and dispersal of panic [13], [38]. At the time

of

pandemic,

the

rose

by

20%,

communicating

information for the virus spread and for the shortages of PPE [39]. This information has motivated

the global community to look for possible solutions to these problems. The formulation of relevant

groups was immediate, and designs for the possible solutions were placed in digital repositories,

where the main technology used is 3D printing.

It is not the first time that 3D printing and additive technology in general has been used to

provide solutions in the field of medicine and biomechanics. Various technologies and materials

have been used to print surgical instruments, dentures, organ dummies, etc.[18]. Only in the United

Stated of America, there is an estimated amount of 444.000 printers, then the United Kingdom has

more than 168.000 printers, while Germany occupies the 3

rd

place in the world [40], [41]. It is the

first time that the community of 3d printer home users has come together and mass-produced PPE.

More than 180.000 users worldwide can produce up to 6 face shields in 10 hours each, depending

on the capabilities of printers and the design. Assuming that a country like Greece has about 500

printers, then in one day more than 6.000 face shields can be produced, enough to equip doctors,

nurses, rescuers, staff working with patients in general, in a short period of time.

In our study, the queries that included the general terms PPE and Personal Protective Equipment

show the most results in user response, as expected, because they concern general fields and not

individual PPE. In most cases, the largest percentage is due to the impact of social media users on

news / blogs and WEB, due to the fact that social media groups display their products/results on

news websites. Proof that the teams were organized through social media is that in the PPEs that

can be printed (Face Shields, Respirator but also Valves and ventilators) show increased percentages

on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, while in the rest they are zero.

Although several designs have been developed for 3D printing, the biggest concern is whether all of

them can be used. Some of these designs have been approved by NIH and FDA. Particular attention

should be paid to the materials used for their production, but also to the way they are used so as not

to endanger human lives. The American Society of Anesthesiologists made a statement about the

possibility of

having multiple patients

per ventilator.

Characteristically, they

state

a number

of

reasons why it is impossible to do so, for example, "Volumes would go to the most compliant lung

segments. Positive end - expiratory pressure, which is of critical importance in these patients, would

be impossible to manage." [42]. For such types of reasons, even after about three months from the

beginning of the pandemic, licenses for the manufacture of respirators by individuals in the vast

majority, have not been issued

In figure 5 a proposed process used before 3D printing is illustrated. The need for PPE and

medical supplies triggers the beginning of the process. Individuals are usually searching for designs

and solutions for the problems concerning the local community through social media. Accordingly,

they should verify whether the final product has been approved by the competent authorities. In

case the proposed design lacks a license, a similar design that has the relevant license should be

selected. Following, the prototype is printed and inspected from the local healthcare professionals

for micro adjustment, if necessary. Finally, if all the previous steps are completed, the product can

be printed in mass quantities.

The QALY allows for the combined study of outcomes of any health-related actions and their

effect on mortality into a single indicator, thus establishing a method that enables comparisons

across multiple disease areas. Throughout their life, people have different health states, which are

weighted based on the preassigned utility ranks. The QALY model was applied as shown in figure 4,

taking into account that one of the main reasons of viral infection affecting the respiratory system is

the

non-usage

or

poor

application

of

protective

equipment

as

well

as

the

fact

that

health

professionals are more exposed and subsequently more likely to get infected. Patients using PPE

gained quality of life compared to health worker professionals from Europe or US, without the usage

of PPEs.

5. Conclusion

This study examined the way individual social media users and 3D printer owners tackle the PPE

shortage during a pandemic. Social media influences the problem in multiple levels: Firstly, they

highlight the problem, in this context the lack of PPEs, secondly they encourage and promote the

formation of task forces/teams from the general population with a relevant interest, thirdly they

provide the means for exchanging information and technology and finally they can identify the

number of required 3D printers in a local, national, or even international level needed to achieve the

task.

At the same time the role of PPE as necessary equipment for health professionals is fundamental.

The QALY model was employed to show the importance and effect of using personal equipment on

life quality and expectancy. During the recent coronavirus pandemic, the world faced a serious

shortage of PPE. Individuals and Universities co-ordinated their action using web networking and

social media in order to produce around 150 3D printable designs of PPE that got developed and

distributed. Social networking and 3D printing combined can be seen as a new tool for tackling

pandemic emergency situations.
