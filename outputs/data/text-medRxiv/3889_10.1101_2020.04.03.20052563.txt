Summary box:
“What is already known on this subject?”
To the best of the authors no similar evidence, of the effect of malarial transmission
on the COVID-19 global distribution is known. The effect of the Bacille Calmette
Guérin (BCG) vaccine on modifying the human immune system has been reported
before and is postulated to protective against certain viral infections like Influenza A
(H1N1) and herpes virus.
“What this study adds?”
This study finds that COVID-19 incidence, worldwide is less in countries, which are
malaria-endemic. In the European and American countries, increased BCG coverage
may have some mortality advantage against COVID-19. The case fatality rate was
related to malaria incidence, however, in a complex way. This could be a window into
the changing landscape of human immune system as we progress to eliminate
parasitic disease with time or this could be due to long-term protective body level of
anti-malarials like chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in countries with higher
malaria incidence rate.

Abstract:
Background: COVID-19 (Corona virus Disease-2019) is a new public health
emergency and is a pandemic currently. Incidence and mortality of COVID-19 vary in
different geographical areas. In this study we aimed to analyse the relationship
between malaria transmission and BCG vaccination with COVID-19 incidence in the
world map.
Materials and methods: We collected malaria cases data (World Health
Organisation (WHO), 2018), worldwide COVID-19 cases and mortality data
(European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) and data on BCG vaccination.
COVID-19 incidence and mortality was compared.
Findings: Data on 5316978938 persons from 166 countries were analysed. Malaria
incidence rate was negatively correlated with COVID-19 incidence rate (correlation
coefficient = -0.513, p<0.001). Malaria free countries had significantly higher number
of COVID-19 cases compared to malaria endemic countries. In Europe and Americas,
countries, which have higher BCG vaccination coverage, had significantly less
mortality per thousand population compared to those with low BCG coverage
(median 0.0002 (0-0.0005) vs 0.0029 (0.0002-0.0177), p=0.017). The case fatality
ratio of COVID-19 was related nonlinearly to the malaria incidence.
Conclusions: The results suggest the changing human immune system as we progress
to eliminate parasitic diseases with time. Chloroquine exposure in malaria endemic
zones might have a protective effect.

Introduction
The COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019) is a public health emergency of
international concern and currently is a pandemic. Approximately 15% of patients
suffer from severe form of the disease.1 As of this time there is no known specific,
effective and evidence based treatment.
We noted that COVID-19 transmission and mortality are apparently higher in the
United States and European countries in contrast to malaria and other infectious
diseases endemic regions like South East Asian and African countries.
The Bacille Calmette Guérin (BCG) vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine against
tuberculosis and apart from providing some protection against development of severe
forms of tuberculosis it has been shown to have significant immunomodulatory action
and protection against certain viral infections like respiratory syncytial virus,
Influenza A (H1N1) and herpes virus.2
The interaction between exposure to malaria infection and BCG vaccination with
incidence of COVID-19 has not been explored.
So, in the absence of any such data, we aimed to analyse the hypothesis regarding the
relationship between malaria incidence and BCG coverage with COVID-19 incidence
in the world map.
Materials and methods:
For this cross sectional study, we collected malaria cases and mortality data (2018)
from the World Health Organisation (WHO),3 and worldwide COVID-19 cases and
mortality data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control website.4
Data on BCG vaccination coverage was accessed from the WHO website and other
online sources.5, 6 Population data was confirmed from the world population website.7
Only autochthonous malaria cases were considered and migrant cases were not

considered. All data were compiled on an excel sheet and then transferred to SPSS
ver. 21.
Statistical analysis: Malaria and COVID-19 incidence rate was calculated as per
thousand of population. Deviation from normal distribution was tested with ShapiroWilk test. All continuous data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or
median (interquartile range, IQR) as appropriate and discrete data as fraction
(percentage). As a first step non-parametric correlation (Kendall’s Tau) was
calculated between malaria incidence and mortality with COVID-19 incidence. Then
COVID-19 incidence was compared between countries, which are malaria free or not.
Similar comparisons were made with BCG vaccination coverage. Mortality of
COVID-19 was assessed as per thousand-population in each country. Association of
mortality from COVID-19 was tested against malaria incidence and BCG coverage.
To correct for false inflation of mortality rate, mortality analysis was restricted to only
those countries reporting more than 100 COVID-19 cases. Comparison of means was
done with Mann Whitney U test. A binary logistic regression was run with COVID19 incidence as dependent variable and the following two variables: malaria free
country and BCG vaccination coverage ≤95%. Analysis of incidence and mortality of
COVID-19 with malaria incidence and BCG coverage was done separately for
different geographical location of the countries. Finally, case fatality rate of COVID19 was analysed in comparison to malaria incidence with non-linear regression.
Results:
Overall data on 5316978938 persons from 166 countries were extracted. Number of
malaria cases was 228435738 and number of malaria deaths was 405255. Number of
malaria free countries was 81. Number of COVID-19 cases was 412637 and number
of COVID-19 deaths was 18559. The median incidence of COVID-19 per thousand

populations per country was 0.009 (IQR: 0.0007-0.12) and the median mortality per
thousand populations per country was 0.0003 (IQR: 0-0.0018). The COVID-19
incidence was highest in the European/American countries (0.0974, IQR: 0.024-0.33)
followed by Asian/Australasian countries (0.0084, IQR: 0.0005-0.077) followed by
African countries (0.0015, IQR: 0.0002-0.0045) and the difference was statistically
significant (p<0.001). Median case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 1.68% (IQR: 0.396.5).
Data on BCG vaccination coverage was available from 148 countries. Number of
countries achieving BCG vaccination coverage of >95% was 53 (31.9%). BCG
vaccination coverage of >95% was present in 40.3% of European or American
countries (29/72), 25% of African countries (11/44) and 40.6% of Asian/Australasian
countries (13/32).
Median malaria cases per 1000 population were 0.01 (IQR: 0 to 33). Number of
malaria free countries was 81 (48.8%). Number of malaria free countries was
significantly higher in the European/American continents (75.9%, 66/87) compared to
the African (2.3%, 1/44) or Asian/Australasian (40%, 14/35) countries (p<0.001).
Malaria incidence rate was negatively correlated with COVID-19 incidence rate (tau
= -0.513, p<0.001) Malaria mortality rare was also negatively correlated with
COVID-19 incidence rate (tau= -0.335, p<0.001).
Both total number of COVID-19 cases (7 (IQR 2-89) vs. 249 (86-1492) respectively,
p<0.001) and COVID-19 incidence (0.0008 (IQR 0.0001-0.006) vs. 0.09 (IQR: 0.020.34) respectively, p<0.001) was lower in countries where malaria occurred versus
malaria free countries. Although COVID-19 incidence (0.02 (IQR 0.003-0.11) vs.
0.003 (IQR: 0.0002-0.06) respectively, p=0.01) was significantly higher in countries
with >95% BCG coverage compared to countries with ≤95% BCG coverage, total

number of COVID-19 cases per country were similar (102 (IQR: 26-469) vs 42 (IQR
3-562) p=0.25). The COVID-19 mortality rate was higher in malaria free countries
(Table 1).
In multivariate binary logistic regression (Table 2) the chance of encountering higher
number of COVID-19 cases was higher in malaria free countries (OR: 16.76, 95% CI:
7.3-38.5, p<0.001) only.
Next we analysed the effect of BCG coverage and malaria incidence with respect to
geographic location of the countries (Table 3). In European and American countries,
countries with >95% BCG coverage had lower COVID-19 mortality compared to
countries with ≤95% coverage (respectively, 0.0002 (IQR 0-0.0005) vs 0.0029 (IQR:
0.0002-0.0177), p=0.017). However in African, Asian and Australasian countries
increased BCG coverage was associated with increased COVID-19 incidence and
numerically increased mortality. In all geographic locales malaria-free countries had
higher COVID-19 incidence.
In non-linear regression of COVID-19 case fatality was compared to malaria
incidence in each countries and a quartic equation (R squared=0.527) was the best fit
as follows: COVID-19 case fatality = -0.033 + 7.9*(malaria incidence) 0.709*(malaria incidence)^2

+ 0.022*(malaria incidence)^3-0.0002*(malaria

incidence)^4. Linear regression with transformed malaria incidence as independent
variable showed significant association with COVID-19 case fatality (B=0.235, 95%
CI: 0.026-0.444, p=0.029, variance inflation factor=1.0).
Discussion:
The COVID-19 is a new pandemic. We empirically observed that malaria free
countries have a higher incidence of COVID-19 among different countries. Currently
we can offer no exact explanation of our findings. Such strong statistical association

as observed is unlikely to be a chance association. Malarial transmission may give
some protection against COVID-19. One explanation may be community level use of
drugs such as chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in malaria-endemic countries and
relative non-use of them in malaria-free countries. Interestingly chloroquine has been
shown to be effective in reduction of viral replications including COVID-19.8,9
Hydroxychloroquine has some immunomodulatory action and after the outbreak,
studies have shown some activity of this drug.10 Viral inhibition from possibly higher
blood level in malaria-endemic countries is one postulation. The second possible
mechanism seems to be immunological. With increasing effort to eliminate and
finally eradicate malaria long-term changes may occur in the human immune system.
Possible link between filarial elimination and increased autoimmunity has previously
been reported.11 Whether elimination of parasites leads to permanent changes in the
human immune system should be investigated.
Prior BCG vaccination had an apparent paradoxical effect. In the overall analysis
lower BCG coverage was associated with lower number of COVID-19 cases.
However this effect is probably related to geographic locale of the countries. In
European and American countries, where natural tubercular infection rate was low,
higher BCG coverage was associated with decreased COVID-19 mortality. In these
countries higher BCG coverage was also associated with numerically lower COVID19 incidence. On the other hand, in the African, Asian and Australasian continent,
where natural TB incidence is higher, increased BCG coverage appeared to have
facilitated COVID-19 infection spread and mortality. Whether, after adequate control
of spread of tuberculosis, the immunmodulatory effect of continued BCG vaccination,
may help the human immune system to thwart future viral epidemics like the current
COVID-19, is an open and interesting question.

The relationship of case fatality rate of COVID-19 with malaria incidence was
complex and a quartic equation was needed for adequate modeling. In the equation
the even powers have negative weights and the odd powers have positive weights.
Thus in areas of non-zero low to very low malaria incidence, the effect of higher
powers shall be overwhelmed by the linear terms and an increased COVID-19 case
fatality is seen. On the other hand in malaria-endemic countries the reverse is
observed.
There are some limitations in this study. Many other parasitic diseases could have
been screened, which however due to lack of worldwide data could not be done.
Many factors like underreporting of cases might underwhelm this report.
Socioeconomics is an important factor, which is missing from the current analysis.
To summarize, malaria free countries, worldwide, are experiencing higher burden of
COVID-19 pandemic. Among the western countries, those, which have continued
high BCG vaccination coverage, have an apparent mortality benefit from COVID-19
infection. However, among the African, Asian and Australasian countries, continued
high-level BCG vaccination was associated with increased incidence of and mortality
from the COVID-19 infection. From the COVID-19 case fatality analysis a lower
mortality could be expected in malaria-endemic countries.
