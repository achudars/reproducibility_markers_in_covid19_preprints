Abstract

22

To understand the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients we

23

simultaneously assessed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, live infectious virus in the

24

airways, and virus-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies in sera in 36 hospitalized COVID-

25

19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 could be cultured from four patients, all with low or undetectable

26

antibody response. Our data suggests that the level of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may correlate

27

to risk for shedding live SARS-CoV-2 virus in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Introduction

30

It is important to better understand the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

31

(SARS-CoV-2) transmission from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Many

32

studies report PCR-detectable SARS-CoV-2-RNA in the airways over time (1-3), but little has

33

been reported on shedding of infectious viruses from the airways in hospitalized COVID-19

34

patients. In the setting of mild COVID-19 infection, shedding of infectious virus has been

35

described during the first week of symptoms (4). No viable virus could be isolated after 8 days,

36

coinciding with the appearance of detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (5). In a larger study,

37

with patients ranging from asymptomatic to severe, SARS-CoV-2 culture-positive airway

38

samples declined to 6% at day 10 (6). In a cohort with 129 severely ill COVID-19 patients, the

39

median duration of shedding of infectious virus was 8 days after symptom onset, with infectious

40

virus found up to 20 days after symptom onset (7). Determinants for the detection of infectious

41

SARS-CoV-2 were either viral loads above 7 log10 RNA copies/mL in airways or neutralizing

42

antibody titres below 20 in sera (7). Even if there is one case report on a patient with SARS-

43

CoV-2 shedding for 18 days even after seroconversion at day 10 (8), antibodies may be of

44

importance in judging contagiousness.

45

The aim of our study was to evaluate if infectious SARS-CoV-2 could be cultured from

46

nasopharyngeal and sputum samples in hospitalized patients with symptoms exceeding 8 days

47

and to evaluate if the SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses in serum correlated with

48

shedding of infectious virus.

Results

53

Thirty-six COVID-19 patients were enrolled in this study, the majority were men (n=25, 69%),

54

and the median age was 60.5 years (range 25-77 years) (Table 1). The majority of the patients

55

had an underlying risk factor for severe COVID-19 infection (Table 1) (9). Thirty-three (92%)

56

patients received supplemental oxygen treatment. Fourteen (39%) patients were treated in the

57

intensive care unit, of which 9 were treated with mechanical ventilation. Fourteen patients had

58

received immunomodulatory treatment, and four had received remdesivir, prior to inclusion in

59

the study (Table 1).

60

Samples from the patients were collected at a median of 18 days (range 9-53 days) after self-

61

reported onset of symptoms, and at a median of 8 days (range 1-44 days) after their positive

62

diagnostic sample (Table 1).

63

Twenty-three (64%) patients had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected by PCR in airway samples, of

64

which 14 were positive in nasopharynx and 18 in sputum (Supplementary Table 1).

65

SARS-CoV-2 could be cultured from airway samples in four patients (11% of all patients,

66

17.3% of PCR-positive patients) (Table 2). All four patients had underlying diseases potentially

67

increasing the risk of severe COVID-19 (9).Three of the patients had been symptomatic for 9-

68

11 days before sampling. The fourth patient, with a haematological malignancy and leukopenia

69

during hospitalization, still had infectious SARS-CoV-2 on day 16 after onset of symptoms.

70

Three (8.3%) patients had detectable but low levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood

71

(Supplementary Table 1), however, none of the patients were culture positive for SARS-CoV-

72

2 in the respiratory samples.

73

All but two patients had detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG)

74

in serum, with titers ranging from 1:40 to 1:2560. Neutralizing antibodies towards SARS-CoV-

75

2 were detected in 33 of the 36 patients (Supplementary Table 1). The positive control, sampled

76

at day 5 after onset of symptoms, had no detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, but was

77

positive for infectious virus in the airways (data not shown).

78

There was a strong positive correlation between total SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG titers and

79

neutralizing antibody titers (Spearman’s correlation: rs = 0.689, p < 0.001) (Figure 1A).

80

Patients sampled earlier after symptom onset, showed a variation in IgG titers and neutralizing

81

antibodies (Figure 1B and Supplementary Table 1). Patients with IF titers equal to or below

82

1:40 either displayed no detectable, or low levels of neutralizing antibodies (Supplementary

83

Table 1). Whereas, the distribution of the levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and neutralizing antibody

84

titers within the patients are similar, and with a general higher level of antibodies and

85

neutralizing titer in patients sampled during later times (Figure 1B), all four patients that

86

shedded infectious SARS-CoV-2 had low or no detectable IgG titers and neutralizing antibody

87

titers (Table 2 and Table 3).

89

Discussion

90

Viable SARS-CoV-2 were isolated from four patients. We could not detect viable SARS-CoV-

91

2 virus from patients with SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG titers above 1:40, or with neutralizing

92

antibodies titers above 1:10. Seroconversion, with detectable neutralizing antibodies, was

93

observed in all 32 patients from whom no viable SARS-CoV-2 virus could be isolated from the

94

respiratory tract. In addition, no infectious virus could be isolated from the patients that were

95

SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR negative.

96

In patients with a shorter symptom duration, there was a large variation in total specific IgG

97

and neutralizing antibody titers. Three of the culture-positive patients were sampled within 11

98

days after the onset of symptoms. However, the fourth patient with culturable SARS-CoV-2,

99

an immunocompromised patient, was sampled at day 16 after the onset of symptoms, showing

100

that infectious virus can be shed rather late during COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients.

101

Similar to previous reports (7), our data suggest that individuals with low, or no, levels of

102

neutralizing antibodies and total IgG antibodies have an increased risk of shedding live virus.

103

Prior knowledge of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) present

104

similar data, where SARS-CoV-1 could be isolated during the first 2 weeks, but not after day

105

22, of illness (10). However, to better understand the correlation between virus shedding and

106

serological response in COVID-19 patients, larger studies need to be performed.

107

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends at least 10 days after symptom onset plus

108

an additional 3 days without fever and respiratory symptoms, before releasing COVID-19

109

patients from isolation (11). Our data indicate that infectious SARS-CoV-2 could not be

110

detected in the airways after day 14 after symptom onset despite detectable viral RNA by PCR

111

unless immunocompromised patients. The latter finding is in concordance with a previous study

112

also detecting viable viruses long after symptom onset in immunocompromised patients (12).

113

Serological assay for SARS-CoV-2 may provide additional guidance in judging if a hospitalized

114

patient may be shedding infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus, especially in the setting of

115

immunocompromised COVID-19 patients.

symptoms was included as a positive control for virus shedding. Samples for culture and SARS-

124

CoV-2 real time-PCR (RT-PCR) were collected from nasopharynx (all patients), and, when

125

possible, sputum (30 patients). Serum were collected from all patients for SARS-CoV-2 RT-

128

Ethical statement

129

The study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority, all relevant regulations for

130

work with human participants were complied with, and patient samples were obtained

131

according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients included in the study provided written

132

informed consent.

133
134

RT-PCR

135

SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR were performed on respiratory samples and in serum. RT-PCR targeting

136

the envelope(E)- and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (rdrp)-genes were used to detect the

137

presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (13).

138
139

Isolation of live SARS-CoV-2 from patient material

140

Virus isolation was carried out at a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratory. For the virus cultures,

141

100 µL sample from nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and 100 µL tracheal secretion or sputum

142

collected from a total of 37 patients, the positive control patient included, were inoculated in

143

duplicate on Vero-E6 cells. Inoculation was carried out for 1.5 h at 37 °C and 5 % CO2 and

144

medium (Dulbecco`s Modified Eagle`s Medium, DMEM) supplemented with 5 % fetal bovine

mM L-glutamine, 20 mM HEPES) were then added. Cells were continuously monitored for

147

cytopathic effect (CPE). After 10 days the cultures were harvested and supernatants were

148

analyzed with RT-PCR specific for the SARS-CoV-2 E-gene and (rdrp)-gene (13).

150

Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2

151

All primary clinical samples and samples from positive virus cultures were sequenced in order

152

to exclude contamination. Sequencing libraries were constructed using the Ion AmpliSeq

153

SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). cDNA was synthesized

154

from SARS-CoV-2 RNA using SuperScript IV VILO Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific,

155

MA, USA) and incubated at 25 ℃ for 10 min, 50 ℃ for 10 min and 85 ℃ for 5 min. Automated

156

library preparation and amplification was performed on an Ion Chef instrument with AmpliSeq

157

Chef reagents and specific SARS-CoV-2 primers (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA).

158

Libraries were quantified with TaqMan-based qPCR, using custom primers and probe targeting

159

the flanking A- and P-adapters of the constructed libraries (Integrated DNA Technologies, IA,

160

USA). The qPCR protocol was initiated by a holding stage at 95 ℃ for 20 s, followed by 40

161

cycles of 95 ℃ for 1 s and 60 ℃ for 20 s. Libraries were normalized to a final concentration of

162

35 pM and prepared for sequencing with the Ion 540 Kit-Chef (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA,

163

USA) for 200 base-pair reads. Sequencing was performed on an Ion GeneStudio S5 Sequencing

164

System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). Raw reads were trimmed and filtered using

165

default parameters, then analyzed with the Ion Torrent Suite software plugin coverageAnalysis,

166

where an average read coverage of 20x for every amplicon of a sample was required to pass

167

quality control. Variant calling against the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence (NC_045512.2)

168

was performed by the Ion Torrent Suite software plugin variantCaller.

170

Immunofluorescence assay (IFA)

171

IFA was performed as previously described (13). Briefly, SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells

172

mixed with uninfected Vero cells were used as target cells. Serum samples were heat-

173

inactivated at 56˚C for 30 minutes prior to analysis and two-fold serially diluted starting at 1:20.

174

The titer of IgG in each serum sample was determined by the inverted dilution factor value for

175

the highest dilution with positive staining.

176
177

Micro-neutralization assay

178

IFA was performed as previously described (9). Heat inactivated (56˚C for 30 minutes) serum

179

were diluted in a two-fold dilution serie starting from 1:10. Each sample was prepared in

180

duplicates. Each dilution was mixed with an equal volume of 4000 TCID50/ml SARS-CoV-2

181

(60 µl serum plus 60 µl virus). After incubation, 100 µL of the mixtures were added to Vero

182

E6 cells seeded on 96-well plates and incubated at 37 °C 5% CO2. Four days later the cells were

183

inspected for signs of cytopathic effect (CPE) by optical microscopy. Each well was scored as

184

either 'neutralizing' if less than 50% of the cell layer showed signs of CPE, or 'non-neutralizing'

185

if ≥50% CPE was observed.
