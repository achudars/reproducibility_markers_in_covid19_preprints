Abstract:
Stress and anxiety have shown to be indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, therefore
managing stress becomes essential. One of the most affected populations by the pandemic
are healthcare professionals. Thus, it is paramount to understand and categorize their
perceived levels of stress, as it can be a detonating factor leading to mental illness. In our
study, we used a machine learning prediction model to help measure perceived stress; a
C5.0 decision tree algorithm was used to analyze and classify datasets obtained from
healthcare professionals of the northeast region of Mexico. Our analysis showed that 6 out
of 102 instances were incorrectly classified. Missing two cases for mild, three for moderate
and 1 for severe (accuracy of 94.1%), statistical correlation analysis was performed to
ensure integrity of the method, in addition we concluded that severe stress cases can be
related mostly to high levels of Xenophobia and Compulsive stress.

Introduction
As the deadly coronavirus disease COVID-19 continues to spread globally medical and
allied healthcare professionals have become one of the most highly affected sectors by this
disease1–3. Particularly in developing democracies, such is the case of Mexico, the public
health system has become engulfed by the overwhelming levels of stress4,5 In addition, the
situation becomes even more taxing for attending personnel as they not only deal with the
burdened system6, but they must also deal with the enemy upfront; It is here, where they too
can become prey to the disease7. Recent reports showed for the period spanning from the
end of February to the end of August 97,632 health-care professionals became infected with
over 1300 more deaths reported over any other country8. What is even more burdensome is
the fact that Mexico continues atop of all Latin-America countries in infection-to-death rate
(>10%)9.
According to the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), Mexico has the highest
number of healthcare workers with COVID-19 in Latin America10. Up to October 25th 2020,
the amount of healthcare professionals affected by COVID-19, as reported by the National
health ministry, by comparison to other healthcare professionals in Mexico, medical doctors
rank highest in mortality vs their nursing or other allied healthcare professional counterparts.
Recent reports show that both physicians and nurses have similar levels of burnout and
emotional fatigue. Physicians tend to work in a more independent manner, this along with
their long shift hours, high-sense of duty, work ethics, and the fact they partake multiple jobs,
normally of low wages, becomes a source of additional stress8. Counter, nursing staff work
in groups and develop higher social support11,12. Recent reports have shown that resilience
level in nurses seem to correlate with lower anxiety, this is part of a well-developed social
support system in which nursing professionals provide emotional help and support in order
to uplift the communal spirit even under overwhelming circumstances13.
During the period of August 16th up to November 3rd, the spreading of the disease
amongst physicians grew significantly along the passing months, reporting 140,196
confirmed cases, 31,870 classified as “possible” COVID-19 and 222,372 discarded cases,

with 1,884 COVID-19 confirmed deaths and up to 198 COVID-19 suspected deaths, with an
active case count of 3362. Interestingly, active cases decreased from the initial count of
4743 in the period of August, to 3362, nonetheless in November the number of suspected
and confirmed COVID-19 death rate showed an increase14 (Figure 1). This is of particular
interest when we take into account stress, as it may be a trigger to determine a potential
severe outcome of the disease.
Recent developments in computational modeling have led to the ever-evolving field
of artificial intelligence which, when combined with neuro- and behavioral- science, has
created the new field of computational psychiatry15,16. Nowadays Machine Learning and
Artificial Intelligence are promising technology used by various healthcare providers as they
result in better scale-up, speed-up processing power, reliability which translates into the
strengthening of the performance of the clinical team17. Therefore, there’s has been an
expected trend in using these techniques in order to better understand and fight against the
pandemic. Computational psychiatry helps to model and understand underlying mental
illness, when this is driven forward with “machine learning” we can potentially predict
behavioral patterns, improve classification and assist the physician to provide a faster and
personalized medical attention.
Well-known machine learning algorithms are decision trees, commonly used for
establishing classification systems based on multiple variables for a target feature18.
Typically, with the use of this method, it is possible to classify a population into branch-like
segments that generate an inverted tree18,19. The algorithm can efficiently deal with large,
complicated datasets without imposing a complicated parametric structure19. Researchers
have reported the use of these types of algorithms for applications in the study of behavioral
and mental health20. Thus, it is possible to use this technique to help define different clinical
paths, classify subgroups of patients for different diagnostic tests, treatment strategies, and
assessment of mental health-related conditions21,22.

A common strategy used for data analytics is the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data
Mining methodology (CRISP-DM), for which six steps are defined for data-based knowledge
projects. This strategy begins with a phase where problems from the scenario are stated and
objectives defined (Business Understanding), followed by a stage where data insights are
obtained (Data Understanding). Next, a final dataset for study is defined and analyzed (Data
Preparation), results from the data preparation analysis would allow to define the algorithm
over which a model would be generated (Modeling) once the model is generated a
performance evaluation would be required in order to confirm if it fulfills the proposed
objectives (Evaluation), if the goal for which the modeling is achieved, it can be implemented
for the purpose for which it was proposed29.
This work is based on previously reported adapted COVID-19 stress scales data1.
The analysis method was adapted from CRISP-DM, in the same amount of stages and
sequence, as shown in Figure 4. An initial Data Structure study was done from the data
analytics scope in order to consider the type of variables that compose the stress scales.
Also, to define the goal for the study as a model that contributes in the understanding of
mental illness in health care workers during the COVID-19 outbreak. Next, a Data Validation
analysis that considered statistical test to confirm relations between variables from the
scales and classification outcomes from raw data, and also, to confirm internal consistency.
This was followed by a Data Distribution analysis to study stress components that could be
used for model selection and interpretation. A Decision tree model was selected in order to
study the relations and possible classifications routes for stress level according data from its
respective scales. Given the clinical component of the study, a performance analysis based
on accuracy, sensitivity and specificity was carried out on the results. This allowed to
validate the obtained model and Observations and conclusions from stress scales were
made as an application of the obtained model.

The statistical analysis and computational modeling (algorithm) were done to obtain the
behavior patterns and distribution of the data. Both the statistical and algorithm analysis of
the dataset was performed in R and RStudio.
Descriptive statistical analysis.
In order to understand the structure, validate and explore data distribution, a descriptive
statistical study was carried out. The comprised obtaining measures of central tendency and
variability metrics to describe the whole-set of data with a single values, the center of
distribution and similitude30. Cronbach’s alpha was estimated considering the numerical
values from all participant responses. Presented as the index of reliability and internal
consistency31. Chi-square statistic was applied to the general classification of each
participant and each of the questions separated by the sections of the generalized stress
scale reported32.
Mathematical and computational algorithms
Following the statistical analysis that implied the first three stages of the study. A decision
tree model was developed to behave as a computational supportive scaffold for the study of
mental illness. These types of algorithms have previously been useful to study and predict
mental illness19,20. C5.0 algorithm was used to analyze and classify the stress level from the
dataset23, and for construction of decision tree algorithm23. The relation between entropy and
information gain allows for a model, that trains based on the datasets that contribute to
analyze and visually explain the route and relations of the studied variables. Excluding
features that don’t affect the outcome. Making it an efficient tool for the understanding of
illness and its severity based on measures stress features.
Following both the statistical and computational study of the dataset, performance based on
sensibility, sensitivity and accuracy was studied on the generated model33. Conclusions were

Given that each feature is based on the addition of the responses from the survey.
We considered all the values from each question and participant for the calculation of
Cronbach’s alpha. This gave a result of 0.94 which shows a good internal consistency for the
whole survey instrument and data. In addition, supplementary Table 1 shows Chi-square
tests to each question for all in order to define significance in the relationship of the
variables. Table 3 shows the result of the test for each scale area and each question and for
the cumulative adapted COVID-19 stress scales.

Most of the results from the Chi-square test show significance, except for the
following: one question from the Traumatic stress scale and four from Compulsive checking
scale. This relating dependence of the stress level classification calculated as a cumulative
result of the scales and the answers given by each participant.

The distribution for the stress level classification in healthcare personnel calculated
from the stress scales is shown Figure 2. Frequency histogram of the four severity levels of
the stress scale from the observed dataset. This variable would correspond to the target
feature in the decision tree model (Figure 3).
Both results from the Cronbach alpha and the Chi-square test, show internal
consistency of the data and validate the dependence for stress level calculation, ensuring
the dataset quality for algorithm-based analysis.
Following the descriptive statistical analysis, a decision tree model was trained with
the preprocessed dataset using the C5.0 algorithm19,23. Considering the stress level to be the
target variable. Participant profession, work area and all five cumulative stress scales areas
were used as the predictive variables in order to find any relationship between them aiming
to predict stress level. Figure 3 shows the decision tree obtained from the dataset. At the
predictive branch, a set of boxes with all four levels of stress are observed. In each box, the
extreme right bar corresponds to the severe level indicator, followed to the left by moderate,
mild and absent levels, respectively, also observed in Figure 3. Despite declaring the
features related to participant profession and work area, these variables were pruned from
the model. Table 4 shows the confusion matrix from the obtained decision tree model.
Where only 6 out of 102 instances were incorrectly classified. Missing two cases for mild
level, three for moderate and 1 for severe. All these errors were classified only in
neighboring levels, giving the model an accuracy of 94.1%.

Discussion
Our purpose was to define a statistical and computational framework algorithm to
understand stress levels in healthcare professionals due to the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic and to potentially define a tool which can be further used as a predictor of severity
of stress.
A dataset related to adapted COVID-19 stress scales as defined by DelgadoGallegos et.al., was studied with a calculated Cronbach alpha of 0.94 which shows a good
internal consistency; stress levels were calculated as a geometrical result from the addition
of five scales from the survey defined as Danger + Fear of contamination, Socioeconomic
stress, Xenophobia, Traumatic stress and Compulsive checking. Chi-square test was done
for all questions individually, looking to validate stress level calculation.

significance (p < 0.05) was found in most of the questions considering the answer of all
participants, except one question in the Traumatic scale, and four from the Compulsive
checking scale (all shown in supplementary table1), although all scales showed statistical
significance when the test was applied to the accumulated value for each of these scales, as
seen on Table 3. Thus validating, the use of the adapted COVID-19 stress scales, in a
population1,24. Recently the Mexico’s health ministry has also launched their own
questionnaires, in an effort, to correctly assess the stress levels in healthcare
professionals25. Therefore, the use of this model can be re-adapted to help in correctly
assessing and provide a faster diagnosis and opportune treatment.
From the central metrics statistical analysis, no relation was observed between
participant profession and work area, similar analysis was done for the stress scales which
showed an exception for Danger + Fear of contamination joint scale, all other areas had a
similar maximum value but with different means. Therefore, considering results from the
preprocessing stage, the dataset shows good quality, independence and internal
consistency for algorithm analysis. All 102 instances from the dataset were used to train a
decision tree model by C5.0 algorithm, where stress level was defined as the target variable,
with participant profession, work area and cumulative stress scales as predictors. The
resulting model showed an accuracy of 94%. Nonetheless, the algorithm did not find enough
information gain from the participant profession, work area, and the socioeconomic scale.
Neglecting these variables from the resulting model allows to understand that experience
and day-to-day work routine are not a factor on how healthcare professionals perceive
stress. Resilience could help explain this pattern as it is an adaptation mechanism in which a
person overtime can handle stress in overwhelming situations 13,26.
Conclusion:
Computational psychiatry states the similarity between the brain and a computer and
proposes the use of computational terminology for the study of mental illness27. Our results

show interesting data denoting hypothetical tendencies based on the purity of the resulting
branches of the decision tree, where severe stress cases can be related mostly to high
levels of Xenophobia and Compulsive stress. This considering that threshold values from the
extreme right route of the decision tree are above the 3rd quartile for both scales. In a similar
manner, absent stress level comes from the scenario of combined thresholds below the 1st
quartile from Xenophobic, Compulsive and Traumatic stress scales. It is interesting to note
that the Danger + Fear of contamination scale can be used to find both mild and moderate
cases, despite being a larger joint scale.
We believe this method could potentially define concepts on how to diagnose and
handle severe stress, contributing to mathematical informed understanding of mental illness
and computational psychiatry, thus forming a diagnostic tool to help in the assessment of
patients. In this study, we used healthcare professionals as they are one of the most affected
sectors in the pandemic28. In addition, an expansion of this method outside the pandemic
can be used to understand different stress factors and how they can interfere with
performance and social dynamics in different populations.
While this is only a fist approximation based on recent data from healthcare
professionals in the northeast part of Mexico1, the impact of applying machine learning
algorithms and computational psychiatry, can potentially help reshape the way we run global
health.

Moderate, Severe.
Figure 3. Decision tree applied into healthcare personnel stress scale level dataset. Atop
variables influencing stress are Xenophobia (Xeno) and Compulsive checking (Comp), which
leads to severe stress. Traumatic stress (Trauma) and Danger + Contamination (Dan Con)
also influenced the perception of stress. Social economical variable did not influence the
outcome of the decision tree.
