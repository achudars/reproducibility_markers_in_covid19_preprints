Abstract
Background
Routine testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the community is essential for guiding key
epidemiological decisions from the quarantine of individual patients to enrolling regional and
national preventive measures. Yet, the primary testing tool, the RT-qPCR based testing, is
notoriously known for its low sensitivity, i.e. high risk of missed detection of carriers.
Quantifying the false-negative rate (FNR) of the RT-qPCR test at the community settings
and its dependence on patient demographic and disease progression is therefore key in
designing and refining strategies for disease spread prevention.

Methods
Analyzing 843,917 test results of 521,696 patients, we identified false-negative (FN) and
true-positive (TP) results as negative and positive results preceded by a COVID-19
diagnosis and followed by a later positive test. Regression analyses were used to determine
associations of false-negative results with time of sampling after diagnosis, patient
demographics and viral loads based on RT-qPCR Ct values of the next positive tests.

Findings
The overall FNR was 22.8%, which is consistent with previous studies. Yet, this rate was
much lower at the first 5 days following diagnosis (10.7%) and only increased in later dates.
Furthermore, the FNR was strongly associated with demographics, with odds ratio of 1.74
(95% CI: 1.58-1.90) for women over men and 1.36 (95% CI: 1.34-1.39) for 10 years younger
patients. Finally, FNR was associated with viral loads (p-value 0.0005), with a difference of
1.50 (95% CI: 0.70-2.30) between the average Ct of the N gene in a positive test following a
false-negative compared to a positive test following a true-positive.

Interpretation
Our results show that in the first few days following diagnosis, when results are critical for
quarantine decisions, RT-qPCR testing is more reliable than previously reported. Yet the
reliability of the test result is reduced in later days as well as for women and younger
patients, where the viral loads are typically lower.

Introduction
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has already infected more than 45 million people
worldwide (​https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html​, October 30th, 2020​1​). A major tool in
combating the pandemic is testing for viral carriage, which is used for both diagnostic and
epidemiologic purposes. The most commonly used viral detection tests are based on the
reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction of viral genes (RT-qPCR). This
nucleic acid test is of high specificity, i.e. very low false-positive rate​2–5​
​ . In contrast, a high
6–10​
false-negative rate was reported for these tests​​ . These high false-negative rates impede
local and global efforts to slow down disease spread, as patients incorrectly diagnosed as
non-carriers may subsequently infect additional people​11​. Systematically quantifying the rate
of false-negative results and its dependencies on disease progression and patient
demographics is critical for disease spread modeling, public health policy making and
person-level quarantine decisions.
Various approaches have been taken to estimate the false-negative rate of COVID-19
RT-qPCR tests. Measuring the rate of false-negative results in a population of patients with
highly specific pathologies (​e.g. ​chest CT), has initially alerted physicians and
epidemiologists of the high false-negative rate, estimated at approximately 30% 4–7,9​
​ . A
meta-analysis of multiple such studies found that the reported rates were highly variable with
a mean false-negative rate of 11%​12​. However, and as previously noted​12,13​
​ , these
meta-analysis studies were necessarily based on a combination of variable studies of
non-uniform origins and methodologies, typically involving small groups of patients. A more
recent systematic approach was based on ‘longitudinal testing’ in which the accuracy of
each test is determined based on later tests of the same patient: a negative test which is
directly followed by a positive one is deemed false negative. Application of this approach in a
hospital setting resulted in an estimation of a false-negative rate of 17.8% 13​
​ . Systematic
large scale studies at the community, critical for epidemiological disease control, have been
lacking.
Beyond the average false negative rate, it is also important to understand whether and how
the false-negative rate is associated with patient-specific and sample-specific attributes.
Meta-analysis studies showed a strong association of false-negative results with time since
exposure​14
​ or time since onset of symptoms​15​
​ . At the patient specific level, as viral load is
associated with time since onset of symptoms, sex and age​16–22​
​
, it has been proposed that
false-negative rates might also depend on demographics, but current studies lacked
statistical power for quantifying such dependencies​23​
​ .
Here, we apply a longitudinal testing based approach to a large dataset of patient-level test
series with linked demographics and electronic health records, to qunatify the false-negative
rate of COVID-19 test results at the community and its associations with age, sex and time
since diagnosis. Finally, we test whether the risk of false-negative results is associated with
viral load at the single-patient level.

Methods
Data collection
Anonymized clinical records of SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test results (test reports) were
retrieved by Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS) for the period between February 8th and
September 24th 2020. Records of COVID-19 or COVID-19-related diagnoses by physicians
(diagnosis reports) and referrals based on suspected exposure to the disease
(epidemiological-based referrals) were retrieved for these patients. When available,
fluorescence measurements data of the PCR test were retrieved for each test (​RT-qPCR
measurements)​ . Randomly generated identifiers were used to link between test results and
diagnosis codes.
Test results. MHS aggregates all test results for all its members, whether or not the test itself
was performed by MHS laboratory. Test results data included, for each test: random patient
number, sample number, sample execution date and test result. Test results were either
“positive” (7.4%), “negative” (92%) or “borderline-positive” (0.6%, which we considered as
positive in our analysis). Patients for whom two tests with different results were recorded on
the same day were excluded from the analysis (274 patients, 0.05%).
Diagnosis reports. Diagnoses are routinely recorded in MHS database. For all patients with
at least one positive test result, we retrieved any symptom-based COVID-19 diagnoses
recorded prior to their first test. Diagnosis report data included: random patient number,
diagnosis date, and diagnosis code (ICD9 and internal MHS codes).
Epidemiologically-based referrals.​ Since April 3rd 2020, an epidemiologically-based referral
was filled by physicians referring a patient to a SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test. Each referral
report included: random patient number, referral number, referral date and referral cause.
RT-qPCR measurements. For each test, the following data were included: sample number,
PCR machine number, test well number, test date, Ct values for 4 channels: FAM, Cal Red
610 Quasar 670 and HEX, corresponding to the measurements of E gene, RdRp gene, N
gene and the internal control, respectively.
Assigning patient diagnosis date
For each patient, the earliest date of COVID-19 symptoms and/or epidemiologically-based
referral was considered as “date of diagnosis”. When both symptom-based diagnosis and
epidemiological-based referrals were available, they were usually recorded on the same day.
For simplicity, we excluded a small number of patients for whom both a diagnosis and a
referral were available, but were more than a day apart (5.2% of diagnosed patients).
Calculating the false negative rate
For any patient with at least one positive test, a ‘positive period’ was defined as the period
between their date of diagnosis and their last positive test. Negative test reports during this
period were regarded as false-negative (FN), while positive test reports during this period

were regarded as true-positive (TP). False-negative rate (FNR) was calculated as
N
F N R = T PF+F
N .
Logistic regression
Logistic regression of a false-negative versus true-positive result was performed using
Python’s statsmodels library. The probability of a false-negative result was fitted to the test
result (true-positive: 1, false-negative: 0) for all tests within the positive period.
Linear regression
Linear regression of Ct values for each fluorescence channel was performed using Python’s
statsmodels library.
Calculating odds ratios from logistic regression
Odds ratios (OR) were calculated from the coefficients of the above logistic regression. For
the binary variable sex (male: 1, female: 0), OR was defined as: ORsex = exp(C sex ) , while for
the
continuous
variables
age
and
day,
ORs
were
defined
as:
exp(C age * ageolder − C age * ageyounger ) younger versus older, exp(C day * day early − C day * day late )
early versus late, where C sex , C day , C age are the coefficients for sex, day and age variables,
respectivley.
Curve fitting for FNR over time
Test results were grouped by day since diagnosis. FNR was calculated separately for each
2

group. Data was fitted by F N R(t) = Rearly + (Rlate − Rearly ) * (1 − ea*t +b*t ) , where t is time
since diagnosis, and a , b , Rearly and Rlate are the fitted parameters, with the latter two
standing for the false negative rates at the early and late phases, respectively.
Differences in FNR between age groups
According to patient age, test results were divided into two groups of similar size (<40 , ≥40
years). FNR was calculated separately for each group. Statistical significance for differences
in FNR between groups was tested using a two-sided Fisher’s exact test (SciPy in Python).
Ethical approval
The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Maccabi Healthcare Services,
Tel-Aviv, Israel. IRB number: 0066-20-MHS.

Results
Among all ~2 million MHS patients, we identified 843,917 recorded tests for 521,696 patients
(table 1). Within this set, 51,499 patients had at least one positive result. As quarantine
discharge policy was based on test results, patients were often repeatedly tested, resulting
in a series of test results for each patient. In our analysis, we focused on 7,872 patients with
well-defined test series, satisfying the following conditions: (1) had a defined diagnosis date;
(2) had at least one positive sample within 14 days following the diagnostic date; (3) had a
test series that ended with a negative result (table 1). The vast majority of these test series

ended with 2 or more negative results, in agreement with the discharge policy (68% of
patients, supplementary table 1).
False negative and true positive test results were defined based on their context within a
patient series of test results. We considered, for each patient, the series of test results
following diagnosis (figure 1A,B). The median day since diagnosis until the first negative
result, indicating recovery, was 18 (IQR: 13-24; table 1). For some patients a negative result
came only after more than 50 days (2.4% of patients). For each patient, we then consider
the period from diagnosis date to the last positive sample as a period in which the patient is
carrying the virus, even if not at detectable loads yet (“positive period”). Taking an
epidemiological stand, negative test results within this patient-specific positive time period
were regarded as false-negative (FN) results. Similarly, positive test results within this period
were regarded as true-positive (TP) (figure 1A). To avoid bias for true-positive results, the
last positive result, used for marking the end of the positive period, was not counted towards
TP. The rate of negative results increased over time, and at 20 days after diagnosis the
number of negative tests first surpassed the number of positive or false-negative results
(figure 1B,C). In total, we identified 1,982 test results defined as FN and 6,715 test results
defined as TP, indicating an overall false-negative rate of 22.8% which is within the wide
range of previously reported FNR​13,23–28​.
To identify personalized features associated with false-negative results, we performed
multivariate logistic regression for the odds of a false-negative versus true-positive result
(Methods: ​‘Logistic regression’ and ​‘Calculating odds ratio from logistic regression’)​ . Patient
age, sex and number of days from day of diagnosis were all associated with a false-negative
result (supplementary table 2). Patient age was strongly anti-correlated with a false-negative
result, with odds ratio of 1.36 (95% CI: 1.34-1.39) for 10 years younger patients. The number
of days from the day of diagnosis was positively correlated with a false-negative result, with
OR of 2.08 (95% CI: 1.85-2.33) for samples taken at day 15 compared to samples taken at
day 0. Lastly, patient sex was also associated with false-negative results, with female to
male odds ratio of 1.74 (95% CI: 1.58-1.9).
Following the observed association between time after diagnosis and false-negative result,
we characterized the FNR during disease progression. Calculating FNR per day after
diagnosis (Methods: ​‘calculating FNR’​), we found that FNR followed 3 distinct phases: at the
first few days following diagnosis, it was fairly constant and low (10.7%, days 0-5). It then
gradually increased over days 6-15, and finally it plateaued at high rates of about 39%
(Methods: ​‘Curve fitting for FNR over time’;​ figure 2A).
We next focused on the earlier days after diagnosis (days 0-5), in which FNR was relatively
low, and in which a precise diagnosis is most critical for epidemiological patient-level
quarantine control. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of test results for these days
alone identified an association of false-negative results during these days with sex and age.
The risk of false negative result was again associated with age (OR of 1.56 for 10 years
younger patients, 95% CI: 1.51-1.61), and sex (female to male OR of 2.01, 95% CI:
1.69-2.39; supplementary table 3). Dividing the patients into 2 age groups of similar size
(<40 and ≥40, table 1), we found that FNR during this initial period was significantly higher
for the younger age group (p-value 0.0002, Fisher’s exact test, OR=1.41, 95% CI: 1.15-1.72;

figure 2B). Similarly, the FNR during the later period (days 6-24) also significantly decreased
with age (p-value 0.02, Fisher’s exact test).
Based on previous reports of viral load differences between males and females, among age
groups​ and along disease progression​5,16–19,21,29–34​
​
, we hypothesized that differences in FNR
across demographic factors and disease progression may stem from changes in viral load,
which would be reflected in the measured Ct values. To test this hypothesis, we first tested
for associations of Ct values of the three viral genes (N gene, E gene and RdRp) and the
internal control gene (IC) with patient age and sex and number of days after diagnosis
(figure 3, supplementary figure 1). Indeed, a linear regression model revealed positive
correlation of the Ct of viral genes with the number of days after diagnosis, and negative
correlation with age and sex (male; Methods: ​‘Linear regression’ , supplementary table 4).
An opposite association was found with the IC gene, in agreement with within-tube
competition for reagents between the multiplexed reactions (supplementary figure 1C)​35​. The
viral load association with demographics and time, therefore, mirrored the associations
found for the FNR.
Finally, we tested more directly for association of false-negative rate with viral load at the
individual patient level. Since Ct values are not available for false-negative results, we used
as a proxy the Ct values of the next positive result. Comparing the distribution of Ct values of
positive test results following false-negative tests with, as a control, the Ct values of positive
test results following true-positive tests, we found that indeed false-negative results are
associated with reduced viral load for all three viral genes (figure 4 and supplementary figure
2; Mann-Whitney U test; p-value of 4.6 * 10−4 , 9.0 * 10−5 , 7.7 * 10−4 for N, E and RdRp
genes, respectively).

Discussion
Our analysis of large dataset of electronic health records of COVID-19 patients showed that
while on average the FNR is about 23%, consistent with past measurements, this rate varies
strongly with age, sex and time after diagnosis. At the first few days following diagnosis, the
FNR is only 10% on average and even lower for men and older patients. Combining these
data with raw fluorescence measurements of RT-qPCR tests for the presence of
SARS-CoV-2 genes provides evidence that false-negative rates stem from low viral loads at
the single-patient level.
Our study has several limitations. First, we treat all positive tests as true positive. While
errors may occur, the rate of false-positive results is very low​2–5
​ and we do not expect it to
significantly affect our results. Future studies can further improve the reliability of
confirmation of positive cases by combining PCR test results with serology tests. Second,
we treat negative results at the end of test series as ‘true-negative’, while it is possible that if
the test series were continued additional positive tests might have been detected. Again, we
do not expect this to significantly affect our results: most series in our study end with two
consecutive negative results, and the chances for two consecutive false-negative tests are
very low. Moreover, this bias will mostly affect the calculated false-negative rate at later days
after diagnosis. Third, as viral loads after infection may first increase and only later

decrease, it is possible that false-negative rates follow an opposite pattern: first decreasing
and only later increasing. Analysing our cohort, we could only identify the later phase of
increasing false-negative rate. However, it is possible that with different cohorts or inclusion
criteria, both phases can be observed. Fourth, it will be interesting to see how changing the
way Ct is calculated can fine-tune the way positive and negative results are determined
based on conflicting results of the genes. Finally, we emphasize that most of the patients in
the study cohort were symptomatic; therefore, our results may not represent the
false-negative rate for asymptomatic patients.
Despite these limitations, our results provide important epidemiological and clinical input as
to the patient specific sensitivity of tests, with important implications for epidemiological
policy making, patient-specific quarantine decisions, and disease prevention and control. In
particular, they underscore that the risk of false-negative at the very early days following
diagnosis might be lower than previously thought, reinforcing the usefulness of these tests
for isolation-entry decisions. At the same time, they suggest that tests taken at later time
points are less reliable and may therefore be less adequate for isolation-release decisions.

Supplementary Figure 1. ​Differential change in Ct value along time after day of
diagnosis for different age groups. In the first 4 days after diagnosis, Ct values of E gene
(​A​), RdRp gene (​B​) and N gene (main text, Figure 3) are lower for older patients (age ≥40,
light grey) than for younger patients (age <40, dark grey). The opposite trend appears for the
IC gene (​C​) in agreement with within tube competition for reagents between the multiplexed
reactions. Error bars indicate SE.
