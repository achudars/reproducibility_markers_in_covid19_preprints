Coding Complete Genome Sequences of Twenty-three SARS-CoV-2 Strains Isolated in the Philippines

25

Abstract

26

Here, we report the coding complete genome sequences of 23 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus

27

2(SARS-CoV-2) strains from the Philippines. Sequences were obtained from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal

28

swabs from COVID-19 positive patients. Mutation analysis showed the presence of the D614G mutation in the spike

29

protein in 22 of 23 genomes.

30
31

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) belonging to the family Coronaviridae and genus

32

Betacoronavirus is the causative agent of COVID-19(1). In the Philippines, the ﬁrst confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case was

33

reported on 30 January 2020(2) and as of 31 Aug 2020, more than 200,000 cases had been reported(3). Here, we

34

announce the coding complete genome sequences of 23 SARS-CoV-2 strains collected from 3 April-18 July 2020 from

35

COVID-19 RT-PCR positive Filipino patients(4). Viral RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs

36

using QIAamp viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen) and used as template for amplicon sequencing using ARTIC SARS-CoV-2 V3

37

primers(4). DNA libraries were constructed and multiplexed using Illumina DNA prep, and then pooled before sequencing.

38

Sequencing was performed on MiSeq using the MiSeq reagent kit V 2(Illumina). Reference mapping was performed by

39

BWA-MEM aligner using Wuhan-Hu-1 genome sequence(GenBank Accession number NC_045512.2) as the reference

40

sequence(5). Primer regions trimming and call variants (Q ≥25) were performed using iVAR v.1.2.2(6) and samtools

41

(7), respectively. Consensus sequences were generated by iVAR v.1.2.2(6) (Q ≥25 and depth of coverage ≥10). Gaps,

42

deletion, and ambiguous bases were identified and confirmed by genome-guided assembly with the reference

43

sequence(NC_045512.2) using Trinity v2.8.5(8) and Sanger sequencing. Lineage and clade were determined using

44

Pangolin v.2.0.4(9), GISAID clade nomenclature(10), and phylogenetic analysis(11, 12, 13). We used MEGA 7.0(14)

45

to examine nucleotide and amino acid substitutions. All tools were run with default parameters. Raw reads yielded a

46

total of 8.4 gigabases (94% of the clusters with Phred quality score (Q)≥30). The length of reads obtained were 35-251

47

nucleotides and the range of number of reads obtained per library was 0.87 – 1.48 million reads. Consensus sequences

48

lengths were similar to the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain(NC_045512.2) with mean coverage ranging from 2,361X to 7,177X.

clade GR/lineage B.1.1, a major lineage frequently found in Europe and exported to the rest of the world(9, 10). Two

51

genomes(2/23) from 6 and 7 July 2020 were classified under clade GR/lineage B.1.1.28, found in Brazil(89%),

52

UK(8%), and China(2%) (https://cov-lineages.org/lineages/lineage_B.1.2.html). A single genome (1/23) was classified

53

under clade O/lineage B.6, a global lineage mostly found in Singapore and India (https://cov-lineages.org). Four amino

54

acid substitutions (ORF1b-P314L,S-D614G,N-R203K,and N-G204R), unique to clade GR (both lineages B.1.1 and

55

B.1.1.28), were seen in all our sequences in this clade. Two sequences of lineage B.1.1 had a 21-nucleotide deletion in

56

the N gene region. Five substitutions (ORF1a-R226K,ORF1a-E1126K,ORF1a-L3930F,S-V1176F,and ORF7b-V21I)

57

were observed uniquely in 2 sequences of lineage B.1.1.28.

58

None of the Philippine SARS-CoV-2 sequences in GISAID (accessed 22 August 2020) with collection date before 25

59

June 2020(15, 16) contained the D614G mutation. From the same set of data, lineage B.1.1 containing D614G was found

60

in a sample collected on 25 June 2020. This observation coincides with our findings that the D614G mutation was

61

observed from samples collected in June 2020(16). Our findings show the presence of lineages B.6, B.1.1 and B1.1.28,

62

with the latter being first reported in the Philippines in this study.

63

The D614G mutation is currently the most prevalent variant worldwide and is associated with higher viral RNA

64

levels and titers of pseudo viruses(17). In this study, all patients had no history of travel outside the country and

65

acquired the disease in the National Capital Region, Region 3 and 4A(Table 1), providing evidence of local

66

transmission. Multiple lineages and strains could have been introduced by travelers and Filipino repatriates(18).

67

The D614G mutation is replacing and rapidly surpassing in prevalence the original strain circulating prior to June

68

2020 and may partially explain the rapid rise of cases in the Philippines.

69

Data availability. The SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the Philippines were deposited in the GenBank database (accession

70

nos. MT919768-90). The raw reads have been deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA accession nos.

71

SRS7273360-82). The Bio Project accession no. is PRJNA659293. The Bio Sample accession nos. are SAMN15903138-
