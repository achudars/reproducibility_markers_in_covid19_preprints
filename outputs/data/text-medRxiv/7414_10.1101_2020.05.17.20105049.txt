Keywords: COVID-19; elderly people; risk interaction; South Korea; virus infection; SARS-CoV-2

worldwide, particularly on elderly population. This study aims to explore how risks of infection
interact across age groups using data from South Korea. Methods: Daily new COVID-19 cases
from March 10 to April 30, 2020 were scraped from online open sources. A multivariate vector
autoregressive model for time series count data was used to examine the risk interactions across
age groups. Case counts from previous days were included as predictors to dynamically examine
the change of risk patterns. Results: In South Korea, the risk of coronavirus infection among
elderly people was significantly affected by other age groups. An increase of virus infection
among people aged 20-39 was associated with a double risk of infection among elderly people.
Meanwhile, an increase in virus infection among elderly people was also significantly associated
with risks of infection among other age groups. The risks of infection among younger people were
relatively unaffected by that of other age groups. Conclusions: Protecting elderly people from
coronavirus infection could not only reduce the risk of infection among themselves but also
ameliorate the risks of virus infection among other age groups. Such interventions should be
effective and for long term.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the infection of a novel Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) [1]. Since December 2019, over 11
million people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and over 528,000 people died of coronavirus
infection (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html, accessed on July 4, 2020). Of them, elderly people
and people with underlying chronic conditions suffered the heaviest disease burden [2-4]. For
example,
about
80%
of
deaths
were
people
aged
65
or
above
(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html), and 43.4% of
hospitalizations aged 65 or above [5]. In the state of Florida, US, people aged 65 or above accounted
for 54% of hospitalizations, and the mortality rate was 14% if infected with virus [6].
The reasons for the disproportional burden among elderly people were unclear [7]. Elderly
people generally have weaker immune system than younger people due to aging, and they are also
more likely to have multiple chronic conditions [8,9]. Thus, elderly people may have severe
symptoms if infected with coronavirus [10,11]. On the other hand, elderly people may have
exposed myriads of infections over their lifetime which may provide immunity against new virus
infection. Although cross-reaction of antibodies between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 was
observed, cross-neutralization was rare [12]. Thus, it was unlikely elderly people might have any
effective immunity against SARS-CoV-2.
Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic is waning down in some countries such as South Korea
since March 10, 2020 (see Figure 1) [13,14], and society is gradually returning to normalcy [15]. A

potential rebound of new cases has been warned by many public health experts [16]. This is
reflected in an epidemic curve with a long tail and occasional spikes, which is demonstrated in the
epidemic process in South Korea (https://www.kcdc.info/covid-19/) [17,18]. In addition, if the
seasonality, immunity and cross-immunity of SARS-CoV-2 behave like previous coronaviruses, a
recent study predicted a long lasting and multi-wave epidemic was possible in the US [19].
Therefore, it is imperative to examine risk patterns of coronavirus infection among elderly people
after the peak of epidemic.
Unfortunately, due to lack of testing kits and heterogeneous diagnosis criteria, epidemiological
data on COVID-19 among different countries (and even within a country) were often
noncomparable [20]. One notable exception is South Korea where extensive contact tracing and
mass testing not only curtailed the epidemic but also generated high quality data. In South Korea,
both asymptomatic and symptomatic cases were identified promptly [17,18]. Thus, a complete
picture of the epidemic process was possible to depict.
In this study, we will examine how risks of coronavirus infection interact across age groups
using time series analysis. Using the high quality data from South Korea, we will focus on the postpeak period of the epidemic process to evaluate the risk of infection among elderly people during
the period of society re-opening.

Daily new COVID-19 case counts from South Korea were obtained from the website
(https://www.kaggle.com/kimjihoo/coronavirusdataset) which were scraped from the Korea Center
for Disease Control website. The first COVID-19 case in South Korea appeared on Jan 20, 2020, and
the major epidemic started on Feb 19, 2020. Since the peak of first epidemic wave in South Korea
ended around March 10 [21] (also Figure 1), we limited the time series of new cases between March
10 to April 30, 2020 for South Korea. All daily cases were stratified by age groups (0-19, 20-39, 40-59,
and 60 or above). Those aged 60 or above were referred as elderly people.
The observed epidemic curves by age groups from March 10 to April 30, 2020 were plotted,
and the predicted daily cases were obtained with a generalized additive model (GAM) [22]
assuming daily new cases follow Poisson distributions. The smoothness of predicted values was
achieved with thin plate regression splines with 16 knots using R mgcv package (see Appendix A).
We developed a vector autoregressive (VAR) model to examine the associations of the
infection risks across age groups simultaneously [23]. Specifically, we assumed daily new case
counts (y ) followed a generalized Poisson distribution to account for over-dispersion of case
counts (i.e., observed variance is larger than expected variance) [24]. The model also included case
counts from previous days (lags) across age groups as predictors to form a dynamic model (see
Appendix A for details). Therefore, the current risk of infection in each age group was predicted not
only by previous case counts in its own group but also by previous counts from other age groups.

the number of time lags. Because the typical incubation period of COVID-19 is five days [25], we
reported results from five-lag models. Three-lag and seven lag models were also explored, and
results from all models were consistent (see online codes and results). The scale parameter Î¾ in the
generalized Poisson distribution controls the magnitude of dispersion, that is, Î¾ = 0 corresponding
to a standard Poisson (mean = variance), Î¾ < 0 suggesting under-dispersion (mean > variance), and 0

account for the correlation of daily counts between age groups. The b was assumed a multivariate
normal distribution.
The above model framework was similar to the common log-linear relative risk models in
epidemiological studies which assume multiplicative associations between predictors and outcomes
[26]. The coefficients Î²s could be interpreted as natural logarithms of risk ratios per one unit change
of natural logarithms of case counts.
We fit the above models with Bayesian software stan through Rstan interface (http://mcstan.org) [27]. To keep the model simple, we assumed weakly informative priors of student t
distributions for all Î±s and Î²s, and an LKJ prior with modal density around diagonals for
correlations between case series (see Appendix A). Hamiltonian Monte Carlo was used to obtain
posterior distributions of parameters. Diagnostic plots showed all chains mixed satisfactorily and
were converged. In addition, negative binomial models were also fitted, and results were similar to
those reported here except for wider confidence intervals (Appendix B, Tables 1). Noticed that the
dispersion factors estimated from the generalized Poisson models were 2.66 (1.58 - 5.13), 1.44 (0.96 2.46), 2.21 (1.37 - 3.82), and 0.90 (0.59 - 1.50) for those aged 60 or above, 40-59, 20-39, and 0-19,
respectively. These estimates were of moderate magnitude and two of them (age group 40-59 and 019) were not statistically different from 1. This also suggested that negative binomial models might
overestimate the dispersion factors which led to wider confidence intervals. The data, replicable
codes and other results were available online (www.github.com/xinhuayu/riskinteractions/).

In South Korea, there were 3,383 COVID-19 cases between March 10 and April 30, 2020. Of
them, 283 cases aged 0-19 (8.4%), 1,141 aged 20-39 (50.0%), 987 aged 40-59 (29.2%), and 972 aged 60
or above (28.7%).
Figure 1 presented the epidemic curves with fitted values by age groups for South Korea. After
March 10, there was a small pike among those aged 60 or above around March 20,2020, and a small
rebound among those aged 20-39 (e.g., around March 30 to April 5, 2020), followed by those aged
40-59 and aged 60 or older.

Table 1 described associations of risks of infection across age groups in South Korea. In
addition to tracking effect from the first lag day (yesterday) among elderly people, the current risk
of infection among elderly people was associated with double risk by one unit increase of infection
risk among those aged 20-39 in the second lag day. Additionally, an increase of infection in the
youngest population during the fifth lag days was also associated with an increased risk of
infection among elderly people by 64%.
More importantly, an increase of virus infection among elderly people was associated with
increases in risks of infection among all other age groups, but with longer delays in younger
populations. Furthermore, the risk of infection among people aged 40-59 was affected by both old
and young people, but to a less extent. Risks of infection among people aged 20-39 or 0-19 were less
likely affected by other age groups.

This was the first study to quantify risk interactions of SARS-CoV-2 infection across age
groups based on vector autoregressive models using epidemic data of high quality from South
Korea. We found that in South Korea, the risk of infection among elderly people was significantly
affected by other age groups. An increase in virus infection among elderly people was also
significantly associated with increased risks of infection among other age groups. Risks of infections
among younger people were relatively unaffected by that of other age groups.
Our results were consistent with the current COVID-19 epidemic process, in which risk of
infections among elderly people might be affected by other age groups [28]. Although virus
transmission might differ among age groups [7,29], the risk interactions were likely due to personal
interactions between people of different age groups. Respiratory infectious diseases often spread
through personal contacts [30]. Previous studies showed that contacts were more frequent in young
age groups than older age groups, and interactions across age groups were less frequent than
within each age group [31]. During the emerging pandemic like COVID-19, stringent control
measures such as lock-down, strict social distancing and stay-at-home rules, were often
implemented promptly, leading to a significantly abrupt change of contact patterns within and
between age groups. Modern techniques such as contract tracing app, infection risk ID, and instant
notification of cases, also allowed us to efficiently isolate cases and quarantine high risk people. The
observed risk interactions between age groups in South Korea might be largely due to the change of
contact patterns during the epidemic period. As shown in our study, there were 2-5 lagging days in
the risk interactions across age groups, especial between old and young people. On the other hand,
the infection among elderly people may still be affected by and also affect the risks of infection
among other age groups. Passive community interactions such as grocery shopping might play an
important role in sustaining the epidemic.
Our results highlighted the importance of implementing and enforcing effective interventions
in the whole society [32-34], and the highest priority of protecting elderly people [29]. Furthermore,
we showed that an increase of coronavirus infection among elderly people was associated with
increased risks of infection among other age groups, suggesting protecting elderly people and
reducing the risk of infection among elderly people had spillover effect in the whole society. This
was consistent with our previous simulation study in which reducing contacts among elderly could
reduce the virus infection and hospitalizations in the whole society [35] .
There were some limitations in this study. The most important one was that we relied on
reported cases. The data from South Korea were more likely complete due to extensive contact
tracing and mass testing. Furthermore, the case reporting date (or virus infection detection/lab
confirmation date) was different from the virus infection date, and the average incubation period
for SARS-CoV-2 was about 5 days [25]. The laudable efforts of extensive contact tracing and mass
testing implemented by the South Korea government at the beginning of COVID-19 epidemic
significantly reduced the reporting delays, and likely identified many cases before symptom onsets
[17]. Therefore, the interval between virus infection and case reporting might be small. In addition,

there were other factors such as gender, socio-economic status and neighborhood environment
might also affect the risk of infection.
Moreover, although we interpreted the results with action terms, they had no explicit causative
meanings. For example, younger people tended to have milder or no symptoms (i.e., subclinical
cases) if infected with virus [36-38]. Thus, it was possible that an increased number of detected cases
among young people implied the existence of an increase in subclinical cases in the community
who might unknowingly infect other people, including elderly people. Subclinical cases could only
be identified through extensive contact tracing and mass testing. Without this information, it is
impossible to examine the route of infections in the community.
Our study has several strengths. Firstly, data from South Korea were more likely complete
which would provide information about underlying epidemic mechanisms. Although different
social norms and health care systems might explain some differences in risk patterns between South
Korea and other regions, results from South Korea provided a baseline picture of risk interactions
among age groups under a well-controlled, ideal epidemic process. Different patterns might be due
to differences in population structures, magnitudes of control measures and contact patterns in the
society, while similar patterns in risk interactions between regions allowed us to infer the possible
paths of infections.
Secondly, we proposed a novel multivariate autoregressive model for time series of counts to
examine the risk of virus infection across age groups simultaneously. A flexible generalized Poisson
model fitted with Bayesian methods was used to account for overdispersion of count data [24].
Unlike many other studies that used mechanistic epidemic models which was useful to describe the
epidemic process [39] , our statistical models extended traditional relative risk models to time series
of count data. It should be note that this type of model likely overfit the data and collinearity
among lag variables also exist. Thus, having a priori hypotheses and choosing biologically relevant
lags are critical in building correct models and interpreting the results. Our lag models were based
on observed incubation period of COVID-19 and for testing pre-specific hypotheses. The principle
of our methods was similar to that of Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) [40] and
University of Texas-Austin models [41], all of which relied on time series analysis of count data.
However, we did not attempt to predict future cases. Rather, we focused on disentangling risk
interactions of infection across age groups, which was more important and relevant in disease
preventions.
Finally, during the process of re-opening the economy and society, the number of new cases
may rebound, multiple small waves or a second big wave of epidemic are possible. A contentious
issue was whether and how to protect high risk populations such as elderly people during the
return of epidemic. Therefore, we limited our study period to the post-peak of epidemic to answer
this imminent question. Our study strongly supported that high risk populations such as elderly
people should still take serious precautions during the post-epidemic period.

5. Conclusions

223
224
225
226

In summary, protecting elderly people from coronavirus infection might not only be associated
with a reduced risk of infection among themselves but also related to lower risks of virus infection
among other age groups. Therefore, elderly people should keep on practicing social distancing and
maintaining effective personal protections until the pandemic is completely over.

Assuming daily new cases follow a Poisson distribution or negative binomial (NB) distribution
(see below), the GAM is a linear regression with smoothed time term. For simplicity, a separate
GAM regression was fitted for each age group:

where Y represents the observed case counts of day i and group j, and E(Y ) is expected
(predicted) value. The variable time represents day (1,â€¦,I), b ( ) represents a basis function for the
kth term to smooth temporal trend, and Î² s are regression coefficients for smooth term k and group
j. Restricted maximum likelihood (REML) approach was used in parameter estimation. R mgcv
package was used [22], and smooth terms were fitted using thin plate regression spline with 16
knots.

In standard Poisson distribution, expected variance equals mean. If observed variance is larger
than expected variance (i.e., the mean), then overdispersion exists. This often occurs when
outcomes are correlated, such as daily new case counts during a disease outbreak.
The generalized Poisson distribution introduces an additional scale parameter Î¾ [42] as quoted
in Hilbe JM. 2014 [26]. The PMF is:

On the other hand, the negative binomial distribution describes the distribution of the number
of successes given a predefined r number of failures during a sequence of independent Bernoulli
trials with a success probability p:

Where gamma function Î“(x+1) = x! (x factorial) for an integer x, and the parameter r can be any
positive real value.
Note that negative binomial distribution can be viewed as a Gamma-Poisson mixture
distribution in which Y ~ Poisson(Î») and Î» ~ Gamma(r , Î»/r). That is, the negative binomial
distribution (r, p) is the posterior distribution of Poisson(Î») with Gamma(r, Î»/r) as the conjugate
prior of Î», where 

Under this framework, negative binomial distribution is appealing as a natural extension of
Poisson distribution to allow for overdispersion that is controlled by the shape parameter r.
However, although negative binomial distribution is often used to model new case counts
during disease outbreaks, it models only overdispersion and assumes a quadratic relationship
between variance and mean, while the generalized Poisson model is more flexible and assumes a
simpler first order association between variance and mean. Therefore, we chose to report results
from generalized Poisson models. Results from negative binomial models were included in the
appendix. In addition, it is also of note that there are extensions of negative binomial models in
which the association between mean and variance can be estimated from data, leading to a more
flexible model and also permitting the exploration of determinants of overdispersion [26].
In this study, we proposed the following hierarchical vector autoregressive model (VAR) for
count data:

Where j = 1,â€¦,J represents age groups, t=1,â€¦,T represents days, and k = 1,â€¦,K represents the
number of lags. The PMF of Y can be either standard Poisson (Î»), generalized Poisson (Î¼, Î¾), or
negative binomial (Î¼, r) distribution.
The above VAR model included new case counts from previous days (lags) across age groups
as predictors[23], thus examining associations of the infection risks across age groups

simultaneously. That is, the current risk of infection in each age group was predicted not only by
previous case counts in its own group but also by previous counts from other age groups.
The correlation of daily counts between age groups was modeled through b that can be
viewed as a random effect. The b was assumed a multivariate normal distribution.
The exponential link between dynamic predictors and Î¼ is equivalent to common relative risk
models in epidemiological studies, i.e., log-linear models for count data. Under this multiplicative
scale framework, the interpretation of Î²s are relative risks given one unit increase of predictors.
During the model fitting, we assumed some weakly informative priors for all parameters:

The LKJ prior is a special prior most suitable for correlations. The LKJ(2) assumes a modal density
surrounding diagonals.
The models were fit with Bayesian software stan through Rstan interface [27]. A customized
stan function was constructed for fitting generalized Poisson model. We employed Hamiltonian
Monte Carlo with 5 Markov chains, each with 50,000 iterations plus 2000 warmups, to obtain
posterior distributions of parameters. Diagnostic plots through shinestan package showed all
chains mixed well and were converged. The replicable data and codes, including models with daily
case counts as standard Poisson, generalized Poisson or negative binomial distributions, were
available online (www.github.com/xinhuayu/riskinteractions/).
