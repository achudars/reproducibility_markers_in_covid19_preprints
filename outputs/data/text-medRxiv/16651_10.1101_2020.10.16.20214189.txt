Abstract
Background:
RT-qPCR is the reference test for identification of active SARS-CoV-2 infection, but is
associated with diagnostic delay. Antigen detection assays can generate results within 20
minutes and outside of laboratory settings. Yet, their diagnostic test performance in real life
settings has not been determined.
Methods:
The diagnostic value of the Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Abbott), was determined
in comparison to RT-qPCR (Seegene Allplex) in community-dwelling mildly symptomatic
subjects in a medium (Utrecht, the Netherlands) and high endemic area (Aruba), using two
concurrently obtained nasopharyngeal swabs.
Findings:
1367 and 208 subjects were enrolled in Utrecht and Aruba, respectively. SARS-CoV-2
prevalence, based on RT-qPCR, was 10.2% (n=139) and 30.3% (n=63) in Utrecht and Aruba
respectively. Specificity of the PanbioTM COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test was 100% (95%CI: 99.7100%) in both settings. Test sensitivity was 72.6% (95%CI: 64.5-79.9%) in the Netherlands
and 81.0% (95% CI: 69.0–89.8%) in Aruba. Probability of false negative results was associated
with RT-qPCR Ct-values, but not with duration of symptoms. Restricting RT-qPCR test
positivity to Ct-values <32 yielded test sensitivities of 95.2% (95%CI: 89.3-98.5%) in the
Netherlands and 98.0% (95%CI: 89.2–99.95%) in Aruba.
Interpretation:
In community-dwelling subjects with mild respiratory symptoms the Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag
Rapid Test had 100% specificity, and a sensitivity above 95% for nasopharyngeal samples
when using Ct values <32 cycles as cut-off for RT-qPCR test positivity. Considering short
turnaround times, user friendliness, low costs and opportunities for decentralized testing, this
test can improve our efforts to control transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has extensive impact on healthcare globally, with over 37 million
confirmed cases and currently more than one million deaths.1 Rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 infection and subsequent contact tracing are essential in the containment of transmission.2
The reference test for detection of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection is reverse transcriptase
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).3 RT-qPCR requires the use of expensive
laboratory instrumentation as well as dedicated lab supplies and trained personnel, which
causes significant challenges to generate sufficient testing capacity and short turnaround
times.
Lateral Flow Assay (LFA)-based point of care tests (POCT) for rapid antigen detection using
antibodies are cheap, simple to perform, do not require laboratory instrumentation and
generate results within 20 minutes. Several different rapid antigen tests have been developed
with usually high specificity but varying sensitivity4–9. These tests have the potential to alter
testing strategies worldwide.7 Recently the WHO approved the first rapid diagnostic POCT and
initiated a global partnership to pledge 120 million tests to low- and middle-income countries.10
However, the diagnostic performance of individual POCTs in real-life community settings is
unknown.9
We evaluated the Abbott PanbioTM COVID-19 Ag rapid test in community testing locations in
both a medium- and high endemic population and compared results to RT-qPCR and
determined associations with duration of symptoms and risk of exposure.

Materials and methods
Populations and Study Period
All individuals visiting COVID-19 community testing centers, located at the University Medical
Center Utrecht (UMCU) in the Netherlands (September 22nd to October 6th) and the Horacio
Oduber Hospital on Aruba (September 23rd to October 9th), aged 16 and over were asked to
participate in the evaluation. In both study sites, subjects were first sampled for routine RTqPCR testing, using a combined throat/nasopharyngeal swab. Study participants received an
additional nasopharyngeal swab. Participants at the UMCU study site were asked to fill out a
questionnaire regarding (onset of) symptoms and risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.
Diagnostic tests
RT-qPCR
After collection, swabs were transferred into 3 ml Universal transport medium until further
processing. Nucleic acid extraction, RT-PCR and results interpretation were performed
according the instructions of the manufacturer (Seegene, South-Korea). In short, RNA was
isolated and purified using the MagC extraction kit (Seegene, South-Korea) on an automatic
nucleic acid extractor Hamilton MicroLAB StartLET (Bonaduz, Switzerland). Subsequently,
cDNA was generated and amplification was performed in a single tube assay using the Allplex
19-nCoV multiplex platform for detection of SARS-CoV-2 (Seegene, South-Korea), and results
were interpreted with Seegene Viewer data analysis software. The assay uses fluorescent
Taqman® probes for three SARS-CoV-2 genes (E-, N-, and RdRP-gene). Amplification and
detection were performed for 45 cycles on a Biorad CFX96 thermocycler (Biorad Laboratories,
the Netherlands). A positive result was defined as amplification of any of the three SARS-CoV2 genes.

LFA:
The PanbioTM COVID-19 Ag rapid test device by Abbott (Lake Country, IL, U.S.A) is a
membrane-based immunochromatography assay which detects the nucleocapsid protein of
SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples. Collected swabs were transferred into dedicated
sample collection tubes containing a sampling buffer. Collected samples were subsequently
processed in a level 2 biosafety cabinet in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol, within
2 hours of sample collection. Test results were recorded after 15 minutes of assay initiation,
by two independent observers (blinded to each other and to the PCR results). Single lot LFA
testing devices were used: lot 41ADF011A.
Ethical Approval
The medical research ethics committee (MREC) of Utrecht decided the study is not subject to
the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO) and did not require full review by
an accredited MREC. The ethical committee of the hospital board of Aruba approved the study.
All participants have provided written informed consent.
Statistical analysis
Population characteristics are reported as mean (SD) or median [IQR] values. Specificity and
sensitivity with 95% confidence intervals, and positive and negative predictive value of the LFA
were calculated using the RT-qPCR results as reference test. Factors associated with LFA
results were determined using logistic regression, using Nagelkerke’s pseudo R 2 as a measure
of goodness-of-fit. Data was analysed using the free, open-source software environment R 11.
Role of the funding source
This study was investigator initiated. No external funding was received.
Results
Population Characteristics
At the UMCU study site 1369 subjects were included, of which 139 tested positive for SARSCoV-2 by RT-qPCR (prevalence: 10.2%). The mean (SD) Ct values for E-gene, N-gene and
RdRP-gene were 24.74 (5.73), 27.51 (6.01) and 26.35 (5.60), respectively.
At the Aruba study site 208 subjects were included, of which 63 tested positive for SARS-CoV2 (prevalence: 30.3%). The mean (SD) Ct values for E-gene, N-gene and RdRP-gene at the
Aruba site were 25.69 (5.96), 26.56 (6.41) and 26.26 (6.36), respectively.
Estimated participation rates were 50% at the UMCU study site and 25% at the Aruba study
site. Samples from two participants were excluded, due to inappropriate application of the
nasopharyngeal swab and laboratory mislabelling. Data on symptoms were missing from nine
subjects and data on duration of symptoms from 201 subjects (14.7% of total subjects, 11.9%
of SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects, p=0.439).
Individuals at the UMCU study site were more often female (61.7%) and were largely between
20 to 50 years of age (Table 1). Nearly all individuals reported symptoms (97.3%), most
frequently coryza (69.0%), sore throat (66.3%) and cough (57.1%). Duration of symptoms were
1-3 days in 387 subjects (33.2%), 4-7 days in 560 subjects (48.0%), and more than a week in
191 subjects (16.4%). Of all individuals, 17% reported prior contact with a confirmed SARSCoV-2 positive individual.
Compared to subjects who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 in RT-qPCR, SARS-CoV-2
positive subjects were younger, more likely male, more frequently had prior contact with a

confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive individual, and more frequently reported fever, chills, an
altered sense of smell or taste, or joint- or muscle ache. The most frequently reported
symptoms, coryza and sore throat, were negatively associated with detection of SARS-CoV-2
by RT-qPCR.

LFA Results
At the UMCU study site, 101 subjects tested positive by LFA yielding an overall sensitivity of
72.6% (95% CI: 64.5 – 79.9%) (Table 2). False positive LFA results were not observed
(specificity 100%, 95% CI: 99.7 – 100%). Similar results were obtained at the Aruba study site,
with an overall sensitivity of 81.0% (95% CI: 69.0 – 89.8%) and specificity of 100% (95% CI:
97.5 – 100%) (Table 2). We observed no interrater variability in interpretation of test bands
and no bands were classified as unclear by the independent observers.
False negative LFA results were mostly observed in subjects with high RT-qPCR Ct values,
reflecting low viral load levels in nasopharyngeal material (Figure 1). Using logistic regression,
the likelihood of a false negative LFA result was associated with the RT-qPCR Ct value (R2 =
0.77, p<0.0001, Figure 2). When defining RT-qPCR Ct positivity on a cut-off Ct value of 32
LFA sensitivity was 95.2% (95% CI: 89.3 – 98.5%) at the UMCU study and 98.0% (89.2 –
99.95%) at the Aruba study site.

Relation with symptoms
The duration of symptoms was not associated with Ct-values (p = 0.46) or with the occurrence
of false negative LFA results (p = 0.30) (Figure 3). When including only symptoms positively
associated with COVID-19 (i.e., fever, chills, loss of taste/smell, muscle- or joint ache), duration
of symptoms was weakly associated with Ct-values (p= 0.02), but no such association was
found with LFA results (p= 0.45). Restricting analyses to individuals with symptoms for less
than 7 days did not change sensitivity of LFA neither for all subjects positive with RT-qPCR
(74.3%; 95%CI 64.6 – 82.4%) or when applying a cut-off at Ct>32 (97.4%; 95%CI 90.9 –
99.7%).

Discussion
In this real-life evaluation of the PanbioTM COVID-19 Ag rapid test in community-dwelling
subjects with mild symptoms of respiratory tract infection, the assay reliably identified SARSCoV-2 infected subjects with low Ct values by RT-qPCR (i.e. infections with a high viral load
in nasopharyngeal samples). In our study cohorts specificity was 100%, overall sensitivity was
72.6% and 95.2% when using a Ct value of 32 as cut-off.
This new LFA test has not been evaluated extensively. The manufacturer reported a higher
sensitivity (93.3%; 95CI 83.8-98.2), obtained in a high endemic setting in Brazil, testing
individuals with symptoms for less than seven days only.12 In another cohort of 257 patients
(both symptomatic and asymptomatic) enrolled at the emergency department and primary
health care setting in Spain, overall sensitivity was 73.3%, and 86.5% among individuals with
symptoms for less than seven days.8
In our study cohort, false negative results were observed only at high Ct values, i.e. with low
viral load in nasopharyngeal material. This may occur very early in the infection
(presymptomatic stage) before viral replication peaks, or in a late stage of infection when
replication has decreased. Individuals with symptoms for more than 7 days may, therefore, be
more likely to have a low viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs than those tested shortly after
symptom onset. Indeed, a longer duration of symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection,
was associated with higher Ct values, but no such association was observed between false
negative LFA results and duration of symptoms. As a result, test sensitivity did not substantially
increase when analyses were restricted to individuals with symptoms for less than a week. It
must be noted that the study period corresponded with high prevalence of seasonal rhinovirus
and other respiratory infections in the Netherlands, 13,14 thereby possibly obscuring the
association of upper respiratory tract symptoms with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
From a public healthcare perspective, missed infections with the LFA in patients with high Ct
values in a late stage of infection may have limited impact, as these individuals are less likely
to contribute to transmission. This is supported by findings that culturing of SARS-CoV-2
appeared not possible at Ct values above 29.15
Yet, false negative LFA results were also observed among individuals with a very short
duration of symptoms and high Ct values. A missed infection in the early stage may have
consequences for transmission as these individuals may become infectious 16–18. Furthermore,
the majority of individuals in our cohort reported (mild) symptoms. Studies are needed to
determine the sensitivity of this LFA test in asymptomatic subjects with detectable SARS-CoV2 in RT-qPCR. These studies could also provide more insight in the performance of this LFA
in the presymptomatic stage of infection.
For symptomatic persons requiring hospital admission a diagnostic test with high sensitivity is
needed to establish a definitive clinical diagnosis.19 In this clinical context, we recommend to
use RT-qPCR, as its sensitivity is superior to this LFA, allowing detection of individuals in the
presymptomatic and late stage of infection which are both relevant in this context. However, in
the context of community-based surveillance, tests need to identify symptomatic and
asymptomatic infections in short time to stop onward spread. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is
considered to occur mainly around symptom onset, when viral load peaks.20,21 This LFA,
therefore, appears to reliably identify those patients that are most likely to contribute to onward
transmission and could therefore be an essential new tool in our testing strategies. As the virus

remains infectious in the assay sampling buffer (data not shown), biosafety should be taken
into account when implementing the use of the Panbio Covid-19 LFA outside a laboratory
setting. Considering the short turnaround time, user friendliness, opportunity for decentralized
testing and low costs we believe that in the context of community-based surveillance of
symptomatic individuals, these advantages outweighs the lower sensitivity of LFA compared
to RT-qPCR. Modelling studies may provide further reassurance on the safety of such an
approach.
