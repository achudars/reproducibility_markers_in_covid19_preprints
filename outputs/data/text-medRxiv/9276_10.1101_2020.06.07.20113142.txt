Short Summary: The pandemic of COVID-19 did not cause changes in the sexual behavior of

26

MSM; they continued to engage in casual sex, using drugs, having multiple partners and

27

adopting ineffective protective measures for COVID-19.

28

ABSTRACT

29

Background: We investigated the extent to which Brazilian and Portuguese MSM had casual

30

sexual relations outside their homes during the period of sheltering in place for the COVID-19

31

pandemic.

32

Methods: An online survey was implemented in Brazil and Portugal in April, during the period

33

of social isolation for COVID-19, with a sample of 2,361 MSMs. Recruitment was done through

34

meeting apps and Facebook.

35

Results: Most of the sample (53.0%; considering 53.1% in Portugal and 53% in Brazil) had

36

casual sex partners during sheltering. Factors that increased the odds of engaging in casual sex in

37

Brazil were having group sex (aOR 2.1, 95%CI 1.3-3.4), living in a urban area (aOR 1.6, 95%CI

38

1.1-2.2), feeling that sheltering had high impact on daily life (aOR 3.0, 95%CI 1.1-8.3), having

39

casual instead of steady partners (aOR 2.5, 95%CI 1.8-3.5), and not decreasing the number of

40

partners (aOR 6.5, 95%CI 4.2-10.0). In Portugal, the odds of engaging in casual sex increased

41

with using Facebook to find partners (aOR 4.6, 95%CI 3.0-7.2), not decreasing the number of

42

partners (aOR 3.8, 95%CI 2.9-5.9), usually finding partners in physical venues (pre-COVID-19)

43

(aOR 5.4, 95%CI 3.2–8.9), feeling that the isolation had high impact on daily life (aOR 3.0,

44

95%CI 1.3-6.7), and HIV-positive serostatus (aOR 11.7, 95%CI 4.7-29.2). Taking PrEP/Truvada

45

to prevent COVID-19 was reported by 12.7% of MSM.

Conclusions: The pandemic has not stopped most of our MSM sample from finding sexual

47

partners, with high risk sexual behaviors continuing. Public health messages for the prevention

48

of COVID-19 need to be crafted to explicitly address sexual behavior to reduce contamination in

49

the current moment.

Background

52

By September 01, 2020, Brazil was still one of the most affected countries by the

53

COVID-19 pandemic. With 121,381 deaths and 3,908,272 cases of COVID-19 officially

54

confirmed [1] and an incidence rate (per 100,000 population) of 1837.9; Brazil ranked in the

55

second position in the world [2]. Portugal, where the infection started spreading nearly one

56

month before Brazil, had 58,243 confirmed cases and 1,824 deaths by COVID-19 by the same

57

date [3], and an incidence rate (per 100,000 population) of 573.5.

58

Without a vaccine or effective treatment, general preventive measures for respiratory

59

infections remain the main form of containing the spread of the virus. Minimizing the gathering

60

and movement of people, that is, “sheltering in place” to varying degrees of strictness have been

61

adopted by many countries, including Brazil and Portugal [4,5]. There appears to be positive

62

effects of sheltering on reducing the speed of COVID-19 infection. However, other aspects of

63

health, including mental and sexual health, may be suffering [6].

64

Social support is a known protective factor for general health, especially for LGBT

65

communities that have historically been victims of social exclusion. Social withdrawal can

66

trigger harmful consequences for mental and physical health. In populations where this support is

67

more fragile, as in the case of LGBT populations, interruptions in social support can have severe

68

negative consequences, including greater risk of exposure to COVID-19, as the disease is still

69

not fully understood [6].

70

To measure the potential consequences of COVID-19 on the sexual behavior of MSM,

71

the In_PrEP Group in Brazil and Portugal implemented an online questionnaire. In particular, the

72

questionnaire sought to measure whether MSM were seeking casual partners during the period

73

when shelter in place directives were in effect and which measures they were undertaking to

74

reduce the risk of COVID-19, as well as HIV and other STIs. Brazil and Portugal were selected

75

as they share a language and a large flow of people between these countries each year (28,210)

76

[8], through immigration, professional and academic activities, and tourism [9].

Methods

79

Study design, population, sampling, and recruitment

80

This project entitled “40tena” is derived from the In_PrEP cohort study, a multicenter survey

81

started in 2020, which carries out behavioral follow up of MSM, implemented in all 26 Brazilian

82

states and the Federal District, and in 15 of the 18 districts of Portugal. Due to the COVID-19

83

pandemic, some questions were added to assess sexual behavior during the sheltering-in-place

84

period. The research project and the presentation of these manuscripts were guided by the

85

STROBE tool and The Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES).

86

A rapid and dynamic data collection process took place in April 2020 at a time when the two

87

countries were under sheltering directives. In both countries, the directives of the official health

88

agencies asked the inhabitants to “shelter in place”, avoiding close contact with people outside

89

their place of shelter as much as possible. Essential activities such as trade and some services

90

were maintained, but with restrictions.

91

In total, 2,361 MSM participated in the research, out of which 1,651 (69.9%) were from

92

Brazil and 710 (30.1%) from Portugal. The research participants were recruited by an adaptation

93

of the Respondent Drive Sampling (RDS) method to the virtual environment, so that one

94

participant was responsible for recruiting other individuals of the same category as his, using

95

their networks. To meet the requirements of the method, we selected 15 MSM with different

96

characteristics in relation to: location in the country (divided according to the regions of the two

97

countries); race/skin color (Caucasian and non-Caucasian), age (young, adult, and older adult)

98

and schooling level. These were the first participants and they were identified as seeds. Each

99

participant received the link to the research website and was instructed to invite/disseminate to

100

MSM of their social network, until obtaining a significant sample.

101

The seeds were identified by the two most popular [10] geolocation-based dating applications

102

(Grindr and Hornet) by direct chat with online users, adapted to time location sampling (TLS)

103

technique following previous methods [11-12] (Figure 01).

104

We also used the social network Facebook to boost the number of participants, directing to

105

the MSM population aged between 18 and 60 years (age limit imposed by the social network),

106

by a fixed post on the official search page (https://www.facebook.com/taafimdeque/) and it was

107

followed by an electronic link, which provided access to the free and informed consent form and

108

the survey questionnaire.

109

We included only individuals who identified themselves as men (cis or trans), aged 18 or

110

over, and living in one of the two countries. Non-Portuguese speakers and tourists were

111

excluded. For Facebook recruitment, the researchers used the boost feature to target MSM in

112

both countries.

114

Data were collected by Computer-Assisted Technique Interview (CASI). The data collection

115

questionnaire was hosted on the study site and, for security reasons, it only allowed one answer

116

by IP (internet protocol), that is, only one user answered by machine (computer, cell phone ...).

117

The research questionnaire was created and validated (face-content) by a group of three experts

118

from both countries in two versions: European Portuguese (Portugal) and Brazilian Portuguese

119

(Brazil). It was divided into four sections with 46 questions, mostly multiple choice, some of

120

which were mandatory for completion of the questionnaire. The questions addressed:

121

1. Sociodemographic information (age; gender identity; schooling; race/skin color; sexual

122

orientation; type of current relationship; country; state; place of dwelling);

123

2. Social welfare and coping in the period of social distancing;

124

3. Sexual practices and activities during the pandemic, namely: sexual practice with a casual

125

partner; sex with use of drugs; threesome or group sex; sex without condom use; STIs protection

126

strategies; sex frequency and protection measures against COVID-19; search for health services;

127

4. Sexual practices and activities in the period prior to the pandemic: Use of PrEP and PEP;

128

commonly used ways to search for partners; knowledge about STIs and HIV testing;

129

For this study, we defined sex with a casual partner or simply casual sex, such as anal sex with a

130

new or unknown partner outside the place where they were sheltered, with the question: “Since

131

the social distancing/sheltering was proposed in your country, have you had sex with a new or

132

unknown partner who is outside the place where you are sheltered, or have you left your shelter

133

to meet that partner?.”

134

Analysis

135

Descriptive analysis was performed for key numerical and categorical variables. Bivariate and

136

multivariable logistic regression was used to characterize associations with having casual sex.

137

We tested the multicollinearity between variables before moving on to the regression model. A

138

final model was selected, using the forward conditional input method, based on retaining those

139

variables with p<0.1 while using p<0.05 as the cut-off for significance. The best performance of

140

the multivariate model with was considered for aspects of accuracy, sensitivity to specificity

141

(Receiver Operating Characteristic - ROC) proving that the statistical performance developed

142

was better than chance.

143

Ethical considerations

144

The research project obtained ethical approval from the Universidade Nova de Lisboa and

145

Universidade de São Paulo. Informed consent was obtained from all users online, before

146

proceeding with the questionnaire.

147

148

Results

149

A total of 2,361 MSM participated in the online surveys, including 1,651 (69.9%) from Brazil

150

and 710 (30.1%) from Portugal (Table 1). Most participants had access to the survey from the

151

indication by social networks partners or colleagues (72.7%), and Facebook was responsible

152

for® the remaining 27.3%. The median age was 29 years (ranging from 18-66). Most men in

153

both countries lived in urban areas (69.0% in Brazil, 95.4% in Portugal) and were single (69.2%

154

in Brazil, 82.3% in Portugal). One in ten (9.9%) MSM respondents in Brazil self-reported their

155

HIV status as positive, as did 12.1% of respondents in Portugal. In Brazil, 10.5% reported testing

156

and 5.5% reported being diagnosed with COVID-19. In Portugal, 15.5% had tested and 1.8%

157

were diagnosed with COVID-19.

158

Table 1 also describes how the COVID-19 epidemic changed the respondents’ sexual behavior.

Over half of respondents (n:1252/ 53.0%) had casual sex, considering that 47 (3.8%) engaged in

160

paid sex, group sex (27.3%), sex under the influence of alcohol or drugs (69.8%), and

161

unprotected sex (47.1%).

162

Many MSM reported behaviors that they believed would reduce the risk of COVID-19

163

transmission. Apart from measures taken with respect to sex, general preventive measures (e.g.,

164

use of face mask until the meeting place and hand sanitizing with hand sanitizer) (25.8%), asking

165

if the partner was sheltering (30.7%), and asking if the partner had symptoms (27.5%) were

166

mentioned. Other measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 included avoiding kissing during

167

sex (16.2%), washing hands before and after sex (27.6%), and cleaning the place where they had

168

sex before and after sex (14.6%). Notably, among the 652 users of PrEP / Truvada in this study

169

almost half (301; 46.1%) also referred using this medicine as a preventive measure to the

170

transmission of COVID-19.

171

Table 2 presents correlates of leaving the house or having someone in their house for

172

casual sex during the sheltering period in bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models

173

for each country. In Brazil, the odds of engaging in casual sex increased with the variables

174

having group sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.4), living in a urban area (aOR

175

1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.2), feeling that sheltering had average (aOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.5-3.2) or high

176

impact on their daily life (aOR 3.0, 95% CI 1.1-8.3) compared to low impact, having casual

177

partners (aOR 2.5, 95% CI 1.8-3.5), and not decreasing the number of partners during the

178

COVID-19 epidemic (aOR 6.5, 95% CI 4.2-10.0). In Portugal, the odds of engaging in casual

179

sex increased with the variables using Facebook to find partners (aOR 4.6, 95% CI 3.0-7.2), not

180

decreasing the number of partners during the COVID-19 epidemic (aOR 3.8, 95% CI 2.9-5.9),

185

Discussion

186

Our study showed that the COVID-19 pandemic and the period of sheltering in place did not stop

187

a considerable portion of Brazilian and Portuguese MSM from finding casual sexual partners.

188

Nevertheless, over 95% of respondents say they adopted at least partial sheltering in place. For

189

Brazil, this level may be higher than typically reported by local authorities for the general

190

population (between 40% and 55%) [13]. These figures may be cause for corcern regarding

191

overcrowding hospitals [14]. For Portugal, compliance in the general population appears to have

192

been high enough to avert overwhelming the hospital system [15]. Although slightly over half of

193

MSM still found casual partners outside their homes, 75% had fewer partners compared to

194

before the COVID-19 epidemic. MSM reported other measures to reduce the risk for COVID-19

195

akin to other risk-reduction practices. For example, more than 25% asked if their partners were

196

otherwise sheltering and if they had any symptoms of COVID-19. Although close contact was

197

inherent or implied in having casual sex, many MSM reported avoiding kissing, handwashing

198

before and after sex, and cleaning the place where they had sex before and after sex.

199

An unexpected finding was the use of PrEP/Truvada for COVID-19 prophylaxis. In the

200

absence of evidence of efficacy for COVID-19 prevention, the assumption may lead to people on

201

PrEP to neglect effective measures. A possible explanation for the adoption of this practice

202

might be misunderstanding the discussion of potential of prophylaxis drugs for SARS-CoV2 in

203

the popular media [16]. Some MSM may have mistaken Truvada, promoted for HIV

10

204

prophylaxis, as having a similar mechanism for SARS-CoV2. Specific messaging may be needed

205

to dispel this false connection through programs promoting PrEP for HIV.

206

Our study also found continuing behaviors that may place the studied group at high risk

207

for acquiring or transmitting HIV and other STIs during the COVID-19 epidemic, at levels

208

similar to those reported in studies [10,17] slightly prior to the pandemic period. More than one

209

in six MSM reported group sex, implying the meeting of several people in very close contact,

210

thus amplifying potential COVID-9 exposure [18]. Engaging in group sex was further associated

211

with increased odds of having casual partners among the group of Brazilian MSM. Sexual

212

encounters under the influence of drugs or alcohol, also common during the sheltering period,

213

can decrease reasoning capacity and hinder the adoption of preventive measures for HIV/STIs

214

and COVID-19 [19]. Unprotected sex with a new casual partner was reported by over one in

215

three Brazilian MSM and one in five Portuguese MSM during the shelter in place period. These

216

have been considered high rates of incidence[12].

217

The duration of the sheltering period, with accompanying feelings of isolation, may

218

partly explain the high-risk sexual behaviors. Most participants had been isolated for at least 30

219

days, and many recognized a high impact of social isolation on their lives. This in turn may have

220

led MSM to feel a greater need for social contact, to seek a “break” in isolation to seek partners

221

[20], with an additional break for HIV preventive measures. This hypothesis is corroborated by

222

the findings of the multivariable analysis, in which acknowledging high impact of the sheltering

223

period was associated with seeking external casual sex partners in both in Brazil and in Portugal.

224

The effect of a prolonged isolation period is particularly worrisome as Brazil moves towards

225

becoming a COVID-19 epicenter in Latin America and the world [21].

226

Some studies imply that social isolation may lead to higher utilization of virtual networks

227

to search for sexual encounters [6, 22]. Connections via the Tinder application increased 15% in

228

the US and 25% in Italy and Spain during the COVID-19 epidemic [22]. The duration of chat

229

activity also increased by 30% [22]. Notably, the use of Facebook as the preferable way to find

230

partners before the pandemic was significantly associated with greater odds for Portuguese MSM

231

having casual sex. Another hypothesis is that partnering through Facebook can provide a false

232

sense of exposure control, as it enables sex with a friend, acquaintance or otherwise someone

233

belonging to the same social network Yet another possible explanation for the association of

234

increased casual partnering during COVID-19 and use of Facebook, not yet documented in the

235

literature, may be fear of judgment (i.e., for breaking sheltering) by closer friends, which leads

236

MSM to seek out like-minded strangers. On the other hand, social media can assist with keeping

237

smaller social groups as well as in the adoption of practices such as virtual sex and masturbation

238

[23, 24], which may reduce risks of transmissible infections.

239

Other significant associations with seeking casual sex during COVID-19 are notable.

240

Being HIV positive also increased the odds of engaging in casual sex in Portuguese MSM.

241

Although we recognize that even before the pandemic, studies indicated that MSM living with

242

HIV already had high-risk sexual behavior[25,26], another hypothesis may be in the false sense

243

of protection due to antiretrovirals for HIV currently being tested in COVID-19 patients [27].

244

This may be consistent with assumptions or misunderstandings about PrEP, as mentioned above.

245

In both Brazil and in Portugal, living in an urban area increased the odds of casual sex,

246

likely explained by an access to greater numbers of MSM [28]. This facilitates the location and

247

selection of partners by dating applications or other social media [12].

248

This study has several limitations. First, we recognize the data derived from a

249

convenience sample in both countries. Venue-based and peer-referral mechanisms to sample and

250

recruit are harder to logistically accomplish during the COVID-19 epidemic. The site that hosts

251

the form is not able to inform how many subjects were reached, only the amount of access and

252

answers.

253

Secondly, we did not measure variables recognized as important in hindsight, such as

254

exact number of days in sheltering, different sexual practices, and the organization of other

255

events, such as parties where sex may have occurred. Lastly, we did not test for COVID-19 and

256

therefore could not fully link behaviors directly to infection. Furthermore, most questions refer to

257

past events that may be biased by memory.

258

Conclusions

259

We were able to identify a high frequency of casual sex among MSM, as well as associated

260

factors that might increase exposure to SARS-CoV-2, HIV, and other STIs during a period of

261

high COVID-19 transmission after implementation of sheltering in place. Although many

262

strategies were adopted to minimize the exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the effectiveness of those

263

measures is threatened by high-risk practices for both COVID-19 and HIV, including

264

unprotected sexual intercourse and group sex. By analyzing two countries with different

265

scenarios for control of COVID-19, we were able to demonstrate the vulnerability of MSM

266

communities to the pandemic. Our results should be considered when making decisions about

267

public health, since if these vulnerabilities are left unaddressed, they may hamper the response to

268

the pandemic.
