Abstract

77

Introduction

78

Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus, later named by WHO as SARS-CoV-2,

79

emerged in Wuhan, China [1-3] and rapidly spread throughout Hubei province, with

80

clustered cases reported globally [4-5]. Until February 19th 2020, the total reported

Objective To describe and evaluate the impact of diseases control and prevention on
epidemics dynamics and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Shanghai.
Design

A retrospective descriptive study

Setting

China

Participants Epidemiology information was collected from publicly accessible database.
265 patients admitted to Shanghai Public Health Center with confirmed COVID-19 were
enrolled for clinical features analysis.
Main outcome measure Prevention and control measures taken by Shanghai government,
epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiology data were collected.
Weibull distribution, Chi-square test, Fisher’s exact test, t test or Mann-Whitney U test were
used in statistical analysis.
Results COVID-19 transmission rate within Shanghai had reduced over 99% than
previous speculated, and the exponential growth has been stopped so far. Epidemic was
characterized by the first stage mainly composed of imported cases and the second stage
where >50% of cases were local. The incubation period was 6.4 (95% CI 5.3 to 7.6) days
and the mean onset-admission interval was 5.5 days (95% CI, 5.1 to 5.9). Median time for
COVID-19 progressed to severe diseases were 8.5 days (IQR: 4.8-11.0 days). By February
11th, proportion of patients being mild, moderate, severe and critically ill were 1.9%(5/265),
89.8%(238/265), 3.8%(10/265), 4.5%(12/265), respectively; 47 people in our cohort were
discharged, and 1 patient died.
Conclusion Strict controlling of the transmission rate at the early stage of an epidemic in
metropolis can quickly prohibit the spread of the diseases. Controlling local clusters is the
key to prevent outbreaks from imported cases. Most COVID-19 severe cases progressed
within 14 days of disease onset. Multiple systemic laboratory abnormalities had been
observed before significant respiratory dysfunction.

81

confirmed corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases have reached more than 72,000

82

within mainland China, and 888 cases in other 25 countries globally and the increasing

83

number

84

internationally[6]. Up until now, multiple studies have described the clinical characteristics

85

of the COVID-19, including fever, fatigue, cough etc. Various researches reported intensive

86

care unit (ICU) admission rate between 19.1% to 32%[7-9], but this data mainly came from

87

Hubei regions, and it might be biased towards detecting severe cases at the beginning of

88

the epidemic. Thus, clinical features from regions outside Hubei can further assist the

89

understanding of the disease’s epidemiological and clinical characteristics. Shanghai

90

reported its first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in January 20th 2020, and the total

91

confirmed cases have reached to 333 cases by February 19th. As one of the global

92

metropolis, Shanghai faces a relatively higher epidemics danger due to the substantial

93

population mobility, and the risk is even doubled as Chunyun(a huge population flows

94

during the Spring Festival) collided with the epidemics. During this outbreak, Shanghai has

95

issued a number of strict measures to lower the transmissibility, including the shutdown of

96

all large entertainment venue, reducing passenger flow and very strong social propaganda.

97

Therefore, whether the Shanghai model has an impact on the epidemics dynamics and

98

disease control is an important reference to the other metropolises around the world. In

99

our study, we aimed to retrospectively describe the impact of diseases control on epidemics

100

dynamics and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Shanghai, and to provide

101

valuable experience for other metropolises around the world.

Methods

104

Study design and participants

105

This is a retrospective, single-center cohort study, recruiting all patients admitted to

106

Shanghai Public Health Center (SHPHC) diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019

107

(COVID 2019) according to WHO interim guidance before Feb 7th, 2020. According to the

108

arrangement of government, almost all adult patients from whole Shanghai were admitted

109

to SHPHC once coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) was confirmed by real-time PCR.

110

The study was approved by SHPHC ethics committee and oral consent was obtained from

111

patients.

112
113

All patients admitted to Shanghai Public Health Center diagnosed with coronavirus disease

114

COVID-19 according to WHO interim guidance were enrolled in this study [10]. Two cohorts

115

were generated in this study, mild-moderate cohort and severe-critically ill cohort. All

116

COVID-19 patients are classified as mild to critically ill cases at admission, according to

117

COVID-19 Guidelines (the fifth version) made by National Health Commission of the

118

People’s Republic of China. The classifying criteria was as follows:

119

Mild: Presenting mild symptoms and normal radiology manifestation in both lungs.

120

Moderate (typical): Presenting typical symptoms (fever, cough and other respiratory

121

symptoms) and radiology manifestation suggesting pneumonia.

122

Severe: Presenting any one of the followings:

123

1) Respiratory distress, respiratory rates ≥30 per minute;

124

2) Pulse oxygen saturation ≤93% on room air

3) Oxygenation Index (PaO2/FiO2) ≤300mmHg
Critically ill: Presenting any one of the followings

127

1) Respiratory failure where invasive ventilation is necessary

128

2) Signs of shock (circulatory failure)

129

3) Failure of any other organ where ICU care is necessary

130
131

Data Collection

132

The cumulative numbers of confirmed and suspected cases were collected from Shanghai

133

CDC, which were updated daily and publicly accessible. We obtained epidemiological,

134

demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiology data from patients’ medical records. The

135

data were reviewed by a trained team of physicians. Information recorded included

136

demographic data, medical history, exposure history, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory

137

findings at baseline and chest x-ray or computed tomographic (CT) scans. The date of

138

disease onset was defined as the day when the symptom was noticed.

139
140

Statistical analysis

141

The incubation period distribution (i.e., the time delay from suspected contact to illness

142

onset), and the onset-to-admission distribution was estimated by fitting a Weibull

143

distribution to data on suspected exposure and onset dates in a subset of cases with

144

detailed information available. Categorical variables were described as frequencies and

145

percentages, and compared by Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test between two cohorts.

146

Continuous variables were described as median and interquartile range (IQR) values.

147

Means for continuous variables were compared using independent group t-tests when the

148

data were normally distributed; otherwise, the Mann-Whitney test was used. For

149

comparisons, a 2-sided α of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results

150

of laboratory tests were also standardized and arranged by unsupervised hierarchical

151

clustering to identify the similarities, differences and characteristics, with Euclidean

152

distance measure and average linkage between groups methods. Statistical analyses were

153

performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 22.0 software

154

(SPSS Inc) and R software. Analyses of the incubation period, extensive predictive

155

analysis were performed with the use of MATLAB software (R2016b).

Results

158

Epidemiological analysis

159

As of February, 19th 2020, a total number of 72,531 confirmed COVID-19 cases have been

160

reported according to reports from 31 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) and

161

the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps in mainland China. However, the number

162

of newly increased cases, especially in regions outside Hubei provinces, has gradually

163

decreased since February 5th with the peak value of 3887. The same decreased trend can

164

be seen in the newly increased cases in Shanghai, with continuous declined growth rate

165

observed since February 4th. The total confirmed cases number of COVID-19 cases was

166

333 as of February 19th 2020, of which the percentage of COVID-19 cases without travel

167

history to Hubei province gradually surpassed 50%, according to the official report (Figure

168

1-A). The increased trend of cases without travel history to Hubei Provence and the

169

confirmed 45 clusters cases in Shanghai implied that the second-generation cases in

170

Shanghai had appeared gradually. In our study, the earliest symptom onset of all confirmed

171

patients can be traced back to January 6th 2020. The development of the epidemic followed

172

an exponential growth and a decline in newly reported cases (Figure 2).

173

The study examined data on suspected exposures among all 265 laboratory-

174

confirmed cases with detailed, 37 of whom had credible information on contacts to

175

calculate the incubation period distribution. The mean incubation period is 6.4 days (95%

176

CI 5.3 to 7.6) and the 5th and 95th percentile of the distribution was 0.97 and 13.10,

177

respectively (Figure 3-A). The mean onset-admission interval was 5.5 days (95% CI, 5.1

178

to 5.9, SD 3.5). The 5th and 95th percentile of the distribution was 1 and 11.99, respectively

179

(Figure 3-B).

180

We performed an extensive analysis to February 9th 2020 using the previously

181

reported predictive parameterized transmission models in Shanghai and compared with

182

the actual reported confirmed cases [11-12]. The previous predictive model was based on

183

the hypothesis that no particular effective measures had been taken around the world and

184

the transmission among population had not been controlled. Our result showed that the

185

transmission rate within Shanghai had all decreased more than 95% than previously

186

speculated, suggesting that the prevention and control interventions taken by Shanghai

187

are of great impact on the overall control of the diseases during the current disease stage

188

(Figure 1-B).

191

220 (90.9%) patients had fever before admission. Nearly half of patients were presented

192

with pneumonia symptoms including cough (49.4%), expectoration (23.0%), chest pain

193

(2.3%). Other common symptoms included fatigue (25.3%), inappetences (11.7%),

194

headache (9.8%), myalgia (8.7%). Only 6.4% patients had diarrhea. Most symptom profile

195

were comparable between mild-moderate patients (N=243) and severe-critically ill patients

196

(N=22) while dyspnea occurred in a significantly higher proportion of severe or critical ill

197

patients (1/237 vs. 4/22, p<0.001). Eleven patients were asymptomatic on admission

198

(Table 1).

199

All patients underwent chest X-ray or CT at admission (Table 2). 202 (76.2%) patients

200

showed bilateral pneumonia while 51 (19.2%) patients showed unilateral pneumonia, and

201

9 (3.4%) patients showed almost no abnormalities. The most common abnormalities were

202

multiple ground-glass opacities. All asymptomatic patients had findings that consistent with

203

pneumonia.

204

On admission, 120 (45.3%) and 39 (14.7%) patients had lymphopenia and leukopenia

205

respectively (Table 2). Most patients had normal levels of hemoglobin and platelets (92.5%

206

and 82.0%, respectively). Elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine

207

kinase were detected in 106 (40.0%) and 46 (17.4%) cases, respectively. The elevation of

208

erythrocyte sedimentation rate （ ESR ） and C-reactive protein (CRP) was common.

209

Compared with patients with mild and moderate COVID-19, those with severe or critically

210

disease presented with extensively and significantly different laboratory parameters,

211

including lymphocytes and neutrophils, myocardial zymogram (creatine kinase, myoglobin,

212

troponin T, LDH, NT-proBNP), liver and renal function (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate

aminotransferase, albumin, serum creatine, and eGFR), coagulation function (activated

214

partial thromboplastin time, fibrin degradation products , and D-dimer), and infection-

215

related biomarkers (CRP and procalcitonin). The counts of CD4+ and CD8+ cell of severe

216

or critically ill patients were 205/μl and 135/μl, significantly lower than those of the mild or

217

moderate patients (Figure 4).

218
219

Timeline and outcome of the disease progression

220

The proportion of patients with mild, moderate, severe and critically ill diseases on

221

admission were 3.4% (9/265), 94.0% (249/265), 1.1% (3/265), and 1.5% (4/265),

222

respectively. The spectrum of severity of diseases changed slightly as disease progressed.

223

Of the 9 mild cases without pulmonary abnormality on admission, 4 showed bilateral or

224

unilateral pneumonia in the subsequent chest CT tests which meant they were classified

225

into moderate cases during hospitalization; and the remaining 5 had no changes in

226

pulmonary imaging follow-ups for more than two weeks. While all the 11 asymptomatic

227

patients had findings that consistent with pneumonia on routine CT examinations on

228

admission. One of the patients was asymptomatic until she was discharged 11 days after

229

being hospitalized. Two patients had subjective symptoms during the hospitalization. The

230

remaining patients were still under observation in the hospital and had no symptoms. The

231

median time for COVID-19 progressed to severe diseases was 8.5 days (IQR: 4.75-11.0

232

days), and to critically ill, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, was 10.0 days (IQR:

233

5.5-11.0 days). There were 22 severely ill patients in the cohort, of which 21 were severely

234

ill within 14 days of the course of the disease (Figure 5). When reevaluated the patients

235

who were on day 14 of illness, we observed that 9.6% (17/177, 95%CI: 5.6-15.4%) had

236

severe or critically ill COVID-19 while 86.7% (152/177) were stable, and other 4.5% (8/177)

237

cured (Figure 6). By February 11th, the proportion of patients being mile, moderate, sever

238

and critically ill were 1.9%(5/265), 89.8%(238/265), 3.8%(10/265), 4.5%(12/265),

239

respectively; 47 (17.7%) people in our cohort were discharged, and 1 (0.38%) patient died.

240

One of the critically ill patients was complicated with sepsis, two were treated with

241

continuous renal replacement therapies, three patients were on extra-corporeal membrane

242

oxygenation, and one patient recovered from severe disease to moderate condition.

243
244

Discussion

245

The first laboratory-confirmed case in Shanghai was reported in January 20th, and

246

epidemic of Shanghai has experienced an increasing trend, during which the amplification

247

of the newly diagnosed cases per day was increasing continuously. However, the trend

248

had turned to a declining phase since January 31st. This phase was in accordance with the

249

most regions outside Hubei province in China. In Hubei, newly diagnosed cases were still

250

increasing in Hubei and on Feb 12th, because the clinical diagnosis was included in the

251

guideline, the daily number of diagnosed patients had reached a spike of more than 10,000,

252

allowing many suspected who haven’t the chance to be laboratory-confirmed to be

253

admitted to the hospital for treatment. Therefore, in the near future, the local prevention

254

and control of COVID-19 in Hubei would enter into a critical stage, where a turning point

255

might be met if all measures were successively achieved.

256

Comparing the actual diseases trend in Shanghai with the previously estimated trends,

257

we could find out that Shanghai exhibited a high-efficiency epidemics controlling ability and

258

had stopped the exponential growth for now. The reason behind this is that during this

259

epidemic, Chinese and Shanghai government has issued very strong and strict measures

260

in restricting the transmission in local regions. The national transport department

261

announced a 45% and 70.6% decline in the passenger flow at the beginning and the end

262

of 2020 Spring Festival, respectively [13-14]. What’s more, Shanghai government

263

cancelled all gathering activities and through propaganda of the officials, media and

264

community, citizens were well-informed and well-educated of the importance of wearing

265

face masks and washing hands frequently. Previous studies have suggested that the

266

mobility reduction could not effectively lower the incidence rate while 50% transmissibility

267

reduction could easily prevent the epidemics from further spreading [12]. In the case of

268

Shanghai, the transmissibility was indeed greatly reduced, however, we believe the

269

mobility reduction also played an indirect role in lowering the transmissibility. This is

270

because that Chinese Spring Festival is characterized by hundreds of millions of people

271

transporting from one region to another, and this massive gathering at the airports, train

272

stations during transportation, if not controlled, would significantly increase the human to

273

human transmission. Therefore, during this special period, controlling both mobility and

274

transmissibility might be important. Other doubt lies in that previous studies have reported

275

that the ascertainment rate in Wuhan is 5.1%[11], and suggested that other cities such as

276

Shanghai, Beijing have the similar ascertainment rate, which would lead to our local case

277

numbers fall below the true ones. However, in Shanghai for example, the suspected cases

278

were approximately 20 folds of the laboratory-confirmed cases. Thus we expected the

279

ascertainment rate outside Hubei province was closer to the actual epidemic size. But in

280

the end, the disease prevention and control of the regions outside Hubei province would

281

always heavily rely on the diminish of the epidemic in Hubei province, and the combination

282

of Hubei epidemic control and strong measures to prevent local clustered cases outside

283

Hubei will be the key to success.

284

In areas outside Hubei, the epidemics has transmitted from the first stage, in which

285

imported cases composed of the main laboratory-confirmed cases, to the second stage,

286

where imported cases and local sporadic or even clustered cases were simultaneously

287

seen while imported cases from Hubei province gradually reduced due to the region shut

288

down. In fact, clusters of cases within China and around the world without Hubei travelling

289

history have been reported, indicating the shifting of the epidemic characteristics globally.

290

In our study, we found that local cases increased approximately 5 days after the first the

291

imported cases, possibly due to the incubation period after these local cases were infected.

292

Also, the proportion of patients with a travel history to Hubei has gradually decreased, and

293

the proportion of patients without a travel history to in Hubei has gradually increased. This

294

suggests that strengthening prevention of local sporadic or clustered cases in areas

295

outside Hubei in the future will be crucial for the second-stage epidemic control outside

296

Hubei province.

297

In our study, the incubation period is similar as other studies previously reported, but

298

the mean onset-admission interval was 5.478 days, shorter than 12.5 day initially reported

299

in Wuhan[15], suggesting the timely control and prevention of the diseases spreading. One

300

reason behind this is the improvement of the diagnostic ability of the disease, mainly the

301

production of RT-PCR kit, which significantly shortened the diagnostic time frame.

302

The 11 asymptomatic patients in the Shanghai cohort were diagnosed after nucleic

303

acid sampling of close contacts of confirmed patients. Routine chest CT examinations at

304

admission revealed pneumonia in all of them. Therefore, these patients can only be

305

considered asymptomatic but not in incubation. Although there was a reported case of

306

incubation time up to 24 day [16], we believe that it is necessary to clarify whether an

307

imaging assessment was performed before the onset of symptoms in this patient. However,

308

it is worth noting that, at the epidemiological level, these asymptomatic patients are almost

309

the same as those in the incubation period. A positive nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR for

310

COVID-19 in these patients suggests that they do have the potential to infect others. We

311

therefore believe that more active inspections and evaluations of close contacts should be

312

undertaken.

313

The proportion of severe and critically ill patients in Shanghai was significantly lower

314

than that in Wuhan. We consider the proportion of patients with severe illness to be a very

315

important indicator of the disease. First, regional mortality rate varies widely in the early

316

stages of the disease outbreak because it is affected by many factors, such as life support

317

equipment for critically ill patients and local medical conditions. In the absence of effective

318

antiviral drugs, the proportion of critically ill patients depicts the natural course of the

319

disease better than the mortality rate. Second, because the final clinical outcome of

320

majority of the reported cases is typically unknown during a growing epidemic, dividing the

321

cumulative reported deaths by reported cases will underestimate the mortality rate early in

322

an epidemic[17]. We believe that the proportion of severe illness in Wuhan is biased

323

towards detecting severe cases, partly because diagnostic capacity is limited at the start

324

of an epidemic. Because of Shanghai’s active surveillance, especially for suspected cases

325

with recent travel history to the affected region and close contacts, demonstrating by

326

shorter onset-administration interval and 4% asymptomatic patients on admission,

327

Shanghai should have picked up clinically milder cases as well as the more severe cases

328

resulting a more reliable proportion of critically ill patients. To reduce the bias cause by mild

329

case in early stage, we calculated the proportion of critically ill patients among those with

330

an onset of 14 days or more, since more than 95% sever cases in Shanghai developed

331

before that time. That proportion of 9.6% is substantially lower than SARS or MERS. The

332

early clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients in Shanghai were similar to those

333

reported in Wuhan and elsewhere[7-9].

334

Our study showed relatively comprehensive laboratory test results in the published

335

studies. Assessed through this systematic inspection, we can find that sever COVID-19

336

cases had extensive systemic laboratory abnormalities which indicated multisystem

337

involvement had existed before significant respiratory abnormalities appeared. Previous

338

studies have found that most patients had reduced lymphocytes and abnormal levels of

339

many cytokines in critically ill patients [8,16]. Lymphocyte classification in our study showed

340

that CD4 and CD8 cells both decreased in COVID-19 patients, and ~15% patients had

341

CD4 / CD8 <1. This may be related to a systemic inflammatory response caused by a

342

cytokine storm, which is similar to that of SARS patients. The severity classification of

343

COVID-19 patients in China mainly focuses on the respiratory system and oxygenation of

344

patients. We believe more attention should be paid to other organs function of the patient

345

in addition to the respiratory system. As follow-up continues, we can observe the outcome

346

of more and more patients, and it should be possible to identify early risk factors that

347

indicate a poor prognosis.

348

Our study has several limitations. First, as the epidemics has not ended yet, the

349

effect of the control measures cannot be fully evaluated. Second, as most patients are

350

still hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission, clinical outcome remains to be

351

seen. Third, we did not measure cytokines and viral loads, which may be related to

352

disease progression and severity.

353

Conclusion

354

Strict measures on controlling disease transmissibility in a metropolis can quickly reduce

355

the spread of a new infectious diseases to polar levels and stop its exponential growth in

356

the short term. Controlling the local clusters is the key to prevent outbreaks due to imported

357

cases. Our studies showed that the incubation period for COVID-19 is 6.438 days and 9.6%

358

of COVID-19 cases were severe cases. The median time for COVID-19 progressing to

359

severe diseases was 8.5 days and multiple systemic laboratory abnormalities which

360

indicated multisystem involvement had been observed before significant respiratory

361

abnormalities appeared.

Figure 4. Significantly different laboratory parameters
Compared to the mild-moderate cohort, some laboratory results were obviously abnormal
in Severe-critically ill cohort, suggesting impairments in different system in severe or
critically ill COVID 2019 patients. Each box extends from the 25th to 75th percentiles, and
each whisker goes down to the smallest value and up to the largest value (except for
outliers. The shade between dotted line two dotted lines indicates the normal range of
parameters. (The whiskers were generated using Tukey method, where values were
regarded as outliers and not presented in this figure if greater than the sum of the 75 th
percentile plus 1.5 IQR or less than 25th percentile minus 1.5IQR. Boxes, whiskers and
normal range change were extracted from graph of each parameter, adjusted to fit each
other in fixed proportions, the distribution of the testing results and their relationship with
normal range were not changed during the adjustment). All parameters presented in this
figure had significant difference between two cohorts (P<0.05).
