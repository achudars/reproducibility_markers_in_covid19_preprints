Abstract
Recently, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused viral pneumonia worldwide,
spreading to more than 200 countries, posing a major threat to international health. To
prevent the spread of COVID-19, in this study, we report that the city lockdown measure was
an effective way to reduce the number of new cases, and the nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
concentration can be adopted as an environmental lockdown indicator. In China, after strict
city lockdown, the average NO2 concentration decreased 55.7% (95% confidence interval
(CI): 51.5-59.6%) and the total number of newly confirmed cases decreased significantly.
Our results also indicate that the global airborne NO2 concentration steeply decreased over
the vast majority of COVID-19-hit areas based on satellite measurements. We found that the
total number of newly confirmed cases reached an inflection point about two weeks after the
lockdown. The total number of newly confirmed cases can be reduced by about 50% within
30 days of the lockdown. The stricter lockdown will help newly confirmed cases to decline
earlier and more rapidly. Italy, Germany and France are good examples. Our results suggest
that NO2 satellite measurement can help decision makers effectively monitor control
regulations to reduce the spread of COVID-19.

1. Introduction

2

Large-scale COVID-19 viral pneumonia through human-to-human transmission poses a

3

severe and acute public health emergency (Huang et al., 2020a; Li et al., 2020). As the epidemic

4

worsened, most countries imposed city lockdown and quarantine measures to reduce

5

transmission to control the epidemic. The Chinese government has gradually implemented a

6

city-wide quarantine of Wuhan and several surrounding cities as of 23 January, flights and trains

7

to and from Wuhan have been suspended, and public transport has been halted (Cyranoski et al.,

8

2020; Wu et al., 2020). The entire northern Italy was quarantined since 9 March 2020, and three

9

days later the government extended it to the whole country (Paterlini, 2020).The Spanish

10

government declared a 15-day national emergency, starting on 15 March (Legido-Quigley et al.,

11

2020). In the United States, on 19 March, California became the first state to order a lockdown

12

(Baccini et al., 2020). In Germany, since 18 March, 16 states have closed, public gatherings of

13

more than two people have been banned and most shops except supermarkets and pharmacies

14

have closed (Dehning et al., 2020). On 23 March, the British government announced a new

15

nationwide restriction allowing residents to only venture outside when absolutely necessary, e.g.,

16

to work, buy necessities (Iacobucci, 2020).

17

The worldwide lockdown, which was imposed to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus,

18

not only caused an economic downturn but also appeared to result in cleaner air in urban areas

19

usually heavily affected by pollution (Lian et al., 2020; Schiermeier, 2020). The most important

20

measure of the lockdown policy was the reduction of traffic and control personnel flow, and

21

traffic pollution is an important factor influencing air quality and public health. Vehicle exhaust

22

and evaporation emissions are the main emission sources of ozone and secondary particle

23

precursors near the ground in cities and regions (Zhou et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2013), and the

24

spatial variation of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon (BC)

25

may also be significant affected by traffic flow density (Clougherty et al., 2013). A study in Los

26

Angeles showed that nitrogen oxides (NOx) were identified as a source of pollution for light

27

vehicles, with NO2, NOx, carbon dioxide (CO2), BC, and fine particle number (PNfine) identified

28

as diesel exhaust sources (Tessum et al., 2018; Fan et al., 2018). In South Korea, source analysis

29

studies have shown that there is a high correlation between estimated traffic volume and NO2

30

concentration (Kim et al., 2015). NO2 levels can be used as a proxy for exposure to

31

traffic-related composite air pollution and to assess the impact of scenarios designed to reduce

32

traffic-related emissions (Brnnum-Hansen et al., 2018; Johansson et al., 2017).

33

In this report, we study the parameters of environmental indicators for city lockdown. Using

34

the automatic ground detection data and satellite data to analyze the trend of lockdown and the

35

total confirmed new cases in major cities in China, and using satellite data to further study the

36

impact of lockdown on virus transmission in countries mainly severely affected by the epidemic,

37

in order to help policymakers to formulate effective control measures to reduce the spread of

38

COVID-19.

2. Data and measurement

41

The ground observation daily data were provided by the China National Environmental

42

Monitoring Centre (http://www.cnemc.cn/). The data from January 24, 2020, to February 23,

43

2020, are selected as the representative data after the lockdown in Hubei, and the data from

44

December 24, 2019, to January 23, 2020, are selected as the representative data before the

45

lockdown (Fig. 1). The NO2 ground observation data of China is from 1 January 2020 to 1

46

March 2020. The average concentration of major cities with severe epidemic diseases was

47

selected as the representative of NO2 concentration of China, including Wuhan, Nanchang,

48

Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Changsha, Beijing, Shanghai, Hefei and Zhengzhou (Fig. 3). All

49

monitoring instruments of the air quality automatic monitoring system operate automatically 24

50

h a day. The monitoring items are PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO. The automatic monitoring of

51

PM2.5 and PM10 adopts the micro-oscillating balance method and the β-absorption method,

52

respectively (ambient air quality standards, GB 3095-2012). SO2 was determined by the

53

ultraviolet fluorescence method, NO2 by the chemiluminescence method, CO by the

54

nondispersion infrared absorption method and gas filter correlation infrared absorption method.

55

This paper adopted the level 3 daily global gridded (0.25°×0.25°) nitrogen dioxide product

56

(OMNO2d) provided by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) onboard the Aura satellite as

57

the

59

on July 15, 2004, with its overall objective of monitoring the chemistry and dynamics of the

60

atmosphere from the ground to the mesosphere. The OMI is a nadir-viewing charge-coupled

61

device (CCD) spectrometer onboard the Aura satellite, whose observation band is

62

near-UV/visible. We selected the Column Amount NO2 Trop product to calculate the changes in

63

3. Results analysis

87

3.1. A spatial comparison of pollutants before and after lockdown in Hubei Province.

88

Fig. 1 shows the change in pollutant concentration in Hubei Province one month before and

89

after the closure of major cities severely affected by the epidemic. Compared with before the

90

lockdown, NO2, sulphur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter (PM10), carbon monoxide (CO) and

91

PM2.5 concentrations all decreased to a certain extent, while NO2 experienced the most notable

92

decrease. Since biomass and coal combustion are major SO2 and CO sources, they exhibit the

93

lowest rate of improvement (Khalil et al., 1988; Huang et al., 2012). Both the PM2.5 and PM10

94

concentrations decreased to a certain extent (31.2% and 34.3%, respectively) as a result of the

95

reduction in fugitive dust, particulate matter and important precursors produced by motor

96

vehicles and factories (Huang et al., 2019). The monthly average PM2.5/PM10 ratio was 0.81 (95%

97

confidence interval (CI): 0.76-0.86), so PM2.5 was the main particle pollutant after lockdown.

98

Exhaust emissions contributed only moderately to local levels of the PM2.5 total mass, which

99

were mostly derived from other sources, such as biomass combustion and the remote

100

transmission of secondary particles (Chen et al., 2012). Therefore, the impact of strict traffic

101

control during the lockdown on PM2.5 is not notable, and the spatial difference is large, so PM2.5

102

is not suitable as a city lockdown indicator.

103

Although the NO2 emissions per vehicle slightly decreased after the upgrading of the

104

quality standards of petroleum products, the notable growth of vehicle ownership increased the

105

proportion of NO2 traffic source emissions, in addition, after the implementation of emission

106

standards for coal-fired power plants, multiple technical improvements greatly controlled the

107

NO2 emissions from coal-fired sources, which all enhanced the correlation between NO2 and city

108

lockdown effect (Liu et al., 2020). The effect of city closure on NO2 was significantly greater

109

than that on the other pollutants, with an average concentration reduction of approximately 60.3%

110

(95% CI: 56.8-64.0%), which can be applied as an environmental indicator of the lockdown

111

effect.

112
113

3.2. Changes of airborne NO2 plummets over COVID-19-hit area after lockdown.

114

In East Asia (Fig. 2a), satellite images show that compared to before the blockade, the total

115

emissions of NO2 in eastern China have significantly decreased by approximately 56.6%. In

116

South Korea, the monthly NO2 emissions have also been reduced by approximately 18.0 %. The

117

local government has implemented the most expansive testing programme and has isolated

118

people infected with the virus without locking down entire cities, and the sharp decrease in NO2

119

may be linked to the reduction in local emissions and pollutant transport from surrounding areas

120

(Han, 2019; Bauwens et al., 2020). Japan has not imposed widespread lockdown policies, and a

121

4.8% increase in NO2 may be linked to emissions from power generation and industrial

122

processes (Han, 2019). In western Europe (Fig. 2b), the monthly NO2 concentrations have

123

decreased sharply in Italy by 47.5%, particularly in the north (82.4%), where the outbreak is the

124

most severe. This could be due to the reduction in road traffic and the decrease in economic

125

activities in the industrial heartland as a result of the widespread lockdown policy (Schiermeier,

126

2020). Other countries such as Germany, Denmark, and Poland also experienced notable

127

reductions. This is consistent with the results of the European Environment Agency (EEA) (EEA,

128

2020). However, in certain areas, such as northern and southern Spain, the NO2 concentration

129

has risen, possibly because of lax closure measures and increased emissions from coal-fired

130

power plants (Curier et al., 2014). In the United States (Fig. 2c), one month after the lockdown,

131

the overall decline in NO2 is relatively small. The worst affected states, such as New York,

132

Washington and California, still contain areas with increased NO2 concentrations, and the NO2

133

concentration is increasing significantly in the vast midwestern regions that have not yet been

134

locked down.

135
136

3.3. The temporal evolution of the NO2 concentration and the total number of newly confirmed

137

cases in China.

138

After the strict city lockdown, the NO2 concentration in the main virus-affected cities in

139

China decreased significantly (Fig. 3). Consistent with the satellite data, the ground monitoring

140

results showed that compared to the conditions before the closure, the monthly average NO2

141

concentration after the lockdown decreased approximately 55.7% (95% CI: 51.5-59.6%). Since

142

the lockdown, the total number of confirmed new cases reaches an inflection point after

143

approximately two weeks (the incubation period of the virus is 14 days), and compared to the

144

period of 1-15 days after the closure, the total number of confirmed new cases in the 16-30 days

145

after the closure has decreased 73.6% (95% CI: 64.9-81.1%). The most significant improvement

146

was recorded in Hangzhou, where the NO2 concentration decreased approximately 68.1%, and

147

the total number of confirmed new cases declined the most. Likewise, Zhengzhou, Changsha,

148

Guangzhou, and Nanchang are good examples. Wuhan, the worst virus-affected area in China,

149

also exhibited a downward trend. The total number of confirmed new cases reached 13,436 on

150

February 12 due to the inclusion of clinically diagnosed cases (Wei et al., 2020), resulting in a

151

new delayed peak in the figure.

152

The national emergency response has delayed the spread of the epidemic and greatly limited

153

its range. The suspension of intra-city public transport, the closure of entertainment venues and

154

the banning of public gatherings have been linked to a reduction in the incidence of cases.

155

Studies have shown that before emergency response initiation, the basic case reproduction

156

number (R0) is 3.15, and after intervention measures were implemented in 95% of all places, the

157

average R0 value has dropped to 0.04, the total number of actual cases has decreased 96% (Tian

158

et al., 2020).

159
160

3.4. The temporal evolution of the NO2 concentration and the total number of newly confirmed

161

cases in the COVID-19-hit areas globally.

162

After the countries severely affected by COVID-19 implemented strict lockdown measures,

163

satellite data showed a significant decline in NO2 emissions, and the total confirmed new cases

164

decreased after two weeks in most areas (Fig. 4). As a result, the strict lockdown of

165

COVID-19-hit areas other than those in China is also effective and easy to implement to prevent

166

the spread of the virus. The lockdown measures might have already prevented tens of thousands

167

of deaths in Europe (Flaxman et al., 2020). In Italy, where the epidemic is widespread, after the

168

lockdown the NO2 emissions significantly decreased by an average of 36.6%, and the total

169

confirmed new cases reached an inflection point 12 days later, thus verifying that the spread of

170

the virus was effectively controlled. Studies have shown that 38,000 deaths have been averted in

171

this country due to the implemented intervention measures (Flaxman et al., 2020). The

172

occurrence time of the inflection point is mainly related to the magnitude of NO2 decline. In

173

France, NO2 declined less (27.1%), and the time for the total number of confirmed new cases to

174

reach an inflection point was delayed. In Germany, the NO2 emissions decreased the most, by

175

54.7%, and the total number of confirmed new cases reached an inflection point within 8 days

176

after lockdown, which occurred earlier than in other countries. For Iran and Switzerland, due to

177

the relatively low number of confirmed cases, with the decline of NO2 after the strict control,

178

confirmed new cases also reached the inflection point earlier. In the the worst-affected states,

179

United States, NO2 emissions decreased by an average of 43.1% in New York, Washington and

180

California, and the total confirmed new cases dropped significantly, showing signs of easing.

181
182

3.5. The results after epidemic control in the COVID-19-hit areas globally.

183

Following the implementation of strict epidemic control measures, the newly confirmed

184

cases dropped by more than 50% within 30 days and NO2 declined significantly in most

185

countries (Figure 5a). Especially in most countries in Europe and the Western Pacific region, the

186

number of newly confirmed cases dropped more markedly, with an average drop of more than

187

60%. The newly confirmed cases in Ireland, Austria, Japan fell by more than 80%. The reduction

188

in the number of newly confirmed cases is closely related to the intensity of interventions, and

189

NO2 can quantify the effects and intensity of interventions. Among the top 50 countries with the

190

cumulative number of confirmed cases, the stricter the control measures, the higher the rate of

191

decrease in newly confirmed cases (Figure 5b). If the NO2 reduction rate is only about 25%, the

192

control effect of government intervention measures on the epidemic situation is not significant

193

(Figure 5b).

194

In Germany, when large public events were canceled, the spreading rate ( λ ) dropped from

195

0.43 to 0.25. When schools, childcare facilities, and many stores were closed, λ dropped to 0.15.

196

Only when a contact ban was imposed by government authorities, λ dropped to 0.09, which is

197

lower than the recovery speed, and the exponential growth of new cases turned to decline

198

(Dehning et al., 2020). In Wuhan, China, due to the strict lockdown, the estimated effective

199

reproduction number Rt fell immediately after reaching a peak of 3.82 on January 24 and fell

200

below 1.0 on February 6, 2020 (NO2 mutation time) (Pan et al., 2020). In summary, stringent

201

interventions help to reduce newly confirmed cases earlier and more rapidly. NO2 can be used as

202

an environmental indicator for quantitative research to assess the efficacy and timing of

203

non-pharmacological interventions to guide current and future responses to global pandemics.

204
205

4. Discussion

206

Urbanization and rapid transportation system development accelerate the spread of

207

COVID-19, and only strict containment measures can effectively prevent a second and third

208

outbreak (Huang et al., 2020b; Huang et al, 2020c). The NO2 concentration can be considered an

209

inexpensive indicator of virus transmission control. As a result of strict control measures and the

210

rapid implementation of first-level emergency measures, the NO2 emissions and total number

211

confirmed new cases significantly decreased in China, especially in the strictly controlled cities.

212

In many European countries, a strict lockdown is also effective and easy to do to prevent the

213

spread of the virus. But there are also areas such as southern and northern Spain and parts of the

214

United States where the NO2 level has increased.

215

Studies have shown that the likelihood of fewer cases in the gradual multi-stage policy is

216

zero, and that such a policy decision implies that the government is willing to risk an increase in

217

COVID19 cases and deaths in exchange for decreased economic and isolation impacts, which

218

may not be desirable from an objective point of view (Karnon, 2020). Although the immediate

219

adoption of a lockdown policy may lead to many people being adversely affected financially, in

220

the short term, the number of new confirmed cases will decline approximately 15 days after

221

policy implementation, and an earlier decline can occur with stricter lockdown measures.

222

International guidance supports a range of mandatory social isolation measures, extensive case

223

detection, and isolation and contact tracing. Compliance with quarantine directives is absolutely

224

critical to saving lives, protecting the most vulnerable in society, and ensuring that the national

225

security system can cope and care for the sick (Iacobucci, 2020). In such cases, an immediate

226

lockdown policy may be preferred, and NO2, as an environmental indicator of virus control, can

227

help managers implement effective control measured to curb the spread of COVID-19. In

228

addition, NO2 evolution can be used to predict the COVID-19 newly confirmed cases, using the

229

local NO2 change rate to reflect the effects of the control measures of governments in various

230

countries. For details, please refer to the Global Prediction System of the COVID-19 Pandemic

231

5. Conclusion

and intensity of epidemic control measures. The decline rate of NO2 is influenced by the

238

emission characteristics of each country, on the other hand, it is largely related to the intensity

239

and implementation effect of control measures. Therefore, NO2 can be used as an environmental

240

indicator to quantify the effectiveness and intensity of interventions and can be incorporated into

241

assessments of the implementation of existing outbreak control measures in countries and into

242

prediction of future scenarios and case numbers. In addition, NO2 would help provide

243

policymakers with information on strengthening, easing and selecting appropriate measures to

244

contain COVID-19 and other future global pandemics.

Fig. 1 The improvement rate of the major pollutants and the distribution of the
he
accumulated epidemic numbers in each city of Hubei Province after the lockdown. One
ne
month after the blockade (23 February 2020), the cumulative number of confirmed cases ranged
ed
from 0-46607 (Wuhan), as indicated by the colour scale. The monthly mean improvement rate of
NO2, SO2, PM10, CO and PM2.5 after the lockdown in the worst virus-affected areas is shown in
the histogram, with SO2, PM10, CO and PM2.5 indicated with blue columns, and NO2 indicated
ed
with red columns. Red columns (NO2) are significantly higher than the others, so it can
an
characterize the locking measures.
