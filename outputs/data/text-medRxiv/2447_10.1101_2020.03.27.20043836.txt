Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) quickly became
a major epidemic threat in the whole China. We analysed SARS-Cov-2 infected
cases from Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and noted divergent characteristics
of these Tibetans infected cases compared to Han Chinese, characterizing by a
considerable proportion of asymptomatic carriers (21.7%), and few symptomatic
patients with initial symptom of fever (7.7%). Here, we did a descriptive study on
clinical characteristics of 18 asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2
infection. The median age of these asymptomatic carriers was 31 years and one
third of them were students, aged under 20 years. Notably, some of asymptomatic
carriers had recognizable changes in radiological and laboratory indexes. Our
finding indicates a potentially big number of SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic carriers
in prevalent area, highlighting a necessity of screening individuals with close
contact of infected patients, for a better control on the spread of SARS-CoV-2
infection.

In December 2019, the infection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-Cov-2) was initially emerged in Wuhan. It quickly became a major epidemic
threat in the whole China[1]. Like other parts of China, Sichuan is a province affected
by imported cases, and had its first confirmed 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
patient reported on 21st January. Later, a county named Daofu in Ganzi Tibetan
Autonomous Prefecture in western Sichuan province experienced an outbreak of SARSCov-2 infection in February. Particularly, Ganzi is renowned as a hypoxic plateau area
and the population there is made up of mainly Tibetans. Therefore, patients in Ganzi by
nature have different geographic and ethnic characteristics compared to patients in
many other regions of China. Indeed, in our previous analyses of 83 cases with
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection collected from a
local hospital, we noted divergent characteristics of Tibetans infected cases,
characterizing by a considerable proportion of asymptomatic carriers (18/83, 21.7% ),
and few symptomatic patients with initial symptom of fever (5/65, 7.7%). In present

research, we did a descriptive study on clinical characteristics of 18 asymptomatic
individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods
We conducted a retrospective, single-centre study based on the People’s Hospital of
Daofu county. More than 90% of locally confirmed infected cases were recruited
between 26th Jan and 28th February 2020. We defined asymptotic infected cases as the
ones who got positive results on PCR test for SARS-Cov-2 infection but without any
clinical symptoms during the whole surveillance period. Information on
epidemiological, demographic characteristics, clinical features, treatment, and outcome
were extracted from patients’ medical records. Clinical data were followed up until 6th
March, 2020. The study was approved by West China Hospital Ethics Committee
(reference no.2020-190) and written informed consent was obtained from patients in
People’s Hospital of Daofu county before enrolment.

Results
18 (18/83, 21.7%) individuals were identified as asymptomatic carriers, with a
predominant distribution of males (61.0%) (Table 1). The median age was 31 years and
one third of the asymptomatic individuals were students, aged under 20 years. Only 1
infected people (5.6%) had pre-existed chronic illness. Epidemiological data showed all
the infection were caused by community transmission. Notably, some of asymptomatic
carriers had recognizable changes in radiological and laboratory indexes. 7(38.9%)
cases had abnormalities in chest computed tomography (CT), representing as unilateral
or bilateral patchy shadowing or/and ground-glass opacity (Table 1). 9(50.0%),
7(38.8%), and 15(83.3%) cases obtained abnormal results in tests of blood routine,

coagulation function, and blood biochemistry, respectively (details shown in Table 2).
All asymptomatic carriers received antiviral treatment and were charged at the time of
data analysis. The average duration of hospital stay was 13 days.

Discussions
To our knowledge, this is the first descriptive study specifically focusing on a
group of asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that in
Tibetan population, asymptomatic carriers were mainly young or middle-aged healthy
individuals, with their infections disappeared after antiviral treatment. Importantly,
although no clinical symptoms, many of them have typically viral pneumonia-like
changes in chest CT images and abnormal laboratory measures.
The possible abnormal findings on chest CT images among asymptomatic
carriers got support from one previous report[2]. However, the common abnormalities
in blood tests was never described before[2-4]. Also, it is notable that there is a
considerable proportion of asymptomatic carriers among our study population (21.7%),
which was much higher than the rate reported previously (5%)[5]. This may due to a
high screening rate for individuals with exposure history in Ganzi area. Alternatively,
the genetic variations between Han Chinese and Tibetans may be attributable for these
differences.
The major merits of our study include a sufficient follow-up period and a high
coverage rate of all individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection in study area. Our finding
indicates a potentially big number of SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic carriers in prevalent
area, highlighting a necessity of screening individuals with close contact of infected
patients, for a better control on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
