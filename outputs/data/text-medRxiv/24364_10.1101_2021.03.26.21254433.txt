Abstract
Increasing acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines is imperative for public health, as unvaccinated
individuals may impede the ability to reach herd immunity. Previous research on educational
interventions to overcome vaccine hesitancy have shown mixed effects in increasing vaccination
intention, although much of this work has focused on parental attitudes toward childhood
vaccination. In this study, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to investigate whether
vaccination intention changes after viewing an animated YouTube video explaining how COVID19 mRNA vaccines work. We exposed participants to one of four interventions – watching the video
with a male narrator, watching the same video with a female narrator, reading the text of the
transcript of the video, or receiving no information (control group). We found that participants who
watched the version of the video with a male narrator expressed statistically significant increased
vaccination intention compared to the control group. The video with a female narrator had more
variation in results. As a whole, there was a non-significant increased vaccination intention when
analyzing all participants who saw the video with a female narrator; however, for politically
conservative participants there was decreased vaccination intention for this intervention,
particularly at a threshold between being currently undecided and expressing probable interest.
These results are encouraging for the ability of interventions as simple as YouTube videos to
increase vaccination propensity, although the inconsistent response to the video with a female
narrator demonstrates the potential for bias to affect how certain groups respond to different
messengers.
Significance Statement
Widespread vaccination is important for ending the COVID-19 pandemic. This study investigates
whether communicating the science behind new COVID-19 vaccines can increase people’s
willingness to get vaccinated. We examined the effectiveness of an eight-minute animated video
explaining how COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work, varying between a male narrator, a female
narrator, and a control group. Participants who saw the video with a male narrator expressed a
greater intent to get vaccinated than the control group. Participants who saw the video with a female
narrator had more varied responses, including a decreased intent to get vaccinated among political
conservatives. These findings indicate that science education may help increase vaccine uptake,
but that beliefs about gender may influence how people receive such information.
Main Text
Introduction
Even before COVID-19 became a pandemic in 2020, vaccine hesitancy was considered a top
global health threat by the World Health Organization (1). At the time this study was performed, in
February 2021, Emergency Use Authorization had been issued by the United States Food and
Drug Administration for two mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) for the prevention of
COVID-19, representing a tremendous public health success in their high efficacy and in the speed
of their development. While vaccine production and access have been rapidly increasing in the
United States and worldwide throughout the spring of 2021, overcoming vaccine hesitancy to
achieve high rates of vaccine uptake may be important for achieving herd immunity (2, 3). Although
studies have found that COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy has declined during the vaccine roll out (4),
rates of vaccine hesitancy still remain concerningly high, particularly when unvaccinated individuals
may pose a risk to members of society who are unable to be vaccinated (5). Therefore, research

to collect empirical evidence on the effect of interventions to increase vaccination intention is
needed.
This study examines an eight-minute, animated, educational YouTube video on the COVID-19
mRNA vaccines that we made called “COVID mRNA vaccines explained.” The video explains how
the mRNA vaccine platforms work, highlights some of the positive features of the COVID-19 mRNA
vaccines such as high efficacy and rarity of serious side effects, and emphasizes the altruism of
vaccination. While the lack of editorial oversight of health information on YouTube and other social
media platforms has contributed to the spread of vaccine misinformation and disinformation (6,7,8),
YouTube videos could constitute an attractive tool for public health campaigns as they are easily
disseminated through existing websites and social media platforms (9). Given the novelty of the
COVID-19 vaccine platforms, and the urge to help end the pandemic through promoting
vaccination, there are many health professionals, professors, and others who have been making
and posting vaccine explainer videos for YouTube and other social media platforms such as Tiktok.
However, there is little evidence about whether creating and sharing such videos is worthwhile: do
these efforts actually affect vaccination propensity? Previous research on web-based educational
interventions to increase vaccine acceptance, focused largely on parental attitudes toward
childhood vaccinations, has found mixed results (10-12) – some studies found evidence of
increased intention to vaccinate (13,14), some found no effect or effects that were not statistically
significant (15,16), and some even reported a backfire effect wherein the intervention decreased
vaccination intention (17,18). The prior literature highlights the need to continue such studies to
identify effective interventions for overcoming vaccine hesitancy (11,19-21).
Herein we present the results of a randomized controlled trial conducted with 1,184 Mechanical
Turk participants to investigate the effect on vaccination intention of an animated YouTube video
explaining how the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work. We investigated whether the exact same
information presented in different formats would alter the efficacy of the communication by exposing
treatment groups to either: a) watching the video with a male narrator (Male-Narr-Video
https://youtu.be/Fv5bs4SPiYE), b) watching the same video with a female narrator (Female-NarrVideo https://youtu.be/j3hTeDyvgPs), c) reading a blog post containing the text of the transcript of
the video, or d) receiving no information to serve as a control group. The visuals and scripts for
both versions of the videos were identical; only the voice of the narrator differed. The results
showed statistically significant higher vaccination intention in the group that watched the Male-NarrVideo compared to the control group, a robust association for a variety of alternative specifications.
However, despite participants rating the quality of instruction of both the Male-Narr-Video and
Female-Narr-Video equally highly, we found less consistent associations on intention to vaccinate
for participants exposed to the Female-Narr-Video intervention. As a whole, the Female-Narr-Video
produced a non-significant increase in vaccination intention compared to the control group.
However, the impact on vaccination intention of the Female-Narr-Video varied by political identity
of the participants. Political conservatives who were exposed to the Female-Narr-Video were less
likely to express probable or definite interest in getting vaccinated than both other respondents
exposed to the Female-Narr-Video and conservatives exposed to no information in the control
group. Adjusting for this conditional association showed that for respondents who did not identify
as politically conservative, both videos associated with increased vaccine intention at much closer
rates, no matter the narrator. No such conditioning among political conservatives was observed for
participants exposed to the Male-Narr-Video. Although further research is warranted to investigate
the variation in efficacy based on the gender of the narrator, overall, this evidence supports the
idea that educational YouTube videos, such as the Male-Narr-Video, may serve as an easy to
share, simple way to increase vaccination intention.
Video development. The YouTube video was made by LSW in December 2020, shortly after the
issuance of Emergency Use Authorizations by the United States Food and Drug Association for
the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines for COVID-19, which are both mRNA vaccines. The

programs Biorender and Vyond were used to create the video, which uses animations and cartoon
characters to illustrate educational points about how the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work. The
video begins with a review of the central dogma of biology, then explains how weakened virus
vaccines work before explaining what an mRNA vaccine means. The video then emphasizes that
the Pfizer-BioNTech (referred to as Pfizer in the video) and Moderna vaccines have been tested
for safety and efficacy, and ends with an explanation of how getting vaccinated can protect others
in society. Previous research on vaccine hesitancy interventions has identified common features
for successful communication. This video incorporates many of these features, including: i) The
video emphasizes the messages that approved vaccines are safe and go through evaluations (9),
and that immunization also protects others, which has been found to activate positive emotions (2).
ii) The video does not focus on messages that have been reported to impede efforts to diminish
vaccine hesitancy such as myth-busting, fear-based, or numerically focused messages (10). iii)
The video creates clear bottom-line (gist) messages through explanations of concepts in simple
language rather than scientific jargon, the use of animated illustrations to visually reinforce the
concepts explained verbally, and the use of text on the screen to underscore take-home messages.
The Fuzzy-Trace theory of medical decision making has found that gist messages contribute to
decision-making in a meaningful way relative to statistics and verbatim information (6, 7,10) and
previous research on vaccine communication has found that articles with gist were shared on social
media more than those without (22).
Some characteristics of the video are not as directly tied to recommendations from previous
literature on vaccine interventions, partly because there is not yet much evidence on interventions
specific for the COVID-19 vaccines. In some respects, the unique characteristics of the COVID-19
vaccine may alleviate some of the attitudes that have contributed to parental vaccine hesitancy for
childhood vaccinations. For instance, it has been hypothesized that the benefits of some
vaccinations may not seem tangible due to unfamiliarity with the harm of the preventable disease
(9,23), which may be less likely for COVID-19. However, there are new concerns particular to
COVID-19 vaccines that have been reported (2,21), and the video does address some of these,
including unease over the new vaccine platforms that have not been used before, and concern over
the speed of the vaccine development and approval (the video does not go into all of the details
that contributed to the rapid vaccine development but does explain that the mRNA platform may
allow quicker vaccine development than weakened virus platforms). Although previous research
has shown that vaccine hesitancy is often more complex than a simple knowledge deficit (10,19),
the overall tone of the video is an educational approach to influencing vaccination attitudes because
in the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, the lack of knowledge about the new vaccine platform
contribute to hesitancy.
Previous research has indicated that the messaging matters in addition to the message (24,25),
and has recommended that vaccine interventions use an enthusiastic tone (10) and establish the
public health educator as an expert (7). In this video, background music is used to create an
engaging and enthusiastic tone. Although the video does not specify the credentials of the creator,
the survey participants were told that the video was created by a college biochemistry professor.
This study tests the effectiveness of a video that draws upon the best evidence in the vaccine
hesitancy intervention literature for the message (information content) and messaging (style of
communication) of vaccine communications, and additionally allows us to study whether there may
be different patterns of effectiveness based on the messenger (the person who delivers the
message). Since the narrator is never depicted in the video, we saw the video as a platform to
isolate and test the effects of a single variable related to the messenger: the gender of the narrator’s
voice. Therefore, two versions were used in the study, identical but for the voice of the narrator: the
Female-Narr-Video version had a female voice reading the transcript and the Male-Narr-Video
version had a male voice. In both cases the timing of the narration was matched to the animations
(which led to a 3 second difference in length of the videos). The Female-Narr-Video was the original
version created in December 2020 for educational purposes (although the title slide and link on
YouTube were changed for this study), and the Male-Narr-Video was created later as an additional

experimental condition. In other words, the creation of the Female-Narr-Video was independent of
the idea of testing whether narrator gender might associate with its effectiveness; only after
receiving positive anecdotal feedback on the original video did we decide to study the efficacy of
such variations.
Survey design. Participants completed a survey to measure COVID-19 vaccination intention,
attitudes, and understanding. Many of the survey items were similar to validated items from the
literature, with some adaptations since many of the previous scales of vaccine hesitancy have been
used to measure parental attitudes towards childhood vaccinations (26). Using the Qualtrics survey
platform, participants were randomly equally distributed into one of 4 paths: In paths 1, 2, and 3 the
consent information page was followed by a page where participants watched the Male-Narr-Video,
the Female-Narr-Video, or read the text of the video transcript presented as a blog post. On each
of these pages, the time the participants spent on the page was recorded and advancing to the
next page was disabled for a few minutes (approximately for half of the length of the video and two
minutes for the approximately 1,200 word text) to increase the likelihood that participants engaged
the material. After the information was presented in the video or text format, the participants
encountered a section with questions that first asked about their intent to get vaccinated and then
asked about their attitudes concerning the COVID-19 vaccines. The participants in the 4th path did
not receive any information and went directly to the vaccine intention and attitudes section. The
vaccination intention item was based on the Imperial College London “Global attitudes towards a
COVID-19 vaccine” survey (4) and asked “If a COVID-19 vaccine were made available to you this
week, would you get it?” Response categories were: (1) Definitely no; (2) Probably no; (3)
Undecided as of now; (4) Probably yes; (5) Definitely yes; and (6) I already got one or more dose
of a COVID19 vaccine. This section also included questions on multiple domains related to vaccine
hesitancy attitudes: a) perceptions of vaccine safety and efficacy, b) trust in medical, scientific,
governmental and pharmaceutical authorities, c) common vaccine misconceptions and d)
understanding of elements of vaccination (see SI for full survey questions)†. The next section of the
survey asked about characteristics of the video or blog post, which included an attention check
question, questions about the enjoyment of the video/blog post, and how likely participants would
be to share it on social media, and was only shown to paths 1-3. This section also asked
participants to rate the quality of instruction by the narrator and on the narrator’s trustworthiness,
comfort and knowledge. All paths of the survey then went to a block of demographic questions and
ended with a code to enter for payment on Amazon Mechanical Turk.
Experimental set up. The survey was administered to 1,632 participants on Amazon Mechanical
Turk on February 25th and 26th, 2021 when the two approved COVID-19 vaccines in the United
States were the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines. The only worker qualification
required was that the Turk worker be located in the United States. Mechanical Turk is well-validated
and considered a reliable source for survey data (27-29). The pay was $5, based on a $15/h wage
and a 20-minute estimate of the average completion time. The study was approved by the
Macalester College Institutional Review Board (Approval #022103). Participants were provided with
consent information at the beginning of the study, although signed consent forms were not collected
to preserve the anonymity of the participants. The dataset used for this analysis is available in the
SI Appendix. Unless otherwise noted, the exclusion criteria that were applied were: exclusion of
participants who had indicated they had already been vaccinated, exclusion of participants who
answered the attention check question incorrectly, and exclusion of participants who spent less
than 7 min on the video page (for a 7 min 37 sec video) or who spent less than 2 min 5 sec on the
blog post page (which excluded a similar percentage of people for spending insufficient time as
were excluded for insufficient time for the video exposures). These exclusion criteria resulted in n
†

As the most direct measure of vaccine hesitancy is the vaccination intent survey item, the analyses in this
paper focus on the responses to that question. Subsequent research may examine the other survey items in
greater depth.

group, and n = 393 for the control group.
Results and discussion:
Data treatment. Since vaccination attitudes exist on a continuum with anti-vaccine refusal on one
end, active demand on the other, and uncertainty and hesitation in the middle (30,31), we
considered vaccine intention as a continuum rather than a simple hesitant/intent binary.
Additionally, following previous research, we considered the possibility that the effects of an
intervention may differ at distinct parts of the continuum (31). This presumption of asymmetric
effects is also consistent with the idea that vaccine intent could be conceived as a series of stages,
separated by thresholds, as noted in health research (32). Given this understanding, we modeled
how exposure to each intervention associated with vaccine intention by using partial proportional
odds models with the gologit2 program in Stata using the program’s autofit option (33,34). These
models preserve the order across the categories of vaccine intent while also allowing for either a
single coefficient for a variable across the different levels of intent or for separate coefficients for
each level of intent. Thus, some variables may associate with a consistent change in moving from
one level to the next level of vaccine intention across different levels of the continuum, while other
variables may have asymmetric associations, such as varying levels of intensity or direction at
different levels of vaccine intention. The findings discussed below were robust to a variety of
alternative specifications, as described in the SI Appendix.
Although participants were randomly assigned to treatment conditions, we included a series of
control variables (respondents’ race/ethnicity, gender, political ideology, age, and education) in our
models that may associate with vaccine intention. Mechanical Turk respondents are a diverse, but
not nationally representative group (28) (see Supplemental Table 1 for the frequency of these
variables). We excluded variables for which there were no significant associations in the
multivariate models for the sake of parsimony. We first estimated a model with the treatment
variables and control variables (Model 1), and then estimated a model testing whether the
association between Female-Narr-Video and vaccine intent varied based on respondents
identifying as conservative (Model 2). Table 1 shows the results from these two models. In both
models, the race/ethnicity variables are Black and Native American compared to all others who
identify as neither. While some studies suggest that Hispanic/Latinx individuals may exhibit lower
vaccine intent (35,36), and while Black, Indigenous, and Hispanic/Latinx populations have all
experienced histories of medical abuse that may decrease current medical trust (37,38), we found
no association between Hispanic/Latinx and vaccine intent in our analysis.‡ In addition, we included
separate variables for people who described themselves as politically conservative and people who
described themselves as politically liberal, comparing them to those identified politically as neither
conservative nor liberal (political moderates and those who identify as something else). While trust
in science is politicized, studies find differences in how political identities relate to such trust (41,42).
Although political liberals may generally trust science more than others (42), conservatives may
express greater distrust than others, linked more to cultural division and collective identity (43,44),
suggesting that both groups should be examined in relation to moderates and others.
Findings. Model 1 shows a positive association between having been exposed to the Male-NarrVideo and vaccination intent, consistent across all levels of intent. Compared to the control group
‡

This finding of no association between Latinx/Hispanic respondents and vaccine intent may be due to
within-group variability that both associates with intent and decreases the likelihood of performing
Mechanical Turk work tasks (39). Additionally, these models may account for some of the within-group
variation, since 9% of in-sample respondents who identified at Latinx/Hispanic also identified as Black or
Native American; previous research finds of visible markers of African and indigenous ancestry (40) can
associate with health-related differences among Latinx/Hispanic people.

given no information, respondents who watched the Male-Narr-Video were more likely to express
vaccination intention as measured by their response to the question how likely they would be to
receive a COVID-19 vaccine if it were available to them this week (coefficient = 0.440, p = 0.005).
Figure 1 illustrates the substantive meaning of these coefficients by displaying predicted
probabilities for a respondent who is white, male, politically moderate, under 55, and with at least
a B.A. degree in each of the four experimental conditions (45). Such a respondent exposed to the
Male-Narr-Video would have a predicted probability of 53.5% of replying “definitely yes” for their
intention to be vaccinated, compared to a predicted probability of 42.6% for the control group.
Those exposed to the text intervention had a much smaller, statistically insignificant increase in
vaccination intention compared to the control group (coefficient = 0.168, p = 0.278). The pattern for
respondents exposed to the Female-Narr-Video intervention, however, had a more nuanced
pattern, as there were asymmetric associations across the different levels of vaccine intent.
Although outside of the standard cut-off for statistical significance, those exposed to the FemaleNarr-Video had a greater likelihood of answering “definitely yes” to getting the vaccine compared
to the control group (coefficient = 0.304, p = 0.073), albeit to a lesser degree than those exposed
the Male-Narr-Video. Again, although not statistically significant, the negative coefficient for
expressing a response with higher intention to vaccinate than “undecided” among those exposed
to the Female-Narr-Video is striking (coefficient = –0.144, p = 0.429). This pattern suggests that
there may have been heterogeneous effects of being exposed to the female video, which we tested
in Model 2.
In Model 2, we added a variable testing for a conditional association between respondents who are
politically conservative and viewed the Female-Narr-Video. The interaction term tests whether
exposure to the video with the female narrator had different effects for people who identify as
conservative than for those who do not identify as conservative. Political conservatives in the US
have been found to have lower vaccine propensity, linked in part to patterns of trust in expertise
(46). Specifically, conservatives often see science as needing to conform to beliefs about religious
authority and common sense (44), which also provide similar bases for beliefs about hierarchical,
traditional gender relations (47). Given the persistence of beliefs about gender and scientific ability
(48-51) and findings that violating traditional gender beliefs can induce negative reactions,
particularly among political conservatives (52), we test the possibility that the gender of the person
delivering a message may affect how the message reaches political conservatives.
The addition of the politically conservative x Female-Narr-Video interaction variable showed that
the main effect of the Female-Narr-Video for non-conservative respondents was a positive
association consistent across levels of intent on the margin of statistical significance (coefficient =
0.374, p = 0.051). The magnitude of the coefficient is closer to the Male-Narr-Video (coefficient =
0.440, p = 0.005) than it was in Model 1 for any of the levels of intent, although the larger standard
error for the Female-Narr-Video does suggest more heterogeneity remaining in the effect of the
Female-Narr-Video. The interaction term shows a notable significant negative association for
conservatives exposed to the Female-Narr-Video being less likely to express a vaccination
intention greater than the “uncertain” response (coefficient = -0.971, p =.002) when compared to
either conservatives in another of the experimental or control conditions or to others exposed to
the Female-Narr-Video. In other words, among political conservatives, exposure to the video with
a female narrator seemed to decrease the propensity of getting to a yes response (whether
“probably yes” or “definitely yes”) for the vaccine when compared to political conservatives who
viewed the Male-Narr-Video and even the control group.
Although the Female-Narr-Video had a backfire effect for conservatives, for other respondents the
male- and female-narrated videos had relatively similar associations with increasing vaccination
intention. These patterns are illustrated in Figure 2, which compares the predicted probabilities for
a white, male participant, under the age of 55, with at least a BA, varying both the treatment and
political ideology (comparing conservative to moderate). The figure shows that there is a negligible
difference in predicted probabilities for a moderate or conservative exposed to the Male-Narr-Video

of having either a “definitely yes” or “probably yes” response (83.0% and 81.4% respectively). The
same comparison for the Female-Narr-Video shows a substantially wider gap (82.1% for
moderates, 60.6% for conservatives). Notably, the predicted probability for a conservative exposed
to the Female-Narr-Video to reply to the vaccination intention question with “definitely yes” or
“probably yes” (60.6%) is also substantially lower than for a conservative in the control group that
was not exposed to any information (73.7%). Tests for similar conditional effects for Male-NarrVideo on political conservatives showed no such conditional association (see SI Appendix). For
example, adding an additional interaction term for conservative x Male-Narr-Video to the variables
in Model 2 produced a coefficient with a near zero association (coefficient = -0.005, p = 0.987),
while not changing any substantive patterns reported in Table 2.
Perceptions of narrator quality. Despite the differences in effect on vaccination intention between
the Female-Narr-Video and Male-Narr-Video, participants as a whole rated the quality of instruction
in the two versions of the video equally highly. Contrary to previous research that has found that
when quality of instruction is measured on a 10-point scale, gender gaps in favor of men are wider,
particularly in male-dominated fields (53), there was an insignificant difference in the other direction
among respondents included in the analysis. In a bivariate model, respondents who saw the
Female-Narr-Video rated the quality of instruction 0.08 points higher, on average, on a 10-point
scale than those who saw the Male-Narr-Video (p = 0.406, see Supplemental Table 2). Although
conservatives rated the video about a quarter point lower than other respondents, there is no
evidence of conditioning of conservatives’ rating based on which version of the video they saw—
the nonsignificant coefficient for the interaction term between conservative and the Female-NarrVideo condition has a positive sign. The survey items on likelihood to share the video on social
media, and the trustworthiness, comfort, and knowledge of the narrator (Supplemental Figures 23) likewise do not show evidence of explicit bias between the male and female-narrated versions
of the video. Yet, the enhanced persuasive power of the Male-Narr-Video as seen in the increased
intention to vaccinate, particularly for political conservatives, may be evidence of bias against
women as sources of scientific authority, and is worthy of continued study.
Conclusion:
Widespread uptake of the COVID-19 vaccines worldwide is crucial for ending the COVID-19
pandemic. Previous work on vaccine hesitancy interventions have recommended that health
organizations use social media channels such as YouTube to spread pro-vaccination messages,
but caution that vaccine communications should first be tested (7, 19-21). Herein, we gathered
empirical evidence on the effect of an 8-minute animated educational COVID-19 mRNA vaccine
explainer video. We found that this video demonstrated a statistically significant association with
increasing vaccination propensity, but that the messenger matters – the video with a male narrator
had a robust association with increased vaccination intention, while the identical video with a female
narrator had much more uneven associations, part of which could be accounted for by
conservatives uniquely expressing uncertainty in vaccination intention after viewing that version of
the video. The video studied herein only addresses the mRNA vaccines and does not explain many
of the other vaccine questions and concerns people have. Future studies that follow up on the
theoretical implications of these data may further examine the ways that gender beliefs influence
how members of the public respond to communication about science and medicine, and help guide
interventions promoting vaccine uptake.
