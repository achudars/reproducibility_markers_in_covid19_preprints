Abstract

97
98

Objective

99

To compare survival of subjects with COVID-19 treated in hospitals that either did or did not

100

routinely treat patients with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.

101

Methods

102

We analysed data of COVID-19 patients treated in 9 hospitals in the Netherlands. Inclusion dates

103

ranged from February 27th 2020, to May 15th, when the Dutch national guidelines no longer

104

supported the use of (hydroxy)chloroquine. Seven hospitals routinely treated subjects with

105

(hydroxy)chloroquine, two hospitals did not. Primary outcome was 21-day all-cause mortality. We

106

performed a survival analysis using log-rank test and Cox-regression with adjustment for age, sex and

107

covariates based on premorbid health, disease severity, and the use of steroids for adult respiratory

108

distress syndrome, including dexamethasone.

109

Results

110

Among 1893 included subjects, 21-day mortality was 23.4% in 1552 subjects treated in hospitals that

111

routinely prescribed (hydroxy)chloroquine, and 17.0% in 341 subjects that were treated in hospitals

112

that did not. In the adjusted Cox-regression models this difference disappeared, with an adjusted

113

hazard ratio of 1.17 (95%CI 0.88-1.55). When stratified by actually received treatment in individual

114

subjects, the use of (hydroxy)chloroquine was associated with an increased 21-day mortality (HR

115

1.58; 95%CI 1.25-2.01) in the full model.

116

Conclusions

117

After adjustment for confounders, mortality was not significantly different in hospitals that routinely

118

treated patients with (hydroxy)chloroquine, compared with hospitals that did not. We compared

119

outcomes of hospital strategies rather than outcomes of individual patients to reduce the chance of

120

indication bias. This study adds evidence against the use of (hydroxy)chloroquine in patients with

121

COVID-19.

Introduction

123
124

The spread of SARS-CoV-2, leading to the current pandemic of COVID-19, has a profound global

125

impact on daily life, morbidity and mortality. Several preliminary studies have reported that the

126

antimalarial agents hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, or (H)CQ, alone or in combination with the

127

antibiotic azithromycin, can have a suppressive effect on the viral replication, and might decrease the

128

mortality of COVID-191-4. So far, clinical studies have been hampered by (indication) bias1,2,4,

129

monocentre setup2,3, small numbers of included subjects3, and concerns about the verifiability of

130

data, even leading to withdrawal of a publication 4. Side effects of (H)CQ are well-known and

131

common, and include fever and cardiac arrhythmias. Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) are

132

currently being conducted to investigate the effect of (H)CQ on outcome of COVID-19. While we are

133

awaiting definite results from RCTs, cohort studies can provide quick closure of existing knowledge

134

gaps. When treatment assignment in cohort studies is based on prescriber discretion, the risk of

135

indication bias (even after covariate adjustment) remains high. However, our database of Dutch

136

hospitals contains data of subjects from hospitals that either routinely prescribed (H)CQ or did not

137

prescribe it at all, offering a unique opportunity to compare both strategies. The comparison of

138

different treatment strategies among hospitals leads to a significant reduction of (indication) bias.

139

The objective of this study was to compare the effect of hospital-wide COVID-19 treatment strategies

140

with or without routine (H)CQ use on all-cause 21-day mortality.

144

Methods

145
146

We used data from the ongoing CovidPredict Clinical Course Cohort containing over 2,000 persons

147

with COVID-195, from 9 hospitals in the Netherlands, including two tertiary care hospitals. Included in

148

the database were all subjects admitted to hospital with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR of nasopharynx,

149

throat, sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage samples, or CT-scan abnormalities that were typical for

150

COVID-19 (CO-RADS 4 and 5)6, without another explanation for the abnormalities than COVID-19.

151

Inclusion dates ranged from the first admitted case in the Netherlands on February 27th 2020, to May

152

15th, when the Dutch national guidelines no longer advised the use of (H)CQ. We excluded patients <

153

18 years and patients who were transferred to or from another hospital. Dosage of chloroquine base

154

was: loading dose of 600 mg, followed by 300 mg twice a day for a total of 5 days. Dosage of

155

hydroxychloroquine sulphate was 400 mg twice daily on the first day, followed by 200 mg twice daily

156

on days 2 to 5. Among the seven (H)CQ-hospitals, the timing of start of (H)CQ treatment differed;

157

three hospitals started at the moment of COVID-19 diagnosis, four started after diagnosis but only

158

when patients clinically deteriorated e.g., when there was an increase in respiratory rate or increase

159

in use of supplemental oxygen. The two hospitals that did not routinely treat subjects with (H)CQ

160

(i.e., the non-(H)CQ-hospitals), offered best supportive care, including oxygen therapy and

161

potentially antibiotic therapy, according to local guidelines and prescriber discretion. Participating

162

hospitals did not routinely prescribe other experimental medication (e.g., lopinavir/ritonavir,

163

remdesivir or steroids, see Table 1). Subjects who were incidentally treated with these drugs were

164

included in the study. Primary outcome was 21-day all-cause mortality, defined as hospital mortality,

165

or discharge to a hospice care facility. A waiver for the use of hospital record data was obtained

166

through the Institutional Review Board of Amsterdam UMC; however, patients were given the

167

opportunity to opt out. In the primary analysis, we compared effectiveness of (H)CQ versus non-

168

(H)CQ hospital strategies, irrespective of actual individual (H)CQ treatment. We performed a survival

169

analysis using log-rank test and Cox-regression with adjustment for age, sex and covariates based on

premorbid health (i.e., history of lung, kidney and cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity,

171

and neoplasms or hematologic disease), disease severity during presentation (respiratory rate,

172

oxygen saturation) and the use of steroids, including dexamethasone, for adult respiratory distress

173

syndrome (ARDS)7,8. We collected data according to the collection protocol of the World Health

174

Organization. Missing covariates were imputed using multiple imputation. As a sensitivity analysis,

175

we performed a complete case analysis using inverse probability weighting of propensity scores

176

(determined using the same covariates), and a subgroup analysis in hospitals who started (H)CQ from

177

the moment of diagnosis. Finally, we repeated the analyses comparing actually received treatment,

178

with (H)CQ. All statistical analyses were performed using R versions 3.6.3 (R Foundation, Vienna,

179

Austria).

180

181

Results

182
183

We analysed results of 1893 subjects admitted before May 15th 2020, 239 were excluded because

184

they were transferred from another hospital. Demographic data are shown in Table 1. Follow-up

185

data were missing for 28 (2.5%) subjects. In total, 1552 subjects were treated in hospitals where

186

(H)CQ was a standard part of treatment strategy ((H)CQ hospitals) and 341 in hospitals where (H)CQ

187

was not a standard part of treatment (non-(H)CQ hospitals). In (H)CQ-hospitals, 54.5% of the subjects

188

received (H)CQ, compared with 1.8% of the subjects in the non-(H)CQ-hospitals. Among the seven

189

(H)CQ-hospitals, two used hydroxychloroquine during the first half and chloroquine during the

190

second half of the epidemic, whereas five hospitals used chloroquine only. Subjects in (H)CQ-

191

hospitals were older (68 (SD: 14) vs 62 (SD: 15) years) and had a higher prevalence of chronic

192

pulmonary disease (27.7 vs 21.7%) than subjects in the non-(H)CQ-hospitals. Respiratory rate and

193

peripheral oxygen saturation during admission were similar in both hospital groups (see Table 1). In

194

(H)CQ-hospitals, 9.7% of subjects received corticosteroids for ARDS and 3.2% were in a study

protocol of an experimental SARS-CoV-2 directed antiviral (e.g., lopinavir/ritonavir) or

196

immunomodulatory drug trial (e.g., imatinib, anti-complement C5), versus 2.4% and 11.3% in non-

197

(H)CQ-hospitals, respectively. Figure 1 shows the survival of subjects in (H)CQ- versus non-(H)CQ-

198

hospitals. Unadjusted mortality at day 21 was significantly different between the (H)CQ- and non-

199

(H)CQ-hospitals (23.4% vs. 17.0%). However, in the adjusted Cox-regression models, this difference

200

disappeared, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.17 (95%CI 0.88-1.55, Table 2). The sensitivity analysis

201

of hospitals routinely starting (H)CQ treatment from the moment of COVID-19 diagnosis (i.e., (H)CQ

202

hospitals without the hospitals that initiated (H)CQ treatment upon clinical deterioration) compared

203

with non-(H)CQ-hospitals, showed similar results with a HR of 1.14 (95%CI 0.82-1.57) after

204

adjustment for age, sex, comorbidities, and disease severity at presentation. Complete case analysis

205

and the analysis using propensity scores showed similar results (see Table 3). Finally, when stratified

206

by actually received treatment, the use of (H)CQ was associated with an increased 21-day mortality

207

(HR 1.58; 95%CI 1.25-2.01, Table 3) in the full model. The sensitivity analysis of all hospitals and all

208

subjects can be found in Table 4.

Discussion

214
215

At first glance, our study results may seem to suggest that subjects treated in hospitals that routinely

216

prescribed (H)CQ had a significantly increased 21-day all-cause mortality compared with those in

217

hospitals that did not routinely prescribe (H)CQ. However, mortality was not significantly different

218

after adjustment for age, sex, medical history, disease severity at presentation and steroid use during

219

treatment. Similarly, we found an increased risk of death among subjects who had actually received

220

treatment with (H)CQ, which has likely been driven by indication bias, as in four of the seven (H)CQ-

221

hospitals, (H)CQ was only prescribed upon clinical deterioration. The unique characteristics of our

222

study cohort enabled a study design that minimized indication bias. Our results add further weight to

223

existing evidence against the use of (H)CQ for the treatment COVID-19.

224
225

The strength of this study is that data were collected in nine secondary and tertiary care hospitals in

226

the Netherlands during the COVID-19 epidemic. Data collection was set up prospectively and the

227

database included data on all consecutive subjects admitted to general medicine and pulmonology

228

wards, and to intensive care units. The database was set up according to the WHO standards, which

229

enabled data comparison and uniformity of data among the different participating centres. The

230

comparison of hospital-defined treatment strategies rather than the treatment actually received led

231

to a lower risk of indication bias compared with previous studies1,2. We roughly estimate the extend

232

of the effect of indication bias to be the difference in outcome between the uncorrected and the

233

corrected model. Further strengths include the multicentre setup2,3, as mentioned above, and the

234

relatively large numbers of included subjects3.

235
236

There are some limitations we need to address. Although health care in the Netherlands has a

237

homogeneous setup, there was some variability in standard protocols among the hospitals that could

238

have led to residual confounding. The two non-(H)CQ-hospitals were tertiary (academic) centres,

239

whereas the (H)CQ-hospitals comprised secondary care hospitals. Since we excluded subjects

240

transferred to and from other hospitals, the referral role of the tertiary care hospitals was minimized.

241

Furthermore, subjects in the (H)CQ hospitals were more likely to receive steroid treatment, while

242

subjects in the non-(H)CQ hospitals were more likely to receive other experimental

243

immunomodulatory drugs. The numbers of the individual types of medication were small, making it

244

impossible to draw conclusions from these differences. The results of the RECOVERY trial (publication

245

pending), suggested a lower mortality in patients treated with dexamethasone. Treatment with

246

dexamethasone could therefore have resulted in a lower mortality in the group of (H)CQ hospitals.

247

We did not find such an effect, even after correction in the full model. We also used extensive

248

covariate adjustments, using various methods to minimize influence of differences in patient

249

population among hospitals, and the similarity in outcomes between these methods is reassuring in

250

this regard. Finally, because not every subject in the (H)CQ-hospitals actually received (H)CQ, the

251

current efficacy estimate in our study is likely an underestimation of the true (H)CQ effect.

252

Performing an instrumental variable analysis would have provided an approximation of this true

253

effect, but because the current efficacy point estimates point toward harm rather than benefit of

254

(H)CQ, this likely would not have changed our conclusions.9

255
256

Despite the positive results of some studies resulting in widespread use of (H)CQ, our study did not

257

show a benefit of (H)CQ treatment. This may be explained by the timing of the administration of the

258

drug and its specific working mechanism. Chloroquine binds in silico and in vitro with high affinity to

259

sialic acids and gangliosides of SARS-CoV-2. These bindings inhibit the interaction at non-toxic plasma

260

levels with ACE-2 receptors and could hypothetically stop the cascade from formation of pulmonary

261

infiltrations to full blown ARDS and death10-12. The antiviral activity might be more effective in the

262

pre-clinical setting as the deterioration in the hospital is more an effect of the cytokine storm

263

provoked by SARS-CoV-2 than an effect of the viral infection itself. This hypothesis might explain why

264

the clinical benefit for admitted subjects was absent in our study, although we did not observe a

265

difference in outcome among subjects treated early (at diagnosis) and among those treated later

266

upon clinical deterioration. Currently, clinical trials are underway to study (hydroxy)chloroquine in

267

admitted COVID-19 patients (e.g., NCT04261517 and NCT04307693). As post-exposure prophylaxis,

268

hydroxychloroquine does not seem to be effective to prevent COVID-19,13 but results of further

269

studies are pending14. Given the current evidence, we would argue against the use (H)CQ outside the

270

setting of randomized clinical trials.
