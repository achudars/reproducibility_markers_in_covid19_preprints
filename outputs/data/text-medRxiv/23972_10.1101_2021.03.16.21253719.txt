Abstract
Background
Symptomatic testing programmes are crucial to the COVID-19 pandemic response. We sought
to examine United Kingdom (UK) testing rates amongst individuals with test-qualifying
symptoms, and factors associated with not testing.
Methods
We analysed a cohort of untested symptomatic app users (N=1,237), nested in the Zoe COVID
Symptom Study (Zoe, N= 4,394,948); and symptomatic survey respondents who wanted, but
did not have a test (N=1,956), drawn from the University of Maryland-Facebook Covid-19
Symptom Survey (UMD-Facebook, N=775,746).
Findings
The proportion tested among individuals with incident test-qualifying symptoms rose from ~20%
to ~75% from April to December 2020 in Zoe. Testing was lower with one vs more symptoms
(73.0% vs 85.0%), or short vs long symptom duration (72.6% vs 87.8%). 40.4% of survey
respondents did not identify all three test-qualifying symptoms. Symptom identification
decreased for every decade older (OR=0.908 [95% CI 0.883-0.933]). Amongst symptomatic
UMD-Facebook respondents who wanted but did not have a test, not knowing where to go was
the most cited factor (32.4%); this increased for each decade older (OR=1.207 [1.129-1.292])
and for every 4-years fewer in education (OR=0.685 [0.599-0.783]).
Interpretation
Despite current UK messaging on COVID-19 testing, there is a knowledge gap about when and
where to test, and this may be contributing to the ~25% testing gap. Risk factors, including older
age and less education, highlight potential opportunities to tailor public health messages.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
To assess current evidence on test uptake in symptomatic testing programmes, and the
reasons for not testing, we searched PubMed from database inception for research using the
keywords (COVID-19) AND (testing) AND ((access) OR (uptake)). We did not find any work
reporting on levels of test uptake amongst symptomatic individuals. We found three papers
investigating geographic barriers to testing. We found one US based survey reporting on
knowledge barriers to testing, and one UK based survey reporting on barriers in the period
March - August 2020. Neither of these studies were able to combine testing behaviour with
prospectively collected symptom reports from the users surveyed.

Added value of this study
Through prospective collection of symptom and test reports, we were able to estimate testing
uptake amongst individuals with test-qualifying symptoms in the UK. Our results indicate that
whilst testing has improved since the start of the pandemic, there remains a considerable
testing gap. Investigating this gap we find that individuals with just one test-qualifying symptom
or short symptom duration are less likely to get tested. We also find knowledge barriers to
testing: a substantial proportion of individuals do not know which symptoms qualify them for a
COVID-19 test, and do not know where to seek testing. We find a larger knowledge gap in
individuals with older age and fewer years of education.

Implications of all the available evidence
Despite the UK having a simple set of symptom-based testing criteria, with tests made freely
available through nationalised healthcare, a quarter of individuals with qualifying symptoms do
not get tested. Our findings suggest testing uptake may be limited by individuals not acting on
mild or transient symptoms, not recognising the testing criteria, and not knowing where to get
tested. Improved messaging may help address this testing gap, with opportunities to target
individuals of older age or fewer years of education. Messaging may prove even more valuable
in countries with more fragmented testing infrastructure or more nuanced testing criteria, where
knowledge barriers are likely to be greater.

Introduction
Testing is a crucial component of the COVID-19 public health response to guide mitigation and
triage illness, even as countries roll out vaccination campaigns. Whilst mass, population-based
testing has been trialled,1–3 the majority of programmes seek to test individuals experiencing a
certain set of symptoms. A successful program needs high testing uptake among those with
test-qualifying symptoms.4 Achieving high uptake requires both an informed and willing
population, and sufficient infrastructure to ensure test availability and accessibility.
In the United Kingdom (UK), the test-qualifying symptoms (fever, cough, or loss of smell)5 are
relatively straightforward, have been consistent since loss of smell was added to the criteria on
18 May 2020, and are buttressed by a free, high-capacity, national testing programme. This is in
contrast to other countries where criteria for testing have been more nuanced, varied over time
and between regions, and testing access remains suboptimal.6,7 Yet, despite the strengths of
the UK programme, we observed that 25% of symptom-tracking app participants do not report
testing despite experiencing test-qualifying symptoms. This and other evidence8,9 raised
questions regarding how the path from symptoms to testing could be improved to fully support
the pandemic response.
Prior research focuses on logistical barriers for not getting tested such as geographic,
socioeconomic and structural disparities in testing access,6,8,10 but there are other important
barriers, including the knowledge required to successfully navigate the journey from symptom
onset to test completion. Examining the reasons why people do not complete testing is hindered
by the difficulty in identifying individuals who should have, but did not, receive COVID-19 tests.
Towards this end, we leveraged longitudinal data from over 4 million Zoe COVID Symptom
Study (Zoe) participants,11 and over 700,000 surveys from the University of Maryland-Facebook
Covid-19 Symptom Survey (UMD-Facebook), to describe the temporal changes in COVID-19
testing among UK residents with test-qualifying symptoms. We followed-up with cross-sectional
surveys of the untested to identify knowledge barriers along the full journey to successful
testing.

Methods
This research combines syndromic surveillance data from the UK Zoe COVID Symptom Study
(Zoe)11 and the UK UMD-Facebook COVID-19 Symptom Survey (UMD-Facebook)12
Additionally, more detailed follow-up surveys of recently untested symptomatic participants were
analyzed. Survey details provided in Supplement S1-S3. Throughout we define test-qualifying
symptoms using the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) criteria: high temperature; new,
continuous cough; or loss or change to sense of smell or taste.5

Data sources
UK Zoe COVID Symptom Study (Zoe)
Longitudinal data were prospectively collected using the Zoe COVID Symptom Study app,
developed by Zoe Global with input from King's College London (UK), the Massachusetts
General Hospital (Boston, USA), and Lund and Uppsala Universities (Sweden). We used data
from app launch on 24 March 2020 through 1 January 2021 (N=4,394,948, n=245,505,763 userreports). App details are published elsewhere.11 Briefly, participants are asked enrollment
questions at baseline, and then daily whether they feel physically normal or if they are
experiencing symptoms. Participants are asked to record all COVID-19 test dates, types, and
outcomes. To support COVID-19 incidence estimation,13 from 28 April 2020 the UK Department
of Health and Social Care (DHSC) allocated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to
participants reporting any symptom after ≥1 “well” report in 9 days

.

UK Zoe Follow-up Survey
To better understand the reasons why individuals who experience test-qualifying symptoms do
not get tested, we deployed a cross-sectional SurveyMonkey web survey. We targeted
participants reporting ≥1 test-qualifying symptoms for the first time between 14 November and 8
December 2020, who did not have a COVID-19 swab test report -7 to +14 days from symptom
onset, including data entered up through 15 December 2020. Survey responses were linked to
Zoe accounts using a unique, anonymised, user identifier. There were four survey sections to
assess test-qualifying symptom recall and recognition, and test seeking and access. The survey
was refined based on analysis of N=194 pilot survey responses sent to N=1,000. On 18
December 2020, the final survey was delivered by email to eligible participants (N=4,936 less
N=706 without valid email address).
UK University of Maryland-Facebook COVID-19 Symptom Survey (UMD-Facebook)
This research is based on survey results from the University of Maryland (UMD).12 UMD, in
collaboration with Facebook, delivered web-based, cross-sectional surveys to users sampled
from the Facebook active user base. Survey sampling strategies were used to increase
representativeness of the source population (here, the UK population) by sampling from the UK
Facebook active user base and raking across census age, sex and geographic region to
develop survey weights.14 The study was drawn from N=775,746 responses within UK
geographic regions from 30 April 30 2020 (launch) through 21 February 2021. Primary analyses
use raw data, and sensitivity analysis applied survey weights.
UMD-Facebook Symptomatic Never Tested but Desired Testing Survey Subcohort
On December 21, 2020, additional survey questions were asked of the “never tested” UMDFacebook respondents regarding whether they had wanted to test in the prior two weeks, and
reasons for not getting a test when they wanted one. For the analysis of knowledge-based
factors contributing to not getting a test, cross-sectional surveys were limited to a subcohort of
those surveys completed from December 21, 2020 onwards (N=205,017, survey versions 7-9),

reporting test-qualifying symptoms in the past 24 hours (N=32,711, 16.0%), reported having
never been tested for coronavirus (N=12,821, 39.2%) and reported having wanted testing in the
prior 14 days (N=1,956, 15.3%). To describe the factors associated with knowledge barriers to
successful testing, we focused on the question “Do any of the following reasons describe why
you haven't been tested for coronavirus (COVID-19) in the last X days?”, where X is symptom
duration up to 14 days, and the response option “I don't know where to go”.

Data analysis
We calculated the proportions of outcomes among subgroups, considering several outcomes
and subgroup definitions. Logistic regression was used to estimate the covariate-outcome
association. Covariates considered varied for each analysis as not all variables available in
each data set: sex, age, symptom (see Supplementary Table 4), symptom number and duration,
symptom-to-survey time, self-reported years of education, index of multiple deprivation [IMD]15,
profession/work, self-reported or national rural-urban classification [RUC])16. For some
analyses, Zoe reports of either loss of taste/smell or altered taste/smell were combined.16 Zoe
and UMD-Facebook analyses were conducted using Python 3.8 and R 3.6.3, respectively.

Results
Quantifying the Testing Gap
The proportion of Zoe participants reporting COVID-19 testing has increased over time (Figure
1), from <20% (1 April 2020) to >70% (1 January 2021). In mid-September, national PCR
testing capacity was exceeded,17 coincident with a transient drop in reported tests. In late 2020,
despite adequate test capacity, >25% of test-qualifying app users did not report a test. The
UMD-Facebook survey time-series mirrors these trends (Supplementary Figure 5), albeit with a
lower absolute proportion, likely due, in part, to survey design differences (e.g. ever tests and
symptoms in prior 24 hours, vs tests -7 to +14 days from incident symptoms). The UMDFacebook testing gap is generally lower amongst respondents with a smartphone, and even
lower among symptom-tracking app participants (not necessarily Zoe).

Symptom Severity and Not Testing
To better understand the factors contributing to COVID-19 testing, Zoe participants with testqualifying symptoms during the study period, who did not report testing (N=20,425), were
studied further. During this period, the proportion not tested among those with test-qualifying
symptoms was higher for those with 1 vs ≥2 test-qualifying symptoms (27.0% vs 15.0%), and
for those with symptoms lasting ≤2 days vs >2 (27.4% vs 12.2%), (Table 1).

Similarly, the

proportion of ever-tested in UMD-Facebook was lowest among those with only one testqualifying symptom or short symptom duration (Supplementary Figure 5). A total of 1,254 users
(26.6%) responded to the follow-up survey. Zoe and follow-up survey participants during this
period were younger and more female than the general population, similar to the demographic
trends reported previously in Zoe13 and other digital health studies (Supplement S6).18,19

Journey to Successful COVID-19 Testing
In the Zoe follow-up survey, only 42.1% survey respondents recalled having experienced at
least one test-qualifying symptom in the past month (Table 2). Of those who recalled their
symptoms, 54.7% recognised that these symptoms qualified them for a COVID-19 test. Among
participants who recognized test-qualifying symptoms, they were likely to go on to attempt
(85.6%) and then successfully obtain a COVID-19 test (93.0%, or 18.4% of all survey
respondents).

Recall of Previously-Reported Test-Qualifying Symptoms
Among those who reported a single test-qualifying symptom (Table 3), recall of absent or
altered taste/smell (45.8%) and cough (40.8%), was higher than fever (25.5%), the last of which
, as queried in-app (“Do you have a fever or feel too hot?”) was an admixture of two symptoms
that may not be recalled equally well. Recall of having experienced test-qualifying symptoms
was associated with number of symptoms experienced (per test-qualifying symptom OR=1.302
[95% CI 1.220 - 1.391), symptom duration (per day OR=1.065 [95% CI 1.054 - 1.076]) and
recency (per symptom-to-survey days OR=0.995 [95% CI 0.991 - 1.000]). Number of symptoms
and symptom duration remained significantly associated with recall after adjusting for age, sex,
and recency of symptom onset (model results in Supplement S7).

Recognizing COVID-19 Test-Qualifying Symptoms
Just 54.7% of those who recalled experiencing test-qualifying symptoms indicated their
symptoms qualified them for a COVID-19 test. We queried the remaining respondents (N=809,
i.e. those who did not recall or who did not indicate the symptoms they recalled qualified them
for testing) which symptoms would qualify them for a test. These respondents were similarly
able to recognize fever (63.4%), cough (67.6%), and loss of smell (65.4%), and much less so for
altered smell (29.7%). Only 59.6% identified the triad of fever, cough, and loss of smell as
qualifying for a test, with lower recognition amongst the oldest age groups (Table 4). In
univariate analyses, each decade older reduced the odds of recognizing the triad (OR = 0.908
[95% CI 0.883 - 0.933]). This finding remained largely unchanged after adjustment for sex, IMD,
and rural-urban living. We found similar associations with the outcome of identifying each
individual symptoms (model results in Supplement S8). No associations were found for sex,
age, IMD and rural-/urban living.

Reasons for Not Testing Among Those Who Qualified For and Wanted a Test
In the follow-up survey, there were few respondents (N=17) who recognised their symptoms
qualified them for testing, and attempted, but did not succeed at testing (Table 2). We therefore
evaluated complementary data from a subcohort of UMD-Facebook respondents from 21
December 2020 to 21 February 2021, who endorsed test-qualifying symptoms, who had never
tested, and who indicated “yes” to the question question “Have you wanted to get tested for
coronavirus (COVID-19) at any time in the last 14 days?” (N=1,956, Table 5). Among those who
wanted testing, “I don’t know where to go” was the most frequently selected option (32.4%). The
other multi-choice reasons were: “I am unable to travel to a testing location” (29.1%), “I tried to
get a test but was not able to get one” (25.6%), “I am worried about bad things happening to me

or my family (including discrimination, government policies, and social stigma)” (18.4%), “I can't
afford the cost of the test” (17.9%), and “I don't have time to get tested”(13.3%). Given the
scope of this study, we have focused on the knowledge-based response, though we
acknowledge the logistical barriers are important.

Not Knowing Where to Test Among the Symptomatic Wanting Testing
We further investigated demographic factors associated with not knowing where to go to obtain
a test (Figure 2). Not knowing where to go to obtain a test (“yes” vs referent “no”) was
associated with older age (per decade OR=1.207 [1.129-1.292]) and less education (per 4years OR=0.685 [0.599-0.783]). Male sex (OR=1.334 [1.064-1.675]) and living outside a city
(OR=1.201 [0.926-1.562]) were not significant with Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis
testing (p-threshold 0.0125 = 0.05/4). Education was similarly protective for not knowing where
to test adjusting for age and sex, use of survey weights, or assuming missing responses were
“no” (models results in Supplementary S9).
Acknowledging our limited sample size, we conducted qualitative, hypothesis-generating
analyses of other demographic factors correlated with knowledge barriers (Supplementary S10).
While cities were not protective in the regression model, the proportion not knowing where to
test was slightly lower in London than elsewhere (Supplementary S11). Having a smartphone
and using a symptom-tracking app qualitatively had a bigger impact on the knowledge gap than
the relatively small urban-rural and regional differences. There were modest qualitative
differences in not knowing where to test by profession, with the highest proportions among
those in transportation, tourism and construction and the lowest in finance, public administration
and health.

Discussion
Persistent Testing Gap
Our analysis finds that in December 2020 approximately one quarter of symptomatic UK Zoe
participants who qualified for a COVID-19 test did not undergo testing. The proportion of evertested recently-symptomatic UK UMD-Facebook respondents echoes this trend. While we show
a substantial improvement from April, 2020, the persistent testing gap is problematic for
pandemic management in the UK and elsewhere. Non-pharmaceutical mitigation strategies are
likely to be required,20–22 despite effective vaccines, because of COVID-19 transmissibility and
the anticipated time to reach herd immunity, even with a one-dose immunization strategy.23 The
lower the proportion of identified infections, such as through insufficient testing of symptomatic
cases, the more likely transmission events will go unchecked.

Knowledge Barriers to Testing
With this testing gap in mind, we sought to characterize barriers to testing that might inform
improvements to the UK testing programme using data from two large, complementary
surveillance platforms. Through analysis of prospective self-reported testing outcomes, along
with follow-up and population-sampled surveys, we identified three key knowledge barriers

along the path to successful COVID-19 testing. Firstly, the association of less testing with brief
and/or single test-qualifying symptoms suggests an implied severity threshold for testing that is
inconsistent with guidance,5 and with the spectrum of infectious COVID-19.24 Individuals may
minimise their symptoms or possibly hold the misconceived notion that COVID-19 manifests in a
stereotypical manner.25 In a preprint DHSC report utilizing online surveys May 25 to August 5,
2020, those with test-qualifying symptoms did not request testing because symptoms were mild
(16.0%), improved (16.1%), or they did not think symptoms were due to COVID-19 (20%).8
Secondly, we show that four of ten did not recognize all three of the triad of UK test-qualifying-i.e. fever, cough and loss of smell. The DHSC report8 estimated 51.1% of all respondents failed
to recognize the triad. Despite increased media coverage and a second wave with mitigation
intensification,26 recognition of these test-qualifying symptoms in our survey around six months
later increased by ~10% and therefore remains alarmingly low.
Lastly, one third of those who wanted a COVID-19 test cited not knowing where to test as a
contributing factor to their not getting one. This was the most frequently cited reason among the
six options. Thus, despite the fact that survey respondents are possibly more aware of health
information, they acknowledge challenges to finding testing that are comparable to, if not
greater than, logistical barriers to testing (e.g. travel, time), even within the framework of the
more centralized UK testing programme.

Public Health Implications
Our findings have significant public health implications. The UK NHS testing programme offers
free COVID-19 tests to those with test-qualifying symptoms, with the list of qualifying symptoms
unchanged since loss/alteration to taste and smell were included on 18 May 2020,27 and tests
accessed through a central booking system.5 Risk mitigation and public health principles
generally would agree with these key features of the UK program i.e. the use of concise and
consistent guidance, and limiting logistical barriers to following guidance. In this sense, the UK
is a sort of case study of the “best case scenario”, and yet there is still a significant gap in
understanding. Not only are greater efforts needed to educate the UK public, it is likely that
comparable efforts to mind the knowledge gap will be needed in countries with regionally
varying testing criteria or methods of accessing testing.
Our work suggests there is a need for messaging improvements to the UK testing campaign. In
our study, among the untested who qualified for a test, older age was associated with not
knowing when and where to test. In the earlier DHSC report8, older age was generally protective
with respect to testing knowledge and behaviors, perhaps suggesting knowledge gains in the
young over the past six months. Fewer years of education was also associated with not knowing
where to test in our study. We found suggestive evidence that the knowledge gap may be more
pronounced among those who do not have smartphones. Older populations in pre-pandemic
studies have slower adoption of certain technologies, yet the abrupt social isolation resulting
from mitigation strategies may be leaving important segments of the population behind.28
Education attained and age are likely not the root cause. Rather they likely highlight pre-existing

health-information disparities that have been exacerbated by a year of unprecedented changes
in how individuals interface with each other and the world.
Our findings support the need for targeted messaging to certain at-risk demographic groups,
possibly in a non-digital format (e.g. radio, community signage). Our findings are particularly
timely in light of work showing that expansion of the symptoms that qualify for a test would help
detect more cases, assuming those who qualify do indeed successfully test.29,30 This theoretical
gain in case detection could be lost if the change in tack leaves vulnerable populations behind.
There is overlap between knowledge risk factors and COVID-19 risk, such as older age,31
though we did see a higher absolute rate of testing in the oldest age group. Overlap with
vaccine hesitancy risk factors may further amplify disparities in healthcare access, leaving some
groups both less tested and less protected.
Furthermore, messaging could also emphasise that even individuals with mild or transient
symptoms may have COVID-19 and should get tested. COVID-19 has a broad spectrum of
disease severity with a substantial number of cases being fully asymptomatic, and with
asymptomatic carriers still being able to transmit, albeit at reduced rates.24

Strengths and Limitations
The Zoe platform affords a unique opportunity to prospectively link testing behaviours with
incident symptoms in a large user base comprising ~6% of the UK population. The UMDFacebook platform, though smaller in size and slightly different in survey design, corroborates
temporal trends over in the broader population. To our knowledge, this has enabled the first
time-varying estimate of testing rates amongst individuals that qualify for COVID-19 tests over
the course of the pandemic. Both platforms could be leveraged to track the testing and
knowledge gaps, in real time, allowing the effectiveness of interventions, such as improved
messaging on when and where to test, to be assessed.
We acknowledge a number of limitations to this study. Digital surveys include selected
populations not necessarily representative of the wider population. Such platforms have welldocumented biases in demographic age, sex, and socioeconomic factors which we adjusted for
in our analyses.18,32 In addition, digital surveys may not be generalizable, as they may be
enriched for health-councious internet-connected participants, and thus underestimate
disparities in at-risk demographic groups. We show that symptom-tracking app participants and
those with smartphones have higher testing rates than all UMD-Facebook survey respondents.
Confounding and measurement bias in this observational study using self-reported covariates
and outcomes may also cause us to miss other important issues related to testing. We adjusted
for common confounders, and attempted to identify proxies for the knowledge gap rather than
attribute causality. There is no timely, efficient trial to conduct analyses of this scale. Self-report
could introduce non-differential and differential measurement error, including the possibility of
some events being omitted, or recorded inaccurately or inappropriately. Furthermore, the
financial implications of having to self-isolate disproportionately affect the poorest, and may
increase unwillingness to test33 and respondents may be wary of self-reporting socially

stigmatized reasons for not complying with guidance. Lastly, selection can theoretically induce
collider bias34 if the exposure and outcome are both causes of participation or subpopulation
selection.

Conclusion
Testing is a fundamental principle of population-wide transmission mitigation. While the UK now
has sufficient testing capacity, consistent guidelines, and free testing for those who qualify that
is coordinated centrally, still we see a 25% testing gap among those with test-qualifying
symptoms. We show this gap may be driven in part by a lack of understanding of mild COVID19, national testing criteria, and testing access, especially among the elderly and those who
have had fewer years of education. We propose altering the course of the UK testing
programme to address this knowledge barrier to COVID-19 testing. In addition, other countries
may benefit from improved understanding of modifiable barriers.

Figures
Figure 1 Proportion of participants reporting at least one test-qualifying symptom for the first
time that logged a COVID-19 swab test -7 to +14 days after the onset of the symptom. Dashed
vertical lines indicate the three-week study period (14 November 2020 to 8 December 2020)
that was used to define participants eligible for a follow-up survey, i.e. those that reported testqualifying symptoms for the first time but no swab test were invited to the Zoe Follow-Up
Survey. Blue line calculated using data logged by 28 January 2020, red line calculated using
data logged by 15 December 2020, which was the dataset used to identify target participants for
the survey. The difference shows that some participants recorded test data after selection into
the follow-up survey cohort. Grey bars indicate the UK PCR testing capacity, while green bars
indicate PCR tests performed.

Figure 2 Proportion (95% confidence interval) of respondents who indicated “yes” (per “yes”
plus “no”) for “I don’t know where to go” as a option to the question “Do any of the following
reasons describe why you haven't been tested for coronavirus (COVID-19) in the last X days?”,
where X is the self-reported duration of symptom capped at 14 days. This was restricted to
untested respondents with test-qualifying symptoms. Proportions stratified by age (top) and
education (bottom).

S5 Supplementary Figure: Testing trends
UMD Facebook UK COVID-19 Symptom Survey temporal trends in the proportion of
symptomatic survey respondents ever tested from survey start (April 30, 2020). Additional
questions for the never tested respondents were added in survey wave 7 and beyond
(December 21, 2020, vertical grey line). Surveys with non-missing geographic region in the UK,
self-reporting at least one of fever, cough or loss of smell/taste in the prior 24 hours
(N=107,021, solid purple), plotting proportion (Wilson method for binomial 95% confidence
re
intervals) who indicate ever testing for COVID-19. (a) Starting June 27, 2020, respondents were
queried about technology use. There were N=67508 (63.1%, dashed green) who reported using
g
a smartphone device, while N=16,488 (15.4%, dashed yellow) reported using any symptom
tracking app. Survey-weighted mean (+/- 2 standard deviation) for all surveys with testqualifying symptoms included for comparison. This was generally lower than the raw proportion
ever tested. Testing proportion among cross-sectional surveys varied by (b) number of testqualifying symptoms and (c) duration of symptoms (for those who reported symptom duration),
similar to the prospective, longitudinal Zoe app findings.

S9 Supplementary Table: Knowing where to test
Logistic regression models for the association of not knowing where to test, including
covariates of age, sex, education and where living, comparing those who answered “yes” and
“no”. Further sensitivity analyses assuming missing responses to be “no” lowers the proportion
of answered “yes” and attenuates p-values, while effect estimates are directionally consistent
and statistically significant (e.g. education multivariate model per 4 years of education,
OR=0.711 (0.619-0.813), p=8.84e-07). Modeling age as young (referent 18-54 years) vs old
(55+), produced a similar estimate of the association of age (OR=2.1 (1.65, 2.69), p=2.12e-09)
with not knowing where to test. Modeling education in 8-year categories starting prior to
completion of secondary school (0-8, 9-16, and 17-24) was also similar OR=0.662, 0.528-0.830,
p=3.65e-4). See Supplementary Figure 7 and 9 for additional sensitivity analyses and qualitative
investigations.

S10 Supplementary Figure: Qualitative demographic-knowledge relationships.
Shown are the proportion (Wilson 95% confidence interval for binomial) reporting they did not
know where to test (“yes” vs “yes” and “no”) across various demographic factors including: a)
self-identified work type, b) where living (city,town, village/rural) vs technology used (none,
smart phone, symptom tracking app). Missing responses are excluded in the primary analyses.
c) Sensitivity analysis assuming missing responses are “no”, and are generally lower but with
the same demographic patterns.

(a) Self-Identified Work Type: While confidence bounds are overlapping, work/profession of
financial/insurance/real estate services, public administration, health,
professional/scientific/technical activities were the lowest while transportation, tourism and
construction were the highest.

(b) Where living (city, town, village/rural) vs technology (none, smart phone, smart phone with
tracking app). The proportion was lower among those using smart phone or symptom tracking
app technology, regardless of whether living in a city, town or village/rural area.

(f) Sensitivity analyses assuming missing responses are “no”, for where living (city, town,
village/rural) vs technology (none, smart phone, smart phone with symptom tracking app). The
absolute proportion not knowing where to go is lower when missing are assumed to be “no”, but

S11 Supplementary Figure: Participant locations for UMD-Facebook Survey
Map of proportion of symptomatic, untested survey respondents who wanted to test but did not
know where to test (a) proportion, (b) sensitivity analysis assuming missing responses were
“no”, and (c) number of surveys with yes or no responses to the reason “I don't know where to
go” when asked “Do any of the following reasons describe why you haven't been tested for
coronavirus (COVID-19) in the last X days? [y/n]”. X is the self-reported duration of symptoms
(up to 14 days) and (d). (d) Geographic distribution of proportion of symptomatic ever tested
during the study period and (e) early in the pandemic (Apr-Aug 2020). Not the orange (d) and
yellow (e) color scales span the same percentage but have different minimum values. Early in
the pandemic the testing gap was very similar across geographic areas. During the study
period, the testing gap is closing in all geographic areas, with qualitatively better testing gains in
the testing rates in some areas.
(a) Proportion “yes” vs “yes” plus “no”

(c) Non-missing response count (yes plus no)
