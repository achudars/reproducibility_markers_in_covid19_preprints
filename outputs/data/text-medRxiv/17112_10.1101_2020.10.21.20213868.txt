Abstract: In Europe the Corona Virus spread had started to retard months ago, but after some
time it has started to accelerate again. In this article, we are going to analyze the current COVID19 spread patterns in Italy, the UK, Germany, Russia, Spain and France. We have found that the
current spread has perhaps been underestimated as just the second wave. As per our analysis, as
on 7 October the resurgence is much more vigorous than the first wave of spread of the disease.
It is going to be most serious in Russia, followed by Italy, Germany and the UK, while in Spain
and France the patterns are yet to take inferable shapes.
Key Words: Pandemic, infectious disease, epidemiological modeling.
Introduction
In the European countries the second wave of COVID-19 has been observed to be much more
serious than the first one. The data clearly reflect resurgence of the disease, but how serious the
matter is can be judged only after a proper data analysis. In this article, we are going to show
how to infer empirically the severity of the spread. We shall show that the COVID-19 situation
in Europe is indeed very serious.
A look at the daily increase in the cumulative totals of the COVID-19 cases in the European
countries mentioned above and the World gives us an apparently clear picture how much Europe
is contributing to the daily increase in the total number of cases in the World. For example, on
October 7 the increase in the World total were 348967 out of which the UK contributed 14162
(4.06%) cases, Italy contributed 3678 (1.11%) cases, Germany contributed 3994 (1.14%) cases,
France contributed 18746 (5.37%) cases, Russia contributed 11115 (3.18%) cases and Spain
contributed 10574 (3.03%) cases. The total increase on that day in these six European countries
were 62269 (17.84%) to the total increase in the World. On that same day, India which is
currently contributing the maximum to the daily increase in the World contributed 78809
(22.58%) cases while the USA on that day contributed 49398 (14.15%) cases. Therefore it can be
seen that on October 7, these six European countries together had contributed more to the World
total than the USA although the contribution was less than that from India. However, we have to
note that in India and the USA, the spread is retarding while in these six European countries that
kind of retardations took place months ago, and thereafter it has started to move towards
resurgence â€“ the so called second wave. Indeed the figures for one single day may actually be

misleading. We shall put forward a numerical analysis of the spread data for a period of 15 days
from 23 September to 7 October.
We would like to mention at this point that the current growth curves of the disease in these six
European countries are obviously not like the curve assumed in the compartmental
epidemiological models [1, 2. 3]. At the start of an epidemic, the classical compartmental models
do not presume a change from a retarding state to an accelerating state.
Methodology
It is apparent from the graphs published by Worldometers.info [4] that the spread patterns are of
the exponential type in the six European countries mentioned above. We shall consider the total
number of cases in these six countries from 22 September to 7 October. From that we shall form
a time series from 23 September to 7 October, of the values of âˆ† for   1, 2, â€¦ , 15, where
âˆ† are the first order differences of

  à¯˜



where  is the cumulative total number of cases at time . We shall first see whether the
spread is approximately following the function

  exp     , ,   0,   0,
by the observations. We shall thereafter demonstrate diagrammatically that the time series of
âˆ† would explain what exactly the picture is as far as resurgence of the disease is concerned.
Indeed for  strictly exponential following the pattern shown above âˆ† would be constant.
But in the case of an epidemic, the function  cannot be strictly exponential. It can be only
approximately exponential. It was earlier observed that for âˆ†  1, âˆ† follows the following
rules. Once the cumulative total number of cases of the epidemic had entered into the nearly
exponential phase, âˆ† starts to follow a reducing trend. It was earlier observed that a change
from a nearly exponential pattern to a nearly logarithmic pattern took place in Italy [5] months
ago. In the other five European countries too such retardation must have followed the nearly
logarithmic pattern. It was observed [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] that when the pandemic continues to grow
nearly exponentially, âˆ† would continue to decrease linearly in time. If it continues to be very
nearly constant for a sufficiently long duration after continuing to decrease linearly earlier, that
should be taken as a signal that the pattern might start to change to a nearly logarithmic one soon
after. It was shown in [11] how âˆ† can lead to conclude about the current situations in India,
in the USA and in the World. Data from 17 September to 1 October were used. It was observed
that the values of âˆ† were decreasing steadily in India, and were very nearly constants in the
USA and the World. Based on the current procedure using data from 17 September to 1 October,
forecasts regarding the cumulative total number of cases from 2 October to 16 October were
made for India, the USA and the World.

It can be seen how close the forecasts [11] and the observed values are for the USA and the
World. For India, it was mentioned that as in the forecasts the average of âˆ† was used, the
forecasts would be overestimations. In effect, it was demonstrated that the method of inferring
from the values of âˆ† is really useful. We now proceed to analyze the recent data on the
cumulative total number of COVID-19 cases in the six European countries mentioned above.
Analysis
We shall now put forward our empirical analysis of the COVI-19 spread patterns in the six
European countries concerned. In Table-1 we have shown the values of âˆ† from 7 October
downwards to 23 September for Italy. The values of âˆ† from 23 September to 7 October have
been shown diagrammatically in Fig. 1.

From the diagrammatic representation, it is clear that what has been happening in Italy is
unusual. The values of âˆ† are following an increasing trend around the average 0.006946.
Indeed this should not have been the case. As we have mentioned earlier, in the nearly
exponential phase, the values of âˆ† decreases linearly, and by the time the retardation starts
the values of âˆ† start to become nearly constant. But currently in Italy the values of âˆ†
have been found to be increasing. This gives us a picture that the COVID-19 situation in Italy is
showing an unusual increasing trend, and such a thing is not assumed in any classical
epidemiological mathematical model.

Fig. 6: Values of âˆ†, France, 23 September to 7 October
It may be mentioned at this point that the troughs in the daily new cases [4] were seen to be
minimum in Italy around June 27 to July 16, in Spain around May 20 to June 27, in France
around June 8 to June 27, in the UK around 10 July, in Russia around August 23 and in Germany
around June 8, and thereafter currently in October the disease has been spreading again, this time
following very unusual patterns.
We shall now put forward a mathematical explanation of the unusual pattern that âˆ† has been
following in Europe. When the epidemic had appeared, the cumulative total number  of
cases was following a nonlinear pattern. Soon the pattern became nearly exponential. In this
nearly exponential phase  was expressible approximately as

  exp     , ,   0,   0.
Defining

  à¯˜



it was found in earlier studies [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] that the values of

âˆ†      1
show a linearly reducing trend with respect to time until a retarding phase starts and in that phase
the spread pattern becomes nearly logarithmic. In the standard epidemiological models also this
kind of a growth pattern is assumed. However, the pattern in the second wave of the epidemic is
different in the sense that âˆ† in these six European countries has been showing an increasing
trend instead of a decreasing trend as was observed in earlier studies. There can be only one
explanation of this phenomenon. In the first wave, z was of first degree but in the second

wave, whatever might be the reasons,  is not of first degree. What we mean is that in this
second wave the natural logarithm of  is not a first degree polynomial in , and that is why
our calculated values of âˆ† are showing an increasing trend instead of a decreasing trend in
Italy, Germany, Russia and the UK. In Spain and France, an increasing trend in the values of
âˆ† is not clear yet, but the values are not showing near constancy also. Therefore it is obvious
that in these two countries also  is not of first degree in . If in the second wave of the
epidemic

  exp       à¬¶ , , ,   0,   0,
then it is obvious that âˆ† would show an increasing trend because   0, but this kind of an
exponential growth was not seen in the first wave which is why it was observed that the values of
âˆ† were showing a linearly decreasing trend earlier.
Therefore we can empirically infer that as long as âˆ† was an estimate of the coefficient  for
some  in   exp     , ,   0,   0, it was showing a decreasing trend in the
nearly exponential phase of growth of the epidemic when the virus first appeared. Currently in
the resurgence,  is the exponent of a nonlinear function of time and therefore we have found
the behavior of âˆ† unusual. In effect, the resurgence is following a much faster growth pattern
different from what was seen to be followed when COVID-19 had appeared.
Conclusions
The COVID-19 situation in Europe is showing an unusual trend. How long would the situation
remain in this way cannot be said now. But one thing can be said with certainty that the situation
has become explosive. In Russia in particular, the growth is not following the standard
epidemiological growth pattern. In Italy, Germany and the UK too, the growth is very unusual.
In Spain and France, the situation is uncertain as yet. We conclude that the growth pattern of the
epidemic in the current resurgence in the six European countries concerned is of a type very
different from the nearly exponential type followed in the accelerating phase in the first wave.
