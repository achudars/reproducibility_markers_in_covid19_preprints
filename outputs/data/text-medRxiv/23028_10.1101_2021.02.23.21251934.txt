Abstract

19

There is an urgent need for inexpensive, rapid and specific antigen-based assays to test for infection

20

with SARS-CoV-2 and distinguish variants arising as the COVID-19 pandemic spreads. We have

21

identified a small, synthetic protein (JS7), representing a region of maximum variability within the

22

receptor binding domain (RBD), which binds antibodies in sera from nine patients with PCR-verified

23

COVID-19 of varying severity. Antibodies binding to either JS7 or the SARS-CoV-2 recombinant RBD,

24

as well as those that disrupt binding between a fragment of the ACE2 receptor and the RBD, are

25

proportional to disease severity and clinical outcome. Binding to JS7 was inhibited by linear peptides

Introduction

38

COVID-19, caused by a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) 5, 6 is closely related, in its sequence, structure

39

40

from survivors 1, 11 of the SARS-CoV-1 (SARS) 2002-2003 outbreak 12, 13 and COVID-19 14. In addition,

41

the previously identified SARS-specific human antibody, CR3022, binds the receptor binding domain

42

(RBD) of SARS-Cov-2 with nanomolar affinity

43

especially the recently identified variants of SARS-CoV-2

44

diverge from each other in that the case fatality rate of the newer virus appears lower. SARS-CoV-2 is

45

much more communicable via inhaled aerosols

46

around position 70119. SARS-CoV-2 has continued to mutate during its path through humanity,

47

accumulating changes in this furin site and the RBD that may eventually affect its phenotype, immune

48

sensitivity and resistance to therapies

49

from the even deadlier β-CoV that causes MERS

50

result in a virus that combines the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 with the high mortality of

51

SARS-CoV-1 or MERS. In addition, while the origins of both SARS viruses are unclear, there is a high

52

probability that similar viruses are circulating, re-combining and mutating in some animal reservoir.

53

Cross-over of the human virus into other species could also lead to changes in its infectivity severity,

54

and resistance to therapies 25, 26. It is thus essential to have sensitive and specific diagnostic tools for the

55

public health community to detect currently circulating variants. Outbreaks with mutated forms of

56

SARS-CoV-2 are continuing to emerge 15, 22, 27 . Many assays for determining prior COVID-19 infection

57

are based on detecting antibodies in sera to recombinant versions of the surface (S) protein, which was

58

previously identified as the binding site for neutralizing antibodies produced in response to SARS-CoV-

methods developed for expressing the SARS S protein could be adapted to express also that of SARS-

62

Cov-2, and the RBD, despite the sequence and length (1255/1277 aa for SARS/SARS-CoV2) diversity 7,

63

13

64

, which varies by about 20% throughout its length (Fig. S1). Fortunately,

. However, the S proteins of future variants may not be as amenable to recombinant synthesis.
Recent advances allow chemical synthesis of small proteins in large amounts, supplying pure protein

65

variants rapidly . We have thus concentrated on reducing the size of the protein needed to distinguish

66

COVID-19 infections to the area of maximum sequence variation between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-

67

CoV-2 9, 31-33. This area also coincides with a region where the epitopes of many COVID-19 neutralizing

68

monoclonal antibodies cluster.34 As we show here, synthetic proteins representing this region bind

69

antibodies from sera of patients with COVID-19

70

infections of varying severity. Modifications of this

71

protein can be the basis for detecting variants that

72

may affect treatment protocols.

73

Results and Discussion

74

We synthesized two proteins, of about 10 kD

75

and 7 KD (JS10 and JS7, Fig. 1, see Supplementary

76

Material for production and characterization of the

77

latter). This area of the RBD structure, in complex

78

with the ACE2 in a cryo-EM structure35, contains a

79

region of antiparallel β-sheet (Fig. 1), but is

80

otherwise flexibly structured with 4 tyrosines

81

(Y453, Y489, Y449, Y505) mediating many

82

contacts across the interface. The recent UK mutations, N501Y, could enhance this binding. The CD

Convalescent sera from 9 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 disease of varying severity, from

99

“mild” to critical, were used for dotspots, ELISAs and an assay for inhibition of association of the RBD

100

with its cellular receptor, ACE2. As shown in Table 1S, these patients had co-morbidities that have

101

been found, in other studies, to be associated with hospitalization due to COVID-19. Of the 9, 5 were

102

known to be diabetic, and 6 had elevated glucose levels at time of diagnosis. Four of the 6 patients who

103

had severe or critical disease were obese (BMI>30). Notably, the one patient who succumbed did not

104

have these risk factors except for age >70. As Fig. 3 shows, sera from patients with severe or critical

105

disease had antibodies that interfered with the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (protein 4) to an ACE2

patients with mild or moderate

disease did not inhibit in this assay.

109

However, both patients had

110

antibodies that recognized the RBD

111

and/or the JS7 in dotspots or

112

ELISA; this recognition was

113

inhibited by peptides from the

114

RBD/ACE2 interface (Fig. 4,5; see

sequences).

increasing inhibition of the interaction).

from sera of 3 COVID 19 patients and a control serum. Methods
and data for all 9 patients and controls are described in
Supplementary material. Recombinant proteins (1-4) or synthetic
proteins (5,6) (see Fig. 2) were bound to nitrocellulose for
dotspots9 and reacted with sera diluted 1:100. ELISA, for binding
to recombinant SAR-CoV-2 RBD (Protein 4) or JS7 (6) is the
highest dilution factor of serum where significant OD450 is
measured; maximum dilution in the assay was 3.3 x 10 5. ACE2
inhibition is the degree to which each serum inhibited the binding
of an ACE2 fragment to SARS-CoV-2 RBD (protein 4). A
negative number indicates inhibition, where protein 4 inhibition
(of binding to itself) = -0.82. (average of triplicates is shown).

117

A dotspot assay showed that all 9

118

patient sera contained antibodies that

119

recognized JS7 (spot #6), while

120

recognition of the SARS-CoV-2

121

recombinant RBD (Spots 1 and 4)

122

varied (Table 1, Table S1). Binding

123

to JS7 was similar, in ELISA assays, to that of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Fig. 4). While all patients had

124

antibodies that recognized both SARS-CoV-2 RBD proteins, one patient (16) with mild disease did not

125

recognize the full-length S protein of SARS-CoV-1 (spot 2), in two separate blood draws 5 weeks apart

126

(Table 1).

127

Antibody binding, as measured by ELISA of either protein was approximately proportional to the

128

severity of the infection (Fig. 4, 5). Antibody binding could be reduced, for some sera to the level of

controls, by adding peptides from the RBD/ACE2

130

interface (Figure 4, 5 and Supplementary material),

131

further emphasizing the importance of this region for

132

binding to the cell receptor. In the case of JS7, most

133

of the binding could be abolished by adding only one

134

of the peptides, from the central portion of the

135

interface with ACE2. Thus detecting evidence of

136

prior or ongoing COVID-19 infection with the

137

smaller synthetic protein was as sensitive as with the

138

larger RBD, and was specific for antibodies recognizing

139

an area essential for interacting with the ACE2. This

140

suggests it to be an excellent candidate for point of care

141

diagnostics that could be used, in addition to PCR, to

142

determine immune system involvement.

Assays with sera from normal volunteers who

144

participated in a study of chronic urticaria, collected in

145

Denver, CO USA in spring, 2019 before widespread introductions of SARS-Cov-2 into the US (Table

146

S2), illustrates one of the great advantages to using the small synthetic proteins for diagnostics. Larger

147

recombinant proteins may need to be expressed with protein tags, for solubility and/or ease in

148

purification. As the strong binding of both control and patient sera to protein 1, which still contains such

149

tags, shows these can cause assay artifacts if left intact (Tables 1, S1, S2). Antibodies in all the control

150

sera showed somewhat less recognition of the RBD fragment of both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2

151

produced in yeast (proteins 3,4; the sequences of all 3 forms of the RBD are compared in Supplementary

152

Material). Two of the control sera bound three of the four recombinant proteins to the same extent as

153

patients with only mild COVID-19 disease; this was confirmed by ELISA (Figs. 4,5). This binding

154

could be due to previous infections with other coronaviruses37, or simply reflect germline antibody

155

recognition. In support of the latter, others have found that neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against

156

the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, isolated from many different donors, were from public clonotypes, bound

157

autoantigens and contained relatively few somatic mutations from germline38.

158

The greatest advantage of using JS7 for diagnostic purposes is that its sequence can be rapidly

159

modified to reflect variants now emerging in patients throughout the world. Although the N501Y mutant

160

did not alter neutralization by polyclonal antibodies in some test sera 39, other changes in this area at the

161

interface of the RBD and its ACE2 receptor (Fig. 1B) may alter the usefulness of treatments, such as

162

convalescent plasma4, monoclonal antibodies and small molecules designed to disrupt this interaction.

163

Several lines of evidence indicate that neutralization by serum antibodies and especially monoclonal

164

antibodies is limited by variation in the JS7 area of the SARS viruses. The affinity of the cross reactive

165

SARS-CoV-1 antibody, CR3022, whose epitope is located in the conserved area just upstream of the

166

JS7 site,28 was greatly reduced by the single amino acid change, P to A found in the SARS-CoV-2

167

protein.29 Further, while all 9 COVID-19 patients in this study had antibodies that recognize the RBD of

168

SARS-CoV-2, one patient with mild illness did not recognize the whole S protein of SARS-CoV-1

169

(protein 2), despite the 80% overall sequence identity (Table 1, S1). Further, some variants in this area,

170

which also arose as escape mutants of monoclonal antibodies40, can render the virus insensitive to

171

neutralization by convalescent sera41. The rise of these variants in several different areas of the world

172

suggests they do not prevent virus replication and may be selected for under immune pressure.

173

In this day of very specific treatments, assays which discriminate among variants of SARS related

174

viruses and other coronaviruses are essential. It is thus important to have a panel of antigens

175

representing areas of maximum variation in the RBD that can be used to rapidly determine specific

176

variants and support planning clinical treatments. Reagents and linkers needed for assays can be

177

integrated into variants of JS7 during synthesis, while controlling its sequence, stereochemistry and

178

disulfide patterns. The JS7 protein, further modified to display variants and to be serum stable, may also

179

have a future as a vaccine additive or booster. For example, recent methods have been developed to

180

generate one component-synthetic proteins with incorporated adjuvant42.

181

In conclusion, we show here that short synthetic proteins, which can be produced quickly in large

182

quantities, can be the basis of specific assays to detect antibodies in sera that that are produced in

183

response to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Antibodies in sera of 9 patients who had PCR confirmed,

184

COVID-19 of differing severity recognized the JS7 protein. The sera from 8 of these patients was taken

185

up to 2 months after diagnosis, while the 9th patient died during hospitalization. JS7 and future variants

186

should prove to be another tool for eventually defeating the current outbreak.
