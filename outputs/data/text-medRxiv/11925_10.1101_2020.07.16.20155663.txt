Abstract
Introduction: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) specific antibodies have
been shown to neutralize the virus in-vitro. Understanding antibody dynamics following SARS-CoV-2 infection
is therefore crucial. Sensitive measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is also vital for large seroprevalence
surveys which inform government policies and public health interventions. However, rapidly waning antibodies
following SARS-CoV-2 infection could jeopardize the sensitivity of serological testing on which these surveys
depend.
Methods: This prospective cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 humoral dynamics in a central London hospital
analyzed 137 serial samples collected from 67 participants seropositive to SARS-CoV-2 by the Meso-Scale
Discovery assay. Antibody titers were quantified to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (N), spike (S-)protein and
the receptor-binding-domain (RBD) of the S-protein. Titers were log-transformed and a multivariate log-linear
model with time-since-infection and clinical variables was fitted by Bayesian methods.
Results: The mean estimated half-life of the N-antibody was 52 days (95% CI 42-65). The S- and RBDantibody had significantly longer mean half-lives of 81 days (95% CI 61-111) and 83 days (95% CI 55-137)
respectively. An ACE-2-receptor competition assay demonstrated significant correlation between the S and
RBD-antibody titers and ACE2-receptor blocking in-vitro. The time-to-a-negative N-antibody test for 50% of
the seropositive population was predicted to be 195 days (95% CI 163-236).
Discussion: After SARS-CoV-2 infection, the predicted half-life of N-antibody was 52 days with 50% of
seropositive participants becoming seronegative to this antibody at 195 days. Widely used serological tests
that depend on the N-antibody will therefore significantly underestimate the prevalence of infection following
the majority of infections.
Significance statement
We believe that our study has significant and urgent public health and translational impact. Firstly, our findings
demonstrate that the half-life of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein antibody is only 52 days. This has immediate
and important implications for large-scale seroprevalence surveys, government policy and mathematical
modelling predictions which rely on serological tests that target this antibody. Secondly, the slower decay of
the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody identified in this study makes assays to the spike protein a more
reliable target for serological assays in the longer term. We demonstrate a strong positive linear correlation
between spike/RBD antibody and ACE-2 receptor binding in vitro. Our findings are therefore likely to reflect
the time to loss of a functional antibody response in SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
Since appearing as a cluster of pneumonia cases in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, Coronavirus disease
th
(COVID-19) has rapidly spread worldwide.(1) As of July 7 , there have been 11,863,477 cases, resulting in
544,949 deaths and a global health crisis, with significant social, economic and public health implications.(2)
COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), an enveloped RNA
β-coronavirus.(3) Specific immunoglobulin (IgG) antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike (S)
protein, nucleoprotein (N) protein and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) develop between 6-15 days
following disease-onset.(4) The S-protein, which contains the RBD, binds to host cells via the angiotensinconverting-enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor, and membrane fusion occurs before viral entry.(5, 6) The Nprotein plays an important role in transcription enhancement and viral assembly.(7)
The dynamics and duration of the antibody response to S-protein, N-protein and the RBD following infection
or exposure with SARS-CoV-2 remain poorly understood.(8–10) Quantifying the humoral response shortly
after infection limits the inferences that can be made about longer term dynamics. SARS-CoV-2-specific
antibodies (particularly to the S-protein) detected in convalescent individuals have been shown to strongly
correlate with virus-specific T-cell responses and viral neutralisation in vitro, as well as protection against
disease in animal models, following passive transfer of selected monoclonal antibodies.(8, 11–15) It is
unknown whether re-infection in humans occurs following primary infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, reinfection did not occur in rhesus macaques that were re-challenged in the presence of detectable endogenous
antibodies.(16, 17) Taken together, these findings highlight the importance of characterising humoral
dynamics following SARS-CoV-2 infection.
A large seroprevalence survey undertaken in Spain, recently reported a SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of
5.0%(18). This study used a chemiluminescent assay to detect nucleoprotein antibody together with a point of
care lateral flow device. In contrast, Public Health England undertook a SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody
seroprevalence survey of 1000 samples from blood donors in London estimating a seroprevalence of 17.5%
in the first week of April(19). Whilst many socio-demographic factors could account for the different estimates
of seroprevalence between these studies, one explanation may be the relative decay of the spike and the
nucleoprotein antibodies.
Longitudinal serological data from Taiwan's national SARS database estimated the half-life of SARS-CoV-1
neutralizing antibody to be 45 days,(20) whilst 74% of hospitalized patients in China had detectable SARSCoV-1 IgG at 36 months post-infection.(21) After pauci-symptomatic MERS infection, antibodies rapidly
decayed and were undetectable within one year.(22) However, following severe disease, antibodies have
been detected up to 34 months post-infection.23
In order to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 antibody kinetics and longevity, we launched the Covid-19 Staff Testing of
Antibody Responses Study (Co-STARS), a longitudinal prospective cohort study of healthcare workers
designed to measure serial quantitative antibody levels over 1-year. In parallel with serological data, detailed
demographic, clinical and socioeconomic data was also collected across different hospital departments, to
provide a comprehensive insight into factors that may influence antibody dynamics.

Results
Socio-Demographic and Clinical Details: A total of 137 longitudinal samples that were in pairs or triplicate from
67 of the first participants in the Co-Stars study were available for analysis. Fifty-three participants (79%) of
the cohort were women and 25% were from Black, Asian, Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds (17/67).
Importantly, none of the participants had been admitted to hospital and only 5% had underlying comorbidities.
Age, clinical, and demographic variables for the cohort are reported in Supplementary Table 1.
Model Fit: The combination of co-variates that provided the best model fit was determined by optimizing the
Deviance Information Criterion (Supplementary Table 2). Log-linear models were fitted to the decay of each
SARS-CoV-2 antibody with confidence limits on the slope included with and without individual random effects
(Figure 1). Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) plots converged appropriately for the 3 antibodies and
estimated parameters (Supplementary Figure 3).
Half-life Estimations: The mean posterior probability of the slope of the N-antibody was twice the magnitude of
the mean slopes of the S and RBD antibodies (Supplementary Figure 4). This translated to a half-life of 52
days (95% CI 42-65) for the nucleoprotein antibody and a half-life of 81 (95% CI 61-111) and 83 days (95% CI
55-137) for the S- and RBD-antibody, respectively (Figure 2).
Time-to-Negativity: When these estimated rates were extrapolated to time-to-negativity (Figure 3) and timeto-undetectable curves (Supplementary Figure 5), 50% of the seropositive population by the MSD assay
were estimated to be negative to the N-antibody at 195 days (95% CI 163-236); by comparison, 100% of
subjects were estimated to remain positive to the trimeric S-antibody at the same time point.
The time-to-negativity for 50% of the seropositive population for the RBD antibody was predicted to be 260
days (95% CI 180-418) and for the trimeric S antibody was 532 days (95% CI 418-667). However, the time-tonegativity was reduced to 67 days in the EDI assay (95% CI 47-91) days. (Figure 3).
Association of Demographic Variables with Antibody Titers: Both BAME participants and those >50 years
were significantly associated with increased initial antibody titers. Neither co-morbidities, sex nor BMI were
significantly associated with increased antibody titers. Interactions between age and time, sex and time and
ethnicity and time were also examined and none were significant (Supplementary Table 3 and
Supplementary Figure 7).
Competitive Binding Assay: There was a strong positive linear correlation between ACE-2 receptor blocking
and both S-protein (R2=0.72, p<0.001) and RBD antibody titers (R2=0.77, p<0.001) (Figure 4).

Discussion
This prospective study of antibody responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection has estimated the mean halflife of the nucleoprotein (N) antibody to be only 52 days. Consequently, 50% of seropositive individuals will
have a negative N-antibody test at 195 days after the start of antibody decay; by contrast 100% are predicted
to have a positive test to the trimeric S-antibody at the same time point.
The half-life of the N-antibody was significantly shorter than that of the trimeric S- and RBD-antibodies with a
mean of 81 and 84 days, respectively. These findings have immediate implications for SARS-CoV-2
diagnostic testing particularly widely used serological tests that target N-antibodies. Our findings are
consistent with published estimates of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV humoral dynamics following mild-tomoderate infection.(9, 20, 22, 26–28)
To date, no studies have comprehensively characterized the nature and duration of antibody responses to
different SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, stratified by demographic factors and comorbidities. Long et al recently
reported waning of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies within 2-3 months following
infection, decreasing by up to 76% and 81%, respectively. This was more pronounced following clinical
disease, although 40% of asymptomatic patients (compared to 13% symptomatic) became seronegative in
this early convalescent period.(10) Detailed antibody kinetics, however, were not reported. Asymptomatic or
mildly symptomatic cohorts have also been largely overlooked, with most studies conducted on hospitalized
patients. Our study addresses these gaps, facilitated by the MSD assay which enabled evaluation of absolute
antibody titers to three major SARS-CoV-2 epitopes in parallel. Those participants over 50 years of age and
BAME participants had higher initial antibody titers to N, S and RBD antigens. Although elderly patients are
known to produce lower antibody responses to infection and vaccination,(29, 30) increased disease severity in
this group may have influenced antibody response. The association between ethnicity and antibody titres
needs to be further explored.
None of the seropositive healthcare workers identified in this study required hospitalization. This is important,
given that only 1% of 20-30 year olds and 18% of >80 year olds diagnosed COVID-19 cases are hospitalized,
making our study population representative of the majority of community SARS-CoV-2 infections.(31) Severe
disease has been associated with higher antibody titers and a longer duration of antibody response following
both SARS and MERS.(9, 20, 21, 32) When long-term follow-up studies of hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients
are published, we therefore expect the half-life estimates to increase due to the increased severity of initial
disease.
Viral neutralization assays remain the gold-standard in vitro correlate of protection and the lack of formal
neutralization tests is a limitation of the study. ACE-2 receptor competition assays such as the MSD
competitive binding assay have been shown to correlate well with formal viral neutralization assays(33). The
ACE-2 competition assay used in this study had a strong positive linear correlation with both S-antibody titers
2
2
(R =0.72) and RBD-antibody titres (R =0.77). Therefore, our observed decline in S-antibody titers is likely to
be proportional to declines in functional receptor blocking activity.
Our negative exponential model of antibody decay assumed a constant rate of decay over time. Negative
exponential models of antibody decay are frequently used to model antibody decay,(34, 35) and this
assumption was supported by plotting the rate of decay over time (Supplementary Materials Fig.2).
Nevertheless, increased serial antibody measurements will enable us to test this hypothesis further and refine
our half-life predictions accordingly. Whilst the severity of infection among our study participants is likely to be
representative of community infection, our findings may be biased to healthcare workers. Moreover, a
population of paediatric healthcare workers are more likely to be repeatedly exposed to seasonal CoV
infection. We do not know to what extent this influences our measurements of the SARS-CoV-2 humoral
response or our estimates of antibody decay. Recent studies have hypothesized that previous exposure to
CoVs may confer some protection against SARS-CoV-2(36) and may need to be accounted for when
modelling transmission or longevity dynamics.(37) Results are conflicting, however, and it remains unclear if
any cross-reactivity is T-cell or antibody mediated.(38–41) Stratifying the SARS-CoV-2 humoral response by
seasonal coronavirus titers will enable this potential bias to be understood.
Although all study participants had clinical symptoms that they attributed to COVID-19 (Supplementary Table
1) and at least one positive serological test, not all participants were diagnosed by PCR testing. Despite our
formal performance evaluation of the MSD assay demonstrating a high sensitivity and specificity, it is
theoretically possible that some of our paired positive samples arose from repeated false positive tests. Our

estimates of the time-to-negative test for 50% of the population (tneg50) and the time-to-undetectable (tu50) are
also dependent on the negative thresholds and lower limits of detection of the assay, respectively. Serological
assays with very high positive-negative discrimination and low limits of detection will therefore detect antibody
TM
for longer. We repeated our analysis of N-antibody on the EDI assay which estimated an even lower tneg50 of
67 days (95% CI 47-91), suggesting that our estimates of the half-life of the N-antibody are robust between
assays.
Protective immunity is a complex dynamic of host, environmental and viral factors. It can be difficult to
disentangle the mechanisms underlying re-infection, including the role played by viral escape (i.e. genetic
drift) versus weak or waning immune responses.(42) To date, no definitive quantitative or qualitative correlateof-protection has been identified for SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease or onward transmission.(9, 43) This
hampers our understanding of the functional and clinical significance of waning antibodies (particularly Nantibody) observed in this study. Recent findings from animal studies support the role of neutralizing
antibodies as a correlate of immunity.(11, 16, 17) Similarly, a controlled human infection model of seasonal
CoV 229E demonstrated waning of IgG-specific antibodies within 1 year, with subsequent reinfection of 6/9
individuals upon homologous viral challenge, albeit without clinical symptoms.(44) If reinfection does occur,
severity of disease may therefore be attenuated, unless antibody-dependent disease enhancement by subneutralising antibody titers occurs.(42)
Furthermore, robust memory T-cell responses to specific SARS-CoV-2 peptides are elicited following
infection; this also includes seronegative and/or pauci-symptomatic individuals.(15, 40, 41) As such,
anamnestic cell-mediated immune responses may prevent clinically significant re-infection, in keeping with
other viral pathogens such as measles and hepatitis A. Prospective evaluation of re-infection alongside Tcell, B-cell and mucosal IgA dynamics should therefore be an urgent priority. The long-term data generated by
the Co-STARS study during the predicted future waves of the pandemic will be particularly informative.
In summary, this prospective cohort study of 137 longitudinally collected serological samples from 67
healthcare workers at Great Ormond Street Hospital has estimated that, in contrast to S-antibody, the half-life
of IgG to N-antigen is only 52 days. Fifty percent will therefore have negative N-antibodies 195 days after the
start of antibody decay. This has significant implications for sero-prevalence surveys that are based on the
measurement of IgG to N-antigen in order to understand the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within the population.
Data of this kind directly informs public health policy and responses to future waves of the pandemic.
Policymakers relying on these estimates at a population level may need to be cautious, allowing for possible
underestimation of the true prevalence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or exposure. Conversely, the
trimeric S-antibody correlated strongly with ACE-2 receptor blockade and persisted longer with 50% of
seropositive participants estimated to still test positive at 532 days (t1/2 81 days). This is reassuring for postvaccine licensure surveillance studies, given that current vaccine candidates are based on recombinant or
fragments of S-protein.(45) Our upper bound for any detectable antibodies (S, RBD or N) following mild-tomoderate infection was 1495 days.

Materials and methods
Study setting and design: Co-STARS is a 6-year single-centre, two-arm, prospective longitudinal cohort study
of healthcare workers at a central London paediatric hospital (Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children). The
th
study was approved to start by the United Kingdom NHS Health Research Authority on 29 April 2020 and
registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04380896). Informed consent was obtained from all participants. The
Study Protocol and Supplementary Materials submitted with this paper include detailed methods, power
calculations and the data analysis approach.
Study participants: All hospital staff members ≥18 years of age were eligible for the study, provided they did
not display symptoms consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection at recruitment. If they had been symptomatic or
had suspected contact with COVID-19 previously, at least 21 days were required to have passed prior to their
baseline visit. Those significantly immunosuppressed(23) or those who had previously received blood
products (including immunoglobulins or convalescent sera) since September 2019 were excluded from the
study.
Data Collection: After providing informed consent, participants undertook a detailed, standardised online
questionnaire at study entry. This included socio-demographic factors, details of previous exposure to and
symptomatic episodes consistent with COVID-19, any subsequent complications, previous SARS-CoV-2
diagnostic test results, past medical and contact history, and a comprehensive assessment of risk factors for
exposure, susceptibility to infection and severe disease. Blood samples were also taken at baseline and each
follow-up visit for determination of SARS-CoV-2 serology.
Measurement of SARS-CoV-2 serum antibody and viral RNA by PCR: All serological samples were analysed
by the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) Chemiluminescent binding assay that detects and quantifies anti-SARSCoV-2 IgG specific for trimeric S-protein, RBD and N-protein. All samples were run in parallel on the
commercial ELISA EDI kit (Epitope Diagnostics Inc., California) that detects the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG to Nprotein. The EDI kit did not quantify titers but did provide a positive, negative or equivocal test output with a
ratio relative to the positive control.
An MSD® 96-well Custom Competition Assay designed to measure the inhibition of ACE-2 receptor binding to
S or RBD by serum-derived antibody (MSD, Maryland) was run on 94 serial samples samples from 46
participants (two participants had 3 serial samples) in order to establish in vitro correlates of functional
immunity. IgG levels for the MSD assay were expressed as arbitrary units calibrated against a set of reference
sera distributed by the National Institute of Biological Standards and Control (Potters Bar, UK) under the
auspices of the World Health Organisation. Assay qualification and performance were evaluated in our
laboratories (see Supplementary Materials).
SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the N-gene was
performed following RNA extraction, as previously described by colleagues at our laboratory.(24)
Follow-Up Visits: All seropositive participants are being followed up monthly (ongoing) for repeat antibody
testing for the first 6 months then 6-monthly thereafter. Seronegative participants will be followed up 6monthly. At each follow-up visit, participants completed a shortened version of the baseline questionnaire,
focussing on any recurrent COVID-19 exposure and/or symptoms.
Study outcomes: The primary outcome of the study was to establish humoral dynamics following SARS-CoV2 infection. Secondary outcomes measures included the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 re-infection, the dynamics
of the cellular response, IgA dynamics and the clinical and demographic factors that are associated with the
rate of antibody decay.
Statistical analysis: Power calculations were based on log-linear regression using the pwr.f2.test function in R
for general linear models. We assumed a study power of 80% and provided a study power for a variety of
effect sizes and co-variates. We provided estimates for the study size required to detect effect sizes of ~20%
changes in log linear titers over 1 year with (with an alpha of 0.05) (Supplementary Figure 1).
We used a Bayesian framework to model antibody decay from 21 days post infection as a negative
exponential (log-linear) function of time using a random intercepts mixed effects model, with random effects at
the individual level to adjust for the titer variation between patients. The 21-day starting point for antibody
decay was chosen a-priori based on existing data of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2.(25) Plotting the rate

of decay against time supported our hypothesis that the rate of the negative exponential decay would remain
constant over time (Supplementary Figure 2).
Antibody titers were log-transformed and a linear model was fitted to the paired points using RSTAN in R (R:
A language and environment for statistical computing. Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria.
URL http://www.R-project.org/.).
Variability in antibody titers was modelled by introducing a random effects parameter at the level of the
individual. Biologically important covariates that were hypothesized a-priori to influence antibody titers,
including age, sex, BMI, comorbidities and ethnicity, were considered and the Deviance Information Criterion
(DIC) was used to define the model of best fit to the data. The prior for the slope was drawn from a normal
distribution (mean=0, variance=1), the intercept was a uniform distribution (min=0, max=10) while the random
effects were taken from a normal distribution (mean=0, sigma_u) where sigma_u was estimated from the
model.
The posterior probabilities of the slope were applied to infer the half-life distributions, using the following
relationship between the half-life and the slope: t1/2 = ln(2)/r where r is the slope sampled from the posterior
distribution and t1/2 is the half-life.
The time to test negativity for 50% of the population, tneg50, was defined as the time for the initial antibody titers
(measured from 21 days after symptom-onset) to decline to the negative threshold value for the assay. The
confidence limits around the curves were derived by repeated sampling from the posterior distribution of the
starting titers (including their random effect offset) combined with repeated sampling from the posterior slopes.
